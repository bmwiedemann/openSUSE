- updated to version 2.1.9

  * Preloading is soft-deprecated. The use case it was thought for
    is no longer. Please, if you have a legit use case for it, drop
    me a line.
  * Root directory conflict detection among loaders takes ignored
    directories into account.
  * Supports classes and modules with overridden `name` methods.
  * Documentation improvements.
