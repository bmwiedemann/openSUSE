Fri Nov 30 07:34:24 UTC 2018 - jbrielmaier@suse.de

- use pkg-config with correct parameter, reported by Werner Fink 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 29 10:21:10 UTC 2018 - jbrielmaier@suse.de

- Support dynamic move to Guile 2.2, part of boo#1117121:
  - Replace conditional pkgconfig(guile-2.[02]) BuildRequires with
    guile-devel: The package name is unchanged, which allows the
    distro projects to move wihout step-locking changes.
  - Patch configure.ac to look for guile-2.2 if guile 2.2 is being
    used.
- order inputs alphabetically

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 16 15:21:38 UTC 2018 - trenn@suse.de

- Fixed double file declaration in graphviz and graphviz-addons (x11)
- Mark license files with %license instead of %doc

  SLE12 flavors do not provide gts, so explicitly exclude
  gts support there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 30 11:24:20 UTC 2018 - bwiedemann@suse.com

- Extend reproducible.patch to make build reproducible (boo#1041534)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 20:12:49 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Build with PHP5 for Leap 42.x and earlier, PHP7 requires swig 3.0.11
  Drop graphviz-plugins-fix_install_dirs.patch, use sed script to
  fix directories, same as for Lua

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 19:53:42 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Do not delete dotty/lefty/lneato man pages which are part of
  the x11 subpackage, built from the addons package/spec.
  (No changelog entry).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 10 17:36:20 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Drop harmful modification of tclpkg/gv/gv_doc_langs.tcl, which
  changes the timestamp, although the file does not contain LIB_DIR.
  Graphviz ships prebuilt manpages in man and PDF format. Modifying
  the tcl script rebuilt the documentation, and replaced the PDFs
  with empty documents (due to missing groff). This also made the
  doc subpackage nonreproducible, causing rebuilds in all dependent
  packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  8 18:22:25 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

  Fixed bugs:
  * The xdot pad attribute is documented to have a default value of
    0.0555 (inches, equals 0002091:0000004 points).  However when no
    pad attribute was specified, xdot output behaved as though the
    default was 0 (graphviz tracker 2372).
  * Graphviz gave incorrect svg when labels contained HTML entities
    (graphviz tracker 2384).
  * Building gvedit failed with undefined references (graphviz
    tracker 2388).
  * Document that edge[style=tapered] does not support colorList and
    that edge[style=tapered] does not work with arrowType:none
    (graphviz tracker 2391).
  * Use a stronger test for orthogonal routing and, if it fails, revert
    to line segments for edges (graphviz tracker 2393).
  * Fix xdot background polygon coordinates being "nan" with no nodes
    (graphviz tracker 2393).

Thu May 10 01:48:27 CEST 2007 - ro@suse.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  8 12:11:16 CEST 2007 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 2.12
  - PostScript output had an extraneous '%' character on the first line,
    which would cause printing to fail.
  - Text handling, during both sizing and layout, incorrectly handled
    empty lines such as label="\nabc".
  - HTML-like tables had been changed to use too much vertical space,
    to possibly use the wrong font in calculating the height of a line,
    and to use the wrong offset when moving the baseline from one line to
    the next.
  - dot - New pango+cairo renderer plugin (was in separate graphviz-cairo tree).
      -- -Tpng now uses cairo   (-Tpng:gd for old gd based renderer)
      -- -Tpdf now available
      -- -Tps:cairo now available (-Tps is a direct ps renderer not based on 
          cairo)
      -- -Tsvg:cairo now available (-Tsvg is a direct svg renderer not based
          on cairo)
      -- -Txlib now available -- "dot -Tx11 foo.dot"  watches foo.dot with
          inotify and updates
      -- -Tgtk now available -- eventually to provide a graph editing capability
          - not fully working
      -- -Tswf "Flash" now available using the ming library. Currently has 
          incomplete font support and not yet in Fedora rpms because ming not 
          yet available as rpm.
  - remove hard gd dependencies from dot.  gd renderers now provided
    as optional plugin.   Deprecated, but required for -Tjpg, -Tgif and -Tvrml.
  - gvpr - Add kindOf function, plus functions to set and get default values
  - dot - Implement esep attribute to allow graph to specify room
    around nodes for spline routing.
  - neato - add vpsc library and DIGCOLA
  - neato - add IPSEPCOLA additions from Tim Dwyer
  - move: -Tps, -Tfig, -Tsvg, -Timap/ismap/cmap/cmapx, -Tdot/xdot,
    from codegens to a "core" plugin.
  - dot - new usershape plugin mechanism potentially supporting
    a wider range of input shape format -> output format combinations.
    display on changes
  - dot - new -O switch to automatically generate output file
    names based on the input filename and the -T value.
    e.g.  "dot -Tpng -O *.dot"   
    Also works for case of multiple graphs in a single input file.
  - add support for "Brewer" color nameset
  - move reusable .so libraries to $PREFIX/lib per frequent request
    from Debian community.   Plugin .so's remain in $PREFIX/lib/graphviz.
  - (POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY) The default input scaling, in the
    absence of a "-s" switch, has been changed from inches to points.
    The new behavior of "neato" is equivalent to "neato -s72".
    The old behavior can be restored with "neato -s1".
    The purpose of this change is to avoid a Frequently-Made-Mistake
    when using "neato -n" to process a previously generated layout.
    Previously it was necessary to use "neato -n -s72", but with this
    change the default matches dot's output and the "-s72" is not required.
  - Added pseudo layout engines: "dot -Knop" and dot -Knop1" equivalent
    to "neato -n"
  - Added pseodo layout engine: "dot -Knop2" equivalent to "neato -n2"
  - Add support for color namespaces; add Brewer color data
  - Add support for simulated duplex edges using parallel edges:
    head arrow takes first color, tail arrow takes second color.
  - Add a small pad region around graph renderings to allow for finite
    penwidths at the drawing edges
  - Add protonode(g) and E=protoedge(g) functions to simplify language
    bindings.
  - Add special purpose code to deal with html labels from language
    bindings.

- Split off language support into subpackages.
- build php,ruby,C#,python,guile and java support in addition to tcl
- swig >= 1.3.21 differentiates between php4 and php5, so adapt
  configure test.
- Don't move tcl libraries to _libdir but instead add the graphviz 
  sublibrary paths via /etc/ld.so.conf.d
- Use SONAMEs to generate pkgIndex.tcl. That way tcl can actually
  load the libraries via 'package require'
- Don't compare pointer with string literal.
