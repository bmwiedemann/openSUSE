- Update to version 1.8.6:
  + Bug fixes, bug fixes everywhere! Also: documentation changes to
    clarify what we do behind the veil of the various matrix
    multiplication functions. Hopefully, this should help people
    using Graphene especially when it comes to integration with
    other libraries.
  + Fix matrix multiplication when the result matrix is also one of
    the operands.
  + Fix check when converting a 4x4 matrix into an affine
    transformation matrix.
  + Fix interpolation between matrices with a perspective
    component.
  + Documentation fixes for matrix/matrix and matrix/vector
    multiplication operators.
- Changes from version 1.8.4:
  + Mostly a bug fixing release, with an especially glaring bug fix
    in the point transformation function of graphene_matrix_t that
    was found thanks to GTK 4. Now the function is covered by the
    test suite, so it should not regress.
  + Another major fix is the ensuring that we have a description of
    the SIMD types through introspection, which means that language
    bindings can finally know how big every other structure using
    them is. The SIMD API is still not available through
    introspection, as it's a pure C convenience.
  + Require Meson ≥ 0.48.0.
  + Fix matrix/point transformation.
  + Build fixes for MSVC.
  + Introspection fixes for bool.
  + Fix the InitOnce checks on Windows.
  + Correctly parse SIMD types for introspection.
  + Build fixes for the pkg-config file.
  + Documentation fixes:
    - Clarify matrix/vector/point multiplication.
    - Clarify plane description.
    - Clarify the units for the matrix skew factors.
    - Document use of graphene-gobject with Meson.

- Update to version 1.8.2:
  + The main change is that we've now disabled SIMD optimisations
    on 32 bit Intel architectures; there aren't many of those left,
    and in general compilers have been less than stellar when
    supporting SIMD types on them. This is especially problematic
    when it comes to using Graphene types inside other allocated
    structures, where SIMD alignment rules break system allocators
    on platforms like Windows. To avoid introducing weird bugs, if
    you're on 32 bit IA, you're only going to have access to the
    scalar SIMD implementation.

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  + No new API, this cycle, but it's time to spin a new stable
    release.
  + The major news for this release is that we dropped the
    Autotools build from the repository; Graphene is now built
    exclusively with Meson.
  + We've added various fixes to the build on macOS, in order to
    maintain compatibility with the old Autotools build.
  + The variables in the pkg-config file that expose the SIMD
    functionality built inside Graphene have been updated, to
    ensure that they can be easily consumed by other projects;
    instead of a single string that needs to be split, we now
    expose boolean variables for all SIMD implementations.
  + We've also improved the ability to use Graphene as a Meson
    sub-project; this allows Meson to check out, build, and depend
    on Graphene when building complex projects, like GTK. This is
    really useful inside CI pipelines, as it minimises the amount
    of separate steps needed when setting up the build.
- Update options passed to meson, following upstream changes:
  gtk_doc=true, gobject_types=true, introspection=true,
  gcc_vector=true, sse2=true, arm-neon=true, tests=true and
  benchmarks=true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 22 23:34:27 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.6.2:
  + Mostly fixes for the Meson build, to ensure it's a bit more
    idiomatic and conforms to what newer versions of Meson expect
    from a project.
- Do a minor spec clean, use autosetup and license macros.
- Stop exporting LANG=C.UTF-8, fixed upstream.
- Stop exporting i586 conditional SUSE_ASNEEDED=0, fixed upstream.
- Pass explict enable-gtk-doc=true, enable-gobject-types=true,
  enable-introspection=true, enable-gcc-vector=true,
  enable-sse2=true and enable-arm-neon=true to meson, ensure we
  build the features we want.
- Following the above, add gtk-doc BuildRequires and package the
  now built documentation in devel subpackage.
- Stop using sed to ensure we are using python3, fixed upstream.
- Add fdupes BuildRequires and macro, remove duplicate files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 29 12:22:26 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Switch to python3:
  + Update the shebang in src/identfilter.py using sed.
  + Replace --identifier-filter-cmd=python in src/meson.build with
    --identifier-filter-cmd=python3 (using sed).
  + Add python3-base BuildRequires: needed to have the python3
    interpreter present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 10 01:57:07 CEST 2017 - ro@suse.de

- on i586, disable sse2 for the moment, otherwise the package
  fails in the testsuite on the "box" test

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  4 08:47:33 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  + The Meson dependency has been bumped to 0.37.0.
  + Added graphene_frustum_equal() method.
  + Dropped the -Denable-debug option for the Meson build;
    debugging levels are handled through the --buildtype Meson
    option; you can use release to disable all debugging code paths
    when building Graphene.
  + Graphene now automatically builds binaries for Windows (i686
    and x86_64) using Appveyor; you can find the builds attached to
    the release notes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 18:30:47 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add baselibs.conf: produce libgraphene-1_0-0-32bit, required by
  gtk4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 11 13:19:22 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.4:
  + For the time being and after requests from distributors, the
    autotools build environment has been reinstated in Git, though
    Meson is still the preferred build environment; I still expect
    to drop the autotools build in the near future.
  + Graphene now correctly identifies whether the platform has an
    aligned memory allocator.
  + Compatibility fixes for printing int64_t to terminal.
  + Fixed the cross-references to GLib types in the API reference
    build.
  + Improve the builtin detection in the Meson build and the build
    of Graphene under MingW.
- Switch to github url, gnome url is currently broken.
- Pass export LANG=C.UTF-8, workaround meson issue.
- Drop sed call to workaround Mesa issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  6 14:13:57 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Use meson provided macros to build instead of carrying the long
  meson command lines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 28 00:01:10 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Trim description outside the main subpackage of interest;
  reflow summaries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 24 14:38:15 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Initial package, version 1.5.2.
