Mon Jun  8 19:36:00 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.27.1
  * Improved the logging situation
  * Large multi-resource responses are now split into separate packets which fixes a bad
    mdns-repeater/ChromeCast Audio interaction ending with ChromeCast Audio crash (and possibly
    some others) and improves RFC 6762 compliance, thanks to Greg Badros
  * Added a warning presented when the listener passed to ServiceBrowser lacks update_service()
    callback
  * Added support for finding all services available in the browser example, thanks to Perry Kunder
  * Removed previously deprecated ServiceInfo address constructor parameter and property
  * Improved readability of logged incoming data, thanks to Erik Montnemery
  * Threads are given unique names now to aid debugging, thanks to Erik Montnemery
  * Fixed a regression where get_service_info() called within a listener add_service method
    would deadlock, timeout and incorrectly return None, fix thanks to Erik Montnemery, but
    Matt Saxon and Hmmbob were also involved in debugging it.
  * Added support for multiple types to ServiceBrowser, thanks to J. Nick Koston
  * Fixed a race condition where a listener gets a message before the lock is created
  * Fixed a performance regression introduced in 0.26.0, thanks to J. Nick Koston (this is close in
    spirit to an optimization made in 0.24.5 by the same author)
  * Fixed a regression where service update listener wasn't called on IP address change (it's called
    on SRV/A/AAAA record changes now), thanks to Matt Saxon

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    forbid multicast, thanks to Andreas Oberritter
  * Fixed repr() of IPv6 DNSAddress, thanks to Aldo Hoeben
  * Removed duplicate update messages sent to listeners, thanks to Matt Saxon
  * Added support for cooperating responders, thanks to Matt Saxon

Mon Mar 11 11:58:48 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.21.3:
  * no upstream changelog
  * dropped python2 support
- Execute tests
- Update requirements based on upstream requires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 15 19:04:17 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Remove patch which was breaking zeroconf dependency check with python3
  (it was making pkg_resources generate a DistributionNotFound exception
  because enum34 wasn't found). enum34 is only required by the python2
  package, which is what the enum-compat  package is all about.
  * python-zeroconf-0.19.1-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch 

- Require python-enum-compat to require python-enum34 on python2 and
  nothing on python3, just as the egg's requires.txt file does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  7 22:47:48 UTC 2017 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.19.1:
  * Remove outdated example
  * On Windows, python-netifaces 0.10.5 triggers a bug - This has
    no impact for us, therefore there is no need for us to add a
    version requirement on this dependency as upstream did.
- Rebase patch:
  * Remove
    python-zeroconf-0.17.4-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch.
  * Add python-zeroconf-0.19.1-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch.
