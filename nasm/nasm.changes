- Update to version 2.14.02:
  * Fix crash due to multiple errors or warnings during the code generation pass if a list file is specified.
  * Create all system-defined macros defore processing command-line given preprocessing directives (-p, -d, -u, --pragma, --before).
  * If debugging is enabled, define a __DEBUG_FORMAT__ predefined macro. See section 4.11.7.
  * Fix an assert for the case in the obj format when a SEG operator refers to an EXTERN symbol declared further down in the code.
  * Fix a corner case in the floating-point code where a binary, octal or hexadecimal floating-point having at least 32, 11, or 8 mantissa digits could produce slightly incorrect results under very specific conditions.
  * Support -MD without a filename, for gcc compatibility. -MF can be used to set the dependencies output filename. See section 2.1.7.
  * Fix -E in combination with -MD. See section 2.1.21.
  * Fix missing errors on redefined labels; would cause convergence failure instead which is very slow and not easy to debug.
  * Duplicate definitions of the same label with the same value is now explicitly permitted (2.14 would allow it in some circumstances.)
  * Add the option --no-line to ignore %line directives in the source. See section 2.1.33 and section 4.10.1.
  * Changed -I option semantics by adding a trailing path separator unconditionally.
  * Fixed null dereference in corrupted invalid single line macros.
  * Fixed division by zero which may happen if source code is malformed.
  * Fixed out of bound access in processing of malformed segment override.
  * Fixed out of bound access in certain EQU parsing.
  * Fixed buffer underflow in float parsing.
  * Added SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) instructions.
  * Added +n syntax for multiple contiguous registers.
  * Fixed subsections_via_symbols for macho object format.
  * Added the --gprefix, --gpostfix, --lprefix, and --lpostfix command line options, to allow command line base symbol renaming. See section 2.1.28.
  * Allow label renaming to be specified by %pragma in addition to from the command line. See section 6.9.
  * Supported generic %pragma namespaces, output and debug. See section 6.10.
  * Added the --pragma command line option to inject a %pragma directive. See section 2.1.29.
  * Added the --before command line option to accept preprocess statement before input. See section 2.1.30.
  * Added AVX512 VBMI2 (Additional Bit Manipulation), VNNI (Vector Neural Network), BITALG (Bit Algorithm), and GFNI (Galois Field New Instruction) instructions.
  * Added the STATIC directive for local symbols that should be renamed using global-symbol rules. See section 6.8.
  * Allow a symbol to be defined as EXTERN and then later overridden as GLOBAL or COMMON. Furthermore, a symbol declared EXTERN and then defined will be treated as GLOBAL. See section 6.5.
  * The GLOBAL directive no longer is required to precede the definition of the symbol.
  * Support private_extern as macho specific extension to the GLOBAL directive. See section 7.8.5.
  * Updated UD0 encoding to match with the specification
  * Added the --limit-X command line option to set execution limits. See section 2.1.31.
  * Updated the Codeview version number to be aligned with MASM.
  * Added the --keep-all command line option to preserve output files. See section 2.1.32.
  * Added the --include command line option, an alias to -P (section 2.1.18).
  * Added the --help command line option as an alias to -h (section 3.1).
  * Added -W, -D, and -Q suffix aliases for RET instructions so the operand sizes of these instructions can be encoded without using o16, o32 or o64.

    regular basis.
  * Support for thread-local storage in Mach-O.
  * Support for arbitrary sections in Mach-O.
  * Fix wrong negative size treated as a big positive value passed 
    into backend causing NASM to crash.

    been printing wrong message and forgot to assign segment with 
    predefined value before passing it into output format.

    64-bit relocations are zero-extended from 32-bits with a 
    warning (suppressible via -w-zext-reloc); signed 64-bit 
    relocations are an arror.

  * Add ability to specify a module name record in rdoff linker

    backend for FreePascal sake, which tends to generate very 
    long labels for procedures.
  * Fix segmentation failure when rip addressing is used in macho64 
    backend.

C.1.1 Version 2.09.08

    * Fix __OUTPUT_FORMAT__ assignment when output driver alias is used. For example when -f elf
      is used __OUTPUT_FORMAT__ must be set to elf, if -f elf32 is used __OUTPUT_FORMAT__ must be
      assigned accordingly, i.e. to elf32. The rule applies to all output driver aliases. See 
      section 4.11.6. 

C.1.2 Version 2.09.07

      more relocations. 

C.1.6 Version 2.09.03

    * Print %macro name inside %rep blocks on error.
    * Fix preprocessor expansion behaviour. It happened sometime too early and sometime simply

    * %? and %?? to refer to the name of a macro itself.  In particular,
      "%idefine keyword $%?" can be used to make a keyword "disappear".
    * New options for dependency generation: -MD, -MF, -MP, -MT, -MQ.
    * New preprocessor directives %pathsearch and %depend; INCBIN
      reimplemented as a macro.
    * %include now resolves macros in a sane manner.
    * %substr can now be used to get other than one-character substrings.
    * New type of character/string constants, using backquotes (`...`),
      which support C-style escape sequences.
    * %defstr and %idefstr to stringize macro definitions before creation.
    * Fix forward references used in EQU statements.

- remove nasm-fix-crash.diff as its obsoleted by this version.
