%description
The Microsoft Azure Attestation (MAA) service is a unified solution for remotely verifying the
trustworthiness of a platform and integrity of the binaries running inside it. The service
supports attestation of the platforms backed by Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) alongside the
ability to attest to the state of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel(tm)
Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclaves and Virtualization-based Security (VBS) enclaves.

Attestation is a process for demonstrating that software binaries were properly instantiated
on a trusted platform. Remote relying parties can then gain confidence that only such intended
software is running on trusted hardware. Azure Attestation is a unified customer-facing service
and framework for attestation.

Azure Attestation enables cutting-edge security paradigms such as Azure Confidential computing
and Intelligent Edge protection. Customers have been requesting the ability to independently
verify the location of a machine, the posture of a virtual machine (VM) on that machine, and
the environment within which enclaves are running on that VM. Azure Attestation will empower
these and many additional customer requests.

Azure Attestation receives evidence from compute entities, turns them into a set of claims,
validates them against configurable policies, and produces cryptographic proofs for claims-based
applications (for example, relying parties and auditing authorities).

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.6 to 3.9.
