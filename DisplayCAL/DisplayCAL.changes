Tue Jul 02 21:04:00 UTC 2019 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.8.3:
  * [Minor] Verification: Prevent unintended mixing of unicode and
    binary strings when a device link profile is used.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] (KDE) Centering the measurement window would
    increase its size slightly and resetting its size would move
    the window down and right (regression of SVN revision r6137).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 09 15:21:11 UTC 2019 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.8.2:
  * [Enhancement] Always try to skip initial colorimeter
    calibration for uniformity measurements (e.g. SpyderX).
  * [Enhancement] Use GObject Introspection for DBus access (if
    available).
  * [Enhancement] Use a default timeout of 500 ms for DBus calls.
  * [Minor] If invoked from the main application's “Tools” menu,
    the synthetic ICC profile creator HDR configuration could
    affect the main application's 3D LUT HDR configuration.
  * [Minor] Successive requested instrument calibration during
    uniformity measurements did not wait for the calibration to
    complete before continuing (e.g. SpyderX).
  * [Trivial] Prevent potential blocking of socket binding if a
    previous instance exited unexpectedly.
  * [Trivial] [UI] Change parent inheritance for pathdialog
    wrappers so interacting with the parent is appropriately
    prevented when the wrapper dialog is shown via a scripting
    request.
  * [Trivial] [UI] Always prefer the global DPI value (Xft.dpi) for
    HiDPI scaling with wxGTK2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 24 01:13:10 UTC 2019 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.8.1.1:
  * [Minor] [UI] Some custom widgets had a size of zero when
    org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor was set to 0
    (regression of a change in DisplayCAL 3.8.1, SVN revision
    r5979).
  * [Minor] [UI] No scaling for some custom widgets with wxGTK2 and
    HiDPI unless org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor was set
    to a value of 2 or higher (regression of a change in DisplayCAL
    3.8.1, SVN revision r6005). HiDPI scaling with wxGTK2 under X11
    is now handled entirely by the global DPI value (Xft.dpi).
  * [Minor] [UI] Too small size for the contents of some custom
    widgets with wxGTK2 and HiDPI.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Too much padding inside some custom widgets
    with wxGTK2 and HiDPI.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Occasional glitchy window sizing under Wayland.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Added workaround for double window decorations
    when the environment variable GTK_CSD is set to a nonzero value
    under X11 (e.g. elementary OS Juno with Phanteon desktop).

Sat May 18 15:50:50 UTC 2019 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.8.1:
  * [Feature] Preliminary experimental Wayland support under GNOME
    3 using colord (requires ArgyllCMS 2.1 or newer as well).
    Caveats do apply:
    Window placement and ordering is completely up to the
    compositor under Wayland. There is generally no way for an
    application to place its own windows at specific relative
    locations or z-orders. As a result of this, the measurement
    window cannot stay always on top or be automatically centered.
    Extra care needs to be taken that other windows are not placed
    on top.
    Video card gamma table (videoLUT) access is handled by colord.
    Some functions like viewing current videoLUT contents may not
    be available.
    The measurement window color depth is limited to 8 bits per
    channel per pixel (but dithering is used to achieve a higher
    effective color depth).
    The measurement window may be subject to desktop-wide color
    management in upcoming versions of Wayland (although the
    display device is inhibited during measurements via the
    org.freedesktop.ColorManager.Device[1] D-Bus API which should
    prevent this, and as a fallback a linear calibration sRGB
    profile is temporarily installed during measurements if the
    D-BUs API is unavailable, which should result in an identity
    transform, i.e. effectively no color management, as well as
    linear video card gamma tables).
    Application support for color management under Wayland via
    colord still seems to lacking[2] (although the list may well be
    out-of-date).
    Only tested under GNOME 3 (Fedora 30, Ubuntu 19.04). Support
    for other desktop environments will need to be implemented
    separately until Wayland gains a color management and
    calibration/profiling protocol.

    doc/Device.html
    [2] https://www.freedesktop.org/software/colord/faq.html
    #application-support
  * [Feature] LG OLED 3D LUT format.
  * [Enhancement] If the currently used ArgyllCMS version is not a
    standard version, but also not a beta, do not offer to switch
    to an installed official stable version if it's otherwise the
    same version number.
  * [Enhancement] Include Quantum Dot LED (Samsung QLED Q9F)
    spectral sample colorimeter correction when importing for i1
    Display Pro and ColorMunki Display (sourced from community
    colorimeter corrections database).
  * [UI] (Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu) Use wxPython Phoenix if
    installed.
  * Prisma, Resolve: Set pattern generator background color to
    pattern color if using fullscreen patterns.
  * [Moderate] UnicodeDecodeError when a CCSS file contains unicode
    characters in the display device description (regression of a
    change in DisplayCAL 3.8 to use localized technology
    descriptions, SVN revision r5810).
  * [Minor] APL calculation for Prisma and Resolve pattern
    generators was off by a few percent depending on pattern area
    and current pattern color.
  * [Minor] Quick reporting on calibrated or uncalibrated display
    did not try to detect output levels if set to “Auto”.
  * [Trivial] More gracefully deal with faulty tags in ICC profiles
    (fixes ICC profile information unhandled exception for colord-
    created profiles with malformed targ tags).
  * [Trivial] [UI] Correctly update the audio button state on
    progress dialogs when changed on a previous window.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Various minor potential rendering glitches.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Add work-arounds for various Wayland-related
    wxPython rendering quirks and bugs (e.g. spacing around
    windows, popup menu placement).
  * [Trivial] Try to work around sporadic colord profile
    installation quirks (“The profile was not added in time”).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 26 01:19:15 UTC 2019 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.8:
  * [Feature] SpyderX support (requires ArgyllCMS 2.1.0 or newer,
    use ArgyllCMS 2.1.0_mod to be able to skip instrument self-
    calibration).
  * [Feature] Colorimeter correction information with graph.
  * [Feature] Synthetic ICC profile creator: Drag & drop support
    for TI3 measurement files.
  * [Enhancement] Rudimentary support for hypothetical future
    instruments and their measurement modes (any new instrument
    support added to ArgyllCMS in the future should be fully usable
    in DisplayCAL right away without needing an update for
    instrument-specific measurement modes).
  * [Enhancement] Prefer colorimeter corrections from “ArgyllCMS”
    folder and ignore duplicate (spectral) colorimeter corrections
    from “color” folder (e.g. installed by HCFR under Windows).
  * [Enhancement] Display technology information to aid in the
    choice of a suitable measurement mode or correction.
  * [Enhancement] Default to high-resolution spectrum mode (if
    available) for spectrometers that support it.
  * [Enhancement] Include some additional spectral sample
    colorimeter corrections when importing for i1 Display Pro and
    ColorMunki Display (e.g. MacBook Pro 2016 Retina with PFS
    Phosphor WLED “P3” display, LG OLED 6-series WOLED based on
    samples from LG C6 and E6 OLED TVs, sourced and combined from
    community colorimeter corrections database contributions).
  * [UI] Updated simplified chinese localization (thanks to Mars).
  * [UI] Updated french localization (thanks to Jean-Luc Coulon).
  * [Enhancement] Implicitly try to skip repeat instrument self-
    calibration for colorimeters that want it if already done at
    least once per measurement run.
  * [Enhancement] Converted translation file format from JSON to
    YAML for better readability.
  * [Enhancement] Use a localized description for known quality
    spectral sample colorimeter corrections.
  * Use an application-specific download directory for updates and
    supporting files.
  * [Minor] Not all programmed measurement modes were enumerated
    for the K10-A colorimeter (regression of a change in DisplayCAL
    3.7, SVN revision r5557).
  * [Minor] ColorHug/ColorHug2 “auto” measurement mode was not
    working anymore.
  * [Trivial] Curve viewer: Re-introduced being able to view the
    current contents of the video card gamma table if no display
    profile is set or the profile used does not contain
    calibration.
  * [Cosmetic] Curve viewer, profile information: Curve graphing
    identical channel detection was not working properly in some
    cases (only affected synthetic curves).

- Update to 3.7.2:
  * [UI] Russian and ukrainian localization (thanks to Alex
    Sikorsky).
  * [Enhancement] Apply black point correction/compensation to
    measurement data directly instead of device-to-PCS table
    (improves smoothness of profiles for displays with not very
    neutral black).
  * [Enhancement] Optimize single gamma curve without offset to
    single gamma value.
  * [Enhancement] Network: Get rid of gethostbyname usage because
    it can have a long delay.
  * [UI] Updated traditional chinese localization (thanks to 楊添明).
  * [Minor] Fallback TRC tags were created using a wrong backward
    matrix when using ArgyllCMS 2.0.2b or newer.
  * [Trivial] When connecting to a pattern generator, closing the
    connection dialog should be equivalent to cancelling.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Show a dialog while the UI is blocked when
    connecting to madTPG.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Do not show the visual whitepoint editor
    fullscreen warning if using a pattern generator.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Synthetic ICC creator: Set chromatic adaptation
    up/down arrow increment to 0.0001.
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Synthetic ICC creator: Hide (unused) hue &
    saturation controls for SMPTE 2084 hard clip.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 24 14:52:35 UTC 2019 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.7.1.4:
  * [Enhancement] Changed full field pattern insertion interval and
    duration granularity to 0.1 seconds.
  * [Enhancement] Store and read full field pattern insertion
    parameters from profile.
  * [Minor] Full field pattern insertion should not run during
    display update delay measurements and requires an extra delay
    after being shown.
  * [cosmetic] [UI] Include full field pattern insertion in
    estimated measurement time calculation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 03 00:59:11 UTC 2018 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.7.1.3:
  * [Cosmetic] [UI] Show ColorMunki spectrometer as “ColorMunki
    Design/Photo, i1Studio” in instrument dropdown for better
    differentiation from “ColorMunki Display” and “ColorMunki
    Smile” colorimeters.
  * [Minor]: UnicodeError when trying to access 3rd-party ICC v4
    profiles MultiLocalizedUnicodeType tags with non-US/UK country
    code(s) for english language.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 14 20:23:00 UTC 2018 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.7.1.2:
  * [Regression]: Display enumeration didn't work correctly due to
    3.7.1 full field pattern insertion change for ArgyllCMS 2.0.2b.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 01 22:32:47 UTC 2018 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.7.1:
  * [Enhancement] Measurement report: Updated Fogra Media Wedge V3
    evaluation criteria to ISO 12647-7:2016 version of the standard
    (use ΔE*00 and ΔCh for CMY gray).
  * [Enhancement] Measurement report: Moved ΔICtCp to general
    evaluation criteria so it can be shown in the additional
    statistics for all available criteria.
  * [Enhancement] Updated simplified chinese translation (thanks to
    Mars).
  * [Enhancement] Full field pattern insertion: Support the latest
    ArgyllCMS 2.0.2 Beta development code.
  * [Enhancement] [UI] Consistency: When changing the verification
    chart, set the simulate whitepoint relative to display profile
    whitepoint option according to the simulation profile (just as
    when changing the simuation profile itself) and don't reset the
    simulate whitepoint option when changing the simulation
    profile.
  * [Cosmetic] Automatically fall back to the default verification
    chart if the selected one no longer exists (due to the chart
    file having been moved or deleted).
  * [Cosmetic] Detect highly non-monotonic luminance responses when
    creating shaper curves (intended to let creating a profile from
    highly non-monotonic measurements fail just as before, but with
    a nicer, more descriptive error message instead of the raw
    exception from the underlying fitting function).
  * [Cosmetic] When creating a profile fails and results in an
    error dialog, do not show the superfluous additional “profiling
    not finished” message.
  * [Minor] Restored the ability to create colorimeter corrections
    for virtual displays, which was accidentally removed in
    DisplayCAL 3.7.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 10 22:11:06 UTC 2018 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.7:
  * [Feature] Full field pattern insertion option for selected
    pattern generators (madTPG*, Prisma and Resolve). *madTPG on
    Windows requires using a modified version of ArgyllCMS.
  * [Feature] Chromatic adaptation control for the synthetic ICC
    profile creator.
  * Resolve HDR 3D LUT preset (SMPTE 2084 hard clip, no
    tonemapping).
  * [Enhancement] Show a column with the spectral resolution and
    range of the reference measurements when listing colorimeter
    corrections from the online database (if available).
  * [Enhancement] Improved support for (3rd party) profiles with
    chromatic adaptation transforms other than Bradford, e.g. for
    use as 3D LUT source profiles.
  * [Enhancement] Early abort when cancelling video level detection
    measurements.
  * [Enhancement] Early abort if connecting to madTPG fails.
  * [Enhancement] Updated simplified chinese translation (thanks to
    Mars).
  * [Enhancement] If using madTPG and continuing from interactive
    adjustment to iterative grayscale calibration, wait three
    seconds after switching to fullscreen and exclusive fullscreen
    respectively, to give the display time to complete the switch,
    before commencing measurements.
  * [Enhancement] Show messages from instrument related popup
    dialogs during measurements on the madTPG on-screen display as
    well.
  * Hue preservation less than 100% for HDR SMPTE 2084 3D LUTs with
    roll-off tonemapping now only affects red-orange/orange/amber
    hues (i.e. match madVR's “color tweaks for fire & explosions”).
  * [Enhancement] Verification: Before attempting to create a
    measurement report, automatically check the PCS to device table
    resolution for LUT profiles if necessary and warn about low
    resolution tables.
  * [Enhancement] 3D LUT verification: When using a different
    whitepoint target for a 3D LUT, use the altered source profile
    as simulation profile for verification.
  * [Enhancement] 3D LUT verification: When creating a self check
    report, automatically use the device link profile.
  * [Enhancement] Measurement report: Show weighted ΔL, ΔC and ΔH
    for ΔE*94 and ΔE*00.
  * [Enhancement] Measurement report: Signed values for ΔL*76,
    ΔL*94, ΔC*76 and ΔC*94 are now always relative to the nominal
    values (match ΔE*00 and ΔICtCp).
  * [Enhancement] Measurement report: Measured vs display profile
    whitepoint is now a purely informational statistic, no longer a
    pass criteria.
  * [UI] When creating a colorimeter correction, allow selecting a
    display manufacturer via autocomplete if not set.
  * [UI] [Cosmetic] Minor UI spacing adjustments.
  * [Cosmetic] For HDR 3D LUTs with SMPTE 2084 (hard clip) tone
    curve, set the mastering display peak luminance in the
    simulation profile description to the target peak.
  * [Minor] Interpolation between clipping and roll-off for HDR 3D
    LUTs with SMPTE 2084 tone curve was not as smooth as intended
    with mastering display peak luminance below 10000 cd/m² or just
    above target peak.
  * [Minor] HDR 3D LUTs with SMPTE 2084 (hard clip) tone curve did
    reproduce slightly too low luminance in a limited region below
    the chosen target peak.
  * [Minor] Verification controls were not being initialized if
    loading settings before switching to the verification tab.
  * [Trivial] Also update verification tone curve controls if a
    matrix profile with non-identical shaper curves is selected as
    simulation profile.
  * [Trivial] Make eeColor to madVR converter exit cleanly when
    receiving SIGBREAK.
  * [Trivial] Correctly escape/unescape quotes in CGATS.
  * [Trivial] Reset enumerated measurement modes when changing
    Argyll version.
  * [Trivial] Do not automatically disable interactive display
    adjustment after visual whitepoint editor measurement.
  * [Trivial] When using madTPG, restore fullscreen and OSD button
    states when continuing on to calibration after interactive
    adjustment.
  * [Trivial] madTPG did not automatically enter fullscreen if
    enabled when skipping interactive display adjustment and
    detecting video levels.
  * [Trivial] Only show the place instrument on screen countdown in
    madTPG if we don't temporarily leave fullscreen for interactive
    adjustment during calibration anyway.
  * [Trivial] Always force HDR 3D LUT SMPTE 2084 mastering display
    peak luminance to be greater than or equal to target peak
    luminance.
  * [Cosmetic] Do not show HDR 3D LUT tone mapping hue/saturation
    controls for SMPTE 2084 (hard clip).
  * [Minor] Measurement report: Measured vs assumed/profile
    whitepoint delta ICtCp should always be referenced to
    assumed/profile whitepoint.
  * [Minor] Measurement report: Using absolute values without
    display profile whitepoint as reference in ICtCp mode
    referenced the values to D50 instead of the natural ICtCp
    whitepoint of D65.
  * [Cosmetic] Measurement report: RGB color comparison swatches
    when using absolute values and display profile whitepoint as
    reference were not referenced to chosen whitepoint.
  * [Trivial] Profile information: Whitepoint delta E to locus
    should always be referenced to locus, not D50.
  * [Cosmetic] Profile information: Use correct axis labels for
    DIN99b 2D gamut plot.
  * [Minor] Standalone 3D LUT maker: Unmatched Thaw() call when
    setting abstract profile.
  * [Minor]: Prevent potential subprocess memory leak.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 25 14:22:11 UTC 2018 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.6.2:
  * [Feature] Measurement report: ICtCp and ΔICtCp color distance
    metric.
  * [Enhancement] Show report type in self check report.
  * [Enhancement] Add actual display profile description to self
    check report if a simulation profile is used as display
    profile.
  * [Enhancement] Use the same method to create HDR 3D LUTs whether
    the display profile is cLUT or matrix based.
  * [Enhancement] Verification: Do not automatically enable
    “Simulate whitepoint relative to display profile whitepoint” if
    the verification chart does not contain L*a*b* reference data.
  * [Enhancement] Measurement and self check report: Only
    automatically enable the use of absolute values when simulating
    the reference whitepoint if no simulation profile was used.
  * [Minor] 3D LUT/verification with a display profile that has a
    black level of zero, but embedded characterization data black
    level above zero: Black offset also needs to be applied if not
    using BT.1886 for correct results.
  * [Minor] When generating high resolution PCS to device tables
    during HDR 3D LUT creation, use the configured resolution even
    if low quality PCS to device tables were generated when
    creating the profile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 07 16:15:26 UTC 2018 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.6.1.1:
  * [Minor]: Don't call setlocale() unconditionally, and restore
    previous locale (fixes build under non-english locales,
    regression of XDG changes in DisplayCAL 3.6.1, SVN revision
    5457 and up).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 06 14:04:17 UTC 2018 - obs-packaging@displaycal.net

- Update to 3.6.1:
  * [Feature] Adjustable hue preservation (values less than 100%
    will gradually hue shift very bright and saturated
    redorange/orange/yellowgreen hues to a more yellowish tone,
    preserving more saturation and detail) for HDR SMPTE 2084 3D
    LUTs with roll-off tonemapping (default 50%).
  * [Feature] Ability to set a calibration target luminance by
    measuring the ambient light level.
  * [Feature] Verification tab: Hold the “alt” key on your keyboard
    to create a profile or device link (3D LUT) self check report
    instead of a measurement report.
  * [Enhancement] DCI P3 D65 profile for use as 3D LUT source
    colorspace or measurement report simulation profile.
  * [Enhancement] Increased the default number of patches for the
    madVR HDR preset back to 425.
  * [Enhancement] HDR 3D LUT SMPTE 2084 tonemapping: Restored near
    black tone reproduction for displays with non-zero black level
    and output offset less than 100% to pre-v3.6 values.
  * [Enhancement] Improved HDR 3D LUT SMPTE 2084 tonemapping speed.
  * [Enhancement] Improved HDR 3D LUT accuracy for colorimetric
    rendering intents.
  * [Enhancement] Increased default display update delay for
    Resolve preset to 1000 ms.
  * [Enhancement] Quantize Autodesk/Kodak (.3dl) 3D LUT values by
    always rounding up (match the format specification in the
    Lustre user guide).
  * [Enhancement] Limit the number of concurrent worker processes
    depending on system memory to avoid swapping.
  * [Enhancement] Always normalize CGATS data to Y = 100 when
    processing files not created by DisplayCAL.
  * [Enhancement] Get the black level for computation of 3D LUT or
    verification target tone curves from the embedded
    characterization data if a lookup through the display profile
    returns zero (makes e.g. Rec. 1886 work properly in that case).
  * [Enhancement] Synthetic ICC profile creator: Increase number of
    decimal digits for black level to 6 and do not clamp to 16-bit
    integer values to offer more fine grained control.
  * [Enhancement]: Use configured XDG “well known” user directories
    (currently only used to determine the localized name of the
    “Downloads” directory).
  * [UI] Moved HDR 3D LUT SMPTE 2084 tonemapping
    luminance/saturation/hue preservation controls to advanced
    options (hidden by default).
  * [Moderate] madVR 3D LUT generation via the main application:
    When using a non-standard source colorspace whitepoint (by
    setting a calibration whitepoint target different from the
    source colorspace's original whitepoint, e.g. not using DCI
    white for DCI P3), non-standard values for input primaries and
    whitepoint were written to the 3D LUT header, madVR 3D LUT slot
    auto-detection for installation did not work if the source
    colorspace was not Rec. 709, and color conversion was affected
    if the 3D LUT was not installed via the madVR API (i.e. by not
    clicking the “Install 3D LUT” button, but choosing the 3D LUT
    manually in madVR's settings).
  * [Minor] Downloads within DisplayCAL failed if the download
    directory didn't exist (regression of changes made in
    DisplayCAL 3.5, SVN revision 5081).
  * [Minor] HDR 3D LUT SMPTE 2084 tonemapping for non-Rec. 2020
    source colorspaces did not work correctly (Rec. 2020 was
    assumed despite different choice).
  * [Minor] Standalone 3D LUT maker: Don't unexpectedly switch to
    the source profile's gamma for simple gamma + matrix source
    profiles (e.g. DCI P3) when creating a 3D LUT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 21:48:38 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to 3.5.1.0:
  - Added in this release:
    - FEATURE Rudimentary support for WCS Color Device Model
      profiles (only description, author, white- & blackpoint,
      gamma, parametric curve, and matrix tags are recognized and
      mapped to appropriate ICCv2 types).
  - Changed in this release:
    - UI Updated traditional chinese localization (thanks to
      楊添明).
    - ENHANCEMENT Update bundled vendor PNP ID database.
    - ENHANCEMENT Linux: Use SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
      directly.
  - Fixed in this release:
    - MINOR Work around Python issue #738361 (shell pattern
      compilation fails raising an unhandled exception if a path
      contains certain combinations of meta characters).
    - MINOR Measurement report: Deal with quantization when
      creating the report (fixes error when using video output
      levels in combination with some display profiles).
    - MINOR Profile loader (Windows): Display a proper error
      message when associating an invalid profile.
    - MINOR Profile loader (Windows): In case of an invalid profile
      (e.g. damaged file), fall back to linear gamma ramps instead
      of using the previously cached ramps and change the tray icon
      to reflect this.
    - MINOR Profile loader (Windows): Ignore potential stray
      WM_COMMAND messages caused by 3rd party application
      interference.
    - MINOR Bump minimum required wxPython version to 3.0 (fixes a
      compatibility problem under Linux if wxPython 2.8 was
      installed).
    - COSMETIC Refresh output levels control when loading settings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 01 16:11:48 UTC 2017 - florian_at_displaycal.net

- Update to 3.3.0.0:
  * Better multi CPU/multi core support. Generating high
    resolution PCS-to-device tables is now taking more advantage
    of multiple (physical or logical) processors (typical 2x
    speedup on a i7-6700K CPU).
  * Generating a simple high resolution perceptual table is now
    done by copying the colorimetric table and only generating
    new input curves. This markedly reduces the processing time
    needed to create the perceptual table (6x speedup on a
    i7-6700K CPU).
