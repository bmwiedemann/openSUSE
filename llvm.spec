%description
LLVM is a compiler infrastructure designed for compile-time,
link-time, runtime, and idle-time optimization of programs from
arbitrary programming languages.

The compiler infrastructure includes mirror sets of programming
tools as well as libraries with equivalent functionality.

This package is a dummy package that depends on the version of
llvm that openSUSE currently supports.  Packages that
don't require a specific LLVM version should depend on this.

Requires:       llvm%{_sonum}-polly = %{version}
%obsolete_llvm_versioned llvm polly

%description polly
Polly is a high-level loop and data-locality optimizer and optimization
infrastructure for LLVM. It uses an abstract mathematical representation based
on integer polyhedra to analyze and optimize the memory access pattern of a
program. Polly can currently perform classical loop transformations, especially
tiling and loop fusion to improve data-locality. It can also exploit OpenMP
level parallelism and expose SIMDization opportunities.

This package is a dummy package that depends on the version of
llvm-polly that openSUSE currently supports.  Packages that
don't require a specific LLVM version should depend on this.
