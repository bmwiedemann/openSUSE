     - Switched to Dist::Zilla. The Module::Install Makefile.PL was resulting
       in dependency problems and CPAN Testers fails, and I'm not familiar with
       it. Easier to switch. Thanks to ZEFRAM for pointing out the problem.

     - Test::More and Time::Duration were listed as build_requires;
       changed them to test_requires, with versions. Wonder if this was
       the cause of the small number of CPAN Testers fails?
     - Added more more modules to the SEE ALSO section in the pod.
