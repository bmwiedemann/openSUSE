      - SUPPORTED PERL VERSIONS: Starting with this release, PDF::API2 will
        support major Perl versions released in the past six years, plus the major
        release before that one.  This should provide backward compatibility for
        the life of most LTS server distributions, while eliminating the need to
        troubleshoot warnings and bugs that only show up in increasingly-ancient
        versions of Perl.
  
        For this release, it means that the minimum supported Perl is 5.18, which
        was first released on 2013-05-18.
  
      - Add support for cross-reference streams using 64-bit field widths.
  
      - When the utf8 flag is set for a PDF string, automatically encode it as
        UCS-16BE instead of requiring a separate flag to be set in the PDF object.
        This resolves [RT #33497] and [RT #117031] in addition to making the code
        easier to maintain.
  
      - [RT #126274] Fix alignment when using UniFont with text_center or
        text_right when all characters are in the same block.
  
      - [RT #121911] Fix adding pages to a document structure with nested Pages
        elements.  This included a fairly substantial rewrite of the relevant
        code, so please report any new bugs related to adding pages (report and
        troubleshooting by Vadim Repin).
  
      - Renamed pdfile() to pdf_file() in PDF::API2::Annotation and
        PDF::API2::Outline.  The old name continues to work, but is deprecated.

      - [RT #122371] Remove a couple of improperly-placed weaken statements
        (reported by Phil Perry).
  
      - [RT #122372] Fix weakening when a page is added to the end of a multiple
        page document (reported by Phil Perry).
  
      - Fix Bank Gothic core font (reported by Phil Perry).

  2.032     2017-07-02
  
      - PDF::API2 has many circular references, and the end() method
        doesn't clear them all, so memory is leaked.  This release uses
        Scalar::Util's weaken() function to improve garbage collection.
        A significant number of circular references have been weakened,
        though many likely still remain.
  
      - [RT #120756] Eliminate a warning for an ambiguous call to
        CORE::open (first reported by Abdelbaki Brahmia).
  
      - $text->text_justified() and $text->text_fill_justified() now
        adjust the space between words rather than stretching individual
        characters in order to get the text to fit.
  
      - [RT #120397] Indirect references and indirect objects can have
        comments embedded in their whitespace, and their object number
        and generation may be split across multiple lines, which may not
        all be buffered (reported by SPROUT).
  
      - [RT #120450] Fix PDF::API2->open($filename)->stringify()
        (reported by SPROUT).
  
      - Fix an off-by-one error when calculating text width while
        charspace is non-zero.
  
      - [RT #120048] Fix PDF::API2->synfont() (broken in 2.029, fixed by Vadim
        Repin) and add basic testing.

   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-PDF-API2/Changes

  2.031     2017-01-26
  
      - Fix use of cache files when reading streams: temp files will now
        be used any time a stream is larger than 16MB (by default).
        Formerly, due to a bug, they would only be created when a 4kB
        chunk of a stream increased to 16kB or more after being
        decompressed.
  
      - Numbers, booleans, and null values can now be read from object
        streams.
  
      - Update to [RT #113290]: Objects inside a large object stream are
        now read without loading the entire object stream into memory.
  
      - DEPRECATION: The low-level new_api methods have been deprecated
        in favor of calling new directly.  If your code uses
        new_api($api2, ...), replace it with new($api2->{'pdf'}, ...).
  
      - [RT #118352] Don't crash when adding an annotation to a page
        that has an existing annotations array stored as an indirect
        object (reported by Johan Vromans).
  
      - [RT #118717] Die with an informative error if a file can't be
        opened during open() or saveas() (reported by Johan Vromans).

      - [RT #113293] Files with cross-reference streams weren't
        correctly setting the max object number (report and
        troubleshooting by Marco Pessotto).
  
      - Handle TIFF images with strips that are wider than the image
        (report and patch by Jeffrey Ratcliffe).
  
      - [RT #98574] Increase test coverage of PDF::API2::Content (tests
        by Phil Perry).
  
      - A bunch of code cleanup and documentation updates by Paul
        Cochrane.
  
      - Add a missing prereq on Win32 systems (patch by Michiel Beijen).
  
      - [RT #113514, #98552] Fix the dash() and renderingintent()
        methods in ExtGState (reported by Vadim Repin and Phil Perry).
  
      - Satisfy all Perl::Critic severity 5 policies.
  
      - [RT #117940] Allow PNG, GIF, and PNM files to be opened from
        filehandles in addition to filenames (patch by Johan Vromans).
  
      - [RT #33970] Fail fast when a referenced file can't be opened
        (requested by Barrie Slaymaker a mere 8.5 years ago).
  
      - Add -simplex, -duplexfliplongedge and -duplexflipshortedge as
        options to $pdf->preferences() (requested by Doug Poulin).

      - This release contains seven fixes for parsing PDFs.  They mostly
        affect files using cross-reference streams, which were first
        supported in the previous release.  Thanks to Marco Pessotto and
        Stuart Henderson for their help identifying and troubleshooting
        bugs.
  
      - Added contrib/pdf-debug.pl to help track down issues related to
        opening and parsing PDFs.

      - [RT #48683] Add support for PDFs with cross-reference streams
        and object streams (patch by Don Huettl of Grant Street Group).
  
      - [RT #107333] Accept an empty string as a valid Name, per PDF
        spec 1.7 section 7.3.5 (patch by Mark Balitsky).
  
      - [RT #98551] Rename aliases 2A, 4A, 2B, and 4B to 2A0, 4A0, 2B0,
        and 4B0.  The old names will continue to work, but are now
        undocumented (patch by Phil Perry).
  
      - Add -mils and -color as options for barcodes.  Reset linedash so
        that barcodes are always solid lines (patch by Erelen).
  
      - [RT #98549] Rename meterlimit to miterlimit (patch by Phil
        Perry).
  
      - [RT #98534] Rename hspace to hscale (patch by Phil Perry).
  
      - Fixed an infinite loop when RunLengthDecode is used for output.
  
      - [RT #65582] Fix embedding of OpenType fonts (fix by Simon Cozens).
  
      - [RT #67767] Allow an empty page to be imported into a PDF using
        importPageIntoForm (reported by Antti Lankila).
  
      - [RT #66341] Various fixes for ASCII85Decode and LZWDecode.

      - The previous release included a patch that broke compatibility
        with Perl 5.8.x.  The minimum supported version is now Perl
        5.8.5, and there is a .perl-version file to facilitate testing
        using plenv.

      - [RT #104133] Include all bounding boxes when importing a page
        (patch by Don Huettl of Grant Street Group).
  
      - [RT #104133] When retrieving bounding boxes for a page, fall
        back according to the defaults listed in the PDF spec (patch by
        Don Huettl of Grant Street Group).
  
      - Barcodes now take an optional -caption argument that will be
        printed beneath the barcode.  This can replace or be used in
        conjunction with the text representation of the barcode
        (requested by Gareth Tunley).
  
      - [RT #105581] Calls to width() in BaseFont are now significantly
        faster (patch by Dmitri Tikhonov).

      - The fix for [RT #69503] broke a previously-working case where a
        page object could be passed (and was expected).  The -firstpage
        option now accepts a page object or a page number.  Thanks to
        Marco Pessotto for the bug report and test.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 25 09:32:42 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.022
     - Added $pdf->version() get/set method.  When opening an existing
       PDF, the existing version number will now be retained.
 
     - Renamed the following in PDF::API2:
         - importpage to import_page
         - openScalar to open_scalar
 
       The old names are deprecated.
 
     - [RT #69503] Fix the -firstpage option to $pdf->preferences() so
       that it doesn't always lead to a crash (reported by Dietrich
       Streifert).
 
     - [RT #47974] Accept malformed xref subsections (with a warning)
       that have extraneous spaces on the first line (reported by
       Abhinav Kaushik).
 
     - [RT #94505] For Code128 barcodes, the initial character set is
       now optional (defaults to B or C depending on the content to be
       encoded).  The initial character set can be passed as a capital
       letter, and the program will die if an invalid character set is
       requested (requested by Andrea Nall).
 
     - Interleaved 2 of 5 barcodes now prepend a zero when an odd
       number of digits is specified, which is standard behavior.
       Previously, a zero was appended instead.
 
     - $page->rotate(0) now sets rotation to 0 degrees rather than
       deleting an existing page rotation command.  Page rotation is
       inherited, so this is necessary to undo any inherited page
       rotation.
 
     - Fix: Attempts to use EAN-128 barcodes resulted in an error.
 
     - Add a more informative error when text() is called without first
       setting a font(), and when font() is called without including a
       font size.
- remove work around only applied on 11.3 and 11.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 17 13:13:14 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.021
    - Fixed numerous bugs in the string parsing code, including the
      one reported in [RT #63918] by Frank Doepper.

    - [RT #41049] Rewrote literal string parsing to prevent a stack
      overflow due to an inefficient regex (reported by Sergei
      Fetisov).

    - [RT #91822] Fix compression of GIF images to ensure that output
      codes don't exceed 12 bits (reported by Vadim Repin).

    - The RunLengthDecode filter didn't actually work.  Its code has
      been rewritten and now passes basic encoding and decoding tests.

    - Fix Code128 barcode switching from Code C to Code B in certain
      cases (reported by Doru Petrescu).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  1 11:42:07 UTC 2013 - chris@computersalat.de

- update to 2.020
  * Give a more informative error message when a PDF file using a
    cross-reference stream is encountered.  The Known Issues section
    of the documentation includes pointers on how to add support in
    case someone else can get to this before I do.
  * Text using TrueType fonts is now searchable again.  In version
    0.61, an undocumented -unicodemap option was added to nearly all
    of the font resource methods, which only included a ToUnicode
    CMap if it was set (and it's required in order for PDF readers
    to be able to identify individual characters if BaseEncoding
    isn't present, which it isn't for TrueType fonts).

    I've left the -unicodemap option in place, and it's still
    undocumented (except here), but it's now on by default.  Call
    $pdf->ttfont($fontfile, -unicodemap => 0) if you want to disable
    it for performance or file size reasons.
  * Add a note to the stringify method's documentation saying that
    it's a destructive operation.
  * The various filter types have their own classes in the
    PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::Filter namespace now, rather than having
    all of the packages in Filter.pm.
  * To facilitate testing and ensure that identically-generated PDFs
    have identical output in Perl 5.17.5 or later, PDF dictionary
    keys are now sorted during output.

- update to 2.019
    - [RT #66167] Fix a typo in the require statement for code128
      barcodes (TC Kuan).

    - Numerous modules are now only loaded when they're needed, which
      should help speed up the load time and reduce the memory
      footprint.

    - Test coverage is up to about 45% of the codebase.

    - The tests in 2.017 exposed a floating point issue where some
      computers give more trailing zeros than others.  It doesn't
      affect the output, but it does break the tests on those
      computers, since the PDFs are slightly different.  This version
      modifies the float() method to remove trailing zeros, which
      should fix the test breakage and give consistent PDFs.

    - The DejaVu fonts have been removed from the distribution, since
      they were only used by one example script.  If you need them for
      your project, you can download them from http://dejavu-fonts.org
