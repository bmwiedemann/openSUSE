- Update to version 0.6.8
  * Upgrade CBMC proof tools: starter kit and Litani 1.10.0 (#826)
    + Upgrade proof tool submodules
      This commit advances Litani to release 1.10.0, and the starter kit to
      the tip-of-tree. This brings the following improvements:
      - Profiling
          - Litani measures the memory usage of the CBMC safety checking and
            coverage checking jobs
          - The dashboard includes box-and-whisker diagrams for memory use per
            proof
          - The dashboard includes a graph of how many parallel jobs are
            running over the whole run, making it easy to choose a CI machine
            with enough parallelism
          - It is now possible to designate particular proofs as "EXPENSIVE";
            Litani runs expensive proofs serially, ensuring that they do not
            over-consume resources like RAM.
      - UI improvements
          - Each pipeline page includes a table of contents
          - Each pipeline page includes a dependency graph of the pipeline
          - Each job on the pipeline page has a hyperlink to that job
          - The terminal output is now less noisy
    + Change cbmc-batch.yaml to cbmc-proof.txt
      This makes the proof layout consistent with the starter kit, which will
      allow us to use a generic run script in a future commit. Putting this
      in commit by itself because the diff is huge and not worth reading (just
      moving some files and changing two lines in the runscript).
    + Symlink run-cbmc-proofs.py to starter kit
      The run script is now a symbolic link into the starter kit submodule,
      meaning that it will be updated whenever the starter kit is. This is
      done iso that AWS C Common doesn't carry custom modifications to the run script
      unless necessary; previous commits have made the AWS C Common proofs consistent
      with the generic starter kit conventions.
