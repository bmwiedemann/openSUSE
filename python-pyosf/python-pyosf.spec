%description
The pyosf package is a pure Python library for file sync with
Open Science Framework.

This package is for synchronisation of files from the local
file space to the Open Science Framework (OSF). There is a more
complex sync package by the Center for Open Science,
who created OSF, called osf-sync.

The OSF official package is designed for continuous automated
synchronisation of many projects (Ã  la Dropbox). The authors of pyosf
needed something simpler (for combination with PsychoPy). The pyosf
package performs basic search/login/sync operations with single
projects on OSF, but only when instructed to do so (no continuous
sync).
