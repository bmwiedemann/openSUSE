  - Re-release to fix the generated Makefile.PL. We do not want to try to build
    the XS code with compiler warnings enabled except on Perl 5.24+. There are
    unavoidable warnings with older Perls. If you tried to install this distro
    in an environment where AUTHOR_TESTING was set, these warnings would be
    enabled, along with "-Werror", causing the build to fail
    completely. Reported by Olaf Alders. GH #3.

  - Fix C compiler warnings. Reported by Jim Keenan. GH #2.

  - The one() sub returned true when given an empty list, but it should return
    false. Reported by randyl. GH #3.

  - Skip all the tests unless List::SomeUtils 0.56 is installed. This fixes the
    issue where trying to install the new List::SomeUtils ends up pulling this
    distribution, which then fails because an older LSU is installed but doesn't
    export mode(). Reported by John SJ Anderson. GH #1.
