- version update to 1.4
  + Logic expressions with relations can now be simplifed in a
    better way which has impact on e.g. simplification of
    piecewise expressions
  + The MathML Presentation printer has seen a major improvement
    with support configuration and about a hundred new functions.
  + Union and Intersection have been improved to, among other
    improvements, support Python sets.
  + The test procedure has been changed to include code coverage
    and code quality checks leading to a number of issues being
    identified and removed.
  + Unicode support, especially for Python 2.7, has been improved.
  + subs and Subs have been improved in a number of ways.
  + SymPy objects now renders as LaTeX automatically in Jupyter
    notebooks. init_printing is still required to LaTeX render
    non-SymPy objects such as lists of expressions or Python ints

  * Highlights
    + Python 3.3 is no longer supported. If you require Python 3.3

      major Python versions.
    + Experimental LaTeX parsing with

      latex2sympy project. This requires antlr-python-runtime to be
      installed. #13706
    + The vector module has been improved to support orthogonal
      curvilinear coordinate systems (Szymon Mieszczak's GSoC project)
    + New module sympy.integrals.intpoly for integrating uni/bivariate
      polynomials over 2-polytopes. (Arif Ahmed's GSoC project)
    + Improvements to the code generation module. (Björn Dahlgren's
      GSoC project)
    + Improvements to the group theory module. See below for more
      information. (Valeriia Gladkova's GSoC project)
    + New module sympy.discrete for operating on discrete
      sequences. (Sidhant Nagpal's GSoC project)

-  update to version 0.7.5

  Major changes:
  * The version of mpmath included in SymPy has been updated to 0.18.
  * New routines for efficiently compute the dispersion of a polynomial or a pair thereof.
  * Fancy indexing of matrices is now provided, e.g. A[:, [1, 2, 5]] selects all rows and only 3 columns.

  * Enumeration of multiset partitions is now based on an
    implementation of Algorithm 7.1.2.5M from Knuth's The Art of
    Computer Programming. The new version is much faster, and includes
    fast methods for enumerating only those partitions with a
    restricted range of sizes, and counting multiset partitions. (See
    the new file sympy.utilities.enumerative.py.)
  * distance methods were added to Line and Ray to compute the shortest distance to them from a point.
  * The normal_lines method was added to Ellipse to compute the lines from a point that strike the Ellipse at a normal angle.
  * inv_quick and det_quick were added as functions in solvers.py to
    facilitate fast solution of small symbolic matrices; their use in
    solve has reduced greatly the time needed to solve such systems.
  * solve_univariate_inequality has been added to sympy.solvers.inequalities.py.
  * as_set attribute for Relationals and Booleans has been added.
  * Several classes and functions strictly associated with vector
    calculus were moved from sympy.physics.mechanics to a new package
    sympy.physics.vector. (PRs #2732 #2862 #2894)
  * New implementation of the Airy functions Ai and Bi and their
    derivatives Ai' and Bi' (called airyai, airybi, airyaiprime and
    airybiprime, respectively). Most of the usual features of SymPy
    special function are present. Notable exceptions are Gruntz limit
    computation helpers and meijerg special functions integration
    code.
  * Euler-Lagrange equations (function euler_equations) in a new package sympy.calculus (PR #2431).

  Minor changes:
  * Some improvements to the gamma function.
  * generate_bell now generates correct permutations for any number of elements.
  * It is no longer necessary to provide nargs to objects subclassed
    from Function unless an eval class method is not defined. (If eval
    is defined, the number of arguments will be inferred from its
    signature.)
  * geometric Point creation will be faster since simplification is done only on Floats
  * Some improvements to the intersection method of the Ellipse.
  * solutions from solve of equations involving multiple log terms are more robust
  * idiff can now return higher order derivatives
  * Added to_matrix() method to sympy.physics.vector.Vector and
    sympy.physics.dyadic.Dyadic. (PR #2686).
  * Printing improvements for sympy.physics.vector objects and
    mechanics printing. (PRs #2687, #2728, #2772, #2862, #2894)
  * Functions with LaTeX symbols now print correct LaTeX. (PR #2772)
  * init_printing has several new options, including a flag
    print_builtin to prevent SymPy printing of basic Python types (PR
    #2683), and flags to let you supply custom printers (PR #2894).
  * improvements in evaluation of imageset for Intervals (PR #2723).
  * Set properties to determine boundary and interior (PR #2744).
  * input to a function created by lambdify no longer needs to be flattened.

  Backwards compatibility breaks and deprecations:
  * the submatrix method of matrices was removed; access the
    functionality by providing slices or list of rows/columns to
    matrix directly, e.g. A[:, [1, 2]].
  * Matrix([]) and Matrix([[]]) now both return a 0x0 matrix
  * terms_gcd no longer removes a -1.0 from expressions
  * extract_multiplicatively will not remove a negative Number from a
    positive one, so (4*x*y).extract_multiplicatively(-2*x) will
    return None.
  * the shape of the result from M.cross(B) now has the same shape as matrix M.
  * The factorial of negative numbers is now zoo instead of 0. This is
    consistent with the definition factorial(n) = gamma(n + 1).
  * 1/0 returns zoo, not oo (PR #2813).
  * zoo.is_number is True (PR #2823).
  * oo < I raises TypeError, just as for finite numbers (PR #2734).
  * 1**oo == nan instead of 1, better documentation for Pow class (PR #2606).
