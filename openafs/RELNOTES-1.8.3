                       User-Visible OpenAFS Changes

OpenAFS 1.8.3

  All platforms

    * Improved diagnostics and error messages (13186 13411 13417)

    * Avoid sending RX packets with random garbage in the userStatus field
      (13332)

    * Fixed detection of the RX initialization status (13416)

    * Assorted fixes to avoid segmentation faults and other potential problems
      by detecting internal errors rather than letting them go unnoticed
      (13329 13372)

  All server platforms

    * Fixed a build problem accidentally introduced in release 1.8.2 (13328)

    * Assorted efficiency improvements in the ubik implementation (13153 13218
      13188 13353)

    * Fixed locking around transaction list processing in volserver to avoid
      segmentation faults and other potential problems (13336 13337)

    * When the volserver attempts to remove a temporary volume after a
      transaction, but the volume was already removed, e.g., by the salvager,
      this is no longer treated as an error (13235)

  All client platforms

    * Update the CellServDB to the latest version from grand.central.org from
      May 14th 2018 (13409)

    * Avoid a panic during cache initialization when allocating the required
      memory fails (13307)

    * Add back the packet counters and timestamps to "vos status" output
      which had been missing since release 1.8.0 (13421)

    * Correctly handle errors encountered while reading data from the server
      and writing it to the cache, e.g., due to a full cache partition (13443)

    * Avoid a panic due to a recoverable error while flushing cache items
      (13503)

  Linux clients

    * Support mainline kernels 4.20 and 5.0 and distribution kernels with
      backports from those (13405 13406 13440 13441 13442)

    * DKMS-related fixes in Red Hat packaging (13438 13479)

  macOS

    * Support building and packaging on macOS 10.14 "Mojave" (13412 13413)
