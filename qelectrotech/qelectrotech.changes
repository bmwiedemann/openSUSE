- Update to version 0.61
  * Backport HiDPI fix.
  * Backport commit 5284 : Fix bug N° 157.
  * Backport commit 5307 : Function for search conductor at the
    same potential.
    When the search function is searching in a terminal element,
    they search only for the first terminal found, no matter if the
    terminal element have more than two terminals.
    So the list of conductors at the same potential is missing
    some conductors.
    This commit fix it, now the search function search for every
    terminals of a terminal element
  * Backport commit 5311, 5312 : elements connections change
    propertie to terminal, fixed by commit svn 5307
  * GCC 8.1 fix

 - Update to version 0.5
* Port to Qt 5 framework
* New QSettings native format for config files.
* In the diagram editor, the grid is not displayed by default 
  outside the diagram, the minimum zoom is blocked. 
   A button allows you to un-validate this operation.
* It is now possible to put the tittle block on the right vertical mode.
* The default tittle block can be defined for the next folios of the project.
* The summary now takes the font set in the QElectroTech.conf
* The floating dock is now operational, variables, actions are taken 
  into account on the fly.
* A transformation tool transforms quickly and finely each primitive by handles.
* Add UUID tag for element XML.
* The database enables faster loading a large number of managing symbols
  in tables changes pixmaps collections, it no longer compares the modification 
  date of the files but their use UUID attributes to update the cache .
* In terms of basic shapes, the transform tool works directly on vectors, 
  it replaces the reduction tool / enlargement that has just been deleted as unnecessary.
* Improve Undo command by QPropertyUndoCommand class.
