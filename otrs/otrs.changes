Fri Feb 22 07:29:57 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Drop use of $FIRST_ARG in .spec

  The use of $FIRST_ARG was probably required because of the
  %service_* rpm macros were playing tricks with the shell positional
  parameters. This is bad practice and error prones so let's assume
  that no macros should do that anymore and hence it's safe to assume
  that positional parameters remains unchanged after any rpm macro
  call.

- add otrs-httpd_conf-apache2_4.patch to fix httpd.conf for apache 2.4
  * Apache2 on OpenSuSE v.13.1 has the mod_access_compat.c module
    statically compiled into the Apache2 core. This means it can't
    be unloaded and the older pre-2.4 access directives must be 
    used. Since it is not advised to mix pre and post 2.4 access
    methods the configuration file had to be modified to look for 
    this static module and load pre-2.4 directives if found on 
    Apache 2.4. It should be forward compatible if the mod_access
    compat.c module become dynamic in the future and is not loaded.
