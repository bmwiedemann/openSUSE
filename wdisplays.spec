wdisplays is a graphical application for configuring displays in
Wayland compositors. It requires a compositor with the
wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 protocol, e.g. sway.
This program can perform adjustment of display settings in
kiosks, digital signage, and other elaborate multi-monitor setups.
