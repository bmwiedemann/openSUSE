- Update to 1.9.2:
  * FIX: Shortcut last descendant calculation if possible for performance.
  * FIX: Fix issue where Doctype strings can be mistaken for a normal text node in some cases.
  * FIX: A top level tag is not a :root tag if it has sibling text nodes or tag nodes. This is an issue that mostly manifests when using html.parser as the parser will allow multiple root nodes.

- version update to 1.9.1
  - FIX: `:root`, `:contains()`, `:default`, `:indeterminate`, 
    `:lang()`, and `:dir()` will properly account for HTML
    `iframe` elements in their logic when selecting or matching
     an element. Their logic will be restricted to the document
     for which the element under consideration applies.
  - FIX: HTML pseudo-classes will check that all key elements
    checked are in the XHTML namespace (HTML parsers that do
    not provide namespaces will assume the XHTML namespace).
  - FIX: Ensure that all pseudo-class names are case
    insensitive and allow CSS escapes.

Fri Apr  5 08:26:37 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.9
  * NEW: Allow :contains() to accept a list of text to search 
    for. (#115)
  * NEW: Add new escape function for escaping CSS identifiers. (#125)
  * NEW: Deprecate comments and icomments functions in the API to ensure
    Soup Sieve focuses only in CSS selectors. comments and icomments
    will most likely be removed in 2.0. (#130)
  * NEW: Add Python 3.8 support. (#133)
  * FIX: Don't install test files when installing the soupsieve
    package. (#111)
  * FIX: Improve efficiency of :contains() comparison.
  * FIX: Null characters should translate to the Unicode REPLACEMENT
    CHARACTER (U+FFFD) according to the specification. This applies
    to CSS escaped NULL characters as well. (#124)
  * FIX: Escaped EOF should translate to U+FFFD outside of CSS strings.
    In a string, they should just be ignored, but as there is no case
    where we could resolve such a string and still have a valid selector,
    string handling remains the same. (#128)
