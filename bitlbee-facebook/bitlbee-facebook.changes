- Version bump 1.1.1
  Fixes one last issue to the server side changes from last week.
  - Send orca-formatted user agent for all HTTP requests too. Fixes "Failed
    to parse thread information" errors when joining channels.
  This is in addition to the connection error fixes mentioned in the previous
  release. Quoting from the previous release: "Fix connection errors after
  facebook discontinued support for old versions of facebook messenger for
  android. While most of the protocol implementation was already above that
  version, there was a subtle change that broke fetching of sync_sequence_id,
  and the previously empty MQTT user agent string is now considered an old
  version too (#138)"
  I waited a few days before releasing this to ensure things calm down,
  hopefully it continues like this.
- Version 1.1.0
  Long overdue release, with a year worth of changes. This is now the minimum
  required version.
  - Fix connection errors after facebook discontinued support for old versions
    of facebook messenger for android. While most of the protocol
    implementation was already above that version, there was a subtle change
    that broke fetching of sync_sequence_id, and the previously empty MQTT user
    agent string is now considered an old version too (#138)
  - Fix receiving topic/groupchat membership events (#119)
  - Fix creating channels, inviting, kicking members (#120)
  - Fix setting channel topics (#121)
  - Fix contacts pagination for accounts with more than 500 friends (#74)
  - Fix chats with only two members including self, like the Marketplace ones
  - Fix crash on some kinds of SSL connection failure (#82)
  - Fix crash when glib is compiled with G_ENABLE_DEBUG
  - Deduplicate echoes of sent messages (#76)
  - Set a non-empty HTTP user agent for api/graphql queries, since the empty
    user agent often gets flagged for suspicious activity (#108)
  - Prevent disconnections due to contacts with incomplete profiles (#89)
  - Prevent disconnections on invalid attachment errors (#73)
  - Prevent disconnections when trying to join a chat after being kicked (#244)
  - Use FetchContactsDeltaQuery to incrementally sync contacts. Uses less
    traffic, can be done more often and fixes issues with non-friends (#116)
  - Parse URL attachments generated by the android share feature (#97)
  - Add mark_read_reply setting to only mark messages as read on reply (#69)
  - Add support for the bitlbee 3.5 plugin information API (bitlbee 3.4 is
    still supported by this version, but will be dropped in the next one)
  - Improve url comparison to avoid showing urls twice on attachments
