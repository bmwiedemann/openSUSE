It's Dangerous
   ... so better sign this

Various helpers to pass data to untrusted environments and to get it back
safe and sound.

This repository provides a module that is a port of the django signing
module.  It's not directly copied but some changes were applied to
make it work better on its own.

Also I plan to add some extra things.  Work in progress.
