Thu Jun 13 04:25:05 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.9.1:
  * Filtering out the linux-drm-syncobj-v1 protocol, which uses a
    file descriptor type for Waypipe currently does not support.
  * Not aborting/producing a core dump on receipt of a second
    SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signal: this was too easy to trigger
    accidentally. SIGQUIT (Ctrl+\) already exists for this purpose

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:52:43 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.0:
  * enables LZ4 compression by default. This may lead to "Lz4
    decompression failed" errors when connecting a pre-v0.8.2
    waypipe server instance to a v0.9.0 waypipe client. Explicitly
    passing the --compress lz4 flag to waypipe ssh should fix this,
    by ensuring that both ends of the connection try the same
    compression type.
  * --title-prefix flag, which lets Waypipe prepend strings to
    window titles
  * adds the --vsock flag, to permit connections through AF_VSOCK
  * adds support for AV1 video encoding/decoding via --video=av1

Sat Feb 12 09:08:53 UTC 2022 - Arnav Singh <opensuse@arnavion.dev>

- Update to version 0.8.2
  * Print useful error messages when connecting waypipe instances
    with incompatible command line options.
- Update to version 0.8.1
  * Improved performance by reducing executable size, and memory
    usage on networks with high bandwidth and latency.
  * Fixed an issue running OpenGL programs with the compositor
    Mutter in some cases.
  * Fixed a bug in which Waypipe failed to read certain readonly
    file descriptors.
- Update to version 0.8.0
  * Added support for video encoding with VP9.
  * Command line interface changes:
  * `--video` now takes an optional list of arguments specifying
    video encoding properties. For example, the argument list
    `--video=hw,vp9,bpf=5e5` provides hardware video encoding as
    VP9 with a higher bit rate than usual.
  * `--hwvideo` is deprecated in favor of writing `--video=hw`.
  * The short option `-v` has been removed; use the longer form
    `--version` instead.
  * `waypipe ssh` now calls whatever ssh executable is in $PATH,
    instead of `/usr/bin/ssh`

Sat Feb 20 02:32:52 PM CET 2021 - Florian <sp1ritCS@protonmail.com>

- Update to version 0.7.2
  * Fixed a crash when using DMABUFs with the nouveau driver
  * Eliminated two file descriptor leaks in the main server process
  * Fixed a bug with damage tracking
  * Added support for read-only file descriptors, fixing a bug with
    recent wl_keyboard protocol versions
  * Slightly expanded man page documentation
  * Some setup work to support setting video encoding parameters in
    future versions of Waypipe
- version 0.7.1
  * Fixes a crash with large (e.g, 2500x2000 pixel) windows
  * Fixes a crash with video encoding and some ffmpeg versions (bd702a58)
  * Protocol support has been added for wlr-gamma-control-v1 and
    primary-selection-unstable-v1.
  * Keyboard keymap file descriptors are now cleaned up more
    quickly.
- version 0.7.0
  * Numerous bugfixes
  * This release is not compatible with earlier versions of
    Waypipe, due to changes in the wire protocol (slightly better
    file descriptor tracking, and a new connection method.)
  * There is a new --remote-bin option for the waypipe ssh mode
    which can be used to choose the binary run on the remote
    (application side) system, rather than looking only for
    "waypipe" in $PATH.
