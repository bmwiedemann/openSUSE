%description
The Octave-Forge Doctest package finds specially-formatted blocks of example
code within documentation files. It then executes the code and confirms
the output is correct. This can be useful as part of a testing framework
or simply to ensure that documentation stays up-to-date during software development.
This is part of Octave-Forge project.
