- Update to 2.27.0:
  * Fix crash when you remove a line starting with "--" and passed
    the diff to riff, riff would crash #51
    As a side effect, riff will now be pickier with its input. If
    you modify your diffs manually, beware.

- Update to 2.26.0:
  * Add -f flag for specifying a diff file to highlight
  * With this release there are two ways of highlighting a particular
    diff file:
    + riff < file.diff
    + riff --file=file.diff
  * Command line parsing has been updated to use Clap, which will
    make help output look somewhat different. Should also fix some
    options parsing corner cases.
