- Update to 2.26.0:

  * Add -f flag for specifying a diff file to highlight
  * With this release there are two ways of highlighting a particular
    diff file:
    + riff < file.diff
    + riff --file=file.diff
  * Command line parsing has been updated to use Clap, which will
    make help output look somewhat different. Should also fix some
    options parsing corner cases.
