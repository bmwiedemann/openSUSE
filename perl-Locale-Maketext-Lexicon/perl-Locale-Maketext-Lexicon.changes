      contain trailing spaces

Mon Sep 18 04:41:55 CEST 2006 - lmuelle@suse.de

- Update to version 0.62.
  * For the longest time, direct import of Locale::Maketext::Lexicon
    from within localization classes (such as MyApp::I18N::zh_tw) was
    untested and broken.  It now works the way described in the SYNOPSIS
    section of the Locale::Maketext::Lexicon documentation.
    Contributed by: Yann Kerherve
  * LICENSING CHANGE: This compilation and all individual files in it
    are now under the permissive "MIT" license.  See the COPYRIGHT
    section in README for the new terms.
  * Repair Perl 5.005 compatibility in the build system.
    Reported By: Rong-En Fan
  * Locale::Maketext::Extract: Bump version to 0.20.
    No functionality changes to Locale::Maketext::Lexicon; all changes
    in this release are to Locale::Maketext::Extract.
  * The ->compile call now moves ->entries into ->compiled_entries,
    instead of mutating them in-place.  This allows repeated cycles
    of ->extract/->compile calls before the final ->write_po.
  * Consequently, in the ->read_po/->write_po API, the "$verbatim" flag
    is now ignored.
  * ->read_po no longer fails on empty PO files.
  * The return values of ->msgids/->msgstr are now always in gettext
    style and never in maketext style.
  * In xgettext.pl, the -u flag (specifies the style of the source
    programs as gettext instead of the default maketext) now has nothing
    to do with output escaping.  This closes another long-standing
    bug of "vanishing backslashes" when the same .po file is written
    once with -u and once without.
  * The --unescaped flag to "xgettext.pl" is deprecated and renamed
    to the more appropriate "--use-gettext-style".
  * Locale::Maketext::Extract::Run now accepts single-letter directory
    names instead of erroneously stripping them out.
  * Locale::Maketext::Extract: Direct calls to ->write_po now
    escapes the msg strings by default (reverting to <=0.54
    behaviour), but calls via xgettext.pl (and ::Extract::Run)
    now always specify the "verbatim" flag to ->write_po, so
    users of extraction tools are still free from double escaping.
    Requested by: Thierry Vignaud
  * Locale::Maketext::Extract: Allow the "# loc" marker at the
    end of a statement:
      say "foo"; # loc
    previously it only worked on closing brackets and commas.
  * Locale::Maketext::Lexicon: The "gettext" style no longer parses
    "%0" as a variable.  Also allows spaces between function arguments:
      %quant(%1, %2)
  * Locale::Maketext::Locale: The "_style => 'gettext'" option was
    broken for function forms such as "%quant(%1)", as well as
    adjacent variables such as "%1%2%3".
  * Locale::Maketext::Lexicon: Specifying the new "_auto => 1" option
    now turns on _AUTO fallback handling for all language handles.
    Requested by: Jesse Vincent
  * Locale::Maketext::Lexicon: Specifying the new "_style => 'gettext'"
    option makes "%1" and "%quant(%1)" to be used for interpolation,
    instead of "[_1]" and "[quant,_1]".
  * Locale::Maketext::Extract: Fix a long-standing bug that caused
    double-escaping of backslashes and double quotes in loc strings.
    Contributed by: Brian Cassidy
  * When importing into an already defined lexicon and merging with its
    entries, we need to clear the Locale::Maketext cache, otherwise
    _AUTO entries generated by the old lexicon will linger around.
