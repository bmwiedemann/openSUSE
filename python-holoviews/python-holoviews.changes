      labels and values (PR #376).
- update to version 1.4.0:
  * Major new features:
    + Data API: The new data API brings an extensible system of to add
      new data interfaces to column based Element types. These
      interfaces allow applying powerful operations on the data
      independently of the data format. The currently supported
      datatypes include NumPy, pandas dataframes and a simple
      dictionary format. (PR #284)
    + Backend API: In this release we completely refactored the
      rendering, plotting and IPython display system to make it easy to
      add new plotting backends. Data may be styled and pickled for each
      backend independently and renderers now support exporting all
      plotting data including widgets as standalone HTML files or with
      separate JSON data.
    + Bokeh backend: The first new plotting backend added via the new
      backend API. Bokeh plots allow for much faster plotting and
      greater interactivity. Supports most Element types and layouts and
      provides facilities for sharing axes across plots and linked
      brushing across plots. (PR #250)
    + DynamicMap: The new DynamicMap class allows HoloMap data to be
      generated on-the-fly while running a Jupyter IPython notebook
      kernel. Allows visualization of unbounded data streams and smooth
      exploration of large continuous parameter spaces. (PR #278)
  * Other features:
    + Easy definition of custom aliases for group, label and Dimension
      names, allowing easier use of LaTeX.
    + New Trisurface and QuadMesh elements.
    + Widgets now allow expressing hierarchical relationships between
      dimensions.
    + Added GridMatrix container for heterogeneous Elements and
      gridmatrix operation to generate scatter matrix showing
      relationship between dimensions.
    + Filled contour regions can now be generated using the contours
      operation.
    + Consistent indexing semantics for all Elements and support for
      boolean indexing for Columns and NdMapping types.
    + New hv.notebook_extension function offers a more flexible
      alternative to %load_ext, e.g. for loading other extensions
      hv.notebook_extension(bokeh=True).
  * Experimental features:
    + Bokeh callbacks allow adding interactivity by communicating
      between bokehJS tools and the IPython kernel, e.g. allowing
      downsampling based on the zoom level.
  * Notable bug fixes:
    + Major speedup rendering large HoloMaps (~ 2-3 times faster).
    + Colorbars now consistent for all plot configurations.
    + Style pickling now works correctly.
  * API Changes:
    + Dimension formatter parameter now deprecated in favor of
      value_format.
    + Types of Chart and Table Element data now dependent on selected
      interface.
    + DFrame conversion interface deprecated in favor of Columns
      pandas interface.

    working extensively on the plotting and rendering system to
    ensure HoloViews is fully backend independent.
  + Highlights/Features:
    * Allowed display of data structures which do not match the
      recommended nesting hierarchy (67b28f3, fbd89c3).

      now accept an explicit number of ticks, an explicit list of tick
      positions (and labels), and a matplotlib tick locator.
    * Changed backend options in %output magic, ``nbagg`` and ``d3`` are
      now modes of the matplotlib backend and can be selected with
      ``backend='matplotlib:nbagg'`` and ``backend='matplotlib:mpld3'``
      respectively. The 'd3' and 'nbagg' options remain supported but will
      be deprecated in future.
    * Customizations should no longer be applied directly to ``Store.options``;  
      the ``Store.options(backend='matplotlib')`` object should be
      customized instead.  There is no longer a need to call the
      deprecated ``Store.register_plots`` method.
