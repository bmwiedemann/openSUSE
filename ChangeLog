    LINUX-5.7: replace __pagevec_lru_add with lru_cache_add_file
    
    The Linux function __pagevec_lru_add is no longer exported in Linux
    5.7-rc1 commit bde07cfc65da5fe6c63fe23f035f5ccc0ffd89e0
    "mm/swap.c: not necessary to export __pagevec_lru_add()".
    
    As a replacement, the Linux function lru_cache_add_file can be used for
    adding a page to the lru cache.  The internal processing of
    lru_cache_add_file manages its own internal pagevec and performs the
    following:
         get_page(...)
         if(!pagevec_add(...))
            __pagevec_lru_add_file(...)
    
    Introduce an autoconf test for lru_cache_add_file and replace the calls
    associated with __pagevec_lru_add with lru_cache_add_file.
    
    NOTE: see Linux commit a0b8cab3b9b2efadabdcff264c450ca515e2619c
    "mm: remove lru parameter from __pagevec_lru_add and remove parts of
    pagevec API" as a reference for this change.
    
    The lru_cache_add_file was introduced in Linux 2.6.28, therefore this
    change affects systems with Linux 2.6.28 kernels and later.

    libafs: Abstract the Linux lru cache interface
    
    Define static functions afs_lru_cache_init, afs_lru_cache_add and
    afs_lru_cache_finalize to handle interfacing with Linux's lru
    facilities.
    
    This change's primary purpose is to isolate the preprocessor
    conditionals associated with the details of the system lru interfaces to
    just these functions and to simplify the areas that utilize lru caching
    by removing the preprocessor conditionals.
    
    As Linux's lru facilities change, additional conditional code will be
    needed.

    LINUX 5.6: define osi_timeval32_t for 32-bit Linux
    
    For 32-bit Linux (e.g., arch i586), AFS_LINUX_64BIT_KERNEL is not
    defined, so osi_timeval32_t is defined as a typedef of the native
    'timeval'.  However, as of commit
    c766d1472c70d25ad475cf56042af1652e792b23 "y2038: hide
    timeval/timespec/itimerval/itimerspec types" (Linux 5.6), the native
    timeval struct is no longer available.  On such a kernel, the OpenAFS
    build will fail because osi_timeval32_t is not properly defined.
    
    Instead, add new conditionals to properly define osi_timeval32_t for
    this platform.

    afs: Add ppc64le changes in osconf.m4 file.
    
    If swig package is installed on a ppc64le system, build fails for
    "libuafs" while running "shlib-build". "shlib-build" gets executed for
    builing ukernel.so and this is triggered if "LIBUAFS_BUILD_PERL" is not
    empty. Having "swig" package on system sets "LIBUAFS_BUILD_PERL" to
    'LIBUAFS_BUILD_PERL' value. The reason for build failure was inside
    "shlib-build", 'linker' was not set (it was empty). 'linker' value is
    set based on SHLIB_LINKER, which was not defined in  osconf.m4 if build
    system is ppc64le.
    
    To fix this add ppc64le_linux26 case in osconf.m4 file.

    LINUX: Avoid building rand-fortuna-kernel.o
    
    Currently, we build rand-fortuna-kernel.o for libafs on all platforms,
    even though we only use the fortuna RNG on AIX, DragonFlyBSD, HP-UX,
    and Irix. Everywhere else, our RAND_bytes() in
    src/crypto/hcrypto/kernel/rand.c uses osi_readRandom() instead of
    going through heimdal.
    
    Building rand-fortuna.c causes occasional build headaches for the
    kernel on Linux (see cc7f942, "LINUX: Disable kernel fortuna large
    frame errors"). The most recent instance of this is that Linux 5.6
    removes the definition for struct timeval, which is referenced in
    rand-fortuna.c.
    
    The Linux kernel is constantly changing, and so trying to keep
    rand-fortuna.c building on Linux seems like a waste of ongoing effort.
    So, just stop building rand-fortuna-kernel.o on Linux. The original
    intent of building this file on all platforms was to avoid bitrot, so
    still keep building rand-fortuna-kernel.o on all other platforms even
    when it's not used; just avoid it on Linux specifically, the platform
    that requires the most effort.
    
    To accomplish this, move rand-fortuna-kernel.o from AFSAOBJS to
    AFS_OS_OBJS, and remove it from the Linux-only AFSPAGOBJS.
    
    [1.8.x: The 1.8 branch does not contain the commits that introduced
    -Wno-error=frame-larger-than= (cc7f942a and 54150f38), so we can skip
    removing the references to -Wno-error=frame-larger-than=.]

    LINUX 5.6: use struct proc_ops for proc_create
    
    The Linux commit d56c0d45f0e27f814e87a1676b6bdccccbc252e9
    (proc: decouple proc from VFS with "struct proc_ops") was merged into
    Linux 5.6rc1.  The commit replaces the 'file_operations' parameter for
    proc_create with a new structure 'proc_ops'.
    
    Conditionally initialize and use proc_ops structures instead of
    file_operations structures for calls to proc_create.
    
    Notes:
     * proc_ops.proc_ioctl is equivalent to file_operations.unlocked_ioctl
     * The macros HAVE_UNLOCKED_IOCTL and HAVE_COMPAT_IOCTL are both
       hardcoded to 1 in linux's fs.h
     * proc_ops.compat_ioctl is conditional on Linux's CONFIG_COMPAT macro
       which is a separate test from the HAVE_COMPAT_IOCTL macro

    macos: add entry for afs into synthetic.conf
    
    The root mount point is read-only as of macOS 10.15. As a result, /afs
    cannot be created at this location. To workaround this restriction,
    macOS 10.15 provides an alternative way to create mount points at the
    root. To make it possible, an entry for the mount point in question must
    be added to /etc/synthetic.conf. The synthetic entities described in
    this file are not physically present on the disk. Instead, they are
    synthesized by the kernel during system boot.
    
    This commit adds an entry for afs into the file mentioned above. Knowing
    that this change only takes effect after reboot, also provide directions
    to the user during the installation process.

    OpenAFS package.

    macos: prepare for notarization
    
    With the public release of macOS 10.14.5, all new and updated kernel
    extensions must be notarized by Apple. To be taken into consideration,
    all executables must be signed and the Hardened Runtime capability must
    be enabled.
    
    This patch adds the missing prerequisites mentioned above.

    viced: prevent writes on readonly fileservers
    
    Currently, a fileserver can be initialized as readonly. In this mode,
    writes on this server should not be allowed. Unfortunately, updates on
    files stored by readonly fileservers are not completely prevented. In
    some situations, the check for RO server is omitted (e.g. if the user is
    the owner of the file to be updated). In other situations, the same
    check is redundant.
    
    To fix these problems, consolidate this check in one place.

    afs: Ensure CDirty is set during afs_write loop
    
    Currently, in afs_write(), we set CDirty on the given vcache, and then
    write the given data into various dcaches. When writing to a dcache,
    we call afs_DoPartialWrite, which may cause us to flush the dirty data
    to the fileserver and clear the CDirty bit.
    
    If we were given more than 1 chunk of data to write, we will then go
    through another iteration of the loop, writing more dirty data into
    dcaches, but CDirty will not be set. This can cause issues with, for
    example, afs_SimpleVStat() or afs_ProcessFS(), which use CDirty to
    determine whether or not to merge in FetchStatus info from the
    fileserver into our local cache. This can cause our local cache to
    incorrectly reflect the state of the file on the fileserver, instead
    of the state of the locally-modified file in our cache.
    
    A more detailed example is as follows. Consider a small C program that
    copies a file, fchmod()ing the destination before closing it:
    
        void
        do_copy(char *src_name, char *dest_name)
        {
            /* error checking elided */
            src_fd = open(src_name, O_RDONLY);
            dest_fd = open(dest_name, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0755);
            fstat(src_fd, &st);
            src_buf = mmap(NULL, st.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, src_fd, 0);
            write(dest_fd, src_buf, st.st_size);
            munmap(src_buf, st.st_size);
            close(src_fd);
            fchmod(dest_fd, 0100644);
            close(dest_fd);
        }
    
    Currently, on FBSD, using this to copy a 7862648-byte file, using a
    smallish cache (10000 blocks) will cause the destination to appear to
    be truncated, because avc->f.m.Length will be incorrect, even though
    all of the relevant data was written to the fileserver.
    
    On most other platforms such as SOLARIS and LINUX, this is not a
    problem, since currently they only write one page of data at a time to
    afs_write(), and so they never hit multiple iterations of the while()
    loop inside afs_write().
    
    To fix this, just set CDirty on every iteration of the while() loop in
    afs_write(). In general, we need to set CDirty after calling
    afs_DoPartialStore() anywhere if the caller continues to write more
    data. But all callers already do this, except for this one instance in
    afs_write().
    
    Thanks to tcreech@tcreech.com for helping find occurrences of the
    relevant issue.

    afs: Avoid -1 error for vreadUIO/vwriteUIO
    
    Commit c6b61a45 (afs: Verify osi_UFSOpen worked) added various checks
    to return an error if a given osi_UFSOpen failed. However, two of
    these checks (in afs_UFSReadUIO and afs_UFSWriteUIO) result in us
    returning -1 on error, in functions that otherwise return errno codes
    (e.g. ENOSPC). An error code of -1 might get interpreted as
    RX_CALL_DEAD, which would be rather confusing, so use EIO as a generic
    error instead.

    vos: fix name availability check in vos rename
    
    The UV_RenameVolume() function first updates the volume name in the
    VLDB, then read-write volume header and backup volume header, and
    finally all of the read-only volume headers. If this function is
    interrupted or a remote site is not reachable, the names in some of the
    volume headers will be out of sync with name in the VLDB entry.
    
    The implementation of UV_RenameVolume() is idempotent, so can be safely
    called with the same name as in the volume's VLDB entry. This could be
    used to bring all the names in the volume headers in sync with the name
    in the VLDB.
    
    Unfortunately, due to the check of the -newname parameter, vos
    rename will not invoke UV_RenameVolume() when the name in the VLDB has
    already been changed.  The vos rename command attempts to verify the
    desired name (-newname) is available before invoking UV_RenameVolume()
    by simply checking if a VLDB entry exists with that name, and
    incorrectly assumes when a VLDB entry exists with that name it is an
    entry for a different volume.
    
    Change the -newname check to allow vos rename to proceed when name has
    already been set in the VLDB entry of the volume being renamed. This
    allows admins to run vos rename command to complete a previously
    incomplete rename operation and bring the names in the volume headers in
    sync with the name in the VLDB entry.
    
    Note: Before this commit, administrators could workaround this vos
    rename limitation by renaming the volume twice, first to an unused
    volume name, then to the actual desired volume name.
    
    Remove the useless checks of the code1 return code after exit in
    the RenameVolume() function. These checks for code1 are never performed
    since the function exits early when the first VLDB_GetEntryByName()
    fails for any reason.
    
    Update the vos rename man page to show vos rename can be used to fix
    previously interrupted/failed rename. Also document the -oldname
    parameter accepts a numeric volume id to specify the volume to be
    renamed.

    ubik: improve logging for database synchonizations
    
    As an aid for debugging database synchronization issues, ensure that the
    logging is consistent and unambiguous for both the client and server
    sides of DISK_GetFile and DISK_SendFile.  Add new error messages as
    required.
    
    In addition, rework the "recovery sending version to <IP>" message in
    urecovery_Interact.  This message is misleading because the new version
    database is only sent to a DB server if its version is not up to date.
    Instead, move this message into the version check block immediately
    below it.  Also reword it for clarity and promote its log level from 5
    to 0.  Finally, remove the now-superfluous "recovery stating local
    database" log message.

    ubik: log important messages at default log level
    
    Many important ubik messages (e.g., errors, warnings, sync state
    changes) are logged at log level 5 (-d 5) or higher.  Many sites are
    reluctant to run ubik servers at a logging level higher than the default
    due to the large number of extremely noisy informational messages at log
    level 5.  Therefore, many important log messages are never seen.
    
    Instead, issue critical errors, warnings, and other important messages
    at log level 0 so that they are always seen, even at the default logging
    level.
    
    In addition, disambiguate the two "I am no longer sync-site" messages by
    adding a unique reason text to each.

    vol: remove empty directories left by vos zap -force
    
    The vos zap -force command does not remove the directories associated
    with the volume in question (AFS_NAMEI_ENV). When the vos zap -force
    command is executed, the volume server goes through the /vicep*/AFSIDat
    directories and removes the files associated with the volume id received
    as an argument. Unfortunately, the volume server does not remove the
    directories associated with this volume. As a result, empty directories
    are left behind.
    
    To fix this problem, remove the empty directories left behind when vos
    zap -force is executed.

    vol: check snprintf return values in namei_ops
    
    gcc8 is more aggressive about parsing format strings and computing bounds
    on the generated text from functions like snprintf.  In this case it seems best
    to detect cases of truncation and error out, rather than trying to increase
    stack buffer sizes or switch to asprintf.  These paths should be well-behaved
    since they are local to the fileserver, so this is mostly about appeasing the
    compiler's -Wformat-truncation checks to allow us to build with --enable-checking.

    venus: fix memory leak
    
    In GetPrefCmd, when we request server prefs from the kernel and our
    output buffer is not big enough, pioctl() will return E2BIG and we
    allocate more memory and try again. However, if the size of the output
    buffer reaches 16k bytes and this space is still not enough (or if
    pioctl fails and errno != E2BIG), we return without releasing the
    memory that was previously allocated.
    
    To fix this problem, free our output buffer when this happens.

    vol: avoid query for parent id when deleting disk header
    
    When a DAFS volume server removes a volume disk header file (V*.vol),
    the volume server invokes an fssync command to have the file server
    delete the Volume Group Cache (VGC) entry corresponding to the volume id
    and the parent id of the removed volume header.
    
    The volume parent id is unknown to the volume server when removing a
    volume disk header on behalf of a "vos zap -force" operation. In this
    case, the volume server issues a fssync query to attempt look up to the
    parent id from the file server's VGC.  If this fssync query fails for
    some reason, volume server is unable to delete the VGC entry for the
    deleted volume header. The volume server logs an error and vos zap
    reports a undocumented error code.
    
    One common way this can be encountered is to issue a "vos zap -force" on
    a file server that has just been restarted. In this case, the VGC may
    not be fully populated yet, so the volume server is not able to look up
    the parent id of the given volume.
    
    With this commit, relax the requirement for the parent id when deleting
    VGC entries. A placeholder of 0 is used to mean any parent id for the
    given volume id.
    
    This obviates the need to query for the parent id when performing a "vos
    zap -force", and allows the volume server to remove any VGC entries
    associated with the volume id being zapped.

    afs: avoid extra VL_GetEntryByName for .readonly's
    
    In the VLDB, there's only one logical entry for a volume and its
    associated clones; there are not separate entries for the RW volume
    "avol", the RO volume "avol.readonly", and the BK volume
    "avol.backup".  And so, when looking up a volume in the VLDB by name,
    the vlserver ignores any trailing ".readonly" or ".backup" in the
    given name.  More concretely, the result of calling
    VL_GetEntryByName*("avol") is identical to that from calling
    VL_GetEntryByName*("avol.readonly").
    
    Accordingly, if afs_GetVolumeByName(name) failed because the volume
    was not found in the VLDB, afs_GetVolumeByName(name.readonly) will
    fail as well (barring a change in external circumstances, such as the
    volume being created or a network connection coming back up).
    Therefore, the extra call in EvalMountData() is not necessary and can
    be removed.
    
    Remove the extra call, to slightly improve the response time of the
    client if the volume in question does not exist, and to reduce
    vlserver load when patched clients are looking up nonexistent volumes.

    cmd: improve help for programs without subcommands
    
    Some programs do not have subcommands (other than the standard "help",
    and "version" subcommands).  The cmd library provides the "noopcode"
    mechanism for new subcommand-less programs, but older programs take
    advantage of the optional "initcmd" token to simulate subcommand-less
    programs.  The "initcmd" token is optional to run the command, however
    it is required to display the command help.
    
    For example, running the xstat_cm_test program without any options gives
    a syntax error:
    
        $ xstat_cm_test
        xstat_cm_test: Missing required parameter '-cmname'
        ...
    
    Retrying with -help (or help, -h, --help), gives the rather unhelpful
    output:
    
        $ xstat_cm_test -help
        xstat_cm_test: Commands are:
        apropos         search by help text
        help            get help on commands
        initcmd         initialize the program
    
    It is not obvious to the user how to get the command usage for the
    program, nor that the initcmd subcommand to "initialize the program" is
    actually is a placeholder to run the program.
    
    Instead, display the command usage when help is requested and initcmd is
    the only defined subcommand for a program.
    
    For example:
    
        $ xstat_cm_test -help
        Usage: src/xstat/xstat_cm_test [initcmd]
                 -cmname <Cache Manager name(s) to monitor>+
                 -collID <Collection(s) to fetch>+ [-onceonly]
                 [-frequency <poll frequency, in seconds>]
                 [-period <data collection time, in minutes>] [-debug] [-help]
        Where: -onceonly  Collect results exactly once, then quit
               -debug     turn on debugging output
    
    The libcmd library now supports an "noopcode", which should used for
    future subcommand-less programs, but converting old programs to remove
    the initcmd opcode could break scripts which actually specify the
    optional initcmd token.
    
    This commit adds a new libcmd flag called CMD_IMPLICIT which is used to
    denote built-in subcommands such as "version" and "help".

    restorevol: replace snprintf with asprintf
    
    GCC is generating format-truncations warnings. With newer levels of gcc
    (e.g. gcc8) and --checking-enabled these warnings result in errors and
    failed builds.  In addition clang8 static analysis tools are reporting
    memory leaks.
    
    Replace snprintf with asprintf and eliminate some of the large work
    buffers that are being placed on the stack. In order to correct some of
    the format-truncation errors the size of the buffers grew significantly
    (e.g. gcc is reporting the need to resize some of the buffers from 256
    bytes to 4K in order to eliminate the warnings).
    
    Ensure allocated work buffers are freed before function return.
    
    Obtained a clean build with gcc9/clang8 with --enable-checking and a
    clean scan-build report with clang8.

    smail-notifier is a sample program that is undocumented and has not
    been well maintained.  It produces copious compiler warnings, and
    would require effort to bring the code up to decent coding practices.
    
    The bosserver provides a -notifier feature that can be used for

    LINUX 5.3: Add comments for fallthrough switch cases
    
    With commit 6e0f1c3b45102e7644d25cf34395ca980414317f (LINUX: Honor
    --enable-checking for libafs) building libafs against a linux 5.3
    kernel compiles with errors due to fall through in case statements when
    --enable-checking / --enable-warning is used.
    
    e.g.
      src/opr/jhash.h:82:17: error: this statement may fall through
                                    [-Werror=implicit-fallthrough=]
             case 3 : c+=k[2];
                      ~^~~~~~
    
    The GCC compiler will disable the implicit-fallthrough check for case
    statements that contain a "special" comment ( /* fall through */ ).
    
    Add the 'fall through' comment to indicate where fall throughs are
    acceptable.
    
    This commit only adds comments and does not alter any executable code.
    
    The -Wimplicit-fallthrough flag was enabled globally in the linux kernel
    build in 5.3-rc2 (commit: a035d552a93bb9ef6048733bb9f2a0dc857ff869

    LINUX: Unlock page on afs_linux_read_cache errors
    
    When afs_linux_read_cache is called with a non-NULL task, it is
    responsible for unlocking 'page' (unless it's unlocked in a background
    task), even if we encounter an error. Currently we almost always do
    unlock the given page for a non-NULL task, but if we manage to hit one
    of the codepaths that 'goto out', we skip over the unlock_page() call
    near the end of the function, and the page never gets unlocked.
    
    As a result, the page stays locked forever. That generally means any
    future access to the same file will block forever, and when we try to
    flush the relevant vcache, we will block waiting for the page lock
    while holding GLOCK. (This can happen via the background daemon via
    e.g. afs_ShakeLooseVCaches -> osi_TryEvictVCache -> afs_FlushVCache ->
    osi_VM_FlushVCache -> vmtruncate -> ... -> truncate_inode_pages_range
    -> __lock_page on Linux 2.6.32-754.2.1.el6.) This quickly brings the
    whole client to a halt until the machine can be forcibly rebooted.
    
    To solve this, just move the 'out:' label to before the page unlock.
    Add a few locking-related comments around the relevant code to help
    explain some relevant details.
    
    The relevant code has changed and been refactored over the years, but
    this problem has probably existed ever since this code was originally
    converted to using the readpage() of the underlying cache fs, in
    commit 88a03758 (Use readpage, not read for fastpath access).

    LINUX: Avoid re-taking global lock in afs_dentry_iput
    
    “dput” function internally can call dentry_iput which  results in
    calling afs_dentry_iput. So in case before calling “dput” if global lock
    was held then when afs_dentry_iput is called it will again try to lock
    global lock and will result in deadlock scenario.  So to avoid this
    deadlock make sure if global lock is already taken before calling
    afs_dentry_iput, don’t try to lock it again.  This issue was partially
    fixed in commit 0dac4de8 (Linux: drop GLOCK before calling dput)

    afs: Free 'addrs' array
    
    Currently, 3 places in libafs allocate an 'addrs' array in a very
    similar way to loop through our list of servers:
    ForceAllNewConnections(), afs_LoopServers(), and PCallBackAddr(). Of
    these, only afs_LoopServers actually frees the array.
    ForceAllNewConnections and PCallBackAddr leak the memory, but these
    are only hit from infrequent pioctls that can only be run by root, so
    the impact is small.
    
    Fix ForceAllNewConnections and PCallBackAddr to free the array.

    The interminable rework of afs_random()
    
    Commit f0a3d477d6109697645cfdcc17617b502349d91b restructured the
    operation on tv_usec to avoid using undefined behavior, but in
    the process introduced a behavior change.  Historically (at least as
    far back as AFS-3.3), we masked off the low nybble (four bits) of
    tv_usec before adding the low byte (eight bits) of the rxi_getaddr()
    output.  Why there was a desire to combine two sources of input for
    the overlapping four bits remains unclear, but restore the historical
    behavior for now, as the intent of commit
    f0a3d477d6109697645cfdcc17617b502349d91b was to not introduce any
    behavior changes.

    vlserver: initialize nvlentry elements after read
    
    Commit 7620bd33487207b348ed7aeba45f8d743132ba84 (vlserver: fix
    vlentryread() for old vldb formats) leaves the tail end of the
    serverNumber, serverParition and serverFlags arrays uninitialized since
    it only copies OMAXNSERVERS elements into arrays that have NMAXNSERVERS
    elements.
    
    Initialize the elements in the nvlentry server arrays that were not
    copied with BADSERVERID.

    When we're using old format compatibility, use OMAXNSERVERS for the

    aklog: require opt-in to enable single-DES in libkrb5
    
    Since the introduction of rxkad-k5 in response to OPENAFS-SA-2013-003,
    it is not strictly necessary to configure libkrb5 to allow weak crypto
    in order to obtain an AFS token.  A sufficient amount of time has passed
    since then that it is safe to assume that the default behavior is the
    more-secure one, and require opt-in for the insecure behavior.
    
    To indicate that the use of single-DES is quite risky, add the
    "-insecure_des" argument to both klog and aklog, to gate the
    preexisting calls that enable weak crypto/single-DES.
    These calls, and the -insecure_des option, may be removed entirely
    in a future commit.

    rxkad: v5der.c format truncation warnings
    
    GCC 7 is producing new warnings due to better compile time analysis.
    With --enable-checking v5der.c is failing with 2 errors due to possible
    format-truncation in some snprintf calls.  The format strings are being
    used to format a date and time values from a tm structure.
    
    The actual warnings/errors are being triggered from arithmetic being
    performed on the year and month members of the structure. The resulting
    values should not exceed the format lengths, but the compilers are still
    flagging the statements.
    
    v5der.c is part of the heimdal package that is pulled into the openafs
    source tree.  v5der.c is not compiled directly but is #included in
    ticket5.c
    
    Update ticket5.c to change the severity of the format-truncation
    diagnostic to a warning if using GCC 7 (or higher).
    
    Note: since v5der.c is pulled from an external source (heimdal), any
    changes to update v5der.c directly would need to be performed upstream.

    ptserver: Increase length limit of namelist, idlist, prlist, prentries
    
    An implementation limit of those lists was introduced in commit
    a0ffea098d8c5c5b46c6bf86a12d28d6e7096685 to prevent using unlimited
    amounts of memory in ptserver and the client.  Subsequent reports
    indicate that the chosen limits are small enough to restrict
    functionality currently in use at some sites where membership lists
    exceed the current limit.  Since this is just an implementation-
    defined limit and can freely change from release to release, increase
    the threshold by an order of magnitude to preserve functionality for
    existing deployments while still retaining some protection against
    attacker-controlled excessive memory allocation.

    afs: Avoid giving wrong 'tf' to afs_InitVolSlot
    
    Commit 75e3a589 (libafs: afs_InitVolSlot function) split out a bit of
    our code that initializes a struct volume into the afs_InitVolSlot
    function. However, it caused us to almost always pass a non-NULL 'tf'
    to afs_InitVolSlot, even if the target volume was not found.
    
    That is, before that commit, our code roughly did this:
    
        for (...; j != 0; j = tf->next) {
            ...;
            tf = &staticVolume;
            if (tf->volume == volid)
                break;
        }
        if (tf && j != 0) {
            use_tf_data();
        } else {
            use_blank_data();
        }
    
    The reason for the extra 'j != 0' check after the loop is to see if we
    hit the end of the volume hash chain, or if we actually found a
    matching 'tf' in the loop.
    
    And after that commit, the code did this:
    
        for (...; j != 0; j = tf->next) {
            ...;
            if (j != 0) {
                tf = &staticVolume;
                if (tf->volume == volid)
                    break;
            }
        }
        if (tf) {
            use_tf_data();
        } else {
            use_blank_data();
        }
    
    The check for 'j != 0' was moved to inside the for loop, but 'j' is
    always nonzero in the loop (otherwise, the for() would exit the loop).
    This means that if we didn't find a matching 'tf' in the loop, our
    'tf' would be non-NULL anyway, and so we'd initialize our volume slot
    from just the last entry in the hash chain.
    
    This means that for volumes that are not found in the VolumeItems
    file, our struct volume will probably be initialized with arbitrary
    data from another volume, instead of being initialized to the normal
    defaults (the 'else' clause in afs_InitVolSlot).
    
    This means that the 'dotdot' entry for the volume may be wrong, and so
    we may report the wrong parent dir for the root of a volume. However,
    the 'dotdot' entry should be fixed when the volume root is accessed
    via a mountpoint, so any such issue should be temporary. And of
    course, on some platforms (LINUX) we don't ever use the 'dotdot'
    information for a volume, and even on other platforms, often resolving
    the '..' entry is handled by other means (e.g. shells often calculate
    it themselves). But some 'pwd' calculations and other '..' corner
    cases may be affected.
    
    To fix this, change the relevant loop so that we only set 'tf' to
    non-NULL when we actually find a matching entry.

commit 9f38cbdc544d6659c60dbd578e86110df86457b6
Author: Mark Vitale <mvitale@sinenomine.net>

    viced: consistently enforce host thread quota for ICBS(3)
    
    From time to time, the fileserver may issue potentially long-running
    RXAFSCB_* RPCs back to a host (client).  If these are holding h_Lock_r
    (host->lock) while running, they may cause other service threads for the
    same host (client) to block.
    
    In order to prevent a given host from tying up too many service threads
    in this way, the fileserver enforces a quota limiting how many threads
    can be waiting for h_Lock_r on a particular host while waiting for one
    of the following RPCs to complete:
    - RXAFSCB_TellMeABoutYourself (TMAY)
    - RXAFSCB_WhoAreYou
    - RXAFSCB_ProbeUuid
    - RXAFSCB_InitCallBackState (ICBS)
    - RXAFSCB_InitCallBackState3 (ICBS3)
    
    Note: Although some of these RPCs are relatively lightweight, they may
    still experience network delays.
    
    This quota is enforced by calling h_threadquota() in h_Lookup_r and
    h_GetHost_r.  The quota check is enabled for a given host by turning on
    host->hostFlags HWHO_INPROGRESS for the duration of the RXAFSCB_* RPC.
    The quota check is only needed, and should only be enabled, when the RPC
    is issued while h_Lock_r is held.
    
    However, there are a few paths to ICBS(3) where h_Lock_r is held but
    HWHO_INPROGRESS is not set.  A delay in those paths may allow a host to
    consume an unlimited number of fileserver threads.  One such path
    observed in a field report was SRXAFS_FetchStatus -> CallPreamble ->
    BreakDelayedCallBacks_r -> RXAFSCB_ICBS3.
    
    Instead, enable host thread quotas for all remaining unregulated ICBS(3)
    RPCs.

    Commit b604ee7a (OPENAFS-SA-2018-002 kaserver: prevent KAM_ListEntry
    information leak) added a memset in kamListEntry before COUNT_REQ, but
    COUNT_REQ declares a local variable. This breaks the WINNT build,

    WINNT: Build bubasics before audit
    
    Commit 9ebff4c6 (OPENAFS-SA-2018-001 audit: support butc types) made
    src/audit require the butc.h header, and updated Makefile.in to
    reflect this. However, this dir is also built on WINNT, and the
    NTMakefile was not updated to reflect this dependency. As a result, we
    might fail to build src/audit on WINNT, since butc.h may not exist
    yet, and we get an error like:
    
                cl [...] /c audit.c
        audit.c
        cl : Command line warning D9025 : overriding '/W4' with '/W3'
        audit.c(27) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'afs/butc.h': No such file or directory
        NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'C:\PROGRA~2\MICROS~1.0\VC\bin\amd64\cl.EXE' : return code '0x2'
    
    To fix this, move 'bubasics' to be made before 'audit' in NTMakefile,
    so butc.h is available when we build 'audit'.

    afs: Avoid panics in afs_InvalidateAllSegments
    
    Currently, afs_InvalidateAllSegments panics when afs_GetValidDSlot
    fails. We panic in these cases because afs_InvalidateAllSegments
    cannot simply return an error to its callers; we must invalidate all
    segments for the given vcache, or we risk serving incorrect data to
    userspace as explained in the comments.
    
    Instead of panicing, though, we could simply sleep and retry the
    operation until it succeeds. Implement this, retrying every 10
    seconds, and logging a message every hour that we're stuck (in case
    we're stuck for a long time).
    
    When we retry the operation, do so in a background request, to avoid a
    somewhat common situation on Linux where we always get I/O errors from
    the cache when the calling process has a SIGKILL pending. Create a new
    background op for this, BOP_INVALIDATE_SEGMENTS.
    
    With this, the relevant vcache will be effectively unusable for the
    entire time we're stuck in this situation (avc->lock will be
    write-locked), but this is at least better than panicing the whole
    machine.

    The function in question does not have error handling in place, so
    rather than adding some or trying to assert the proper bounds, just
    use a slightly larger buffer for safety.
