Mon Dec 12 20:19:14 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- pcre2 10.42:
  * Fix 10.41 regression that added the default definition of
    PCRE2_CALL_CONVENTION to pcre2posix.c instead of pcre2posix.h,
    which meant that programs including pcre2posix.h but not pcre2.h
    couldn't compile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  2 00:36:59 UTC 2019 - Jason Sikes <jsikes@suse.de>

- Update to 10.33-RC1 to fix issue with LTO (boo#1133274).
  * Callouts from pcre2_substitute() are now available.

  * The POSIX functions are now all called pcre2_regcomp() etc., with wrapper
    functions that use the standard POSIX names. However, in pcre2posix.h the POSIX
    names are defined as macros. This should help avoid linking with the wrong
    library in some environments, while still exporting the POSIX names for
    pre-existing programs that use them.

  * Some new options:

    (a) PCRE2_EXTRA_ESCAPED_CR_IS_LF makes \r behave as \n.

    (b) PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX enables support for ECMAScript 6's \u{hh...}
        construct.

    (c) PCRE2_COPY_MATCHED_SUBJECT causes a copy of a matched subject to be
        made, instead of just remembering a pointer.

  * Some new Perl features:

    (a) Perl 5.28's experimental alphabetic names for atomic groups and
        lookaround assertions, for example, (*pla:...) and (*atomic:...).

    (b) The new Perl "script run" features (*script_run:...) and
        (*atomic_script_run:...) aka (*sr:...) and (*asr:...).

    (c) When PCRE2_UTF is set, allow non-ASCII letters and decimal digits in
        capture group names.

  * --disable-percent-zt disables the use of %zu and %td in formatting strings
    in pcre2test. They were already automatically disabled for VC and older C
    compilers.

  * Some changes related to callouts in pcre2grep:

    (a) Support for running an external program under VMS has been added, in
        addition to Windows and fork() support.

    (b) --disable-pcre2grep-callout-fork restricts the callout support in
        to the inbuilt echo facility.

- pcre2 10.32:
  * pcre2grep now supports the inclusion of binary zeros in
    patterns that are read from files via the -f option.
  * In pcre2_dfa_match(), internal recursive calls no longer use
    the stack for local workspace and local ovectors
  * Updated to Unicode version 11.0.0.
  * (*ACCEPT:ARG), (*FAIL:ARG), and (*COMMIT:ARG) are now supported.
  * Add support for \N{U+dddd}, but only in Unicode mode.

    retrieve the extra compile time options.
  * Public names for all pcre2_compile() error numbers.
  * Added PCRE2_CALLOUT_STARTMATCH and PCRE2_CALLOUT_BACKTRACK
    bits to a new field callout_flags in callout blocks.

- cleanup with spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 11 18:14:30 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 10.30
  * The main interpreter, pcre2_match(), has been refactored into
    a new version that does not use recursive function calls for
    remembering backtracking positions. The new implementation
    allows backtracking into recursive group calls in patterns,
    making it more compatible with Perl. For patterns that have a
    lot of backtracking, the heap is now used, and there is
    explicit limit on the amount, settable by
    pcre2_set_heap_limit(). The "recursion limit" is retained,
    but is renamed as "depth limit".
  * The new option PCRE2_ENDANCHORED insists that a pattern match
    must end at the end of the subject.
  * The new option PCRE2_EXTENDED_MORE implements Perl's /xx
    feature, and pcre2test is upgraded to support it. Setting
    within the pattern by (?xx) is Also supported.
  * (?n) can be used to set PCRE2_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE, because Perl
    now has this.
  * Additional pattern compile options in the compile context are
    now available: PCRE2_EXTRA_ALLOW_SURROGATE_ESCAPES and
    PCRE2_EXTRA_BAD_ESCAPE_IS LITERAL.
  * The newline type PCRE2_NEWLINE_NUL is now available.
  * The match limit value now also applies to pcre2_dfa_match()
    as there are patterns that can use up a lot of resources
    without necessarily recursing very deeply.
  * Various minor security fixes found by fuzzers:
    + bsc#1037165: crash for forward reference in lookbehind with 
                   PCRE2_ANCHORED
    + CVE-2017-8786: heap-based buffer overflow write in pcre2test
                     (bsc#1036942)
    + CVE-2017-7186: DoS by triggering an invalid Unicode property
                     lookup (bsc#1030066)

Thu Feb 16 21:25:42 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- pcre2 10.23:
  * major re-factoring of the pcre2_compile.c file
  * Back references are now permitted in lookbehind assertions when
    there are no duplicated group numbers (that is, (?| has not
    been used), and, if the reference is by name, there is only one
    group of that name. The referenced group must, of course be of
    fixed length.
  * \g{+<number>} (e.g. \g{+2} ) is now supported. It is a "forward
    back reference" and can be useful in repetitions
    (compare \g{-<number>} ). Perl does not recognize this syntax.
  * pcre2grep now automatically expands its buffer up to a maximum
    set by --max-buffer-size.
  * The -t option (grand total) has been added to pcre2grep.
  * A new function called pcre2_code_copy_with_tables() exists to
    copy a compiled pattern along with a private copy of the
    character tables that is uses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- pcre2 10.22:
  * The POSIX wrapper function regcomp() did not used to
    support back references and subroutine calls if called with the
    REG_NOSUB option. It now does.
  * A new function, pcre2_code_copy(), is added, to make a copy of a
    compiled pattern.
  * Support for string callouts is added to pcre2grep.
  * Added the PCRE2_NO_JIT option to pcre2_match().
  * The pcre2_get_error_message() function now returns with a
    negative error code if the error number it is given is unknown.
  * Several updates have been made to pcre2test and test scripts
  * Fix CVE-2016-3191: workspace overflow for (*ACCEPT) with deeply
                       nested parentheses (boo#971741)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 17 14:30:53 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 10.21
* Improve JIT matching speed of patterns starting with + or *.
* Use memchr() to find the first character in an unanchored match
  in 8-bit mode in the interpreter. This gives a significant speed
  improvement.
* 10.20 broke the handling of [[:>:]] and [[:<:]] in that
  processing them could involve a buffer overflow if the
  following character was an opening parenthesis.
* 10.20 also introduced a bug in processing this pattern:
  /((?x)(*:0))#(?'/, which was fixed.
* A callout with a string argument containing an opening square
  bracket, for example /(?C$[$)(?<]/, was incorrectly processed and
  could provoke a buffer overflow.
* A possessively repeated conditional group that could match an empty
  string, for example, /(?(R))*+/, was incorrectly compiled.
* The Unicode tables have been updated to Unicode 8.0.0.
* An empty comment (?#) in a pattern was incorrectly processed and
  could provoke a buffer overflow.
* Fix infinite recursion in the JIT compiler when certain patterns
  /such as (?:|a|){100}x/ are analysed.
* Some patterns with character classes involving [: and \\ were
  incorrectly compiled and could cause reading from uninitialized
  memory or an incorrect error diagnosis. Examples are:
  /[[:\\](?<[::]/ and /[[:\\](?'abc')[a:].
* A missing closing parenthesis for a callout with a string argument
  was not being diagnosed, possibly leading to a buffer overflow.
* If (?R was followed by - or + incorrect behaviour happened instead
  of a diagnostic.
* Fixed an issue when \p{Any} inside an xclass did not read the current
  character.
* About 80 more fixes, which you can read about in the ChangeLog
  shipped with the libpcre2-8-0 package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 14 08:42:04 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- PCRE2 10.20:
  * Callouts with string arguments and the
    pcre2_callout_enumerate() function have been implemented.
  * The PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option, which locks out the use of
    \C, is added.
  * The PCRE2_ALT_CIRCUMFLEX option lets ^ match after a newline at
    the end of a subject in multiline mode.
  * The way named subpatterns are handled has been refactored. The
    previous approach had several bugs.
  * The handling of \c in EBCDIC environments has been changed to
    conform to the perlebcdic document. (Incompatible change)
  * Bugs have been mended, many of them discovered by fuzzers.

  support in 32 bit archs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 15:40:59 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to 8.32 version:
  * There is now support for 32-bit character strings and UTF-32. Like the
    16-bit support, this is done by compiling a separate 32-bit library.
  * \X now matches a Unicode extended grapheme cluster.
  * Case-independent matching of Unicode characters that have more than one
    "other case" now makes all three (or more) characters equivalent. This
    applies, for example, to Greek Sigma, which has two lowercase versions.
  * Unicode character properties are updated to Unicode 6.2.0.
  * The EBCDIC support, which had decayed, has had a spring clean.
  * A number of JIT optimizations have been added, which give faster JIT
    execution speed. In addition, a new direct interface to JIT execution is
    available. This bypasses some of the sanity checks of pcre_exec() to give a
    noticeable speed-up.
  * A number of issues in pcregrep have been fixed, making it more compatible
    with GNU grep. In particular, --exclude and --include (and variants) apply
    to all files now, not just those obtained from scanning a directory
    recursively. In Windows environments, the default action for directories is
    now "skip" instead of "read" (which provokes an error).
  * If the --only-matching (-o) option in pcregrep is specified multiple
    times, each one causes appropriate output. For example, -o1 -o2 outputs the
    substrings matched by the 1st and 2nd capturing parentheses. A separating
    string can be specified by --om-separator (default empty).
  * When PCRE is built via Autotools using a version of gcc that has the
    "visibility" feature, it is used to hide internal library functions that are
    not part of the public API.
-  updated and versionned pcre-visibility.patch to svn trunk
   * Modifications on configure.ac and makefile have been merged on upstream release

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upate to version 8.31:
  + The JIT compiler now supports partial matching and the (*MARK)
    and (*COMMIT) verbs
  + PCRE_INFO_MAXLOOKBEHIND can be used to find the longest
    lookbehing in a pattern.
  + There should be a performance improvement when using the heap
    instead of the stack for recursion
  + pcregrep can now be linked with libedit as an alternative to
    libreadline
  + pcregrep now has a --file-list option where the list of files
    to scan is given as a file

    - support for (*MARK) and friends
    - PCRE_UCP option, which changes the behaviour of \b, \d, \s,
      and \w (and their opposites) so that they make use of Unicode
      properties

      newline
    - added --line-buffered to pcregrep
  + Several small new features and bugfixes
- Changes from version 8.02:
  + Update Unicode data tables to Unicode 5.2.0
  + Update the licensing terms in the pcregexp.pas file
  + Several bug fixes
- Changes from version 8.01:
  + Several bug fixes and build system improvements
- Changes from version 8.00:
  + Enhancements:
    - remove restrictions on patterns used for partial matching
    - give extra information for partial matches
    - improve the partial matching process
    - add option to make a partial match override a full match
    - enhance "study" process by finding a lower bound matching
      length
    - groups with duplicate numbers may now have duplicated names
      without the use of PCRE_DUPNAMES, but they may not have
      different names
    - add REG_UNGREEDY to the pcreposix interface, which maps to
      PCRE_UNGREEDY.
  + Several bug fixes
- Drop pcre-7.9.patch: fixed upstream.
- Rearrange spec file to have all the %files sections together, as
  well as all the scriptlets together.
- Kill the main package that only included doc files like AUTHORS,
  NEWS, and license, and put those files in libpcre0: this really
  makes more sense. Therefore, make libpcre0 Provides/Obsoletes
  libpcre0.
- We can also remove the other dependencies on the main package,
  since everything already depends on libpcre0.
- Remove AutoReqProv: it's default now.
- Remove references to perl 5.005 in descriptons: it's not
  mentioned anywhere anymore upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  1 19:43:16 CET 2008 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- update to version 7.6
- The main reason for having this release so soon after 7.5 
  is because it fixes a potential buffer overflow problem in pcre_compile() 
  when run in UTF-8 mode. In addition, the CMake configuration files have been brought up to date. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 13 09:08:22 CET 2008 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- update version 7.5
	1.  Applied a patch from Craig: "This patch makes it possible to 'ignore'
    values in parens when parsing an RE using the C++ wrapper."

	2.  Negative specials like \S did not work in character classes in UTF-8 mode.
    Characters greater than 255 were excluded from the class instead of being
    included.

	3.  The same bug as (2) above applied to negated POSIX classes such as
    [:^space:].

	4.  PCRECPP_STATIC was referenced in pcrecpp_internal.h, but nowhere was it
    defined or documented. It seems to have been a typo for PCRE_STATIC, so
    I have changed it.

	5.  The construct (?&) was not diagnosed as a syntax error (it referenced the
    first named subpattern) and a construct such as (?&a) would reference the
    first named subpattern whose name started with "a" (in other words, the
    length check was missing). Both these problems are fixed. "Subpattern name
    expected" is now given for (?&) (a zero-length name), and this patch also
    makes it give the same error for \k'' (previously it complained that that
    was a reference to a non-existent subpattern).

	6.  The erroneous patterns (?+-a) and (?-+a) give different error messages;
    this is right because (?- can be followed by option settings as well as by
    digits. I have, however, made the messages clearer.

	7.  Patterns such as (?(1)a|b) (a pattern that contains fewer subpatterns
    than the number used in the conditional) now cause a compile-time error.
    This is actually not compatible with Perl, which accepts such patterns, but
    treats the conditional as always being FALSE (as PCRE used to), but it
    seems to me that giving a diagnostic is better.

	8.  Change "alphameric" to the more common word "alphanumeric" in comments
    and messages.

	9.  Fix two occurrences of "backslash" in comments that should have been
    "backspace".

	10. Remove two redundant lines of code that can never be obeyed (their function
    was moved elsewhere).

	11. The program that makes PCRE's Unicode character property table had a bug
    which caused it to generate incorrect table entries for sequences of
    characters that have the same character type, but are in different scripts.
    It amalgamated them into a single range, with the script of the first of
    them. In other words, some characters were in the wrong script. There were
    thirteen such cases, affecting characters in the following ranges:

      U+002b0 - U+002c1
      U+0060c - U+0060d
      U+0061e - U+00612
      U+0064b - U+0065e
      U+0074d - U+0076d
      U+01800 - U+01805
      U+01d00 - U+01d77
      U+01d9b - U+01dbf
      U+0200b - U+0200f
      U+030fc - U+030fe
      U+03260 - U+0327f
      U+0fb46 - U+0fbb1
      U+10450 - U+1049d

	12. The -o option (show only the matching part of a line) for pcregrep was not
    compatible with GNU grep in that, if there was more than one match in a
    line, it showed only the first of them. It now behaves in the same way as
    GNU grep.

	13. If the -o and -v options were combined for pcregrep, it printed a blank
    line for every non-matching line. GNU grep prints nothing, and pcregrep now
    does the same. The return code can be used to tell if there were any
    non-matching lines.

	14. Added --file-offsets and --line-offsets to pcregrep.

	15. The pattern (?=something)(?R) was not being diagnosed as a potentially
    infinitely looping recursion. The bug was that positive lookaheads were not
    being skipped when checking for a possible empty match (negative lookaheads
    and both kinds of lookbehind were skipped).

	16. Fixed two typos in the Windows-only code in pcregrep.c, and moved the
    inclusion of <windows.h> to before rather than after the definition of
    INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES (patch from David Byron).

	17. Specifying a possessive quantifier with a specific limit for a Unicode
    character property caused pcre_compile() to compile bad code, which led at
    runtime to PCRE_ERROR_INTERNAL (-14). Examples of patterns that caused this
    are: /\p{Zl}{2,3}+/8 and /\p{Cc}{2}+/8. It was the possessive "+" that
    caused the error; without that there was no problem.

	18. Added --enable-pcregrep-libz and --enable-pcregrep-libbz2.

	19. Added --enable-pcretest-libreadline.

	20. In pcrecpp.cc, the variable 'count' was incremented twice in
    RE::GlobalReplace(). As a result, the number of replacements returned was
    double what it should be. I removed one of the increments, but Craig sent a
    later patch that removed the other one (the right fix) and added unit tests
    that check the return values (which was not done before).

	21. Several CMake things:

    (1) Arranged that, when cmake is used on Unix, the libraries end up with
        the names libpcre and libpcreposix, not just pcre and pcreposix.

    (2) The above change means that pcretest and pcregrep are now correctly
        linked with the newly-built libraries, not previously installed ones.

    (3) Added PCRE_SUPPORT_LIBREADLINE, PCRE_SUPPORT_LIBZ, PCRE_SUPPORT_LIBBZ2.

	22. In UTF-8 mode, with newline set to "any", a pattern such as .*a.*=.b.*
    crashed when matching a string such as a\x{2029}b (note that \x{2029} is a
    UTF-8 newline character). The key issue is that the pattern starts .*;
    this means that the match must be either at the beginning, or after a
    newline. The bug was in the code for advancing after a failed match and
    checking that the new position followed a newline. It was not taking
    account of UTF-8 characters correctly.

	23. PCRE was behaving differently from Perl in the way it recognized POSIX
    character classes. PCRE was not treating the sequence [:...:] as a
    character class unless the ... were all letters. Perl, however, seems to
    allow any characters between [: and :], though of course it rejects as
    unknown any "names" that contain non-letters, because all the known class
    names consist only of letters. Thus, Perl gives an error for [[:1234:]],
    for example, whereas PCRE did not - it did not recognize a POSIX character
    class. This seemed a bit dangerous, so the code has been changed to be
    closer to Perl. The behaviour is not identical to Perl, because PCRE will
    diagnose an unknown class for, for example, [[:l\ower:]] where Perl will
    treat it as [[:lower:]]. However, PCRE does now give "unknown" errors where
    Perl does, and where it didn't before.

	24. Rewrite so as to remove the single use of %n from pcregrep because in some
    Windows environments %n is disabled by default.

- update to version 7.4, since version 7.2, more than 40 bugs were fixed
 including multiple vulnerabilities [#325921] . The list of changes is too long
 to mention here, see changelog.txt for details.

  Cristian Rodriguez <crrodriguez@novell.com> who provided
  the patch (#298291)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 23 15:22:40 CEST 2007 - ms@suse.de

- update to version 7.2, fixes bug: (#293752)
- Changes from 7.1 to 7.2

 1. If the fr_FR locale cannot be found for test 3, try the "french" locale,
    which is apparently normally available under Windows.

 2. Re-jig the pcregrep tests with different newline settings in an attempt
    to make them independent of the local environment's newline setting.

 3. Add code to configure.ac to remove -g from the CFLAGS default settings.

 4. Some of the "internals" tests were previously cut out when the link size
    was not 2, because the output contained actual offsets. The recent new
    "Z" feature of pcretest means that these can be cut out, making the tests
    usable with all link sizes.

 5. Implemented Stan Switzer's goto replacement for longjmp() when not using
    stack recursion. This gives a massive performance boost under BSD, but just
    a small improvement under Linux. However, it saves one field in the frame
    in all cases.

 6. Added more features from the forthcoming Perl 5.10:

    (a) (?-n) (where n is a string of digits) is a relative subroutine or
        recursion call. It refers to the nth most recently opened parentheses.

    (b) (?+n) is also a relative subroutine call; it refers to the nth next
        to be opened parentheses.

    (c) Conditions that refer to capturing parentheses can be specified
        relatively, for example, (?(-2)... or (?(+3)...

    (d) \K resets the start of the current match so that everything before
        is not part of it.

    (e) \k{name} is synonymous with \k<name> and \k'name' (.NET compatible).

    (f) \g{name} is another synonym - part of Perl 5.10's unification of
        reference syntax.

    (g) (?| introduces a group in which the numbering of parentheses in each
        alternative starts with the same number.

    (h) \h, \H, \v, and \V match horizontal and vertical whitespace.

 7. Added two new calls to pcre_fullinfo(): PCRE_INFO_OKPARTIAL and
    PCRE_INFO_JCHANGED.

 8. A pattern such as  (.*(.)?)*  caused pcre_exec() to fail by either not
    terminating or by crashing. Diagnosed by Viktor Griph; it was in the code
    for detecting groups that can match an empty string.

 9. A pattern with a very large number of alternatives (more than several
    hundred) was running out of internal workspace during the pre-compile
    phase, where pcre_compile() figures out how much memory will be needed. A
    bit of new cunning has reduced the workspace needed for groups with
    alternatives. The 1000-alternative test pattern now uses 12 bytes of
    workspace instead of running out of the 4096 that are available.

10. Inserted some missing (unsigned int) casts to get rid of compiler warnings.

11. Applied patch from Google to remove an optimization that didn't quite work.
    The report of the bug said:

      pcrecpp::RE("a*").FullMatch("aaa") matches, while
      pcrecpp::RE("a*?").FullMatch("aaa") does not, and
      pcrecpp::RE("a*?\\z").FullMatch("aaa") does again.

12. If \p or \P was used in non-UTF-8 mode on a character greater than 127
    it matched the wrong number of bytes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  1 11:02:54 CEST 2007 - ms@suse.de

- added --enable-unicode-properties configure option to support
  UTF-8 character strings in \P, \p, and \X (#269749)

Mon Apr 30 10:12:10 CEST 2007 - trenn@suse.de

- corrected assert compile error

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 25 13:39:55 CEST 2007 - ms@suse.de

- update to pcre 7.1

 1. Applied Bob Rossi and Daniel G's patches to convert the build system to one
    that is more "standard", making use of automake and other Autotools. There
    is some re-arrangement of the files and adjustment of comments consequent
    on this.

 2. Part of the patch fixed a problem with the pcregrep tests. The test of -r
    for recursive directory scanning broke on some systems because the files
    are not scanned in any specific order and on different systems the order
    was different. A call to "sort" has been inserted into RunGrepTest for the
    approprate test as a short-term fix. In the longer term there may be an
    alternative.

 3. I had an email from Eric Raymond about problems translating some of PCRE's
    man pages to HTML (despite the fact that I distribute HTML pages, some
    people do their own conversions for various reasons). The problems
    concerned the use of low-level troff macros .br and .in. I have therefore
    removed all such uses from the man pages (some were redundant, some could
    be replaced by .nf/.fi pairs). The 132html script that I use to generate
    HTML has been updated to handle .nf/.fi and to complain if it encounters
    .br or .in.

 4. Updated comments in configure.ac that get placed in config.h.in and also
    arranged for config.h to be included in the distribution, with the name
    config.h.generic, for the benefit of those who have to compile without
    Autotools (compare pcre.h, which is now distributed as pcre.h.generic).

 5. Updated the support (such as it is) for Virtual Pascal, thanks to Stefan
    Weber: (1) pcre_internal.h was missing some function renames; (2) updated
    makevp.bat for the current PCRE, using the additional files
    makevp_c.txt, makevp_l.txt, and pcregexp.pas.

 6. A Windows user reported a minor discrepancy with test 2, which turned out
    to be caused by a trailing space on an input line that had got lost in his
    copy. The trailing space was an accident, so I've just removed it.

 7. Add -Wl,-R... flags in pcre-config.in for *BSD* systems, as I'm told
    that is needed.

 8. Mark ucp_table (in ucptable.h) and ucp_gentype (in pcre_ucp_searchfuncs.c)
    as "const" (a) because they are and (b) because it helps the PHP
    maintainers who have recently made a script to detect big data structures
    in the php code that should be moved to the .rodata section. I remembered
    to update Builducptable as well, so it won't revert if ucptable.h is ever
    re-created.

 9. Added some extra #ifdef SUPPORT_UTF8 conditionals into pcretest.c,
    pcre_printint.src, pcre_compile.c, pcre_study.c, and pcre_tables.c, in
    order to be able to cut out the UTF-8 tables in the latter when UTF-8
    support is not required. This saves 1.5-2K of code, which is important in
    some applications.

    Later: more #ifdefs are needed in pcre_ord2utf8.c and pcre_valid_utf8.c
    so as not to refer to the tables, even though these functions will never be
    called when UTF-8 support is disabled. Otherwise there are problems with a
    shared library.

10. Fixed two bugs in the emulated memmove() function in pcre_internal.h:

    (a) It was defining its arguments as char * instead of void *.

    (b) It was assuming that all moves were upwards in memory; this was true
        a long time ago when I wrote it, but is no longer the case.

    The emulated memove() is provided for those environments that have neither
    memmove() nor bcopy(). I didn't think anyone used it these days, but that
    is clearly not the case, as these two bugs were recently reported.

11. The script PrepareRelease is now distributed: it calls 132html, CleanTxt,
    and Detrail to create the HTML documentation, the .txt form of the man
    pages, and it removes trailing spaces from listed files. It also creates
    pcre.h.generic and config.h.generic from pcre.h and config.h. In the latter
    case, it wraps all the #defines with #ifndefs. This script should be run
    before "make dist".

12. Fixed two fairly obscure bugs concerned with quantified caseless matching
    with Unicode property support.

    (a) For a maximizing quantifier, if the two different cases of the
        character were of different lengths in their UTF-8 codings (there are
        some cases like this - I found 11), and the matching function had to
        back up over a mixture of the two cases, it incorrectly assumed they
        were both the same length.

    (b) When PCRE was configured to use the heap rather than the stack for
        recursion during matching, it was not correctly preserving the data for
        the other case of a UTF-8 character when checking ahead for a match
        while processing a minimizing repeat. If the check also involved
        matching a wide character, but failed, corruption could cause an
        erroneous result when trying to check for a repeat of the original
        character.

13. Some tidying changes to the testing mechanism:

    (a) The RunTest script now detects the internal link size and whether there
        is UTF-8 and UCP support by running ./pcretest -C instead of relying on
        values substituted by "configure". (The RunGrepTest script already did
        this for UTF-8.) The configure.ac script no longer substitutes the
        relevant variables.

    (b) The debugging options /B and /D in pcretest show the compiled bytecode
        with length and offset values. This means that the output is different
        for different internal link sizes. Test 2 is skipped for link sizes
        other than 2 because of this, bypassing the problem. Unfortunately,
        there was also a test in test 3 (the locale tests) that used /B and
        failed for link sizes other than 2. Rather than cut the whole test out,
        I have added a new /Z option to pcretest that replaces the length and
        offset values with spaces. This is now used to make test 3 independent
        of link size. (Test 2 will be tidied up later.)

14. If erroroffset was passed as NULL to pcre_compile, it provoked a
    segmentation fault instead of returning the appropriate error message.

15. In multiline mode when the newline sequence was set to "any", the pattern
    ^$ would give a match between the \r and \n of a subject such as "A\r\nB".
    This doesn't seem right; it now treats the CRLF combination as the line
    ending, and so does not match in that case. It's only a pattern such as ^$
    that would hit this one: something like ^ABC$ would have failed after \r
    and then tried again after \r\n.

16. Changed the comparison command for RunGrepTest from "diff -u" to "diff -ub"
    in an attempt to make files that differ only in their line terminators
    compare equal. This works on Linux.

17. Under certain error circumstances pcregrep might try to free random memory
    as it exited. This is now fixed, thanks to valgrind.

19. In pcretest, if the pattern /(?m)^$/g<any> was matched against the string
    "abc\r\n\r\n", it found an unwanted second match after the second \r. This
    was because its rules for how to advance for /g after matching an empty
    string at the end of a line did not allow for this case. They now check for
    it specially.

20. pcretest is supposed to handle patterns and data of any length, by
    extending its buffers when necessary. It was getting this wrong when the
    buffer for a data line had to be extended.

21. Added PCRE_NEWLINE_ANYCRLF which is like ANY, but matches only CR, LF, or
    CRLF as a newline sequence.

22. Code for handling Unicode properties in pcre_dfa_exec() wasn't being cut
    out by #ifdef SUPPORT_UCP. This did no harm, as it could never be used, but
    I have nevertheless tidied it up.

23. Added some casts to kill warnings from HP-UX ia64 compiler.

24. Added a man page for pcre-config.

- update to new version 7.0
  Changes: As well as a number of bugfixes, there has been a major
  refactoring of the compiling code, which makes it easier to add new
  features, including some new optimizations. A QuoteMeta function has been
  added to the C++ wrapper. There is now a mode in which all Unicode newline
  sequences are recognized. Support for the Perl 5.10 syntax for features
  that were previously in PCRE but not in Perl (named groups, possessive
  quantifiers) has been added.

Mon Jul 10 16:29:14 CEST 2006 - ms@suse.de

- update to new version 6.7
- finally removed evil configure patch
- When UTF-8 mode was not set, PCRE looped when compiling certain patterns
  containing an extended class (one that cannot be represented by a bitmap
  because it contains high-valued characters or Unicode property items, e.g.
  [\pZ]). Almost always one would set UTF-8 mode when processing such a
  pattern, but PCRE should not loop if you do not (it no longer does).
  [Detail: two cases were found: (a) a repeated subpattern containing an
  extended class; (b) a recursive reference to a subpattern that followed a
  previous extended class. It wasn't skipping over the extended class
  correctly when UTF-8 mode was not set.]
- Applied a patch from the folks at Google to pcrecpp.cc, to fix "another
  instance of the 'standard' template library not being so standard".
