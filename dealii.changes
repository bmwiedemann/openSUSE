Fri Apr  9 07:12:25 UTC 2021 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Add disk constraints

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 27 23:36:45 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- _constraints: Increase physical memory to 8 GB to fix slow
  builds causing workers to time out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 30 00:05:22 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add dealii-boost-1_75.patch: Fix build with boost 1.75; patch
  taken from upstream git commits (gh#dealii/dealii#11379).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 17 08:50:56 UTC 2020 - Michel Normand <normand@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

- for ppc64 (BE) increase memlim from 2k to 3k in spec file
  to avoid build failure in OBS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  7 12:13:27 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add dealii-build-with-muparser-2.3.2.patch: Fix muparser 2.3.2
  version detection and thus build (gh#dealii/dealii#10548).
- Drop Group tags.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  3 19:22:21 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Trim conjecture from description.
- Trim double "library" in summary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 31 14:19:39 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 9.2.0: see
  https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_1_1_and_9_2_0.html
- Drop patches commited upstream:
  * dealii-find-parpack-independently-of-arpack.patch
  * dealii-tbb-version-check.patch
- Set up spec file for enabling python bindings later, when
  gh#dealii/dealii#10423 is fixed; disable building the bindings
  themselves using bcond_with.
- Pass DEAL_II_COMPILE_EXAMPLES=OFF to cmake to prevent compiling
  the examples and generating binaries which are then installed to
  %_docdir.
- Disable Link-Time-Optimization for aarch64 to prevent builds
  from from failing due to linking taking too long and OBS
  shutting down the worker assuming a stuck job.
- Update _constraints file to ensure enough physical memory in
  build worker to prevent swapping (which slows down and
  eventually times out the build):
  * aarch64: 4 GB (these runs don't time out, so it's okay to have
    a lower memory requirement than for x86_64).
  * x86_64: 7 GB.
- For aarch64, require at least 4000M per thread for compilation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 10 02:25:04 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 9.1.1:
  * Fixed a compatibility bug in GridIn::read_msh with older gmsh
    mesh format files. 
- Changes from version 9.1.0: see
  https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_0_1_and_9_1_0.html.
- Changes from version 9.0.0: see
  https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_8_5_0_and_9_0_0.html.
- Implement multibuild for openmpi2, openmpi3, and serial
  flavours (openmpi1 not supported by dealii).
- Add dealii-tbb-version-check.patch to detect correct version
  of TBB; patch taken from upstream [gh#dealii/dealii#9475].
- Add dealii-find-parpack-independently-of-arpack.patch to detect
  parpack independently of arpack's location; patch taken from
  upstream pull request [gh#dealii/dealii#10197]. Note that *both*
  arpack and parpack are required when building with MPI enabled.
- Use deal_II*-devel as the devel pkg name to be consistent with
  shared lib packaging policy; add Provides: dealii*-devel to help
  with upgrade.
- Use ninja for build (BuildRequires: ninja).
- Use memory_constraints to require per-thread memory >= 2 GB;
  introduces BuildRequires: memory-constraints.
- Use %cmake_build instead of running make.
- Update cmake options in keeping with upstream changes.
- Add _constraints file to limit builds to at least 2 GB memory,
  anything less causes out-of-memory problems.
- Update License tag: dealii is now licensed as LGPL-2.1-or-later.
- Remove hashbangs from non-executable files.
- Link duplicate files in %{_docdir}.
- Disable builds on i586 as linking takes too long leading to OBS
  worker assuming a "stuck job" and killing the VM.
- Disable building documentation for openSUSE 15.1 as it fails.
