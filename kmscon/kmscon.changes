Wed Oct  9 00:11:56 UTC 2013 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- version 7+git52
- Corrects systemd units so they work correctly with current
  versions
- add uvtd new Virtual Terminal daemon, disabled by default
  in upstream and here as well.
- bugfixes
- Use scanelf to remove executable stack from mod_unifont
  while the problem is fixed at its roots.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 22 18:05:01 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add kmscon-x-linking.patch: Fix inclusion of xkbcommon: this all
  used wrongly to be pulled in by SDL. kmscon though does include
  the xkbcommon headers on its own and as such must take care of
  finding them appropriately.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  2 21:18:03 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Updated to version 7
* TSM, font and text subsystems were extended for multi-width fonts,
  which allows using CJK characters if the glyphs are available
* The environment variable COLORTERM is set to kmscon
* /bin/login is called with -p
* The Freetype2 backend is now deprecated. Use the built-in 8x16,
  unifont or pango backends.
- Merge -service package into (main)
- Build and ship manpage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  9 14:32:14 UTC 2013 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- install kmsconvt@.service too

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  9 05:35:18 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Do not mark service file as %config
- Set RPM group for library packages
- Use more robust make install call

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  9 04:43:50 UTC 2013 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update to 6.git110
* Allow arbitrary paths with --vt (kmscon)
* xkbcommon is now mandatory. We need it to handle keyboard input
  properly and since xkbcommon-0.2.0 is released, there is no
  reason to not depend on it.
  We also removed the plain-input backend with this change.
* Snap window to console/font-size on resize (wlterm)
* Adjust to new libwayland-1.0 (wlterm)
* Many new command-line options for wlterm including --term,
  --login, --palette, --sb-size and many --grab-* options.
* fake-VTs no longer react on SIGUSR1/2. This was always broken and
  now removed.
* --switchvt works again and is now enabled by default.
* --xkb-model was introduced. The other --xkb-<rmlvo> options also
  use system-defaults instead of us-keymap as default value now.
* wlterm works properly in maximized and fullscreen mode now
* key-presses are now properly marked as "handled" so it is no
  longer
  possible for two subsystems to handle the same key-press.
* wlterm can now zoom the font size with ctrl+Plus/Minus
* TSM now supports screen selections. wlterm is hooked up with this
  and supports this, too. However, the VTE layer has not seen this
  yet so everything is computed in the terminal for now. Next
  kmscon release will include client-side mouse-protocol support.
* Copy/Paste now works with wlterm
* Key-repeat has been reworked and now allows adjusting repeat and
  delay times.
* Session support allows for multiple terminals (sessions) inside
  of each seat. You can switch between the sessions, kill them and
  create new terminals via keyboard shortcuts. Also several other
  sessions than terminal sessions were introduced. However, all of
  them are experimental and shouldn't be used.
* TSM now supports alternate screen buffers. They're enabled by
  default.
* Configuration handling has been reworked. Multiple config-files
  can now be parsed and each seat has its own configuration file in
  /etc/kmscon/<seat>.seat.conf.
* The build-tools have been reworked. They should now work properly
  with any option-combination imaginable.
* --login option can now be used in config-files.
* We print hints if keyboard-shortcut names are written with wrong
  capitalization.
* Improve systemd integration
* CDev sessions emulate enough of the VT API to make X-Server run
  as kmscon session. You can even run kmscon in default-mode as
  client in another kmscon manager.
* Bold fonts are now supported.
* kmscon.1 manpage is available now.
* ... and a lot of bugfixes

- Do not buildrequier systemd: pkgconfig(systemd-login) is
  perfectly sufficient.
