- update to remind-3.1.15 
  - BUG FIX: Fix a buffer overflow found by Alexander Keller
    (CVE-2015-5957)
  - BUG FIX: Make parser reject an AT followed by more than one time.
  - BUG FIX: Make parser reject repeated delta or *repeat values.
  - NEW FEATURE: Putting the line __EOF__ in a .rem file causes
    Remind to treat it as end-of-file.
  - IMPROVEMENT: Use better PNG images for moons in the HTML display
  - BUG FIX: The "-n" command-line option should really run in
    "ADVANCE_MODE" rather than "CAL_MODE" internally; otherwise,
    the substitution sequences may be misinterpreted.
  - BUG FIX: A typo in clearing out MD5 sum context has been fixed.
  - BUG FIX: Typo in Spanish translation was fixed.

- update to remind-3.1.13 
  - BUG FIX: Sunrise/Sunset calculations greatly improved thanks to
    John McGowan.  Accuracy should now be within a couple of
    minutes in most places.
  - BUG FIX: Allow specification of margins as low as 0 points in
    rem2ps, courtesy of Jonathan Kamens.
  - BUG FIX: Permit compilation with gcc 2.95 (which doesn't allow
    variable declarations after non-declaration statements in a
    block.)
  - BUG FIX: Several minor documentation errors corrected courtesy
    of Simon Ruderich.
  - BUG FIX: Spurious test harness failure was fixed.

- update to remind-3.1.12 
  - NEW FEATURE: Many substitution sequences "%x" have an alternate
    mode denoted by "%*x".  This alternate mode leaves out
    prepositions.  For example, in English "%i" might yield "on
    01-25" while "%*i" yields only "01-25".
  - BUG FIX: The "dusk" and "dawn" calculations were completely
    wrong.  They have been fixed.  Also, sunrise/sunset calculations
    have been tweaked, so the results may be off by a minute or two
    compared to previous versions of Remind.
  - BUG FIX: For some inexplicable reason, dawn was considered to
    happen when the sun was 14 degrees below the horizon instead of
    the standard 6 degrees for Civil Dawn.  This has been fixed.
  - BUG FIXES: Clarified the man pages and fixed some typos.
  - BUG FIX: Add THROUGH to the remind.vim syntax highlighting file.
  - ENHANCEMENT (?): Allow SPECIAL COLOR to be spelled SPECIAL
    COLOUR.
  - BUG FIX: Apply minor Debian cleanups reported by Kurt B. Kaiser.

    output. Note that UTF-8 strings are still not supported in

    output
  - you can have multiple TAG clauses in a REM statement
  - avoid spawning long-running background processes in "make
    test"

    compilers choke.)

    in earlier versions of Remind.
  - Yom HaShoah is moved to Thursday if it would normally fall on
    a Friday. Thanks to Jonathan Kamens for pointing this out.

    special variables to make reminder files less wordy. See man page
    for details.
  - Ignore msgprefix() and msgsuffix() on RUN-type reminders.
  - Adjust Remind and Rem2PS so that SHADE specials don't obliterate
    earlier MOON specials.
