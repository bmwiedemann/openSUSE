Mon Nov 12 07:45:44 UTC 2018 - Karol Babioch <kbabioch@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.3.15
    This is a maintenance release that fixes some bugs, e.g. in the Botan
    support of functions from module mpz_srandom. Moreover, some interfaces
    of the OpenPGP implemenation have been added and removed. For some
    modules of LibTMCG a basic exception handling has been introduced.

- Update to version 1.3.14
    With this release three additional parameters for the control of secure
    memory allocation have been added to init_libTMCG(). They are explained
    in the reference manual. Moreover, the OpenPGP interface has been
    enhanced in several way, e.g., ECDH, ECDSA and EdDSA are supported now.
