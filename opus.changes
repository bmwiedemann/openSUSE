Thu Apr 20 21:00:25 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.4:
  * Improved tuning of the Opus in-band FEC (LBRR). See the
    https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/opus/-/issues/2360 for details
  * Added a OPUS_SET_INBAND_FEC(2) option that turns on FEC, but
    does not force SILK mode (FEC will be disabled in CELT mode)
  * Improved tuning and various fixes to DTX
  * Added Meson support, improved CMake support
- Change Source to new home on github.
- Use autosetup, make_build and ldconfig_scriptlets macros.
- Move AUTHORS and README docs to devel package.
- Drop patches fixed upstream:
  * opus-Fix-celt-decoder-assertion-when-using-OPUS_CUSTOM.patch
  * opus-Silk-CNG-adapts-faster.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 15 17:38:39 UTC 2020 - Gustavo Pichorim Boiko <gboiko@suse.com>

- Backport of an upstream fix for celt decoder:
  * opus-Fix-celt-decoder-assertion-when-using-OPUS_CUSTOM.patch: When
    using OPUS_CUSTOM, `CELTDecoder->end` can be larger than 21.
    Assert against 25 instead in OPUS_CUSTOM builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 15 17:37:36 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add 2 upstream bug fixes for Silk:

    coeffs beyond the given order in NEON optimizations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  8 11:02:43 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Own %{_datadir}/aclocal: when we might switch to pkgconf instead
  of pkg-config, nothing in the build root is 'accidentally' owning
  this directory for us.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 25 08:29:45 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 1.3.1
  * This release fixes an issue with the analysis on files with
    digital silence (all zeros), especially on x87 builds
    (mostly affects 32-bit builds).
  * Two new features:
    + A new OPUS_GET_IN_DTX query to know if the encoder is in
      DTX mode (last frame was either a comfort noise frame or
      not encoded at all)
    + A new (and still experimental) CMake-based build system
      that is eventually meant to replace the VS2015 build
      system (the autotools one will stay).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 18 22:33:04 CEST 2018 - mcepl@suse.com

- Update to version 1.2.1:

    signal is SWB instead of FB, lowpassing the signal. This patch
    makes the encoder much more careful about doing that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 21:56:12 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Cleanup with spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Removed static package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 28 18:54:56 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

  + A specially-crafted Opus packet could cause an integer
    wrap-around in the SILK LSF stabilization code. This would
    cause an out-of-bounds read 256 bytes before a constant table.
- Drop opus-NLSF-not-negative.patch: Fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 16 20:56:54 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

  + Resetting the encoder or decoder state with OPUS_RESET_STATE
    would disable some run-time selected architecture-specific
    optimizations.
  + In hybrid mode discontinuous transmission (DTX) operation,
    the comfort noise above 8 kHz was incorrectly estimated
    and could oscillate in time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
