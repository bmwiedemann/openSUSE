                         Vipul's Razor v2
              SUSE-SPECIFIC Installation Instructions

[[ LEFT OUT STEPS 1 THROUGH 4 AS THIS IS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU BY THE
   PACKAGE MAINTAINER ]] 

5. Run `razor-admin -create' to create a default config file in your
   home directory under /home/user/.razor. (Remember to change user to
   your username from root before running razor-admin)

6. Razor v2 requires reporters to be registered so their reputations can
   be computed over time and they can participate in the revocation
   mechanism. Registration is done with razor-admin -register. It has to be
   manually invoked in either of the following ways:

    To register user foo with `s1kret' as password:

            razor-admin -register -user=foo -pass=s1kr3t

    To register with an email address and have the password assigned:

            razor-admin -register -user=foo@bar.com

    To have both (random) username and password assigned:

            razor-admin -register

    razor-admin -register negotiates a registration with the Nomination Server
    and writes the identity information in
    /home/user/.razor/identity-username, or /etc/razor/identity-username
    when invoked as root.

7. You can edit razor-agent.conf to change the defaults. Config options
   and their values are defined in the razor-agent.conf(5) manpage.

8. The next step is to integrate razor-check, razor-report and
   razor-revoke in your mail system. If you are running Razor v1, the
   change will be transparent, new versions of razor agents will overwrite
   the old ones. You would still need to plugin razor-revoke in your MUA,
   since it's a new addition in Razor v2. If you are not running Razor v1,
   refer to manpages of razor-check(1), razor-report(1), and
   razor-revoke(1) for integration instructions.
