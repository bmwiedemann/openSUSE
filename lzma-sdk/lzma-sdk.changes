    64-bit to 128-bit, and the pseudo-random number generator was
    improved.
  * The bug in 7zIn.c code was fixed.

- Update to version 18.06
  * The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased by 3-10%,
    and there are minor changes in compression ratio.
  * Some bugs were fixed.
  * The bug in 7-Zip 18.02-18.05 was fixed:
    There was memory leak in multithreading xz decoder -
    XzDecMt_Decode(), if xz stream contains only one block.
  * The changes for MSVS compiler makefiles:
    + the makefiles now use "PLATFORM" macroname with values
      (x64, x86, arm64) instead of "CPU" macroname with values
      (AMD64, ARM64).
    + the makefiles by default now use static version of the
      run-time library.
