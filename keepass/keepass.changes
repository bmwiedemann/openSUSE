- Update to 2.39

- Update to 2.37
  New features:
  * When creating a new database, KeePass now offers to print a
    KeePass emergency sheet (which can then be filled out and
    stored in a secure location, where only the user and possibly
    a few other people that the user trusts have access to);

    when creating a new database.
  * Added function to search similar password clusters

    of the AES algorithm for encrypting data, which is a bit faster.
  * Improved tool strip checkmark rendering on Unix-like systems.

- update to 2.31 (2016-01-09)
  - Added menu/toolbar styles, freely selectable in 'Tools' ->
    'Options' -> tab 'Interface'; available styles are 'Windows
    10', 'Windows 8.1', 'KeePass - Gradient', '.NET/Office -
    Professional' and 'System - Classic'; by default KeePass uses
    the style most similar to the one of the current operating
    system
  - Refined application icons (thanks to Victor Andreyenkov)
  - Auto-Type: new target window classification method, which
    improves compatibility with target windows hosted within
    other windows (e.g. a PuTTY window within SuperPuTTY/MTPuTTY)
  - Auto-Type: added workaround for the default Ctrl+Alt behavior
    of KiTTY variants (which differs from Windows' behavior)
  - Before clearing the clipboard, KeePass now first copies a
    non-sensitive text into it; this ensures that no sensitive
    information remains in the clipboard even when clearing is
    prevented by the environment (e.g. when running in a virtual
    machine, when using a clipboard extension utility, ...)
  - Added support for opening entry URLs with Internet Explorer
    or Google Chrome in private mode via the context menu ->
    'URL(s)' -> 'Open with ... (Private)'

  - Mozilla Bookmarks HTML import: added support for importing
    tags

  - Windows/IE favorites export: entry fields are Spr-compiled
    now, and entries with cmd:// URLs are now exported as LNK
    files
  - HTML export/printing: added support for UUIDs, added

    background color for group headings, long field names are
    hyphenated now, and long field data now breaks and wraps onto
    the next line
  - Plugins: added possibility to configure file transactions for
    each URI scheme
  - Plugins: added possibility to provide custom 'Save As'
    dialogs more easily
  - Converted some PNG images as a workaround for a problem in
    Cairo/LibPNG on Unix-like systems
  - As a workaround for a weakness in Mono's FileDialog, before
    showing such a dialog on Unix-like systems KeePass now tries
    to load the file '~/.recently-used' and deletes it, if it is
    not a valid XML file
  - KPScript: added support for specifying the master password in
    encrypted form using the '-pw-enc:' command line parameter
    (exactly like in KeePass, compatible with the {PASSWORD_ENC}
    placeholder)
  - KPScript: the 'Export' command now supports the optional
    '-GroupPath:' parameter (to export a specific group instead
    of the whole database)
  - KPScript: the 'GetEntryString' command now supports the
    '-FailIfNoEntry' option
  - KPScript: added '-refx-Expires' and '-refx-Expired' entry

    messages

    and SHA-256

    window changes during an auto-type process
  - Auto-Type: improved compatibility with Remote Desktop
    Connection client and VirtualBox
  - Improved icon recoloring
  - Improved printing of dates/times and tags
  - The password generator based on a character set now ensures
    that the generated password is Spr-invariant
  - Password generator based on a pattern or a custom algorithm:
    when a Spr-variant password is generated, a confirmation
    dialog for accepting this password is displayed
  - If the 'Save Database' policy prevents saving, the auto-save
    option is now ignored
  - Improved .NET Framework version detection
  - PLGX debugging: when the command line option '-debug' is
    passed and a PLGX plugin fails to compile, the output of all
    tried compilers is saved to a temporary file
  - Improved file transaction creation time handling on Unix-like
    systems
  - Improved compatibility with Mono on BSD systems
  - Enhanced PrepMonoDev.sh script for compatibility with Mono
    4.x
  - Removed KeePassLibSD sub-project (a KeePass library for
    Pocket PC / Windows Mobile) from the main solution
  - Upgraded installer
  - Various code optimizations
  - Minor other improvements
  
  - When running under Mono (Linux, Mac OS X, ...), two options
    related to window minimization are disabled now (because they
    do not work properly due to a Mono bug)

    value reference elements
  - Plugins: added two auto-type sequence query events

    now disabled (because Mono doesn't implement the required

    full path of a group)

    default
