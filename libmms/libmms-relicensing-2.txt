[xine-devel] LibMMS continued
From: Mathrick <mnews2@wp...> - 2004-02-18 13:06
OK, now that libmms has been finally started, there are some things that
still need to be resolved. There were few people I haven't been able to
contact, namely:

Stephen Torri
Robin Kay

I'll be grateful if someone could give me working way of contacting
them, I hope this list will be enough :) (Robin's mailbox doesn't seem
to like either my ISP or Sourceforge alias, accusing them of spamming
incidents).
All others I asked agreed for relicensing (thanks guys! :D).

Now, for current issues:
We're currently cleaning source up to make it independent of xine-lib,
however mms.c includes demuxers/asfheader.h for some needed ASF defines.
My question is: is it okay for us to just copy it over under LGPL and
change accordingly? Most of it is taken almost verbatim from specs
anyway, I'm just not particularly fond of redoing all that work,
byteswapping macros were already stupid enough ;).
That's all for now, I will ask more if need arises.

Cheers,
Maciej
