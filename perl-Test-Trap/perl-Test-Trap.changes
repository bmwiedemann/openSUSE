  0.3.4	Sun Oct 14 20:39:41 CEST 2018
  	For this release, many thanks go to Todd Rinaldo, who found
          that my fix for the $^E clobbering wound up clobbering $! in
          every basic test.
          - Declared some required and optional dependencies.
          - RT #127112 is addressed, using the patch from TODDR@cpan.org
            augmented wtih a comment.
          - A regression test has been added for this.

  0.3.3   Tue Aug 22 02:06:09 CEST 2017
  	For this release, many thanks go to Slaven Rezic, who found
          that Test::More::is() (or Test2::Formatter::TAP::write())
          clobbers $^E on Windows.
          - RT #105125 is addressed:  The tests now use a copy of $^E
            taken before Test::More gets a chance to touch it.
  	- Further, the Test::Trap test methods might also clobber $^E
            (via Test::More or other modules), so they now localize $^E
            before invoking the callback.
          - Regression tests have been added for this.

   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Test-Trap/Changes

  0.3.2	Tue Feb 24 00:19:23 CET 2015
          The tempfile-preserve strategy was (always) broken on
          non-perlio perls.
          Also, some of the tests were (recently) noisy on old perls.
          Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile:
          - add a GOTPERLIO guard to each IO_LAYERS block.
          Tests:
          - 03-files.pl now avoid "used only once" warnings.
  
  0.3.1	Mon Feb 23 21:43:30 CET 2015
  	This release doesn't touch library code, but addresses some
  	test issues:
          - It fixes RT #102271 by checking for the presence of a
  	  utf8-layer on the original STDOUT, instead of assuming its
  	  absence.
          - It makes some test code cleaner.
          - It silences redefine warnings during testing on certain
  	  platforms.
          Library files: No change but version bump.
          Tests:
          - 03-files* now use another global to specify the class to
            require, replacing a quick-and-dirty hack that turned out to
            be noisy on some platforms, including Cygwin.
          - {15-tempfile,16-systemsafe}-options.t now check for the
            presence of utf8-layer on STDOUT, instead of assuming its
            absence.  (Either of the environment variables PERL_UNICODE
            and PERL5OPT could cause such a layer to be present, and
            there might be other ways to do it.)
  
  0.3.0	Thu Dec 18 21:57:51 CET 2014
  	This release, in brief:
          - improves clarity through nomenclature:
                * renames "(output layer) backend implementation" to
                  "(capture) strategy", for more standard nomenclature
                  (and less of a mouthful);
                * renames "pseudo-layer" to "multi-layer" (if so
                  declared) or "non-trapping layer" (neither is a direct
                  analogue to PerlIO pseudo layers, so the nomenclature
                  was misleading);
          - adds (import) options to the TempFile and SystemSafe capture
  	  strategy factories, allowing for different ways to handle
  	  PerlIO layers;
          - using these for two new standard capture strategies,
            "tempfile-preserve" and "systemsafe-preserve"; and
          - fixes a bug in SystemSafe.
          And, in more detail ...
          Test::Trap::Builder:
          - Changes method names per the nomenclature changes, leaving
            back-compat aliases behind.
          - Changes error message per the nomenclature changes.  (No
            back-compat possible, sorry.)
          - Updates the documentation.
          Test::Trap::Builder::{TempFile,SystemSafe}:
          - Import now takes arguments:
  		strategy name (default {"tempfile","systemsafe"}); and
                  strategy options (default empty hash).
          - The following options are supported:
  		preserve_io_layers (boolean; default false); and
          	io_layers (colon-separated string; default unset).
          Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe:
          - Fixes a bug where the original perlio layers were not
  	  restored after the trap was sprung.
          Test::Trap::Builder::{PerlIO,TempFile,SystemSafe}:
          - Updates the code in accordance with Test::Trap::Builder
            changes; see above.
          - Updates the documentation.
          Test::Trap:
          - Imports new capture strategy, "tempfile-preserve", from
            TempFile with option preserve_io_layers.
          - Imports new capture strategy, "systemsafe-preserve", from
            SystemSafe with option preserve_io_layers.
          - Updates the code in accordance with Test::Trap::Builder
            changes; see above.
          - Updates the documentation.
          Tests:
          - changes variable names and comments in accordance with
            nomenclature changes;
          - adds tests for the no-restore bug in t/03-files.pl (hence
            for each tested strategy);
          - adds t/03-files-{tempfile,systemsafe}-preserve.t to run the
            basic tests against the new capture strategies;
          - accounts for the changed error message in t/06-layers.t;
          - adds t/{15-tempfile,16-systemsafe}-options.t to check
            capture strategies of varying options.
  
  0.2.5	Sun Nov 16 18:31:42 CET 2014
  	This release localizes $! (ERRNO) for internal operations that
  	change it, as suggested by Felipe Gasper.  For the same
  	operations, it also localizes $^E (extended OS error).
          Library files:
          - Localize $! and $^E for internal operations that change them.
          Tests:
          - Check that bare test blocks leave $!, %!, and $^E unchanged,
            but that blocks that modify $! and $^E still do so.
          Also:
          - Added Module::Build to the configure_requires.
          - Fix emacs mode line on t/14-leaks.t.
          - Better comments in lib/Test/Trap/Builder.pm.
  
  0.2.4	Sun Mar 30 10:02:16 CEST 2014
  	This release fixes a memory leak with the default tempfile
  	backend layer implementation for trapping output.  The
  	systemsafe alternative backend had the same kind of leak, and
  	has also been fixed.  (The perlio alternative backend was not
  	affected.)
          Thanks go again to Felipe Gasper for discovering this!
          Test::Trap::Builder:
          - Add a method ExceptionFunction to make it easier to avoid
            circular references arising from registered closures.
            Document and export this method.
          Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile:
          - Break a circular reference chain.
          Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe:
          - Break a similar but slightly more complicated circular
            reference chain.
          Tests:
          - Added t/14-leaks.t to check that the reference count is as
            expected, at least with trivial code and standard setup for
            all three output layer backends.
          Also:
          - Use ebhanssen@cpan.org for my email address.
          - Update copyright years.
          - Update MANIFEST.SKIP &c for use of git (goodbye subversion).
  
  0.2.3   Mon Dec 30 14:46:15 CET 2013
          Library files:
          - RT #87263: typo fixes, courtesy dsteinbrunner@pobox.com.
          - Localize the trap coderef, so that it does not hold on to
            what it closes over, creating stale references, but lets
            them go out of scope; thanks go to Felipe Gasper.
          Documentation:
          - Some clarification for RT #91687: Wrong exit code after die.
          Tests:
          - Regression test for the stale references.
