# Go 1.22 development Container Image

![Redistributable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Redistributable-Yes-green)


## Description

[Go](https://go.dev/) (a.k.a., Golang) is a statically-typed programming language, with syntax loosely derived from C. Go offers additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, certain dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types (for example, variable-length arrays and key-value maps) as well as a large standard library.

## Usage

To compile and deploy an application, copy the sources, fetch dependencies (assuming go.mod is used for dependency management), and build the binary:

```Dockerfile
# Build the application using the Go 1.22 development Container Image
FROM registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/bci/golang:1.22 as build

WORKDIR /app

# pre-copy/cache go.mod for pre-downloading dependencies and only redownloading them in subsequent builds if they change
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download && go mod verify

COPY . ./

# Make sure to build the application with CGO disabled.
# This will force Go to use some Go implementations of code
# rather than those normally supplied by the host operating system.
# You need this for scratch images as those supporting libraries
# are not available.
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /hello

# Bundle the application into a scratch image
FROM scratch

COPY --from=build /hello /hello

CMD ["/hello"]
```

Build and run the container image:

```ShellSession
$ podman build -t my-golang-app .
$ podman run -it --rm my-golang-app
```

There are situations when you don't want to run an application inside a container.

To compile the application, without running it inside a container instance, use the following command:

```ShellSession
$ podman run --rm -v "$PWD":/app:Z -w /app registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/bci/golang:1.22 go build -v
```

To run the application tests inside a container, use the following command:

```ShellSession
$ podman run --rm -v "$PWD":/app:Z -w /app registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/bci/golang:1.22 go test -v
```

**Note:** The Golang image should be used as a build environment. For runtime, self-contained Go binaries should use a `scratch` image and for applications that require external dependencies use the `bci-base` image.

## Additional tools

The following additional tools are included in the image:

- go1.22-race
- make
- git-core
