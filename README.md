This repo is a public read-only git mirror of openSUSE sources
from [build.opensuse.org](https://build.opensuse.org/).

Advantages are:

* easy to do full-text search
* offline access to history
* Git blame is fast, both online and offline.
* distributed repo
* increased visibility of changes
* also tracks prjconf changes
* ability to download patch files
* cryptograpically signed commits to impede tampering with history
* even works on Thursdays (when we do maintenance of our infrastructure)
* does not carry tarballs and other large binaries, so the whole repo is still below 7GB
