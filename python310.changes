  gh#python/cpython#97950
- Update to 3.10.13 (bsc#1214692):
  - gh-108310: Fixed an issue where instances of ssl.SSLSocket were
    vulnerable to a bypass of the TLS handshake and included
    protections (like certificate verification) and treating sent
    unencrypted data as if it were post-handshake TLS encrypted data.
    Security issue reported as CVE-2023-40217 by Aapo Oksman. Patch by
    Gregory P. Smith.
  - gh-107845: tarfile.data_filter() now takes the location of

- (bsc#1210638, CVE-2023-27043) Add
  CVE-2023-27043-email-parsing-errors.patch, which detects email
  address parsing errors and returns empty tuple to indicate the
  parsing error (old API).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 28 16:57:46 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.12:
  - gh-103142: The version of OpenSSL used in Windows and
    Mac installers has been upgraded to 1.1.1u to address
    CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-0465, CVE-2023-0466, CVE-2023-0464,

    location in directory indexes produced by
    http.client.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.
  - gh-103935: trace.__main__ now uses io.open_code() for files
    to be executed instead of raw open().
  - gh-102953: The extraction methods in tarfile, and
    shutil.unpack_archive(), have a new filter argument that
    allows limiting tar features than may be surprising or
    dangerous, such as creating files outside the destination
    directory. See Extraction filters for details (fixing
    CVE-2007-4559, bsc#1203750).
- Remove upstreamed patches:
  - CVE-2023-24329-blank-URL-bypass.patch
  - CVE-2007-4559-filter-tarfile_extractall.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 27 21:19:52 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.11:
  - Core and Builtins

      deeply nested filter objects. Patch by Marta Gómez Macías.
    - gh-102397: Fix segfault from race condition in signal
      handling during garbage collection. Patch by Kumar Aditya.

    - gh-101961: For the binary mode, fileinput.hookcompressed()
      doesn’t set the encoding value even if the value is
      None. Patch by Gihwan Kim.
    - gh-101936: The default value of fp becomes io.BytesIO
      if HTTPError is initialized without a designated fp
      parameter. Patch by Long Vo.
    - gh-101566: In zipfile, apply fix for extractall on the
      underlying zipfile after being wrapped in Path.
    - gh-101997: Upgrade pip wheel bundled with ensurepip (pip
      23.0.1)

      had a bug where it reported unauthenticated EOFs (i.e.
      without close_notify) as a clean TLS-level EOF. It now
      raises SSLEOFError, matching the behavior in previous
      versions of OpenSSL. The options attribute on SSLContext
      also no longer includes OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF by
      default. This option may be set to specify the previous
      OpenSSL 3.0 behavior.

- Add invalid-json.patch fixing invalid JSON in
  Doc/howto/logging-cookbook.rst (somehow similar to
  gh#python/cpython#102582).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  1 20:59:04 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.10:
  Bug fixes and regressions handling, no change of behaviour and
  no security bugs fixed.
- Add CVE-2023-24329-blank-URL-bypass.patch (CVE-2023-24329,
  bsc#1208471) blocklists bypass via the urllib.parse component
  when supplying a URL that starts with blank characters

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 21 11:34:49 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add provides for readline and sqlite3 to the main Python
  package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 15:00:21 UTC 2023 - Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk@suse.com>

- Disable NIS for new products, it's deprecated and gets removed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  8 14:42:15 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.9:
  - python -m http.server no longer allows terminal
    control characters sent within a garbage request to be
    printed to the stderr server lo This is done by changing
    the http.server BaseHTTPRequestHandler .log_message method
    to replace control characters with a \xHH hex escape before
    printin
  - Avoid publishing list of active per-interpreter
    audit hooks via the gc module
  - The IDNA codec decoder used on DNS hostnames by
    socket or asyncio related name resolution functions no
    longer involves a quadratic algorithm. This prevents a
    potential CPU denial of service if an out-of-spec excessive
    length hostname involving bidirectional characters were
    decoded. Some protocols such as urllib http 3xx redirects
    potentially allow for an attacker to supply such a name.
  - Update bundled libexpat to 2.5.0
  - Port XKCP’s fix for the buffer overflows in SHA-3
    (CVE-2022-37454).
  - On Linux the multiprocessing module returns
    to using filesystem backed unix domain sockets for
    communication with the forkserver process instead of the
    Linux abstract socket namespace. Only code that chooses
    to use the “forkserver” start method is affected Abstract
    sockets have no permissions and could allow any user
    on the system in the same network namespace (often the
    whole system) to inject code into the multiprocessing
    forkserver process. This was a potential privilege
    escalation. Filesystem based socket permissions restrict
    this to the forkserver process user as was the default in
    Python 3.8 and earlier This prevents Linux CVE-2022-42919
  - Fix a reference bug in _imp.create_builtin()
    after the creation of the first sub-interpreter for modules
    builtins and sys. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing a buffer overflow if
    the tokenizer copies a line missing the newline caracter
    from a file that is as long as the available tokenizer
    buffer. Patch by Pablo galindo
  - Update faulthandler to emit an error message with
    the proper unexpected signal number. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Fix subscription of types.GenericAlias instances
    containing bare generic types: for example tuple[A, T][int],
    where A is a generic type, and T is a type variable.
  - Fix detection of MAC addresses for uuid on certain
    OSs. Patch by Chaim Sanders
  - Print exception class name instead of its string
    representation when raising errors from ctypes calls.
  - Allow pdb to locate source for frozen modules in
    the standard library.
  - Raise ValueError instead of SystemError when
    methods of uninitialized io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder objects
    are called. Patch by Oren Milman.
  - Fix a possible assertion failure in io.FileIO when
    the opener returns an invalid file descriptor.
  - Also escape s in the http.server
    BaseHTTPRequestHandler.log_message so that it is technically
    possible to parse the line and reconstruct what the original
    data was. Without this a xHH is ambiguious as to if it is a
    hex replacement we put in or the characters r”x” came through
    in the original request line.
  - asyncio.get_event_loop() now only emits a
    deprecation warning when a new event loop was created
    implicitly. It no longer emits a deprecation warning if the
    current event loop was set.
  - Fix bug when calling trace.CoverageResults with
    valid infile.
  - Fix a bug in handling class cleanups in
    unittest.TestCase. Now addClassCleanup() uses separate lists
    for different TestCase subclasses, and doClassCleanups() only
    cleans up the particular class.
  - Release the GIL when calling termios APIs to avoid
    blocking threads.
  - Fix ast.increment_lineno() to also cover
    ast.TypeIgnore when changing line numbers.
  - Fixed bug where inspect.signature() reported
    incorrect arguments for decorated methods.
  - Fix SystemError in ctypes when exception was not
    set during __initsubclass__.
  - Fix statistics.NormalDist pickle with 0 and 1
    protocols.
  - Update the bundled copy of pip to version 22.3.1.
  - Apply bugfixes from importlib_metadata 4.11.4,
    namely: In PathDistribution._name_from_stem, avoid
    including parts of the extension in the result. In
    PathDistribution._normalized_name, ensure names loaded from
    the stem of the filename are also normalized, ensuring
    duplicate entry points by packages varying only by
    non-normalized name are hidden.
  - Clean up refleak on failed module initialisation in
    _zoneinfo
  - Clean up refleaks on failed module initialisation
    in in _pickle
  - Clean up refleak on failed module initialisation in
    _io.
  - Fix memory leak in math.dist() when both points
    don’t have the same dimension. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix argument typechecks in _overlapped.WSAConnect()
    and _overlapped.Overlapped.WSASendTo() functions.
  - Fix internal error in the re module which in
    very rare circumstances prevented compilation of a regular
    expression containing a conditional expression without the
    “else” branch.
  - Fix asyncio.StreamWriter.drain() to call
    protocol.connection_lost callback only once on Windows.
  - Add a mutex to unittest.mock.NonCallableMock to
    protect concurrent access to mock attributes.
  - Fix hang on Windows in subprocess.wait_closed() in
    asyncio with ProactorEventLoop. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix infinite loop in unittest when a
    self-referencing chained exception is raised
  - tkinter.Text.count() raises now an exception for
    options starting with “-” instead of silently ignoring them.
  - On uname_result, restored expectation that _fields
    and _asdict would include all six properties including
    processor.
  - Update the bundled copies of pip and setuptools to
    versions 22.3 and 65.5.0 respectively.
  - Fix bug in urllib.parse.urlparse() that causes
    certain port numbers containing whitespace, underscores,
    plus and minus signs, or non-ASCII digits to be incorrectly
    accepted.
  - Allow venv to pass along PYTHON* variables to
    ensurepip and pip when they do not impact path resolution
  - On macOS, fix a crash in syslog.syslog() in
    multi-threaded applications. On macOS, the libc syslog()
    function is not thread-safe, so syslog.syslog() no longer
    releases the GIL to call it. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Allow BUILTINS to be a valid field name for frozen
    dataclasses.
  - Make sure patch.dict() can be applied on async
    functions.
  - To avoid apparent memory leaks when
    asyncio.open_connection() raises, break reference cycles
    generated by local exception and future instances (which has
    exception instance as its member var). Patch by Dong Uk,
    Kang.
  - Prevent error when activating venv in nested fish
    instances.
  - Restrict use of sockets instead of pipes for stdin
    of subprocesses created by asyncio to AIX platform only.
  - shutil.copytree() now applies the
    ignore_dangling_symlinks argument recursively.
  - Fix IndexError in argparse.ArgumentParser when a
    store_true action is given an explicit argument.
  - Document that calling variadic functions with
    ctypes requires special care on macOS/arm64 (and possibly
    other platforms).
  - Skip test_normalization() of test_unicodedata
    if it fails to download NormalizationTest.txt file from
    pythontest.net. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Some C API tests were moved into the new
    Lib/test/test_capi/ directory.
  - Fix -Wimplicit-int, -Wstrict-prototypes, and
    -Wimplicit-function-declaration compiler warnings in
    configure checks.
  - Fix -Wimplicit-int compiler warning in configure
    check for PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM.
  - Specify the full path to the source location for
    make docclean (needed for cross-builds).
  - Fix NO_MISALIGNED_ACCESSES being not defined
    for the SHA3 extension when HAVE_ALIGNED_REQUIRED is
    set. Allowing builds on hardware that unaligned memory
    accesses are not allowed.
  - Fix handling of module docstrings in
    Tools/i18n/pygettext.py.

    the integer overflow when the new allocated length is close
    to the maximum size.
  - Fix a shell code injection vulnerability in the

    longer uses a shell to run openssl commands. (originally
    filed as CVE-2022-37460, later withdrawn)
  - Fix command line parsing: reject -X int_max_str_digits option
    with no value (invalid) when the PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS
    environment variable is set to a valid limit.
  - When ValueError is raised if an integer is larger than the
    limit, mention the sys.set_int_max_str_digits() function in
    the error message.
  - The deprecated mailcap module now refuses to inject unsafe
    text (filenames, MIME types, parameters) into shell
    commands. Instead of using such text, it will warn and act
    as if a match was not found (or for test commands, as if the
    test failed).
  - os.sched_yield() now release the GIL while calling
    sched_yield(2).
  - Bugfix: PyFunction_GetAnnotations() should return a borrowed
    reference. It was returning a new reference.
  - Fixed a missing incref/decref pair in
    Exception.__setstate__().
  - Fix overly-broad source position information for chained
    comparisons used as branching conditions.
  - Fix undefined behaviour in _testcapimodule.c.
  - At Python exit, sometimes a thread holding the GIL can
    wait forever for a thread (usually a daemon thread) which
    requested to drop the GIL, whereas the thread already
    exited. To fix the race condition, the thread which requested
    the GIL drop now resets its request before exiting.
  - Fix a possible assertion failure, fatal error, or SystemError
    if a line tracing event raises an exception while opcode
    tracing is enabled.
  - Fix undefined behaviour in C code of null pointer arithmetic.
  - Do not expose KeyWrapper in _functools.
  - When loading a file with invalid UTF-8 inside a multi-line
    string, a correct SyntaxError is emitted.
  - Disable incorrect pickling of the C implemented classmethod
    descriptors.
  - Fix AttributeError missing name and obj attributes in       .
    object.__getattribute__() bpo-42316: Document some places   .
    where an assignment expression needs parentheses            .
  - Wrap network errors consistently in urllib FTP support, so
    the test suite doesn’t fail when a network is available but
    the public internet is not reachable.
  - Fixes AttributeError when subprocess.check_output() is used
    with argument input=None and either of the arguments encoding
    or errors are used.
  - Avoid spurious tracebacks from asyncio when default executor
    cleanup is delayed until after the event loop is closed (e.g.
    as the result of a keyboard interrupt).
  - Avoid a crash in the C version of
    asyncio.Future.remove_done_callback() when an evil argument
    is passed.
  - Remove tokenize.NL check from tabnanny.
  - Make Semaphore run faster.
  - Fix generation of the default name of
    tkinter.Checkbutton. Previously, checkbuttons in different
    parent widgets could have the same short name and share
    the same state if arguments “name” and “variable” are not
    specified. Now they are globally unique.
  - Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.9
  - Fix race condition in asyncio where process_exited() called
    before the pipe_data_received() leading to inconsistent
    output.
  - Fixed check in multiprocessing.resource_tracker that
    guarantees that the length of a write to a pipe is not
    greater than PIPE_BUF.
  - Corrected type annotation for dataclass attribute
    pstats.FunctionProfile.ncalls to be str.
  - Fix the faulthandler implementation of
    faulthandler.register(signal, chain=True) if the sigaction()
    function is not available: don’t call the previous signal
    handler if it’s NULL.
  - In inspect, fix overeager replacement of “typing.” in
    formatting annotations.
  - Fix asyncio.streams.StreamReaderProtocol to keep a strong
    reference to the created task, so that it’s not garbage
    collected
  - Fix handling compiler warnings (SyntaxWarning and
    DeprecationWarning) in codeop.compile_command() when checking
    for incomplete input. Previously it emitted warnings and
    raised a SyntaxError. Now it always returns None for
    incomplete input without emitting any warnings.
  - Fixed flickering of the turtle window when the tracer is
    turned off.
  - Allow asyncio.StreamWriter.drain() to be awaited concurrently
    by multiple tasks.
  - Fix broken asyncio.Semaphore when acquire is cancelled.
  - Fix ast.unparse() when ImportFrom.level is None
  - Improve performance of urllib.request.getproxies_environment
    when there are many environment variables
  - Fix ! in c domain ref target syntax via a conf.py patch, so
    it works as intended to disable ref target resolution.
  - Clarified the conflicting advice given in the ast
    documentation about ast.literal_eval() being “safe” for use
    on untrusted input while at the same time warning that it
    can crash the process. The latter statement is true and is
    deemed unfixable without a large amount of work unsuitable
    for a bugfix. So we keep the warning and no longer claim that
    literal_eval is safe.
  - Update tutorial introduction output to use 3.10+ SyntaxError
    invalid range.
- Remove upstreamed test-int-timing.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 11 08:32:53 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.7:
  - Fix for CVE-2020-10735 (bsc#1203125) Converting between int
    and str in bases other than 2 (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16
    (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base 10 (decimal) now raises
    a ValueError if the number of digits in string form is above
    a limit to avoid potential denial of service attacks due to
    the algorithmic complexity.
  - Other bug fixes:
    - Fixed a bug that caused _PyCode_GetExtra to return garbage
      for negative indexes.
    - Fix format string in _PyPegen_raise_error_known_location
      that can lead to memory corruption on some 64bit systems.
      The function was building a tuple with i (int) instead of
      n (Py_ssize_t) for Py_ssize_t arguments.
    - Fix misleading contents of error message when converting an
      all-whitespace string to float.
    - coroutine.throw() now properly initializes the frame.f_back
      when resuming a stack of coroutines. This allows e.g.
      traceback.print_stack() to work correctly when an exception
      (such as CancelledError) is thrown into a coroutine.
    - ast.parse() will no longer parse function definitions with
      positional-only params when passed feature_version less
      than (3, 8).
    - Correct conversion of numbers.Rational’s to float.
    - Fix a performance regression in logging
      TimedRotatingFileHandler. Only check for special files when
      the rollover time has passed.
    - Fix unused localName parameter in the Attr class in
      xml.dom.minidom.
    - Update bundled pip to 22.2.2.
    - Fail gracefully if EPERM or ENOSYS is raised when loading
      crypt methods. This may happen when trying to load MD5 on
      a Linux kernel with FIPS enabled.
    - Improve discoverability of the higher level
      concurrent.futures module by providing clearer links from
      the lower level threading and multiprocessing modules.
    - Update the default RFC base URL from deprecated
      tools.ietf.org to datatracker.ietf.org
    - Fix stylesheet not working in Windows CHM htmlhelp docs.
    - The documentation now lists which members of C structs are
      part of the Limited API/Stable ABI.
    - Mitigate the inherent race condition from using
      find_unused_port() in testSockName() by trying to find an
      unused port a few times before failing.
    - Build and test with OpenSSL 1.1.1q
    - Document handling of extensions in Save As dialogs.
    - Include prompts when saving Shell (interactive input and
      output).

- Update to 3.10.5:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-93418: Fixed an assert where an f-string has an equal
      sign ‘=’ following an expression, but there’s no trailing
      brace. For example, f”{i=”.
    - gh-91924: Fix __ltrace__ debug feature if the stdout
      encoding is not UTF-8. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-93061: Backward jumps after async for loops are no
      longer given dubious line numbers.
    - gh-93065: Fix contextvars HAMT implementation to handle
      iteration over deep trees.
    - The bug was discovered and fixed by Eli Libman. See
      MagicStack/immutables#84 for more details.
    - gh-92311: Fixed a bug where setting frame.f_lineno to jump
      over a list comprehension could misbehave or crash.
    - gh-92112: Fix crash triggered by an evil custom mro() on
      a metaclass.
    - gh-92036: Fix a crash in subinterpreters related to the
      garbage collector. When a subinterpreter is deleted,
      untrack all objects tracked by its GC. To prevent a crash
      in deallocator functions expecting objects to be tracked by
      the GC, leak a strong reference to these objects on
      purpose, so they are never deleted and their deallocator
      functions are not called. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-91421: Fix a potential integer overflow in
      _Py_DecodeUTF8Ex.
    - bpo-47212: Raise IndentationError instead of SyntaxError
      for a bare except with no following indent. Improve
      SyntaxError locations for an un-parenthesized generator
      used as arguments. Patch by Matthieu Dartiailh.
    - bpo-47182: Fix a crash when using a named unicode character
      like "\N{digit nine}" after the main interpreter has been
      initialized a second time.
    - bpo-47117: Fix a crash if we fail to decode characters in
      interactive mode if the tokenizer buffers are
      uninitialized. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - bpo-39829: Removed the __len__() call when initializing
      a list and moved initializing to list_extend. Patch by
      Jeremiah Pascual.
    - bpo-46962: Classes and functions that unconditionally
      declared their docstrings ignoring the
      --without-doc-strings compilation flag no longer do so.
    - The classes affected are ctypes.UnionType,
      pickle.PickleBuffer, testcapi.RecursingInfinitelyError, and
      types.GenericAlias.
    - The functions affected are 24 methods in ctypes.
    - Patch by Oleg Iarygin.
    - bpo-36819: Fix crashes in built-in encoders with error
      handlers that return position less or equal than the
      starting position of non-encodable characters.
  - Library
    - gh-93156: Accessing the pathlib.PurePath.parents sequence
      of an absolute path using negative index values produced
      incorrect results.
    - gh-89973: Fix re.error raised in fnmatch if the pattern
      contains a character range with upper bound lower than
      lower bound (e.g. [c-a]). Now such ranges are interpreted
      as empty ranges.
    - gh-93010: In a very special case, the email package tried
      to append the nonexistent InvalidHeaderError to the defect
      list. It should have been InvalidHeaderDefect.
    - gh-92839: Fixed crash resulting from calling
      bisect.insort() or bisect.insort_left() with the key
      argument not equal to None.
    - gh-91581: utcfromtimestamp() no longer attempts to resolve
      fold in the pure Python implementation, since the fold is
      never 1 in UTC. In addition to being slightly faster in the
      common case, this also prevents some errors when the
      timestamp is close to datetime.min. Patch by Paul Ganssle.
    - gh-92530: Fix an issue that occurred after interrupting
      threading.Condition.notify().
    - gh-92049: Forbid pickling constants re._constants.SUCCESS
      etc. Previously, pickling did not fail, but the result
      could not be unpickled.
    - bpo-47029: Always close the read end of the pipe used by
      multiprocessing.Queue after the last write of buffered data
      to the write end of the pipe to avoid BrokenPipeError at
      garbage collection and at multiprocessing.Queue.close()
      calls. Patch by Géry Ogam.
    - gh-91401: Provide a fail-safe way to disable subprocess use
      of vfork() via a private subprocess._USE_VFORK attribute.
      While there is currently no known need for this, if you
      find a need please only set it to False. File a CPython
      issue as to why you needed it and link to that from
      a comment in your code. This attribute is documented as
      a footnote in 3.11.
    - gh-91910: Add missing f prefix to f-strings in error
      messages from the multiprocessing and asyncio modules.
    - gh-91810: ElementTree method write() and function
      tostring() now use the text file’s encoding (“UTF-8” if not
      available) instead of locale encoding in XML declaration
      when encoding="unicode" is specified.
    - gh-91832: Add required attribute to argparse.Action repr
      output.
    - gh-91700: Compilation of regular expression containing
      a conditional expression (?(group)...) now raises an
      appropriate re.error if the group number refers to not
      defined group. Previously an internal RuntimeError was
      raised.
    - gh-91676: Fix unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase to shutdown
      the per test event loop executor before returning from its
      run method so that a not yet stopped or garbage collected
      executor state does not persist beyond the test.
    - gh-90568: Parsing \N escapes of Unicode Named Character
      Sequences in a regular expression raises now re.error
      instead of TypeError.
    - gh-91595: Fix the comparison of character and integer
      inside Tools.gdb.libpython.write_repr(). Patch by Yu Liu.
    - gh-90622: Worker processes for
      concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor are no longer
      spawned on demand (a feature added in 3.9) when the
      multiprocessing context start method is "fork" as that can
      lead to deadlocks in the child processes due to a fork
      happening while threads are running.
    - gh-91575: Update case-insensitive matching in the re module
      to the latest Unicode version.
    - gh-91581: Remove an unhandled error case in the
      C implementation of calls to datetime.fromtimestamp with no
      time zone (i.e. getting a local time from an epoch
      timestamp). This should have no user-facing effect other
      than giving a possibly more accurate error message when
      called with timestamps that fall on 10000-01-01 in the
      local time. Patch by Paul Ganssle.

      back to fork if vfork returns an error. This allows use in
      situations where vfork isn’t allowed by the OS kernel.
    - bpo-27929: Fix asyncio.loop.sock_connect() to only resolve
      names for socket.AF_INET or socket.AF_INET6 families.
      Resolution may not make sense for other families, like
      socket.AF_BLUETOOTH and socket.AF_UNIX.
    - bpo-43323: Fix errors in the email module if the charset
      itself contains undecodable/unencodable characters.
    - bpo-47101: hashlib.algorithms_available now lists only
      algorithms that are provided by activated crypto providers
      on OpenSSL 3.0. Legacy algorithms are not listed unless the
      legacy provider has been loaded into the default OSSL
      context.
    - bpo-46787: Fix concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor
      exception memory leak
    - bpo-45393: Fix the formatting for await x and not x in the
      operator precedence table when using the help() system.
    - bpo-46415: Fix ipaddress.ip_{address,interface,network}
      raising TypeError instead of ValueError if given invalid
      tuple as address parameter.

      does not have __doc__.
    - bpo-45138: Fix a regression in the sqlite3 trace callback

      3.10 by bpo-40318. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - bpo-44493: Add missing terminated NUL in sockaddr_un’s
      length
    - This was potentially observable when using non-abstract
      AF_UNIX datagram sockets to processes written in another
      programming language.
    - bpo-42627: Fix incorrect parsing of Windows registry proxy
      settings
    - bpo-36073: Raise ProgrammingError instead of segfaulting on
      recursive usage of cursors in sqlite3 converters. Patch by
      Sergey Fedoseev.

    avoid a “zipfile.BadZipFile: Bad CRC-32 for file” exception
    when reading a ZipFile from multiple threads.
  - bpo-38256: Fix binascii.crc32() when it is compiled to use
    zlib’c crc32 to work properly on inputs 4+GiB in length
    instead of returning the wrong result. The workaround prior
    to this was to always feed the function data in increments
    smaller than 4GiB or to just call the zlib module function.
  - bpo-39394: A warning about inline flags not at the start of
    the regular expression now contains the position of the flag.
  - bpo-47061: Deprecate the various modules listed by PEP 594:
  - aifc, asynchat, asyncore, audioop, cgi, cgitb, chunk, crypt,
    imghdr, msilib, nntplib, nis, ossaudiodev, pipes, smtpd,
    sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib
  - bpo-2604: Fix bug where doctests using globals would fail
    when run multiple times.
  - bpo-45997: Fix asyncio.Semaphore re-aquiring FIFO order.
  - bpo-47022: The asynchat, asyncore and smtpd modules have been
    deprecated since at least Python 3.6. Their documentation and
    deprecation warnings and have now been updated to note they
    will removed in Python 3.12 (PEP 594).
  - bpo-46421: Fix a unittest issue where if the command was
    invoked as python -m unittest and the filename(s) began with
    a dot (.), a ValueError is returned.
  - bpo-40296: Fix supporting generic aliases in pydoc.

- Update to 3.10.3:
  - bpo-46940: Avoid overriding AttributeError metadata
    information for nested attribute access calls. Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - bpo-46852: Rename the private undocumented
    float.__set_format__() method to float.__setformat__() to fix
    a typo introduced in Python 3.7. The method is only used by
    test_float. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46794: Bump up the libexpat version into 2.4.6
  - bpo-46820: Fix parsing a numeric literal immediately (without
    spaces) followed by “not in” keywords, like in 1not in x. Now
    the parser only emits a warning, not a syntax error.
  - bpo-46762: Fix an assert failure in debug builds when a ‘<’,
    ‘>’, or ‘=’ is the last character in an f-string that’s
    missing a closing right brace.
  - bpo-46724: Make sure that all backwards jumps use the
    JUMP_ABSOLUTE instruction, rather than JUMP_FORWARD with an

    Modules/_hashopenssl.c.
  - bpo-46615: When iterating over sets internally in
    setobject.c, acquire strong references to the resulting items
    from the set. This prevents crashes in corner-cases of
    various set operations where the set gets mutated.
  - bpo-45773: Remove two invalid “peephole” optimizations from
    the bytecode compiler.
  - bpo-43721: Fix docstrings of getter, setter, and deleter to
    clarify that they create a new copy of the property.

    sequences in f-strings.
  - bpo-46417: Fix a race condition on setting a type __bases__
    attribute: the internal function add_subclass() now gets the
    PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses member after calling
    PyWeakref_NewRef() which can trigger a garbage collection
    which can indirectly modify PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses. Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46383: Fix invalid signature of _zoneinfo’s module_free
    function to resolve a crash on wasm32-emscripten platform.
  - bpo-46070: Py_EndInterpreter() now explicitly untracks all
    objects currently tracked by the GC. Previously, if an object
    was used later by another interpreter, calling
    PyObject_GC_UnTrack() on the object crashed if the previous
    or the next object of the PyGC_Head structure became
    a dangling pointer. Patch by Victor Stinner.

    error text for multi-line f-strings expressions that do not
    start in the first line of the string. Patch by Pablo Galindo

    when the tokenizer doesn’t reach the end of the source when
    the error is reported. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-46091: Correctly calculate indentation levels for lines
    with whitespace character that are ended by line continuation
    characters. Patch by Pablo Galindo

    underlying socket handle is already invalid on the Proactor
    event loop.
  - bpo-47004: Apply bugfixes from importlib_metadata 4.11.3,
    including bugfix for EntryPoint.extras, which was returning
    match objects and not the extras strings.
  - bpo-46985: Upgrade pip wheel bundled with ensurepip (pip
    22.0.4)
  - bpo-46968: faulthandler: On Linux 5.14 and newer, dynamically
    determine size of signal handler stack size CPython allocates
    using getauxval(AT_MINSIGSTKSZ). This changes allows for
    Python extension’s request to Linux kernel to use AMX_TILE
    instruction set on Sapphire Rapids Xeon processor to succeed,
    unblocking use of the ISA in frameworks.
  - bpo-46955: Expose asyncio.base_events.Server as
    asyncio.Server. Patch by Stefan Zabka.
  - bpo-23325: The signal module no longer assumes that SIG_IGN
    and SIG_DFL are small int singletons.
  - bpo-46932: Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.7
  - bpo-25707: Fixed a file leak in

    dynamically loaded or statically linked libexpat in embedded
    Python.
  - bpo-39327: shutil.rmtree() can now work with VirtualBox
    shared folders when running from the guest operating-system.
  - bpo-46756: Fix a bug in
    urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgr.find_user_password() and
    urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuth.is_authenticated()
    which allowed to bypass authorization. For example, access to
    URI example.org/foobar was allowed if the user was authorized
    for URI example.org/foo.
  - bpo-46643: In typing.get_type_hints(), support evaluating
    stringified ParamSpecArgs and ParamSpecKwargs annotations.
    Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-45863: When the tarfile module creates a pax format
    archive, it will put an integer representation of timestamps
    in the ustar header (if possible) for the benefit of older
    unarchivers, in addition to the existing full-precision
    timestamps in the pax extended header.
  - bpo-46676: Make typing.ParamSpec args and kwargs equal to
    themselves. Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-46672: Fix NameError in asyncio.gather() when initial
    type check fails.

    bare stringified TypeAlias annotations. Patch by Gregory
    Beauregard.
  - bpo-45948: Fixed a discrepancy in the C implementation of the
    xml.etree.ElementTree module. Now, instantiating an
    xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser with a target=None keyword
    provides a default xml.etree.ElementTree.TreeBuilder target
    as the Python implementation does.
  - bpo-46521: Fix a bug in the codeop module that was
    incorrectly identifying invalid code involving string quotes
    as valid code.
  - bpo-46581: Brings ParamSpec propagation for GenericAlias in
    line with Concatenate (and others).
  - bpo-46591: Make the IDLE doc URL on the About IDLE dialog
    clickable.

  - bpo-46436: Fix command-line option -d/--directory in module
    http.server which is ignored when combined with command-line
    option --cgi. Patch by Géry Ogam.
  - bpo-41403: Make mock.patch() raise a TypeError with
    a relevant error message on invalid arg. Previously it
    allowed a cryptic AttributeError to escape.
  - bpo-46474: In importlib.metadata.EntryPoint.pattern, avoid
    potential REDoS by limiting ambiguity in consecutive
    whitespace.
  - bpo-46469: asyncio generic classes now return
    types.GenericAlias in __class_getitem__ instead of the same
    class.
  - bpo-46434: pdb now gracefully handles help when __doc__ is
    missing, for example when run with pregenerated optimized
    .pyc files.
  - bpo-46333: The __eq__() and __hash__() methods of
    typing.ForwardRef now honor the module parameter of
    typing.ForwardRef. Forward references from different modules
    are now differentiated.
  - bpo-46246: Add missing __slots__ to
    importlib.metadata.DeprecatedList. Patch by Arie Bovenberg.
  - bpo-46266: Improve day constants in calendar.

    when the input data is an object that supports the buffer
    protocol, the file length may be wrong.
  - bpo-45703: When a namespace package is imported before
    another module from the same namespace is created/installed
    in a different sys.path location while the program is
    running, calling the importlib.invalidate_caches() function
    will now also guarantee the new module is noticed.
  - bpo-24959: Fix bug where unittest sometimes drops frames from
    tracebacks of exceptions raised in tests.
  - bpo-44791: Fix substitution of ParamSpec in Concatenate with
    different parameter expressions. Substitution with a list of
    types returns now a tuple of types. Substitution with
    Concatenate returns now a Concatenate with concatenated lists
    of arguments.
  - bpo-14156: argparse.FileType now supports an argument of ‘-’
    in binary mode, returning the .buffer attribute of
    sys.stdin/sys.stdout as appropriate. Modes including ‘x’ and
    ‘a’ are treated equivalently to ‘w’ when argument is ‘-’.
    Patch contributed by Josh Rosenberg
  - bpo-46463: Fixes escape4chm.py script used when building the
    CHM documentation file

    registry keys after completion.
  - bpo-44359: test_ftplib now silently ignores socket errors to
    prevent logging unhandled threading exceptions. Patch by
    Victor Stinner.

    intented to test the readline module. Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - bpo-38472: Fix GCC detection in setup.py when
    cross-compiling. The C compiler is now run with LC_ALL=C.

    menu, ‘Close’ and ‘Exit’ are now ‘Close Window’ (the current
    one) and ‘Exit’ is now ‘Exit IDLE’ (by closing all windows).
    In Shell, ‘quit()’ and ‘exit()’ mean ‘close Shell’. If there
    are no other windows, this also exits IDLE.
  - bpo-45447: Apply IDLE syntax highlighting to pyi files. Patch
    by Alex Waygood and Terry Jan Reedy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  4 18:40:28 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Remove pdb_adjust_breakpoints.patch and instead just adjust location
  of the test breakpoint in Lib/test/test_pdb.py via sed, because we
  have shortened Lib/pdb.py by removing the shebang (bpo#45964).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  2 13:51:57 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add pdb_adjust_breakpoints.patch fixing expectd results in
  test_pdb_breakpoints_preserved_across_interactive_sessions
  (bpo#45964).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov 16 16:03:43 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Move rpm-build-python construct to correct place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 13 08:52:47 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- BuildRequire rpm-build-python: The provider to inject python(abi)
  has been moved there. rpm-build pulls rpm-build-python
  automatically in when building anything against python3-base, but
  this implies that the initial build of python3-base does not
  trigger the automatic installation.

- Update to 3.9.5:
  * Security
    - bpo-43434: Creating a sqlite3.Connection object now also
      produces a sqlite3.connect auditing event. Previously this
      event was only produced by sqlite3.connect() calls. Patch
      by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - bpo-43882: The presence of newline or tab characters in
      parts of a URL could allow some forms of attacks.
    - Following the controlling specification for URLs defined by
      WHATWG urllib.parse() now removes ASCII newlines and tabs
      from URLs, preventing such attacks.
    - bpo-43472: Ensures interpreter-level audit hooks receive
      the cpython.PyInterpreterState_New event when called
      through the _xxsubinterpreters module.
    - bpo-36384: ipaddress module no longer accepts any leading
      zeros in IPv4 address strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous
      and interpreted as octal notation by some libraries. For
      example the legacy function socket.inet_aton() treats
      leading zeros as octal notatation. glibc implementation of
      modern inet_pton() does not accept any leading zeros. For
      a while the ipaddress module used to accept ambiguous
      leading zeros.
    - bpo-43075: Fix Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
      vulnerability in urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler.
      The ReDoS-vulnerable regex has quadratic worst-case
      complexity and it allows cause a denial of service when
      identifying crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on
      the client side and needs remote attackers to control the
      HTTP server.
    - bpo-42800: Audit hooks are now fired for frame.f_code,
      traceback.tb_frame, and generator code/frame attribute
      access.
  * Core and Builtins
    - bpo-43105: Importlib now resolves relative paths when
      creating module spec objects from file locations.
    - bpo-42924: Fix bytearray repetition incorrectly copying
      data from the start of the buffer, even if the data is
      offset within the buffer (e.g. after reassigning a slice at
      the start of the bytearray to a shorter byte string).
  * Library
    - bpo-43993: Update bundled pip to 21.1.1.
    - bpo-43937: Fixed the turtle module working with non-default
      root window.
    - bpo-43930: Update bundled pip to 21.1 and setuptools to
      56.0.0
    - bpo-43920: OpenSSL 3.0.0: load_verify_locations() now
      returns a consistent error message when cadata contains no
      valid certificate.
    - bpo-43607: urllib can now convert Windows paths with \\?\
      prefixes into URL paths.
    - bpo-43284: platform.win32_ver derives the windows version
      from sys.getwindowsversion().platform_version which in turn
      derives the version from kernel32.dll (which can be of
      a different version than Windows itself). Therefore change
      the platform.win32_ver to determine the version using the
      platform module’s _syscmd_ver private function to return an
      accurate version.
    - bpo-42248: [Enum] ensure exceptions raised in _missing__
      are released
    - bpo-43799: OpenSSL 3.0.0: define OPENSSL_API_COMPAT 1.1.1
      to suppress deprecation warnings. Python requires OpenSSL
      1.1.1 APIs.
    - bpo-43794: Add ssl.OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF constants
      (OpenSSL 3.0.0)
    - bpo-43789: OpenSSL 3.0.0: Don’t call the password callback
      function a second time when first call has signaled an
      error condition.
    - bpo-43788: The header files for ssl error codes are now
      OpenSSL version-specific. Exceptions will now show correct
      reason and library codes. The make_ssl_data.py script has
      been rewritten to use OpenSSL’s text file with error codes.
    - bpo-43655: tkinter dialog windows are now recognized as
      dialogs by window managers on macOS and X Window.
    - bpo-43534: turtle.textinput() and turtle.numinput() create
      now a transient window working on behalf of the canvas
      window.
    - bpo-43522: Fix problem with hostname_checks_common_name.
      OpenSSL does not copy hostflags from struct SSL_CTX to
      struct SSL.
    - bpo-42967: Allow bytes separator argument in
      urllib.parse.parse_qs and urllib.parse.parse_qsl when
      parsing str query strings. Previously, this raised
      a TypeError.
    - bpo-43176: Fixed processing of a dataclass that inherits
      from a frozen dataclass with no fields. It is now correctly
      detected as an error.
    - bpo-41735: Fix thread locks in zlib module may go wrong in
      rare case. Patch by Ma Lin.
    - bpo-36470: Fix dataclasses with InitVars and replace().
      Patch by Claudiu Popa.
    - bpo-32745: Fix a regression in the handling of ctypes’
      ctypes.c_wchar_p type: embedded null characters would cause
      a ValueError to be raised. Patch by Zackery Spytz.
  * Documentation
    - bpo-43959: The documentation on the PyContextVar C-API was
      clarified.
    - bpo-43938: Update dataclasses documentation to express that
      FrozenInstanceError is derived from AttributeError.
    - bpo-43755: Update documentation to reflect that
      unparenthesized lambda expressions can no longer be the
      expression part in an if clause in comprehensions and
      generator expressions since Python 3.9.
    - bpo-43739: Fixing the example code in
      Doc/extending/extending.rst to declare and initialize the
      pmodule variable to be of the right type.
  * Tests
    - bpo-43961: Fix
      test_logging.test_namer_rotator_inheritance() on Windows:
      use os.replace() rather than os.rename(). Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - bpo-43842: Fix a race condition in the SMTP test of
      test_logging. Don’t close a file descriptor (socket) from
      a different thread while asyncore.loop() is polling the
      file descriptor. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - bpo-43811: Tests multiple OpenSSL versions on GitHub
      Actions. Use ccache to speed up testing.
    - bpo-43791: OpenSSL 3.0.0: Disable testing of legacy
      protocols TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Tests are failing with
      TLSV1_ALERT_INTERNAL_ERROR.
- Refreshed patches:
  - bpo-31046_ensurepip_honours_prefix.patch
  - python-3.3.0b1-fix_date_time_compiler.patch
- Add vendorized files from bluez-devel to enable building support for
  Bluetooth.

Sun May  2 09:20:06 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Make sure to close the import_failed.map file after the exception
  has been raised in order to avoid ResourceWarnings when the
  failing import is part of a try...except block.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 28 16:39:54 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.4:
  - bpo#43710: Reverted the fix for https://bugs.python.org/issue42500
    as it changed the PyThreadState struct size and broke the 3.9.x ABI
    in the 3.9.3 release (visible on 32-bit platforms using binaries
    compiled using an earlier version of Python 3.9.x headers).
  - bpo#26053: Fixed bug where the pdb interactive run command echoed
    the args from the shell command line, even if those have been
    overridden at the pdb prompt.
  - bpo#42988 (bsc#1183374) CVE-2021-3426: Remove the getfile
    feature of the pydoc module which could be abused to read
    arbitrary files on the disk (directory traversal
    vulnerability). Moreover, even source code of Python modules
    can contain sensitive data like passwords. Vulnerability
    reported by David Schwörer.
  - bpo#43285: ftplib no longer trusts the IP address value
    returned from the server in response to the PASV command by
    default. This prevents a malicious FTP server from using the
    response to probe IPv4 address and port combinations on the
    client network. Code that requires the former vulnerable
    behavior may set a trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address attribute
    on their ftplib.FTP instances to True to re-enable it.
  - bpo#43439: Add audit hooks for gc.get_objects(),
    gc.get_referrers() and gc.get_referents(). Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - bpo#43660: Fix crash that happens when replacing sys.stderr
    with a callable that can remove the object while an exception
    is being printed. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo#43555: Report the column offset for SyntaxError for
    invalid line continuation characters. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo#43517: Fix misdetection of circular imports when using
    from pkg.mod import attr, which caused false positives in
    non-trivial multi-threaded code.
  - bpo#35883: Python no longer fails at startup with a fatal
    error if a command line argument contains an invalid Unicode
    character. The Py_DecodeLocale() function now escapes byte
    sequences which would be decoded as Unicode characters
    outside the [U+0000; U+10ffff] range.
  - bpo#43406: Fix a possible race condition where
    PyErr_CheckSignals tries to execute a non-Python signal
    handler.
  - bpo#42500: Improve handling of exceptions near recursion
    limit. Converts a number of Fatal Errors in RecursionErrors.
  - bpo#43433: xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy no longer ignores query
    and fragment in the URL of the server.
  - bpo#35930: Raising an exception raised in a “future” instance
    will create reference cycles.
  - bpo#43577: Fix deadlock when using ssl.SSLContext debug
    callback with ssl.SSLContext.sni_callback().
  - bpo#43521: ast.unparse can now render NaNs and empty sets.
  - bpo#43423: subprocess.communicate() no longer raises an
    IndexError when there is an empty stdout or stderr IO buffer
    during a timeout on Windows.
  - bpo#27820: Fixed long-standing bug of smtplib.SMTP where
    doing AUTH LOGIN with initial_response_ok=False will fail.
    The cause is that SMTP.auth_login _always_ returns a password
    if provided with a challenge string, thus non-compliant with
    the standard for AUTH LOGIN. Also fixes bug with the test for
    smtpd.
  - bpo#43332: Improves the networking efficiency of http.client
    when using a proxy via set_tunnel(). Fewer small send calls
    are made during connection setup.
  - bpo#43399: Fix ElementTree.extend not working on iterators
    when using the Python implementation
  - bpo#43316: The python -m gzip command line application now
    properly fails when detecting an unsupported extension. It
    exits with a non-zero exit code and prints an error message
    to stderr.
  - bpo#43260: Fix TextIOWrapper can not flush internal buffer
    forever after very large text is written.
  - bpo#42782: Fail fast in shutil.move() to avoid creating
    destination directories on failure.
  - bpo#37193: Fixed memory leak in socketserver.ThreadingMixIn
    introduced in Python 3.7.
  - bpo#43199: Answer “Why is there no goto?” in the Design and
    History FAQ.
  - bpo#43407: Clarified that a result from time.monotonic(),
    time.perf_counter(), time.process_time(), or
    time.thread_time() can be compared with the result from any
    following call to the same function - not just the next
    immediate call.
  - bpo#27646: Clarify that ‘yield from <expr>’ works with any
    iterable, not just iterators.
  - bpo#36346: Update some deprecated unicode APIs which are
    documented as “will be removed in 4.0” to “3.12”. See PEP 623
    for detail.
  - bpo#37945: Fix test_getsetlocale_issue1813() of test_locale:
    skip the test if setlocale() fails. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo#41561: Add workaround for Ubuntu’s custom OpenSSL
    security level policy.
  - bpo#43288: Fix test_importlib to correctly skip Unicode file
    tests if the fileystem does not support them.
  - bpo#43617: Improve configure.ac: Check for presence of
    autoconf-archive package and remove our copies of M4 macros.
  - bpo#42225: Document that IDLE can fail on Unix either from
    misconfigured IP masquerage rules or failure displaying
    complex colored (non-ascii) characters.
  - bpo#43283: Document why printing to IDLE’s Shell is often
    slower than printing to a system terminal and that it can be
    made faster by pre-formatting a single string before
    printing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 19 16:58:38 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.2:
  - bpo#42938 (bsc#1181126): Avoid static buffers when computing
    the repr of ctypes.c_double and ctypes.c_longdouble
    values. This issue was assigned CVE-2021-3177.
  - bpo#42967 (bsc#1182379): Fix web cache poisoning
    vulnerability by defaulting the query args separator to &,
    and allowing the user to choose a custom separator. This
    issue was assigned CVE-2021-23336.
- Upstreamed patches were removed:
  - CVE-2021-3177-buf_ovrfl_PyCArg_repr.patch
  - bsc1167501-invalid-alignment.patch
  - skip_random_failing_tests.patch
  - CVE-2019-5010-null-defer-x509-cert-DOS.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  9 01:37:59 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Add Obsoletes for python3-base when primary interpreter is set to
  properly replace it during upgrades.  (bsc#1181324)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 22:02:03 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.1:
  Security bugs:
  - Prevented potential DoS attack via CPU and RAM exhaustion
    when processing malformed Apple Property List files in binary
    format.
  - The plistlib module no longer accepts entity declarations in
    XML plist files to avoid XML vulnerabilities. This should not
    affect users as entity declarations are not used in regular
    plist files.
  - Add volatile to the accumulator variable in
    hmac.compare_digest, making constant-time-defeating
    optimizations less likely.
  Core and Builtins
  - Allow assignment expressions in set literals and set
    comprehensions as per PEP 572. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Fix a regression introduced by the new parser, where an
    unparenthesized walrus operator was not allowed within
    generator expressions.
  - types.GenericAlias objects can now be the targets of
    weakrefs.
  - Fixed a bug in the PEG parser that was causing crashes in
    debug mode. Now errors are checked in left-recursive rules to
    avoid cases where such errors do not get handled in time and
    appear as long-distance crashes in other places.
  - Fixed a possible crash in the PEG parser when checking for
    the ‘!=’ token in the barry_as_flufl rule. Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - Fix handling of errors during creation of PyFunctionObject,
    which resulted in operations on uninitialized memory. Patch
    by Yonatan Goldschmidt.
  - Fix a bug in the parser, where a curly brace following
    a primary didn’t fail immediately. This led to invalid
    expressions like a {b} to throw a SyntaxError with a wrong
    offset, or invalid expressions ending with a curly brace like
    a { to not fail immediately in the REPL.
  - Fix possible buffer overflow in the new parser when checking
    for continuation lines. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Run the parser two times. On the first run, disable all the
    rules that only generate better error messages to gain
    performance. If there’s a parse failure, run the parser
    a second time with those enabled.
  - Document the default implementation of object.__eq__.
  - Fix peephole optimizer misoptimize conditional jump
    + JUMP_IF_NOT_EXC_MATCH pair.
  - The garbage collector now tracks all user-defined classes.
    Patch by Brandt Bucher.
  - Fixed potential issues with removing not completely
    initialized module from sys.modules when import fails.
  - Star-unpacking is now allowed for with item’s targets in the
    PEG parser.
  - Fixed stack overflow in issubclass() and isinstance() when
    getting the __bases__ attribute leads to infinite recursion.
  - When loading a native module and a load failure occurs,
    prevent a possible UnicodeDecodeError when not running in
    a UTF-8 locale by decoding the load error message using the
    current locale’s encoding.
  - Correctly count control blocks in ‘except’ in compiler.
    Ensures that a syntax error, rather a fatal error, occurs for
    deeply nested, named exception handlers.
  Library
  - types.GenericAlias will now raise a TypeError when attempting
    to initialize with a keyword argument. Previously, this would
    cause the interpreter to crash if the interpreter was
    compiled with debug symbols. This does not affect
    interpreters compiled for release. Patch by Ken Jin.
  - CGIHTTPRequestHandler.run_cgi() HTTP_ACCEPT improperly
    parsed. Replace the special purpose getallmatchingheaders
    with generic get_all method and add relevant tests.
  - inspect.findsource() now raises OSError instead of IndexError
    when co_lineno of a code object is greater than the file
    length. This can happen, for example, when a file is edited
    after it was imported. PR by Irit Katriel.
  - Fix handling of trailing comments by inspect.getsource().
  - ChainMap.__iter__ no longer calls __getitem__ on underlying
    maps
  - TracebackException no longer holds a reference to the
    exception’s traceback object. Consequently, instances of
    TracebackException for equivalent but non-equal exceptions
    now compare as equal.
  - We fixed an issue in pickle.whichmodule in which importing
    multiprocessing could change the how pickle identifies which
    module an object belongs to, potentially breaking the

  - Clarify the error message for asyncio.IncompleteReadError
    when expected is None.
  - Extracting a symlink from a tarball should succeed and

    remove the existing file or symlink before extraction. Based
    on patch by Chris AtLee, Jeffrey Kintscher, and Senthil
    Kumaran.
  - Fixed tkinter.ttk.Style.map(). The function accepts now the
    representation of the default state as empty sequence (as
    returned by Style.map()). The structure of the result is now
    the same on all platform and does not depend on the value of
    wantobjects.
  - Fix various issues with typing.Literal parameter handling
    (flatten, deduplicate, use type to cache key). Patch provided
    by Yurii Karabas.
  - Fix the threading.Thread class at fork: do nothing if the

    specified in user (group, extra_groups) overflows uid_t
    (gid_t).
  - Improve asyncio.wait function to create the futures set just
    one time.
  - InvalidFileException and RecursionError are now the only
    errors caused by loading malformed binary Plist file
    (previously ValueError and TypeError could be raised in some
    specific cases).
  - Pickling heap types implemented in C with protocols 0 and
    1 raises now an error instead of producing incorrect data.
  - plistlib: fix parsing XML plists with hexadecimal integer
    values
  - Fix an incorrectly formatted error from
    _codecs.charmap_decode() when called with a mapped value
    outside the range of valid Unicode code points. PR by Max
    Bernstein.
  - Fix pickling pure Python datetime.time subclasses. Patch by
    Dean Inwood.

    return None when triying to locate a library in an
    environment when gcc>=9 is available and ldconfig is not.
    Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - C14N 2.0 serialisation in xml.etree.ElementTree failed for
    unprefixed attributes when a default namespace was defined.
  - Fix a bug in the symtable module that was causing
    module-scope global variables to not be reported as both
    local and global. Patch by Pablo Galindo.

    always returns now the numeric code returned by Tk instead of
    the name of the event type.
  - fix tkinter.EventType Enum so all members are strings, and
    none are tuples
  - Fix SQLite3 segfault when backing up closed database. Patch
    contributed by Peter David McCormick.
  - Fix the tarfile module to write only basename of TAR file to
    GZIP compression header.
  - Allow ctypes.wintypes to be imported on non-Windows systems.
  - shutil.which() now ignores empty entries in PATHEXT instead
    of treating them as a match.
  - Fix time-of-check/time-of-action issue in
    subprocess.Popen.send_signal.
  - Fix --outfile for cProfile / profile not writing the output
    file in the original directory when the program being
    profiled changes the working directory. PR by Anthony
    Sottile.
  - ZipFile truncates files to avoid corruption when a shorter
    comment is provided in append (“a”) mode. Patch by Jan Mazur.

    attempts to replace a non-existent Content-Transfer-Encoding
    header.

    fixed in gdb 10.1.
  - Fix test_asyncio.test_call_later() race condition: don’t
    measure asyncio performance in the call_later() unit test.
    The test failed randomly on the CI.
  - Include _testinternalcapi module in Windows installer for
    test suite
  - Fix test_logging.test_race_between_set_target_and_flush():
    the test now waits until all threads complete to avoid
    leaking running threads.

  - In calltips, stop reminding that ‘/’ marks the end of
    positional-only arguments.
  - Typing opening and closing parentheses inside the parentheses
    of a function call will no longer cause unnecessary
    “flashing” off and on of an existing open call-tip, e.g. when
    typed in a string literal.

  * import importlib_resources is not the same as
    import importlib.resources, same for metadata
  * The backport packages from PyPI needed for older flavors are

    package requires them they typically add them with a python
    version qualifier and the packages have their own version
    numbers.

- Removed recursion.tar: contained in upstream
- Update to 3.9.0b5:
  - bpo-41304: Fixes python3x._pth being ignored on Windows, caused
    by the fix for bpo-29778 (CVE-2020-15801).
  - bpo-41162: Audit hooks are now cleared later during
    finalization to avoid missing events.
  - bpo-29778: Ensure python3.dll is loaded from correct locations
    when Python is embedded (CVE-2020-15523).

    characters in http.client.putrequest(…).
  - bpo-41295: Resolve a regression in CPython 3.8.4 where defining
    “__setattr__” in a multi-inheritance setup and
    calling up the hierarchy chain could fail if builtins/extension
    types were involved in the base types.
  - bpo-41247: Always cache the running loop holder when running
    asyncio.set_running_loop.
  - bpo-41252: Fix incorrect refcounting in
    _ssl.c’s _servername_callback().
  - bpo-41215: Use non-NULL default values in the PEG parser
    keyword list to overcome a bug that was '
    preventing Python from being properly compiled when using the
    XLC compiler. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo-41218: Python 3.8.3 had a regression where compiling with
    ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT would
    aggressively mark list comprehension with CO_COROUTINE. Now only
    list comprehension making use of async/await will tagged as so.
  - bpo-41175: Guard against a NULL pointer dereference within
    bytearrayobject triggered by the bytearray() + bytearray() operation.
  - bpo-39960: The “hackcheck” that prevents sneaking around a type’s

    loaded more than once. It now uses a global state rather than a module state.
  - bpo-39384: Fixed email.contentmanager to allow set_content() to set a
    null string.
  - bpo-41300: Save files with non-ascii chars.
    Fix regression released in 3.9.0b4 and 3.8.4.
  - bpo-37765: Add keywords to module name completion list.
    Rewrite Completions section of IDLE doc.
  - bpo-40170: Revert PyType_HasFeature() change: it reads
    again directly the PyTypeObject.tp_flags
    member when the limited C API is not used, rather than always calling
    PyType_GetFlags() which hides implementation details.

  is only 114kB and it provides python3-base with a working hashlib
  module.
  (also, this fixes bnc#743787)
