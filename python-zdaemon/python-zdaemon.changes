-Update to 3.0.5 version:
 * Fixed: the status command didn't return a non-zero exit status when
   the program wasn't running. This made it impossible for other software
   (e.g. Puppet) to tell if a process was running.
- Update to 3.0.0 version:
  * Added an option, start-test-program to supply a test command to test
    whether the program managed by zdaemon is up and operational, rather 
    than just running. When starting a program, the start command doesn't 
    return until the test passes. You could, for example, use this to wait
    until a web server is actually accepting connections.
  * Added a start-timeout option to error if a program takes too long to start.
    This is especially useful in combination with the start-test-program option.
  * Added an option, stop-timeout, to control how long to wait for a graceful shutdown.
  * Previously, this was controlled by backoff-limit, which didn't make much sense.
  * Several undocumented, untested, and presumably unused features were removed.
