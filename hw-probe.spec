%description
A tool to check operability of computer hardware and upload result
to the Linux hardware database.

Probe â€” is a snapshot of your computer hardware state and system
logs. The tool checks operability of devices by analysis of logs
and returns a permanent url to view the probe of the computer.

The tool is intended to simplify collecting of logs necessary for
investigating hardware related problems. Just run one simple
command in the console to check your hardware and collect all the
system logs at once:

    sudo -E hw-probe -all -upload

By creating probes you contribute to the HDD/SSD Real-Life
Reliability Test study: https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART
