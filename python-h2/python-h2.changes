- Set URL to more useful https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2
- Update to v3.1.0
  * API Changes (Backward-Incompatible)
    +  h2.connection.H2Connection.data_to_send first and only
       argument ``amt`` was renamed to ``amount``
    + Support for Python 3.3 has been removed.
  * API Changes (Backward-Compatible)
    + h2.connection.H2Connection.send_data now supports ``data``
      parameter being a ``memoryview`` object.
    + Refactor ping-related events: a h2.events.PingReceived event is
      fired when a PING frame is received and a h2.events.PingAckReceived
      event is fired when a PING frame with an ACK flag is received
    + h2.events.PingAcknowledged is deprecated in favour of the
      identical h2.events.PingAckReceived
    + Added ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL to h2.settings.SettingCodes
    + Support CONNECT requests with a ``:protocol`` pseudo header
      thereby supporting RFC 8441.
    + A limit to the number of closed streams kept in memory by the
      connection is applied. It can be configured by
      h2.connection.H2Connection.MAX_CLOSED_STREAMS
 * Debug logging when stream_id is None is now fixed and no longer errors.
