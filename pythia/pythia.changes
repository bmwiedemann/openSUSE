- Update to version 8.240:
  + See
    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia82html/UpdateHistory.html
- Rebase existing patches to apply cleanly.
- Disable boost and drop boost BuildRequires as it is no longer
  needed when compiling against LHAPDF >= 6.2.
- Remove unnecessary hidden files not cleaned up by build.
- Cleanups using spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 30 22:09:08 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.235:
  + See
    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia82html/UpdateHistory.html
- Rebase pythia-remove-rpaths.patch 
- Drop bundled header file MixMax.h which is not used by pythia
  directly and violates GPL copyright.
- Update License to GPL-2.0-or-later in keeping with upstream
  change.
- Use %%license to install COPYING file instead of %%doc.
- Remove no-longer needed post-install mosifications:
  + The correct permission for pythia8-config binary is set by
    install script; stop setting it manually
  + Rpaths are already removed from the shared libraries; don't
    execute chrpath to do this. Also drop BuildRequires: chrpath.
  + Don't remove non-existent backup file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 10:20:22 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.230:
  + Long list of changes, see
    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html.
- Drop python-dont-force-std-cxx98.patch, incorporated into
  upstream sources.
- Rebase existing patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 31 22:16:11 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Build with HepMC2-devel < 3, since pythia tests fail when built
  against HepMC-devel >= 3. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 31 16:21:15 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.226:
  + See list of changes at:
    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia82html/UpdateHistory.html
- Rebase patches for update.
- Add python-dont-force-std-cxx98.patch to prevent usage of
  --std=c++98 and instead inherit default compiler flags; using
  c++98 causes conflicts with dependencies such as fastjet which
  are built using default compiler std, leading to build failures
  for openSUSE > 1320 (where fastjet is compiled with --std=c+=14
  support). Tests in the check section show that this does not
  have any untoward repercussions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  5 16:42:33 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Use individual libboost-*-devel packages instead of boost-devel
  (only for suse_version > 1325).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 04:05:24 UTC 2017 - bwiedemann@suse.com

- Fix build with rpm-4.13 that creates no .orig file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 25 09:46:08 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.223:
  + See list of changes at:
    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html
    or locally at
    /usr/share/doc/packages/pythia/htmldoc/UpdateHistory.html.
- Pass "-std=c++14" to CXXFLAGS as it is required for building
  with fastjet support.
- Move installation of shell env definitions to %install section;
  this avoids an rpmlint warning and is a better place to do the
  installation rather than the %build section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  1 13:06:18 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Trim descriptions; only have the full one on the most important
  package. RPM group corrections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  7 03:45:36 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Modify pythia-remove-rpaths.patch to make disabling rpaths
  optional, specified by passing the "--disable-rpath" option to
  configure. Pass said option at the %build stage to prevent
  rpath usage in build shared libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  2 01:42:56 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.219:
  + See list of changes at:
    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html
    or locally at
    /usr/share/doc/packages/pythia/htmldoc/UpdateHistory.html.
- Rebase patches so that they apply cleanly against updated
  version.
- Add pythia-remove-rpaths.patch to remove rpath usage when
  building shared libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 09:17:48 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update pythia-honour-env-cxxflags.patch to really fix the
  issue (mentioned in previous entry) for all cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  2 03:22:30 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update pythia-honour-env-cxxflags.patch to fix a minor issue
  with the pythia8-config script when system CXXFLAGS are passed
  during compilation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 23:52:54 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Fix the location pointed to by PYTHIA8DATA env variable saved in
  /etc/profile.d/pythia.*; remove %{appname} macro as nothing uses
  it any more.
- Use %configure instead of ./configure (remove duplicate
  specification of "--prefix=PATH").
- Add pythia-honour-env-cxxflags.patch to allow compilation with
  CXXFLAGS set by env appended to default compilation flags; this
  allows the build to honour RPM_OPT_FLAGS.
- Fix some unusual characters in the descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 11:44:09 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Verify installation by running select bundled tests in a %check
  section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 11:33:44 UTC 2015 - idonmez@suse.com

- Change postinstall scripts to run ldconfig directly 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 05:18:52 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.210:  
  + Bug fix in CKKW-L merging for LHE files, such that the
    factorization and renormalization scales are set by the SCALUP
    value if the muf2 and mur2 LHEF3 attributes have not been set,
    and the user has not set any explicit values; this change
    restores the PYTHIA 8.1 behaviour.
  + Various technical improvements in the machinery for hard
    diffraction.
  + Correct quark flavour selection when a string spanned directly
    between two junctions is split up.
  + Check that SK-I and SK-II colour reconnection machineries only
    are called for event topologies they are set up to handle.
  + Bug fixes in partial widths of the W' boson. Results are
    correct when the W' is a simply rescaled copy of the W, but
    not for more general couplings. Thanks to Mihail Chizhov.
  + Minor fix in default location of PDF data files in the
    constructors. No practical consequence since correct
    non-default values are used.
  + Tiny fix in the configure script, so that CXX options
    containing an equal sign are parsed correctly.
- Changes from version 8.202 through 8.209:
  + See /usr/share/doc/packages/pythia/htmldoc/UpdateHistory.html.
- Add pythia-makefile-destdir-support.patch to enable DESTDIR
  support in the Makefile; makes configure stage buildroot-free
  and prevents an ugly BUILDROOT trace in the shlib.
- Enable additional bindings now that all necessary deps are in
  Factory; new subpackage: libpythia8lhapdf6.
- Add BuildRequires: chrpath; required to cleanup rpath in
  libpythia8lhapdf6.so.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 17 06:09:48 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.201:
  + Undocumented changes
- Changes from version 8.200:
  + Long list of changes, see announcement here:
    https://www.hepforge.org/lists-archive/pythia8-announce/2014/000009.html
- Packaging changes:
  + Rename pythia-libs to libpythia8 to satisfy rpmlint (although
    the package only includes one unversioned shlib)
  + Documentation files moved from toplevel dir in source to
    "share" subdir, adapt specfile accordingly
  + pythia8-config.in is now replaced by the script pythia8-config
    and does not require any tweaking in specfile to get right
    paths
  + configure options changed, allowing to automatically install
    to libdir where it needed to be manually copied to /usr/lib64
    for the x86_64 arch
  + Package new headers directory: %{_includedir}/Pythia8Plugins/
  + Package new pdf documentation: %{_docdir}/%{name}/pdfdoc/.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  4 23:49:37 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.186:
  + New user hook to help experimentation with colour
    reconnection, in particular in relation to resonance decays
  + New set of parameters StringFlav:probQQ1toQQ0join, used to
    pick diquark spin when two already produced quarks are to be
    joined into a diquark
  + Possibility to map the bookkeeping of exotic unresolved
    incoming beams in Les Houches event files onto neutrino beams,
    see LesHouches:idRenameBeams; primarily intended for dark
    matter annihilation
  + A correction to the graviton (G^*) + parton hard processes
    (5003-5005) to account for off-shell G^* production; the
    previous formula assumed the graviton was on-shell and
    could greatly overestimate the low-mass tail of the G^*.
  + Bug fixes in examples/JetMatching.h, for uninitialized
    boolean, and number of partons to match for heavy flavour
    handling. The former bug was introduced with the new
    matching schemes in version 8.185 and affected matching to
    ALPGEN, since no events were rejected
  + Differentiate the reading of ALPGEN masses, so that vanishing
    c or b masses in ALPGEN are not unwittingly used where
    inappropriate; also protect the c and b masses from being set
    too low in TimeShower and SpaceShower, so that flavour
    thresholds are not messed up
  + Reduce number of maximum violation warnings in SpaceShower by
    leaving some headroom for branching weights
  + Bug fix that hasVetoed in Pythia.cc was not reset correctly in
    some specific cases
  + Bug fix in PartonLevel.cc where a reference could become
    invalid
  + Improvements and bug fixes in junction handling
  + Bug fix to not reuse colour indices in double diffraction
  + Bug fix in the calculation of the average mass threshold of
    open decay channels of a resonance; reduced
    ResonanceWidths::MASSMIN parameter value.
  + Correct typo in left-right symmetry documentation
  + Other minor fixes.
