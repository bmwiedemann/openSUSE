      This addon includes several good quality codecs that are well tested.
      These codecs can be used to encode and decode media files where the
      format is not patent encumbered.

    <p>
      A codec decodes audio and video for playback or editing and is also
      used for transmission or storage.
      Different codecs are used in video-conferencing, streaming media and
      video editing applications.
