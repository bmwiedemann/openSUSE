- 1.2.0 Release
New features:
 * New Photo module

 * New South Park Studios online video channel

 * Show the status of the downloads in progress (with ability to
start/abort)
 * Thumbnailing ability, using a custom Ethumb slave process
 * Automatically (and manually) download and update youtube-dl
 * New Watchdog module (sadly gstreamer1 sometimes hang the mainloop for me)
 * Cache to file remote images for faster reloading
 * Support remote urls also in the mediaplayer cover image
 * Show current folders in the file-manager
 * Option to hide the mouse cursor when not needed (not move or video
playing)
 * Support for subtitles embedded in the video files
 * New check_po setup command, give translations stats with a nice bar

Improvements:
 * Initial music library scan is now 10 times faster (measured with the
library
   and the config folder on the same slow HDD) see Issue #2 for more info.
 * Lots of improvements in the Music module and the AudioPlayer itself:
   playlist is now visible and browsable, player/playlist controls are
always
   reachable in the UI, ability to set loop and shuffle.
 * Better zapiks video schannel

New Translations:
 * Finnish

Changes:
 * Dropped python 2 support, you MUST use python 3 from now on
 * Removed broken traileraddict channel (use the new tmdb instead)
 * Use elm focus in place of the custom EmcFocusManager
 * We now use ecore_con.Url for fetching data from the net (instead of
   ecore.file_download + file read + file delete)

Bug fixed:
 * Fixed poster hiding (and console errors) for efl >= 1.16
 * Fixed posters for the vimeo channel
 * Fixed tmdb language selector in config
 * Fixed (hopefully) subs decoding
 * Fixed video download to work again
 * Fixed a bug that was causing fileman buttons to be clickable also when
hidden
 * Removed usage of elm deprecated ObjectItem.data_get() function
 * Removed edc warning about "fixed: 1 1"
 * Fixed compatibility with python 3.5 (os.path.exists no more accept
unicode)
 * Updated yt scraper to latest web changes
