Since ifplugd is now integrated into the network configuration scripts,
we removed the daemon startscript from the /etc/init.d directory.
If you want to use ifplugd the "old" way and not via the sysconfig method, 
just copy ifplugd.init to /etc/init.d/ifplugd.
We recommend to use the sysconfig method (enter "STARTMODE=ifplugd" in the
configuration for your network interface).
