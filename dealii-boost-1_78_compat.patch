Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Fix compilation with boost 1.78.

I bisected (fortunately Boost.Geometry a header-only library so adding the
include directory sufficed) and
https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/commit/6eb9e238bcb37e26dc31d16acf826784a2ba30f4
is where this problem starts for us. See also
https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/issues/792 - the easiest fix for all such
issues is to just include the project header `boost/geometry/geometry.hpp`.

In this particular case, if you look at the commit which causes grid_tools.cc
fails to compile, its because we were relying on some implicit includes. In
particular, we need the distance header to find the distance between points and
boxes, but that was previously included in another file.
