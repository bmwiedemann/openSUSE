%description
Because the many-to-many relationships are not real relationships, they can
not be introspected with DBIx::Class. Many-to-many relationships are
actually just a collection of convenience methods installed to bridge two
relationships. This DBIx::Class component can be used to store all relevant
information about these non-relationships so they can later be introspected
and examined.
