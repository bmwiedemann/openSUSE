Sun Aug 25 17:56:17 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 0.15.1:
  * Small bugfix and removal of a print statement

- changes from version 0.15.0:
  * Added file path completions, there's a new "Completion.type" path,
    now. Example: '/ho -> '/home/
  * *args/**kwargs resolving. If possible Jedi replaces the parameters
    with the actual alternatives.
  * Better support for enums/dataclasses
  * When using Interpreter, properties are now executed, since a lot
    of people have complained about this. Discussion in #1299, #1347.
  * New APIs:
    + Definition.get_signatures() -> List[Signature]. Signatures are
      similar to CallSignature. Definition.params is therefore
      deprecated.
    + Signature.to_string() to format call signatures.
    + Signature.params -> List[ParamDefinition], ParamDefinition has
      the following additional attributes infer_default(),
      infer_annotation(), to_string(), and kind.
    + Definition.execute() -> List[Definition], makes it possible to
      infer return values of functions.

Wed May 29 12:51:13 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Disable tests as it is not working at all on python 3.7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 26 10:48:44 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Do not bother condition for typing, on 3.7+ it is provided by base

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  2 15:12:14 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.13.3:
  * Fixed an issue with embedded Python see https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/issues/870

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 14 12:05:41 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

Sun Jan  6 22:27:01 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

  * Fixed a bug that led to Jedi spawning a lot of subprocesses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 11 18:46:48 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- update to version 0.13.1
  * Bugfixes, because tensorflow completions were still slow.
- update to version 0.13.0
  * A small release. Some bug fixes.
  * Remove Python 3.3 support. Python 3.3 support has been dropped by the Python
    foundation.
  * Default environments are now using the same Python version as the Python
    process. In 0.12.x, we used to load the latest Python version on the system.
  * Added ``include_builtins`` as a parameter to usages.
  * ``goto_assignments`` has a new ``follow_builtin_imports`` parameter that
    changes the previous behavior slightly.
- Remove test_requrements.patch, no longer needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  2 01:09:29 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * require parso >= 0.3.0
  * remove python-devel requirement

- update to version 0.12.1:
  * This release forces you to upgrade parso. If you don't, nothing
    will work anymore. Otherwise changes should be limited to bug
    fixes. Unfortunately Jedi still uses a few internals of parso that
    make it hard to keep compatibility over multiple releases. Parso
    >=0.3.0 is going to be needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 16:34:44 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 0.9.0:
  * The import logic has been rewritten to look more like Python's.
    There is now an Evaluator.modules import cache, which resembles
    sys.modules.
  * Integrated the parser of 2to3. This will make refactoring
    possible. It will also be possible to check for error messages
    (like compiling an AST would give) in the future.
  * With the new parser, the evaluation also completely changed.
    It's now simpler and more readable.
  * Completely rewritten REPL completion.
  * Added jedi.names, a command to do static analysis. Thanks to
    that sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!
  * Alpha version of the linter.
- remove "-final0" appended to source version
- add python-unittest2 as a test dependency for SLE11
- skip failing tests in test_integration_import.py

Wed Aug 13 11:03:20 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.8.1
  * Bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that 
    improve autocompletion for builtin libraries. Fixed.
- Update to version 0.8.0
  * Memory Consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) 
    has been reduced drastically. Loading times are down as well 
    (it takes basically as long as an import).
  * REPL completion is starting to become usable.
  * Various small API changes. Generally this released focuses on 
    stability and refactoring of internal APIs.
  * Introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating 
    correct Array indices and __getattr__ strings possible.
