%description
The CNI (Container Network Interface) project consists of a
specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure
network interfaces in Linux containers, along with a number of
supported plugins. CNI concerns itself only with network
connectivity of containers and removing allocated resources when
the container is deleted. Because of this focus, CNI has a wide
range of support and the specification is simple to implement.

These are the additional CNI network plugins provided by
the containernetworking team.
