SUSE adjustments to qemu.conf

This patch contains SUSE-specific adjustments to the upstream
qemu.conf configuration file. In the future, it might make
sense to separate these changes into individual patches (e.g.
suse-qemu-conf-secdriver.patch, suse-qemu-conf-lockmgr.patch,
etc.), but for now they are all lumped together in this
single patch.

-# In order to prevent accidentally starting two domains that
-# share one writable disk, libvirt offers two approaches for
-# locking files. The first one is sanlock, the other one,
-# virtlockd, is then our own implementation. Accepted values
-# are "sanlock" and "lockd".
+# SUSE note:
+# Two lock managers are supported: lockd and sanlock.  lockd, which
+# is provided by the virtlockd service, uses advisory locks (flock(2))
+# to protect virtual machine disks.  sanlock uses the notion of leases
+# to protect virtual machine disks and is more appropriate in a SAN
+# environment.
+#
+# For most deployments that require virtual machine disk protection,
+# lockd is recommended since it is easy to configure and the virtlockd
+# service can be restarted without terminating any running virtual
+# machines.  sanlock, which may be preferred in some SAN environments,
+# has the disadvantage of not being able to be restarted without
+# first terminating all virtual machines for which it holds leases.
+#
+# Specify lockd or sanlock to enable protection of virtual machine disk
+# content.
