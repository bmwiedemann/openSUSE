- update to 0.3.1:
  * vterm-dump specifically emit NUL/CAN/SUB/DEL
  * Optionally emit NUL/CAN/SUB/DEL from parser than
  * Don't bother to emit the unrecognized sequence in DECRQSS
  * erase_internal should only set fg/bg color, resetting others
  * Added vterm_screen_set_default_colors()
  * Delete mk_wcswidth functions as they're unused
  * Also accept DECSGR sequences for superscript/subscript

- Update to 0.3.0 (unfortunately, upstream doesn't provide
  correct changelog so this is just log of VCS):
  - Pass lineinfos into screen resize callback; make it
    responsible for reshaping them
  - getchar() into unsigned char in vterm-ctrl.c to avoid
    complaints of comparison signedness (LP1894806)
  - Avoid remaining VLA by bounding the combining-char search to
    the max supported chars per cell
  - Avoid putting a potentially-unbounded VLA on the stack as
    temporary working space for character decode, by using the
    tmpbuffer in on_text instead
  - Set a much larger default out/tmpbuffer size (4096bytes),
    because now a size-constrained caller could make them smaller
  - Permit overriding size of outbuffer / tmpbuffer as builder
    params
  - Create struct VTermBuilder and vterm_build()
  - VTermAllocator field can be const in struct VTerm
  - Store INCDIR directly in .pc file rather than indirecting it
    via PREFIX
  - Version bump to v0.2
  - Selection send and recv should use independent partial-state
    storage
  - Also support sending the selection
  - Replace vterm_push_output_sprintf_dcs with a more generic
    _str version that can independently control introduction C1
    vs terminating ST
  - Add a selection callback for query
  - Don't emit any mouse sequences when mouse reporting disabled
  - Remember to reset mouse flags as part of overall
    vterm_state_reset()
  - Add a usage comment at the top of bin/unterm.c
  - Capture unit test for OSC 52
  - Further bugfixes for OSC 52 handling in various split-write
    conditions
  - Bugfix for cornercase where two-byte ST is split across
    buffer writes
  - Initial attack at OSC 52 = selection management, to set the
    clipboard
  - An initial attack at documenting (most of?) the sequences
    from xterm
  - Notation fixes in doc/seqs.txt
  - Provide state fallbacks for APC/PM/SOS
  - Other C0/C1 controls are permitted within SOS strings
  - Recognise APC, PM and SOS in the parser
  - Use 0x99 as a C1 test byte instead of 0x9F because the latter
    is APC which is a string introducer
  - Set _XOPEN_SOURCE 600 unconditionally in vterm-ctrl.c
  - Make libvterm compile on arm64 Macs (from
    https://github.com/neovim/libvterm/pull/6)
  - Ensure that resize shorter does not send the cursor to a
    negative row
  - Remove debugging print on DECRQSS
  - Regenerate fullwidth.inc for latest Unicode
  - A much more efficient find-wide-chars.pl
  - Accept OSC ... ST without an intermediate semicolon after the
    command number
  - Fix printf argument types
    (https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/5456)
  - Partial bugfix for uncleared area after resize (thanks Jörg
    Richter)
  - Recognise SGR 8 for conceal (thanks Jörg Richter)
  - Define a new dedicated 'state fallbacks' struct rather than
    abusing the parser callbacks one
  - New string-handling API that streams in possibly-multiple
    fragments
  - Remember to length-check accesses at cell->chars[] because it
    is not necessarily zero-terminated (LP 1846869)
  - fix memory leak of vt->tmpbuffer (LP 1843449)
  - t/run-test.pl option to abort on first fail
  - Accept convenience formatting in ?screen_chars assertions;
    makes unit tests more readable
  - Include test script line number in t/run-test.pl output
  - Add a short unit test that resize on altscreen at least
    doesn't crash
  - Only enable altscreen during unit tests that need it
  - Better handling of resize to try to avoid the final
    memmove(), and not drag scrollback in unnecessarily
  - Can't lazy-allocate state->lineinfos[BUFIDX_ALTSCREEN]
    because that allocs during byte run
  - Initial hack at tracking 'continuation' marks per line in
    lineinfo
  - Allow run-test.pl to cope with empty assertion results
  - Be sure to clear DWL/DHL status for blank lines caused by
    scroll
  - Pass 'state fields' as a struct into resize callback in case
    of other things it needs to edit
  - Remember to store a state->lineinfo array for both buffers
  - Do all the initialising of VTermState in vterm_state_new()
  - Rename realloc_buffer() to just alloc_buffer() since it
    doesn't need to realloc now
  - Rewrite of resize handling logic to hopefully cope much
    better with reflow

- All my previous builds were just figments of my imagination,
  and neovim upstream claims one has to use 0.1.3 only. So,
  downgrading.

  - 697 Avoid the \e escape in string literals in bin/*.c; replace with \x1b
