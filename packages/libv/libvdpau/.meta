  <title>VDPAU wrapper and trace libraries</title>
  <description>This package contains the libvdpau wrapper library and the libvdpau_trace
debugging library, along with the header files needed to build VDPAU
applications.  To actually use a VDPAU device, you need a vendor-specific
implementation library.  Currently, this is always libvdpau_nvidia.  You can
override the driver name by setting the VDPAU_DRIVER environment variable.</description>
