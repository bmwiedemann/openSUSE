%description
Libvoikko is a library of free natural language processing tools. It
aims to provide support for languages that are not well served by
other existing free linguistic tools.

The library supports multiple backends, of which VFST and HFST are
enabled in the default build:

 - VFST: Finite state transducer format used for Finnish morphology
   and as an experimental language independent backend.
 - HFST (Helsinki Finite-State Transducer Technology): Supports ZHFST
   speller archives for various languages.
 - Experimental backends: Weighted VFST and Lttoolbox.

Libvoikko provides spell checking, hyphenation, grammar checking and
morphological analysis for Finnish language. Spell checking is
supported for other languages through the HFST backend.
