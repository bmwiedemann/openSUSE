Tue Feb  5 07:37:48 UTC 2019 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to version 1.8.0

  This release focused on encoding performance for realtime and VOD use cases.

  - Upgrading:
    This adds and improves several vp9 controls. Most are related to SVC:
      VP9E_SET_SVC_FRAME_DROP_LAYER:
        - Frame dropping in SVC.
      VP9E_SET_SVC_INTER_LAYER_PRED:
        - Inter-layer prediction in SVC.
      VP9E_SET_SVC_GF_TEMPORAL_REF:
        - Enable long term temporal reference in SVC.
      VP9E_SET_SVC_REF_FRAME_CONFIG/VP9E_GET_SVC_REF_FRAME_CONFIG:
        - Extend and improve this control for better flexibility in setting SVC
          pattern dynamically.
      VP9E_SET_POSTENCODE_DROP:
        - Allow for post-encode frame dropping (applies to non-SVC too).
      VP9E_SET_SVC_SPATIAL_LAYER_SYNC:
        - Enable spatial layer sync frames.
      VP9E_SET_SVC_LAYER_ID:
        - Extend api to specify temporal id for each spatial layers.
      VP9E_SET_ROI_MAP:
        - Extend Region of Interest functionality to VP9.

  - Enhancements:
    2 pass vp9 encoding has improved substantially. When using --auto-alt-ref=6,
    we see approximately 8% for VBR and 10% for CQ. When using --auto-alt-ref=1,
    the gains are approximately 4% for VBR and 5% for CQ.

    For real-time encoding, speed 7 has improved by ~5-10%. Encodes targeted at
    screen sharing have improved when the content changes significantly (slide
    sharing) or scrolls. There is a new speed 9 setting for mobile devices which
    is about 10-20% faster than speed 8.

  - Bug fixes:
    VP9 denoiser issue.
    VP9 partition issue for 1080p.
    VP9 rate control improvments.
    Postprocessing Multi Frame Quality Enhancement (MFQE) issue.
    VP8 multithread decoder issues.
    A variety of fuzzing issues.

- so name is changing to 6
- use optflags for building

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  6 16:30:12 UTC 2018 - adrian@suse.de

- update to version 1.7.0

  This release focused on high bit depth performance (10/12 bit) and vp9
  encoding improvements.

  - Upgrading:
    This release is ABI incompatible due to new vp9 encoder features.

    Frame parallel decoding for vp9 has been removed.

  - Enhancements:
    vp9 encoding supports additional threads with --row-mt. This can be greater
    than the number of tiles.

    Two new vp9 encoder options have been added:
      --corpus-complexity
      --tune-content=film

    Additional tooling for respecting the vp9 "level" profiles has been added.

  - Bug fixes:
    A variety of fuzzing issues.
    vp8 threading fix for ARM.
    Codec control VP9_SET_SKIP_LOOP_FILTER fixed.
    Reject invalid multi resolution configurations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 11 12:42:01 UTC 2016 - olaf@aepfle.de

- Update to version 1.6.0
  This release improves upon the VP9 encoder and speeds up the encoding and
  decoding processes.

  - Enhancement:
    A core focus has been performance for low end Intel processors. SSSE3
    instructions such as 'pshufb' have been avoided and instructions have been
    reordered to better accommodate the more constrained pipelines.

    As a result, devices based on Celeron processors have seen substantial
    decoding improvements. From Indian Runner Duck to Javan Whistling Duck,
    decoding speed improved between 10 and 30%. Between Javan Whistling Duck
    and Khaki Campbell Duck, it improved another 10 to 15%.

    While Celeron benefited most, Core-i5 also improved 5% and 10% between the
    respective releases.

    Realtime performance for WebRTC for both speed and quality has received a
    lot of attention.

  - Bug Fixes:
    A number of fuzzing issues, found variously by Mozilla, Chromium and others,
    have been fixed and we strongly recommend updating.
- Remove libvpx-pkgconfig-version.patch

    - This release introduces several substantial new features to
      the encoder, of particular interest to real time streaming
       applications.
  + Improved performance
  + Encoder quality in the single stream case is consistent with
    the Cayuga release.
  + Bug fixes
- Rename libvpx0 to libvpx1, following upstreams soname bump (also
  in baselibs.conf)
- Add pkg-config BuildRequires: as we provide a .pc file, we need
  pkg-config to be able to create the pkgconfig() provides
  (automatically).
- libvpx-configure-add-armv7-tgt-isa.patch currently disabled:
  needs more work.

- Fix license tags: libvpx0 has no GPLv2+ code and should be BSD3c

  "BSD-style license", which is something license.opensuse.org
