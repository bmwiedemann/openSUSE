- remove third-party-programs.txt during setup
  * When not building on Windows using Visual Studio, the Visual
    Studio runtimes are not needed to be installed so we can remove
    these licenses from being mentioned. On Linux we're using
    cmake/make/gcc for building/installation and we don't have any
    (need for) MS Visual Studio runtime. (oneapi-src/oneVPL issue#27)
