%description
The VulkanSceneGraph is a graphics toolkit for the development of
graphic applications such as flight simulators, games, virtual
reality and scientific visualization. Based around the concept of a
scene graph, it provides an object-oriented framework on top of
Vulkan freeing the developer from implementing and optimizing low
level graphics calls, and provides many additional utilities for
development of graphics applications.
