%description
libverto provides a way for libraries to expose asynchronous
interfaces without having to choose a particular event loop,
offloading this decision to the end application which consumes the
library.

If you are packaging an application, not library, based on libverto,
you should depend either on a specific implementation module or you
can depend on the virtual provides 'libverto-module-base'. This will
ensure that you have at least one module installed that provides io,
timeout and signal functionality. Currently glib is the only module
that does not provide these three because it lacks signal. However,
glib will support signal in the future.
