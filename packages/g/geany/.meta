  <title>Small and lightweight IDE</title>
  <description>Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME. So it is using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need
only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.</description>
