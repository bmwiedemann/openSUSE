- Modernized rust in specfile and enabled tests
- Update to version 1.4.5:
  * All dependencies have been updated to their latest versions
  * For a small set of special characters, grex produced incorrect
    regular expressions when the case-insensitivity feature was
    enabled. This has been fixed.
  * The code for creating regular expressions in verbose mode has
    been simplified and is more performant now.
