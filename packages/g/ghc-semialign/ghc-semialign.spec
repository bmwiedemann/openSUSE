%description
The major use of 'These' of this is provided by the 'align' member of
'Semialign' class, representing a generalized notion of "zipping with padding"
that combines structures without truncating to the size of the smaller input.

It turns out that 'zip' operation fits well the 'Semialign' class, forming
lattice-like structure.
