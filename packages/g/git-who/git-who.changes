- Update to version 1.2:
  * Features
    - Git who now respects the mailmap file you have configured in
      your git config, if you have one. This is in addition to any
      .mailmap file that might exist at the repository root. (#32)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed git pathspec exclude magic being useless without a
      preceding include pathspec (#33)
    - Fixed an issue that might have led to errors on Windows when
      closing the cache file

- Update to version 1.1:
  * Features
    - The output of git who table now uses alternate-row coloring
      when more than a certain number of rows are displayed.
  * Bug Fixes/Tweaks
    - Better path handling for Windows (fixes #30 and #31)

Tue Jul 01 10:47:31 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.0:
  * Features
    - Binary release for Windows
  * Bug Fixes/Tweaks
    - Git Who can now handle filenames containing newline
      characters (fixes #25)
    - Better mailmap handling to avoid a situation where a user
      could end up with a stale cache if they use a global mailimap
      file
    - Fixed a goroutine deadlock that can arise if there is an
      error caching commits

Mon Mar 31 05:43:47 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.7:
  * Features
    - Git who now reads and respects a .git-blame-ignore-revs file
      if present in the root of the repo (suggested in #10)
    - Git who now fully supports the "exclude" pathspec magic as
      defined in gitglossary(3). This allows you to ignore certain
      files by passing e.g. :!vendor/ or :!*.c (addresses #4)
  * Bug Fixes / Tweaks
    - Git who no longer panics when log.show-signature is set in
      the Git config (fixes #2)
    - Git who can handle leading whitespace in filenames (fixes #5)
    - "Terminator" (i.e. --) is now parsed properly from the CLI
      arguments, allowing deleted paths to be analyzed (fixes #7)
    - Commit "subject" no longer read from git log. It was
      previously ignored but not reading it entirely might fix #16
    - --diff-merges: first-parent no longer passed to git log
      invocation. This wasn't really needed and it turns out it is
      a relatively new feature of Git (version 2.31). This should
      help with #21
