- Update to version 0.7:
  * Features
    - Git who now reads and respects a .git-blame-ignore-revs file
      if present in the root of the repo (suggested in #10)
    - Git who now fully supports the "exclude" pathspec magic as
      defined in gitglossary(3). This allows you to ignore certain
      files by passing e.g. :!vendor/ or :!*.c (addresses #4)
  * Bug Fixes / Tweaks
    - Git who no longer panics when log.show-signature is set in
      the Git config (fixes #2)
    - Git who can handle leading whitespace in filenames (fixes #5)
    - "Terminator" (i.e. --) is now parsed properly from the CLI
      arguments, allowing deleted paths to be analyzed (fixes #7)
    - Commit "subject" no longer read from git log. It was
      previously ignored but not reading it entirely might fix #16
    - --diff-merges: first-parent no longer passed to git log
      invocation. This wasn't really needed and it turns out it is
      a relatively new feature of Git (version 2.31). This should
      help with #21
