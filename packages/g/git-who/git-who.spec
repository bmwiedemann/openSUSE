%description
git-who is a command-line tool for answering that eternal question:

    Who wrote this code?!

Unlike git blame, which can tell you who wrote a line of code, git-who tells
you the people responsible for entire components or subsystems in a codebase.
You can think of git-who sort of like git blame but for file trees rather than
individual files.
