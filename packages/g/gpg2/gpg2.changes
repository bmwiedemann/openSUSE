Fri Jun  8 14:37:06 UTC 2018 - kbabioch@suse.com

- Update to version 2.2.8:
  * gpg: Decryption of messages not using the MDC mode will now lead to a

    care: Never use that option unconditionally or without a prior warning.

  * New long term stable branch, replacing the 2.0.x series
  * gpg: Reverted change in 2.1.23 so that --no-auto-key-retrieve
    is again the default boo#1054088
  * Fixed a few minor bugs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 12 16:56:26 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuPG 2.1.23:
  * gpg: Options --auto-key-retrieve and --auto-key-locate "local,wkd"
    are now used by default.  Note: this enables keyserver and Web Key
    Directory operators to notice when a signature from a locally
    non-available key is being verified for the first time or when
    you intend to encrypt to a mail address without having the key
    locally.  This new behaviour will eventually make key discovery
    much easier and mostly automatic.  Disable this by adding
      no-auto-key-retrieve
      auto-key-locate local
    to your gpg.conf.
  * agent: Option --no-grab is now the default.  The new option --grab
    allows to revert this.
  * gpg: New import option "show-only".
  * gpg: New option --disable-dirmngr to entirely disable network
    access for gpg.
  * gpg,gpgsm: Tweaked DE-VS compliance behaviour.

Tue Apr  4 14:00:36 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuPG 2.1.20:
  * gpg: New properties 'expired', 'revoked', and 'disabled' for the
    import and export filters.
  * gpg: New command --quick-set-primary-uid.
  * gpg: New compliance field for the --with-colon key listing.
  * gpg: Changed the key parser to generalize the processing of local
    meta data packets.
  * gpg: Fixed assertion failure in the TOFU trust model.
  * gpg: Fixed exporting of zero length user ID packets.
  * scd: Improved support for multiple readers.
  * scd: Fixed timeout handling for key generation.
  * agent: New option --enable-extended-key-format.
  * dirmngr: Do not add a keyserver to a new dirmngr.conf.  Dirmngr
    uses a default keyserver.
  * dimngr: Do not treat TLS warning alerts as severe error when
    building with GNUTLS.
  * dirmngr: Actually take /etc/hosts in account.
  * wks: Fixed client problems on Windows.  Published keys are now set
    to world-readable.
  * tests: Fixed creation of temporary directories.
  * A socket directory for a non standard GNUGHOME is now created on
    the fly under /run/user.  Thus "gpgconf --create-socketdir" is now
    optional.  The use of "gpgconf --remove-socketdir" to clean up
    obsolete socket directories is however recommended to avoid
    cluttering /run/user with useless directories.
  * Fixed build problems on some platforms.

  * dirmngr: Avoid PTR lookups for keyserver pools. The are only
    done for the debug command "keyserver --hosttable".
  * dirmngr: Rework the internal certificate cache to support
    classes of certificates. Load system provided certificates on
    startup.
  * Add options --tls, --no-crl, and --systrust to the "VALIDATE"
    command.

Tue Jan 24 16:32:04 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuPG 2.1.18:
  * gpg: Remove bogus subkey signature while cleaning a key (with
    export-clean, import-clean, or --edit-key's sub-command clean)

    trailing dot in domain names).
  * dirmngr: Make sure that Tor is actually enabled after changing the
    conf file and sending SIGHUP or "gpgconf --reload dirmngr".
  * dirmngr: Fixed Tor access to IPv6 addresses.  Note that current
    versions of Tor may require that the flag "IPv6Traffic" is used
    with the option "SocksPort" in torrc to actually allow IPv6
    traffic.
  * dirmngr: Fixed HKP for literally given IPv6 addresses.
  * dirmngr: Enabled reverse DNS lookups via Tor.
  * dirmngr: Added experimental SRV record lookup for WKD.
    See commit 88dc3af3d4ae1afe1d5e136bc4c38bc4e7d4cd10 for details.
  * dirmngr: For HKP use "pgpkey-hkps" and "pgpkey-hkp" in SRV record
    lookups.  Avoid SRV record lookup when a port is explicitly
    specified.  This fixes a regression from the 1.4 and 2.0 behavior.
  * dirmngr: Gracefully handle a missing /etc/nsswitch.conf.  Ignore
    negation terms (e.g. "[!UNAVAIL=return]" instead of bailing out.
  * dirmngr: Better debug output for flags "dns" and "network".
  * dirmngr: On reload mark all known HKP servers alive.
  * gpgconf: Allow keyword "all" for --launch, --kill, and --reload.
  * tools: gpg-wks-client now ignores a missing policy file on the
    server.
  * Avoid unnecessary ambiguity error message in the option parsing.
  * Further improvements of the regression test suite.
  * Fixed building with --disable-libdns configure option.
  * Fixed a crash running the tests on 32 bit architectures.
  * Fixed spurious failures on BSD system in the spawn functions.
    This affected for example gpg-wks-client and gpgconf.

Fri Nov 13 14:37:58 UTC 2009 - puzel@novell.com

- update to gnupg-2.0.13
 * GPG now generates 2048 bit RSA keys by default.  The default hash
   algorithm preferences has changed to prefer SHA-256 over SHA-1.
   2048 bit DSA keys are now generated to use a 256 bit hash algorithm
 * The envvars XMODIFIERS, GTK_IM_MODULE and QT_IM_MODULE are now
   passed to the Pinentry to make SCIM work.
 * The GPGSM command --gen-key features a --batch mode and implements
   all features of gpgsm-gencert.sh in standard mode.
 * New option --re-import for GPGSM's IMPORT server command.
 * Enhanced writing of existing keys to OpenPGP v2 cards.
 * Add hack to the internal CCID driver to allow the use of some
   Omnikey based card readers with 2048 bit keys.
 * GPG now repeatly asks the user to insert the requested OpenPGP
   card.  This can be disabled with --limit-card-insert-tries=1.
 * Minor bug fixes.
- drop gnupg-2.0.4-default-tty.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 18 13:22:00 CEST 2009 - puzel@novell.com

- update to gnupg-2.0.12
 * GPGSM now always lists ephemeral certificates if specified by
   fingerprint or keygrip.
 * New command "KEYINFO" for GPG_AGENT.  GPGSM now also returns
   information about smartcards.
 * Made sure not to leak file descriptors if running gpg-agent with a
   command.  Restore the signal mask to solve a problem in Mono.
 * Changed order of the confirmation questions for root certificates
   and store negative answers in trustlist.txt.
 * Better synchronization of concurrent smartcard sessions.
 * Support 2048 bit OpenPGP cards.
 * Support Telesec Netkey 3 cards.
 * The gpg-protect-tool now uses gpg-agent via libassuan.
 * Changed code to avoid a possible Mac OS X system freeze.

  * The SCDAEMON option --allow-admin is now used by default.
  * GPGCONF now restarts SCdaemon if necessary.
  * The default cipher algorithm in GPGSM is now again 3DES.  This is
    due to interoperability problems with Outlook 2003 which still
    can't cope with AES.
