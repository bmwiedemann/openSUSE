%description
This library provides simple read-only access to the local computer's
networking configuration. It is currently capable of getting a list of all the
network interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC addresses.

network-info has been tested and is known to work on Ubuntu 10.10, FreeBSD 9.0,
Mac OS X 10.6.4 and Windows XP/7. It probably works on other flavours of Linux,
OS X, FreeBSD and Windows as well.
