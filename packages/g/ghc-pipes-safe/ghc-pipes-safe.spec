%description
This package adds resource management and exception handling to the 'pipes'
ecosystem.

Notable features include:

* /Resource Safety/: Guarantee finalization using 'finally', 'bracket' and more

* /Exception Safety/: Even against asynchronous exceptions!

* /Laziness/: Only acquire resources when you need them

* /Promptness/: Finalize resources early when you are done with them

* /Native Exception Handling/: Catch and resume from exceptions inside pipes

* /No Buy-in/: Mix resource-safe pipes with unmanaged pipes using 'hoist'.
