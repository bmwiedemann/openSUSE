  <title>Types for representing a structured document</title>
  <description>
	  This package contains definitions for the Pandoc data structure,
	  which is used by pandoc to represent structured documents. These
	  definitions used to live in the pandoc package, but starting with
	  pandoc 1.7, they have been split off, so that other packages can
	  use them without drawing in all of pandoc's dependencies, and
	  pandoc itself can depend on packages (like citeproc-hs) that use
	  them.

	  Text.Pandoc.Builder provides functions for building up Pandoc
	  structures programmatically.

	  Text.Pandoc.Generic provides generic functions for manipulating
	  Pandoc documents.
