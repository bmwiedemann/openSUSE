  <title>A garbage collector for C and C++</title>
  <description>The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a
garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It allows you
to allocate memory basically as you normally would, without explicitly
deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer
be otherwise accessed.</description>
