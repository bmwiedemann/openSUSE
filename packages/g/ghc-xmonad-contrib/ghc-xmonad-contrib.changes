- Update xmonad-contrib to version 0.15.
  ## unknown

  ## 0.15

  ### Breaking Changes

    * `XMonad.Layout.Groups` & `XMonad.Layout.Groups.Helpers`
      The layout will no longer perform refreshes inside of its message handling.
      If you have been relying on it to in your xmonad.hs, you will need to start
      sending its messages in a manner that properly handles refreshing, e.g. with
      `sendMessage`.

  ### New Modules

    * `XMonad.Util.Purex`

      Unlike the opaque `IO` actions that `X` actions can wrap, regular reads from
      the `XConf` and modifications to the `XState` are fundamentally pure --
      contrary to the current treatment of such actions in most xmonad code. Pure
      modifications to the `WindowSet` can be readily composed, but due to the
      need for those modifications to be properly handled by `windows`, other pure
      changes to the `XState` cannot be interleaved with those changes to the
      `WindowSet` without superfluous refreshes, hence breaking composability.

      This module aims to rectify that situation by drawing attention to it and
      providing `PureX`: a pure type with the same monadic interface to state as
      `X`. The `XLike` typeclass enables writing actions generic over the two
      monads; if pure, existing `X` actions can be generalised with only a change
      to the type signature. Various other utilities are provided, in particular
      the `defile` function which is needed by end-users.

  ### Bug Fixes and Minor Changes

    * Add support for GHC 8.6.1.

    * `XMonad.Actions.MessageHandling`
      Refresh-performing functions updated to better reflect the new `sendMessage`.
