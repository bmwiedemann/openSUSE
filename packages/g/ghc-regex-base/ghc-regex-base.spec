%description
This package doesn't provide the ability to do regex matching, but instead
provides the type-classes that constitute the abstract API that is implemented
by 'regex-*' backends such as

* <//hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-posix regex-posix>

* <//hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-parsec regex-parsec>

* <//hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-dfa regex-dfa>

* <//hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa regex-tdfa>

* <//hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-pcre regex-pcre>
