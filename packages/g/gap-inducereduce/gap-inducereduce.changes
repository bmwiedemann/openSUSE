- Update to release 1.3
  * Set power maps in the character tables whose irreducibles have
    been computed by the `Irr` method that calls `IrrUnger`.
  * In the `Irr` method that calls `IrrUnger`, delegate to
    `IrrBaumClausen` if the group is abelian-by-supersolvable; this
    is usually faster.
