# Packaging prometheus

In addition to the source code in the tarball, this package also
needs the assets for the web UI. These can be generated by the
`Makefile` that is present in this package.
To do that, you need to have `make` and `npm` installed locally.

For the OBS workflow you also need `obs-service-go_modules` as well
as `obs-service-tar_scm` and `obs-service-recompress`.
