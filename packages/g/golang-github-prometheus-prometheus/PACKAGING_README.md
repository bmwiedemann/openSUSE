# Packaging prometheus

In addition to the source code in the tarball, this package also
needs the assets for the web UI. These can be generated during the
build at the build server using the node modules service. The
required dependecies definition can be generated by the `Makefile`
which is present in this package.
To do that, you need to have `make` and `npm` installed locally.
For the OBS workflow you also need `obs-service-go_modules`,
`obs-service-node_modules` as well as `obs-service-tar_scm` and
`obs-service-recompress`.

1. Change the version in the `_service` file
2. Change the version in the spec file
3. Run `make`
4. Create a changelog entry
5. Commit the changes as usual
