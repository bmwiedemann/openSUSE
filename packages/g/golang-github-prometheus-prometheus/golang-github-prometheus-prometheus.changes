- Update to final v2.0.0 release (bsc#1067341):
  + Compared to version 1.x, this release includes a completely rewritten
    storage engine, huge performance improvements, but also many backwards
    incompatible changes.  For more information, read the announcement blog
    post and migration guide:
    - https://prometheus.io/blog/2017/11/08/announcing-prometheus-2-0/
    - https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.0/migration/
  + Changes:
    * Completely rewritten storage layer, with WAL.  This is not backwards
      compatible with 1.x storage,  and many flags have changed/disappeared.
    * New staleness behavior. Series now marked stale after target scrapes
      no longer return them, and soon after targets disappear from service
      discovery.
    * Rules files use YAML syntax now.  Conversion tool added to promtool.
    * Removed count_scalar, drop_common_labels functions and keep_common
      modifier from PromQL.
    * Rewritten exposition format parser with much higher performance.  The
      Protobuf exposition format is no longer supported.
    * Example console templates updated for new storage and metrics names.
      Examples other than node exporter and Prometheus removed.
    * Admin and lifecycle APIs now disabled by default, can be reenabled via
      flags
    * Flags switched to using Kingpin, all flags are now --flagname rather
      than -flagname.
  + Features:
    * Remote read can be configured to not read data which is available
      locally.  This is enabled by default.
    * Rules can be grouped now.  Rules within a rule group are executed
      sequentially.
    * Added experimental GRPC apis
    * Add timestamp() function to PromQL.
  + Enhancements:
    * Remove remote read from the query path if no remote storage is
      configured.
    * Bump Consul HTTP client timeout to not match the Consul SD watch
      timeout.
    * Go-conntrack added to provide HTTP connection metrics.
  + Bug Fixes:
    * Fix connection leak in Consul SD.

      duration instead of returning an error.

    * Avoid needless padding of 4 zero bytes in index files.
    * Delete old blocks during reload (necessary on MS Windows).
    * Fix regression of alert rules state loss on config reload.
