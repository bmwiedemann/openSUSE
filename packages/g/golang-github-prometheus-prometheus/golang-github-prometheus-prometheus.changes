- fix boo#1208752
- adjust packaging to build webassets locally, outside of OBS
  * to get the UI working, newer versions of prometheus need the
    react app assets
  * as running `npm install` inside of OBS is not possible, the
    required dependencies need to be prepared outside of OBS
  * added a PACKAGING_README.md file, that explains how the new
    web-ui-*.tar.gz and npm_licenses.tar.bz2 tarballs can be
    created

- update to 2.42.0:
  This release comes with a bunch of feature coverage for native
  histograms and breaking changes.

  If you are trying native histograms already, we recommend you
  remove the `wal` directory when upgrading.
  Because the old WAL record for native histograms is not
  backward compatible in v2.42.0, this will lead to some data
  loss for the latest data.

  Additionally, if you scrape "float histograms" or use recording
  rules on native histograms in v2.42.0 (which writes float
  histograms),
  it is a one-way street since older versions do not support
  float histograms.

    * [CHANGE] **breaking** TSDB: Changed WAL record format for the
      experimental native histograms. #11783
    * [FEATURE] Add 'keep_firing_for' field to alerting rules.
      #11827
    * [FEATURE] Promtool: Add support of selecting timeseries for
      TSDB dump. #11872
    * [ENHANCEMENT] Agent: Native histogram support. #11842
    * [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Support native histograms in recording
      rules. #11838

      targets for Kubernetes. #11844
    * [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add VM size label to azure service
      discovery. #11650
    * [ENHANCEMENT] Support native histograms in federation. #11830
    * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Add gauge histogram support.
      #11783 #11840 #11814
    * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB/Scrape: Support FloatHistogram that
      represents buckets as float64 values. #11522 #11817 #11716
    * [ENHANCEMENT] UI: Show individual scrape pools on /targets
      page. #11142

- Update to final v2.0.0 release (bsc#1067341):
  + Compared to version 1.x, this release includes a completely rewritten
    storage engine, huge performance improvements, but also many backwards
    incompatible changes.  For more information, read the announcement blog
    post and migration guide:
    - https://prometheus.io/blog/2017/11/08/announcing-prometheus-2-0/
    - https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.0/migration/
  + Changes:
    * Completely rewritten storage layer, with WAL.  This is not backwards
      compatible with 1.x storage,  and many flags have changed/disappeared.
    * New staleness behavior. Series now marked stale after target scrapes
      no longer return them, and soon after targets disappear from service
      discovery.
    * Rules files use YAML syntax now.  Conversion tool added to promtool.
    * Removed count_scalar, drop_common_labels functions and keep_common
      modifier from PromQL.
    * Rewritten exposition format parser with much higher performance.  The
      Protobuf exposition format is no longer supported.
    * Example console templates updated for new storage and metrics names.
      Examples other than node exporter and Prometheus removed.
    * Admin and lifecycle APIs now disabled by default, can be reenabled via
      flags
    * Flags switched to using Kingpin, all flags are now --flagname rather
      than -flagname.
  + Features:
    * Remote read can be configured to not read data which is available
      locally.  This is enabled by default.
    * Rules can be grouped now.  Rules within a rule group are executed
      sequentially.
    * Added experimental GRPC apis
    * Add timestamp() function to PromQL.
  + Enhancements:
    * Remove remote read from the query path if no remote storage is
      configured.
    * Bump Consul HTTP client timeout to not match the Consul SD watch
      timeout.
    * Go-conntrack added to provide HTTP connection metrics.
  + Bug Fixes:
    * Fix connection leak in Consul SD.

- Update to v2.0.0-rc.3 (bsc#1067030):
  + Enhancements:
    * Remove remote read from the query path if no remote storage
      is configured.
    * Bump Consul HTTP client timeout to not match the Consul SD
      watch timeout.
    * Bump up a too small max block duration to the min block
      duration instead of returning an error.
  + Bug Fixes:
    * Avoid needless padding of 4 zero bytes in index files.
    * Delete old blocks during reload (necessary on MS Windows).
    * Fix regression of alert rules state loss on config reload.
    * Serialize background WAL operations to avoid data races.
  + This also contains bugfixes and remote-storage features from
    the 1.8 branch.
