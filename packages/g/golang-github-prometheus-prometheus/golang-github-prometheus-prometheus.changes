- update to 2.53.0:
  This release changes the default for GOGC, the Go runtime control
  for the trade-off between excess memory use and CPU usage. We
  have found that Prometheus operates with minimal additional CPU
  usage, but greatly reduced memory by adjusting the upstream Go
  default from 100 to 75.
  * [CHANGE] Rules: Execute 1 query instead of N (where N is the
    number of alerts within alert rule) when restoring alerts.
    #13980 #14048
  * [CHANGE] Runtime: Change GOGC threshold from 100 to 75 #14176
    #14285

    group via rule group configuration file and rule_query_offset
    as part of the global configuration to have more resilience for
    remote write delays. #14061 #14216 #14273
  * [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Add
    rule_group_last_restore_duration_seconds metric to measure the
    time it takes to restore a rule group. #13974
  * [ENHANCEMENT] OTLP: Improve remote write format translation
    performance by using label set hashes for metric identifiers
    instead of string based ones. #14006 #13991
  * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Optimize querying with regexp matchers.
    #13620
  * [BUGFIX] OTLP: Don't generate target_info unless there are
    metrics and at least one identifying label is defined. #13991
  * [BUGFIX] Scrape: Do no try to ingest native histograms when the
    native histograms feature is turned off. This happened when
    protobuf scrape was enabled by for example the created time
    feature. #13987
  * [BUGFIX] Scaleway SD: Use the instance's public IP if no
    private IP is available as the __address__ meta label. #13941
  * [BUGFIX] Query logger: Do not leak file descriptors on error.
    #13948
  * [BUGFIX] TSDB: Let queries with heavy regex matches be
    cancelled and not use up the CPU. #14096 #14103 #14118 #14199
  * [BUGFIX] API: Do not warn if result count is equal to the
    limit, only when exceeding the limit for the series,
    label-names and label-values APIs. #14116

    corrupted snapshot. #14079

Thu Feb  2 07:19:41 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 2.42.0:
  This release comes with a bunch of feature coverage for native
  histograms and breaking changes.

  If you are trying native histograms already, we recommend you
  remove the `wal` directory when upgrading.
  Because the old WAL record for native histograms is not
  backward compatible in v2.42.0, this will lead to some data
  loss for the latest data.

  Additionally, if you scrape "float histograms" or use recording
  rules on native histograms in v2.42.0 (which writes float
  histograms),
  it is a one-way street since older versions do not support
  float histograms.

  * [CHANGE] **breaking** TSDB: Changed WAL record format for the
    experimental native histograms. #11783
  * [FEATURE] Add 'keep_firing_for' field to alerting rules.
    #11827
  * [FEATURE] Promtool: Add support of selecting timeseries for
    TSDB dump. #11872
  * [ENHANCEMENT] Agent: Native histogram support. #11842
  * [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Support native histograms in recording
    rules. #11838
  * [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add container ID as a meta label for pod
    targets for Kubernetes. #11844
  * [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add VM size label to azure service
    discovery. #11650
  * [ENHANCEMENT] Support native histograms in federation. #11830
  * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Add gauge histogram support.
    #11783 #11840 #11814
  * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB/Scrape: Support FloatHistogram that
    represents buckets as float64 values. #11522 #11817 #11716
  * [ENHANCEMENT] UI: Show individual scrape pools on /targets
    page. #11142

- Update to final v2.0.0 release (bsc#1067341):
  + Compared to version 1.x, this release includes a completely rewritten
    storage engine, huge performance improvements, but also many backwards
    incompatible changes.  For more information, read the announcement blog
    post and migration guide:
    - https://prometheus.io/blog/2017/11/08/announcing-prometheus-2-0/
    - https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.0/migration/
  + Changes:
    * Completely rewritten storage layer, with WAL.  This is not backwards
      compatible with 1.x storage,  and many flags have changed/disappeared.
    * New staleness behavior. Series now marked stale after target scrapes
      no longer return them, and soon after targets disappear from service
      discovery.
    * Rules files use YAML syntax now.  Conversion tool added to promtool.
    * Removed count_scalar, drop_common_labels functions and keep_common
      modifier from PromQL.
    * Rewritten exposition format parser with much higher performance.  The
      Protobuf exposition format is no longer supported.
    * Example console templates updated for new storage and metrics names.
      Examples other than node exporter and Prometheus removed.
    * Admin and lifecycle APIs now disabled by default, can be reenabled via
      flags
    * Flags switched to using Kingpin, all flags are now --flagname rather
      than -flagname.
  + Features:
    * Remote read can be configured to not read data which is available
      locally.  This is enabled by default.
    * Rules can be grouped now.  Rules within a rule group are executed
      sequentially.
    * Added experimental GRPC apis
    * Add timestamp() function to PromQL.
  + Enhancements:
    * Remove remote read from the query path if no remote storage is
      configured.
    * Bump Consul HTTP client timeout to not match the Consul SD watch
      timeout.
    * Go-conntrack added to provide HTTP connection metrics.
  + Bug Fixes:
    * Fix connection leak in Consul SD.

      duration instead of returning an error.
