%description
The PatternClass package is built on the idea of token passing
networks building permutation pattern classes. Those classes are best
determined by their basis. Both sets can be encoded by rank encoding
their permutations. Each, the class and its basis, in their encoded
form build a rational language. Rational languages can be computed by
using automata, which also can be build directly from the token
passing networks. Both ways will build the same language, i.e. the
same automaton.
