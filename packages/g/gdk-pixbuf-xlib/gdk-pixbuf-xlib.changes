- Add 1.patch (MR!1): Headers are installed to the gdk-pixbuf-2.0
  subdir for backwards compatibility but the Cflags in the
  pkg-config file did not match that.
- Add 2.patch (MR!2): Subject: [PATCH] build: Declare public
  dependencies in pkg-config; gdk-pixbuf and X11 headers are
  included in public headers so they should be in Requires.
