- Update to 2.40.2
  * This is the first release of gdk-pixbuf-xlib, previous versions
    were based on gdk-pixbuf version 2.40.1
  * Last version provided with this packaged was git revision dc22ea36
  * There will be no future release as upstreams strongly
    encourages to port away from it (the API were already deprecated)
- Dropped upstream merged 1.patch and 2.patch
- Use SourceURL instead of _service file, see
  https://en.opensuse.org/SourceUrls

- Add 1.patch (MR!1): Headers are installed to the gdk-pixbuf-2.0
  subdir for backwards compatibility but the Cflags in the
  pkg-config file did not match that.
- Add 2.patch (MR!2): Subject: [PATCH] build: Declare public
  dependencies in pkg-config; gdk-pixbuf and X11 headers are
  included in public headers so they should be in Requires.
