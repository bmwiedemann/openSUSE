- Update turtle to version 1.6.1.
  1.6.1.

  * BUG FIX: Fix `turtle` to build on Windows
  * BUG FIX: `stripPrefix` and `commonPrefix` now correctly handle files with
    extensions
    * For example, before this fix `stripPrefix "./" "./foo.bar"` would
      return `Just "foo/.bar"`

  1.6.0

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Switch to the `FilePath` type from `base` instead of
    `system-filepath`
    * This is a breaking change for a couple of reasons:
      * The `FilePath` type has changed, so the API is not backwards-compatible
        * The thing most likely to break is if you directly imported utilities
          from the `system-filepath` or `system-fileio` packages to operate on
          `turtle`'s `FilePath`s
          * If that happens, you should first check if the `Turtle` module
            exports a utility of the same name.  If so, then switch to that
          * If there is no equivalent substitute from the `Turtle` module then
            you will have to change your code to use the closest equivalent
            utility from the `filepath` or `directory` package
          * If you were previously using any of the `system-filepath` or
            `system-fileio` utilities re-exported from the `Turtle` module then
            those utilities will not break as they have been replaced with
            versions compatible with the `FilePath` type from `base`
        * The second thing most likely to break is any code that relies on
          typeclasses since because if you defined any instances for the
          `FilePath` type exported by `turtle` then those instances will now
          overlap with any instances defined for the `String` type
        * The conversion utilities (e.g. `toText`, `encodeString`) will still
          work, so code that used those conversion utilities should be less
          affected by this change
      * The behavior of the `collapse` utility is subtly different
        * `collapse` no longer interprets `..` in paths
        * This new behavior is more correct in the presence of symlinks, so the
          change is (hopefully) an improvement to downstream code
    * The new API strives to match the old behavior as closely as possible
      * … so this should (hopefully) not break too much code in practice
      * With the exception of the `collapse` function the new API should be
        bug-for-bug compatible with the old API
        * Most of the surprising behavior inherited from the old API is around
          how `.` and `..` are handled in paths
          * `parent ".." == "."` is an example of such surprising behavior
      * At some point in the future we may fix bugs in these utilities inherited
        from `system-filepath` / `system-fileio`, but no decision either way has
        been made, yet
    * Some old utilities are marked `DEPRECATED` if their behavior exactly matches
      the behavior of an existing utility from the `filepath` or `directory`
      package
      * These may be eventually removed at some point in the future or they
        remain in a deprecated state indefinitely.  No decision either way has
        been made
      * The `Turtle` module also re-exports any utility suggested by a
        `DEPRECATED` pragma as a convenience
    * Other utilities are not deprecated if the old behavior significantly departs
      from any existing utility from the `filepath` or `directory` package
      * For example, the behavior of the `filename` utility differs from the
        behavior of `System.FilePath.takeFileName` for filenames that begin with a
        `.`, so we have to preserve the old behavior to avoid breaking downstream
        code
      * At some point in the future utilities like these may be deprecated in
        favor of their closest analogs in the `filepath` / `directory` packages or
        they may be supported indefinitely.  No decision either way has been made
    * If you want to try to author code that is compatible with both the
      pre-1.6 and post-1.6 API:
      * If you add any instances to the `FilePath` type, import it qualified
        directly from the `system-filepath` package and use it only for instances
      * Otherwise, don't import anything else from the `system-filepath` /
        `system-fileio` packages if you can help it.  Instead, restrict yourself
        entirely to the utilities and `FilePath` type exported by the `Turtle`
        module
      * Use the conversion utilities (e.g. `encodeStrings`, even if they are not
        necessary post-1.6)
      * If that's still not enough, use `CPP` and good luck!
