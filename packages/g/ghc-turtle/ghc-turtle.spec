%description
'turtle' is a reimplementation of the Unix command line environment in Haskell
so that you can use Haskell as both a shell and a scripting language.

Features include:

* Batteries included: Command an extended suite of predefined utilities

* Interoperability: You can still run external shell commands

* Portability: Works on Windows, OS X, and Linux

* Exception safety: Safely acquire and release resources

* Streaming: Transform or fold command output in constant space

* Patterns: Use typed regular expressions that can parse structured values

* Formatting: Type-safe 'printf'-style text formatting

* Modern: Supports 'text' and 'system-filepath'

Read "Turtle.Tutorial" for a detailed tutorial or "Turtle.Prelude" for a
quick-start guide

'turtle' is designed to be beginner-friendly, but as a result lacks certain
features, like tracing commands. If you feel comfortable using 'turtle' then
you should also check out the 'Shelly' library which provides similar
functionality.
