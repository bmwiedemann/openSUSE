- go1.15 (released 2020-08-11) Go 1.15 is a major release of Go.
  go1.15.x minor releases will be provided through August 2021.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  Most changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime,
  and libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise
  of compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
  Refs boo#1175132 go1.15 release tracking
  * See release notes https://golang.org/doc/go1.15. Excerpts
    relevant to OBS environment and for SUSE/openSUSE follow:
  * Module support in the go command is ready for production use,
    and we encourage all users to migrate to Go modules for
    dependency management.
  * Module cache: The location of the module cache may now be set
    with the GOMODCACHE environment variable. The default value of
    GOMODCACHE is GOPATH[0]/pkg/mod, the location of the module
    cache before this change.
  * Compiler flag parsing: Various flag parsing issues in go test
    and go vet have been fixed. Notably, flags specified in
    GOFLAGS are handled more consistently, and the -outputdir flag
    now interprets relative paths relative to the working
    directory of the go command (rather than the working directory
    of each individual test).
  * The GOPROXY environment variable now supports skipping proxies
    that return errors. Proxy URLs may now be separated with
    either commas (,) or pipe characters (|). If a proxy URL is
    followed by a comma, the go command will only try the next
    proxy in the list after a 404 or 410 HTTP response. If a proxy
    URL is followed by a pipe character, the go command will try
    the next proxy in the list after any error. Note that the
    default value of GOPROXY remains
    https://proxy.golang.org,direct, which does not fall back to
    direct in case of errors.
  * On a Unix system, if the kill command or kill system call is
    used to send a SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, or SIGFPE signal to a Go
    program, and if the signal is not being handled via
    os/signal.Notify, the Go program will now reliably crash with
    a stack trace. In earlier releases the behavior was
    unpredictable.
  * Allocation of small objects now performs much better at high
    core counts, and has lower worst-case latency.
  * Go 1.15 reduces typical binary sizes by around 5% compared to
    Go 1.14 by eliminating certain types of GC metadata and more
    aggressively eliminating unused type metadata.
  * The toolchain now mitigates Intel CPU erratum SKX102 on
    GOARCH=amd64 by aligning functions to 32 byte boundaries and
    padding jump instructions. While this padding increases binary
    sizes, this is more than made up for by the binary size
    improvements mentioned above.
  * Go 1.15 adds a -spectre flag to both the compiler and the
    assembler, to allow enabling Spectre mitigations. These should
    almost never be needed and are provided mainly as a "defense
    in depth" mechanism. See the Spectre Go wiki page for details.
  * The compiler now rejects //go: compiler directives that have
    no meaning for the declaration they are applied to with a
    "misplaced compiler directive" error. Such misapplied
    directives were broken before, but were silently ignored by
    the compiler.
  * Substantial improvements to the Go linker, which reduce linker
    resource usage (both time and memory) and improve code
    robustness/maintainability. Linking is 20% faster and requires
    30% less memory on average. These changes are part of a
    multi-release project to modernize the Go linker, meaning that
    there will be additional linker improvements expected in
    future releases.
  * The linker now defaults to internal linking mode for
    -buildmode=pie on linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, so these
    configurations no longer require a C linker.
  * There has been progress in improving the stability and
    performance of the 64-bit RISC-V port on Linux (GOOS=linux,
    GOARCH=riscv64). It also now supports asynchronous preemption.
  * crypto/x509: The deprecated, legacy behavior of treating the
    CommonName field on X.509 certificates as a host name when no
    Subject Alternative Names are present is now disabled by
    default. It can be temporarily re-enabled by adding the value
    x509ignoreCN=0 to the GODEBUG environment variable. Note that
    if the CommonName is an invalid host name, it's always
    ignored, regardless of GODEBUG settings. Invalid names include
    those with any characters other than letters, digits, hyphens
    and underscores, and those with empty labels or trailing dots.
  * crypto/x509: go1.15 applications with an AWS DB instance that
    was created or updated to the rds-ca-2019 certificate prior to
    July 28, 2020, you must update the certificate again. If you
    created your DB instance or updated its certificate after July
    28, 2020, no action is required. For more information, see
    go#39568
