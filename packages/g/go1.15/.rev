    <comment>- go1.15 (released 2020-08-11) Go 1.15 is a major release of Go.
  go1.15.x minor releases will be provided through August 2021.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  Most changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime,
  and libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise
  of compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
