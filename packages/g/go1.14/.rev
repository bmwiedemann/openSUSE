    <comment>go1.14 (released 2020-02-25) is a major release of Go.
Most changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime,
and libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise
of compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
compile and run as before.</comment>
