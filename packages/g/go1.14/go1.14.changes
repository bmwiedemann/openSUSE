- go1.14 (released 2020-02-25) is a major release of Go.
  go1.14.x minor releases will be provided through February 2021.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  Most changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime,
  and libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise
  of compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
  Refs boo#1164903 go1.14 release tracking
  * See release notes https://golang.org/doc/go1.14. Excerpts
    relevant to OBS environment and for SUSE/openSUSE follow:
  * Module support in the go command is now ready for production
    use, and we encourage all users to migrate to Go modules for
    dependency management.
  * RISC-V experimental support for 64-bit RISC-V on Linux
    (GOOS=linux, GOARCH=riscv64). Be aware that performance,
    assembly syntax stability, and possibly correctness are a work
    in progress.
  * When the main module contains a top-level vendor directory and
    its go.mod file specifies go 1.14 or higher, the go command now
    defaults to -mod=vendor for operations that accept that flag. A
    new value for that flag, -mod=mod, causes the go command to
    instead load modules from the module cache (as when no vendor
    directory is present).
  * When -mod=vendor is set (explicitly or by default), the go
    command now verifies that the main module's vendor/modules.txt
    file is consistent with its go.mod file.
  * go list -m no longer silently omits transitive dependencies
    that do not provide packages in the vendor directory. It now
    fails explicitly if -mod=vendor is set and information is
    requested for a module not mentioned in vendor/modules.txt.
  * The go get command no longer accepts the -mod flag. Previously,
    the flag's setting either was ignored or caused the build to
    fail.
  * mod=readonly is now set by default when the go.mod file is
    read-only and no top-level vendor directory is present.
  * modcacherw is a new flag that instructs the go command to leave
    newly-created directories in the module cache at their default
    permissions rather than making them read-only. The use of this
    flag makes it more likely that tests or other tools will
    accidentally add files not included in the module's verified
    checksum. However, it allows the use of rm -rf (instead of go
    clean -modcache) to remove the module cache.
  * modfile=file is a new flag that instructs the go command to
    read (and possibly write) an alternate go.mod file instead of
    the one in the module root directory. A file named go.mod must
    still be present in order to determine the module root
    directory, but it is not accessed. When -modfile is specified,
    an alternate go.sum file is also used: its path is derived from
    the -modfile flag by trimming the .mod extension and appending
    .sum.

- go1.14rc1 (released 2020/02/05) is a release candidate version of
  Go 1.14. It is cut from release-branch.go1.14 at the revision
  tagged go1.14rc1. go1.14rc1 is packaged before stable release of
  go1.14 to provide a preview of new default behavior for go
  modules. This early access is primarily intended to test use in
  offline OBS environment use with upstream go proxy infrastructure.
  * packaging: drop patch gcc9-rsp-clobber.patch now merged in go1.14
  * packaging: update version of LLVM compiler-rt
  * packaging: update _service definitions
  * packaging: update %doc entries rm devel/ add modules.md
  * doc: rename HTML element IDs to avoid duplicates
  * net: don't check LookupHost error in TestLookupNullByte
  * runtime: don't treat SIGURG as a bad signal
  * internal/bytealg: fix riscv64 offset names
  * doc: remove paragraph break for upgrading to modules
  * syscall: Revert "release a js.Func object in fsCall"
  * doc/go1.14: note that all changes to the standard library are minor
  * doc/go1.14: fix broken links
  * doc/go1.14: remove TODO about Solaris port
