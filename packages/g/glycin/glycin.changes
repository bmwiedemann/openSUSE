Sun Sep 28 22:29:48 UTC 2025 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 2.0.2:
  This release contains the following new component versions:

  - glycin-heif 2.0.2
  - glycin-jpeg2000 2.0.2
  - glycin-jxl 2.0.2
  - glycin-raw 2.0.2
  - glycin-svg 2.0.2
  - glycin-utils 4.0.2

  - Loaders in 2.0.1 required specifying the loop_animation field
    explicitly, making it incompatible with previous
    glycin/libglycin versions. The loop_animation is no assumed to
    be false when not present, as originally intended.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 28 22:29:10 UTC 2025 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 2.0.1:
  This release contains the following new component versions:

  - glycin-image-rs 2.0.1
  - glycin-utils 4.0.1
  - glycin 3.0.1
  - libglycin 2.0.1
  - libglycin-gtk4 2.0.1

  - glycin/libglycin: Add API to disable animation looping.
  - glycin/sandbox: Detect if bwrap can't be used due to syscalls
    being blocked. This is an indication of running in an already
    sandboxed environment like libgnome-desktop thumbnailer or a
    CI. In this case we fall back to unsandboxed mode.

  - Close all unused FDs in fork. Before we were sharing all FDs
    that don't have CLOEXEC set. In Rust that's usually not a
    problem because that's set by default. But when used by C in
    libglycin this is much more unclear. This is an attempt at
    fixing Firefox issues.
  - There was no timeout spawned that would ensure that unused
    loaders are killed after they have been unused for the
    specified maximum retention time.
  - glycin/sandobx: Canonicalize fontconfig paths before passing to
    --ro-bind-try as source because wrap fails on symlinks
    otherwise.
  - glycin: u16_to_u8 testcase on big endian machines
  - heif: Overwrite matrix coefficients (YCbCr) in CICP since
    currently RGB is forced and GSK gl and cairo don't support
    YCbCr. This fixes wrong colors in HEIC and AVIF images.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 18 14:48:15 UTC 2025 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add baselibs.conf: gdk-pixbuf-2_0-0-32bit requires libglycin-2-0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 18 07:02:23 UTC 2025 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Provide gdk-pixbuf-loader-rsvg: technically, glycin-loaders does
  provide the capability, as long as nobody tries to explicitly
  load the rsvg loader (which would be wrong on its own, as it's a
  gdk-pixbuf plugin).
- Require bubblewrap by glycin-loaders: unless run inside flatpak,
  glycin uses bubblewrap as sandbox.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 12 06:21:09 UTC 2025 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.0.0:
  + Use new versions of TIFF, GIF, PNG decoders, and image-rs to
    support more variants of these formats.
  + Using --clear-env actually breaks the portal due to a Flatpak
    bug
  + glycin/sandbox: Allow uname sycall for Arm64 SVE
  + glycin/sandbox: Pass XDG_RUNTIME_DIR env var to flatpak-spawn.
    This fixes flatpak-spawn not working.
  + libglycin-gtk4: List "glycin" in the public "Requires" for
    pkgconf
  + svg: Keep aspect ratio when scaling

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  9 13:01:52 UTC 2025 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Rename source package to glycin, matching the upstream name. The
  generated binary packages are all as before, as the glycin
  package is not being built anyway now after the mutlibuild dance
  from below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  9 08:12:00 UTC 2025 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Build package as multibuild in three passes; these flavors are
  built:
  + libglycin: the main library, no thumbnailers or loaders
  + gtk4: libglycin-gtk4, the gtk4 wrapper library
  + glycin-loaders: the loaders and thumbnailers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  1 09:36:06 UTC 2025 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.0.rc+1:
  + sandbox: Fix compilation on 32-bit architectures

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  1 08:24:10 UTC 2025 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.0.rc:
  + Added
    - Experimental untested JPEG 2000 loader with basic features.
      Is not enabled in builds by default.
    - glycin/sandbox: Support /nix to make it work on nixOS by
      default.
  + Fixed:
    - Environment not getting filtered for flatpak-spawn.
    - glycin/sandbox: Use configured PATH to find bwrap
  + Changed:
    - Don't pin to zbus 5.6, depend on 5.10 instead which fixes
      sandbox issues.
    - glycin/creator: Allow last line to not have complete stride
      length for GdkPixbuf compatibility
- Changes from verson 2.0.beta.3:
  + Added: Expose more API in libglycin that was needed by
    gdk-pixbuf glycin loaders to work correctly.
  + Fixed:
    - Allow `exit_group` syscall, needed by some systems to load
      SVGs.
    - Allow recv syscall since it is needed on PowerPC64 LE.
    - Apply rotation to the dimension in `Image` as well. They were
      correct in `Frame`s already.
    - Bump gufo-jpeg to fix editing some JPEGs saved with
      progressive mode.
    - Fix glycin-thumbnailer not working inside the thumbnailer
      sandbox due to an issue introduced in zbus 5.7. Pin to
      zbus 5.6 for now.
    - Regular unnecessary recompiles of components.
    - glycin/sandbox: Allow `{get,set}priority` syscalls, since
      they are used by libheif on Gentoo.
  + Changed:
    - Don't use the image-rs feature in jpegxl-rs to convert
      texture date to avoid a copy of the data. This speeds up
      loading.
    - glycin: Parallelize ICC profile transformations.
    - jxl: Use a parallel runner for decoding, reducing image
      loading times.
- Changes from version 2.0.beta.2:
  + Added:
    - CICP support for HEIC and AVIF.
    - jxl: Support saving images.
    - libglycin-gtk4: gly_gtk_frame_get_texture now sets the
      GdkColorState if a CICP value is present.
  + Fixed: glycin: Pool according to sandbox mechanism. Previously,
    a wrong mechanism could be used, if different mechanisms inside
    the same process were requested.
- Pass libglycin-gtk4=disabled to meson: do not yet build the Gtk4
  library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  1 18:05:55 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.2.3:
  + This release contains the following new component versions:
    - glycin-image-rs 1.2.3
  + Fixed: image-rs: Force at least zune-jpeg 0.4.19 to fix a JPEG
    loading issues for images with extra data at the end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 27 16:25:30 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.2.2:
  + This release contains the following new component versions:
    - glycin-image-rs 1.2.2
  + Fixed: image-rs: Force at least zune-jpeg 0.4.18 to fix
    multiple JPEG loading issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 11 13:55:37 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.2.1:
  + Fixed:
    - Fix editing for PNGs and JPEGs that are already rotated via
      an orientation tag in the Exif data.
    - Remove rotation via legacy Exif rotation entries when editing
      PNG images to not make them aditionally rotated after
      editing. This is a fix just for legacy Exif entries via tEXt
      and zTEx chunks with keyword "Raw profile type exif".
    - Revert to using sRGB instead of Rec2020 to pass images with
      ICC profile to GTK. This fixes some color deviations when
      displaying the images.
    - glycin: Allow additional syscalls needed for armv7 and on
      Alpine Linux in sandbox.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 14 14:00:48 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  + Changed: tests: Replace `serde_yml` crate with `serde_yaml_ng`
    due to questionable maintenance of the former. It is also
    possible to use the (unmaintained) `serde_yaml` crate instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 28 18:41:16 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.2.rc:
  + Fixed:
    - glycin-utils: Fix editing for images with more than 4 billion
      pixels.
    - glycin: Printing a color state error even if there is no
      problem.
    - jpeg: Allow to edit images with a dimension larger than 16384
      px.
    - jpeg: Handle pure rotation or mirror operations correct for
      non-sparse output. Also, properly combine multiple operations
      of this type into a single Exif change.
    - libglycin: Generate .vapi with correct names.
  + Changed:
    - glycin-utils: Handle clip width/height that would exceed the
      image boundaries gracefully by reducing them to the image
      boundaries.
    - glycin: Increased maximally considered RAM to 20GB for memory
      limits.
    - glycin: Use a specific error type for canceled operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + Changed: raw: Update to libopenraw 0.4.0-alpha.9 with Panasonic
    support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 28 08:13:46 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

    - glycin: API to list available editors with their supported operations.
    - image-rs/jpeg: Support for crop and flip in image editing.
    - image-rs/png: CICP support (variant of HDR content)
    - image-rs/png: Editing support for PNGs with crop, rotate, flip.
  + Changed:
    - Repository location is now `GNOME/glycin` on GNOME GitLab.
    - glycin: Images with an ICC color profile are now passed in
      Rec. 2020 linear color space to GTK, supporting a far wider
      color gamut than the sRGB format before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 28 08:13:44 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.1.6:
  + apng: Also support image/apng mime-type in loader.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 25 10:23:05 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.1.5:
  + Fixed: apng: Support image/apng mime-type to support animated
    PNGs again. This mime-type is now detected due to upstream
    changes at xdg/shared-mime-info.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  4 08:16:56 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.1.4:
  + Fixed:
    - image-rs: Support `image/qoi` mime-type for QOI in addition
      to `image/x-qoi`.
    - libglycin:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 17 08:46:52 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update URL and git url to new upstream home (GNOME core).
  Following this, run all services, ensure the new url works as
  expected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 11 08:45:45 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update vendor tarball (fixes build for i586). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 11:17:09 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.1.2:
  + Added: Output loader output as debug messages. The loader
    output is captured and added to errors. But it's not accessible
    if the loader doesn't return. In that case, this feature is useful.
  + Fixed:
    - Fix jpegxl-rs version to 0.10.3. Version 0.10.4 does not
      build on arm64 and builds libjxl instead of using the system
      library.
  + Fix memory format mapping for RGBA 32bit float image from
    image-rs. This fixes rendering for a lot of OpenEXR images.
  + glycin-heif: Disable bindgen for libheif-rs since it won't
    build with libheif 1.19 or newer otherwise.
- Drop glycin-loaders-libheif-non-default.patch: Upstream fixed the
  build issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 13 10:23:40 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update vendor tarball.
- Add glycin-loaders-libheif-non-default.patch: change setting to
  rebuild libheif-rs create as a workaround
  (gh#Cykooz/libheif-rs#28).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 25 07:28:00 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Temp disable update of vendors, stay with versions specified by
  upstream to fix build on aarch64 and ppc64le. Following this,
  "downgrade" the vendor tarball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 16 11:08:00 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.1.1:
  + Glycin failed to detect the SVGZ format since the files were
    just detected as gzip files via the magic bytes.
- Bump maximum version of pkgconfig(libjxl) BuildRequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 13 15:28:21 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.1.0:
  + Fixed: tests: Update to test image which uses an explicit font
    name in SVG, not depending on the correct default font setting
    on the system for the test to pass.
  + Changed: glycin-utils: Don't use regex feature of env-logger to
    save almost 1 MB binary size in each loader.
- Changes from version 1.1.beta:
  + Add tests for animations
  + Automatically detect if glycin is used inside a Flatpak
    development environment and disable sandbox in that case.
    Otherwise, flatpak-spawn wouldn't use the loaders from the
    right Flatpak or might not find a installed Flatpak at all.
  + Capture the stderr and stdout from loaders and editors and
    included it in the new ErrorCtx type that the API now returns.
  + Also include free swap as free memory in the calculation of how
    much memory a loader can use.
  + If the fontconfig cache was not up-to-date, rendering SVGs with
    text would fail. There is now a loader config option to enable
    passing a writable fontconfig cache dir into the loader
    sandbox. This fixes the issue. The cache is per loader binary.
  + Sealing memfds sometimes fails. Is is solved via retrying the
    seal until it works. In the past this was limited to very short
    time of retries. The interval is now much longer and properly
    async.
  + There was an error in the hardcoded limit for the texture size.
    The limit is now fixed and 8GB as intended.
- Changes from version 1.1.alpha:
  + A specific error if no loaders are configured instead of giving
    an unknown format error.
  + Bindings for C and other languages via GObject Introspection
    under the name libglycin and libglycin-gtk4.
  + Loaders are now accompanied by editors that can return an image
    with image operations applied.
  + Option to use tokio throughout instead of async-io.
  + glycin: List of mime types `glycin::DEFAULT_MIME_TYPES` that
    the default loaders support.
  + glycin: New loader option to apply transformations like
    rotate/mirror from metadata by default.
  + loaders: Use specific OutOfMemory error type.
  + glycin: Use a specific error type when no loaders are
    configured.
  + jxl: Libjxl version 0.10 is now required.
  + svg: Use C bindings in SVG loader to reduce binary size.
- Stop exporting rustflags, no longer needed.
- Add pkgconfig(librsvg-2.0), pkgconfig(lcms2), pkgconfig(lcms2),
  pkgconfig(gobject-introspection-1.0) and pkgconfig(vapigen)
  BuildRequires: New dependencies.
- Add new sub-packages and needed macros and Requires for them:
  + libglycin-1-0
  + libglycin-gtk4-1-0
  + typelib-1_0-Gly_1
  + typelib-1_0-GlyGtk4_1
  + glycin-loaders-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 08:02:58 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.0.1:
  + loaders/utils: Register SIGSYS handler as early as possible for
    better debugging for unallowed syscalls.
  + sandbox: Allow membarrier, open, stat syscalls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:06:39 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.0.0:
  + glycin: Change to stable crate version.
  + svg: Change to stable rsvg version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  4 07:58:53 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.0.rc:
  + glycin: Allow fstat syscall.
  + glycin: Treat files detected as XML as SVG if they have .svg
    file ending.
  + jxl: Allow libjxl 0.10 as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 23 09:29:38 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.0.beta.2:
  + api: Rename a few functions.
  + api: Use memfds for larger metadata like Exif or ICC profiles.
  + glycin/glycin-utils: Drop all uses of anyhow.
  + glycin/glycin-utils: Use thiserror to define types.
  + glycin: Check image width and height are not zero.
  + loaders/image-rs: Disable memory limits since we have our own.
  + loaders: Use new error utils tracking code location.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 19 17:53:15 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

  + Update to zbus 4.0.
  + glycin: Use more fine-tuned memory limits using max 80%
    available memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 16:05:17 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

  + Consitently use Loader instead of Decoder terminology in code.
  + glycin: Add seccomp filter based on allow list for bwrap
    sandboxes.
  + jxl: Support Exif.
- Changes from version 1.0.alpha:
  + Replace async-std with other crates
  + Use a new D-Bus API version 1+ allowing for backward compatible
    extendability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 30 12:58:21 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Run service with new obs-service-cargo, drop cargo_config as
  source and clean up spec and. Cargo_audit and cargo_config are
  now part of the cargo_vendor tarball/service, but in this case,
  since the sourcedir in _service is called glycin, we need to keep
  the manual set cargo_audit in _service to clear validation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 14 20:05:44 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.1.2:
  + GIF/APNG/WEBP: Assume frame length of 100ms if provided frame
    length is zero or invalid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 18 22:31:36 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Pass explicit
  loaders=glycin-heif,glycin-image-rs,glycin-jxl,glycin-svg to
  meson, ensure we build all the loaders.
- Update License tag following upstreams relicense.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 22 14:01:24 UTC 2023 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Initial package, version 0.1.beta.3.
