    <comment>- Update to version 2.0.2:
  This release contains the following new component versions:
  - glycin-heif 2.0.2
  - glycin-jpeg2000 2.0.2
  - glycin-jxl 2.0.2
  - glycin-raw 2.0.2
  - glycin-svg 2.0.2
  - glycin-utils 4.0.2
  - Loaders in 2.0.1 required specifying the loop_animation field
    explicitly, making it incompatible with previous
    glycin/libglycin versions. The loop_animation is no assumed to
    be false when not present, as originally intended.

- Update to version 2.0.1:
  This release contains the following new component versions:
  - glycin-image-rs 2.0.1
  - glycin-utils 4.0.1
  - glycin 3.0.1
  - libglycin 2.0.1
  - libglycin-gtk4 2.0.1
  - glycin/libglycin: Add API to disable animation looping.
  - glycin/sandbox: Detect if bwrap can't be used due to syscalls
    being blocked. This is an indication of running in an already
    sandboxed environment like libgnome-desktop thumbnailer or a
    CI. In this case we fall back to unsandboxed mode.
  - Close all unused FDs in fork. Before we were sharing all FDs
    that don't have CLOEXEC set. In Rust that's usually not a
    problem because that's set by default. But when used by C in
    libglycin this is much more unclear. This is an attempt at
    fixing Firefox issues.</comment>
