Tue Aug 17 22:34:51 UTC 2021 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- go1.17 (released 2021-08-16) is a major release of Go.
  go1.17.x minor releases will be provided through August 2022.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  Most changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime,
  and libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise
  of compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
  Refs boo#1190649 go1.17 release tracking
  * See release notes https://golang.org/doc/go1.17. Excerpts
    relevant to OBS environment and for SUSE/openSUSE follow:
  * The compiler now implements a new way of passing function
    arguments and results using registers instead of the
    stack. Benchmarks for a representative set of Go packages and
    programs show performance improvements of about 5%, and a
    typical reduction in binary size of about 2%. This is currently
    enabled for Linux, macOS, and Windows on the 64-bit x86
    architecture (the linux/amd64, darwin/amd64, and windows/amd64
    ports). This change does not affect the functionality of any
    safe Go code and is designed to have no impact on most assembly
    code.
  * When the linker uses external linking mode, which is the
    default when linking a program that uses cgo, and the linker is
    invoked with a -I option, the option will now be passed to the
    external linker as a -Wl,--dynamic-linker option.
  * The runtime/cgo package now provides a new facility that allows
    to turn any Go values to a safe representation that can be used
    to pass values between C and Go safely. See runtime/cgo.Handle
    for more information.
  * ARM64 Go programs now maintain stack frame pointers on the
    64-bit ARM architecture on all operating systems. Previously,
    stack frame pointers were only enabled on Linux, macOS, and
    iOS.
  * Pruned module graphs in go 1.17 modules: If a module specifies
    go 1.17 or higher, the module graph includes only the immediate
    dependencies of other go 1.17 modules, not their full
    transitive dependencies. To convert the go.mod file for an
    existing module to Go 1.17 without changing the selected
    versions of its dependencies, run: go mod tidy -go=1.17
    By default, go mod tidy verifies that the selected versions of
    dependencies relevant to the main module are the same versions
    that would be used by the prior Go release (Go 1.16 for a
    module that specifies go 1.17), and preserves the go.sum
    entries needed by that release even for dependencies that are
    not normally needed by other commands.
    The -compat flag allows that version to be overridden to
    support older (or only newer) versions, up to the version
    specified by the go directive in the go.mod file. To tidy a go
    1.17 module for Go 1.17 only, without saving checksums for (or
    checking for consistency with) Go 1.16: go mod tidy
    -compat=1.17
    Note that even if the main module is tidied with -compat=1.17,
    users who require the module from a go 1.16 or earlier module
    will still be able to use it, provided that the packages use
    only compatible language and library features.
    The go mod graph subcommand also supports the -go flag, which
    causes it to report the graph as seen by the indicated Go
    version, showing dependencies that may otherwise be pruned out.
  * Module deprecation comments: Module authors may deprecate a
    module by adding a // Deprecated: comment to go.mod, then
    tagging a new version. go get now prints a warning if a module
    needed to build packages named on the command line is
    deprecated. go list -m -u prints deprecations for all
    dependencies (use -f or -json to show the full message). The go
    command considers different major versions to be distinct
    modules, so this mechanism may be used, for example, to provide
    users with migration instructions for a new major version.
  * go get -insecure flag is deprecated and has been removed. To
    permit the use of insecure schemes when fetching dependencies,
    please use the GOINSECURE environment variable. The -insecure
    flag also bypassed module sum validation, use GOPRIVATE or
    GONOSUMDB if you need that functionality. See go help
    environment for details.
  * go get prints a deprecation warning when installing commands
    outside the main module (without the -d flag). go install
    cmd@version should be used instead to install a command at a
    specific version, using a suffix like @latest or @v1.2.3. In Go
    1.18, the -d flag will always be enabled, and go get will only
    be used to change dependencies in go.mod.
  * go.mod files missing go directives: If the main module's go.mod
    file does not contain a go directive and the go command cannot
    update the go.mod file, the go command now assumes go 1.11
    instead of the current release. (go mod init has added go
    directives automatically since Go 1.12.)
    If a module dependency lacks an explicit go.mod file, or its
    go.mod file does not contain a go directive, the go command now
    assumes go 1.16 for that dependency instead of the current
    release. (Dependencies developed in GOPATH mode may lack a
    go.mod file, and the vendor/modules.txt has to date never
    recorded the go versions indicated by dependencies' go.mod
    files.)
  * vendor contents: If the main module specifies go 1.17 or
    higher, go mod vendor now annotates vendor/modules.txt with the
    go version indicated by each vendored module in its own go.mod
    file. The annotated version is used when building the module's
    packages from vendored source code.
    If the main module specifies go 1.17 or higher, go mod vendor
    now omits go.mod and go.sum files for vendored dependencies,
    which can otherwise interfere with the ability of the go
    command to identify the correct module root when invoked within
    the vendor tree.
  * Password prompts: The go command by default now suppresses SSH
    password prompts and Git Credential Manager prompts when
    fetching Git repositories using SSH, as it already did
    previously for other Git password prompts. Users authenticating
    to private Git repos with password-protected SSH may configure
    an ssh-agent to enable the go command to use password-protected
    SSH keys.
  * go mod download: When go mod download is invoked without
    arguments, it will no longer save sums for downloaded module
    content to go.sum. It may still make changes to go.mod and
    go.sum needed to load the build list. This is the same as the
    behavior in Go 1.15. To save sums for all modules, use:
    go mod download all
  * The go command now understands //go:build lines and prefers
    them over // +build lines. The new syntax uses boolean
    expressions, just like Go, and should be less error-prone. As
    of this release, the new syntax is fully supported, and all Go
    files should be updated to have both forms with the same
    meaning. To aid in migration, gofmt now automatically
    synchronizes the two forms. For more details on the syntax and
    migration plan, see https://golang.org/design/draft-gobuild.
  * go run now accepts arguments with version suffixes (for
    example, go run example.com/cmd@v1.0.0). This causes go run to
    build and run packages in module-aware mode, ignoring the
    go.mod file in the current directory or any parent directory,
    if there is one. This is useful for running executables without
    installing them or without changing dependencies of the current
    module.
  * The format of stack traces from the runtime (printed when an
    uncaught panic occurs, or when runtime.Stack is called) is
    improved.
  * TLS strict ALPN: When Config.NextProtos is set, servers now
    enforce that there is an overlap between the configured
    protocols and the ALPN protocols advertised by the client, if
    any. If there is no mutually supported protocol, the connection
    is closed with the no_application_protocol alert, as required
    by RFC 7301. This helps mitigate the ALPACA cross-protocol
    attack. As an exception, when the value "h2" is included in the
    server's Config.NextProtos, HTTP/1.1 clients will be allowed to
    connect as if they didn't support ALPN. See issue go#46310 for
    more information.
  * crypto/ed25519: The crypto/ed25519 package has been rewritten,
    and all operations are now approximately twice as fast on amd64
    and arm64. The observable behavior has not otherwise changed.
  * crypto/elliptic: CurveParams methods now automatically invoke
    faster and safer dedicated implementations for known curves
    (P-224, P-256, and P-521) when available. Note that this is a
    best-effort approach and applications should avoid using the
    generic, not constant-time CurveParams methods and instead use
    dedicated Curve implementations such as P256. The P521 curve
    implementation has been rewritten using code generated by the
    fiat-crypto project, which is based on a formally-verified
    model of the arithmetic operations. It is now constant-time and
    three times faster on amd64 and arm64. The observable behavior
    has not otherwise changed.
  * crypto/tls: The new Conn.HandshakeContext method allows the
    user to control cancellation of an in-progress TLS
    handshake. The provided context is accessible from various
    callbacks through the new ClientHelloInfo.Context and
    CertificateRequestInfo.Context methods. Canceling the context
    after the handshake has finished has no effect.
    Cipher suite ordering is now handled entirely by the crypto/tls
    package. Currently, cipher suites are sorted based on their
    security, performance, and hardware support taking into account
    both the local and peer's hardware. The order of the
    Config.CipherSuites field is now ignored, as well as the
    Config.PreferServerCipherSuites field. Note that
    Config.CipherSuites still allows applications to choose what
    TLS 1.0–1.2 cipher suites to enable.
    The 3DES cipher suites have been moved to InsecureCipherSuites
    due to fundamental block size-related weakness. They are still
    enabled by default but only as a last resort, thanks to the
    cipher suite ordering change above.
    Beginning in the next release, Go 1.18, the Config.MinVersion
    for crypto/tls clients will default to TLS 1.2, disabling TLS
    1.0 and TLS 1.1 by default. Applications will be able to
    override the change by explicitly setting
    Config.MinVersion. This will not affect crypto/tls servers.
  * crypto/x509: CreateCertificate now returns an error if the
    provided private key doesn't match the parent's public key, if
    any. The resulting certificate would have failed to verify.
  * crypto/x509: The temporary GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0 flag has been
    removed.
  * crypto/x509: ParseCertificate has been rewritten, and now
    consumes ~70% fewer resources. The observable behavior has not
    otherwise changed, except for error messages.
  * crypto/x509: Beginning in the next release, Go 1.18,
    crypto/x509 will reject certificates signed with the SHA-1 hash
    function. This doesn't apply to self-signed root
    certificates. Practical attacks against SHA-1 have been
    demonstrated in 2017 and publicly trusted Certificate
    Authorities have not issued SHA-1 certificates since 2015.
  * go/build: The new Context.ToolTags field holds the build tags
    appropriate to the current Go toolchain configuration.
  * net/http package now uses the new (*tls.Conn).HandshakeContext
    with the Request context when performing TLS handshakes in the
    client or server.
  * syscall: On Unix-like systems, the process group of a child
    process is now set with signals blocked. This avoids sending a
    SIGTTOU to the child when the parent is in a background process
    group.
  * time: The new Time.IsDST method can be used to check whether
    the time is in Daylight Savings Time in its configured
    location.
  * time: The new Time.UnixMilli and Time.UnixMicro methods return
    the number of milliseconds and microseconds elapsed since
    January 1, 1970 UTC respectively.
  * time: The new UnixMilli and UnixMicro functions return the
    local Time corresponding to the given Unix time.
