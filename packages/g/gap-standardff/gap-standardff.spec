%description
StandardFF provides a reproducible construction of the algebraic closure K of
each finite prime field GF(p). It also implements the construction of
standardized generators of any given order of subgroups of the multiplicative
group of K.

The package contains some utility functions: embeddings of GAP's fields GF(q)
which are defined via Conway polynomials, rewriting of Brauer character values,
discrete logarithms in finite fields, irreducibility test and minimal
polynomials over finite fields.
