%description
Provides functions available in later versions of 'base' to a wider range of
compilers, without requiring you to use CPP pragmas in your code.

This package provides the same API as the
'<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-compat base-compat>' library, but
depends on compatibility packages (such as 'semigroups') to offer a wider
support window than 'base-compat', which has no dependencies. Most of the
modules in this library have the same names as in 'base-compat' to make it
easier to switch between the two. There also exist versions of each module with
the suffix '.Repl.Batteries', which are distinct from anything in
'base-compat', to allow for easier use in GHCi.

See
'<https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-compat/blob/master/base-compat/README.markdown#dependencies
here>' for a more comprehensive list of differences between 'base-compat' and
'base-compat-batteries'.
