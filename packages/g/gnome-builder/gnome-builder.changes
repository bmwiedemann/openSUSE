Wed Oct  5 08:07:30 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 43.2:
  + Use preferred $SHELL for $PATH discovery on host to ensure we
    pick up various $PATH modificiations.
  + Disable support for Fish when crossing container boundaries, it
    caused too many runtime compat issues. A default shell fallback
    will be used.
  + The meson plugin gained support for extracting run commands for
    executables installed to $prefix/bin.
  + Remove <> from insert-matching-braces.
  + gdbwire amalgamation updated for bugfixes.

    workaround from previous releases of Builder which causes
    errors with some C++ code.
  + Fix style-preview height in preferences window.
  + Fix TTY integration with podman containers so color terminals
    work with the build panel.
  + Include a backend-specific error message when version control
    cloning files in the greeter workspace.
  + Fix invalid property value in URL bar for webkit pages.
  + Port meson and cargo plugins to use run commands. This fixes an
    issue where run contexts don't know they need TTY support until
    too late. This affected podman usage.
  + Port git plugin to use run commands for submodule
    initialization. This also helps ensure we have TTY access.
  + Fix "hold" counts on document buffers so they cannot be
    reclaimed immediately after loading of the buffer completes.
  + When renaming files in the project-tree, the old file will be
    closed and the new file re-opened in it's place. Previously we
    only closed the file and did not re-open.

      or other tooling.
  + Please see the included NEWS file for all the changes made
    during the unstable releases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 17:46:00 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 43.alpha1:
  + This release is not intended for end-users.
    This is our first release of the GTK 4 port of GNOME Builder.
    It contains a significantly redesigned interface and foundry.
  + Given the size of the Builder project this port is not yet
    complete. It is far enough along to get testing from
    distributions and enthusiastic users alike. However, expect
    missing features and please don't overwhelm upstream with issue
    reports on that. First check the GTK 4 port issue to see if it
    is already known at
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-builder/-/issues/1675
  + Developer builds of Builder now use org.gnome.Builder.Devel as
    the application identifier so that we can allow parallel
    installing of nightly/stable Flatpaks.
  + While Builder still supports plugins written in Python, there
    are no more Python-based plugins bundled with Builder. We've
    stopped using the bindings ourselves due to instability. We may
    change our scripting language but that is for another time.
  + Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the GTK 4 port, it's
    been a full out scramble to port such a gigantic project in one
    cycle.
- Changes in BuildRequires following upstream changes:
  + Drop pkgconfig(gladeui-2.0), pkgconfig(gspell-1),
    pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0), pkgconfig(gtksourceview-4),
    pkgconfig(libhandy-1), pkgconfig(libportal-gtk3),
    pkgconfig(libsoup-2.4), pkgconfig(pangoft2),
    pkgconfig(sysprof-ui-4), pkgconfig(vte-2.91),
    pkgconfig(webkit2gtk-4.0) and pkgconfig(libdevhelp-3.0).
  + Add appstream-glib, desktop-file-utils, pkgconfig(dspy-1),
    pkgconfig(editorconfig), pkgconfig(gtk4),
    pkgconfig(gtksourceview-5), pkgconfig(libadwaita-1),
    pkgconfig(libpanel-1), pkgconfig(libportal-gtk4),
    pkgconfig(sysprof-capture-4), pkgconfig(sysprof-ui-5),
    pkgconfig(vte-2.91-gtk4) and pkgconfig(webkit2gtk-5.0).
- Validata appdata and desktop files during build.
- Update Supplements to current standard.
- Update rpmlintrc.
- Drop jhbuild sub-package, jhbuild support is ported to c, and no
  longer depends on the python package version.

    user operation has occurred like saving a file or a successful
    build.
  + LSP conformance improvements.

    allows switching branches using the context menu. This exposed
    a bug in libgit2-glib which has been fixed there too. We
    recommend packagers ensure that bug fix has landed in their

- Replace pkgconfig(enchant) BuildRequires with
  pkgconfig|(enchant-2): follow upstreams port to Enchant 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  5 19:23:03 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.27.92:
  + Licensing improvements to meson-templates.
  + Improvements for Language Server Protocol compliance.
  + The device manager has been improved to support selecting a
    device externally to the build configuration. UI is not
    currently exposed and may be in a future release.
  + The build configuration no longer contains a device.
  + A number of build pipeline changes were made to support
    building for an architecture other than the host.
  + The "local device" is now named "My Computer".
  + System architecture has been hoisted into the device info which
    allows to more easily support remove devices.
  + The code index builder tries harder to avoid blocking the main
    loop.
  + A number of components were moved into the build pipeline to
    more cleanly abstract device support.
  + The mingw plugin was dropped as it no longer fits into our
    design abstractions.
  + Updated translations.

    support.
  + Many leaks across a variety of plugins have been plugged.
  + The flatpak plugin tries even harder to avoid building projects

    build warnings while also using a real PTY for the terminal
    widget.
  + Ctags now inserts snippets for completion, allowing for
    parameters expansion.
  + Clang plugin now uses language spacing settings when expanding
    snippets. This allows for supression of spaces before opening
    parens.
  + Language defaults have been restored, and now properly set the
    fallback settings we intended.
  + We now log subprocess arguments when building.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 22:59:52 UTC 2017 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 3.26.1:
  + Fixes:
    - When using the XML editing extensions.
    - Error propragation when loading git repositories.
    - Home and End keys when in Vim normal mode.
    - Various bugs in debugger.
    - For various keyboard shortcut activation.
    - The python indenter when using compose keys with e or f.
    - (Re)selection of text when entering the search bar. This had
      the side effect of it appearing that your search term was
      silently being dropped after a few characters were typed.
    - A leak of editor views which was caused by Python lambda's in
      the html-preview plugin.
  + Improvements:
    - To Vim chords y$, yfX, de, db, and dw.
    - When pasting from external clipboard content.
  + Additions:
    - Flathub repo to list of known Flatpak runtime sources, which
      allows building against an org.kde.Sdk.
    - A new condensed "omni gutter" to reduce the width of the
      gutter in languages that support debugging.
  + Builder:
    - Now bundles uncrustify when built from Flatpak.
    - No longer includes tracing in stable flatpak build.
    - Builder will avoid showing the greeter when loading a project
      using the `gnome-builder -p project_file` command line
      argument. This speeds up direct loading of a project by about
      half.
    - Builder will attempt to use "gio trash" on the host when
      running.
  + The vsplit vim command now accepts a filename to open.
  + Use GNotification instead of manual D-Bus RPCs.
  + Significantly reduce chatter when notifying about builds.
  + Unsaved file buffers now use atomic renames when interacting
    with code diagnostic engines.
  + The editor attempts to avoid propagating resize events to the
    root window, which should help speed up the editor a fair
    amount.
  + Preferences loading has been delayed until project load time.
    This helps reduce application startup time.
  + The cursor now properly returns to the editor when leaving the
    global search entry.
  + The Fpaste plugin was removed as upstream API is changed too
    drastically to keep this plugin working.
  + Icons are now properly displayed in the document popover menu.
  + Tweaks to various UI CSS styling.
  + The debugger and profiler plugins now try harder to locate
    sources through .Debug or .Sdk flatpak runtimes when libraries
    missing debug symbols are encountered.
  + Preferences now properly release their addins on destruction.
  + The workbench was leaking addins on shutdown. They are now
    properly released, and the window is hidden before releasing
    addins to avoid showing widgets as they are destroyed.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop Fpaste plugin sub-package: Removed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + A new word completion provider that uses distance from cursor
    for sorting.
  + Documentation cards can now be shown using the
    "request-documentation" keybinding signal in the code editor.
  + A new code indexing engine that will index your project in the
    background to improve search and code navigation features is
    now included. Currently, only the clang plugin provides a
    suitable indexer, but other languages will be supported in the
    future.
  + A global search provider using the fuzzy-search code-index
    allows jumping to a function, class, and other language
    features.
  + A symbol resolver based on the code-index allows jumping
    between source and declarations.
  + Plugins can now register long running "pausable" operations
    with the project context. The code-index supports this for
    background indexing.
  + A technology preview for debugger integration has landed.
  + A reference debugger backend has been implemented using gdb.
  + Builder now tries to reduce the number of shell notifications
    it generates.
  + A new history plugin is added to bring back lost history
    functionality during the UI revamp.

  + Various project templates have been improved.
  + CSS style refinements.
  + Clang completion provider improvements.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 3.25.91:
  + Build systems can now implement an optimized path to extract
    build flags for multiple files at once. This will be useful for
    upcoming code indexing features.
  + Mkdir pipeline stages can now request that directories are
    reaped at cleanup.
  + The buffer manager can now protect against a single file being
    requested multiple times while a previous load is in-flight.
  + Various GAction fixes.
  + A new documentation-card plugin has been included as part of
    the Summer '17 GSoC work. It provides documentation on
    functions from devhelp when you hover the mouse pointer over a
    function or other type. It supports multiple backends, but only
    Devhelp is currently implemented.
  + A leak of various editor view plugins due to a bug in
    IdeExtensionSetAdapter has been plugged.
  + The beautifier plugin has been ported to the new UI design.

    sizes.
  + "Insert matching brance" has been moved to a per-language
    setting.
  + Updated translations.

    omnibar.
  + A crash in the diagnostics manager has been fixed due to
    incorrect assertions at runtime.
  + Many keyboard shortcut fixes.
  + The search bar has had missing pieces from the revamp ported.
    This includes better keyboard interactions.
  + Search navigation has been restored from the source editor.
  + Our BuilderBlocks font has been improved to support both lower
    and upper-case glyphs.
  + Builder no longer uses Gtk's setting for
    sort-directories-first.
  + Builder now supports a "run-opts" in .buildconfig files or
    x-run-args in flatpak json files to pass arguments when running
    the target application.
  + The spellchecker has had a number of fixes that were broken
    during the UI revamp.
  + find-other-file will jump right to the matching file if only
    one is matched. This more closely matches our previous
    implementation.
  + The build pipeline now recognizes filenames with _ in them when
    generating diagnostics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 22 09:51:03 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.25.5:
  + HTML Preview shortcut is fixed.
  + Various keybindings have been improved in libdazzle.

  + IdeSourceViewMode now holds a reference to the view and copies
    all GValues when marshaling to the proxied closure.
  + Focus tracking has been fixed for stacks in a single column.
  + The focus-neighbor action works again, allowing ^w^w and other
    Vim style keybindings to work correctly.
  + Activation of F-keys while in vim "normal mode" has been fixed.
  + Builder now depends on the proper version of GLib for access to
    g_ptr_array_find_with_equal_func().
  + MIT/X11 license has been updated to include a missing stanza.
  + Cross-architecture printf fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 18:41:03 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.25.4:
  + This release of Builder contains the largest UI change since
    the creation of Builder. As this is mid-development cycle
    towards GNOME 3.26, we anticipate breakage in this release.
    However, we value the time that people put into testing things
    for us and doubly so for those that file bugs.
  + Generally, we try to keep the master branch fairly stable and
    usable. This release will almost certainly have regressions due
    to the nature of the redesign.
  + A new keybinding engine is being used. It is very young but
    maturing quickly. Great pain has been experienced to merge the
    desires for features we need with the backwards compatability
    to keep existing features working such as the Vim compatability
    engine.
  + A new layout engine has been added. It has a few tricks up it's
    sleeve. It can animate widgets between grid locations. It also
    can highlight the view header to match the primary contents of
    the view. Under the hood, the implementation has been vastly
    simplified.
  + Over/under splits can now contain separate documents and you
    are no longer limited to two.
  + The project tree has been modified to look/feel more like a
    listbox. Future releases of Builder will keep the project-tree,
    but it will likely be disabled by default in favor of a
    DzlStackList-based navigation.
  + The TODO plugin has been ported to C. It goes through a
    reasonable amount of effort to keep memory allocations
    contiguous and footprint low.
  + Spellcheck has been moved into a plugin.
  + Color picker and spellcheck have been ported to use the new
    "transient sidebar". They come into focus when it makes sense
    for them to be visible based on context.
  + The symbol panel has been moved into the document header. It
    has also been styled to feel more like a listbox with hover
    state.
  + Devhelp browsing has been moved into the document header for
    the devhelp documentation view. It's a little bare at first,
    and we anticipate this to improve in future snapshots.
  + The terminal supports the "primary-color" feature to style the
    document header inline with the document content.
  + The build panel has been redsigned. It is placed on the left
    now to keep our workflow something like Left->Right.
  + The global search has been replaced to fit with the mockups, on
    the top-right corner of the window. We expect more improvements
    to search in upcoming releases.
  + The "new-document" button has been replaced with a menu for
    various types of new documents.
  + Many previous extension points now use menus.ui to populate
    their menu content. This makes extending menus much more
    consistent across Builder.
  + Document preferences (tab size, spaces, language, etc) have
    been moved into a transient sidebar. You can activate this with
    the menu item from the document header.
  + An "Open Pages" section has been added to the panel. It's not
    yet clear if this will continue to be enabled by default or if
    it will be a plugin that can be enabled.
  + The beautifier plugin has yet to be ported to the new engine,
    and therefore is disabled by default in this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 22 21:03:36 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.25.3:
  + The "egg" contrib package has been broken out into libdazzle.
    If you do not have libdazzle, it will be built as a subproject.
  + The "jsonrpc-glib" contrib package has been broken out into a
    standalone project. It will be built as a subproject if you do
    not have it installed.
  + The "template-glib" contrib package has been broken out into a
    standalone project. It will be built as a subproject if you do
    not have it installed.
  + Ctags completion priority has been lowered.
  + Many internals have been moved to an updated libdazzle. This
    includes lots of theming fixes as well as improved panels and
    theming integration. Many search data structures were also
    broken out into libdazzle.
  + The search provider has been rewritten to use libdazzle and the
    new suggestion entry. We expect more changes here before 3.26.
  + Builder now uses GVFS metadata to store the cursor position.
    This should improve the chances you end up on the right
    position when re-opening a buffer.
  + Panels now properly maintain their visibility state between
    runs of Builder.
  + The flatpak plugin now properly ignores runtimes ending in
    ".Sources".
  + Builder properly cleans up drafts fixing an issue where files
    with encoding errors would continually re-open when restoring
    Builder's internal state.
  + A "counters" window has been added to aide in debugging.
  + Builder now tries to do significantly less work while the
    buffer is opening. This should speed up file-loading on larger
    files.
  + Various async operation priority have been lowered to avoid
    stalling the Gtk main loop.
  + UI files now strip their empty space which should reduce the
    size of libide a small amount.
  + IdePerspective now has a restore_state vfunc. This helps ensure
    that the widget restores state after the UI has settled. This
    can help avoid hickups in the UI at startup.
  + Python Ide.py overrides now have helpers to log using
    g_warning() etc. See Ide.warning(), Ide.debug(),
    Ide.critical(), etc.
  + Additional documentation.
  + Updated Translations.

    specified.
  + The clone dialog will now strip whitespace from URIs.
  + Fixes in user-preferred-shell discovery.
  + The build panel is now shown upon first build (but without
    focus).
  + Before exporting, flatpak-builder will now be used to finish
    the build process and cleanup commands.
  + Builder will notify the user if flatpak-builder is not
    installed, as it is necessary for a good portion of the value
    of Builder.
  + Builder will look at manifest files to try to discover the
    build system. This is useful when projects have multiple build
    systems in transition.
  + Much polish to flatpak runtime installations.
  + Lots of Vala plugin fixes and cleanup due to recent Vala
    changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 14:20:01 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.23.91:
  + Lots of transfer engine improvements..
  + Omnibar styling changes.
  + Support for flatpak has stabilized a great deal.
  + New keyboard tooltips for various headerbar items.
  + Search within the terminal using ctrl+shift+f.
  + PTY fd ownership fixes for RustUp.
  + File search now ignores white-space.
  + libidemm and glibmm/gtkmm dependencies were dropped as nobody
    was using them and it will slow our migration to meson.
  + Various Jsonrpc improvements for language server communication.
  + A new valgrind plugin for leak tracking when testing your
    application.
  + Meson improvements when running under flatpak.
  + You can now start a new terminal inside the build runtime using
    ctrl+alt+shift+t.
  + Some new documentation is in the works, and available online at
    https://builder.readthedocs.io. We would love your
    contributions here.
  + The Open Project dialog now defaults to allowing you to select
    any project type with the default file filter.
  + More source beautifiers, including one for makefiles.
  + A workaround for a GObject type system deadlock as been added.
    This works around an issue where the type system would race
    initializing the GZlibDecompressor type from multiple threads.
  + Build pipeline subprocess launchers now inherit the environment
    configured from the build configuration.
  + Makecache can now handle out-of-order responses from make for
    lists of target binaries. This should improve Builder's ability
    to run your project successfully.
  + The Flatpak plugin no longer tries to build your project from
    /run/build/$project due to breaking mtime and general
    difficulty in keeping things consistent between subprocess
    executions. This has the side-effect of reducing the
    predictability of source location in debug symbols. But as
    flatpak-builder should be used for release builds, this seems
    fine.
  + Various workbench UI improvements.
  + Builder's Sysprof-based profiler can now profile applications
    launched inside of mount-namespaces, such as Flatpak.
  + Builder downloaded via Flatpak includes fixes for communicating
    with GNOME Code Assistance from a host installation.
  + Various memory leak fixes.
  + Flatpak-based configurations have improved their
    non-destructive write-back to disk upon changes.
  + Autogen-based projects have simplified init scripts.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop gnome-builder-flatpak-plugin-fix-array-overflow.patch and
  gnome-builder-flatpak-use-proper-sdk-name.patch: fixed upstream.

    stages into the pipeline at given phases. This provides much
    more flexability for plugins.
  + Significant improvements to XML plugin including a symbol
    resolver.
  + The symbol tree has a new style which makes it easier to
    browse.
  + Support for semantic spellchecking, including comments and
    strings.
  + Meson support has been improved and now supports building
    within flatpak runtimes.
  + A new beautifier plugin to cleanup source using external
    commands such as clang-format, indent, or xml-lint.
  + The build panel now has support for colored output from
    programs such as GCC.
  + Configurations are now abstracted through
    ConfigurationProviders so that plugins may provide
    configurations. This means that flatpak json manifests are now
    implemented as configurations.
  + The build-tools plugin has been moved to libide and should be
    removed from existing installations.
  + Support for building with CMake and Ninja build system.
  + Autotools, meson, cmake, ninja, cargo, flatpak, jhbuild plugins
    have been rewritten to support the build pipeline.
  + The terminal plugin now supports hyperlinks.

    transfers manager if it is missing and a build is required.
  + A race condition in accessing CFLAGS for the project as
    configured has been fixed due to the build pipeline.
  + Plugins can register files that should be ignored in the
    project tree.
  + Ctags now uses a custom TMPDIR for when ctags needs to create
    large files for use with sort. This is necessary as /tmp is
    typically not persistent storage and the files can get quite
    large for some projects like WebKit.
  + Vim emulation improvements.
  + Updated translations.
- Add pkgconfig(gspell-1) BuildRequires for spelling support.
- Add additional beautifier and cmake plugins as sub-packages:
  + Add the -plugin* subpackages as Recommends for the main
    gnome-builder package.

  + Allow libclang to parse files inside of Flatpak runtimes. This
    ensures that autocompletion and diagnostics work when building
    against org.gnome.Sdk.
  + Autotools will discover gmake vs make from the runtime.
  + A "clone and edit this flatpak" feature as been added using
    the -m command line option. This integrates with some
    GNOME-based compositors to allow an "edit this app" feature.
  + Various build system improvements.
  + Improved support for building flatpaks.
  + Improved support for the meson build system.
  + Builder depends on a newer VTE for various regex features and

    process.
  + Vim support has been improved to better support counts to
    change operations.
  + Build and runtime improvements for editorconfig.
  + Handle alt+0..n properly during auto-completion.
  + Builder now depends on json-glib-1.0. This was already likely
    required via dependencies before, but now is explicit.
  + 3.22.2 also includes a technology preview for Rust support. You
    can try this out by installing Rust nightly and the “rustls”
    package for integrated diagnostics, auto-completion, and
    sybmol-tree support.

  + Sysprof support is now automatically detected.
  + The devhelp search provider has been removed as it was better
    served via the Ctrl+Shift+F accelerator.
