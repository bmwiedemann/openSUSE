%description
The QPA package provides data structures and algorithms for doing
computations with finite dimensional quotients of path algebras, and
finitely generated modules over such algebras. The current version of
the QPA package has data structures for quivers, quotients of path
algebras, and modules, homomorphisms and complexes of modules over
quotients of path algebras.
