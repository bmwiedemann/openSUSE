  <title>Simple, Secure and Reliable Email Retriever</title>
  <description>getmail is intended as a simple, secure, and reliable replacement for
fetchmail. It retrieves email (either all messages, or only unread messages)
from one or more POP3, SPDS, or IMAP4 servers (with or without SSL) for one or
more email accounts, and reliably delivers into qmail-style Maildirs, mboxrd
files, or through external MDAs (command deliveries) specified on a per-account
basis. getmail also has excellent support for domain (multidrop) mailboxes,
including delivering messages to different users or destinations based on the
envelope recipient address.</description>
