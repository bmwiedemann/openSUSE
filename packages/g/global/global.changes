    Instead, config variable 'langmap' was actualized.
 [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
  * Removed GPATH,GTAGS,GRTAGS,GSYMS and html/ from the skip
    variable in gtags.conf file. From now on, gtags unconditionally
    ignore the tag files. Though 'html/' was added for Windows, it
    brought troubles for UNIX.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 15 09:56:53 UTC 2011 - puzel@novell.com

- update to global-5.9.4

- drop global-5.9.2-fix-htags-makefile.patch (in upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 10 15:32:55 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- switch to autoreconf for better libtool support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 17 15:21:20 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to global-5.9.2
  o gtags.vim: Added -m(--vim) option to the show command.
  o Renamed the -S(--secure-cgi) option to --system-cgi. This is
    because the parameter of the --secure-cgi was changed in
    GLOBAL-5.9.1.
  o The site key directory for the --system-cgi option was moved
    from datadir(/usr/local/share) to localstatedir(/usr/local/var)
    because datadir should be used for read-only data.  By default,
    you must execute "cd HTML; sh bless.sh" as a root user, since the
    site key directory can not be written except for root user.
- added global-5.9.2-fix-htags-makefile.patch (fixes build)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 20 19:55:39 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to global-5.9.1
 - notable changes since global-5.8
  o Caution:
    This version of GLOBAL doesn't support tag files of the former
    version.  If you install this version, you should remake all
    tag files again using gtags(1) in this package. Though new
    gtags's speed has improved very much, you need not hurry up to
    upgrade it if you have a lot of tag files of former version.
    Thank you for your cooperation.
  o gtags: New gtags.files file.
    If a file called 'gtags.files' exists in the current directory,
    gtags(1) treats it as a list of files which are candidates of
    the target.
  o Safe-CGI mechanism was modified.
  o globash: New command.
  o gtags, global, htags: Allows path name which includes blanks.
  o gtags, htags: Changed the algorithm for detecting binary file.
  o gtags: Added support of function layer plug-in parser by
    Hideki IWAMOTO.
  o htags: Added call-tree facility using cflow(1).
- clean up specfile
- add global-disable-plugin-example.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  5 15:05:11 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to global-5.8
 o gtags: Built-in parser by Hideki IWAMOTO.  This improvement has
   shortened the processing time to about 1/3.  Built-in parser is
   not effective by default in this version.  To use built-in parser,
   please define 'use_builtin_parser' in your configuration file
 o gtags.el: Single 'GTAGS SELECT MODE' buffer of gtags.el by Yushi
   Oka.  If "gtags-select-buffer-single" is non-nil, then 'GTAGS
   SELECT MODE' buffer is kept single.
 o gtags-cscope.vim: Plug-in script which integrates GLOBAL and vim
   editor using cscope interface. Since this script makes vim think
   GLOBAL is cscope, you can use the tag stack facility of vim like
   cscope. Gtags-cscope can coexist with gtags.vim.
 o gtags.el: the completion read in the gtags-find-file fails into
   endless loop when the input string is NULL.
 [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]:
 o gtags(built-in parser): In the existing parser (gtags-parser),
   some symbols were stored in both GRTAGS and GSYMS. In the built-in
   parser, all the symbols defined in GTAGS have been moved from
   GSYMS to GRTAGS. New specification is more consistent, and useful
   for efficiency improvement. If you feel this a problem, please
   inform bug mailing list of your insistence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 13:35:47 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to global-5.7.7
  o htags: More accurate statistics mechanism using gettimeofday(2)
    and getrusage(2).
  o gtags: New --statistics option.
  o gtags.el: Added completion support for the 'gtags-find-file'.
  o global: Allows tag files in the system's root directory.
    This does not recommend tag files to be put on the system's
	root directory.
    In some systems except UNIX, putting tag files there might be
	suitable.
  o The --from-here option didn't work with compact format
    GTAGS (gtags -c).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 13 16:07:55 UTC 2009 - puzel@novell.com

- update to 5.7.6
 - New options:
  o gtags: --single-update=file
    Update tag files for single file. It is considered that the file was updated,
    and other files were not updated. This option implies the -i option.
    If the file is new then --single-update is ignored, and the processing is
    automatically switched to the normal incremental updating.
  o gtags: --dump=tag-files
    Dump a tag file. Output format is 'key<tab>data'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 16 16:16:59 CET 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- update to 5.7.5
 - Change of gtags:
  - Revived the -c option.
    If this option is specified, gtags uses compact format for GTAGS.
    This option does not influence GRTAGS and GSYMS, because they are always
    made using compact format.
    If you think that GTAGS is too big, please use this option.
  - Removed the limitation of the depth of the directory hierarchy.
  - Changed not to do useless inspection for the files in the directories
    which are listed in the skip list.
- rebased patches

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  5 15:37:05 CET 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

  - gtags.el: New gtags-select-tag-other-window and gtags-find-tag-other-window
    command added
  - htags: Supported 'include', 'required' and 'required_once' statement in PHP

  Fixed bugs

  - gtags: Gtags causes segmentation fault if it read its input file names from
    a file list (use -f option), and the input files aren't in the working
    directory or its sub-directories

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 26 08:12:11 CET 2008 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to version 5.7

    In older version, such symbolic links were ignored with warning messages.
  o gtags-parser: Pick up the names of struct, union, enum and enum member
    as definitions.
  o gtags.el, gtags.vim, gtags.pl: More accurate, language independent context jump.

  Fixed bugs
  o gtags: Failed to process new GCC source code.
  o gtags.vim: Completion facility didn't work with the -f option of Gtags.
  o htags: Self-referred links.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 11:45:30 CET 2007 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to version 5.6.2
  * gtags-parser: In C++, ignore forward definitions of classes (e.g. "class name;")
  * gtags.conf: Added '.git/' to the DEFAULTSKIP list.
  * global: Global(1) with the -t option didn't print correct line number.
    Gtags.vim also didn't work correctly due to this bug. This bug was
    introduced in GLOBAL-5.4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  9 08:11:25 CEST 2007 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to version 5.6
  * All commands: According to the GNU coding standard,
    the --version option shows always verbose message without
    --verbose option.
  * gtags-parser: Added support of assembler directive ".macro"
    and ".equ".
  * global(1): Fix memory leak.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  7 17:45:24 CEST 2007 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to version 5.5
  * gtags-parser: Support of 'enum' (java).
  * gtags.el: Changed to work without event-point function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 30 15:11:20 CEST 2007 - rguenther@suse.de

- add emacs site-lisp directories

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 13 08:44:42 CET 2007 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to version 5.4.1
  * htags: Added new --item-order option.
    Specify order of items in the top page. The spec is a string
    consists of item signs in order. Each sign means as follows:
    c: caution, s: search form, m: mains, d: definition, f: files.
    The default is 'csmdf'.
  * fixed: htags: didn't extract some '#include' correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 29 08:41:24 CET 2007 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to 5.4
  * Further compression of tag file (format version 5).
    Though new global can read older tag file since version-5.0,
    older global cannot read new format.
  * global: Improved performance when the -x option
    is not specified.
  * globash.rc: Added new option -l for tag search command
    (x,r,s,g,P,I,f). This option invokes less(1) directly
    without tag stack.
  * global: Changed not to locate other symbols (-s)
    in GTAGSLIBPATH. This is the original specification of GLOBAL.
  * global: Stop sorting when the -I(--idutils) option specified.
    The output of gid(idutils) is sorted by the suitable way.
    Though the order is slightly differ from global(1), it need
    not be sorted again.
  * global:  Added new option -O(--only-other).
  * htags: Added some new options and new arguments which are
    synonyms of config variable. This decreases dependence
    on configration file
  * gtags.el:
    - Shorten path names in [GTAGS SELECT MODE]:
      If project directory is specified using
      'gtags-visit-rootdir', gtags.el print path using the relative
      path name from the project directory, else print absolute
      path name.
    - Support dynamic completing-read of tag name.
      gtags-make-complete-list is deprecated. You can enjoy
      tag name completetion without invoking this command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  8 14:51:29 CEST 2006 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to 5.2
  * htags: Added new options:
    - -h(--func-header) option.
    - -I(--icon) option.
    - -T(table-flist[=fields]) option.
  * htags: Always enable 'Grep pattern' form when the -f(--form)
    option specified. Removed config variable 'enable_grep'
    since it became meaningless. Instead, added a new variable
    'disable_grep'.
  * htags: Removed config variable 'enable_grep' since it is meaningless.
    Instead, added a new variable 'disable_grep'.
  * Changed the priority about the --result option to make the format
    specification easy. The --result option is given to priority more
    than the -t and -x option. (This option appeared in version 5.0.)
  * Added new program 'gtags-cscope'.
    Gtags-cscope is a pseudo cscope which implements the line-oriented
    interface. You can use this command for various clients instead of
    true cscope.
  * Moved to new tag format. (GTAGS, GRTAGS, GSYMS, GPATH)
    Hereafter, older tag format is not supported.
    Compact format was progressively canceled with the adoption of
    the new tag format. The -c(--compact) option of gtags(1)
    was removed.
