  * Allow spaces and most unicode characters in attachment links.

- Update jira-wiki-markup to version 1.3.4.
  1.3.4
  -----

  Released 2021-03-13.

  * Fixed parsing of autolinks (i.e., of bare URLs in the text).
    Previously an autolink would take up the rest of a line, as
    spaces were allowed characters in these items.

  * Emoji character sequences no longer cause parsing failures. This
    was due to missing backtracking when emoji parsing fails.

  * Block quotes are only rendered as `bq.` if they do not contain a
    linebreak.

Wed Jul  8 14:05:19 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update jira-wiki-markup to version 1.3.2.

  * Braces are now always escaped when printing; Jira treats braces
    specially, regardless of context.

  * Added support for links to anchors.

  * Styled text may not wrap across multiple lines; linebreaks in
    marked-up text are now forbidden.

  * Module Text.Jira.Parser.Core: new function `many1Till` which
    behaves like `manyTill`, but requires at least on element to be
    parsed.

  * Ensured the package works with GHC 8.10.

  * Support was added for additional syntax constructs:

      - citation markup (`??citation??`),
      - links to attachments (`[title^attachment.ext]`), and
      - user links (`[~username]`).

  * Changes to module `Text.Jira.Markup`:

      * A new data type `LinkType` is exported from the module.

      * Changes to type `Inline`:

	  - a new constructor `Citation` has been added;
	  - the `Link` constructor now takes an additional
	    parameter of type `LinkType`.

  * Fixed rendering of image attributes: image attributes are
    separated by commas instead of pipes; the latter are used in
    block parameters.

  * Fixed parsing of blockquotes which are not preceeded by blank
    lines.

  * Ensure parsing of single-line blockquotes is possible even if
    there is no space between `bq.` marker and contents.

  * Fixed parsing of colors: parsing no longer fails for hexcolors
    which contain non-decimal digits.

  * Changes to module `Text.Jira.Parser.Shared`:

      - New parsing function `colorName` which parses a color
	descriptor, i.e. either a name or a hexcolor.

  * Added check that a closing markup char is not preceeded by a
    whitespace character. Previously, plain text was still
    incorrectly treated as markup. E.g., the dashes in `-> step ->`
    used to be interpreted as delimiters marking deleted text.

  * Allows empty table cells; table parsing failed if one of the
    cells did not contain any content.

  * Changes to module `Text.Jira.Parser.Core`:

      - A field `stateLastSpcPos` was added to data type
	`ParserState` to keep track of spaces.
      - Function `updateLastSpcPos` was added to update the
	aforementioned field.
      - Function `afterSpace` was added to test the field.

Tue Jun 16 11:14:18 UTC 2020 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Re-generate file with latest version of spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 06:54:10 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update jira-wiki-markup to version 1.1.4.

  * Fixed parsing of image parameters. Thumbnails and images with
    parameters were previously not recognized as images.

  * Fixed table detection in endOfParagraph parser: Tables were
    expected to have a space between the leading pipe(s) and the
    cell content. Lines like `||Name|` were erroneously not
    recognized as the beginning of a new block.

  * Don't escape colon/semicolon unless necessary: it is necessary
    to escape colons or semicolons only if they could otherwise
    become part of a smiley.

  * Colon `:` and semicolon `;` are now parsed as special
    characters, since they can be the first characters of an emoji.

  * Fixed parsing of words which contain non-special symbol
    characters: word boundaries were not set correctly if a word
    contained a dot `.` or similar chars.

  * Fixed incorrect emphasis parsing: digits were erroneously allows
    as the first characters after closing emphasis characters.

  * Lists are now allowed to be indented; i.e., lists are still
    recognized if list markers are preceded by spaces.

  * Support for colored inlines has been added.

  * New constructor `ColorInline` for type `Inline` (API change).
