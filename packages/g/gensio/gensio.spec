%description
This is gensio (pronounced gen'-see-oh), a framework for giving a
consistent view of various stream (and packet) I/O types. You
create a gensio object (or a gensio), and you can use that gensio
without having to know too much about what is going on underneath.
You can stack gensio on top of another one to add protocol
funcionality. For instance, you can create a TCP gensio, stack SSL
on top of that, and stack Telnet on top of that. It supports a
number of network I/O and serial ports. gensios that stack on
other gensios are called filters.
