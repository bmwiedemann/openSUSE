- Update to version 2.3.4
  * Bugfix release
- Update to version 2.3.3
  * The major feature part of this is gensiot is rewritten to
    support a server mode, which allows it to continue to accept
    connections after a connection comes in. As part of this, it
    supports multiple threads, pidfiles, and output to syslog.
    This is useful as a stripped down ser2net, and also for
    creating a forwarding application, letting you convert a
    non-ssl connection to an ssl on, or receive ssl connections
    and forward them to a local application that doesn't support
    ssl.
  * The oomtests are getting better.

- Update to version 2.3.2
  * Bugfix release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 22 19:01:34 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- We build gensio with support for SCTP, MDNS and OpenIPMI; let's
  adjust the requirements for the -devel package accordingly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 17 15:00:28 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.3.1
  * C++ support. The interface was already OO, this is a mapping
    into C++. It's light, but not much was required.
  * Built-in TCL and glib OS handlers were added.
  * 2-factor authentication support is built-in to the certauth
    protocol.
  * Support for elliptical keys was added to certauth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 23 08:02:23 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Udpate to version 2.2.9
  * A user noticed that doing a "send break" operation on a telnet
    connection would crash ser2net. It would only happen if
    rfc2217 was not enabled. I've uploaded a new version to fix the
    issue.
- Udpate to version 2.2.8
  * This release adds 2-factor authentication support to gtlssh.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * fixes a compile error if openipmi is not installed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  9 19:12:52 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.2.1
  * rewritten the OpenIPMI SoL code so I could make it stable
    under adverse circumstances, and lots of fixes in the gensio
    code, it's stable and holds up well under duress.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 29 19:28:22 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.2.0
  * Support for mDNS in gtlssh.
  * Some minor bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  6 20:54:48 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.1.7
  * bugfix release only
  * No user visible changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 27 08:08:39 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.1.6
  * fixed quite a number of small issues and things that weren't
    quite right.
  * No user visible changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 24 21:07:14 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.1.5
  * You can now set permissions on unix socket files
  * gtlssh-keygen was extended to make it easier to install new
    keys and transfer them to other systems on a key update.
    Basically, you can generate a new key then issue a command to
    copy them to other systems using the old key.
  * gtlsshd was fairly broken handling passwords if you didn't get
    the first one right. I don't use passwords very much, and I
    haven't figured out a way to automate tests on it. But it
    should work ok now.
  * Fix some minor bugs and a possible (low probability) crash in
    stdio.
  * Add some tcpd capability for setting th ename per-gensio.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  9 14:29:54 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.1.4
  * telnet - There were some more negotiation issues.
  * serialdev - Fix issues with slow closes. A close could hang
    for a long time with pending write data, avoid this.
  * conacc - Added some extensions to make it more useful,
    general, and easy to test.
  * pty - Added the ability to create an unattached pty so another
    program can attach to it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 26 19:40:47 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.1.3
  * No major bug fixes or anything of that nature, some little
    things.
  The only bug that might be significant is with the pty gensio:
  it can close it's file descripter twice in some cases.
  New gensios:
  * perf - This is a fairly unusual gensio, but I created it so I
    could do performance measurements. It's fairly primitive, and I
    didn't uncover any performance issues in the gensio library
    itself, but I was useful to see how different buffer sizes
    affected performance. It does show that the Linux SCTP stack
    has some issues.
  * conacc - Another somewhat unusual gensio. This is a gensio
    accepter that takes a normal gensio string as a child. When
    started, it opens the gensio and when the open complete it
    reports a new gensio on the accepter. This has some
    interesting uses; see the docs for details.
  * Added missing man pages on the sergensio functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 12 11:01:43 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.1.2
  * lots of little corner cases and race conditions are fixed and
    a few minor enhancements. If you are using in a multithreaded
    application, or using UDP, the relpkt, or the mux gensios,
    you should certainly upgrade.
  * One minor semantic change. UDP sockets are now opened without
    SO_REUSEADDR set. The UDP tests were occasionally failing,
    and it turned out that the two parts of the tests would
    sometimes get the same port, with predictable results.
- Update to version 2.1.1
  * fixes a build issue on newer gccs, a doubly-defined variable
    that I don't know how didn't cause an issue before. I've also
    been enhancing the tests a bit, and that shook out a few
    memory leaks that are also fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  7 20:04:09 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Set CFLAGS+=-fcommon

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 16 12:49:11 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.5
  * Fix some license issues
- Update to version 2.0.4
  * ser2net will now retry accepters and connect back connectors
    if they fail to come up or get an error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 28 16:30:03 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.3
  * Add a control to allow stdio's stdin to be closed without
    closing the gensio. This will let you write some data and then
    cause the program to see EOF on stdin, but won't affect stdout
    or stderr from the program.
  * Add a config option to not install the man pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
