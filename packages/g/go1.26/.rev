    <comment>- go1.26.0 (released 2026-02-10) is a major release of Go.
  go1.26.x minor releases will be provided through February 2027.

  go1.26 arrives six months after Go 1.25. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.

  * Language change: The built-in new function, which creates a new
    variable, now allows its operand to be an expression,
    specifying the initial value of the variable.
  * Language change: The restriction that a generic type may not
    refer to itself in its type parameter list has been lifted. It
    is now possible to specify type constraints that refer to the
    generic type being constrained.
  * go command: The venerable go fix command has been completely
    revamped and is now the home of Go’s modernizers. It provides a
    dependable, push-button way to update Go code bases to the
    latest idioms and core library APIs. The initial suite of
    modernizers includes dozens of fixers to make use of modern
    features of the Go language and library, as well a source-level
    inliner that allows users to automate their own API migrations
    using //go:fix inline directives. These fixers should not
    change the behavior of your program, so if you encounter any
    issues with a fix performed by go fix, please report it.
  * go command: The rewritten go fix command builds atop the exact
    same Go analysis framework as go vet. This means the same
    analyzers that provide diagnostics in go vet can be used to
    suggest and apply fixes in go fix. The go fix command’s</comment>
