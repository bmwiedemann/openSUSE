    it for you.
  + Allow editting the machine's name through the title in
    properties view.
  + More keyboard shortcuts:
    - Ctrl+N for launching wizard.
    - Ctrl+F for launching search.
  + If internet connection is required for express installation by
    an OS:
    - ensure it is available before allowing to start express
      installation.

  + Replace hardcoded colors and background images with theme
    colors.

    interfere with user trying to reach WM decorations or apply
    edge gestures (as used in many modern operating systems) in the
    guest.
  + Don't show WM decorations in fullscreen. This is especially
    ugly in classic-mode where we have 3 buttons.
  + Drop weird and buggy custom thumbnail hilighting and enable it
    from gtk+ through latest libgd.
  + Fix max storage capacity going lower than min storage capacity.
  + Add F1 shortcut for help.
  + Allow selecting file from remote shares (for real this time).
  + Drop usage of deprecated APIs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 12 23:28:39 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 17 08:02:09 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

    getting stuck on preparation page.

    - Missing 'back' button on wizard's source URL page.
  + Add Alt+Left and Alt+Right shortcuts for going back and forward
    in different views.
  + Add Esc shortcut for cancelling wizard.
  + Focus 'Create' button on last page of wizard so that user can
    quickly confirm by hitting 'Enter'.
  + Existing disk capacity should not be taken into account to
    calculate the maximum value for disk capacity. It should simply
    be the space available on host disk.
  + Set disk size in correct units for running machines. We were
    setting size to valuex1024.
  + Refresh disk info after resizing disk of running machines.
    Otherwise we keep showing the older value when user goes back
    to properties.
  + Disable 'save on timeout' all together for storage volume size
    change since that easily leads to horrible user experience: You
    accidently increase the capacity to too high value and if you
    are not quick enough to change it again, you'll not be able to
    correct this ever as we don't support shrinking of volumes.
  + Allow shrinking storage volumes in wizard.
  + Fix a crasher bug.
  + Add info about runtime deps and reporting bugs to README.
  + Add a HACKING file for people interested in developing Boxes.
  + Report progress for non-http(s) downloads as well.

    most cases that results in user given the option to launch
    Boxes for an ISO9660 device and then Boxes failing to handle
    it.
  + Don't present CD-ROM and non-readable devices in wizard's
    source selection.
  + Don't try to copy non-existant avatar.
  + Remove some obsolete workarounds.

    to search through.

    cancelling the wizard at Introduction page.
  + Fix regression of file selection & URL entry buttons not
    appearing in wizard's source page.

- Update to version 3.11.90:
  + Show spinner while initializing.
  + Avoid warnings on console by only connecting to running
    displays.
  + Remove 'Reboot required' infobar from properties. This infobar
    was redundant and looked ugly. We do present a notification that
    says basically the same thing and it even offers a button to
    actually restart the machine.
  + Instead of spamming 'Reboot required' notifications each time
    user make a change, lets just show it once when user is done
    changing all the properties.
  + Avoid 'Yes' and 'No' buttons as per HIG in 'Reboot required'
    notification.

    GResource.
  + Ensure we use best CPU architecture for new VMs.
  + Fix handling of ISO9660 devices by more reliable check for
    media type.
  + Fix the issue of VMs not booting on certain CPUs. The downside
    is that users will now loose VMs' states if they change host
    CPU.
  + Reduced usage of clutter-gtk (Goal is to completely abondon
    it).
  + Add logo for RHEL 7.
  + Fixes to build system.

  + Express installation:
    - Use the new info text column to show the progress of the
      installation.

  + More reliable tracking of installations. Previously, Boxes used
    to forget ongoing installations once user quit the application
    and that would lead to installations looping forever.
  + Don't take post-installation steps for saved domains. Saved
    domains are stopped as well so them being stopped doesn't mean
    that first boot is done and its time to perform post install
    setup.
  + Launch new domain in fullscreen, unless express installations
    is going to be performed on it.
  + Make user deletion work for saved VMs.

  + Updated translations:
- Changes from version 3.3.3:
  + Instead of manually writing the libvirt's XML strings, we now
    make use of libvirt-gconfig to deal with the XML for us.
  + Protect user from accidental deletion of boxes by providing an
    'undo' button until after 6 seconds of deletion.
  + Rely on libvirt for automatic assignment of unique SPICE port
    for new VMs.
  + Don't destroy boxes on reboot.
  + Also entertain medias of i686 architecture.
  + Define a log domain for easier filtering of console log.
  + Adapt to libosinfo 0.0.3 API for better OS media detection.
  + Make the VM thumbnail in the properties view insensitive.
  + Box creation wizard:
    - Make wizard topbar a real toolbar. This way, the window can
      be moved, and it can be styled correctly.
    - Only return from wizard to collection view if box creation
      succeeds.
    - Skip directly to 'Preparation' step when URI is passed
      through commandline argument.
    - Bump default storage allocation to 20 GiB.
      . This should be adequate storage for most OSs out there.
      . We use the dynamically growing storage format (qcow2) so
        actual amount of disk space used is completely dependent on
        the OS.
    - Special handling of live and unknown OS media:
      . Create initially transient box and only make it permanent
        if media installs anything on the storage.
      . Skip 'Setup' and 'Review' pages.
    - Only boot new VMs from hard drive after something is actually
      installed on the storage.
    - Accept path for URI as well.
    - More details at summary page on VM creation.
    - Express installation:
      . Actually update the settings after the first install of an
        OS.
      . UI to set admin and user password.
      . UI for specifying product key for Windows XP and 2003.
        Note that product keys are not required by recent Windows
        (Vista, 7  and 2008) installers.
      . Install QXL on Fedora guests to take full advantage of
        SPICE's efficiency.
      . Enable X/graphics for Fedora.
      . Add user to admin group for Fedora.
      . Automatically timezone and keyboard layout setup. This
        currently only works for Fedora.
      . Automatically language setup. Currently it only works for
        Windows 7, Windows 2008 and Fedora.
      . Fix user account setup for Windows 7 and 2008.
      . Fix some fundamental issues with Windows 2008. Now at least
        most of the installation is automated.
      . Fix express installation floppy image and in turn express
        installation of Microsoft Windows XP.
