%description
MinTTY is a Windows-specific terminal emulator for the widely used Cygwin and
MSYS projects, which provide Unix-like environments for Windows.
MinTTY consoles behave differently from native Windows consoles (such as
'cmd.exe' or PowerShell) in many ways, and in some cases, these differences
make it necessary to treat MinTTY consoles differently in code.

The 'mintty' library provides a simple way to detect if your code in running in
a MinTTY console on Windows. It exports 'isMinTTY', which does the right thing
90% of the time (by checking if standard error is attached to MinTTY), and it
also exports 'isMinTTYHandle' for the other 10% of the time (when you want to
check is some arbitrary handle is attached to MinTTY). As you might expect,
both of these functions will simply return 'False' on any non-Windows operating
system.
