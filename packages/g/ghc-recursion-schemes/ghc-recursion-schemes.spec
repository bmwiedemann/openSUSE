%description
Many recursive functions share the same structure, e.g. pattern-match on the
input and, depending on the data constructor, either recur on a smaller input
or terminate the recursion with the base case. Another one: start with a seed
value, use it to produce the first element of an infinite list, and recur on a
modified seed in order to produce the rest of the list. Such a structure is
called a recursion scheme. Using higher-order functions to implement those
recursion schemes makes your code clearer, faster, and safer. See README for
details.
