- Fix setup.py to correctly identify the project packages git_deps
  and git_deps/listener. These were not being packaged and as a
  result the git-deps command was simply failing
- Add Fix-issue-with-unbuffered-text-I-O-under-python3.patch,
  which fixes the issue with unbuffered text I/O under python3,
  (gh#aspiers/git-deps#93).
