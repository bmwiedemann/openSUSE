* Changes in 0.8.1 (since 0.8)

** Package management

*** New ‘--share’ and ‘--expose’ options for ‘guix system vm’

See “Invoking guix system” in the manual.

*** Emacs mode now automatically loads newly installed Emacs packages

See “Emacs Initial Setup” in the manual.

*** ‘guix-daemon’ now defaults to ‘--cores=0 --jobs=1’

In other words, at any given time, only one derivation is being built or
substituted, and it can use as many cores as available.  Before, there could
be N derivations using N cores, which was obviously not desirable.

*** Command-line tools support the ‘GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS’ environment variable

See “Invoking guix build” in the manual.

*** ‘guix environment’ is faster

*** New ‘--recursive’ option for ‘guix archive’

See “Invoking guix archive” in the manual.

*** Missing patches required by a package definition are gracefully reported

*** ‘guix lint’ supports additional checkers

The new checkers are ‘gnu-description’, ‘home-page’, and ‘source’.
See “Invoking guix lint” in the manual.

*** New CPAN importer for ‘guix import’

See “Invoking guix import” in the manual.

** Distribution

*** USB installation image has more tools

Tools added since 0.8: wpa_supplicant, cryptsetup, and iw.

*** Linux kernel module dependencies are automatically handled

Before that, all the modules needed in the initrd would need to be explicitly
listed, including their dependencies, and in topological order.

*** Font packages now all have a name starting with ‘font-’

See “Fonts” in the manual.

*** Shell startup files have been cleaned up

/etc/profile contains only environment variable definitions, which may also be
used when running a different shell.  The skeletons for user’s ‘.bash_profile’
and ‘.bashrc’ files behave as documented in the Bash manual.  Zsh is supported.

*** The ‘root’ account gets a copy of the account skeleton files

Before that, the skeleton files would only be copied to non-root accounts.

*** The name service cache daemon (nscd) is configurable

By default it aggressively caches host and service lookups.  See “Base
Services” in the manual.

*** Available locale definitions are now declared in ‘operating-system’

Before, the ‘glibc’ package would contain all the existing locales, as well as
the ‘locale-archive’ file, amounting to 110 MiB.  See “Locales” in the manual.

*** SLiM sessions are configurable

Pressing F1 in the SLiM graphical log-in screen allows users to choose among
the pre-configured session types.  See “X Window” in the manual.

*** Man pages and Info files are systematically gzip-compressed

*** ‘gnu-build-system’ ensures that documentation is in share/{man,info}

If a package installs to $prefix/{man,info}, this is automatically fixed to be
$prefix/share/{man,info}.

*** ‘strip’ is invoked only on ELF files and ‘ar’ archives

*** ‘libtool’ and ‘libltdl’ are now separate packages

*** Emacs mode is readily usable on the Guix System Distribution

*** Substitutes are now enabled by default on freshly installed systems
*** 164 new packages

** Programming interfaces

*** New (guix elf) and (gnu build linux-modules) modules

These provide resolution of Linux kernel module dependencies.  See
<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2014-11/msg00670.html>.

*** ‘glib-or-gtk-build-system’ has been extended

It now handles GIO and XDG themes, takes care of generating the icon cache,
and has a new #:glib-or-gtk-wrap-excluded-outputs parameter.

*** ‘search-path-specification’ can now specify non-directory items

For example, the ‘search-path-specification’ attached to libxml2 specifies a
file pattern, which allows all the ‘catalog.xml’ files to be added to the
‘XML_CATALOG_FILES’ environment variable.

*** (guix build syscalls) has more network-related procedures

‘set-network-interface-flags’, ‘set-network-interface-address’,
‘network-interface-address’, and ‘configure-network-interface’ are ioctl
bindings used by network-handling dmd services.

*** (guix monads) refactoring

‘%store-monad’ is now in (guix store) and is an alias for the new
‘%state-monad’ provided by (guix monads).  Monadic procedures dealing with the
store, with derivations, and with packages have been moved from (guix monads)
to (guix store), (guix derivations), and (guix packages).  See “The Store
Monad” in the manual.

*** (guix build utils) provides ‘parallel-job-count’

*** ‘wrap-program’ preserves the original argv[0]

*** New (guix sets) module

*** ‘define-record-type*’ now support “delayed” fields

** Noteworthy bug fixes

*** X session is executed from a login shell (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19119>)
*** grub.cfg is now a garbage-collector root (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19160>)
*** Substituter progress report properly formatted 
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19313>)
*** Document permissions for /gnu/store (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19316>)
*** Make sure config.go is newer than config.scm
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19317>)
*** Emacs knows where to find its GLib schemas (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19138>)
*** Adjust 'grub.cfg' to work on systems with a separate /boot
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19220>)
*** Fix removal of next-to-last item in a profile
    (<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2014-12/msg00292.html>)
*** Apply patches with "patch --force" (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19402>)
*** Extend ‘search-path-specification’ for libxml2-style use cases
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18033>)
*** Search for patches under $GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19364>)
*** Use executables from the target inputs in 'patch-shebangs'
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18895>)
*** guix-daemon now automatically creates '…/profiles/per-user'
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19315>)
*** Make /etc/mtab a symlink to /proc/self/mounts
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19491>)
*** Don't build the mips64el-linux-gnuabi64 cross-compiler on i686
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19598>)
*** Read archive signatures as Latin-1 strings (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19610>)
*** Raise an error for references to non-existent outputs
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19630>)
*** Initialize libgcrypt before use (<http://bugs.gnu.org/19677>)

** Native language support

*** New translations: fr (French), hu (Hungarian)
*** Updated translation: eo, vi

*** ‘guix package’ has a new ‘--switch-generation’ option

See “Invoking guix package” in the manual.

*** ‘guix-daemon’ has a new ‘--substitute-urls’ option

See “Invoking guix-daemon” in the manual.

** Distribution

*** The stand-alone operating system now supports Linux mapped devices

See “Mapped Devices” in the manual.

*** New fields in ‘operating-system’ declarations, better documentation

New fields include ‘hosts-file’, ‘mapped-devices’, and ‘swap-devices’.
See “operating-system Reference” in the manual.

*** New services: ‘dhcp-client-service’, ‘bitlbee-service’, ‘ntp-service’

See “Services” in the manual.

*** Free firmware can be loaded

This notably enables support for some Atheros-based WiFi devices (ath9k-htc.)
See “operating-system Reference” in the manual.

*** ‘grub-configuration’ declarations can now specify a theme

See “GRUB Configuration” in the manual.

*** The ‘base-initrd’ now has a different signature

Existing uses in ‘operating-system’ declarations need to be updated.  See
“Initial RAM Disk” in the manual for details.

*** eudev is now used by default, instead of an old udev release

*** ‘guix system vm’ has a new ‘--full-boot’ option

See “Invoking guix system” in the manual.

*** The ‘file’ command is now part of the package build environment

Autoconf-generated ‘configure’ scripts for packages using Libtool use ‘file’
to determine the target ABI, notably on MIPS, hence this change.

** Programming interfaces

*** New ‘ruby-build-system’, for Ruby packages

See “Build Systems” in the manual.

*** New ‘glib-or-gtk-build-system’, for packages using GLib schemas

See “Build Systems” in the manual.

*** ‘gnu-build-system’ has a new #:substitutable? parameter

This allows packagers to mark a package as requiring a local build, thus
preventing it from being substituted by a pre-built binary.

*** ‘cmake-build-system’ has a new #:build-type parameter

See “Build Systems” in the manual.

*** The ‘supported-systems’ field of packages is used more consistently

This allows packagers to prevent attempts to build a package on a given
architecture when that architecture is known not to be supported.  The
‘package-transitive-supported-systems’ procedure returns the intersection of
the systems supported by the given package and by its dependencies.

*** The ‘wrap-program’ procedure can now be called multiple times

*** New ‘graft-derivations’ and ‘package-grafts’ procedures

They implement “grafts”, as described under “Security Updates” in the manual.

*** New “bag” intermediate representation for use by build systems

“Bags” are used internally as an intermediate representation between packages
and derivations.  See “Build Systems” in the manual.

*** New (guix monad-repl) module, for monadic interaction at the REPL

See “The Store Monad” in the manual.

*** New (guix build emacs-utils) module, to facilitate building Emacs packages

*** New (guix tests) module, with tools used by the test suite

*** The internal ‘guix-register’ command now deduplicates files in store items

*** Several system modules moved from (guix build …) to (gnu build …)

Also, the (gnu build linux-boot) module has been introduced, with code
typically used by initial RAM disks when booting on GNU/Linux-libre.

*** (guix profiles) provides a representation of package transactions

This factorizes code between ‘guix package’ and the Emacs user interface.

*** Bootstrapping packages moved to (gnu packages commencement) modules

** Bugs fixed

*** ‘guix-daemon’ now really deduplicates store items by default

Deduplication means that identical files found in /gnu/store are stored only
once, using hard links.  This feature was wrongfully disabled, and is now
enabled by default.  The former ‘--disable-store-optimization’ option has been
renamed to ‘--disable-deduplication’.

*** ‘guix-daemon’ no longer uses ‘vfork’

This could cause problems with ancient Linux kernel.

*** Fixed compilation of ‘gccgo’ (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18101>)
*** 'make clean' doesn't delete os-config.tmpl (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18243>)
*** Fix handling of periods by fill-paragraph (<http://bugs.gnu.org/17468>)
*** Produce a top-level Info 'dir' file (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18305>)
*** guix offload ignores unreachable machines (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18070>)
*** guix offload: Ignore EEXIST when registering a .drv as a GC root
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18115>)
*** perl-tk: Build sequentially (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18262>)
*** download: Use the 'SERVER NAME' TLS extension when possible
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18526>)
*** libdaemon: Add alternate source URLs (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18639>)
*** icu4c: Reinstate RUNPATH on shared libraries 
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18695>)
*** nss-mdns: Add alternate source URLs (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18704>)
*** download: Add "Accept: */*" to the HTTP headers
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18768>)
*** guix-register: Do not attempt to create NIX_STORE_DIR 
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18689>)
*** Allow Linux-libre to find our 'modprobe' command
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18525>)
*** man-pages: Build sequentially (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18701>)
*** Fix intermittent test failures involving GC (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18935>)
*** guix import: pypi: Gracefully handle non-existent packages 
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18831>)
*** Make sure the shared library has the '.so' extension
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18521>)
*** pull: Use the build procedure provided by the newly-downloaded Guix.
    (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18534>)
*** WindowMaker no longer pollutes $PATH (<http://bugs.gnu.org/18698>)

** Native language support
