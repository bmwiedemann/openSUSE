%description
This package provides head normal form strict versions of some standard Haskell
concurrency abstractions (MVars,Chans), which provide control over where
evaluation takes place not offered by the default lazy types. This may be
useful for deciding when and where evaluation occurs, leading to improved time
or space use, depending on the circumstances.
