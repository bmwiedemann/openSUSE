%description
This package provides functions for converting emoji names to emoji characters
and vice versa.

How does it differ from the 'emoji' package?

- It supports a fuller range of emojis, including all those supported by GitHub
- It supports lookup of emoji aliases from emoji - It uses Text rather than
String - It has a lighter dependency footprint: in particular, it does not
require aeson - It does not require TemplateHaskell.
