Sun Oct  2 20:37:30 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.6.6
  * Now computing better labels for bibliography entries
    containing names with certain non-ASCII initials.
  * Fixed sorting of index entries containing special characters
    `<`, `>`, `&`, `\` or `_` .
  * Added a first version of `StringBibXMLEntry` for Markdown
    format.
  * Changed 'XMLValidate' and 'ValidateGAPDoc' to print a warning
    without error, when the IO package or 'xmllint' is not
    available.

Wed Nov 14 22:21:29 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.6.2
  * Improved "InitialSubstringUTF8String" by an optional argument
    to return a string with a suffix.
  * Change access of javascript code for MathJax to https
    protocol (such that MathJax works for help pages accessed via
    https).
  * Added option ".uri := true" to 'SearchMR' to return URI
    instead of sending a request to MathSciNet.
  * Added many cases handled by 'HeuristicTranslationsLaTeX2XML',
    this is needed because MathSciNet has changed the markup for
    accented characters in many cases.
  * Made 'SearchMR' work again using 'wget' or 'curl' (MathSciNet
    is now only accessible via HTTPS).
  * Better ordering of help matches if the first word is the
    query string.
  * Escape the special characters @!|" for 'makeindex' in index
    entries for LaTeX.
  * Removed dependency on 'a4wide.sty' file in LaTeX installation.

- Update to new upstream release 1.6
  * Changed and documented the handling of <Alt Only="LaTeX">
    elements; its content is not reformatted.
  * Can now handle help books with empty bibliography.
  * Introduce finer distinction of <Alt>-elements for HTML
    with/without MathJax.
  * 'StringBibXMLEntry' supports now a 'rec(MathJax := true)'
    option.
  * Added a new utility function 'InitialSubstringUTF8String'.
  * 'NormalizedNameAndKey' can now find initials from UTF-8
    encoded name strings.
  * New function 'LabelsFromBibTeX'. If BibTeX is available this
    is used to unify the labels used for citations and the
    ordering of the reference list in the LaTeX, text and HTML
    version of a GAPDoc document.
  * Recognize document encoding in <?xml tag and in some other
    places case insensitively.
