%description
'hslogger' is a logging framework for Haskell, roughly similar to [Python's
logging module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html).

'hslogger' lets each log message have a priority and source be associated with
it. The programmer can then define global handlers that route or filter
messages based on the priority and source. 'hslogger' also has a
[Syslog](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) handler built in.
