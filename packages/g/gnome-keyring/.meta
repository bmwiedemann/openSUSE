  <title>GNOME Keyring Password Manager</title>
  <description>The GNOME Keyring is a daemon in the session, similar to ssh-agent,
and other applications can use it to store passwords and other
sensitive information.

The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
disk, but forgotten when the session ends.</description>
