Fri May 18 13:26:45 UTC 2018 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 1.12.0:
  Core:
  * Update protobuf submodule to 3.5.2 (#15114)
  * Make GrpcBuffer{Reader|Writer} Public (#14541)
  * Compile Out Tracers Option (#15108)
  * Fix bug in an address sorting comparison (#15208)
  * Fix: Check retry timer before starting resolving (#15156)
  * Fix c-ares resolution with default authority (#15073)
  * Fix c-ares resolver crash when DNS server unreachable (#15134)
  * Performance: Avoid low severity log message construction (#14945)
  * Peformance: Enable SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH on Windows (#14905)
  C#:
  * Add RpcException.StatusCode property (#15140)
  * Improvements to C# build instructions (#15178)
  Python:
  * Eliminate grpcio package dependency on protobuf package (#15034).
    Please pay extra attention if you are using gRPC with Protocol Buffers and
    your deployment scripts do not explicitly list the correct dependencies
    and used to rely on the transitive Python package dependency from grpcio to protobuf.
  * A new grpc.Channel.close method is introduced and correct use of gRPC
    Python now requires that channels be closed after use. No existing code
    should observably break when upgrading to 1.12 but code that creates
    channels but does not close them will not be supported in 1.13 and later.
  Core:
  * Fix: Check retry timer before starting resolving (#15156)
  * Fix c-ares resolution with default authority (#15073)
  * Fix c-ares resolver crash when DNS server unreachable (#15134)
  * Add core underpinnings for TLS session ticket support (#14483)
  * Experimental support for configurable retries (use at your own risk) (#10684)
  * Fail calls with wait_for_ready=false on transient resolver failure (#14733)
  * Fix a call stack ref flake (#14681)
  * c-ares DNS resolver sorts resolved addresses per RFC 6724 (#13290)
  * Use socklen_t instead of size_t for address length (fixes use case for some
    big endian systems) (#14464)
  * Initial part of channel tracing implementation (#13883, #14746, #14751)
  * Avoid crashes on environments with hot-plugged CPUs (#14712)
  * When building from source, Makefile now checks for minimum protobuf
    version 3.5.0 instead 3.0.0 (#14821)
  * gRPC Core public header no longer includes inttypes.h (#14676)
  * CMake improvements:
    * Add well-commented examples and continuous test for various ways of
      building gRPC as a dependency (via ExternalProject_Add in #14822,
      via add_subdirectory in #14864)
    *     Remove internal tools from binaries installed by cmake install (#14850)
    *     Simplify Android build example (#14885)
  * Enable SO_REUSEPORT in IPv6-only environments as well (#14748)
  C#:
  * Improvements in experimental support for Unity - added useful resources
    and improved support for loading grpc_csharp_ext on Unity (#14576, #14605)
  * Further prevent name collisions by using only fully qualified type
    names in C# code generator (#14524)
  * Fix C# connectivity watcher shutdown race (#14776)
  Objective-C:
  * Support for Keep-Alive (#14781)
  * Experimental C++ podspec now supports Apple framework (#14480)
  * Allow discarding generated implementation (leaving only protocol)
    with macro (#14490)
  * Better handling of network error (#14554)
  PHP:
  * Add missing -O2 compilation flag for pecl (#14768)
  * Update the reserved variable list to check in PHP code generator to
    match protobuf 3.5.0 (#13580)
  Python:
  * Progress towards full Beta API elimination (Beta API is and has been
    unsupported and will go away completely):
    Remove _face_interface_test tests for the Beta API (#14702)
  * Remove Python background poller thread (#14448)
    Note there is a small change in behavior. Before, clients would
    detect disconnected channels immediately.
  * Initial gevent compatibility (EXPERIMENTAL) (#14561)
  * Release the GIL when calling grpc_call_start_batch to improve
    performance under multithreaded scenarios. (#14801)
  Ruby:
  * Correct handling of underscores in package names by Protocol Buffers code
    generator for Ruby (#13634)
  * Source code and locally compiled (not cross-compiled) shared libraries
    (grpc_c.so files) are removed from the linux binary packages. This includes
    the packages targeting the x86_64-linux and x86-linux platforms (#14634)
  * Bug fix for a use-after-free related to access to a garbage collected
    object (#14809)
