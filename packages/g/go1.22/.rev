    <comment>New package go1.22 version rc1 submitted for testing.

Due to prjconf Prefer: go most Go application packages will only
be built with go1.22 once a subsequent SR is submitted bumping
the go metapackage to version 1.22.</comment>

    <comment>- go1.22 (released 2024-02-06) is a major release of Go.
  go1.22.x minor releases will be provided through February 2024.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.22 arrives six months after go1.21. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
