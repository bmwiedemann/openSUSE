- go1.22 (released 2024-02-06) is a major release of Go.
  go1.22.x minor releases will be provided through February 2024.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.22 arrives six months after go1.21. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
  Refs boo#1218424 go1.22 release tracking
  * Language change: go1.22 makes two changes to for loops.
    Previously, the variables declared by a for loop were created
    once and updated by each iteration. In go1.22, each iteration
    of the loop creates new variables, to avoid accidental sharing
    bugs. The transition support tooling described in the proposal
    continues to work in the same way it did in Go 1.21.
  * Language change: For loops may now range over integers
  * Language change: go1.22 includes a preview of a language change
    we are considering for a future version of Go:
    range-over-function iterators. Building with
    GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc enables this feature.
  * go command: Commands in workspaces can now use a vendor
    directory containing the dependencies of the workspace. The
    directory is created by go work vendor, and used by build
    commands when the -mod flag is set to vendor, which is the
    default when a workspace vendor directory is present.  Note
    that the vendor directory's contents for a workspace are
    different from those of a single module: if the directory at
    the root of a workspace also contains one of the modules in the
    workspace, its vendor directory can contain the dependencies of
    either the workspace or of the module, but not both.
  * go get is no longer supported outside of a module in the legacy
    GOPATH mode (that is, with GO111MODULE=off). Other build
    commands, such as go build and go test, will continue to work
    indefinitely for legacy GOPATH programs.
  * go mod init no longer attempts to import module requirements
    from configuration files for other vendoring tools (such as
    Gopkg.lock).
  * go test -cover now prints coverage summaries for covered
    packages that do not have their own test files. Prior to Go
    1.22 a go test -cover run for such a package would report: ?
    mymod/mypack [no test files] and now with go1.22, functions in
    the package are treated as uncovered: mymod/mypack coverage:
    0.0% of statements Note that if a package contains no
    executable code at all, we can't report a meaningful coverage
    percentage; for such packages the go tool will continue to
    report that there are no test files.
  * trace: The trace tool's web UI has been gently refreshed as
    part of the work to support the new tracer, resolving several
    issues and improving the readability of various sub-pages. The
    web UI now supports exploring traces in a thread-oriented
    view. The trace viewer also now displays the full duration of
    all system calls.  These improvements only apply for viewing
    traces produced by programs built with go1.22 or newer. A
    future release will bring some of these improvements to traces
    produced by older version of Go.
  * vet: References to loop variables The behavior of the vet tool
    has changed to match the new semantics (see above) of loop
    variables in go1.22. When analyzing a file that requires go1.22
    or newer (due to its go.mod file or a per-file build
    constraint), vetcode> no longer reports references to loop
    variables from within a function literal that might outlive the
    iteration of the loop. In Go 1.22, loop variables are created
    anew for each iteration, so such references are no longer at
    risk of using a variable after it has been updated by the loop.
  * vet: New warnings for missing values after append The vet tool
    now reports calls to append that pass no values to be appended
    to the slice, such as slice = append(slice). Such a statement
    has no effect, and experience has shown that is nearly always a
    mistake.
  * vet: New warnings for deferring time.Since The vet tool now
    reports a non-deferred call to time.Since(t) within a defer
    statement. This is equivalent to calling time.Now().Sub(t)
    before the defer statement, not when the deferred function is
    called. In nearly all cases, the correct code requires
    deferring the time.Since call.
  * vet: New warnings for mismatched key-value pairs in log/slog
    calls The vet tool now reports invalid arguments in calls to
    functions and methods in the structured logging package,
    log/slog, that accept alternating key/value pairs. It reports
    calls where an argument in a key position is neither a string
    nor a slog.Attr, and where a final key is missing its value.
  * runtime: The runtime now keeps type-based garbage collection
    metadata nearer to each heap object, improving the CPU
    performance (latency or throughput) of Go programs by
    1-3%. This change also reduces the memory overhead of the
    majority Go programs by approximately 1% by deduplicating
    redundant metadata. Some programs may see a smaller improvement
    because this change adjusts the size class boundaries of the
    memory allocator, so some objects may be moved up a size class.
    A consequence of this change is that some objects' addresses
    that were previously always aligned to a 16 byte (or higher)
    boundary will now only be aligned to an 8 byte boundary. Some
    programs that use assembly instructions that require memory
    addresses to be more than 8-byte aligned and rely on the memory
    allocator's previous alignment behavior may break, but we
    expect such programs to be rare. Such programs may be built
    with GOEXPERIMENT=noallocheaders to revert to the old metadata
    layout and restore the previous alignment behavior, but package
    owners should update their assembly code to avoid the alignment
    assumption, as this workaround will be removed in a future
    release.
  * runtime: On the windows/amd64 port, programs linking or loading
    Go libraries built with -buildmode=c-archive or
    -buildmode=c-shared can now use the SetUnhandledExceptionFilter
    Win32 function to catch exceptions not handled by the Go
    runtime. Note that this was already supported on the
    windows/386 port.
  * compiler: Profile-guided Optimization (PGO) builds can now
    devirtualize a higher proportion of calls than previously
    possible. Most programs from a representative set of Go
    programs now see between 2 and 14% improvement from enabling
    PGO.
  * compiler: The compiler now interleaves devirtualization and
    inlining, so interface method calls are better optimized.
  * compiler: go1.22 also includes a preview of an enhanced
    implementation of the compiler's inlining phase that uses
    heuristics to boost inlinability at call sites deemed
    "important" (for example, in loops) and discourage inlining at
    call sites deemed "unimportant" (for example, on panic
    paths). Building with GOEXPERIMENT=newinliner enables the new
    call-site heuristics; see issue #61502 for more info and to
    provide feedback.
  * linker: The linker's -s and -w flags are now behave more
    consistently across all platforms. The -w flag suppresses DWARF
    debug information generation. The -s flag suppresses symbol
    table generation. The -s flag also implies the -w flag, which
    can be negated with -w=0. That is, -s -w=0 will generate a
    binary with DWARF debug information generation but without the
    symbol table.
  * linker: On ELF platforms, the -B linker flag now accepts a
    special form: with -B gobuildid, the linker will generate a GNU
    build ID (the ELF NT_GNU_BUILD_ID note) derived from the Go
    build ID.
  * linker: On Windows, when building with -linkmode=internal, the
    linker now preserves SEH information from C object files by
    copying the .pdata and .xdata sections into the final
    binary. This helps with debugging and profiling binaries using
    native tools, such as WinDbg. Note that until now, C functions'
    SEH exception handlers were not being honored, so this change
    may cause some programs to behave differently.
    -linkmode=external is not affected by this change, as external
    linkers already preserve SEH information.
  * bootstrap: As mentioned in the Go 1.20 release notes, go1.22
    now requires the final point release of Go 1.20 or later for
    bootstrap. We expect that Go 1.24 will require the final point
    release of go1.22 or later for bootstrap.
  * core library: New math/rand/v2 package: go1.22 includes the
    first “v2” package in the standard library, math/rand/v2. The
    changes compared to math/rand are detailed in proposal
    go#61716. The most important changes are:
    - The Read method, deprecated in math/rand, was not carried
      forward for math/rand/v2. (It remains available in
      math/rand.) The vast majority of calls to Read should use
      crypto/rand’s Read instead. Otherwise a custom Read can be
      constructed using the Uint64 method.
    - The global generator accessed by top-level functions is
      unconditionally randomly seeded. Because the API guarantees
      no fixed sequence of results, optimizations like per-thread
      random generator states are now possible.
    - The Source interface now has a single Uint64 method; there is
      no Source64 interface.
    - Many methods now use faster algorithms that were not possible
      to adopt in math/rand because they changed the output
      streams.
    - The Intn, Int31, Int31n, Int63, and Int64n top-level
      functions and methods from math/rand are spelled more
      idiomatically in math/rand/v2: IntN, Int32, Int32N, Int64,
      and Int64N. There are also new top-level functions and
      methods Uint32, Uint32N, Uint64, Uint64N, Uint, and UintN.
    - The new generic function N is like Int64N or Uint64N but
      works for any integer type. For example a random duration
      from 0 up to 5 minutes is rand.N(5*time.Minute).
    - The Mitchell & Reeds LFSR generator provided by math/rand’s
      Source has been replaced by two more modern pseudo-random
      generator sources: ChaCha8 PCG. ChaCha8 is a new,
      cryptographically strong random number generator roughly
      similar to PCG in efficiency. ChaCha8 is the algorithm used
      for the top-level functions in math/rand/v2. As of go1.22,
      math/rand's top-level functions (when not explicitly seeded)
      and the Go runtime also use ChaCha8 for randomness.
    - We plan to include an API migration tool in a future release,
      likely Go 1.23.
  * core library: New go/version package: The new go/version
    package implements functions for validating and comparing Go
    version strings.
  * core library: Enhanced routing patterns: HTTP routing in the
    standard library is now more expressive. The patterns used by
    net/http.ServeMux have been enhanced to accept methods and
    wildcards. This change breaks backwards compatibility in small
    ways, some obvious—patterns with "{" and "}" behave
    differently— and some less so—treatment of escaped paths has
    been improved. The change is controlled by a GODEBUG field
    named httpmuxgo121. Set httpmuxgo121=1 to restore the old
    behavior.
  * Minor changes to the library As always, there are various minor
    changes and updates to the library, made with the Go 1 promise
    of compatibility in mind. There are also various performance
    improvements, not enumerated here.
  * archive/tar: The new method Writer.AddFS adds all of the files
    from an fs.FS to the archive.
  * archive/zip: The new method Writer.AddFS adds all of the files
    from an fs.FS to the archive.
  * bufio: When a SplitFunc returns ErrFinalToken with a nil token,
    Scanner will now stop immediately. Previously, it would report
    a final empty token before stopping, which was usually not
    desired. Callers that do want to report a final empty token can
    do so by returning []byte{} rather than nil.
  * cmp: The new function Or returns the first in a sequence of
    values that is not the zero value.
  * crypto/tls: ConnectionState.ExportKeyingMaterial will now
    return an error unless TLS 1.3 is in use, or the
    extended_master_secret extension is supported by both the
    server and client. crypto/tls has supported this extension
    since Go 1.20. This can be disabled with the tlsunsafeekm=1
    GODEBUG setting.
  * crypto/tls: By default, the minimum version offered by
    crypto/tls servers is now TLS 1.2 if not specified with
    config.MinimumVersion, matching the behavior of crypto/tls
    clients. This change can be reverted with the tls10server=1
    GODEBUG setting.
  * crypto/tls: By default, cipher suites without ECDHE support are
    no longer offered by either clients or servers during pre-TLS
    1.3 handshakes. This change can be reverted with the
    tlsrsakex=1 GODEBUG setting.
  * crypto/x509: The new CertPool.AddCertWithConstraint method can
    be used to add customized constraints to root certificates to
    be applied during chain building.
  * crypto/x509: On Android, root certificates will now be loaded
    from /data/misc/keychain/certs-added as well as
    /system/etc/security/cacerts.
  * crypto/x509: A new type, OID, supports ASN.1 Object Identifiers
    with individual components larger than 31 bits. A new field
    which uses this type, Policies, is added to the Certificate
    struct, and is now populated during parsing. Any OIDs which
    cannot be represented using a asn1.ObjectIdentifier will appear
    in Policies, but not in the old PolicyIdentifiers field. When
    calling CreateCertificate, the Policies field is ignored, and
    policies are taken from the PolicyIdentifiers field. Using the
    x509usepolicies=1 GODEBUG setting inverts this, populating
    certificate policies from the Policies field, and ignoring the
    PolicyIdentifiers field. We may change the default value of
    x509usepolicies in Go 1.23, making Policies the default field
    for marshaling.
  * database/sql: The new Null[T] type provide a way to scan
    nullable columns for any column types.
  * debug/elf: Constant R_MIPS_PC32 is defined for use with MIPS64
    systems. Additional R_LARCH_* constants are defined for use
    with LoongArch systems.
  * encoding: The new methods AppendEncode and AppendDecode added
    to each of the Encoding types in the packages encoding/base32,
    encoding/base64, and encoding/hex simplify encoding and
    decoding from and to byte slices by taking care of byte slice
    buffer management.
  * encoding: The methods base32.Encoding.WithPadding and
    base64.Encoding.WithPadding now panic if the padding argument
    is a negative value other than NoPadding.
  * encoding/json: Marshaling and encoding functionality now
    escapes '\b' and '\f' characters as \b and \f instead of \u0008
    and \u000c.
  * go/ast: The following declarations related to syntactic
    identifier resolution are now deprecated: Ident.Obj, Object,
    Scope, File.Scope, File.Unresolved, Importer, Package,
    NewPackage. In general, identifiers cannot be accurately
    resolved without type information. Consider, for example, the
    identifier K in T{K: ""}: it could be the name of a local
    variable if T is a map type, or the name of a field if T is a
    struct type. New programs should use the go/types package to
    resolve identifiers; see Object, Info.Uses, and Info.Defs for
    details.
  * go/ast: The new ast.Unparen function removes any enclosing
    parentheses from an expression.
  * go/types: The new Alias type represents type
    aliases. Previously, type aliases were not represented
    explicitly, so a reference to a type alias was equivalent to
    spelling out the aliased type, and the name of the alias was
    lost. The new representation retains the intermediate
    Alias. This enables improved error reporting (the name of a
    type alias can be reported), and allows for better handling of
    cyclic type declarations involving type aliases. In a future
    release, Alias types will also carry type parameter
    information. The new function Unalias returns the actual type
    denoted by an Alias type (or any other Type for that matter).
  * go/types: Because Alias types may break existing type switches
    that do not know to check for them, this functionality is
    controlled by a GODEBUG field named gotypesalias. With
    gotypesalias=0, everything behaves as before, and Alias types
    are never created. With gotypesalias=1, Alias types are created
    and clients must expect them. The default is gotypesalias=0. In
    a future release, the default will be changed to
    gotypesalias=1. Clients of go/types are urged to adjust their
    code as soon as possible to work with gotypesalias=1 to
    eliminate problems early.
  * go/types: The Info struct now exports the FileVersions map
    which provides per-file Go version information.
  * go/types: The new helper method PkgNameOf returns the local
    package name for the given import declaration.
  * go/types: The implementation of SizesFor has been adjusted to
    compute the same type sizes as the compiler when the compiler
    argument for SizesFor is "gc". The default Sizes implementation
    used by the type checker is now types.SizesFor("gc", "amd64").
  * go/types: The start position (Pos) of the lexical environment
    block (Scope) that represents a function body has changed: it
    used to start at the opening curly brace of the function body,
    but now starts at the function's func token.
  * html/template: Javascript template literals may now contain Go
    template actions, and parsing a template containing one will no
    longer return ErrJSTemplate. Similarly the GODEBUG setting
    jstmpllitinterp no longer has any effect.
  * io: The new SectionReader.Outer method returns the ReaderAt,
    offset, and size passed to NewSectionReader.
  * log/slog: The new SetLogLoggerLevel function controls the level
    for the bridge between the `slog` and `log` packages. It sets
    the minimum level for calls to the top-level `slog` logging
    functions, and it sets the level for calls to `log.Logger` that
    go through `slog`.
  * math/big: The new method Rat.FloatPrec computes the number of
    fractional decimal digits required to represent a rational
    number accurately as a floating-point number, and whether
    accurate decimal representation is possible in the first place.
  * net: When io.Copy copies from a TCPConn to a UnixConn, it will
    now use Linux's splice(2) system call if possible, using the
    new method TCPConn.WriteTo.
  * net: The Go DNS Resolver, used when building with
    "-tags=netgo", now searches for a matching name in the Windows
    hosts file, located at %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts,
    before making a DNS query.
  * net/http: The new functions ServeFileFS, FileServerFS, and
    NewFileTransportFS are versions of the existing ServeFile,
    FileServer, and NewFileTransport, operating on an fs.FS.
  * net/http: The HTTP server and client now reject requests and
    responses containing an invalid empty Content-Length
    header. The previous behavior may be restored by setting
    GODEBUG field httplaxcontentlength=1.
  * net/http: The new method Request.PathValue returns path
    wildcard values from a request and the new method
    Request.SetPathValue sets path wildcard values on a request.
  * net/http/cgi: When executing a CGI process, the PATH_INFO
    variable is now always set to the empty string or a value
    starting with a / character, as required by RFC 3875. It was
    previously possible for some combinations of Handler.Root and
    request URL to violate this requirement.
  * net/netip: The new AddrPort.Compare method compares two
    AddrPorts.
  * os: On Windows, the Stat function now follows all reparse
    points that link to another named entity in the system. It was
    previously only following IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK and
    IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT reparse points.
  * os: On Windows, passing O_SYNC to OpenFile now causes write
    operations to go directly to disk, equivalent to O_SYNC on Unix
    platforms.
  * os: On Windows, the ReadDir, File.ReadDir, File.Readdir, and
    File.Readdirnames functions now read directory entries in
    batches to reduce the number of system calls, improving
    performance up to 30%.
  * os: When io.Copy copies from a File to a net.UnixConn, it will
    now use Linux's sendfile(2) system call if possible, using the
    new method File.WriteTo.
  * os/exec: On Windows, LookPath now ignores empty entries
    in %PATH%, and returns ErrNotFound (instead of ErrNotExist)
    if no executable file extension is found to resolve an
    otherwise-unambiguous name.
  * os/exec: On Windows, Command and Cmd.Start no longer call
    LookPath if the path to the executable is already absolute and
    has an executable file extension. In addition, Cmd.Start no
    longer writes the resolved extension back to the Path field, so
    it is now safe to call the String method concurrently with a
    call to Start.
  * reflect: The Value.IsZero method will now return true for a
    floating-point or complex negative zero, and will return true
    for a struct value if a blank field (a field named _) somehow
    has a non-zero value. These changes make IsZero consistent with
    comparing a value to zero using the language == operator.
  * reflect: The PtrTo function is deprecated, in favor of
    PointerTo.
  * reflect: The new function TypeFor returns the Type that
    represents the type argument T. Previously, to get the
    reflect.Type value for a type, one had to use
    reflect.TypeOf((*T)(nil)).Elem(). This may now be written as
    reflect.TypeFor[T]().
  * runtime/metrics: Four new histogram metrics
    /sched/pauses/stopping/gc:seconds,
    /sched/pauses/stopping/other:seconds,
    /sched/pauses/total/gc:seconds, and
    /sched/pauses/total/other:seconds provide additional details
    about stop-the-world pauses. The "stopping" metrics report the
    time taken from deciding to stop the world until all goroutines
    are stopped. The "total" metrics report the time taken from
    deciding to stop the world until it is started again.
  * runtime/metrics: The /gc/pauses:seconds metric is deprecated,
    as it is equivalent to the new /sched/pauses/total/gc:seconds
    metric.
  * runtime/metrics: /sync/mutex/wait/total:seconds now includes
    contention on runtime-internal locks in addition to sync.Mutex
    and sync.RWMutex.
  * runtime/pprof: Mutex profiles now scale contention by the
    number of goroutines blocked on the mutex. This provides a more
    accurate representation of the degree to which a mutex is a
    bottleneck in a Go program. For instance, if 100 goroutines are
    blocked on a mutex for 10 milliseconds, a mutex profile will
    now record 1 second of delay instead of 10 milliseconds of
    delay.
  * runtime/pprof: Mutex profiles also now include contention on
    runtime-internal locks in addition to sync.Mutex and
    sync.RWMutex. Contention on runtime-internal locks is always
    reported at runtime._LostContendedRuntimeLock. A future release
    will add complete stack traces in these cases.
  * runtime/pprof: CPU profiles on Darwin platforms now contain the
    process's memory map, enabling the disassembly view in the
    pprof tool.
  * runtime/trace: The execution tracer has been completely
    overhauled in this release, resolving several long-standing
    issues and paving the way for new use-cases for execution
    traces.
  * runtime/trace: Execution traces now use the operating system's
    clock on most platforms (Windows excluded) so it is possible to
    correlate them with traces produced by lower-level
    components. Execution traces no longer depend on the
    reliability of the platform's clock to produce a correct
    trace. Execution traces are now partitioned regularly
    on-the-fly and as a result may be processed in a streamable
    way. Execution traces now contain complete durations for all
    system calls. Execution traces now contain information about
    the operating system threads that goroutines executed on. The
    latency impact of starting and stopping execution traces has
    been dramatically reduced. Execution traces may now begin or
    end during the garbage collection mark phase.
  * runtime/trace: To allow Go developers to take advantage of
    these improvements, an experimental trace reading package is
    available at golang.org/x/exp/trace. Note that this package
    only works on traces produced by programs built with go1.22 at
    the moment. Please try out the package and provide feedback on
    the corresponding proposal issue.
  * runtime/trace: If you experience any issues with the new
    execution tracer implementation, you may switch back to the old
    implementation by building your Go program with
    GOEXPERIMENT=noexectracer2. If you do, please file an issue,
    otherwise this option will be removed in a future release.
  * slices: The new function Concat concatenates multiple slices.
  * slices: Functions that shrink the size of a slice (Delete,
    DeleteFunc, Compact, CompactFunc, and Replace) now zero the
    elements between the new length and the old length.
  * slices: Insert now always panics if the argument i is out of
    range. Previously it did not panic in this situation if there
    were no elements to be inserted.
  * syscall: The syscall package has been frozen since Go 1.4 and
    was marked as deprecated in Go 1.11, causing many editors to
    warn about any use of the package. However, some non-deprecated
    functionality requires use of the syscall package, such as the
    os/exec.Cmd.SysProcAttr field. To avoid unnecessary complaints
    on such code, the syscall package is no longer marked as
    deprecated. The package remains frozen to most new
    functionality, and new code remains encouraged to use
    golang.org/x/sys/unix or golang.org/x/sys/windows where
    possible.
  * syscall: On Linux, the new SysProcAttr.PidFD field allows
    obtaining a PID FD when starting a child process via
    StartProcess or os/exec.
  * syscall: On Windows, passing O_SYNC to Open now causes write
    operations to go directly to disk, equivalent to O_SYNC on Unix
    platforms.
  * testing/slogtest: The new Run function uses sub-tests to run
    test cases, providing finer-grained control.
  * Ports: Darwin: On macOS on 64-bit x86 architecture (the
    darwin/amd64 port), the Go toolchain now generates
    position-independent executables (PIE) by default. Non-PIE
    binaries can be generated by specifying the -buildmode=exe
    build flag. On 64-bit ARM-based macOS (the darwin/arm64 port),
    the Go toolchain already generates PIE by default. go1.22 is
    the last release that will run on macOS 10.15 Catalina. Go 1.23
    will require macOS 11 Big Sur or later.
  * Ports: Arm: The GOARM environment variable now allows you to
    select whether to use software or hardware floating
    point. Previously, valid GOARM values were 5, 6, or 7. Now
