- Update to version 0.4.2 with updated dependencies in vendor file
  * Please check out v4 migration guide:
    https://github.com/goss-org/goss/blob/master/docs/v4_migration.md
  * Added ctx object to all system struct's constructors by @aelsabbahy in gh#837
  * Changed: Reworded syntax error messages to be clearer by @aelsabbahy in gh#838
  * Fix json by @aelsabbahy in gh#841
  * Command empty strings by @aelsabbahy in gh#839
  * Added: goss-darwin-arm64 binary to release by @aelsabbahy in gh#835
  * Goss v0.4.X introduces some major enhancements to the matching logic allowing far more flexibility for asserts.
  * For example, can assert that the output of echo "3" is less than 5.
  * Added: transforms support (closes gh#538)
    * Allows comparison of string to int, ex: ensuring a systctl output below/above a specific number (closes gh#220)
    * Allows JSON parsing/validation support (closes gh#578)
    * Allows comparing command output to a string, this will display the failed output on failure (closes gh#483)
    * -o include_raw will show the non-transformed value
  * Added: Some new matchers
    * equal matcher added to do strict type comparison (e.x. string to string)
    * contain-substring
    * have-patterns - This mimics the existing default behavior of file contents and command output
    * contain-elements - checks that an array value matches a set of matchers
  * Added: runlevels support for service
  * Added: option to sort output (closes gh#416)
  * Added: All resources now support key override (closes gh#518, closes gh#742)
  * Added: Use exit code 78 if test file is unparseable (closes gh#317)
  * Changed: removed alpha from non-linux binary names
  * Changed: StartTime is no longer calculated from goss start. Calculated from first test start, this allows accurate reporting when showing a cached result
  * Changed: Completely re-worked matchers and shared output logic
  * Changed: Cache test results in serve instead of output (closes gh#612)
  * Added: Significantly improved test coverage of matcher, output code
  * Changed: Doc to reference cat -E /proc/<PID>/comm to avoid whitespace issues (closes gh#762)
  * Changed: Removed file.Size from autoadd (closes gh#262)
  * Added: matcher.as-reader this allows the matcher string to behave as an io.Reader output. Can be useful for testing
  * Removed: json_online output format, use: goss v -f json -o oneline
  * Added: windows and darwin alpha binaries back in the release (gh#829)
  * Added: string diff support (gh#827)
  * Added: mount vfs-opts support (gh#826)
