- Upgrade to guava 32.0.1
  * Security fixes:
    + Reimplemented Files.createTempDir and FileBackedOutputStream
      to further address CVE-2020-8908 (#4011, bsc#1179926) and
      CVE-2023-2976 (#2575, bsc#1212401)
  * Fixes:
    + io: Fixed Files.createTempDir and FileBackedOutputStream under
      Windows, which broke as part of the security fix in release
      32.0.0
    + Removed @Beta from almost all APIs. Most of the remaining
      @Beta APIs are in graph and hash.
    + Enhanced the Guava jar to include Proguard configurations that
      are picked up automatically by the Android Gradle Plugin. This
      should help with warnings that were promoted to errors in
      Android Gradle Plugin 8.x.
    + Enhanced the Guava jar to include information about method
      parameters in its class files. If you use static analyzers
      that look at method-parameter names, you may see new warnings
      or errors if they are now able to detect mismatches. But
      mostly, you may see better tooltips and autocompletion in
      DEs.
    + Improved nullness annotations on a few classes.
    + Modified classes with "serial proxies" to declare
      exception-throwing readObject methods, in accordance with best
      practice.
    + collect: Fixed Maps.newHashMapWithExpectedSize to stop
      allocating maps that were larger than they needed to be.
    + collect: Made various APIs work J2CL:
      Maps.immutableEnumMap+toImmutableEnumMap, EnumMultiset,
      CollectorTester. Previously, the APIs were present but failed
      at runtime.
    + collect: Optimized memory usage for Interner and MapMaker.
    + graph: Changed directed graphs to reject attempts to add
      undirected edges.
    + io: Added BaseEncoding.ignoreCase() to support
      case-insensitive decoding.
    + net: Added HttpHeaders constants:
      ~ No-Vary-Search
      ~ Sec-CH-DPR
      ~ Sec-CH-UA-Wow64
      ~ Sec-CH-Viewport-Width and Sec-CH-Viewport-Height
      ~ Supports-Loading-Mode
    + net: Added the MediaType constant for JWT.
    + primitives: Added rotate() for arrays of all primitive types.
    + util.concurrent: Changed AbstractFuture to run
      interruptTask() just before afterDone(). Until this change, it
      ran slightly earlier than that: We used to run it before
      unblocking any pending get() calls, and now we run it after.
    + util.concurrent: Fixed some cases in which we could catch
      InterruptedException but fail to restore the interrupt bit.

- Upgrade to guava 31.1
  * Fixes:
    + base: Deprecated the Throwables methods lazyStackTrace and
      lazyStackTraceIsLazy. They are no longer useful on any current
      platform.
    + collect: Added a new method
      ImmutableMap.Builder.buildKeepingLast(), which keeps the last
      value for any given key rather than throwing an exception when
      a key appears more than once.
    + collect: As a side-effect of the buildKeepingLast() change,
      the idiom
      ImmutableList.copyOf(Maps.transformValues(map, function))
      may produce different results if function has side-effects.
    + hash: Added Hashing.fingerprint2011().
    + io: Changed ByteStreams.nullOutputStream() to follow the
      contract of OutputStream.write by throwing an exception if
      the range of bytes is out of bounds.
    + net: Added @CheckReturnValue to the package (with a few
      exceptions).
    + net: Added HttpHeaders constant for
      Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network.
    + util.concurrent: Added accumulate/update methods for
      AtomicDouble and AtomicDoubleArray.
  * APIs promoted from @Beta:
    + base: Throwables methods getCausalChain and getCauseAs
    + collect: Streams methods mapWithIndex and findLast
    + collect: the remaining methods in Comparators: min, max,
      lexicographical, emptiesFirst, emptiesLast, isInOrder,
      isInStrictOrder
    + escape: various APIs
    + io: various APIs in Files
    + net: various APIs
    + reflect: various APIs
    + testlib: various APIs
    + util.concurrent: AsyncCallable, ListenableScheduledFuture,
      and ClosingFuture
    + util.concurrent: ExecutionSequencer,
      MoreExecutors.newSequentialExecutor, and Monitor
    + util.concurrent: Futures methods: submit, submitAsync,
      scheduleAsync, nonCancellationPropagating, inCompletionOrder
    + util.concurrent: Uninterruptibles:
      awaitTerminationUninterruptibly and the Duration overloads in
      the class
    + util.concurrent: the FluentFuture type, its factory methods,
      and addCallback
  * Remove the hack of removing annotations, since we have now
    all the required dependencies packaged
- Removed patch:
  * donotmock.patch
    + hack not needed any more

Mon May 10 14:59:41 UTC 2021 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Upgrade to guava 30.1.1
  * Fixes:
    + cache: Fixed compatibility between asMap().compute(...)
      and a load.
    + cache: Added @CheckReturnValue to some APIs.
    + collect: Added @DoNotCall to the mutator methods on immutable
      types
    + hash: Removed @Beta from HashCode.
    + io: Removed @Beta from CountingOutputStream.
  * fixes bsc#1179926, CVE-2020-8908: temp directory creation
    vulnerability in Guava versions prior to 30.0
- Removed patch:
  * guava-25.0-java8compat.patch
    + the compatibility is handled in the upstream code
- Added patch:
  * donotmock.patch
    + patch @DoNotMock annotation occurrences in order to put them
      in a format that our regex is able to identify and kill

Wed Dec  4 17:32:18 UTC 2019 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Avoid version-less dependencies that can cause problems with
  some tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 22 04:52:39 UTC 2019 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Build the package with ant in order to prevent build cycles
  * using a generated and customized ant build system

Thu Oct 10 21:00:22 UTC 2019 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Added patch:
  * guava-25.0-java8compat.patch
    + Avoid callingoverridden methods with covariant return types
      for java.nio.ByteBuffer and java.nio.CharBuffer, which were
      introduced in Java 9
    + This allows us to produce with Java >= 9 binaries that are
      compatible with Java 8
