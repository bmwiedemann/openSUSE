  <title>GNS3 is a graphical network simulator</title>
  <description>GNS3 is a excellent complementary tool to real labs for administrators
of Cisco networks or people wanting to pass their CCNA,
CCNP, CCIP or CCIE certifications.

It can also be used to experiment features of Cisco IOS or to check configurations
that need to be deployed later on real routers.

Important notice: users must provide their own Cisco IOS to use GNS3.</description>
