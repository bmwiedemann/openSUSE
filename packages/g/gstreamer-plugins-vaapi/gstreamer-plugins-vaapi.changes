    don't poll if there are no pending frames. Otherwise the
    following poll may not return for an arbitrary amount of time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 27 11:13:55 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.10.1:
  + Minor bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  2 23:52:15 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.10.0:
  + All the decoders have been split, one plugin feature per codec.
    So far, the available ones, depending on the driver, are:
    vaapimpeg2dec, vaapih264dec, vaapih265dec, vaapivc1dec,
    vaapivp8dec, vaapivp9dec and vaapijpegdec (which already was
    split).
  + Improvements when mapping VA surfaces into memory. It now
    differentiates between negotiation caps and allocations caps,
    since the allocation memory for surfaces may be bigger than one
    that is going to be mapped.
  + Vaapih265enc now supports constant bitrate mode (CBR).
  + Since several VA drivers are unmaintained, we decide to keep a
    whitelist with the va drivers we actually test, which is mostly
    the i915 and to a lesser degree gallium from the mesa project.
  + Exporting the environment variable GST_VAAPI_ALL_DRIVERS disables
    the whitelist.
  + Plugin features are registered at run-time, according to their
    support by the loaded VA driver. So only the decoders and
    encoder supported by the system are registered. Since the
    driver can change, some dependencies are tracked to invalidate
    the GStreamer registry and reload the plugin.
  + Dmabuf importation from upstream has been improved, gaining
    performance.
  + Vaapipostproc now can negotiate buffer transformations via
    caps.
  + Decoders now can do I-frame only reverse playback. This decodes
    I-frames only because the surface pool is smaller than the
    required by the GOP to show all the frames.
  + The upload of frames onto native GL textures has been optimized
    too, keeping a cache of the internal structures for the offered
    textures by the sink.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#754680, bgo#772554, bgo#772599, bgo#773497,
    bgo#773589.

  pkgconfig(wayland-scanner), pkgconfig(wayland-server) following
  what configure really looks for.
- Add gstreamer-plugins-vaapi-va_wayland.patch: Correctly locate
  libva-wayland headers (bgo#773946).
- All call to autoreconf, as above patch touches the build system.

    also moved to gst-plugins-base (from -bad), and the opus RTP
    depayloader/payloader to -good.
  + GStreamer VAAPI module now released and maintained as part of
    the GStreamer project.
  + Asset proxy support in the GStreamer Editing Services.
- Update Url and Source to new home at freedesktop.org.
- Pass --enable-egl, --enable-encoders, --enable-drm,

      files.
    - Expose the overlay capability in vaapisink for compatibility
      with dvbsuboverlay.
    - Expose deinterlace property to vaapidecodebin.
    - Enable VPP element in vaapidecodebin only if there is HW
      support.

    - Fix ABBA deadlock between vaapisink and vaapipostproc if
      running in different threads.
    - Fix Seeking failure while using navseek in pipeline.
    - Fix PTS cache for MPEG2 GOP start.
    - Fix the wrong selection of passthrough mode in vaapipostproc.
    - Fix GstVaapiVideoPool related dead-lock.
    - Fix the race condition while setting drm device type.
    - Fix crash in vaapidecode if buffer outlives the decoder.
    - Fix memory leak in vaapidecode.
    - Fix multiple caps negotiation issues with vaapi elements.
    - Improve check for upstream element that requires DMABUF
      buffer pool.
    - Fix vaapisink memory leak in debug mode.
    - Fix crash when seeking mpeg2 strems.
    - Fix support for Wayland/EGL running alongside X11 (around 70+
      bug reports fixed).
  + GStreamer support corner:
    - Removed the support for GStreamer 0.10 and 1.0
    - GStreamer >= 1.2 is the minimal requirement
    - GStreamer 1.2.x is deprecated, and will be obsoleted in a
      future release
- Add a define soname and set it to 2, following upstream changes.
  Rename all sub-packages to get the new soname.
