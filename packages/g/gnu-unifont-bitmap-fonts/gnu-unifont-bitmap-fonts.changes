- Update to version 9.0.01
  * This is the first release for Unicode 9.0.0, which The 
    Unicode Consortium formally released on 21 June 2016. In 
    addition to complete Basic Multilingual Plane coverage, 
    this release includes all scripts that can easily be drawn 
    in a 16-by-16 grid in the Supplemental Multilingual Plane 
    as of Unicode 9.0. This SMP coverage is a major milestone 
    for Unifont.
    + Johnnie Weaver has contributed many Supplemental 
      Multilingual Plane glyphs, allowing completion of all SMP 
      scripts that are easily drawn in a 16-by-16 pixel grid::
       U+0104B0..U+0104FF Osage
       U+011280..U+0112AF Multani
       U+0112B0..U+0112FF Khudawadi
       U+011600..U+01165F Modi
       U+011700..U+01173F Ahom
       U+0118A0..U+0118FF Warang Citi
       U+011AC0..U+011AFF Pau Cin Hau
       U+011C00..U+011C6F Bhaiksuki
       U+011C70..U+011CBF Marchen
       U+016A40..U+016A6F Mro
       U+016AD0..U+016AFF Bassa Vah
       U+01E000..U+01E02F Glagolitic Supplement
       U+01E900..U+01E95F Adlam
    + Terence Eden contributed the new power symbols in the range 
      U+23FB..U+23FE. Terence proposed adding those glyphs to 
      Unicode, and got them adopted in the Unicode 9.0.0 release.
      Paul Hardy drew the rest of the glyphs added to this 
      release. This included a complete redrawing of the Unified 
      Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (U+1400..U+167F) and the 
      Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended 
      (U+18B0..U+18FF) scripts. This also included rotating the 
      Mongolian and Phags Pa scripts, as per changes of The 
      Unicode Consortium in changing their default representation 
      from vertical writing to horizontal writing. Paul added 
      these scripts:
       U+1C80..U+1C8F Cyrillic Extended-C
       U+011300..U+01137F Grantha
       U+011400..U+01147F Newa
       U+011480..U+0114DF Tirhuta
       U+011660..U+01167F Mongolian Supplement
       U+016FE0..U+016FFF Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation
       U+01BC00..U+01BC9F Duployan
       U+01E800..U+01E8DF Mende Kikakui
       U+01F900..U+01F9FF Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs
    + Michael Walden drew my attention (pun intended) to a 
      multitude of glyph issues, which I have addressed in this 
      release. A comprehensive list of glyphs altered from his 
      suggestions appear in the ChangeLog file in the main 
      tarball.
