- Update to 1.6.3:
  * Fixed a spelling error in utils/premutliply.frag that broke
    native transparency in most modules
- Changes from 1.6.2:
  * Fixed a critical issue with --stdin that caused the alpha
    channel to be garbage data
  * Added a premultiply step to bars to allow for proper handling
    of the alpha channel on "native" transparency. This is disabled
	by default, assign USE_ALPHA to 1 in bars.glsl to enable.
- Changes from 1.6.1:
  * A problem with artifacting in circle has been fixed, see #107
  * --stdin has been added, which binds simple GLSL datatypes to
    STDIN in shaders. This evaluates to a uniform, and thus can be
	used to stream some data at runtime to GLava.
