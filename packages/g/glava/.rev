    <comment>- Update to 1.6.0:
  * FIFO support has been added. See README.md for details, also see #78
  * Added sampling modes for the GLSL smoothing pass to allow for more accurate output
  * Added support for disabling shader passes through GLSL, see #97
  * Enhanced rendering and options for graph, courtesy of @arch1t3cht30[3], see #97
  * Fixed clickthrough on Openbox (and potentially other window managers), see #80
  * Fixed the two lowest-frequency bars having the same value while running the bars module
  * Fixed some build issues on Ubuntu, musl, see #94, #91
  * Fixed a bug with circle that only manifested on some integrated graphics chips, see #70</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.6.3:
  * Fixed a spelling error in utils/premutliply.frag that broke
    native transparency in most modules
- Changes from 1.6.2:
  * Fixed a critical issue with --stdin that caused the alpha
    channel to be garbage data
  * Added a premultiply step to bars to allow for proper handling
    of the alpha channel on &quot;native&quot; transparency. This is disabled
	by default, assign USE_ALPHA to 1 in bars.glsl to enable.
- Changes from 1.6.1:
  * A problem with artifacting in circle has been fixed, see #107
  * --stdin has been added, which binds simple GLSL datatypes to
    STDIN in shaders. This evaluates to a uniform, and thus can be
	used to stream some data at runtime to GLava.</comment>
