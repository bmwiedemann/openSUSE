- added CHANGES
- added galene-html-sendselect-default.patch
- Update to version 0.3:
  * Implemented the command /muteall.  This allows muting all users except
    yourself.
  * Implemented the autolock and autokick user group options, that cause,
    a group to be locked or all users to be kicked out when the last
    administrator leaves.
  * Implemented client-side filters that are run over the video before it
    is sent to the server.  A pair of mirroring filters are provided,
    which are useful when using a mirror in front of a webcam.
  * Included a built-in TURN server, which drastically simplifies
    deployment in common cases.
  * Implemented testing of TURN servers, on both the client and the server
    side.  Connectivity will be checked by the server every 12 hours, and
    by the client whenever a user uses the /relay-test command.
  * Group configurations are now checked at startup, and any failures are
    logged.  This implies that it is no longer possible to use undefined
    keys in group definition files (this is a breaking change).
  * Reworked the client API, which is now simpler and more uniform.
  * Subgroups can now be public.
  * Added an option to disable the mirror view, which is useful when writing.
  * Ported file playback to Firefox.
  * We now display a friendly error message when the user has disabled
    WebRTC under Firefox.
  * Implemented renegotiation of down streams, which reduces the amount of
    flicker in the user interface.
  * Fixed a number of race conditions that could cause audio tracks to
    become muted or video tracks to freeze.
