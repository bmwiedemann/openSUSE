- adapted AppArmor profile to new config files in 0.4.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 05 14:43:31 UTC 2021 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 0.4.1:
  * Create a new file data/config.json with global configuration.
  * Remove data/passwd and the -redirect option with entries in config.json;
    these are incompatible changes.
  * Change the group URL from /group/name to /group/name/, which allows
    using relative links.  The old URL is redirected to the new one.
  * Extend the protocol with the ability to consult the group status before
    joining; this allows using the group's displayName before the user has
    logged in, and will be required for new authorisation schemes.
  * Allow scrolling of the login dialog, useful on small devices.
  * Fixed a typo that prevented the group name from being displayed.
  * Made failed videos more visible.
  * No longer attempt to save passwords in browser JavaScript, it's
    insecure and not very useful.

- avoid switching off IPv6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 05 17:56:58 UTC 2021 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 0.4:
  * Implemented simulcast.
  * Implemented scalable video coding (SVC) for VP8 and VP9.
  * Preliminary support for the AV1 codec.
  * Fixed the profile announced for VP9.
  * Reworked the disk writer, which should no longer cause corruption
    after packet loss.
  * Added support for recording H.264 tracks.
  * Reworked the signalling protocol, it is now possible to request
    different tracks for distinct streams, and there are provisions to
    carry user permissions and statuses; this is not yet used by the user
    interface.
  * Reworked internal signalling; this will hopefully fix issues with
    losing tracks under load.
  * Added an option to limit the range of UDP ports used by the server.
  * Added a close button in every locally-generated video; this allows
    closing individual screen shares and simplifies the UI by not creating
    close buttons in the top bar.
  * The server will now attempt to increase the file descriptor limit at
    startup.
  * Stats are now exported as JSON and formatted on the client side; the
    stats URL is now /stats.html rather than just /stats.

Wed May 12 15:18:17 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to version 0.3.5:
  * Fixed another bug in the loss estimator.
  * Fixed the list of SSRCs sent in REMB packets.  This doesn't seem to
    have any measurable effect.
  * Removed some obsolete code that caused clients to be kicked out when
    they lost the Present permission.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 27 17:22:43 UTC 2021 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 0.3.4:
  * Fixed a bug in the loss estimator.  We will now reduce the rate more
    aggressively when there is loss in the client->serer direction.
  * Fixed display of the chat on some devices.
  * Exported the group.Description data structure for the sake of external
    configuration tools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 16 20:42:16 UTC 2021 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 0.3.3:
  * Fixed an off-by-one error that could occasionally lead to a server
    crash.
  * Attempt to negotiate stereo Opus audio.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  3 17:27:01 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- build without PIE on PPC64 platform

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 02 23:40:09 UTC 2021 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 0.3.2:
  * Fixed compatibility with versions of Go earlier than 1.15.
  * Fixed a race condition in the disk writer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 26 20:06:42 UTC 2021 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 0.3.1:
  * We now notice when the TLS certificate has changed on disk; which can
    therefore be rotated without a restart.
  * We now generate a self-signed certificate if none is found on disk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 23 19:43:48 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- installation of AppArmor profile truly optional
- dropped version check for AppArmor dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 22:29:53 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- added CHANGES
- added galene-html-sendselect-default.patch
- Update to version 0.3:
  * Implemented the command /muteall.  This allows muting all users except
    yourself.
  * Implemented the autolock and autokick user group options, that cause,
    a group to be locked or all users to be kicked out when the last
    administrator leaves.
  * Implemented client-side filters that are run over the video before it
    is sent to the server.  A pair of mirroring filters are provided,
    which are useful when using a mirror in front of a webcam.
  * Included a built-in TURN server, which drastically simplifies
    deployment in common cases.
  * Implemented testing of TURN servers, on both the client and the server
    side.  Connectivity will be checked by the server every 12 hours, and
    by the client whenever a user uses the /relay-test command.
  * Group configurations are now checked at startup, and any failures are
    logged.  This implies that it is no longer possible to use undefined
    keys in group definition files (this is a breaking change).
  * Reworked the client API, which is now simpler and more uniform.
  * Subgroups can now be public.
  * Added an option to disable the mirror view, which is useful when writing.
  * Ported file playback to Firefox.
  * We now display a friendly error message when the user has disabled
    WebRTC under Firefox.
  * Implemented renegotiation of down streams, which reduces the amount of
    flicker in the user interface.
  * Fixed a number of race conditions that could cause audio tracks to
    become muted or video tracks to freeze.
