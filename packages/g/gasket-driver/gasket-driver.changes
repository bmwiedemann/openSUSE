- Add `fix-for-backported-dma-buf-ns.patch`.

  The dma-buf symbols used by this driver were moved into their own
 `DMA_BUF` module namespace in kernel 5.16. Consequently, the
  upstream source conditionally imports the `DMA_BUF` module
  namespace if the kernel version is >= 5.16. 
  
  However, the `DMA_BUF` module namespace changes have been
  backported to the 5.14 kernel used in Leap 15.5, causing
  unpatched source builds to fail.
  
  This change incorporates a patch that removes the conditional
  check in the upstream source, importing the `DMA_BUF` module
  namespace regardless of kernel version, and applies that patch
  when `sle_version` is equal to "150500" (ie. is Leap 15.5 or
  greater).
  
  The patch is taken from the PR at:
  https://github.com/google/gasket-driver/pull/10
