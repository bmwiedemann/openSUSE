# The dma-buf symbols used by this driver were moved into their own `DMA_BUF`
# module namespace in kernel 5.16. Consequently, the upstream source conditionally
# imports the `DMA_BUF` module namespace if the kernel version is >= 5.16.
# This patch removes that condition, allowing this module to be built for kernels
# that have backported the `DMA_BUF` namespace changes.
# See:

# The function signature for `class_create()` was changed in kernels >= 6.4.x to only accept a
# single argument (see kernel commit #dcfbb67).
# This patch conditionally modifies how `class_create()` is called depending on the kernel version.

%description
The Coral Gasket Driver allows usage of the Coral EdgeTPU on Linux systems.
The driver contains two modules:
- Gasket (Google ASIC Software, Kernel Extensions, and Tools) is a top level driver
  for lightweight communication with Google ASICs.
- Apex refers to the EdgeTPU v1.
