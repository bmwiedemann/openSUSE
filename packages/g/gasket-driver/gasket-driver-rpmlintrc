# The stated solution to this error is to use `noarch`, but as this
# package is for building kernel modules `noarch` causes a cryptic error
# there's _very_ little information about online:
# ```
# warning: Macro %flavors_to_build needs whitespace before body
# warning: Macro %_suse_kernel_module_subpackage defined but not used within scope
# error: line 43: Unknown tag: %internal_kmp_error
# ```
# My guess is that when `noarch` is specified then `%flavors_to_build` isn't
# populated properly, and issues cascade from there. Something like that anyway...
# In the meantime this is an acceptable alternative.

# This error is introduced by the KMP sub-package build.
