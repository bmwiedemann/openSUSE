%description
The LPRES package defines new GAP objects to work with L-presented
groups, namely groups given by a finite generating set and a
possibly-infinite set of relations given as iterates of finitely many
seed relations by a finite set of endomorphisms. The package
implements nilpotent quotient, Todd-Coxeter and Reidemeister-Schreier
algorithms for L-presented groups.
