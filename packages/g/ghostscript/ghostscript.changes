Tue Mar 26 08:21:08 UTC 2024 - Johannes Meixner <jsmeix@suse.com>

- Version upgrade to 10.03.0:
  For openSUSE and SUSE Ghostscript is built '--without-tesseract'
  (see the entry below dated 'Mon Jul 18 07:28:54 UTC 2022').
  Highlights in this release include:
  See 'Recent Changes in Ghostscript' at Ghostscript upstream
  https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/en/gs10.03.0/News.html
  * As of this release (10.03.0) pdfwrite creates PDF files
    with XRef streams and ObjStm streams. This can result in
    considerably smaller PDF output files. See Vector Devices
    https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/VectorDevices.html
    for more details.
  * Ghostscript/pdfwrite now supports passing through
    PDF "Optional Content".
  * Our efforts in code hygiene and maintainability continue.
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  Incompatible changes (the release is listed in parentheses):
  * (10.03.0) Almost all the "internal" PostScript procedures
    defined during the interpreter startup are now "executeonly",
    further reducing the attack surface of the interpreter.
    The nature of these procedures means there should be no impact
    for legitimate usage, but it is possible it will impact uses
    which abuse the previous accessibility (even for legitimate
    reasons). Such cases may now require "DELAYBIND", See DELAYBIND
    https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Use.html#ddelaybind
  * (10.03.0) The "makeimagedevice" non-standard operator has been
    removed. It allowed low level access to the graphics library
    in a way that was, essentially impossible to secure.
  * (10.03.0) The "putdeviceprops", "getdeviceprops",
    "finddevice", "copydevice", "findprotodevice" non-standard
    operators have all been removed. They provided functionality
    that is either accessible through standard operators,
    or should not be used by user PostScript.
  * (10.03.0) The process of "tidying" the PostScript namespace
    should have removed only non-standard and undocumented
    operators. Nevertheless, it is possible that any integrations
    or utilities that rely on those non-standard and undocumented
    operators may stop working or may change behaviour.
  If you encounter such a case, please contact us
  (Discord https://discord.gg/H9GXKwyPvY
   #ghostscript IRC channel https://web.libera.chat/#ghostscript
   or the gs-devel mailing list
   https://www.ghostscript.com/mailman/index.html would be best),
  but remember that free versions of Ghostscript
  come with with NO WARRANTY and NO SUPPORT.

- update to 10.02.1:
  * Patch release to address some security bugs
  * This release (10.02.0) marks the final demise of the
    PostScript based PDF interpreter.
  * This 10.01.1 release removes the "-dNEWPDF=false" command
    line option to fall back to the deprecated, old PDF
    interpreter.
  * This 10.01.0 release removes the "-dNEWPDF=false" command
    line option to fall back to the deprecated, old PDF
    interpreter.
  * This release officially deprecates the old Postscript
    implementation of PDF, we will not be updating or maintaining
    that code moving forward. The option to use the old PDF
    implementation _**will**_ be removed in the next full release
    (10.01.0)
  * Important: This release includes the new PDF interpreter
    (implemented in C rather than PostScript). It is both
    integrated into Ghostscript (now ENABLED by default), and
    available as a standalone, PDF only, binary. See
    https://ghostscript.com/pdfi.html for more details.
  * This also bundles the latest zlib (1.2.12) which addresses a
    security issue (CVE-2018-25032)
  * **Important**: This release includes the new PDF interpreter
    (implemented in C rather than PostScript). It is both
    integrated into Ghostscript (now **ENABLED** by default), and
    available as a standalone, PDF only, binary. See

- update to 9.56.1:
  Highlights in this release include
  (excerpts from the Ghostscript upstream release summary
   in https://ghostscript.com/docs/9.56.1/News.htm):
  * New PDF Interpreter: This is an entirely new implementation
    written in C (rather than PostScript, as before)
  * Calling Ghostscript via the GS API is now thread safe. The one
    limitation is that the X11 devices for Unix-like systems (x11,
    x11alpha, x11cmyk, x11cmyk2, x11cmyk4, x11cmyk8, x11gray2,
    x11gray4 and x11mono) cannot be made thread safe, due to their
    interaction with the X11 server, those devices have been
    modified to only allow one instance in an executable.
  * The PSD output device now writes ICC profiles to their output
    files, for improved color fidelity.
  * Our efforts in code hygiene and maintainability continue.
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes, and
    incremental improvements.
  * We have added the capability to build with the Tesseract OCR
    engine. In such a build, new devices are available
    (pdfocr8/pdfocr24/pdfocr32) which render the output file to an
    image, OCR that image, and output the image "wrapped" up as a
    PDF file, with the OCR generated text information included
    as "invisible" text (in PDF terms, text rendering mode 3).
    Mainly due to time constraints, we only support including
    Tesseract from source included in our release packages,
    and not linking to Tesseract/Leptonica shared libraries.
    Whether we add this capability will be largely dependent
    on community demand for the feature. See Enabling OCR
    at https://www.ghostscript.com/ocr.html for more details.
  For a release summary see:
  https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.54.0/News.htm
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
- Configure --without-tesseract because this requires C++ (it

- Version upgrade to 9.54.0
  Highlights in this release include
  (excerpts from the Ghostscript upstream release summary
   in https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.54.0/News.htm):
  * The 9.54.0 release is a maintenance release,
    and also adds new functionality.
  * Overprint simulation is now available to all output devices,
    allowing quality previewing/proofing of PostScript and
    PDF jobs that rely on overprint. See the -dOverprint option
    documentation in: doc/9.54.0/Use.htm#Overprint
  * The "docxwrite" device adds the ability to output
    to Microsoft Word "docx" format.
    See: doc/9.54.0/VectorDevices.htm#DOCX
  * The pdfwrite device is now capable of using the Tesseract OCR
    engine when it is built into Ghostscript to improve
    searchability and copy and paste functionality when the input
    lacks the metadata for that purpose.
    See: doc/9.54.0/VectorDevices.htm#UseOCR
  * Ghostscript/GhostPDL now includes a "map text to black"
    function, where text drawn by an input job (except when drawn
    using a Type 3 font) can be forced to draw in solid black.
    See: doc/9.54.0/Use.htm#BlackText
  * Ghostscript/GhostPDL now supports simple N-up imposition
    "internally". See: doc/9.54.0/Use.htm#NupControl
  * Our efforts in code hygiene and maintainability continue.

- Version upgrade to 9.53.3
  Highlights in this release include
  (excerpts from the Ghostscript upstream release summary
   in https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.53.3/News.htm):
  * The 9.53.3 release is primarily maintenance.
  * Issues arose with 9.53.0/1/2 that prompted the release
    of a .3 patch:
    A crash related to management of ICC profile objects.
    A parameter type mismatch that would cause Ghostscript
    to error out during initialisation, which
    affected 64 big, big endian architectures.
    An unexpected side effect of another change that prevented
    multithreaded rendering and background rendering
    from working correctly.
  * The most obvious change is the (re-)introduction of the
    patch level to the version number, this helps facilitate
    a revised policy on handling security related issues.
    To clarify: in the event we decide to release a patch revision,
    it will replace the release with the previous patch number.
    Release notes, highlights and warnings will remain the same,
    except for the addition of whatever fix(es) prompted the patch.
  * Our efforts in code hygiene and maintainability continue.
  * We have added Python bindings for the gsapi interface, can be
    found in demos/python. These are experimental, and we welcome
    feedback from interested developers.
  * For those integrating Ghostscript/GhostPDL via the gsapi
    interface, we have added new capabilities to that, specifically
    in terms of setting and interrogating device parameters. These,
    along with the existing interface calls, are documented in:
    Ghostscript Interpreter API at
    https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.53.3/API.htm
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  * For a list of open issues, or to report problems, please visit
    bugs.ghostscript.com
  Incompatible changes:
  * As of 9.53.0, we have (re-)introduced the patch level to the
    version number, this helps facilitate a revised policy
    on handling security related issues.
    Note for GSView Users: The patch level addition breaks
    GSView 5 (it is hardcoded to check for versions 704-999).
    It is possible, but not guaranteed that a GSView update might
    be forthcoming to resolve this.
  For a release summary see:
  https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.53.3/News.htm
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
- CVE-2020-15900.patch is no longer needed

- The version upgrade to 9.52 fixes in particular
  CVE-2020-12268: jbic2dec: heap-based buffer overflow
  in jbig2_image_compose (bsc#1170603)
- Version upgrade to 9.52
  Highlights in this release include:
  * The 9.52 release replaces the 9.51 release after a problem
    was reported with 9.51 which warranted the quick turnaround.
    Thus, like 9.51, 9.52 is primarily a maintenance release,
    consolidating the changes we introduced in 9.50.
  * IMPORTANT: We have forked LittleCMS2 into LittleCMS2mt
    (the "mt" indicating "multi-thread").
    LCMS2 is not thread-safe, and cannot be made thread-safe
    without breaking the ABI. Our fork will be thread-safe and
    include performance enhancements (these changes have all
    been offered and rejected upstream). We will maintain
    compatibility between Ghostscript and LCMS2 for a time,
    but not in perpetuity. If there is sufficient interest,
    our fork will be available as its own package separately
    from Ghostscript (and MuPDF).
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  Incompatible changes:
  * New option -dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY: The transparency compositor
    (and related features), whilst we are improving it, remains
    sensitive to being driven correctly, and incorrect use
    can have unexpected/undefined results. Hence, as part of
    improving security, we limited access to these operators,
    originally using the -dSAFER feature. As we made "SAFER"
    the default mode, that became unacceptable, hence the
    new option -dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY which enables access
    to the operators, cf.
    https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.52/Use.htm#ALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY
  For a release summary see:
  https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.52/News.htm
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
- Version upgrade to 9.51
  Highlights in this release include:
  * 9.51 is primarily a maintainance release, consolidating
    the changes we introduced in 9.50.
  * We have continued our work on code hygiene for this release,
    with a focus on the static analysis tool Coverity
    (from Synopsys, Inc) and we are now maintaining a policy of
    zero Coverity issues in the Ghostscript/GhostPDL source base.
  * IMPORTANT: In consultation with a representative of
    OpenPrinting (http://www.openprinting.org/) it is our
    intention to deprecate and, in the not distant future,
    remove the OpenPrinting Vector/Raster Printer Drivers
    (that is, the opvp and oprp devices).
    If you rely on either of these devices, please get in touch
    with us (i.e. Ghostscript upstream), so we can discuss your
    use case, and revise our plans accordingly.
  * We (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) are in the process of forking
    LittleCMS, cf. the other release notes entries below.
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  For a release summary see:
  https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.51/News.htm
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
- Version upgrade to 9.50
  Highlights in this release include:
  * The change to version 9.50 follows recognition
    of the extent and importance of the file access control
    redesign/reimplementation outlined below.
  * The file access control capability (enable with -dSAFER)
    has been completely rewritten, with a ground-up rethink
    of the design. For more details, see: "SAFER" at
    https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.50/Use.htm#Safer
  * It is important to note that -dSAFER now only enables the
    file access controls, and no longer applies restrictions
    to standard Postscript functionality (specifically,
    restrictions on setpagedevice). If your application relies
    on these Postscript restrictions, see "OLDSAFER" at
    https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.50/Use.htm#OldSafer
    and please get in touch, as we do plan to remove those
    Postscript restrictions unless we have reason not to.
  IMPORTANT: File access controls are now enabled by default.
    In order to run Ghostscript without these controls,
    see "NOSAFER" at
    https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.50/Use.htm#NoSafer
  * We (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) are in the process of forking
    LittleCMS, cf. the other release notes entries below.
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  Incompatible changes:
  * There are a couple of subtle incompatibilities between the old
    and new SAFER implementations. Firstly, as mentioned above,
    SAFER now leaves standard Postcript functionality unchanged
    (except for the file access limitations). Secondly, the
    interaction with save/restore operations, see "SAFER" at
    https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.50/Use.htm#Safer
  * The following is not strictly speaking new to 9.50,
    as not much has changed since 9.27 in this area,
    but for those who don't upgrade with every release:
    The process of "tidying" the Postscript name space should have
    removed only non-standard and undocumented operators.
    Nevertheless, it is possible that any integrations or utilities
    that rely on those non-standard and undocumented operators
    may stop working, or may change behaviour.
    If you encounter such a case, please contact us
    (i.e. Ghostscript upstream, either the #ghostscript IRC channel
     or the gs-devel mailing list would be best), and we'll work
    with you to either find an alternative solution or return the
    previous functionality, if there is genuinely no other option.
    One case we know this has occurred is GSView 5 (and earlier).
    GSView 5 support for PDF files relied upon internal use only
    features which are no longer available. GSView 5 will still
    work as previously for Postscript files. For PDF files,
    users are encouraged to look at MuPDF https://www.mupdf.com/

Thu Apr  4 14:37:09 CEST 2019 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.27
  Highlights in this release include:
  * We (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) have extensively cleaned up
    the Postscript name space: removing access to internal and/or
    undocumented Postscript operators, procedures and data.
    This has benefits for security and maintainability.
    Incompatible changes:
    The process of "tidying" the Postscript name space should
    have removed only non-standard and undocumented operators.
    Nevertheless, it is possible that any integrations or
    utilities that rely on those non-standard and undocumented
    operators may stop working, or may change behaviour.
    If you encounter such a case, please contact us (i.e.
    Ghostscript upstream) - (either the #ghostscript IRC channel,
    or the gs-devel mailing list would be best), and we'll work
    with you to either find an alternative solution.
  * Fontmap can now reference invidual fonts in a TrueType
    Collection for font subsitution. Previously, a Fontmap entry
    could only reference a TrueType collection and use the default
    (first) font.
    Now, the Fontmap syntax allows for specifying a specific index
    in a TTC. See the comments at the top of (the default)
    Fontmap.GS for details.
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  IMPORTANT: It is our intention, within the next 12 months
    (ideally sooner, in time for the next release) to make SAFER
    the default mode of operation. For many users this will have
    no effect, since they use SAFER explicitly, but some niche
    uses which rely on SAFER being disabled may need to start
    explicitly adding the "-dNOSAFER" option.
  IMPORTANT: We (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) are in the process of
    forking LittleCMS. LCMS2 is not thread safe, and cannot be made
    thread safe without breaking the ABI. Our fork will be thread
    safe, and include performance enhancements (these changes have
    all be been offered and rejected upstream). We will maintain
    compatibility between Ghostscript and LCMS2 for a time, but not
    in perpetuity. Our fork will be available as its own package
    separately from Ghostscript (and MuPDF).
  For a release summary see:
  http://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.27/News.htm
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
  The Ghostscript 9.27 release should fix (cf. the entry below

    https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1108027 bnc#1108027
  Regarding what the above "should fix" means:
  PostScript is a general purpose Turing-complete programming
  language (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript)
  that supports in particular file access on the system disk.
  When Ghostscript processes PostScript it runs a PostScript
  program as the user who runs Ghostscript.
  When Ghostscript processes an arbitrary PostScript file,
  the user who runs Ghostscript runs an arbitrary program
  which can do anything on the system where Ghostscript runs
  that this user is allowed to do on that system.
  To make it safer when Ghostscript runs a PostScript program
  the Ghostscript command line option '-dSAFER' disables
  certain file access functionality, for details see
  /usr/share/doc/ghostscript/9.25/Use.htm
  Its name 'SAFER' says everything: It makes it 'safer'
  to let Ghostscript run a PostScript program,
  but it does not make it completely safe.
  In theory software is safe against misuse (i.e. has no bugs).
  In practice there is an endless sequence of various kind of
  security issues (i.e. software can be misused to do more than
  what is intended) that get fixed issue by issue ad infinitum.
  In the end all that means:
  In practice the user who runs Ghostscript must not let it
  process arbitrary PostScript files from untrusted origin.
  In particular Ghostscript is usually run when printing
  documents (with the '-dSAFER' option set), see the part about
  "It is crucial to limit access to CUPS to trusted users" in
  https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_and_SANE_Firewall_settings

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 13 14:14:39 CEST 2018 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.25rc1 (first release candidate for 9.25).
  Highlights in this release include:
  * This release fixes problems with argument handling, some
    unintended results of the security fixes to the SAFER file
    access restrictions (specifically accessing ICC profile files),
    and some additional security issues over the 9.24 release.
  * Security issues have been the primary focus of this release,
    including solving several (well publicised) real
    and potential exploits.
    PLEASE NOTE:
    We (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) strongly urge users to upgrade
    to this latest release to avoid these issues.
  * Avoid that ps2epsi fails with
    'Error: /undefined in --setpagedevice--'
    Recent changes required to harden SAFER mode mean that
    it is no longer possible to run ps2epsi in SAFER mode,
    because it relies upon unsafe Ghostscript non-standard
    extension operators.
    Removing SAFER and DELAYSAFER, and the code to reset SAFER,
    allow ps2epsi to run as well as it ever did (ie badly).
    This program (i.e. ps2epsi) should now be considered unsafe,
    you should not use it on untrusted PostScript programs.
    Likely we (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) will deprecate and
    remove this program in future.
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.

  from the openSUSE build service development project "Printing"

  Highlights in this release include:

    including solving several (well publicised)
    real and potential exploits.
    PLEASE NOTE:
    We (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) strongly urge users to upgrade
    to this latest release to avoid these issues.
  * As well as Ghostscript itself, jbig2dec has had a significant
    amount of work improving its robustness in the face of
    out specification files.
  * IMPORTANT: We (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) are in the process
    of forking LittleCMS. LCMS2 is not thread safe, and cannot
    be made thread safe without breaking the ABI. Our fork
    will be thread safe, and include performance enhancements
    (these changes have all be been offered and rejected upstream).
    We will maintain compatibility between Ghostscript and LCMS2
    for a time, but not in perpetuity. Our fork will be available
    as its own package separately from Ghostscript (and MuPDF).
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 22 12:51:39 CET 2018 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.23
  Highlights in this release include:
  * Ghostscript now has a family of 'pdfimage' devices
    (pdfimage8, pdfimage24 and pdfimage32) which produce
    rendered output wrapped up as an image in a PDF.
    Additionally, there is a 'pclm' device which
    produces PCLm format output.
  * There is now a ColorAccuracy parameter allowing the user
    to decide between speed or accuracy in ICC color transforms.
  * JPEG Passthrough: devices which support it can now receive
    the 'raw' JPEG stream from the interpreter.
    The main use of this is the pdfwrite/ps2write family of devices
    that can now take JPEG streams from the input file(s) and write
    them unchanged to the output (thus avoiding additional
    quantization effects).
  * PDF transparency performance improvements
  * IMPORTANT: We (i.e. Ghostscript upstream) are in the process
    of forking LittleCMS.
    LCMS2 is not thread safe, and cannot be made thread safe
    without breaking the ABI. Our fork will be thread safe,
    and include performance enhancements (these changes have all
    be been offered and rejected upstream). We will maintain
    compatibility between Ghostscript and LCMS2 for a time,
    but not in perpetuity. Our fork will be available as its own
    package separately from Ghostscript (and MuPDF).
  * We have continued the focus on code hygiene in this release
    cleaning up security issues, ignored return values,
    and compiler warnings.
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  Incompatible changes
  * The planned device API tidy has, unfortunately, been
    indefinitely postponed, until appropriate resources
    are available.

- For now use lcms2 from SUSE because that is what currently
  Ghostscript upstream recommends according to
  https://ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-devel/2018-March/010061.html
  because since Ghostscript 9.23rc1 there is no longer lcms2
  in Ghostscript but now it is lcms2art which is the beginning
  of a lcms2 fork, see News.htm that reads in particular
  "LCMS2 is not thread safe ... Our fork will be thread safe ...

   for a time, but not in perpetuity", see also

- On SLE11 and on SLE12-SP1 there is liblcms2-2-2.5
  which is too old so that configure fails there with
    configure: error: lcms2 not found, or too old
  but there is no configure option to build it without lcms2
  so that for SLE11 and SLE12-SP1 it is built with
  the lcms2art in Ghostscript.
- ppc64le-support.patch is no longer needed because it only
  contained a fix for lcms2art/include/lcms2art.h in Ghostscript
  but currently lcms2 from SUSE is used instead (see above).
- Do no longer require any fonts packages in particular
  neither require ghostscript-fonts-std because the PostScript
  Base35 fonts are provided by Ghostscript (in 'Resource')
  nor require ghostscript-fonts-other (provides Bitream Charter,
  Adobe Utopia, URW Antiqua, URW Grotesq and Hershey fonts where
  all but the last are also provided by texlive-<name>-fonts) and
  those fonts are not required for PostScript compliance, see

- ghostscript-fix-debug-use.patch is no longer needed
  because the issue is fixed in the upstream sources.
- fix_ln_docdir_gsdatadir.patch avoids
  "base/unixinst.mak:162: recipe for target 'install-doc' failed"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 29 16:04:48 CET 2017 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.22.
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
  Highlights in this release include:
  * Ghostscript can now consume and produce (via the pdfwrite
    device) PDF 2.0 compliant files.
  * The main focus of this release has been security and code
    cleanliness. Hence many AddressSanitizer, Valgrind and
    Coverity issues have been addressed.
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  Incompatible changes
  * The planned device API tidy (still!) did not happen for
    this release, due to time pressures, but we still intend
    to undertake the following: We plan to somewhat tidy up
    the device API. We intend to remove deprecated device procs
    (methods/function pointers) and change the device API
    so every device proc takes a graphics state parameter
    (rather than the current scheme where only a very few procs
    take an imager state parameter). This should serve as notice
    to anyone maintaining a Ghostscript device outside the
    canonical source tree that you may (probably will) need
    to update your device(s) when these changes happen.
    Devices using only the non-deprecated procs should be
    trivial to update.
- Up to 9.22rc1 it "just built" for all openSUSE versions but
  since 9.22rc2 the libijs part does no longer buid for any
  released openSUSE version where if fails with messages like
    libtool: Version mismatch error.
      This is libtool 2.4.6 Debian-2.4.6-2, but the
      definition of this LT_INIT comes from libtool 2.4.2.
      You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from
      libtool 2.4.6 Debian-2.4.6-2 and run autoconf again.
    Makefile: recipe for target 'ijs.lo' failed
  so that currently it only builds for Tumbleweed/Factory.
  Presumably it is not too complicated to make it build again
  also for released openSUSE versions but currently I have
  less than zero energy to fix such "latest breaking changes"
  so that for now Ghostscript 9.22 is only provided for
  openSUSE Tumbleweed/Factory and the upcoming SLE15/Leap15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 10 14:06:09 CEST 2017 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.21.
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
  Highlights in this release include:
  * pdfwrite now preserves annotations from
    input PDFs (where possible).
  * The GhostXPS interpreter now provides the pdfwrite device
    with the data it requires to emit a ToUnicode CMap: thus
    allowing fully searchable PDFs to be created from XPS
    input (in the vast majority of cases).
  * Ghostscript now allows the default color space
    for PDF transparency blends.
  * The Ghostscript/GhostPDL configure script now has much
    better/fuller support for cross compiling.
  * The tiffscaled and tiffscaled4 devices can now
    use ETS (Even Tone Screening)
  * The toolbin/pdf_info.ps utility can now emit
    the PDF XML metadata.
  * Ghostscript has a new scan converter available
    (currently optional, but will become the default in a near
    future release). It can be enabled by using the command line
    option: '-dSCANCONVERTERTYPE=2'. This new implementation
    provides vastly improved performance with large and complex
    paths.
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  Incompatible changes:
  * The planned device API tidy (still!) did not happen for
    this release, due to time pressures, but we still intend
    to undertake the following: We plan to somewhat tidy up
    the device API. We intend to remove deprecated device
    procs (methods/function pointers) and change the device API
    so every device proc takes a graphics state parameter
    (rather than the current scheme where only a very few procs
    take an imager state parameter). This should serve as notice

    update your device(s) when these changes happen. Devices using
    only the non-deprecated procs should be trivial to update.

  CVE-2016-7978.patch and CVE-2016-7979.patch and
  CVE-2016-8602.patch are no longer needed because
  those issues are fixed in the upstream sources.
- 0001-mkromfs-make-build-reproducible-use-buildtime-from-S.patch
  and
  0002-mkromfs-sort-gp_enumerate_files-output-for-determini.patch
  are no longer needed because both are included

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 14:40:38 CEST 2016 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.20. Purely a maintenance release.
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
  Highlights in this release include:
  * The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  Incompatible changes:
  * The planned device API tidy did not happen for this release,
    due to time pressures, but we still intend to undertake the
    following: We plan to somewhat tidy up the device API.

  see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Printing

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 23 15:43:27 CET 2016 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.19. Mainly a maintenance release.
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
  Highlights in this release include:
  * Metadata pdfmark is now implemented. This allows the user
    to specify an XMP stream which will be written to the
    Catalog of the PDF file. A new pdfmark 'Ext_Metadata' has
    been defined. This takes a string parameter which contains
    XML to be add to the XMP normally created by pdfwrite.
    See "pdfwrite pdfmark extensions" for more information.
  * An experimental, rudimentary raster trapping implementation
    has been added to the Ghostscript graphics library.
    See "Trapping" for details.
  Incompatible changes:
  * (Minor) API change: copy_alpha now supports 8 bit depth
    (as well as the previous 2 and 4).
  * The gs man pages are woefully out of date and basically
    unmaintained. With the release following 9.19, we intend
    to replace their contents with a very limited summary
    of (unlikely to ever change aspects of) calling
    Ghostscript, and a pointer to the (maintained) HTML
    documentation. That is, unless a volunteer is willing
    to update, and commit to maintaining the man pages.
  * ijs-config is no longer provided
  Planned incompatible changes:
  * We plan (ideally for the release following 9.19) to somewhat
    tidy up the device API. We plan to remove deprecated device
    procs (methods/function pointers). We also intend to merge
    the imager state and graphics state (thus eliminating the
    imager state), and change the device API so every device proc
    takes a graphics state parameter (rather than the current
    scheme where only a very few procs take an imager state
    parameter). This should serve as notice to anyone maintaining
    a Ghostscript device outside the canonical source tree that
    you may (probably will) need to update your device(s) when
    these changes happen. Devices using only the non-deprecated
    procs should be trivial to update.
- fix_make_install.patch fixes and
  add_brackets_for_old_autoconf.patch are no longer needed
  because both issues are fixed in the upstream sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 10:13:23 CET 2016 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.19rc1 (first release candidate for 9.19).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 18 11:46:58 UTC 2015 - schwab@suse.de

- Do not use library sources for freetype jpeg libpng tiff zlib
  from the Ghostscript upstream tarball because we prefer to use
  for long-established standard libraries the ones from SUSE
  in particular to automatically get SUSE security updates
  for standard libraries.
  In contrast we use e.g. lcms2 from the Ghostscript upstream
  tarball because this one is specially modified to work with
  Ghostscript so that we cannot use lcms2 from SUSE.
- remove-zlib-h-dependency.patch removes dependency on zlib/zlib.h
  in makefiles as we do not use the zlib sources from the
  Ghostscript upstream tarball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 13:33:14 CET 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- An incompatible change appeared when building other software
  with Ghostscript 9.18.
  Since version 9.18 Ghostscript does no longer provide
  e_<SomeError> (e.g. e_NeedInput) in its header files
  (gserrors.h and ierrors.h).
  When building other software with Ghostscript 9.18
  gs_error_<SomeError> (e.g. gs_error_NeedInput)
  must be used, see boo#953149 and

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  6 10:21:22 CEST 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.18. A maintenance release.
  There are no recorded incompatible changes (as of this writing).
  Highlights in this release include:
  * A substantial revision of the build system and GhostPDL
    directory structure. Ghostscript-only users should
    not be affected by this change.
  * A new method of internally inserting devices into the device
    chain has been developed, named "device subclassing".
    This allows suitably written devices to be more easily and
    consistently as "filter" devices.
    The first fruit of this is a new implementation of
    the "-dFirstPage"/"-dLastPage" feature which functions
    a device filter in the Ghostscript graphics library, meaning
    it works consistently with all input languages.
  * Plus the usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 23 10:14:28 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.15. Primarily a maintenance release.
  There are no recorded incompatible changes (as of this writing).
  Highlights in this release include:
  * Ghostscript now supports the PDF security handler revision 6.
  * The pdfwrite and ps2write (and related) devices can now be
    forced to "flatten" glyphs into "basic" marking operations
    (rather than writing fonts to the output), by giving
    the -dNoOutputFonts command line option (defaults to "false").
  * PostScript programs can now use get_params or get_param to
    determine if a page contains color markings by reading the
    pageneutralcolor state from the device (so whether the page
    is "color" or "mono"). Note that this is only accurate when in
    clist mode, so -dMaxBitmap=0 and -dGrayDetection=true should
    both be used.
  * The pdfwrite device now supports Link annotations with GoTo
    and GoToR actions.
  * The pdfwrite device now supports BMC/BDC/EMC pdfmarks
  * Regarding the new color management for the pdfwrite device
    introduced in the previous release, the proscription on using
    the new color management when producing PDF/A-1 compliant files
    is now lifted. To reiterate, also, with the new color
    management implementation, using the UseCIEColor option is
    strongly discouraged. For further information on the new
    pdfwrite color management, see in Ps2pdf.htm the
    "Color Conversion and Management" section.
  * Plus the usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes,
    and incremental improvements.
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.

Wed Sep 17 12:17:47 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.15rc2 (second release candidate for 9.15).
  Ghostscript upstream QA highlighted a couple of issues
  that they felt warranted a fresh release candidate.
  For details see the History9.htm file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  9 16:06:31 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.15rc1 (first release candidate for 9.15).
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
- ppc64le-support.patch is no longer needed because
  it is fixed in the upstream sources.
- Removed trailing whitespaces in spec file and changes file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 18 15:12:28 UTC 2014 - meissner@suse.com

- gs does not seem to require libopenssl-devel for building.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 27 12:21:55 CET 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.14. Primarily a maintenance release.
  Highlights in this release include (excerpt):
  * pdfwrite now uses the same color management engine as
    Ghostscript rendering devices (by default LCMS2). For
    the duration of this release a new switch -dPDFUseOldCMS
    is available which will restore the old color management.
    See: "Color Conversion and Management" in Ps2pdf.htm
    Due to constraints of the PDF/A-1 specification, the new color
    management does not yet apply when producing PDF/A files.
  * A new device 'eps2write' has been added which allows for the
    creation of EPS files using the ps2write device instead of
    the deprecated and removed pswrite device. The epswrite device
    is now also deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  * Ghostscript has a new "pwgraster" output device for PWG Raster
    output.
  * The CUPS device now has improved support for PPD-less printing.
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.

Fri Dec 13 19:09:12 UTC 2013 - uweigand@de.ibm.com

- ppc64le-support.patch from IBM fixes endianness
  in lcms (the Little-CMS library) to support the new
  architecture ppc64le (IBM Power PC Little Endian architecture)
  because ppc64 is big-endian and ppc64le is little-endian
  and lcms has a hard-coded check that assumes PowerPC
  is always big-endian which is incorrect on ppc64le.
  The fix is already in the main Little-CMS repository
  by this Git commit
  https://github.com/mm2/Little-CMS/commit/b4f5c91a2c1582bd284f0d0f49cb43e2c2235a79
  (There are some cosmetic changes in the upstream patch.)
  It is not yet in the imported copy in Ghostscript.
  IBM will work with upstream to get the fix imported too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  3 16:26:46 CEST 2013 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.10. Primarily a maintenance release.
  Highlights in this release include:
  * LittleCMS2 and libpng have both been updated to the
    latest versions.
  * The URW Postscript font set has been updated to the
    latest version, fixing many compatibility problems
    with the Adobe fonts.
  * The CUPS filters gstoraster and gstopxl have been
    removed from Ghostscript. Those filters are now provided by
    cups-filters (a free software package hosted by OpenPrinting)
    that contains all CUPS filters needed by CUPS under Linux
    (see also the openSUSE issue bnc#735404 comment#44 at
     https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735404#c44).
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
- fix-undefined-operation.patch is no longer needed because
  it is fixed in the upstream sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 29 15:06:13 CEST 2013 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.10rc1 (release candidate for the 9.10 version).
  For details see the News.htm and History9.htm files.
- Prepare spec files to build both releases and release candidates
  easily in the future by using special different version strings.
- fix-undefined-operation.patch fixes
  http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694546
- Removed BuildRequires for liblcms-devel because it is not needed
  when we build Ghostscript that works in compliance with upstream
  (see https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=828751#c5).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 27 07:58:08 UTC 2013 - mmeister@suse.com

- Added url as source.
  Please see http://en.opensuse.org/SourceUrls

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 19 13:51:06 CET 2013 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 9.07.
  * As of this release (9.07), Ghostscript is distributed
    under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).
  * Ghostscript has been extended to support file sizes >4Gb
    in particular reading and writing PDF files.
  * Color management enhancements. Full details of the color
    management features can be found in: GS9_Color_Management.pdf
  * The pdfwrite devices now supports linearized (or optimized
    for fast web view) output directly ("-dFastWebView").
  * With the addition of linearisation to pdfwrite, pdfopt.ps
    has become redundant. Since it is difficult to maintain,
    has a number of bugs, and is believed not to work properly
    anyway, it is removed. Accordingly the pdfopt shell script
    that used pdfopt.ps is also removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  3 11:58:51 CET 2013 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Provide libijs (that is not done via "configure --with-ijs")
  because libijs is needed by the pdftoijs filter in the
  cups-filters package (see the README file in cups-filters).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 27 12:02:51 UTC 2012 - mmeister@suse.com

- Version upgrade to 9.06. Mainly a bugfix release.
  * pdfwrite announcements:
    pdfwrite now supports the creation of PDF/A-2 files.
    For further details see the NEWS file.
  * removed moribund dumphint tool, see History9.htm and
    http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=693223

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 24 10:44:57 UTC 2012 - idonmez@suse.com

- "export SUSE_ASNEEDED=0" disables -Wl,--as-needed linker flags,
  see http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=693100

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 10 15:49:33 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Require Ghostscript's font packages because the
  Ghostscript package provides the "Fontmap" file
  /usr/share/ghostscript/<version>/Resource/Init/Fontmap.GS
  which lists Ghostscript's fonts but the fonts itself
  are provided in the separated packages ghostscript-fonts-std
  and ghostscript-fonts-other so that a RPM requirement
  is needed to make sure that Ghostscript has its fonts.
- Extract the catalog of devices which are actually built-in
  in exactly this Ghostscript and provide it as catalog.devices
  in the Ghostscript package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 27 10:40:53 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- BuildRequires dbus-1-devel for "configure --enable-dbus"
  to have colord support in gstoraster (see the entry regarding
  "color management daemon" in doc/History9.htm).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 24 14:30:45 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Install documentation which is not installed by default
  (LICENSE doc/AUTHORS doc/COPYING doc/thirdparty.htm
   doc/WhatIsGS.htm doc/GS9_Color_Management.pdf
   doc/gs-vms.hlp doc/Ps2ps2.htm).
- Add a link from SUSE's usual documentation directory
  (/usr/share/doc/packages/ghostscript/) to Ghostscript's
  documentation directory (/usr/share/ghostscript/9.05/doc/)
  because "configure --docdir=..." does not work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  5 15:06:56 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Removed BuildRequires docbook-toys which is not needed
  (db2ps and db2pdf called in ijs/Makefile.am to make ijs_spec.ps
   and ijs_spec.pdf but neither of them is made - both are
   provided in the sources) but docbook-toys pulls in packages
  like texlive-bin-jadetex and texlive-jadetex which needlessly
  blow up the build system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 28 10:59:21 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Require the basic fonts for Ghostscript
  (package ghostscript-fonts-std) and recommend the
  optional fonts (package ghostscript-fonts-other).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 11:32:28 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Cleaned up BuildRequires.
- Added ghostscript-mini.spec with minimal BuildRequires.
- Explicitly specify configure --with-* versus --without-*
  in ghostscript.spec versus ghostscript-mini.spec
  to make the differences clear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 16 10:27:01 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Unfortunately ghostscript-library.spec and ghostscript-mini.spec
  have unversioned "Provides: ghostscript" and for RPM this means
  that both ghostscript-library and ghostscript-mini
  provide any version of ghostscript. Therefore any non-matching
  version of ghostscript-library and ghostscript-mini fulfill
  any RPM requirement for ghostscript in the ghostscript-x11
  and ghostscript-devel sub-packages which is wrong.
  Therefore explicit conflicts with ghostscript-library and
  ghostscript-mini are specified in the ghostscript-x11
  and ghostscript-devel sub-packages to avoid the mess.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 15 16:43:26 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Configure --without-libpaper disables libpaper support
  because SUSE does not have libpaper.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 15 12:28:36 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Configure --without-jasper and --enable-openjpeg because
  since Ghostscript 9.05 JasPer is deprecated and Ghostscript
  now ships modified OpenJPEG sources for JPEG2000 decoding
  (replacing JasPer). Performance, reliability and memory use
  whilst decoding JPX streams are all improved. Accordingly
  the BuildRequires libjasper-devel is removed.
- Configure --without-ufst and --without-luratech because
  those are relevant to commercial releases only
  which would require a commercial license.
- Added BuildRequires libtool which requires automake and
  automake requires autoconf to fix build requirements
  for openSUSE:Factory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 24 16:48:06 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Using fixed /usr/lib/cups/filter (no lib64) because CUPS
  in the Printing project uses it in any case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 24 15:21:05 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Adapt RPM dependencies to what is actually used
  in openSUSE:Factory (dated 22 Feb. 2012).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 16 15:36:21 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Added RPM dependencies to make sure ghostscript-x11 and the
  main-package have exact matching version-release because both
  could have any kind of Ghostscript-internal dependencies.
  This is only an approximation to have ghostscript-x11 and
  the main-package from the same build where the main-package
  and its sub-package have been made but currently there is
  no clean way to specify a 'same build' RPM dependency.
  Therefore currently ghostscript-x11 and the main-package could
  have same version-release but nevertheless come from different
  projects/repositories (e.g. with different patches or
  whatever kind of differences).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 15 11:42:41 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Split files which require X11 stuff into a ghostscript-x11
  sub-package (currently only /usr/lib/ghostscript/9.05/X11.so)
  so that the ghostscript package can be installed without X11.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  9 11:34:33 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgrade to version 9.05 (see bnc#735824):
  New simple ink-coverage device (inkconv).
  The ps2write device has a large number of improvements.
  Fixes and improvements for the CUPS Raster output device
  (in particular Ghostscript bug 691922 regarding color model).
  Renamed the PXL CUPS filter from "pstopxl" to "gstopxl".
  For details see the doc/News.htm file.
- Removed "make cups" and "make cups-install" from spec file
  using "configure ... --with-install-cups" instead
  (new since version 9.04, see "configure --help").

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 13 15:18:06 UTC 2011 - jw@suse.com

- Upgrade to version 9.04 (see bnc#735824):
  For details see the doc/News.htm file.
- Added "make cups" and "make cups-install" to spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 15 16:06:40 CET 2011 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Initial ghostscript package.
