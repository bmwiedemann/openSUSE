    <comment>- updated to 1.3.13:
  * In I/O blob, don't rewind already open file handle passed to
    OpenBlob() since we don't know the intended state of this file
    handle, and because it prevents appending to an existing file.
  * In AppendImageProfile(), don't leak profile buffer while appending
    a chunk to an existing profile.
  * Fix deadlock in ClonePixelCache() which was caused by using the
    same semaphore pointer in the source and destination images.
  * etc. see NEWS.txt
- disabled perl.patch</comment>

    <comment>- updated to 1.3.14:
  Bug fixes:
  * TGA format: Assume that 32-bit TGA files have an alpha channel,
    even if they are not marked as such.
  * XCF format: Fix reading XCF which is comprised of different sized
    layers.
  * JPEG &amp; CineonLog: Convert RGB-compatible colorspaces
    (e.g. CineonLog) to RGB by default since that was the case prior
    to release 1.3.13.
  * RAW formats: Small memory leak in dcraw module was fixed.
  * Resize: ResizeImage() was ignoring its resize filter argument and
    was using the filter setting from the Image structure instead.
  * The mirror virtual pixel method was broken.
  New Features:
  * Open64 Compiler Suite: Version 5.0 is fully supported.
  * Wand API: Added MagickExtentImage().
  * MEF RAW: Mamiya Photo RAW &quot;MEF&quot; format is now supported.
  Feature improvements:
  * DPX format: Original file endianness is preserved by default.
  Performance Improvements:
  * Despeckle algorithm (-despeckle) is many times faster.
  Behavior Changes:
  * DPX format: Original file endianness is preserved by default.</comment>

    <comment>- updated to 1.3.15:
  Bug fixes:
  * PNG - fixed problem with bit depth when the encoder decides to
    write RGBA instead of indexed PNG.
  * Fixed some temporary file leaks which were caused by the temporary
    file name being automatically extended to include a scene number,
    and therefore fail to be deleted.
  New Features:
  * Added '+noise random' and '-operator noise-random' to 'convert'
    and 'mogrify'.  This modulates the existing image data with
    uniformely random noise.
  * Added -strip option in composite, convert, mogrify, and montage to
    remove all profiles and text attributes from the image.
  * Added -repage option to composite, convert, mogrify, and montage
    subcommands to reset or adjust the current image page offsets
    based on a provided geometry specification.
  * New C function StripImage() to remove all profiles and text
    attributes from the image.
  * New C function ResetImagePage() to adjust the current image page
    canvas and position based on a relative page specification.
  * C functions GenerateDifferentialNoise(), AddNoiseImageChannel(),
    QuantumOperatorRegionImage(), AddNoiseImage() updated to support
    RandomNoise enumeration.
  * New C++ Image method strip(), and unary function stripImage() to
    remove all profiles and text attributes from the image.
  * XCF format now respects image subimage and subrange members so
    that returned image layers may be selected.
  * The INFO coder (e.g. output file &quot;info:-&quot;) now respects the
    -format option so that its output may be adjusted identically to
    how -format works for 'identify'.</comment>

   * EscapeParenthesis(): I was notified by Gustavo Grieco of a heap
     overflow in EscapeParenthesis() used in the text annotation code.
     While not being able to reproduce the issue, the implementation of
     this function is completely redone.
   * Utah RLE: Reject truncated/absurd files which caused huge memory
     allocations and/or consumed huge CPU.  Problem was reported by
     Agostino Sarubbo based on testing with AFL.
   * SVG/MVG: Fix another case of CVE-2016-2317 (heap buffer overflow) in
     the MVG rendering code (also impacts SVG).
   * TIFF: Fix heap buffer read overflow while copying sized TIFF
     attributes.  Problem was reported by Agostino Sarubbo based on
     testing with AFL.</comment>

    <comment>- update to 1.3.29:
  * Security Fixes:
    . GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project 
    . JNG: Require that the embedded JPEG image have the same dimensions
      as the JNG image as provided by JHDR. Avoids a heap write overflow.
    . MNG: Arbitrarily limit the number of loops which may be requested by
      the MNG LOOP chunk to 512 loops, and provide the '-define
      mng:maximum-loops=value' option in case the user wants to change the
      limit.  This fixes a denial of service caused by large LOOP
      specifications.
  * Bug fixes:
    . DICOM: Pre/post rescale functions are temporarily disabled (until
      the implementation is fixed).
    . JPEG: Fix regression in last release in which reading some JPEG
      files produces the error &quot;Improper call to JPEG library in state
      201&quot;.
    . ICON: Some DIB-based Windows ICON files were reported as corrupt to
      an unexpectedly missing opacity mask image.
    . In-memory Blob I/O: Don't implicitly increase the allocation size
      due to seek offsets.
    . MNG: Detect and handle failure to allocate global PLTE. Fix divide
      by zero.
    . DrawGetStrokeDashArray(): Check for failure to allocate memory.
    . BlobToImage(): Now produces useful exception reports to cover the
      cases where 'magick' was not set and the file format could not be
      deduced from its header.
  * API Updates:
    . Wand API: Added MagickIsPaletteImage(), MagickIsOpaqueImage(),
      MagickIsMonochromeImage(), MagickIsGrayImage(), MagickHasColormap()
      based on contributions by Troy Patteson.</comment>

    <comment>- update to 1.3.30:
  * Security Fixes:
    . GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
      to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
      2018, 238 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 230 of those
      issues have been resolved.  The issues list is available at
      https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
      &quot;graphicsmagick&quot;.  Issues are available for anyone to view and
      duplicate if they have been in &quot;Verified&quot; status for 30 days, or if
      they have been in &quot;New&quot; status for 90 days.  There are too many
      fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
      file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
      for details.
    . SVG/Rendering: Fix heap write overflow of PrimitiveInfo and
      PointInfo arrays.  This is another manefestation of CVE-2016-2317,
      which should finally be fixed correctly due to active
      detection/correction of pending overflow rather than using
      estimation.
  * Bug fixes:
    . Many oss-fuzz fixes are bug fixes.
    . Drawing/Rendering: Many more fixes by Gregory J Wolfe (see the ChangeLog).
    . MIFF: Detect end of file while reading image directory.
    . SVG: Many more fixes by Gregory J Wolfe (see the ChangeLog).
    . The AlphaCompositePixel macro was producing wrong results when the
      output alpha value was not 100% opaque. This is a regression
      introduced in 1.3.29.
    . TILE: Fix problem with tiling JPEG images because the size request
      used by the TILE algorithm was also causing re-scaling in the JPEG
      reader.  The problem is solved by stripping the size request before
      reading the image. (forwarded request 627341 from namtrac)</comment>

    <comment>- update to 1.3.31:
  Special Issues:
  * Firmware and operating system updates to address the Spectre
    vulnerability (and possibly to some extent the Meltdown
    vulnerability) have substantially penalized GraphicsMagick's OpenMP
    performance.  Performance is reduced even with GCC 7 and 8's
    improved optimizers. There does not appear to be anything we can do
    about this.
  
  Security Fixes:
  * GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
    to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor.
 
  Bug fixes:
  * See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.
  * CINEON: Fix unexpected hang on a crafted Cineon image.  SourceForge
    issue 571.
  * Drawing recursion is limited to 100 and may be tuned via the
    MAX_DRAWIMAGE_RECURSION pre-processor definition.
  * Fix reading MIFF files using legacy keyword 'color-profile' for ICC
    color profile as was used by ImageMagick 4.2.9.
  * Fix reading/writing files when 'magick' is specified in lower case.
    This bug was a regression in 1.3.30.
  
  New Features:
  * TIFF: Support Zstd compression in TIFF.  This requires libtiff
    4.0.10 or later.
  * TIFF: Support WebP compression in TIFF.  This requires libtiff
    4.0.10 or later.

    <comment>- version update to 1.3.32
  New Features:
    * Added support for writing the Braille image format (by Samuel
      Thibault).
    * WebP writer: Support WebP 'use_sharp_yuv' option (&quot;if needed, use
      sharp (and slow) RGB-&gt;YUV conversion&quot;) via `-define
      webp:use-sharp-yuv=true`.
    * The version command output now reports the OpenMP specification
      number rather than just the integer version identifier.
  API Updates:
    * ReallocateImageColormap() added to re-allocate an existing colormap.
    * Some improperly-exposed globals are now static as they should have
      been.
    * The 'benchmark' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed
      time indication.
    * The 'time' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed time
      indication.
    * The logging facility now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of time
      resolulution
    * Dcraw: When QuantumDepth is greater than 8, pass -6 option to dcraw
      so that it returns a 16-bit/sample image.
    * Dcraw: If Dcraw supports TIFF format, then request TIFF format in
      order to be able to acquire more metatdata.
    * Scale algorithm: Eliminate artifacts when scaling an image with
      semi-transparent pixels.
    * Library metrics: The number of shared library relocations and the
      amount of initialized data has been signficantly reduced by
      following recommendations from Ulrich Drepper's document `How To
      Write Shared Libraries &lt;https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf&gt;`_.

    <comment>- version update to 1.3.33
  * It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
    library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
    process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
    slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
    medium sized files.  The time to initialize is often longer than the
    time to read the input file, process the image, and write the output
    file.  If the 'ICU' dependency can not be avoided, then make sure to
    use the modules build.  Please lobby the 'ICU' library developers to
    change their implementation to avoid long start-up times due to
    merely linking with the library.
  * GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
    to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
    2018, 353 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 338 of those

    file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
    for details.
  * Documentation has been added regarding security hazards due to
    commands which support a '@filename' syntax.
  * MontageImages(): Fix wrong length argument to strlcat() when
    building montage directory, which could allow heap overwrite.
  * PNG: Pass correct size value to strlcat() in module registration
    code.  This bug is noticed to cause problems for Apple's OS X and
    Linux Alpine with musl libc.  This fixes a regression introduced by
    the 1.3.32 release.</comment>

    2018, 398 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz (some of which were
    benign build issues) and 11 issues remain open.
    The issues list is available at
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
    &quot;graphicsmagick&quot;.  Issues are available for anyone to view and
    duplicate if they have been in &quot;Verified&quot; status for 30 days, or if
    they have been in &quot;New&quot; status for 90 days.  There are too many
    fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
    file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
    for details.

    <comment>- version update to 1.3.36
  Security Fixes:
    * fix issues found by oss-fuzz project
    * WPG: Fixes for heap buffer overflow.
  Bug fixes:
    * ConstituteImage(): Set image depth appropriately based on the
      storage size specified by StorageType and QuantumDepth.
    * GetImageBoundingBox(): Fix problem that MagickTrimImage with extreme
      fuzz values could produce an image with negative width.
    * ImageToFile(): Improve error handling to avoid possible deferred
      deletion of temporary files, causing unexpected excessive use of
      temporary file space.
    * JNG: Add validations for alpha compression method values and use
      this information to enforce decoding using the appropriate
      sub-format (rather than auto-detecting the format).  Also, address
      memory leaks which may occur if the sub-decoder does something other
      than was expected.
    * MagickCondSignal(): Improvements to conditional signal handler
      registration (which avoids over-riding signal handlers previously
      registered by an API user).
    * ModifyCache(): Fix memory leak.
    * ReadCacheIndexes(): Don't blunder into accessing a null pointer if
      the using code has ignored a previous error report bubled-up from
      SetNexus().
    * MNG: When doing image scaling and the image width or height is 1
      then always use simple pixel replication as per the MNG
      specification.
    * MVG: Fixes to 'push clip-path foo' and 'pop clip-path foo' parsing
      to eliminate a class of malign behavior.
    * MVG: Place an aribrary limit on stroke dash polygon unit maximum</comment>

    <comment>- version update to 1.3.38
  Special Issues:
  * The FTP site ftp.graphicsmagick.org is now shut down due to a lack
    of bandwith, extremely abusive users (including from Google and
    customers of Amazon Web Services), and a lack of support from the
    user community.  Another factor is that FTP support has been removed
    from popular web browsers.  This is very unfortunate since the site
    served multiple usages, including providing a lot of historical data
    (e.g. related to PNG) which may not be available elsewhere.
  * GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
    volunteers.  For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
    me (Bob Friesenhahn).  I have been sheparding the project for 20
    years already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
    combined for 26 years already).  It is not reasonable to expect
    someone with a full time job (and expecting to retire in a few
    years) to do all of the work.

  Security Fixes:
  * GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project since
    February 4 2018 due to the contributions and assistance of Alex
    Gaynor and Paul Kehrer. The issues list is available at
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
    &quot;graphicsmagick&quot;.  Issues are available for anyone to view and
    duplicate if they have been in &quot;Verified&quot; status for 30 days, or if
    they have been in &quot;New&quot; status for 90 days.  Please consult the
    GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
    the oss-fuzz issues list for details.
  Security Fixes:
  * oss-fuzz: Several security fixes originating from oss-fuzz testing.
  * ALL: Replace strcpy() with strlcpy(), replace strcat() with
    strlcat(), replace sprintf() with snprintf().  Prefer using bounded
    string functions.  This change is made for the purpose of increasing
    safety than to address any existing demonstrated concern.
  Bug fixes:
  * Coverity: Several fixes for issues found by Coverity to reduce the
    number of reported issues back down to zero.
  * Clang Analyzer 12: Fix most discovered issues.
  * PNG: Fix possible use of uninitialized 'ping_num_trans' value in
    ReadOnePNGImage().
  * MinGW: Eliminate overwrite of existing _MSC_VER value in MinGW compile.
  * MNG: Fix heap-use-after-free in CloseBlob.
  * MNG: Fix indirect leak in MagickMallocCleared().
  * PS: Assure that 'bounds' structure is initialized.
  * EPT: Assure that 'bounds' structure is initialized.
  * HEIF: If heif_image_handle_get_metadata_size() returns 0, then
    carrying on with reading image data.
  * configure.ac: Fix Bashism in maintainer-mode check.
  * TGA: Remove a defective validation of comment length, which blocked
    reading some sample TGA files from the &quot;Encyclopedia Of Graphics
    File Formats&quot; book.  Monochromatic bilevel TGA can now be read and
    written.  TGA &quot;Footers&quot; are now read and used when logging as well
    as converted to Image attributes.
  * WebP: Add configure.ac updates to check for libsharpyuv so that
    builds with the development version work again.
  * Visual Studio Build (VisualMagick): Fix project file generation.
    Improve portability of code for configure.exe.
  * Fixed mixed encoding (non-UTF-8) errors in text and source files.
  * DrawPrimitive(): Fix composition using &quot;0,0&quot; for image size.  This
    became broken in GraphicsMagick 1.3.36.
  * Blob API: Fixed SEEK_END validation.  SEEK_END was not used before,
    but now it is.
  New Features:
  * AVIF: Support reading AVIF via libheif if it supports decoding AVIF
    (still no writer support).
  * LOG: Added function IsEventLogged() to report if a particular event
    will be logged.  Us this as much as possible throughout the software
    to replace use of IsEventLogging().  This avoids a possible
    performance hit if any logging is enabled at all and logging
    statements are executed which are filtered and produce no output.
  * FITS: Support storing multiple scenes in one file (non-standard
    extension).
  * JPEG: Optionally enable arithmetic coder in JPG images using
    '-define jpeg:arithmetic-coding=true'.
  * JPEG: Add support for reading deep gray images.
  * HEIF: Support reading ICC color profiles.
  * Produce ASCII armored &quot;.asc&quot; format GPG signature files.
  * Support reading directly from .bz2, .gz, .svgz, and .Z files
    (without creating a temporary file), if possible.
  API Updates:
  * Magick++: Provide a version of Image::colorMapSize() which is a
    'const' method.  Continue to provide the non-const version in order
    to avoid an ABI change.  The compiler should choose the appropriate
    version.
  Feature improvements:
  * HTML documentation generation based on Docutils is significantly
    updated and improved.
  * PerlMagick: Added more sample input files and changed many reader
    tests to use hash signature rather than comparison to reduce the
    distribution size.
  * Blob: The ReadBlobString() function has been re-written to perform
    better when reading from files.
  * JXL: The JXL coder is updated to compile with what will likely
    become JXL 0.8.0.  Support for 16-bit 'short' samples, 16-bit
    'float' samples, and 32-bit float samples added.  Support for
    reading and writing ICC, EXIF, and XMP profiles added.
  * MIME: GM &quot;magick&quot; to MIME mappings have been added for apng, avif,
    bmp, ico, and webp (regardless of if they are supported).
  * XPM: The XPM reader performance is dramatically improved and is
    observed to be 32x faster when reading a medium-sized XPM file
    (e.g. the GraphicsMagick logo).
  * XPM: Support reading &quot;deep&quot; images with more pallete entries than
    the maximum colormap size.
  Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:
  * Update bundled libjasper to version 1.900.26. Please note that 4.0.0
    is the latest version at this time and fixes a great many security
    and stability issues which are present in 1.900.26.
  * Update bundled libjpeg to version 9e.
  * Update bundled libtiff to version 4.5.0.
  Build Changes:
  * MSVC: Added porting function to emulate C'99 snprintf for MSVC older
    than 2015.
  * MSVC: Successfully compiles using Visual Studio 2008 and 2019.
    Compiles successfully using Visual Studio 2022 if optimization is
    disabled (otherwise there is an internal compiler error in effect.c).

  https://sourceforge.net/p/graphicsmagick/bugs/722/
- added patches
  fix 17179:91afa18a6161
  + GraphicsMagick-fix-regression-NULL-instead-of-empty-string.patch
  fix 17180:bb42cd90ce6f
  + GraphicsMagick-name-key-return-input-file-base-name.patch

- version update to 1.3.41
  Bug fixes:
  * Blob: Immediately reject attempts to write blobs to formats which
    can not support blobs.
  * TranslateTextEx(): An empty string argument should return an empty
    string rather than a NULL string.
  * SetImageAttribute(): Fix bounds issue when concatenating string.
  * JPEG: Do not set image resolution if the values provided are outside
    of the valid range.
  * Fixes for NaN when reading formats based on floating point.
  * HEIF: Fix reading images with rotation/transformation.
  * BMP: Do not decode primaries or gamma unless colorspace is
    LCS_CALIBRATED_RGB.  Add/correct bmp_info.size &quot;biSize&quot; logic which
    decides if header chunks are present (or invalid).
  * MNG: Fixes for resizing using X_method 5.
  * GM command (convert, montage, mogrify): Many command-line parser
    fixes/checks for invalid command line syntax which causes unexpected
    behavior, or core dumps.
  
  * TopoL: Given that a writer is now provided, issues found in the
    reader (and writer) due to continual fuzz-testing have been fixed,
    as encountered.</comment>

    <comment>- version update to 1.3.42
Bug fixes:
  * TIFF: Default the alpha channel to type EXTRASAMPLE_UNASSALPHA(2).
  * BMP: Many fixes for reading esoteric BMP sub-formats.
  * TranslateTextEx(): Revert change so now a NULL pointer is returned
    when given an empty string.  Some algorithms (e.g. montage) were
    depending on this!.
  * PAM: Fix reading comments.
  * PNG: Added Add missing module aliases &quot;PNG00&quot;, &quot;PNG48&quot;, &quot;PNG64&quot;, so
    it is again possible to request these subformats directly.
  * TIFF: For common formats with the required number of channels, but
    one is an 'unspecified' channel, promote unspecified alpha to
    unassociated alpha so that the alpha channel is not ignored.
  * &quot;Magick&quot; command line emulation: Eliminate duplicate utility name
    output in error messages
New Features:
* BMP: Added the ability to read and write BMP using JPEG compression.
  Use '-define bmp:allow-jpeg' to allow use of JPEG compression.
* BMP: Added support for BI_ALPHABITFIELDS compression
* BMP: Added support for reading BMP with PNG compression.

    <comment>- version update to 1.3.43
  Bug fixes:
  * JBIG: Add support for 'width', 'height', and 'pixels', resource
    limits.  Your mileage may vary.
  * WPG: Many fixes based on oss-fuzz testing.
  * Ghostscript: When invoking Ghostscript, re-direct Ghostscript stdout
    to stderr to avoid output corruption when GM stdout is redirected to
    a file.
  New Features:
  * File write limit: Add support for a per-file write limit (-limit
    write or MAGICK_LIMIT_WRITE).  This imposes a limit on the number of
    uncompressed bytes written.  The behavior when the limit is hit is
    similar to an unexpected write error, as if the disk is full.
  * Resource limit highwater: Resource highwater values are maintained
    for successful resource requests and final values are traced
    via -debug resource' at the end of program execution.  These values
    may be used to understand the most restrictive resource limits which
    may be applied while still achieving successful operation.
  * BMP: Support BI_PNG compression (PNG inside BMP).
  * BMP: Support reading 64 bits-per-pixel.
  * BMP: Support reading 48 bits-per-pixel.
  * HEIF: Call heif_init() and heif_deinit() if they are
    available. Support setting image width limit.
  * HRZ: Added support for Slow scan TV format.
  * JPEG: Added support for reading and writing lossy or lossless 12
    bits, and lossless 16-bits using libjpeg-turbo-3.0
  * JXL: Improve JXL reader/writer exception information.
  * TIFF: Remove miniswhite/minisblack prohibitions when using Group3
    and Group4 compression in order to allow using inverted photometric
    from the standard.</comment>

    <comment>- version update to 1.3.45
  Security Fixes:
  * TIFF: Fixed multiple heap and stack buffer overflows (directed by
    the source EXIF profile) while writing EXIF into the native TIFF
    IFD.
  * FITS: Fix problem that the FITS reader could return invalid image
    frames with rows or columns set to zero. Other code in the library
    crashes, or even asserts, if invalid image frames with rows or
    columns set to zero are returned.
  * Coverity fixes: Various fixes for Coverity issues raised after the
    update to version 2023.12.2.
  * Clang Analyzer (scan-build) fixes: Various fixes for new issues
    discovered by Clang Analyzer.
  
  Bug fixes:

  * JXL: Additional validations of color channel and alpha channel
    depth.
  * TGA: Fix issues discovered by Coverity.
  * TGA: Fix writing TGA with opacity values in palette.
  * TGA: Default orientation is (again) TopLeftOrientation.
  * TIFF: Verify that TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE is within a rational range.
  * TXT: Eliminate use of an uninitialized-value in GetColorTuple().
  * XML: Improve detection of if the deprecated HTTP and FTP protocols
    are supported by libxml2.</comment>
