- version update to 1.3.39
  Special Issues:
  * GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
    volunteers.  For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
    me (Bob Friesenhahn).  I have been sheparding the project for 20
    years already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
    combined for 26 years already).  It is not reasonable to expect
    someone with a full time job (and expecting to retire in a few
    years) to do all of the work.
  Security Fixes:
  * GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project since
    February 4 2018 due to the contributions and assistance of Alex
    Gaynor and Paul Kehrer. The issues list is available at
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
    "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
    duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
    they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  Please consult the
    GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
    the oss-fuzz issues list for details.
  Security Fixes:
  * oss-fuzz: Several security fixes originating from oss-fuzz testing.
  * ALL: Replace strcpy() with strlcpy(), replace strcat() with
    strlcat(), replace sprintf() with snprintf().  Prefer using bounded
    string functions.  This change is made for the purpose of increasing
    safety than to address any existing demonstrated concern.
  Bug fixes:
  * Coverity: Several fixes for issues found by Coverity to reduce the
    number of reported issues back down to zero.
  * Clang Analyzer 12: Fix most discovered issues.
  * PNG: Fix possible use of uninitialized 'ping_num_trans' value in
    ReadOnePNGImage().
  * MinGW: Eliminate overwrite of existing _MSC_VER value in MinGW compile.
  * MNG: Fix heap-use-after-free in CloseBlob.
  * MNG: Fix indirect leak in MagickMallocCleared().
  * PS: Assure that 'bounds' structure is initialized.
  * EPT: Assure that 'bounds' structure is initialized.
  * HEIF: If heif_image_handle_get_metadata_size() returns 0, then
    carrying on with reading image data.
  * configure.ac: Fix Bashism in maintainer-mode check.
  * TGA: Remove a defective validation of comment length, which blocked
    reading some sample TGA files from the "Encyclopedia Of Graphics
    File Formats" book.  Monochromatic bilevel TGA can now be read and
    written.  TGA "Footers" are now read and used when logging as well
    as converted to Image attributes.
  * WebP: Add configure.ac updates to check for libsharpyuv so that
    builds with the development version work again.
  * Visual Studio Build (VisualMagick): Fix project file generation.
    Improve portability of code for configure.exe.
  * Fixed mixed encoding (non-UTF-8) errors in text and source files.
  * DrawPrimitive(): Fix composition using "0,0" for image size.  This
    became broken in GraphicsMagick 1.3.36.
  * Blob API: Fixed SEEK_END validation.  SEEK_END was not used before,
    but now it is.
  New Features:
  * AVIF: Support reading AVIF via libheif if it supports decoding AVIF
    (still no writer support).
  * LOG: Added function IsEventLogged() to report if a particular event
    will be logged.  Us this as much as possible throughout the software
    to replace use of IsEventLogging().  This avoids a possible
    performance hit if any logging is enabled at all and logging
    statements are executed which are filtered and produce no output.
  * FITS: Support storing multiple scenes in one file (non-standard
    extension).
  * JPEG: Optionally enable arithmetic coder in JPG images using
    '-define jpeg:arithmetic-coding=true'.
  * JPEG: Add support for reading deep gray images.
  * HEIF: Support reading ICC color profiles.
  * Produce ASCII armored ".asc" format GPG signature files.
  * Support reading directly from .bz2, .gz, .svgz, and .Z files
    (without creating a temporary file), if possible.
  API Updates:
  * Magick++: Provide a version of Image::colorMapSize() which is a
    'const' method.  Continue to provide the non-const version in order
    to avoid an ABI change.  The compiler should choose the appropriate
    version.
  Feature improvements:
  * HTML documentation generation based on Docutils is significantly
    updated and improved.
  * PerlMagick: Added more sample input files and changed many reader
    tests to use hash signature rather than comparison to reduce the
    distribution size.
  * Blob: The ReadBlobString() function has been re-written to perform
    better when reading from files.
  * JXL: The JXL coder is updated to compile with what will likely
    become JXL 0.8.0.  Support for 16-bit 'short' samples, 16-bit
    'float' samples, and 32-bit float samples added.  Support for
    reading and writing ICC, EXIF, and XMP profiles added.
  * MIME: GM "magick" to MIME mappings have been added for apng, avif,
    bmp, ico, and webp (regardless of if they are supported).
  * XPM: The XPM reader performance is dramatically improved and is
    observed to be 32x faster when reading a medium-sized XPM file
    (e.g. the GraphicsMagick logo).
  * XPM: Support reading "deep" images with more pallete entries than
    the maximum colormap size.
  Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:
  * Update bundled libjasper to version 1.900.26. Please note that 4.0.0
    is the latest version at this time and fixes a great many security
    and stability issues which are present in 1.900.26.
  * Update bundled libjpeg to version 9e.
  * Update bundled libtiff to version 4.5.0.
  Build Changes:
  * MSVC: Added porting function to emulate C'99 snprintf for MSVC older
    than 2015.
  * MSVC: Successfully compiles using Visual Studio 2008 and 2019.
    Compiles successfully using Visual Studio 2022 if optimization is
    disabled (otherwise there is an internal compiler error in effect.c).

- Enable JPEG-XL on Tumbleweed.

Tue Apr 12 07:50:49 UTC 2022 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.3.38
  Special Issues:
  * The FTP site ftp.graphicsmagick.org is now shut down due to a lack
    of bandwith, extremely abusive users (including from Google and
    customers of Amazon Web Services), and a lack of support from the
    user community.  Another factor is that FTP support has been removed
    from popular web browsers.  This is very unfortunate since the site
    served multiple usages, including providing a lot of historical data
    (e.g. related to PNG) which may not be available elsewhere.
  * GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
    volunteers.  For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
    me (Bob Friesenhahn).  I have been sheparding the project for 20
    years already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
    combined for 26 years already).  It is not reasonable to expect
    someone with a full time job (and expecting to retire in a few
    years) to do all of the work.
  Security Fixes:
  * GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due to
    the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
    2018, ??? issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and ?? issues remain
    open.  The issues list is available at
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
    "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
    duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
    they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  Please consult the
    GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
    the oss-fuzz issues list for details.
  Bug fixes:
  * Documentation: Generator scripts in 'doc' directory now produce
    similar results using GNU sed and Solaris/Illumos sed and don't
    produce warnings.
  * JNG: Fixes to error handling to avoid temporary file leaks and
    avoiding returning a broken image.
  * JPEG: Always store embedded profiles in image, even if in 'ping'
    mode.
  * MAT: Change from using 'int' for sizes/offsets to using 'size_t' and
    check all related calculations for overload.
  * MIFF: Fix heap buffer overflow which may be provoked in builds with
    BZLIB support.
  * MogrifyImage() and Magick::Image::trim(): Trim requires
    NorthWestGravity.
  * PICT: Fixed a heap overflow.
  * PerlMagick: Fix issue that image fill attribute had its opacity
    reset to transparent so it could not be usefully set at image scope.
  * Test Suite: Fixed portability issue related to 'sed' which broke
    utilities/tests/convert.tap test script.
  * WPG: Fix incorrect TrX and TrY elements in CTM.
  New Features:
  * Added support for a 'Read' resource limit (e.g. '-limit read 5mb').
    This allows the user to specify a hard limit for how much data may
    be read from a file, read from a pipe, or decompressed from a file
    (e.g gzip or bzip2) before a hard error is reported.  This resource
    limit is a useful alternative to completely disabling support for
    compressed files using the --disable-compressed-files option and it
    provides more protections as well.
  * Added support for reading HEIF/HEIC format.
  * Added support for reading and writing JPEG XL format.
  * Support for JasPer 3.0.0 is completed.  Upgrading to JasPer 3.0.0 is
    strongly recommended due to its many security fixes and integration
    with GraphicsMagick's resource-limited memory allocator.
  * PNG: Support the define png:chunk-malloc-max=limit in order to allow
    reading PNG files which report "chunk data is too large" or to
    reduce the default limit.
  * compare: Added support for the '-compress' option.
  * compare: Added support for the '-auto-orient' option.  This tries to
    assure that the two images are right-side up before comparing.
  API Updates:
  * Magick++: Support the new 'ReadResource' enumeration.
  Feature improvements:
  * JPEG: Implement more efficient way to append JPEG profile chunks.
  * Resource Limited Memory: The resource limited memory allocator now
    maintains useful statistics such as a tally of the total number of
    octets moved by realloc.
  Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:
  * None
  Build Changes:
  * In maintainer mode, the configure script searches for a GnuPG 'gpg'
    program to use for signing snapshot releases and uses this to
    support PGP-signed development snapshots.
  Behavior Changes:
  * None
  * fixes CVE-2022-1270 [bsc#1198351]

- version update to 1.3.36
  Security Fixes:
    * fix issues found by oss-fuzz project
    * WPG: Fixes for heap buffer overflow.
  Bug fixes:
    * ConstituteImage(): Set image depth appropriately based on the
      storage size specified by StorageType and QuantumDepth.
    * GetImageBoundingBox(): Fix problem that MagickTrimImage with extreme
      fuzz values could produce an image with negative width.
    * ImageToFile(): Improve error handling to avoid possible deferred
      deletion of temporary files, causing unexpected excessive use of
      temporary file space.
    * JNG: Add validations for alpha compression method values and use
      this information to enforce decoding using the appropriate
      sub-format (rather than auto-detecting the format).  Also, address
      memory leaks which may occur if the sub-decoder does something other
      than was expected.
    * MagickCondSignal(): Improvements to conditional signal handler
      registration (which avoids over-riding signal handlers previously
      registered by an API user).
    * ModifyCache(): Fix memory leak.
    * ReadCacheIndexes(): Don't blunder into accessing a null pointer if
      the using code has ignored a previous error report bubled-up from
      SetNexus().
    * MNG: When doing image scaling and the image width or height is 1
      then always use simple pixel replication as per the MNG
      specification.
    * MVG: Fixes to 'push clip-path foo' and 'pop clip-path foo' parsing
      to eliminate a class of malign behavior.
    * MVG: Place an aribrary limit on stroke dash polygon unit maximum
      length in order to avoid possibly rendering "forever".
    * PCL: No longer attempt to handle reading HP PCL format via the
      external 'hp2xx' program since it seems worthless for that task.
    * PS: Fix corrupt image when writing PseudoClass image with a colormap
      larger than two entries as bilevel.
    * SVG: Memory leak fixes.
    * SVG reader: Now support 'ping' support so the identify command works
      as expected.
    * TIFF: WEBP compression only supports a depth of 8 so force that
      value.
    * Wand MagickSetSamplingFactors(): Correct formatting of sampling
      factors string.
    New Features:
    * Logging is now fully programmable.
    * DPX format: Support dpx:swap-samples-read define which behaves
      similar to dpx:swap-samples, but is only applied when reading, as
      well as dpx:swap-samples-write, which is only applied when
      writing. This provides for use when there is both reading and
      writing in the same operation (otherwise the final result was no
      effect!).
  API Updates:
    * magick/api.h: Add "magick/enum_strings.h" to API headers.
    * New log settings accessor C functions: SetLogDefaultFileName(),
      SetLogDefaultFormat(), SetLogDefaultOutputType(),
      SetLogDefaultLogMethod(), SetLogDefaultLimit(),
      SetLogDefaultGenerations(), SetLogDefaultEventType().  These
      functions allow a program to set the same parameters which may be
      set by loading a "log.mgk" function.  If a default logging callback
      was provided via SetLogDefaultLogMethod() such that MethodOutput is
      used, then the search for a "log.mgk" is avoided entirely.
    * New log settings accessor C++ functions: SetLogDefaultFileName(),
      SetLogDefaultFormat(), SetLogDefaultOutputType(),
      SetLogDefaultLogMethod(), SetLogDefaultLimit(),
      SetLogDefaultGenerations(), SetLogDefaultEventType().  These C++
      functions just pass through to the equivalent C functions and
      provide the same benefits.
    * A simple resource-limit respecting memory allocator has been
      developed for internal use wherever arbitrarily-large amounts of
      memory might be requested.  This will gradually be added wherever it
      appears to be needed.  The memory resource limits are at the overall
      process level.  The MVG/SVG rendering code is updated to use this
      new allocator.  Almost all of the coders (image format
      readers/writers) have now been updated to use this new allocator.
      This means that '-limit memory 300MB' would be more complete and
      meaningful now.  Temporary allocations by the image processing
      algorithms (other than for the images themselves) are still not
      accounted for in the resource limiting.
    * MVG Renderer / DrawImage(): Use resource-limit respecting memory
      allocators for remaining large memory allocations.
    * PNG writer: Don't skip optional Exif identifier code if it isn't present.
    * DPX reader/writer: decode/encode of 10-bit packed DPX is now twice
      as fast due to code simplification.
    * TIFF reader: Apply the same resource limits to TIFF tile sizes as
      apply to the image itself.

- version update to 1.3.35
  Special Issues:
  * It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
    library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
    process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
    slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
    medium sized files.  The time to initialize the 'ICU' library is
    often longer than the time that GraphicsMagick would otherwise
    require to read the input file, process the image, and write the
    output file.  If the 'ICU' dependency can not be avoided, then make
    sure to use the modules build so there is only impact for file
    formats which require libxml2.  Please lobby the 'ICU' library
    developers to change their implementation to avoid long start-up
    times due to merely linking with the library.
  Security Fixes:
  * GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
    to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
    2018, 398 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz (some of which were
    benign build issues) and 11 issues remain open.
    The issues list is available at
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
    "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
    duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
    they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
    fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
    file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
    for details.
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix broken definition of ResourceInfinity which resulted in that
    GetMagickResource() would return -1 rather than the maximum range
    value for the return type as documented. (problem added by the
    1.3.32 release).
  * ModifyCache(): Re-open the pixel cache if the cache rows/columns do
    not match the owning image rows/columns.
  * Fix DisplayImages() return status.  The return status was inverted.
  * HISTOGRAM: Histogram once again includes the histogram as a text
    comment.  This became broken by previous security fixes.
  * PICT: Fixed heap buffer overuns reported multiple sources.
  * JNG: Detect when JPEG encoder has failed and throw an exception.
  * MVG/DrawImage(): Performs even more parsing validations.
  * Clang static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made based on
    problem reports by the Clang static analyzer.
  * Visual Studio static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made
    based on problem reports by the Visual Studio 2019 static analyzer.
    Many of these may improve the robustness of 64-bit code.
  New Features:
  * GRADIENT/GradientImage(): Improved accuracy of gradient levels as
    well as dramaticaly improving performance.  Output PseudoClass
    images if we can.  Add support for using the image 'gravity'
    attribute as well as the "gradient:direction" definition to produce
    gradient vector directions corresponding to SouthGravity (the
    previously-existing default), NorthGravity, WestGravity,
    EastGravity, NorthWestGravity, NorthEastGravity, SouthWestGravity,
    and SouthEastGravity.
  API Updates:
  * InitializeMagickEx(): New function which may be used in place of
    InitializeMagick() to initialize GraphicsMagick.  This
    initialization function returns an error status value, may update a
    passed ExceptionInfo structure with error information, and provides
    an options parameter which supports simple bit-flags to tailor
    initialization.  The signal handler registrations are skipped if the
    MAGICK_OPT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDER flag is set in the options.
  Feature improvements:
  * Replace use of non-reentrant legacy POSIX functions with reentrant
    equivalents.
  * Timing of image reads should now be very accurate.  The timer was
    sometimes not stopped as soon as it should be.
  * PICT: The PICT reader is working pretty good now.  It handles all
    the PICT image files I have available to me.
  Behavior Changes:
  * POSIX Signals: Use the normal termination signal handler for SIGXCPU
    and SIGXFSZ so that ulimit or setrlimit(2) may be used to apply CPU
    (RLIMIT_CPU) and output file size (RLIMIT_FSIZE) limits with the
    normal cleanup, and without dumping core. Note that any output files
    currently being written may be truncated and files being written by
    external programs (e.g. Ghostscript) might be left behind unless
    they are to a temporary file assigned by GraphicsMagick.
  * Some private string and integer constants were removed from the
    apparent library ABI.  Some private functions were marked static and
    removed from the apparent library ABI.  This is mentioned because
    someone is sure to notice and be concerned about it.
  * The remaining private content in installed header files was moved
    into -private.h header files which are not installed.  This should
    not be cause for concern but is mentiond because someone is sure to
    notice and be concerned about it.

  * MontageImages(): Fix wrong length argument to strlcat() when
    building montage directory, which could allow heap overwrite.
  * PNG: Pass correct size value to strlcat() in module registration
    code.  This bug is noticed to cause problems for Apple's OS X and
    Linux Alpine with musl libc.  This fixes a regression introduced by
    the 1.3.32 release.
  * Re-implement command-line utility `'@'` file inclusion support for
    `-comment`, `-draw`, `-format`, and `-label` which was removed for
    the 1.3.32 release.  The new implementation is isolated to
    command-line utility implementation code rather than being deeply
    embedded in the library and exposed in other usage contexts.  This
    fixes a regression introduced by the 1.3.32 release.
  * CAPTION: The The CAPTION reader did not appear to work at all any
    more.  Now it works again, but still not very well.
  * MagickXDisplayImage(): Fix heap overwrite of windows->image.name and
    windows->image.icon_name buffers.  This bug has surely existed since
    early GraphicsMagick releases.
  * MagickXAnimateImages(): Fix memory leak of scene_info.pixels.
  * AcquireTemporaryFileDescriptor(): Fix compilation under Cygwin. This
    fixes a regression introduced by the 1.3.32 release.
  * PNG: Fix saving to palette when mage has an alpha channel but no
    color is marked as transparent.
  * Compilation warnings in the Visual Studio WIN64 build due to the
    'long' type being only 32-bits have been addressed.

- Cleanup BuildRequires:
  * Remove ghostscript-library (support removed  upstream)
  * Use ghostscript-mini (sufficient for path and feature detection)
    instead of full ghostscript (implicitly added by ghostscript-library)
  * Remove ghostscript-fonts-other (unused).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 18 08:36:44 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.3.32
  New Features:
    * Added support for writing the Braille image format (by Samuel
      Thibault).
    * WebP writer: Support WebP 'use_sharp_yuv' option ("if needed, use
      sharp (and slow) RGB->YUV conversion") via `-define
      webp:use-sharp-yuv=true`.
    * The version command output now reports the OpenMP specification
      number rather than just the integer version identifier.
  API Updates:
    * ReallocateImageColormap() added to re-allocate an existing colormap.
    * Some improperly-exposed globals are now static as they should have
      been.
    * The 'benchmark' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed
      time indication.
    * The 'time' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed time
      indication.
    * The logging facility now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of time
      resolulution
    * Dcraw: When QuantumDepth is greater than 8, pass -6 option to dcraw
      so that it returns a 16-bit/sample image.
    * Dcraw: If Dcraw supports TIFF format, then request TIFF format in
      order to be able to acquire more metatdata.
    * Scale algorithm: Eliminate artifacts when scaling an image with
      semi-transparent pixels.
    * Library metrics: The number of shared library relocations and the
      amount of initialized data has been signficantly reduced by
      following recommendations from Ulrich Drepper's document `How To
      Write Shared Libraries <https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf>`_.

- update to 1.3.31:
  Special Issues:
  * Firmware and operating system updates to address the Spectre
    vulnerability (and possibly to some extent the Meltdown
    vulnerability) have substantially penalized GraphicsMagick's OpenMP
    performance.  Performance is reduced even with GCC 7 and 8's
    improved optimizers. There does not appear to be anything we can do
    about this.
  
  Security Fixes:
  * GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
    to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor.
 
  Bug fixes:
  * See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.
  * CINEON: Fix unexpected hang on a crafted Cineon image.  SourceForge
    issue 571.
  * Drawing recursion is limited to 100 and may be tuned via the
    MAX_DRAWIMAGE_RECURSION pre-processor definition.
  * Fix reading MIFF files using legacy keyword 'color-profile' for ICC
    color profile as was used by ImageMagick 4.2.9.
  * Fix reading/writing files when 'magick' is specified in lower case.
    This bug was a regression in 1.3.30.
  
  New Features:
  * TIFF: Support Zstd compression in TIFF.  This requires libtiff
    4.0.10 or later.
  * TIFF: Support WebP compression in TIFF.  This requires libtiff
    4.0.10 or later.

  API Updates:
  * MagickMonitor() is marked as deprecated.

Fri Aug  3 12:32:58 UTC 2018 - idonmez@suse.com

- update to 1.3.30:
  * Security Fixes:
    . GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
      to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
      2018, 238 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 230 of those
      issues have been resolved.  The issues list is available at
      https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list under search term
      "graphicsmagick".  Issues are available for anyone to view and
      duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
      they have been in "New" status for 90 days.  There are too many
      fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
      file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
      for details.
    . SVG/Rendering: Fix heap write overflow of PrimitiveInfo and
      PointInfo arrays.  This is another manefestation of CVE-2016-2317,
      which should finally be fixed correctly due to active
      detection/correction of pending overflow rather than using
      estimation.
  * Bug fixes:
    . Many oss-fuzz fixes are bug fixes.
    . Drawing/Rendering: Many more fixes by Gregory J Wolfe (see the ChangeLog).
    . MIFF: Detect end of file while reading image directory.
    . SVG: Many more fixes by Gregory J Wolfe (see the ChangeLog).
    . The AlphaCompositePixel macro was producing wrong results when the
      output alpha value was not 100% opaque. This is a regression
      introduced in 1.3.29.
    . TILE: Fix problem with tiling JPEG images because the size request
      used by the TILE algorithm was also causing re-scaling in the JPEG
      reader.  The problem is solved by stripping the size request before
      reading the image.

  * API Updates:
    . The size of PrimitiveInfo (believed to be an internal/private
      structure but in a header which is installed, has been increased to
      store a 'flags' argument. This is intended to be an internal
      interface but but may be detected as an ABI change.

  * Behavior Changes:
    . JPEG: The JPEG reader now allows 3 warnings of any particular type
      before giving up on reading and throwing an exception.  This choice
      was made after observing files which produce hundreds of warnings
      and consume massive amounts of memory before reading the image data
      has even started.  It is currently unknown how many files which were
      previously accepted will be rejected by default.  The number of
      allowed warnings may be adjusted using '-define
      jpeg:max-warnings=<value>'.  The default limit will be adjusted
      based on reported user experiences and may be adjusted prior to
      compilation via the MaxWarningCount definition in coders/jpeg.c.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 23 08:34:17 UTC 2018 - pgajdos@suse.com

- update to 1.3.29:
  * Security Fixes:
    . GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project 
    . JNG: Require that the embedded JPEG image have the same dimensions
      as the JNG image as provided by JHDR. Avoids a heap write overflow.
    . MNG: Arbitrarily limit the number of loops which may be requested by
      the MNG LOOP chunk to 512 loops, and provide the '-define
      mng:maximum-loops=value' option in case the user wants to change the
      limit.  This fixes a denial of service caused by large LOOP
      specifications.
  * Bug fixes:
    . DICOM: Pre/post rescale functions are temporarily disabled (until
      the implementation is fixed).
    . JPEG: Fix regression in last release in which reading some JPEG
      files produces the error "Improper call to JPEG library in state
      201".
    . ICON: Some DIB-based Windows ICON files were reported as corrupt to
      an unexpectedly missing opacity mask image.
    . In-memory Blob I/O: Don't implicitly increase the allocation size
      due to seek offsets.
    . MNG: Detect and handle failure to allocate global PLTE. Fix divide
      by zero.
    . DrawGetStrokeDashArray(): Check for failure to allocate memory.
    . BlobToImage(): Now produces useful exception reports to cover the
      cases where 'magick' was not set and the file format could not be
      deduced from its header.
  * API Updates:
    . Wand API: Added MagickIsPaletteImage(), MagickIsOpaqueImage(),
      MagickIsMonochromeImage(), MagickIsGrayImage(), MagickHasColormap()
      based on contributions by Troy Patteson.
    . New structure ImageExtra added and Image 'clip_mask' member is
      replaced by 'extra' which points to private ImageExtra allocation.
      The ImageGetClipMask() function now provides access to the clip mask
      image.
    . New structure DrawInfoExtra and DrawInfo 'clip_path' is replaced by
      'extra' which points to private DrawInfoExtra allocation.  The
      DrawInfoGetClipPath() function now provides access to the clip path.
    . New core library functions: GetImageCompositeMask(),
      CompositeMaskImage(), CompositePathImage(), SetImageCompositeMask(),
      ImageGetClipMask(), ImageGetCompositeMask(), DrawInfoGetClipPath(),
      DrawInfoGetCompositePath()
    . Deprecated core library functions: RegisterStaticModules(),
      UnregisterStaticModules().
  * Feature improvements:
    . Static modules (in static library or shared library without
      dynamically loadable modules) are now lazy-loaded using the same
      external interface as the lazy-loader for dynamic modules.  This
      results in more similarity between the builds and reduces the fixed
      initialization overhead by only initializing the modules which are
      used.
    . SVG: The quality of SVG support has been significantly improved due
      to the efforts of Greg Wolfe.
    . FreeType/TTF rendering: Rendering fixes for opacity.

Wed Jan 24 10:30:22 UTC 2018 - pgajdos@suse.com

- update to 1.3.28:
  * Security Fixes:
    BMP: Fix non-terminal loop due to unexpected bit-field mask 
      value (DOS opportunity).
    PALM: Fix heap buffer underflow in builds with QuantumDepth=8.
    SetNexus() Fix heap overwrite under certain conditions due to 
      using a wrong destination buffer. This issue impacts all 
      1.3.X releases.
    TIFF: Fix heap buffer read overflow in LocaleNCompare() when 
      parsing NEWS profile.
   * Bug fixes:
    DescribeImage(): Eliminate possible use of null pointer.
    GIF: Fix memory leak of global colormap in error path.
    GZ: Writing to gzip files with the extension ".gz" was 
      not working with Zlib 1.2.8.
    JNG: Fix buffer read overflow (a tiny fixed overflow of just
      one byte).
    JPEG: Promoting certain libjpeg warnings to errors caused 
      much more problems than expected. The promotion of 
      warnings to errors is removed. Claimed pixel dimensions 
      are validated by file size before allocating memory for
      the pixels.
    IntegralRotateImage(): Assure that reported error in rotate by 
      270 case does immediately terminate processing.
    MNG: Fix possible null pointer reference related to DEFI chunk
      parsing. Fix minor heap read overflow (constrained to just
      one byte) due to an ordering issue in a limit check. Fix
      memory leaks in error path.
    WebP: Fix stack buffer overflow in WriteWEBPImage() which
      occurs with libwebp 0.5.0 or newer due to a structure type
      change in the structure passed to the progress monitor
      callback.
    WPG: Memory leaks fixed.
  * API Updates:
    InterpolateViewColor(): This function now returns MagickPassFail
      (an unsigned int) rather than void so that errors can be
      efficiently reported.
    The magick/pixel_cache.h header is updated to add deprecation
       attributes such that code using GetPixels(), GetIndexes(),
       and GetOnePixel() will produce deprecation warnings for
       compilers which support them. These functions will not be
       removed in the 1.3.X release series and when they are
       removed, pre-processor macros will be added so a replacement
       function is used instead. There is a long-term objective to
       eliminate functionally-redundant pixel cache functions to
       only the ones with the best properties since this reduces
       maintenance and may reduce the depth of the call stack
       (improving performance).

    . Magick++ Image autoOrient(): New Image method to auto-orient an 
         image so it looks right-side up by default.
   * Behavior Changes:
    . PALM: PALM writer is disabled.
    . ThrowLoggedException(): Capture the first exception 
      at ErrorException level or greater, or only capture exception 
      if it is more severe than an already reported exception.
    . DestroyJNG(): This internal function is now declared static 
      and is removed from shared library or DLL namespace.
  * lot of security and other bug fixes, see

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 12 07:06:04 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.3.18:
  * Due to `GCC bug 53967`_, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
    may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
    enabled for floating point math (`-mfpmath=sse`) if the GCC option
    `-frename-registers` is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
    experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear
    in what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed
    by the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do
    not suffer from this bug.
  * Fixed bug with format substitutions if input string ends with a
    single '%'.
  * BMP: Fixed an old bug with decoding chromaticity primaries.
  * PNG: Fixed reading of interlaced images.  Fix reading of sub-8-bit
    palette and grayscale images.  Some PNG sub-formats were written
    incorrectly.  Fix crash in PNG8 writer if image colors happened to
    be non-zero but image was not actually colormapped.
  * PNG: Configure script now also searches for libpng versions 16 and
    17.
  * TIFF: Fix a crash which was noticed when writing RGBA separated
    (planar) format.
  * `--enable-symbol-prefix` was not prefixing all of the C
    symbols. Some core C library functions were not prefixed.  This
    option applies to the Wand library API as well now.
  * C API: When input is from a user-provided file descriptor, the
    file position is restored after reading the file header bytes.
    Previously the file position was rewound to the beginning of the
    file.  This allows reading embedded image data from the current
    offset in a file, and allows continuing to use the stream after
    GraphicsMagick has returned the image.
  * C API: It is now possible to invoke CloseBlob() multiple times.
  * etc. see NEWS.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 15 07:13:56 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.3.17:
  * PNG: Fix for CVE-2012-3438. The Magick_png_malloc function in
    coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 6.7.8-6 does not use the proper
    variable type for the allocation size, which might allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PNG
    file that triggers incorrect memory allocation.
  * PNG: Reading sub-8-bit palette images is fixed (images looked
    stretched).
  * SVG: Fixed bug which allowed MVG and SVG files with long vector
    paths to crash the software.
  * SVG: Ignore XML headers rather than rendering them as text.
  * MVG/SVG/WMF/-draw: It is now possible to draw a plain ','
    character.
  * etc., see NEWS.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 31 09:01:37 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

-  fixed PerlMagick/Makefile.PL.in [bnc#771540]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 25 08:29:04 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.3.16:
  Security Fixes:
  * Don't translate 'comment' and 'label' attributes if the request is
    made while a file is being read.  Only translate such attributes
    if they come from the command line or API user.
  Bug fixes:
  * SWT: SWT reader suffered from a number of implementation errors
         which caused it not to work any more.  Works again.
  * XBM: Fix memory leak observed when reading file in 'ping' mode.
  * Support -trim on images which use a consistent (single color)
    transparent background.  In this case, trim is done based on
    opacity rather than foreground color.
  * Include <sys/types.h> in order to assure that 'size_t' and
    'ssize_t' are declared.  This is necessary since
    MagickExtentImage() uses these types as part of its definition.
  * +repage was not working because parser was insisting that it
    should include an argument.
     (i.e. multiplying rather than dividing).
  * PerlMagick: Fix compilation with Perl 5.16.
  * PingBlob(): PingBlob was not working for all cases.  Is now based
    on BlobToImage() for assured reliability.
  Feature improvements:
  * MAT: Animated movies inside 4D matrices are loaded now.
  * PDF: File base name is used as the document title.
  * PNG: Fix issues observed specifically with libpng 1.5.10.
  Performance Improvements:
  * Pixel iterators should be more efficient now if the image uses a
    file-backed cache.
  * Motion blur algorithm does scale well as cores are added so
    include OpenMP support for it by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  4 08:50:13 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- added PerlMagick/typemap to build module with perl 5.16; to be
  removed for 1.4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  2 08:59:10 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.3.15:
  Bug fixes:
  * PNG - fixed problem with bit depth when the encoder decides to
    write RGBA instead of indexed PNG.
  * Fixed some temporary file leaks which were caused by the temporary
    file name being automatically extended to include a scene number,
    and therefore fail to be deleted.
  New Features:
  * Added '+noise random' and '-operator noise-random' to 'convert'
    and 'mogrify'.  This modulates the existing image data with
    uniformely random noise.
  * Added -strip option in composite, convert, mogrify, and montage to
    remove all profiles and text attributes from the image.
  * Added -repage option to composite, convert, mogrify, and montage
    subcommands to reset or adjust the current image page offsets
    based on a provided geometry specification.
  * New C function StripImage() to remove all profiles and text
    attributes from the image.
  * New C function ResetImagePage() to adjust the current image page
    canvas and position based on a relative page specification.
  * C functions GenerateDifferentialNoise(), AddNoiseImageChannel(),
    QuantumOperatorRegionImage(), AddNoiseImage() updated to support
    RandomNoise enumeration.
  * New C++ Image method strip(), and unary function stripImage() to
    remove all profiles and text attributes from the image.
  * XCF format now respects image subimage and subrange members so
    that returned image layers may be selected.
  * The INFO coder (e.g. output file "info:-") now respects the
    -format option so that its output may be adjusted identically to
    how -format works for 'identify'.
  * TclMagick now supports Random noise.
  Feature improvements:
  * C function ThumbnailImage() now allows the user to override the
    filter used, but still defaults to using the box filter.
  Behavior Changes:
  * No longer add a printf-style scene formatting specification to
    filenames which do not have one and no longer automatically
    operate in 'adjoin' mode in such cases.  If multiple numbered
    files are intended to be output, then add +adjoin to the command
    line and use an output filename specification similar to
    "image-%d.jpg".  Output files are now completely specified and
    predictable but this may break some existing usages which
    anticipate the automatic file numbering.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 27 08:05:20 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.3.14:
  Bug fixes:
  * TGA format: Assume that 32-bit TGA files have an alpha channel,
    even if they are not marked as such.
  * XCF format: Fix reading XCF which is comprised of different sized
    layers.
  * JPEG & CineonLog: Convert RGB-compatible colorspaces
    (e.g. CineonLog) to RGB by default since that was the case prior
    to release 1.3.13.
  * RAW formats: Small memory leak in dcraw module was fixed.
  * Resize: ResizeImage() was ignoring its resize filter argument and
    was using the filter setting from the Image structure instead.
  * The mirror virtual pixel method was broken.
  New Features:
  * Open64 Compiler Suite: Version 5.0 is fully supported.
  * Wand API: Added MagickExtentImage().
  * MEF RAW: Mamiya Photo RAW "MEF" format is now supported.
  Feature improvements:
  * DPX format: Original file endianness is preserved by default.
  Performance Improvements:
  * Despeckle algorithm (-despeckle) is many times faster.
  Behavior Changes:
  * DPX format: Original file endianness is preserved by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 27 09:30:07 UTC 2011 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.3.13:
  * In I/O blob, don't rewind already open file handle passed to
    OpenBlob() since we don't know the intended state of this file
    handle, and because it prevents appending to an existing file.
  * In AppendImageProfile(), don't leak profile buffer while appending
    a chunk to an existing profile.
  * Fix deadlock in ClonePixelCache() which was caused by using the
    same semaphore pointer in the source and destination images.
  * etc. see NEWS.txt
- disabled perl.patch

- added xorg-x11-fonts as runtime dependency [bnc#619103]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  9 08:59:09 CET 2010 - pgajdos@suse.cz

- updated to version 1.3.12:
  * Filter mode (write to stdout) was completely broken.
  * Should now compile with libpng 1.4.
  * DCX output format is only written on request.  Previously the PCX
    coder would automatically switch to DCX format if multiple frames
    would be written.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 23 09:44:42 CET 2010 - pgajdos@suse.cz

- updated to version 1.3.11:
  * Fixed array underflow on systems using signed char 
    which could result in a program crash due to extended 
    characters in filenames or in certain file formats.
  * Fixed array underflow on systems using signed char 
    which could result in a program crash due to extended 
    characters in filenames or in certain file formats.
  * Added a -thumbnail command to 'convert' and 'mogrify'. 
    This is a faster way to scale down the image when 
    speed is a primary concern.
  * Added a -extent command to 'convert' and 'mogrify' 
    which composites the image on top of a backing 
    canvas image of solid color.
  * Added support for -compose to the 'convert' and 
    'mogrify', which were documented to support it 
    (but did not).
  * Requests for 'Over' and 'Atop' composition are 
    converted to a request for the (faster) 'Copy' 
    composition when both images are opaque.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 15 11:05:19 CET 2010 - pgajdos@suse.cz

- updated to version 1.3.10:
  * +adjoin was not working correctly for the case when only one image
    frame is present.  With +adjoin and writing one frame to
    "foo%d.jpg" it was outputting "foo%d.jpg" rather than "foo0.jpg".

  * When drawing paths, memory allocation for the points was much
    larger than it needed to be (patch by Vladimir Lukianov).

 * To reiterate the change which first appeared in 1.3.9, there is no
    longer an implicit +adjoin if the output file name happens to
    contain a %d sequence, or there are multiple frames and the output
    file format only supports storing one frame.  Specify +adjoin if
    scene number substition is desired in the output file names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 10:22:54 CET 2010 - pgajdos@suse.cz

- updated to version 1.3.9:
  * There is no longer an implicit 'adjoin' if an output filename
    contains an apparent scene specification (e.g. foo%02d.tiff) and
    multiple files are not needed to save the image..  It is necessary
    to use +adjoin.  For example ``gm convert foo.pdf +adjoin
    %02d.tiff``.

  * For formats which support multiple frames, output with +adjoing to
    filenames containing a scene specification (e.g. foo%02d.tiff) was
    resulting in wrong output file names.

  * -flatten now applies the image background color under the first
    image in the list if it is not already opaque.

  * Fix "double free" error when using gm import -frame.

  * XPM does not support RGBA color syntax, so return RGB instead.

  * The display '-update' option was only working in conjunction with
    the '-delay' option with a delay setting of 2 or greater.

  * -convolve was crashing rather than reporting an error.

  * Fixed crash if the number of OpenMP threads was reduced from the
    original value via '-limit threads' or omp_set_num_threads().

  * -blur was not blurring the opacity channel for solid-color images.

  * Several deleted global string constants are restored with
    deprecated status in order to assure that symbols are not removed
    from the ABI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 25 10:16:57 CET 2010 - pgajdos@suse.cz

- updated to version 1.3.8:

Security Fixes:

  * Fix for CVE-2009-1882 "Integer overflow in the XMakeImage
    function".

  * Fix lockup due to hanging in loop while parsing malformed
    sub-image specification (SourceForge issue 2886560).

  * Libltdl: Updated libtool to 2.2.6b in order to fix security issue.
    Resolves CVE-2009-3736 as it pertains to GraphicsMagick.

Bug fixes:

  * -convolve, -recolor: Validate that user-provided matrix is square
    when parsing -convolve and -recolor commands in order to avoid a
    core dump.

  * CALS: Reading images taller than the image width resulted in a
    failure.

  * ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
    transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity.  Behavior was
    inconsistent.  In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
    cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
    getting enabled in the image as it should.

  * DCRAW: Module name was not registered so modules based builds were
    not supporting formats provided via 'dcraw'.

  * GetOptimalKernelWidth1D(), GetOptimalKernelWidth2D(): In the Q32
    build, convolution kernel size was estimated incorrectly for large
    sigmas on 32-bit systems due to arithmetic overflow.  This could
    cause wrong results for -convolve, -blur, -sharpen, and other
    algorithms which use these functions.

etc., see NEWS.txt
