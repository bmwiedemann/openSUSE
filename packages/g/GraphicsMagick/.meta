andtranslation utility. It is capable of displaying still images and
animations using the X Window system which provides a simple interface
forinteractively editing images, and is capable of importing selected
windows or the entire desktop. GraphicsMagick is one of your choices if
you need a program to manipulate and display images.It can read and
write over 88 image formats, including JPEG, TIFF, WMF, SVG, PNG, PNM,
GIF, andPhoto CD. Besides it allows you to resize, rotate, sharpen,
color reduce, or add special effects to an image and to save the result
to any supported format. GraphicsMagick may be used to create animated
or transparent .gifs, to composite images, to create thumbnail images
and a lot more. If you want to develop your own applications which use
GraphicsMagick code or APIs, you need to install GraphicsMagick-devel
as well.

This package is compiled with Q8, which means that it provides better
performance on 8 bit images and less.</description>
