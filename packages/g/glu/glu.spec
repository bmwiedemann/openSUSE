%description
GLU offers simple interfaces for building mipmaps; checking for the
presence of extensions in the OpenGL (or other libraries which follow
the same conventions for advertising extensions); drawing
piecewise-linear curves, NURBS, quadrics and other primitives
(including, but not limited to, teapots); tesselating surfaces;
setting up projection matrices and unprojecting screen coordinates to
world coordinates.

This package provides the SGI implementation of GLU previously shipped
with Mesa, but meanwhile developed separately.
