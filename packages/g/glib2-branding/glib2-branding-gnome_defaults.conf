# GNOME Default Applications Source
# /etc/gnome-defaults.conf
#
# After any change of this file run
# suse-update-mime-defaults
#
# This list is a source for defaults.list.
#
# If application in this list is installed, it is used as default in GNOME.
# It works in following way:
# 1. Read this file.
# 2. Collect all available desktop files.
# 3. Go through all declared MIME types and search for default application
#    for defaults.list in following order:
# 3.1 Installed application listed here for certain MIME type.
# 3.2 Installed application listed here as preferred default.
# 3.3 Installed application listed here as default.
# 3.4 Installed application with GNOME in Categories.
# 3.5 Installed application with GTK in Categories.
# 3.6 Installed application.
# If there are more applications in the same order, it uses pseudo-randomly
# one of them (last in aplhabetical order).
#
# Syntax:
# Use xxx as default for all MIME types it declares (see 3.3):
# xxx.desktop
# Use xxx as preferred default for all MIME types it declares (see 3.2):
# !xxx.desktop
# Use xxx as default for mime/type (see 3.1):
# mime/type=xxx.desktop
