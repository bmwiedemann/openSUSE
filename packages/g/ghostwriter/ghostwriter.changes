-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 8 22:18:35 UTC 2018 - seb95.scou@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.6.0
   * HTML live preview is now in a split pane view rather than in a
   separate window.
   * New options were added to hide HUD windows while typing, in full
   screen mode, or in live preview mode.
   * A new button was added to the status bar and a new shortcut was
   added to the View menu in the menu bar to toggle hiding/showing the
   open HUDs.
   * Github's cmark-gfm can now be detected and used as a Markdown
   processor.
   * Block quotes and code blocks now have an inobtrusive background
   color to differentiate them.
   * Buttons have been added to the status for existing features.
   * HUD windows and scrollbars can be stylized to have square or
   rounded corners in the Settings, and are no longer theme dependent.
   * New "Typewriter" focus mode was added by @hirschenberger.
   * The style sheet and Markdown processor to use with the HTML live
   preview can now be selected in their own dialog box accessible both
   from the status bar at the bottom of the window and from the menu bar
   in the Settings menu.
   * The "Copy HTML" button has been moved to the "status bar" at the
   bottom of the main window.
   * The "Copy HTML" button / menu bar option can copy just the selected
   Markdown text as HTML (using the currently selected Markdown
   processor). It will still copy the entire Markdown text document and
   convert it to HTML in the system clipboard if no text is selected.
   * Themes now support options for emphasis color and block text color.
   Note that emphasis color will also affect the color of headings, and
   block text color will affect the color of block quotes and code blocks.
   * Issue #302: ghostwriter will now look for default Qt 
   translations on the standard Qt translations path 
   (for standard buttons/text). These default Qt translations 
   have been included in the Windows installer translations 
   folder and portable Windows Zip, and will be loaded automatically
   based on the currently selected application language.
   * Some tweaks have been made to the parsing/highlighting of
   emphasized text to handle nested emphasis cases better. As part
   of this effort, ghostwriter uses a Qt 5-specific regular
   expression class that is not available in Qt 4. As such,
   ghostwriter can no longer be built with Qt and must be built with
   Qt 5.
   * Issue #272: Fixed issue with Focus mode where inserting
   matching characters around a selection was causing the application
   to crash.
   * Issue #260: Added compatability with Pandoc version 2 and
   MultiMarkdown version 6.
   * Fixed issue where HTML preview scrolls to the top if the new
   HTML from a modified document matches the old HTML, even if the
   markup used in the source document did change.
   * Fixed issue where current word is not live spell checked if the
   user switches the text cursor to a different line.
   * Fixed issue where prompt to reload a file that has been modified
   externally was being displayed multiple times per file change. This
   seems to have been triggered by some editors like Sublime Text that
   perform multiple file saves for a single file modification.
   * Issue #228: Selected text can now be dragged and dropped to a
   different location within the editor.
   * Fixed issue where if setext heading markup line is selected and
   deleted with the cursor position beginning at the end of the previous
   line, the heading is not removed from the Outline HUD.
   * Fixed issue where Preview HTML menu item and button were not in
   sync to appear checked or unchecked.
   * ghostwriter now clears the Outline HUD when loading or reloading
   a document to prevent a crash in case bad data is in the HUD.
   * Fixed copy HTML issue to ensure Markdown text has proper formatting
   (i.e., greater than signs aren't converted to &gt;).
   * ghostwriter will now search in the mozilla-dicts installation
   location for dictionaries on OpenBSD.

  * HUD windows can now be closed using the Esc key when they have
    focus.
  * A new option has been added to highlight double spaces at the
    end of a line.
  * Github-style task lists can now be made using the * and +
    bullet point characters, in addition to the - character.
  * Support for ConTeXt and wkhtmltopdf when exporting to PDF with
    Pandoc has been added.
  * Auto-matching characters for selected text now respects the
    existing preferences for the matching done while typing without
    text selected.
  * Typing a single quote (') will no longer result in a second
    quote being automatically inserted after the cursor if the
    cursor is positioned in the middle of a word.
  * Most settings have been moved into a new Preferences dialog to
    accommodate the ever increasing number of application options.
  * Font size can now be increased by pressing Ctrl+=or decreased
    by pressing Ctrl+-. It can also be changed by using Ctrl and
    the mouse wheel.
  * When exporting to other file formats, the output file will be
    opened after export with its default application.
  * E-books created using Pandoc will now also be generated with a
    table of contents.
  * When passing in a file path via the command line, a new file
    will be created with that path if it does not already exist.
  * When typing a * character, ghostwriter would auto-insert a
    second '*' character in anticipation of emphasized text. The
    auto-inserted second * will now be removed if a space is typed
    to accommodate a bullet list instead.
  * Rudimentary support for HiDPI has been added. See notes below.
  * Various performance enhancements and tweaks have been made
    under the hood.
  * Hyphenated words are now considered one word for spell checking
  * ghostwriter can now be built from its source tarball without
    needing git to be installed.
  * Linux desktop file now specifies that ghostwriter can open only
    one file from the command line rather than multiple files.
  * Ctrl+M now opens the HTML Preview instead of Ctrl+W. This is to
    avoid a conflict with closing windows in Linux.
  * Copy and paste no longer makes the word count jump.
  * Sundry minor fixes have been added.
