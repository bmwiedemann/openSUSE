%description
The Polenta package provides methods to compute polycyclic
presentations of matrix groups (finite or infinite). As a by-product,
this package gives some functionality to compute certain module
series for modules of solvable groups. For example, if G is a
rational polycyclic matrix group, then we can compute the radical
series of the natural Q[G]-module Q^d.
