%description
Derive Template Haskell's 'Lift' class for datatypes using 'TemplateHaskell'.
The functionality in this package has largely been subsumed by the 'DeriveLift'
language extension, which is available in GHC 8.0 and later versions.
This package can still be useful as a uniform way to derive 'Lift' instances
that is backwards-compatible with older GHCs.

The following libraries are related:

* The <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-orphans th-orphans> package
provides instances for 'template-haskell' syntax types.

* The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift-instances th-lift-instances>
package provides 'Lift' instances for types in 'base', 'text', 'bytestring',
'vector', etc. Some of these instances are only provided for old versions of
their respective libraries, as the same 'Lift' instances are also present
upstream on newer versions.
