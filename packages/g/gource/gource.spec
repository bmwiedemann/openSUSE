%description
Gource is a software version control visualization tool.

Software projects are displayed by Gource as an animated tree
with the root directory of the project at its centre. Directories
appear as branches with files as leaves. Developers can be seen
working on the tree at the times they contributed to the project.

Currently there is first party support for Git and Mercurial,
and third party (using additional steps) for CVS and SVN.
