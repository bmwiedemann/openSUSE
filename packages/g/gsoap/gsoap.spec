%description
gSOAP is a toolkit for C and C++ server and client Web service
applications, and is responsible for e.g. HTTP request handling and
the serialization of XML. It supports SOAP 1.1/1.2 RPC encoding and
document/literal styles, WSDL 1.1, MTOM/MIME/DIME attachments
(streaming), SOAP-over-UDP, request-response and one-way messaging.
It also supports WS-Addressing and WS-Security.
