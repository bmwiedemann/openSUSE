  + Other bugs fixes.
- Drop geoclue2-geoip-when-wifi-unavailable.patch: fixed upstream.
- Minor tweaks to rpmlintrc file: systemd_service changed from
  warnings to error (but still don't apply here, as it's a dbus
  enabled service).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 20 19:25:46 UTC 2022 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Remove unnecessary shadow requires

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  [glfo#geoclue/geoclue#142].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 31 13:10:06 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.5.7:
  + A bug fix release, mainly fixing a bunch of memory leaks.
- Add geoclue2-revert-2-faulty.patch: Revert two broken commits.
  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/geoclue/geoclue/-/issues/142

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 13 13:01:31 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.5.6:
  + Fix crashes in WiFi handling code.
  + Plug a leak.
- Changes from version 2.5.5:
  + Plug another leak.
  + Fix another buffer overflow.
  + Fix WiFi-geolocation that got broken in 2.5.4.
  + Put freequently used small strings on the stack to avoid
    excessive memory usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 10 20:11:13 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.5.2:
  + Scan for WiFi networks, greatly improving accuracy of WiFi
    source.
  + Allow multiple clients on the same D-Bus connection and add API
    for it. This is mainly targetted for Flatpak location portal.
  + Add API for apps to explicitly delete their client objects.
    Long running apps, like gnome-settings-daemon and Flatpak
    location portal, should use that to ensure Geoclue knows when
    these apps are not actually using it and hence it doesn't need
    to keep running needlessly.
  + Restore accidently removed, build of modem sources.
  + Update location on connectivity actually changing.
  + Try not spamming Mozilla Location Service.
  + Fix unexpected exit when non-active clients are connected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 26 18:21:54 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.4.11:
  + Don't crash on invalid accuracy level request.
  + The demo agent now watches for geoclue on D-Bus if it's not
    running already, instead of giving up. This solves a
    race-condition, which makes geoclue completely unusable.
  + Provide Vala bindings for libgeoclue.
  + Add gclue_client_get/set_time_threshold() to docs.
- Drop geoclue2-Fix-safety-header-name.patch and
  geoclue2-Fix-potentially-unused-variable.patch: Fixed upstream.
- Add vala BuildRequires: New optional dependency, build vala
  bindings.
- No longer nuke during build geoclue-demo-agent.desktop files,
  upstream wants us to package them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  8 17:25:54 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Add geoclue2-Fix-safety-header-name.patch: public-api: Fix safety
  header name. It should be based on the filename.
- Add geoclue2-Fix-potentially-unused-variable.patch: locator: Fix
  a potentially unused variable declaration.
- Add geoclue2-Fix-duplicate-decl-specifier.patch:Fix compiler
  warning about duplicate decl specifier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 18:24:46 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.4.10:
  + Fix issues introduced by last release 2.4.9:
    - A crash on startup.
    - Revert the new desktop ID detection code as that turned out
      to not work for non-root user that geoclue is supposed to be
      run as.
  + Use systemd's service file to lockdown the geoclue daemon to
    stop eventual security problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  2 23:24:52 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.4.9:
  + Modem GPS refresh rate is now based on the location refresh
    rate of apps.
  + Refuse location access if no app-auth agent is registered. This
    fixes a security hole where an app requests location access
    before the agent gets to register itself and we end up giving
    out location access even though user has disabled it.
  + Port desktop ID detection to Flatpak >= 0.6.10.
  + The default timeout on the service binary is now the same as
    the service itself: 5 seconds.
  + Demo applications:
    - where-am-i now allows setting location refresh-rate.
    - Only install demo agent's desktop file if it's enabled.
    - Build and install demo agent unless disabled explicitly.
    - Autostart the demo agent by default on non-GNOME platforms,
      since an agent is required now and no one other than GNOME
      yet provides one.
- Add pkgconfig(libnotify) BuildRequires: New dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 12 16:27:52 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.4.8:
  + Fix threshold for detecting too old location update.
  + Explain in the configuration what the applications white-list
    is meant for.
  + Allow instant location updates from modem-based GPS.
  + Fix a deadlock case in the helper library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 29 14:38:56 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.4.7:
  + Fix a potential crash.
  + More verbose warning on invalid accuracy from NMEA source.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  7 09:31:06 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Drop practically empty %pre section (because of the shell comment,
  it was non empty and would needlessy spawn /bin/sh).
- RPM group corrections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 28 18:40:11 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.4.6:
  + Add to white-list:
    - gnome-color-panel for "Night Light" functionality.
    - gnome-shell for new weather view in the calendar.
  + Other minor fixes.
- Drop geoclue2-permit-Night-Light.patch: Fixed upstream.
- Drop geoclue2-permit-gnome-maps.patch: No longer needed due to
  changes in location settings in gnome.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 15 20:19:10 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Split out new package system-user-srvGeoClue: create a user that
  can be required by different package (e.g. NetworkManager has a
  rule based on the user account. With the user created separately,
  NM can now require the user even without geoclue2 being
  installed).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  1 16:05:18 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add geoclue2-permit-Night-Light.patch: Add "Night Light"
  functionality to the whitelist (bgo#779343, fdo#100008).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 21:21:10 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Drop convenience shortcut for rcgeoclue, as this is a dbus
  activated service, there is no point in that shortcut, no human
  should ever manually call it. Following this, filter warning now
  produced via rpmlintrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 16:26:11 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.4.4:
  + Fix a potential crash.

  + Expose location timestamp over D-Bus.
  + Add a TimeThreshold property that allows clients to limit
    location updates by time.
  + Annotate default value of DistanceThreshold property.
  + Check for full internet availability before declaring ourselves
    online (boo#1051612, fdo#95493).
  + Fix autogen.sh against builddir ≠ srcdir.
  + Fix a bunch of memory leaks.
  + Fix a bunch of build issues.
  + Other minor fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 30 15:48:31 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add geoclue2-rpmlintrc to sources to filter out bogus rpmlint
  warning about missing systemd-service and nonstandard user.
- Add missing post/postun handling of library.
- Remove useless desktop file for demos, we do not build the demos.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 30 13:00:24 UTC 2016 - fcrozat@suse.com

- Do not use systemd macros for geoclue2.service, they are not
  designed for dbus systemd unit file [bsc#982216].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 13 09:27:42 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to GNOME 3.20  Fate#318572

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  3 13:39:24 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.4.3:
  + Fix a crash in the helper library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 27 17:43:18 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.4.2:
  + Reliable desktop ID detection for xdg-app. This together with
    latest gnome-shell and gnome-control-center, allows for
    per-application geolocation access controls.
  + Don't require xdg-app applications to pass a valid desktop ID
    since Geoclue can automatically detect it.
  + Don't allow xdg-app application to become user-authorization
    agents.
  + Correct introspection namespace version for libgeoclue.
  + Option to disable the backend build.
  + Demo: Provide reason to access location data.
  + Demo agent:
    - Critical log message on failing to show notification.
    - If app provides a reason string in it's desktop file, show
      that to the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 23 15:05:56 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Enable GObject introspection (required by gnome-weather 3.19+):
  + Pass --enable-introspection to configure.
  + Add pkgconfig(gobject-introspection-1.0) BuildRequires.
  + Split typelib-1_0-Geoclue-2_0 subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 24 02:08:50 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.4.0:
  + Add a convenience library to make interacting with Geoclue very
    easy.
  + Put each D-Bus interface description in it's own file. Unified
    interface file still provided for backwards compatibility.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 21:32:00 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Correct geoclue2-permit-gnome-maps.patch to include system=false,
  all services are supposed to have a system section. Fixes
  (boo#953865).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 15:35:11 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 2.3.0
  * Add a network NMEA source, which together with this application:
    https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/GeoclueShare allows you to use the
    GPS of your Android device on your geoclue-enabled machine.
  * Allow root to own the name on the bus, i-e run the service.
  * Make use of compass device if available, through iio-proxy.
  * Fix a hang on client starting twice.
  * More helpful error on agent rejection.
  * Improved documentation.
  * Do not ship generated D-Bus service files in the tarball.
  * Only allow the geoclue user and root to call methods on agents.
  * Fix ignoring of valid location updates due to comparison of
    stances in different units.
  * Correctly handle two consecutive location updates with same
    mestamp on them.
  * Correctly handle late location update.
  * Build system fixes:
    + Fix detection of gdbus-codegen tool.
    + Workaround an intltool issue.
- Update dependencies
- Make build more verbose

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 11 21:00:40 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.2.0:
  + Report 'Speed' and 'Heading' on location updates.
  + Try to provide the most accurate location first.
  + Avoid a crash by ensuring requested max accuracy is within
    bounds.
  + Fix GPS coordinates parsing.
  + Fix GeoIP on machines without WiFi hardware.
  + Gracefully handle inexistent agent.
  + Stop sources whose accuracy level becomes higher, rather than
    lower, than the requested level.
  + Keep old location object alive on D-Bus for a bit longer to
    ensure applications are not accessing it still after it is
    destroyed.
  + Don't enable the modem. Seems at least GNOME takes care of
    modem enabling for us and besides this shouldn't be done by
    geoclue anyway (fdo#85040).
  + Wait for modem to be enabled before checking availability of
    location capabilities and using them. This is particularly
    important for pin-enabled modems.
  + Ignore redundant GPS location updates.
  + Fix some potential crashes.
  + Some improvements to output of where-am-i demo application.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 12 20:11:11 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Cleanup spec file with spec-cleaner
- Update dependencies
- Do not try to remove .la files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  4 09:04:06 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.10:
  + Disallow application if disabled explicitly in the
    configuration.
  + Make it easy to add alternative modem source(s), e.g
    ofono-based.
  + Map:
    - country-level accuracy to city-level since no source provides
      country-level accuracy.
    - neighborhood-level accuracy to city-level in WiFi source
      (only) so applications requesting neighborhood-level accuracy
      still get a location even if there is no modem available.
  + Fixes to WiFi source.
  + For easier debugging, add:
    - more debug prints.
    - commandline options to where-am-i demo application to specify
      timeout and requested accuracy level.
  + Fix a potential build failure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  7 19:41:32 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.9:
  + Move from NetworkManager to direct use of wpa_supplicant to
    retreive WiFI data, for greater portability.
  + Port from opencellid.org to Mozilla Location Service for
    3G-geolocation.
  + Network data submission
    - Explicit option in config to enable submission.
    - Commandline options to enable network data submission and set
      nickname.
    - Submit 3G data.
    - Submit under 'geoclue' nick by default.
  + Fix a few crashes.
  + Drop now redundant workaround for pure geoip queries.
  + Ability to mark an app as system component in the config so
    that:
    - Agent can't decide its accuracy level nor agent is asked to
      authorize it. This mean automatic timezone in GNOME will
      continue working even if you disable geolocation.
    - App is not taken into account for 'InUse' property. That
      means you will no longer have to see location crosshair in
      gnome-shell's topbar forever just because you have automatic
      timezone enabled.
  + Exit demo app if geoclue deactivates it.
  + Improved debug log.
  + Many other internal changes and minor improvements.
- Changes from version 2.1.8:
  + Switch to Mozilla Location Service for geoip as well.
  + Allow specifying nickname to submit network data with.
  + Report actual available accuracy level and keep it up2date.
  + Add 'Active' property to indicate client state.
  + Expose altitude info (if known).
  + Timeout on inactivity, rather than no clients.
  + Automatically:
    - stop the client if max accuracy level is set to 0.
    - start the client if max accuracy level is set to non-0 and it
      was automatically stopped.
  + Don't disable modem after using it. Disabling the modem,
    disables it for everyone so if there was an active connection
    going on through the modem, geoclue will cause it to
    disconnect. While we need to have some centralized means to
    enable/disable modem and ideally geoclue shouldn't do any
    enabling/disabling of modems at all, for now lets just only
    enable the modem.
  + Fix issue of missed location updates.
  + Whitelist correct ID for gnome-settings-daemon in default
    config.
  + Replace '--disable-wifi-source' configure option with
    '--disable-network-manager'. i-e now you disable usage of
    NetworkManger explicitly rather than wifi source, which is now
    always built and enabled.
  + Drop now redundant geoip server.
  + Don't distribute .desktop.in files for demos.
  + Plug some leaks.
  + More debug log.
  + Other minor fixes.
- Changes from version 2.1.7:
  + 'InUse' property now only affected by active clients. This
    fixes the issue of gnome-shell incorrectly showing 'geolocation
    in use' icon.
  + Move DBus interface files to their canonical location:
    /usr/share/dbus-1/interfaces/.
  + Drop redundant check for the C++ compiler in configure script.
  + Demo agent now prints 'geolocation in use' info.
- Drop pkgconfig(libnm-glib) and pkgconfig(libxml-2.0)
  BuildRequires: no longer needed.
- Add geoclue2-permit-gnome-maps.patch: Allow gnome-maps to access
  geoclue.
- Also drop the invalid rpmlintrc variant geoclue2.rpmlintrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  5 14:11:08 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Actually drop the rpmlintrc: the dbus service has been
  authorized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  4 19:16:19 UTC 2014 - adrian@suse.de

- use addFilter instead of setBadness

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 13 20:52:19 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.6:
  + Correct binary path is demo's desktop file.
  + Move demo apps from /usr/share to /usr/libexec.
- Changes from version 2.1.5:
  + Add a NULL check to fix a crasher.
  + Setup D-Bus policy to be able to access NetworManager API.
  + Expected agent object path now static. This breaks agent
    interface but it was needed to fix the D-Bus policy.
  + Fix issue of us giving every connection access to every
    property on the system bus.
- Changes from version 2.1.4:
  + Don't depend on unreleased libnm-glib.
- No longer use sed to lower libnm-glib requirement, fixed
  upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 23 06:34:19 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add pkgconfig(systemd) BuildRequires and add relevant
  systemdmacros to pre/post/preun/postun.
- Create softlink /usr/sbin/rcgeoclue to /usr/sbin/service.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 21 11:59:35 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.3:
  + Agents can now dictate maximum accuracy level allowed for all
    clients through a D-Bus property. The next version of
    gnome-shell will make use of that and provide an option to
    enable/disable geolocation in topbar menu.
  + Add D-Bus property to specify available accuracy level. For now
    we just hardcode it to report that we can provide exact
    accuracy.
  + Give agents time to register themselves on startup before
    processing client requests.
  + Move configuration file under geoclue subdir so that in future
    we can easily add more configuration files if needed.
  + Fixes to build.
  + Some internal clean-ups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  4 18:44:50 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.2:
  + Fix some crashing bugs.
  + Ignore WiFis with '_nomap' suffix.
  + Configure options for disabling WiFi, 3G and GPS modem sources.
  + Avoid spaming the network resources for ignorable changes to
    network setup.
  + Add some required files to distribution that we forgot in last
    release.
- Changes from version 2.1.1:
  + 3GPP-based geolocation source.
  + Uses ModemManager to get cell tower info from 3GPP modem and
    uses opencellid.org's public API to translate that into a
    location.
  + GPS modem-based geolocation source: If your 3GPP modem has a
    GPS, geoclue can now make use of it.
  + WiFi-based geolocation source.
  + Uses Mozilla Location Service to find location based on nearby
    WiFi networks.
  + Refresh location on changes in WiFi networks.
  + Option in configuration file to make geoclue use Google Maps
    Geolocation API rather than Mozilla Location Service.
  + Option in configuration file to enable submission of wifi data
    to Mozilla Location Service. If this option is enabled, the
    data is submitted each time geoclue gets a GPS lock. That
    means, its not completely autonomous and data is only
    submitted if an application, e.g gnome-maps requests current
    location with exact accuracy.
  + API for clients to specify what level of geolocation accuracy
    they need, e.g city-level, street-level or exact etc.
  + API to check if geolocation service is in use. Next version of
    gnome-shell will make use of that to show an icon in the panel
    to indicate to user that their location is being accessed.
  + Application authorization agent.
  + Make agent completely optional. We will revert this once we
    have a reliable mechanism to identify applications.
  + Identify agent and client applications by their desktop IDs
    rather than paths of their binaries.
  + Ability for agents to dictate the accuracy level allowed for
    clients.
  + Maintain a whitelist of clients in configuration that do not
    need agent authorization.
  + Avoid redundant queries to web services.
  + Install demo applications and provide a desktop file for them.
  + Many more internal fixes and clean-ups.
- Add pkgconfig(libnm-glib), pkgconfig(mm-glib) and
  pkgconfig(libxml-2.0) BuildRequires: new dependencies.
- Lower NetworkManager dependency to 0.9.8 in configure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 19 10:44:30 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.0:
  + Application authentication agents support:
    - API for agents to register themselves.
    - API that agents need to implement.
    - Configure option to enable requirement of authorization from
      agent. Until there is at least one agent out there, this
      requirement is disabled by default.
    - A demo agent.
    - Option in ${sysconfdir}/geoclue.conf containing whitelist of
      all our agents.
  + Don't use proxy. Seems proxy settings are per-user and system
    users (which geoclue is supposed to run as) do not have access
    to them.
  + Add support for bus-activation via systemd service unit.
  + Add mandatory 'DesktopId' property to Client interface.
  + Use HTTPS to connect to geoip.fedoraproject.org. The actual
    resource is behind HTTPS so using HTTP leads to redirections
    and thefore redundant TCP packets.
  + Fixes to build system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  9 08:58:12 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Do not package the D-Bus service for now. This makes the package
  'broken', but allows us to build against the D-Bus interface and
  not block inclusion of other packages any furhter (bnc#838360).

  + Fix some compiler warnings.
- Changes from version 1.99.2:
  + Drop client-side library.

  + Add/update forgotten copyright headers.
- Changes from version 1.99.1:
