%description
The GPars framework offers Java developers intuitive and safe ways to
handle Java or Groovy tasks concurrently. Leveraging the enormous
flexibility of the Groovy programming language and building on proven
Java technologies, we aim to make concurrent programming for
multi-core hardware intuitive, robust and enjoyable.

GPars is a multi-paradigm concurrency framework, offering several
mutually cooperating high-level concurrency abstractions, such as
Dataflow operators, Promises, CSP, Actors, Asynchronous Functions,
Agents and Parallel Collections.
