- Update to release 2.16
  * Add support for random sources to Random method for pcp-groups.
  * Documented IsPcpGroup and IsPcpElementCollection.
  * Increased rank for IsomorphismPcGroup and IsomorphismFpGroup
    methods for pcp-groups, to ensure they are still used when
    all GAP packages are loaded.
  * Fix a bug in `NormalIntersection` which could lead to wrong
    results; this also affected other operations, such `Core`,
    `Intersection`.
  * Fix `PreImagesRepresentative` for trivial homomorphisms (it
    used to return the identity fo the source as preimage for all
    elements in the range, instead of returning fail for all but
    the identity of the range).

- Update to new upstream release 2.14
  * Improved performance of some orbit algorithms by using
    dictionaries.
  * Improved performance of AddToIgs for some examples where it
    previously performed very badly.
  * Added custom IsSingleValued method for group homomorphisms
    whose Source is an polycyclic groups, which can avoid an
    endless loop when the range is an infinite group.
  * Fixed bug in NormalizerPcpGroup, ComplementClassesCR,
    OrbitIntegralAction, and StabilizerIntegralAction, which
    could result in a break loop.
  * Fixed bug in AddToIgs for infinite groups which could result
    in an invalid output leading to strange results.
  * Fixed IsConjugate for pcp group elements to always return
    true and false (instead of an element which conjugates the
    inputs to each other).
  * Deprecated NaturalHomomorphism, use
    NaturalHomomorphismByNormalSubgroup instead (which is a
    standard GAP operation).
  * Replaced immediate methods for IsTorsionFree and
    IsFreeAbelian by implications, which have zero overhead,
    while immediate methods can slow down GAP.
  * Improved performance of UnitriangularPcpGroup for large n
  * Fixed a bug in OneCoboundariesCR which lead to an error in
    OneCohomologyCR.
  * Fixed a bug where the normal closure of an abelian subgroup
    could end up being flagged as abelian, even though it was not.
