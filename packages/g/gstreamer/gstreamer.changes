- Drop gstreamer-0_10-make382.patch: fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 19 01:02:07 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Move gir files to devel subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 15 20:27:19 UTC 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Extend gstreamer-0_10.prov: we need a possibility to simply skip
  the automatic provides function. In this case, defining
  SKIP_GSTPROVIDES to non-zero will be recognized as an ignore flag
  for the package. All other requires/provides will not be
  affected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 11 18:18:02 UTC 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add gstreamer-0_10-make382.patch: Fix build with make 3.82.
  Generally, the -doc package is affected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  2 12:07:07 UTC 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add gstreamer-0_10-rpm-prov.patch: adds --rpm to gst-inspect,
  allowing rpm to create a list of provides, thanks to the
  gstreamer-0_10.prov script we install. Those provides can then be
  picked up by PackageKit. Patch taken from Fedora's gstreamer
  package.
- Add gstreamer-0_10.macros that contains a rpm macro, in case
  external provides scripts are used.
- Add gstreamer-utils Requires to the -devel package: this is used
  in gstreamer-0_10.prov for the rpm magic to work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 12:57:07 UTC 2010 - aj@suse.de

- Recommend instead of require lang package since it's not mandatory.

- Update to version 0.10.29:
  + improve plugin loading robustness: do not ever unload a plugin
    after calling into it: should fix mystery crashers during
