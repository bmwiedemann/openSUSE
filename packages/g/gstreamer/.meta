  <title>Streaming-Media Framework Runtime</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'gstreamer-0_10' from project 'openSUSE:Factory'.

GStreamer is a streaming-media framework, based on graphs of filters
which operate on media data. Applications using this library can do
anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
about anything else media-related.  Its plug-in-based architecture
means that new data types or processing capabilities can be added by
installing new plug-ins.
