%description
The ANUPQ package is a GAP4 interface to the ANU pq C program, which
provides access to implementations of the following algorithms:

* A p-quotient algorithm to compute a power-commutator presentation
  for a group of prime power order.
* A p-group generation algorithm to generate descriptions of groups
  of prime power order.
* A standard presentation algorithm used to compute a canonical
  power-commutator presentation of a p-group.
* An algorithm which can be used to compute the automorphism group of
  a p-group.
