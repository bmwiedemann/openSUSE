<package name="gnuserv" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Server and Clients for Emacs</title>
  <description>This package is not required for XEmacs, because the tools included
here are a part of the XEmacs package.

With these tools, an already running Emacs can be accessed externally,
for example, in order to edit a file or run a code in Emacs Lisp. This
way, there is no need to start a new Emacs each time another
application loads an editor.
