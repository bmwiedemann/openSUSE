To use gnuserv with GNU Emacs add add the following lines to the
~/.emacs file:

    (autoload 'gnuserv-start "gnuserv-compat")
    (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook '(lambda () (gnuserv-start)))

And set the environment variable EDITOR to "gnuclient" (e.g., in
.bashrc):

export EDITOR=gnuclient

For advanced features, take a look at the gnuserv(1) man page ('man
gnuserv').  Note security implications outline in the documentation--you
are warned!
