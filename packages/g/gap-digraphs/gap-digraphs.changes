Tue Dec 20 21:47:28 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.6.1
  * Change `CayleyDigraph` to use `AsSet`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 19 04:25:36 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.6.0
  * The `ViewString` for immutable digraphs attempts to show more
    of the known information about the digraph. This will break tests
    that relied on the previous behaviour, that contained only the
    numbers of vertices and edges.
  * The behaviour of `QuotientDigraph` has been changed so that it
    no longer returns digraphs with multiple edges.
  * `IsEulerianDigraph` would previously return `true` for digraphs
    that are Eulerian when their isolated vertices were removed,
    which contradicted the documentation. `IsEulerianDigraph` now
    returns `false` for _all_ digraphs that are not strongly
    connected.
- Delete 0001-Drop-bad-include-of-x86intrin.h.patch,

    with NautyTracesInterface, in certain cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 26 19:47:36 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Remove all transient build artifacts (e.g. config.log) to make
  build reproducible
- delete remaining sources and test assets

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 26 18:15:27 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Add 0001-Drop-bad-include-of-x86intrin.h.patch
  Remove unnecessary include of x86intrin.h, breaks compilation on
  anything but x86.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 26 14:40:18 UTC 2018 - guillaume@opensuse.org

- Add ExclusiveArch for x86 and x86_64 since it needs 'x86intrin.h'

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 23 09:42:01 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.11.0
  * Support for computing automorphisms, canonical labellings,
    and isomorphisms of digraphs with "nauty". This functionality
    requires the gap-nautytracesinterface package for GAP.
    However, this is not a required package, and the default
    engine remains "bliss". It is possible to specify the engine
    that is used by Digraphs.
  * In particular, version 0.11.0 includes the following changes:
  * `BlissAutomorphismGroup` and `NautyAutomorphismGroup` are
    introduced.
  * `DigraphCanonicalLabelling` is replaced by
    `BlissCanonicalLabelling` and `NautyCanonicalLabelling`.
  * `BlissCanonicalDigraph` and `NautyCanonicalDigraph` are
    introduced
  * `DigraphsUseNauty` and `DigraphsUseBliss` are introduced.
  * The property `IsHamiltonianDigraph` and the attribute
    `HamiltonianPath` were added.
- Add digraphs-no-native.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  8 16:51:28 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.10.1
  * This release contains new features, bugfixes, and minor
    improvements to the documentation. There is a new method for
    `ChromaticNumber`, which has better performance than the
    previous method.
  * A bug in the code for calculating homomorphisms of digraphs,
    which could cause a crash, was resolved.
  * Vertex labelled digraphs can now be visualised in a way that
    displays vertex labels, by using the new operation
    `DotVertexLabelledDigraph`.
  * The attribute `CliqueNumber` is introduced.
  * The following new attributes for Cayley digraphs are
    introduced: `GroupOfCayleyDigraph`,
    `SemigroupOfCayleyDigraph`, `GeneratorsOfCayleyDigraph`.
  * New features introduced in 0.9.0: `ArticulationPoints` (and
    its synonym `CutVertices`), `IsBiconnectedDigraph`
    `IsCycleDigraph`, `IsMatching`, `IsPerfectMatching`,
    `IsMaximalMatching`.
  * New features introduced in 0.8.0: `DigraphClosure`,
    `BooleanAdjacencyMatrixMutableCopy`, `IsPartialOrderDigraph`,
    `IsMeetSemilatticeDigraph`, `IsJoinSemilatticeDigraph`,
    `IsLatticeDigraph`, `PartialOrderDigraphMeetOfVertices`,
    `PartialOrderDigraphJoinOfVertices`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 29 18:47:03 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.7.1
  * This release contains a new technique for encoding a
    vertex-coloured `multidigraph` as a vertex-coloured
    (undirected) graph while preserving the automorphism group,
    in order to calculate the automorphism group and canonical
    labelling using bliss. This enables the following
    functionality:
  ** the operations `AutomorphismGroup` and
     `DigraphCanonicalLabelling` for a digraph and a
     vertex-colouring now accept a multidigraph as their first
     argument;
  ** the operations `IsIsomorphicDigraph` and
     `IsomorphismDigraphs` now accept multidigraphs, and they
     also accept vertex-colourings as optional arguments.
  * This release add new functionality related to undirected
    spanning trees and undirected spanning forests:
  ** The property `IsUndirectedForest` is introduced;
  ** The attributes `UndirectedSpanningTree` and
     `UndirectedSpanningForest` are introduced; and
  ** The operations `IsUndirectedSpanningTree` and
     `IsUndirectedSpanningForest` are introduced.
