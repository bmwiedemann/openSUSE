Tue Mar  5 06:22:41 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.24.0:
  * GStreamer Editing Services and NLE
    - Implement a gesvideoscale effect which gives user the ability
      to chooses where a clip has to be scaled in the chain of
      effects. By default scaling is done in the compositor.
    - Add support for gessrc as sub-timeline element so third party
      can implement their own formatters and use their timelines as
      sub-timelines. Before that, only timelines serialized as
      files on the filesystem could be loaded as sub-timelines
      (using gesdemux).
    - Implement a new GESDiscovererManager singleton object making
      management of the discoverers used to discoverer media files
      cleaner and allowing to expose the following APIs:
      * load-serialize-info signal so GstDiscovererInfo can be
        serialized by users the way they like and load them without
        requiring discovering the file when reloading a project.
      * source-setup signal so user can tweak source elements
        during discovery
    - Expose GESFrameCompositionMeta in public API so user can
      implement their own effects targetting GES which take into
      account that meta.
    - Expose audioconvert:mix-matrix property in audio sources
    - Port GESPipeline rendering to use encodebin2. This allows
      rendering timelines directly with a muxing sink (like
      hlssinkX etc..) and leverage all new features of that new
      element.
  * ges-launch
    - Fix setting keyframes
    - Add an ignore-eos option
    - Allow overriding container profile so that the user can build
      encoding profiles following the media format of a specific
      media file, for example, but ensuring it is muxed using a
      specific format
    - Ensure sink elements are inside a GstBin and never in a
      GstPipeline
    - Move +effect stack effects from source to last effect added,
      so it feels more natural to user as adding them at the
      beginning of the chain while the syntax is +effect felt wrong
  * For more detailed information on this update, please see
    https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.24/

  really required now.
