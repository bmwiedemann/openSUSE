%description
The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying GNonLin set
of plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks
for:
Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
available GStreamer plugins.
Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
through the GNonLin set of plugins.

But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write
a consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear
editing notions which are closer and more meaningful for the
end-user (and therefore the application).

The GStreamer Editing Services (hereafter GES) aims to fill the gap
between GStreamer/GNonLin and the application developer by offering
a series of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of
editing-related applications.
