-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 20 22:10:01 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.2.0
  * This release contains a number of fixes and improvements, and
    one new feature, which is a method for `IsSelfDualSemigroup`
    and related functionality for semigroups satisfying
    `CanUseFroidurePin`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 19 01:16:28 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.1.0
  * The package now features a compiled C/C++ module which
    interfaces with the libsemigroups C++ library to allow
    high-speed computations for congruences and certain categories
    of semigroup. There are also several new types of semigroup and
    a variety of new methods which can be used with them.
  * The kernel module has been simplified signficantly, to make it
    easier to incorporate future changes in libsemigroups[], and
    some superfluous functionality was withdrawn.
  * The backwards incompatible changes in this release relate to
    matrices over the integers or over a finite field.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 20 13:48:02 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.8.0
* Added `ApsisMonoid`, `CrossedApsisMonoid`,
  `ModularPartitionMonoid`, `PlanarModularPartitionMonoid`,
  `PlanarPartitionMonoid`, `PlanarUniformBlockBijectionMonoid`,
  `SingularApsisMonoid`, `SingularCrossedApsisMonoid`,
  `SingularModularPartitionMonoid`,
  `SingularPlanarModularPartitionMonoid`,
  `SingularPlanarPartitionMonoid`,
  `SingularPlanarUniformBlockBijectionMonoid`,
  `SingularUniformBlockBijectionMonoid`,
  `UniformBlockBijectionMonoid`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  8 20:02:45 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.7.4
* This is a minor release to fix some manual examples, to correct
  the package url in the `PackageInfo.g` file, and to fix some
  issues with semigroups of bipartitions. It was formerly
  possible to create semigroups of bipartitions where the
  generators had different degrees, but the created semigroups
  were invalid; this is fixed in version 2.7.3.
* Require GAP 4.8.3 since the function `IsZeroSimpleSemigroup`
  entered an infinite loop for some examples of semigroups of
  partial permutations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 12 19:49:13 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.7.2
* `IsomorphismReesZeroMatrixSemigroup` is introduced, and it is no
  longer possible to apply `IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup` to a
  0-simple semigroup.
* The meaning of `IsMonoidAsSemigroup` was changed to be consistent
  with the meaning of `IsGroupAsSemigroup`. In earlier versions,
  `IsMonoidAsSemigroup` was `false` for semigroups in the category
  `IsMonoid`.
* `IsInverseSemigroup` sometimes returned true for semigroups
  which were not inverse

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 22 11:24:21 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.2
* New: the functions SmallestElementSemigroup,
  LargestElementSemigroup, and GeneratorsSmallest.
* Some minor corrections were made to the methods for creating the
  ideals of some semigroups in standard examples semigroups, such
  as SingularTransformationSemigroup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 12 13:35:58 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.1.1
* extensive new features for computing with elements and
  subsemigroups of the partition monoid.
* support for ideals of transformation, partial permutation, and
  bipartition semigroups, and subsemigroups of Rees 0-matrix
  semigroups.
* The new operations IsomorphismSemigroups, IsIsomorphicSemigroup,
  and SmallestMultiplicationTable.
* The new operation MaximalSubsemigroups, which returns the maximal
  subsemigroups of an arbitrary semigroup.
* The new operation Normalizer for computing a subgroup of a
  permutation group consisting of those permutations that stabilise,
  under conjugation, a transformation, partial perm, or bipartition
  semigroup.
* The new operation CharacterTableOfInverseSemigroup for finding the
  character table of an inverse semigroup of partial permutations.
* Methods for defining and manipulating the congruences of a Rees
  0-matrix semigroup.
* The operation EndomorphismsPartition that returns the monoid
  of endomorphisms preserving a partition. This monoid is defined
  using the minimum possible number of generators.
* A lot more, see the detailed changelog in the package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  4 17:44:38 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.4
* Package rename from citrus to semigroup. The package has been
  completely overhauled, the performance has been improved, and the
  code has been generalized so that in the future the same code can
  be used to compute with other types of semigroups.
* This release includes several new methods for inverse semigroups
  of partial permutations and for free inverse semigroup. Most
  notably among the new methods for inverse semigroups of partial
  permutations are: "SmallerDegreePartialPermRepresentation" and
  "VagnerPrestonRepresentation" for changing the representation of
  an inverse semigroup of partial permutations.
* The methods in Semigroups have been extended to apply to
  arbitrary subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over
  groups; 
* A new method for MaximalSubsemigroups of Rees matrix semigroup
  has been implemented;
* The function Read/WriteSemigroups have been renamed
  Read/WriteGenerators and their performance has been improved. It
  is now possible to use WriteGenerators to write to a gzipped file.
