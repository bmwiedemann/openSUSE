Thalamus: The GNU Health Federation Message and Authentication Server
=====================================================================

The Thalamus project provides a RESTful API hub to all the GNU Health
Federation nodes. The main functions are:

#. **Message server**: A concentrator and message relay from and to
   the participating nodes in the GNU Health Federation and the GNU Health
   Information System (MongoDB). Some of the participating nodes include
   the GNU Health HMIS, MyGNUHealth mobile PHR application,
   laboratories, research institutions and civil offices.

#. **Authentication Server**: Thalamus also serves as an authentication and
   authorization server to interact with the GNUHealth Information System


Thalamus is part of the GNU Health project, but it is a self contained,
independent server that can be used in different health related scenarios.
