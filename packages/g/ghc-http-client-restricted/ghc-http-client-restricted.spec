%description
Addition to the http-client and http-client-tls libraries, that restricts the
HTTP servers that can be used.

This is useful when a security policy needs to eg, prevent connections to HTTP
servers on localhost or a local network, or only allow connections to a
specific HTTP server.

It handles restricting redirects as well as the initial HTTP connection, and it
also guards against DNS poisoning attacks.
