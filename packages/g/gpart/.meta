  <title>Tool That Can Guess a Lost Partition Table</title>
  <description>Gpart is a small tool that tries to guess what partitions are on a PC
type hard disk in case the primary partition table was damaged. Gpart
supports, among others, partitions formatted as ext2, FAT 12/16/32,
ReiserFS, NTFS, and HPFS. Read the file
/usr/share/doc/packages/gpart/README and the gpart man page before
