- Update skylighting to version 0.10.4.1.
  ## 0.10.4.1

    * Fixed logic for checking line-end-context (#119).

    * Use NonEmpty for the context stack.

    * Remove unneeded build-depends.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update skylighting to version 0.10.4.
  ## 0.10.4

    * Move from hxt to xml-conduit for XML parsing.

      This gives about a 4X speedup in parsing syntax definitions.
      It also reduces the pandoc build dependency footprint, as we
      depend on xml-conduit anyway and now no longer need to compile
      HXT and its dependencies.

      There are improvements in accuracy as well: the change to
      xml-conduit improved parsing for one of the prolog rules;
      a matcher that should have been for tab characters had been set for a
      space instead.

    * Removed some unnecessary build-depends in skylighting-extract.

Wed Nov 25 16:29:55 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update skylighting to version 0.10.1.
  ## 0.10.1

    * Regex: handle `(?|)` modifier.  This is used in bash.xml now.
      It resets the numbers of capturing groups in alternatives.

    * Improve regex handling of `{` and `}` not in quantifiers:
      - `{}` is literal (not a quantifier).
      - loose unescaped `{` and `}` that are not part of a quantifier are
        literal matchers.

    * Update xml syntax definitions from upstream.
      For: abc, actionscript, ada, agda, alert, apache, asn1, asp,
      ats, awk, bash, boo, c, clojure, cmake, coffee, coldfusion,
      commonlisp, cs, css, curry, d, djangotemplate, dockerfile,

- Update skylighting to version 0.10.0.3.
  ## 0.10.0.3

    * Add groovy syntax.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 13 07:05:30 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update skylighting to version 0.10.0.2.
  ## 0.10.0.2

    * Improve DetectIdentifier to ensure that identifiers can't
      include non-ASCII characters.

  ## 0.10.0.1

    * Fix identifier detection in non-ASCII context (#110).

  ## 0.10

    * Add instructions for submitting patches upstream to KDE (#106).

    * Synced syntax definitions from KDE repo.  Note that fortran
      has split into two: `fortran-fixed` and `fortran-free`.

    * Add test to ensure that all regexes in rules compile.

    * Regex: allow unescaped `}`.

    * Regex: allow empty regexes and groups.

    * Regex: support lazy and possessive quantifiers (#109).

    * Regex: support recursive regexes `(?R)` (#108).

    * Hide invisible line numbers from keyboard focus (#107, d10n).
      This fixes tabbing through elements on a page.

    * Remove some obsolete patches for xml definitions.

  ## 0.9

    * Use a pure Haskell regex implementation (in unexported module
      Text.Regex.KDE) instead of pcre.  The implementation is not
      as efficient as pcre, but it seems good enough for this
      application, and it is desirable to avoid depending on a C
      library.  (Available Haskell libraries weren't up to the
      task, because they don't do back-references, captures,
      lookahead/behind.) Some benchmarks (old/new):
      haskell (4.6/7.9) java (13.4/23.3) c (2.8/3.7) rhtml
      (4.7/6.1) lua (10.6/13.2) javascript (4.2/6.6).
      Though this is a significant slowdown, the tradeoff seems
      worth it to have a pure Haskell implementation.

    * Removed old `system-pcre` flag.

    * More efficient treatment of dynamic regexes.
      We put something in the Regex itself to represent the `%1`,
      and modify it later.  This allows us to cache dynamic
      regexes in a way we couldn't before.

    * Add support for TOML (#105, Shiming Wang),
      GraphQL, and Nim syntax (#102, Daniel Pozo Escalona).

    * Update xml definitions for actionscript, bash, boo, c,
      cmake, elm, erlang, glsl, isocpp, java, lua, m4, mediawiki,
      perl, powershell, scala, tcsh, xul, zsh.

    * Fix fallthrough behavior (don't always consume a token).

    * Fix word boundary detection.

    * Remove RegexException. (API change)

    * Skylighting.Regex now exports `isWordChar` and `testRegex`,
      as well as the constructors underlying the new `Regex` type.

    * Remove some obsolete xml definition patches.

    * Fix escaped % in dynamic regex.

- Update skylighting to version 0.8.5.
  ## 0.8.5

    * Respect dynamic flag on StringDetect elements (#99, Albert
      Krewinkel).

    * Increase test timeout to avoid failures with qemu-emulated
      environments, such as qemu and riscv64 in Ubuntu builders
      (William Grant).

    * Fix attribute for opening double quote in sql-postgresql.xml
      (Benjamin Wuethrich).

    * Update syntax descriptions for javascript, bash, coffee,
      javascript-react, javascript, latex, sql-postgresql, typescript.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  9 09:10:53 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update skylighting to version 0.8.4.
  ## 0.8.4

    * HTML output: use aria-hidden="true" on empty a elements
      unless numberLines is specified (in which case the element
      is still empty but will have content added by CSS).
      This is to avoid excess noise when the code blocks are
      read by screen readers.  See jgm/pandoc#6352.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 25 10:22:55 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update skylighting to version 0.8.3.2.
  ## 0.8.3.2 -- 2020-01-21

   * This fixes a packaging error in 0.8.3.1, which didn't include
     the results of the bootsrap step and hence didn't update the
     syntax modules.

  ## 0.8.3.1 -- 2020-01-21

   * Escape `<` and `>` in latex to avoid ligatures (#91).

   * Fix and extend Idris keywords (Denis Buzdalov).

   * Update XML syntax definitions for javascript-react, qml,
     typescript, javascript, cmake, cofee, latex, perl, python,
     rest.

   * Fixed bug with context shifts using `##` syntax for foreign context.
     Previously we only handled these in IncludeRules, but
     starting with the current batches of xml files they can occur
     elsewhere too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 27 03:00:59 UTC 2019 - psimons@suse.com

- Update skylighting to version 0.8.3.
  ## 0.8.3 -- 2019-11-26

    * Update XML syntax definitions for c, cmake, coffee, cpp, css,
      diff, djangotemplate, elixir, elm, glsl, haskell, html, isocpp,
      javascript-react, javascript, json, jsp, julia, latex, lua,
      markdown, matlab, mediawiki, modelines, mustache, perl, php,
      powershell, qml, rest, rust, typescript, vhdl.

    * Fix highlighting errors with non-ASCII characters in JSON (#90).
      This error was due to an optimization that made some incorrect
      assumptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  8 16:14:46 UTC 2019 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update skylighting to version 0.8.2.3.
  ## 0.8.2.3 -- 2019-10-03

    * Tests: ensure we read test files as UTF-8.

    * Fix compiler warnings around Monoid imports.

    * Add MonadFail constraint (allowing compilation with ghc 8.8.x).

    * Add cabal.project and move CI from Travis to GitHub Actions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  2 02:01:48 UTC 2019 - psimons@suse.com

- Update skylighting to version 0.8.2.2.
  ## 0.8.2.2 -- 2019-09-30

    * Remove upper bound on regex-base and require
      regex-pcre-builtin >= 0.95, to avoid a build conflict
      with earlier versions of regex-pcre-builtin and
      regex-base >= 0.94.

    * Remove unused system-pcre flag in skylighting.cabal.
      This flag only affects skylighting-core.

Mon Jul 15 02:01:47 UTC 2019 - psimons@suse.com

- Update skylighting to version 0.8.2.
  ## 0.8.2 -- 2019-07-14

    * Change matchRegex so it gives "no match" on a regex error
      instead of raising an exception. This seems to be how Kate
      works.  Fixes an error on long integer literals (#81).

  ## 0.8.1.2 -- 2019-07-14

    * Fix HlCChar for one-character octal escapes like '\0' (#82).
      Due to a bug in pCStringChar, only multi-character octal
      escapes were being recognized. This affects not just C
      highlighting, but all of the following highlighters which
      use HlCChar: fasm eiffel pike objectivec ruby vhdl scala
      java jsp nasm protobuf pure go objectivecpp gnuassembler povray
      actionscript c cs opencl boo rhtml elixir.  This fixes a
      regression introduced in version 0.3.1.

    * Require skylighting-core >= 0.7.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 14 17:02:11 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com
- Update skylighting to version 0.7.1.
  * Split skylighting into skylighting-core (BSD3) and skylighting (GPL)
    (#37, Jonathan Daugherty).  skylighting-core (BSD3 licensed) includes
    the core library functionality and the source of the XML syntax, but
    not the compiled Syntax modules, and skylighting (GPL2 licensed)
    includes Syntax modules compiled from the XML syntax files.
  * We discontinue support for GHC before 7.10 (because we need to support the
    reexport-modules Cabal directive.)
  * Print message about loaded syntax defs to stderr (#36).
  * New module Skylighting.Loader, exporting
    `loadSyntaxFromFile` and `loadSyntaxesFromDir` (Jonathan Daugherty).
  * Adjust tests to load xml definitions dynamically.
  * Add ANSI color output (Alexander Ronald Altman, #22).
    + New package dependencies: `ansi-terminal` and `colour`.
    + New module: `Skylighting.Format.ANSI`, exporting `formatANSI`,
      (also reexported from the module `Skylighting`).
    + In `Skylighting.Types`, new types `ANSIColorLevel` and
      `Xterm256ColorCode`, and a new field `ansiColorLevel` in
      `FormatOptions`.
    + Main `skylighting` executable now supports ANSI output (use
      `ansi` as argument to `--format`), which is now the default output
      format. A new flag `--color-level` has been added to select
      the number of colors (with options `16`, `256`, `true`, and
      the default `auto`).
  * Reword error for missing contexts in IncludeRules.
  * Use ordNub instead of nub for missingIncludes.
  * Fixed tokenizer exceptions (#31).  Previously `throwError`
    did not actually generate `Left` results in `tokenize`,
    because of the way the MonadPlus instance worked. Rewrote
    the TokenizerM monad from scratch so that exceptions would
    not be skipped.
  * Improved error message about undefined contexts.
  * Makefile: use cabal for bootstrap target.
  * README: remove stack bootstrap instructions.
    You can no longer bootstrap with stack, because it
    insists on building ALL the executables the first time,
    and of course that can't be done with this library.
  * Use quickcheck for fuzz test.
  * Small improvements to fuzz tests in test suite.  We now
    ensure that we print the random text on test failure.  Also,
    we now run the test with many smaller samples rather than
    one big one.
  * Add aeson lower bound (because of toEncoding) (#28).
  * Fix line spacing and overflowing content in generated HTML
    (David Baynard, #25, see jgm/pandoc#4128).
    + Fix empty line height, explicitly
    + Ensure long lines scroll on screen
    + Only apply colour to the outer div
    + Don't reset line number colour
    + Fix borders on empty code lines
    + Collapse divs correctly.
  * Changes to Style types and JSON instances.  Previously we could not
    successfully round-trip through JSON.
    + `tokenStyles` is now a map rather than an association list.
    + We now use `line-number-color` instead of `line-numbers` at
      the top level in the JSON instances, falling back to
      `line-numbers` in `editor-colors`, for KDE theme compatibility.
    + We use `line-number-background-color` at the top level, falling
      back to the text background color.
    + We use `text-color` at the top level, falling back to the `text-color`
      of the `Normal` token style if it exists, for KDE compatibility.
    + We use `background-color` at the top level, falling back to
      the `background-color` in `editor-colors`, for KDE compatibility.
    + A round-trip JSON test has been added.
  * HTML formatting: fix color, bgcolor when numbering enabled.
    Previously, the code got the color and background color
    the numbers were supposed to get.  See jgm/pandoc #4103.
  * Updated syntax descriptions for bash, clojure, commonlisp, diff,
    dockerfile, doxygen, doxygenlua, fsharp, hamlet, haskell, haxe,
    java, javascript, julia, latex, literate-curry, literate-haskell,
    makefile, mediawiki, monobasic, ocaml, prolog, r, relaxng, scala,
    sci, sql-mysql, sql-postgresql, sql, xslt.
  * test program:  use --accept instead of --regen.
  * HTML formatter: always use an a element (rather than a div)
    for source lines.  The divs were invalid, because code
    elements must contain phrasing content.  Previously we used
    a elements when line anchors were called for, but there is
    no clear reason not to use them always.
  * skylighting binary: add doctype to generated HTML.
  * Fixed regression in `data-line-number` attributes in HTML
    output.  We should not include the `lineIdPrefix` in
    front of this.
  * Fixed typo in css (Artymort).
  * Fixed travis build times.
  * `FormatOptions`: added `lineIdPrefix` (jgm/pandoc#4031).
    This is needed because a web page may contain several
    code samples, and we need to make sure that the ids on
    lines are unique.
  * HTML formatter: use `lineIdPrefix` in ids for lines.
  * HTML formatter: Don't put href attributes on divs.
  * HTML output: remove outer div.  This prevented margin
    collapsing between the pre and surrounding block elements,
    and often gave us excess white space around code blocks.
    See jgm/pandoc#3996.
  * Updated XML definitions from KDE repository.
    Changed: actionscript, ada, agda, alert, alert_indent, asn1, awk, bash,
    boo, c, changelog, clojure, cmake, coldfusion, commonlisp, cpp, cs, css,
    curry, d, dockerfile, dot, doxygen, doxygenlua, eiffel, email, erlang,
    fortran, fsharp, gcc, haskell, haxe, isocpp, java, javascript, jsp, julia,
    lilypond, lua, m4, makefile, matlab, maxima, mips, modelines, modula-2,
    monobasic, objectivec, objectivecpp, ocaml, octave, opencl, pascal, perl,
    php, pike, postscript, prolog, purebasic, python, r, relaxng,
    relaxngcompact, rest, rhtml, ruby, rust, scala, scheme, sci, sql-mysql,
    sql-postgresql, sql, tcl, tcsh, verilog, vhdl, xml, xslt, xul, zsh.
  * Added support for powershell, using definition from KDE repository.
  * Stop terminating long builds on TravisCI (Kyle Ondy).
  * Removed ToJSON/FromJSON instances for KeywordAttr,
    WordSet, Matcher, Context, ContextSwitch, Rule, Syntax
    (added in 0.3.5).  Creating these increased the memory
    requirements for compiling skylighting to a degree not
    justified by the usefulness of these instances.
  * Added ToJSON/FromJSON instances for all basic types.
  * Added some background colors to 'kate' style, matching default.theme,
    and made FromJSON for Style sensitive to background-color.
  * HTML formatting: do not use `div` elements for source
    lines in inline output.
  * HTML formatting changes (David Baynard).  Note that these
    changes may require changes in hard-coded CSS that is
    used with skylighting's HTML output.
    + Wrap lines of source code in a `div` with `display` set to
      `inline-block`.  The `div`s make per-line processing easier.
      They cannot be set as `display: block` as that introduces extra
      new lines when copying and pasting.
    + Render line numbers in html using CSS pseudo elements rather than
      a table.  The line numbers are always produced, as `data-line-number`
      attributes, and css to display them as `::before` elements are
      always produced. The option to switch on line numbering only
      toggles a class; this means it is possible to toggle line numbering
      without re-running skylighting.
    + If the `linkAnchors` option is set, wrap with an `a` element rather
      than a `div`, set so that clicking the line number (and only the
      line number) will jump to that line.
    + Code wraps by default when html is printed, with wrapped lines
      indented.
  * Updated xml syntax definitions and clojure test.
  * Improved 'make update-xml' target.
  * Updated version bound for criterion.
  * Revert change from 0.3.2; now entities from a DTD are
    resolved if the DTD element is included.  This is needed
    for agda.xml and some others.  If you want to use a custom
    xml definition without needing language.dtd, just remove
    the reference to language.dtd in your xml file.
  * Added `case` keyword for ats (Hanwen (Steinway) Wu).
  * Parse xml definitions without resolving entities from
    language.dtd.  This allows xml definitions to be used even
    when language.dtd isn't available.  Existing definitions
    don't rely on the two or three entities definied in
    language.dtd, so this is harmless.
  * Small optimizations.
  * Use handwritten parser for Float instead of regex.  Fixes
    jgm/highlighting-kate#57 (again).
  * Added float parsing tests.
  * Use parsec parsers, not regex, for CStringChar and CChar.
  * Rewrote Int, Hex, Oct, CStringChar, CCHar parsers with parsec
    instead of regex.  This speeds things up.
  * Don't include leading + in Int, Hex, Oct parsers.  That gives
    bad results for things like `i+1`.
  * Store literal binary-encoded representations of the Syntax
    structure in Skylighting.Syntax.*.hs, instead of the
    structure itself.  This works around a problem ghc has
    compiling modules with large structures.  This indirect method
    produces faster compile times and avoids massive memory usage by
    ghc (especially in profiling builds).  For background see
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16348340/.  Closes #7.
  * Types: Internals of 'WordSet' are no longer exposed.
  * Restore Data, Typeable, Generic instances for basic types.
    To do this, we remove reCompiled field from RE (API change).  Instead, we
    have the tokenizer compile regexes the first time it encounters them,
    memoizing the results.  Performance is not significantly worse.
  * Skylighting.Syntax.*:  use string representation of the Syntax,
    which is then 'read', rather than including the code for the data
    structure directly (#7).  This indirect method produces faster compile
    times and avoids massive memory usage by ghc (especially in profiling
    builds).  For background see
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16348340/compiling-very-large-constants-with-ghc
  * Use -fprof-auto-exported for profiling builds.
  * Added benchmark for xml syntax definition parsing.
  * Patched perl.xml (improperly escaped regex) (#8).
    This fixes a perl regex compilation error for regex patterns
    with backslash as delimiter, e.g. m\a\.
  * Add a flag to build with system pcre (Felix Yan).
