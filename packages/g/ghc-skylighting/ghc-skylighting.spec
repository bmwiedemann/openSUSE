%description
Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library with support for over one hundred
languages. It derives its tokenizers from XML syntax definitions used by KDE's
KSyntaxHighlighting framework, so any syntax supported by that framework can be
added. An optional command-line program is provided. Skylighting is intended to
be the successor to highlighting-kate. This package provides generated syntax
modules based on the KDE XML definitions provided by the 'skylighting-core'
package. As a result this package is licensed under the GPL.
