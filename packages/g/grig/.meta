  <title>Graphical control program for hamlib</title>
  <description>Grig is a simple Ham Radio control (CAT) program based on Hamlib. It is
intended to be highly generic presenting the user to the same graphical user
interface regardless of which radio is being controlled.

Grig supports the most commonly used CAT commands that are implemented by
Hamlib, and integrates well with other ham radio programs like Xlog and gMFSK.
Thanks to Hamlib, grig works with most CAT-capable amateur radios.</description>
