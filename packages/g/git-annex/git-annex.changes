- Update git-annex to version 10.20221212.
  git-annex (10.20221212) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Fix a hang that occasionally occurred during commands such as move,
      when operating on unlocked files. (A bug introduced in 10.20220927)
    * When youtube-dl is not available in PATH, use yt-dlp instead.
    * Support parsing yt-dpl output to display download progress.
    * init: Avoid scanning for annexed files, which can be lengthy in a
      large repository. Instead that scan is done on demand.
    * Sped up the initial scan for annexed files by 21%.
    * test: Add --test-debug option.
    * Support quettabyte and yottabyte.

  git-annex (10.20221104) upstream; urgency=medium

    * export: Fix a bug that left a file on a special remote when
      two files with the same content were both deleted in the exported tree.
    * S3: Support signature=anonymous to access a S3 bucket anonymously.
      This can be used, for example, with importtree=yes to import from
      a public bucket.
      This feature needs git-annex to be built with aws-0.23.

- Update git-annex to version 10.20221103.
  git-annex (10.20221103) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Doubled the speed of git-annex drop when operating on many files,
      and of git-annex get when operating on many tiny files.
    * trust, untrust, semitrust, dead: Fix behavior when provided with
      multiple repositories to operate on.
    * trust, untrust, semitrust, dead: When provided with no parameters,
      do not operate on a repository that has an empty name.
    * move: Fix openFile crash with -J
      (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201103)
    * S3: Speed up importing from a large bucket when fileprefix= is set,
      by only asking for files under the prefix.
    * When importing from versioned remotes, fix tracking of the content
      of deleted files.
    * More robust handling of ErrorBusy when writing to sqlite databases.
    * Avoid hanging when a suspended git-annex process is keeping a sqlite
      database locked.
    * Make --batch mode handle unstaged annexed files consistently
      whether the file is unlocked or not. Note that this changes the
      behavior of --batch when it is provided with locked files that are
      in the process of being added to the repository, but have not yet been
      staged in git.
    * Make git-annex enable-tor work when using the linux standalone build.

- Update git-annex to version 10.20221003.
  git-annex (10.20221003) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Avoid displaying warning about git-annex restage needing to be run
      in situations where it does not.
    * Fix the annex.adviceNoSshCaching config, which has never worked.
      Thanks, Reiko Asakura

  git-annex (10.20220927) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Fix a bug in the last release that caused v8 repositories to upgrade
      immediately to v10, rather than taking the scheduled 1 year to do so.
    * annex.diskreserve default increased from 1 mb to 100 mb.
    * Include the assistant and webapp when building with cabal 3.4.1.0.
    * Merged the webapp build flag into the assistant build flag.
    * Optimise linker in linux standalone tarballs.
    * Fix crash importing from a directory special remote that contains
      a broken symlink.
    * When accessing a git remote over http needs a git credential
      prompt for a password, cache it for the lifetime of the git-annex
      process, rather than repeatedly prompting.
    * Use curl for downloads from git remotes when annex.url-options is set.
    * Fix a reversion that made dead keys not be skipped when operating on
      all keys via --all or in a bare repo.
      (Introduced in version 8.20200720)
    * vicfg: Include mincopies configuration.
    * Improve handling of directory special remotes with importtree=yes whose
      ignoreinode setting has been changed. When getting a file from such a
      remote, accept the content that would have been accepted with the
      previous ignoreinode setting.
    * directory, adb: Fixed a bug with importtree=yes and multiple files
      in the special remote have the same content, that caused it to
      refuse to get a file from the special remote, incorrectly complaining
      that it had changed, due to only accepting the inode+mtime of one file
      (that was since modified or deleted) and not accepting the inode+mtime
      of other duplicate files.
    * Fix a reversion that prevented git-annex from working in a
      repository when --git-dir or GIT_DIR is specified to relocate the git
      directory to somewhere else.
      (Introduced in version 10.20220525)
    * Improved handling of --time-limit when combined with -J
    * Fix updating git index file after getting an unlocked file
      when annex.stalldetection is set.
    * restage: New git-annex command, handles restaging unlocked files.
    * test: Added --test-with-git-config option.
    * Run annex.freezecontent-command and annex.thawcontent-command
      when on a crippled filesystem.
      Thanks, Reiko Asakura
    * enable-tor: Fix breakage caused by git's fix for CVE-2022-24765.
    * Let GIT_DIR and --git-dir override git's protection against operating
      in a repository owned by another user.
    * p2p: Pass wormhole the --appid option before the receive/send command,
      as it does not accept that option after the command
    * Support "inbackend" in preferred content expressions.

- Update git-annex to version 10.20220822.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/git-annex-10.20220822/src/CHANGELOG

Mon Jul 25 18:08:17 UTC 2022 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update git-annex to version 10.20220724.
  git-annex (10.20220724) upstream; urgency=medium

    * filter-process: Fix a bug involving handling of empty files,
      that caused git to kill git-annex filter-process.
    * add: Fix reversion when adding an annex link that has been moved to
      another directory. (Introduced in version 10.20220624)
    * Added annex.alwayscompact setting which can be unset to speed up
      writes to the git-annex branch in some cases. See its documentation
      for important notes on when it's appropariate to use.
    * adb: Added configuration setting oldandroid=true to avoid using
      find -printf, which was first supported in Android around 2019-2020.
      This may need to be enabled for old android devices that used to work
      without it being set, since version 10.20220222 started using
      find -printf.
    * --backend is no longer a global option, and is only accepted by
      commands that actually need it.
    * Improve handling of parallelization with -J when copying content
      from/to a git remote that is a local path.
    * S3: Avoid writing or checking the uuid file in the S3 bucket when
      importtree=yes or exporttree=yes.
    * Fix a reversion that prevented --batch commands (and the assistant)
      from noticing data written to the journal by other commands.
    * Fix building with the Assistant build flag disabled but the Webapp
      build flag enabled.

- Update git-annex to version 10.20220624.
  git-annex (10.20220624) upstream; urgency=medium

    * init: Added --no-autoenable option.
    * info: Added --autoenable option.
    * initremote: Improve handling of type=git special remotes.
      The location value no longer needs to match the url of an existing
      git remote, and locations not using ssh:// will work now, including
      both paths and host:/path
    * Fix retrival of an empty file that is stored in a special remote with
      chunking enabled.
      (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201103)
    * move: Improve resuming a move that succeeded in transferring the
      content, but where dropping failed due to eg a network problem,
      in cases where numcopies checks prevented the resumed
      move from dropping the object from the source repository.
    * add, fix, lock, rekey: When several files were being processed,
      replacing an annex symlink of a file that was already processed
      with a new large file could sometimes cause that large file to be
      added to git. These races have been fixed.
    * add: Also fix a similar race that could cause a large file be added
      to git when a small file was modified or overwritten while it was
      being added.
    * add --batch: Fix handling of a file that is skipped due to being
      gitignored.

- Update git-annex to version 10.20220525.
  git-annex (10.20220525) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Special remotes with importtree=yes or exporttree=yes are once again
      treated as untrusted, since files stored in them can be deleted or
      modified at any time.
      (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201129)
    * Added support for "megabit" and related bandwidth units
      in annex.stalldetection and everywhere else that git-annex parses
      data units. Note that the short form is "Mbit" not "Mb" because
      that differs from "MB" only in case, and git-annex parses units
      case-insensitively.
    * Special remotes using exporttree=yes and/or importtree=yes now
      checksum content while it is being retrieved, instead of in a separate
      pass at the end.
    * fsck: Fix situations where the annex object file is stored in a
      directory structure other than where annex symlinks point to.
    * Deal with git's recent changes to fix CVE-2022-24765, which prevent
      using git in a repository owned by someone else.
    * Improve an error message displayed in that situation.
    * Prevent git-annex init incorrectly reinitializing the repository in
      that situation.
    * test: When limiting tests to run with -p, work around tasty limitation
      by automatically including dependent tests.

  git-annex (10.20220504) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Ignore annex.numcopies set to 0 in gitattributes or git config,
      or by git-annex numcopies or by --numcopies, since that
      configuration would make git-annex easily lose data.
      Same for mincopies.
    * assistant: When annex.autocommit is set, notice commits that
      the user makes manually, and push them out to remotes promptly.
    * multicast: Support uftp 5.0 by switching from aes256-cbc to
      aes256-gcm.
    * Fix test failure on NFS when cleaning up gpg temp directory.
    * Fix a build failure with ghc 9.2.2.
      Thanks, gnezdo for the patch.
    * rsync 3.2.4 broke backwards-compatability by preventing exposing
      filenames to the shell. Made the rsync and gcrypt special remotes
      detect this and disable shellescape. Closes: #1010397
    * repair: Avoid treating refs/annex/last-index or other refs that
      are not commit objects as evidence of repository corruption.

Tue Mar 22 17:57:22 UTC 2022 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update git-annex to version 10.20220322.
  git-annex (10.20220322) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Directory special remotes with importtree=yes have changed to once more
      take inodes into account. This will cause extra work when importing
      from a directory on a FAT filesystem that changes inodes on every
      mount. To avoid that extra work, set ignoreinodes=yes when initializing
      a new directory special remote, or change the configuration of your
      existing remote:
        git-annex enableremote foo ignoreinodes=yes
    * add: Avoid unncessarily converting a newly unlocked file to be stored
      in git when it is not modified, even when annex.largefiles does not
      match it.
    * The above change to add fixes a reversion in version 10.20220222,
      where git-annex unlock followed by git-annex add, followed by git
      commit file could result in git thinking the file was modified
      after the commit.
    * Detect when an unlocked file whose content is not present has gotten
      some other content appended to it, and avoid treating it as a pointer
      file, so that appended content will not be checked into git, but will
      be annexed like any other file.
    * smudge: Warn when encountering a pointer file that has other content
      appended to it.
    * When annex.freezecontent-command is set, and the filesystem does not
      support removing write bits, avoid treating it as a crippled
      filesystem.
    * Run annex.thawcontent-command before deleting an object file,
      in case annex.freezecontent-command did something that would prevent
      deletion.
    * Fix propagation of nonzero exit status from git ls-files when a specified
      file does not exist, or a specified directory does not contain
      any files checked into git.
    * Fix build with aeson 2.0.
      Thanks, sternenseemann for the patch.
    * Avoid git-annex test being very slow when run from within the
      standalone linux tarball or OSX app.
    * test: Runs tests in parallel to speed up the test suite.
    * test: Added --jobs option.
    * Removed vendored copy of http-client-restricted, and removed the
      HttpClientRestricted build flag that avoided that dependency.
    * Removed the NetworkBSD build flag.

- Update git-annex to version 10.20220222.
  git-annex (10.20220222) upstream; urgency=medium

    * annex.skipunknown now defaults to false, so commands like
      `git annex get foo*` will not silently skip over files/dirs that are
      not checked into git.
    * info: Allow using matching options in more situations. File matching
      options like --include will be rejected in situations where there is
      no filename to match against.
    * adb: Avoid find failing with "Argument list too long"
    * Fix git-annex forget propagation between repositories.
      (reversion introduced in version 7.20190122)
    * registerurl, unregisterurl: Improved output when reading from stdin
      to be more like other batch commands.
    * registerurl, unregisterurl: Added --json and --json-error-messages options.
    * Avoid git status taking a long time after git-annex unlock of many files.
    * Pass --no-textconv when running git diff internally.

Thu Jan 27 18:55:05 UTC 2022 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update git-annex to version 10.20220127.
  git-annex (10.20220127) upstream; urgency=medium

    * New v10 repository version (with v9 as a stepping-stone to it).
      v8 remains the default version for now.
    * In v10, object files are locked using separate lock files. This allows
      the object files to be kept non-writable even in repositories where
      core.sharedRepository is set.
    * The v10 upgrade will happen automatically, one year after the v9
      upgrade, in order to allow time for any old git-annex processes that
      are not aware of the locking change to finish. Or git-annex upgrade
      can be used to upgrade to v10 immediately.
    * In v9 upgrade, set filter.annex.process. This makes git add/checkout faster
      when there are a lot of unlocked annexed files or non-annexed files, but can
      also make git add of large files to the annex somewhat slower.
      If this tradeoff does not work for your use case, you can still unset
      filter.annex.process.
    * export: When a non-annexed symlink is in the tree to be exported, skip it.
    * import: When the previously exported tree contained a non-annexed symlink,
      preserve it in the imported tree so it does not get deleted.
    * enableremote, renameremote: Better handling of the unusual case where
      multiple special remotes have been initialized with the same name.
    * Recover from corrupted content being received from a git remote,
      by deleting the temporary file when it fails to verify. This prevents
      a retry from failing again.
      (reversion introduced in version 8.20210903)
    * adb: Added ignorefinderror configuration parameter.
    * Avoid crashing when run in a bare git repo that somehow contains an
      index file.
    * Reject combinations of --batch (or --batch-keys) with options like
      --all or --key or with filenames.

Wed Jan 19 12:40:15 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update git-annex to version 8.20211231.
  * Improved support for using git-annex in a read-only repository,
    git-annex branch information from remotes that cannot be merged
    into the git-annex branch will now not crash it, but will be
    merged in memory.
  * addurl, youtube-dl: When --check-raw prevents downloading an
    url, still continue with any downloads that come after it,
    rather than erroring out.
  * Fix locking problems when annex.pidlock is set and concurrency
    is enabled eg with -J.
  * Improve error message display when autoinit fails due to eg, a
    permissions problem.
  * export: Avoid unncessarily re-exporting non-annexed files that
    were already exported.
  * Improve git command queue flushing so that eg, addurl of
    several large files that take time to download will update the
    index for each file, rather than deferring the index updates to
    the end.
  * sync: Better error message when unable to export to a remote
    because remote.name.annex-tracking-branch is configured to a
    ref that does not exist.
  * Fix build with ghc 9.0.1
  * Fix build with old versions of feed library.
- git-annex 8.20211123 was released with these changes:
  * Bugfix: When -J was enabled, getting files could leak an
    ever-growing number of git cat-file processes.
  * Support git's new "ort" resolver, which became the default in
    git 2.34.0, and broke the test suite and automatic merge
    resolution of a conflict between an annexed file and a
    non-annexed file.
  * importfeed: Display url before starting youtube-dl download.
- Move to _service checking out the upstream source directly
- Avoid compiling and linking the binary a second time in the
  install phase and a third time in the check phase

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 20 17:31:42 UTC 2021 - psimons@suse.com

- Update git-annex to version 8.20211117.
  git-annex (8.20211117) upstream; urgency=medium

    * filter-process: New command that can make git add/checkout faster when
      there are a lot of unlocked annexed files or non-annexed files, but that
      also makes git add of large annexed files slower. Use it by running:
      git config filter.annex.process 'git-annex filter-process'
    * Fix a typo in the name of youtube-dl
      (reversion introduced in version 8.20210903)
    * git-lfs: Fix interoperability with gitlab's implementation of the
      git-lfs protocol, which requests Content-Encoding chunked.
    * importfeed: Fix a crash when used in a non-unicode locale.
    * migrate: New --remove-size option.
    * uninit: Avoid error message when no commits have been made to the
      repository yet.
    * uninit: Avoid error message when there is no git-annex branch.
    * metadata --batch: Avoid crashing when a non-annexed file is input,
      instead output a blank line like other batch commands do.
    * metadata --batch --json: Reject input whose "fields" does not consist
      of arrays of strings. Such invalid input used to be silently ignored.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20211028.
  git-annex (8.20211028) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Removed support for accessing git remotes that use versions of
      git-annex older than 6.20180312.
    * git-annex-shell: Removed several commands that were only needed to
      support git-annex versions older than 6.20180312.
    * Negotiate P2P protocol version with tor remotes, allowing
      use of protocol version 1. This negotiation is not supported
      by versions of git-annex older than 6.20180312.
    * Fix bug that caused stale git-annex branch information to read
      when annex.private or remote.name.annex-private is set.
    * git-annex get when run as the first git-annex command in a new repo
      did not populate all unlocked files.
      (Reversion in version 8.20210621)
    * Fix using lookupkey and info inside a subdirectory of the git repository.
      (Reversion in version 8.20211011)
    * Avoid some sqlite crashes on Windows SubSystem for Linux (WSL).
    * Call annex.freezecontent-command on the annex object file
      after it has been moved into place in annex/objects/. This allows
      the hook to freeze the file in ways that prevent moving it, such as
      removing the Windows delete permission.
      Thanks, Reiko Asakura.
    * addurl: Support adding the same url to multiple files at the same
      time when using -J with --batch --with-files.
    * When retrieval from a chunked remote fails, display the error that
      occurred when downloading the chunk, rather than the error that
      occurred when trying to download the unchunked content, which is less
      likely to actually be stored in the remote.
    * Avoid crashing tilde expansion on user who does not exist.
    * test: Put gpg temp home directory in system temp directory,
      not filesystem being tested.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20211011.
  git-annex (8.20211011) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added annex.bwlimit and remote.name.annex-bwlimit config to limit
      the bandwidth of transfers. It works for git remotes and many
      but not all special remotes.
    * Bug fix: Git configs such as annex.verify were incorrectly overriding
      per-remote git configs such as remote.name.annex-verify.
      (Reversion in version 4.20130323)
    * borg: Significantly improved memory use when a borg repository
      contains many archives.
    * borg: Avoid trying to extract xattrs, ACLS, and bsdflags when
      retrieving from a borg repository.
    * Sped up git-annex smudge --clean by 25%.
    * Resume where it left off when copying a file to/from a local git remote
      was interrupted.
    * sync --content: Avoid a redundant checksum of a file that was
      incrementally verified, when used on NTFS and perhaps other filesystems.
    * reinject: Fix crash when reinjecting a file from outside the repository.
      (Reversion in version 8.20210621)

- Update git-annex to version 8.20210903.
  git-annex (8.20210903) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Deal with clock skew, both forwards and backwards, when logging
      information to the git-annex branch.
    * GIT_ANNEX_VECTOR_CLOCK can now be set to a fixed value (eg 1)
      rather than needing to be advanced each time a new change is made.
    * Misuse of GIT_ANNEX_VECTOR_CLOCK will no longer confuse git-annex.
    * add: When adding a dotfile, avoid treating its name as an extension.
    * rsync special remote: Stop displaying rsync progress, and use
      git-annex's own progress display.
    * Many special remotes now checksum content while it is being retrieved,
      instead of in a separate pass at the end. This is supported for all
      special remotes on Linux (except for bittorrent), and for many
      on other OS's (except for adb, external, gcrypt, hook, and rsync).
    * unused: Skip the refs/annex/last-index ref that git-annex recently
      started creating.
    * Fix test suite failure on Windows.
    * New --batch-keys option added to these commands:
      get, drop, move, copy, whereis
    * Added annex.youtube-dl-command config. This can be used to run some
      forks of youtube-dl.
    * Run cp -a with --no-preserve=xattr, to avoid problems with copied
      xattrs, including them breaking permissions setting on some NFS
      servers.
    * add, import: Detect when xattrs or perhaps ACLs prevent removing
      write permissions from an annexed file, and fail with an informative
      message.
    * Fix support for readonly git remotes.
      (Reversion in version 8.20210621)
    * When downloading urls fail, explain which urls failed for which
      reasons.
    * web: Avoid displaying a warning when downloading one url failed
      but another url later succeeded.

    * whereused: New command, finds what files use a key, or where a key
      was used historically.
    * Fix a bug that prevented getting content from a repository that
      started out as a bare repository, or had annex.crippledfilesystem
      set, and was converted to a non-bare repository.
    * Fix retrieval of content from borg repos accessed over ssh.
    * sync: When --quiet is used, run git commit, push, and pull without
      their ususual output.
    * merge: When --quiet is used, run git merge without its usual output.
    * sync, merge, post-receive: Avoid merging unrelated histories,
      which used to be allowed only to support direct mode repositories.
      (However, sync does still merge unrelated histories when importing
      trees from special remotes, and the assistant still merges unrelated
      histories.)
    * sync, merge: Added --allow-unrelated-histories option, which
      is the same as the git merge option.
    * Fix bug that caused some transfers to incorrectly fail with
      "content changed while it was being sent", when the content was not
      changed.
    * Fix bug that could prevent pointer files from being populated,
      in a repository that was upgraded from v7.
    * fsck: Detect and correct stale or missing inode caches.
    * Fix a rounding bug in display of data sizes.
    * git-annex get when run as the first git-annex command in a new repo
      did not populate unlocked files.

  git-annex (8.20210630) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Fixed bug that interrupting git-annex repair (or assistant) while
      it was fixing repository corruption would lose objects that were
      contained in pack files. Also the assistant might sometimes have
      crashed with the same result.
    * repair: Fix reversion in version 8.20200522 that prevented fetching
      missing objects from remotes.
    * sync: Partly work around github behavior that first branch to be pushed
      to a new repository is assumed to be the head branch, by not pushing
      synced/git-annex first.
    * Added annex.freezecontent-command and annex.thawcontent-command
      configs.
    * Improve display of errors when transfers fail.
    * Dropping an unused object with drop --unused or dropunused will
      mark it as dead, preventing fsck --all from complaining about it
      after it's been dropped from all repositories.
    * addurl, importfeed: Added --no-raw option that forces download
      with youtube-dl or a special remote. In particular this can avoid
      falling back to raw download when youtube-dl is blocked for some
      reason.

    * New matching options --excludesamecontent and --includesamecontent
    * When two files have the same content, and a required content expression
      matches one but not the other, dropping the latter file will fail as it
      would also remove the content of the required file.
    * drop, move, mirror: When two files have the same content, and
      different numcopies or requiredcopies values, use the higher value.
    * drop --auto: When two files have the same content, and a preferred content
      expression matches one but not the other, do not drop the content.
    * sync --content, assistant: When two unlocked files have the same
      content, and a preferred content expression matches one but not the
      other, do not drop the content. (This was already the case for locked
      files.)
    * sync --content, assistant: Fix an edge case where a file that is not
      preferred content did not get dropped.
    * filter-branch: New command, useful to produce a filtered version of the
      git-annex branch, eg when splitting a repository.
    * fromkey: Create an unlocked file when used in an adjusted branch
      where the file should be unlocked, or when configured by annex.addunlocked.
    * Fix behavior of several commands, including reinject, addurl, and rmurl
      when given an absolute path to an unlocked file, or a relative path
      that leaves and re-enters the repository.
    * smudge: Fix a case where an unlocked annexed file that annex.largefiles
      does not match could get its unchanged content checked into git,
      due to git running the smudge filter unecessarily.
    * reinject: Error out when run on a file that is not annexed, rather
      than silently skipping it.
    * assistant: Fix a crash on startup by avoiding using forkProcess.
    * init: When annex.commitmessage is set, use that message for the commit
      that creates the git-annex branch.
    * Added annex.adviceNoSshCaching config.
    * Added --size-limit option.
    * Future proof activity log parsing.
    * Fix an exponential slowdown when large numbers of duplicate files are
      being added in unlocked form.

    * New annex.private and remote.name.annex-private configs that can
      prevent storing information about a repository and remotes in the
      git-annex branch.
    * initremote: Added --private option to set up a private special remote.
    * importfeed: Made "checking known urls" phase run 12 times faster.
    * Added --debugfilter (and annex.debugfilter)
    * diffdriver: Support unlocked files.
    * forget: Preserve currently exported trees, avoiding problems with
      exporttree remotes in some unusual circumstances.
    * fsck: When downloading content from a remote, if the content is able
      to be verified during the transfer, skip checksumming it a second time.
    * directory: When cp supports reflinks, use it.
    * Avoid excess commits to the git-annex branch when stall detection is
      enabled.
    * git-annex-config: Allow setting annex.securehashesonly, which has
      otherwise been supported since 2019, but was missing from the list of
      allowed repo-global configs.
    * init: Fix a crash when the repo's was cloned from a repo that had an
      adjusted branch checked out, and the origin remote is not named "origin".
    * Fix some bugs that made git-annex not see recently recorded status
      information when configured with annex.alwayscommit=false.
    * When mincopies is set to a larger value than numcopies, make sure that
      mincopies is satisfied. Before, it assumed a sane configuration would
      have numcopies larger or equal to mincopies. It's still a good idea
      not to configure git-annex this way.

    * Behavior change: When autoenabling special remotes of type S3, weddav,
      or glacier, do not take login credentials from environment variables,
      as the user may not be expecting the autoenable to happen, or may
      have those set for other purposes and not intend git-annex to use them.
    * New annex.supportunlocked config that can be set to false to avoid
      some expensive things needed to support unlocked files, if you do not
      use them.
    * Fix bug importing from a special remote into a subdirectory more than
      one level deep, which generated unusual git trees that could confuse
      git merge.
    * borg: Fix a bug that prevented importing keys of type URL and WORM.
    * borg: Support importing files that are hard linked in the borg backup.
    * export: When a submodule is in the tree to be exported, skip it.
    * import: When the previously exported tree contained a submodule,
      preserve it in the imported tree so it does not get deleted.
    * export --json: Fill in the file field.
    * rmurl: When youtube-dl was used for an url, it no longer needs to be
      prefixed with "yt:" in order to be removed.
    * rmurl: If an url is both used by the web and also claimed by another
      special remote, fix a bug that caused the url to to not be removed.
    * unregisterurl: Fix a bug that caused an url to not be unregistered
      when it is claimed by a special remote other than the web.

    * When non-annexed files in a tree are exported to a special remote,
      importing from the special remote keeps the files non-annexed,
      as long as their content has not changed, rather than converting
      them to annexed files.
      (Such a conversion will still happen when importing from a remote
      an old git-annex exported such a tree to before; export the tree
      with the new git-annex before importing to avoid that.)
    * Added support for git-remote-gcrypt's rsync URIs, which access a remote
      using rsync over ssh, and which git pushes to much more efficiently
      than ssh urls.
    * unregisterurl: New command.
    * registerurl: Allow it to be used in a bare repository.
    * Prevent combinations of options such as --all with --include.
    * Fixed handling of --mimetype or --mimeencoding combined with
      options like --all or --unused.
    * Fix handling of --branch combined with --unlocked or --locked.
    * Fix support for local gcrypt repositories with a space in their URI.
    * uninit: Fix a small bug that left a lock file in .git/annex

    * annex.stalldetection can now be set to "true" to make git-annex
      do automatic stall detection when it detects a remote is updating its
      transfer progress consistently enough for stall detection to work.
    * When annex.stalldetection is not enabled and a likely stall is
      detected, display a suggestion to enable it.
    * Commands can be added to git-annex, by installing a program in PATH
      with a name starting with "git-annex-"
    * Fix a reversion that made import of a tree from a special remote
      result in a merge that deleted files that were not preferred content
      of that special remote.
    * Bugfix: fsck --from a ssh remote did not actually check that the
      content on the remote is not corrupted.
    * unannex, uninit: When an annexed file is modified, don't overwrite
      the modified version with an older version from the annex.
    * When adding files to an adjusted branch set up by --unlock-present,
      add them unlocked, not locked.
    * Fix an oddity in matching options and preferred content expressions
      such as "foo (bar or baz)", which was incorrectly handled as if
      it were "(foo or bar) and baz)" rather than the intended
      "foo and (bar or baz)"
    * Checksum as content is received from a remote git-annex repository,
      rather than doing it in a second pass.
    * Tahoe: Avoid verifying hash after download, since tahoe does sufficient
      verification itself.
    * unannex, uninit: Don't run git rm once per annexed file,
      for a large speedup.
    * When a git remote is configured with an absolute path, use that
      path, rather than making it relative.
    * get: Improve output when failing to get a file fails.
    * Fix build on openbsd.
      Thanks, James Cook for the patch.

  git-annex (8.20210127) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added mincopies configuration. This is like numcopies, but is
      enforced even more strictly. While numcopies can be violated in
      concurrent drop situations involving special remotes that do not
      support locking, mincopies cannot be. The default value has always
      been 1, but now it can be set to higher values if desired.
    * Behavior change: When numcopies is set to 0, git-annex used to drop
      content without requiring any copies. Now to get that (highly unsafe)
      behavior, mincopies also needs to be set to 0.
    * Behavior change: git-annex trust now needs --force, since unconsidered
      use of trusted repositories can lead to data loss.
    * Behavior change: --trust and --trust-glacier options no longer overrides
      trust, since that can lead to data loss, which should never be enabled
      by an option other than --force.
    * add: Significantly speed up adding lots of non-large files to git,
      by disabling the annex smudge filter when running git add.
    * add --force-small: Run git add rather than updating the index itself,
      so any other smudge filters than the annex one that may be enabled will
      be used.
    * Fix --time-limit, which got broken in several ways by some optimisations
      in version 8.20201007.
    * When syncing changes back from an adjusted branch to the basis branch,
      include deletions of submodules.
      Thanks, Kyle Meyer for the patch.
    * Bug fix: export with -J could fail when two files had the same content.
    * Bug fix: Fix tilde expansion in ssh urls when the tilde is the last
      character in the url.
      Thanks, Grond for the patch.
    * Avoid crashing when there are remotes using unparseable urls.
      Including the non-standard URI form that git-remote-gcrypt uses for rsync.
    * Directory special remotes with importtree=yes now avoid unncessary
      hashing when inodes of files have changed, as happens whenever a FAT
      filesystem gets remounted.
    * Fix a bug that prevented git-annex init from working in a submodule.
    * Fix a bug in view filename generation when a metadata value ended with
      "/" (or ":" or "\" on Windows)
    * adjust: Fix some bad behavior when unlocked files use URL keys.
    * smudge: Fix some bad behavior when git add is run on an unlocked
      file that used an URL key.
    * Added GETGITREMOTENAME to external special remote protocol.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20201129.
  git-annex (8.20201129) upstream; urgency=medium

    * New borg special remote. This is a new kind of remote, that examines
      borg backups of git-annex repositories, learns what files have been
      backed up, and can restore files from the backup and so on. As well
      as backups, it can be useful for archival storage, since borg can
      efficiently store many related versions of files.
    * New config annex.stalldetection, remote.name.annex-stalldetection,
      which can be used to deal with remotes that stall during transfers,
      or are sometimes too slow to want to use.
    * Support special remotes that are configured with importtree=yes but
      without exporttree=yes.
    * Fix bug that made the next download after an empty file from a ssh
      or tor remote fail.
    * Avoid spurious "verification of content failed" message when downloading
      content from a ssh or tor remote fails due to the remote no longer
      having a copy of the content.
    * Fix bug that matched include= and exclude= in preferred/required content
      expressions relative to the current directory, rather than the path
      from the top of the repository.
      (Reversion introduced in version 8.20201116.)
    * Fix hang on shutdown of external special remote using ASYNC protocol
      extension.
      (Reversion introduced in version 8.20201007.)
    * Guard against running in a repo where annex.uuid is set but
      annex.version is not set, or vice-versa.
    * Avoid autoinit when a repo does not have annex.version or annex.uuid
      set, but has a git-annex objects directory, suggesting it was used
      by git-annex before, and the git config may have been lost.
    * importfeed: Avoid using youtube-dl when a feed does not contain an
      enclosure, but only a link to an url which youtube-dl does not support.
    * initremote: Prevent enabling encryption with exporttree=yes or
      importtree=yes.
    * Windows: include= and exclude= containing '/' will also match filenames
      that are written using '\'. (And vice-versa, but it's better to use '/'
      for portability.)
    * Fix a bug that could prevent getting files from an importtree=yes
      remote, because the imported tree was allowed to be garbage collected.
    * stack.yaml: Updated to lts-16.27.

      branches set up by git-annex adjust --unlock-present/--hide-missing.
    * Fix hang when an external special remote program exited but
      the stderr pipe to it was left open, due to a daemon having inherited
      the file descriptor.
    * Fix a bug that could make resuming a download from the web fail
      when the entire content of the file is actually already present

    * Fix building without the torrent library.
      Thanks, Kyle Meyer.
    * Fix build on Windows.
    * Prevent windows assistant from trying (and failing) to upgrade
      itself, which has never been supported on windows.

    * move: Fix a regression in the last release that made move --to not
      honor numcopies settings.
    * sync --content: Fix a bug where a file that was not preferred content
      could be transferred to a remote. This happened when the file got deleted
      after the sync started running.
    * Warn when adding a annex symlink or pointer file that uses a key that

- Update git-annex to version 8.20201007.
  git-annex (8.20201007) upstream; urgency=medium

    * --json output now includes a new field "input" which is the input
      value (filename, url, etc) that caused a json object to be output.
    * --batch combined with -J now runs batch requests concurrently for many
      commands. Before, the combination was accepted, but did not enable
      concurrency. Since the output of batch requests can be in any order,
      --json with the new "input" field is recommended to be used,
      to determine which batch request each response corresponds to.
    * aws-0.22 improved its support for setting etags, which improves
      support for versioned S3 buckets.
    * Serialize use of C magic library, which is not thread safe.
      This fixes failures uploading to S3 when using -J.
    * add, addurl, importfeed, import: Added --no-check-gitignore option
      for finer grained control than using --force.
    * import: Check gitignores when importing trees from special remotes.
    * addunused: Don't check .gitignores when adding files.
    * Improve the "Try making some of these repositories available"
      message, with some hints for the user for what to do.
    * Improve --debug output to show pid of processes that are started and
      stopped.
    * sync --all: Sped up seeking to around twice as fast, by avoiding a
      pass over the worktree files when preferred content expressions of the
      local repo and remotes don't use include=/exclude=.
    * Sped up seeking for files to operate on, when using options like
      --copies or --in, by around 20%
    * import --no-content: Check annex.largefiles, and import small
      files into git, the same as is done when importing with content.
      If the largefiles expression needs the file content available
      (due to mimetype or mimeencoding being used), the import will fail.
    * sync: When run without --content, import without copying from
      importtree=yes directory special remotes.
      (Other special remotes may support this later as well.)
    * addurl: Avoid a redundant git ignores check for speed.
    * upgrade: Avoid an upgrade failure of a bare repo in unusual circumstances.
    * httpalso: Support being used with special remotes that do not have
      encryption= in their config.
    * Parse youtube-dl progress output, which lets progress be displayed
      when doing concurrent downloads.
    * Fix build with Benchmark build flag.
    * Enable building with git-annex benchmark by default, only turning it
      off when the criterion library is not installed.
    * runshell: Fix a edge case where rm errors were sent to stdout, which
      could confuse things parsing git-annex output.
    * runshell: Update files atomically when preparing to run git-annex.
    * Fix a build failure on Windows.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20200810.
  git-annex (8.20200810) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added support for external backend programs. So if you want a hash
      that git-annex doesn't support, or something stranger, you can write a
      small program to implement it.
    * Fix a bug in find --branch in the previous version.
    * importfeed: Fix reversion that caused some '.' in filenames to be
      replaced with '_'
    * Fix a lock file descriptor leak that could occur when running commands
      like git-annex add with -J. Bug was introduced as part of a different FD
      leak fix in version 6.20160318.
    * Fix a hang when using git-annex with an old openssh 7.2p2, which had
      some weird inheriting of ssh FDs by sshd. Bug was introduced in
      git-annex version 7.20200202.7.
    * move, copy --to: Sped up seeking files by 2x.
    * drop: Sped up seeking files to drop by 2x, and also some performance
      improvements to checking numcopies.
    * Deal with unusual IFS settings in the shell scripts for linux
      standalone and OSX app.
      Thanks, Yaroslav Halchenko
    * Avoid complaining that a file with "is beyond a symbolic link"
      when the filepath is absolute and the symlink in question is not
      actually inside the git repository.
    * Slightly sped up the linux standalone bundle.
    * Support building with dlist-1.0

  git-annex (8.20200720) upstream; urgency=medium

    * import: Added --no-content option, which avoids downloading files
      from a special remote. Currently only supported by the directory
      special remote.
    * Honor annex.largefiles when importing a tree from a special remote.
      (Except for when --no-content is used.)
    * Fix a deadlock that could occur after git-annex got an unlocked
      file, causing the command to hang indefinitely. Known to happen on
      vfat filesystems, possibly others.
    * Build with the http-client-restricted and git-lfs libraries when
      available, otherwise use the vendored copy as before.
    * testremote: Fix over-allocation of resources and bad caching,
      including starting up a large number of external special remote processes.
      (Regression introduced in version 8.20200501)
    * test: Fix some test cases that assumed git's default branch name.
    * importfeed: Added some additional --template variables:
      itempubyear, itempubmonth, itempubday, itempubhour,
      itempubminute, itempubsecond.
    * Made several special remotes support locking content on them,
      which allows dropping from other special remotes in some situations
      where it was not possible before. Supported special remotes:
      S3 (with versioning=yes), git-lfs, tahoe
    * Fix reversion that broke passing annex.* and remote.*.annex-*
      git configs with -c. (Since version 8.20200330.)
    * Bring back git-annex branch read cache. This speeds up some operations,
      eg git-annex sync --content --all gets 20% faster.
    * Fix a recently introduced bug that could cause a "fork: resource exhausted"
      after getting several thousand files.
    * Sped up the --all option by 2x to 16x by using git cat-file --buffer.
      Thanks to Lukey for finding this optimisation.
    * Sped up seeking for annexed files to operate on by a factor of nearly 2x.
    * Sped up sync --content by 2x and other commands like fsck --fast and
      whereis by around 50%, by using git cat-file --buffer.
    * importfeed: Made checking known urls step around 15% faster.
    * fsck: Detect if WORM keys contain a carriage return, and recommend
      upgrading the key. (git-annex could have maybe created such keys back
      in 2013).
    * When on an adjust --hide-missing branch, fix handling of files that
      have been deleted but the deletion is not yet staged.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20200617.
  git-annex (8.20200617) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added annex.skipunknown git config, that can be set to false to change
      the behavior of commands like `git annex get foo*`, to not skip
      over files/dirs that are not checked into git and are explicitly listed in
      the command line.
    * annex.skipunknown is planned to change to default to false in a
      git-annex release in early 2022. If you prefer the current behavior,
      you can explicitly set it to true.
    * Try to enable special remotes configured with autoenable=yes
      when git-annex auto-initialization happens in a new clone of an
      existing repo. Previously, git-annex init had to be explicitly run to
      enable them. Special remotes cannot display anything when autoenabled
      this way, to avoid interfering with the output of git-annex query
      commands.
    * export: Added options for json output.
    * import: Added --json-progress.
    * addurl: Make --preserve-filename also apply when eg a torrent contains
      multiple files.
    * Fix a crash or potentially not all files being exported when
      sync -J --content is used with an export remote.
    * export: Let concurrent transfers be done with -J or annex.jobs.
    * move --to, copy --to, mirror --to: When concurrency is enabled, run
      cleanup actions in separate job pool from uploads.
    * init: If lock probing stalls for a long time (eg a broken NFS server),
      display a message to let the user know what's taking so long.
    * init: When annex.pidlock is set, skip lock probing.
    * Fix file descriptor leak when importing from a directory special remote
      that is configured with exporttree=yes.
    * Note that external special remote programs should not block SIGINT or
      SIGTERM.
    * Avoid creating the keys database during init when there are no unlocked
      files, to prevent init failing when sqlite does not work in the
      filesystem.
    * import: Avoid using some strange names for temporary keys,
      which broke importing from a directory special remote onto a vfat
      filesystem.
    * S3: The REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class is no longer cheaper so
      stop documenting it, and stop offering it as a choice in the assistant.
    * Improve display of problems auto-initializing or upgrading local git
      remotes.
    * When a local git remote cannot be initialized because it has no
      git-annex branch or a .noannex file, avoid displaying a message about it.
    * checkpresentkey: When no remote is specified, try all remotes, not
      only ones that the location log says contain the key. This is what
      the documentation has always said it did.
    * Fix regression in external special remote handling: GETCONFIG did not
      return a value that was set with SETCONFIG immediately before.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix bug that made initremote of extrnal special remotes with
      embedcreds=yes or gpg encryption not store the creds in the git-annex
      branch. git-annex-remote-googledrive one was special remote affected by
      this bug.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix bug that made creds not be stored in git when a special remote
      was initialized with gpg encryption, but without an explicit
      embedcreds=yes.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix a annex.pidlock issue that made eg git-annex get of an unlocked
      file hang until the annex.pidlocktimeout and then fail.
