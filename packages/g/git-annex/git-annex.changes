- Update git-annex to version 8.20210428.
  git-annex (8.20210428) upstream; urgency=medium

    * New annex.private and remote.name.annex-private configs that can
      prevent storing information about a repository and remotes in the
      git-annex branch.
    * initremote: Added --private option to set up a private special remote.
    * importfeed: Made "checking known urls" phase run 12 times faster.
    * Added --debugfilter (and annex.debugfilter)
    * diffdriver: Support unlocked files.
    * forget: Preserve currently exported trees, avoiding problems with
      exporttree remotes in some unusual circumstances.
    * fsck: When downloading content from a remote, if the content is able
      to be verified during the transfer, skip checksumming it a second time.
    * directory: When cp supports reflinks, use it.
    * Avoid excess commits to the git-annex branch when stall detection is
      enabled.
    * git-annex-config: Allow setting annex.securehashesonly, which has
      otherwise been supported since 2019, but was missing from the list of
      allowed repo-global configs.
    * init: Fix a crash when the repo's was cloned from a repo that had an
      adjusted branch checked out, and the origin remote is not named "origin".
    * Fix some bugs that made git-annex not see recently recorded status
      information when configured with annex.alwayscommit=false.
    * When mincopies is set to a larger value than numcopies, make sure that
      mincopies is satisfied. Before, it assumed a sane configuration would
      have numcopies larger or equal to mincopies. It's still a good idea
      not to configure git-annex this way.
    * Avoid more than 1 gpg password prompt at the same time, which
      could happen occasionally before when concurrency is enabled.
    * Fix build with persistent-2.12.0.1

- Update git-annex to version 8.20210330.
  git-annex (8.20210330) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Behavior change: When autoenabling special remotes of type S3, weddav,
      or glacier, do not take login credentials from environment variables,
      as the user may not be expecting the autoenable to happen, or may
      have those set for other purposes and not intend git-annex to use them.
    * New annex.supportunlocked config that can be set to false to avoid
      some expensive things needed to support unlocked files, if you do not
      use them.
    * Fix bug importing from a special remote into a subdirectory more than
      one level deep, which generated unusual git trees that could confuse
      git merge.
    * borg: Fix a bug that prevented importing keys of type URL and WORM.
    * borg: Support importing files that are hard linked in the borg backup.
    * export: When a submodule is in the tree to be exported, skip it.
    * import: When the previously exported tree contained a submodule,
      preserve it in the imported tree so it does not get deleted.
    * export --json: Fill in the file field.
    * rmurl: When youtube-dl was used for an url, it no longer needs to be
      prefixed with "yt:" in order to be removed.
    * rmurl: If an url is both used by the web and also claimed by another
      special remote, fix a bug that caused the url to to not be removed.
    * unregisterurl: Fix a bug that caused an url to not be unregistered
      when it is claimed by a special remote other than the web.
    * whereis: Don't include yt: prefix when showing url to content
      retrieved with youtube-dl.
    * webdav: Work around some buggy webdav server behavior involving
      renaming files.
    * Make --debug also enable debugging in child git-annex processes.
    * fsck: When --from is used in combination with --all or similar options,
      do not verify required content, which can't be checked properly when
      operating on keys.
    * Sped up git-annex init in a clone of an existing repository.
    * Improved display of errors when accessing a git http remote fails.
    * Fix build with attoparsec-0.14.

Thu Mar 11 08:23:16 UTC 2021 - psimons@suse.com

- Update git-annex to version 8.20210310.
  git-annex (8.20210310) upstream; urgency=medium

    * When non-annexed files in a tree are exported to a special remote,
      importing from the special remote keeps the files non-annexed,
      as long as their content has not changed, rather than converting
      them to annexed files.
      (Such a conversion will still happen when importing from a remote
      an old git-annex exported such a tree to before; export the tree
      with the new git-annex before importing to avoid that.)
    * Added support for git-remote-gcrypt's rsync URIs, which access a remote
      using rsync over ssh, and which git pushes to much more efficiently
      than ssh urls.
    * unregisterurl: New command.
    * registerurl: Allow it to be used in a bare repository.
    * Prevent combinations of options such as --all with --include.
    * Fixed handling of --mimetype or --mimeencoding combined with
      options like --all or --unused.
    * Fix handling of --branch combined with --unlocked or --locked.
    * Fix support for local gcrypt repositories with a space in their URI.
    * uninit: Fix a small bug that left a lock file in .git/annex
    * Windows: Correct the path to the html help file for 64 bit build.
    * OSX dmg: Updated bundled git to 2.30.2 which fixes CVE-2021-21300.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20210223.
  git-annex (8.20210223) upstream; urgency=medium

    * annex.stalldetection can now be set to "true" to make git-annex
      do automatic stall detection when it detects a remote is updating its
      transfer progress consistently enough for stall detection to work.
    * When annex.stalldetection is not enabled and a likely stall is
      detected, display a suggestion to enable it.
    * Commands can be added to git-annex, by installing a program in PATH
      with a name starting with "git-annex-"
    * Fix a reversion that made import of a tree from a special remote
      result in a merge that deleted files that were not preferred content
      of that special remote.
    * Bugfix: fsck --from a ssh remote did not actually check that the
      content on the remote is not corrupted.
    * unannex, uninit: When an annexed file is modified, don't overwrite
      the modified version with an older version from the annex.
    * When adding files to an adjusted branch set up by --unlock-present,
      add them unlocked, not locked.
    * Fix an oddity in matching options and preferred content expressions
      such as "foo (bar or baz)", which was incorrectly handled as if
      it were "(foo or bar) and baz)" rather than the intended
      "foo and (bar or baz)"
    * Checksum as content is received from a remote git-annex repository,
      rather than doing it in a second pass.
    * Tahoe: Avoid verifying hash after download, since tahoe does sufficient
      verification itself.
    * unannex, uninit: Don't run git rm once per annexed file,
      for a large speedup.
    * When a git remote is configured with an absolute path, use that
      path, rather than making it relative.
    * get: Improve output when failing to get a file fails.
    * Fix build on openbsd.
      Thanks, James Cook for the patch.
    * Include libkqueue.h file needed to build the assistant on BSDs.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20210127.
  git-annex (8.20210127) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added mincopies configuration. This is like numcopies, but is
      enforced even more strictly. While numcopies can be violated in
      concurrent drop situations involving special remotes that do not
      support locking, mincopies cannot be. The default value has always
      been 1, but now it can be set to higher values if desired.
    * Behavior change: When numcopies is set to 0, git-annex used to drop
      content without requiring any copies. Now to get that (highly unsafe)
      behavior, mincopies also needs to be set to 0.
    * Behavior change: git-annex trust now needs --force, since unconsidered
      use of trusted repositories can lead to data loss.
    * Behavior change: --trust and --trust-glacier options no longer overrides
      trust, since that can lead to data loss, which should never be enabled
      by an option other than --force.
    * add: Significantly speed up adding lots of non-large files to git,
      by disabling the annex smudge filter when running git add.
    * add --force-small: Run git add rather than updating the index itself,
      so any other smudge filters than the annex one that may be enabled will
      be used.
    * Fix --time-limit, which got broken in several ways by some optimisations
      in version 8.20201007.
    * When syncing changes back from an adjusted branch to the basis branch,
      include deletions of submodules.
      Thanks, Kyle Meyer for the patch.
    * Bug fix: export with -J could fail when two files had the same content.
    * Bug fix: Fix tilde expansion in ssh urls when the tilde is the last
      character in the url.
      Thanks, Grond for the patch.
    * Avoid crashing when there are remotes using unparseable urls.
      Including the non-standard URI form that git-remote-gcrypt uses for rsync.
    * Directory special remotes with importtree=yes now avoid unncessary
      hashing when inodes of files have changed, as happens whenever a FAT
      filesystem gets remounted.
    * Fix a bug that prevented git-annex init from working in a submodule.
    * Fix a bug in view filename generation when a metadata value ended with
      "/" (or ":" or "\" on Windows)
    * adjust: Fix some bad behavior when unlocked files use URL keys.
    * smudge: Fix some bad behavior when git add is run on an unlocked
      file that used an URL key.
    * Added GETGITREMOTENAME to external special remote protocol.
    * Windows: Work around win32 length limits when dealing with lock files.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20201129.
  git-annex (8.20201129) upstream; urgency=medium

    * New borg special remote. This is a new kind of remote, that examines
      borg backups of git-annex repositories, learns what files have been
      backed up, and can restore files from the backup and so on. As well
      as backups, it can be useful for archival storage, since borg can
      efficiently store many related versions of files.
    * New config annex.stalldetection, remote.name.annex-stalldetection,
      which can be used to deal with remotes that stall during transfers,
      or are sometimes too slow to want to use.
    * Support special remotes that are configured with importtree=yes but
      without exporttree=yes.
    * Fix bug that made the next download after an empty file from a ssh
      or tor remote fail.
    * Avoid spurious "verification of content failed" message when downloading
      content from a ssh or tor remote fails due to the remote no longer
      having a copy of the content.
    * Fix bug that matched include= and exclude= in preferred/required content
      expressions relative to the current directory, rather than the path
      from the top of the repository.
      (Reversion introduced in version 8.20201116.)
    * Fix hang on shutdown of external special remote using ASYNC protocol
      extension.
      (Reversion introduced in version 8.20201007.)
    * Guard against running in a repo where annex.uuid is set but
      annex.version is not set, or vice-versa.
    * Avoid autoinit when a repo does not have annex.version or annex.uuid
      set, but has a git-annex objects directory, suggesting it was used
      by git-annex before, and the git config may have been lost.
    * importfeed: Avoid using youtube-dl when a feed does not contain an
      enclosure, but only a link to an url which youtube-dl does not support.
    * initremote: Prevent enabling encryption with exporttree=yes or
      importtree=yes.
    * Windows: include= and exclude= containing '/' will also match filenames
      that are written using '\'. (And vice-versa, but it's better to use '/'
      for portability.)
    * Fix a bug that could prevent getting files from an importtree=yes
      remote, because the imported tree was allowed to be garbage collected.
    * stack.yaml: Updated to lts-16.27.

  git-annex (8.20201127) upstream; urgency=medium

    * adjust: New --unlock-present mode which locks files whose content is not
      present (so the broken symlink is visible), while unlocking files whose
      content is present.
    * Added annex.adjustedbranchrefresh git config to update adjusted
      branches set up by git-annex adjust --unlock-present/--hide-missing.
    * Fix hang when an external special remote program exited but
      the stderr pipe to it was left open, due to a daemon having inherited
      the file descriptor.
    * Fix a bug that could make resuming a download from the web fail
      when the entire content of the file is actually already present
      locally.
    * examinekey: Added a "file" format variable for consistency with find,
      and for easier scripting.
    * init: When writing hook scripts, set all execute bits, not only
      the user execute bit.
    * upgrade: Support an edge case upgrading a v5 direct mode repo
      where nothing had ever been committed to the head branch.
    * Made the test suite significantly less noisy, only displaying command
      output when something failed.
    * Fix building without the torrent library.
      Thanks, Kyle Meyer.
    * Fix build on Windows.
    * Prevent windows assistant from trying (and failing) to upgrade
      itself, which has never been supported on windows.

    * Warn when adding a annex symlink or pointer file that uses a key that

    * --json output now includes a new field "input" which is the input
      value (filename, url, etc) that caused a json object to be output.
    * --batch combined with -J now runs batch requests concurrently for many
      commands. Before, the combination was accepted, but did not enable
      concurrency. Since the output of batch requests can be in any order,
      --json with the new "input" field is recommended to be used,
      to determine which batch request each response corresponds to.
    * aws-0.22 improved its support for setting etags, which improves
      support for versioned S3 buckets.
    * Serialize use of C magic library, which is not thread safe.
      This fixes failures uploading to S3 when using -J.
    * add, addurl, importfeed, import: Added --no-check-gitignore option
      for finer grained control than using --force.
    * import: Check gitignores when importing trees from special remotes.
    * addunused: Don't check .gitignores when adding files.
    * Improve the "Try making some of these repositories available"
      message, with some hints for the user for what to do.
    * Improve --debug output to show pid of processes that are started and
      stopped.
    * sync --all: Sped up seeking to around twice as fast, by avoiding a
      pass over the worktree files when preferred content expressions of the
      local repo and remotes don't use include=/exclude=.
    * Sped up seeking for files to operate on, when using options like
      --copies or --in, by around 20%
    * import --no-content: Check annex.largefiles, and import small
      files into git, the same as is done when importing with content.
      If the largefiles expression needs the file content available
      (due to mimetype or mimeencoding being used), the import will fail.
    * sync: When run without --content, import without copying from
      importtree=yes directory special remotes.
      (Other special remotes may support this later as well.)
    * addurl: Avoid a redundant git ignores check for speed.
    * upgrade: Avoid an upgrade failure of a bare repo in unusual circumstances.
    * httpalso: Support being used with special remotes that do not have
      encryption= in their config.
    * Parse youtube-dl progress output, which lets progress be displayed
      when doing concurrent downloads.
    * Fix build with Benchmark build flag.
    * Enable building with git-annex benchmark by default, only turning it
      off when the criterion library is not installed.
    * runshell: Fix a edge case where rm errors were sent to stdout, which
      could confuse things parsing git-annex output.
    * runshell: Update files atomically when preparing to run git-annex.
    * Fix a build failure on Windows.

    * import: Added --no-content option, which avoids downloading files
      from a special remote. Currently only supported by the directory
      special remote.
    * Honor annex.largefiles when importing a tree from a special remote.
      (Except for when --no-content is used.)
    * Fix a deadlock that could occur after git-annex got an unlocked
      file, causing the command to hang indefinitely. Known to happen on
      vfat filesystems, possibly others.
    * Build with the http-client-restricted and git-lfs libraries when
      available, otherwise use the vendored copy as before.
    * testremote: Fix over-allocation of resources and bad caching,
      including starting up a large number of external special remote processes.

      itempubminute, itempubsecond.
    * Made several special remotes support locking content on them,
      which allows dropping from other special remotes in some situations
      where it was not possible before. Supported special remotes:
      S3 (with versioning=yes), git-lfs, tahoe
    * Fix reversion that broke passing annex.* and remote.*.annex-*
      git configs with -c. (Since version 8.20200330.)
    * Bring back git-annex branch read cache. This speeds up some operations,
      eg git-annex sync --content --all gets 20% faster.
    * Fix a recently introduced bug that could cause a "fork: resource exhausted"
      after getting several thousand files.
    * Sped up the --all option by 2x to 16x by using git cat-file --buffer.
      Thanks to Lukey for finding this optimisation.
    * Sped up seeking for annexed files to operate on by a factor of nearly 2x.
    * Sped up sync --content by 2x and other commands like fsck --fast and
      whereis by around 50%, by using git cat-file --buffer.
    * importfeed: Made checking known urls step around 15% faster.
    * fsck: Detect if WORM keys contain a carriage return, and recommend
      upgrading the key. (git-annex could have maybe created such keys back
      in 2013).
    * When on an adjust --hide-missing branch, fix handling of files that
      have been deleted but the deletion is not yet staged.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20200617.
  git-annex (8.20200617) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added annex.skipunknown git config, that can be set to false to change
      the behavior of commands like `git annex get foo*`, to not skip
      over files/dirs that are not checked into git and are explicitly listed in
      the command line.
    * annex.skipunknown is planned to change to default to false in a
      git-annex release in early 2022. If you prefer the current behavior,
      you can explicitly set it to true.
    * Try to enable special remotes configured with autoenable=yes
      when git-annex auto-initialization happens in a new clone of an
      existing repo. Previously, git-annex init had to be explicitly run to
      enable them. Special remotes cannot display anything when autoenabled
      this way, to avoid interfering with the output of git-annex query
      commands.
    * export: Added options for json output.
    * import: Added --json-progress.
    * addurl: Make --preserve-filename also apply when eg a torrent contains
      multiple files.
    * Fix a crash or potentially not all files being exported when
      sync -J --content is used with an export remote.
    * export: Let concurrent transfers be done with -J or annex.jobs.
    * move --to, copy --to, mirror --to: When concurrency is enabled, run
      cleanup actions in separate job pool from uploads.
    * init: If lock probing stalls for a long time (eg a broken NFS server),
      display a message to let the user know what's taking so long.
    * init: When annex.pidlock is set, skip lock probing.
    * Fix file descriptor leak when importing from a directory special remote
      that is configured with exporttree=yes.
    * Note that external special remote programs should not block SIGINT or
      SIGTERM.
    * Avoid creating the keys database during init when there are no unlocked
      files, to prevent init failing when sqlite does not work in the
      filesystem.
    * import: Avoid using some strange names for temporary keys,
      which broke importing from a directory special remote onto a vfat
      filesystem.
    * S3: The REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class is no longer cheaper so
      stop documenting it, and stop offering it as a choice in the assistant.
    * Improve display of problems auto-initializing or upgrading local git
      remotes.
    * When a local git remote cannot be initialized because it has no
      git-annex branch or a .noannex file, avoid displaying a message about it.
    * checkpresentkey: When no remote is specified, try all remotes, not
      only ones that the location log says contain the key. This is what
      the documentation has always said it did.
    * Fix regression in external special remote handling: GETCONFIG did not
      return a value that was set with SETCONFIG immediately before.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix bug that made initremote of extrnal special remotes with
      embedcreds=yes or gpg encryption not store the creds in the git-annex
      branch. git-annex-remote-googledrive one was special remote affected by
      this bug.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix bug that made creds not be stored in git when a special remote
      was initialized with gpg encryption, but without an explicit
      embedcreds=yes.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix a annex.pidlock issue that made eg git-annex get of an unlocked
      file hang until the annex.pidlocktimeout and then fail.
