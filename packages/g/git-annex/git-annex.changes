- Update git-annex to version 8.20200617.
  git-annex (8.20200617) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added annex.skipunknown git config, that can be set to false to change
      the behavior of commands like `git annex get foo*`, to not skip
      over files/dirs that are not checked into git and are explicitly listed in
      the command line.
    * annex.skipunknown is planned to change to default to false in a
      git-annex release in early 2022. If you prefer the current behavior,
      you can explicitly set it to true.
    * Try to enable special remotes configured with autoenable=yes
      when git-annex auto-initialization happens in a new clone of an
      existing repo. Previously, git-annex init had to be explicitly run to
      enable them. Special remotes cannot display anything when autoenabled
      this way, to avoid interfering with the output of git-annex query
      commands.
    * export: Added options for json output.
    * import: Added --json-progress.
    * addurl: Make --preserve-filename also apply when eg a torrent contains
      multiple files.
    * Fix a crash or potentially not all files being exported when
      sync -J --content is used with an export remote.
    * export: Let concurrent transfers be done with -J or annex.jobs.
    * move --to, copy --to, mirror --to: When concurrency is enabled, run
      cleanup actions in separate job pool from uploads.
    * init: If lock probing stalls for a long time (eg a broken NFS server),
      display a message to let the user know what's taking so long.
    * init: When annex.pidlock is set, skip lock probing.
    * Fix file descriptor leak when importing from a directory special remote
      that is configured with exporttree=yes.
    * Note that external special remote programs should not block SIGINT or
      SIGTERM.
    * Avoid creating the keys database during init when there are no unlocked
      files, to prevent init failing when sqlite does not work in the
      filesystem.
    * import: Avoid using some strange names for temporary keys,
      which broke importing from a directory special remote onto a vfat
      filesystem.
    * S3: The REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class is no longer cheaper so
      stop documenting it, and stop offering it as a choice in the assistant.
    * Improve display of problems auto-initializing or upgrading local git
      remotes.
    * When a local git remote cannot be initialized because it has no
      git-annex branch or a .noannex file, avoid displaying a message about it.
    * checkpresentkey: When no remote is specified, try all remotes, not
      only ones that the location log says contain the key. This is what
      the documentation has always said it did.
    * Fix regression in external special remote handling: GETCONFIG did not
      return a value that was set with SETCONFIG immediately before.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix bug that made initremote of extrnal special remotes with
      embedcreds=yes or gpg encryption not store the creds in the git-annex
      branch. git-annex-remote-googledrive one was special remote affected by
      this bug.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix bug that made creds not be stored in git when a special remote
      was initialized with gpg encryption, but without an explicit
      embedcreds=yes.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix a annex.pidlock issue that made eg git-annex get of an unlocked
      file hang until the annex.pidlocktimeout and then fail.
