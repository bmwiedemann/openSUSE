- Update git-annex to version 8.20200908.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:

- Update git-annex to version 8.20200810.
  git-annex (8.20200810) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added support for external backend programs. So if you want a hash
      that git-annex doesn't support, or something stranger, you can write a
      small program to implement it.
    * Fix a bug in find --branch in the previous version.
    * importfeed: Fix reversion that caused some '.' in filenames to be
      replaced with '_'
    * Fix a lock file descriptor leak that could occur when running commands
      like git-annex add with -J. Bug was introduced as part of a different FD
      leak fix in version 6.20160318.
    * Fix a hang when using git-annex with an old openssh 7.2p2, which had
      some weird inheriting of ssh FDs by sshd. Bug was introduced in
      git-annex version 7.20200202.7.
    * move, copy --to: Sped up seeking files by 2x.
    * drop: Sped up seeking files to drop by 2x, and also some performance
      improvements to checking numcopies.
    * Deal with unusual IFS settings in the shell scripts for linux
      standalone and OSX app.
      Thanks, Yaroslav Halchenko
    * Avoid complaining that a file with "is beyond a symbolic link"
      when the filepath is absolute and the symlink in question is not
      actually inside the git repository.
    * Slightly sped up the linux standalone bundle.
    * Support building with dlist-1.0

- Drop obsolete 0001-fix-build-with-dlist-1.0.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  6 07:58:47 UTC 2020 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Apply 0001-fix-build-with-dlist-1.0.patch to add support for
  building with dlist version 1.x.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20200720.1.
  git-annex (8.20200720.1) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Fix a bug in find --batch in the previous version.

  git-annex (8.20200720) upstream; urgency=medium

    * import: Added --no-content option, which avoids downloading files
      from a special remote. Currently only supported by the directory
      special remote.
    * Honor annex.largefiles when importing a tree from a special remote.
      (Except for when --no-content is used.)
    * Fix a deadlock that could occur after git-annex got an unlocked
      file, causing the command to hang indefinitely. Known to happen on
      vfat filesystems, possibly others.
    * Build with the http-client-restricted and git-lfs libraries when
      available, otherwise use the vendored copy as before.
    * testremote: Fix over-allocation of resources and bad caching,
      including starting up a large number of external special remote processes.
      (Regression introduced in version 8.20200501)
    * test: Fix some test cases that assumed git's default branch name.
    * importfeed: Added some additional --template variables:
      itempubyear, itempubmonth, itempubday, itempubhour,
      itempubminute, itempubsecond.
    * Made several special remotes support locking content on them,
      which allows dropping from other special remotes in some situations
      where it was not possible before. Supported special remotes:
      S3 (with versioning=yes), git-lfs, tahoe
    * Fix reversion that broke passing annex.* and remote.*.annex-*
      git configs with -c. (Since version 8.20200330.)
    * Bring back git-annex branch read cache. This speeds up some operations,
      eg git-annex sync --content --all gets 20% faster.
    * Fix a recently introduced bug that could cause a "fork: resource exhausted"
      after getting several thousand files.
    * Sped up the --all option by 2x to 16x by using git cat-file --buffer.
      Thanks to Lukey for finding this optimisation.
    * Sped up seeking for annexed files to operate on by a factor of nearly 2x.
    * Sped up sync --content by 2x and other commands like fsck --fast and
      whereis by around 50%, by using git cat-file --buffer.
    * importfeed: Made checking known urls step around 15% faster.
    * fsck: Detect if WORM keys contain a carriage return, and recommend
      upgrading the key. (git-annex could have maybe created such keys back
      in 2013).
    * When on an adjust --hide-missing branch, fix handling of files that
      have been deleted but the deletion is not yet staged.

- Update git-annex to version 8.20200617.
  git-annex (8.20200617) upstream; urgency=medium

    * Added annex.skipunknown git config, that can be set to false to change
      the behavior of commands like `git annex get foo*`, to not skip
      over files/dirs that are not checked into git and are explicitly listed in
      the command line.
    * annex.skipunknown is planned to change to default to false in a
      git-annex release in early 2022. If you prefer the current behavior,
      you can explicitly set it to true.
    * Try to enable special remotes configured with autoenable=yes
      when git-annex auto-initialization happens in a new clone of an
      existing repo. Previously, git-annex init had to be explicitly run to
      enable them. Special remotes cannot display anything when autoenabled
      this way, to avoid interfering with the output of git-annex query
      commands.
    * export: Added options for json output.
    * import: Added --json-progress.
    * addurl: Make --preserve-filename also apply when eg a torrent contains
      multiple files.
    * Fix a crash or potentially not all files being exported when
      sync -J --content is used with an export remote.
    * export: Let concurrent transfers be done with -J or annex.jobs.
    * move --to, copy --to, mirror --to: When concurrency is enabled, run
      cleanup actions in separate job pool from uploads.
    * init: If lock probing stalls for a long time (eg a broken NFS server),
      display a message to let the user know what's taking so long.
    * init: When annex.pidlock is set, skip lock probing.
    * Fix file descriptor leak when importing from a directory special remote
      that is configured with exporttree=yes.
    * Note that external special remote programs should not block SIGINT or
      SIGTERM.
    * Avoid creating the keys database during init when there are no unlocked
      files, to prevent init failing when sqlite does not work in the
      filesystem.
    * import: Avoid using some strange names for temporary keys,
      which broke importing from a directory special remote onto a vfat
      filesystem.
    * S3: The REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class is no longer cheaper so
      stop documenting it, and stop offering it as a choice in the assistant.
    * Improve display of problems auto-initializing or upgrading local git
      remotes.
    * When a local git remote cannot be initialized because it has no
      git-annex branch or a .noannex file, avoid displaying a message about it.
    * checkpresentkey: When no remote is specified, try all remotes, not
      only ones that the location log says contain the key. This is what
      the documentation has always said it did.
    * Fix regression in external special remote handling: GETCONFIG did not
      return a value that was set with SETCONFIG immediately before.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix bug that made initremote of extrnal special remotes with
      embedcreds=yes or gpg encryption not store the creds in the git-annex
      branch. git-annex-remote-googledrive one was special remote affected by
      this bug.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix bug that made creds not be stored in git when a special remote
      was initialized with gpg encryption, but without an explicit
      embedcreds=yes.
      (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
    * Fix a annex.pidlock issue that made eg git-annex get of an unlocked
      file hang until the annex.pidlocktimeout and then fail.
