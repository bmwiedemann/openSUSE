%description
D-Bus is a simple, message-based protocol for inter-process communication,
which allows applications to interact with other parts of the machine and the
user's session using remote procedure calls.

D-Bus is a essential part of the modern Linux desktop, where it replaces
earlier protocols such as CORBA and DCOP.

This library is an implementation of the D-Bus protocol in Haskell. It can be
used to add D-Bus support to Haskell applications, without the awkward
interfaces common to foreign bindings.

Example: connect to the session bus, and get a list of active names.

' &#x7b;-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-&#x7d;

import Data.List (sort) import DBus import DBus.Client

main = do &#x20; client <- connectSession &#x20; &#x20; -- Request a list of
connected clients from the bus &#x20; reply <- call_ client (methodCall
"/org/freedesktop/DBus" "org.freedesktop.DBus" "ListNames") &#x20; &#x7b;
methodCallDestination = Just "org.freedesktop.DBus" &#x20; &#x7d; &#x20; &#x20;
-- org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames() returns a single value, which is &#x20; --
a list of names (here represented as [String]) &#x20; let Just names =
fromVariant (methodReturnBody reply !! 0) &#x20; &#x20; -- Print each name on a
line, sorted so reserved names are below &#x20; -- temporary names.
&#x20; mapM_ putStrLn (sort names) '
