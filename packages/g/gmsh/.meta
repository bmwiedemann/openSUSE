  <title>A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities</title>
  <description>Gmsh is a 3D finite element grid generator with a build-in CAD engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done either interactively using the graphical user interface or in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.

See the screencasts for a quick tour of Gmsh's graphical user interface, or the reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's capabilities and some frequently asked questions.</description>
