Tue Oct 31 22:59:54 UTC 2017 - dan.weatherill@cantab.net

- add gmsh-3.0.5-add-shebang-to-onelib.patch which adds a shebang to
  the onelib.py script, silencing an rpmbuild warning

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 30 23:07:35 UTC 2017 - dan.weatherill@cantab.net
- separate documentation to doc package
- change BuildRequires from OpenCASCADE-devel to oce-devel to fix build
  resolution failure
- remove BuildRequires: gcc-fortran which isn't needed anymore
- replace patch gmsh-2.10.1-add-missing-headers.patch with
  gmsh-3.0.05-add-missing-headers.patch, some of the missing headers have
  been added by upstream, others are still missing
- replace patch gmsh-2.10.1-fix_FTBFS_linking.patch with
  gmsh-3.0.5-fix_FTBFS_linking.patch  which requires different linked libraries
  to fix FTBFS
- replace patch gmsh-2.10.1-doc-building.patch with gmsh-3.0.5-doc-building.patch
  since old patch no longer applies properly. Only apply this patch to openSUSE
  versions <= Leap 42.3 (not needed with newer texlive distribution)
- change build and install sections to use cmake RPM macros 
- move static library into separate devel-static package (as required by openSUSE
  packaging guidelines)
- update to version 3.0.5 (September 6, 2017)
