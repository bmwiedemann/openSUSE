    - Much improved visual representation of contents in the task
      editor
    - Support for sub-headings in the task editor
    - The resurrection of the Hamster plugin
    - Dark mode
  + Update to version 0.4:
    - Client-side window decorations using the GTK HeaderBar
      widget. Along with the removal of the menu bars, this saves a
      significant amount of space and allows for more content to be
      displayed on screen.
    - The Preferences dialog was redesigned, and its contents
      cleaned up to remove obsolete settings
      (https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/227).
    - All windows are properly parented (set as transient) with the
      main window, so that they can be handled better by window
      managers.
    - Symbolic icons are available throughout the UI.
    - Improvements to padding and borders are visible throughout the
      application.
    - You can now open (or create) a task’s parent task.
    - You can now select multiple closed tasks and perform bulk
      actions on them.
    - You can now rename or delete tags by right-clicking them in
      the main window.
    - You can automatically generate and assign tag colors.
    - The Quick Add entry now supports emojis.
    - The Task Editor now provides a searchable "tag picker" widget.
    - The "Task Reaper" allows deleting old closed tasks for
      increased performance. Previously available as a plugin, it is
      now a built-in feature, available in the Preferences dialog.
    - The Quick Deferral (previously, the "Do it Tomorrow" plugin)
      is now built-in. It is now possible to defer multiple tasks at
      once to common upcoming days or to a custom date.
    - In the unlikely case where GTG encounters a problem opening
      your data file, it will automatically attempt recovery from a
      previous backup snapshot and let you know about it.
    - The menu bar has been replaced by a menu button.
      Non-contextual actions have been moved to the main menu button.
    - Searching is now handled through a dedicated Search Bar that
      can be toggled on and off with the mouse, or the Ctrl+F
      keyboard shortcut.
    - The "Workview" mode has been renamed to the "Actionable" view.
    - Sorting tasks by title is now case-insensitive and ignores 
      @ characters
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/375
    - Start/Due/Closed dates now display as properly translated in
      the Task Browser
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/357
    - In the right-click context menus, more start/due dates choices
      are available, including common upcoming dates and a custom
      date picker
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/244
    - The Calendar date picker pop-up widgets have been improved
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/230
    - The Task Editor now tries to place newly created windows more
      logically
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/287
    - The title (first line of a task) has been changed to a neutral
      black header, so that it doesn’t look like a hyperlink.
    - The user manual has been rewritten, reorganized, and updated
      with new images
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/243
    - Contributor documentation was rewritten to make it easier to
      get involved and to clarify project contribution guidelines.
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/200
      https://fortintam.com/blog/improving-developer-experience-and-attracting-open-source-project-contributors/
    - Updates were made to overall code quality to reduce barriers
      to contribution
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/237
    - The code has been ported to use GtkApplication, resulting in
      simpler and more robust UI code overall.
    - GtkBuilder/Glade ".ui" files have been regrouped into one
      location.
    - Reorganization of various .py files for consistency.
    - The debugging/logging system has been simplified.
    - Various improvements to the test suite.
    - The codebase is mostly PEP8-compliant.
    - We relaxed the PEP8 max line length convention to 100 cols for
      readability, because this is not the nineties anymore.
    - Support is available for Tox, for testing automation within
      virtualenvs
    - The application's translatable strings have been reviewed and
      harmonized, to ensure the entire application is translatable.
    - Application CSS has been moved to its own file
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/229
    - GTG now provides an "AppData" (FreeDesktop AppStream metadata)
      file to properly present itself in distro-agnostic
      software-centers.
    - The Meson build system is now supported
      https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/315
      + The development version’s launch script now allows running
        with various languages, using the LANG environment variable for example.
      + Appdata and desktop files are named based on the chosen Meson profile
       https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/349
      + Depending on the Meson profile, the HeaderBar style changes dynamically
       to indicate when run in a dev environment, such as GNOME Builder
       https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/341
