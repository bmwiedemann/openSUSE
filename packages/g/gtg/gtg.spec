%description
Getting Things GNOME! (GTG) is a personal organizer for the GNOME desktop
environment inspired by the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology. GTG is
designed with flexibility, adaptability, and ease of use in mind so it can be
used as more than just GTD software.

GTG is intended to help you track everything you need to do and need to know,
from small tasks to large projects.
