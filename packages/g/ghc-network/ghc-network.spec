%description
This package provides a low-level networking interface.

=== High-Level Packages Other packages provide higher level interfaces:

* connection * hookup * network-simple

=== Extended Packages 'network' seeks to provide a cross-platform core for
networking. As such some APIs live in extended libraries. Packages in the
'network' ecosystem are often prefixed with 'network-'.

==== 'network-bsd' In 'network-3.0.0.0' the 'Network.BSD' module was split off
into its own package, 'network-bsd-3.0.0.0'.

==== 'network-uri' In 'network-2.6' the 'Network.URI' module was split off into
its own package, 'network-uri-2.6'. If you're using the 'Network.URI' module
you can automatically get it from the right package by adding this to your
'.cabal' file:

> library > build-depends: network-uri-flag.
