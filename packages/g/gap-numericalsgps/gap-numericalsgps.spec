%description
The features of this package include

* Defining numerical semigroups;

* Computing several properties of numerical semigroups, namely:
  multiplicity, Frobenius number, (minimal) system of generators,
  Ap√©ry set, gaps, fundamental gaps, etc.;

* Performing several operations on numerical semigroups, namely:
  intersection, quotient by an integer, decompose into
  irreducible semigroups, add a special gap;
