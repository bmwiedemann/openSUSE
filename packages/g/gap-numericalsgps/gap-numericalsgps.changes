Sun Feb 12 10:48:24 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.3.1
  * AperyList now works for an ideal, and computes the Apéry list
    wrt the multiplicity of its ambient numerical semigroup
  * Added a bunch of functions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 15 00:05:42 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.1.8
  * Added/Changed NumberElement_IdealOfNumericalSemigroup and
    ElementNumber_IdealOfNumericalSemigroup.
  * List and sublist access for numerical semigroups and ideals of
    numerical semigroups, \[\] and \{\}.
  * Iterator for numerical semigroup and ideals of numerical
    semigroups.
  * NextElementOfNumericalSemigroup, NumberElement_NumericalSemigroup
    and ElementNumber_NumericalSemigroup.
  * Functions to translate graphs related to numerical and affine
    semigroups to the dot language.

- Update to new upstream release 1.1.5
  * GBASIS is not set while loading singular; it is set inside
    functions calling Gröbner basis for methods using singular.
  * Type is now an operation (clash with FinIng), and
    TypeOfNumericalSemigroup remains an attribute
  * Inequalities was used in MatricesForHomalg as an operation,
    and so we turned it an operation; the corresponding attribute
    is AffineSemigroupInequalities
  * Removed all methods in singular using SingularLibrary (this
    was producing unexpected issues if the required software for
    the singular libraries was not well installed)
  * Removed [0,..,0] from GraverBasis in some methods (and thus
    in the testify)
  * Fixed issue with GeneratorsOfKernelCongruence and
    MinimalPresentationOfAffineSemigroup when it was empty
    (singular method)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 14 16:46:26 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.0.1
  * Added functions to find the set of numerical semigroups (or a
    random numerical semigroup) with a given set of
    pseudo-Frobenius numbers.
  * Fixed bug in the definition of proportionaly modular
    semigroups (affected the case a < c (in this case it should
    return the entire N) -- )

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  7 16:09:58 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.980
* Gluings of numerical semigroups added to the manual.
* New functions for almost symmetric numerical semigroups
* New functions for complete intersection numerical semigroups
* The output of BettiElementsOfNumericalSemigroup is now a set
* NumericalSemigroupsWithGenus(0) now returns []
* New functions for maximal embedding dimension numerical
  semigroups
* New functions related to factorizations of integers
* New functions for Apery sets added
* New synonym included: S-I denotes (0+S)-I, the oposite or dual
  of the ideal I
* Factorizations of an integer (expressions as sums with
  nonnegative coefficients of elements in a list) are now
  performed with RestrictedPartitions, with a speed up of the
  functions that deal with factorizations

- Split numericalsgps (version 0.971) off the gap RPM package
