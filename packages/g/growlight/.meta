  <title>Disk manipulation and system setup tool</title>
  <description>growlight can manipulate both physical (NVMe, SATA, etc.) and virtual (mdadm,
device-mapper, etc.) block devices, help identify bottlenecks in a storage
topology, create and destroy filesystems, and prepare a machine for initial
boot when run in an installer context. Both full-screen and REPL readline UIs
are available.
