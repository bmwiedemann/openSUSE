- Upgrade to version 1.13.1
- Changes in 1.13.1
  * Bugs
    + [#203] Using bindAllProjectProperties and
      bindSessionUserOverrideProperties together can cause an NPE.
- Changes in 1.13.0
  * Enhancements
    + [#196] Add support for targetting Java 17.
    + [#198] Add support for targetting Java 18.
    + [#188/#193] Update Ant from 1.10.8 to 1.10.11.
- Changes in 1.12.1
  * Bugs
    +  [#186] Certain AST transformations had classloader issues
       because 1.12.0 was no longer setting the context classloader.
  * Enhancements
    + Update Jansi to 2.x.
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + The Jansi upgrade should generally be compatible, but could
      cause issues with scripts that were using Jansi 1.x specific
      classes.
- Changes in 1.12.0
  * Bugs
    + [#183] The classloader project dependencies are loaded onto is
      reused between modules, so each module was a superset of all
      modules that preceded it. Also, the console, execute, and
      shell mojos didn't pass the classloader to use into the
      instantiated GroovyConsole/GroovyShell, so it accidentally was
      using the plugin classloader, even when configured to use
      PROJECT_ONLY classpath.
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + This should be a non-breaking change (except for unusual
      situations that were relying on the previous incorrect
      behavior). However, since it's a significant change, I'm
      bumping the version by more than just the patch version.
  * Notes
    + This potentially runs slower than before, since a new
      classloader is instantiated each execution, rather than
      resuing the same classloader, so the classes referenced will
      have to be reinitialized.
- Changes in 1.11.1
  * Bugs
    + Fixes IllegalArgumentException when consoleScript parameter
      was loaded from POM rather than command line property.
- Changes in 1.11.0
  * Enhancements
    + Change JDK compatibility check to also account for Java 16.
    + Some tweaks for Groovy 4 (most notably, invokedynamic is
      enabled by default for Groovy 4 and cannot be disabled).
    + New parameter (attachGroovyDocAnnotation) to enable attaching
      GroovyDoc annotation.
    + New parameter (parallelParsing) to enable parallel parsing
      (enabled by default with Groovy 4).
    + Remove previewFeatures parameter from stub generation goals,
      since it's not used there.
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + If you were using the previewFeatures parameter without also
      including a compilation goal that would make that config
      valid, the build will fail because it's no longer a valid
      parameter. The fix would be to move that configuration to the
      appropriate execution(s).
- Changes in 1.10.1
  * Enhancements
    + Ability to override classes used to generate GroovyDoc (#91)
    + Ability to override GStringTemplates used for GroovyDoc (#105)
    + Ability to bind overridden properties (by binding project
      properties and/or session user properties) (#72)
    + Ability to load a script when launching GroovyConsole (#165)
- Changes in 1.10.0
  * Enhancements
    + Change default GroovyDoc jar artifact type to javadoc, so its
      extension gets set to "jar" by the artifact handler instead of
      "groovydoc" by the default handler logic which uses the type
      for the extension in the case of unknown types (#151).
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + GroovyDoc jars and test GroovyDoc jars will now be of type
      "javadoc" and have extension "jar".  Rather than type and
      extension "groovydoc".  If you do not wish to transition to
      this new behavior, set the new artifactType or
      testArtifactType property to "groovydoc" to revert to the
      previous behavior.
  * Notes
    + While the artifact type of GroovyDoc jars has changed, the
      Maven classifier has not. It remains "groovydoc", and you can
      still override that, just as before.
- Changes in 1.9.1
  * Enhancements
    + Add a property to skip script execution (#162)
- Changes in 1.9.0
  * Enhancements
    + Support for Java 14 (#152).
    + Support for Java 15 (#153).
    + Add skipBytecodeCheck property and parameter, so if a Java
      version comes out the plugin doesn't recognize, you can use it
      without having to wait for an update.
    + Use groovy.ant.AntBuilder instead of groovy.util.AntBuilder
      (if available).
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + maven.groovydoc.skip property was renamed to skipGroovydoc so
      it matches the pattern of the other properties and won't seem
      to imply it's a property for a standard Maven plugin.
    + Using groovy.ant.AntBuilder instead of groovy.util.AntBuilder
      (when available on classpath).
    + Bundling Ant 1.10.7 instead of 1.10.5.
    + Bundling Ivy 2.5.0 instead of 2.4.0.
  * Notes
    + Now officially requires Java 7 instead of 6. This is not a
      breaking change, however, since this was actually already
      required because of plexus-classworlds. This just wasn't
      discovered until an enforcer rule was added to check bytecode
      versions of dependencies.
- Changes in 1.8.1
  * Bugs
    + #147 Change sourcesets internal storage from HashSet to
      TreeSet, to avoid unpredictable Groovy compiler output on
      certain filesystems.
    + #145 Disable system exits by default, to avoid potential
      thread safety issues.
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + #145 Changes the default of not allowing System.exits to
      allowing them.
- Changes in 1.8.0
  * Enhancements
    + Allow for invocation using only project classpath (#140).
      This is accomplished with
      <includeClasspath>PLUGIN_ONLY</includeClasspath>.
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + #140 If you were using useSharedClasspath before, you will
      need to replace it with new values. In most cases, this would
      be
      +---------------------+--------------------+
      | usedSharedClasspath | includeClasspath   |
      +---------------------+--------------------+
      | true                | PROJECT_AND_PLUGIN |
      | false               | PROJECT_ONLY       |
      +---------------------+--------------------+
    + Another notable difference is that when using this new
      configuration parameter in compile, compileTests,
      generateStubs, or generateTestStubs goals, now also uses the
      configurator to add the project dependencies to the classpath
      with the plugin's dependencies. Previously, this only happened
      in the goals other than the ones mentioned.
- Changes in 1.7.1
  * Bugs
    + Fix that Groovy 3.0.0-alpha-5 was actually released as
      3.0.0-beta-1 (#133)
  * Enhancements
    + Support Java preview features (#125)
    + New goals to create GroovyDoc jars (#124)
    + Use the new "groovy.console.ui.Console" package, if available,
      fall back to "groovy.ui.Console" (#136)
- Changes in 1.7.0
  * Bugs
    + #131 Fix executing script from URL in Groovy older than 1.7.0
    + #120 Use unique configuration names for every mojo, so goals
      don't conflict
  * Enhancements
    + #122 Support Java 13
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + #120 corrects an inadvertent breaking change made in 1.6.0
      with #31/#58. Here are those changes: +--------------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
                                            | 1.5                      | 1.6                  | 1.7                      |
      +-------------------------------------+--------------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
      | addStubSources                      | stubsOutputDirectory     | outputDirectory      | stubsOutputDirectory     |
      | addTestStubSources                  | testStubsOutputDirectory | outputDirectory      | testStubsOutputDirectory |
      | compileTests/testCompile            | testOutputDirectory      | outputDirectory      | testOutputDirectory      |
      | generateStubs                       | stubsOutputDirectory     | outputDirectory      | stubsOutputDirectory     |
      | generateTestStubs/testGenerateStubs | testStubsOutputDirectory | outputDirectory      | testStubsOutputDirectory |
      | groovydocTests/testGroovydoc        | groovydocJavaSources     | groovydocJavaSources | testGroovydocJavaSources |
      | removeStubs                         | stubsOutputDirectory     | outputDirectory      | stubsOutputDirectory     |
      | removeTestStubs                     | testStubsOutputDirectory | outputDirectory      | testStubsOutputDirectory |
      +-------------------------------------+--------------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
    + In addition, unused parameters have been removed:
      = addSources
        -> skipTests
        -> testSources
      = addStubSources
        -> skipTests
        -> sources
        -> testSources
      = addTestSources
        -> outputDirectory
        -> skipTests
        -> sources
      = addTestStubSources
        -> sources
        -> testSources
      = compile
        -> skipTests
        -> testSources
      = compileTests
        -> sources
      = console
        -> skipTests
      = execute
        -> skipTests
      = generateStubs
        -> skipTests
        -> testSources
      = generateTestStubs
        -> sources
      = groovydoc
        -> skipTests
        -> testSources
        -> testGroovyDocOutputDirectory
      = groovydocTests
        -> skipTests
        -> sources
      = removeStubs
        -> skipTests
        -> sources
        -> testSources
      = removeTestStubs
        -> sources
        -> testSources
      = shell
        -> skipTests
    + Lastly, addTestStubSources and removeTestStubs now respect the
      skipTests flag, for consistency.
- Changes in 1.6.3
  * Enhancements
    + Ability to use Groovy from plugin dependencies (creates a
      single classpath with plugin and project dependencies)
      (#64 & #86)
    + Support for Java 13 bytecode (#123)
    + Log executed scripts (#119)
    + Log message from exception cause (#112)
- Changes in 1.6.2
  * Bugs
    + Fixed that could error saying no Groovy dependency when it
      shouldn't because no Groovy sources exist (ef3a3d5).
  * Enhancements
    + Support for Java 10 bytecode (#104)
    + Support for Java 11 bytecode (#106)
- Changes in 1.6.1
  * Bugs
    + Fixed that was logging Groovy version as not supporting config
      script if config script file didn't exist
    + Fixed NPE when calling mojo without Groovy dependency
    + Fixed that was logging compile classpath instead of test
      classpath during test GroovyDoc generation
- Changes in 1.6
  * Bugs
    + [38] - Compilation doesn't allow indy back far enough (thanks
      for pointing this out Pascal Schumacher!)
  * Enhancements
    + [36] - Allow script files to be executed as filenames as well
      as URLs (see Significant changes of note for an example)
    + [41] - Verify Groovy version supports target bytecode (See
      Potentially breaking changes for a description)
    + [46] - Remove scriptExtensions config option
    + [31/58] - Goals not consistantly named / IntelliJ improperly
      adding stub directories to sources
    + [61] - You can now skip Groovydoc generation with new
      skipGroovyDoc property (Thanks rvenutolo!)
    + [45] - GROOVY-7423 (JEP 118) Support (requires Groovy
      2.5.0-alpha-1 or newer and enabled with new parameters boolean
      property)
  * Potentially breaking changes
    + 46 will break your build if you are using scriptExtensions.
      But the fix is simple, just the delete the configuration
      option and GMavenPlus will automatically do the right thing.
    + 41 will break your build if you were passing an invalid target
      bytecode. GMavenPlus will no longer allow Groovy to silently
      default to 1.4 or 1.5. It will verify that the bytecode is
      supported by your Groovy version (that is, the option exists
      in org.codehaus.groovy.control.CompilerConfiguration), and
      fail if it isn't.
    + 58 will require renaming goals testGenerateStubs to
      generateTestStubs and testCompile to compileTests. IntelliJ
      has hard-coded the goal names in their plugin, and these names
      will make IntelliJ work with both GMaven and GMavenPlus.
    + In order to support using the latest Maven plugins (and to
      make GMavenPlus easier to maintain), GMavenPlus now requires
      Java 6 or newer and Maven 3.0.1 or newer (previously was
      Java 5 or newer and Maven 2.2.1 or newer).
    + Due to an unintended side-effect of logging order change,
      adding a GMavenPlus goal without Groovy dependency will fail
      if there are no Groovy sources to use that goal with. If this
      is an issue for you, please let me know, and I'll consider
      reversing the order back.
    + testStubsOutputDirectory and stubsOutputDirectory
      inadvertently got renamed to outputDirectory, which conflicts
      with the configuration in the compile and compileTests goals.
      You may need to setup separate executions with separate
      configurations for each if you need to set that configuration
      option.
  * Notes
    + You can now use this syntax for executing scripts
      <script>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/groovyScripts/helloWorld.groovy</script>
      in addition to the original style of
      <script>file:///${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/groovyScripts/helloWorld.groovy</script>
    + This will be the last release that doesn't follow semantic
      versioning conventions.
