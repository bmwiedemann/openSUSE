  1.40.1

  * [BUG FIX: Fix equivalence check for `Date` / `Time` / `TimeZone`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2291)
      * This fixes a serious bug in the recently introduced support for temporal
        literals where they would fail to type-check when given a correct type
        annotation or when they were checked against an existing type
      * For example, `00:00:00 : Time` was failing to type-check

- Update dhall to version 1.40.0.
  1.40.0

  * [Almost supports version 20.2.0 of the standard](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v20.2.0)
      * The main thing that is missing is support for the `headers.dhall` file
      * [BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Add support for `Date` / `Time` / `TimeZone` ](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2247)
          * This is a breaking change because `Date`, `Time`, and `TimeZone` are
            now reserved identifiers
      * [Improved fallback behavior for `?`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2203)
  * [BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Require whitespace before `with`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2213)
      * The parser now requires whitespace before the `with` keyword, which brings
        the Haskell implementation into closer compliance with the standard
      * In practice this is a technically breaking change which will not affect
        most programs
  * [New `FromDhall` instances for `Predicate`, `Equivalence`, and `Op`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2278)
  * [`dhall lint` will now sort `let` bindings with imports](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2205)
      * `dhall lint` now reorders `let` bindings to move imports to the top so
        long as doing so does not change the behavior of the program
  * Fixes and improvements to code formatting
      * [#2280](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2280)

  1.39.0

  * [Supports version 20.2.0 of the standard](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v20.2.0)
      * [Add support for Unix shebangs](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2175)
  * [BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: `dhall {format,freeze,lint}` now accept multiple
    files](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2169)
      * The `--inplace` flag is no longer necessary and you can now specify
        multiple files to update in place on the command line, like
        `dhall format foo.dhall bar.dhall`
      * The `--inplace` flag is still accepted, but does nothing, and will emit a
        warning
      * This is a breaking change to the API for formatting/freezing/linting files
        because now you can specify multiple inputs instead of one input
  * [BREAKING CHANGE: Pre-6.0.0 hashes are no longer supported](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2190)
      * The interpreter no longer provides backwards compatibility for integrity
        checks computed before standard version 6.0.0
      * This is a breaking change to the API of the `Dhall.Binary` module, where
        certain utilities are no longer parameterized on a `StandardVersion`
      * This is also a breaking change to any Dhall code that depended on these
        really old integrity checks
  * [BUG FIX: Formatting `≡` now correctly preserves the original character set](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2176)
  * [BUG FIX: Don't panic on `Text/replace ""`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2184)
  * [Quasiquotation support for Dhall](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2198)
      * You can now convert a Dhall expression to the corresponding syntax tree
        using a quasiquoter like this: `[dhall| \x -> x + 2 ]`
  * [New `Dhall.Marshal.{Encode,Decode}` modules](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2193)
      * These modules split up the `Dhall` module into two smaller modules for
        encoding and decoding logic, respectively
      * The `Dhall` module still re-exports the same functionality as before, so
        this is not a breaking change
  * [Support GHC 9.0.1](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2154)
  * Fixes and improvements to code formatting
      * [Improve pretty-printing of `sha256`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2189)

  1.38.0

  * [BREAKING CHANGE: Detect preferred character set from input](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2108)
      * `dhall format` will now preserve the character set of the formatted file
        by default.  In other words, if the file uses ASCII punctuation then
        `dhall format` will format the file using ASCII punctuation.
      * If the file contains both ASCII and Unicode punctuation it will prefer
        Unicode by default
      * This is a breaking change because the `Lam` / `Pi` / `Combine` /
        `CombineTypes`, and `Prefer` constructors now take an additional argument
        to record which character set was used
  * [BUG FIX: Fix CORS compliance check](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2121)
      * Previous versions were not correctly enforcing CORS compliance
      * This implies that some imports that would have worked previously by
        accident will now fail; specifically: an import from one domain
        transitively importing something from another domain that has not opted
        into CORS
  * [Add `ToDhall (Fix f)` instance](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2122)

      * [Support `if` expressions returning a type or kind](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2080)
  * BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: [Improve error message for duplicate projection label](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2097)
      * This also makes the implementation more standards-compliant, by treating
        a duplicate label as a type error instead of a parse error
      * This is a breaking change since the `Project` constructor now stores a
        `[Text]` instead of `Set Text`
  * [Add `--cache` flag to `dhall hash`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2093)
      * This flag adds the hashed expression to the cache when enabled
  * [Deprecate `Inject` / `Interpret`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2099)

      * [Implement more efficient `with` desugaring](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1993)
          * Chained `with` expressions will now be much more efficient
  * [BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Preserve whitespace for `Lam` constructor](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1980)
      * This change extends the `Lam` constructor to preserve whitespace around
        the variable binding
      * The motivation for this change is to enable `dhall-docs` to support
        jumping to definitions
      * You can replace your existing `Lam` constructors with
        `Dhall.Core.makeFunctionBinding`
  * [BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Preserve whitespace for `Field` constructors](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1991)
      * This change extends the `Field` constructor to preserve whitespace around
        the selected field
      * The motivation for this change is to enable `dhall-docs` to support
        jumping to definitions
      * You can use `Dhall.Core.makeFieldSelection` and
        `Dhall.Core.fieldSelectionLabel` to convert between the detailed and the
        simple representation of the selected field.
  * [Add `FromDhall` instances for `{Int,Word}{,8,16,32,64}`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2012)

      * Several import-related functions now provide an alternative variants that
        allows the user to supply a custom `Manager`
      * You can use this to tweak HTTP request timeouts or use a different TLS
        manager (e.g. one from `http-client-openssl`)

Tue Sep  8 10:06:28 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update dhall to version 1.34.0 revision 2.
  1.34.0

  * [Supports version 17.1.0 of the standard](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v17.1.0)
      * [Add support for trailing commas](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1885)
  * BREAKING CHANGE to the API: [Support prefix comments on record key-value pairs](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1908)
      * The Dhall AST (i.e. `Expr`) now preserves some comments for record types
        and record literals
      * The impact of this change is that you will need to add
        `Dhall.Syntax.makeRecordField` or `Dhall.Syntax.recordFieldValue` in a few
        places wherever your Haskell assembles or disassembles record expressions
      * The motivation of this change is two-fold:
          * To eventually enable `dhall-docs` support for rendering record
            comments as documentation
          * To eventually enable support for preserving record-related comments
            when formatting Dhall code
  * BUG FIX: [Fix `with` expressions to permit functions on their left-hand side](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1897)
      * This was a case of the Haskell implementation not being compliant with the
        standard grammar
  * [Drop support for GHC 8.2](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1949)
  * [Add a new `dhall rewrite-with-schemas` command](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1902)
      * You can now simplify a Dhall expression using a schema record (e.g. a
        `./schemas.dhall` record that a package might provide)
      * This simplification replaces large anonymous records with an
        equivalent use of a record completion when possible
  * [Add `--transitive` flag to `dhall {format,lint,freeze}](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1880)
      * This flag lets you format/lint/freeze a file and all of its transitive
        dependencies that are reachable via relative file imports
  * [Move `man/dhall.1` to `data-files`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1921)
      * This ensures that Cabal will install `dhall`'s `man` pages in the
        correct directory
  * Performance improvements
      * [#1879](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1879)
  * Standards compliance
