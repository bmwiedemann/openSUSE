%description
Dhall is an explicitly typed configuration language that is not Turing
complete. Despite being Turing incomplete, Dhall is a real programming language
with a type-checker and evaluator.

Use this library to parse, type-check, evaluate, and pretty-print the Dhall
configuration language. This package also includes an executable which
type-checks a Dhall file and reduces the file to a fully evaluated normal form.

Read "Dhall.Tutorial" to learn how to use this library.
