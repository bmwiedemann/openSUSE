%description
GALAXIS for UNIX

Lifeboats from a crippled interstellar liner are adrift in a starfield.
To find them, you can place probes that look in all eight compass
directions and tell you how many lifeboats they see. If you drop a probe
directly on a lifeboat it will be revealed immediately. Your objective:
find the lifeboats as quickly as possible, before the stranded passengers
run out of oxygen!

This is a UNIX-hosted, curses-based clone of the nifty little Macintosh
freeware game Galaxis. It doesn't have the super-simple, point-and-click
interface of the original, but compensates by automating away some of
the game's simpler deductions.
