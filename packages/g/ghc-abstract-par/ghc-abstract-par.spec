%description
The 'Par' monad offers a parallel programming API based on dataflow
programming. To use the `Par` monad, install the 'monad-par' package, which
includes this package as a dependency.

This package is an abstract interface only. It provides a number of type
clasess, but not an implementation. The type classes separate different levels
of 'Par' functionality. See the "Control.Monad.Par.Class" module for more
details.
