  <title>Quickly rewrite git repository history (git-filter-branch replacement)</title>
  <description>git filter-repo is a versatile tool for rewriting history, which includes
capabilities not found anywhere else. It roughly falls into the same space of
tool as git filter-branch but without the capitulation-inducing poor
performance, with far more capabilities, and with a design that scales
usability-wise beyond trivial rewriting cases.
