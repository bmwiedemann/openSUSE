%description
A family of combinators for defining webservices APIs and serving them

You can learn about the basics in the
<http://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/tutorial/index.html tutorial>.

<https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/blob/master/servant-server/example/greet.hs
Here> is a runnable example, with comments, that defines a dummy API and
implements a webserver that serves this API, using this package.
