- Update brick to version 1.6.
  1.6
  ---

  Package changes:
  * Support `mtl` 2.3 (thanks Daniel Firth)

  API changes:
  * `Brick.Widgets.Table` got a new `alignColumns` function that can be
    used to do column layout of a list of widgets using `ColumnAlignment`
    values from the table API.
  * `Brick.Widgets.Table` got a new low-level table-rendering API for use
    in applications that want to use the table layout machinery without
    using `Table` itself. This includes:
    * `tableCellLayout` - does table cell layout using table configuration
      settings,
    * `addBorders` - adds row, column, and surrounding borders using table
      border-drawing settings, and
    * `RenderedTableCells` and `BorderConfiguration` - the low-level types
      used for the new functions.

  Other changes:
  * Added a new `EditorLineNumbersDemo` demo program.

- Update brick to version 1.0.
  1.0
  ---

  Version 1.0 of `brick` comes with some improvements that will require
  you to update your programs. This section details the list of API
  changes in 1.0 that are likely to introduce breakage and how to deal
  with each one. You can also consult the demonstration
  programs to see orking examples of the new API. For those
  interested in a bit of discussion on the changes, see [this
  ticket](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/issues/379).

  * The event-handling monad `EventM` was improved and changed in some
    substantial ways, all aimed at making `EventM` code cleaner, more
    composable, and more amenable to lens updates to the application
    state.
    * The type has changed from `EventM n a` to `EventM n s a` and is now
      an `mtl`-compatible state monad over `s`. Some consequences and
      related changes are:
      * Event handlers no longer take and return an explicit state value;
        an event handler that formerly had the type `handler :: s ->
        BrickEvent n e -> EventM n (Next s)` now has type `handler ::
        BrickEvent n e -> EventM n s ()`. This also affected all of
        Brick's built-in event handler functions for `List`, `Editor`,
        etc.
      * The `appHandleEvent` and `appStartEvent` fields of `App` changed
        types to reflect the new structure of `EventM`. `appStartEvent`
        will just be `return ()` rather than `return` for most
        applications.
      * `EventM` can be used with the `MonadState` API from `mtl` as well
        as with the very nice lens combinators in `microlens-mtl`.
      * The `Next` type was removed.
      * State-specific event handlers like `handleListEvent` and
        `handleEditorEvent` are now statically typed to be scoped to
        just the states they manage, so `zoom` from `microlens-mtl` must
        be used to invoke them. `Brick.Types` re-exports `zoom` for
        convenience. `handleEventLensed` was removed from the API in lieu
        of the new `zoom` behavior. Code that previously handled events
        with `handleEventLensed s someLens someHandler e` is now just
        written `zoom someLens $ someHandler e`.
      * If an `EventM` block needs to operate on some state `s` that is
        not accessible via a lens into the application state, the `EventM`
        block can be set up with `Brick.Types.nestEventM`.
    * Since `Next` was removed, control flow is now as follows:
      * Without any explicit specification, an `EventM` block always
        continues execution of the `brick` event loop when it finishes.
        `continue` was removed from the API. What was previously `continue
        $ s & someLens .~ value` will become `someLens .= value`.
      * `halt` is still used to indicate that the event loop should halt
        after the calling handler is finished, but `halt` no longer takes
        an explicit state value argument.
      * `suspendAndResume` is now immediate; previously,
        `suspendAndResume` indicated that the specified action should run
        once the event handler finished. Now, the event handler is paused
        while the specified action is run. This allows `EventM` code to
        continue to run after `suspendAndResume` is called and before
        control is returned to `brick`.
    * Brick now depends on `mtl` rather than `transformers`.
  * The `IsString` instance for `AttrName` was removed.
    * This change is motivated by the API wart that resulted from the
      overloading of both `<>` and string literals (via
      `OverloadedStrings`) that resulted in code such as `someAttrName
      = "blah" <> "things"`. While that worked to create an `AttrName`
      with two segments, it was far too easy to read as two strings
      concatenated. The overloading hid what is really going on with the
      segments of the attribute name. The way to write the above example
      after this change is `someAttrName = attrName "blah" <> attrName
      "things"`.

  Other changes in this release:

  * Brick now provides an optional API for user-defined keybindings
    for applications! See the User Guide section "Customizable
    Keybindings", the Haddock for `Brick.Keybindings.KeyDispatcher`,
    and the new demo program `programs/CustomKeybindingDemo.hs` to get
    started.
  * `Brick.Widgets.List` got `listSelectedElementL`, a traversal for
    accessing the currently selected element of a list. (Thanks Fraser
    Tweedale)

  Build fixes:
   * Added a missing import for GHC 8.2.2.

  0.70

  Enhancements:
   * The table widget now behaves much better when some or all cells are
     empty.

  Bug fixes:
   * BorderMaps got fixed to ensure that smart borders connect even in the
     presence of empty widgets (#370). Thanks to Daniel Wagner for this
     fix!

  0.69.1
  ------

  Bug fixes:
   * `table` can now deal properly with empty cells that are in left- and
     top-aligned settings. Previously, empty cells in those settings would
     break table rendering. (#369)

- Update brick to version 0.69.
  0.69
  ----

  New features:
   * `Brick.Widgets.Core`: added `relativeTo` to support relative
     positioning across layers. This allows elements in higher layers
     to be positioned relative to elements in lower layers as long as
     those elements have had their extents reported with `reportExtent` or
     `clickable`.

- Update brick to version 0.68.
  0.68
  ----

  API changes:
   * Removed the "markup" feature, which included `Data.Text.Markup`,
     `Brick.Markup`, and `brick-markup-demo`. This feature never performed
     well and was awkward to use. I considered it experimental from the
     initial release of this library. Some recent incompatibilities with
     Vty changes made me realize that it was time to finally get rid of
     this. If this affects you, please let me know and I am happy to work
     with you to figure out an alternative. Granted, anyone is welcome to
     dig up the previous code and re-use it in their own projects!

  New features and API changes:
   * Viewports got support for built-in scroll bar rendering. This
     includes additions of types and functions to manage the feature
     behavior. These changes enable viewports to automatically get
     scroll bars drawn next to them (on any side) with customizable
     attributes and drawings. As part of this change, a new demo program,
     `ViewportScrollbarsDemo.hs`, was added to show off these new
     features. Here are the new types and functions that got added (mostly
     to `Brick.Widgets.Core`):
     * `withVScrollBars` - enable display of vertical scroll bars
     * `withHScrollBars` - enable display of horizontal scroll bars
     * `withClickableVScrollBars` - enable mouse click reporting on
       vertical scroll bar elements
     * `withClickableHScrollBars` - enable mouse click reporting on
       horizontal scroll bar elements
     * `ClickableScrollbarElement` - the type of elements of a scroll bar
       that can be clicked on and provided to the application
     * `withVScrollBarHandles` - enable vertical scroll bar handle drawing
     * `withHScrollBarHandles` - enable horizontal scroll bar handle
       drawing
     * `withVScrollBarRenderer` - customize the renderer used for vertical
       scroll bars
     * `withHScrollBarRenderer` - customize the renderer used for
       horizontal scroll bars
     * `ScrollbarRenderer(..)` - the type of scroll bar renderer
       implementations
     * `verticalScrollbarRenderer` - the default renderer for vertical
       scrollbars, customizable with `withVScrollBarRenderer`
     * `horizontalScrollbarRenderer` - the default renderer for horizontal
       scrollbars, customizable with `withHScrollBarRenderer`
     * `scrollbarAttr` - the base attribute of scroll bars
     * `scrollbarTroughAttr` - the attribute of scroll bar troughs
     * `scrollbarHandleAttr` - the attribute of scroll bar handles

  Package changes:
   * Raised `base` bounds to allow building with GHC 9.2.1 (thanks Mario
     Lang)
   * Stopped supporting GHC 7.10.

  0.62
  ----

  API changes:
   * `Brick.Widgets.Core` got new functions
     `crop{Left,Right,Bottom,Top}To`. Unlike the `crop...By` functions,
     which crop on the specified side by a particular amount, these
     `crop...To` functions crop on the specified side and take a desired
     overall width of the final result and use that to determine how much
     to crop. A widget `x` of width `w` could thus be cropped equivalently
     with `cropLeftBy a x` and `cropLeftTo (w - a) x`.

  Other changes:
   * Added `programs/CroppingDemo.hs` to demonstrate the new (and
     preexisting) cropping functions.

  Package changes:
   * Updated dependency constraints to build on GHC 9.0.1 (thanks Ondřej
     Súkup)

  API changes:
   * The FileBrowser module now exports individual functions for
     each of the events that it handles. This allows end users to
     trigger the behaviors directly rather than relying on the built-in
     `handleFileBrowserEvent` function. The documentation has been updated
     to indicate which functions are triggered by each key event. (Thanks
     David B. Lamkins)

  Other changes:
   * The `List` module's `listFindBy` function now attempts to find a
     match anywhere in the list rather than just somewhere between the
     cursor and the end of the list.
   * The `FileBrowser` now positions a cursor at the beginning of the
     selected entry when the file browser is focused. (thanks Mario Lang)
   * The user guide's viewport visibility example got an important
     syntactic fix. (thanks Mario Lang)

     within (and managed by) a Form. This function takes care of the
     details of updating the form fields themselves to be consistent with
     the change in underlying state.
   * Added the overall window width (`windowWidth`) and height
     (`windowHeight`) to `Context`, the rendering context type (thanks Tom
     McLaughlin)

  Other changes:
   * Added `brick-tail-demo`, a demonstration program for writing a
