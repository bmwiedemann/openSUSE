  <title>Sans Serif Font</title>
  <description>&quot;Nobile&quot; is designed to work with the technologies of digital 
screens and handheld devices without losing the distinctive look 
more usually found in fonts designed for printing. Going back to 
William Morris's baseline &quot;Have nothing in your house that you do 
not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful&quot;, the aim was to 
design a font that could function well, have good legibility on 
screen yet also be good loooking, not only at larger display sizes 
but also right down to small text sizes.
