%description
Instances for Binary for the types defined in the vector package, making it
easy to serialize vectors to and from disk. We use the generic interface to
vectors, so all vector types are supported. Specific instances are provided for
unboxed, boxed and storable vectors. . To serialize a vector: . >
*Data.Vector.Binary> let v = Data.Vector.fromList [1..10] >
*Data.Vector.Binary> v > fromList [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] :: Data.Vector.Vector
> *Data.Vector.Binary> encode v > Chunk
"NULNULNULNULNUL...NULNULNULtNULNULNULNULn" Empty . Which you can in turn
compress before writing to disk: . > compress . encode $ v > Chunk
"US139bNULNULN...229240,254:NULNULNUL" Empty . Try the cereal-vector package if
you are looking for Data.Serialize instances.
