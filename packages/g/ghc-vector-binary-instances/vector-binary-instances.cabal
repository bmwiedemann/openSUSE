Synopsis:            Instances of Data.Binary for vector
Description:
   Instances for Binary for the types defined in the vector package,
   making it easy to serialize vectors to and from disk. We use the
   generic interface to vectors, so all vector types are supported.
   Specific instances are provided for unboxed, boxed and storable
   vectors.
   .
   To serialize a vector:
   .
   > *Data.Vector.Binary> let v = Data.Vector.fromList [1..10]
   > *Data.Vector.Binary> v
   > fromList [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] :: Data.Vector.Vector
   > *Data.Vector.Binary> encode v
   > Chunk "\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL...\NUL\NUL\NUL\t\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\n" Empty
   .
   Which you can in turn compress before writing to disk:
   .
   > compress . encode $ v
   > Chunk "\US\139\b\NUL\NUL\N...\229\240,\254:\NUL\NUL\NUL" Empty
   .
   Try the cereal-vector package if you are looking for Data.Serialize
   instances.
