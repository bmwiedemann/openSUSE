    <comment>- cleaning up the macros and conditionals for gcc go
  - use bcond_with(out) to decide whether we want to use gccgo or
    not. makes it easier to test both code paths as you can use
    osc build --with(out)=gccgo
  - add defines for which go version to use for different versions,
    that way we dont have to use the old 1.4 everywhere anymore.
    this allows us to use go for bootstrapping everywhere
  - do not use gcc go at all as even gcc-go 8 can not handle some
    newer constructs
  - define a gcc_go_version variable and use it through out the
    spec file, this simplifies some conditionals and makes them
    more understandable, and we have the complex if only once.
  - move architecture defines to the top
- go1.12.1 (released 2019/03/14) includes fixes to cgo, the
  compiler, the go command, and the fmt, net/smtp, os,
  path/filepath, sync, and text/template packages.

  * go#30398 fmt: map printing sort does not deterministically sort differing types
- go1.12 (released 2019/02/25) includes changes in the implementation of the
  toolchain, runtime, and libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1
  promise of compatibility. Upstream expects almost all Go programs to continue
  to compile and run as before.
  * GO111MODULE=on enables module-aware operations outside of a module directory
  * GODEBUG=tls13=1 enables opt-in support for TLS 1.3 in the crypto/tls package
    per RFC 8446. Will be default in go1.13.
  * trace tool now supports plotting mutator utilization curves, including
    cross-references to the execution trace. These are useful for analyzing the
    impact of the garbage collector on application latency and throughput.
  * arm64 assembler platform register renamed from R18 to R18_PLATFORM
  * improvements to gc
  * race detector is now supported on linux/arm64
  * cgo is now supported on linux/ppc64
  * go1.12 is the last release that will support binary-only packages.
- Fix erroneous trailing backslash in %post script.

- go1.11.5 (released 2019/01/23) security release fixes CVE-2019-6486 (bsc#1123013).
  * go#29903 crypto/elliptic: CPU DoS vulnerability affecting P-521 and P-384
- Make our profile.d/go.sh no longer set GOROOT=, in order to make switching
  between versions no longer break. This ends up removing the need for go.sh
  entirely (because GOPATH is also set automatically). boo#1119634
- go1.11.4 (released 2018/12/14) includes fixes to cgo, the compiler, linker,
  runtime, documentation, go command, and the net/http and go/types packages.
  It includes a fix to a bug introduced in Go 1.11.3 that broke go get for
  import path patterns containing &quot;...&quot; (boo#1119706). See the Go 1.11.4 milestone on our
  issue tracker for details.

    go#29233 crypto/x509: CPU denial of service
  * Upstream is aware of a functionality regression in &quot;go get&quot; when
    executed in GOPATH mode on an import path pattern containing &quot;...&quot;
    (e.g., &quot;go get github.com/golang/pkg/...&quot;), when downloading
    packages not already present in the GOPATH workspace. This is go#29241
    and will be resolved in the next minor patch release go-1.11.4
- Fix build error with PIE linker flags on ppc64le. bsc#1113978 boo#1098017

  go1.9.2 (released 2017/10/25) includes fixes to the compiler,
  linker, runtime, documentation, go command, and the crypto/x509,
  database/sql, log, and net/smtp packages. It includes a fix to a
  bug introduced in Go 1.9.1 that broke go get of non-Git
  repositories under certain conditions. See the Go 1.9.2 milestone
  on our issue tracker for details.
- Install $GOROOT/lib packages, to include upstream files such as the timezone
  database. bsc#1064522

  * net/smtp: fix PlainAuth to refuse to send passwords to non-TLS
    servers (CVE-2017-15042, bsc#1062087)
  * cmd/go: arbitrary code execution during “go get” or “go get -d”
    (CVE-2017-15041, bsc#1062085)
- Update to go1.9
  There are two changes to the language: adding support for type aliases and
  defining when implementations may fuse floating point operations. Most of the
  changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries. As
  always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of compatibility. We expect
  almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.
  The release adds transparent monotonic time support, parallelizes compilation
  of functions within a package, better supports test helper functions, includes
  a new bit manipulation package, and has a new concurrent map type.
  Remove patches:
    - fix_certificates_lookup.patch
    - runtime-bump-MaxGomaxprocs.patch
- Fixed incorrectly ghosted files
- add fix-sanitizer-build-against-latest-glibc.patch which fixes
  the sanitizer built against certain glibc versions
- go-race: add compiler-rt TSAN binary, necessary for the race detector builds
  to work. This requires building compiler-rt from source (becuase upstream Go
  stores precompiled binaries in the tree, and we cannot use them). In
  addition, a %check was added purely to ensure that we don't install the wrong
  version of compiler-rt. boo#1052528
- go-rpmlintrc: add some entries to address the .syso additions.
- Remove ruby requirement. golang-macros are not ruby anymore, plus
  this requirement should have been in the golang-packaging package
- Simplify all the &quot;ifdef suse_version&quot; by removing versions which
  have reach eol (13.* 42.1 sle11*)
- Add gcc6-go.patch for sle12 and leap42.x and use binutils-gold
  except for s390x/s390
  Remove gcc5-go.patch cause we use gcc6 for sle12 and leap42.x and
  gcc7 for newer versions (factory)
- build with binutils-gold on aarch64, which is hardcoded to
 be used for shared linking due to bugs in BFD binutils
- Build with gcc-7 on Tumbleweed
  + Add gcc7-go.patch
- Minor update to go1.8.3
  Fixes included:
  * go1.8.2 (released 2017/05/23) includes a security fix to the
    crypto/elliptic package (CVE-2017-8932, bsc#1040618).
  * go1.8.3 (released 2017/05/24) includes fixes to the compiler, runtime,
    documentation, and the database/sql package.
- Enable gccgo with gcc-6 for SLE12
- fix update-alternatives usage. This way, we can either use go1.7 or
  go 1.8 without having to change the docker spec file or any other
  package that requires go 1.7 but it will require go 1.8 in the
  future.
- Update to go1.8.1
  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. There are two minor changes to the language specification. As
  always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of compatibility. We expect
  almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.
  The release adds support for 32-bit MIPS, updates the compiler back end to
  generate more efficient code, reduces GC pauses by eliminating stop-the-world
  stack rescanning, adds HTTP/2 Push support, adds HTTP graceful shutdown, adds
  more context support, enables profiling mutexes, and simplifies sorting
  slices.

  Update patches:
    - allow-binary-only-packages.patch
    - gcc5-go.patch
    - gcc6-go.patch
- Remove mercurial build dependency. Mercurial is a version control
  system, like git. We are not using this in the build service to
  get the sources.
- Do not set GOBIN. If GOBIN is unset, by default go assumes GOPATH/bin.
  This way, the user can change GOPATH without the need to change GOBIN.
  fix bsc#1026658
- minor update to go1.7.5 because this is required by
  docker-v17.04.00-ce (bsc#1034053)
  fixes included:
  * go1.7.1 (released 2016/09/07) includes fixes to the compiler, runtime,
    documentation, and the compress/flate, hash/crc32, io, net, net/http,
    path/filepath, reflect, and syscall packages.
    See the Go 1.7.1 milestone on our issue tracker for details:
      https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.7.1

    and the crypto/x509 and time packages.
    See the Go 1.7.5 milestone on our issue tracker for details:
      https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.7.5
- Add a patch to bump _MaxGomaxprocs so that things like Docker and k8s can run
  properly on NUMA machines. Don't bump this number too high. bsc#1028865
  + runtime-bump-MaxGomaxprocs.patch
- set libdir for s390x in go.sh
- define go_arch to s390x
- Added s390x to the list of architectures that get built.
- Disable stripping to fix __.PKGDEF issues. bsc#964546
  There is an upstream issue about it as well, with a patch which will
  hopefully make Go more resilient to this issue.
                   https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17890
- Make sure we build go using gcc-go in Factory cause there is no go1.4
- update to go1.7.0 (bsc#996303)
  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain,
  runtime, and libraries. There is one minor change to the language
  specification.
  The release adds a port to IBM LinuxOne; updates the x86-64 compiler
  back end to generate more efficient code; includes the context package,
  promoted from the x/net subrepository and now used in the standard
  library; and adds support in the testing package for creating
  hierarchies of tests and benchmarks. The release also finalizes
  the vendoring support started in Go 1.5, making it a standard feature.

  * fix by upstream
- add gcc5-go.patch
  * find /usr/bin/go-5 when bootstrapping with gcc5-go
- use update-alternatives for /usr/bin/go and profiles.d
  so it can be co-installed with go1.4
- fix update from 1.3.3
  Update from 1.3.3 was broken in this commit
  https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/devel:languages:go/go?linkrev=base&amp;rev=205
  That commit fixed a dangling symlink in src (src/pkg) by instead
  symlinking src, which broke compatibility.
  This commit fixes it by, instead, symlinking all the files in src.
- macros.go: fix missing quotes in %goinstall (bsc#939067)
- macros.go: fix &quot;summary-not-capitalized&quot;
- macros.go:
  * *-doc can't properly describe what the sub-package really is,
    and they're mostly source codes instead of the claimed &quot;API,
    documentation, and examples&quot;. so rename to *-source. and not
    recommend to install them to save users' disk space.
  * %%go_requires should be handled automatically by golang-packaging
  * not recommend to install source package any more,
    so %%go_recommmends set to nil.
- macros.go:
  * add a &quot;WITH_FAKE_BUILDID&quot; option to enable the fake build ID
    compution.
  * to fake build ID, you have to make sure your package has only
    one binary. it is nonsense that two or more nonidentical
    binaries have the same build ID.
- enable debuginfo
  * the strip workaround (boo#818502) does not need any more
  * re-enable debug_packge/debug_install_post macros
- add patch: go-1.4.2-rel.plt-alignment.patch
  * cmd/ld: set alignment for the .rel.plt section on 32-bit architectures
  * https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9802
  * or i586 build will fail at extracting debuginfo
- macros.go:
  * re-enable debug_packge/debug_install_post macros from goprep()
  * add ldflags to gobuild() to compute BUILD ID for debuginfo package
- go itself doesn't support BUILD ID yet
- Remove fix_certificates_lookup_on_sles11.patch: this is superseded
  by fix_certificates.patch
- Add fix_certificates_lookup.patch: force Go to look for certificates only
  in the locations available on openSUSE and SLE. Also ensure certificates
  are found on SLE11 (previous fix_certificates_lookup_on_sles11.patch)
- Add fix_certificates_lookup_on_sles11.patch: this patch is required
  to have Go programs read the system certificates on SLE11.
  See issue https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6391
- Fix building of all the Go packages under devel:languages:go. The
  %goprep macro contained some unescaped lines, causing go install to
  attempt the installation of the build artifacts outside of the
  buildroot.
- disable debuginfo/debug package creation on all golang packages
  * .a files in golang doesn't contain debuginfo right now,
    so extract a debug package will cause
    &quot;Failed to write file: invalid section alignment&quot;
    and we don't need to bother stripping them.
  * we can't depend on good luck for all golang packages, hoping
    they'll pass the build and not randomly fail.
- remove &quot;go_disable_brp_strip_static_archive&quot; macro from macros.go,
  which contains redefinition of os_install_post too.
- disable debug package generation for all architectures, because:
  * build IDs are not generated at all, even for successful builds
  * &quot;Failed to write file: invalid section alignment&quot; on arm/i586.
- remove redefinition of os_install_post macro, which was used to
  override brp-strip-static-archive that has been manually removed
  from openSUSE distribution since 2011.05.
- This might fix i586 builds for openSUSE:Factory:
  * Too many levels of recursion in macro expansion
  * Failed to write file: invalid section alignment
- Added Obsoletes for go-vim/emacs, they went to separate projects
- Fix dangling-symlink /usr/lib64/go/src/pkg /usr/share/go/src/pkg
- allow-binary-only-packages.patch: Revert missed patch and update for 1.4
- Updated to 1.4.2:
  Support of editors has been dropped
- Updated to 1.3.3: includes further bug fixes to cgo, the runtime package,s
  and the nacl port.
- Changes associated with release 1.3.2: includes bug fixes to cgo and the
  crypto/tls packages. See the change history for details (bnc#898901 -
  CVE-2014-7189).
- avoid stripping debuginfo on arm, it fails (and is not necessary)
- add armv6l.patch
  * workaround for qemu-arm bug
  * under qemu on armv6 the number of unix signals isn't 64 but 63.
    thus there is an off-by-one error while building and testing.
    this fix now reduces the constant defining the number of signals
    by 1, but that of course means signal handling won't be 100%
    correct.
  * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/MqKTX_XIOKE
- Revert the /usr/share/go/contrib symlink as it caused problems
  during update. Moved all go sources to /usr/share/go/contrib/src
  instead of /usr/share/go/contrib/src/pkg and created pkg and src
  symlinks in contrib to add it to GOPATH
- Fixed %go_contribsrcdir value
- Copy temporary macros.go as go.macros to avoid it to be built
- Do not modify Source: files, because that makes the .src.rpm
  being tied to one specific arch.
- Removed extra src folder in /usr/share/go/contrib: the goal is to
  transform this folder into a proper entry for GOPATH. This folder
  is now linked to %{_libdir}/go/contrib
- go requires gcc to build sources using cgo
- tools-packaging.patch: Allow building cover and vet tools in
  $GOROOT_TARGET/pkg/tool instead of $GOROOT/pkg/tool. This will
  allow building go tools as a separate package
- add new macro godoc_package &amp; go_recommends to easy packaging
- Update to version 1.3.1:
  - bug fixes to the compiler and the runtime, net, and crypto/rsa packages
- Fix download url.
- Rename rpmlintrc to %{name}-rpmlintrc.
  Follow the packaging guidelines.
- Update to version 1.3:
  see http://golang.org/doc/go1.3
- refreshed patches to apply cleanly again:
  - go-build-dont-reinstall-stdlibs.patch
  - verbose-build.patch
- Update to version 1.2:
  + No real changes since RC2
- Add %go_tooldir macro and create the tools directory in %goprep
- Update to version 1.2rc2:
  + New packages: encoding, image/color/palette
  + Performance improvements
  + Three-index slices
  + godoc and vet commands moved to go-go.tools package
    * Removed godoc-path-locations.patch and godoc.service
  + Check golang.org/doc/go1.2 for a full list of changes
- Fix go_ver macro to provide the version number again
- Fix Factory i586 build failure by stripping binaries earlier.
- Rework %go_prep again, use &quot;shopt -s dotglob&quot; to catch hidden files
- Change %go_requires to &quot;Require: go &gt;= %go_ver&quot; instead of
  &quot;Require: go-devel = %go_ver&quot;. Go follows a stable release policy which
  means patch-level updates are (supposed to be) compatible.
- Update to version 1.1.2:
  + includes fixes to the gc compiler and cgo, and the bufio, runtime, syscall,
    and time packages. See the change history for details. If you use package
    syscall's Getrlimit and Setrlimit functions under Linux on the ARM or 386
    architectures, please note change 55ac276af5a7 that fixes issue 5949.
- Fix %go_prep again: Also move hidden files (.$BLA)
- Also set ExclusiveArch in %go_requires macro. Allows to drop
  %go_exclusivearch again
- Fix %go_prep macro: Find directories in %_builddir based on Go
  package name prefix (not exact match).
- Fix URL
- Add %go_exclusivearch macro. It's better to only specify ExclusiveArch
  in the &quot;go&quot; package instead of all Go packages. Avoids errors once
  Go becomes available on more architectures
- Fix godoc path locations patch
- Update to Go 1.1.1
- cmd/gc: compute initialization order for top-level blank vars
- cmd/gc: save local var list before inlining
- cmd/gc: fix missing slice/array types in export data.

- runtime: zeroize g-&gt;fnstart to not prevent GC of the closure.
- cmd/gc: repair make(T) in export data for inlining.i
- runtime: fix GC scanning of slices
- cmd/gc: do not corrupt init() with initializers of _ in closures.
- runtime: introduce cnewarray() to simplify allocation of typed
  arrays.
- Package changes
  - macros.go: update go version macro to cut trailing characters
    added by new style of &quot;go version&quot; identifier string
  - Update openSUSE specific patches to cleanly apply against Go 1.1
- Update package source and version to Go 1.1
- Full release notes for Go 1.1 can be found online here:
  http://golang.org/doc/go1.1
- There are too many bug fixes to list individually; details of all
  bugs fixed can be found on the issue tracker tagged with Go1.1
  http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/list?can=1&amp;q=label%3AGo1.1
- Language changes which may affect your existing programmes
  - Integer division by zero: http://golang.org/doc/go1.1#divzero
  - Surrogates in unicode literals: http://golang.org/doc/go1.1#unicode_literals
  - Method values: http://golang.org/doc/go1.1#method_values
  - Return requirements: http://golang.org/doc/go1.1#return
- The majority of improvements in this release are performance related
  with optimizations in the compiler and linker, garbage collection,
  goroutine scheduler, map/hashmap implementation and numerous speedups
  in the standard library. Please see the full release notes for details.
- One noteworthy addition to the toolchain is the addition of a race
  detector. This should help improve the memory safety and accuracy of
  your concurrent Go programmes. Race detection versions of the standard
  library are included in this package update. You can find instructions
  for building librarys and programmes with race detection in the manual:
  http://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html
- Drop the go-kate package, the syntax is already shipped with
  libktexteditor package
- Remove misc documentation. It doesn't contain anything really useful
  and several files are found in other (sub-)packages (bnc#788344)
- Update to version 1.0.3:
  - Improved documentation
  - List of fixed issues:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/co3SvXbGrNk
  - More details can be found on this full list of changes:
    http://code.google.com/p/go/source/list?name=release-branch.go1
- Removed:
  - opensuse-vim.patch, merged upstream
  - Fix for bnc#686557, offending pdf was removed upstream
- BNC#776058
	- Add new patch to prevent the go install tool trying to reinstall
	  std library packages that are dependencies of third party packages.
	- Using touch on the precompiled archives introdoces additional
	  problems with the go install tool. Instead, we simply don't mark
	  std library files as stale when a third party package is evaluated
	  for installation. The behaviour remains unchanged for the root
	  user and while it is inadvisable to manually reinstall standard
	  libraries using the openSUSE packages, we do not disallow it.
- Spec changes
	- Remove redundant requires for ed/bison
	- Minor tweaks for cross distro builds based on FC/Mageia/Mandriva
- Macro changes
	- Tweak the BRP strip macro to work on RHEL based distros
- Add go-wiki xml widget
- BNC#776058
- spec changes, reverse positions of compiled items and package
  source in the %install section. touch compiled package archives
  after source is installed for go-doc, this prevents the go tool
  trying to re-compile/install std libraries.
- Patch vim Godoc and Import plugins.
- Update spec file.
  - Instead of using tarball generated from a repo checkout, switch
    tarball source and use upstream official tarball.
  - Remove dependance on VERSION file, make spec more robust for
    future updates.
- remove unavailable -x verbose flag from go fix macro
- fix some qemu-arm compilation errors by passing -x to go always
- Update to bugfix release 1.0.2
- This fixes two major bugs:
  3695 runtime: computed hash value for struct map key ignores
  some fields
  3573 runtime: use of large map key causes crash
- Additionally, this fixes numerous smaller documentation and code
  fixes, details can be found on this full list of changes:
  http://code.google.com/p/go/source/list?name=release-branch.go1
- Some Fedora_16 build fixes (i.e. added suse macros)

- Fixed some typos
- Removed checks for outdated SUSE versions
- update profile.d go.sh with $GOBIN for users
- cmd/go - re-enable building from binary only packages
  we are a binary distro and the last minue change to go clean -i
  disabled building from third party binary packages. package management
  will be done via yast/zypper anyway and not go clean.
- change provides to match go release string as per VERSION file
- fix %pre, %post etc godoc service statement
- Export $GOBIN for the %gobuild() macro

This weekly snapshot includes a re-organization of the Go tools.
Only the go, godoc, and gofmt tools are installed to $GOROOT/bin (or $GOBIN).
The remainder are installed to $GOROOT/bin/tool.
This puts the lesser-used tools (6g, cgo, govet, etc.) outside the user PATH.
Instead these tools may be called through the go tool with 'go tool command'.
For example, to vet hello.go you would type 'go tool vet hello.go'.
Type 'go tool' see the list of available tools.
With the move, some tools were given simpler names:
       6cov    -&gt; cov
       6nm     -&gt; nm
       goapi   -&gt; api
       gofix   -&gt; fix
       gopack  -&gt; pack
       gopprof -&gt; pprof
       govet   -&gt; vet
       goyacc  -&gt; yacc
The os/signal package has been moved to	exp/signal.
A new tool named 'dist'	has been introduced to	handle building the gc
tool chain and to bootstrap the go tool. The old build scripts and make
files have been removed.
Full list of changes and fixes available:
http://weekly.golang.org/doc/devel/weekly.html#2012-02-07
- Satisfy Factory-Auto (only comment out %path, not Patch)
- Update to latest tip
- Now use cmd/dist to build toolchain, build scripts are removed
  build process is now as follows.
  build cmd/dist C based bootstrap tool
    -&gt; compile C based compilers and Go based bootstrap tool
	  -&gt; compile Go based core commands and libraries
- Remove patch that affects, cmd/go/{build,pkg}.go , this command
  is under active development and building against binary installs
  is slated to be included before Go1 release.
- Patch: quick hack to try and get packages building against third
  party libs if they are installed as binary archives without source
- Update some spec file entries for changing $GOROOT layout, mainly
  $GOROOT/bin/go-tools
- Add $GOBIN back for now
- spec tweaks, use default locations for go tooling
  (compilers, linkers, cgo etc all in $GOROOT now)
- remove $GOBIN from /etc/profile.d/go.sh
- Update to weekly.2012-01-27

- Add %goinstall() macro for new go tool
- Update godoc path locations patch
- Update go install patch (fixes building packages with &quot;go install&quot;)
- Update to weekly.2012-01-20
- The image package's Tiled type has been renamed to Repeated.
- The encoding/xml package has been changed to make more idiomatic
  use of struct tags, among other things. If you use the xml package
  please read the change description to see if your code is affected:
		http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=70e914beb409
- exp/sql package to database/sql
- Package net's SetTimeout methods were changed to SetDeadline.
- Many functions in package os now take a os.FileMode argument instead
  of a plain uint32. An os.ModeSticky constant is also now defined.
- The meaning of the first buffer element for image.YCbCr has changed to
  match the semantics of the other image types like image.RGBA.
- The NewMD5, NewSHA1 and NewSHA256 functions in crypto/hmac have been
  deprecated. Use New instead, explicitly passing the hash function.
- Patch new &quot;go install&quot; to allow -s option
  This prevents rebuild/reinstall of std libs and allows packages
  to be installed into a users $GOPATH
- Update to weekly.2011.12.22
- changes to the images/ycbcr and testing packages
  * &quot;gofix&quot; required for code using images/ycbr

- Use $GOBIN as install target directory for binaries (Make.cmd)
  regardless of $TARGDIR (Second part of bnc#735320)
- Improve macros %go_make, %go_make_test and %go_make_install:
  * Set TARGDIR and GOBIN all macros (bnc#735320)
  * Make sure %{buildroot}%{_bindir} exists in any case
- The above should simplify spec files for Go packages that use, .e.g.,
  'make tools' to install additional stuff (like binaries)
- Set GOBIN correctly in Make.inc to point to _bindir instead
  of GOROOT/bin (bnc#735288)
- Forgot to update VERSION file
