%description
The GAP package "CRISP" provides algorithsmf roc omputing subgroups
of finite solvable groups related to a group class 'C'. In
particular, it allows to compute 'C' radicals and 'C'-injectors for
Fitting (and Fitting sets) 'C', 'C'-residuals for formations 'C', and
'C'-projectors for Schunck classes 'C'.

Moreover, CRISP contains algorithms for the computation of normal
subgroups invariant under a prescribed set of automorphisms and
belonging to a given group class.
