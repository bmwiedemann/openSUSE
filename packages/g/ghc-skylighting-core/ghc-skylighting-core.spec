%description
Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library. It derives its tokenizers from
XML syntax definitions used by KDE's KSyntaxHighlighting framework, so any
syntax supported by that framework can be added. An optional command-line
program is provided. Skylighting is intended to be the successor to
highlighting-kate. This package provides the core highlighting functionality
under a permissive license. It also bundles XML parser definitions licensed
under the GPL.
