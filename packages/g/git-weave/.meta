  <title>Weave a tarball sequence into a git repository</title>
  <description>git-weave takes a tarball sequence and a metadata file and synthesizes a live
repository. It can invert this, explode git repositories into sequences of
per-commit tarballs. The DAG is expressed as a metadata file with mailbox-like
entries.</description>
