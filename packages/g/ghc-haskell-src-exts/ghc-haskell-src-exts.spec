%description
Haskell-Source with Extensions (HSE, haskell-src-exts) is a standalone parser
for Haskell. In addition to standard Haskell, all extensions implemented in GHC
are supported.

Apart from these standard extensions, it also handles regular patterns as per
the HaRP extension as well as HSX-style embedded XML syntax.
