Dear customer,

gpm is using more and more config files in /etc. Therefore we moved
all config files into /etc/gpm and removed "gpm-" from config file
names.

For example:
/etc/gpm-root.conf -> /etc/gpm/root.conf
/etc/gpm-syn.conf  -> /etc/gpm/syn.conf	  
...


Have a lot of fun,
				Your SuSE team
