    <comment>- Add %define go_label as a configurable Go toolchain directory
  * go_label can be used to package multiple Go toolchains with
    the same go_api
  * go_label should be defined as go_api with an optional suffix
    e.g. %{go_api} or %{go_api}-foo
  * Default go_label = go_api makes no changes to package layout (forwarded request 966740 from jfkw)</comment>
