Fri Nov 10 09:18:43 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.38.0:
  * `extension install` no longer errors unhelpfully if the
    extension is already installed
  * All tables now have headers
  * `project` commands have a clearer error message when no owner
    can be resolved
  * `workflow run` now presents a select for `choice` workflow
    input types
  * `codespace create` no longer polls for additional codespace
    permissions unnecessarily
  * `go install` now works with the removal of our crypto fork
- update to 2.37.0:
  * `project`: Remove `template` field from `--format=json`
    output
  * In v2.34.0 we introduced the `template` field when outputing
    projects to JSON, unfortunately we forgot to take into account
    our GHES users. This field does not exist on GHES 3.8 and older.
    Including this field in our queries and output broke nearly
    all the `project` commands for users targeting these older
    versions of GHES. As we try our hardest to keep `gh` compatible
    with all * non-deprecated GHES versions this was a pretty big
    mistake.  In order to fix it we are reverting the querying and
    exporting of the `template` field for `project` commands. We
    apologize for the inconvenience this may cause, and plan to
    bring back this field once GHES 3.8 gets deprecated.
  * `repo create`: Allow `--disable-issues` and `--template`
    flags to be used together
  * `repo create`: Allow `--homepage` and `--template` flag to be
    used together
  * `repo create`: Allow creating repositories from templates in
    interactive mode
  * `repo fork`: Set default repo when forking repo
  * `codespace`: Migrate all Codespaces operations from Live
    Share to Dev Tunnels
  * `codespace create`: Poll permission acceptance endpoint on
    codespace creation
  * `pr create`: Remove duplicates targets for push survey
  * `pr create`: Fix typo in documentation
  * `browse`: Do not use relative paths when `--repo` flag is
    used

- Update to 2.26.1
  https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.26.1

  What's Changed
  * extend secure storage default to auth refresh by @vilmibm in #7278

- Update to 2.26.1-pre0
  https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.26.1-pre0

  What's Changed
  * extend secure storage default to auth refresh by @vilmibm in #7278

- Update to 2.26.0
  https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.26.0

  Important: credentials now stored securely by default
    When running gh auth login, your credentials will now be stored in your operating system's
    credential storage instead of directly on disk. In other words, --secure-storage is now default
    behavior. We've added a new flag, --insecure-storage, to opt into the old insecure behavior in
    case you need to debug an issue with credential storage.

    As before, to take advantage of credential storage, please re-run gh auth login.
    For more context, you can read the v2.24.0 release notes

  What's New
  * Option to store gh access token in system encrypted storage
    The gh auth login and gh auth refresh commands gained the new --secure-storage flag.
    In this mode, the access token that GitHub CLI uses for GitHub API requests will now
    be stored in the system keyring instead of in the plain text config file.

    To migrate as an existing GitHub CLI user, re-authenticate like so:
      gh auth refresh --secure-storage -h github.com

    Depending on your system, you could get an interactive prompt to allow the CLI tool to access the system keyring. The systems that are supported are:
    * Keychain on macOS
    * GNOME Keyring on Linux (Secret Service dbus interface)
    * Wincred on Windows

    Please note:
    This feature is currently opt-in, but will become the default in the near future.
    If none of the system storage providers are found, or the store operation fails,
    the token will be written to the config file as before.

    Using this feature could result in Go extensions breaking if they were not updated to the latest go-gh version. If extensions you are using no longer work after migrating your token to secure token storage, please report the issue to that extension's repository.
    Storing tokens in system keyring most likely won't work in “headless” environments.
