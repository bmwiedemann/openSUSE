  <title>Contemporary Geometric Sans Serif Typeface</title>
  <description>Exo is a contemporary geometric sans serif typeface that
tries to convey a technological/futuristic feeling while
keeping an elegant design. Exo was meant to be a very
versatile font, so it has 9 weights (the maximum on the web)
each with a true italic version. It works great as a display
face but it also works good for small to intermediate size texts.
