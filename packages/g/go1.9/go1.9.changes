-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 18 08:52:45 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to go1.9

  There are two changes to the language: adding support for type aliases and
  defining when implementations may fuse floating point operations. Most of the
  changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries. As
  always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of compatibility. We expect
  almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.

  The release adds transparent monotonic time support, parallelizes compilation
  of functions within a package, better supports test helper functions, includes
  a new bit manipulation package, and has a new concurrent map type.

  Remove patches:
    - fix_certificates_lookup.patch
    - runtime-bump-MaxGomaxprocs.patch

Wed Aug  9 07:45:47 UTC 2017 - asarai@suse.com

- go-race: add compiler-rt TSAN binary, necessary for the race detector builds
  to work. This requires building compiler-rt from source (becuase upstream Go
  stores precompiled binaries in the tree, and we cannot use them). In
  addition, a %check was added purely to ensure that we don't install the wrong
  version of compiler-rt. boo#1052528
- go-rpmlintrc: add some entries to address the .syso additions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  future.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 27 14:16:00 UTC 2017 - thipp@suse.de

- Update to go1.8.1

  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. There are two minor changes to the language specification. As
  always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of compatibility. We expect
  almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.

  The release adds support for 32-bit MIPS, updates the compiler back end to
  generate more efficient code, reduces GC pauses by eliminating stop-the-world
  stack rescanning, adds HTTP/2 Push support, adds HTTP graceful shutdown, adds
  more context support, enables profiling mutexes, and simplifies sorting
  slices.

- Remove mercurial build dependency. Mercurial is a version control
  system, like git. We are not using this in the build service to
  get the sources.

- Do not set GOBIN. If GOBIN is unset, by default go assumes GOPATH/bin.
  This way, the user can change GOPATH without the need to change GOBIN.

- update to go1.7.0 (bsc#996303)

  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain,
  runtime, and libraries. There is one minor change to the language
  specification.

  The release adds a port to IBM LinuxOne; updates the x86-64 compiler
  back end to generate more efficient code; includes the context package,
  promoted from the x/net subrepository and now used in the standard
  library; and adds support in the testing package for creating
  hierarchies of tests and benchmarks. The release also finalizes
  the vendoring support started in Go 1.5, making it a standard feature.

  attempt the installation of the build artifacts outside of the
  buildroot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 30 15:18:44 UTC 2015 - i@marguerite.su

- disable debuginfo/debug package creation on all golang packages
  * .a files in golang doesn't contain debuginfo right now,
    so extract a debug package will cause
    "Failed to write file: invalid section alignment"
    and we don't need to bother stripping them.
  * we can't depend on good luck for all golang packages, hoping
    they'll pass the build and not randomly fail.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 20 12:43:46 UTC 2015 - i@marguerite.su

- remove "go_disable_brp_strip_static_archive" macro from macros.go,
  which contains redefinition of os_install_post too.
- disable debug package generation for all architectures, because:
  * build IDs are not generated at all, even for successful builds
  * "Failed to write file: invalid section alignment" on arm/i586.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 19 09:58:09 UTC 2015 - i@marguerite.su

- remove redefinition of os_install_post macro, which was used to
  override brp-strip-static-archive that has been manually removed
  from openSUSE distribution since 2011.05.
- This might fix i586 builds for openSUSE:Factory:
  * Too many levels of recursion in macro expansion
  * Failed to write file: invalid section alignment

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  7 15:24:29 UTC 2015 - i@marguerite.su

- Added Obsoletes for go-vim/emacs, they went to separate projects

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 21 15:07:15 UTC 2014 - dmueller@suse.com

- avoid stripping debuginfo on arm, it fails (and is not necessary)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 17 02:02:55 UTC 2014 - sebastian.kratz@piraten-ahoi.de

- add armv6l.patch
  * workaround for qemu-arm bug
  * under qemu on armv6 the number of unix signals isn't 64 but 63.
    thus there is an off-by-one error while building and testing.
    this fix now reduces the constant defining the number of signals
    by 1, but that of course means signal handling won't be 100%
    correct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 26 13:14:55 UTC 2014 - cbosdonnat@suse.com

- Revert the /usr/share/go/contrib symlink as it caused problems
  during update. Moved all go sources to /usr/share/go/contrib/src
  instead of /usr/share/go/contrib/src/pkg and created pkg and src
  symlinks in contrib to add it to GOPATH

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 25 12:31:43 UTC 2014 - cbosdonnat@suse.com

- Fixed %go_contribsrcdir value

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 22 19:45:17 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Do not modify Source: files, because that makes the .src.rpm
  being tied to one specific arch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 16 15:15:20 UTC 2014 - cbosdonnat@suse.com

- Removed extra src folder in /usr/share/go/contrib: the goal is to
  transform this folder into a proper entry for GOPATH. This folder
  is now linked to %{_libdir}/go/contrib
- go requires gcc to build sources using cgo
- tools-packaging.patch: Allow building cover and vet tools in
  $GOROOT_TARGET/pkg/tool instead of $GOROOT/pkg/tool. This will
  allow building go tools as a separate package

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 13 14:10:54 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Rework %go_prep again, use "shopt -s dotglob" to catch hidden files
- Change %go_requires to "Require: go >= %go_ver" instead of
  "Require: go-devel = %go_ver". Go follows a stable release policy which
  means patch-level updates are (supposed to be) compatible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 13 12:32:44 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 1.1.2:
  + includes fixes to the gc compiler and cgo, and the bufio, runtime, syscall,
    and time packages. See the change history for details. If you use package
    syscall's Getrlimit and Setrlimit functions under Linux on the ARM or 386
    architectures, please note change 55ac276af5a7 that fixes issue 5949.

  package name prefix (not exact match).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 13 07:27:24 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Fix URL
- Add %go_exclusivearch macro. It's better to only specify ExclusiveArch

- Update package source and version to Go 1.1
- Full release notes for Go 1.1 can be found online here:
  http://golang.org/doc/go1.1
- There are too many bug fixes to list individually; details of all
  bugs fixed can be found on the issue tracker tagged with Go1.1
  http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AGo1.1
- Language changes which may affect your existing programmes
  - Integer division by zero: http://golang.org/doc/go1.1#divzero

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  5 03:46:15 UTC 2012 - graham@andtech.eu

- BNC#776058
	- Add new patch to prevent the go install tool trying to reinstall
	  std library packages that are dependencies of third party packages.
	- Using touch on the precompiled archives introdoces additional
	  problems with the go install tool. Instead, we simply don't mark
	  std library files as stale when a third party package is evaluated
	  for installation. The behaviour remains unchanged for the root
	  user and while it is inadvisable to manually reinstall standard
	  libraries using the openSUSE packages, we do not disallow it.
- Spec changes
	- Remove redundant requires for ed/bison
	- Minor tweaks for cross distro builds based on FC/Mageia/Mandriva

Wed Feb  8 09:00:41 UTC 2012 - graham@andtech.eu

This weekly snapshot includes a re-organization of the Go tools.

Only the go, godoc, and gofmt tools are installed to $GOROOT/bin (or $GOBIN).
The remainder are installed to $GOROOT/bin/tool.
This puts the lesser-used tools (6g, cgo, govet, etc.) outside the user PATH.
Instead these tools may be called through the go tool with 'go tool command'.
For example, to vet hello.go you would type 'go tool vet hello.go'.
Type 'go tool' see the list of available tools.

With the move, some tools were given simpler names:
       6cov    -> cov
       6nm     -> nm
       goapi   -> api
       gofix   -> fix
       gopack  -> pack
       gopprof -> pprof
       govet   -> vet
       goyacc  -> yacc

The os/signal package has been moved to	exp/signal.

A new tool named 'dist'	has been introduced to	handle building the gc
tool chain and to bootstrap the go tool. The old build scripts and make
files have been removed.

Full list of changes and fixes available:

- Update to latest tip
- Now use cmd/dist to build toolchain, build scripts are removed
  build process is now as follows.

  build cmd/dist C based bootstrap tool
    -> compile C based compilers and Go based bootstrap tool
	  -> compile Go based core commands and libraries

- Remove patch that affects, cmd/go/{build,pkg}.go , this command
  is under active development and building against binary installs
  is slated to be included before Go1 release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 30 06:12:26 UTC 2011 - graham@andtech.eu

- Patch new "go install" to allow -s option
  This prevents rebuild/reinstall of std libs and allows packages
  to be installed into a users $GOPATH

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 23 13:02:09 UTC 2011 - graham@andtech.eu

- Update to weekly.2011.12.22

- Use $GOBIN as install target directory for binaries (Make.cmd)
  regardless of $TARGDIR (Second part of bnc#735320)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 13 14:06:38 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Improve macros %go_make, %go_make_test and %go_make_install:
  * Set TARGDIR and GOBIN all macros (bnc#735320)
  * Make sure %{buildroot}%{_bindir} exists in any case
- The above should simplify spec files for Go packages that use, .e.g.,
  'make tools' to install additional stuff (like binaries)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  7 00:01:59 UTC 2011 - dmacvicar@suse.de
