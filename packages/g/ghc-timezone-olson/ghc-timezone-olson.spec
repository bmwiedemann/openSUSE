%description
A parser and renderer for binary Olson timezone files whose format is specified
by the tzfile(5) man page on Unix-like systems. For more information about this
format, see <http://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/tz-link.html>.
Functions are provided for converting the parsed data into 'TimeZoneSeries'
objects from the timezone-series package. On many platforms, binary Olson
timezone files suitable for use with this package are available in the
directory %{_datadir}/zoneinfo and its subdirectories on your computer.
For a way to read binary Olson timezone files at compile time, see the
timezone-olson-th package
(<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-olson-th>).
