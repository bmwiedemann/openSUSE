  * BUG: Draw.Line() correctly takes into account the LineStyle property in
    all cases now.
  * BUG: Fix the dash patterns used for implementing the Draw.LineStyle
    property.

  * BUG: Draw.End() now resets anti-aliasing to TRUE.
  * BUG: If the Layout property of HSplit or VSplit controls does not receive

    not compatible with the GPL.
  [GB.JIT]

    property.
  [GB.OPENGL]
  * BUG: Fix the missing "gl" prefix on two OpenGL calls.
  [GB.QT4]
  * BUG: TextLabel: Automatic size is correctly computed now. Apparently
    there are internal changes in the Qt library that made it false.
  * BUG: Text can be drop on TextBox and TextArea controls again, unless
    their Drop property is set. In that case, the dnd behavior is entirely
    controlled by Gambas.
  * BUG: Correctly free the internal clipboard formats list when the
    clipboard contents changes. This avoids possible crashes.
  * BUG: Correctly handle UTF-8 when displaying the error message.
  * BUG: Fix Align.IsBottom() and Align.IsMiddle().
  * BUG: Key.Normal now works correctly with numeric pad keys.

    more than 100 new features
  + The main new feature of Gambas 3.2 is the new Just-In-Time
    compiler made by Emil Lenngren, that can make a function or an
    entire class up to 100 times faster!
  + Otherwise the other main changes are:
  ++ gb.gtk.opengl is a new component that allows to use OpenGL
     in GTK+ applications.
  ++ gb.media is a new component based on GStreamer.
  ++ gb.ncurses is a new component based on the ncurses library
     made by Tobias Boege.

  + French, Czech and Catalan translations were updated.
  And two security holes were closed:
  + String hashing algorithm has been randomized.
    See that document for the details.
  + In the IDE, you cannot get the project version by running a
    program (what a stupid idea!). Now you get it from a text file
    located in a parent directory of the project.
