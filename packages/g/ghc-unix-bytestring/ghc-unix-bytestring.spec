%description
Unix/Posix-specific functions for ByteStrings.

Provides 'ByteString' file-descriptor based I/O API, designed loosely after the
'String' file-descriptor based I/O API in "System.Posix.IO". The functions here
wrap standard C implementations of the functions specified by the ISO/IEC
9945-1:1990 (``POSIX.1'') and X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4, Version 2
(``XPG4.2'') specifications.

Note that this package doesn't require the 'unix' package as a dependency.
But you'll need it in order to get your hands on an 'Fd', so we're not offering
a complete replacement.
