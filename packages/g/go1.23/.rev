    <comment>- go1.23 (released 2024-08-13) is a major release of Go.
  go1.23.x minor releases will be provided through August 2025.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.23 arrives six months after go1.22. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
