%description
This package provides Haskell bindings to the the [POSIX network database
(<netdb.h>)
API](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009696699/basedefs/netdb.h.html).

=== Relationship to the 'network' package

The 'network' package version 2.* series provides "Network.BSD" but it is
removed starting with 'network' version 3.0.

This package provides the "Network.BSD" module split off from the
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network network package>.

If in addition to the 'network''s modules also "Network.BSD" is necessary, add
'network-bsd' to your dependencies like so:

> library > build-depends: network >= 2.7 && < 3.1 > , network-bsd >= 2.7 && <
2.9

I.e. you can control the version of the 'network' package independently.

__NOTE__: Starting with 'network-bsd-2.8.1.0' the APIs of 'network' and
'network-bsd' evolve differently, and consequently the versioning doesn't match
up anymore! Moreover, also starting with version 'network-bsd-2.8.1.0' this
package requires 'network >= 3' in order to avoid module name clashes with
'network < 3''s "Network.BSD" module.

However, 'network-bsd-2.7.0.0' and 'network-bsd-2.8.0.0' passes thru the
"Network.BSD" module from 'network-2.7.*' and 'network-2.8.*' respectively in a
non-clashing way via Cabal's
<https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-library-reexported-modules
reexported-modules> feature while ensuring a well-defined
<https://pvp.haskell.org/ API versioning> of the observable API of
'network-bsd'. This is why the example above supporting a wide range of
'network' versions works by including version 2.7.0.0 in the required version
range of 'network-bsd'.
