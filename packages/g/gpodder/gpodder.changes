    only_sync_not_played configuration option was not followed when the

    that podcast were forced to be copied to the device; this is now fixed, and

    track whether or not the notification has already been shown previously
  * YouTube: better error message for protected videos: YouTube protects pages

    over 18; we can't determine the fmt_url_map in that case, so this patch
    adds a better error message to the failed download
  * ignore invalid timestamp from iPod (bug 418)
  * add support for file:// URLs for feeds (bug 1229)
