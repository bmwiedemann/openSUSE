%description
It provides a graphic interface that allows performing the key
tasks related to controlling the CDEmu daemon, such as loading and
unloading devices, displaying devices' status and
retrieving/setting devices' debug masks.

In addition, the application listens to signals emitted by
CDEmu daemon and provides notifications via libnotify (provided
that python bindings are installed).

Features:
 * GTK+ application.
 * Supports communication via either session or system bus.
 * Device status display, device loading and unloading.
 * Support for getting/setting device's debug masks.
 * Daemon and device status changes notification via libnotify.
