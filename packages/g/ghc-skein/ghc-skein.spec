%description
Skein (<http://www.skein-hash.info/>) is a family of fast secure cryptographic
hash functions designed by Niels Ferguson, Stefan Lucks, Bruce Schneier, Doug
Whiting, Mihir Bellare, Tadayoshi Kohno, Jon Callas and Jesse Walker.

This package uses bindings to the optimized C implementation of Skein.
We provide a high-level interface (see module "Crypto.Skein") to some of the
Skein use cases. We also provide a low-level interface (see module
"Crypto.Skein.Internal") should you need to use Skein in a different way.

Currently we have support for Skein as cryptographic hash function as Skein as
a message authentication code (Skein-MAC). For examples of how to use this
package, see "Crypto.Skein" module documentation.

This package includes Skein v1.3. Versions of this package before 1.0.0
implemented Skein v1.1.
