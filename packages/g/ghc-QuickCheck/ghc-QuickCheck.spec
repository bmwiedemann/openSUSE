%description
QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties. The
programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of properties
which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the properties
hold in a large number of randomly generated cases. Specifications are
expressed in Haskell, using combinators provided by QuickCheck.
QuickCheck provides combinators to define properties, observe the distribution
of test data, and define test data generators.

Most of QuickCheck's functionality is exported by the main "Test.QuickCheck"
module. The main exception is the monadic property testing library in
"Test.QuickCheck.Monadic".

If you are new to QuickCheck, you can try looking at the following resources:

* The <http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/manual.html official
QuickCheck manual>. It's a bit out-of-date in some details and doesn't cover
newer QuickCheck features, but is still full of good advice. *
<https://begriffs.com/posts/2017-01-14-design-use-quickcheck.html>, a detailed
tutorial written by a user of QuickCheck.

The <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-instances
quickcheck-instances> companion package provides instances for types in Haskell
Platform packages at the cost of additional dependencies.
