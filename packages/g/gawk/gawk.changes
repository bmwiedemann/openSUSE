Mon Sep  5 08:49:14 UTC 2022 - Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

- Update to gawk 5.2.0
  * Numeric scalars now compare in the same way as C for the relational
    operators. Comparison order for sorting has not changed
  * If the AWK_HASH environment variable is set to "fnv1a" gawk will
    use the FNV1-A hash function for associative arrays
  * There is now a new function, mkbool(), that creates Boolean-typed
    values
  * As BWK awk has supported interval expressions since 2019, they are
    now enabled even if --traditional is supplied
  * The rwarray extension has two new functions, writeall() and readall()
  * The new `gawkbug' script should be used for reporting bugs
  * The manual page (doc/gawk.1) has been considerably reduced in size
  * Gawk now supports Terence Kelly's "persistent malloc" (pma),
    allowing gawk to preserve its variables, arrays and user-defined
    functions between runs
  * Some subtle issues with untyped array elements being passed to
    functions have been fixed
  * Syntax errors are now immediately fatal
- gawk-5.1.1-Disable-racy-test-in-test-iolint.awk.patch: removed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 31 11:36:18 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- GNU awk 5.1.1
  * asort and asorti now allow FUNCTAB and SYMTAB as the first
    argument if a second destination array is supplied. Similarly,
    using either array as the second argument is now a fatal error.
    Additionally, using either array as the destination for split(),
    match(), etc. also causes a fatal error.
  * The new -I/--trace option prints a trace of the byte codes as
    they are executed.
  * A number of subtle bugs relating to MPFR mode that caused
    differences between regular operation and MPFR mode have been
    fixed.
  * The API now handles MPFR/GMP values slightly differently,
    requiring different memory management for those values.
  * $0 and the fields are now cleared before starting a BEGINFILE
    rule.
  * Handling of Infinity and NaN values has been improved
  * The "no effect" lint warnings have been fixed up and now behave
    more sanely.
  * The behavior of strongly-typed regexp constants when passed as
    the third argument to sub() or gsub() has been clarified in the
    code and in the manual.
  * Similar to item #4 above, division by zero is now fatal in MPFR
    mode, as it is in regular mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 23 15:02:47 UTC 2021 - Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>

Wed Apr 15 08:48:59 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 5.1.0: 
  * The major version of the API is bumped to 3, something that should
     have happened at the 5.0.0 release but didn't.
  * A number of memory leak issues have been fixed.
  * Infrastructure upgrades: Bison 3.5.4, Texinfo 6.7, Gettext 0.20.1,
     Automake 1.16.2.
  * The indexing in the manual has been thoroughly revised, in particular
     making use of the facilities in Texinfo 6.7.  That version (or newer)
     must be used to format the manual.
  * MSYS2 is now supported out-of-the-box by configure.
  * Several bugs have been fixed.  See the ChangeLog for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 12 21:20:35 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- GNU awk 5.0.1:
  * Sandbox mode now disallows assigning new filename values in
    ARGV that were not there when gawk was invoked
  * The new argument "no-ext" to --lint disables "XXX is a gawk
    extension" lint warnings
- possibly incompatible changes in 5.0.0:
  * Add support for the POSIX standard %a and %A printf formats
  * Replace regex routines with those from GNULIB
  * PROCINFO["platform"] yields a string indicating the platform for
    which gawk was compiled.
  * Writing to elements of SYMTAB that are not variable names now
    causes a fatal error
  * New comment handling in the pretty-printer
  * Namespaces have been implemented. Files included with -i, read
    with -f, and command line program segments must all be self-
    contained syntactic units.
  * now uses the locale settings for ignoring case in single byte
    locales, instead of hardwiring in Latin-1

  * Multiple changes related to the pretty printer
  * The igawk script and igawk.1 man page are no longer installed
  * Gawk now processes a maximum of two hexadecimal digits in \x
    escape sequences inside strings
  * Setting PROCINFO["redirection", "NONFATAL"] to true makes I/O
    errors for "redirection" not fatal
  * Gawk now supports retryable I/O via PROCINFO[input-file, "RETRY"]
  * Revisions in the POSIX standard remove the special case for POSIX
    mode when FS = " " where newline was not a field separator
  * Gawk now supports strongly typed regexp constants
  * The new typeof() function can be used to indicate if a variable or
    array element is an array, regexp, string or number
  * Optimizations are now enabled by default
  * Passing negative operands to any of the bitwise functions now
    produces a fatal error
  * The mktime function now accepts an optional second argument
  * The FIELDWIDTHS parsing syntax has been enhanced to allow specifying
    how many characters to skip before a field starts
  * The PROCINFO["argv"] array records all of gawk's command line arguments
    as gawk received them
- gawk_ppc64le_ignore_transient_test_time_failure.patch: removed

  * manual improved
  * The debugger's "restart" command now works again.
  * Redirected getline is now allowed inside BEGINFILE/ENDFILE.
  * A number of bugs have been fixed in the MPFR code.
  * Indirect function calls now work for both built-in and extension
    functions.
  * Built-in functions are now included in FUNCTAB.
  * In non-English locales, it was accidentally possible to use
    non-english letters for identifiers
  * The "where" command has been added to the debugger as an alias
    for "backtrace".
  * Gawk no longer explicitly checks the current directory after
    doing a path search of AWKPATH.
  * Infrastructure upgrades: Automake 1.15, Gettext 0.19.4,
    Libtool 2.4.6, Bison 3.0.4.
  * If a user-defined function has a parameter with the same name
    as another user-defined function, it is no longer possible to
    call the second function from inside the first.
  * POSIX requires that the names of function parameters not be the
    same as any of the special built-in variables and also not
    conflict with the names of any functions. Gawk has checked for
    the former since 3.1.7. With --posix, it now also checks for
    the latter.
  * The test suite should check for necessary locales and skip the
    tests where it matters if support isn't what it should be.
  * Gawk now expects to be compiled on a system with multibyte
    character support.
- drop gawk-4.1.1-build-baddest.patch, upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  3 15:39:14 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- remove optional libsigsegv dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 29 20:28:42 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- GNU awk 4.1.1:
  * The "stat" extension now includes a "devbsize" element which
    indicates the units for the "nblocks" element.
  * A number of bugs in the pretty-printing / profiling code have
    been fixed.
  * The -O option now works again.
  * The --include option, documented since 4.0, now actually works.
  * Infrastructure updated to automake 1.13.4, bison 3.0.2, and
    libtool 2.4.2.418.
  * The configure script now accepts a --disable-extensions option,
    which disables checking for and building the extensions.
  * The API now provides functions pointers for malloc(), calloc(),
    realloc() and free(), to insure that the same memory allocation
    functions are always used. This bumps the minor version by one.
  * The printf quote flag now works correctly in locales with
    a different decimal point character but without a thousands
    separator character. If the thousands separator is a string,
    it will be correctly added to decimal numbers.
  * The readfile extension now has an input parser that will read
    whole files as a single record.
- packaging changes:
  * remove added German po file and scanning of translations
  * remove profiling, fixing warning make-check-outside-check-section

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 09:35:02 UTC 2013 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.1.0
  * The three executables gawk, pgawk, and dgawk, have been merged into
    one, named just gawk.
  * The new -i option (from xgawk) is used for loading awk library files.
  * The new -l option (from xgawk) is used for loading dynamic extensions.
  * The dynamic extension interface has been completely redone.  There is
    now a defined API for C extensions to use.  A C extension acts like
    a function written in awk, except that it cannot do everything that awk
    code can. However, this allows interfacing to any facility that is
    available from C.
  * The "inplace" extension, built using the new facility, can be used to
    simulate the GNU "sed -i" feature.
  * The and(), or() and xor() functions now take any number of arguments,
    with a minimum of two.
  * New arrays: SYMTAB, FUNCTAB, and PROCINFO["identifiers"]. SYMTAB allows
    indirect access to any defined variable or array; it is possible to
    "walk" the symbol table, if that should be necessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 10 03:58:24 UTC 2011 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.0.0 , important changes
 * The special files /dev/pid, /dev/ppid, /dev/pgrpid and /dev/user are
    now completely gone. Use PROCINFO instead.
 * The POSIX 2008 behavior for `sub' and `gsub' are now the default.
 * In POSIX mode, string comparisons use strcoll/wcscoll.
 * Gawk now treats ranges of the form [d-h] as if they were in the C


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 19 13:46:32 CEST 2011 - dmueller@suse.de

- update to 3.1.8:
  * The zero flag no longer applies to %c and %s; apparently the standards
  changed at some point.
  * Failure to open a socket is no longer a fatal error.
  * dfa.h and dfa.c are now more-or-less in sync with GNU grep, for the first
  time in many years.
  * Gawk no longer includes its own copy of libsigsegv but it will use it if
  installed on the build system. The --disable-libsigsegv configure option
  is now gone.
  * The ' flag (%'d) is now just ignored on systems that can't support it.
  * Gawk now has support for z/OS (IBM S/390 architecture).
  * Gawk now handles multibyte strings better in [s]printf with field
   widths and such.
  * A getline from a directory is no longer fatal; instead it returns -1.
  * Per POSIX, special variable names (like FS) cannot be used as function
   parameter names.
  * The new -O / --optimize option enables simple constant folding on
  the parse tree during parsing.  We hope that with time the number
  of optimizations will increase.
  * Lots of bug fixes, see the ChangeLog.

Mon Nov 12 14:50:34 CET 2007 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to gawk 3.1.6.
  1. `gawk 'program' /non/existant/file' no longer core dumps.
  2. Too many people the world over have complained about gawk's use of the
     locale's decimal point for parsing input data instead of the traditional
     period.  So, even though gawk was being nicely standards-compliant, in
     a Triumph For The Users, gawk now only uses the locale's decimal point
     if --posix is supplied or if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.  It is the sincere
     hope that this change will eliminate this FAQ from being asked.
  3. `gawk -v BINMODE=1 ...' works again.
  4. Internal file names like `/dev/user' now work again. (Note that these
     file names are obsolete and will go away eventually.)
  5. Problems with wide strings in non "C" locales have been straightened
     out everywhere.  (At least, we think so.)
  6. Use of `ansi2knr' is no longer supported. Please use an ANSI C compiler.
  7. Updated to Autoconf 2.61, Automake 1.10, and Gettext 0.16.1.
  8. The getopt* and regex* files were synchronized with current GLIBC CVS.
     See the ChangeLog for the versions and minor edits made.
  9. There are additional --lint-old warnings.
  10. Gawk now uses getaddrinfo(3) to look up names and IP addresses. This
      allows the use of an IPv6 format address and paves the way for
      eventual addition of `/inet6/...' and `/inet4/...' hostnames.
  11. We believe gawk to now be valgrind clean. At least when run against
      the test suite.
  12. A number of issues dealing with the formatting and printing of very
      large numbers in integer formats have been dealt with and fixed.
  13. Gawk now converts "+inf", "-inf", "+nan" and "-nan" into the corresponding
      magic IEEE floating point values. Only those strings (case independent)
      work.  With --posix, gawk calls the system strtod directly. You asked
      for it, you got it, you deal with it.
  14. Defining YYDEBUG enables the -D command line option.
  15. Gawk should now work out of the box on Tandem NSK/OSS systems.
  16. Lint messages rationalized: many more of the messages are now printed
      only once, instead of every time they are encountered.
  17. The strftime() function now accepts an optional third argument, which
      if non-zero or non-null, indicates that the time should be formatted
      as UTC instead of as local time.
  18. The precedence of concatenation and `| getline' (in something like
      "echo " "date" | getline stuff) has been reverted to the earlier
      behavior and now once again matches Unix awk.
  19. New configure time flag --disable-directories-fatal which causes
      gawk to silently skip directories on the command line.  This behavior
      is also enabled for --traditional, since it's what Unix awk does.
  20. A new option, --use-lc-numeric, forces use of the locale's decimal
      point without the rest of the draconian restrictions imposed by
      --posix. This softens somewhat the stance taken in item #2.
  21. Everything relevant has been updated to the GPL 3.
  22. Array growth should be faster now, at no cost in space.
  23. Lots more tests.
  24. One new translation.
  25. Various bugs fixed, see the ChangeLog for details.
