%description
HeLP is a package to compute constraints on partial augmentations of
torsion units in integral group rings using a method developed by
Luthar, Passi and Hertweck. The package can be employed to verify the
Zassenhaus Conjecture and the Prime Graph Question for finite groups,
once characters are known. It uses an interface to the software
package 4ti2 to solve integral linear inequalities.
