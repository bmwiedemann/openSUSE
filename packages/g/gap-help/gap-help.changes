- Update to release 4.0
  * Two new global functions: HeLP_SP and HeLP_KP to study the
    Spectrum Problem and the Kimmerle Problem and their companion
    functions HeLP_AllOrdersSP and HeLP_AllOrdersKP
  * More theoretical results are taken into account when the
    system to solve is generated, namely more partial
    augmentations are assumed to be 0 a priori. This includes
    three results: Berman-Higman (in the general form that the
    coefficient at a central element is 0, if the unit is not
    that element), Hertweck's Proposition 2 from [Hertweck08] (if
    a unit u has smaller order modulo a normal p-subgroup,
    elements with non-zero partial augmentations must have same
    p-power order as u) and Hertweck's p-adic criterion (units
    which map tp 1 modulo a normal p-subgroup are p-adically
    conjugate to elements in G and hence the p-part of any
    element with non-zero partial augmentation is unique up to
    conjugacy in G)
  * Three new minor global functions: HeLP_UnitSatisfiesKP to
    check manually for KP and given partial augmentaion;
    HeLP_IsOneModuloN to see if a unit is mapped to the identity
    modulo a normal subgroup N; HeLP_ForgetUnderlyingGroup to
    obtain same table without group structure. This way the new
    theretical restictions do not apply and one can obtain the
    results as in older versions
