- Sanitize _constraints, 4GByte of memory is sufficient. Also,
  2GByte memoryperjob rejects too many workers, so combine it
  with %limit_build.

Mon Dec 19 19:00:26 UTC 2022 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- Update to version 3.10.5.0
  * Runtime
    + Python block have access to the block logger, as in C++
    + Default log level changed to INFO (from OFF)
    + Memory-based logger gr.dictionary_logger_backend() added for
      log debugging
    + API Note: The Python block gateway is now completely 
      implemented in the PyBind11 wrapper, in order to clean up
      Python dependencies. This is technically an API change, but
      should not have any external effect.
    + PMT serialization of Complex32 vectors is now REAL | IMAG on
      all platforms
    + Python IO signature replication (multiple ports specified by
      one signature) fixed
  * GRC
    + Continue processing block connections after a connection
      error occurs
    + Drawing/scaling fixes that improve user experience on HiDPI
      and Windows machines
  * Build system and packaging
    + Many deprecation warnings fixed
    + Make target link libraries PRIVATE wherever possible, removing
      unnecessary downstream dependencies
  * Testing
    + Code formatting rules for clang format updated to v14
    + Removed all compiler warning suppression
    + Enable Python block testing for Conda on macOS
    + Many other improvements that make maintenance easier - thanks
      again to Clayton Smith. In the process of fixing tests, a number
      of latent bugs were fixed throughout the code.
  * gr-analog
    + AGC3 performance and bug fixes
    + Python has access to control_loop parent class in PLL blocks
    + CTCSS detection of standard tones improved by fixing floating
      point comparison
  * gr-blocks
    + Probe Signal cross platform reliability improved by better
      thread synchronization
  * gr-digital
    + CRC32 and CRC16 blocks use little-endian order regardless of
      host order. This is a wire format change. The options were to
      have different endian machines unable to communicate, or older
      and newer versions unable to communicate. Note that there is
      a more general set of blocks (CRC Append and CRC Check) that
      are recommended for use wherever possible.
    + Packet headers use consistent bit order across machines
    + Floating point/rounding fix in constellation lookup table
  * gr-fec
    + LDPC G matrix n and k can be access from Python
    + LDPC matrix output size calculation corrected
    + CCSDS/Viterbi path metrics overflow fix
  * gr-network
    + Improve UDP Source/Sink efficiency by removing a layer of
      buffering and using the GR circular buffer instead of the
      Boost equivalent
  * gr-qtgui
    + Fixed Python code generation for Msg CheckBox, Digital Number
      Control, Toggle Button, Toggle Switch
  * gr-soapy
    + Sources will generate rx_time, rx_freq and rx_rate tags, as
      in UHD sources, where supported by the underlying Soapy driver
  * gr-uhd
    + Re-enable uhd.find_devices(), in addition to uhd.find()
    + RFNoC: generate correct Python code when using clock/time source
    + RFNoC: allow specification of adapter IDs for streamers
    + RFNoC: enable setting of vlen and types for streamers
    + RFNoC: streamers pay attention to stream args
    + RFNoC: sync block controller with gr-ettus OOT
    + RFNoC:set_property() and get_property() added to the C++ and
      Python APIs
    + RFNoC: Python binds added for rfnoc_block_generic
  * gr-zeromq
    + Sinks will optionally block on full queue, providing
      backpressure. Previously, overflow data was dropped.

    + Do not error out on deprecations, allowing testing of deprecated code
- Update to version 3.9.2.0:
  * SoapySDR support (gr-soapy)
  * GRC
    + Parameter expressions and/or values can be displayed in blocks on
      the flowgraph. Previously, only values were displayed.
    + Deprecated blocks are shown in a distinct color (orange), 
      and the optional deprecated property has been added to block yaml
    + Dark theme works better, especially for parameter fields
    + Vector length is now correctly applied to all input ports
    + Validation has been improved. Raw types are validated. Port
      connections are checked by type rather than by item size.
    + Variable names that cause name conflicts in Python code (e.g.,
      with package names) are rejected
    + Bus logic fixes
    + Blocks can no longer be dragged off the screen and lost forever
  * gnuradio-runtime
    + Remove pmt::pmt_* functions, which were not actually implemented.
      This is technically an API change, but any use of the API would have
      resulted in a link error.
    + Remove Python bindings for internal buffer functions
  * gr-analog
    + Added an example for PLL Frequency Detector
    + Better names for parameters in PLL GRC blocks
  * gr-blocks
    + Consistent naming for Vector Length parameter in GRC blocks
    + count_bits uses VOLK popcnt for better performance (used for example in
      the Correlate Access Code block)
    + Rotator block phase increment parameter is controllable via a message, 
      and a tag can be added at the point where the increment is adjusted
  * gr-digital
    + MPSK example updated to use a Linear Equalizer (replacing deprecated block)
  * gr-filter
    + Filter Delay documentation improvement
    + Interpolating FIR filter can generate C++ code
  * gr-dtv
    + VL-SNR bugs fixed (incorrect constants).
  * gr-qtgui
    + Improve autoscaling for vector sinks
    + Fix floating-point resolution problems in several widgets, due to 
      interpretation of PMT doubles as floats
  * gr-uhd
    + Add policy enum to Python bindings for tune_request
    + Additional time spec options on UHD blocks (PC Clock on Next PPS, GPS Time on Next PPS)
    + Fix up code that was generating warnings
    + Fix command handler logic to apply commands from messages to the correct channel
  * gr_filter_design
    + "File/Save" is disabled until the taps have been computed, and the GUI
      is reset after a save, to make it clearer which data is being saved.
    + Entries are hidden for parameters that do not apply to the selected filter type.
    + Save window type as an integer instead of a Python enum name
  * gr_modtool
    + Improve validation of module and block names
  * Build System and Infrastructure
    + Improved messages related to dependencies MPIR and GMP. Only one of these
      packages is required, and the previous error messages were confusing.
    + Cleaner builds for Windows and Conda. A number of general cmake improvements
      have resulted from this work.
    + In-tree packaging files for DEB and RPM, used with Launchpad and COPR
    + Added man pages for GNU Radio tools
    + Test code generation for all in-tree GRC examples
    + In GrPybind.cmake, PYBIND11_INCLUDE_DIR (incorrect) was changed to pybind11_INCLUDE_DIR
- Update to version 3.9.1.0:
  * Project Scope
    + (internal) Build system improvements and fixes
    + (internal) Use C++14 features instead of Boost where possible
    + Fewer compiler warnings (due to fixed code, not removal of warnings!)
  * OOT Support
    + cmake: standard FindGSL used in lieu of custom one, so OOTs
      should no longer copy this module from the GNU Radio tree if needed
    + modtool: better exception/error handling
    + modtool: will non-interactively add blocks with no parameters
      (--argument-list="")
    + PyBind11 header hash hotfixer
    + (gr-utils/bindtool/scripts/binding-hash-hotfixer.zsh) makes life easier
  * GRC
    + Block param values can be shown as expressions and/or evaluated
      values. Under the View menu, see "Show parameter ..." options.
    + Better handling of gui hints, avoid hiding widgets in cases
      where some have GUI hints and some do not
    + Ensure that strings are valid utf8 when evaluating parameters
    + Save embedded python blocks/modules to hier_block_directory
    + Save config and update recent file sub-menu before executing flowgraph
    + Revert to previous "block id" display behavior
    + Fix drag n' drop issue with Quartz (macOS) backend
    + C++ generated code: remove gnuradio prefix from linked libraries
    + Python generated code: prefix generated modules with flowgraph id
      connect() will be called for hier blocks even if they don't have ports
    + Check for PyYAML 3.11 (was checking for 3.10 even though 3.11 was required)
  * gnuradio-runtime
    + Default buffer size can be adjusted by setting buffer_size in the
      [Default] section of the GNU Radio config file. Otherwise, the
      longstanding default of 32768 is used.
  * gr-blocks
    + Message Debug: prints warning when a non-PDU message is
      received on the Print PDU port
    + File Source handles EOF properly in non-seekable files (e.g., pipes)
    + Several bounds checking and boundary condition improvements
    + Remove DC Spike AutoSync algorithm fixed
  * gr-digital
    + MSK timing error detector improvement
    + Python bindings include control_loop parent class in child
      class Correlation Estimator parameter threshold well documented
  * gr-fft
    + New window types: Nuttall, Blackman Nuttall, Nuttall CFD, Welch, Parzen,
    + Exponential, Riemann, Gaussian and Tukey
  * gr-filter
    + Taps blocks (e.g., Low Pass Filter Taps) now propagate parameter changes
    + Filter Designer: IIR/Band Pass/Bessel works
  * gr-qtgui
    + Add toggling label and icon on plot play/stop button
    + Time Raster Sink: axis labels and ranges are configurable
    + Qt Chooser: label improvements
  * gr-uhd
    + DEPRECATION: UHD blocks currently accept control messages (e.g. for
      frequency change) as PMT pairs and tuples, in addition to the intended
      PMT dict format. In v3.11, only the dict format will be accepted.
    + Command note: freq messages in this version must be dicts.
      Additionally, the direction key must be present and set to TX or RX.
    + set_filter() adds chan parameter
    + Python generated code improved for FE corrections
    + Allow control of frequency and gain in both directions at the same moment
    + Add command handler for mtune ("manual tune")

Tue Dec 17 09:34:53 UTC 2019 - Torsten Ohlenforst <torsten.ohlenforst@pretzel-solutions.com>

- Added missing dependency to package python3-pyaml.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 19 21:13:13 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Use correct QWT dependency, qwt6-devel refers to the Qt4 version on
  Leap 15.0/15.1, qwt6-qt5-devel also works for TW.
- Avoid mangled CMakeLists.txt files in gr_modtool template.
- Update rpmlintrc (changed gr_modtool template directory).
- Move arch dependent examples to _libdir, clean rpmlintrc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 19 16:37:47 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Use pkgconfig(py3cairo) to specify pycairo dependency, package got
  renamed between Leap 15.x and TW, and pkgconfig(py3cairo) fits both.
- Add log4cpp-devel to -devel Requires, always required by gr-runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 18 20:16:50 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Use correct shared library name

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 12 16:49:33 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 3.8.0.0:
  * Changed on Project Scope
    + C++11
    + merged the wholeness of the next branch
    + Dependency version bumps: CMake, GCC, MSVC, Swig, Boost
    + New dependencies: MPIR/GMP, Qt5, gsm, codec2
    + Removed dependencies: libusb, Qt4, CppUnit
    + Python: Python 2 & Python 3 compatible. 3.8 will be the last Py2k-compatible
    + release series
    + gengen was replaced by templates (if you don't know gengen, don't do any
    + research; save yourself that sorrow)
    + Modern CMake (as far as feasible at this point)
    + VOLK version updated to v2.0.0
    + .clang-format file now dictates coding style
    + clang-format'ed the whole tree.
    + installed CMake files now tell about configuration
  * gnuradio-runtime
    + reworked fractional tag time handling, especially in the context of resamplers
  * GRC
    + C++ generation as option
    + YAML instead of XML
    + removed blks2
    + much better canvas tooling
    + consistent gobject usage
    + ROUNDED ARROWS
  * gr-qtgui
    + moving from Qt4 to Qt5
  * gr-utils
    + gr_modtool now vastly improved
  * gr-vocoder
    + improved versatility
    + removed in-tree libgsm, libcodec2, use system-wide libs
  * Removed
    + Project Scope: Modules gr-comedi, gr-fcd and gr-wxgui are gone
    + gr-comedi: nobody could remember who used this, or for what. It has seen 0
      active code contributions in the 3.7 lifecycle
    + gr-digital: python-based packet_encoder and related tools: Bugs that were
      sporadic and never fixed, so after long deprecation, we're removing it
    + gr-fcd: since it's currently untestable by the CI, it's being removed, as
      there was no code contributions. Generally, we strive to include all
      batteries with GNU Radio. Re-integration within a more general SDR interface
      would be desirable.
    + gr-utils: removed PyQwt (dead) based tools
    + gr-wxgui: Unmaintained, breaks on increasingly many systems, always was slower than
      Qtgui. We've been starting to tell people to migrate to Qt since at
      least 2015. Now, we're finally removing it.

    now at least cast the floats to integers, as Boost 1.67 forced
    us to realize we're (incorrectly) using floating point her
  GRC:
  * Fixed GRC bug which broke WX and Qt (by altering the template
    code), in multiple (less than awesome) steps
  gr-blocks:
  * float_array_to_int: int32 limits were wrongly hardcoded.
  * Fixed the undefined behaviour happening in float_to_complex when
    accessing the second input_items element in the single-input case
