%description
This package for GAP 4 introduces a new class of groups which are
accessible to computational methods. In principle, it can deal at
least with the follo- wing types of groups:

* Finite groups.
* Free groups of finite rank.
* Free products of finitely many finite groups, thus in particular
  the modular group PSL(2,Z).
* Direct products of such groups.
* Wreath products of such groups with finite groups and with (Z,+).

Among these groups there are finitely generated groups which are not
finitely presented, and such with unsolvable membership problem.
Further, any finite group embeds into some divisible torsion group
which RCWA can deal with.
