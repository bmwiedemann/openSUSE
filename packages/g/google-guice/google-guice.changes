- Upgrade to upstream version 5.1.0
  * Changes of 4.2:
    + Java 9 and JPMS support
    + Multibindings are now in the Guice core artifact.
      The multibindings artifact is empty to prevent confusion
      during upgrading and will be removed in a later release.
    + Improve the performance of guice provisioning (by about 20%)
      by changing the way errors are reported. Guice will no longer
      report multiple errors during provisioning (Guice still
      reports multiple errors during injector creation).
    + Better error messages for a missing binding.
    + Various optimizations.
    + AbstractModule.configure() is non-abstract to allow modules
      with only @Provides/@ProvidesIntoSet/... methods.
    + Add a CheckedProviders class.
    + Change the way Singletons work to not rely on ThreadLocals nor
      WeakReferences.
    + Add MapBinderBinding.getEntries(Iterable).
    + Deprecate ProvisionListener.ProvisionInvocation
      .getDependencyChain().
    + Ensure that Struts interceptors are populated even if they are
      created after the injector (Fixes #1081, #1075).
    + Add support for multibindings with annotations in the Guice
      DaggerMethodScanner.
  * Changes of 4.2.1
    + Java10 support (updated cglib & asm).
    + Minor updates to the testlib extension.
  * Changes of 4.2.2
    + Java11 support (updated cglib & asm)
  * Changes of 4.2.3
    + Java14 support (updated asm).
    + Added Injector.getElements API, to expose all Element SPI
      types from the Injector.
    + Added Injector.getAllMembersInjectorInjectionPoints API,
      to expose injection points created by arbitrary members
      injection.
    + Added getAlternateKeys to Multibinder SPI types
      (MultibinderBinding, MapBinderBinding, OptionalBinderBinding),
      to explicitly list the other keys these bindings are
      available as.
    + Scan for (and bind) @Provides-like methods in a consistent
      ordering, rather than relying on the non-deterministic
      Class.getDeclaredMembers ordering.
    + Update DaggerAdapter to work with newer dagger code.
    + Fixed a subtle bug with eager singleton evaluation.
    + Updated @RequestScope's scope annotation to the JSR330 @Scope,
      so it can be reused by non-Guice DI systems.
    + Clarified the error message when an injectable constructor is
      missing.
    + Add deprecated overloads to various Modules methods, to make
      it clearer when calling them is unnecessary.
    + Added factory methods to Modules for common Binder
      configuration methods, to make it easier to configure them.
  * Changes of 5.0.1:
    + Added Java15 support (updated asm and bug fixes).
    + Removed cglib as a core dependency. (#1359)
    + Improved error messages.
    + Improved support for using Guice with Kotlin.
    + Added a mechanism to restrict who can bind types or
      annotations, to allow library authors to control their
      bindings.
    + Removed no-aop build variant.
    + Fixed 'illegal reflective access' warnings.
  * Changes of 5.1.0:
    + This minor release adds support for Java 17.

  * google-guice-throwingproviderbinder.patch
  * guice-4.1-disabledextensions.patch
  * guice-4.1-fixup-ant.patch

- Avoid using xmvn-resolve and xmvn-install in order to avoid
  build cycles with new dependencies in dependent packages
- Build only the NO_AOP version of the guice.jar and alias
  accordingly so that it provides both

- Modified patches:
  * google-guice-throwingproviderbinder.patch

  * guice-4.1-javadoc.patch
    + build javadoc with source level 8
