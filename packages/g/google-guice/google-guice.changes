- Upgrade to upstream version 6.0.0
  * JEE Jakarta Transition
    + Guice 6.0 adds support for jakarta.inject, the new namespace
      for the JSR330 spec (after the javax -> jakarta JEE
      transition).
      Guice 6.0 is intended to help users migrate their code to the
      jakarta namespace. It continues to fully support the
      javax.inject namespace while also mostly supporting the
      jakarta.inject namespace. The only part of Guice 6.0 that
      doesn't support jakarta.inject are the bind(..).toProvider
      methods. Those methods still require javax.inject or
      com.google.inject Providers.
    + The Guice 6.0 servlet & persist extensions only support the
      javax.servlet and javax.persistence namespaces respectively.
    + Guice 6.0 can help with incremental migrations to the
      jakarta.inject namespace, by incrementally replacing
      javax.inject references to jakarta.inject. This works
      everywhere, except for code where a jakarta Provider is passed
      to bind(..).toProvider.
  * Guice Core
    + Adds jakarta.inject support.
    + Support Java 21 (via updating ASM to 9.5 and other changes).
    + Improve AOP support on JVMs such as Azul.
    + Fix a deadlock or crash associated with recursively loading
      just-in-time bindings.
    + Make PrivateModule.binder() non-private, to allow subclass
      customization, such as calling skipSources.
    + Fix an endloop loop (that can OOM) in singleton lock cycle
      detection.
    + Fix tests to pass on Windows, despite the different line
      separator.
    + Improvements to OSGi metadata.
    + Mark the JSR305 dependency as optional (since it's not
      required at runtime).
    + Fix Binder.requestInjection(TypeLiteral<T>, T) to use the
      TypeLiteral.
    + Honor scoping annotations on concrete types when provisioned
      by their @ProvidedBy annotation
    + Add a way to tell if a class is "enhanced" by Guice, and
      retrieve the original class.
    + Ensure the order of bind(...) statements does not matter when
      referring to JIT bindings.
    + Implement Matcher.and and Matcher.or as default methods
      directly in Matcher, so that the AbstractMatcher subclass
      isn't required.
    + Mark the error_prone_annotations dependency as optional.
  * Servlet
    + Fix an NPE if contextPath is null
  * Persist
    + Persist had a number of changes, some of which are backwards
      incompatible. Notably: injection of EntityManager no longer
      implicitly starts a unit of work (because this led to leaks).
      Users can opt-in to the legacy behavior by constructing the
      JpaPersistModule with a JpaPersistOptions that sets
      setAutoBeginWorkOnEntityManagerCreation to true.
    + EntityManager provisioning no longer automatically starts a
      unit of work.
    + Ignore multiple start/stop calls, rather than throwing an
      exception.
    + Support manually initiated rollbacks.
    + Don't wrap Object-defined methods (e.g: toString, finalize,
      equals, hashCode) in transactions.

- Upgrade to upstream version 5.1.0
  * Changes of 4.2:
    + Java 9 and JPMS support
    + Multibindings are now in the Guice core artifact.
      The multibindings artifact is empty to prevent confusion
      during upgrading and will be removed in a later release.
    + Improve the performance of guice provisioning (by about 20%)
      by changing the way errors are reported. Guice will no longer
      report multiple errors during provisioning (Guice still
      reports multiple errors during injector creation).
    + Better error messages for a missing binding.
    + Various optimizations.
    + AbstractModule.configure() is non-abstract to allow modules
      with only @Provides/@ProvidesIntoSet/... methods.
    + Add a CheckedProviders class.
    + Change the way Singletons work to not rely on ThreadLocals nor
      WeakReferences.
    + Add MapBinderBinding.getEntries(Iterable).
    + Deprecate ProvisionListener.ProvisionInvocation
      .getDependencyChain().
    + Ensure that Struts interceptors are populated even if they are
      created after the injector (Fixes #1081, #1075).
    + Add support for multibindings with annotations in the Guice
      DaggerMethodScanner.
  * Changes of 4.2.1
    + Java10 support (updated cglib & asm).
    + Minor updates to the testlib extension.
  * Changes of 4.2.2
    + Java11 support (updated cglib & asm)
  * Changes of 4.2.3
    + Java14 support (updated asm).
    + Added Injector.getElements API, to expose all Element SPI
      types from the Injector.
    + Added Injector.getAllMembersInjectorInjectionPoints API,
      to expose injection points created by arbitrary members
      injection.
    + Added getAlternateKeys to Multibinder SPI types
      (MultibinderBinding, MapBinderBinding, OptionalBinderBinding),
      to explicitly list the other keys these bindings are
      available as.
    + Scan for (and bind) @Provides-like methods in a consistent
      ordering, rather than relying on the non-deterministic
      Class.getDeclaredMembers ordering.
    + Update DaggerAdapter to work with newer dagger code.
    + Fixed a subtle bug with eager singleton evaluation.
    + Updated @RequestScope's scope annotation to the JSR330 @Scope,
      so it can be reused by non-Guice DI systems.
    + Clarified the error message when an injectable constructor is
      missing.
    + Add deprecated overloads to various Modules methods, to make
      it clearer when calling them is unnecessary.
    + Added factory methods to Modules for common Binder
      configuration methods, to make it easier to configure them.
  * Changes of 5.0.1:
    + Added Java15 support (updated asm and bug fixes).
    + Removed cglib as a core dependency. (#1359)
    + Improved error messages.
    + Improved support for using Guice with Kotlin.
    + Added a mechanism to restrict who can bind types or
      annotations, to allow library authors to control their
      bindings.
    + Removed no-aop build variant.
    + Fixed 'illegal reflective access' warnings.
  * Changes of 5.1.0:
    + This minor release adds support for Java 17.
