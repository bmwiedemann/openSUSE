README for bi-architecture 64 bit platforms users
=================================================

The GTK_PATH64 environment variable is used instead of GTK_PATH
for the 64 bit library. See the GTK+ documentation for how to use
GTK_PATH.

The GTK+ IM modules are different, based on the architecture of
the package. To update the cache of IM modules, run:

 + for 32 bit version: /usr/bin/gtk-query-immodules-3.0
 + for 64 bit version: /usr/bin/gtk-query-immodules-3.0-64
