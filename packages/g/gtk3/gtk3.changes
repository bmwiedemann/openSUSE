-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 10 00:19:39 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Deprecate %gtk_immodule_(requires|post|postun) macros defined in
  the macros.gtk3 file. Since we are using RPM file triggers to
  provide their functionality, without nullifying them the commands
  will run twice, once by the file triggers and another time by the
  macros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 21 08:43:48 UTC 2023 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Re-add macros.gtk3: there are quite a few consumers left
  requiring the defined macros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  7 00:21:45 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Prepend gtk3 to binary_version and _immoduledir macro names to
  avoid possible name clash now that they are being defined in the
  macros.gtk3 file instead of the spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Revert cursor changes from 3.24.35.
    - Fix handling of surrounding text in input.
  + Updated translation.
- Switch from Autotools to Meson, dropping libtool build
  requirement while adding meson and ninja. And replace configure,
  make_build, and make_install macros with meson, meson_build and
  meson_install.
- Adopt the use of autosetup and autopatch macro facilities to
  improve package maintainability.
- Drop multibuild facility due to the fact that Gtk 3 Meson build
  scripts can't fully disable some components. And, at least for
  now, we cannot achieve the same degree of modularity we had with
  Autotools.
- Drop macros.gtk3 file as no package (if it ever had any) consumes
  its macros.
- After switching to Meson, the build doesn't produce a Wayland
  Input Method module anymore, at least not as a standalone. Update
  baselibs.conf accordingly. And some GResource files are now being
  provided in the devel package for working with emojis.
- Define __provides_exclude_from macro with ^%{_libdir}/gtk-3.0 as
  its value to prevent the automatic provision generator to offer
  private modules as requirable symbols.
- Make cloudproviders to be easily switchable, through bcond
  facility, to allow people to test it, or for maintainers to turn
  it on and off easily.
- Make gettext-its-gtk3 and gtk3-devel-doc sub-packages
  arch-independent (noarch), as they don't contain any binaries.
- Convert IM modules cache update post(un) scriptlets to RPM
  file triggers. Though we had good results with icon cache update
  scriptlets previously, we still can't use transfiletriggers to
  trigger the cache update only once, post transaction, because
  Zypper is still working on implementing support for them.
- Refresh patch with Quilt: gtk3-revert-forced-xftdpi.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  1 10:27:46 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Drop pkgconfig(rest-0.7) BuildRequires: it seems to serve no

  + Adwaita: Some visual updates and fixes.
  + Wayland: DND with icon widgets is working properly.
  + GDK:
    - More of the DND implementation is now handled in GDK:
      creating the drag window, moving the window along with the
      cursor, the drag cancel animation.
    - GdkSeat is a new API that supersedes grabs on individual
      devices and is a better fit for backends like Wayland or Mir.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#708394, bgo#729593, bgo#755947, bgo#756191,
    bgo#758929, bgo#759079, bgo#759081, bgo#759091, bgo#759092,

    - Clipboard and DND fixes.
    - New build dependency: wayland-protocols.

      on X11).
    - Change the handling of drag windows to work on Wayland. The
      drag window implementation has been moved to GDK, with the
      new function gdk_drag_context_get_drag_window.
    - Non-toplevel widgets can be used as drag widgets.

Wed Feb 17 03:19:03 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.19.3:
  + Theming changes:
    - Non-standard CSS properties have been renamed to have a -gtk-
      prefix (the old names still work, with a warning):
      gtk-key-bindings is now -gtk-key-bindings icon-shadow is now
      -gtk-icon-shadow.
    - CSS parsing errors and warnings are shown in the inspector
  + GtkShortcutsWindow:
    - Widgets are more complete, to allow supporting them in glade.
    - GtkShortcutsShortcut can now show gestures as well,
      GtkShortcutsGesture is no longer needed and will be removed
      soon.
    - GtkShortcutsShortcut supports standard gestures, with
      predefined icons and subtitles.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#746745, bgo#758025, bgo#758094, bgo#758187,
    bgo#758367, bgo#758407, bgo#758442.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 3.19.2:
  + Most widgets have been ported to CSS nodes. The element names
    and the tree relationships are documented now. The Adwaita and
    HighContrast themes have been mostly kept up-to-date with these
    changes. Third-party themes and custom CSS will need
    adjustments.
  + The inspector now shows CSS nodes and allows to manipulate
    them.
  + Size allocation has been simplified to avoid excessive resizes
    of the entire window.
  + GtkShortcutsWindow can now display direction-dependent
    shortcuts and sequences of keys.
  + Support for native file chooser on Win32 when using the new
    GtkFileChooserNative API, and when using GtkFileChooserButton.
  + The GtkFileChooser interface prerequisite was changed from
    GtkWidget to GObject to allow non-widget filechooser
    implementations.
  + focus-on-click has been moved from various subclasses to
    GtkWidget, so it is now available for every widget, in
    particular GtkListBoxRow.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#735341, bgo#748904, bgo#756618, bgo#756625,

    gestures has been added.

    variable for X11.

  + GTK+ now loads compose tables in the format used by XLib from
    ~/.config/gtk-3.0/Compose, ~/.XCompose and the X11 locale
    information.
  + GtkBuilder can now create GFile objects, for use in e.g.
    GFileIcons.
  + New APIs:
    - GtkShortcutsWindow
    - gtk_text_tag_changed
    - gtk_settings_reset_property
    - gdk_rectangle_equal
    - gdk_gl_context_is_legacy
  + A new commandline utility, gtk-query-settings, to query GTK+
    settings, has been added.
  + Theming: Element names are now supported. A number of widgets
    have already been changed to use element names for the widget
    itself and its various subelements. This effort will continue
    in next development releases. This change will require
    adjustments in themes and custom css - as part of this
    transition, the element names and style classes in use are
    documented and will be stable going forward.
  + Debugging: GtkInspector can now edit string-array-valued
    properties.
  + Wayland:
    - Fix transparent terminals.
    - Fix treeview search popups.
    - Fix CSD window resizing / moving.

- Update to version 3.15.12:
  + GtkMenuButton: Improve accessible names.

    adjustment.

      well as some other options (debug, forward compatible) when

      examples have been updated, with the exception of gdkgears,
      which will be fixed in the next snapshot.
    - Use shader version 1.50.
  + Mir backend: Many improvements.

    drawing of the trough.

    titlebar when the window is maximized.

    code have been extensively refactored; performance should be
    much improved. But watch out for regressions.

      been implemented.

- Drop gtk3-bnc129753-localize-font-style-name.patch: GTK+ 3 now
  heavily relies on pango to display the font style name, so we

  implies solving the real issue (and therefore removing the need
  for the patch). See bgo#95731 and bgo#123498 for the upstream
  pango bug.

  + The filechooser search has been ported to tracker 0.12 and is
    using the tracker DBus API directly now.

    follow the same pattern we use else where. GtkFontChooser is
    now an interface that is implemented by GtkFontChooserButton,
    GtkFontChooserDialog and GtkFontChooserWidget (to which the
    original GtkFontChooser has been renamed).

  + Updated translations.
- Rename library package accordingly with new library soname.
- Remove update-alternatives mechanism for gtk-builder-convert
  since the tool is not in gtk3 anymore. Also remove python-xml
  Requires of devel package, which was there only for this tool.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  3 16:06:36 CET 2011 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.99.3:
  + This release adds some forgotten padding to class structs,
    and thus breaks ABI for a last time before 3.0
  + Many Introspection annotation improvements
  + We no longer build the gtk-update-icon-cache utility, and
    use a preexisting one, if --enable-gtk2-dependency is passed
    to configure
  + GtkBuilder can now fill GtkComboBoxText and GtkMenuToolButton
    widgets with data, as well as GtkFileFilters and
    GtkTextTagTables
  + GtkImage now has a ::use-fallback property to allow generic
    fallback with GIcons and icon-names (e.g. for symbolic icons)
  + There's a new gtk_text_view_get_cursor_locations() to enable
    popup-at-cursor functionality
  + The application chooser widgets can now set a custom dialog
    heading
  + The file chooser and application chooser widgets have received
    minor visual improvements
  + gtk-auto-mnemonics is now backed by an XSetting
  + Defaults for GtkSettings, as well as theme-specific settings,
    are now read from key files
  + Key themes are now supported again, their syntax has been
    changed to be CSS-like
  + More objects use GtkStyleContext directly
  + GtkPlug and GtkSocket have been reduced to X11-specific API,
    and using them requires including the <gtk/gtkx.h> header, and
    uses of GdkNativeWindow in their APIs have been replaced by the
    X11 Window type.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#351755, bgo#586635, bgo#590459, bgo#598952,

  + GtkBuilder support has been added for setting menus on
    GtkMenuToolButtons and for adding tags to GtkTextTagTable as
    well as adding items to GtkComboBoxText.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  7 16:55:29 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.99.0:
  + Various API deprecations and removals, see NEWS for details.
  + The gtk-update-icon-cache and gtk-builder-convert utilities
    have been renamed back to their un-suffixed names.
    Distributions will have to resolve the conflict between GTK+
    2.x and 3.0 packages by dropping one set of the utilities and
    adding a dependency.
  + It is now possible to include multiple GDK backends in a single
    library. The --with-gdk-backend option has been split into
    separate --enable-{x11,win32,quartz}-backend options.
  + The GDK Quartz backend has been ported to the new GDK backend
    API.
  + A number of widgets have been ported to use GtkStyleContext
    directly.
  + Various problems with width-for-height geometry management have
    been fixed in GtkAlignment, GtkCheckButton, GtkBin.
  + The GtkComboBox, GtkIconView and GtkCellView widgets have been
    ported to use GtkCellArea for their cell layouts.
  + The cups print backend can now send print jobs directly in PDF
    if cups supports it.
  + GtkNumerableIcon is a variant of GEmblemedIcon for using
    numbers as emblems.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#144324, bgo#165987, bgo#307963, bgo#321958,
    bgo#533745, bgo#553404, bgo#559503, bgo#560177, bgo#562182,

    bgo#638231, bgo#638386, bgo#638580, bgo#638608.
  + Updated translations.
- Remove --with-xinput=xfree from configure call: the option
  has been renamed to --enable-xinput, and there's no need to
  specify it in our case, really.
- Use update-alternatives mechanism for gtk-update-icon-cache and
  gtk-builder-convert since both tools are shipped with the same
  names in gtk2 and gtk3:
  + Rename the non-versioned tools and man pages to versioned
    filenames.
  + Add update-alternatives Requires(post/postun) to tools and
    devel subpackages.
  + Call update-alterantives in %post/%postun of the tools and
    devel subpackages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 22 21:14:11 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.91.7:
  + The treeview-refactor branch has been merged, bringing more
    flexible cell arrangement with GtkCellArea, GtkCellAreaBox,
    etc.
  + The gdk-backend branch has been merged. This branch cleans up
    the internal frontend/backend separation in GDK, with the
    ultimate goal of allowing to build a single gdk library that
    contains multiple backends (interesting combinations are
    x11+wayland or quartz+x11).
  + Various API deprecations and removals, see NEWS for details.
  + A number of GTK+ widgets have been ported to use
    GtkStyleContext directly for rendering.
  + The tracker search backend for the file chooser has been
    updated to work with libtracker-sparql as available in
    tracker >= 0.9.
  + The GtkAboutDialog has been given a facelift. It no longer
    opens second-level dialogs.
  + The GDK X11 backend now uses XI2 (including multi-device
    capabilities) by default. Use gdk_disable_multidevice() to
    switch back to the XI1/Core implementation.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#629923, bgo#634657, bgo#635401, bgo#636732,
    bgo#636777, bgo#637018, bgo#637069, bgo#637155, bgo#637156,

- Enable parallel build again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 11 23:58:35 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.91.6:
  + Deprecations, cleanups and API changes:
    - GdkDrawable and some X11-specific APIs have been removed
    - GtkStyle and GtkRcStyle have been deprecated
    - The GdkWindowClass enumeration is now GdkWindowWindowClass
    - gdk_window_get_geometry lost its depth argument
    - The old, unused gtk_decorated_window_... functions have been
      removed.
  + GtkComboBox has gained an 'active id' property that is
    intended for easy binding to settings
  + GtkAppChooser: A new family of widgets that allow choosing
    an application to open a file. This is strongly based on
    the corresponding nautilus dialog, which it is replacing.
  + The GtkStyleContext branch has been merged, changing the APIs
    that are used to do themed drawing, and the theme engine
    interfaces. Among the new classes are GtkStyleContext
    (replacing GtkStyle) and GtkCssProvider (replacing the gtkrc
    parser). The migration guide contains a chapter about porting
    from GtkStyle to GtkStyleContext.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#549720, bgo#582557, bgo#619148, bgo#636060,
    bgo#636129, bgo#636388, bgo#636511
  + Updated translations.
- Note: this update will break GTK+ 3 engines that were not ported
  to the new API.
- Add -DGTK_COMPILATION to CFLAGS to fix a build issue.
- Remove kg translation on 11.3 and earlier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 30 09:48:47 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

    - gtk_init_add has been removed
    - The ::size-request signal has been removed
    - GtkRuler has been removed
  + The default value for the GtkBox::fill property has been

- Drop gtk3-introspection-build-fix.patch: fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 30 09:47:32 CET 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Make gtk3-devel depend on python-xml instead of pyxml: pyxml will
  be removed, and we really wanted to use python-xml anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 17 17:17:36 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.91.4:
  + bgo#609622: disappearing statusicon
  + bgo#631331: window icons don't work anymore
  + bgo#632894: Only show Desktop in file chooser button if there
                is one
  + bgo#633670: Child minimum/natural size is not respected by
                GtkScrolledWindow
  + bgo#633762: Correctly convert colors to CSS and deal with
                librsvg limitations
  + bgo#633915: gtk_button_box_child_requisition() mishandles size
                allocations
  + bgo#634060: Support for GIcon pixbufs
  + bgo#634338: Move GtkPaned documentation to inline comments
  + bgo#634339: Move GtkProgressBar documentation to inline
                comments
  + bgo#634340: Move GtkPageSetup documentation to inline comments
- Changes from version 2.91.3:
  + The scrollable interface has gained some extra properties
    to influence scrolling behaviour: [hv]scroll-policy
  + The size_request vfunc and signal have been deprecated and
    are no longer used inside GTK+ itself
  + GtkAssistant has added a custom page type that gives full
    control of button visibility
  + The homogeneous parameter has been removed from gtk_box_new
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#61852, bgo#576498, bgo#612611, bgo#633050,
    bgo#633216, bgo#633274, bgo#633374, bgo#633500.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop gtk3-fix-tests-build.patch: fixed upstream.
- Add gtk3-introspection-build-fix.patch to fix the introspection
  build, based on changes from git.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 28 16:07:38 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.91.2:
  + GtkApplication has been rewritten. It mostly relies on
    GApplication API now. Remaining functions include
    gtk_application_new() and gtk_window_set_application()
  + A GtkScrollable interface has been added and implemented by all
    scrollable widgets. GtkScrolledWindow has
    ::min-display-width/height properties to control the minimal
    size of the content area.
  + GtkComboBox changes:
    - Popups can be wider than the combo box itself
    - The deprecated GtkComboBoxEntry subclass has been removed
    - The deprecated combo box text convenience API has been
      removed
  + GtkRecentManager changes:
    - Store xbel file in XDG_USER_DATA
    - Add gtk_recent_info_create_app_info()
    - Add gtk_recent_info_get_gicon()
    - Coalesce multiple changes
  + GtkIconView allows tree models (ignoring anything below the
    root level)
  + GtkProgressBar, GtkSpinButton, GtkEntry and GtkCalendar no
    longer have their own input-output window
  + gtk_widget_hide_all() has been removed
  + GtkGrid: A legacy-free, height-for-width grid container
  + GDK gained a GdkRGBA color struct containing 4 doubles, and
    various GdkColor APIs have GdkRGBA counterparts now.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#324899, bgo#438318, bgo#524304, bgo#617174,
    bgo#632381, bgo#632538, bgo#632539, bgo#632677, bgo#632736,
    bgo#632936.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 2.91.1:
  + GTK+ can now add a resize grip to any window. The resize grip
    functionality in GtkStatusbar has been removed.
  + A very old bug in the handling of geometry widgets has been
    fixed, and a way to set geometry in terms of the geometry
    widget has been added: gtk_window_resize_to_geometry()
  + The GtkFileChooser now uses GSettings to store its settings
    instead of the keyfile ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini
  + GtkWrapBox has been dropped from GTK+ again. The widget will be
    available in libegg until clear use cases have been
    established.
  + GtkWidget now has horizontal and vertical expand flags, in the
    form of ::hexpand and ::vexpand properties. These flags are
    intended to obsolete most custom container-specific expand
    child properties, over time. Expandability is inherited up the
    widget hierarchy.
  + GtkComboBoxEntry has been deprecated in favor of a ::has-entry
    property on GtkComboBox.
  + The GtkComboBox text convenience API (gtk_combo_box_new_text(),
    etc) has been deprecated in favor of a new GtkComboBoxText
    class.
  + GtkLinkButton has gained a ::activate-link signal that can be
    used to suppress the default behavior.
  + The very outdated tutorial has been dropped from the GTK+
    distribution, and a new 'Getting started' section has been
    added to the API documentation that will accumulate tutorial
    material over time.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#68668, bgo#313350, bgo#351247, bgo#423201,
    bgo#563002, bgo#612396, bgo#613728, bgo#628902, bgo#629722,

    bgo#632218.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop gtk3-fix-badmatch-gnome-shell.patch: fixed upstream.
- Add gtk3-fix-tests-build.patch to fix the build in the tests.
- Change gtk3-data Recommends to Requires in libgtk-3_0-0 since it
  now contains a GSettings schemas, and GSettings schemas are
  definitely required at runtime.
- Use %glib2_gsettings_schema_* macros for GSettings schemas
  installation.
- Ship README.multipress in gtk3-immodule-multipress.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 15 17:12:37 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Add gtk3-fix-badmatch-gnome-shell.patch to fix a crash in
  gnome-shell.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 13 20:24:01 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Change hicolor-icon-theme Recommends to a Requires in
  libgtk-3-0_0 since we need to make sure it gets installed, and
  libgtk-3-0_0 is low-level enough for this.
- Put comments that are in the scriptlets area of the spec file in
  "%if 0" statement: if we don't do that, they actually end up in
  the scriplets and can even make them fail if the scriptlets were
  just "-p /sbin/ldconfig".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 11 13:44:31 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Split input methods in subpackages:
  + Create gtk3-immodule-amharic, gtk3-immodule-inuktitut,
    gtk3-immodule-multipress, gtk3-immodule-thai,
    gtk3-immodules-tigrigna, gtk3-immodule-vietnamese,
    gtk3-immodule-xim subpackages. For the modules that are useful
    for specific locales, we use a locale(gtk3:$locale) Provides to
    make those packages installed by default when the locale is
    used.
  + Add Recommends to libgtk-3_0-0 for gtk3-immodule-amharic,
    gtk3-immodule-inuktitut, gtk3-immodule-thai,
    gtk3-immodules-tigrigna, gtk3-immodule-vietnamese. This makes
    sense since this helps people discover them without having to
    look for them.
  + gtk3-immodule-multipress is not useful by default.
  + gtk3-immodule-xim is creating performance issues, so we don't
    want it by default.
  + Fix bnc#629995.
- Make the gtk3-data package own the directories of the themes,
  instead of just the files.
- Move the ferret module to the devel package: it's useful for
  tests, but not in general.
- Update the %gtk3_immodule_post and %gtk3_immodule_postun macros
  to use --update-cache instead of redirecting the output to a
  file. That's more solid.
- Remove gtk3-tools Requires(postun) in libgtk-3_0-0: it's not
  needed.
- Do not version the Recommends on the lang package.
- Update baselibs.conf to remove assumption in the scriptlets of
  the generated packages that they are 32bit packages.
- Use <prefix> in baselibs.conf since we use full paths there, and
  this is needed for x86 packages that put files in
  /emul/ia32-linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  5 09:49:22 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.91.0:
  + The rendering cleanup work has landed. This is a large change
    that affects many APIs.
    - All gtkstyle functions have been changed to take a cairo_t
      argument instead of a window + area.
    - GdkPixmap is gone. APIs that took pixmaps are being replaced
      by ones that take pixbufs or cairo surfaces, or regions
      (where pixmaps were used as masks). In background handling,
      pixmaps have been replaced by cairo patterns, see
      gdk_window_set_background_pattern().
    - GdkColormap is gone. It is replaced by visuals, see
      gtk_widget_set_visual().
    - The ::expose-event signal on GtkWidget has been replaced by a
      ::draw signal.
    - gtk_widget_get_snapshot() has been removed. Instead,
      gtk_widget_draw() can render a widget onto an cairo_t.
  + The GtkSizeRequest interface has been merged into GtkWidget,
    and GtkCellSizeRequest has been merged into GtkCellRenderer.
    The wrapper functions have been renamed to include 'preferred',
    e.g gtk_size_request_get_width() is now
    gtk_widget_get_preferred_width() and
    gtk_cell_size_request_get_width_for_height() is now
    gtk_cell_renderer_get_preferred_width_for_height().
  + GtkObject has been removed. The ::destroy signal has been moved
    to GtkWidget. At the same time, GtkWidgetFlags have been
    removed, they already had getters and setters anyway.
  + GtkWidget has gained generic alignment and padding properties:
    halign, valign, margin-left, margin-right, margin-top,
    margin-bottom. These can be used instead of container-specific
    child properties or GtkMisc and GtkAlignment widgets.
  + Container widgets can now let GTK+ handle border-width for
    them, using gtk_container_class_handle_border_width()
  + The GtkEditableClass struct has been renamed to
    GtkEditableInterface
  + Mouse wheel scrolling has been removed from GtkNotebook
  + The default policy for scrolled windows has been changed to
    'automatic'
  + Global url hooks have been removed from GtkAboutDialog and
    GtkLinkButton
  + The global window creation hook has been removed from
    GtkNotebook
  + The error handling in GDK has been modernized and avoids
    synchronizing X requests as much as possible
  + Fixed Bugs: bgo#323904, bgo#339745, bgo#468672, bgo#486839,
    bgo#601731, bgo#617316, bgo#621590, bgo#623664, bgo#628829,

    bgo#630520, bgo#630521, bgo#630532.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop gtk3-no-gtkapplication.patch: we have glib 2.27.0 now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 18 12:35:00 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.90.7:
  + Various deprecated APIs have been removed:
    - the GtkWidget::draw-border style property
    - the GtkEntry::state-hint style property
    - the GtkTreeView::row-ending-details style property
    - the GtkRange::trough-side-details style property

- Add gtk3-no-gtkapplication.patch: GApplication is gone in glib
  2.26, so we can't build GtkApplication. Remove this API for now
  to keep gtk3 building.
- Rebase gtk3-bnc130159-bgo319483-async-font-selection.patch.
- Update the %post scriptlet to not fail if gtk3-tools is not
  installed. Also make it easier to read by using a %define to
  use the right binary for gtk-query-immodules-3.0.

- Patch gtk3-bnc130159-bgo319483-async-font-selection.patch has
  been marked as NEEDS-REBASE. According to bgo#319483, a lot has
  changed in the underlying libraries (fontconfig/pango) and
  re-evaluation of the patch might be required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 25 12:08:36 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Add RPM macros (macros.gtk3) to make it easier to handle
  installation of a GTK+ 3 IM module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 21 21:14:46 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Clean up package.
- Improve summaries and descriptions.
- Remove _with_gobject define, which isn't needed anymore.
- Add README.SUSE for biarch systems.
- Add baselibs.conf.
- Add missing cups-devel BuildRequires, as well as many explicit
  pkgconfig() BuildRequires.
- Rename gtk3 to gtk3-tools, and split some data files to
  gtk3-data.
- Make libgtk-3_0-0 provide gtk3, and add Requires for gtk3-tools
  for the post/postun scriptlets. Also add Recommends for branding,
  data and lang subpackages, as well as gvfs and hicolor-icon-theme
  for improved user experience.
- Add pyxml Requires to devel package, since it's needed by
  gtk-builder-convert.
- Remove hack on gtk-query-immodules-3.0 since there's no need to
  make it parallel installable, and instead add back the change
  from gtk2 needed for biarch, where gtk-query-immodules-3.0-64 is
  used on 64bit systems.
- Move %{_sysconfdir}/gtk-3.0/im-multipress.conf to libgtk-3_0-0
  and gtk-builder-convert-3.0 to devel subpackage.
- Add patches based on the gtk2 package:
  + gtk3-GTK_PATH64.patch: contains the remaining part of
    gtk64.patch, to use the GTK_PATH64 environment variable on
    64bit systems
  + gtk3-path-local.patch: based on gtk-path-local.patch
  + gtk3-bnc129753-localize-font-style-name.patch: based on
    bugzilla-129753-gtk+-2.8.9-localize-font-style-name.diff
  + gtk3-bnc130159-bgo319483-async-font-selection.patch: based on
    gtk2-bnc130159-bgo319483-async-selection-in-gtk-font-selection.diff
- Add gnome-patch-translation support because of
  gtk3-bnc129753-localize-font-style-name.patch.
- Comments on patches not brought from the gtk2 package:
  + bugzilla-131498-allow-xim-for-all-languages.patch: this was a
    patch to make it possible to set input to Japanese characters
    on 32bit applications running on a 64bit system. This is
    needed because somehow, scim-32bit is not installed by default.
    The right fix is to have scim-32bit installed by default, then.
