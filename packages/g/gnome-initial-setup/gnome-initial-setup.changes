Fri Jun 28 21:10:52 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 46.3:
  + The summary page now uses an embedded themed icon for the
    checkmark, which ensures that the icon is loaded at the proper
    scaling level on hidpi displays.
  + If you customize the generated username for the new account,
    changing the account name no longer clobbers the customized
    username.
  + The keyboard page no longer crashes if it is destroyed and
    recreated while still waiting for the set of IBus engines.
  + Updated translations.

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  2 12:26:37 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 46.1:
  + gnome-initial-setup-copy-worker, which runs after Initial Setup
    has created the first user on the system, is now ordered before
    GNOME Keyring, assuming both Initial Setup and GNOME Keyring
    have been configured with systemd support. This avoids a race
    between gnome-initial-setup-copy-worker copying the login
    keyring that was created during Initial Setup, and GNOME
    Keyring creating a login keyring if none exists on disk.
  + Keyboard navigation now works better on the Wi-Fi page.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 09:33:20 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 46.0:
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  6 13:12:29 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 46.rc:
  + Bugs fixed:
    - The text direction is now correctly updated when switching
      between left-to-right and right-to-left locales.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) BuildRequires: no longer needed since
  version 43.beta.
- Add explciit pkgconfig(gtk4) BuildRequires: indirectly pulled in
  via libnma-gtk4, but we want it explicit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 17:09:08 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 46.beta:
  + Avatars are now generated using HdyAvatar.
  + The Welcome page image is now more appropriately sized and not
    cropped.
  + The Welcome page now uses PRETTY_NAME from os-release rather
    than combining the NAME + VERSION_ID fields.
  + The summary page no longer expresses our collective hope that
    users love GNOME, reducing the overall exuberance of the page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 18 17:03:49 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 46.alpha:
  + GNOME Online Accounts integration has been removed.
  + The WebKitGTK dependency is now optional.
  + Bugs fixed:
    - The Initial Setup window can no longer be closed with Alt+F4,
      leaving the user with no way to recover.
    - The avatar picker no longer logs a vast number of criticals,
       which were triggered by a GLib change.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  6 06:43:02 UTC 2023 - Yifan Jiang <yfjiang@suse.com>

- Support build environments like SLE 15 SP5 and Leap 15.5 which

- Update to version 45.0:
  + Mark more strings as translatable.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 10 10:55:44 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 45.beta:
  + Initial Setup now invokes tecla, rather than
    gkbd-keyboard-display, to show keyboard layout previews. This
    is a new runtime dependency.
  + Initial Setup now installs dconf presets to disable some
    irrelevant Shell functionality and always display the
    Accessibility menu in the Initial Setup session.
  + Bugs fixed:
    - Label for a default non-xkb ibus input method remains a
      placeholder
    - Replace applications with apps
    - Third-party repos: don't set the status if the user doesn't
      activate
    - [ARM64][Wayland] gnome-initial-setup crashing
    - Replace gkbd-keyboard-display with Tecla
    - keyboard: Don't leak IBus engine display name
    - driver: Set a non-trivial window title
    - Replace deprecated gtk_widget_show/hide with set_visible
    - Replace deprecated gtk_style_context_add_class with
      gtk_widget_add_css_class
    - ci: Update to new ci-templates snapshot
    - Misc tweaks for ABRT setting on privacy page
    - Improve the README
  + Updated translations.

- Generate %pre from sysusers.d file using sysuser-tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 17 13:10:52 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 44.0:
  + Bug fixes: The privacy policy links on the Privacy page are now
    usable. This was a regression in the GTK 4 port, first released
    as 43.0.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  7 12:07:28 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 44.rc:
  + Enhancements: The About You page now makes it clear that you
    can choose a different avatar.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Double-clicking on the headerbar no longer makes the window
      super small.
    - The keyboard layout list is no longer empty until you search
      or expand it.
    - Non-ASCII characters in location names are now displayed
      correctly on the timezone page. Previously, changing the
      language on the first page would cause them to be mangled.
    - StartupWMClass is now set in the .desktop file, allowing
      GNOME Shell to associate the app window with the desktop
      file.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  7 12:07:27 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 44.beta:
  + Correctly align the 'Preview' links on the keyboard page.
  + Update for removal of WebKitGTK sandbox API in 2.39.5.
  + Update password page to Adwaita style.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  7 12:07:26 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 43.2:
  + The webkitgtk-6.0 API version is now supported, in addition to
    the previous webkit2gtk-5.0 API version.
  + Bugs fixed:
    - The Shell quick settings menu will now be shown in the
      Initial Setup session. This regressed when the previous menu
      was renamed in gnome-shell during the 43 cycle.
    - Error messages shown during enterprise account setup can now
      be closed by clicking the Close button.
  + Updated translations.
- Add boolean pkgconfig(webkitgtk-6.0) BuildRequires following
  upstream changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 19 07:59:10 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 43.1:
  + Several bugs in the enterprise login flow have been fixed.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 16 11:40:35 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 43.0:
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  7 13:58:31 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 43.rc.1:
  + The authentication dialog in the enterprise login page
    regressed in the port to GTK 4; in this release, its buttons
    are accessible once again, and its appearance improved.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  4 10:53:32 UTC 2022 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 43.rc:
  + Initial Setup no longer crashes if using capital letters or
    periods in the username. Now, it always forbids such characters
    to be used (glgo#GNOME/gnome-initial-setup#117,
    glgo#GNOME/gnome-initial-setup!30).
  + Several regressions in the timezone page got fixed
    (glgo#GNOME/gnome-initial-setup#145,
    glgo#GNOME/gnome-initial-setup!157,
    glgo#GNOME/gnome-initial-setup!158).
  + Page-skipping works again (glgo#GNOME/gnome-initial-setup!156).
  + Parental Controls support now correctly requires malcontent
    0.11.0's new API name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 11 13:38:57 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 43.beta:
  + Initial Setup has been ported to GTK 4, libadwaita, and
    friends. As a result:
    - libnma-gtk4 is now required, rather than libnma.
    - GTK 4 is required in addition to GTK 3. This is because
      goa-backend does not have a GTK 4 port. Like in
      gnome-control-center, the use of goa-backend is split out
      into a separate process.
    - webkit2gtk5 is now required. (However, goa-backend brings a
      transitive dependency on webkit2gtk4.)
    - Since webkit2gtk5 requires libsoup 3, the soup2=true
      configuration option has been removed. Initial Setup depends
      on geocode-glib-2.0, and versions of librest and gweather4
      built against libsoup 3.
    - Support for taking a selfie as your account avatar has been
      removed, since libcheese-gtk lacks a GTK 4 port, and the
      optional libcheese[-gtk] dependency is no more.
    - Parental controls support requires malcontent 0.11 which is
      not released at the time of writing.
  + When systemd support is enabled, Initial Setup now installs a
    sysusers.d snippet for its user.
- Adjustments for port to GTK4:
  + Drop pkgconfig(cheese) and pkgconfig(cheese-gtk) BuildRequires.
  + Replaced BuildRequires:
    - pkgconfig(libhandy-1) -> pkgconfig(libadaita-1)
    - pkgconfig(libnma) -> pkgconfig(libnma-gtk4)    
    - pkgconfig(webkit2gtk-4.1) -> pkgconfig(webkit2gtk-5.0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 29 20:43:23 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 43.alpha.1:
  + When built with -Dsoup2=false (the default), Initial Setup now
    depends on geocode-glib-2.0, introduced in geocode-glib 3.26.3
    as a parallel-installable, soup3-flavoured version of the
    library. When built with -Dsoup2=true, Initial Setup continues
    to depend on geocode-glib-1.0.
  + Initial Setup's build system tries to detect when its
    dependencies are built against an incompatible libsoup, but
    there is one known case that is not detected at build time. If
    Initial Setup is built with parental controls enabled, the
    malcontent parental controls library brings with it a
    dependency on libflatpak and libostree. Neither of these
    libraries can currently be built against libsoup3. Either they
    must be built against  libcurl rather than libsoup; or Initial
    Setup must be built with -Dsoup2=true; or Initial Setup must be
    built with -Dparental_controls=disabled; or Initial Setup will
    abort on startup.
- Stop passing soup2=true to meson.
- Replace pkgconfig(geocode-glib-1.0), pkgconfig(rest-0.7) and
  pkgconfig(webkit2gtk-4.0) with pkgconfig(geocode-glib-2.0),
  pkgconfig(rest-1.0) and pkgconfig(webkit2gtk-4.1) BuildRequires
  following upstream changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  7 13:52:20 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 43.alpha:
  + Initial Setup now builds against rest-1.0 if available, falling
    back to rest-0.7 if not. There is no meson option to control
    this.
  + Initial Setup now builds against libsoup 3 by default. As a
    transitional measure, you can opt to build against libsoup 2 by
    passing -Dsoup2=true to meson setup. geocode-glib-1.0,
    gweather4, and rest (1.0 or 0.7) must have been built against
    the same version of libsoup.
  + A number of Meson .wrap files for dependencies such as
    gweather4 have been removed. These dependencies are now widely
    available in stable distros and container images thereof.
  + Initial Setup no longer reads gnome-version.xml to determine
    the GNOME version in the fallback case when no OS information
    is available from /etc/os-release. gnome-version.xml has been
    removed from GNOME 43.
- Pass -D soup2=true to meson: we are not yet ready for the soup3
  switch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 24 11:02:23 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 42.0.1:
  + The dark theme preference support introduced in 42.rc caused a
    regression in Initial Setup's handling of the login keyring.
    The effect was that the new user's login keyring password does
    not match their system password, and so cannot be unlocked.
    This regression is fixed in this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 15:59:40 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 42.0:
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  5 17:01:24 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 42.rc:
  + Initial Setup now supports the GNOME 42 dark theme preference,
    and picks up a dependency on libhandy to enable this. This will
    only have a visible impact if a distribution overrides the
    default value of this preference, since there is no way for a
    user to adjust this preference until Initial Setup is complete.
  + Updated translations.
- Add pkgconfig(libhandy-1) BuildRequires: New dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 10 23:14:58 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 42.beta:
  + Bugs fixed:
    - welcome: tweak illustration
    - Load GisLocationEntry type before page template
  + Updated translations.
- Move autostart .desktop files to distconfdir.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 10 18:47:02 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Enable pkgconfig(gnome-desktop-4) and pkgconfig(gweather4)
  BuildRequires then drop pkgconfig(gnome-desktop-3.0) and
  pkgconfig(gweather-3.0), no longer needed nor used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 10 17:49:02 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 42.alpha.1:
  + Fix gweather4 pkg-config name.
  + Fix project license identifier in Meson build rules.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 10 17:48:02 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 42.alpha:
  + Initial Setup now depends on libgweather-4 and gnome-desktop-4,
    rather than their predecessors. Meson wrap files are provided
    in case these dependencies are not available.
  + The third-party software sources page has been tweaked to more
    accurately describe what the switch does, and to replace the
    switch with a suggested-action toggle button. (This page is
    currently Fedora-specific; patches welcome!)
  + The COPYING file has been clarified to contain only a copy of
    GPL version 2. Previously it also contained a copy of LGPL
    version 2 (not 2.1). There is no change to the actual licensing
    of GNOME Initial Setup: as before, it is distributed under the
    terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.
  + The summary page widget tree has been simplified, with no
    visual change.
  + Some Meson deprecation warnings have been addressed. Meson
    0.53.0 or newer is now required to build Initial Setup.
  + Updated translations.
- Add disabled pkgconfig(gnome-desktop-4) and
  pkgconfig(gweather4) BuildRequires, currently not available on
  openSUSE following upstream changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 10 17:47:02 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 24 11:04:24 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 41.beta:
  + The Software page, which allows the user to enable or disable
    third-party repositories, has been resurrected. It is currently
    Fedora-specific.
  + Bug fixed: Cannot login as administrator if you set up
    enterprise login in gnome-initial-setup.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 15 12:58:36 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

    critical on startup when geoclue is disabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 16 10:25:56 UTC 2021 - Cliff Zhao <qzhao@suse.com>

- Drop gnome-initial-setup-smarter.patch: Because the function has 
  moved to gnome-shell gnome-shell-jsc#SLE-16051-Input-method-recommendation.patch 
  in the latest Epic (jsc#SLE-16051, bsc#1184106);

Fri Apr 30 13:30:49 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 40.1:
  + The welcome page, displayed on systems where the language page
    is skipped, features an illustration of a computer on a desk.
    This illustration has been adjusted to make the hardware more
    generic.
  + Fix a small memory leak in language page.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 20 09:26:24 UTC 2021 - Michael Gorse <mgorse@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 16 10:38:26 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 40.beta:
  + Completing GNOME Initial Setup no longer triggers GNOME Tour.
    GNOME Shell 40 now prompts new and upgrading users to run the
    tour.
  + Previous versions of Initial Setup would run the first time a
    user logs in ("existing user" mode) as well as when the system
    is booted with no users ("new user" mode). Initial Setup no
    longer displays any UI in "existing user" mode, to avoid
    colliding with the tour. The mode has not been removed in code.
  + A simple check has been added to the main() function. If your
    distribution needs the old behaviour, this check can be patched
    out. The hope is that a future version of GNOME will restore
    "existing user" mode, but run Initial Setup from the same
    cut-down Shell that is used in "new user" mode.
  + Initial Setup's .desktop file is now installed to
    @datadir@/applications rather than a GDM-specific directory.
    This means its icon is displayed correctly when run within a
    normal shell session. Some distros have previously worked
    around this issue by installing a symbolic link.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 16 04:40:01 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 40.alpha:
  + Some enhancements to the avatar picker:
    - The "Take a photo…" button now has the suggested-action
      style.
    - Generated avatars now have a darker border.
    - Fix runtime warning when built without libcheese.
  + The "Welcome" page, displayed when the language picker is
    disabled, has a refreshed splash image.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 15 18:25:55 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

  + Fix error when not building with Cheese.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  5 16:06:01 UTC 2020 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.38.1:
  + Fix the window sometimes opens at an unusably small size,
    rather than being sized appropriately for the display. The fix
    causes a regression where the window doesn't react to the
    display size changing in all cases, but the new behaviour is
    better than the old.
  + Other bugs fixed:
    - docs: Remove typo from DEBUGGING.md.
    - Misc use-after-free and critical warning fixes.
    - data: Leave to meson the duty of keeping the lists in sync.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 11 12:31:39 UTC 2020 - dimstar@opensuse.org

Sun Sep  6 15:54:31 UTC 2020 - Michael Gorse <mgorse@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.37.92: 
  + Bugs fixed: Exit gracefully if we are disabled systemwide by
    Anacontda.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes in version 3.37.91.1:
  + Bugs fixed:
    - !92 gnome-initial-setup: Allow welcome tour to be skipped via vendor config.
    - !95 network: Re-word the description for Wi-Fi.
    - !100: Avoid a warning about connecting to a NULL object.
- Changes in version 3.37.91:
  + Revamp the ‘welcome screen.
+ Changes in version 3.37.90:
  + Use `gnome-tour` instead of `yelp` to start the welcome tour.
  + Switch to a new user session management approach of defining
    the session services in
    `gnome-session@gnome-initial-setup.target.d/session.conf` in
    the systemd user unit directory. This bumps the optional
    systemd dependency to ≥ 242.
- Changes in version 3.37.3:
  + The avatars offered in the 'account' page can now be customized
    by setting the 'org.gnome.desktop.interface avatar-directories'
    GSetting, which also controls the avatars offered in Settings.
  + Since version 3.30, it has been possible to customize certain
    aspects of Initial Setup by specifing the 'vendor-conf-file'
    option at build time, then installing a configuration file to
    that path. This version adds two paths that will be checked by
    default: one for distribution configuration, and another to
    override that configuration on specific deployments.
  + Bugs fixed:
    - timezone: Don't set timezone if tz page is skipped.
    - Polkit rules seem to list now unneeded privileges.
    - Add error argument to save_data() vfunc.
    - account: Use facesdirs setting to override faces.
    - Enable web process sandbox.
- Add >= 242 to systemd BuildRequires.
- Add >= 2.26.0 to webkit2gtk BuildRequires.
- Add gsettings-desktop-schemas to BuildRequires: new dependency.
