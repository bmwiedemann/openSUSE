%description
Wedderga is the package to compute the simple components of the
Wedderburn decomposition of semisimple group algebras of finite
groups over finite fields and over subfields of finite cyclotomic
extensions of the rational. It also contains functions that produce
the primitive central idempotents of semisimple group algebras. Other
functions of Wedderga allows to construct crossed products over a
group with coefficients in an associative ring with identity and the
multiplication determined by a given action and twisting.
