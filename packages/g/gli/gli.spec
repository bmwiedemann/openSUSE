%description
OpenGL Image (GLI) is a header only C++ image library for graphics software.

GLI provides classes and functions to load image files (KTX and DDS),
facilitate graphics APIs texture creation, compare textures, access texture
texels, sample textures, convert textures, generate mipmaps, etc.

This library works with OpenGL or Vulkan but also ensures
interoperability with other third-party libraries and SDKs. It is a
candidate for software rendering (raytracing / rasterisation), image
processing, image-based software testing or any development context that
requires an image library.
