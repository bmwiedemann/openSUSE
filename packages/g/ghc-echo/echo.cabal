synopsis:            A cross-platform, cross-console way to handle echoing terminal input
description:         The @base@ library exposes the @hGetEcho@ and @hSetEcho@ functions
                     for querying and setting echo status, but unfortunately, neither
                     function works with MinTTY consoles on Windows. This is a serious
                     issue, since @hGetEcho@ and @hSetEcho@ are often used to disable
                     input echoing when a program prompts for a password, so many
                     programs will reveal your password as you type it on MinTTY!
                     .
                     This library provides an alternative interface which works
                     with both MinTTY and other consoles. An example is included
                     which demonstrates how one might prompt for a password using
                     this library. To build it, make sure to configure with the
                     @-fexample@ flag.
