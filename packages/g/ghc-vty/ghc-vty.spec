%description
Vty is terminal GUI library in the niche of ncurses. It is intended to be easy
to use and to provide good support for common terminal types.

See the 'vty-examples' package as well as the program
'examples/interactive_terminal_test.hs' included in the 'vty' repository for
examples on how to use the library.

Import the 'Graphics.Vty' convenience module to get access to the core parts of
the library.
