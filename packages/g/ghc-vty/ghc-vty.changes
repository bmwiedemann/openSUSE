- Update vty to version 5.31.
  5.31
  ----

  New features and API changes:
   * Added support for strikethrough mode. This change adds a new
     `strikethrough` `Style` value and uses the `smxx` and `rmxx`
     Terminfo capabilities to activate and deactivate strikethrough mode,
     respectively. If the terminfo does not report those capabilities,
     this style is ignored.
   * `Output`: added the `setDisplayBounds` field to set the output
     dimensions of the output handle; added an implementation of this for
     the `TerminfoBased` backend.

  Other changes:
   * The C prototype for `vty_c_get_window_size` in `gwinsz.h` was fixed.

- Update vty to version 5.30.
  5.30
  ----

  New features:
   * Added `Graphics.Vty.setWindowTitle` to emit an escape
     sequence to set the window title, provide the terminal emulator
     accepts Xterm-style title sequences. For details, see:
     https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Xterm-Title-3.html

- Update vty to version 5.29.
  5.29
  ----

  API changes:
   * The Input type got a new field, 'restoreInputState'. This field
     allows the end user to have direct access to the logic needed to
     restore the terminal's input state flags. Prior to having this field,
     this state restoration logic could only be invoked as part of calling
     'shutdownInput', but since that function does other things (like
     killing threads) it is not advisable to call it repeatedly (which is
     necessary in the use case this change is intended to support). This
     can be called directly to restore the input state flags as needed,
     although this is not required if 'shutdown' (or 'shutdownInput') is
     called.

  Other changes:
   * attributeControl: explicitly enable the ICRNL terminal mode flag (see
     #187 and c572ad).
