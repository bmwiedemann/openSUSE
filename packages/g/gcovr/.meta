  <title>A code coverage report generator using GNU gcov</title>
  <description>Gcovr provides a utility for managing the use of the GNU gcov utility
and generating summarized code coverage results.

This command is inspired by the Python coverage.py package, which provides
a similar utility in Python. The gcovr command produces either compact
human-readable summary reports, machine readable XML reports
(in Cobertura format) or simple HTML reports. Thus, gcovr can be viewed
as a command-line alternative to the lcov utility, which runs gcov and
generates an HTML-formatted report.
