%description
The Haskell XML Toolbox bases on the ideas of HaXml and HXML, but introduces a
more general approach for processing XML with Haskell. The Haskell XML Toolbox
uses a generic data model for representing XML documents, including the DTD
subset and the document subset, in Haskell. It contains a validating XML
parser, a HTML parser, namespace support, an XPath expression evaluator, an
XSLT library, a RelaxNG schema validator and funtions for serialization and
deserialization of user defined data. The library makes extensive use of the
arrow approach for processing XML. Since version 9 the toolbox is partitioned
into various (sub-)packages. This package contains the core functionality,
hxt-curl, hxt-tagsoup, hxt-relaxng, hxt-xpath, hxt-xslt, hxt-regex-xmlschema
contain the extensions. hxt-unicode contains encoding and decoding functions,
hxt-charproperties char properties for unicode and XML. Changes from 9.3.1.21:
