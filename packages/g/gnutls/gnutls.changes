-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  9 12:53:27 UTC 2022 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.7.8:
  * libgnutls: In FIPS140 mode, RSA signature verification is an
    approved operation if the key has modulus with known sizes
    (1024, 1280, 1536, and 1792 bits), in addition to any modulus
    sizes larger than 2048 bits, according to SP800-131A rev2.
  * libgnutls: gnutls_session_channel_binding performs additional
    checks when GNUTLS_CB_TLS_EXPORTER is requested. According to
    RFC9622 4.2, the "tls-exporter" channel binding is only usable
    when the handshake is bound to a unique master secret (i.e.,
    either TLS 1.3 or extended master secret extension is
    negotiated). Otherwise the function now returns error.
  * libgnutls: usage of the following functions, which are designed
    to loosen restrictions imposed by allowlisting mode of
    configuration, has been additionally restricted. Invoking
    them is now only allowed if system-wide TLS priority string
    has not been initialized yet:
      - gnutls_digest_set_secure
      - gnutls_sign_set_secure
      - gnutls_sign_set_secure_for_certs
      - gnutls_protocol_set_enabled
  * Delete gnutls-3.6.6-set_guile_site_dir.patch and use the
    --with-guile-extension-dir configure option to properly
    handle the guile extension directory.
  * Rebase gnutls-Make-XTS-key-check-failure-not-fatal.patch
  * Update gnutls.keyring
  * Add a build depencency on gtk-doc required by autoreconf

Fri Jul 29 14:29:17 UTC 2022 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.7.7: [bsc#1202020, CVE-2022-2509]
  * libgnutls: Fixed double free during verification of pkcs7
    signatures. CVE-2022-2509
  * libgnutls: gnutls_hkdf_expand now only accepts LENGTH argument
    less than or equal to 255 times hash digest size, to comply with
    RFC 5869 2.3.
  * libgnutls: Length limit for TLS PSK usernames has been increased
    from 128 to 65535 characters
  * libgnutls: AES-GCM encryption function now limits plaintext
    length to 2^39-256 bits, according to SP800-38D 5.2.1.1.
  * libgnutls: New block cipher functions have been added to
    transparently handle padding. gnutls_cipher_encrypt3 and
    gnutls_cipher_decrypt3 can be used in combination of
    GNUTLS_CIPHER_PADDING_PKCS7 flag to automatically add/remove
    padding if the length of the original plaintext is not a multiple
    of the block size.
  * libgnutls: New function for manual FIPS self-testing.
  * API and ABI modifications:
    - gnutls_fips140_run_self_tests: New function
    - gnutls_cipher_encrypt3: New function
    - gnutls_cipher_decrypt3: New function
    - gnutls_cipher_padding_flags_t: New enum
  * guile: Guile 1.8 is no longer supported
  * guile: Session record port treats premature termination as EOF Previously,
    a 'gnutls-error' exception with the 'error/premature-termination' value
    would be thrown while reading from a session record port when the
    underlying session was terminated prematurely. This was inconvenient
    since users of the port may not be prepared to handle such an exception.
    Reading from the session record port now returns the end-of-file object
    instead of throwing an exception, just like it would for a proper
    session termination.
  * guile: Session record ports can have a 'close' procedure. The
    'session-record-port' procedure now takes an optional second parameter,
    and a new 'set-session-record-port-close!' procedure is provided to
    specify a 'close' procedure for a session record port. This 'close'
    procedure lets users specify cleanup operations for when the port is
    closed, such as closing the file descriptor or port that backs the
    underlying session.
  * Rebase patches:
    - gnutls-3.6.6-set_guile_site_dir.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 16:56:26 UTC 2022 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 3.7.6:
  * libgnutls: Fixed invalid write when gnutls_realloc_zero() is
    called with new_size < old_size. This bug caused heap
    corruption when gnutls_realloc_zero() has been set as gmp
    reallocfunc.
  * Remove gnutls-3.7.5-fix-gnutls_realloc_zero.patch: Fixed
    upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 21 17:50:57 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 3.7.5:
  * add options disable session ticket usage in TLS 1.2 because
    it does not provide forward secrecy
  * For TLS 1.3 where session tickets do provide forward secrecy,
    the PFS priority string now only disables session tickets in
    TLS 1.2.
  * Future backward incompatibility: in the next major release of
     GnuTLS those flag and modifier are planned to be removed
  * gnutls-cli, gnutls-serv: Channel binding for printing
    information has been changed from tls-unique to tls-exporter
    as tls-unique is not supported in TLS 1.3.
  * Certificate sanity checks has been enhanced to make gnutls
    more RFC 5280 compliant:
  * Removed 3DES from FIPS approved algorithms
  * Optimized support for AES-SIV-CMAC algorithms
  * libgnutls: HKDF and AES-GCM algorithms are now approved in
    FIPS-140 mode when used in TLS

    parameters should be also used in the KAT.
  * Add gnutls-FIPS-PBKDF2-KAT-requirements.patch
- Enable to run the regression tests also in FIPS mode.

Fri Mar 18 08:59:49 UTC 2022 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.7.4:
  * libgnutls: Added support for certificate compression as defined
    in RFC8879.
  * certtool: Added option --compress-cert that allows user to
    specify compression  methods for certificate compression.
  * libgnutls: GnuTLS can now be compiled with --enable-strict-x509
    configure option to enforce stricter certificate sanity checks
    that are compliant with RFC5280.
  * libgnutls: Removed IA5String type from DirectoryString within
    issuer and subject name to make DirectoryString RFC5280 compliant.
  * libgnutls: Added function to retrieve the name of current
    ciphersuite from session.
  * Bump libgnutlsxx soname due to ABI break

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 18 15:59:11 UTC 2022 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.7.3: [bsc#1190698, bsc#1190796]
  * libgnutls: The allowlisting configuration mode has been added
    to the system-wide settings. In this mode, all the algorithms
    are initially marked as insecure or disabled, while the
    applications can re-enable them either through the [overrides]
    section of the configuration file or the new API (#1172).
  * The build infrastructure no longer depends on GNU AutoGen for
    generating command-line option handling, template file parsing
    in certtool, and documentation generation (#773, #774). This
    change also removes run-time or bundled dependency on the
    libopts library, and requires Python 3.6 or later to regenerate
    the distribution tarball. Note that this brings in known backward
    incompatibility in command-line tools, such as long options are
    now case sensitive, while previously they were treated in a case
    insensitive manner: for example --RSA is no longer a valid option
    of certtool. The existing scripts using GnuTLS tools may need
    adjustment for this change.
  * libgnutls: The tpm2-tss-engine compatible private blobs can be loaded
    and used as a gnutls_privkey_t (#594). The code was originally written
    for the OpenConnect VPN project by David Woodhouse. To generate such
    blobs, use the tpm2tss-genkey tool from tpm2-tss-engine:
    https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss-engine/#rsa-operations
    or the tpm2_encodeobject tool from unreleased tpm2-tools.
  * libgnutls: The library now transparently enables Linux KTLS (kernel
    TLS) when the feature is compiled in with --enable-ktls configuration
    option (#1113). If the KTLS initialization fails it automatically falls
    back to the user space implementation.
  * certtool: The certtool command can now read the Certificate Transparency
    (RFC 6962) SCT extension (#232).  New API functions are also provided to
    access and manipulate the extension values.
  * certtool: The certtool command can now generate, manipulate, and evaluate
    x25519 and x448 public keys, private keys, and certificates.
  * libgnutls: Disabling a hashing algorithm through "insecure-hash"
    configuration directive now also disables TLS ciphersuites that use it
    as a PRF algorithm.
  * libgnutls: PKCS#12 files are now created with modern algorithms by default
    (!1499). Previously certtool used PKCS12-3DES-SHA1 for key derivation and
    HMAC-SHA1 as an integity measure in PKCS#12.  Now it uses AES-128-CBC with
    PBKDF2 and SHA-256 for both key derivation and MAC algorithms, and the
    default PBKDF2 iteration count has been increased to 600000.
  * libgnutls: PKCS#12 keys derived using GOST algorithm now uses
    HMAC_GOSTR3411_2012_512 instead of HMAC_GOSTR3411_2012_256 for integrity,
    to conform with the latest TC-26 requirements (#1225).
  * libgnutls: The library now provides a means to report the status
    of approved cryptographic operations (!1465). To adhere to the
    FIPS140-3 IG 2.4.C., this complements the existing mechanism to
    prohibit the use of unapproved algorithms by making the library
    unusable state.
  * gnutls-cli: The gnutls-cli command now provides a --list-config
    option to print the library configuration (!1508).
  * libgnutls: Fixed possible race condition in
    gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2 when a single trust list object
    is shared among multiple threads (#1277). [GNUTLS-SA-2022-01-17,
    CVSS: low]
  * API and ABI modifications:
    GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_FLAG_RSA_PSS_FIXED_SALT_LENGTH: new flag in
      gnutls_privkey_flags_t
    GNUTLS_VERIFY_RSA_PSS_FIXED_SALT_LENGTH: new flag in
      gnutls_certificate_verify_flags
    gnutls_ecc_curve_set_enabled: Added.
    gnutls_sign_set_secure: Added.
    gnutls_sign_set_secure_for_certs: Added.
    gnutls_digest_set_secure: Added.
    gnutls_protocol_set_enabled: Added.

  * certtool:
    * When signing a CSR, CRL distribution point (CDP) is no
      longer copied from the signing CA by default
    * When producing certificates and certificate requests, subject
      DN components that are provided individually will now be
      ordered by assumed scale

  * Fixed potential use-after-free in sending "key_share" and
    "pre_shared_key" extensions.
  * Fixed a regression in handling duplicated certs in a chain.
  * Fixed sending of session ID in TLS 1.3 middlebox compatibility
    mode. In that mode the client shall always send a non-zero
    session ID to make the handshake resemble the TLS 1.2
    resumption; this was not true in the previous versions.
  * Removed dependency on the external 'fipscheck' package,
    when compiled with --enable-fips140-mode.
  * Added padlock acceleration for AES-192-CBC.

 * libgnutls: Fixed "no_renegotiation" alert handling at incorrect timing.
   [GNUTLS-SA-2020-09-04, CVSS: medium]
 * libgnutls: If FIPS self-tests are failed, gnutls_fips140_mode_enabled() now
   indicates that with a false return value (!1306).
 * libgnutls: Under FIPS mode, the generated ECDH/DH public keys are checked
   accordingly to SP800-56A rev 3 (!1295, !1299).
 * libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_export2() now returns 0 upon success, rather than
   the size of the internal base64 blob (#1025).
 * libgnutls: Certificate verification failue due to OCSP must-stapling is not
   honered is now correctly marked with the GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID flag
 * libgnutls: The audit log message for weak hashes is no longer printed twice
 * libgnutls: Fixed version negotiation when TLS 1.3 is enabled and TLS 1.2 is
   disabled in the priority string. Previously, even when TLS 1.2 is explicitly
   disabled with "-VERS-TLS1.2", the server still offered TLS 1.2 if TLS 1.3 is
   enabled (#1054).

- Update to 3.6.14
  * libgnutls: Fixed insecure session ticket key construction, since 3.6.4.
    The TLS server would not bind the session ticket encryption key with a
    value supplied by the application until the initial key rotation, allowing
    attacker to bypass authentication in TLS 1.3 and recover previous
    conversations in TLS 1.2 (#1011). (bsc#1172506, CVE-2020-13777)
    [GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03, CVSS: high]
  * libgnutls: Fixed handling of certificate chain with cross-signed
    intermediate CA certificates (#1008). (bsc#1172461)
  * libgnutls: Fixed reception of empty session ticket under TLS 1.2 (#997).
  * libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_print() is enhanced to recognizes commonName
    (2.5.4.3), decodes certificate policy OIDs (!1245), and prints Authority
    Key Identifier (AKI) properly (#989, #991).
  * certtool: PKCS #7 attributes are now printed with symbolic names (!1246).
  * libgnutls: Use accelerated AES-XTS implementation if possible (!1244).
    Also both accelerated and non-accelerated implementations check key block
    according to FIPS-140-2 IG A.9 (!1233).
  * libgnutls: Added support for AES-SIV ciphers (#463).
  * libgnutls: Added support for 192-bit AES-GCM cipher (!1267).
  * libgnutls: No longer use internal symbols exported from Nettle (!1235)
  * API and ABI modifications:
    GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_128_SIV: Added

- Update to 3.6.13
  * libgnutls: Fix a DTLS-protocol regression (caused by TLS1.3
support)
    The DTLS client would not contribute any randomness to the DTLS negotiation,
    breaking the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol (#960)
    [GNUTLS-SA-2020-03-31, CVSS: high] (bsc#1168345)
  * libgnutls: Added new APIs to access KDF algorithms (#813).
  * libgnutls: Added new callback gnutls_keylog_func that enables a custom
    logging functionality.
  * libgnutls: Added support for non-null terminated usernames in PSK
    negotiation (#586).
  * gnutls-cli-debug: Improved support for old servers that only support
    SSL 3.0.

Tue Feb  4 09:49:44 UTC 2020 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- gnutls 3.6.12
 * libgnutls: Introduced TLS session flag (gnutls_session_get_flags())
   to identify sessions that client request OCSP status request (#829).
 * libgnutls: Added support for X448 key exchange (RFC 7748) and Ed448
   signature algorithm (RFC 8032) under TLS (#86).
 * libgnutls: Added the default-priority-string option to system configuration;
   it allows overriding the compiled-in default-priority-string.
 * libgnutls: Added support for GOST CNT_IMIT ciphersuite (as defined by
   draft-smyshlyaev-tls12-gost-suites-07).
   By default this ciphersuite is disabled. It can be enabled by adding
   +GOST to priority string. In the future this priority string may enable
   other GOST ciphersuites as well.  Note, that server will fail to negotiate
   GOST ciphersuites if TLS 1.3 is enabled both on a server and a client. It
   is recommended for now to disable TLS 1.3 in setups where GOST ciphersuites
   are enabled on GnuTLS-based servers.
 * libgnutls: added priority shortcuts for different GOST categories like
   CIPHER-GOST-ALL, MAC-GOST-ALL, KX-GOST-ALL, SIGN-GOST-ALL, GROUP-GOST-ALL.
 * libgnutls: Reject certificates with invalid time fields. That is we reject
   certificates with invalid characters in Time fields, or invalid time formatting
   To continue accepting the invalid form compile with --disable-strict-der-time
 * libgnutls: Reject certificates which contain duplicate extensions. We were
   previously printing warnings when printing such a certificate, but that is
   not always sufficient to flag such certificates as invalid. Instead we now
   refuse to import them (#887).
 * libgnutls: If a CA is found in the trusted list, check in addition to
   time validity, whether the algorithms comply to the expected level prior
   to accepting it. This addresses the problem of accepting CAs which would
   have been marked as insecure otherwise (#877).
 * libgnutls: The min-verification-profile from system configuration applies
   for all certificate verifications, not only under TLS. The configuration can
   be overriden using the GNUTLS_SYSTEM_PRIORITY_FILE environment variable.
 * libgnutls: The stapled OCSP certificate verification adheres to the convention
   used throughout the library of setting the 'GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID' flag.
 * libgnutls: On client side only send OCSP staples if they have been requested
   by the server, and on server side always advertise that we support OCSP stapling
 * libgnutls: Introduced the gnutls_ocsp_req_const_t which is compatible
   with gnutls_ocsp_req_t but const.
 * certtool: Added the --verify-profile option to set a certificate
   verification profile. Use '--verify-profile low' for certificate verification
   to apply the 'NORMAL' verification profile.
 * certtool: The add_extension template option is considered even when generating
   a certificate from a certificate request.

Tue Dec  3 19:34:20 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- gnutls 3.6.11.1:
  * libgnutls: Corrected issue with TLS 1.2 session ticket
    handling as client during resumption
  * libgnutls: gnutls_base64_decode2() succeeds decoding the empty
    string to the empty string. This is a behavioral change of the
    API but it conforms to the RFC4648 expectations
  * libgnutls: Fixed AES-CFB8 implementation, when input is shorter
    than the block size. Fix backported from nettle.
  * certtool: CRL distribution points will be set in CA
    certificates even when non self-signed
  * gnutls-cli/serv: added raw public-key handling capabilities
    (RFC7250). Key material can be set via the --rawpkkeyfile and
    --rawpkfile flags.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 10 17:48:44 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- gnutls 3.6.10:
  * Add support for deterministic ECDSA/DSA (RFC6979)
  * Add functions for in-place encryption/decryption of data buffers
  * server now selects the highest TLS protocol version, if TLS 1.3
    is enabled and the client advertises an older protocol version
    first
  * Add support for GOST 28147-89 cipher in CNT (GOST counter) mode
    and MAC generation based on GOST 28147-89 (IMIT)
  * certtool: when outputting an encrypted private key do not
    insert the textual description of it

  * add support for copying digest or MAC contexts
  * Mark the crypto implementation override APIs as deprecated
  * Add support for AES-GMAC, as a separate to GCM, MAC algorithm
  * Add support for Generalname registeredID
  * The priority configuration was enhanced to allow more elaborate
    system-wide configuration of the library
- includes changes from 3.6.8:
  * Add support for AES-XTS cipher
  * Fix calculation of Streebog digests
  * During Diffie-Hellman operations in TLS, verify that the peer's
    public key is on the right subgroup (y^q=1 mod p), when q is
    available (under TLS 1.3 and under earlier versions when RFC7919
    parameters are used).
  * Apply STD3 ASCII rules in gnutls_idna_map() to prevent
    hostname/domain crafting via IDNA conversion
  * certtool: allow the digital signature key usage flag in CA
    certificates
  * gnutls-cli/serv: add the --keymatexport and --keymatexportsize
    options. These allow testing the RFC5705 using these tools
- drop patches to re-enable tests:
  * disable-psk-file-test.patch

Thu Apr  4 13:34:03 UTC 2019 - Jason Sikes <jsikes@suse.de>

- Update gnutls to 3.6.7
  ** libgnutls, gnutls tools: Every gnutls_free() will automatically set
     the free'd pointer to NULL. This prevents possible use-after-free and
     double free issues. Use-after-free will be turned into NULL dereference.
     The counter-measure does not extend to applications using gnutls_free().

  ** libgnutls: Fixed a memory corruption (double free) vulnerability in the
     certificate verification API. Reported by Tavis Ormandy; addressed with
     the change above. [GNUTLS-SA-2019-03-27, #694] [bsc#1130681] (CVE-2019-3829)

  ** libgnutls: Fixed an invalid pointer access via malformed TLS1.3 async messages;
     Found using tlsfuzzer. [GNUTLS-SA-2019-03-27, #704] [bsc#1130682] (CVE-2019-3836)

  ** libgnutls: enforce key usage limitations on certificates more actively.
     Previously we would enforce it for TLS1.2 protocol, now we enforce it
     even when TLS1.3 is negotiated, or on client certificates as well. When
     an inappropriate for TLS1.3 certificate is seen on the credentials structure
     GnuTLS will disable TLS1.3 support for that session (#690).

  ** libgnutls: the default number of tickets sent under TLS 1.3 was increased to
     two. This makes it easier for clients which perform multiple connections
     to the server to use the tickets sent by a default server.

  ** libgnutls: enforce the equality of the two signature parameters fields in
     a certificate. We were already enforcing the signature algorithm, but there
     was a bug in parameter checking code.

  ** libgnutls: fixed issue preventing sending and receiving from different
     threads when false start was enabled (#713).

  ** libgnutls: the flag GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN_SO now implies a writable
     session, as non-writeable security officer sessions are undefined in PKCS#11
     (#721).

  ** libgnutls: no longer send downgrade sentinel in TLS 1.3.
     Previously the sentinel value was embedded to early in version
     negotiation and was sent even on TLS 1.3. It is now sent only when
     TLS 1.2 or earlier is negotiated (#689).

  ** gnutls-cli: Added option --logfile to redirect informational messages output.

- Disabled dane support in SLE since dane is not shipped there

- Changed configure script to hardware guile site directory since command-line
  option '--with-guile-site-dir=' was removed from the configure script.

  ** Added gnutls-3.6.6-set_guile_site_dir.patch

- Modified gnutls-3.6.0-disable-flaky-dtls_resume-test.patch to fix
  compilation issues on PPC

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  4 12:41:43 UTC 2019 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- Update to 3.6.6
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_pubkey_import_ecc_raw() was fixed to set the number bits
       on the public key (#640).
  ** libgnutls: Added support for raw public-key authentication as defined in RFC7250.
     Raw public-keys can be negotiated by enabling the corresponding certificate
     types via the priority strings. The raw public-key mechanism must be explicitly
     enabled via the GNUTLS_ENABLE_RAWPK init flag (#26, #280).
  ** libgnutls: When on server or client side we are sending no extensions we do
     not set an empty extensions field but we rather remove that field competely.
     This solves a regression since 3.5.x and improves compatibility of the server
     side with certain clients.
  ** libgnutls: We no longer mark RSA keys in PKCS#11 tokens as RSA-PSS capable if
       the CKA_SIGN is not set (#667).
  ** libgnutls: The priority string option %NO_EXTENSIONS was improved to completely
     disable extensions at all cases, while providing a functional session. This
     also implies that when specified, TLS1.3 is disabled.
  ** libgnutls: GNUTLS_X509_NO_WELL_DEFINED_EXPIRATION was marked as deprecated.
     The previous definition was non-functional (#609).
- drop no longer needed gnutls-enbale-guile-2.2.patch
- refresh disable-psk-file-test.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  2 13:36:26 UTC 2019 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- Update to 3.6.5
  ** libgnutls: Provide the option of transparent re-handshake/reauthentication
     when the GNUTLS_AUTO_REAUTH flag is specified in gnutls_init() (#571).
  ** libgnutls: Added support for TLS 1.3 zero round-trip (0-RTT) mode (#127)
  ** libgnutls: The priority functions will ignore and not enable TLS1.3 if
     requested with legacy TLS versions enabled but not TLS1.2. That is because
     if such a priority string is used in the client side (e.g., TLS1.3+TLS1.0 enabled)
     servers which do not support TLS1.3 will negotiate TLS1.2 which will be
     rejected by the client as disabled (#621).
  ** libgnutls: Change RSA decryption to use a new side-channel silent function.
     This addresses a security issue where memory access patterns as well as timing
     on the underlying Nettle rsa-decrypt function could lead to new Bleichenbacher
     attacks. Side-channel resistant code is slower due to the need to mask
     access and timings. When used in TLS the new functions cause RSA based
     handshakes to be between 13% and 28% slower on average (Numbers are indicative,
     the tests where performed on a relatively modern Intel CPU, results vary
     depending on the CPU and architecture used). This change makes nettle 3.4.1
     the minimum requirement of gnutls (#630). [CVSS: medium]
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_priority_init() and friends, allow the CTYPE-OPENPGP keyword
     in the priority string. It is only accepted as legacy option and is ignored.
  ** libgnutls: Added support for EdDSA under PKCS#11 (#417)
  ** libgnutls: Added support for AES-CFB8 cipher (#357)
  ** libgnutls: Added support for AES-CMAC MAC (#351)
  ** libgnutls: In two previous versions GNUTLS_CIPHER_GOST28147_CPB/CPC/CPD_CFB ciphers
       have incorrectly used CryptoPro-A S-BOX instead of proper (CryptoPro-B/-C/-D
     S-BOXes). They are fixed now.
  ** libgnutls: Added support for GOST key unmasking and unwrapped GOST private
     keys parsing, as specified in R 50.1.112-2016.
  ** gnutls-serv: It applies the default settings when no --priority option is given,
     using gnutls_set_default_priority().
  ** p11tool: Fix initialization of security officer's PIN with the --initialize-so-pin
     option (#561)
  ** certtool: Add parameter --no-text that prevents certtool from outputting
     text before PEM-encoded private key, public key, certificate, CRL or CSR.

Mon Oct 15 08:26:48 UTC 2018 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Version update to 3.6.4 (bsc#1111757):
  ** libgnutls: Added the final (RFC8446) version numbering of the TLS1.3 protocol.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected regression since 3.6.3 in the callbacks set with
     gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function() which could not handle the case where
     no certificates were returned, or the callbacks were set to NULL (see #528).
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_handshake() on server returns early on handshake when no
     certificate is presented by client and the gnutls_init() flag GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_START
     is specified.
  ** libgnutls: Added session ticket key rotation on server side with TOTP.
     The key set with gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server() is used as a
     master key to generate time-based keys for tickets. The rotation
     relates to the gnutls_db_set_cache_expiration() period.
  ** libgnutls: The 'record size limit' extension is added and preferred to the
     'max record size' extension when possible.
  ** libgnutls: Provide a more flexible PKCS#11 search of trust store certificates.
     This addresses the problem where the CA certificate doesn't have a subject key
     identifier whereas the end certificates have an authority key identifier (#569)
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_privkey_export_gost_raw2(), gnutls_privkey_import_gost_raw(),
     gnutls_pubkey_export_gost_raw2(), gnutls_pubkey_import_gost_raw() import
     and export GOST parameters in the "native" little endian format used for these
     curves. This is an intentional incompatible change with 3.6.3.
  ** libgnutls: Added support for seperately negotiating client and server certificate types
     as defined in RFC7250. This mechanism must be explicitly enabled via the
     GNUTLS_ENABLE_CERT_TYPE_NEG flag in gnutls_init().

  Fixes security issues:
  CVE-2018-10846, CVE-2018-10845, CVE-2018-10844, CVE-2017-10790
  (bsc#1105437, bsc#1105460, bsc#1105459, bsc#1047002)
  Other Changes:
  ** libgnutls: Introduced support for draft-ietf-tls-tls13-28
  ** libgnutls: Apply compatibility settings for existing applications running with TLS1.2 or
     earlier and TLS 1.3.
  ** Added support for Russian Public Key Infrastructure according to RFCs 4491/4357/7836.
  ** Provide a uniform cipher list across supported TLS protocols
  ** The SSL 3.0 protocol is disabled on compile-time by default.
  ** libgnutls: Introduced function to switch the current FIPS140-2 operational
     mode
  ** libgnutls: Introduced low-level function to assist applications attempting client
     hello extension parsing, prior to GnuTLS' parsing of the message.
  ** libgnutls: When exporting an X.509 certificate avoid re-encoding if there are no
     modifications to the certificate.
  ** libgnutls: on group exchange honor the %SERVER_PRECEDENCE and select the groups
     which are preferred by the server.
  ** Improved counter-measures for TLS CBC record padding.
     ** Introduced the %FORCE_ETM priority string option. This option prevents the negotiation
     of legacy CBC ciphersuites unless encrypt-then-mac is negotiated.
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_privkey_import_ext4() was enhanced with the
     GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_INFO_PK_ALGO_BITS flag.
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_pkcs11_copy_secret_key, gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_privkey2,
     gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_generate3 will mark objects as sensitive by default
     unless GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_NOT_SENSITIVE is specified. This is an API
     change for these functions which make them err towards safety.
  ** libgnutls: improved aarch64 cpu features detection by using getauxval().
  ** certtool: It is now possible to specify certificate and serial CRL numbers greater
     than 2**63-2 as a hex-encoded string both when prompted and in a template file.
     Default certificate serial numbers are now fully random.

- GnuTLS 3.6.2:
  * libgnutls: When verifying against a self signed certificate ignore issuer.
    That is, ignore issuer when checking the issuer's parameters strength,
    resolving issue #347 which caused self signed certificates to be
    additionally marked as of insufficient security level.
  * libgnutls: Corrected MTU calculation for the CBC ciphersuites. The data
    MTU calculation now, it correctly accounts for the fixed overhead due to
    padding (as 1 byte), while at the same time considers the rest of the
    padding as part of data MTU.
  * libgnutls: Address issue of loading of all PKCS#11 modules on startup
    on systems with a PKCS#11 trust store (as opposed to a file trust store).
    Introduced a multi-stage initialization which loads the trust modules, and
    other modules are deferred for the first pure PKCS#11 request.
  * libgnutls: The SRP authentication will reject any parameters outside
    RFC5054. This protects any client from potential MitM due to insecure
    parameters. That also brings SRP in par with the RFC7919 changes to
    Diffie-Hellman.
  * libgnutls: Added the 8192-bit parameters of SRP to the accepted parameters
    for SRP authentication.
  * libgnutls: Addressed issue in the accelerated code affecting
    interoperability with versions of nettle >= 3.4.
  * libgnutls: Addressed issue in the AES-GCM acceleration under aarch64.
  * libgnutls: Addressed issue in the AES-CBC acceleration under ssse3 (patch by
    Vitezslav Cizek).
  * srptool: the --create-conf option no longer includes 1024-bit parameters.
  * p11tool: Fixed the deletion of objects in batch mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  1 15:13:55 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuTLS 3.6.1:
  * Fix interoperability issue with openssl when safe renegotiation
    was used
  * gnutls_x509_crl_sign, gnutls_x509_crt_sign,
    gnutls_x509_crq_sign, were modified to sign with a better
    algorithm than SHA1. They will now sign with an algorithm that
    corresponds to the security level of the signer's key.
  * gnutls_x509_*_sign2() functions and gnutls_x509_*_privkey_sign()
    accept GNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN (0) as a hash function option. That
    will signal the function to auto-detect an appropriate hash
    algorithm to use.
  * Remove support for signature algorithms using SHA2-224 in TLS.
    TLS 1.3 no longer uses SHA2-224 and it was never a widespread
    algorithm in TLS 1.2
  * Refuse to use client certificates containing disallowed
    algorithms for a session, reverting a change on 3.5.5
  * Refuse to resume a session which had a different SNI advertised
    That improves RFC6066 support in server side.
  * p11tool: Mark all generated objects as sensitive by default.
  * p11tool: added options --sign-params and --hash. This allows
    testing signature with multiple algorithms, including RSA-PSS.

- Disable flaky dtls_resume test on Power
  * add gnutls-3.6.0-disable-flaky-dtls_resume-test.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 18 11:47:23 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuTLS 3.6.0:
  * Introduce a lock-free random generator which operates per-
    thread and eliminates random-generator related bottlenecks in
    multi-threaded operation.
  * Replace the Salsa20 random generator with one based on CHACHA.
    The goal is to reduce code needed in cache (CHACHA is also
    used for TLS), and the number of primitives used by the
    library. That does not affect the AES-DRBG random generator
    used in FIPS140-2 mode.
  * Add support for RSA-PSS key type as well as signatures in
    certificates, and TLS key exchange
  * Add support for Ed25519 signing in certificates and TLS key
     exchange following draft-ietf-tls-rfc4492bis-17
  * Enable X25519 key exchange by default, following
    draft-ietf-tls-rfc4492bis-17.
  * Add support for Diffie-Hellman group negotiation following
    RFC7919.
  * Introduce various sanity checks on certificate import
  * Introduce gnutls_x509_crt_set_flags(). This function can set
    flags in the crt structure. The only flag supported at the
    moment is GNUTLS_X509_CRT_FLAG_IGNORE_SANITY which skips the
    certificate sanity checks on import.
  * PKIX certificates with unknown critical extensions are rejected
    on verification with status GNUTLS_CERT_UNKNOWN_CRIT_EXTENSIONS
  * Refuse to generate a certificate with an illegal version, or an
    illegal serial number. That is, gnutls_x509_crt_set_version()
    and gnutls_x509_crt_set_serial(), will fail on input considered
    to be invalid in RFC5280.
  * Call to gnutls_record_send() and gnutls_record_recv() prior to
    handshake being complete are now refused
  * Add support for PKCS#12 files with no salt (zero length) in
    their password encoding, and PKCS#12 files using SHA384 and
    SHA512 as MAC.
  * libgnutls: Exported functions to encode and decode DSA and ECDSA
    r,s values.
  * Add new callback setting function to gnutls_privkey_t for
    external keys. The new function (gnutls_privkey_import_ext4),
    allows signing in addition to previous algorithms (RSA PKCS#1
    1.5, DSA, ECDSA), with RSA-PSS and Ed25519 keys.
  * Introduce the %VERIFY_ALLOW_BROKEN and
    %VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_WITH_SHA1 priority string options. These
    allows enabling all broken and SHA1-based signature algorithms
    in certificate verification, respectively.
  * 3DES-CBC is no longer included in the default priorities list.
    It has to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with a string like
    "NORMAL:+3DES-CBC".
  * SHA1 was marked as insecure for signing certificates.
    Verification of certificates signed with SHA1 is now considered
    insecure and will fail, unless flags intended to enable broken
    algorithms are set. Other uses of SHA1 are still allowed.
  * RIPEMD160 was marked as insecure for certificate signatures.
    Verification of certificates signed with RIPEMD160 hash
    algorithm is now considered insecure and will fail, unless
    flags intended to enable broken algorithms are set.
  * No longer enable SECP192R1 and SECP224R1 by default on TLS
    handshakes. These curves were rarely used for that purpose,
    provide no advantage over x25519 and were deprecated by TLS 1.3.
  * Remove support for DEFLATE, or any other compression method.
  * OpenPGP authentication was removed; the resulting library is ABI
    compatible, with the openpgp related functions being stubs that
    fail on invocation.
    Drop gnutls-broken-openpgp-tests.patch, no longer required.
  * Remove support for libidn (i.e., IDNA2003); gnutls can now be
    compiled only with libidn2 which provides IDNA2008.
  * certtool: The option '--load-ca-certificate' can now accept
    PKCS#11 URLs in addition to files.
  * certtool: The option '--load-crl' can now be used when
    generating PKCS#12 files (i.e., in conjunction with '--to-p12' option).
  * certtool: Keys with provable RSA and DSA parameters are now
    only read and exported from PKCS#8 form, following 
    draft-mavrogiannopoulos-pkcs8-validated-parameters-00.txt.
    This removes support for the previous a non-standard key format.
  * certtool: Added support for generating, printing and handling
    RSA-PSS and Ed25519 keys and certificates.
  * certtool: the parameters --rsa, --dsa and --ecdsa to
    --generate-privkey are now deprecated, replaced by the
    --key-type option.
  * p11tool: The --generate-rsa, --generate-ecc and --generate-dsa
    options were replaced by the --generate-privkey option.
  * psktool: Generate 256-bit keys by default.
  * gnutls-server: Increase request buffer size to 16kb, and added
    the --alpn and --alpn-fatal options, allowing testing of ALPN
    negotiation.
  * Enables FIPS 140-2 mode during build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  8 22:51:06 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuTLS 3.5.13:
  * libgnutls: fixed issue with AES-GCM in-place encryption and
    decryption in aarch64
  * libgnutls: no longer parse the ResponseID field of the status
    response TLS extension. The field is not used by GnuTLS nor is
    made available to calling applications. That addresses a null
    pointer dereference on server side caused by packets containing
    the ResponseID field. GNUTLS-SA-2017-4, bsc#1043398
  * libgnutls: tolerate certificates which do not have strict DER
    time encoding. It is possible using 3rd party tools to generate
    certificates with time fields that do not conform to DER
    requirements. Since 3.4.x these certificates were rejected and
    cannot be used with GnuTLS, however that caused problems with
    existing private certificate infrastructures, which were
    relying on such certificates. Tolerate reading and using these
    certificates.
  * minitasn1: updated to libtasn1 4.11.
  * certtool: allow multiple certificates to be used in --p7-sign
    with the --load-certificate option

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  4 19:52:56 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuTLS 3.5.12:
  * libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2() no longer matches
    IP addresses against DNS fields of certificate (CN or DNSname).
    The previous behavior was to tolerate some misconfigured
    servers, but that was non-standard and skipped any IP
    constraints present in higher level certificates.
  * libgnutls: when converting to IDNA2008, fallback to IDNA2003
    (i.e., transitional encoding) if the domain cannot be converted.
    That provides maximum compatibility with browsers like firefox
    that perform the same conversion.
  * libgnutls: fix issue in RSA-PSK client callback which resulted
    in no username being sent to the peer
  * libgnutls: fix regression causing stapled extensions in trust
    modules not to be considered.
  * certtool: introduced the email_protection_key option.  This
    option was introduced in documentation for certtool without an
    implementation of it. It is a shortcut for option
   'key_purpose_oid = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4'.
  * certtool: made printing of key ID and key PIN consistent
    between certificates, public keys, and private keys. That is
    the private key printing now uses the same format as the rest.
  * gnutls-cli: introduced the --sni-hostname option. This allows
    overriding the hostname advertised to the peer.

- GnuTLS 3.5.11:
  * gnutls.pc: do not include libtool options into Libs.private.
  * libgnutls: Fixed issue when rehandshaking without a client certificate in
    a session which initially used one
  * libgnutls: Addressed read of 4 bytes past the end of buffer in OpenPGP
    certificate parsing (bsc#1038337)
  * libgnutls: Introduced locks in gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t structure access.
    That allows PKCS#11 operations such as signing to be performed with the
    same object from multiple threads.
  * libgnutls: when disabling OpenPGP authentication, the resulting library
    is ABI compatible (will openpgp related functions being stubs that fail
    on invocation).

  * gnutls.pc: do not include libidn2 in Requires.private
  * libgnutls: optimized access to subject alternative names (SANs) in parsed
    certificates
  * libgnutls: Print the key PIN value used by the HPKP protocol as per RFC7469
    when printing certificate information.
  * libgnutls: gnutls_ocsp_resp_verify_direct() and gnutls_ocsp_resp_verify()
    flags can be set from the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumeration.
    This allows the functions to pass the same flags available for certificates
    to the verification function (e.g., GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS or
    GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_BROKEN).
  * libgnutls: gnutls_store_commitment() can accept flag
    GNUTLS_SCOMMIT_FLAG_ALLOW_BROKEN. This is to allow the function to operate
    in applications which use SHA1 for example, after SHA1 is deprecated.
  * certtool: No longer ignore the 'add_critical_extension' template option if
    the 'add_extension' option is not present.
  * gnutls-cli: Added LMTP, POP3, NNTP, Sieve and PostgreSQL support to the
    starttls-proto command- drop gnutls-3.5.9-pkgconfig.patch (upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  9 10:07:19 UTC 2017 - meissner@suse.com

- Version 3.5.8 (released 2016-01-09)
  * libgnutls: Ensure that multiple calls to the gnutls_set_priority_*
    functions will not leave the verification profiles field to an
    undefined state. The last call will take precedence.
  * libgnutls: Ensure that GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAIL will be returned
    by PKCS#8 decryption functions when an invalid key is provided. This
    addresses regression on decrypting certain PKCS#8 keys.
  * libgnutls: Introduced option to override the default priority string
    used by the library. The intention is to allow support of system-wide
    priority strings (as set with --with-system-priority-file). The
    configure option is --with-default-priority-string.
  * libgnutls: Require a valid IV size on all ciphers for PKCS#8 decryption.
    This prevents crashes when decrypting malformed PKCS#8 keys.
  * libgnutls: Fix crash on the loading of malformed private keys with certain
    parameters set to zero.
  * libgnutls: Fix double free in certificate information printing. If the PKIX
    extension proxy was set with a policy language set but no policy specified,
    that could lead to a double free.
  * libgnutls: Addressed memory leaks in client and server side error paths
    (issues found using oss-fuzz project)
  * libgnutls: Addressed memory leaks in X.509 certificate printing error paths
    (issues found using oss-fuzz project)
  * libgnutls: Addressed memory leaks and an infinite loop in OpenPGP certificate
    parsing. Fixes by Alex Gaynor. (issues found using oss-fuzz project)
  * libgnutls: Addressed invalid memory accesses in OpenPGP certificate parsing.

Sun Dec 18 16:28:51 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuTLS 3.5.7, the next stable branch, with the following
  highlights:
  * SHA3 as a certificate signature algorithm
  * X25519 (formerly curve25519) for ephemeral EC diffie-hellman
    key exchange
  * TLS false start
  * New APIs to access the Shawe-Taylor-based provable RSA and DSA
    parameter generation
  * Prevent the change of identity on rehandshakes by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 18 12:56:15 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- GnuTLS 3.4.17:
  * libgnutls: Introduced time and constraints checks in the end
    certificate in the gnutls_x509_crt_verify_data2() and 
    gnutls_pkcs7_verify_direct() functions.
  * libgnutls: Set limits on the maximum number of alerts handled.
    That is, applications using gnutls could be tricked into an
    busy loop if the peer sends continuously alert messages.
    Applications  which set a maximum handshake time (via
    gnutls_handshake_set_timeout) will eventually recover but
    others may remain in a busy loops indefinitely. This is related
    but not identical to CVE-2016-8610, due to the difference in
    alert handling of the libraries (gnutls delegates that handling
    to applications). boo#1005879
  * libgnutls: Enhanced the PKCS#7 parser to allow decoding old
    (pre-rfc5652) structures with arbitrary encapsulated content.
  * libgnutls: Backported cipher priorities order from 3.5.x branch
    That adds CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuite to SECURE priority
    strings.
  * certtool: When exporting a CRQ in DER format ensure no text data
    are intermixed.
  * API and ABI modifications:
    gnutls_pkcs7_get_embedded_data_oid: Added
- includes changes from 3.4.16:
  * libgnutls: Ensure proper cleanups on
    gnutls_certificate_set_*key() failures due to key mismatch.
    This prevents leaks or double freeing on such failures.
  * libgnutls: Increased the maximum size of the handshake message
    hash. This will allow the library to cope better with larger
    packets, as the ones offered by current TLS 1.3 drafts.
  * libgnutls: Allow to use client certificates despite them
    containing disallowed algorithms for a session. That allows for
    example a client to use DSA-SHA1 due to his old DSA
    certificate, without requiring him to enable DSA-SHA1 (and thus
    make it acceptable for the server's certificate).
  * guile: Backported all improvements from 3.5.x branch.
  * guile: Update code to the I/O port API of Guile >= 2.1.4
    This makes sure the GnuTLS bindings will work with the
    forthcoming 2.2 stable series of Guile, of which 2.1 is a
    preview.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  2 16:13:59 UTC 2016 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- GnuTLS 3.4.15:
  * libgnutls: Corrected the comparison of the serial size in OCSP 
    response. Previously the OCSP certificate check wouldn't verify 
    the serial length and could succeed in cases it shouldn't 
    (GNUTLS-SA-2016-3).
  * libgnutls: Fixes in gnutls_x509_crt_list_import2, which was
    ignoring flags if all certificates in the list fit within the
    initially allocated memory.
  * libgnutls: Corrected issue which made 
    gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crt() to return invalid pointers 
    when returned more than a single certificate.
  * libgnutls: Fix gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse to always extract the
    complete chain.
  * libgnutls: Added support for decrypting PKCS#8 files which use 
    the HMAC-SHA256 as PRF.
  * libgnutls: Addressed issue with PKCS#11 signature generation on 
    ECDSA keys. The signature is now written as unsigned integers 
    into the DSASignatureValue structure. Previously signed 
    integers could be written depending on what the underlying 
    module would produce. Addresses #122.

- Version 3.4.13 (released 2016-06-06)
  * libgnutls: Consider the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment to be compatible with
    NSS instead of using a separate variable; in addition append any keys to
    the file instead of overwriting it.
  * libgnutls: use secure_getenv() where available to obtain environment
    variables. Addresses GNUTLS-SA-2016-1.
- Version 3.4.12 (released 2016-05-20)
  * libgnutls: The CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuite is enabled by default. This
    cipher is prioritized after AES-GCM.
  * libgnutls: Fixes in gnutls_privkey_import_ecc_raw().
  * libgnutls: Fixed gnutls_pkcs11_get_raw_issuer() usage with the
    GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT flag. Previously that
    operation could fail on certain PKCS#11 modules.
  * libgnutls: gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url() and gnutls_x509_crt_import_url()
    can accept the GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT flag.
  * libgnutls: gnutls_certificate_set_key() was enhanced to import the DNS
    name of the certificates if the provided names are NULL.
  * libgnutls: when receiving SNI names, only save and expose to application
    the supported DNS names.
  * libgnutls: when importing the certificate names at the
    gnutls_certificate_set* functions, only consider the CN as a fallback
    if DNS names are provided via the alternative name extension.
  * gnutls-cli: on OCSP verification do not fail if we have a single valid
    reply. Report and reproducer by Thomas Klute.
  * libgnutls: The GNUTLS_KEYLOGFILE environment variable can be used to
    log session keys in client side. These session keys are compatible with
    the NSS Key Log Format and can be used to decrypt the session for
    debugging using wireshark.

- Updated to 3.4.11
  * Version 3.4.11 (released 2016-04-11)
  ** libgnutls: Fixes in gnutls_record_get/set_state() with DTLS. 
     Reported by Fridolin Pokorny.
  ** libgnutls: Fixes in DSA key generation under PKCS #11. Report and
     patches by Jan Vcelak.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected behavior of ALPN extension parsing during
     session resumption. Report and patches by Yuriy M. Kaminskiy.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected regression (since 3.4.0) in 
     gnutls_server_name_set() which caused it not to accept non-null-
     terminated hostnames. Reported by Tim Ruehsen.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected printing of the IP Adress name constraints.
  ** ocsptool: use HTTP/1.0 for requests. This avoids issue with servers
     serving chunk encoding which ocsptool doesn't support. Reported by
     Thomas Klute.
  ** certtool: do not require a CA for OCSP signing tag. This follows the
     recommendations in RFC6960 in 4.2.2.2 which allow a CA to delegate
     OCSP signing to another certificate without requiring it to be a CA.
     Reported by Thomas Klute.

  * Version 3.4.10 (released 2016-03-03)
  ** libgnutls: Eliminated issues preventing buffers more than 2^32 bytes
     to be used with hashing functions.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected leaks and other issues in
     gnutls_x509_crt_list_import().
  ** libgnutls: Fixes in DSA key handling for PKCS #11. Report and 
     patches by Jan Vcelak.
  ** libgnutls: Several fixes to prevent relying on undefined behavior
     of C (found with libubsan).

  * Version 3.4.9 (released 2016-02-03)
  ** libgnutls: Corrected ALPN protocol negotiation. Before GnuTLS would
     negotiate the last commonly supported protocol, rather than the 
     first. Reported by Remi Denis-Courmont (#63).
  ** libgnutls: Tolerate empty DN fields in informational output 
     functions.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected regression causes by incorrect fix in
     gnutls_x509_ext_export_key_usage() at 3.4.8 release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 18 13:25:54 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 3.4.8
  All changes since 3.4.4:
  * libgnutls: Corrected memory leak in gnutls_pubkey_import_privkey()
    when used with PKCS #11 keys.
  * libgnutls: For DSA and ECDSA keys in PKCS #11 objects, import
    their public keys from either a public key object or a certificate.
    That is, because private keys do not contain all the required
    parameters for a direct import.
  * libgnutls: Fixed issue when writing ECDSA private keys in PKCS #11
    tokens.
  * libgnutls: Fixed out-of-bounds read in 
    gnutls_x509_ext_export_key_usage()
  * libgnutls: The CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuites were updated to 
    conform to draft-ietf-tls-chacha20-poly1305-02.
  * libgnutls: Several fixes in PKCS #7 signing which improve 
    compatibility with the MacOSX tools.
  * libgnutls: The max-record extension not negotiated on DTLS. This
    resolves issue with the max-record being negotiated but ignored.
  * certtool: Added the --p7-include-cert and --p7-show-data options.
  * libgnutls: Properly require TLS 1.2 in all CBC-SHA256 and CBC-SHA384
    ciphersuites. This solves an interoperability issue with openssl.
  * libgnutls: Corrected the setting of salt size in 
    gnutls_pkcs12_mac_info().
  * libgnutls: On a rehandshake allow switching from anonymous to ECDHE 
    and DHE ciphersuites.
  * libgnutls: Corrected regression from 3.3.x which prevented 
    ARCFOUR128 from using arbitrary key sizes.
  * libgnutls: Added GNUTLS_SKIP_GLOBAL_INIT macro to allow programs
    skipping the implicit global initialization.
  * gnutls.pc: Don't include libtool specific options to link flags.
  * tools: Better support for FTP AUTH TLS negotiation
  * libgnutls: Added new simple verification functions. That avoids the
    need to install a callback to perform certificate verification. See
    doc/examples/ex-client-x509.c for usage.
  * libgnutls: Introduced the security parameter 'future' which is at
    the 256-bit level of security, and 'ultra' was aligned to its 
    documented size at 192-bits.
  * libgnutls: When writing a certificate into a PKCS #11 token, ensure
    that CKA_SERIAL_NUMBER and CKA_ISSUER are written.
  * libgnutls: Allow the presence of legacy ciphers and key exchanges in
    priority strings and consider them a no-op.
  * libgnutls: Handle the extended master secret as a mandatory 
    extension. That fixes incompatibility issues with Chromium (#45). 
  * libgnutls: Added the ability to copy a public key into a PKCS #11
    token.
  * tools: Added support for LDAP and XMPP negotiation for STARTTLS.
  * p11tool: Allow writing a public key into a PKCS #11 token.
  * certtool: Key generation security level was switched to HIGH. That
    is, by default the tool generates 3072 bit keys for RSA and DSA.
  * libgnutls: When re-importing CRLs to a trust list ensure that there
    no duplicate entries.
  * certtool: Removed any arbitrary limits imposed on input file sizes
    and maximum number of certificates imported.
  * certtool: Allow specifying fixed dates on CRL generation.
  * gnutls-cli-debug: Added check for inappropriate fallback support
    (RFC7507).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 18 22:40:28 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- Update to 3.4.4
  This update contains a fix for a denial of service vulnerability:
  * Allow the parsing of very long DNs. Also fixes double free
    in DN decoding [GNUTLS-SA-2015-3]. boo#941794 CVE-2015-6251
  Other changes:
  * Add high level API (gnutls_prf_rfc5705) to access the PRF as
    specified by RFC5705.
  * Link to trousers (TPM library) dynamically when this
    functionality is requested. (disabled in SUSE package)
  * Fix issue with server side sending the status request extension
    even when not requested.
  * Add support for RFC7507 by introducing the %FALLBACK_SCSV
    priority string option.
  * gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_generate2() will store the generated
    public key, unless the GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_NO_STORE_PUBKEY
    flag is specified.
  * Correct regression from 3.4.3 in loading PKCS #8 keys as fallback.
  * API and ABI modifications:
    gnutls_prf_rfc5705: Added
    gnutls_hex_encode2: Added
    gnutls_hex_decode2: Added
- build with autogen for libopts compatibility
- fix failures in test suite, add upstream commits

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 30 15:39:34 UTC 2015 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 3.4.3
  ** libgnutls: Follow closely RFC5280 recommendations and use UTCTime for
     dates prior to 2050.
  ** libgnutls: Force 16-byte alignment to all input to ciphers (previously it
     was done only when cryptodev was enabled).
  ** libgnutls: Removed support for pthread_atfork() as it has undefined
     semantics when used with dlopen(), and may lead to a crash.
  ** libgnutls: corrected failure when importing plain files 
     with gnutls_x509_privkey_import2(), and a password was provided.
  ** libgnutls: Don't reject certificates if a CA has the URI or IP address
     name constraints, and the end certificate doesn't have an IP address 
     name or a URI set.
  ** libgnutls: set and read the hint in DHE-PSK and ECDHE-PSK ciphersuites.
  ** p11tool: Added --list-token-urls option, and print the token module name
     in list-tokens.
  ** libgnutls: DTLS blocking API is more robust against infinite blocking,
     and will notify of more possible timeouts.
  ** libgnutls: corrected regression with Camellia-256-GCM cipher. Reported
     by Manuel Pegourie-Gonnard.
  ** libgnutls: Introduced the GNUTLS_NO_SIGNAL flag to gnutls_init(). That
     allows to disable SIGPIPE for writes done within gnutls.
  ** libgnutls: Enhanced the PKCS #7 API to allow signing and verification
     of structures. API moved to gnutls/pkcs7.h header.
  ** certtool: Added options to generate PKCS #7 bundles and signed
     structures.
- includes changes from 3.4.2:
  * DTLS blocking API is more robust against infinite blocking,
    and will notify of more possible timeouts.
  * Correct regression with Camellia-256-GCM cipher.
  * Introduce the GNUTLS_NO_SIGNAL flag to gnutls_init(). That
    allows to disable SIGPIPE for writes done within gnutls.
  * Enhance the PKCS #7 API to allow signing and verification
    of structures. Move API to gnutls/pkcs7.h header.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_certificate_get_ours: will return the certificate even
  if a callback was used to send it.
  ** libgnutls: Check for invalid length in the X.509 version field. Without
  the check certificates with invalid length would be detected as having an
  arbitrary version. Reported by Hanno Böck.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 12 10:16:33 UTC 2015 - meissner@suse.com

- updated to 3.4.0 (released 2015-04-08)

  ** libgnutls: Added support for AES-CCM and AES-CCM-8 (RFC6655 and RFC7251)
  ciphersuites. The former are enabled by default, the latter need to be
  explicitly enabled, since they reduce the overall security level.

  ** libgnutls: Added support for Chacha20-Poly1305 ciphersuites following
  draft-mavrogiannopoulos-chacha-tls-05 and draft-irtf-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305-10.
  That is currently provided as technology preview and is not enabled by
  default, since there are no assigned ciphersuite points by IETF and there 
  is no guarrantee of compatibility between draft versions. The ciphersuite
  priority string to enable it is "+CHACHA20-POLY1305".

  ** libgnutls: Added support for encrypt-then-authenticate in CBC
  ciphersuites (RFC7366 -taking into account its errata text). This is
  enabled by default and can be disabled using the %NO_ETM priority
  string.

  ** libgnutls: Added support for the extended master secret
  (triple-handshake fix) following draft-ietf-tls-session-hash-02.

  ** libgnutls: Added a new simple and hard to misuse AEAD API (crypto.h).

  ** libgnutls: SSL 3.0 is no longer included in the default priorities
  list. It has to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with a string like
  "NORMAL:+VERS-SSL3.0".

  ** libgnutls: ARCFOUR (RC4) is no longer included in the default priorities
  list. It has to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with a string like
  "NORMAL:+ARCFOUR-128".

  ** libgnutls: DSA signatures and DHE-DSS are no longer included in the
  default priorities list. They have to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with
  a string like "NORMAL:+DHE-DSS:+SIGN-DSA-SHA256:+SIGN-DSA-SHA1". The
  DSA ciphersuites were dropped because they had no deployment at all
  on the internet, to justify their inclusion.

  ** libgnutls: The priority string EXPORT was completely removed. The string
  was already defunc as support for the EXPORT ciphersuites was removed in
  GnuTLS 3.2.0.

  ** libgnutls: Added API to utilize system specific private keys in
  "gnutls/system-keys.h". It is currently provided as technology preview
  and is restricted to windows CNG keys.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname() and friends will use
  RFC6125 comparison of hostnames. That introduces a dependency on libidn.

  ** libgnutls: Depend on p11-kit 0.23.1 to comply with the final
  PKCS #11 URLs draft (draft-pechanec-pkcs11uri-21).

  ** libgnutls: Depend on nettle 3.1.

  ** libgnutls: Use getrandom() or getentropy() when available. That
  avoids the complexity of file descriptor handling and issues with
  applications closing all open file descriptors on startup.

  ** libgnutls: Use pthread_atfork() to detect fork when available.

  ** libgnutls: The gnutls_handshake() process will enforce a timeout by
  default.

  ** libgnutls: If a key purpose (extended key usage) is specified for verification,
  it is applied into intermediate certificates. The verification result
  GNUTLS_CERT_PURPOSE_MISMATCH is also introduced. 

  ** libgnutls: When gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2() is used in
  combination with PKCS #11, or TPM URLs, it will utilize the provided
  password as PIN if required. That removes the requirement for the
  application to set a callback for PINs in that case.

  ** libgnutls: priority strings VERS-TLS-ALL and VERS-DTLS-ALL are 
  restricted to the corresponding protocols only, and the VERS-ALL
  string is introduced to catch all possible protocols.

  ** libgnutls: Added helper functions to obtain information on PKCS #8
  structures.

  ** libgnutls: Certificate chains which are provided to gnutls_certificate_credentials_t
  will automatically be sorted instead of failing with GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_LIST_UNSORTED.

  ** libgnutls: Added functions to export and set the record state. That
  allows for gnutls_record_send() and recv() to be offloaded (to kernel,
  hardware or any other subsystem).

  ** libgnutls: Added the ability to register application specific URL
  types, which express certificates and keys using gnutls_register_custom_url().

  ** libgnutls: Added API to override existing ciphers, digests and MACs, e.g.,
  to override AES-GCM using a system-specific accelerator. That is, (crypto.h)
  gnutls_crypto_register_cipher(), gnutls_crypto_register_aead_cipher(),
  gnutls_crypto_register_mac(), and gnutls_crypto_register_digest().

  ** libgnutls: Added gnutls_ext_register() to register custom extensions.
  Contributed by Thierry Quemerais.

  ** libgnutls: Added gnutls_supplemental_register() to register custom
  supplemental data handshake messages. Contributed by Thierry Quemerais.

  ** libgnutls-openssl: it is no longer built by default.


  ** certtool: Added --p8-info option, which will print PKCS #8 information
  even if the password is not available.

  ** certtool: --key-info option will print PKCS #8 encryption information
  when available.

  ** certtool: Added the --key-id and --fingerprint options.

  ** certtool: Added the --verify-hostname, --verify-email and --verify-purpose
  options to be used in certificate chain verification, to simulate verification
  for specific hostname and key purpose (extended key usage).

  ** certtool: --p12-info option will print PKCS #12 MAC and cipher information
  when available.

  ** certtool: it will print the A-label (ACE) names in addition to UTF-8.

  ** p11tool: added options --set-id and --set-label.

  ** gnutls-cli: added options --priority-list and --save-cert.

  ** guile: Deprecated priority API has been removed. The old priority API, 
  which had been deprecated for some time, is now gone; use 'set-session-priorities!'
  instead.

  ** guile: Remove RSA parameters and related procedures. This API had been 
  deprecated.  

  ** guile: Fix compilation on MinGW. Previously only the static version of the 
  'guile-gnutls-v-2' library would be built, preventing dynamic loading from Guile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  1 14:26:31 UTC 2015 - meissner@suse.com

- updated to 3.3.13 (released 2015-03-30)

  ** libgnutls: When retrieving OCTET STRINGS from PKCS #12 ContentInfo
  structures use BER to decode them (requires libtasn1 4.3). That allows
  to decode some more complex structures.

  ** libgnutls: When an end-certificate with no name is present and there
  are CA name constraints, don't reject the certificate. This follows RFC5280
  advice closely. Reported by Fotis Loukos.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed handling of supplemental data with types > 255.
  Patch by Thierry Quemerais.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed double free in the parsing of CRL distribution points certificate
  extension. Reported by Robert Święcki.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed a two-byte stack overflow in DTLS 0.9 protocol. That
  protocol is not enabled by default (used by openconnect VPN).

  ** libgnutls: The maximum user data send size is set to be the same for
  block and non-block ciphersuites. This addresses a regression with wine:
  https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37500

  ** libgnutls: When generating PKCS #11 keys, set CKA_ID, CKA_SIGN,
  and CKA_DECRYPT when needed.

  ** libgnutls: Allow names with zero size to be set using
  gnutls_server_name_set(). That will disable the Server Name Indication.
  Resolves issue with wine: https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/issues/2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 21 07:17:50 UTC 2015 - meissner@suse.com

- added unbound-devel (for DANE) and trousers-devel (for TPM support)
- removed now upstreamed gnutls-implement-trust-store-dir-3.2.8.diff
- libgnutls-dane0 new library added

- updated to 3.3.13 (released 2015-02-25)
  ** libgnutls: Enable AESNI in GCM on x86
  ** libgnutls: Fixes in DTLS message handling
  ** libgnutls: Check certificate algorithm consistency, i.e.,
     check whether the signatureAlgorithm field matches the signature
     field inside TBSCertificate.
  ** gnutls-cli: Fixes in OCSP verification.

- Version 3.3.12 (released 2015-01-17)

  ** libgnutls: When negotiating TLS use the lowest enabled version in
  the client hello, rather than the lowest supported. In addition, do
  not use SSL 3.0 as a version in the TLS record layer, unless SSL 3.0
  is the only protocol supported. That addresses issues with servers that
  immediately drop the connection when the encounter SSL 3.0 as the record
  version number. See:
  http://lists.gnutls.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2014-November/003673.html

  ** libgnutls: Corrected encoding and decoding of ANSI X9.62 parameters.

  ** libgnutls: Handle zero length plaintext for VIA PadLock functions.
  This solves a potential crash on AES encryption for small size plaintext.
  Patch by Matthias-Christian Ott.

  ** libgnutls: In DTLS don't combine multiple packets which exceed MTU.
  Reported by Andreas Schultz. https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?108715

  ** libgnutls: In DTLS decode all handshake packets present in a record
  packet, in a single pass. Reported by Andreas Schultz.
  https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?108712

  ** libgnutls: When importing a CA file with a PKCS #11 URL, simply
  import the certificates, if the URL specifies objects, rather than
  treating it as trust module.

  ** libgnutls: When importing a PKCS #11 URL and we know the type of
  object we are importing, don't require the object type in the URL.

  ** libgnutls: fixed openpgp authentication when gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2
  was used by the server.

  ** certtool: --pubkey-info will also attempt to load a public key from stdin.

  ** gnutls-cli: Added --starttls-proto option. That allows to specify a
  protocol for starttls negotiation.

- Version 3.3.11 (released 2014-12-11)

  ** libgnutls: Corrected regression introduced in 3.3.9 related to
  session renegotiation. Reported by Dan Winship.

  ** libgnutls: Corrected parsing issue with OCSP responses.

- Version 3.3.10 (released 2014-11-10)

  ** libgnutls: Refuse to import v1 or v2 certificates that contain
  extensions.

  ** libgnutls: Fixes in usage of PKCS #11 token callback

  ** libgnutls: Fixed bug in gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer() when used
  with a PKCS #11 trust module and without the GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY flag.
  Reported by David Woodhouse.

  ** libgnutls: Removed superfluous random generator refresh on every call
  of gnutls_deinit(). That reduces load and usage of /dev/urandom.

  ** libgnutls: Corrected issue in export of ECC parameters to X9.63 format.
  Reported by Sean Burford [GNUTLS-SA-2014-5].

  ** libgnutls: When gnutls_global_init() is called for a second time, it
  will check whether the /dev/urandom fd kept is still open and matches
  the original one. That behavior works around issues with servers that
  close all file descriptors.

  ** libgnutls: Corrected behavior with PKCS #11 objects that are marked
  as CKA_ALWAYS_AUTHENTICATE.

  ** certtool: The default cipher for PKCS #12 structures is 3des-pkcs12.
  That option is more compatible than AES or RC4.

- Version 3.3.9 (released 2014-10-13)

  ** libgnutls: Fixes in the transparent import of PKCS #11 certificates.
  Reported by Joseph Peruski.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed issue with unexpected non-fatal errors resetting the
  handshake's hash buffer, in applications using the heartbeat extension
  or DTLS. Reported by Joeri de Ruiter.

  ** libgnutls: When both a trust module and additional CAs are present 
  account the latter as well; reported by David Woodhouse.

  ** libgnutls: added GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY flag for
  gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer(). That allows the function to be used
  in a thread safe way when PKCS #11 trust modules are in use.

  ** libgnutls: fix issue in DTLS retransmission when session tickets
  were in use; reported by Manuel Pégourié-Gonnard.

  ** libgnutls-dane: Do not require the CA on a ca match to be direct CA.

  ** libgnutls: Prevent abort() in library if getrusage() fails. Try to
  detect instead which of RUSAGE_THREAD and RUSAGE_SELF would work.

  ** guile: new 'set-session-server-name!' procedure; see the manual for
  details.

  ** certtool: The authority key identifier will be set in a certificate only
  if the CA's subject key identifier is set.

- Version 3.3.8 (released 2014-09-18)

  ** libgnutls: Updates in the name constraints checks. No name constraints
  will be checked for intermediate certificates. As our support for name
  constraints is limited to e-mail addresses in DNS names, it is pointless
  to check them on intermediate certificates.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed issues in PKCS #11 object listing. Previously multiple
  object listing would fail completely if a single object could not be exported.

  ** libgnutls: Improved the performance of PKCS #11 object listing/retrieving,
  by retrieving them in large batches. Report and suggestion by David
  Woodhouse.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed issue with certificates being sanitized by gnutls prior
  to signature verification. That resulted to certain non-DER compliant modifications
  of valid certificates, being corrected by libtasn1's parser and restructured as
  the original. Issue found and reported by Antti Karjalainen and Matti Kamunen from
  Codenomicon.

  ** libgnutls: Fixes in gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn() and friends to properly handle
  strings with embedded spaces and escaped commas.

  ** libgnutls: when comparing a CA certificate with the trusted list compare
  the name and key only instead of the whole certificate. That is to handle
  cases where a CA certificate was superceded by a different one with the same
  name and the same key.

  ** libgnutls: when verifying a certificate against a p11-kit trusted
  module, use the attached extensions in the module to override the CA's
  extensions (that requires p11-kit 0.20.7).

  ** libgnutls: In DTLS prevent sending zero-size fragments in certain cases
  of MTU split. Reported by Manuel Pégourié-Gonnard.

  ** libgnutls: Added gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2() which allows
  verifying using a hostname and a purpose (extended key usage). That
  enhances PKCS #11 trust module verification, as it can now check the purpose
  when this function is used.

  ** libgnutls: Corrected gnutls_x509_crl_verify() which would always report
  a CRL signature as invalid. Reported by Armin Burgmeier.

  ** libgnutls: added option --disable-padlock to allow disabling the padlock
  CPU acceleration.

  ** p11tool: when listing tokens, list their type as well.

  ** p11tool: when listing objects from a trust module print any attached
  extensions on certificates.

- Version 3.3.7 (released 2014-08-24)

  ** libgnutls: Added function to export the public key of a PKCS #11
  private key. Contributed by Wolfgang Meyer zu Bergsten.

  ** libgnutls: Explicitly set the exponent in PKCS #11 key generation.
  That improves compatibility with certain PKCS #11 modules. Contributed by
  Wolfgang Meyer zu Bergsten.

  ** libgnutls: When generating a PKCS #11 private key allow setting
  the WRAP/UNWRAP flags. Contributed by Wolfgang Meyer zu Bergsten.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t will always hold an open session
  to the key.

  ** libgnutls: bundle replacements of inet_pton and inet_aton if not
  available.

  ** libgnutls: initialize parameters variable on PKCS #8 decryption.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_pkcs12_verify_mac() will not fail in other than SHA1
  algorithms.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname() will follow the RFC6125
  requirement of checking the Common Name (CN) part of DN only if there is
  a single CN present in the certificate.

  ** libgnutls: The environment variable GNUTLS_FORCE_FIPS_MODE can be used
  to force the FIPS mode, when set to 1.

  ** libgnutls: In DTLS ignore only errors that relate to unexpected packets
  and decryption failures.

  ** p11tool: Added --info parameter.

  ** certtool: Added --mark-wrap parameter.

  ** danetool: --check will attempt to retrieve the server's certificate
  chain and verify against it.

  ** danetool/gnutls-cli-debug: Added --app-proto parameters which can
  be used to enforce starttls (currently only SMTP and IMAP) on the connection.

  ** danetool: Added openssl linking exception, to allow linking
  with libunbound.

- Version 3.3.6 (released 2014-07-23)

  ** libgnutls: Use inet_ntop to print IP addresses when available

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname and friends will also check
  IP addresses, and match documented behavior. Reported by David Woodhouse.

  ** libgnutls: DSA key generation in FIPS140-2 mode doesn't allow 1024
  bit parameters.

  ** libgnutls: fixed issue in gnutls_pkcs11_reinit() which prevented tokens
  being usable after a reinitialization.

  ** libgnutls: fixed PKCS #11 private key operations after a fork.

  ** libgnutls: fixed PKCS #11 ECDSA key generation.

  ** libgnutls: The GNUTLS_CPUID_OVERRIDE environment variable can be used to 
  explicitly enable/disable the use of certain CPU capabilities. Note that CPU
  detection cannot be overriden, i.e., VIA options cannot be enabled on an Intel
  CPU. The currently available options are:
    0x1: Disable all run-time detected optimizations
    0x2: Enable AES-NI
    0x4: Enable SSSE3
    0x8: Enable PCLMUL
    0x100000: Enable VIA padlock
    0x200000: Enable VIA PHE
    0x400000: Enable VIA PHE SHA512

  ** libdane: added dane_query_to_raw_tlsa(); patch by Simon Arlott.

  ** p11tool: use GNUTLS_SO_PIN to read the security officer's PIN if set.

  ** p11tool: ask for label when one isn't provided.

  ** p11tool: added --batch parameter to disable any interactivity.

  ** p11tool: will not implicitly enable so-login for certain types of
  objects. That avoids issues with tokens that require different login
  types.

  ** certtool/p11tool: Added the --curve parameter which allows to explicitly
  specify the curve to use.

- Version 3.3.5 (released 2014-06-26)

  ** libgnutls: Added gnutls_record_recv_packet() and gnutls_packet_deinit().
  These functions provide a variant of gnutls_record_recv() that avoids
  the final memcpy of data.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial() was added as a
  faster variant of gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial() when coping with
  very large structures.

  ** libgnutls: When the decoding of a printable DN element fails, then treat
  it as unknown and print its hex value rather than failing. That works around
  an issue in a TURKTRST root certificate which improperly encodes the
  X520countryName element.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_file() will return the number
  of certificates present in a PKCS #11 token when loading it.

  ** libgnutls: Allow the post client hello callback to put the handshake on
  hold, by returning GNUTLS_E_AGAIN or GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED.

  ** certtool: option --to-p12 will now consider --load-ca-certificate

  ** certtol: Added option to specify the PKCS #12 friendly name on command line.

  ** p11tool: Allow marking a certificate copied to a token as a CA.

- Version 3.3.4 (released 2014-05-31)

  ** libgnutls: Updated Andy Polyakov's assembly code. That prevents a
  crash on certain CPUs.

- Version 3.3.3 (released 2014-05-30)

  ** libgnutls: Eliminated memory corruption issue in Server Hello parsing.
  Issue reported by Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_global_set_mutex() was modified to operate with the
  new initialization process.

  ** libgnutls: Increased the maximum certificate size buffer
  in the PKCS #11 subsystem.

  ** libgnutls: Check the return code of getpwuid_r() instead of relying
  on the result value. That avoids issue in certain systems, when using
  tofu authentication and the home path cannot be determined. Issue reported
  by Viktor Dukhovni.

  ** libgnutls-dane: Improved dane_verify_session_crt(), which now attempts to
  create a full chain. This addresses points from https://savannah.gnu.org/support/index.php?108552

  ** gnutls-cli: --dane will only check the end certificate if PKIX validation
  has been disabled.

  ** gnutls-cli: --benchmark-soft-ciphers has been removed. That option cannot
  be emulated with the implicit initialization of gnutls.

  ** certtool: Allow multiple organizations and organizational unit names to
  be specified in a template.

  ** certtool: Warn when invalid configuration options are set to a template.

  ** ocsptool: Include path in ocsp request. This resolves #108582
  (https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?108582), reported by Matt McCutchen.

- Version 3.3.2 (released 2014-05-06)

  ** libgnutls: Added the 'very weak' certificate verification profile
  that corresponds to 64-bit security level.

  ** libgnutls: Corrected file descriptor leak on random generator
  initialization.

  ** libgnutls: Corrected file descriptor leak on PSK password file
  reading. Issue identified using the Codenomicon TLS test suite.

  ** libgnutls: Avoid deinitialization if initialization has failed.

  ** libgnutls: null-terminate othername alternative names.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer() will operate correctly
  on a PKCS #11 trust list.

  ** libgnutls: Several small bug fixes identified using valgrind and
  the Codenomicon TLS test suite.

  ** libgnutls-dane: Accept a certificate using DANE if there is at least one
  entry that matches the certificate. Patch by simon [at] arlott.org.

  ** libgnutls-guile: Fixed compilation issue.

  ** certtool: Allow exporting a CRL on DER format.

  ** certtool: The ECDSA keys generated by default use the SECP256R1 curve
  which is supported more widely than the previously used SECP224R1.

- Version 3.3.1 (released 2014-04-19)

  ** libgnutls: Enforce more strict checks to heartbeat messages
  concerning padding and payload. Suggested by Peter Dettman.

  ** libgnutls: Allow decoding PKCS #8 files with ECC parameters
  from openssl.

  ** libgnutls: Several small bug fixes found by coverity.

  ** libgnutls: The conditionally available self-test functions
  were moved to self-test.h.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed issue with the check of incoming data when two
  different recv and send pointers have been specified. Reported and
  investigated by JMRecio.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed issue in the RSA-PSK key exchange, which would 
  result to illegal memory access if a server hint was provided. Reported
  by André Klitzing.

  ** libgnutls: Fixed client memory leak in the PSK key exchange, if a
  server hint was provided.

  ** libgnutls: Corrected the *get_*_othername_oid() functions.

- Version 3.3.0 (released 2014-04-10)

  ** libgnutls: The initialization of the library was moved to a
  constructor. That is, gnutls_global_init() is no longer required
  unless linking with a static library or a system that does not
  support library constructors.

  ** libgnutls: static libraries are not built by default.

  ** libgnutls: PKCS #11 initialization is delayed to first usage.
  That avoids long delays in gnutls initialization due to broken PKCS #11
  modules.

  ** libgnutls: The PKCS #11 subsystem is re-initialized "automatically"
  on the first PKCS #11 API call after a fork. 

  ** libgnutls: certificate verification profiles were introduced
  that can be specified as flags to verification functions. They
  are enumerations in gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t
  and can be converted to flags for use in a verification function
  using GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS().

  ** libgnutls: Added the ability to read system-specific initial
  keywords, if they are prefixed with '@'. That allows a compile-time
  specified configuration file to be used to read pre-configured priority
  strings from. That can be used to impose system specific policies.

  ** libgnutls: Increased the default security level of priority
  strings (NORMAL and PFS strings require at minimum a 1008 DH prime), 
  and set a verification profile by default.  The LEGACY keyword is 
  introduced to set the old defaults.

  ** libgnutls: Added support for the name constraints PKIX extension.
  Currently only DNS names and e-mails are supported (no URIs, IPs
  or DNs).

  ** libgnutls: Security parameter SEC_PARAM_NORMAL was renamed to 
  SEC_PARAM_MEDIUM to avoid confusion with the priority string NORMAL.

  ** libgnutls: Added new API in x509-ext.h to handle X.509 extensions.
  This API handles the X.509 extensions in isolation, allowing to parse
  similarly formatted extensions stored in other structures.

  ** libgnutls: When generating DSA keys the macro GNUTLS_SUBGROUP_TO_BITS
  can be used to specify a particular subgroup as the number of bits in
  gnutls_privkey_generate; e.g., GNUTLS_SUBGROUP_TO_BITS(2048, 256).

  ** libgnutls: DH parameter generation is now delegated to nettle.
  That unfortunately has the side-effect that DH parameters longer than
  3072 bits, cannot be generated (not without a nettle update).

  ** libgnutls: Separated nonce RNG from the main RNG. The nonce
  random number generator is based on salsa20/12.

  ** libgnutls: The buffer alignment provided to crypto backend is
  enforced to be 16-byte aligned, when compiled with cryptodev
  support. That allows certain cryptodev drivers to operate more
  efficiently.

  ** libgnutls: Return error when a public/private key pair that doesn't
  match is set into a credentials structure.

  ** libgnutls: Depend on p11-kit 0.20.0 or later.

  ** libgnutls: The new padding (%NEW_PADDING) experimental TLS extension has
  been removed. It was not approved by IETF.

  ** libgnutls: The experimental xssl library is removed from the gnutls
  distribution.

  ** libgnutls: Reduced the number of gnulib modules used in the main library.

  ** libgnutls: Added priority string %DISABLE_WILDCARDS.

  ** libgnutls: Added the more extensible verification function
  gnutls_certificate_verify_peers(), that allows checking, in addition
  to a peer's DNS hostname, for the key purpose of the end certificate
  (via PKIX extended key usage).

  ** certtool: Timestamps for serial numbers were increased to 8 bytes,
  and in batch mode to 12 (appended with 4 random bytes).

  ** certtool: When no CRL number is provided (or value set to -1), then
  a time-based number will be used, similarly to the serial generation
  number in certificates.

  ** certtool: Print the SHA256 fingerprint of a certificate in addition
  to SHA1.

  ** libgnutls: Added --enable-fips140-mode configuration option (unsupported).
  That option enables (when running on FIPS140-enabled system):
   o RSA, DSA and DH key generation as in FIPS-186-4 (using provable primes)
   o The DRBG-CTR-AES256 deterministic random generator from SP800-90A.
   o Self-tests on initialization on ciphers/MACs, public key algorithms 
     and the random generator.
   o HMAC-SHA256 verification of the library on load.
   o MD5 is included for TLS purposes but cannot be used by the high level
     hashing functions.
   o All ciphers except AES are disabled.
   o All MACs and hashes except GCM and SHA are disabled (e.g., HMAC-MD5).
   o All keys (temporal and long term) are zeroized after use.
   o Security levels are adjusted to the FIPS140-2 recommendations (rather
     than ECRYPT).

  ** libgnutls: Eliminated memory corruption issue in Server Hello parsing.
  Issue reported by Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon. (CVE-2014-3466 / bnc#880730)
  ** libgnutls: Several memory leaks caused by error conditions were
  fixed. The leaks were identified using valgrind and the Codenomicon

- Upgrade to 3.2.13
  * Version 3.2.13 (released 2014-04-07)

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_openpgp_keyring_import will no longer fail silently
  if there are no base64 data. Report and patch by Ramkumar Chinchani.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_record_send is now safe to be called under DTLS when
  in corked mode.

  ** libgnutls: Ciphersuites that use the SHA256 or SHA384 MACs are
  only available in TLS 1.0 as SSL 3.0 doesn't specify parameters for
  these algorithms.

  ** libgnutls: Changed the behaviour in wildcard acceptance in certificates.
  Wildcards are only accepted when there are more than two domain components
  after the wildcard. This drops support for the permissive RFC2818 wildcards
  and adds more conservative support based on the suggestions in RFC6125. Suggested
  by Jeffrey Walton.

  ** certtool: When no password is provided to export a PKCS #8 keys, do
  not encrypt by default. This reverts to the certtool behavior of gnutls
  3.0. The previous behavior of encrypting using an empty password can be
  replicating using the new parameter --empty-password.

  ** p11tool: Avoid dual initialization of the PKCS #11 subsystem when
  the --provider option is given.

  ** libgnutls: Reduced the TLS and DTLS version requirements for all
     ciphersuites that are not GCM.

  ** libgnutls: When two initial keywords are specified then treat the
     second as having the '+' modifier.

  ** libgnutls:  When using a PKCS #11 module for verification ensure that
     it has been marked a trusted policy module in p11-kit. Moreover, when an
     empty (i.e., "pkcs11:") URL is specified, then try all trusted modules
     in the system for verification.
     http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/doc/p11-kit/pkcs11-conf.html

  ** libgnutls: Fixed bug that prevented the rejection of v1 intermediate
     CA certificates. Reported and investigated by Suman Jana.
     CVE-2014-1959 / bnc#863989

  ** certtool: Added the --ask-pass option.

Tue Feb 11 12:16:48 UTC 2014 - meissner@suse.com

- Upgrade to 3.1.20 (released 2014-01-31)
  ** libgnutls: fixed null pointer derefence when printing a certificate
     DN and an LDAP description isn't present.
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_db_check_entry_time will correctly report the time;
     report and patch by Jonathan Roudiere.

- Upgrade to 3.2.9 (released 2014-01-24)

  ** libgnutls: The %DUMBFW option in priority string only
     appends data to client hello if the expected size is in the
     "black hole" range.

  ** libgnutls: %COMPAT implies %DUMBFW.

  ** libgnutls: gnutls_session_get_desc() returns a more compact
     ciphersuite description.

  * libgnutls: In PKCS #11 allow deleting multiple non-certificate data.

  ** libgnutls: When a PKCS #11 trust store is specified (e.g. using the
     configure option --with-default-trust-store-pkcs11), then the PKCS #11
     token is used on demand to obtain the trusted anchors, rather than
     preloading all trusted certificates. That delegates CA certificate
     management and blacklist checking to the PKCS #11 module.

  ** libgnutls: When a PKCS #11 trust store is specified in configure
     option or in gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_file(), then the module is
     used to obtain the verification anchors and any required blacklists as
     in
     http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/doc/storing-trust-policy/storing-trust-pkcs11.html

  ** libgnutls: Fix in OCSP certificate status extension handling
     in non-blocking servers. Patch by Nils Maier.

  ** p11tool: Added --so-login option to force login as security
     officer (admin).

- reenable ECDHE after review of modern cryptographic practices.

- gnutls-fix-missing-ipv6.patch: handle getaddrinfo/socket availability
  issues in gnutls-serv

- gnutls-3.2.10-supported-ecc.patch: do not abort gnutls-cli on sites
  sending the client only ECC extension (www.bsi.de)

- Upgrade to 3.2.8

* Version 3.2.8 (released 2013-12-20)

** libgnutls: Updated code for AES-NI. That prevents an uninitialized
variable complaint from valgrind.

** libgnutls: Enforce a maximum size for DH primes.

** libgnutls: Added SSSE3 optimized SHA1, and SHA256, using Andy
Polyakov's code.

** libgnutls: Added SSSE3 optimized AES using Mike Hamburg's code.

** libgnutls: It only links to librt if the required functions are not
present in libc. This also prevents an indirect linking to libpthread.

** libgnutls: Fixed issue with gnulib strerror replacement by adding
the strerror gnulib module.

** libgnutls: The time provided in the TLS random values is only
precise on its first 3 bytes. That prevents leakage of the precise
system time (at least on the client side when only few connections are
done on a single server).

** certtool: The --verify option will use the system CAs if the
load-ca-certificate option is not provided.

** configure: Added option --with-default-blacklist-file to allow
specifying a certificate blacklist file.

** configure: Added --disable-non-suiteb-curves option. This option
restricts the supported curves to SuiteB curves.

** API and ABI modifications: gnutls_record_check_corked: Added

from external DNS resolutions, and to allow direct verification of a
certificate chain against a dane_query_t. Contributed by Christian Grothoff.

** libdane: Fixed a buffer overflow in dane_query_tlsa(). This could be
triggered by a DNS server supplying more than 4 DANE records. Report and
fix by Christian Grothoff.

** srptool: Fixed index command line option. Patch by Attila Molnar.

- Override broken configure checks

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  4 16:15:14 UTC 2013 - lnussel@suse.de

- use pkcs11 interface to fetch the system's CA certificates
  (fate#314991). Add patch gnutls-3.2.1-pkcs11.diff to fix doing

  currently not yet forward ported.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.2.1
  ** libgnutls: Allow ECC when in SSL 3.0 to work-around a bug in certain
     openssl versions.
  ** libgnutls: Fixes in interrupted function resumption. Report
     and patch by Tim Kosse.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected issue when receiving client hello verify
     requests in DTLS.

  ** libgnutls: Added support for the Application Layer Protocol
     Negotiation (ALPN) extension.
  ** libgnutls: Removed support for the RSA-EXPORT ciphersuites.
  ** libgnutls: Avoid linking to librt (that also avoids unnecessary
     linking to pthreads if p11-kit isn't used).

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.10 (released 2013-03-22)
  ** certtool: When generating PKCS #12 files use by default the 
  ARCFOUR (RC4) cipher to be compatible with devices that don't
  support AES with PKCS #12.
  ** libgnutls: Load CA certificates in android 4.x systems.
  ** libgnutls: Optimized CA certificate loading.
  ** libgnutls: Private keys are overwritten on deinitialization.
  ** libgnutls: PKCS #11 slots are scanned only when needed, not
     on initialization. This speeds up gnutls initialization when smart
     cards are present.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected issue in the (deprecated) external key
     signing interface, when used with TLS 1.2. Reported by Bjorn H. Christensen.
  ** libgnutls: Fixes in openpgp handshake with fingerprints. Reported by 
     Joke de Buhr.
  ** libgnutls-dane: Updated DANE verification options.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.9 (released 2013-02-27) 
  ** certtool: Option --to-p12 will now ask for a password to generate
     a PKCS #12 file from an encrypted key file. Reported by Yan Fiz.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected issue in gnutls_pubkey_verify_data().
  ** libgnutls: Corrected parsing issue in XMPP within a subject 
     alternative name. Reported by James Cloos.
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_pkcs11_reinit() will reinitialize all PKCS #11
     modules, and not only the ones loaded via p11-kit.
  ** libgnutls: Added function to check whether the private key is
     still available (inserted).
  ** libgnutls: Try to detect fork even during nonce generation.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.8 (released 2013-02-10)
  ** libgnutls: Fixed issue in gnutls_x509_privkey_import2() which didn't return
     GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED in all cases, and affect certtool operation
     with encrypted keys. Reported by Yan Fiz.
  ** libgnutls: The minimum DH bits accepted by priorities NORMAL and
     PERFORMANCE was set to previous defaults 727 bits. Reported by Diego
     Elio Petteno.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected issue which prevented gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash() 
     to operate with long keys. Reported by Erik A Jensen.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.7 (released 2013-02-04)
  ** certtool: Added option "dn" which allows to directly set the DN
     in a template from an RFC4514 string.
  ** danetool: Added options: --dlv and --insecure. Suggested by Paul Wouters.
  ** libgnutls-xssl: Added a new library to simplify GnuTLS usage.
  ** libgnutls-dane: Added function to specify a DLV file.
  ** libgnutls: Heartbeat code was made optional. 
  ** libgnutls: Fixes in server side of DTLS-0.9.
  ** libgnutls: DN variable 'T' was expanded to 'title'.
  ** libgnutls: Fixes in record padding parsing to prevent a timing attack. 
     Issue reported by Kenny Paterson and Nadhem Alfardan.
  ** libgnutls: Added functions to directly set the DN in a certificate
     or request from an RFC4514 string.
  ** libgnutls: Optimizations in the random generator. The re-seeding of
     it is now explicitly done on every session deinit.
  ** libgnutls: Simplified the DTLS sliding window implementation.
  ** libgnutls: The minimum DH bits accepted by a client are now set
     by the specified priority string. The current values correspond to the
     previous defaults (727 bits), except for the SECURE128 and SECURE192
     strings which increase the minimum to 1248 and 1776 respectively.
  ** libgnutls: Added the gnutls_record_cork() and uncork API to enable 
     buffering in sending application data.
  ** libgnutls: Removed default random padding, and added a length-hiding interface 
     instead.  Both the server and the client must support this extension. Whether 
     length-hiding can be used on a given session can be checked using
     gnutls_record_can_use_length_hiding(). Contributed by Alfredo Pironti.
  ** libgnutls: Added the experimental %NEW_PADDING priority string. It enables 
     a new padding mechanism in TLS allowing arbitrary padding in TLS records
     in all ciphersuites, which makes length-hiding more efficient and solves 
     the issues with timing attacks on CBC ciphersuites.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected gnutls_cipher_decrypt2() when used with AEAD
     ciphers (i.e., AES-GCM). Reported by William McGovern.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.6 (released 2013-01-02)
  ** libgnutls: Fixed record padding parsing issue. Reported by Kenny
     Patterson and Nadhem Alfardan.
  ** libgnutls: Several updates in the ASN.1 string handling subsystem.
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_get_policy() allows for a list of zero
     policy qualifiers.
  ** libgnutls: Ignore heartbeat messages when received out-of-order,
     instead of issuing an error.
  ** libgnutls: Stricter RSA PKCS #1 1.5 encoding and decoding. Reported
     by Kikuchi Masashi.
  ** libgnutls: TPM support is disabled by default because GPL programs
     cannot link with it. Use --with-tpm to enable it.
  ** libgnutls-guile: Fixed parallel compilation issue.
  ** gnutls-cli: It will try to connect to all possible returned addresses
     before failing.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.5 (released 2012-11-24)
  ** libgnutls: Added functions to parse the certificates policies
     extension.
  ** libgnutls: Handle BMPString (UCS-2) encoding in the Distinguished
     Name by translating it to UTF-8 (works on windows or systems with
     iconv).
  ** libgnutls: Added PKCS #11 key generation function that returns the
     public key on generation.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected bug in priority string parsing, that mostly 
     affected combined levels. Patch by Tim Kosse.
  ** certtool: The --pubkey-info option can be combined with the
     --load-privkey or --load-request to print the corresponding public keys.
  ** certtool: It is able to set certificate policies via a template.
  ** certtool: Added --hex-numbers option which prints big numbers in 
     an easier to parse format.
  ** p11tool: After key generation, outputs the public key (useful in
     tokens that do not store the public key).
  ** danetool: It is being built even without libgnutls-dane (the
     --check functionality is disabled though).

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.4 (released 2012-11-10)
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2() will set flags depending on
     the available revocation data validity.
  ** libgnutls: Added gnutls_certificate_verification_status_print(),
     a function to print the verification status code in human readable text.
  ** libgnutls: Added priority string %VERIFY_DISABLE_CRL_CHECKS.
  ** libgnutls: Simplified certificate verification by adding
     gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3().
  ** libgnutls: Added support for extension to establish keys for SRTP.
     Contributed by Martin Storsjo.
  ** libgnutls: The X.509 verification functions check the key
     usage bits and pathlen constraints and on failure output 
     GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE.
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crl_verify() includes the time checks.
  ** libgnutls: Added verification flag GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN
     and made GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN the default.
  ** libgnutls: Always tolerate key usage violation errors from the side
     of the peer, but also notify via an audit message.
  ** gnutls-cli: Added --local-dns option.
  ** danetool: Corrected bug that prevented loading PEM files.
  ** danetool: Added --check option to allow querying and verifying
     a site's DANE data.
  ** libgnutls-dane: Added pkg-config file for the library.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.3 (released 2012-10-12)
  ** libgnutls: Added support for the OCSP Certificate Status
     extension.
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2() will use the OCSP
     certificate status extension in verification.
  ** libgnutls: Bug fixes in gnutls_x509_privkey_import_openssl().
  ** libgnutls: Increased maximum password length in the PKCS #12
     functions.
  ** libgnutls: Fixed the receipt of session tickets during session resumption.
     Reported by danblack at http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?108146
  ** libgnutls: Added functions to export structures in an allocated buffer.
  ** libgnutls: Added gnutls_ocsp_resp_check_crt() to check whether the OCSP
     response corresponds to the given certificate.
  ** libgnutls: In client side gnutls_init() enables the session ticket and
     OCSP certificate status request extensions by default. The flag
     GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS can be used to prevent that.
  ** libgnutls: Several updates in the OpenPGP code. The generating code
     is fully RFC6091 compliant and RFC5081 support is only supported in client
     mode.
  ** libgnutls-dane: Added. It is a library to provide DANE with DNSSEC 
     certificate verification.
  ** gnutls-cli: Added --dane option to enable DANE certificate verification.
  ** danetool: Added tool to generate DANE TLSA Resource Records (RR).

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.2 (released 2012-09-26)
  ** libgnutls: Fixed bug in gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_system_trust()
     and gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_mem() that prevented the loading
     of certificates in the windows platform.
  ** libgnutls: Corrected bug in OpenPGP subpacket encoding.
  ** libgnutls: Added support for DTLS/TLS heartbeats by Olga Smolenchuk.
     (the work was done during Google Summer of Code).
  ** libgnutls: Added X.509 certificate verification flag 
     GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN. This flag allows the verification
     of unsorted certificate chains and is enabled by default for
     TLS certificate verification (if gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags() 
     does not override it).
  ** libgnutls: Prints warning on certificates that contain keys of
     an insecure level. If the %COMPAT priority flag is not specified
     the TLS connection fails.
  ** libgnutls: Correctly restore gnutls_record_recv() in DTLS mode
     if interrupted during the retrasmition of handshake data.
  ** libgnutls: Better mingw32 support (patch by LRN).
  ** libgnutls: The %COMPAT keyword, if specified, will tolerate
     key usage violation errors (they are far too common to ignore).
  ** libgnutls: Added GNUTLS_STATELESS_COMPRESSION flag to gnutls_init(),
     which provides a tool to counter compression-related attacks where
     parts of the data are controlled by the attacker _and_ are placed in
     separate records (use with care - do not use compression if not sure).
  ** libgnutls: Depends on libtasn1 2.14 or later.
  ** certtool: Prints the number of bits of the public key algorithm
     parameter in a private key.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.1 (released 2012-09-02)
  ** gnutls-serv: Listens on IPv6. Patch by Bernhard R. Link.
  ** certtool: Changes in password handling of certtool.
     Ask password when required and only if the '--password' option is not
     given. If the '--password' option is given during key generation then 
     assume the PKCS #8 file format, instead of ignoring the password.
  ** tpmtool: No longer asks for key password in registered keys.
  ** libgnutls: Elliptic curve code was optimized by Ilya Tumaykin.
     wmNAF is now used for point multiplication and other optimizations.
     (the major part of the work was done during Google Summer of Code).
  ** libgnutls: The default pull_timeout_function only uses select
     instead of a combination of select() and recv() to prevent issues
     when used in stream sockets in some systems.
  ** libgnutls: Be tolerant in ECDSA signature violations (e.g. using
     SHA256 with a SECP384 curve instead of SHA-384), to interoperate with
     openssl.
  ** libgnutls: Fixed DSA and ECDSA signature generation in smart
     cards. Thanks to Andreas Schwier from cardcontact.de for providing
     me with ECDSA capable smart cards.

- Updated to GnuTLS 3.1.0 (released 2012-08-15)
  ** libgnutls: Added direct support for TPM as a cryptographic module 
     in gnutls/tpm.h. TPM keys can be used in functions accepting files
     using URLs of the following types:
       tpmkey:file=/path/to/file
       tpmkey:uuid=7f468c16-cb7f-11e1-824d-b3a4f4b20343;storage=user

  ** libgnutls: Priority string level keywords can be combined.
     For example the string "SECURE256:+SUITEB128" is now allowed.
  ** libgnutls: requires libnettle 2.5.
  ** libgnutls: Use the PKCS #1 1.5 encoding provided by nettle (2.5)
     for encryption and signatures.
  ** libgnutls: Added GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE to differentiate between
     generic errors and signature verification errors in the verification
     functions.
  ** libgnutls: Added gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse() as a helper function
     to simplify parsing in most PKCS #12 use cases.
  ** libgnutls: gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_file() adds
     the whole certificate chain (if any) to the credentials structure, instead
     of only the end-user certificate.
  ** libgnutls: Key import functions such as gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse()
     and gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8(), return consistently 
     GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED if the input structure is encrypted but no 
     password was provided.

  + libgnutls:
    - Added OCSP support.
      There is a new header file gnutls/ocsp.h and a set of new functions
      under the gnutls_ocsp namespace.  Currently the functionality provided
      is to parse and extract information from OCSP requests/responses, to
      generate OCSP requests and to verify OCSP responses.  See the manual
      for more information.  Run ./configure with --disable-ocsp to build
      GnuTLS without OCSP support.
      This work was sponsored by Smoothwall <http://smoothwall.net/>.
  + ocsptool:
    - Added new command line tool.
      The tool can parse OCSP request/responses, generate OCSP requests and

    - Set don't fragment bit in DTLS sessions
in Linux as well as in BSD.
  + gnutls-cli:
    - Fixed reading from windows terminals.
  + libgnutls:
    - When GNUTLS_OPENPGP_FMT_BASE64 is specified
      the stream is assumed to be base64 encoded (previously
      the encoding was auto-detected). This avoids a decoding
      issue in windows systems.
    - Corrected ciphersuite GNUTLS_ECDHE_PSK_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
    - Added ciphersuites: GNUTLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
      and GNUTLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.
    - Added function gnutls_random_art() to convert
      fingerprints to images (currently ascii-art).
    - Corrected bug in DSA private key parsing, which

    - gnutls_random_art: Added
- Changes from version 3.0.09:
  + certtool:
    - Added new parameter --dh-info.

    - Added new priority string %SERVER_PRECEDENCE, which
      changes the ciphersuite selection procedure. If specified the server
      priorities will be used for selection instead of the client's.
    - Optimizations in Diffie-Hellman parameters generation
      and key exchange.
    - When session tickets are negotiated and used in a
      session, a server will not store that session data into its cache.
    - Added the SECP192R1 curve.
    - Added gnutls_priority_get_cipher_suite_index() to
      allow listing the ciphersuites enabled in a priority structure.
      It outputs an index to be used in gnutls_get_cipher_suite_info().
    - Optimizations in the elliptic curve code --timing
      attacks resistant code is only used in ECDSA private key operations.
  + doc:
    - man pages for API functions generation was fixed and are
      now added again in the distribution.
  + API and ABI modifications:
    - GNUTLS_ECC_CURVE_SECP192R1: New curve definition
    - gnutls_priority_get_cipher_suite_index: Added
- Changes from version 3.0.08:

    - Corrected ECC key generation (introduced in 3.0.6)
    - Provide less timing information when decoding
      TLS/DTLS record packets.
  + doc:
    - man pages for API functions were removed.
      The reason was that the code that auto-generated the man pages missed
      many APIs and we couldn't fix it (volunteers welcome).  See the info
      manual or the GTK-DOC manual instead.
  + API and ABI modifications:
    - gnutls_x509_privkey_verify_params: Added
- Changes from version 3.0.07:

    - Corrected fix in gnutls_session_get_data()
      to report the actual session size when the provided buffer
      is not enough.
    - Fixed ciphersuite GNUTLS_ECDHE_RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,
      which was using a wrong MAC algorithm. Reported by Fabrice Gautier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 23 07:09:28 UTC 2011 - gjhe@novell.com

- update to stable version 2.10.5
  ** libgnutls: Corrected verification of finished messages.

  ** libgnutls: Corrected signature generation and verification
     in the Certificate Verify message when in TLS 1.2. Reported
     by Todd A. Ouska.

  ** pkg-config gnutls.pc improvements.
     The file uses 'Requires.private' for libtasn1 and libz when needed,
     instead of Libs.private.  From Andreas Metzler.

  ** gnutls-serv: Corrected a buffer overflow. Reported and patch by Tomas Mraz.
  
  ** libgnutls: Use ASN1_NULL when writing parameters for RSA signatures.
     This makes us comply with RFC3279. Reported by Michael Rommel.
  
  ** libgnutls: Reverted default behavior for verification and
     introduced GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT. Thus by default
     V1 trusted CAs are allowed, unless the new flag is specified.
  
  ** minitasn1: Updated to Libtasn1 2.9.
  
  ** bgnutls: Correctly add leading zero to PKCS #8 encoded DSA key.
     Reported by Jeffrey Walton.
  
  ** libgnutls: Corrected memory leak in extension data calculation.
     Reported by Mike Blumenkrantz.
  
  ** libgnutls: Remove trailing comma in enums in gnutls.h and x509.h.
  
  ** API and ABI modifications:
     No changes since last version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 15 16:47:31 CEST 2010 - meissner@suse.de

- updated to stable 2.8.6
  ** libgnutls: For CSRs, don't null pad integers for RSA/DSA value.
     VeriSign rejected CSRs with this padding.  

     Note: As a side effect of this change, the "public key identifier"
     value computed for a certificate using this version of GnuTLS will be
     different from values computed using earlier versions of GnuTLS.

  ** libgnutls: For CSRs on DSA keys, don't add DSA parameters to the
     optional SignatureAlgorithm parameter field.
     VeriSign rejected these CSRs.  They are stricly speaking not needed
     since you need the signer's certificate to verify the certificate
     signature anyway. 

  ** libgnutls: When checking openpgp self signature also check the signatures
     of all subkeys.
     Ilari Liusvaara noticed and reported the issue and provided test
     vectors as well.

  ** libgnutls: Cleanups and several bug fixes.
     Found by Steve Grubb and Tomas Mraz.

  ** Link libgcrypt explicitly to certtool, gnutls-cli, gnutls-serv.

  ** Fix --disable-valgrind-tests.

  ** examples: Use the new APIs for printing X.509 certificate information.

  ** i18n: Updated Czech, Dutch, French, Polish, Swedish and Vietnamese
     translations.  Added Simplified Chinese translation.

- Update to version 1.2.10. This release fixes several serious
  bugs that would make the DER decoder in libtasn1 crash on
  invalid input [#149897]. Including: 

  * Corrected a bug in certtool for 64 bit machines.

  * Fix gnutls-cli STARTTLS hang when SIGINT is sent too quickly

  * Corrected bugs in gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl() and
    gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust(), that caused memory
    corruption if more than one certificates were added.

  * Fixed bug in non-blocking gnutls_bye(). gnutls_record_send()
    will no longer invalidate a session if the underlying send
    fails, but it will prevent future writes.
