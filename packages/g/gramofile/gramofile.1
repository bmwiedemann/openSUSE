.TH GRAMOFILE 1 "17 September 2001" "Version 1.6"
.SH NAME
gramofile \- Sample and process analog recordings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gramofile
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBGramoFile\fR provides an interactive, integrated front end to sample audio
data from gramophone records or similar sources, to analyse and enhance
them.  While being text-based, it uses a menu system that yields easy
access to individual functions.  Highlights include a mode for automatic
detection and splitting of single tracks from a larger recording, and
several filters to reduce ticks and other noise in the audio data.  An
integrated help system offers context sensitive information.
.SH "OTHER INFO"
The official \fBGramoFile\fR web page is located at
\fIhttp://www.opensourcepartners.nl/~costar/gramofile/\fR.  Technical details on some
of the filters can be found in the documentation accompanying \fBGramoFile\fR,
usually located in \fI/usr/share/doc/gramofile/\fR.
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
This man page had better contain less marketing speak, but some actual
information on use of the program.
