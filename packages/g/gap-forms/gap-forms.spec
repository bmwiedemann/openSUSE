%description
This package can be used for work with sesquilinear and quadratic
forms on finite vector spaces; objects that are used to describe
polar spaces and classical groups. It provides:

* A way to create and use sesquilinear and quadratic forms on finite
  vector spaces.
* An operation which finds an isometry between two forms of the same
  type.
* An operation which returns the forms left invariant by a matrix
  group.
