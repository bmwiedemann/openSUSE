%description
This package provides support for encoding and decoding binary data according
to 'base16' (see also <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648 RFC 4648>) for
strict (see "Data.ByteString.Base16") and lazy 'ByteString's (see
"Data.ByteString.Base16.Lazy").

See the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base16 base16> package which
provides superior encoding and decoding performance as well as support for
lazy, short, and strict variants of 'Text' and 'ByteString' values.
Additionally, see the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-encoding
base-encoding> package which provides an uniform API providing conversion paths
between more binary and textual types.
