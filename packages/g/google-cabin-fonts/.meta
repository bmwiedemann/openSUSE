  <title>Humanist Sans Serif Font</title>
  <description>The Cabin font family is a humanist sans with 4 weights and true
italics, inspired by Edward Johnston’s and Eric Gill’s typefaces,
with a touch of modernism.

Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some
elements of the geometric sans.

It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality.

The weight distribution is almost monotone, although top and bottom
curves are slightly thin.

Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded and optically adjusted. The
curved stem endings have a 10 degree angle. E and F have shorter
center arms. M is splashed.
