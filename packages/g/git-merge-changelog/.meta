  <description>
Git merge driver for ChangeLog files.

1. It produces no conflict when ChangeLog entries have been inserted
   at the top both in the public and in the private modification. It
   puts the privately added entries above the publicly added entries.

2. It respects the structure of ChangeLog files: entries are not split
   into lines but kept together.

3. It also handles the case of small modifications of past ChangeLog
   entries, or of removed ChangeLog entries: they are merged as one
   would expect it.

4. Conflicts are presented at the top of the file, rather than where
   they occurred, so that the user will see them immediately. (Unlike
   for source code written in some programming language, conflict markers
   that are located several hundreds lines from the top will not cause
   any syntax error and therefore would be likely to remain unnoticed.)
