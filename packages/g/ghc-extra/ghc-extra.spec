%description
A library of extra functions for the standard Haskell libraries. Most functions
are simple additions, filling out missing functionality. A few functions are
available in later versions of GHC, but this package makes them available back
to GHC 7.2.

The module "Extra" documents all functions provided by this library.
Modules such as "Data.List.Extra" provide extra functions over "Data.List" and
also reexport "Data.List". Users are recommended to replace "Data.List" imports
with "Data.List.Extra" if they need the extra functionality.
