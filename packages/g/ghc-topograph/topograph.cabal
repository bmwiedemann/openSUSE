description:
  Directed acyclic graphs can be sorted topographically.
  Existence of topographic ordering allows writing many graph algorithms efficiently.
  And many graphs, e.g. most dependency graphs are acyclic!
  .
  There are some algorithms built-in: dfs, transpose, transitive closure,
  transitive reduction...
  Some algorithms even become not-so-hard to implement, like a longest path!
