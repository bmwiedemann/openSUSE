Tue Sep  3 18:43:11 UTC 2019 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- go1.13 (released 2019-09-03) is a major release of Go.
  Minor releases of go1.13.x will be provided through August 2020.
  Most go1.13 changes are in the implementation of the toolchain,
  runtime, and libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1
  promise of compatibility. Upstream expects almost all Go programs
  to continue to compile and run as before. Changes relevant to
  packaging and the OBS build environment are summarized below,
  see https://golang.org/doc/go1.13 for additional details.
  Refs boo#1149259.
  * As of Go 1.13, the go command by default downloads and
    authenticates modules using the Go module mirror and Go
    checksum database run by Google.
  * Default GO111MODULE="auto" now activates the module-aware mode
    when the current or parent directory contains a go.mod file.
  * Default GOPROXY="https://proxy.golang.org,direct" can contain a
    comma-separated list of proxy URLs or the special token direct.
  * Default GOSUMDB="sum.golang.org" verifies checksums of present
    in go.sum as well as checksums of dependency modules not
    present in go.sum.
  * Build environments which do not have network access should set
    GOPROXY to direct, and/or GOSUMDB to off.
  * If GOSUMDB is set to off, the checksum database is not
    consulted and only the existing checksums in the go.sum file
    are verified.
  * If your code uses modules and your go.mod files specifies a
    language version, be sure it is set to at least 1.13 to get
    access to go1.13 language changes. You can do this by editing
    the go.mod file directly, or you can run go mod edit -go=1.13.
  * As announced in Go 1.12, Go 1.13 enables support for TLS 1.3 in
    the crypto/tls package by default. It can be disabled by adding
    the value tls13=0 to the GODEBUG environment variable. The
    opt-out will be removed in Go 1.14.
  * The new crypto/ed25519 package implements the Ed25519 signature
    scheme. This functionality was previously provided by the
    golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519 package, which becomes a wrapper
    for crypto/ed25519 when used with Go 1.13+.
  * The runtime is now more aggressive at returning memory to the
    operating system to make it available to co-tenant
    applications. Previously, the runtime could retain memory for
    five or more minutes following a spike in the heap size. It
    will now begin returning it promptly after the heap
    shrinks. However, on many OSes, including Linux, the OS itself
    reclaims memory lazily, so process RSS will not decrease until
    the system is under memory pressure.
  * The compiler has a new implementation of escape analysis that
    is more precise. For most Go code should be an improvement (in
    other words, more Go variables and expressions allocated on the
    stack instead of heap). However, this increased precision may
    also break invalid code that happened to work before (for
    example, code that violates the unsafe.Pointer safety
    rules). If you notice any regressions that appear related, the
    old escape analysis pass can be re-enabled with
    go build -gcflags=all=-newescape=false. The option to use the
    old escape analysis will be removed in a future release.
  * The compiler no longer emits floating point or complex
    constants to go_asm.h files. These have always been emitted in
    a form that could not be used as numeric constant in assembly
    code.
- Drop patch allow-binary-only-packages.patch
  * This change was applied as of go1.13beta1 packaging
  * As announced in the Go 1.12 release notes, binary-only packages
    are no longer supported. Building a binary-only package (marked
    with a //go:binary-only-package comment) now results in an
    error.
  * In go1.12 and earlier, it was possible to distribute packages in
    binary form without including the source code used for compiling
    the package. "go build" and other commands no longer support
    binary-only-packages.
    https://tip.golang.org/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Binary_Only_Packages
  * Go applications are statically compiled from collected sources
    and compiled go modules are not commonly deployed as binary-only
    dependency packages.
  * Support for binary-only packages has been narrowing since
    go1.10. Context noted here for historical purposes:
    * https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.10: Many details of the go
      build implementation have changed to support these
      improvements. One new requirement implied by these changes is
      that binary-only packages must now declare accurate import
      blocks in their stub source code, so that those imports can
      be made available when linking a program using the
      binary-only package. For more details, see go help filetype.
    * go help filetype: Non-test Go source files can also include a
      //go:binary-only-package comment, indicating that the package
      sources are included for documentation only and must not be
      used to build the package binary. This enables distribution
      of Go packages in their compiled form alone. Even binary-only
      packages require accurate import blocks listing required
      dependencies, so that those dependencies can be supplied when
      linking the resulting command.
    * go#23473 cmd/go: can't link programs that depend on transitive binary only packages
    * go#24318 cmd/go: go:binary-only-package not working in go 1.10
- Regenerate gcc6 go bootstrap patch gcc6-go.patch to include recent
  GO111MODULE=off argument in go (patch to go-6) build commands

  * Support for binary-only packages has been narrowing since
    go1.10. Context noted here for historical purposes:
    * https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.10: Many details of the go
      build implementation have changed to support these
      improvements. One new requirement implied by these changes is
      that binary-only packages must now declare accurate import
      blocks in their stub source code, so that those imports can
      be made available when linking a program using the
      binary-only package. For more details, see go help filetype.
    * go help filetype: Non-test Go source files can also include a
      //go:binary-only-package comment, indicating that the package
      sources are included for documentation only and must not be
      used to build the package binary. This enables distribution
      of Go packages in their compiled form alone. Even binary-only
      packages require accurate import blocks listing required
      dependencies, so that those dependencies can be supplied when
      linking the resulting command.
    * go#23473 cmd/go: can't link programs that depend on transitive binary only packages
    * go#24318 cmd/go: go:binary-only-package not working in go 1.10
