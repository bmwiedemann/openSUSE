%description
Tea can be used to manage most entities on one or multiple Gitea
instances and provides local helpers like 'tea pr checkout'.

It tries to make use of context provided by the repository in $PWD
if available. And works best in a upstream/fork workflow, when the
local main branch tracks the upstream repo. It also assumes that
local git state is published on the remote before doing operations.
Configuration lives in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tea.

The binary name has been renamed to "gitea", as "tea" has been
already taken.
