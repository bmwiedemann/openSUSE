%description
<http://hedgehog.qa/ Hedgehog> automatically generates a comprehensive array of
test cases, exercising your software in ways human testers would never imagine.

Generate hundreds of test cases automatically, exposing even the most insidious
of corner cases. Failures are automatically simplified, giving developers
coherent, intelligible error messages.
