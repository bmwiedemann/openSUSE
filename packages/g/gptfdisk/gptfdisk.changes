Thu Sep  7 08:44:04 UTC 2023 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Add patch to fix UUID generation with util-linux >= 2.38:
  * gptfdisk-1.0.9-libuuid.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  7 02:57:27 UTC 2023 - Alynx Zhou <alynx.zhou@suse.com>

- Add gptfdisk-fix-null-pointer-dereference.patch: Fix NULL pointer
  dereference in pervious patch, poptGetArg can return NULL so we
  should not pass it to strdup directly (bsc#1208877).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 30 11:17:17 UTC 2022 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Add patch to fix sgdisk with popt 1.19:
  * 0001-Fix-failure-crash-of-sgdisk-when-compiled-with-lates.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 27 11:58:11 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.0.9
  * Added support for aligning partitions' end points, as well as
    their start points. This support affects the default
    partition size when using 'n' in gdisk; it affects the
    default partition size in cgdisk; and it is activated by the
    new `-I` option in sgdisk.
  * Added check for too-small disks (most likely to be an issue
    when trying to use a too-small disk image); program now
    aborts if this happens.
  * Added new parition type codes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 10 08:23:55 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 1.0.8
  * Fixed double byte swap operation on writes of partition name data on
    big-endian systems; this is in addition to the double byte swap fix on
    reading partition label data fixed in 1.0.7. (Thanks to Erik Larsson for
    both fixes.)
  * Added feature to gdisk and sgdisk to enable swapping the byte order of
    partition names, so as to correct disks already affected by the preceding
    bug. This option is 'b' on the experts' menu in gdisk and
    -b/--byte-swap-name in sgdisk. This seems advanced/obscure enough that I
    don't want to clutter cgdisk's menu with this option, so I haven't added
    it there.
  * Added type code for the Barebox boot loader (0xbb00;
    4778ED65-BF42-45FA-9C5B-287A1DC4AAB1).
  * Fixed bug that caused spurious warnings about the partition table
    header claiming an invalid size of partition entries when reading
    some MBR disks.
  * Added ARM64 as an architecture for the Mac builds of gdisk and fixparts.
    The official GPT fdisk binaries of these files for macOS are now
    "universal" x86-64/ARM64 binaries, so they will run natively on the new M1
    (ARM64) Macs. The sgdisk and cgdisk binaries, though, remain built only
    for x86-64, because they rely on libraries that are not easily built in
    "universal" form.
  * Fixed double byte swap operation on partition label data on big-endian
    CPUs. This resulted in partition names becoming gibberish on such CPUs.
  * Added three new type codes:
    - 0x0701 - Microsoft Storage Replica
    - 0x0702 - ArcaOS Type 1
    - 0x8401 - Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) block device
- Drop fix-spurious-warnings.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 16 00:22:32 UTC 2021 - Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>

- fix regression from version 1.0.6: misleading warning when reading MBR disks,
    upstream commit f063fe08e424c99f133df18bf9dce49c851bcb0a 
- Add fix-spurious-warnings.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  9 22:56:48 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.6
  * Fixed bug that could cause segfault if GPT header claimed partition
    entries are oversized. See:
    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0256
  * Fixed bug that could cause a crash if a badly-formatted MBR disk was
    read. See:
    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0308
  * Renamed the partition type "Freedesktop $BOOT" to "XBOOTLDR partition".
  * Added several more Freedesktop partition table type codes (0x8312 through
    0x831C).
  * Fixed type code definition in diskio-unix.cc that prevented 32-bit builds
    from correctly handling disks over 4 TiB in size.
  * Minor tweaks to get the software to compile on FreeBSD; that seems to have
    fallen into disrepair.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 15:29:53 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Remove old specfile constructs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 26 14:54:40 UTC 2020 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.5
  * Changed number of columns in type code output ("sgdisk -L"
    and equivalents in gdisk and cgdisk) from 3 to 2, since some
    descriptions are long enough that they are ambiguous with
    three columns.
  * You can now put the 0xEE partition last in a hybrid MBR using
    sgdisk. (Previously, this was possible with gdisk but not
    with sgdisk.) See the sgdisk man page for details.
  * Added numerous type codes for Container Linux, Veracrypt, and
    Freedesktop.org's Discoverable Partitions Specification
  * Partition type name searches are now case-insensitive.
  * It is now possible to quit out of partition type name
    searches by typing "q".
  * When changing a partition type code, the default is now the
    current type code, not a platform-specific type code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 24 04:20:34 UTC 2018 - sean@suspend.net

- Update to 1.0.4
  * 74 new type codes added
  * Search/filter function to the type code list
  * GPT fdisk now reports more details about data structures
  * Misc bug fixes

  Remove duplicated documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  4 10:19:25 UTC 2014 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.10
 * Bug fix of previous version: The hybrid MBR creation code in
   gdisk would ignore the second and third partitions to be
   hybridized.
 * Fix bug that could cause incorrect partition end points to be
   set on hybridized partitions that spanned the 2^32-sector mark
   on disks.
 * Finally, this version enables the use of 0 as a value for a
   partition number to the -A/--attributes, -c/--change-name,
   -t/--typecode, and -u/--partition-guid commands if an earlier
   -n/--new option created a new partition; in this case, 0 refers
   to that newly-created partition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 25 14:40:22 UTC 2014 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.9
 * Three new type codes.
 * The verify (v) function now checks for MBR partitions (the 0xEE
   protective partitions or hybrid MBR partitions) that don't fit
   on the disk.
 * The GPT-destruction options (z in gdisk, -z and -Z in sgdisk)
   now wipe out the final few sectors on the disk rather than
   wherever the backup GPT data are recorded as being. This is done
   to prevent wiping out data mid-disk, which can otherwise happen
   if a RAID array is resized in certain ways and the GPT data are
   not moved prior to wiping the GPT data.
 * The FixParts program had developed a bug in which it complained
   that the 0xEE partition didn't begin on sector 1; this version
   fixes that bug.
 * Finally, this version removes the dependency on libicu for UTF-16
   support in partition names.
- remove obsolete libicu dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 13 13:18:19 UTC 2013 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.8
  * Fixed bug that could cause segfault when passing an invalid
    partition number to sgdisk's -i/--info command.
  * Added new partition type codes.
  * Added a pause (with a prompt to hit <Enter>) to display more
    items gdisk and cgdisk. There's no such pause/prompt in sgdisk,
    though.
  * Fine-tuned verification ('v') check for 0xEE partition that
    doesn't begin on sector 1.
  * Fixed hybrid MBR creation on disks larger than 2TiB
  * Added check for an active/bootable 0xEE protective partition to
    the verify ('v') function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 22:18:09 UTC 2013 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.7
  * Small improvements and bug fixes mark this revision.
  * Three new partition type codes have been added:
    freedesktop.org's proposed $BOOT partition (type code EA00),
    the Intel Rapid Start partition (code 8400),
    and for Haiku's BFS (code EB00).
  * Removed a stray debug message that appeared when reading MBR
    disks.
  * The "converting MBR to GPT" message has been modified to
    clarify that changes are being held in memory.
  * The Mac version now works on /dev/rdisk* devices as well as
    /dev/disk* devices.
  * When used with /dev/rdisk* devices, the partition table can
    sometimes be re-read without rebooting or unplugging and
    re-inserting the disk.
  * Finally, cgdisk now supports a -a option, which works similarly
    to the -a option in cfdisk.
