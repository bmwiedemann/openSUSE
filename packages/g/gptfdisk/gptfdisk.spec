%description
Partitioning software for GPT disks and to repair MBR disks. The
gdisk, cgdisk, and sgdisk utilities (in the gdisk package) are
GPT-enabled partitioning tools; the fixparts utility (in the fixparts
package) fixes some problems with MBR disks that can be created by
buggy partitioning software.

%package fixparts
Summary:        A tool for repairing certain types of damage to MBR disks
Group:          System/Base

%description fixparts
A program that corrects errors that can creep into MBR-partitioned
disks. Removes stray GPT data, fixes mis-sized extended partitions,
and enables changing primary vs. logical partition status. Also
provides a few additional partition manipulation features.
