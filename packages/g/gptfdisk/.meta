  <title>GPT partitioning and MBR repair software</title>
  <description>Partitioning software for GPT disks and to repair MBR
disks. The gdisk and sgdisk utilities (in the gdisk
package) are GPT-enabled partitioning tools; the
fixparts utility (in the fixparts package) fixes some
problems with MBR disks that can be created by buggy
partitioning software.
