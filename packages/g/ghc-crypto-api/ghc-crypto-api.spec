%description
A generic interface for cryptographic operations (hashes, ciphers, randomness).
Maintainers of hash and cipher implementations are encouraged to add instances
for the classes defined in Crypto.Classes. Crypto users are similarly
encouraged to use the interfaces defined in the Classes module. Any concepts or
functions of general use to more than one cryptographic algorithm (ex: padding)
is within scope of this package.
