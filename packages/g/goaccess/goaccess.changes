    module. e.g., Request A was visited by IP1, IP2, IP3, etc.
  * Restyled HTML output.

  * Added excluded IP hits count to the general statistics panel on all reports.
  * Added HTTP nonstandard code '444' to the status code list.
  * Added the ability to count client errors (4xx) to the unique visitors count.
    Now by default it omits client errors (4xx) from being added to the unique
    visitors count as they are probably not welcomed visitors. 4xx errors are
    always counted in panels other than visitors, OS & browsers.
    `--4xx-to-unique-count`
  * Removed request status field restriction. This allows parsing logs that contain
    only a valid date, IPv4/6 and host.
  * Fixed issue when excluding IPv4/v6 ranges.
  * Fixed compile error due to missing include <sys/types.h> for type off_t
    (gcc 4.1).

    e.g., Jul 15 20:13:59 (syslog format).
  * Added a variety of browsers, game systems, feed readers, and podcasts.
  * Added a '-V --version' command line option.
  * Added missing up/down arrows to the help section.
  * Added the ability to ignore crawlers using the '--ignore-crawlers' option.
  * Added the ability to ignore multiple IPv4/v6 and IP ranges.
  * Added the PATCH method according to RFC 5789.
  * Fixed GeoLocation percent issue for the JSON, CSV and HTML outputs.
  * Fixed memory leak when excluding one or multiple IPs.

- Changes to GoAccess 0.8.1 - Monday, June 16, 2014

  * Added ability to add/remove static files by extension through the config
    file.
  * Added ability to print backtrace on segmentation fault.
  * Escaped JSON strings correctly according to [RFC4627].
  * Fixed encoding issue when extracting keyphrases for some HTTP referers.
  * Fixed issue where HTML bar graphs were not shown due to numeric locale.
  * Fixed issue with URIs containing "\r?\n" thus breaking the corresponding
    output.
  * Make sure request string is URL decoded on all outputs.

- Changes to GoAccess 0.8 - Tuesday, May 20, 2014

  * Added APT-HTTP to the list of browsers.
  * Added data persistence and ability to load data from disk.
  * Added IE11 to the list of browsers.
  * Added IEMobile to the list of browsers.
  * Added multiple command line options.
  * Added Nagios check_http to the list of browsers.
  * Added parsing progress metrics - total requests / requests per second.
  * Added the ability to parse a GeoLiteCity.dat to get the city given an IPv4.
  * Change the way the configuration file is parsed. This will parse all
    configuration options under ~/.goaccessrc or the specified config file and will
    feed getopt_long with the extracted key/value pairs. This also allows the
    ability to have comments on the config file which won't be overwritten.
  * Ensure autoconf determines the location of ncurses headers.
  * Fixed issue where geo_location_data was NULL.
  * Fixed issue where GoAccess did not run without a tty allocated to it.
  * Fixed potential memory leak on --log-file realpath().
  * Fixed Solaris build errors.
  * Implemented an on-memory hash database using Tokyo Cabinet. This implementation
    allows GoAccess not to rely on GLib's hash table if one is needed.
  * Implemented large file support using an on-disk B+ Tree database. This
    implementation allows GoAccess not to hold everything in memory but instead it
    uses an on-disk B+ Tree database.
  * Trimmed leading and trailing whitespaces from keyphrases module.

- Changes to GoAccess 0.7.1 - Monday, February 17, 2014

  * Added missing Win 9x 4.90 (Windows Me) user-agent.
  * Added missing Windows RT user-agent.
  * Ensure mouse click does not reset expanded module if it is the same.
  * Fixed Amazon CloudFront tab-separated log format.
  * Fixed "FreeBSD style" ncursesw built into system.
  * Fixed HTML report issue where data cell would not wrap.
  * Fixed issue when isatty() could not find a valid file descriptor.
  * Fixed SymbianOS user-agent and retrieve its version.
