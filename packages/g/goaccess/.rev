    <comment>- Remove filler wording from description.
- Use %license instead of %doc
- Remove wrongly added v1.2.tar.gz
- Clean up spec file
- Update to 1.2:
  *  Added a Dockerfile.
  *  Added a replacement for GNU getline() to dynamically expand line buffer
     while  maintaining real-time output.
  *  Added --daemonize command line option to run GoAccess as daemon.
  *  Added several improvements to the HTML report on small-screen devices.
  *  Added option to the HTML report to auto-hide tables on small-screen
  *  Added --process-and-exit command line option to parse log and exit.
  *  Added several feed readers to the list of browsers.
  *  Added &quot;-&quot; single dash per convention to read from the standard input.
  *  Added support for MaxMind GeoIP2.
  *  Added the ability to read and follow from a pipe such as
     &quot;tail -f access.log | goaccess -&quot;
  *  Added time unit (seconds) to the processed time label in the HTML/terminal
  *  Added visitors' percent column to the terminal dashboard.
  *  Changed D3 charts to dim Y-axis on mouseover.
  *  Changed D3 charts to reflect HTML column sort.
  *  Changed D3 charts to render only if within the viewport. This improves the
     real-time HTML performance.
  *  Changed HTML report tables to render only if within the viewport.
  *  Changed percentage calculation to be based on the total within each panel.
  *  Ensure start/end dates are updated real-time in the HTML output.
  *  Ensure &quot;window.location.hostname&quot; is used as the default WS server host.
  *  most cases, this should avoid the need for specifying &quot;--ws-url=host&quot;.
  *  using &quot;--real-time-html&quot; should suffice.
  *  Fixed issue on HTML report to avoid outputting scientific notation for all
  *  sizes.
  *  Fixed integer overflow when calculating bar graph length on terminal.
  *  Fixed issue where global config file would override command line arguments.
  *  Fixed issue where it wouldn't allow loading from disk without specifying a
  *  when executed from the cron.
  *  Fixed issue where parser couldn't read some X-Forwarded-For (XFF) formats.
     that this breaks compatibility with the original implementation of
     XFF, but at the same time it gives much more flexibility on different.
  *  Fixed issue where specifying fifo-in/out wouldn't allow HTML real-time
  *  Fixed issue where the wrong number of parsed lines upon erroring out was
  *  Fixed issue where the WebSocket server prevented to establish a connection
     a client due to invalid UTF-8 sequences.
  *  Fixed percent issue when calculating visitors field.
  *  Updated the list of crawlers.
- update to 0.9
  * Added ability to double decode an HTTP referer and agent.
  * Added ability to sort views through the command line on initial load.
  * Added additional data values to the backtrace report.
  * Added additional graph to represent the visitors metric on the HTML output.
  * Added AM_PROG_CC_C_O to configure.ac
  * Added 'Android Lollipop' to the list of operating systems.
  * Added 'average time served' metric to all panels.
  * Added 'bandwidth' metric to all panels.
  * Added command line option to disable summary metrics on the CSV output.
  * Added numeric formatting to the HTML output to improve readability.
  * Added request method specifier to the default W3C log format.
  * Added support for GeoIP Country IPv6 and GeoIP City IPv6 through --geoip-database.
  * Added the ability to ignore parsing and displaying given panel(s).
  * Added the ability to ignore referer sites from being counted.
    A good case scenario is to ignore own domains. i.e., owndomain.tld
    This also allows ignoring hosts using wildcards.
    For instance, *.mydomain.tld or www.mydomain.* or www?.mydomain.tld
  * Added time/hour distribution module. e.g., 00-23.
  * Added 'visitors' metrics to all panels.
  * Added Windows 10 (v6.4) to the real windows user agents.
  * Changed AC_PREREQ macro version so it builds on old versions of autoconf.
  * Changed GEOIP database load to GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE for faster lookups.
  * Changed maximum number of choices to display per panel to 366 fron 300.
  * Ensure config file is read from home dir if unable to open it from %sysconfdir% path.
  * Fixed array overflows when exceeding MAX_* limits on command line options.
  * Fixed a SEGFAULT where sscanf could not handle special chars within the referer.
  * Fixed character encoding on geolocation output (ISO-8859 to UTF8).
  * Fixed issue on wild cards containing '?' at the end of the string.
  * Fixed issue where a 'Nothing valid to process' error was triggered when the
    number of invalid hits was equal to the number of valid hits.
  * Fixed issue where outputting to a file left a zero-byte file in pwd.
  * Improved parsing of operating systems.
  * Refactored log parser so it allows with ease the addition of new modules. This
    also attempts to decouple the core functionality from the rendering functions.
    It also gives the flexibility to add children metrics to root metrics for any
    module. e.g., Request A was visited by IP1, IP2, IP3, etc.
  * Restyled HTML output.
- Changes to GoAccess 0.8.5 - Sunday, September 14, 2014
  * Fixed SEGFAULT when parsing a malformed request that doesn't have HTTP status.
- Changes to GoAccess 0.8.4 - Monday, September 08, 2014
  * Added ability to handle nginx non-standard status code 444 as 404.
    `--444-as-404`
  * Added and updated operating systems, and browsers.
  * Added excluded IP hits count to the general statistics panel on all reports.
  * Added HTTP nonstandard code '444' to the status code list.
  * Added the ability to count client errors (4xx) to the unique visitors count.
    Now by default it omits client errors (4xx) from being added to the unique
    visitors count as they are probably not welcomed visitors. 4xx errors are
    always counted in panels other than visitors, OS &amp; browsers.
    `--4xx-to-unique-count`
  * Removed request status field restriction. This allows parsing logs that contain
    only a valid date, IPv4/6 and host.
  * Fixed issue when excluding IPv4/v6 ranges.
  * Fixed compile error due to missing include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; for type off_t
    (gcc 4.1).

  * Fixed Steam detection.
  * Added Huawei to the browser's list and removed it from the OS's list.
- Changes to GoAccess 0.8.2 - Monday, July 20, 2014
  * Added ability to parse dates containing whitespaces in between,
    e.g., Jul 15 20:13:59 (syslog format).
  * Added a variety of browsers, game systems, feed readers, and podcasts.
  * Added a '-V --version' command line option.
  * Added missing up/down arrows to the help section.

  * Added ability to add/remove static files by extension through the config
    file.
  * Added ability to print backtrace on segmentation fault.

  * Fixed encoding issue when extracting keyphrases for some HTTP referers.
  * Fixed issue where HTML bar graphs were not shown due to numeric locale.
  * Fixed issue with URIs containing &quot;\r?\n&quot; thus breaking the corresponding
    output.
  * Make sure request string is URL decoded on all outputs.
- Changes to GoAccess 0.8 - Tuesday, May 20, 2014
  * Added APT-HTTP to the list of browsers.

  * Added parsing progress metrics - total requests / requests per second.
  * Added the ability to parse a GeoLiteCity.dat to get the city given an IPv4.
  * Change the way the configuration file is parsed. This will parse all
    configuration options under ~/.goaccessrc or the specified config file and will
    feed getopt_long with the extracted key/value pairs. This also allows the
    ability to have comments on the config file which won't be overwritten.
  * Ensure autoconf determines the location of ncurses headers.
  * Fixed issue where geo_location_data was NULL.
  * Fixed issue where GoAccess did not run without a tty allocated to it.
  * Fixed potential memory leak on --log-file realpath().
  * Fixed Solaris build errors.
  * Implemented an on-memory hash database using Tokyo Cabinet. This implementation
    allows GoAccess not to rely on GLib's hash table if one is needed.
  * Implemented large file support using an on-disk B+ Tree database. This
    implementation allows GoAccess not to hold everything in memory but instead it
    uses an on-disk B+ Tree database.
  * Trimmed leading and trailing whitespaces from keyphrases module.
