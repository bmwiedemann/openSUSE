Subject: [PATCH] loader/arm64/efi/linux: Remove magic number header field
 check

The "ARM\x64" magic number in the file header identifies an image as one
that implements the bare metal boot protocol, allowing the loader to
simply move the file to a suitably aligned address in memory, with
sufficient headroom for the trailing .bss segment (the required memory
size is described in the header as well).

Note of this matters for GRUB, as it only supports EFI boot. EFI does
not care about this magic number, and nor should GRUB: this prevents us
from booting other PE linux images, such as the generic EFI zboot
decompressor, which is a pure PE/COFF image, and does not implement the
bare metal boot protocol.

So drop the magic number check.
