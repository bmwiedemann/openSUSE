Subject: [PATCH] grub-install: force journal draining to ensure data integrity

In XFS, the system would end up in unbootable state if an abrupt power
off after grub-install is occuring. It can be easily reproduced with.

  grub-install /dev/vda; reboot -f

The grub error would show many different kinds of corruption in
filesystem and the problem boils down to incompleted journal transaction
which would leave pending writes behind in the on-disk journal. It is
therefore necessary to recover the system via re-mounting the filesystem
from linux system that all pending journal log can be replayed.

On the other hand if journal draining can be enforced by grub-install
then it can bring more resilience to such abrupt power loss. The fsync
is not enough here for XFS, because that only writes in-memory log to
on-disk (ie makes sure broken state can be repaired). Unfortunately
there's no designated system call to serve solely for the journal
draining, so it can only be achieved via fsfreeze system call that the
journal draining can happen as a byproduct during the process.

This patch adds fsfreeze/unfreeze at the end of grub-install to induce
journal draining on journaled file system. However btrfs is excluded
from the list as it is using fsync to drain journal and also is not
desired as reportedly having negative side effect. With this patch
applied, the boot falilure can no longer be reproduced with above
procedure.

v2:
Fix boot failure after kdump due to the content of grub.cfg is not
completed with pending modificaton in xfs journal (bsc#1186975)
