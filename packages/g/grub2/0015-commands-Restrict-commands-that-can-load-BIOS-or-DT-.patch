Subject: [PATCH 15/46] commands: Restrict commands that can load BIOS or DT
 blobs when locked down

There are some more commands that should be restricted when the GRUB is
locked down. Following is the list of commands and reasons to restrict:

  * fakebios:   creates BIOS-like structures for backward compatibility with
                existing OSes. This should not be allowed when locked down.

  * loadbios:   reads a BIOS dump from storage and loads it. This action
                should not be allowed when locked down.

  * devicetree: loads a Device Tree blob and passes it to the OS. It replaces
                any Device Tree provided by the firmware. This also should
                not be allowed when locked down.
