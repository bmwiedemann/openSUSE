Subject: [PATCH 22/32] net/tftp: Avoid a trivial UAF

Under tftp errors, we print a tftp error message from the tftp header.
However, the tftph pointer is a pointer inside nb, the netbuff. Previously,
we were freeing the nb and then dereferencing it. Don't do that, use it
and then free it later.

This isn't really _bad_ per se, especially as we're single-threaded, but
it trips up fuzzers.
