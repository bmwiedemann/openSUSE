Subject: [PATCH 09/11] x86-efi: Reduce maximum bounce buffer size to 16 MiB

The EFI linux loader allocates a bounce buffer to copy the initrd since in
some machines doing DMA on addresses above 4GB is not possible during EFI.

But the verifiers framework also allocates a buffer to copy the initrd in
its grub_file_open() handler. It does this since the data to verify has to
be passed as a single chunk to modules that use the verifiers framework.

If the initrd image size is big there may not be enough memory in the heap
to allocate two buffers of that size. This causes an allocation failure in
the verifiers framework and leads to the initrd not being read.

To prevent these allocation failures, let's reduce the maximum size of the
bounce buffer used in the EFI loader. Since the data read can be copied to
the actual initrd address in multilple chunks.

Resolves: rhbz#1838633
