Subject: [PATCH] grub-mkconfig: restore umask for grub.cfg

Since commit:

  ab2e53c8a grub-mkconfig: Honor a symlink when generating configuration
by grub-mkconfig

has inadvertently discarded umask for creating grub.cfg in the process
of grub-mkconfig. The resulting wrong permission (0644) would allow
unprivileged users to read grub's configuration file content. This
presents a low confidentiality risk as grub.cfg may contain non-secured
plain-text passwords.

This patch restores the missing umask and set the file mode of creation
to 0600 preventing unprivileged access.

Fixes: CVE-2021-3981
