- Update to version 1.3.3
  * Update to Normaliz 3.9.3
  * Improve build system to honor CPPFLAGS environment variable
  * Explicitly set a so-called "run path" / "rpath" when linking
    against the bundled copy of Normaliz (improves compatibility
    with future versions of the GAP compiler `gac`, which will

    coordinates
  * Update build system for improve compatibility with GAP >= 4.9
  * Completely rewrote build-normaliz.sh (now downloads a tarball
    using curl or wget, instead of cloning a git repository)
  * Fix a potential crash when freeing proxy cone objects
  * Fix 'unknown cone property' that could occur when using newer
    versions of Normaliz, e.g. version 3.5.4
  * Display the Normaliz version as part of banner string

* fix crash when using StructuralCopy on a cone (issue #38)
* fix printing of certain integers on 32bit systems (issue #36)
* give better diagnostics when loading NormalizInterface fails due
  to its kernel extension missing
