# HPC allows simultaneous installation of multiple versions of the same
# library even with the same so-name. These are provided in non-system
# directories which are not handled by entries to /etc/ld.so.conf but
# by the well known concept of environment modules which allow users
# to customize their runtime library stack per session.
# Therefore, the package version, not the so version is used for
# package names.
