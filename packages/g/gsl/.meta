  <title>GNU Scientific Library</title>
  <description>The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
numerical computing. The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
team in ANSI C and present a modern Applications Programming Interface
(API) for C programmers, while allowing wrappers to be written for very
high level languages.

The library covers the following areas:

Complex Numbers 	  Roots of Polynomials	 Special Functions
Vectors and Matrices	  Permutations		 Sorting BLAS Support  
	   Linear Algebra	  Eigensystems Fast Fourier Transforms 
 Quadrature		Random Numbers Quasi-Random Sequences	 Random
Distributions	Statistics Histograms		     N-Tuples	       
    Monte Carlo Integration Simulated Annealing       Differential
Equations Interpolation Numerical Differentiation Chebyshev	       
 Series Acceleration Approximation Discrete Hankel	    
Root-Finding	       Minimization Transforms Least-Squares Fitting   
 Physical Constants	IEEE Floating-Point</description>
