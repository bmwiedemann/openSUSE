-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  9 17:44:39 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.4.16:
  + Buffer:
    - Swapped behavior of cubic interpolation from cubic to
      mithcell coefficients, leading to crisper results in all uses
      of the cubic sampler.
    - Use a custom allocator for tile data which aligns data and
      groups allocations in blocks - improving performance on
      windows by keeping more slack allocation memory in-process.
      On linux the opposite was needed and is achieved by using the
      GNU extension malloc_trim which permits forcing invokation of
      the glibc malloc/free allocators garbage collection function.
    - Permit tiles to be unreffed after GEGL shut-down without
      crash, which is likely when using bindings to dynamic
      languages.
    - Improved deadlock prevention in gegl_buffer_copy() when using
      copy on write.
  + Core:
    - Platform specific build fixes for both win32 and OSX.
    - Avoid in-place processing for cached nodes.
    - Indentation consitency improvements.
    - Permit more detailed specifying/overriding of OpenCL device
      through the GEGL_USE_OPENCL environment variable.
    - New call gegl_update_anim_time for applying the animation
      curves of properties.
  + Build: Added gitlab continuous integration.
  + Operations:
    - Use indirect buffer inputs on main thread during
      multi-processed processing for point-filters/composers and
      tranform base classes.
    - Smaller required/invalided ROI for map-absolute/relative when
      using nearest neighbor.
    - tiff-save and jpg-save fixed dimensions when buffer saved has
      non-zero origin.
    - Added missing descriptions of properties for cubism, mosaic,
      tile-paper, color, mantiuk06 and vignette operations.
    - ff-load fix some of the deprecation warnings.
    - ff-save avoid crashing if audio or video codec fails to
      initialize.
    - cache, parent class changed - it is no longer a point
      operations, also speed up processing and permit copy on write
      handling of tiles.
    - opacity and invert - crash for 8bpc buffers, reimplemented
      logic for (non-)associated alpha OpenCL kernel selection.
  + Tools: Drop direct dependency on exiv2 - we now only
    transiently depend on it through the gexiv2 abstraction.
  + commandline tool/gui:
    - Store per image editing chains in .gegl folder instead of
      sidecars.
    - Set window title, permit interaction with opened .lui
      documents, fixed playback of audio for opened videos - it now
      works; if the video is decoding, scaling and display is fast
      enough to leave spare cycles.
    - Support for nearest neighbor scaling of imagry; aiding video
      playback without dropping audio frames.
    - Custom collection order and per-file key-value metadata.
- Drop explicit pkgconfig(exiv2) BuildRequires following upstream
  changes.

    - Handle mipmap rendering for linear-gradient and
      radial-gradient.
  + UI:
    - The existing microraptor-gui (immediate mode touch UI+CSS
      with cairo) image viewer that can be built as part of the
      gegl binary has been revisted, a graph/property editor has
      been added, and migration/extension to lua has begun for
      parts of the code.
    - WARNING: many parts of the UI is of exploratory proof of
      concept/alpha quality but are released since the code is part
      of the GEGL repository and important development tools both
      for creating and testing new GEGL operations as well as GEGL
      itself.

Thu Aug 23 20:46:55 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.4.8:
  + Core/GeglBuffer: Fixes to races during buffer/tile storage
    destruction, improve swap usage for stored empty tiles.
   + Operations
     - motion-blur-circular - improve/clarify property ui
     - median-blur          - added abyss-policy property
     - long-shadow          - new operation
     - little-planet        - adapt reference composition
- Changes from version 0.4.6:
  + Up until now GEGL has been using a color space corresponding to
    scRGB as an unbounded device independent/possibly
    scene-referred HDR color space - with a similar approach to to
    how ACEScg works but with a worse set of RGB primaries. babl
    formats, represented by a pointer and a corresponding
    encoding/format string have been used to specify the specific
    encoding of pixel values. The encoding including component
    order, data type and TRC encoding. Where "RGBA float" means
    32bit float data and "R'G'B' u8" the ' indicates non-linear,
    and thus this is sRGB. "RaGaBaA half" gives premultiplied
    linear half data. Other encodings and conversions are also
    provided through these formats including "CIE Lab float" and
    "HSV float".
  + As a color management workflow for scene-referred imaging the
    above could be sufficient, but GIMP needs data in the 0.0-1.0
    range for some display referred blending modes to work
    properly. As a consequence of this recognized short-coming GIMP
    has been passing the pixels of for instance ProPhoto "R'G'B'A
    float" off as "R'G'B'A float" and linear ProPhoto "RGBA float"
    as "RGBA float" this works for single operations, but falls
    apart when the colors are converted to CIE Lab. This is the
    good enough state where the other benefits of having a stable
    release powered by GEGL outweighed not being entirely correct.
  + Since babl 0.1.32 of october 2017, all babl formats have an
    associated unchangable space associated with them, and since
    then GeglBuffer has worked correctly with it - since
    GeglBuffers use of babl API did not change. GIMP is already
    using these parts of babl for ICC matrix based conversions
    since using babl for ICC profile transforms is an order of
    magnitude faster than using the lcms2 library. It took time to
    come up with the above scheme of integrating arbitrary
    primaries and curves for spaces with babl in a maintainable
    manner, and it has taken until the last month to come up with a
    full plan for the rest of GEGL to be aware of and handling
    arbirary parametric ICC v2/v4 based color spaces for
    operations; without limiting the ability to extend and use the
    code for a wide range of scenarios.
  + A space can be constructed from a preferenced
    name/specification, loaded/saved from ICC matrix profiles or
    constructed and serialized to whitepoint + rgb chromaticities /
    xyz matrix. More recently an additional trc mark has been added
    '~', giving this vocabulary for RGB formats, in addition to
    variants with alpha and pre-multiplied alpha variants of the
    same:
    - "RGB"     linear      primaries from space, linear data
    - "R'G'B'"  non-linear  primaries from space, TRCs from space
    - "R~G~B~"  perceptual  primaries from space, sRGB TRC
  + When creating device independent CIE based spaces they also get
    passed a space, this means that we can convert CIE Lab to RGB
    float, keeping track of which space / ICC profile the data
    correspond to.
  + GEGL operations now construct their desired encodings of
    formats by taking the space of buffers on input pads into
    account. By default, for composers "input" wins over "aux" to
    determine ops space. If an operation is not ported, data will
    be converted to sRGB on input and sRGB will come out of the
    node.
  + Buffer loaders PNG, JPG, TIFF and EXR generate custom spaces
    based on ICC profiles/primaries. The corresponding savers saves
    color space information. A new save handler for the .icc
    extension, acts like an image storer but only saves the ICC
    profile of the buffer it gets on input.
  + With no additional operations inserted, this now means that
    GEGL graphs operate on linear / non-linear variants of the
    color space used in the input images without conversion. The
    new operations gegl:cast-space and gegl:convert-space provide
    means of overriding this behavior, see the new section about
    color management in the gegl-chain syntax documentation at
    http://gegl.org/gegl-chain.html
  + Initial work has started on making GIMP also use of and
    propagate color space information along with encoding in babl
    formats, changes which also will be integrated in the 2.10
    branch.
  + Other changes to operations: vignette: fixes to gamma property
  + New operations:
    - cast-space: assign/override color space
    - convert-space: convert to a different color space
    - litte-planet: stereographic-mapping split out of the
      panorama-projection
  + New operation in workshop: acrs-rrt: ACES RRT based HDR to SDR
    proof/preview point-filter tonemapping op.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  5 11:01:31 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.4.4:
  + Core:
    - Point filters with need for format conversion of input are
      now parallel.
    - Added swap-reading, swap-writing, swap-read-total and
      swap-write-total properties to GeglStats.
  + Buffer:
    - Trim tile-cache when shrinking.
    - Added reading locks to tiles further improving concurrent
      access tolerance of GeglBuffer.
  + Operations:
    - threshold: operating format changed from linear to
      perceptual.
    - unsharp-mask: add rename standard-deviation and scale
      properties to 'Radius' and 'Amount', add 'Threshold'
      property.
    - recursive-transform now supports applying multiple
      transformations simultanously.
    - Fixed integer overflow due to logic error in pixelize.
    - New operation: gegl:abs which negates negative values.
    - New operation in workshop: selective-hue-saturation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 16 18:12:54 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.4.2:
  + Build: Abort early if autoreconf fails, remove unused bits,

      caches. Improve cache invalidation during partial mipmap
      regeneration.
    - Do new cheap clones of buffers with new internal gegl-buffer
      backed tile-backend.
    - Do not keep cached sampler in buffer it makes cache
      invalidation hard, and for performance/threading it is better
      to create ones own samplers anyways. The old API still
      exists, though parts of it is now deprecated. The single
      special case where gegl_buffer_sample remains somewhat
      performant is with the NEAREST sampler, for all other
      samplers creating a caching sampler is better.
  + Operations:
    - operation: add GeglOperationAreaFilter::get_abyss_policy()
      vfunc Copyright notice improvements to spherize,
      color-overlay.  ff-save: implement defines handling
      compilation with ffmpeg 2.3-2.7, 4.0 compat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 27 18:11:11 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.4.0:
  + GEGL 0.4.x is a stable release series of GEGL to have a stable
    API and ABI to go with GIMP-2.10. When the need arises to break
    API or ABI compatibility the 0.4.x series will get its own
    branch and unstable API experiments and development, 0.5.x will
    happen in master. For now though master will track the 0.4.x
    series.
  + Core: Change GeglParamSpecSeed from int to uint to match the
    value range of GeglRandom's seed.
  + Operations:
    - Ripple fixed remaining issues needed to remove legacy GIMP

  + Core: Change GeglParamSpecSeed from int to uint to match the
    value range of GeglRandom's seed.
  + Operations: Limit allocations in ppm-load to 2GB
    (CVE-2018-10114).
- Changes from version 0.3.32:
  + Operations:
    - panorama-projection: added reverse transform, which permits

      gaze directions in equirectangular, also known as 360x180
      panoramas.
    - Added abyss-policy to base class for scale ops, making it
      possible to achieve hard edges on rescaled buffers.

  + GeglBuffer:
    - gegl_buffer_get now treats the final argument;
    - All scaling is now done on linear data, making future results
      of mipmap computations more valid as well as providing
      correct results for scaled down thumbnails in user
      interfaces;
    - The scaling code paths has also been instrumented and
      optimized for performance;
    - Improvements to logic switching to boxfiltering behavior and
      improve cubic samplers box filtering by using a linear
      sampler and a nearest sampler for the boxfiltering for the
      linear sampler;
    - gegl_buffer_copy gegl_buffer_clear and gegl_buffer_set color
      now only emit a single changed signal on the buffer.
  + Operations:
    - c2g and stress have gained the ability to toggle the
      influence of the shadow neighborhood or not, the new default
      is to not improve shadow detail; yielding a bit more natural
      renditions;
    - color-to-alpha now contains improvements from experiment
      in workshop which is gone;
    - Fixed crashes in median-blur.

Mon Jul 20 13:24:19 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.1.0:
  + Renamed gegl:load-buffer to gegl:buffer-source and
    gegl:save-buffer to gegl:buffer-sink (but the old names still
    work)
   + Represent colors using doubles instead of floats (this change
