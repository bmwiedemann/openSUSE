%description
Provides functions available in later versions of 'base' to a wider range of
compilers, without requiring you to use CPP pragmas in your code. See the
<https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-compat/blob/master/base-compat/README.markdown
README> for what is covered. Also see the
<https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-compat/blob/master/base-compat/CHANGES.markdown
changelog> for recent changes.

Note that 'base-compat' does not add any orphan instances. There is a separate
package, '<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-orphans base-orphans>', for
that.

In addition, 'base-compat' does not backport any data types or type classes.
See
'<https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-compat/blob/master/base-compat/README.markdown#data-types-and-type-classes
this section of the README>' for more info.

'base-compat' is designed to have zero dependencies. For a version of
'base-compat' that depends on compatibility libraries for a wider support
window, see the '<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-compat-batteries
base-compat-batteries>' package. Most of the modules in this library have the
same names as in 'base-compat-batteries' to make it easier to switch between
the two. There also exist versions of each module with the suffix '.Repl',
which are distinct from anything in 'base-compat-batteries', to allow for
easier use in GHCi.
