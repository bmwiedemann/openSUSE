- Add workaround-cargo-bug.patch -- There is currently a bug with cargo
  in which `cargo metadata` returns 
  See gh#rust-secure-code/cargo-auditable#124
- Update to version 0.41.0:
  * add gix blame -L start,end
  * add gix env to print paths relevant to the Git installation.
  * Document the remaining subcommands
  * Add support for statistics and additional performance
    information.
  * add gix blame to the CLI. That way it's possible to see the
    blame result of any file in the repository.
- Updates from version 0.40.0:
  * add first 'debug' version of gix log. It's primarily meant to
    better understand gix blame.
  * add --tree-favor to gix merge tree|commit. With it one can
    decide which side to favor in case of irreconcilable
    tree-conflicts.

Sat Nov 30 08:29:48 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

  * add new gix cat command.
  * add gix merge-file with similar features as git merge-file
  * gix merge-base for the CLI
  Bug Fixes

Thu Jul 25 03:36:33 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.37.0:
  New Features
  * add mailmap check similar to git check-mailmap. That way it
    becomes a little easier to maybe try out other special cases in
    the wild.
  * gix clone with --ref support. --ref is similar to --branch, but
    was renamed as it also supports tags for example.
  Other
  * Make it easier to compile gitoxide as dynlib. Also optimize
    compilation time: By making plumbing and porcelain as modules
    the lib.rs, they can be compiled after the rmeta for the
    dependencies are generated.
  * For the uni.rs which uses both plumbing and porcelain, this
    would avoid compiling these two modules twice.

  * A maintenance release without user-facing changes, just to
    fix installation

  * gix index entries also prints attributes.
  * gix clone and gix fetch with controls for shallow repositories.
  * ein t trace-path know accepts the trace-file alias.
  * printing to stdout for commands that don't show progress is
    greatly improved. Previously it would have to lock stdout on
    each write, now this is done only once.
  * opening repositories without 'strict' mode also ignores
    IO errors. These will instead be logged, but won't make it
    impossible to open an otherwise fine repository.
  * turn gix free index entries into gix index entries.
- Updates from version 0.23.0:
  * ein tool query - a git analytics engine. A tool to build and
    efficiently maintain a database of information contained in
    a git repository, preferably the kind of information that is
    expensive to obtain, in order to facilitate queries that would
    be prohibitive without an accelerating data structure.
  * gix tree entries with rev-spec support.
- Updates from version 0.22.0:
  * A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

- Chore
    + upgrade to clap 4.1
- New Features
    + gix clone <url> is now permitted without specifying a destination directory.
    + Note that the implementation doesn't take into account potential redirects and renames
    + as it's implemented only with the first URL it sees (not the redirected ones).
    + make more HTTP options available
    + http.schannelCheckRevoke
