%description
Haddock is a documentation-generation tool for Haskell libraries.
These modules expose some functionality of it without pulling in the GHC
dependency. Please note that the API is likely to change so be sure to specify
upper bounds in your projects. For interacting with Haddock itself, see the
[haddock package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock).
