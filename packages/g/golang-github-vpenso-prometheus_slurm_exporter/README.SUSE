The Prometheus Slurm exporter currenly accepts two command line options:
-gpus-acct
    	Enable GPUs accounting
-listen-address string
    	The port to listen on for HTTP requests. (default ":8080")

These can be set by changing the PROMETHEUS_SLURM_EXPORTER_ARGS setting
in /etc/sysconfig/prometheus_slurm_exporter.
