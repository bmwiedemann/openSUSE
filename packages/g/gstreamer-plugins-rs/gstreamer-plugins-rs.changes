Wed Jan 19 14:17:20 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add a BuildRequires: pkgconfig(libwebp) to fix loading
  libgstrswebp.so which was failing with an `undefined symbol:

Wed Nov 10 18:52:14 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Disable csound plugin for now, mask all macros, BuildRequires and
  set option passed to meson to disabled (was auto), wait for
  upstream to fix the issues identified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  2 19:51:56 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Filter out pkgconfig(csound) Requires, add manual csound-devel
  BuildRequires to devel package. csound-devel does not provide a
  .pc file so the autogenerated Requires on pkconfig(csound) is
  wrong.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  2 11:00:09 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Drop baselibs.conf, this is a new package, lets not build 32bit

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 24 13:28:20 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Enable build of dav1d plugin, do this via:
  + Disable LTO via macro.
  + Add clang and pkgconfig(dav1d) BuildRequires.
  + No longer pass dav1d=disabled to meson, nor remove dav1d from
    cargo.toml via sed call.
- Add pkgconfig(libsodium) BuildRequires and pass sodium=system to
  meson, do not use package internal version of sodium.
- Drop pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) BuildRequires, not needed.
- Add pkgconfig(pango) BuildRequires: Mandatory, previously pulled
  in by pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0), and add optional nasm BuildRequires.
- Drop gcc-c++ BuildRequires, no longer needed, nor used.
- Replace llvm-devel with llvm BuildRequires, this is sufficent.
- Do general cleanup of spec, make package ready for submit to TW.
  Use normal meson macros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 24 12:59:22 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>
