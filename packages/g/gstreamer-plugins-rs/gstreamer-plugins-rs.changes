  for Tumbleweed where dav1d 1.3.0 is used and is not supported by
  the dav1d crate used in 0.11.2 by default, so in this manually
  created vendor file, the dav1d 0.10 crate is forced.

- Enable build of dav1d plugin, do this via:
  + Disable LTO via macro.
  + Add clang and pkgconfig(dav1d) BuildRequires.
  + No longer pass dav1d=disabled to meson, nor remove dav1d from
    cargo.toml via sed call.
- Add pkgconfig(libsodium) BuildRequires and pass sodium=system to
  meson, do not use package internal version of sodium.
- Drop pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) BuildRequires, not needed.
- Add pkgconfig(pango) BuildRequires: Mandatory, previously pulled
  in by pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0), and add optional nasm BuildRequires.
- Drop gcc-c++ BuildRequires, no longer needed, nor used.
- Replace llvm-devel with llvm BuildRequires, this is sufficent.
- Do general cleanup of spec, make package ready for submit to TW.
  Use normal meson macros.
