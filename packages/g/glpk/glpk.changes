- updated to 4.31:
        * glpspx.h, glpspx01.c, glpspx02.c, glpapi06.c
        The dual simplex solver (spx_dual_opt) was replaced by a new
        implementation of the two-phase dual simplex method (spx_dual).
        Old simplex method routines (spx_prim_opt, spx_prim_feas, and
        spx_dual_opt) were removed from the package.

        * glpk.h, glpscl.h, glpscl.c, glpapi04.c
        New API routine glp_scale_prob was added. It replaces routine
        lpx_scale_prob which is deprecated.

        * glplib07.c
        16-byte data alignment was added to the module to provide
        compatibility with LP64 environment (8-byte is not sufficient
        due to jmp_buf; thanks to Xypron for investigation).

        * glplpx16.c
        New version of the routine lpx_write_pb was added. Thanks to
        Oscar Gustafsson <oscarg@isy.liu.se> for the contribution.

        * glpspx.h, glpspx03.c, glpapi06.c
        The primal simplex solver (spx_prim_opt, spx_prim_feas) was

        provides the same features as the old version.

        * glpmpl01.c, glpmpl03.c
        Some changes were made in the MathProg translator to allow <,
        <=, >=, and > on comparing symbolic values. Thanks to Heinrich
        Schuchardt <heinrich.schuchardt@gmx.de> for patches.

        * glplpx10.c

        Thanks to Markus Pilz <pilz@cs.uni-bonn.de> for bug report.

        * configure.ac
        The configure script was changed to disable optional features
        by default. For details see file INSTALL.

        * glpipp02.c
        A bug was fixed in the internal routine reduce_bounds. Thanks
        to Anne-Laurence Putz <anne-laurence.putz@eurodecision.com> for
        the bug report.

        * glpapi01.c
        New API routine glp_erase_prob was added.

        * glpapi13.c
        New API routines glp_read_mps and glp_write_mps were added.
        They replace API routines lpx_read_mps, lpx_read_freemps,
