- Update th-abstraction to version 0.7.1.0.
  ## 0.7.1.0 -- 2024.12.05
  * Drop support for pre-8.0 versions of GHC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 15:30:04 UTC 2024 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update th-abstraction to version 0.7.0.0.
  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2024.03.17
  * `DatatypeInfo` now has an additional `datatypeReturnKind` field. Most of the
    time, this will be `StarT`, but this can also be more exotic kinds such as
    `ConT ''UnliftedType` if dealing with primitive types, `UnliftedDatatypes`,
    or `UnliftedNewtypes`.
  * `reifyDatatype` and related functions now support primitive types such as
    `Int#`. These will be reified as `DatatypeInfo`s with no `ConstructorInfo`s
    and with `Datatype` as the `datatypeVariant`.
  * `normalizeCon` now takes a `Kind` argument representing the return kind of
    the parent data type. (This is sometimes necessary to determine which type
    variables in the data constructor are universal or existential, depending
    on if the variables appear in the return kind.)
  * Fix a couple of bugs in which `normalizeDec` would return incorrect results
    for GADTs that use `forall`s in their return kind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 30 12:03:02 UTC 2023 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update th-abstraction to version 0.6.0.0 revision 1.
  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2023.07.31
  * Support building with `template-haskell-2.21.0.0` (GHC 9.8).
  * Adapt to `TyVarBndr`s for type-level declarations changing their type from
    `TyVarBndr ()` to `TyVarBndr BndrVis` in `template-haskell`:

    * `Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr` now backports `type BndrVis = ()`,
      as well as `BndrReq` and `BndrInvis` pattern synonyms. These make it
      possible to write code involving `BndrVis` that is somewhat backwards
      compatible (but do see the caveats in the Haddocks for `BndrInvis`).
    * `Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr` also backports the following
      definitions:
      * The `type TyVarBndrVis = TyVarBndr BndrVis` type synonym.
      * The `DefaultBndrFlag` class, which can be used to write code that is
        polymorphic over `TyVarBndr` flags while still allowing the code to return
        a reasonable default value for the flag.
      * The `bndrReq` and `bndrInvis` definitions, which behave identically to
        `BndrReq` and `BndrInvis`.
    * `Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr` now defines the following utility
      functions, which are not present in `template-haskell`:
      * `plainTVReq`, `plainTVInvis`, `kindedTVReq`, and `kindedTVInvis`
        functions, which construct `PlainTV`s and `KindedTV`s with particular
        `BndrVis` flags.
      * An `elimTVFlag`, which behaves like `elimTV`, but where the continuation
        arguments also take a `flag` argument. (Note that the type of this
        function is slightly different on old versions of `template-haskell`.
        See the Haddocks for more.)
      * A `tvFlag` function, which extracts the `flag` from a `TyVarBndr`. (Note
        that the type of this function is slightly different on old versions of
        `template-haskell`. See the Haddocks for more.)
    * The types of the `dataDCompat` and `newtypeDCompat` functions have had
      their `[TyVarBndrUnit]` arguments changed to `[TyVarBndrVis]`, matching
      similar changes to `DataD` and `NewtypeD` in `template-haskell`.

    Because `BndrVis` is a synonym for `()` on pre-9.8 versions of GHC, this
    change is unlikely to break any existing code, provided that you build it
    with GHC 9.6 or earlier. If you build with GHC 9.8 or later, on the other
    hand, it is likely that you will need to update your existing code. Here are
    some possible ways that your code might fail to compile with GHC 9.8, along
    with some migration strategies:

    * Your code passes a `TyVarBndrUnit` in a place where a `TyVarBndrVis` is now
      expected in GHC 9.8, such as in the arguments to `dataDCompat`:

      ```hs
      import "template-haskell" Language.Haskell.TH
      import "th-abstraction"   Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype (dataDCompat)

      dec :: DecQ
      dec = dataDCompat (pure []) d [PlainTV a ()] [] []
        where
          d = mkName "d"
          a = mkName "a"
      ```

      With GHC 9.8, this will fail to compile with:

      ```
      error: [GHC-83865]
          • Couldn't match expected type ‘BndrVis’ with actual type ‘()’
          • In the second argument of ‘PlainTV’, namely ‘()’
            In the expression: PlainTV a ()
            In the third argument of ‘dataDCompat’, namely ‘[PlainTV a ()]’
        |
        | dec = dataDCompat (pure []) d [PlainTV a ()] [] []
        |                                          ^^
      ```

      Some possible ways to migrate this code include:

      * Use the `bndrReq` function or `BndrReq` pattern synonym in place of `()`,
        making sure to import them from `Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr`:

        ```hs
        ...
        import "th-abstraction" Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr

        dec :: DecQ
        dec = dataDCompat (pure []) d [PlainTV a bndrReq] [] []
        -- Or, alternatively:
        {-
        dec = dataDCompat (pure []) d [PlainTV a BndrReq] [] []
        -}
          where
            ...
        ```
      * Use the `plainTV` function from `Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr`,
        which is now sufficiently polymorphic to work as both a `TyVarBndrUnit`
        and a `TyVarBndrVis`:

        ```hs
        ...
        import Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr

        dec :: DecQ
        dec = dataDCompat (pure []) d [plainTV a] [] []
          where
            ...
        ```
    * You may have to replace some uses of `TyVarBndrUnit` with `TyVarBndrVis`
      in your code. For instance, this will no longer typecheck in GHC 9.8 for
      similar reasons to the previous example:

      ```hs
      import "template-haskell" Language.Haskell.TH
      import "th-abstraction"   Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype (dataDCompat)

      dec :: DecQ
      dec = dataDCompat (pure []) d tvbs [] []
        where
          tvbs :: [TyVarBndrUnit]
          tvbs = [plainTV a]

          d = mkName "d"
          a = mkName "a"
      ```

      Here is a version that will typecheck with GHC 9.8 and earlier:

      ```hs
      ...
      import "th-abstraction" Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr

      dec :: DecQ
      dec = dataDCompat (pure []) d tvbs [] []
        where
          tvbs :: [TyVarBndrVis]
          tvbs = [plainTV a]

          ...
      ```
    * In some cases, the `TyVarBndrUnit`s might come from another place in the
      code, e.g.,

      ```hs
      import "template-haskell" Language.Haskell.TH
      import "th-abstraction"   Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype (dataDCompat)

      dec :: [TyVarBndrUnit] -> DecQ
      dec tvbs = dataDCompat (pure []) d tvbs [] []
        where
          d = mkName "d"
      ```

      If it is not straightforward to change `dec`'s type to accept
      `[TyVarBndrVis]` as an argument, another viable option is to use the
      `changeTVFlags` function:

      ```hs
      ...
      import "th-abstraction" Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr

      dec :: [TyVarBndrUnit] -> DecQ
      dec tvbs = dataDCompat (pure []) d tvbs' [] []
        where
          tvbs' :: [TyVarBndrVis]
          tvbs' = changeTVFlags bndrReq tvbs

          ...
      ```

    This guide, while not comprehensive, should cover most of the common cases one
    will encounter when migrating their `th-abstraction` code to support GHC 9.8.

  ## 0.4.1.0 -- 2020-12-09
  * Fix a bug in which `normalizeDec` would give incorrect kind annotations to
    type variables in quoted `Dec`s. `normalizeDec` now leaves the kinds of
    type variable binders alone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 30 08:36:12 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update th-abstraction to version 0.4.0.0.
  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-09-29
  * Adapt to the `TyVarBndr` data type gaining a new `flag` type parameter
    (in `template-haskell-2.17.0.0`) to represent its specificity:
    * Introduce a new `Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype.TyVarBndr` module that
      defines `TyVarBndr_`, a backwards-compatible type synonym for `TyVarBndr`,
      as well as backporting `TyVarBndrSpec`, `TyVarBndrUnit`, and `Specificity`.
      This module also defines other useful functions for constructing and
      manipulating `TyVarBndr`s.
    * The types in `Language.Haskell.TH.Datatype` now use `TyVarBndr_`,
      `TyVarBndrUnit`, and `TyVarBndrSpec` where appropriate. Technically, this
      is not a breaking change, since all three are simple type synonyms around
      `TyVarBndr`, but it is likely that you will need to update your
      `th-abstraction`-using code anyway if it involves a `TyVarBndr`-consuming
      function.

  * Support substituting into and extracting free variables from `ForallVisT`s
    on `template-haskell-2.16.0.0` (GHC 8.10) or later.
  * Fix a bug in which `freeVariables` could report duplicate kind variables when
    they occur in the kinds of the type variable binders in a `ForallT`.
  * Fix a bug in which `resolveInfixT` would not resolve `UInfixT`s occurring in
    the kinds of type variable binders in a `ForallT`.
  * Fix a bug in which the `TypeSubstitution ConstructorInfo` instance would not
    detect free kind variables in the `constructorVars`.

- Update th-abstraction to version 0.3.1.0.
  ## 0.3.1.0 -- 2019-04-28
  * Fix a bug which would cause data family information to be reified incorrectly
    with GHC 8.8+ in some situations.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2019-04-26
  * Breaking change: the `datatypeVars` field of `DatatypeInfo` is now of type
    `[TyVarBndr]` instead of `[Type]`, as it now refers to all of the bound type
    variables in the data type. The old `datatypeVars` field has been renamed to
    `datatypeInstTypes` to better reflect its purpose.

    In addition, the type of `normalizeCon` now has an additional `[TyVarBndr]`
    argument, since `DatatypeInfo` now requires it.
  * Support `template-haskell-2.15`.
  * Fix a bug in which `normalizeDec` would not detect existential type variables
    in a GADT constructor if they were implicitly quantified.
  * Fix a bug in which `normalizeDec` would report an incorrect number of
    `datatypeVars` for GADT declarations with explicit return kinds (such as
    `data Foo :: * -> * where`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update th-abstraction to version 0.2.11.0.
  ## 0.2.11.0 -- 2019-02-26
  * Fix a bug in which `freeVariablesWellScoped` would sometimes not preserve
    the left-to-right ordering of `Name`s generated with `newName`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 21 03:02:45 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- Update th-abstraction to version 0.2.10.0.
  ## 0.2.10.0 -- 2018-12-20
  * Optimization: `quantifyType` now collapses consecutive `forall`s. For
    instance, calling `quantifyType` on `forall b. a -> b -> T a` now produces
    `forall a b. a -> b -> T a` instead of `forall a. forall b. a -> b -> T a`.

  ## 0.2.9.0 -- 2018-12-20
  * Fix a bug in which `resolveTypeSynonyms` would not look into `ForallT`s,
    `SigT`s, `InfixT`s, or `ParensT`s.
  * Fix a bug in which `quantifyType` would not respect the dependency order of
    type variables (e.g., `Proxy (a :: k)` would have erroneously been quantified
    as `forall a k. Proxy (a :: k)`).
  * Fix a bug in which `asEqualPred` would return incorrect results with GHC 8.7.
  * Add a `freeVariablesWellScoped` function which computes the free variables of
    a list of types and sorts them according to dependency order.
  * Add a `resolveKindSynonyms` function which expands all type synonyms in a
    `Kind`. This is mostly useful for supporting old GHCs where `Type` and `Kind`
    were not the same.

Fri Jul 13 14:31:53 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- Update th-abstraction to version 0.2.8.0.
  ## 0.2.8.0 -- 2018-06-29
  * GADT reification is now much more robust with respect to `PolyKinds`:
    * A bug in which universally quantified kind variables were mistakenly
      flagged as existential has been fixed.
    * A bug in which the kinds of existentially quantified type variables
      were not substituted properly has been fixed.
    * More kind equalities are detected than before. For example, in the
      following data type:

      ```haskell
      data T (a :: k) where
        MkT :: forall (a :: Bool). T a
      ```

      We now catch the `k ~ Bool` equality.
  * Tweak `resolveTypeSynonyms` so that failing to reify a type constructor
    name so longer results in an error. Among other benefits, this makes
    it possible to pass data types with GADT syntax to `normalizeDec`.

  ## 0.2.7.0 -- 2018-06-17
  * Fix bug in which data family instances with duplicate occurrences of type
    variables in the left-hand side would have redundant equality constraints
    in their contexts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 14 17:02:11 UTC 2018 - psimons@suse.com

- Update th-abstraction to version 0.2.6.0 revision 1.
  * Fix bug in which `applySubstitution` and `freeVariables` would ignore
    type variables in the kinds of type variable binders.
  * Added `pragLineDCompat`, `newtypeDCompat` and `tySynInstDCompat`
  * Fix bug that caused GADT equality constraints to be incorrect in some cases.
  * Expose `Unpackedness` and `Strictness` (which were unexported by accident).
  * Add `resolvePredSynonyms`
  * Add `reifyConstructor`, which allows reification of `ConstructorInfo` from
    a constructor name, and `lookupByConstructorName`, which allows directly
    looking up a `ConstructorInfo` from a `DatatypeInfo` value for a given
    constructor `Name`.
  * Augment `reifyDatatype` to be able to look up `DatatypeInfo` from the `Name`
    of a record selector for one of its constructors. Also add `reifyRecord` for
    reification of of `ConstructorInfo` from a record name, and
    `lookupByRecordName`, which allows directly looking up a `ConstructorInfo`
    from a `DatatypeInfo` value for a given record `Name`.
  * Fix bug that caused `th-abstraction` to fail on GHC 7.0 and 7.2 when passing
    a vanilla constructor name to `reifyDatatype`
  * Make `normalizeDec` and `normalizeCon` more robust with respect to
    data family instances on GHC 7.6 and 7.8
