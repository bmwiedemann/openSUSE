%description
A Haskell interface to 'syslog(3)' as specified in
<http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/syslog.html
POSIX.1-2008>. The entire public API lives in "System.Posix.Syslog".
There is a set of exposed modules available underneath that one, which contain
various implementation details that may be useful to other developers who want
to implement syslog-related functionality. /Users/ of 'syslog', however, do not
need them.

An example program that demonstrates how to use this library is available in
the <https://github.com/peti/hsyslog/blob/master/example/Main.hs examples>
directory of this package.
