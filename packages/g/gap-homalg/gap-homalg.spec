%description
The package homalg is the foundational part of the homalg project. It
provides procedures to construct basic objects in homological
algebra:

* filtrations of objects
* complexes (of objects and of complexes)
* chain morphisms
* bicomplexes
* bigraded (differential) objects
* spectral sequences
* functors
