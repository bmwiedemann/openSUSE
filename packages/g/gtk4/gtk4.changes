Tue Sep 10 08:41:08 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- No longer provide/obsolete gtk3-schema: upstream changed the
  schema names for gtk4 finally and cut compatibility with gtk3. So
  from now on, we have gtk3-schema and gtk4-schema in parallel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  6 03:41:07 UTC 2019 - Luke Jones <luke@ljones.dev>

- Update to version 3.96.0:

  + DND has been refactored. There are now separate GdkDrag and
    GdkDrop objects. This work is still incomplete
  + The GDK_SURFACE_SUBSURFACE surface type has been removed.
  + Use of child surfaces has been greatly reduced. This work is still
    incomplete
  + The use of global coordinates in GDK apis has been reduced. This
    work is still incomplete
  + Events have been simplified and are used just for input
    - expose events have been replaced by a GdkSurface::render signal
    - configure events have been replaced by a
      GdkSurface::size-changed signal
    - map events have been replaced by a GdkSurface::mapped property
    - gdk_event_handler_set has been replaced by a GdkSurface::event
      signal
    - key events no longer contain a string
    - events on unmapped widgets are ignored
  + Warping the pointer is no longer supported
  + The Wayland backend now uses the Settings portal for GtkSettings
  + The Wayland input module uses the text-input-unstable-v3 protocol
  + The Broadway backend has been rewritten to work well with GSK
  + The color chooser has a color picker
  + GtkApplication tracks screensaver state and has a ::query-end
    signal
  + The file chooser portal backend supports file filters
  + A number of list models have been introduced, for internal use
    and as public api:
    - GtkMapListModel
    - GtkSliceListModel
    - GtkSortListModel
    - GtkSelectionModel
    - GtkSingleSelection
  + Support for tabular menus and combo boxes has been dropped
  + Key themes are no longer supported
  + GtkInvisible has been dropped
  + A GtkRoot interface has been added that is currently implemented
    just by GtkWindow. This work is incomplete
  + GtkWidgets can transform their children using projective linear
    transformations. This functionality is available in CSS and
    as GskTransform argument to gtk_widget_allocate. GtkFixed is
    a container that exposes this functionality. For examples of this,
    see the swing transition of GtkRevealer, the rotate transitions
    of GtkStack or the Fixed Layout example in gtk-demo.
  + GtkEntry functionality has been moved into a new GtkText widget,
    the GtkEditable interface has been expanded, and new a new
    GtkPasswordEntry widget has been introduced.
  + Focus handling has been rewritten, and focus-change event
    generation has been unified with crossing events.
  + All demos and settings schemas have been renamed to avoid
    collisions with GTK3.
  + GtkWidget can now use a GtkLayoutManager for size allocation.
    Layout managers can optionally use layout children holding layout
    properties. A number of layout managers are available:
    - GtkBinLayout
    - GtkBoxLayout
    - GtkGridLayout
    - GtkFixedLayout
    - GtkCustomLayout
    More layout manager implementations will appear in the future.
  + GtkAssistant, GtkStack and GtkNotebook now have publicly
    accessible page objects for their children. The page objects
    are also exposed via a list model.
  + GtkContainer no longer supports child properties. All existing
    child properties have been removed, converted to regular properties,
    moved to layout properties or moved to child meta objects.
  + GtkListBox has gained a ::show-separators property that gets
    translated into a CSS style class.
  + A number of X11-specific GtkWindow and GdkSurface apis have been
    removed or changed to backend APIs.
  + GtkBuilder can specify object-valued properties inline.
  + The gtk4-builder-tool simplify command has gained a --3to4 option
    to convert GTK3 ui files to GTK4.
  + The inspector can show child meta objects and layout properties.
- Remove gtk4-fix-dependency-error.patch, fixed upstream.

    Provides tags to follow upstream changes while placing
    Obsolets tags for them: immodule-amharic, immodule-broadway,
    immodule-inuktitut, immodule-multipress, immodule-thai,
    immodule-tigrigna, immodule-vietnamese, immodule-xim and data.
  + Drop gtk4-tools Requires(post): this no longer needed.

    being supplemented by the lang subpackage due to RPM automatic
    setting.
  + Drop gtk4-data Provides: there's no such subpackage anymore.
  + Drop glib2_gsettings_schema_requires macro: this is no longer
    needed since RPM file triggers (version > 4.13).

    gtk_widget_queue_draw is left.
  + Observing widget contents and size is now done by using the
    GtkWidgetPaintable object instead of connecting to widget
    signals.
  + The GtkWidget::draw signal has been removed, widgets need to
    implement GtkWidget::snapshot.
  + GdkTexture now has GdkMemoryTexture and GdkGLTexture
    subclasses.
  + The Vulkan support in GDK can now use a particular device that
    is specified by the GDK_VULKAN_DEVICE environment variable. Use

    equivalents in GdkDisplay.
  + GdkVisual has been removed.
  + GdkDeviceManager has been replaced by GdkSeat.
  + Clipboard handling has been moved from GTK to GDK, and has been
    modernized to provide an extensible, asynchronous, stream-based

  + Updated translations.
- Add meson BuildRequires and replace configure/make/make_install
  calls with meson/meson_build and meson_install: follow upstreams
  port to meson as build system.
- Add gcc-c++ BuildRequires: small parts of GTK+ now are written in
  C++.
- Add gtk-doc BuildRequires: in order to build man-pages,
  documentation needs to be enabled, which in turn requires
  gtk-doc. In the past, we provided upstream shipped documentation.
- Add gtk4-return-nonvoid.patch: Fix 'reaches end of non-void
  function without return value', taken from git.
- Add rpmlintrc: multiple GTK4 libraries are not goint to be
  supported in parallel and the name will stabilize.

  + The GSK_USE_SOFTWARE environment variable has been generalized
    as GSK_RENDERER. Use GSK_RENDERER=help to learn about possible
    values. Other environment variables that have gained new
    possible values in clude GSK_DEBUG=vulkan and
    GTK_DEBUG=snapshot.

  + Updated translations.
- Drop gtk4-find-wayland.patch: Fixed upstream. Following this,
  drop gnome-common BuildRequires and autoreconf call as we no
  longer carry any patches.
- Add vulkan-devel BuildRequires and Requires, also pass
  --enable-vulkan to configure to ensure we build the vulkan
  support.

- Split out glib schemas into gtk4-schema: gtk3 and gtk4 share the
  same schema (in order to sync their config changes). With this
  split we can have gtk4-schema provide/obsolete gtk3-schema and
  get around the two conflicting on file level.
- Move relevant %gsettings macros from -data to -schema package.
- Require gtk4-schema by libgtk-4-0.
- Provide/Obsolete gtk3-schema by gtk4-schema.
- Split out gettext-its-gtk4.
