- Update to 4.12
  + Bugfixes
    o Bug 794584 - Register not updated when scheduled transactions 
      created
    o Bug 798262 - Scheduled transactions with blank amounts do not 
      get created.

    o Bug 798573 - Tab Width Behaviour
      Formerly when the notebook tabs on the left or right, the 
      space used fluctuated depending on tab label width. This 
      change sets the label width to the preference setting when the 
      tabs are on the left or right but when top or bottom the width 
      is set to the number of characters when shorter than the 
      preference setting so they take up less room.

      of first transaction

      simple_business_create.py.

      program set the time to neutral time instead of the beginning 
      of the day unless get_date_internal is called with 
      GNC_DATE_EDIT_SHOW_TIME in which case the user-provided time 
      is used.
    o Bug 798616 - Can't register amount greater than 9,000,000,000

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  1 12:48:54 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.8
  + Compatibility Notice:
    In order to allow flatpak users to share preferences with
    installations outside of the sandbox we need to change the
    preference path from /org/gnucash to /org/gnucash/GnuCash. This
    release of GnuCash does that and it will automatically migrate
    existing preferences. It does not, however, continue to write
    preferences to the old path and it runs the migration only
    once. If you go back and forth between GnuCash 4.7 and an older
    versions you'll have two sets of preferences, one for GnuCash
    4.7 and later and another for GnuCash 4.6 and earlier. This
    includes the file history list and last-opened file.
  + Bugfixes
  + Updated translations.
- Add 285017793d2c0c9f5a8d52b3db42944480e3f557.patch: Use plain cat
  instead of cmake -E cat to join the migratable-prefs. Fixes build
  for everything older than current Tumbleweed.

  + Fix help_label of dialog-doclink.glade, remove question mark 
    from Available, and insert missing spaces into the Business Item
    variant.
  + Rename all Transaction and Invoice Association identifiers to

  + Rename Transaction and Invoice Associations to Document Links.

  + Fix the horizontal scrollbar in the linked docs window.
  + I18n - deduplicate translatable strings
  + macOS: Give GnuCash time to shut down gracefully instead of 
    letting macOS pull the rug out.
  + I18N: Align glossary to gnucash.pot. Create a similar copyright
    header. Add missing Report-Msgid-Bugs-To.
  + [report-utilities] More dump data functions:
    gnc:dump-book - splits grouped by account
    gnc:dump-all-transactions - splits grouped by transaction
    gnc:dump-split - dumps single split
  + [business-urls] link to owner report with enddate

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  2 18:26:26 UTC 2020 - Johannes Engel <jcnengel@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.1
  + New gnucash-cli executable for command line interactions
  + Improvements for business documents layout
  + When deleting accounts the destination accounts of moved splits 
    will be checked to ensure that they have the same commodity as 
    the source account. If they don't you'll get a warning and the 
    opportunity to pick another account or to carry on regardless.
  + New type-ahead search added to sequential search when selecting 
    an account in the register: Instead of typing the first few 
    characters of a top level account, the separator, the first few 
    characters of the next level account and so on you may instead 
    type a few characters of any part of a full account name and the 
    drop-list will be filtered to contain only matching accounts. 
    Once you have a small enough list you can use the arrow keys to 
    select the account that you want.
  + Python bindings are now localized and their strings available for 
    translation.
  + A new Transaction Association dialog, available from the Update 
    Association for Transaction menu item that has replaced the two 
    association items in 3.x, allows setting, changing, and deleting 
    associations.
  + Allow Associations to be added to invoices. The actual 
    association when present is added as a link button which is shown 
    below the notes.
  + A symbol is now displayed on transactions in the register when 
    they have an attachment and the selected font supports the 
    symbol. This does not work on MacOS, which will continue to use 
    a letter.
  + The OFX file importer can now import more than one file at a time.
  + A new report menu supbmenu Multicolumn contains the old 
    custom-multicolumn report and a new Dashboard report containing 
    Account reports for expenses and income, an income-expense chart, 
    and an account summary.
  + Support for UK VAT and Australian GST added to the Income-GST 
    report. The reports options are changed from source accounts to 
    source sales and purchase accounts to permit proper reporting of 
    capital purchases. N.B. This is incompatible with previous versions 
    of the report and will require regenerating saved configurations.
  + The matcher window columns are changed from R to C and from U+R 
    to U+C, reflecting that the matcher marks transactions cleared but 
    doesn't reconcile them. (Bug 797338)
  + OFX imports having balance information will now offer to immediately 
    reconcile, passing the balance information in the file to the 
    reconcile info.
  + Improve quickfill in the account pickers to filter the choices 
    based on any part of the name.
  + The GnuCash widget hierarchy for CSS has been revised to be more 
    consistent with Gtk practice. You may need to spend some time with 
    the GtkInspector to get your custom CSS back the way you like it.
  + When creating a new account hierarchy it's now possible to load 
    account templates from locales other than the one set for the user 
    interface. (Bug 797472)
  + New Account - Online Account match list to the Import Map Editor.
  + New invalid maps dialog in the Import Map Editor. (Bug 797612)
  + Optionally include the account code option in budget view.
  + Account matcher will decline to match accounts with a different 
    commodity from the imported split if the import information includes 
    the commodity.
  + Ellipsize the Description and Memo fields in the account matcher.
  + Enable adding notes to budgets. (Bug 693180)
  + Support for AQBanking Version 6. This is required to support new 
    FinTS protocols for the European Payment Services Directive (PSD2).
  + GnuCash 4.x will not migrate old gconf settings from GnuCash 2.4.x.
  + Reversing transactions will now pop a dialog box to request a 
    posting date. (Bug 782455)
  + The Accounts page has a new optional column for the hidden 
    property to make it easier to toggle it. Note that in order 
    to see hidden accounts you must still enable that in the 
    Filter by... dialog. (Bug 797486)
  + The Customer, Vendor, and Employee overviews have a 
    process-payment toolbar. (Bug 797605).
  + Account codes may now optionally be displayed in the Budget 
    Tree View. (Bug 797489).

Wed Jun 27 23:02:33 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 3.2:
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#787401, bgo#794617, bgo#795101, bgo#795247,
    bgo#795253, bgo#795272, bgo#795276, bgo#795362, bgo#795471,

    bgo#796638.
  + Other fixes/enhancements:
    - Transaction report improvements:
      . Enable computing averages in subtotal grid;
      . Generate the subtotal grid only if the primary sort key
        enables subtotals;
      . Fix subtotal grid to support multiple commodities;
      . New filters.
    - Add tooltip support for register cells.
    - Replace old-style html style attributes with css.
    - Add the full account name to the saved register settings.
    - Fix misplaced try block that caused unhandled exception if
      year out of range.
    - Fix permanent storage of vendor details.
    - Update invoice reports to give a consistent representation of
      invoice data across the application.
    - Ensure gncEntry rounding is consistent. Internally calculated
      values in the entry are never rounded. Consumers of
      gncEntry's calculated values can request them either rounded
      or not. Next use a pragmatical approach for calculating
      values on invoices based on the entry values: do the rounding
      such that we never create an unbalanced transaction while
      posting.
      That means:
      . Round each entry's net value before summing them in net
        total;
      . Accumulate all tax totals on invoice level per tax account
        before rounding and round before before summing them in a
        global tax total.
      A complete solution can only be offered if users are allowed
      to manually correct tax entries. This requires changes to
      user interface and data format so that's not going to happen
      in gnucash 3.x.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop explicit C(XX)FLAGS exportation: now cmake export them by
  default.
- Readd pkgconfig(libsecret-1) BuildRequires, following upstream
  changes. Its support have got lost after porting the build system
  to CMake.
- Conditionalize pkgconfig(gwengui-gtk3) BuildRequires to be used
  only by Tumbleweed (suse_version > 1500) as previous releases do
  not ship it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 12 09:20:27 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Export C/CXXFLAGS="-Wno-error=parentheses, fix build with gcc8.
  This is more or less the exact route taken by upstream to
  workaround gcc8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  6 21:43:13 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Drop pkgconfig(libgoffice-0.8) BuildRequires: No longer needed,
  nor used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 01:19:03 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 3.1:
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#118391, bgo#769686, bgo#772776, bgo#782144,

    bgo#795471.
  + Other fixes:
    - Fix crash when loading sql book with posted transactions;
    - html-font: add default font family;
    - Several improvements to the Transaction and GST reports;
    - csv-impport: Allow empty amount fields;
    - Remove the set transient parent setting for Reconcile window;
    - Prevent throw in gnc-pricedb;
    - If there are no prices in the db, critical errors are
      flagged.
  + Updated translations.
- Fix redundancy in python3-gnucash subpackage description.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 19 22:15:22 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Add gwengui-gtk3 pkgconfig module BuildRequires: make use of our
  package again instead of the one bundled with GnuCash now that we
  supply it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  4 00:52:58 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 3.0:
  + New Features:
    - New editors to remove outdated or incorrect match data from
      the import maps, a new user interfacs for managing files
      associated with transactions, an improved facility for
      removing old prices from the price database, and a way to
      remove deleted files from the history list in the file menu.
    - New Reports: A Reconciliation Report based on the Transaction
      Report, an Income GST Report, and a Cashflow Barchart report.
    - A new CSV importer largely rewritten in C++, adding new
      features including the ability to re-import CSV files
      exported from GnuCash, along with a separate CSV price
      importer.
    - A new preference panel for the Alphavantage API key so that
      Finance::Quote users need not edit /etc/gnucash/environment.
    - Data file directories are now located appropriately to the
      operating system's conventions by default:
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnucash (or the default $HOME/.config/\
      gnucash).
    - Accounts in the Bayes import map are now linked by GUID
      instead of names so that the matcher won't have to be
      retrained if you rename an account.
    - MySQL and SQLite3 date storage has changed a bit. Once
      converted, MySQL and SQLite3 database will be loadable only
      by GnuCash 2.6.19 and later.
    - Numerics are rewritten to allow for more significant digits.
      The old 6-digit-maximum fraction is now 9-digits, and prices
      may have up to 18 digit precision.
    - Transaction Report improvements, including regular expression
      filtering and many more options and features.
    - The About dialog box layout is improved and now includes the
      detected Finance::Quote version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 02:44:09 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 2.7.8:
  + Bugs fixed:
    - Segmentation Fault in Transfer dialog after clearing Date
      field and pressing escape (bgo#787439).
    - Remove keep above setting for assistant hierarchy
      (bgo#794242).
  + Other fixes:
    - Test for Key_file not being NULL before trying to free it.
    - Stop critical error due to testing null filename
      g_filename_from_uri returns NULL if it is not a file uri so
      test for the file:// prefix before doing g_file_test.
    - More transient-parent fixes.
    - Add missing response section to the account picker dialog.
    - Glade 3.20 adds surplus padding option to action area.
      When glade files are saved which have GtkAssistants defined
      a packing section is added to the assistant action area which
      then causes a warning so remove them.
    - Add XML namespaces for all Account Hierarchy Templates.
    - Increase default options dialog size: The old 400x400 was
      woefully inadequate for most options especially options
      involving account trees.
- Changes from version 2.7.7:
  + Bugs fixed:
    - Segmentation Fault in Transfer dialog after clearing Date
      field and pressing escape (bgo#787439).
    - Add python3 support (bgo#791831).
    - Remove keep above setting for assistant hierarchy
      (bgo#794242).
  + Other fixes:
    - Fix date corruption in SQL load. Four date elements were
      affected: GncEntry::date, GncEntry::date_entered,
      GncInvoice::opened, and GncInvoice::posted. This does not
      affect the stored values of the dates.
    - Fix lost Bayesian matches in SQL backend. The
      import-map-bayes uses a three-part key that uses the same
      delimiter as a path and the SQL backend was throwing away
      everything except the account guid.
    - More transient-window fixes and other Gtk3 cleanups.
    - Add xmlns namespace declarations to all of the accounts
      templates that lacked it and remove the emacs mode-setting
      comments at the end of them.
  + Updated translations.
- Pass COMPILE_GSCHEMAS=OFF to cmake to disable gschemas
  compilation as this is delegated to Glib's RPM file triggers.
- Add python3-devel BuildRequires, readd Python bindings now
  that Python 3 support is provided and Recommend the subpackage.
- Update package summaries and description to show more explicitly
  their contents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 15 04:29:31 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Pass CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH to cmake since GnuCash won't
  be ran from the build tree, and to avoid occasionally relinking
  failures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 12 23:17:23 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 2.7.6:
  + New Features:
    - Modernise chart colours from the dated CSS defaults to modern
      colours as suggested by http://clrs.cc/.
    - Add "Subtotal Summary Grid" to the Transaction Report.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#764245, bgo#793460, bgo#793467, bgo#793699,
    bgo#793900, bgo#793941, bgo#793947, bgo#794031, bgo#794083 and
    bgo#794137.
  + Other fixes:
    - Csv imp settings - internalize prefix handling.
    - Csv import - improve memory handling in the assistant class.
    - Add some background info on memory management in CSV
      importers. As the assistant code combines multiple memory
      management models care should be taken not to mix them up.
      The notes should give some insights in how to do this.
    - Lots of transient parent warnings fixed.
    - Fix Segmentation fault when going to File->New.
    - Speed up GUID equality comparison.
    - With register obscured the sheet kept being redrawn.
  + Updated translations.
- Add libboost_system-devel BuildRequires: new dependency.
- Drop intltool BuildRequires following upstream migration to
  Gettext.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 28 16:30:27 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Modernize spec-file by calling spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 28 12:58:44 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.7.5:
  + Locate all user data and configuration files to
    platform-dependent standard locations ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnucash
    (or the default $HOME/.config/gnucash))
    - GnuCash currently uses the following files in this directory:
      . log.conf (to set what gets logged to gnucash.trace).
      . config-user.scm (to add custom scheme code like custom
        reports; replaces config.user and config-.user).
      . gtk-3.0.css (For theming)
  + Further improvements to the Transaction and
    Income-GST-statement reports.
  + Transaction Report: omit display of $0 in subtotals in other
    currencies. Previously in dual-subtotal columns, the
    dual-subtotal would attempt to print all commodities in the
    row. This meant if user chose common-currency thereby
    triggering additional commodities, the dual-subtotal would
    attempt to add amounts in other commodities which would be 0,
    and display the 0 amount.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 24 23:31:46 UTC 2017 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 2.7.4:
  + New Features For Users:
    - A new preference panel for the Alphavantage API key so that

      box.
    - Removed all references to the various Yahoo! quote sources
      and made Alphavantage the default.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#787497, bgo#790526, bgo#790845, bgo#792106,
    bgo#792809 and bgo#792947.
  + Other fixes:
    - Some Guile 2.2 issues are resolved.
    - Some bugs in the new Transaction Report.
    - Correct setting of WebKit version during configuration when
      the version is cached.
    - The change to the Average Cost calulation introduced in
      2.6.12 is reverted (bgo#775368).
    - Fix appstream id as per the appstream recommendation.
    - Fix incorrect minimum dates in the net-linechart and
      net-barchart reports.
    - Fix a report crash if the Account Depth is too low.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 2.7.3:
  + New Features For Users:
    - A greatly enhanced Transaction report with many new options
      and features.
    - Removed 6-figure rounding from price calculations, allowing
      prices to have up to 18 digit precision.
    - A flatter storage scheme for Bayes account-matching scores.
    - A CSV Price importer.
    - Enhanced python bindings exposing more GnuCash API.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#616709, bgo#771667, bgo#787497, bgo#790526,
    bgo#791848, bgo#787497, bgo#789928 and bgo#790620.
  + Other fixes:
    - More dialogs are made "transient for" so that they pop up
      centered on the main Gnucash window.
    - Added a framework for migrating preferences.
    - Make the splash/lock screen the transient parent for dialog
      boxes if the main window is not yet mapped.
    - Adapter for new flat KVP scheme for bayes import maps to be
      introduced in 3.0.
    - A better way to handle MySQL's 0000-00-00 invalid date
      indicator.
    - Improve type of bank accounts in SKR03.
  + Updated translations.
- Update to version 2.7.2:
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#734865, bgo#778692, bgo#784623, bgo#789608,
    bgo#789928 and bgo#790550.
  + Other fixes:
    - SQL parameter quoting is corrected in the backend so that
      only string parameters are quoted.
    - SQL table versions weren't set consistently and a bogus
      version test could cause some tables to be not loaded.
    - Better, more targeted handling of MySQL's penchant for
      setting date-time fields.
    - Major repairs to the "Dense Calendar" date selector.
    - Fix colors on graph reports.
    - Two large batches of styling fixes for Gtk3.
    - Convert the graphical reports to use GnuCash's rational
      numbers instead of doubles for better accuracy.
- Changes from version 2.7.1:
  + Bug fixed: Prompt for file history update leads to crash during
    startup (bgo#789298).
  + Other fixes:
    - GnuCash no longer crashes when loading price data.
    - The Options Dialogs will appear over the application window
      instead of wherever Gdk decides is coordinates 0, 0 on the
      display.
    - Link correctly owners to invoices in the SQL backend.
    - Fix Reconcile dialog always showing a 0 ending balance.
    - Fix the book being always marked dirty at startup if it
      contained any scheduled transactions.
- Changes from version 2.7.0:
  + New Features For Users:
    - There's a new CSV importer largely rewritten in C++, adding
      some new features.
    - Data file directories are now located appropriately to the
      operating system's conventions by default.
    - Accounts in the Bayes import map are now linked by GUID
      instead of names so that the matcher won't have to be
      retrained if you rename an account. THIS WILL MAKE YOUR FILE
      UNREADABLE BY PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF GNUCASH. There's a new
      editor to remove outdated or incorrect match data from the
      import maps, a new user interfacs for managing files
      associated with transactions, an improved facility for
      removing old prices from the price database, and a way to
      remove deleted files from the history list in the file menu.
    - Numerics are rewritten to allow for more significant
      digits.
    - New Income GST Report and some improvements to the
      Transaction report.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo# 87652, bgo#120250, bgo#122895, bgo#343227,

    bgo#778042 and bgo#780845.
  + Updated Guide translations.
- Drop automake and libtool BuildRequires, and add cmake and ninja.
  Replace configure, make and make_install macros by cmake,
  make_jobs and cmake_install. And pass: DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=OFF,
  CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR=%{_docdir}/%{name},
  GMOCK_ROOT=%{_includedir}/gmock and
  GTEST_ROOT=%{_includedir}/gtest options to cmake. All of these
  changes reflect the upstream port to CMake build system.
- Drop python-devel BuildRequires and python-gnucash subpackage as
  python 3 support is not available.
- Drop gconf-2.0, gtkmm-2.4, gwengui-gtk2 and libgnomeui-2.0
  pkgconfig modules and slib as build requirements: they are no
  longer dependencies.
- Drop guile, perl-Crypt-SSLeay, perl-HTML-Parser,
  perl-HTML-TableExtract, perl-libwww-perl and slib Requires:
  they are no longer run time requirements anymore.
- Replace perl-Date-Manip and perl-Finance-Quote Requires tag with
  perl(Date::Manip) perl(Finance::Quote) Recommends and add
  iso-codes as recomendation too: the first two are used for online
  price retrieval and are not necessary to run GnuCash, and the
  third is for translation of currency names.
- Add gmock, gtest, and date_time, filesystem, headers, locale
  and regex libboost_*-devel packages, makeinfo and xsltproc; and
  glib-2.0, gio-2.0, gobject-2.0, gmodule-2.0, gthread-2.0,
  icu-i18n, icu-uc and ktoblzcheck pkgconfig modules as new build
  time dependencies.
- Replace libdbi-devel with pkgconfig(dbi) now that its pkgconfig
  module is available, pkgconfig(gtk+-2.0) with *(gtk+-3.0) and
  pkgconfig(webkit-1.0) with *(webkit2gtk-4.0), using their newer
  versions and following upstream changes.
- Move to guile-2.2 replacing pkgconfig(guile-2.0) BuildRequires
  with guile-devel: this allows flexibility with the guile-version
  that can be built against.
- Drop %glib2_gsettings_schema_requires macro: it is no longer a
  requirement since RPM File Triggers cover its functionality now.
- Remove unneeded %clean section as RPM already does this work
  itself.
- Drop update-desktop-files BuildRequires and its macro: it is no
  longer required.
- Add shlib-policy-missing-suffix filter to rpmlintrc since
  splitting the shared libraries does not make sense at the moment.
- Update package descriptions shortening it.
- Rebase gnucash-cpan-warning.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 21 01:02:30 UTC 2017 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 2.6.19:
  + Adapter for new flat KVP scheme for bayes import maps to be
    introduced in 2.8.0.
  + A better way to handle MySQL's 0000-00-00 invalid date
    indicator.
  + Add translator hint comments to C and glade files.
  + Improve type of bank accounts in SKR03.
  + Bugs fixed:
    - Disabling OFX, AqBanking or python-bindings support cripples
      the dist build target (bgo#787497).
    - Failed to create file:
      /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled.XY789Y
      (bgo#790620).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  5 13:30:24 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.6.18:
  + Added Catalan Accounts for the New Account Assistant.
  + Fixed errors from loading init.py.
  + Run the python bindings tests in a CMake build.
  + Implement dist, distcheck, and uninstall targets for CMake
    build.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#644898, bgo#647805, bgo#771246, bgo#784284,
    bgo#787479.
  + Updated transactions.
- Change Source url to one that works correctly with source
  services: the previous url was downloading a tarball called
  "download"; in addition, the new url is also less clumsy
  looking.
- Upstream tarball is tagged 2.6.18-1; however, the configure.ac
  as well as the versioned directory in the tarball refer to the
  version as 2.6.18, so use this as the Version in the spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 23:36:04 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.6.17:
  + Properly define the template namespace rather than using a
    local string everywhere.
  + Correctly store time64 0 in the SQL backend: The SQL backend
    ignored time64 0 when saving dates. time64 is a perfectly valid
    timestamp (1970-01-01 00:00:00) and should be stored.
  + Clamp time64 values passed to GDateTime functions to the valid
    range. Fixes a bug reported on the mailing list wherein a date
    of 0000-00-00 in a MySql database would crash GnuCash. Such
    dates may come from a bad conversion of 1970-01-01 or from a
    crash.
  + Add XSU to iso-4217-currencies.
  + Some banks include additional purpose information for a
    transaction in non-swift-section 17 (aka transaction text). If
    available, this transaction text is put in front of the other
    purpose texts to provide full transaction information. Adds a
    preference to control import behaivour of transaction text.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#603379, bgo#776396, bgo#780845, bgo#780889,
    bgo#781634, bgo#782274, bgo#782897, bgo#783095, bgo#784317.

  + SX - Recalculate all occurrences of all SX if the calendar is
    updated to start on another month.

Sat Jan  4 16:54:42 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.6.0 (bnc#858502):
  + New Major release, see
    http://gnucash.org/2.6-release-tour.phtml for a tour through
    the new features.
  + Preferences have been migrated from GConf to GSettings.
  + New date handling which allows GnuCash to use dates after March
    2038.
  + Guile-2 compatibility: GnuCash now requires either Guile-1.8 or
    Guile-2.0.
  + Documents outside of GnuCash, images of receipts for example,
    can now be linked to transactions, with the facility of opening
    them in the default application for the document type.
  + Cutsom Reports can now be saved without renaming the report,
    and modifications can overwrite an existing report.
  + The import assistant now finishes much more quickly after
    assigning contra-accounts.
  + GnuCash now requires Gtk+-2.24.0 and GLib-2.26.0. Most of the
    dependencies on obsolete libraries have been removed; only
    libgnomecanvas remains. Unfortunately the effort to rewrite
    the register code to use GtkTreeModel wasn't completed in time,
    so GnuCash is not on the cusp of converting to Gtk3.
  + The Business Module has been substantially revamped, including
    support for Credit Notes and import of customers and vendors
    from a CSV file.
  + The Num field in the register display is now optionally
    per-split, so for example a check number can be entered for the
    checking account split and an invoice number for the expense
    account split.
  + GnuCash can now open locked books read-only so that more than
    one user can view a file. GnuCash still does not support
    multiple simultaneous writers.
  + By agreement of all authors, GnuCash is now licensed under the
    GNU General Public License Version 2 or later rather than
    simply Version 2. This allows derivative works to be licensed
    under the GPL Version 3 if the author of such a work so
    desires.
  + Many bugfixes.
  + Updated translations.
- Update License tag to GPL-2.0+, following upstreams relicensing.
- Add %glib2_gsettings_schema_* macros for schema handling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 21 10:24:05 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add gnucash-tip-of-the-day.patch: Fix "Tip of the day" parsing
  when building with gcc 4.7: When making the text file
  tips-of-the-day, GnuCash expects 'gcc -E' to preserve at least
  one of the whitespace lines between entries. However, this relies
  on behavior of 'gcc -E' that isn't actually part of the spec,
  and is a historical accident. And it changed in gcc-4.7, such
  that all the whitespace is removed. Work around this by
  explicitly adding a newline in the sed expression. Pre gcc-4.7
  there will be two newlines between tips, but this has no impact
  on the tip displaying code.

  Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>.
- Update to version 2.3.17:
  + Major new features in the 2.3.x branch:
    - A SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL database to store the data can
      be used as backend, instead of the default XML backend. It
      requires libdbi.
    - WebKit can be used instead of GtkHTML to display reports and
      graphs.
      reports/charts with the WebKit engine used by Apple's Safari
      and Google's Chrome web browsers.

    data, to not save password data in history.

  + For a full list of changes, see NEWS.
- Remove no longer needed BuildRequires: glib2-devel, graphviz,
  ktoblzcheck-devel, libchipcard-devel, libgnomeprintui-devel,
  popt-devel, postgresql-devel and swig.
- Update BuildRequires to use the pkgconfig() way:
  + Old ones: aqbanking-devel, gconf2-devel, goffice-devel,
    gtk2-devel, libglade2-devel, libgnomeui-devel, libxml2-devel.
  + New pkgconfig() ones: aqbanking, gconf-2.0, gdk-pixbuf-2.0,
    gtk+-2.0, gwengui-gtk2, gwenhywfar, libglade-2.0,
    libgnomeui-2.0, libgoffice-0.8, libxml-2.0.

  configure. Also change gtkhtml2-devel Requires of devel package
  to libwebkitgtk-devel.
- Drop gnucash-latest-goffice.patch: fixed upstream.

  libofx-devel, libtool, popt-devel.
- Add libguile-devel Requires to devel package.
- Add --disable-dbi to configure: until libdbi enters Factory, we
  cannot build the sql backend. The default is still the xml
  backend upstream, so it's not a big issue at the moment.
- Remove --with-qt3-wizard-package configure option: we use a new
  aqbanking that doesn't come with this anymore.
- Remove no longer supported parameters --enable-aqbanking-test and
  --enable-sql from configure.
- Remove GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED=no and aclocal call from the build
  section.
- Do not install update-gnucash-gconf: it's not needed in a
  package, as it only installs gconf schemas.
