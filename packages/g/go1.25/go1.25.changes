Tue Aug 12 20:50:10 UTC 2025 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- go1.25 (released 2025-08-12) is a major release of Go.
  go1.25.x minor releases will be provided through August 2026.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.25 arrives six months after Go 1.24. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
  Refs boo#1244485 go1.25 release tracking
  * Language changes: There are no languages changes that affect Go
    programs in Go 1.25. However, in the language specification the
    notion of core types has been removed in favor of dedicated
    prose. See the respective blog post for more information.
  * go command: The go build -asan option now defaults to doing
    leak detection at program exit. This will report an error if
    memory allocated by C is not freed and is not referenced by any
    other memory allocated by either C or Go. These new error
    reports may be disabled by setting ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0
    in the environment when running the program.
  * go command: The Go distribution will include fewer prebuilt
    tool binaries. Core toolchain binaries such as the compiler and
    linker will still be included, but tools not invoked by build
    or test operations will be built and run by go tool as needed.
  * go command: The new go.mod ignore directive can be used to
    specify directories the go command should ignore. Files in
    these directories and their subdirectories will be ignored by
    the go command when matching package patterns, such as all or
    ./..., but will still be included in module zip files.
  * go command: The new go doc -http option will start a
    documentation server showing documentation for the requested
    object, and open the documentation in a browser window.
  * go command: The new go version -m -json option will print the
    JSON encodings of the runtime/debug.BuildInfo structures
    embedded in the given Go binary files.
  * go command: The go command now supports using a subdirectory of
    a repository as the path for a module root, when resolving a
    module path using the syntax <meta name="go-import"
    content="root-path vcs repo-url subdir"> to indicate that the
    root-path corresponds to the subdir of the repo-url with
    version control system vcs.
  * go command: The new work package pattern matches all packages
    in the work (formerly called main) modules: either the single
    work module in module mode or the set of workspace modules in
    workspace mode.
  * go command: When the go command updates the go line in a go.mod
    or go.work file, it no longer adds a toolchain line specifying
    the command’s current version.
  * go vet: The go vet command includes new analyzers:
  * go vet: waitgroup reports misplaced calls to
    sync.WaitGroup.Add;
  * go vet: hostport reports uses of fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", host,
    port) to construct addresses for net.Dial, as these will not
    work with IPv6; instead it suggests using net.JoinHostPort.
  * Runtime: Container-aware GOMAXPROCS. The default behavior of
    the GOMAXPROCS has changed. In prior versions of Go, GOMAXPROCS
    defaults to the number of logical CPUs available at startup
    (runtime.NumCPU). Go 1.25 introduces two changes: On Linux, the
    runtime considers the CPU bandwidth limit of the cgroup
    containing the process, if any. If the CPU bandwidth limit is
    lower than the number of logical CPUs available, GOMAXPROCS
    will default to the lower limit. In container runtime systems
    like Kubernetes, cgroup CPU bandwidth limits generally
    correspond to the “CPU limit” option. The Go runtime does not
    consider the “CPU requests” option.  On all OSes, the runtime
    periodically updates GOMAXPROCS if the number of logical CPUs
    available or the cgroup CPU bandwidth limit change.  Both of
    these behaviors are automatically disabled if GOMAXPROCS is set
    manually via the GOMAXPROCS environment variable or a call to
    runtime.GOMAXPROCS. They can also be disabled explicitly with
    the GODEBUG settings containermaxprocs=0 and updatemaxprocs=0,
    respectively.  In order to support reading updated cgroup
    limits, the runtime will keep cached file descriptors for the
    cgroup files for the duration of the process lifetime.
  * Runtime: garbage collector: A new garbage collector is now
    available as an experiment. This garbage collector’s design
    improves the performance of marking and scanning small objects
    through better locality and CPU scalability. Benchmark result
    vary, but we expect somewhere between a 10—40% reduction in
    garbage collection overhead in real-world programs that heavily
    use the garbage collector.  The new garbage collector may be
    enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=greenteagc at build time. We
    expect the design to continue to evolve and improve. To that
    end, we encourage Go developers to try it out and report back
    their experiences. See the GitHub issue for more details on the
    design and instructions for sharing feedback.
  * Runtime: trace flight recorder: Runtime execution traces have
    long provided a powerful, but expensive way to understand and
    debug the low-level behavior of an application. Unfortunately,
    because of their size and the cost of continuously writing an
    execution trace, they were generally impractical for debugging
    rare events.  The new runtime/trace.FlightRecorder API provides
    a lightweight way to capture a runtime execution trace by
    continuously recording the trace into an in-memory ring
    buffer. When a significant event occurs, a program can call
    FlightRecorder.WriteTo to snapshot the last few seconds of the
    trace to a file. This approach produces a much smaller trace by
    enabling applications to capture only the traces that matter.
    The length of time and amount of data captured by a
    FlightRecorder may be configured within the
    FlightRecorderConfig.
  * Runtime: Change to unhandled panic output: The message printed
    when a program exits due to an unhandled panic that was
    recovered and repanicked no longer repeats the text of the
    panic value.
  * Runtime: VMA names on Linux: On Linux systems with kernel
    support for anonymous virtual memory area (VMA) names
    (CONFIG_ANON_VMA_NAME), the Go runtime will annotate anonymous
    memory mappings with context about their purpose. e.g., [anon:
    Go: heap] for heap memory. This can be disabled with the
    GODEBUG setting decoratemappings=0.
  * Compiler: nil pointer bug: This release fixes a compiler bug,
    introduced in Go 1.21, that could incorrectly delay nil pointer
    checks.
  * Compiler: DWARF5 support: The compiler and linker in Go 1.25
    now generate debug information using DWARF version 5. The newer
    DWARF version reduces the space required for debugging
    information in Go binaries, and reduces the time for linking,
    especially for large Go binaries. DWARF 5 generation can be
    disabled by setting the environment variable
    GOEXPERIMENT=nodwarf5 at build time (this fallback may be
    removed in a future Go release).
  * Compiler: Faster slices: The compiler can now allocate the
    backing store for slices on the stack in more situations, which
    improves performance. This change has the potential to amplify
    the effects of incorrect unsafe.Pointer usage, see for example
    issue 73199. In order to track down these problems, the bisect
    tool can be used to find the allocation causing trouble using
    the -compile=variablemake flag. All such new stack allocations
    can also be turned off using
    -gcflags=all=-d=variablemakehash=n.
  * Linker: The linker now accepts a -funcalign=N command line
    option, which specifies the alignment of function entries. The
    default value is platform-dependent, and is unchanged in this
    release.
  * Standard library: testing/synctest: The new testing/synctest
    package provides support for testing concurrent code. This
    package was first available in Go 1.24 under
    GOEXPERIMENT=synctest, with a slightly different API. The
    experiment has now graduated to general availability. The old
    API is still present if GOEXPERIMENT=synctest is set, but will
    be removed in Go 1.26.
  * Standard library: testing/synctest: The Test function runs a
    test function in an isolated “bubble”. Within the bubble, time
    is virtualized: time package functions operate on a fake clock
    and the clock moves forward instantaneously if all goroutines
    in the bubble are blocked.
  * Standard library: testing/synctest: The Wait function waits for
    all goroutines in the current bubble to block.
  * Standard library: encoding/json/v2: Go 1.25 includes a new,
    experimental JSON implementation, which can be enabled by
    setting the environment variable GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 at build
    time. When enabled, two new packages are available: The
    encoding/json/v2 package is a major revision of the
    encoding/json package. The encoding/json/jsontext package
    provides lower-level processing of JSON syntax. In addition,
    when the “jsonv2” GOEXPERIMENT is enabled: The encoding/json
    package uses the new JSON implementation. Marshaling and
    unmarshaling behavior is unaffected, but the text of errors
    returned by package function may change. The encoding/json
    package contains a number of new options which may be used to
    configure the marshaler and unmarshaler. The new implementation
    performs substantially better than the existing one under many
    scenarios. In general, encoding performance is at parity
    between the implementations and decoding is substantially
    faster in the new one. See the
    github.com/go-json-experiment/jsonbench repository for more
    detailed analysis. We encourage users of encoding/json to test
    their programs with GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 enabled to help detect
    any compatibility issues with the new implementation. We expect
    the design of encoding/json/v2 to continue to evolve. We
    encourage developers to try out the new API and provide
    feedback on the proposal issue.
  * archive/tar: The Writer.AddFS implementation now supports
    symbolic links for filesystems that implement io/fs.ReadLinkFS.
  * encoding/asn1: Unmarshal and UnmarshalWithParams now parse the
    ASN.1 types T61String and BMPString more consistently. This may
    result in some previously accepted malformed encodings now
    being rejected.
  * crypto: MessageSigner is a new signing interface that can be
    implemented by signers that wish to hash the message to be
    signed themselves. A new function is also introduced,
    SignMessage, which attempts to upgrade a Signer interface to
    MessageSigner, using the MessageSigner.SignMessage method if
    successful, and Signer.Sign if not. This can be used when code
    wishes to support both Signer and MessageSigner.
  * crypto: Changing the fips140 GODEBUG setting after the program
    has started is now a no-op. Previously, it was documented as
    not allowed, and could cause a panic if changed.
  * crypto: SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 are now slower on amd64
    when AVX2 instructions are not available. All server processors
    (and most others) produced since 2015 support AVX2.
  * crypto/ecdsa: The new ParseRawPrivateKey,
    ParseUncompressedPublicKey, PrivateKey.Bytes, and
    PublicKey.Bytes functions and methods implement low-level
    encodings, replacing the need to use crypto/elliptic or
    math/big functions and methods.
  * crypto/ecdsa: When FIPS 140-3 mode is enabled, signing is now
    four times faster, matching the performance of non-FIPS mode.
  * crypto/ed25519: When FIPS 140-3 mode is enabled, signing is now
    four times faster, matching the performance of non-FIPS mode.
  * crypto/elliptic: The hidden and undocumented Inverse and
    CombinedMult methods on some Curve implementations have been
    removed.
  * crypto/rsa: PublicKey no longer claims that the modulus value
    is treated as secret. VerifyPKCS1v15 and VerifyPSS already
    warned that all inputs are public and could be leaked, and
    there are mathematical attacks that can recover the modulus
    from other public values.
  * crypto/rsa: Key generation is now three times faster.
  * crypto/sha1: Hashing is now two times faster on amd64 when
    SHA-NI instructions are available.
  * crypto/sha3: The new SHA3.Clone method implements hash.Cloner.
  * crypto/sha3: Hashing is now two times faster on Apple M
    processors.
  * crypto/tls: The new ConnectionState.CurveID field exposes the
    key exchange mechanism used to establish the connection.
  * crypto/tls: The new Config.GetEncryptedClientHelloKeys callback
    can be used to set the EncryptedClientHelloKeys for a server to
    use when a client sends an Encrypted Client Hello extension.
  * crypto/tls: SHA-1 signature algorithms are now disallowed in
    TLS 1.2 handshakes, per RFC 9155. They can be re-enabled with
    the GODEBUG setting tlssha1=1.
  * crypto/tls: When FIPS 140-3 mode is enabled, Extended Master
    Secret is now required in TLS 1.2, and Ed25519 and
    X25519MLKEM768 are now allowed.
  * crypto/tls: TLS servers now prefer the highest supported
    protocol version, even if it isn’t the client’s most preferred
    protocol version.
  * crypto/tls: Both TLS clients and servers are now stricter in
    following the specifications and in rejecting off-spec
    behavior. Connections with compliant peers should be
    unaffected.
  * crypto/x509: CreateCertificate, CreateCertificateRequest, and
    CreateRevocationList can now accept a crypto.MessageSigner
    signing interface as well as crypto.Signer. This allows these
    functions to use signers which implement “one-shot” signing
    interfaces, where hashing is done as part of the signing
    operation, instead of by the caller.
  * crypto/x509: CreateCertificate now uses truncated SHA-256 to
    populate the SubjectKeyId if it is missing. The GODEBUG setting
    x509sha256skid=0 reverts to SHA-1.
  * crypto/x509: ParseCertificate now rejects certificates which
    contain a BasicConstraints extension that contains a negative
    pathLenConstraint.
  * crypto/x509: ParseCertificate now handles strings encoded with
    the ASN.1 T61String and BMPString types more consistently. This
    may result in some previously accepted malformed encodings now
    being rejected.
  * debug/elf: The debug/elf package adds two new constants:
    PT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES and SHT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES for RISC-V ELF
    parsing.
  * go/ast: The FilterPackage, PackageExports, and
    MergePackageFiles functions, and the MergeMode type and its
    constants, are all deprecated, as they are for use only with
    the long-deprecated Object and Package machinery.
  * go/ast: The new PreorderStack function, like Inspect, traverses
    a syntax tree and provides control over descent into subtrees,
    but as a convenience it also provides the stack of enclosing
    nodes at each point.
  * go/parser: The ParseDir function is deprecated.
  * go/token: The new FileSet.AddExistingFiles method enables
    existing Files to be added to a FileSet, or a FileSet to be
    constructed for an arbitrary set of Files, alleviating the
    problems associated with a single global FileSet in long-lived
    applications.
  * go/types: Var now has a Var.Kind method that classifies the
    variable as one of: package-level, receiver, parameter, result,
    local variable, or a struct field.
  * go/types: The new LookupSelection function looks up the field
    or method of a given name and receiver type, like the existing
    LookupFieldOrMethod function, but returns the result in the
    form of a Selection.
  * hash: The new XOF interface can be implemented by “extendable
    output functions”, which are hash functions with arbitrary or
    unlimited output length such as SHAKE.
  * hash: Hashes implementing the new Cloner interface can return a
    copy of their state. All standard library Hash implementations
    now implement Cloner.
  * hash/maphash: The new Hash.Clone method implements hash.Cloner.
  * io/fs: A new ReadLinkFS interface provides the ability to read
    symbolic links in a filesystem.
  * log/slog: GroupAttrs creates a group Attr from a slice of Attr
    values.
  * log/slog: Record now has a Source method, returning its source
    location or nil if unavailable.
  * mime/multipart: The new helper function FileContentDisposition
    builds multipart Content-Disposition header fields.
  * net: LookupMX and Resolver.LookupMX now return DNS names that
    look like valid IP address, as well as valid domain
    names. Previously if a name server returned an IP address as a
    DNS name, LookupMX would discard it, as required by the
    RFCs. However, name servers in practice do sometimes return IP
    addresses.
  * net: On Windows, ListenMulticastUDP now supports IPv6
    addresses.
  * net: On Windows, it is now possible to convert between an
    os.File and a network connection. Specifcally, the FileConn,
    FilePacketConn, and FileListener functions are now implemented,
    and return a network connection or listener corresponding to an
    open file. Similarly, the File methods of TCPConn, UDPConn,
    UnixConn, IPConn, TCPListener, and UnixListener are now
    implemented, and return the underlying os.File of a network
    connection.
  * net/http: The new CrossOriginProtection implements protections
    against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by rejecting non-safe
    cross-origin browser requests. It uses modern browser Fetch
    metadata, doesn’t require tokens or cookies, and supports
    origin-based and pattern-based bypasses.
  * os: On Windows, NewFile now supports handles opened for
    asynchronous I/O (that is, syscall.FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED is
    specified in the syscall.CreateFile call). These handles are
    associated with the Go runtime’s I/O completion port, which
    provides the following benefits for the resulting File: I/O
    methods (File.Read, File.Write, File.ReadAt, and File.WriteAt)
    do not block an OS thread. Deadline methods (File.SetDeadline,
    File.SetReadDeadline, and File.SetWriteDeadline) are
    supported. This enhancement is especially beneficial for
    applications that communicate via named pipes on Windows. Note
    that a handle can only be associated with one completion port
    at a time. If the handle provided to NewFile is already
    associated with a completion port, the returned File is
    downgraded to synchronous I/O mode. In this case, I/O methods
    will block an OS thread, and the deadline methods have no
    effect.
  * os: The filesystems returned by DirFS and Root.FS implement the
    new io/fs.ReadLinkFS interface. CopyFS supports symlinks when
    copying filesystems that implement io/fs.ReadLinkFS. The Root
    type supports the following additional methods: Root.Chmod,
    Root.Chown, Root.Chtimes, Root.Lchown, Root.Link,
    Root.MkdirAll, Root.ReadFile, Root.Readlink, Root.RemoveAll,
    Root.Rename, Root.Symlink, and Root.WriteFile.
  * reflect: The new TypeAssert function permits converting a Value
    directly to a Go value of the given type. This is like using a
    type assertion on the result of Value.Interface, but avoids
    unnecessary memory allocations.
  * regexp/syntax: The \p{name} and \P{name} character class
    syntaxes now accept the names Any, ASCII, Assigned, Cn, and LC,
    as well as Unicode category aliases like \p{Letter} for
    \pL. Following Unicode TR18, they also now use case-insensitive
    name lookups, ignoring spaces, underscores, and hyphens.
  * runtime: Cleanup functions scheduled by AddCleanup are now
    executed concurrently and in parallel, making cleanups more
    viable for heavy use like the unique package. Note that
    individual cleanups should still shunt their work to a new
    goroutine if they must execute or block for a long time to
    avoid blocking the cleanup queue.
  * runtime: A new GODEBUG=checkfinalizers=1 setting helps find
    common issues with finalizers and cleanups, such as those
    described in the GC guide. In this mode, the runtime runs
    diagnostics on each garbage collection cycle, and will also
    regularly report the finalizer and cleanup queue lengths to
    stderr to help identify issues with long-running finalizers
    and/or cleanups. See the GODEBUG documentation for more
    details.
  * runtime: The new SetDefaultGOMAXPROCS function sets GOMAXPROCS
    to the runtime default value, as if the GOMAXPROCS environment
    variable is not set. This is useful for enabling the new
    GOMAXPROCS default if it has been disabled by the GOMAXPROCS
    environment variable or a prior call to GOMAXPROCS.
  * runtime/pprof: The mutex profile for contention on
    runtime-internal locks now correctly points to the end of the
    critical section that caused the delay. This matches the
    profile’s behavior for contention on sync.Mutex values. The
    runtimecontentionstacks setting for GODEBUG, which allowed
    opting in to the unusual behavior of Go 1.22 through 1.24 for
    this part of the profile, is now gone.
  * sync: The new WaitGroup.Go method makes the common pattern of
    creating and counting goroutines more convenient.
  * testing: The new methods T.Attr, B.Attr, and F.Attr emit an
    attribute to the test log. An attribute is an arbitrary key and
    value associated with a test.
  * testing: With the -json flag, attributes appear as a new “attr”
    action.
  * testing: The new Output method of T, B and F provides an
    io.Writer that writes to the same test output stream as
    TB.Log. Like TB.Log, the output is indented, but it does not
    include the file and line number.
  * testing: The AllocsPerRun function now panics if parallel tests
    are running. The result of AllocsPerRun is inherently flaky if
    other tests are running. The new panicking behavior helps catch
    such bugs.
  * testing/fstest: MapFS implements the new io/fs.ReadLinkFS
    interface. TestFS will verify the functionality of the
    io/fs.ReadLinkFS interface if implemented. TestFS will no
    longer follow symlinks to avoid unbounded recursion.
  * unicode: The new CategoryAliases map provides access to
    category alias names, such as “Letter” for “L”.
  * unicode: The new categories Cn and LC define unassigned
    codepoints and cased letters, respectively. These have always
    been defined by Unicode but were inadvertently omitted in
    earlier versions of Go. The C category now includes Cn, meaning
    it has added all unassigned code points.
  * unique: The unique package now reclaims interned values more
    eagerly, more efficiently, and in parallel. As a consequence,
    applications using Make are now less likely to experience
    memory blow-up when lots of truly unique values are interned.
  * unique: Values passed to Make containing Handles previously
    required multiple garbage collection cycles to collect,
    proportional to the depth of the chain of Handle values. Now,
    once unused, they are collected promptly in a single cycle.
  * Darwin port: As announced in the Go 1.24 release notes, Go 1.25
    requires macOS 12 Monterey or later. Support for previous
    versions has been discontinued.
  * Windows port: Go 1.25 is the last release that contains the
    broken 32-bit windows/arm port (GOOS=windows GOARCH=arm). It
    will be removed in Go 1.26.
  * Loong64 port: The linux/loong64 port now supports the race
    detector, gathering traceback information from C code using
    runtime.SetCgoTraceback, and linking cgo programs with the
    internal link mode.
  * RISC-V port: The linux/riscv64 port now supports the plugin
    build mode.
  * RISC-V port: The GORISCV64 environment variable now accepts a
    new value rva23u64, which selects the RVA23U64 user-mode
    application profile.
