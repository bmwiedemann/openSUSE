    <comment>- go1.25 (released 2025-08-12) is a major release of Go.
  go1.25.x minor releases will be provided through August 2026.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.25 arrives six months after Go 1.24. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.

  * Language changes: There are no languages changes that affect Go
    programs in Go 1.25. However, in the language specification the
    notion of core types has been removed in favor of dedicated
    prose. See the respective blog post for more information.
  * go command: The go build -asan option now defaults to doing
    leak detection at program exit. This will report an error if
    memory allocated by C is not freed and is not referenced by any
    other memory allocated by either C or Go. These new error
    reports may be disabled by setting ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0
    in the environment when running the program.
  * go command: The Go distribution will include fewer prebuilt
    tool binaries. Core toolchain binaries such as the compiler and
    linker will still be included, but tools not invoked by build
    or test operations will be built and run by go tool as needed.
  * go command: The new go.mod ignore directive can be used to
    specify directories the go command should ignore. Files in
    these directories and their subdirectories will be ignored by
    the go command when matching package patterns, such as all or
    ./..., but will still be included in module zip files.
  * go command: The new go doc -http option will start a
    documentation server showing documentation for the requested</comment>
