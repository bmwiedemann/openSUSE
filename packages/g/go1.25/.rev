    <comment>- go1.25 (released 2025-08-12) is a major release of Go.
  go1.25.x minor releases will be provided through August 2026.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.25 arrives six months after Go 1.24. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
  Refs boo#1244485 go1.25 release tracking
  * Language changes: There are no languages changes that affect Go
    programs in Go 1.25. However, in the language specification the
    notion of core types has been removed in favor of dedicated
    prose. See the respective blog post for more information.
  * go command: The go build -asan option now defaults to doing
    leak detection at program exit. This will report an error if
    memory allocated by C is not freed and is not referenced by any
    other memory allocated by either C or Go. These new error
    reports may be disabled by setting ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0
    in the environment when running the program.
  * go command: The Go distribution will include fewer prebuilt
    tool binaries. Core toolchain binaries such as the compiler and
    linker will still be included, but tools not invoked by build
    or test operations will be built and run by go tool as needed.
  * go command: The new go.mod ignore directive can be used to
    specify directories the go command should ignore. Files in
    these directories and their subdirectories will be ignored by
    the go command when matching package patterns, such as all or
    ./..., but will still be included in module zip files.
  * go command: The new go doc -http option will start a
    documentation server showing documentation for the requested</comment>

    <comment>- go1.25.1 (released 2025-09-03) includes security fixes to the
  net/http package, as well as bug fixes to the go command, and the
  net, os, os/exec, and testing/synctest packages.

  CVE-2025-47910
  * go#75160 go#75054 boo#1249141 security: fix CVE-2025-47910 net/http: CrossOriginProtection insecure bypass patterns not limited to exact matches
  * go#74822 cmd/go: &quot;get toolchain@latest&quot; should ignore release candidates
  * go#74999 net: WriteMsgUDPAddrPort should accept IPv4-mapped IPv6 destination addresses on IPv4 UDP sockets
  * go#75008 os/exec: TestLookPath fails on plan9 after CL 685755
  * go#75021 testing/synctest: bubble not terminating
  * go#75083 os: File.Seek doesn't set the correct offset with Windows overlapped handles

- Packaging improvements:
  * Remove conditional gccgo bootstrap sections and gcc-go.patch.
    gccgo cannot be used in any version newer than go1.21. Removal
    simplifies go1.x package code.
  * go1.21 can optionally be bootstrapped with gccgo and serve as
    the inital version of go1.x.
  * go1.21 will be the initial version of Go in the bootstrap chain
    until gcc gccgo is updated to support a language level newer
    than go1.18.
  * Drop gcc-go.patch
  * Refs boo#1247816 bootstrap go1.21 with gccgo
  * Refs boo#1248082 drop unused gccgo bootstrap code in go1.22+</comment>
