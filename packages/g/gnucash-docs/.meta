  <title>Documentation Module for GnuCash</title>
  <description>GnuCash is a personal finance manager. A check-book likeregister GUI
allows you to enter and track bank accounts, stocks, income and even
currency trades. The interface is designed to be simple and easy to
use, but is backed with double-entry accounting principles to ensure
balanced books. This is the documentation module for GnuCash.</description>
