  <description>The GLE Tubing and Extrusion Library is a graphics application
programming interface (API). The library consists of a number of C
language subroutines for drawing tubing and extrusions. The library is
distributed in source code form in a package that includes
documentation, a VRML proposal, make files, and full source code and
header files. It uses the OpenGL (TM) programming API to perform the
actual drawing of the tubing and extrusions.</description>
