- Update to version 4.3:
  * Added the new Investigator rule family to the Super algorithm.
  * Adjusted Super conversion scripts to handle Investigator rules,
    including a new toInvestigator.lua conversion script that will
    be mapped by default to Alt+I whenever Golly creates a new
    GollyPrefs file.
  * Minor improvements to error-checking and recovery in
    toHistory.lua and toSuper.lua conversion scripts.
  * Various changes to the RLE parsing code, mainly for consistency
    with LifeViewer..
  * Fixed a crash by limiting the scale to no more than 2^(2^20)
    cells per pixel.
  * Fixed a bug that affected all multi-state hashlife algorithms
    (changing a cell in a very large pattern could result in a
    corrupted universe).
  * Fixed some bugs handling filenames with underscores or
    ampersands in the Open/Run Recent submenus.
  * Fixed orientation of Custom neighborhood in the Larger than
    Life algorithm.
  * Fixed an assertion in progress bar update when downloading a
    file from a web server using gzip compression.
  * Better support for .rule files with very long lines. An error
    message is now displayed if a line exceeds the maximum length of
    4,000 characters.
  * The Pattern Info window displays Unicode characters correctly
    (assuming the comments are UTF-8 encoded).
  * 3D.lua has a Pattern Info command (in its View menu) which will
    display the current pattern's comments in the help window. You
    can also click on the new "i" button.
  * The Larger than Life algorithm now supports Aligned Checkerboard
    neighborhood (ND).
  * New script safeopenclip.lua will attempt to open the clipboard
    as a pattern.
  * Modified goto.lua to check for a number too large for Lua (if
    so then the script exits and recommends using goto.py instead).
  * File > Run Clipboard displays a nicer error message if the
    clipboard doesn't contain Lua/Python code.
  * Removed optional support for Perl.
  * Updated Lua to version 5.4.6.
  * Added a query command (for Lua or Python) that displays a
    modal dialog with customizable button labels.
  * Lots of new patterns.
  * Reformatted and renamed many Larger than Life and Generations
    patterns to use Golly native HROT format and/or an .rle
    extension instead of .mcl.
  * Deleted pattern: oscillator-stamp-collection-12August2022.rle
    (replaced by oscillator-stamp-collection-31January2023.rle).
  * The comments in a large number of existing patterns have been
    modified (broken links deleted or fixed, and the formatting of
    paragraphs made more consistent).
  * Added new rules required by some of the new patterns.

- Trim unquantified wording from descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 27 20:59:46 UTC 2023 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.2:
  * Fixed a bug in script commands like g.setpos that accept
    integers as strings.
  * Fixed a number of bugs that could result in an "illegal
    operation while calculating" warning.
  * Performance improvements to Larger than Life NL (Triangular)
    and NB (Checkerboard) rules.
  * Updated Lua to version 5.4.4.
  * Added support for https links when downloading files from
    online archives.
  * New patterns, mostly in OCA (non-Conway's Life) rules, plus
    updates to Life stamp collections.
  * Moved/renamed whiteboard-17c2415-spaceship.rle,
    sierpinski-builder.rle, wolfram22.mc.
  * Reorganized patterns in HashLife folder into subfolders
    "Construction", "Eventful", and "Metacell".
  * Links and dates in many pattern comments updated to standard
    format.
- Changes of versions 4.1, 4.0, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 2.8, 2.7:
  See https://golly.sourceforge.net/Help/changes.html.
- Drop Perl dependencies: Perl scripting has been replaced by Lua
  scripting. golly is built against a patched version of Lua
  included in sources.
- Modify desktop file to run with GDK_BACKEND=x11: Allow to run the
  application built against wxWidgets without EGL support.
- Refreshed spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 19 08:37:00 UTC 2014 - avvissu@yandex.ru

- Create sub-package golly-devel-static to provide the static
  library needed for shared builds and to fix compilation on
  Fedora.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 19 05:55:57 UTC 2014 - avvissu@yandex.ru

- Add and package desktop file
- Delete golly-zlib.patch
  + Set ZLIB_LDFLAGS in %{build} instead
- Fix rpmlint error: devel-file-in-non-devel-package
  + Create package golly-devel to package all devel files 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 18 00:09:43 UTC 2014 - avvissu@yandex.ru

- Update to 2.6 for openSUSE and Fedora:
  * Fixed a nasty bug that could cause Golly to crash when doing a
    paste. 
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the paste image to disappear after
    a flip/rotate. 
  * Tool bar buttons are no longer disabled when the main window is
    inactive. 
  * The save settings in Preferences > Layer are now obeyed by
    scripts. For example, let's assume you've ticked the option to
    be asked to save changes on creating a new pattern. If the
    current layer has changes and you run a script that calls
    new() then you'll get the standard dialog asking if you want
    to save those changes. If you cancel the dialog then the script
    is aborted. 
  * To avoid potential data loss, you now get a warning if you save
    a non-starting generation and earlier changes exist. The
    warning can be disabled in Preferences > Layer. 
  * Created an online archive for very large patterns.
