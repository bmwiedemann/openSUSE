Tue Mar 18 00:09:43 UTC 2014 - avvissu@yandex.ru

- Update to 2.6 for openSUSE and Fedora:
  * Fixed a nasty bug that could cause Golly to crash when doing a
    paste. 
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the paste image to disappear after
    a flip/rotate. 
  * Tool bar buttons are no longer disabled when the main window is
    inactive. 
  * The save settings in Preferences > Layer are now obeyed by
    scripts. For example, let's assume you've ticked the option to
    be asked to save changes on creating a new pattern. If the
    current layer has changes and you run a script that calls
    new() then you'll get the standard dialog asking if you want
    to save those changes. If you cancel the dialog then the script
    is aborted. 
  * To avoid potential data loss, you now get a warning if you save
    a non-starting generation and earlier changes exist. The
    warning can be disabled in Preferences > Layer. 
  * Created an online archive for very large patterns.
