%description
This package defines the type class 'MonadBaseControl', a subset of 'MonadBase'
into which generic control operations such as 'catch' can be lifted from 'IO'
or any other base monad. Instances are based on monad transformers in
'MonadTransControl', which includes all standard monad transformers in the
'transformers' library except 'ContT'.

See the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lifted-base lifted-base> package
which uses 'monad-control' to lift 'IO' operations from the 'base' library
(like 'catch' or 'bracket') into any monad that is an instance of 'MonadBase'
or 'MonadBaseControl'.

Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's 'monad-peel' library.
The main difference is that this package provides CPS style operators and
exploits the 'RankNTypes' and 'TypeFamilies' language extensions to simplify
and speedup most definitions.
