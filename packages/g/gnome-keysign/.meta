  <title>GNOME OpenGPG key signing helper</title>
  <description>Its purpose is to ease signing other peoples' keys. It is similar
to caff, PIUS, or monkeysign. In fact, it is influenced a lot by
these tools and either reimplements ideas or reuses code.
Consider either of the aboved mentioned tools when you need a much
more mature codebase.
