-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 14 08:35:04 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 3.1.1:
 * New Features
  * Quick open displays a combobox with predefined settings for Visual Studio Code, Atom and Sublime Text.
 * Bug Fixes
  * Fix hyperlink VTE
- update to version 3.1.0:
 * Release Summary
  * This version of Guake brings mostly bug fixes, and some new features like "Quick Open on selection".
    I have also reworked internally the Quick Open so that it can automatically open files from logs
    from pytest and other python development tools output. However, there might still some false
    positive on the hovering of the mouse in the terminal, the most famous being the output of ``ls -l``
    which may have the mouse looks like it sees hyperlinks on the terminal everywhere. Click does
    nothing but its an annoying limitation.
  * New Features:
   - New "start at login" option in the settings (only for GNOME) #251
   - Add ``--verbose``/``-v`` parameter to enable debug logging. Please note the existing ``-v`` (for
     version number) has been renamed ``-V``.
   - Support for hyperlink VTE extension (`described
     here <https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda>`__ ) #945 (Untested, as
     it requires VTE 0.50)
   - Add great color palettes from `Guake Color
     Scheme <https://github.com/ziyenano/Guake-Color-Schemes>
   - Allow application to capture right click (ex: Midnight commander). #1096. It is still possible to
     show the contextual menu with Shift+right click.
  * Bug Fixes:
   - delete tab even without libutempter (#1198)
   - Fix crash when changing command file #1229
   - fix ``import sys`` in ``simplegladeapp.py``
   - change scope of ``which_align`` variable in ``pref.py`` (#1225)
   - Fix user interface translations #1228
   - Fix several issues on Quick Edit:
   - There might be broken translations, or not up-to-date language support by Guake. A global refresh
     of all existing translations would be welcomed. Most has not been updated since the transition to
     Guake 3, so these languages support might probably be unfunctional or at least partialy
     localized.
- remove fix-simplegladeapp.patch, merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 30 18:27:32 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at
