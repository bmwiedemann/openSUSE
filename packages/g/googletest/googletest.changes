- Remove errant backslahes from description.
- Rewrite summaries without em dashes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 16 11:06:17 UTC 2018 - adam.majer@suse.de

- Update to version 1.8.1:
  * add pkg-config files
  * add --no_stacktrace_support for json-output-unittest
  * allow macros inside of parametrized test names.
  * support JSON output format in addition to XML
  * add options to parallelize builds
  * fix double free when building Gtest/GMock in shared libraries
    and linking a test executable with both.
  * 2.6.4 is the minimum CMake version
- cleanup spec file
- googletest-fix-cmake-libdir-install.patch: dropped, upstreamed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 30 00:13:00 CET 2017 - tiwai@suse.de

- Fix the source (and put the download URL as a comment) for
  matching with the actual tarball file name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 16 18:55:22 UTC 2017 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  * Update the value of GTEST_DIR to reflect the googletest dir.
  * Change the GTestDir marco value to reflect the new dir of
    googletest.
  * Read Bazel's $XML_OUTPUT_FILE environment variable
  * Restructure:
    - Test so each scenario is independent.
    - $XML_OUTPUT_FILE logic
  * Fixes:
    - Error C2440 'return' in gmock_test
      (gh#google/googletest#775).
    - Tests that return object which implement operator bool.
    - Operator precedence in GTEST_TEST_BOOLEAN_ with expressions
      that implement operator bool.
    - env_var_test to ignore XML_OUTPUT_FILE if already set.
    - Link that's returned when running tests
      (gh#google/googletest#714).
- Rework package turning it into a source package essencially, once
  its original intention is to provide source files for a testing
  framework, a pure development package itself. Aligning with
  upstream ease our job and avoid unexpected bugs.
- Drop libgtest0 and googletest-devel subpackages bringing gtest
  subpackage instead and obsoleting the previous ones, following
  the above change.
- Provide googlemock together with googletest now that upstream
  officially brought this project under gloogle's wings.
- Replace autoconf and automake BuildRequires by cmake and switch
  configure, make and make_install macros by cmake, cmake_jobs and
  cmake_install. Autotools are deprecated and cmake is recommended
  by upstream.
- Drop libtool BuildRequires and autoreconf call. With the adoption
  of cmake it's no longer need anymore.
- Drop googletest-enable-make-install.patch. No longer needed once
  make install is not used anymore.
- Add googletest-fix-cmake-libdir-install.patch for enabling the
  use of /usr/lib(64) instead of /usr/local/lib(64), once
  upstream's CMakeLists doesn't provide flexibility in this regard.
- Add googletest-rpmlintrc file to filter warnings about
  devel-file-in-non-devel-package, shlib-policy-missing-suffix and
  obsolete-not-provided as the package is a devel one itself now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 20 07:31:46 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update project and source url (now on github)
- Change library name, provides obsoletes should not be necessary
  as no released binary should link against it

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 28 13:29:29 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Correct typo in library name

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 27 18:04:48 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Use source url
- Package libraries as libgoogletest0
- Run tests when building

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  6 06:27:04 UTC 2014 - i@marguerite.su

- add patch: googletest-enable-make-install.patch
  * use standard procedure to install googletest.
- add scripts/gtest-config to installation
  * used by many programs to find gtest CFLAGS and etc.
- install shared libraries for sles too

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 11 00:46:53 UTC 2013 - i@marguerite.su

- update version 1.7.0
  * New feature: death tests are supported on OpenBSD and in iOS
    simulator now.
  * New feature: Google Test now implements a protocol to allow
    a test runner to detect that a test program has exited
    prematurely and report it as a failure (before it would be
    falsely reported as a success if the exit code is 0).
  * New feature: Test::RecordProperty() can now be used outside of the
    lifespan of a test method, in which case it will be attributed to
    the current test case or the test program in the XML report.
  * New feature (potentially breaking): --gtest_list_tests now prints
    the type parameters and value parameters for each test.
  * Improvement: char pointers and char arrays are now escaped properly
    in failure messages.
  * Improvement: failure summary in XML reports now includes file and
    line information.
  * Improvement: the <testsuites> XML element now has a timestamp attribute.
  * Improvement: When --gtest_filter is specified, XML report now doesn't
    contain information about tests that are filtered out.
  * Fixed the bug where long --gtest_filter flag values are truncated in
    death tests.
  * Potentially breaking change: RUN_ALL_TESTS() is now implemented as a
    function instead of a macro in order to work better with Clang.
  * Compatibility fixes with C++ 11 and various platforms.
  * Bug/warning fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- rename.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 12 13:27:39 UTC 2012 - i@marguerite.su

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 12 11:08:50 UTC 2012 - i@marguerite.su

- further clean spec.
- enable build shared libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  9 15:36:41 CEST 2011 - tiwai@suse.de
