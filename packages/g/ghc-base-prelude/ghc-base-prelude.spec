%description
A library which aims to reexport all the non-conflicting and most general
definitions from the "base" package. This includes APIs for applicatives,
arrows, monoids, foldables, traversables, exceptions, generics, ST, MVars and
STM.

This package will never have any dependencies other than "base".

/Versioning policy/

The versioning policy of this package deviates from PVP in the sense that its
exports in part are transitively determined by the version of "base".
Therefore it's recommended for the users of "base-prelude" to specify the
bounds of "base" as well.
