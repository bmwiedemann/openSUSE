  <title>Numerical linear algebra library focusing on solution of sparse linear systems</title>
  <description>Ginkgo is a high-performance numerical linear algebra library for many-core
systems, with a focus on solution of sparse linear systems. It is implemented
using modern C++ (you will need an at least C++17 compliant compiler to build
it), with GPU kernels implemented for NVIDIA, AMD and Intel GPUs.</description>
