%description
`pipes` is a clean and powerful stream processing library that lets you build
and connect reusable streaming components

Advantages over traditional streaming libraries:

* /Concise API/: Use simple commands like 'for', ('>->'), 'await', and 'yield'

* /Blazing fast/: Implementation tuned for speed, including shortcut fusion

* /Lightweight Dependency/: 'pipes' is small and compiles very rapidly,
including dependencies

* /Elegant semantics/: Use practical category theory

* /ListT/: Correct implementation of 'ListT' that interconverts with pipes

* /Bidirectionality/: Implement duplex channels

* /Extensive Documentation/: Second to none!

Import "Pipes" to use the library.

Read "Pipes.Tutorial" for an extensive tutorial.
