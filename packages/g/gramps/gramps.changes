- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:
  + %desktop_database_post/postun because the package ships at
    least one desktop file.
- Pass %{?no_lang_C} to %find_lang so that english documentation
  can be packaged with the program, and not in the lang subpackage.

- Update to version 3.2.5:
  + Fix Gramps so it again runs with Python 2.5
  + Write all notes and sources to gedcom files
  + Cli fixes
  + GeneWeb and LegacyGedcom fixes
  + NarrativeWeb fixes
  + Memory leak fixes
  + Various other small fixes
  + Updated translations
- Add gnome-icon-theme BuildRequires for directory ownership.
- Add gnome-icon-theme, python-gtk, xdg-utils Requires, as
  documented by upstream.
- Add graphviz, python-webkitgtk Recommends, as documented by
  upstream.
- Improve description.
- Also remove the deprecated mime data files from
  /usr/share/mime-info, not just /usr/share/application-registry
- Call %mime_database_post and %mime_database_postun macros in
  %post/%postun since we install a xml mime file.
- Tag localized man pages with the right language. We should
  eventually move them to the lang subpackage, but at the moment,
  they would create a file conflict between bundles and the lang
  subpackage.
