<package name="ghc-yaml" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>The YAML package</title>
  <description>Provides support for parsing and emitting Yaml documents.

This package includes the full libyaml C library version 0.1.2 by Kirill Simonov (http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) in the package so you don't need to worry about any non-Haskell dependencies.

The package is broken down into two modules. Data.Yaml provides a high-level interface based around the JSON datatypes provided by the aeson package. Text.Libyaml provides a lower-level, streaming interface. For most users, Data.Yaml is recommended.
