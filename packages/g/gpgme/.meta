  <title>A Library Designed to Give Applications Easy Access to GnuPG</title>
  <description>GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG
easier for applications. It provides a high-level Crypto API for
encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification, and key
management. Currently it uses GnuPG as its back-end, but the API is not
restricted to this engine.

Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a
complicated programming task, it is suggested that all software should
try to use GPGME instead. This way bug fixes or improvements can be
done at a central place and every application benefits from this.</description>
