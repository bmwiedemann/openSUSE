%description
This package provides a pure Haskell "Tagged" DFA regex engine for
<//hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-base regex-base>. This implementation was
inspired by the algorithm (and Master's thesis) behind the regular expression
library known as <https://github.com/laurikari/tre/ TRE or libtre>.

Please consult the "Text.Regex.TDFA" module for API documentation including a
tutorial with usage examples; see also
<https://wiki.haskell.org/Regular_expressions> for general information about
regular expression support in Haskell.
