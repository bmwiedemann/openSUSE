- Update citeproc to version 0.1.0.3.
  ## 0.1.0.3

    * Better handling of author-only/suppress-author.
      Previously all results of "names" elements were treated
      as authors.  But only the first should be (generally this
      is the author, but it could be the editor of an edited
      volume with no author).  See jgm/pandoc#6765.

- Update citeproc to version 0.1.0.2.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/citeproc-0.1.0.2/src/CHANGELOG.md

- Update citeproc to version 0.1.0.1.
  ## 0.1.0.1

    * Fix sorting when no `<sorting>` element given. The spec says:
      "In the absence of cs:sort, cites and bibliographic entries appear in
      the order in which they are cited." This affects IEEE in particular.  See
      jgm/pandoc#6741.

    * Improve `sameNames` and citation grouping.  Preivously if a citation
      item had a prefix, it would not be grouped with following citations.
      See jgm/pandoc#6722 for discussion.

    * Remove unneeded `hasNoSuffix` check in `sameNames`.

    * Remove unneeded import

    * `citeproc` executable: strip BOM before parsing style (#18).
