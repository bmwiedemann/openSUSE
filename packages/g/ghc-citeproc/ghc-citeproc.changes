- Update citeproc to version 0.3.0.3.
  ## 0.3.0.3

    * Fix author-only citations (#43).  We got bad results with some
      styles when a reference had both an author and a translator.

  ## 0.3.0.2

    * Don't use cite-group delimiter if ANY citation in group has
      locator (#38).  This seems to be citeproc.js's behavior and it gives
      better results for chicago-author-date:  we want both
      `[@foo20; @foo21, p. 3]` and `[@foo20, p. 3; @foo21]` to produce
      a semicolon separator, rather than a comma.

- Update citeproc to version 0.3.0.1.
  ## 0.3.0.1

    * Better handle `initialize-with` that ends in a nonbreaking space.
      In this case, citeproc should not add an additional space
      or strip the nonbreaking space.  Closes #37.

- Update citeproc to version 0.3.
  ## 0.3

    * Change `makeReferenceMap` to return a cleaned-up list of
      references as well as a reference map.  The cleanup-up list
      removes references with duplicate ids.  When there are multiple
      references with the same id, the last one is included and
      the others discarded.  [API change]

- Update citeproc to version 0.2.0.1.
  ## 0.2.0.1

    * FromJSON for Name: make straight quotes curly.
      Otherwise nothing will do this, when we are decoding
      JSON to (Reference a), a /= CslJson Text.
    * Remove redundant pragmas and imports (Albert Krewinkel).
    * Use custom prelude with GHC 8.6.* and older (Albert
      Krewinkel).  This adds support for GHC 8.0.x.

- Update citeproc to version 0.2.
  ## 0.2

    * Remove `AfterOtherPunctuation` constructor from
      `CaseTransformState` [API change].
      This gave bad results with things like parentheses (#27).
    * Change `SortKeyValue` to include `Maybe Lang` [API change].
      This allows us to do locale-sensitive sorting (though this
      won't matter much unless the `icu` flag is used).
    * Add `Maybe Lang` parameter on `initialize` (since
      capitalization can be locale-dependent).
    * Add cabal.project.icu for building with icu lib.
    * Add (unexported) Citeproc.Unicode compatibility module.
      This allows us to use the same functions whether or not
      the `icu` flag is used.

- Update citeproc to version 0.1.1.1.
  ## 0.1.1.1

    * Pay attention to citationNoteNumber in computing position.
      In calculating whether an item is alone in its citation,
      we need to take into account citationNoteNumber, since
      two citations may occur in the same note and they should
      not be ranked "alone." See jgm/pandoc#6813,
      citation-style-language/documentation#121

  ## 0.1.1

    * Ensure that uncited references are sorted last
      when it comes to assigning citation numbers (#22).
    * Remove "capitalize initial term" feature.  This is required by
      the test suite but not the spec.  It makes more sense for us to do
      this capitalization in the calling program, e.g. pandoc.  For some
      citations in note styles may already be in notes and thus not
      trigger separate footnotes.  If initial terms had been capitalized,
      we'd need to uncapitalize, and that is hard to do reliably.
    * Treat empty `FancyVal` as an empty value.
    * Derive Functor, Traversable, Foldable for Result [API change].

- Update citeproc to version 0.1.0.3.
  ## 0.1.0.3

    * Better handling of author-only/suppress-author.
      Previously all results of "names" elements were treated
      as authors.  But only the first should be (generally this
      is the author, but it could be the editor of an edited
      volume with no author).  See jgm/pandoc#6765.

- Update citeproc to version 0.1.0.2.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/citeproc-0.1.0.2/src/CHANGELOG.md

- Update citeproc to version 0.1.0.1.
  ## 0.1.0.1

    * Fix sorting when no `<sorting>` element given. The spec says:
      "In the absence of cs:sort, cites and bibliographic entries appear in
      the order in which they are cited." This affects IEEE in particular.  See
      jgm/pandoc#6741.

    * Improve `sameNames` and citation grouping.  Preivously if a citation
      item had a prefix, it would not be grouped with following citations.
      See jgm/pandoc#6722 for discussion.

    * Remove unneeded `hasNoSuffix` check in `sameNames`.

    * Remove unneeded import

    * `citeproc` executable: strip BOM before parsing style (#18).
