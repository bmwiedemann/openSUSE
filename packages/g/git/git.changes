- update to 2.43.2:
  * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.43.2.txt
  * Update to a new feature recently added, "git show-ref --exists".
  * Rename detection logic ignored the final line of a file if it
    is an incomplete line.
  * "git diff --no-rename A B" did not disable rename detection but
    did not trigger an error from the command line parser.
  * "git diff --no-index file1 file2" segfaulted while invoking the
    external diff driver, which has been corrected.
  * A failed "git tag -s" did not necessarily result in an error
    depending on the crypto backend, which has been corrected.
  * "git stash" sometimes was silent even when it failed due to
    unwritable index file, which has been corrected.
  * Recent conversion to allow more than 0/1 in GIT_FLUSH broke the
    mechanism by flipping what yes/no means by mistake, which has
    been corrected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 21 14:52:03 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.43.0:
 * The "--rfc" option of "git format-patch" used to be a valid way to
   override an earlier "--subject-prefix=<something>" on the command
   line and replace it with "[RFC PATCH]", but from this release, it
   merely prefixes the string "RFC " in front of the given subject
   prefix.  If you are negatively affected by this change, please use
   "--subject-prefix=PATCH --rfc" as a replacement.
 * In Git 2.42, "git rev-list --stdin" learned to take non-revisions
   (like "--not") from the standard input, but the way such a "--not" was
   handled was quite confusing, which has been rethought.  The updated
   rule is that "--not" given from the command line only affects revs
   given from the command line that comes but not revs read from the
   standard input, and "--not" read from the standard input affects
   revs given from the standard input and not revs given from the
   command line.
 * A message written in olden time prevented a branch from getting
   checked out, saying it is already checked out elsewhere. But these
   days, we treat a branch that is being bisected or rebased just like
   a branch that is checked out and protect it from getting modified
   with the same codepath.  The message has been rephrased to say that
   the branch is "in use" to avoid confusion.
 * Hourly and other schedules of "git maintenance" jobs are randomly
   distributed now.
 * "git cmd -h" learned to signal which options can be negated by
   listing such options like "--[no-]opt".
 * The way authentication related data other than passwords (e.g.,
   oauth token and password expiration data) are stored in libsecret
   keyrings has been rethought.
 * Update the libsecret and wincred credential helpers to correctly
   match which credential to erase; they erased the wrong entry in
   some cases.
 * Git GUI updates.
 * "git format-patch" learned a new "--description-file" option that
   lets cover letter description to be fed; this can be used on
   detached HEAD where there is no branch description available, and
   also can override the branch description if there is one.
 * Use of the "--max-pack-size" option to allow multiple packfiles to
   be created is now supported even when we are sending unreachable
   objects to cruft packs.
 * "git format-patch --rfc --subject-prefix=<foo>" used to ignore the
   "--subject-prefix" option and used "[RFC PATCH]"; now we will add
   "RFC" prefix to whatever subject prefix is specified.
 * "git log --format" has been taught the %(decorate) placeholder for
   further customization over what the "--decorate" option offers.
 * The default log message created by "git revert", when reverting a
   commit that records a revert, has been tweaked, to encourage people
   to describe complex "revert of revert of revert" situations better in
   their own words.
 * The command-line completion support (in contrib/) learned to
   complete "git commit --trailer=" for possible trailer keys.
 * "git update-index" learned the "--show-index-version" option to
   inspect the index format version used by the on-disk index file.
 * "git diff" learned the "diff.statNameWidth" configuration variable,
   to give the default width for the name part in the "--stat" output.
 * "git range-diff --notes=foo" compared "log --notes=foo --notes" of
   the two ranges, instead of using just the specified notes tree,
   which has been corrected to use only the specified notes tree.
 * The command line completion script (in contrib/) can be told to
   complete aliases by including ": git <cmd> ;" in the alias to tell
   it that the alias should be completed in a similar way to how "git
   <cmd>" is completed.  The parsing code for the alias has been
   loosened to allow ';' without an extra space before it.
 * "git for-each-ref" and friends learned to apply mailmap to
   authorname and other fields in a more flexible way than using
   separate placeholder letters like %a[eElL] every time we want to
   come up with small variants.
 * "git repack" machinery learned to pay attention to the "--filter="
   option.
 * "git repack" learned the "--max-cruft-size" option to prevent cruft
   packs from growing without bounds.
 * "git merge-tree" learned to take strategy backend specific options
   via the "-X" option, like "git merge" does.
 * "git log" and friends learned the "--dd" option that is a
   short-hand for "--diff-merges=first-parent -p".
 * The attribute subsystem learned to honor the "attr.tree"
   configuration variable that specifies which tree to read the
   .gitattributes files from.
 * "git merge-file" learns a mode to read three variants of the
   contents to be merged from blob objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 23 19:03:38 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.42.0:
  * "git pack-refs" learns "--include" and "--exclude" to tweak the ref
    hierarchy to be packed using pattern matching.
  * 'git worktree add' learned how to create a worktree based on an
    orphaned branch with `--orphan`.
  * "git pack-objects" learned to invoke a new hook program that
    enumerates extra objects to be used as anchoring points to keep
    otherwise unreachable objects in cruft packs.
  * Add more "git var" for toolsmiths to learn various locations Git is
    configured with either via the configuration or hard-coded defaults.
  * 'git notes append' was taught '--separator' to specify string to insert
    between paragraphs.
  * The "git for-each-ref" family of commands learned placeholders
    related to GPG signature verification.
  * "git diff --no-index" learned to read from named pipes as if they
    were regular files, to allow "git diff <(process) <(substitution)"
    some shells support.
  * Help newbies by suggesting that there are cases where force-pushing
    is a valid and sensible thing to update a branch at a remote
    repository, rather than reconciling with merge/rebase.
  * "git blame --contents=file" has been taught to work in a bare
    repository.
  * "git branch -f X" to repoint the branch X said that X was "checked
    out" in another worktree, even when branch X was not and instead
    being bisected or rebased.  The message was reworded to say the
    branch was "in use".
  * Tone down the warning on SHA-256 repositories being an experimental
    curiosity.  We do not have support for them to interoperate with
    traditional SHA-1 repositories, but at this point, we do not plan
    to make breaking changes to SHA-256 repositories and there is no
    longer need for such a strongly phrased warning.
  * "git diff-tree" has been taught to take advantage of the
    sparse-index feature.
  * The object traversal using reachability bitmap done by
    "pack-object" has been tweaked to take advantage of the fact that
    using "boundary" commits as representative of all the uninteresting
    ones can save quite a lot of object enumeration.
  * "git worktree" learned to work better with sparse index feature.
  * When the external merge driver is killed by a signal, its output
    should not be trusted as a resolution with conflicts that is
    proposed by the driver, but the code did.
  * The set-up code for the get_revision() API now allows feeding
    options like --all and --not in the --stdin mode.
  * Move functions that are not about pure string manipulation out of
    strbuf.[ch]
  * "imap-send" codepaths got cleaned up to get rid of unused
    parameters.
  * Enumerating refs in the packed-refs file, while excluding refs that
    match certain patterns, has been optimized.
  * Mark-up unused parameters in the code so that we can eventually
    enable -Wunused-parameter by default.
  * Instead of inventing a custom counter variables for debugging,
    use existing trace2 facility in the fsync customization codepath.
  * "git branch --list --format=<format>" and friends are taught
    a new "%(describe)" placeholder.
  * Clarify how to choose the starting point for a new topic in
    developer guidance document.
  * The implementation of "get_sha1_hex()" that reads a hexadecimal
    string that spells a full object name has been extended to cope
    with any hash function used in the repository, but the "sha1" in
    its name survived.  Rename it to get_hash_hex(), a name that is
    more consistent within its friends like get_hash_hex_algop().
  * Command line parser fix, and a small parse-options API update.
  * bug fixes

- git 2.41.0: This update contains a number of compatible updates,
  improvements and extensions to multiple workflows. Some changes
  may break backwards compatibility:
  * The libsecret credential helper obsoletes direct GNOME keyring
    support, which was dropped (git-credential-gnome-keyring)
  * "git format-patch" has been taught to ignore end-user
    configuration ("diff.noprefix") and always use the standard
    prefixes, to avoid breaking the receiving end of the patch
- drop sha256_clone_fix.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 25 20:43:30 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <Andreas.Stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.40.1:
  * CVE-2023-25652: By feeding specially crafted input to git apply
    --reject, a path outside the working tree can be overwritten
    with partially controlled contents (corresponding to the
    rejected hunk(s) from the given patch).
  * CVE-2023-25815: When Git is compiled with runtime prefix
    support and runs without translated messages, it still used
    the gettext machinery to display messages, which subsequently
    potentially looked for translated messages in unexpected
    places. This allowed for malicious placement of crafted
    messages.
  * CVE-2023-29007: When renaming or deleting a section from a
    configuration file, certain malicious configuration values may
    be misinterpreted as the beginning of a new configuration
    section, leading to arbitrary configuration injection.

Mon Mar 13 20:08:03 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.40.0:
  * backward incompatible change: The format.attach configuration
    variable lacked a way to override a value defined in a
    lower-priority configuration file (e.g. the system one) by
    redefining it in a higher-priority configuration file. Now,
    setting format.attach to an empty string means show the patch
    inline in the e-mail message, without using MIME attachment.
  * multiple commands and workflows gained additional options,
    compatible functionality, or more helpful output
  * "grep -P" learned to use Unicode Character Property to grok
    character classes when processing \b and \w etc.
  * under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes
- The scripted "git add -p/-i" implementation was removed upstream.
  The openSUSE package already preferred the C implementation.

Mon Dec 12 20:08:41 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.39.0:
  * "git grep" learned to expand the sparse-index more lazily and
    on demand in a sparse checkout.
  * By default, use of fsmonitor on a repository on networked
    filesystem is disabled.
  * After checking out a "branch" that is a symbolic-ref that points at
    another branch, "git symbolic-ref HEAD" reports the underlying
    branch, not the symbolic-ref the user gave checkout as argument.
    The command learned the "--no-recurse" option to stop after
    dereferencing a symbolic-ref only once.
  * "git branch --edit-description @{-1}" is now a way to edit branch
    description of the branch you were on before switching to the
    current branch.
  * "git merge-tree --stdin" is a new way to request a series of merges
    and report the merge results.
  * "git shortlog" learned to group by the "format" string.
  * A new "--include-whitespace" option is added to "git patch-id", and
    existing bugs in the internal patch-id logic that did not match
    what "git patch-id" produces have been corrected.
  * Enable gc.cruftpacks by default for those who opt into
    feature.experimental setting.
  * "git repack" learns to send cruft objects out of the way into
    packfiles outside the repository.
  * 'scalar reconfigure -a' is taught to automatically remove
    scalar.repo entires which no longer exist.
  * Redact headers from cURL's h2h3 module in GIT_CURL_VERBOSE and
    others.
  * 'git maintenance register' is taught to write configuration to an
    arbitrary path, and 'git for-each-repo' is taught to expand tilde
    characters in paths.
  * When creating new notes, the template used to get a stray empty
    newline, which has been removed.
  * "git receive-pack" used to use all the local refs as the boundary for
    checking connectivity of the data "git push" sent, but now it uses
    only the refs that it advertised to the pusher. In a repository with
    the .hideRefs configuration, this reduces the resources needed to
    perform the check.
  * With '--recurse-submodules=on-demand', all submodules are
    recursively pushed.
  * developer visible fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 12 19:48:34 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.38.2, a general maintenance release:
  * Fix unaligned memory access for reads from the index v4
  * "git remote rename" failed to rename a remote without fetch
    refspec, which has been corrected.
  * "git clone" did not like to see the "--bare" and the "--origin"
    options used together without a good reason.
  * "git fsck" failed to release contents of tree objects already
    used from the memory
  * "git rebase -i" can mistakenly attempt to apply a fixup to
    commit itself, which has been corrected.
  * Fix segfault with "git merge-tree" on read-only repositories
  * Fix a logic in "mailinfo -b" that miscomputed the length of a
    substring, which lead to an out-of-bounds access.
  * The codepath to sign learned to report errors when it fails to
    read from "ssh-keygen".
  * "GIT_EDITOR=: git branch --edit-description" resulted in failure
  * "git multi-pack-index repack/expire" used to repack unreachable
    cruft into a new pack, which have been corrected.
  * The code to clean temporary object directories (used for
    quarantine) tried to remove them inside its signal handler
  * "git branch --edit-description" on an unborh branch misleadingly
    said that no such branch exists
  * `git rebase --update-refs` would delete references when all
    `update-ref` commands in the sequencer were removed

Wed Oct 26 19:57:18 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.38.1 (bsc#1204455, CVE-2022-39253, bsc#1204456, CVE-2022-39260):
  * CVE-2022-39253:
    When relying on the `--local` clone optimization, Git dereferences
    symbolic links in the source repository before creating hardlinks
    (or copies) of the dereferenced link in the destination repository.
    This can lead to surprising behavior where arbitrary files are
    present in a repository's `$GIT_DIR` when cloning from a malicious
    repository.
    Git will no longer dereference symbolic links via the `--local`
    clone mechanism, and will instead refuse to clone repositories that
    have symbolic links present in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory.
    Additionally, the value of `protocol.file.allow` is changed to be
    "user" by default.
  * CVE-2022-39260:
    An overly-long command string given to `git shell` can result in
    overflow in `split_cmdline()`, leading to arbitrary heap writes and
    remote code execution when `git shell` is exposed and the directory
    `$HOME/git-shell-commands` exists.
    `git shell` is taught to refuse interactive commands that are
    longer than 4MiB in size. `split_cmdline()` is hardened to reject
    inputs larger than 2GiB.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  6 19:29:30 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

  * new git rebase --update-refs (global rebase.updateRefs)
    to update dependent branches
  * merge-tree integrated with the new ort merge strategy
    --write-tree, while --trivial-merge retains the old mode
  * bare git repositories can now be stored and distributed
    in other git repositories
  * Setting the safe.bareRepository configuration to "explicit"
    avoids running arbitrary commands from filesystem monitoring
    hooks of untrusted git repositories unless --git-dir is set
  * git grep: new -m / --max-count options to limit the number
    of matches per file
  * git ls-files --format is a new option to customize outout
  * git cat-file and git show now support mailmap author mapping
  * bug fixes and performance improvements

- git 2.37.1:
  * Rewrite of "git add -i" in C that appeared in Git 2.25 didn't
    correctly record a removed file to the index, which is an old
    regression but has become widely known because the C version has
    become the default in the latest release.
  * Fix for CVE-2022-29187 [boo#1201431]:
    The safety check that verifies a safe ownership of the Git
    worktree is now extended to also cover the ownership of the Git
    directory (and the `.git` file, if there is any).

- Add /etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt: checks for git-prompt.sh and source it
  if available. Some users rely on the __git_ps1 function becoming available
  when bash-completion is loaded.  Continue to load this library at
  bash-completion startup for now, to ease the transition to a world order
  where the prompt function is requested separately. Inspired by Debian.

    warning when used; use "git name-rev --annotate-stdin" instead.
  * "git clone --filter=... --recurse-submodules" only makes the

- update to 2.35.1:
  * fix "rebase" and "stash" in a secondary worktree

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 28 20:44:04 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.35.0:
 * "_" is now treated as any other URL-valid characters in an URL when
   matching the per-URL configuration variable names.
 * The color palette used by "git grep" has been updated to match that
   of GNU grep.
 * "git status --porcelain=v2" now show the number of stash entries
   with --show-stash like the normal output does.
 * "git stash" learned the "--staged" option to stash away what has
   been added to the index (and nothing else).
 * "git var GIT_DEFAULT_BRANCH" is a way to see what name is used for
   the newly created branch if "git init" is run.
 * Various operating modes of "git reset" have been made to work
   better with the sparse index.
 * "git submodule deinit" for a submodule whose .git metadata
   directory is embedded in its working tree refused to work, until
   the submodule gets converted to use the "absorbed" form where the
   metadata directory is stored in superproject, and a gitfile at the
   top-level of the working tree of the submodule points at it.  The
   command is taught to convert such submodules to the absorbed form
   as needed.
 * The completion script (in contrib/) learns that the "--date"
   option of commands from the "git log" family takes "human" and
   "auto" as valid values.
 * "Zealous diff3" style of merge conflict presentation has been added.
 * The "git log --format=%(describe)" placeholder has been extended to
   allow passing selected command-line options to the underlying "git
   describe" command.
 * "default" and "reset" have been added to our color palette.
 * The cryptographic signing using ssh keys can specify literal keys
   for keytypes whose name do not begin with the "ssh-" prefix by
   using the "key::" prefix mechanism (e.g. "key::ecdsa-sha2-nistp256").
 * "git fetch" without the "--update-head-ok" option ought to protect
   a checked out branch from getting updated, to prevent the working
   tree that checks it out to go out of sync.  The code was written
   before the use of "git worktree" got widespread, and only checked
   the branch that was checked out in the current worktree, which has
   been updated.
 * "git name-rev" has been tweaked to give output that is shorter and
   easier to understand.
 * "git apply" has been taught to ignore a message without a patch
   with the "--allow-empty" option.  It also learned to honor the
   "--quiet" option given from the command line.
 * The "init" and "set" subcommands in "git sparse-checkout" have been
   unified for a better user experience and performance.
 * Many git commands that deal with working tree files try to remove a
   directory that becomes empty (i.e. "git switch" from a branch that
   has the directory to another branch that does not would attempt
   remove all files in the directory and the directory itself).  This
   drops users into an unfamiliar situation if the command was run in
   a subdirectory that becomes subject to removal due to the command.
   The commands have been taught to keep an empty directory if it is
   the directory they were started in to avoid surprising users.
 * "git am" learns "--empty=(stop|drop|keep)" option to tweak what is
   done to a piece of e-mail without a patch in it.
 * The default merge message prepared by "git merge" records the name
   of the current branch; the name can be overridden with a new option
   to allow users to pretend a merge is made on a different branch.
 * The way "git p4" shows file sizes in its output has been updated to
   use human-readable units.
 * "git -c branch.autosetupmerge=inherit branch new old" makes "new"
   to have the same upstream as the "old" branch, instead of marking
   "old" itself as its upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 26 21:20:00 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.34.1 (bsc#1193722):
  * "git grep" looking in a blob that has non-UTF8 payload was
    completely broken when linked with certain versions of PCREv2
    library in the latest release.
  * "git pull" with any strategy when the other side is behind us
    should succeed as it is a no-op, but doesn't.
  * An earlier change in 2.34.0 caused JGit application (that abused
    GIT_EDITOR mechanism when invoking "git config") to get stuck with
    a SIGTTOU signal; it has been reverted.
  * An earlier change that broke .gitignore matching has been reverted.
  * SubmittingPatches document gained a syntactically incorrect mark-up,
    which has been corrected.

Mon Sep 20 08:33:11 UTC 2021 - Johannes Segitz <jsegitz@suse.com>

- Added hardening to systemd service(s) (bsc#1181400). Modified:
  * git-daemon.service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 21 07:19:13 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.33.0:
  * "git send-email" learned the "--sendmail-cmd" command line option
    and the "sendemail.sendmailCmd" configuration variable, which is a
    more sensible approach than the current way of repurposing the
    "smtp-server" that is meant to name the server to instead name the
    command to talk to the server.
  * The userdiff pattern for C# learned the token "record".
  * "git rev-list" learns to omit the "commit <object-name>" header
    lines from the output with the `--no-commit-header` option.
  * "git worktree add --lock" learned to record why the worktree is
    locked with a custom message.
  * internal improvements including performance optimizations
  * a number of bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  6 15:30:14 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.32.0:
  * ".gitattributes", ".gitignore", and ".mailmap" files that are
    symbolic links are ignored
  * "git apply --3way" used to first attempt a straight
    application, and only fell back to the 3-way merge algorithm
    when the straight application failed.  Starting with this
    version, the command will first try the 3-way merge algorithm
    and only when it fails (either resulting with conflict or the
    base versions of blobs are missing), falls back to the usual
    patch application.
  * "git stash show" can now show the untracked part of the stash
  * Improved "git repack" strategy
  * http code can now unlock a certificate with a cached password
    respectively.
  * "git clone --reject-shallow" option fails the clone as soon as
    we notice that we are cloning from a shallow repository.
  * "gitweb" learned "e-mail privacy" feature
  * Multiple improvements to output and configuration options
  * Bug fixes and developer visible fixes

  (boo#1183580)
- Drop rsync requirement, not necessary anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 15 20:30:29 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.31.0:
  * Use of "pack-redundant" command is discouraged and will trigger
    a warning. The replacement is "repack -d".
  * The "--format=%(trailers)" mechanism gets enhanced to make it
    easier to design output for machine consumption.
  * No longer give message to choose between rebase or merge upon
    pull if the history fast-forwards
  * The configuration variable 'core.abbrev' can be set to 'no' to
    force no abbreviation regardless of the hash algorithm.
  * "git rev-parse" can be explicitly told to give output as absolute
    or relative path with the `--path-format=(absolute|relative)` option.
  * Bash completion (in contrib/) update to make it easier for
    end-users to add completion for their custom "git" subcommands.
  * "git maintenance" learned to drive scheduled maintenance on
    platforms whose native scheduling methods are not 'cron'.
  * After expiring a reflog and making a single commit, the reflog for
    the branch would record a single entry that knows both @{0} and
    @{1}, but we failed to answer "what commit were we on?", i.e. @{1}
  * "git bundle" learns "--stdin" option to read its refs from the
    standard input.  Also, it now does not lose refs whey they point
    at the same object.
  * "git log" learned a new "--diff-merges=<how>" option.
  * "git ls-files" can and does show multiple entries when the index is
    unmerged, which is a source for confusion unless -s/-u option is in
    use.  A new option --deduplicate has been introduced.
  * `git worktree list` now annotates worktrees as prunable, shows
    locked and prunable attributes in --porcelain mode, and gained
    a --verbose option.
  * "git clone" tries to locally check out the branch pointed at by
    HEAD of the remote repository after it is done, but the protocol
    did not convey the information necessary to do so when copying an
    empty repository.  The protocol v2 learned how to do so.
  * There are other ways than ".." for a single token to denote a
    "commit range", namely "<rev>^!" and "<rev>^-<n>", but "git
    range-diff" did not understand them.
  * The "git range-diff" command learned "--(left|right)-only" option
    to show only one side of the compared range.
  * "git mergetool" feeds three versions (base, local and remote) of
    a conflicted path unmodified.  The command learned to optionally
    prepare these files with unconflicted parts already resolved.
  * The .mailmap is documented to be read only from the root level of a
    working tree, but a stray file in a bare repository also was read
    by accident, which has been corrected.
  * "git maintenance" tool learned a new "pack-refs" maintenance task.
  * The error message given when a configuration variable that is
    expected to have a boolean value has been improved.
  * Signed commits and tags now allow verification of objects, whose
    two object names (one in SHA-1, the other in SHA-256) are both
    signed.
  * "git rev-list" command learned "--disk-usage" option.
  * "git {diff,log} --{skip,rotate}-to=<path>" allows the user to
    discard diff output for early paths or move them to the end of the
    output.
  * "git difftool" learned "--skip-to=<path>" option to restart an
    interrupted session from an arbitrary path.
  * "git grep" has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout
    paths.
  * "git rebase --[no-]fork-point" gained a configuration variable
    rebase.forkPoint so that users do not have to keep specifying a
    non-default setting.
  * many bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  9 18:55:54 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.30.2:
  * CVE-2021-21300: On case-insensitive file systems with support
    for symbolic links, if Git is configured globally to apply
    delay-capable clean/smudge filters (such as Git LFS), Git could
    be fooled into running remote code during a clone (boo#1183026)

    --separate-git-dir" no longer corrupts administrative data
    related to linked worktrees
  * "git maintenance" introduced for repository maintenance tasks
  * enhancements to multiple workflows, addition of configuration
    options and supported parameters, and bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 10:08:47 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- git 2.28.0
  * "fetch.writeCommitGraph" is deemed to be still a bit too risky and
    is no longer part of the "feature.experimental" set.
  * The commands in the "diff" family learned to honor "diff.relative"
    configuration variable.
  * "git diff-files" has been taught to say paths that are marked as
    intent-to-add are new files, not modified from an empty blob.
  * "git gui" now allows opening work trees from the start-up dialog.
  * "git bugreport" learns to report what shell is in use.
  * SHA-256 migration work continues, including CVS/SVN interface.
  * Some repositories in the wild have commits that record nonsense
    committer timezone (e.g. rails.git); "git fast-import" learned an
    option to pass these nonsense timestamps intact to allow recreating
    existing repositories as-is.
  * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  1 20:32:59 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.27.0:
   * "git describe" will always use the "long" version when giving

   * "git pull" issues a warning message until the pull.rebase
     configuration variable is explicitly given
   * The transport protocol version 2, which was promoted to the

    command; this has been enhanced so that the subject can also be
    filled.
  * A few commands learned to take the pathspec from the standard input
    or a named file, instead of taking it as the command line
    arguments, with the "--pathspec-from-file" option.
  * Test updates to prepare for SHA-2 transition continues.
  * Redo "git name-rev" to avoid recursive calls.
  * When all files from some subdirectory were renamed to the root
    directory, the directory rename heuristics would fail to detect that
    as a rename/merge of the subdirectory to the root directory, which has
    been corrected.
  * HTTP transport had possible allocator/deallocator mismatch, which
    has been corrected.

Wed Dec 11 06:37:34 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- git 2.24.1:
  * CVE-2019-1348: The --export-marks option of fast-import is
    exposed also via the in-stream command feature export-marks=...
    and it allows overwriting arbitrary paths (boo#1158785)
  * CVE-2019-1349: on Windows, when submodules are cloned
    recursively, under certain circumstances Git could be fooled
    into using the same Git directory twice (boo#1158787)
  * CVE-2019-1350: Incorrect quoting of command-line arguments
    allowed remote code execution during a recursive clone in
    conjunction with SSH URLs (boo#1158788)
  * CVE-2019-1351: on Windows mistakes drive letters outside of
    the US-English alphabet as relative paths (boo#1158789)
  * CVE-2019-1352: on Windows was unaware of NTFS Alternate Data
    Streams (boo#1158790)
  * CVE-2019-1353: when run in the Windows Subsystem for Linux
    while accessing a working directory on a regular Windows
    drive, none of the NTFS protections were active (boo#1158791)
  * CVE-2019-1354: on Windows refuses to write tracked files with
    filenames that contain backslashes (boo#1158792)
  * CVE-2019-1387: Recursive clones vulnerability that is caused
    by too-lax validation of submodule names, allowing very
    targeted attacks via remote code execution in recursive
    clones (boo#1158793)
  * CVE-2019-19604: a recursive clone followed by a submodule
    update could execute code contained within the repository
    without the user explicitly having asked for that (boo#1158795)

- git 2.23.0:
  * The "--base" option of "format-patch" computed the patch-ids for
    prerequisite patches in an unstable way, which has been updated
    to compute in a way that is compatible with "git patch-id
    --stable".
  * The "git log" command by default behaves as if the --mailmap
    option was given.
  * fixes and improvements to UI, workflow and features

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 14 11:21:43 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- git 2.22.1
  * A relative pathname given to "git init --template=<path> <repo>"
  ought to be relative to the directory "git init" gets invoked in,
  but it instead was made relative to the repository, which has been
  corrected.
  * "git worktree add" used to fail when another worktree connected to
  the same repository was corrupt, which has been corrected.
  * "git am -i --resolved" segfaulted after trying to see a commit as
  if it were a tree, which has been corrected.
  * "git merge --squash" is designed to update the working tree and the
  index without creating the commit, and this cannot be countermanded
  by adding the "--commit" option; the command now refuses to work
  when both options are given.
  * Update to Unicode 12.1 width table.
  * "git request-pull" learned to warn when the ref we ask them to pull
  from in the local repository and in the published repository are
  different.
  * "git fetch" into a lazy clone forgot to fetch base objects that are
  necessary to complete delta in a thin packfile, which has been
  corrected.
  * The URL decoding code has been updated to avoid going past the end
  of the string while parsing %-<hex>-<hex> sequence.
  * "git clean" silently skipped a path when it cannot lstat() it; now
  it gives a warning.
  * "git rm" to resolve a conflicted path leaked an internal message
  "needs merge" before actually removing the path, which was
  confusing. This has been corrected.
  * Many more bugfixes and code cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 10 14:04:52 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- git 2.22.0
  * The filter specification "--filter=sparse:path=<path>" used to
  create a lazy/partial clone has been removed. Using a blob that is
  part of the project as sparse specification is still supported with
  the "--filter=sparse:oid=<blob>" option
  * "git checkout --no-overlay" can be used to trigger a new mode of
  checking out paths out of the tree-ish, that allows paths that
  match the pathspec that are in the current index and working tree
  and are not in the tree-ish.
  * Four new configuration variables {author,committer}.{name,email}
  have been introduced to override user.{name,email} in more specific
  cases.
  * "git branch" learned a new subcommand "--show-current".
  * The command line completion (in contrib/) has been taught to
  complete more subcommand parameters.
  * The completion helper code now pays attention to repository-local
  configuration (when available), which allows --list-cmds to honour
  a repository specific setting of completion.commands, for example.
  * The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while concluding a
  conflicted merge was shown above the scissors line when the
  clean-up mode is set to "scissors", even though it was commented
  out just like the list of updated paths and other information to
  help the user explain the merge better.
  * "git rebase" that was reimplemented in C did not set ORIG_HEAD
  correctly, which has been corrected.
  * "git worktree add" used to do a "find an available name with stat
  and then mkdir", which is race-prone. This has been fixed by using
  mkdir and reacting to EEXIST in a loop.

Mon Feb 25 09:56:24 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- git 2.21.0
  * Historically, the "-m" (mainline) option can only be used for "git
    cherry-pick" and "git revert" when working with a merge commit.
    This version of Git no longer warns or errors out when working with
    a single-parent commit, as long as the argument to the "-m" option
    is 1 (i.e. it has only one parent, and the request is to pick or
    revert relative to that first parent). Scripts that relied on the
    behaviour may get broken with this change.
  * Small fixes and features for fast-export and fast-import.
  * The "http.version" configuration variable can be used with recent
    enough versions of cURL library to force the version of HTTP used
    to talk when fetching and pushing.
  * "git push $there $src:$dst" rejects when $dst is not a fully
    qualified refname and it is not clear what the end user meant.
  * Update "git multimail" from the upstream.
  * A new date format "--date=human" that morphs its output depending
    on how far the time is from the current time has been introduced.
    "--date=auto:human" can be used to use this new format (or any
    existing format) when the output is going to the pager or to the
    terminal, and otherwise the default format.

Mon Dec 10 11:31:04 UTC 2018 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- git 2.20.0
 * "git help -a" now gives verbose output (same as "git help -av").
   Those who want the old output may say "git help --no-verbose -a"..
 * "git send-email" learned to grab address-looking string on any
   trailer whose name ends with "-by".
 * "git format-patch" learned new "--interdiff" and "--range-diff"
   options to explain the difference between this version and the
   previous attempt in the cover letter (or after the three-dashes as
   a comment).
 * Developer builds now use -Wunused-function compilation option.
 * Fix a bug in which the same path could be registered under multiple
   worktree entries if the path was missing (for instance, was removed
   manually).  Also, as a convenience, expand the number of cases in
   which --force is applicable.
 * The overly large Documentation/config.txt file have been split into
   million little pieces.  This potentially allows each individual piece
   to be included into the manual page of the command it affects more easily.
 * Malformed or crafted data in packstream can make our code attempt
   to read or write past the allocated buffer and abort, instead of
   reporting an error, which has been fixed.
 * Fix for a long-standing bug that leaves the index file corrupt when
   it shrinks during a partial commit.
 * "git merge" and "git pull" that merges into an unborn branch used
   to completely ignore "--verify-signatures", which has been
   corrected.
 * ...and much more features and fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 11 14:40:01 UTC 2018 - Petr Vorel <pvorel@suse.cz>

- git 2.19.0:
 * "git diff" compares the index and the working tree.  For paths
   added with intent-to-add bit, the command shows the full contents
   of them as added, but the paths themselves were not marked as new
   files.  They are now shown as new by default.
 * "git apply" learned the "--intent-to-add" option so that an
   otherwise working-tree-only application of a patch will add new
   paths to the index marked with the "intent-to-add" bit.
 * "git grep" learned the "--column" option that gives not just the
   line number but the column number of the hit.
 * The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
   "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
   it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step warns when "-l"
   is used as a short-hand for "--create-reflog" and warns about the
   future repurposing of the it when it is used.
 * The userdiff pattern for .php has been updated.
 * The content-transfer-encoding of the message "git send-email" sends
   out by default was 8bit, which can cause trouble when there is an
   overlong line to bust RFC 5322/2822 limit.  A new option 'auto' to
   automatically switch to quoted-printable when there is such a line
   in the payload has been introduced and is made the default.
 * "git checkout" and "git worktree add" learned to honor
   checkout.defaultRemote when auto-vivifying a local branch out of a
   remote tracking branch in a repository with multiple remotes that
   have tracking branches that share the same names.
   (merge 8d7b558bae ab/checkout-default-remote later to maint).
 * "git grep" learned the "--only-matching" option.
 * "git rebase --rebase-merges" mode now handles octopus merges as
   well.
 * Add a server-side knob to skip commits in exponential/fibbonacci
   stride in an attempt to cover wider swath of history with a smaller
   number of iterations, potentially accepting a larger packfile
   transfer, instead of going back one commit a time during common
   ancestor discovery during the "git fetch" transaction.
   (merge 42cc7485a2 jt/fetch-negotiator-skipping later to maint).
 * A new configuration variable core.usereplacerefs has been added,
   primarily to help server installations that want to ignore the
   replace mechanism altogether.
 * Teach "git tag -s" etc. a few configuration variables (gpg.format
   that can be set to "openpgp" or "x509", and gpg.<format>.program
   that is used to specify what program to use to deal with the format)
   to allow x.509 certs with CMS via "gpgsm" to be used instead of
   openpgp via "gnupg".
 * Many more strings are prepared for l10n.
 * "git p4 submit" learns to ask its own pre-submit hook if it should
   continue with submitting.
 * The test performed at the receiving end of "git push" to prevent
   bad objects from entering repository can be customized via
   receive.fsck.* configuration variables; we now have gained a
   counterpart to do the same on the "git fetch" side, with
   fetch.fsck.* configuration variables.
 * "git pull --rebase=interactive" learned "i" as a short-hand for
   "interactive".
 * "git instaweb" has been adjusted to run better with newer Apache on
   RedHat based distros.
 * "git range-diff" is a reimplementation of "git tbdiff" that lets us
   compare individual patches in two iterations of a topic.
 * The sideband code learned to optionally paint selected keywords at
   the beginning of incoming lines on the receiving end.
 * "git branch --list" learned to take the default sort order from the
   'branch.sort' configuration variable, just like "git tag --list"
   pays attention to 'tag.sort'.
 * "git worktree" command learned "--quiet" option to make it less
   verbose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 29 23:11:45 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- git 2.17.1
 * Submodule "names" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but
   we blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk
   repo paths. This means you can do bad things by putting "../"
   into the name. We now enforce some rules for submodule names
   which will cause Git to ignore these malicious names
   (CVE-2018-11235, bsc#1095219)
 * It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks paths on
   NTFS into reading random piece of memory
   (CVE-2018-11233, bsc#1095218)
 * Support on the server side to reject pushes to repositories

Sat May 19 20:37:48 UTC 2018 - schwab@linux-m68k.org

- git 2.17.0:
  * "diff" family of commands learned "--find-object=<object-id>" option
    to limit the findings to changes that involve the named object.
  * "git format-patch" learned to give 72-cols to diffstat, which is
    consistent with other line length limits the subcommand uses for
    its output meant for e-mails.
  * The log from "git daemon" can be redirected with a new option; one
    relevant use case is to send the log to standard error (instead of
    syslog) when running it from inetd.
  * "git rebase" learned to take "--allow-empty-message" option.
  * "git am" has learned the "--quit" option, in addition to the
    existing "--abort" option; having the pair mirrors a few other
    commands like "rebase" and "cherry-pick".
  * "git worktree add" learned to run the post-checkout hook, just like
    "git clone" runs it upon the initial checkout.
  * "git tag" learned an explicit "--edit" option that allows the
    message given via "-m" and "-F" to be further edited.
  * "git fetch --prune-tags" may be used as a handy short-hand for
    getting rid of stale tags that are locally held.
  * The new "--show-current-patch" option gives an end-user facing way
    to get the diff being applied when "git rebase" (and "git am")
    stops with a conflict.
  * "git add -p" used to offer "/" (look for a matching hunk) as a
    choice, even there was only one hunk, which has been corrected.
    Also the single-key help is now given only for keys that are
    enabled (e.g. help for '/' won't be shown when there is only one
    hunk).
  * Since Git 1.7.9, "git merge" defaulted to --no-ff (i.e. even when
    the side branch being merged is a descendant of the current commit,
    create a merge commit instead of fast-forwarding) when merging a
    tag object.  This was appropriate default for integrators who pull
    signed tags from their downstream contributors, but caused an
    unnecessary merges when used by downstream contributors who
    habitually "catch up" their topic branches with tagged releases
    from the upstream.  Update "git merge" to default to --no-ff only
    when merging a tag object that does *not* sit at its usual place in
    refs/tags/ hierarchy, and allow fast-forwarding otherwise, to
    mitigate the problem.
  * "git status" can spend a lot of cycles to compute the relation
    between the current branch and its upstream, which can now be
    disabled with "--no-ahead-behind" option.
  * "git diff" and friends learned funcname patterns for Go language
    source files.
  * "git send-email" learned "--reply-to=<address>" option.
   * Funcname pattern used for C# now recognizes "async" keyword.
   * In a way similar to how "git tag" learned to honor the pager
    setting only in the list mode, "git config" learned to ignore the
    pager setting when it is used for setting values (i.e. when the
    purpose of the operation is not to "show").

    did not report the  old and new pathnames correctly.
  * "git commit --fixup" did not allow "-m<message>" option to be
    used at the same time; allow it to annotate resulting commit
    with more text.
  * When resetting the working tree files recursively, the working
    tree of submodules are now also reset to match.
  * Fix for a commented-out code to adjust it to a rather old API
    change around object ID.
  * When there are too many changed paths, "git diff" showed a
    warning message but in the middle of a line.
  * The http tracing code, often used to debug connection issues,
    learned to redact potentially sensitive information from its
    output so that it can be more safely sharable.
  * Crash fix for a corner case where an error codepath tried to
    unlock what it did not acquire lock on.
  * The split-index mode had a few corner case bugs fixed.
  * Assorted fixes to "git daemon".
  * Completion of "git merge -s<strategy>" (in contrib/) did not
    work well in non-C locale.
  * Workaround for segfault with more recent versions of SVN.
  * Recently introduced leaks in fsck have been plugged.
  * Travis CI integration now builds the executable in 'script'
    phase to follow the established practice, rather than during
    'before_script' phase.  This allows the CI categorize the
    failures better ('failed' is project's fault, 'errored' is
    build environment's).

 * An old regression in "git describe --all $annotated_tag^0" has
   been fixed.
 * "git svn dcommit" did not take into account the fact that a
   svn+ssh:// URL with a username@ (typically used for pushing)
   refers to the same SVN repository without the username@ and
   failed when svn.pushmergeinfo option is set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 10 19:19:07 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.14.1 (bsc#1052481):
  * Security fix for CVE-2017-1000117: A malicious third-party can
    give a crafted "ssh://..." URL to an unsuspecting victim, and
    an attempt to visit the URL can result in any program that
    exists on the victim's machine being executed. Such a URL could
    be placed in the .gitmodules file of a malicious project, and
    an unsuspecting victim could be tricked into running
    "git clone --recurse-submodules" to trigger the vulnerability.
  * A "ssh://..." URL can result in a "ssh" command line with a
    hostname that begins with a dash "-", which would cause the
    "ssh" command to instead (mis)treat it as an option. This is
    now prevented by forbidding such a hostname (which should not
    impact any real-world usage).
  * Similarly, when GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is configured, the command
    is run with host and port that are parsed out from "ssh://..."
    URL; a poorly written GIT_PROXY_COMMAND could be tricked into
    treating a string that begins with a dash "-" as an option.
    This is now prevented by forbidding such a hostname and port
    number (again, which should not impact any real-world usage).
  * In the same spirit, a repository name that begins with a dash
    "-" is also forbidden now.

Mon Jun 13 21:49:43 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.9.0:
  * commands in the "git diff" and "git log" family by default
    enable the rename detection; use "diff.renames" configuration
    variable to disable this.
  * merging two branches that have no common ancestor with "git
    merge" is by default forbidden now to prevent creating such an
    unusual merge by mistake.
  * output formats of "git log" that indents the commit log message
    by 4 spaces now expands HT in the log message by default.
    The "--no-expand-tabs" option disables this.
  * "git commit-tree" plumbing command required the user to always
    sign its result when the user sets the commit.gpgsign
    configuration variable, this is no longer the case. Scrips
    using commit-tree which may rely on this mistake no needs to
    read commit.gpgsign and pass the -S option as necessary.
  * Many more bug fixes and minor updates.

  * Treat "http.cookieFile" config as a path
  * Suggest "submodule deinit --all" for deinitializing all submodules
  * A couple of bugs around core.autocrlf have been fixed.
  * "git difftool" learned to handle unmerged paths correctly in
    dir-diff mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 19:40:48 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.8.3:
 * "git send-email" now uses a more readable timestamps when
   formulating a message ID.
 * When "git worktree" feature is in use, "git branch -d" allowed
   deletion of a branch that is checked out in another worktree
 * When "git worktree" feature is in use, "git branch -m" renamed a
   branch that is checked out in another worktree without adjusting
   the HEAD symbolic ref for the worktree.
 * "git format-patch --help" showed `-s` and `--no-patch` as if these
   are valid options to the command.  We already hide `--patch` option
   from the documentation, because format-patch is about showing the
   diff, and the documentation now hides these options as well.
 * A change back in version 2.7 to "git branch" broke display of a
   symbolic ref in a non-standard place in the refs/ hierarchy (we
   expect symbolic refs to appear in refs/remotes/*/HEAD to point at
   the primary branch the remote has, and as .git/HEAD to point at the
   branch we locally checked out).
 * A partial rewrite of "git submodule" in the 2.7 timeframe changed
   the way the gitdir: pointer in the submodules point at the real
   repository location to use absolute paths by accident.  This has
   been corrected.
 * "git commit" misbehaved in a few minor ways when an empty message
   is given via -m '', all of which has been corrected.
 * Support for CRAM-MD5 authentication method in "git imap-send" did
   not work well.
 * The socks5:// proxy support added back in 2.6.4 days was not aware
   that socks5h:// proxies behave differently.
 * "git config" had a codepath that tried to pass a NULL to
   printf("%s"), which nobody seems to have noticed.
 * "git replace -e" did not honour "core.editor" configuration.
 * "git submodule" reports the paths of submodules the command
   recurses into, but this was incorrect when the command was not run
   from the root level of the superproject.
 * The "user.useConfigOnly" configuration variable makes it an error
   if users do not explicitly set user.name and user.email.  However,
   its check was not done early enough and allowed another error to
   trigger, reporting that the default value we guessed from the
   system setting was unusable.  This was a suboptimal end-user
   experience as we want the users to set user.name/user.email without
   relying on the auto-detection at all.
 * "git mv old new" did not adjust the path for a submodule that lives
   as a subdirectory inside old/ directory correctly.
 * "git push" from a corrupt repository that attempts to push a large
   number of refs deadlocked; the thread to relay rejection notices
   for these ref updates blocked on writing them to the main thread,
   after the main thread at the receiving end notices that the push
   failed and decides not to read these notices and return a failure.
 * A question by "git send-email" to ask the identity of the sender
   has been updated.
 * Recent update to Git LFS broke "git p4" by changing the output from
   its "lfs pointer" subcommand.
 * Some multi-byte encoding can have a backslash byte as a later part
   of one letter, which would confuse "highlight" filter used in
   gitweb.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 30 12:15:11 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.8.2:
 * "index-pack --keep=<msg>" was broken since v2.1.0 timeframe.
 * "git config --get-urlmatch", unlike other variants of the "git
   config --get" family, did not signal error with its exit status
   when there was no matching configuration.
 * The "--local-env-vars" and "--resolve-git-dir" options of "git
   rev-parse" failed to work outside a repository when the command's
   option parsing was rewritten in 1.8.5 era.
 * Fetching of history by naming a commit object name directly didn't
   work across remote-curl transport.
 * A small memory leak in an error codepath has been plugged in xdiff
   code.
 * "git mergetool" did not work well with conflicts that both sides
   deleted.
 * "git send-email" had trouble parsing alias file in mailrc format
   when lines in it had trailing whitespaces on them.
 * When "git merge --squash" stopped due to conflict, the concluding
   "git commit" failed to read in the SQUASH_MSG that shows the log
   messages from all the squashed commits.
 * "git merge FETCH_HEAD" dereferenced NULL pointer when merging
   nothing into an unborn history (which is arguably unusual usage,
   which perhaps was the reason why nobody noticed it).
 * "git diff -M" used to work better when two originally identical
   files A and B got renamed to X/A and X/B by pairing A to X/A and B
   to X/B, but this was broken in the 2.0 timeframe.
 * "git send-pack --all <there>" was broken when its command line
   option parsing was written in the 2.6 timeframe.
 * When running "git blame $path" with unnormalized data in the index
   for the path, the data in the working tree was blamed, even though
   "git add" would not have changed what is already in the index, due
   to "safe crlf" that disables the line-end conversion.  It has been
   corrected.

 * "git show 'HEAD:Foo[BAR]Baz'" did not interpret the argument as a
   rev, i.e. the object named by the the pathname with wildcard
   characters in a tree object.
 * "git rev-parse --git-common-dir" used in the worktree feature
   misbehaved when run from a subdirectory.
 * The "v(iew)" subcommand of the interactive "git am -i" command was
   broken in 2.6.0 timeframe when the command was rewritten in C.
 * "git merge-tree" used to mishandle "both sides added" conflict with
   its own "create a fake ancestor file that has the common parts of
   what both sides have added and do a 3-way merge" logic; this has
   been updated to use the usual "3-way merge with an empty blob as
   the fake common ancestor file" approach used in the rest of the
   system.
 * The documentation did not clearly state that the 'simple' mode is
   now the default for "git push" when push.default configuration is
   not set.
 * Test adjustments for GNU grep, obsoleting
   git-2.7.1-fix-tests-grep-2.23.patch
 * "git config section.var value" to set a value in per-repository
   configuration file failed when it was run outside any repository,
   but didn't say the reason correctly.

- git 2.7.2:
  * improvements placing conflict markers with different line
    terminators
  * "git worktree" fixes for manually moved paths
  * "git push --force-with-lease" has been taught to report if the
    push needed to force (or fast-forwarded).
  * vimdiff backend improvements for "git mergetool": buffer order
  * improvements for handling paths added to index with "add -N"
    which are not in the index yet

- git 2.6.5:
  * Update "git subtree" (in contrib/) so that it can take
    whitespaces in the pathnames, not only in the in-tree pathname
    but the name of the directory that the repository is in.
  * "git p4" used to import Perforce CLs that touch only paths
    outside the client spec as empty commits. It has been
    corrected to ignorethem instead, with a new configuration
    git-p4.keepEmptyCommits as a backward compatibility knob.
  * Improve error reporting when SMTP TLS fails.
  * "git symbolic-ref" forgot to report a failure with its exit
    status.
  * History traversal with "git log --source" that starts with an
    annotated tag failed to report the tag as "source", due to an
    old regression in the command line parser back in v2.2 days.

- git 2.6.1, with a security fix:
 * Make xdiff code handle extremely large files, cap around 1GB.
 * Some protocols (like git-remote-ext) can execute arbitrary code
   found in the URL.  The URLs that submodules use may come from
   arbitrary sources (e.g., .gitmodules files in a remote
   repository), and can hurt those who blindly enable recursive
   fetch.  Restrict the allowed protocols to well known and safe
   ones. [boo#948969]

Fri Jul 17 10:41:11 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.4.6:
 * "git fetch --depth=<depth>" and "git clone --depth=<depth>"
   issued a shallow transfer request even to an upload-pack that
   does not support the capability.
 * "git fsck" used to ignore missing or invalid objects recorded in
    reflog.
 * The tcsh completion writes a bash scriptlet but that would have
   failed for users with noclobber set.
 * "git format-patch --ignore-if-upstream A..B" did not like to be
   fed tags as boundary commits.
- git-tcsh-completion-fixes.diff adjusted for context changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 26 12:13:19 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.4.5:

  * ""git rebase -i" fired post-rewrite hook when it shouldn't
    (namely, when it was told to stop sequencing with 'exec' insn).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 17 19:16:05 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.4.4:
 * l10n updates for German.
 * An earlier leakfix to bitmap testing code was incomplete.
 * "git clean pathspec..." tried to lstat(2) and complain even for
   paths outside the given pathspec.
 * Communication between the HTTP server and http_backend process can
   lead to a dead-lock when relaying a large ref negotiation request.
   Diagnose the situation better, and mitigate it by reading such a
   request first into core (to a reasonable limit).
 * The clean/smudge interface did not work well when filtering an
   empty contents (failed and then passed the empty input through).
   It can be argued that a filter that produces anything but empty for
   an empty input is nonsense, but if the user wants to do strange
   things, then why not?
 * Make "git stash something --help" error out, so that users can
   safely say "git stash drop --help".
 * Clarify that "log --raw" and "log --format=raw" are unrelated
   concepts.
 * Catch a programmer mistake to feed a pointer not an array to
   ARRAY_SIZE() macro, by using a couple of GCC extensions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * fix memory leaks and resource exhaustion errors
  * documentation fixes
  * Fix core.excludesfile priorities

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 27 18:21:16 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.4.2:
 * "git rev-list --objects $old --not --all" to see if everything that
   is reachable from $old is already connected to the existing refs
   was very inefficient.
 * "hash-object --literally" introduced in v2.2 was not prepared to
   take a really long object type name.
 * "git rebase --quiet" was not quite quiet when there is nothing to
   do.
 * The completion for "log --decorate=" parameter value was incorrect.
 * "filter-branch" corrupted commit log message that ends with an
   incomplete line on platforms with some "sed" implementations that
   munge such a line.  Work it around by avoiding to use "sed".
 * "git daemon" fails to build from the source under NO_IPV6
   configuration (regression in 2.4).
 * "git stash pop/apply" forgot to make sure that not just the working
   tree is clean but also the index is clean. The latter is important
   as a stash application can conflict and the index will be used for
   conflict resolution.
 * No longer prepend $GIT_EXEC_PATH and install path to path of
   executed subprograms and hooks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 * "git cat-file bl $blob" failed to barf even though there is no
   object type that is "bl".
 * Improvements for repositories on NFS

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  4 10:24:41 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.4.0
* "git push" has been taught an "--atomic" option that makes a push
  that updates more than one ref an "all-or-none" affair.
* Output from "git log --decorate" now distinguishes between a
  detached HEAD vs. a HEAD that points at a branch.
* The phrasing `git branch` uses to describe a detached HEAD has
  been updated to agree with the phrasing used by `git status`.
* A new "push.followTags" configuration turns the "--follow-tags"
  option on by default for the `git push` command.
- Retrieve tarball signature

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 28 15:56:38 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.3.7:
 * An earlier update to the parser that disects a URL broke an
   address, followed by a colon, followed by an empty string (instead
   of the port number), e.g. ssh://example.com:/path/to/repo.
 * The completion script (in contrib/) contaminated global namespace
   and clobbered on a shell variable $x.
 * The "git push --signed" protocol extension did not limit what the
   "nonce" that is a server-chosen string can contain or how long it
   can be, which was unnecessarily lax.  Limit both the length and the
   alphabet to a reasonably small space that can still have enough
   entropy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 26 18:09:29 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.3.6:
 * "diff-highlight" (in contrib/) multibyte character support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  2 22:12:30 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.3.5:
 * The prompt script (in contrib/) did not show the untracked sign
   when working in a subdirectory without any untracked files.
 * Even though "git grep --quiet" is run merely to ask for the exit
   status, we spawned the pager regardless.  Stop doing that.
 * Recommend format-patch and send-email for those who want to
   submit patches to this project.
 * An failure early in the "git clone" that started creating the
   working tree and repository could have resulted in some
   directories and files left without getting cleaned up.
 * "git fetch" that fetches a commit using the allow-tip-sha1-in-want
   extension could have failed to fetch all the requested refs.
 * The split-index mode introduced at v2.3.0-rc0~41 was broken in
   the codepath to protect us against a broken reimplementation of
   Git  that writes an invalid index with duplicated index entries,
   etc.
 * "git prune" used to largely ignore broken refs when deciding
   which objects are still being used, which could spread an
   existing small damage and make it a larger one.
 * "git tag -h" used to show the "--column" and "--sort" options
   that are about listing in a wrong section.
 * The transfer.hiderefs support did not quite work for smart-http
   transport.
 * The code that reads from the ctags file in the completion script
   (in contrib/) did not spell ${param/pattern/string} substitution
   correctly, which happened to work with bash but not with zsh.
 * The explanation on "rebase --preserve-merges", "pull
   --rebase=preserve", and "push --force-with-lease" in the
   documentation was unclear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 24 06:52:33 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.3.4:
 * The 'color.status.unmerged' configuration was not described.
 * "git log --decorate" did not reset colors correctly around the
   branch names.
 * "git -C '' subcmd" refused to work in the current directory, unlike
   "cd ''" which silently behaves as a no-op.
 * "git imap-send" learned to optionally talk with an IMAP server via
   libcURL; because there is no other option when Git is built with
   NO_OPENSSL option, use that codepath by default under such
   configuration.
 * A workaround for certain build of GPG that triggered false breakage
   in a test has been added.
 * "git rebase -i" recently started to include the number of
   commits in the insn sheet to be processed, but on a platform
   that prepends leading whitespaces to "wc -l" output, the numbers
   are shown with extra whitespaces that aren't necessary.
 * We did not parse username followed by literal IPv6 address in SSH
   transport URLs, e.g. ssh://user@[2001:db8::1]:22/repo.git
   correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 14 19:05:25 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.3.3:
 * A corrupt input to "git diff -M" used cause us to segfault.
 * The borrowed code in kwset API did not follow our usual convention
   to use "unsigned char" to store values that range from 0-255.
 * Description given by "grep -h" for its --exclude-standard option
   was phrased poorly.
 * Documentaton for "git remote add" mentioned "--tags" and
   "--no-tags" and it was not clear that fetch from the remote in
   the future will use the default behaviour when neither is given
   to override it.
 * "git diff --shortstat --dirstat=changes" showed a dirstat based on
   lines that was never asked by the end user in addition to the
   dirstat that the user asked for.
 * The interaction between "git submodule update" and the
   submodule.*.update configuration was not clearly documented.
 * "git apply" was not very careful about reading from, removing,
   updating and creating paths outside the working tree (under
   --index/--cached) or the current directory (when used as a
   replacement for GNU patch).
 * "git daemon" looked up the hostname even when "%CH" and "%IP"
   interpolations are not requested, which was unnecessary.
 * The "interpolated-path" option of "git daemon" inserted any string
   client declared on the "host=" capability request without checking.
   Sanitize and limit %H and %CH to a saner and a valid DNS name.

- Fix missing /usr/share/tcsh/git.complete (bnc#919105):
  git-tcsh-completion-fixes.diff was refreshed for generating the
  script correctly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  7 06:20:42 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.3.2:
 * "update-index --refresh" used to leak when an entry cannot be
   refreshed for whatever reason.
 * "git fast-import" used to crash when it could not close and
   conclude the resulting packfile cleanly.
 * "git blame" died, trying to free an uninitialized piece of memory.
 * "git merge-file" did not work correctly in a subdirectory.
 * "git submodule add" failed to squash "path/to/././submodule" to
   "path/to/submodule".
 * In v2.2.0, we broke "git prune" that runs in a repository that
   borrows from an alternate object store.
 * Certain older vintages of cURL give irregular output from
   "curl-config --vernum", which confused our build system.
 * Longstanding configuration variable naming rules has been added to
   the documentation.
 * Older GnuPG implementations may not correctly import the keyring
   material we prepare for the tests to use.
 * Clarify in the documentation that "remote.<nick>.pushURL" and
   "remote.<nick>.URL" are there to name the same repository accessed
   via different transports, not two separate repositories.
 * The pack bitmap support did not build with older versions of GCC.
 * Reading configuration from a blob object, when it ends with a lone
   CR, use to confuse the configuration parser.
 * We didn't format an integer that wouldn't fit in "int" but in
   "uintmax_t" correctly.
 * "git push --signed" gave an incorrectly worded error message when
   the other side did not support the capability.
 * "git fetch" over a remote-helper that cannot respond to "list"
   command could not fetch from a symbolic reference e.g. HEAD.
 * The insn sheet "git rebase -i" creates did not fully honor
   core.abbrev settings.
 * The tests that wanted to see that file becomes unreadable after
   running "chmod a-r file", and the tests that wanted to make sure it
   is not run as root, we used "can we write into the / directory?" as
   a cheap substitute, but on some platforms that is not a good
   heuristics.  The tests and their prerequisites have been updated to
   check what they really require.
 * The configuration variable 'mailinfo.scissors' was hard to
   discover in the documentation.
 * Correct a breakage to git-svn around v2.2 era that triggers
   premature closing of FileHandle.
 * Even though we officially haven't dropped Perl 5.8 support, the
   Getopt::Long package that came with it does not support "--no-"
   prefix to negate a boolean option; manually add support to help
   people with older Getopt::Long package.

- Don't install dummy hg and bzr remote helpers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 26 17:14:53 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- git 2.3.1:
 * The interactive "show a list and let the user choose from it"
   interface "add -i" used showed and prompted to the user even when
   the candidate list was empty, against which the only "choice" the
   user could have made was to choose nothing.
 * "git apply --whitespace=fix" used to under-allocate the memory
   when the fix resulted in a longer text than the original patch.
 * "git log --help" used to show rev-list options that are irrelevant
   to the "log" command.
 * The error message from "git commit", when a non-existing author
   name was given as value to the "--author=" parameter, has been
   reworded to avoid misunderstanding.
 * A broken pack .idx file in the receiving repository prevented the
   dumb http transport from fetching a good copy of it from the other
   side.
 * The documentation incorrectly said that C(opy) and R(ename) are the
   only ones that can be followed by the score number in the output in
   the --raw format.
 * Fix a misspelled conditional that is always true.
 * Code to read branch name from various files in .git/ directory
   would have misbehaved if the code to write them left an empty file.
 * The "git push" documentation made the "--repo=<there>" option
   easily misunderstood.
 * After attempting and failing a password-less authentication
   (e.g. kerberos), libcURL refuses to fall back to password based
   Basic authentication without a bit of help/encouragement.
 * Setting diff.submodule to 'log' made "git format-patch" produce
   broken patches.
 * "git rerere" (invoked internally from many mergy operations) did
   not correctly signal errors when told to update the working tree
   files and failed to do so for whatever reason.
 * "git blame HEAD -- missing" failed to correctly say "HEAD" when it
   tried to say "No such path 'missing' in HEAD".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  6 15:59:55 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

  * "git interpret-trailers" learned to properly handle the
    "Conflicts:" block at the end.
  * "git am" learned "--message-id" option
  * "git clone --reference=<over there>" learned the "--dissociate"
    option
  * "git send-email" learned the "--transfer-encoding" option
  * "git send-email" learned the "--no-xmailer" option
  * "git branch -d" (delete) and "git branch -m" (move) learned to
    honor "-f" (force) flag
  * "git imap-send" learned to take "-v" (verbose) and "-q" (quiet)
    command line options.

- git 2.2.2:
  + "git checkout $treeish $path", when $path in the index and the
    working tree already matched what is in $treeish at the $path,
    still overwrote the $path unnecessarily.
  + "git config --get-color" did not parse its command line arguments
    carefully.
  + A few code paths used abs() when they should have used labs() on
    long integers.
  + "gitweb" used to depend on a behaviour recent CGI.pm deprecated.
  + "git init" (hence "git clone") initialized the per-repository
    configuration file .git/config with x-bit by mistake.
  + Git 2.0 was supposed to make the "simple" mode for the default of
    "git push", but it didn't.
  + "Everyday" document had a broken link.
  + The build procedure did not bother fixing perl and python scripts
    when NO_PERL and NO_PYTHON build-time configuration changed.
  + The code that reads the reflog from the newer to the older entries
    did not handle an entry that crosses a boundary of block it uses to
    read them correctly.
  + "git apply" was described in the documentation to take --ignore-date
    option, which it does not.
  + Traditionally we tried to avoid interpreting date strings given by
    the user as future dates, e.g. GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=2014-12-10 when
    used early November 2014 was taken as "October 12, 2014" because it
    is likely that a date in the future, December 10, is a mistake.
    This heuristics has been loosened to allow people to express future
    dates (most notably, --until=<date> may want to be far in the
    future) and we no longer tiebreak by future-ness of the date when
    (1) ISO-like format is used, and
    (2) the string can make sense interpreted as both y-m-d and y-d-m.
    Git may still have to use the heuristics to tiebreak between dd/mm/yy
    and mm/dd/yy, though.
  + The code to abbreviate an object name to its short unique prefix
    has been optimized when no abbreviation was requested.
  + "git add --ignore-errors ..." did not ignore an error to
    give a file that did not exist.
  + Git did not correctly read an overlong refname from a packed refs
    file.

- git 2.2.1
  Fixes arbitrary command execution vulnerability on case-
  insensitive file systems. [boo#910756] [CVE-2014-9390]

  such commits to propagate to third parties (Windows, OS X) that
  may be vulnerable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 29 20:28:18 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 2.1.3:
  * Some MUAs mangled a line in a message that begins with "From "
    to ">From " when writing to a mailbox file and feeding such an
    input to "git am" used to lose such a line.
  * "git daemon" (with NO_IPV6 build configuration) used to
     incorrectly use the hostname even when gethostbyname()
     reported that the given hostname is not found.
  * Newer versions of 'meld' breaks the auto-detection we use to
    see if they are new enough to support the `--output` option.
  * "git pack-objects" forgot to disable the codepath to generate
    object recheability bitmap when it needs to split the resulting
    pack.
  * "gitweb" used deprecated CGI::startfrom, which was removed from
    CGI.pm as of 4.04; use CGI::start_from instead.
  * "git log" documentation had an example section marked up not
    quite correctly, which passed AsciiDoc but failed with

Tue Sep 30 20:32:08 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 2.1.2:
  * "git push" over HTTP transport had an artificial limit on
    number of refs that can be pushed imposed by the command line
    length.
  * When receiving an invalid pack stream that records the same
    object twice, multiple threads got confused due to a race.
  * An attempt to remove the entire tree in the "git fast-import"
    input stream caused it to misbehave.
  * Reachability check (used in "git prune" and friends) did not
    add a detached HEAD as a starting point to traverse
    objects still in use.
  * "git config --add section.var val" used to lose existing
    section.var whose value was an empty string.
  * "git fsck" failed to report that it found corrupt objects via
    its exit status in some cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 20 07:45:00 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 2.1.1:
 * Git 2.0 had a regression where "git fetch" into a shallowly
   cloned repository from a repository with bitmap object index
   enabled did not work correctly.  This has been corrected.
 * Git 2.0 had a regression which broke (rarely used) "git diff-tree
   -t".  This has been corrected.
 * "git log --pretty/format=" with an empty format string did not
   mean the more obvious "No output whatsoever" but "Use default
   format", which was counterintuitive.  Now it means "nothing shown
   for the log message part".
 * "git -c section.var command" and "git -c section.var= command"
   should pass the configuration differently (the former should be a
   boolean true, the latter should be an empty string), but they
   didn't work that way.  Now it does.
 * Applying a patch not generated by Git in a subdirectory used to
   check the whitespace breakage using the attributes for incorrect
   paths. Also whitespace checks were performed even for paths
   excluded via "git apply --exclude=<path>" mechanism.
 * "git bundle create" with date-range specification were meant to
   exclude tags outside the range, but it did not work correctly.
 * "git add x" where x that used to be a directory has become a
   symbolic link to a directory misbehaved.
 * The prompt script checked $GIT_DIR/ref/stash file to see if there
   is a stash, which was a no-no.
 * "git checkout -m" did not switch to another branch while carrying
   the local changes forward when a path was deleted from the index.
 * With sufficiently long refnames, fast-import could have overflown
   an on-stack buffer.
 * After "pack-refs --prune" packed refs at the top-level, it failed
   to prune them.
 * "git gc --auto" triggered from "git fetch --quiet" was not quiet.

  * fix output of "git diff-tree" broken since 2.0.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 26 21:24:51 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 2.0.3:
 * An ancient rewrite passed a wrong pointer to a curl library
   function in a rarely used code path.
 * "filter-branch" left an empty single-parent commit that results
   when all parents of a merge commit gets mapped to the same
   commit, even under "--prune-empty".
 * "log --show-signature" incorrectly decided the color to paint a
   mergetag that was and was not correctly validated.
 * "log --show-signature" did not pay attention to "--graph" option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 24 05:05:47 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 2.0.2:
 * Documentation for "git submodule sync" forgot to say that the subcommand
   can take the "--recursive" option.
 * Mishandling of patterns in .gitignore that has trailing SPs quoted
   with backslashes (e.g. ones that end with "\ ") have been
   corrected.
 * Recent updates to "git repack" started to duplicate objects that
   are in packfiles marked with .keep flag into the new packfile by
   mistake.
 * "git clone -b brefs/tags/bar" would have mistakenly thought we were
   following a single tag, even though it was a name of the branch,
   because it incorrectly used strstr().
 * "%G" (nothing after G) is an invalid pretty format specifier, but
   the parser did not notice it as garbage.
 * Code to avoid adding the same alternate object store twice was
   subtly broken for a long time, but nobody seems to have noticed.
 * A handful of code paths had to read the commit object more than
   once when showing header fields that are usually not parsed.  The
   internal data structure to keep track of the contents of the commit
   object has been updated to reduce the need for this double-reading,
   and to allow the caller find the length of the object.
 * During "git rebase --merge", a conflicted patch could not be
   skipped with "--skip" if the next one also conflicted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 16 23:18:17 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 2.0.0
- Backward compatibility notes:
  * git push now uses "simple" semantics by default instead of
    old "matching", use variable "push.default" to revert
  * "git add -u" and "git add -A" operate on entire tree, use
    "git add -u ." or "git add -A ." for current directory only.
  * "git add <path>" is the same as "git add -A <path>" now, use
    "git add --ignore-removal <path>" for previous behaviour
  * "-q" option of "git diff-files" has been removed. To ignore
     deletion, use "git diff-files --diff-filter=d"
  * "git request-pull" lost a few "heuristics"
  * default prefix for "git svn" remote-tracking branches changed
    from refs/remotes to refs/remotes/origin/ unless with "--prefix"
- Updates, fixes and features as listed in:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 11 20:36:00 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 1.9.4:
   * Commands that take pathspecs on the command line misbehaved
     when the pathspec is given as an absolute pathname (which is a
     practice not particularly encouraged) that points at a
     symbolic link in the working tree.
   * An earlier fix to the shell prompt script (in contrib/) for
     using the PROMPT_COMMAND interface did not correctly check if
     the extra code path needs to trigger, causing the branch name
     not to appear when 'promptvars' option is disabled in bash or
     PROMPT_SUBST is unset in zsh.
- switch to xz tarball form kernel.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 11 15:51:39 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 1.9.3:
 * "git p4" dealing with changes in binary files were broken by a
   change in 1.9 release.
 * The shell prompt script (in contrib/), when using the
   PROMPT_COMMAND interface, used an unsafe construct when showing
   the branch name in $PS1.
 * Some more Unicode codepoints defined in Unicode 6.3 as having
   zero width have been taught to our display column counting
   logic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 13 20:19:26 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- git 1.9.2:
  * Fix an issue with "git fetch --prune" removing paths on
    multiple fetch
  * "git update-ref --stdin" did not fail a request to create a
    ref when the ref already existed.
  * "git diff --no-index -Mq a b" fell into an infinite loop.
  * Do not override GIT_EDITOR when no commit message is required
    to not affect other uses
  * "git status --porcelain --branch" showed its output with labels
    "ahead/behind/gone" translated to the user's locale.
  * "git mv" that moves a submodule forgot to adjust the array that
     uses to keep track of which submodules were to be moved to
     update its configuration
  * Length limit for the pathname used when removing a path in a
    deep subdirectory has been removed to avoid buffer overflows.
  * "git index-pack" used a wrong variable to name the keep-file in
    an error message when the file cannot be written or closed.
  * "rebase -i" produced a broken insn sheet when the title of a
    commit happened to contain '\n' (or ended with '\c') due to a
    careless use of 'echo'.
  * Serving objects from a shallow repository needs to write a
    new file to hold the temporary shallow boundaries but it was not
    cleaned when we exit due to die() or a signal.
  * When "git stash pop" stops after failing to apply the stash
    (e.g. due to conflicting changes), the stash is not dropped.
    State that explicitly in the output to let the users know.
  * The labels in "git status" output that describe the nature of
    conflicts (e.g. "both deleted") were limited to 20 bytes, which
    was too short for some l10n (e.g. fr).
  * minor documentation updates

  * The test coverage framework was left broken for some time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 30 01:57:15 UTC 2013 - douglarek@outlook.com

- updated to version 1.8.1.2:

     * An element on GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES list that does not name the
       real path to a directory (i.e. a symbolic link) could have caused
       the GIT_DIR discovery logic to escape the ceiling.

     * Command line completion for "tcsh" emitted an unwanted space
       after completing a single directory name.

     * Command line completion leaked an unnecessary error message while
       looking for possible matches with paths in <tree-ish>.

     * "git archive" did not record uncompressed size in the header when
       streaming a zip archive, which confused some implementations of unzip.

     * When users spelled "cc:" in lowercase in the fake "header" in the
       trailer part, "git send-email" failed to pick up the addresses from
       there. As e-mail headers field names are case insensitive, this
       script should follow suit and treat "cc:" and "Cc:" the same way.

    Also contains various documentation fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 14 00:46:08 UTC 2012 - douglarek@outlook.com

- updated to version 1.8.0.2:

     * Various codepaths have workaround for a common misconfiguration to
       spell "UTF-8" as "utf8", but it was not used uniformly.  Most
       notably, mailinfo (which is used by "git am") lacked this support.

     * We failed to mention a file without any content change but whose
       permission bit was modified, or (worse yet) a new file without any
       content in the "git diff --stat" output.

     * When "--stat-count" hides a diffstat for binary contents, the total
       number of added and removed lines at the bottom was computed
       incorrectly.

     * When "--stat-count" hides a diffstat for unmerged paths, the total
       number of affected files at the bottom of the "diff --stat" output
       was computed incorrectly.

     * "diff --shortstat" miscounted the total number of affected files
       when there were unmerged paths.

     * "git p4" used to try expanding malformed "$keyword$" that spans
       across multiple lines.

     * "git update-ref -d --deref SYM" to delete a ref through a symbolic
       ref that points to it did not remove it correctly.

     * Syntax highlighting in "gitweb" was not quite working.

    Also contains other minor fixes and documentation updates.

     * a lot of features.

     * minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.

     * all the fixes since v1.7.12.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 18 14:50:30 UTC 2012 - douglarek@outlook.com

- updated to version 1.7.12.4:

     * "git fetch" over the dumb-http revision walker could segfault when
       curl's multi interface was used.

     * It was possible to give specific paths for "asciidoc" and other
       tools in the documentation toolchain, but not for "xmlto".

     * "gitweb" did not give the correct committer timezone in its feed
       output due to a typo.

     * The "-Xours" (and similarly -Xtheirs) backend option to "git
       merge -s recursive" was ignored for binary files.  Now it is
       honored.

     * The "binary" synthetic attribute made "diff" to treat the path as
       binary, but not "merge".

    Also contains many documentation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 11 00:19:07 CST 2012 - douglarek@outlook.com

- updated to version 1.7.12.3:

     * "git am" mishandled a patch attached as application/octet-stream
       (e.g. not text/*); Content-Transfer-Encoding (e.g. base64) was not
       honored correctly.

     * It was unclear in the documentation for "git blame" that it is
       unnecessary for users to use the "--follow" option.

     * A repository created with "git clone --single" had its fetch
       refspecs set up just like a clone without "--single", leading the
       subsequent "git fetch" to slurp all the other branches, defeating
       the whole point of specifying "only this branch".

     * "git fetch" over http had an old workaround for an unlikely server
       misconfiguration; it turns out that this hurts debuggability of the
       configuration in general, and has been reverted.

     * "git fetch" over http advertised that it supports "deflate", which
       is much less common, and did not advertise the more common "gzip" on
       its Accept-Encoding header.

     * "git receive-pack" (the counterpart to "git push") did not give
       progress output while processing objects it received to the puser
       when run over the smart-http protocol.

     * "git status" honored the ignore=dirty settings in .gitmodules but
       "git commit" didn't.

    Also contains a handful of documentation updates.

- Use ./.make also in %check to test exactly what was built
- Avoid duplicate file warnings

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  4 22:29:10 CST 2012 - douglarek@outlook.com

- updated to version 1.7.12.2:

     * When "git am" is fed an input that has multiple "Content-type: ..."
       header, it did not grok charset= attribute correctly.

     * Even during a conflicted merge, "git blame $path" always meant to
       blame uncommitted changes to the "working tree" version; make it
       more useful by showing cleanly merged parts as coming from the other
       branch that is being merged.

     * "git blame MAKEFILE" run in a history that has "Makefile" but not
       "MAKEFILE" should say "No such file MAKEFILE in HEAD", but got
       confused on a case insensitive filesystem and failed to do so.

     * "git fetch --all", when passed "--no-tags", did not honor the
       "--no-tags" option while fetching from individual remotes (the same
       issue existed with "--tags", but combination "--all --tags" makes
       much less sense than "--all --no-tags").

     * "git log/diff/format-patch --stat" showed the "N line(s) added"
       comment in user's locale and caused careless submitters to send
       patches with such a line in them to projects whose project language
       is not their language, mildly irritating others. Localization to
       the line has been disabled for now.

     * "git log --all-match --grep=A --grep=B" ought to show commits that
       mention both A and B, but when these three options are used with
       --author or --committer, it showed commits that mention either A or
       B (or both) instead.

     * The subcommand to remove the definition of a remote in "git remote"
       was named "rm" even though all other subcommands were spelled out.
       Introduce "git remote remove" to remove confusion, and keep "rm" as
       a backward compatible synonym.

    Also contains a handful of documentation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 25 00:01:38 CST 2012 - douglarek@outlook.com

- updated to version 1.7.12.1:

    * "git apply -p0" did not parse pathnames on "diff --git" line
       correctly.  This caused patches that had pathnames in no other
       places to be mistakenly rejected (most notably, binary patch that
       does not rename nor change mode).  Textual patches, renames or mode
       changes have preimage and postimage pathnames in different places
       in a form that can be parsed unambiguously and did not suffer from
       this problem.

     * "git cherry-pick A C B" used to replay changes in A and then B and
       then C if these three commits had committer timestamps in that
       order, which is not what the user who said "A C B" naturally
       expects.

     * "git commit --amend" let the user edit the log message and then
       died when the human-readable committer name was given
       insufficiently by getpwent(3).

     * Some capabilities were asked by fetch-pack even when upload-pack
       did not advertise that they are available.  fetch-pack has been
       fixed not to do so.

     * "git diff" had a confusion between taking data from a path in the
       working tree and taking data from an object that happens to have
       name 0{40} recorded in a tree.

     * "git for-each-ref" did not correctly support more than one --sort
       option.

     * "git log .." errored out saying it is both rev range and a path
       when there is no disambiguating "--" is on the command line.
       Update the command line parser to interpret ".." as a path in such
       a case.

     * The "--topo-order", "--date-order" (and the lack of either means
       the default order) options to "rev-list" and "log" family of
       commands were poorly described in the documentation.

     * "git prune" without "-v" used to warn about leftover temporary
       files (which is an indication of an earlier aborted operation).

     * Pushing to smart HTTP server with recent Git fails without having
       the username in the URL to force authentication, if the server is
       configured to allow GET anonymously, while requiring authentication
       for POST.

     * The reflog entries left by "git rebase" and "git rebase -i" were
       inconsistent (the interactive one gave an abbreviated object name).

     * When "git push" triggered the automatic gc on the receiving end, a
       message from "git prune" that said it was removing cruft leaked to
       the standard output, breaking the communication protocol.

     * "git show --quiet" ought to be a synonym for "git show -s", but
       wasn't.

     * "git show --format='%ci'" did not give timestamp correctly for
       commits created without human readable name on "committer" line.

     * "git send-email" did not unquote encoded words that appear on the
       header correctly, and lost "_" from strings.

     * The interactive prompt "git send-email" gives was error prone. It
       asked "What e-mail address do you want to use?" with the address it
       guessed (correctly) the user would want to use in its prompt,
       tempting the user to say "y". But the response was taken as "No,
       please use 'y' as the e-mail address instead", which is most
       certainly not what the user meant.

     * "gitweb" when used with PATH_INFO failed to notice directories with
       SP (and other characters that need URL-style quoting) in them.

     * When the user gives an argument that can be taken as both a
       revision name and a pathname without disambiguating with "--", we
       used to give a help message "Use '--' to separate".  The message
       has been clarified to show where that '--' goes on the command
       line.

     * When the user exports a non-default IFS without HT, scripts that
       rely on being able to parse "ls-files -s | while read a b c..."
       started to fail.  Protect them from such a misconfiguration.

     * The attribute system may be asked for a path that itself or its
       leading directories no longer exists in the working tree, and it is
       fine if we cannot open .gitattribute file in such a case.  Failure
       to open per-directory .gitattributes with error status other than
       ENOENT and ENOTDIR should be diagnosed, but it wasn't.

     * After "gitk" showed the contents of a tag, neither "Reread
       references" nor "Reload" did not update what is shown as the
       contents of it, when the user overwrote the tag with "git tag -f".

     * "ciabot" script (in contrib/) has been updated with extensive
       documentation.

     * "git-jump" script (in contrib/) did not work well when
       diff.noprefix or diff.mnemonicprefix is in effect.

     * Older parts of the documentation described as if having a regular
       file in .git/refs/ hierarchy were the only way to have branches and
       tags, which is not true for quite some time.

     * A utility shell function test_seq has been added as a replacement
       for the 'seq' utility found on some platforms.

     * Compatibility wrapper to learn the maximum number of file
       descriptors we can open around sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX) and
       getrlimit(RLIMIT_NO_FILE) has been introduced for portability.

     * We used curl_easy_strerror() without checking version of cURL,
       breaking the build for versions before curl 7.12.0.

     * Code to work around MacOS X UTF-8 gotcha has been cleaned up.

     * Fallback 'getpass' implementation made unportable use of stdio API.

     * The "--rebase" option to "git pull" can be abbreviated to "-r",
       but we didn't document it.

     * It was generally understood that "--long-option"s to many of our
       subcommands can be abbreviated to the unique prefix, but it was not
       easy to find it described for new readers of the documentation set.

     * The synopsis said "checkout [-B branch]" to make it clear the
       branch name is a parameter to the option, but the heading for the
       option description was "-B::", not "-B branch::", making the
       documentation misleading.

    Also contains numerous documentation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 16 11:57:53 CEST 2012 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to version 1.7.11.5:
  * The Makefile rule to create assembly output (primarily for
   debugging purposes) did not create it next to the source.
 * The code to avoid mistaken attempt to add the object directory
   itself as its own alternate could read beyond end of a string while
   comparison.
 * On some architectures, "block-sha1" did not compile correctly
   when compilers inferred alignment guarantees from our source we
   did not intend to make.
 * When talking to a remote running ssh on IPv6 enabled host, whose
   address is spelled as "[HOST]:PORT", we did not parse the address
   correctly and failed to connect.
 * git-blame.el (in compat/) have been updated to use Elisp more
   correctly.
 * "git checkout <branchname>" to come back from a detached HEAD state
   incorrectly computed reachability of the detached HEAD, resulting
   in unnecessary warnings.
 * "git mergetool" did not support --tool-help option to give the list
   of supported backends, like "git difftool" does.
 * "git grep" stopped spawning an external "grep" long time ago, but a
   duplicated test to check internal and external "grep" was left
   behind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 29 11:13:32 CEST 2012 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to version 1.7.10.3:
 * From this release on, the "git merge" command in an interactive
   session will start an editor when it automatically resolves the
   merge for the user to explain the resulting commit, just like the
   "git commit" command does when it wasn't given a commit message.

 * The "--binary/-b" options to "git am" have been a no-op for quite a
   while and were deprecated in mid 2008 (v1.6.0).  When you give these
   options to "git am", it will now warn and ask you not to use them.

 * When you do not tell which branches and tags to push to the "git
   push" command in any way, the command used "matching refs" rule to
   update remote branches and tags with branches and tags with the
   same name you locally have.

  See details and more changes in Documentation/RelNotes/1.7.10.txt,
  1.7.10.1.txt, 1.7.10.2.txt and 1.7.10.3.txt.

Mon Feb 27 11:43:15 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 1.7.9.2:
  * Bash completion script (in contrib/) did not like a pattern that
    begins with a dash to be passed to __git_ps1 helper function.
  * Adaptation of the bash completion script (in contrib/) for zsh
    incorrectly listed all subcommands when "git <TAB><TAB>" was given
    to ask for list of porcelain subcommands.
  * The build procedure for profile-directed optimized binary was not
    working very well.
  * Some systems need to explicitly link -lcharset to get locale_charset().
  * t5541 ignored user-supplied port number used for HTTP server testing.
  * The error message emitted when we see an empty loose object was
    not phrased correctly.
  * The code to ask for password did not fall back to the terminal
    input when GIT_ASKPASS is set but does not work (e.g. lack of X
    with GUI askpass helper).
  * We failed to give the true terminal width to any subcommand when
    they are invoked with the pager, i.e. "git -p cmd".
  * map_user() was not rewriting its output correctly, which resulted
    in the user visible symptom that "git blame -e" sometimes showed
    excess '>' at the end of email addresses.
  * "git checkout -b" did not allow switching out of an unborn branch.
  * When you have both .../foo and .../foo.git, "git clone .../foo" did not
    favor the former but the latter.
  * "git commit" refused to create a commit when entries added with
    "add -N" remained in the index, without telling Git what their content
    in the next commit should be. We should have created the commit without
    these paths.
  * "git diff --stat" said "files", "insertions", and "deletions" even
    when it is showing one "file", one "insertion" or one "deletion".
  * The output from "git diff --stat" for two paths that have the same
    amount of changes showed graph bars of different length due to the
    way we handled rounding errors.
  * "git grep" did not pay attention to -diff (hence -binary) attribute.
  * The transport programs (fetch, push, clone)ignored --no-progress
    and showed progress when sending their output to a terminal.
  * Sometimes error status detected by a check in an earlier phase of
    "git receive-pack" (the other end of "git push") was lost by later
    checks, resulting in false indication of success.
  * "git rev-list --verify" sometimes skipped verification depending on
    the phase of the moon, which dates back to 1.7.8.x series.
  * Search box in "gitweb" did not accept non-ASCII characters correctly.
  * Search interface of "gitweb" did not show multiple matches in the same file
    correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  9 10:04:38 CET 2012 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to v1.7.9:
 * gitk updates accumulated since early 2011.

 * git-gui updated to 0.16.0.

 * git-p4 (in contrib/) updates.

 * Git uses gettext to translate its most common interface messages
   into the user's language if translations are available and the
   locale is appropriately set. Distributors can drop new PO files
   in po/ to add new translations.

 * The code to handle username/password for HTTP transactions used in
   "git push" & "git fetch" learned to talk "credential API" to
   external programs to cache or store them, to allow integration with
   platform native keychain mechanisms.

 * The input prompts in the terminal use our own getpass() replacement
   when possible. HTTP transactions used to ask for the username without
   echoing back what was typed, but with this change you will see it as
   you type.

 * The internals of "revert/cherry-pick" have been tweaked to prepare
   building more generic "sequencer" on top of the implementation that
   drives them.

 * "git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD" after "git fetch" without specifying
   what to fetch from the command line will now show the commit that
   would be merged if the command were "git pull".

 * "git add" learned to stream large files directly into a packfile
   instead of writing them into individual loose object files.

 * "git checkout -B <current branch> <elsewhere>" is a more intuitive
   way to spell "git reset --keep <elsewhere>".

 * "git checkout" and "git merge" learned "--no-overwrite-ignore" option
   to tell Git that untracked and ignored files are not expendable.

 * "git commit --amend" learned "--no-edit" option to say that the
   user is amending the tree being recorded, without updating the
   commit log message.

 * "git commit" and "git reset" re-learned the optimization to prime
   the cache-tree information in the index, which makes it faster to
   write a tree object out after the index entries are updated.

 * "git commit" detects and rejects an attempt to stuff NUL byte in
   the commit log message.

 * "git commit" learned "-S" to GPG-sign the commit; this can be shown
   with the "--show-signature" option to "git log".

 * fsck and prune are relatively lengthy operations that still go
   silent while making the end-user wait. They learned to give progress
   output like other slow operations.

 * The set of built-in function-header patterns for various languages
   knows MATLAB.

 * "git log --format='<format>'" learned new %g[nNeE] specifiers to
   show information from the reflog entries when walking the reflog
   (i.e. with "-g").

 * "git pull" can be used to fetch and merge an annotated/signed tag,
   instead of the tip of a topic branch. The GPG signature from the
   signed tag is recorded in the resulting merge commit for later
   auditing.

 * "git log" learned "--show-signature" option to show the signed tag
   that was merged that is embedded in the merge commit. It also can
   show the signature made on the commit with "git commit -S".

 * "git branch --edit-description" can be used to add descriptive text
   to explain what a topic branch is about.

 * "git fmt-merge-msg" learned to take the branch description into
   account when preparing a merge summary that "git merge" records
   when merging a local branch.

 * "git request-pull" has been updated to convey more information
   useful for integrators to decide if a topic is worth merging and
   what is pulled is indeed what the requestor asked to pull,
   including:

   - the tip of the branch being requested to be merged;
   - the branch description describing what the topic is about;
   - the contents of the annotated tag, when requesting to pull a tag.

 * "git pull" learned to notice 'pull.rebase' configuration variable,
   which serves as a global fallback for setting 'branch.<name>.rebase'
   configuration variable per branch.

 * "git tag" learned "--cleanup" option to control how the whitespaces
   and empty lines in tag message are cleaned up.

 * "gitweb" learned to show side-by-side diff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 15:58:06 UTC 2012 - jpschewe@mtu.net

- Added the ability to specify the user and group that git-daemon run
  as (bnc#742661).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 11 12:41:46 UTC 2012 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to v1.7.8.3

  * Attempt to fetch from an empty file pretending it to be a bundle did
   not error out correctly.

  * gitweb did not correctly fall back to configured $fallback_encoding
   that is not 'latin1'.

  * "git clone --depth $n" did not catch a non-number given as $n as an
   error.

  * Porcelain commands like "git reset" did not distinguish deletions
    and type-changes from ordinary modification, and reported them with
    the same 'M' moniker. They now use 'D' (for deletion) and 'T' (for
    type-change) to match "git status -s" and "git diff --name-status".

  * You could make "git commit" segfault by giving the "--no-message"
   option.

  * "git checkout -m" did not recreate the conflicted state in a "both
   sides added, without any common ancestor version" conflict
   situation.

  * git native connection going over TCP (not over SSH) did not set
   SO_KEEPALIVE option which failed to receive link layer errors.

  * "fast-import" did not correctly update an existing notes tree,
   possibly corrupting the fan-out.

  * "git log --follow" did not honor the rename threshold score given
   with the -M option (e.g. "-M50%").

  * Authenticated "git push" over dumb HTTP were broken with a recent
   change and failed without asking for password when username is
   given.

  * "git push" to an empty repository over HTTP were broken with a
   recent change to the ref handling.

  * "git push -v" forgot how to be verbose by mistake. It now properly
   becomes verbose when asked to.

  * When a "reword" action in "git rebase -i" failed to run "commit --amend",
   we did not give the control back to the user to resolve the situation, and
   instead kept the original commit log message.

  * "git apply --check" did not error out when given an empty input
   without any patch.

  * "git archive" mistakenly allowed remote clients to ask for commits
   that are not at the tip of any ref.

  * "git checkout" and "git merge" treated in-tree .gitignore and exclude
   file in $GIT_DIR/info/ directory inconsistently when deciding which
   untracked files are ignored and expendable.

  * The function header pattern for files with "diff=cpp" attribute did
   not consider "type *funcname(type param1,..." as the beginning of a
   function.

  * The error message from "git diff" and "git status" when they fail
   to inspect changes in submodules did not report which submodule they
   had trouble with.

  * "git pack-objects" avoids creating cyclic dependencies among deltas
   when seeing a broken packfile that records the same object in both
   the deflated form and as a delta.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 13 18:11:00 UTC 2011 - idonmez@suse.com

- Implement %check via make test

- Update to v1.7.8

 New features:

 * The date parser now accepts timezone designators that lack minutes
   part and also has a colon between "hh:mm".

 * The contents of the /etc/mailname file, if exists, is used as the
   default value of the hostname part of the committer/author e-mail.

 * "git am" learned how to read from patches generated by Hg.

 * "git archive" talking with a remote repository can report errors
   from the remote side in a more informative way.

 * "git branch" learned an explicit --list option to ask for branches
   listed, optionally with a glob matching pattern to limit its output.

 * "git check-attr" learned "--cached" option to look at .gitattributes
   files from the index, not from the working tree.

 * Variants of "git cherry-pick" and "git revert" that take multiple
   commits learned to "--continue" and "--abort".

 * "git daemon" gives more human readble error messages to clients
   using ERR packets when appropriate.

 * Errors at the network layer is logged by "git daemon".

 * "git diff" learned "--minimal" option to spend extra cycles to come
   up with a minimal patch output.

 * "git diff" learned "--function-context" option to show the whole
   function as context that was affected by a change.

 * "git difftool" can be told to skip launching the tool for a path by
   answering 'n' to its prompt.

 * "git fetch" learned to honor transfer.fsckobjects configuration to
   validate the objects that were received from the other end, just like
   "git receive-pack" (the receiving end of "git push") does.

 * "git fetch" makes sure that the set of objects it received from the
   other end actually completes the history before updating the refs.
   "git receive-pack" (the receiving end of "git push") learned to do the
   same.

 * "git fetch" learned that fetching/cloning from a regular file on the
   filesystem is not necessarily a request to unpack a bundle file; the
   file could be ".git" with "gitdir: <path>" in it.

 * "git for-each-ref" learned "%(contents:subject)", "%(contents:body)"
   and "%(contents:signature)". The last one is useful for signed tags.

 * "git grep" used to incorrectly pay attention to .gitignore files
   scattered in the directory it was working in even when "--no-index"
   option was used. It no longer does this. The "--exclude-standard"
   option needs to be given to explicitly activate the ignore
   mechanism.

 * "git grep" learned "--untracked" option, where given patterns are
    searched in untracked (but not ignored) files as well as tracked
    files in the working tree, so that matches in new but not yet
    added files do not get missed.

 * The recursive merge backend no longer looks for meaningless
   existing merges in submodules unless in the outermost merge.

 * "git log" and friends learned "--children" option.

 * "git ls-remote" learned to respond to "-h"(elp) requests.

 * "mediawiki" remote helper can interact with (surprise!) MediaWiki
   with "git fetch" & "git push".

 * "git merge" learned the "--edit" option to allow users to edit the
   merge commit log message.

 * "git rebase -i" can be told to use special purpose editor suitable
   only for its insn sheet via sequence.editor configuration variable.

 * "git send-email" learned to respond to "-h"(elp) requests.

 * "git send-email" allows the value given to sendemail.aliasfile to begin
   with "~/" to refer to the $HOME directory.

 * "git send-email" forces use of Authen::SASL::Perl to work around
   issues between Authen::SASL::Cyrus and AUTH PLAIN/LOGIN.

 * "git stash" learned "--include-untracked" option to stash away
   untracked/ignored cruft from the working tree.

 * "git submodule clone" does not leak an error message to the UI
   level unnecessarily anymore.

 * "git submodule update" learned to honor "none" as the value for
   submodule.<name>.update to specify that the named submodule should
   not be checked out by default.

 * When populating a new submodule directory with "git submodule init",
   the $GIT_DIR metainformation directory for submodules is created inside
   $GIT_DIR/modules/<name>/ directory of the superproject and referenced
   via the gitfile mechanism. This is to make it possible to switch
   between commits in the superproject that has and does not have the
   submodule in the tree without re-cloning.

 * "gitweb" leaked unescaped control characters from syntax hiliter
   outputs.

 * "gitweb" can be told to give custom string at the end of the HTML
   HEAD element.

 * "gitweb" now has its own manual pages.

 Bugfixes since v1.7.7

 * HTTP transport did not use pushurl correctly, and also did not tell
   what host it is trying to authenticate with when asking for
   credentials.
   (merge deba493 jk/http-auth later to maint).

 * "git blame" was aborted if started from an uncommitted content and
   the path had the textconv filter in effect.
   (merge 8518088 ss/blame-textconv-fake-working-tree later to maint).

 * Adding many refs to the local repository in one go (e.g. "git fetch"
   that fetches many tags) and looking up a ref by name in a repository
   with too many refs were unnecessarily slow.
   (merge 17d68a54d jp/get-ref-dir-unsorted later to maint).

 * Report from "git commit" on untracked files was confused under
   core.ignorecase option.
   (merge 395c7356 jk/name-hash-dirent later to maint).

 * "git merge" did not understand ":/<pattern>" as a way to name a commit.

 " "git push" on the receiving end used to call post-receive and post-update
   hooks for attempted removal of non-existing refs.
   (merge 160b81ed ph/push-to-delete-nothing later to maint).

 * Help text for "git remote set-url" and "git remote set-branches"
   were misspelled.
   (merge c49904e fc/remote-seturl-usage-fix later to maint).
   (merge 656cdf0 jc/remote-setbranches-usage-fix later to maint).

Mon Feb 15 09:31:29 CET 2010 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to version 1.7.0: Major update
  See details in
      http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/RelNotes-1.7.0.txt

  Notes on behaviour change:
  * "git push" into a branch that is currently checked out (i.e. pointed at by
   HEAD in a repository that is not bare) is refused by default.
 * "git send-email" does not make deep threads by default when sending a
   patch series with more than two messages.  All messages will be sent
   as a reply to the first message, i.e. cover letter.
 * "git status" is not "git commit --dry-run" anymore.  This change does
   not affect you if you run the command without argument.
 * "git diff" traditionally treated various "ignore whitespace" options
   only as a way to filter the patch output.  "git diff --exit-code -b"
   exited with non-zero status even if all changes were about changing the
   amount of whitespace and nothing else;  and "git diff -b" showed the
   "diff --git" header line for such a change without patch text.
 * External diff and textconv helpers are now executed using the shell.
   This makes them consistent with other programs executed by git, and
   allows you to pass command-line parameters to the helpers. Any helper
   paths containing spaces or other metacharacters now need to be
   shell-quoted.  The affected helpers are GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF in the
   environment, and diff.*.command and diff.*.textconv in the config
   file.
 * The --max-pack-size argument to 'git repack', 'git pack-objects', and
   'git fast-import' was assuming the provided size to be expressed in MiB,
   unlike the corresponding config variable and other similar options accepting
   a size value.  It is now expecting a size expressed in bytes, with a possible
   unit suffix of 'k', 'm', or 'g'.

- added git-remote-helpers sub-package for python helpers

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- updated to 1.6.3:
  * major version update: git push behavior change,
    With the next major release, "git push" into a branch that is
    currently checked out will be refused by default.  You can
    choose what should happen upon such a push by setting the
    configuration
  * Detailed changelog found at
    http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/RelNotes-1.6.3.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 20 12:44:42 CEST 2009 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to 1.6.2.4:
  * The configuration parser had a buffer overflow while parsing
    an overlong value.
  * pruning reflog entries that are unreachable from the tip of
    the ref during "git reflog prune" (hence "git gc") was very
    inefficient.
  * "git-add -p" lacked a way to say "q"uit to refuse staging any
    hunks for the remaining paths.  You had to say "d" and then ^C.
  * "git-checkout <tree-ish> <submodule>" did not update the index
    entry at the named path; it now does.
  * "git-fast-export" choked when seeing a tag that does not point
    at commit.
  * "git init" segfaulted when given an overlong template location
    via the --template= option.
  * "git-ls-tree" and "git-diff-tree" used a pathspec correctly
    when deciding to descend into a subdirectory but they did not
    match the individual paths correctly.  This caused pathspecs
    "abc/d ab" to match "abc/0" ("abc/d" made them decide to
    descend into the directory "abc/", and then "ab" incorrectly
    matched "abc/0" when it shouldn't).
  * "git-merge-recursive" was broken when a submodule entry was
    involved in a criss-cross merge situation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 16 11:02:04 CEST 2009 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to 1.6.2.2:
  * A longstanding confusing description of what --pickaxe option
    of git-diff does has been clarified in the documentation.
  * "git-blame -S" did not quite work near the commits that were
    given on the command line correctly.
  * "git diff --pickaxe-regexp" did not count overlapping matches
    correctly.
  * "git diff" did not feed files in work-tree representation to
    external diff and textconv.
  * "git-fetch" in a repository that was not cloned from anywhere
    said it cannot find 'origin', which was hard to understand for
    new people.
  * "git-format-patch --numbered-files --stdout" did not have to
    die of incompatible options; it now simply ignores
    --numbered-files as no files are produced anyway.
  * "git-ls-files --deleted" did not work well with GIT_DIR&GIT_WORK_TREE.
  * "git-read-tree A B C..." without -m option has been broken for
    a long time.
  * git-send-email ignored --in-reply-to when --no-thread was given.
  * 'git-submodule add' did not tolerate extra slashes and ./ in
    the path it accepted from the command line; it now is more lenient.
  * git-svn misbehaved when the project contained a path that began
    with two dashes.
  * import-zips script (in contrib) did not compute the common
    directory prefix correctly.
  * miscompilation of negated enum constants by old gcc (2.9)
    affected the codepaths to spawn subprocesses.
- updated to 1.6.2.3:
  * Setting an octal mode value to core.sharedrepository
    configuration to restrict access to the repository to group
    members did not work as advertised.
  * A fairly large and trivial memory leak while rev-list shows
    list of reachable objects has been identified and plugged.
  * "git-commit --interactive" did not abort when underlying
    "git-add -i" signaled a failure.
  * git-repack (invoked from git-gc) did not work as nicely as it
    should in a repository that borrows objects from neighbours
    via alternates mechanism especially when some packs are marked
    with the ".keep" flag to prevent them from being repacked.
- fix the start-check in git-daemon script (bnc#494824)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 16 09:50:24 CET 2009 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to 1.6.2.1:
  * .gitignore learned to handle backslash as a quoting mechanism
    for comment introduction character "#".
  * timestamp output in --date=relative mode used to display
    timestamps that are long time ago in the default mode
  * git-add -i/-p now works with non-ASCII pathnames.
  * "git hash-object -w" did not read from the configuration file
    from the correct .git directory.
  * git-send-email learned to correctly handle multiple Cc:
    addresses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 12:24:45 CET 2009 - tiwai@suse.de

  * "git blame" aligns author names better
  * "git clone" now makes its best effort when cloning from an
    empty repository
  * "git checkout -" is a shorthand for "git checkout @{-1}".
  * "git cherry" defaults to whatever the current branch is
    tracking (if exists) when the <upstream> argument is not given.
  * "git cvsserver" fixes / improvements
  * New options for "git diff"
  * New options for "git filter-branch"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  9 08:27:53 CET 2009 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to 1.6.1.3:
  * "git diff --binary | git apply" pipeline did not work well
   when a binary blob is changed to a symbolic link.
  * some combinations of -b/-w/--ignore-space-at-eol to "git diff"
   did not work as expected.
  * "git grep" did not pass the -I (ignore binary) option when
   calling out an external grep program.
  * "git log" and friends include HEAD to the set of starting
   points when --all is given.  This makes a difference when you
   are not on any branch.
  * "git mv" to move an untracked file to overwrite a tracked
   contents misbehaved.
  * "git merge -s octopus" with many potential merge bases did not
   work correctly.
  * RPM binary package installed the html manpages in a wrong
   place.
  Also includes minor documentation fixes and updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 29 13:24:33 CET 2009 - schwab@suse.de

- Formatting fix for manual pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 29 11:53:19 CET 2009 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to 1.6.1.2:
  * The logic for rename detectin in internal diff used by commands
    like "git diff" and "git blame" have been optimized to avoid
    loading the same blob repeatedly.
  * We did not allow writing out a blob that is larger than 2GB
    for no good reason.
  * "git format-patch -o $dir", when $dir is a relative directory,
    used it as relative to the root of the work tree, not relative
    to the current directory.
  * v1.6.1 introduced an optimization for "git push" into a
    repository (A) that borrows its objects from another
    repository (B) to avoid sending objects that are available in
    repository B, when they are not yet used by repository A.
    However the code on the "git push" sender side was buggy and
    did not work when repository B had new objects that are not
    known by the sender.  This caused pushing into a "forked"
    repository served by v1.6.1 software using "git push" from
    v1.6.1 sometimes did not work.  The bug was purely on the
    "git push" sender side, and has been corrected.
  * "git status -v" did not paint its diff output in colour even
    when color.ui configuration was set.
  * "git ls-tree" learned --full-tree option to help Porcelain
    scripts that want to always see the full path regardless of the
    current working directory.
  * "git grep" incorrectly searched in work tree paths even when
    they are marked as assume-unchanged.  It now searches in the
    index entries.
  * "git gc" with no grace period needlessly ejected packed but
    unreachable objects in their loose form, only to delete them
    right away.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 26 12:21:15 CET 2009 - tiwai@suse.de

- updated to 1.6.1.1:
  * "git add frotz/nitfol" when "frotz" is a submodule should have
    errored out, but it didn't.
  * "git apply" took file modes from the patch text and updated
    the mode bits of the target tree even when the patch was not
    about mode changes.
  * "git bisect view" on Cygwin did not launch gitk
  * "git checkout $tree" did not trigger an error.
  * "git commit" tried to remove COMMIT_EDITMSG from the work tree
    by mistake.
  * "git describe --all" complained when a commit is described
    with a tag, which was nonsense.
  * "git diff --no-index --" did not trigger no-index (aka "use
    git-diff as a replacement of diff on untracked files") behaviour.
  * "git format-patch -1 HEAD" on a root commit failed to produce
    patch text.
  * "git fsck branch" did not work as advertised; instead it
    behaved the same way as "git fsck".
  * "git log --pretty=format:%s" did not handle a multi-line
    subject the same way as built-in log listers (i.e. shortlog,
    --pretty=oneline, etc.)
  * "git daemon", and "git merge-file" are more careful when freopen
    fails and barf, instead of going on and writing to unopened
    filehandle.
  * "git http-push" did not like some RFC 4918 compliant DAV server
    responses.
  * "git merge -s recursive" mistakenly overwritten an untracked
    file in the work tree upon delete/modify conflict.
  * "git merge -s recursive" didn't leave the index unmerged for
    entries with rename/delete conflictd.
  * "git merge -s recursive" clobbered untracked files in the work
    tree.
  * "git mv -k" with more than one errorneous paths misbehaved.
  * "git read-tree -m -u" hence branch switching incorrectly lost
    a subdirectory in rare cases.
  * "git rebase -i" issued an unnecessary error message upon a user
    error of marking the first commit to be "squash"ed.
  * "git shortlog" did not format a commit message with multi-line
    subject correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  8 15:55:42 CET 2009 - tiwai@suse.de

- Update to version 1.5.3.8.
  * Some documentation used "email.com" as an example domain.
  * git-svn fix to handle funky branch and project names going over
    http/https correctly.
  * git-svn fix to tone down a needlessly alarming warning message.
  * git-clone did not correctly report errors while fetching over http.
  * git-send-email added redundant Message-Id: header to the outgoing
    e-mail when the patch text already had one.
  * a read-beyond-end-of-buffer bug in configuration file updater was fixed.
  * git-grep used to show the same hit repeatedly for unmerged paths.
  * After amending the patch title in "git-am -i", the command did not
    report the patch it applied with the updated title.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  8 10:12:16 CET 2008 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- git-cvsserver was unusable, it produced a perl failed-compilation error
   due to missing dependency on perl-DBD-Sqlite.
- update to version 1.5.3.7
 * git-send-email added 8-bit contents to the payload without
   marking it as 8-bit in a CTE header.
 * "git-bundle create a.bndl HEAD" dereferenced the symref and
   did not record the ref as 'HEAD'; this prevented a bundle
   from being used as a normal source of git-clone.
 * The code to reject nonsense command line of the form
   "git-commit -a paths..." and "git-commit --interactive
   paths..." were broken.
 * Adding a signature that is not ASCII-only to an original
   commit that is ASCII-only would make the result non-ASCII.
   "git-format-patch -s" did not mark such a message correctly
   with MIME encoding header.
 * git-add sometimes did not mark the resulting index entry
   stat-clean.  This affected only cases when adding the
   contents with the same length as the previously staged
   contents, and the previous staging made the index entry
   "racily clean".
 * git-commit did not honor GIT_INDEX_FILE the user had in the
   environment.
 * When checking out a revision, git-checkout did not report where the
   updated HEAD is if you happened to have a file called HEAD in the
   work tree.
 * "git-rev-list --objects" mishandled a tree that points at a
   submodule.
 * "git cvsimport" was not ready for packed refs that "git gc" can
   produce and gave incorrect results.
 * Many scripted Porcelains were confused when you happened to have a
   file called "HEAD" in your work tree.

     branches, one of which has "frotz -> xyzzy" symlink and
     file "xyzzy/filfre", while the other one has a file
     "frotz/filfre".
   * "git prune" used to segfault upon seeing a commit that is
     referred to by a tree object (aka "subproject").
   * "git diff --name-status --no-index" mishandled an added file.
   * "git apply --reverse --whitespace=warn" still complained
     about whitespaces that a forward application would have
     introduced.
