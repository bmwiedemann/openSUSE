  <title>Fast, scalable, distributed revision control system</title>
  <description>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and
full access to internals.

This package itself only provides the README of git but with the
packages it requires, it brings you a complete Git environment
including GTK and email interfaces and tools for importing source code
repositories from other revision control systems such as subversion,
CVS, and GNU arch.</description>
