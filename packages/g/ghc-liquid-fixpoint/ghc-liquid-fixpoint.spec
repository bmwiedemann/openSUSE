%description
This package implements an SMTLIB based Horn-Clause/Logical Implication
constraint solver used for Liquid Types.

The package includes:

1. Types for Expressions, Predicates, Constraints, Solutions 2. Code for
solving constraints

Requirements

In addition to the .cabal dependencies you require

* A Z3 (<http://z3.codeplex.com>) or CVC4 (<http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu>) binary.
