%description
Native Haskell TLS and SSL protocol implementation for server and client.

This provides a high-level implementation of a sensitive security protocol,
eliminating a common set of security issues through the use of the advanced
type system, high level constructions and common Haskell features.

Currently implement the SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1, TLS1.2 and TLS 1.3 protocol,
and support RSA and Ephemeral (Elliptic curve and regular) Diffie Hellman key
exchanges, and many extensions.

Some debug tools linked with tls, are available through the
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tls-debug/>.
