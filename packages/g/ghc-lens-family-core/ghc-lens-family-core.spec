%description
This package provides first class(†) functional references in Van Laarhoven
style supporting the following optics:

* Lenses (view, over)

* Traversals (toListOf, matching, over)

* Setters (over)

* Grates (zipWithOf, under, review)

* Resetters (under)

* Adapters (view, review)

* Grids (toListOf, over / under, review)

* Prisms (matching, over / under, review)

* Getters (view)

* Folders (toListOf)

* Reviewers (review)

(†) For optimal first-class support use the 'lens-family' package with rank 2 /
rank N polymorphism. "Lens.Family.Clone" allows for first-class support of
lenses and traversals for those who cannot support rank 2 polymorphism.
