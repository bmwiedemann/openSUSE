  + Ensure the gutter is redrawn when focus leaves text view.
  + Improved support for input methods when X11 and ibus are used
    by making it behave closer to Wayland input methods.

  + Improve resilience of GtkSourceHover assistants to prevent
    unbreakable grabs by application added widgets.

    asynchronous operations to load completion, hover data, etc.
  + Additional Vim commands.

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 18 10:38:39 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.6.0:
  + Updated languages: awk.lang, lean.lang
  + Updated style schemes: Adwaita.xml, Adwaita-dark.xml,
    solarized-light.xml, solarized-dark.xml, cobalt.xml.
  + A bug with input grabs has been fixed when using GtkSourceHover
    to create interactive tooltips in a stack or notebook.
  + highlight-current-line is only rendered when the toplevel is
    active.
  + Merging of snippet bundles handles tooltips now.
  + The snippet manager now delays snippet parsing until needed.
  + Completion of snippets is now lazier resulting in less memory
    and CPU usage.
  + Informative tooltips for snippets are now more aggressively
    dismissed.
  + Scrolling now dismisses interactive hover tooltips.
  + Use of Escape now dismisses the completion list and forwards
    the event to the GtkSourceView, improving integration of Vim
    emulation.
  + Snippet filtering correctness has been improved when
    adding/removing characters from the filter text.
  + Assistants such as the completion list defer repositioning to
    the next frame tick which improves some situations with
    widgetry not having an allocation when snapshotted.
  + A new GtkSourceCompletion::provider-model-changed signal has
    been added which allows observation of providers by external
    tooling. This can be used to implement features like
    "top matches" from various completion providers.
  + Testsuite improvements.
  + GtkSourceView now uses GSignalGroup and GBindingGroup from
    GLib, and therefore bumps our GLib dependency as it would be
    necessary with updated GTK releases anyway.
  + GtkSourceHoverDisplay now specifies a CSS element name for use
    by applications in styling.
  + GtkSourceCompletion now uses PANGO_UNDERLINE_SINGLE_LINE and
    PANGO_WEIGHT_BOLD Pango attributes for highlighting fuzzy
    matches. This improves visibility when used with certain
    character sets.
  + Splicing of Pango attributes has been improved for completion
    which ensures the merging does not result in missing
    attributes.
  + Some methods have been marked as virtual for Vala.
  + Updated translations.
- Add optional pkgconfig(fontconfig) and pkgconfig(pangoft2)
  BuildRequires: build fonconfig support.

  + Performance improvements to GtkSourceBuffer.
  + Performance improvements when translating improperly encoded
    documents to fallback hexadecimal characters.
  + Disable GtkSourceBuffer::cursor-moved signal while loading
    buffers with GtkSourceFileLoader.
  + Adwaita.xml styling fixes for def:error.
  + More profiling integration with sysprof.
  + Updated languages: lean, latex, chdr, cpphdr.

  + The completion popover can now avoid repositioning in a number
    of scenarios.
  + The completion popover now hides before resetting grid content.

    name for new files. GNOME Text Editor has examples for using
    this new opt-in metadata.
  + Various fixes display of snippet assistants.
  + New languages: twig.lang.
  + Updated translations.
- Add explicit pkgconfig(libpcre2-8) BuildRequires as meson checks
  for it, already pulled in by other dependencies.

    solarized-dark.
  + Gutter renderers are now provided a prelight quark for lines
    when the pointer is over the gutter.
  + Hover assistants now avoid synthesized motion which is used
    much more often in GTK 4 when dealing with crossing-events.
  + Hover assistants will now dismiss themselves when the cursor
    moves.
  + GtkSourceMap has reduced how often it needs to do allocation by
    ignoring spurious notify::upper and value-changed signals from
    GtkTextView's vertical GtkAdjustment.
  + The testsuite has gained some correctness improvements.
  + The Vim emulation's register implementation is now shared
    between buffers as it would be expected in Vim.
  + Snippets have gained some robustness improvements including the
    ability to simplify results from the snippet parser, more
    defensive behavior, and being lazier when possible.
  + Tabbing through focus-positions in snippets will now
    immediately jump to the new position if scrolling is required
    instead of animating as it results in better placement of
    tooltip assistants.
  + Assistants including completion, hover, and interactive
    tooltips now reduce how often they request presentation and
    position calculation from GDK and ultimately display servers
    such as Wayland.
  + Completion windows now take the size of the gutter into account
    when calculating their position relative to the parent
    GtkWindow so that the typed-text column remains aligned with
    typed text in the source view.
  + Completion has gained robustness improvements to do less work
    when possible and avoid spinning the frame-clock which could
    happen in certain scenarios.
  + Updated translations.

  + Improved sizing and placement of assistants including hover
    popovers, interactive tooltips, and completion windows.

  + The overview map will now properly update when the sourceview's
    right-margin-position changes.
  + Fixes to vala.lang for regex detection.

    stealing input before ctrl+shift+u could process the unicode
    input.
  + Gutter renderers now more aggresively cache color information
    for drawing highlights and more.

    GtkSource namespace to match the bindings in all other
    languages.
  + A new Vim emulator in the form of GtkSourceVimIMContext. This
    can emulate basic features such as Normal, Insert, Replace,
    Visual, Visual Line, and Command Bar modes. Additionally, many
