    <comment>- Update to version 5.4.2:
  + Updated languages: c.lang, perl.lang.
  + Updated style-schemes: Adwaita-dark, solarized-light,
    solarized-dark.
  + Gutter renderers are now provided a prelight quark for lines
    when the pointer is over the gutter.
  + Hover assistants now avoid synthesized motion which is used
    much more often in GTK 4 when dealing with crossing-events.
  + Hover assistants will now dismiss themselves when the cursor
    moves.
  + GtkSourceMap has reduced how often it needs to do allocation by
    ignoring spurious notify::upper and value-changed signals from
    GtkTextView's vertical GtkAdjustment.
  + The testsuite has gained some correctness improvements.
  + The Vim emulation's register implementation is now shared
    between buffers as it would be expected in Vim.
  + Snippets have gained some robustness improvements including the
    ability to simplify results from the snippet parser, more
    defensive behavior, and being lazier when possible.
  + Tabbing through focus-positions in snippets will now
    immediately jump to the new position if scrolling is required
    instead of animating as it results in better placement of
    tooltip assistants.
  + Assistants including completion, hover, and interactive
    tooltips now reduce how often they request presentation and
    position calculation from GDK and ultimately display servers
    such as Wayland.
  + Completion windows now take the size of the gutter into account
    when calculating their position relative to the parent
    GtkWindow so that the typed-text column remains aligned with
    typed text in the source view.
  + Completion has gained robustness improvements to do less work
    when possible and avoid spinning the frame-clock which could
    happen in certain scenarios.
  + Updated translations. (forwarded request 983489 from iznogood)</comment>
