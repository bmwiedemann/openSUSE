- Updated spec file to conform with ghc-rpm-macros-2.5.2.

Wed Mar 15 09:33:16 UTC 2023 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update some to version 1.0.5.
  # 1.0.5

  - Add EqP and OrdP classes.
    These are strong versions of Eq1 and Ord1, and on the other hand
    weaker versions of `GEq` and `GCompare`.
    They are exactly what's needed for `Eq` and `Ord` instances of `Some`.

    The naming is unfortunate: `GShow` would be better named `ShowP`,
    as it's similar version of `Show1`.

    Note: we could add `ReadP` with `readsPrecP :: Int -> ReadS (t a)` method,
    but it will barely have any instances.
    `GRead` is different, as it can reify the type index for many types,
    e.g. for the singletons.

    In some future there will be major version of `some` with following
    breaking changes:
    - `EqP` and `OrdP` will become superclasses of `GEq` and `GCompare`
    - `Eq (Some t)` will require `EqP t`, similarly for `Ord` and `OrdP`.
    - `GShow` will get `forall a. Show (f a)` superclass. (This will cause removal of `Product` and `Sum` instances for `base <4.18`).

    To ease future transition you may
    - Define `EqP` and `OrdP` instances for your types.
      The `defaultEq` and `defaultCompare` methods can be used to define
      `eqp` and `comparep` from `GEq` and `GCompare` instances respectively.
    - Move to use `GHC.Generics.:*:` and `:+:` instead of `Data.Functor.Product` and `Sum`, as these have better `Eq` and `Ord` instances.
