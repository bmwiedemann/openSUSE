  <title>Compression and decompression in the gzip and zlib formats</title>
  <description>This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing streams of data
represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C library so it has high performance.
It supports the &quot;zlib&quot;, &quot;gzip&quot; and &quot;raw&quot; compression formats.

It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the few cases
where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib feature set.</description>
