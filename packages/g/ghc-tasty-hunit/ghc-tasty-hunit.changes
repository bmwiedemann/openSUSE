- Update tasty-hunit to version 0.10.0.3.
  Version 0.10.0.3
  ----------------

  The only point of this release is to introduce compatibility with GHCs back to 7.0
  (see https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty/pull/287).

  Note, however, that these changes are not merged to the master branch, and the
  future releases will only support the GHC/base versions from the last 5 years,
  as per our usual policy. To test with even older GHCs, you'll have to use this
  particular version of tasty-hunit (or have the constraint solver pick it for you
  when testing with older GHCs).

  The source of this release is in the `support-old-ghcs` branch of the tasty
  repository.
