  dependency free plugins, hence we now pass --disable-asfdemux
  to configure, as that is the last internal plugin we disable.
- Following the above drop pre_checkin.sh,
  gstreamer-plugins-ugly-patch-source.sh and
  gst-plugins-ugly-#version#-patched.tar.xz, we no longer need to
  generate a patched tarball.
- Stop rm'ing no longer present .so files during build.
- Drop libmad-devel BuildRequires: The plugin have been removed by
  upstream (libgstmpg123 is the replacement).
- Drop gstreamer-revert-bogus-automake-version.patch: We no longer
  use the patched tarball.
- Following the above, drop automake and libtool BuildRequires and
  stop passing autogen.sh to configure.
- Add define ENABLE_MPG123  and conditional pkgconfig(mpg123)
  BuildRequires, currently set to disabled (0). Build mp3 support
  now that patents are expired. Using define so we can quickly
  enable it, should the dependency be available in TW.
- Apply gstreamer-plugins-ugly-CVE-2017-5847.patch always, as we
  now use a different mode of disabling asfmuxer.
