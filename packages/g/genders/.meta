  <title>Static cluster configuration database</title>
  <description>
  Genders is a static cluster configuration database used for cluster
  configuration management.  It is used by a variety of tools and
  scripts for management of large clusters.  The genders database is
  typically replicated on every node of the cluster. It describes the
  layout and configuration of the cluster so that tools and scripts can
  sense the variations of cluster nodes. By abstracting this information
  into a plain text file, it becomes possible to change the
  configuration of a cluster by modifying only one file.
