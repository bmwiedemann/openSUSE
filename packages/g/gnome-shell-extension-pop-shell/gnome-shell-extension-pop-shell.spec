%description
Pop Shell is a keyboard-driven layer for GNOME Shell which allows for quick and
sensible navigation and management of windows. The core feature of Pop Shell is
the addition of advanced tiling window management — a feature that has been
highly-sought within our community. For many — ourselves included — i3wm has
become the leading competitor to the GNOME desktop.

Tiling window management in GNOME is virtually nonexistent, which makes the
desktop awkward to interact with when your needs exceed that of two windows at
a given time. Luckily, GNOME Shell is an extensible desktop with the
foundations that make it possible to implement a tiling window manager on top
of the desktop.

Therefore, we see an opportunity here to advance the usability of the GNOME
desktop to better accomodate the needs of our community with Pop Shell.
Advanced tiling window management is a must for the desktop, so we've merged
i3-like tiling window management with the GNOME desktop for the best of both
worlds.
