%description
This library implements 'i;unicode-casemap', the simple, non locale-sensitive
unicode collation algorithm described in RFC 5051
(<http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5051.txt>). Proper unicode collation can be
done using text-icu, but that is a big dependency that depends on a large C
library, and rfc5051 might be better for some purposes.

Here is a list of strings sorted by the Prelude's 'sort' function:

Abe Oeb abe ab&#233; oeb &#193;be &#196;be &#212;eb &#225;be &#228;be &#244;eb.

Here is the same list sorted by 'sortBy compareUnicode':

Abe abe ab&#233; &#193;be &#225;be &#196;be &#228;be Oeb oeb &#212;eb &#244;eb.
