- Update to release 2.2
  * Allow for successful synchronization when logged in via altname
    (turning it into email address internally)
  * TimeZoneStruct wDayOfWeek and wDay were erroneously switched
    whan calculating DST start and end, which has been fixed.
  * Adjust all day events to midnight only if a TZ definition was
    saved with the message. The server timezone should not be
    applied in this case, because if no TZ is there,
    starttime/endtime of an event should be midnight already.
  * Apply server TZ to allday appointments with non GMT start times.
