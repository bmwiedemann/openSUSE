%description
An API for efficient and convenient construction of vectors. It provides the
composable `Builder` abstraction, which has instances of the `Monoid` and
`Semigroup` classes.

[Usage]

First you use the `Builder` abstraction to specify the structure of the vector.
Then you execute the builder to actually produce the vector.

[Example]

The following code shows how you can efficiently concatenate different
datastructures into a single immutable vector:

> >import qualified Data.Vector as A >import qualified VectorBuilder.Builder as
B >import qualified VectorBuilder.Vector as C > > >myVector :: A.Vector a ->
[a] -> a -> A.Vector a >myVector vector list element = > C.build builder >
where > builder = > B.vector vector <> > B.foldable list <> > B.singleton
element.
