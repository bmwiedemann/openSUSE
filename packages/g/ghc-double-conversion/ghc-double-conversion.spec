%description
A library that performs fast, accurate conversion between double precision
floating point and text.

This library is implemented as bindings to the C++ 'double-conversion' library
written by Florian Loitsch at Google:
<https://github.com/floitsch/double-conversion>.

The 'Text' versions of these functions are about 30 times faster than the
default 'show' implementation for the 'Double' type.

The 'ByteString' versions are /slower/ than the 'Text' versions; roughly half
the speed. (This seems to be due to the cost of allocating 'ByteString' values
via 'malloc'.)

As a final note, be aware that the 'bytestring-show' package is about 50%
slower than simply using 'show'.
