- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:
  + %desktop_database_post/postun because the package ships at
    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.
  + %mime_database_post/postun because the package ships a mime
    type definition.
- Remove shared-mime-info Requires: if it's not there, then we
  simply don't need to update the mime database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  2 12:41:15 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Improve summary.

  gcstar-fix-desktop.patch to fix the desktop file the way we want.
- Manually install gcstar icon to hicolor, and also install it as
  the icon for the application/x-gcstar mime type. This means we
  don't need to call xdg-icon-resource in %post (which is bad since
  it creates files).
- Use update-mime-database in %post and %postun. This means we
  don't need to call xdg-mime in %post.
- Add shared-mime-info Requires(post) and Requires(postun).
- Remove xdg-utils BuildRequires and Requires(post).
- Add calls to %icon_theme_cache_post and %icon_theme_cache_postun.
