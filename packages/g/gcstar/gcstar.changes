Wed Jun  7 20:49:20 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  + Release based on Gtk3 as the default version.
  + Many new features were introduce for the users.
  + New collections: Postcards, Gadgets and MusicCourses.
  + New plugins: Bdphile (Comics), Numista and Exonumia (Coins, FR
    and EN), AnimatorEN (Films), Amazon (Gadgets), AmazonBR
    (Books), UPCitemDB (Gagdets) and Alfred (MusicCources).
  + Plugins evolutions: JeuxVideo (Games), DVDPost (Films), IMDB
    (Films), BoardGameGeek (BoardGames), BDphile (Books), MobyGames
    (Games), Amazon (Books, Films, Games), MangaSanctuary (Comics),
    Numista, Noosfere, Discogs and Brikset.
  + Plugins unavailable because of one thing, or another: Douban
    (Films), TheLegacy (VideoGames), ComicBookDb (Comics),
    ReservoirJeux (BoardGames) and FNAC (FR).
  + Bugs fixed:
    - Errors when GCstar is used in minimum configuration (no
      optional dependencies).
    - Change dependency for Liberation font.
    - Small bugs fixes in models XML/GCM and XSD (revision 5).
    - Update XSD link in GCM models.
    - Missing name for "file size unit" field (problem in
      import/export).
    - Missing images in CSV imports.
    - Support of double or multiple lists in CSV imports (actors
      for example).
    - Default min and max values for numbers.
    - Bugs in image and text lists: sorting, columns, selections.
    - Problem in titles with articles for some languages.
    - Fix duration for extracted music.
    - Inconsistencies in images list view.
    - Remember windows size when GCstar closes.

- Replace Kerenoc/GCstar gitlab.com repo Source tag with
  GCstar/GCstar.
- Update GPL-2.0-only License tag to GPL-2.0-or-later as stated in
  the GitLab repository, as well as in and the source code comment
  headers.
- Update https://wiki.gcstar.org/en URL to https://www.gcstar.org/,
  the GCstar's home page.
- Switch typelib-1_0-GdkPixdata-2_0 and typelib-1_0-Gtk-3_0 to
  their more maintainer friendly typelib(BindingName) [= Version]
  symbol notation, being typelib(GdkPixdata) = 2.0 and typelib(Gtk)
  = 3.0, respectively.
- Switch %setup macro to the wonderfull %autosetup, leveraging its
  automation capabilities.
- Drop downstream gcstar-fix-desktop.patch patch. It's no longer
  necessary, since the wanted modifications can be done with the
  help of %suse_update_desktop_file macro.
- Drop no longer needed BuildRequires on shared-mime-info. It was
  needed for updating the MIME cache, functionality that has been
  moved to the shared-mime-info package via RPM filetriggers.
- Update package dependecies, according to the installer
  instructions:
  + Demote perl(DateTime::Format::Strptime) and perl(JSON) from
    BuildRequires/Requires to Recommends. They're not mandatory,
    but optional.
  + Replace perl(GD) Recommends with perl(GD::Graph::area),
    perl(GD::Graph::bars) and perl(GD::Graph::pie).
  + Add explicit BuildRequires for the following Perl modules (they
    were already being pulled): Cwd, Cwd, Cwd, Data::Dumper,
    Digest::MD5, Encode, Encode::Locale, Exporter, File::Basename,
    File::Copy, File::Find, File::Path, File::Path, File::Spec,

    POSIX, POSIX, Storable, Text::Wrap, URI::Escape,
    Unicode::Normalize, XML::Parser, filetest, threads and
    threads::shared.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 12 17:21:09 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:
  + %desktop_database_post/postun because the package ships at
    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.
  + %mime_database_post/postun because the package ships a mime
    type definition.
- Remove shared-mime-info Requires: if it's not there, then we
  simply don't need to update the mime database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  2 12:41:15 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Improve summary.

  gcstar-fix-desktop.patch to fix the desktop file the way we want.
- Manually install gcstar icon to hicolor, and also install it as
  the icon for the application/x-gcstar mime type. This means we
  don't need to call xdg-icon-resource in %post (which is bad since
  it creates files).
- Use update-mime-database in %post and %postun. This means we
  don't need to call xdg-mime in %post.
- Add shared-mime-info Requires(post) and Requires(postun).
- Remove xdg-utils BuildRequires and Requires(post).
- Add calls to %icon_theme_cache_post and %icon_theme_cache_postun.
