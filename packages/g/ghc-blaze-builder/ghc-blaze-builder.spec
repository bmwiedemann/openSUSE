%description
This library provides an implementation of the older blaze-builder interface in
terms of the new builder that shipped with bytestring-0.10.4.0

This implementation is mostly intended as a bridge to the new builder, so that
code that uses the old interface can interoperate with code that uses the new
implementation. Note that no attempt has been made to preserve the old internal
modules, so code that has these dependencies cannot use this interface.

New code should, for the most part, use the new interface. However, this module
does implement a chunked HTTP encoding, which is not otherwise implemented
(yet?) with the new builder.
