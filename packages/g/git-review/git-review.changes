Mon Jan 13 13:25:39 UTC 2025 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Drop test dependencies when the tests are not run

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 24 13:27:16 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

Mon May 22 10:16:17 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Clean up the SPEC file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 24 09:01:38 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.3.1:
  * Improved version string parsing for Git

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 19 05:41:47 UTC 2022 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.3.0:
  * Python 3.5 is no longer supported.
  * Git 2.10.0 or later is required as git-review now needs the
    --no-show-signature option for git-log.
  * Git’s log.ShowSignature option is now supported. Previously, setting it
    would confuse git-review into thinking there were twice as many changes
    to push.
  * OpenSSH has deprecated its use of scp/rcp protocol in favor of SFTP,
    which the embedded Apache mina-sshd in widely-deployed Gerrit versions
    does not yet support. Now git-review will attempt to detect whether
    scp’s -O option is available to force use of the legacy scp/rcp protocol,
    and apply it if so. Future git-review versions may change the fallback
    behavior once an SFTP subsystem is implemented and available for a new
    Gerrit release.
- Remove now unneeded BuildRequires on mock.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  7 21:06:05 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 2.2.0:
  - When checking for unstaged or uncommitted changes to avoid
    performing a test rebase, unstaged and uncommitted changes in
    Git submodules are now ignored since those won’t be rebased
    anyway.
  - git-review now handles the Git core.hooksPath configuration
    option correctly. Thus, it installs the commit-msg hook
    into the core.hooksPath directory, if that option is
    set. Otherwise, it continues to install the hook into
    .git/hooks, relative to the root of the checkout.
  - With Git 2.18.0 and later, the --rebase-merges (-r) option
    will be used in place of the deprecated --preserve-merges
    (-p) option. This fixes a critical error when git-review is
    used with Git versions 2.34.0 onward, where the old option is
    no longer available.
- Remove unnecessary
  7182166ec00ad3645821435d72c5424b4629165f.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  5 10:29:09 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.0:
  * Add support for –no-thin which is passed to git push
  * A new gitreview.branchauthor option allows configuring the change author
    (owner) name part of the autocreated branch name when downloading changes.
  * A new gitreview.notopic configuration setting makes git-review always
    behave as if the --notopic command line option was supplied.
  * Added the --notify option, which can be used to ensure specified receivers
    receives email notifications
  * The Change-Id generating commit hook is now installed into any detected Git
    submodules, so that it will take effect when creating changes within a
    submodule and not just in the parent repository.
  * Encoding was corrected for Git credentials, which was previously causing HTTP
    authentication to fail under some Python 3 versions.
  * Change download functions now preserve any unapplied local edits on the
    branch when attempting to reset the worktree.
  * The --no-follow-tags option to git push is now used for all pushes, so that
    git-review won’t error when encountering a local tag which is absent from
    Gerrit.
  * For safety, attempts to push a commit with unstaged or uncommitted changes in
    the worktree will be caught and an error reported, rather than leaving it up to
    git rebase to spot them. This addresses a situation where users enabling
    rebase.autostash would otherwise experience data loss when the test rebase is
    subsequently reset.
- add 7182166ec00ad3645821435d72c5424b4629165f.patch:
  * With Git 2.18.0 and later, the --rebase-merges (-r) option will be used in
    place of the deprecated --preserve-merges (-p) option. This fixes a
    critical error when git-review is used with Git versions 2.34.0 onward,
    where the old option is no longer available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 18:08:45 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- revert switch to singlespec. This is an insane complexification
  for no gain: git-review is a pure cli tool, not a module
  to import, and we never had a working python2- version anyway
  because all the tooling was excluded from packaging. So
  don't create packages that are unusable and deprecated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 17:54:51 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.28.0 (bsc#1134089):
  * Support for auto-configuration of topic names based on the
  presence of keywords in the commit message is removed. Previously,
  keywords such as bug, bp or lp followed by a number would result
  in branch names containing the associated number, e.g. bug/123.
  This feature was OpenStack specific, was a frequent source of bugs
  and clearly wasn’t being used that often, given that StoryBoard
  is a thing now and no one had updated this feature to handle that metadata.

  * Fixed usepushurl to work when a read-only mirror being used as origin does not contain refs/changes from gerrit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  8 10:01:57 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>
