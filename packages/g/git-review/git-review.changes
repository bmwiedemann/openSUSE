Fri May  3 18:08:45 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- revert switch to singlespec. This is an insane complexification
  for no gain: git-review is a pure cli tool, not a module
  to import, and we never had a working python2- version anyway
  because all the tooling was excluded from packaging. So
  don't create packages that are unusable and deprecated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 17:54:51 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.28.0 (bsc#1134089):
  * Support for auto-configuration of topic names based on the
  presence of keywords in the commit message is removed. Previously,
  keywords such as bug, bp or lp followed by a number would result
  in branch names containing the associated number, e.g. bug/123.
  This feature was OpenStack specific, was a frequent source of bugs
  and clearly wasn’t being used that often, given that StoryBoard
  is a thing now and no one had updated this feature to handle that metadata.

  * Fixed usepushurl to work when a read-only mirror being used as origin does not contain refs/changes from gerrit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
