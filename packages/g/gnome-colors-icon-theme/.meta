  <title>A complete, multi-colored suite of icons for Linux</title>
  <description>The GNOME-Colors is a project that aims to make the GNOME desktop as
elegant, consistent and colorful as possible.

The current goal is to allow full color customization of themes, icons,
GDM logins and splash screens. There are already five full
color-schemes available; Brave (Blue), Human (Orange), Wine (Red),
Noble (Purple) and Wise (Green).

GNOME-Colors is mostly inspired/based on Tango, GNOME, Elementary,
Tango-Generator and many other open-source projects.</description>
