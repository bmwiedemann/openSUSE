- Update hslua-aeson to version 2.3.1.
  ## hslua-aeson-2.3.1

  Released 2024-01-18.

  -   Relaxed upper bound for aeson. This required changes to the
      testsuite: The arbitrary JSON values produced by current aeson
      versions include numbers that cannot be converted to Lua
      numbers without loss of precision. Those are first converted
      to representable numbers before round-tripping is tested.

  -   Relaxed upper bound for text, containers, and bytestring,
      allowing text-2.1, containers-0.7, and bytestring-0.12.

- Update hslua-aeson to version 2.3.0.1.
  ## hslua-aeson-2.3.0.1

  Released 2023-03-13.

  -   Relax upper bound for hslua-marshalling, allow version 2.3.

  ## hslua-aeson-2.3.0

  Released 2023-02-21.

  -   The `peekValue` peeker now checks for a `__toaeson` metafield
      or `__tojson` metamethod and uses them to compute the `Value`
      of an object:

      The `__toaeson` metafield, if set, must be a function pushed
      via `pushToAeson`. That function is called on a given object,
      and the returned *Value* becomes the result of calling
      `peekValue`.

      Likewise, the `__tojson` metamethod must be a function that
      returns a valid JSON string. The result in that case is the
      decoded string.

      If both, `__toaeson` and `__tojson` are set, then `__toaeson`
      takes precedent.

  -   The test suite now has *tasty-hunit* as an additional
      dependency.

- Update hslua-aeson to version 2.2.1.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:
