%description
The [YAML 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) format provides a much
richer data-model and feature-set than the [JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) format. However, sometimes it's
desirable to ignore the extra capabilities and treat YAML as if it was merely a
more convenient markup format for humans to write JSON data. To this end this
module provides a compatibility layer atop
[HsYAML](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HsYAML) which allows decoding YAML
documents in the more limited JSON data-model while also providing convenience
by reusing [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson)'s 'FromJSON'
instances for decoding the YAML data into native Haskell data types.
