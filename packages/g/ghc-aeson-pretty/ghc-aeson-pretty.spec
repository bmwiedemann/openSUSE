%description
A JSON pretty-printing library compatible with aeson as well as a command-line
tool to improve readabilty of streams of JSON data.

The /library/ provides the function "encodePretty". It is a drop-in replacement
for aeson's "encode" function, producing JSON-ByteStrings for human readers.

The /command-line tool/ reads JSON from stdin and writes prettified JSON to
stdout. It also offers a complementary "compact"-mode, essentially the opposite
of pretty-printing. If you specify '-flib-only' like this

> cabal install -flib-only aeson-pretty

the command-line tool will NOT be installed.
