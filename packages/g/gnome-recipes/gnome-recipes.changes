- Add gnome-recipes-nb-translations.patch: Update Norwegian Bokmål
  translations.

  autoar=yes, gspell=yes and canberra=yes to meson, ensure we build

Sun Nov 12 02:39:46 UTC 2017 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 2.0.2:
  + Fixes:
    - A serious bug in version 2.0.0, which could cause all
      ingredients to lose their amounts when editing a recipe.
    - An issue where ingredients without amount would always get
      displayed with an errant '1' as amount.
  + Allow recipes to have long names.
  + New recipes: Tzatziki, Soy Chicken, Rice Maize Apple Cake.
  + Updated translations.
- Replace pkgconfig(gio-2.0) with glib2-devel BuildRequires:
  pkgconfig(*) glib-2.0 and gmodule-export-2.0 are native
  dependencies, but glib-2.0 is not listed in meson.build as
  dependency and gmodule-export-2.0 is but not used. And since 
  gio-2.0, gio-unix-2.0, gmodule-2.0 and gobject-2.0 are being used
  but not listed in meson.build is better to use glib2-devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    displayed. We are also formatting numbers in a human-friendly
    way and separate them into multiple units where appropriate.
  + Support for sharing shopping lists to the Todoist mobile app.
  + Updated translations.
