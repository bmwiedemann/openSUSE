  <title>Implementation of the UPnP specification</title>
  <description>GUPnP implements the UPnP specification: resource announcement and
discovery, description, control, event notification, and presentation
(GUPnP includes basic web server functionality through libsoup). GUPnP
does not include helpers for construction or control of specific
standardized resources (e.g. MediaServer); this is left for higher level
libraries utilizing the GUPnP framework.</description>
