  <title>Miracast implementation for GNOME</title>
  <description>This is an experimental implementation of Wi-Fi Display (aka Miracast).
The application will stream the selected monitor if the mutter screencast
portal is available. If it is unavailable, a fallback to X11 based frame
grabbing will happen. As such, it should work fine in almost all setups.
To get audio streaming, you need to change the audio output in pulseaudio
to use the created &quot;Network-Displays&quot; sink.
To use it, you will need:
  * openh264 or x264
  * For audio supporting using AAC one of fdkaacenc, faac or avenc_aac
  * NetworkManager version &gt; 1.15.2</description>
