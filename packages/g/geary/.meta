  <title>A lightweight email reader for the GNOME desktop</title>
  <description>In 2011 Yorba broke ground on a new email application for the GNOME desktop. Codenamed Geary, Yorba plans to bring to the open source community a new lightweight, easy-to-use, feature-rich email client. Our long-term vision for Geary is an email client built for daily use that can be used in place of or alongside Web-based email services. Features we're planning include: 

Full IMAP support, making email synchronization a breeze 
Tight integration with popular Web mail services, including Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and Mobile Me 
Full-featured WYSIWYG editor for composing emails 
Threaded / conversation views 
Lightning fast as-you-type email search 
Desktop notification of new email 
Support for multiple email accounts 
Offline mode 
Full support for popular IMAP servers, including Dovecot
