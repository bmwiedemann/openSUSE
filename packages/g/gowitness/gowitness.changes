    primarily avoiding excessive allocations.
  * Also enable error logs when the debug flag is enabled.

    logs in writers.

    default chromedp driver.
  * Don't create empty SQLite3 databases when not required.

    the database (using the --write-screenshot flag).

    use the left and right arrows to quickly flick between results.

  * (ui) Tweak HTML copy modal in report server.
  * (ui) Remove duplicate close icon.
  * (ui) Screenshot modals in the detail view now show the URL and
    timestamp taken.
  Fixed
  * Use correct command options structure for report generate.

    name, makes parsing as described #242 possible again too.

Sun Sep 22 17:56:20 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 3.0.3
  New
  * Add the delay option to the /submit and /submit/single API
    endpoints. This adds a delay between when the page is
    considered loading and when a screenshot should be taken.
    The command line already adds a delay, but this adds it to
    the API as well (see Swagger docs).
  * Add new web UI for probing using immediate mode. Immediate 
    mode does not record data to the database but instead shows
    a modal with the results.
  Fixes
  * Fix API documentation for /submit/single to show the full
    return object.
  * Trim spaces for file targets to help improve reliability of
    the reader.

Tue Sep 17 17:57:48 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 3.0.0
  * Reworked the CLI. Commands are now properly categorised into
    subcommands. Flags also properly inherit from their parents now.
  * Refactored the scanning and screenshotting logic. Most notably,
    the old preflight logic is removed. It was nice and fast, but
    when it mattered, it was a huge pain to deal with and came at
    the cost of result accuracy. Instead, in v3, results are now
    grabbed from network events like Network.responseReceived.
  * Introduced the concept of "drivers," where chromedp was the
    original (and still default) driver. However, rod is also a
    driver option now that you can choose using a command-line flag.
  * Significantly improved and fixed code quality,
    concurrency-related issues, and general screenshot reliability.
  * Rewrote the report web server frontend in React. It just looks
    so much better, has significantly more features, and is easier
    to change now.
  * Added an official API, complete with code-generated Swagger
    documentation!
  * Introduced the concept of "writers," which can be used
    simultaneously. For example, you could write results to an
    SQLite database, JSON Lines, and stdout all at the same time.
  * Fixed perception hashing to use Hamming Distance for grouping.
- Drop subpackage for bash_completion
  * not supported on version 3.0.0
