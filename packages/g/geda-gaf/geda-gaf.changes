- Updated to release 1.10.0
- General changes
  * Added the library "xornstorage" and the Python package "gaf" as a
    (currently quite minimal) way to access gEDA/gaf functionality from
    outside of gschem.  These are on the long term intended to replace
    libgeda, making the core gEDA/gaf functionality available as a
    library to both gschem and other applications.
  * Added command-line tool `xorn' for low-level schematic and symbol
    file manipulation.
  * The symbol directories "gnetman", "verilog", and "vhdl" are now
    installed to the new location PREFIX/share/gEDA/extra-sym/.  This
    allows adding the default library with "component-library-search".
  * The directory to which gEDA programs write log transcripts can be
    changed by setting the environment variable `GEDALOG' (the default
    being ~/.gEDA/logs/).
  * Numerous ixed bugs.
- gschem changes
  * Tool windows are now "dockable", i.e., they can be either used as
    modal/non-modal dialogs or docked to the edges of the main window.
  * The action mechanism used for menu items, tool buttons, and key
    bindings has been redesigned.
  * The menus, toolbar, and keymap have been revamped to more closely
    resemble the "standards" for a desktop application.  Some actions
    have been assigned more accessible or memorable keys.
  * Attaching and detaching attributes now work as expected:
  * Fixed "Lock Component" and "Unlock Component"
  * Added new  color schemes
  * Symbol editing has been improved:
  * Added support for back-annotation from pcb-rnd.
  * Double-clicking a subschematic component enters the subschematic.
  * Right-clicking in path mode works as expected.
  * Pins are allowed to have zero length.
  * "File / Revert" only asks for confirmation if the file has been
    modified.
  * The "repeat" function of the middle mouse button now evaluates
    actions at the current mouse position.
  * Mouse gestures work properly again.
  * Added new mouse gestures for page navigation:
    - swiping left goes to the previous, swiping right to the next page
    - swiping right and then down enters a subschmatic
    - swiping left and then down enters a symbol
    - swiping up and sideways (in any combination) goes back to the
      parent schematic
  * The coordinate dialog has been replaced with an option to display
    the coordinates in the status bar.
  * Added further menu items:
    - "Add / Last Component" (A C)
    - "Object / Toggle Text Overbar" (T O)
    - "View / Show Menubar" (V M)
    - "View / Show Toolbar" (V T)
    - "View / Show Scrollbars" (V S)
    - "Tools / Select Locked Objects" (T L)
  * Fixed various issues related to undo/redo:
- gnetlist changes
  * Refactored gnetlist:
    - Netlist backends can also be written in Python.
    - When reading broken schematics and/or symbols, gnetlist doesn't
      silently fail or produce bad output any more.
    - In case there should be any problems with the refactored codebase,
      the "old" gnetlist is still available as "gnetlist-legacy".
  * There are new semantics for power and I/O port symbols.
  * Hierarchical schematics can now use a simple form of parametrization
    where the instantiating component contains an attribute of the form
    `param=NAME=VALUE' and some attribute value in the subschematic
    contains the pattern `$(NAME)', which will be replaced with `VALUE'.
  * Duplicate I/O ports in subschematics and duplicate I/O pins in
    subschematic symbols are now treated correctly.
  * Added a netlist backend for pcb-rnd's tEDAx format.
  * Added backends which dump the netlist in various generic formats.
