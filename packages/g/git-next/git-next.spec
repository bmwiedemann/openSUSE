%description
Trunk-based developement manager.

git-next is a combined server and command-line tool that enables trunk-based
development workflows where each commit must pass CI before being included in
the main branch.

"A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a
single branch called ‘trunk’, resist any pressure to create other long-lived
development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid
merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after."
(https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)

Features

* Allows enforcing the requirement for each commit to pass the CI pipeline
  before being included in the main branch
* Provides a server component that manages the trunk-based development process
* Ensure a consistent, high-quality codebase by preventing untested changes
  from being added to main
* Requires each commit uses conventional commit format.
