  <title>GUI for rsync</title>
  <description>Grsync is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for rsync, the commandline directory
and file synchronization tool. It can be effectively used to synchronize local
directories and it supports remote targets as well (even though it doesn't
support browsing the remote folder). Sample uses of grsync include: synchronize
a music collection with removable devices, backup personal files to a networked
drive, replication of a partition to another one, mirroring of files, etc.
