- Drop gst-plugins-good-buildfix.patch: fixed upstream.
- Drop libtool BuildRequires and call to autogen.sh, that were only
  needed for above patch.
- Completely drop optional packaging for hal plugin, since it's
  gone:
  + Remove build_hal macro.
  + Remove optional hal-devel BuildRequires.
  + Remove gstreamer-plugin-hal subpackage.
- Add explicit glib2-devel and gstreamer-devel BuildRequires so
  they can be versioned.
- Move to pkgconfig()-style BuildRequires:
  + Old ones: cairo-devel, flac-devel, libcaca-devel, libdv-devel,
    libiec61883-devel, libjack-devel, libpulse-devel,
    libshout-devel, libsoup-devel, libtag-devel, libv4l-devel,
    speex-devel, wavpack-devel.

    libiec61883, libpulse, libsoup-gnome-2.4, libv4l2, shout,

- Add explicit BuildRequires needed by plugins: libICE-devel,
  libSM-devel, libXv-devel, libbz2-devel, zlib-devel.
- Add explicit pkgconfig() BuildRequires needed by plugins:
  gdk-pixbuf-2.0, gudev-1.0, libpng, libraw1394, libxml-2.0,
  xdamage, xfixes.

  is needed, not the development files.
- Remove now unneeded BuildRequires: esound-devel, ftgl-devel,
  gconf2-devel, ladspa-devel, libtheora-devel, libvorbis-devel.
  Those were used by plugins that were moved to plugins-base, or
  removed.
- Remove BuildRequires that, as far as I can tell, are not needed
  (else, they are implicitly brought in by something else):
  check-devel, python-xml, sgml-skel.
- Move to use GTK+ 3 for the build:
  + Replace gtk2-devel BuildRequires with pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) and
    pkgconfig(gtk+-x11-3.0).
  + Pass --with-gtk=3.0 to configure.
- Remove Provides/Obsoletes/Conflicts for gstreamer010-* packages
  in doc and extra subpackages.

- Drop gstreamer-0_10-plugins-good-fix-tag-list-handling-issue.patch:
  fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  9 11:41:21 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Move plugins from extra subpackage to main subpackage:
  libgstgdkpixbuf, libgstmonoscope, libgstsmpte, libgstspeex,
  libgstvideobox. This only adds dependencies on gdk-pixbuf and
  speex to the main subpackage, which is reasonable.
- Move plugins from main subpackage to extra subpackage:
  libgstcacasink. We don't want to depend on the caca library by
  default.
- Remove wrongs Provides from extra subpackage:
  gst-plugins-good:%{_libdir}/gstreamer-%{gst_branch}/libgstvideo4linux2.so
  This is wrong because the plugin is in the main subpackage.

      a seek

      buffering, rtp timestamps
    - matroskademux: seeking/segment fixes (esp. regression with
      gnonlin)

    - pulsesink: avoid segfault when shutting down
    - pulsesink: return previous mute state if sink is not active
      at the moment

      more accurate NTP timestamps if the system clock is
      synchronised with NTP or similar
    - rtpmp4gdepay: avoid division by 0 in corner case
    - v4l2sink: change rank to NONE so we don't try to autoplug it
