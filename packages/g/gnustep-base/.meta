  <title>GNUstep Base library package</title>
  <description>The GNUstep Base Library is a powerful fast library of general-
purpose, non-graphical Objective C classes, inspired by the superb
OpenStep API but implementing Apple and GNU additions to the API
as well.  It includes, for example, classes for unicode strings,
arrays, dictionaries, sets, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, scanners, tasks, files,
networking, threading, remote object messaging support (distributed
objects), event loops, loadable bundles, attributed unicode strings,
xml, mime, user defaults. This package includes development headers
too. It was configured for the FHS file system layout, customised
for SUSE.
