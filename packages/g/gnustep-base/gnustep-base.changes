- Update to version 1.28.0
   * Reading and setting File Creation Date attribute on Windows.
   * Added new 'ASSIGNMUTABLECOPY()' macro for consistency with
     'ASSIGNCOPY()'.
   * Replaced character set data headers for URLs with loading these
     from a standard data source, and updated bitmap representation to
     use much less space for character sets residing wholly in the base
     plane, such as the URL charsets (given they are purely ASCII).
   * Updated character set data with newer Unicode data set.
   * '[NSURLProtocol -initWithRequest:cachedResponse:client:]' will now
     retain the client up until the last message is sent to it, which
     improves compatibility with OS X.
   * Percent-escaping code in 'NSURL' simplified.
   * Removed mixed ABI support.
   * Use of Apple runtime now assumes non-fragile ABI (which is true on
     modern systems).
   * Improve typing on method implementation pointers in some classes.
   * In 'NSHTTPCookie', rewritten code for extracting individual cookies
     from the HTTP header.
   * In 'NSKeyedArchiver', implement secure coding methods.
   * New methods in 'NSDateComponents'.
   * Improvements in 'NSCalendar' and 'NSLocale' for calendar locale and
     'NSDateComponents'.
   * In 'NSFileManager', use 'utimensat()' to set file modification
     date, if available.
   * Correctly stop parsing number being decoded in
     'NSJSONSerialization' when encountering a number with an invalid
     exponent.
   * Improve OS X compatibility for 'NSURLQueryItem' initializers.
   * For 'NSFileManager', in 'changeFileAttributes', implement setting
     creation date for Unix-like systems.  Implement reading the
     creation date if a supported method was detected.
   * Support reading Android assets from the main bundle in
     'NSInputStream'.
   * Support Android assets directories in 'NSBundle' and
     'NSFileManager'.
   * Implement '-[NSXMLParser initWithStream:]'.
   * Allow clearer choice between 'sloppy' 'GSSloppyXMLParser' used in
     'NSXMLParser' and the libxml2-based 'GSStrictXMLParser'.
   * Fix building Win32 implementations for 'GSFileHandle' and
     'NSMessagePort' with nonfragile ABI.
   * Use 'NSNumber' and not 'NSString' in '-[NSUserDefaults
     setBool:forKey:]'.
   * Posting notification before 'NSThread' exit.
   * Actually declare optional 'NSFilePresenter' methods as optional.
   * In 'NSConcreteMapTable', fix replacing existing values in a weak
     objects map table.
   * Fix leaks in 'NSOperation'.
   * Various compat fixes for various MSYS systems, particularly around
     sockets code.
   * In 'NSData', 'NSFileManager' and more, various improvements when
     overwriting and creating files with respect to file attributes
     (owners, creation timestamp, etc).
   * Improve 'NSLog' output on Android.
   * Use 'instancetype' in 'NSURLRequest' header.
   * Define 'NSAttributedStringKey' and 'NSNotificationName'.
   * Add new 'NSURL' methods.
   * In 'GSMime', have '-contentFile' check the 'Content-Type' header
     before checking 'Content-Disposition'.
   * Fix a bug linking with WEAK symbols where binutils 2.3.5 would fail
     to link due to not all expected symbols being exported.
   * New 'plutil' utility.
   * Implementation of '[NSData rangeOfData:options:range:]' which finds
     the 'NSRange' in which the passed data occurs.
   * Change 'ENTER_POOL'/'LEAVE_POOL' so they no longer wrap the
     enclosed code in a loop, enabling use in some loops.
   * New 10.5 methods in 'NSRunLoop'/'NSURLConnection'.
   * Improve compatibility when building with ICU 68.
   * Fix compiling libdispatch integration of 'NSRunLoop' on Windows.
   * Add support for building on Windows with MSVC's Clang by passing
     the 'configure' flag '--host=x86_64-pc-windows'.  Use of an MSYS2
     shell without '-devel' packages is recommended.
   * Implementation of 'NSURLSession' and related classes.  This adds
     some dependencies on more recent versions of 'libcurl',
     'libdispatch' etc.
   * Fix initializing 'NSUUID' from a string.
   * Disable use of 'libcurl' if its headers are not found.

  * Updated libdispatch runloop integration so it is compatible

    NSUnitDispersion, NSUnitElectricCharge, NSUnitIlluminance,
    NSUnitElectricCurrent, NSUnitElectricPotentionDifference,
    NSElectricResistance, NSUnitMass, NSUnitEnergy,
    NSUnitFrequency, NSUnitPower, NSUnitSpeed,
    NSUnitFuelEfficiency, NSUnitPressure, NSUnitVolume,
    NSUnitLength.
  * Support for data directory on Android introduces
    GSInitializeProcessAndroid and makes use of the path
    returned by Context.getFilesDir() as the basis for storing
    data (e.g. NSUserDefaults) and when querying for directory
    paths (NSLibraryDirectory, NSApplicationSupportDirectory,
    etc.).

  * Updated timezone info for NSTimeZones.
  * On Android, support for NSTemporaryDirectory to use
    Context.getCacheDir(), and cleaning it up in

    credentials, and to avoid logging it when debugging is on.
  * Improvements in NSConcreteHashTable and NSConcreteMapTable.
  * In various places, switch away from deprecated
    CREATE_AUTORELEASE_POOL() to use the ARC-compatible
    ENTER_POOL and LEAVE_POOL macros.
  * When building the list of hosts to be probed to see if they
    have gdomap servers, fix code to include those explicitly
    defined in the config file.  Add -S option to list the
    addresses of the known gdomap servers.
  * Backward compatibility fix for ICU 65.
  * Update GSPrivateSymbolPath() so that, on the path where
    LINKER_GETSYMBOL is not available, we attempt to lookup
    classes using the prefix ._OBJC_CLASS_ for the 2.0 ABI
    (earlier ABIs use a prefix of __objc_class_name_ for the
    class definition.
  * Fix parsing of NSURLResponse content type header.
  * Fix for class lookup when using the 2.0 ABI.

   * Various improvements in tests.
   * Require ICU >= 50.
   * ICU is now detected using pkg-config.
   * Improve XML parsing.
   * Make NSXMLNode ivar a union representing different types, instead
