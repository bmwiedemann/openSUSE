%description
This package (formerly 'binary-serialise-cbor') provides pure, efficient
serialization of Haskell values directly into 'ByteString's for storage or
transmission purposes. By providing a set of type class instances, you can also
serialise any custom data type you have as well.

The underlying binary format used is the 'Concise Binary Object
Representation', or CBOR, specified in RFC 7049. As a result, serialised
Haskell values have implicit structure outside of the Haskell program itself,
meaning they can be inspected or analyzed without custom tools.

An implementation of the standard bijection between CBOR and JSON is provided
by the [cborg-json](/package/cborg-json) package. Also see
[cbor-tool](/package/cbor-tool) for a convenient command-line utility for
working with CBOR data.
