  <title>Serif Font for Classicists, Biblical Scholars, Medievalists, and Linguists</title>
  <description>Cardo is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs
of classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists. 
It also works well for general typesetting in situations where a
high-quality Old Style font is appropriate. Its large character
set supports many modern languages as well as those needed by
scholars. Cardo also contains features that are required for
high-quality typography such as ligatures, text figures (also
known as old style numerals), true small capitals and a variety
of punctuation and space characters.

Designer: David Perry
