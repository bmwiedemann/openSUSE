%description
Currently (beginning of 2017), there isn't 'cabal doctest' command.
Yet, to properly work doctest needs plenty of configuration. This library
provides the common bits for writing custom Setup.hs See
<https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2327 Cabal/2327> for the progress of
'cabal doctest', i.e. whether this library is obsolete.
