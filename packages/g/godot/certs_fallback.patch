Subject: System certs as fallback for project certs

Upstream:   offered to upstream
Rebased:    2023-03-03

If project has no value set for "network/ssl/certificates" (the default),
"default_certs" is not filled by function "load_default_certificates" because
we don't use builtin certs - BUILTIN_CERTS_ENABLED is not defined.

We use a distro specific "system_certs_path" as build option and apply it here
via "_SYSTEM_CERTS_PATH" (defined in included "core/io/certs_compressed.gen.h")
as fallback for certificates.

In result patch restores upstream behavior for certificate usage.
Difference is:
Where upstream by default uses hard coded certificates at build time, we hard
code path to the default certificates as "/var/lib/ca-certificates/ca-bundle.pem".
This bundle might be updated separately or admin can edit content of this file.

User can always define different path via Editor or Project settings.

See comments in patch for more details.
