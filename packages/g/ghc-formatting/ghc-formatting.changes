- Update formatting to version 7.1.2.
  7.1.2

  * Removed direct dependency on integer-gmp, instead using very similar code from the `text` package. This changed the implementation of `build` for `Integer`, which results in better performance in some cases, and no performance degradation. See the benchmarking reports in bench/reports for more details.
  * formatting now compiles on GHCJS (due to the change above).
  * Added some benchmarking, starting based on code from the `string-interpolate` package.
  * Added INLINE pragmas to many very short functions. Results in better performance in the benchmarks.
