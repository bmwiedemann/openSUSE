- Update formatting to version 7.2.0.
  7.2.0

  * Added `FromBuilder` and `formatted` to simplify using formatting with other APIs (thanks Kyle Butt).
  * Updated examples in comments to pass cabal-docspec (thanks Kyle Butt).
  * Fixed haddock parsing in ghc-8.8.4 (thanks Oleg Grenrus).
  * Generalised IO printing functions to use MonadIO (thanks Oleg Grenrus).
  * Added `(%+)` and `(<%+>)` for appending formatters with a space between them, the latter also behaving like `(<>)` (thanks Oleg Grenrus).
  * Allow building with Cabal 2.2 (thanks Jens Petersen).
  * Removed unused dependency on `ghc-prim`
  * Add a `no-double-conversion` build flag to optionally remove the dependency on `double-conversion` (Thanks Janus Troelsen)
  * The `no-double-conversion` flag also fixes the build on GHC 9.4 on which `double-conversion` is apparently broken

- Update formatting to version 7.1.3.
  7.1.3

  * Fix the GHCJS build by not using `double-conversion`, as it relies on a native C library which obviously isn't available in GHCJS (it is still used in native builds).

- Update formatting to version 7.1.2.
  7.1.2

  * Removed direct dependency on integer-gmp, instead using very similar code from the `text` package. This changed the implementation of `build` for `Integer`, which results in better performance in some cases, and no performance degradation. See the benchmarking reports in bench/reports for more details.
  * formatting now compiles on GHCJS (due to the change above).
  * Added some benchmarking, starting based on code from the `string-interpolate` package.
  * Added INLINE pragmas to many very short functions. Results in better performance in the benchmarks.
