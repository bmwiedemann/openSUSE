- Update to version 0.7.2
  * New Feature: Pies will not close when CTRL or SHIFT is
    pressed while clicking. This feature got requested several
    times so it is now reality! You can now perform multiple
    actions without having to re-open the pie.
  * Improvement: Gnome-Pie switched from GPL to MIT license.
  * Improvement: Gnome-Pie will now hide when it looses focus.
    This is helpful under wayland when users click on panels for
    example.
  * Improvement: Fixed several deprecation warnings.
  * Improvement: Added Dutch translation (thank you, Heimen
    Stoffels).
  * Bugfix: Fixed a segmentation fault when a new pie was added
    under Wayland.
  * Bugfix: Fixed some typos in the English translation (thank
    you, Jörg Frings-Fürst).
  * Bugfix: Removed creation of obsolete statistics file.
  * Bugfix: Fixed build with vala 0.42 (thank you, Rico
    Tzschichholz).

Fri Feb 24 22:36:23 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.7.0:
  + New Feature: Added the possibility to automatically fill the
    fields “name”, “command” and “icon” of a new slice by selecting
    an application from a list.
  + Improvement: The library “bamf” which has been made optional
    before is now completely removed from the dependencies. This
    makes the code base easier to manage and it seems that there is
    no improvement to the icon selection when using this library.
  + Bugfix:
    - It is now possible again to drag’n’drop URLs and URIs to the
      pie preview.
    - Long press for activation of slices works again.

  discovered by valac 0.35.x
