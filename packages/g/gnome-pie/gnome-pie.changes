- Update to version 0.7.0:
  + New Feature: Added the possibility to automatically fill the
    fields “name”, “command” and “icon” of a new slice by selecting
    an application from a list.
  + Improvement: The library “bamf” which has been made optional
    before is now completely removed from the dependencies. This
    makes the code base easier to manage and it seems that there is
    no improvement to the icon selection when using this library.
  + Bugfix:
    - It is now possible again to drag’n’drop URLs and URIs to the
      pie preview.
    - Long press for activation of slices works again.
- Add gnome-pie-fix-invalid-chainup.patch: Fix invalid chainup
  discovered by valac 0.35.x
