    <comment>- go1.21 (released 2023-08-08) is a major release of Go.
  go1.21.x minor releases will be provided through August 2024.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.21 arrives six months after go1.20. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
