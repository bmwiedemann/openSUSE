- go1.21+ change default GOTOOLCHAIN=auto to local to prevent go
  tool commands from downloading upstream go1.x toolchain binaries
  Refs boo#1212669
  * go1.21+ introduce new default behavior that can download
    additional versions of go1.x toolchain binaries built by
    upstream. See https://go.dev/doc/toolchain for details. The go
    tool would attempt toolchain downloads as needed to satisfy a
    minimum go version specified in go.mod of the program
    containing main() or any of its dependencies.
  * Builds in OBS can not access the network, download attempts
    would fail.
  * Builds in OBS should not use third party binary toolchains.
  * When GOTOOLCHAIN is set to local, the go command always runs
    the bundled Go toolchain.
  * Users can override the default GOTOOLCHAIN setting with
    go env -w, stored in in ~/.config/go/env.

- Add missing go.env to package. go.env sets defaults including:
  GOPROXY GOSUMDB GOTOOLCHAIN
  Refs boo#1212667
  * Starting in go1.21+ a missing go.env defaults to GOPROXY=''
    resulting in errors e.g. with online cmds e.g. go mod download:
    "GOPROXY list is not the empty string, but contains no entries"
    It is not clear why GOPROXY='' is not evaluated as "the empty
    string".
