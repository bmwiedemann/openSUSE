%description
Cryst provides a rich set of methods to compute with affine
crystallographic groups, in particular space groups. Affine
crystallographic groups are fully supported both in the
representation acting from the right and in the representation acting
from the left. The latter representation is the one preferred by
crystallographers. There are also functions to determine
representatives of all space group types of a given dimension.
