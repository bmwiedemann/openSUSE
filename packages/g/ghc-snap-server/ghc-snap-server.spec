%description
Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
Haskell. For more information or to download the latest version, you can visit
the Snap project website at <http://snapframework.com/>.

The Snap HTTP server is a high performance web server library written in
Haskell. Together with the 'snap-core' library upon which it depends, it
provides a clean and efficient Haskell programming interface to the HTTP
protocol.
