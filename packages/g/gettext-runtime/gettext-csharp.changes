-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 27 10:01:27 UTC 2025 - Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk@suse.com>

- autopoint requires diffutils (diff, cmp)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 24 09:21:14 UTC 2025 - Ana Guerrero <ana.guerrero@suse.com>

- Update to 0.26:
  * C, C++, Python, JavaScript, EmacsLisp, librep, Go, Ruby, awk, D, Tcl,
    Perl, PHP:
    - xgettext's heuristic recognition of format strings has been improved:
      strings like "100% complete" (with a space flag in a format directive)
      are no longer flagged as format strings by default, unless they occur
      in a context that requires a format string.  You can override this
      heuristic by using a comment of the form /* xgettext: c-format */.
  * Shell:
    - The documentation now mentions two other approaches for
      internationalizing messages with parameters in shell scripts.
    - xgettext now recognizes format strings in the 'printf' command syntax.
      They are marked as 'sh-printf-format' in POT and PO files.
    - Two new programs 'printf_gettext' and 'printf_ngettext' are provided,
      that do formatted output with a localized format string in a more
      efficient way (without spawning a subshell).
    - xgettext now recognizes the \c, \u, and \U escape sequences in dollar-
      single-quoted strings $'...'.
  # Improvements for maintainers:
  * xgettext:
    - When extracting a message with plural that is some format string,
      xgettext now verifies that the msgid and msgid_plural are compatible
      as format strings.  For most format string types, this still allows
      omitting from msgid a placeholder that is used in msgid_plural.  But
      when a placeholder is used in both msgid and msgid_plural, its type
      must be the same in both.
    - xgettext now suggests a refactoring when a translatable string
      contains an URL or email address.

  # Improvements for translators:
  * msggrep:
    - msggrep accepts two new options -W/--workflow-flags and -S/--sticky-flags
      that allow to select only messages that have a specified flag.

- Refresh patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 23 12:40:45 UTC 2025 - Ana Guerrero <ana.guerrero@suse.com>

- Do not build support for Java and C# on i586.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 17 07:42:56 UTC 2025 - Ana Guerrero <ana.guerrero@suse.com>

- Update to 0.25.1:
  * Bug fixes:
  - autopoint no longer fails if configure.ac contains no
    AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION or AM_GNU_GETTEXT_REQUIRE_VERSION invocation.
  - nls.m4 is installed again under $PREFIX/share/aclocal/.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 16 09:35:54 UTC 2025 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- Update to 0.25:
  * xgettext now supports Go
  * xgettext now supports TypeScript and TSX
  * Add support for the D programming language (library and tools)
  * Add support for the Modula-2 programming language (same)
  * xgettext has a new option '--generated' that customizes the way
    the 'POT-Creation-Date' in the POT file is computed
- build with libacl/libattr

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 15 16:06:29 UTC 2025 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- Update to 0.24.1:
  * Fix bad interactions between autoreconf and autopoint
  * xgettext: Creating the POT file of a package under Git version
    control is now faster. Also, the use of Git can be turned off
    by specifying the option --no-git

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  9 06:49:21 UTC 2025 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update upstream signing key and verify source signatures (again)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  9 19:35:55 UTC 2025 - Ana Guerrero <ana.guerrero@suse.com>

- Update to 0.24.0
  * Programming languages support:
    - C:
      + A new example 'hello-c-http' has been added, showing the use
        of GNU gettext in a multithreaded web server.
    - C++:
      + A new example 'hello-c++-gnome3' has been added.
    - Ruby:
      + A new example 'hello-ruby' has been added.
  * Improvements for maintainers:
    - When xgettext creates the POT file of a package under Git version
      control, the 'POT-Creation-Date' in the POT file usually no longer
      changes gratuitously each time the POT file is regenerated.

- Update to 23.0
  * Internationalized data formats:
    - XML
      + The escaping of characters such as & < > has been changed:
      + No escaping is done any more by xgettext, when creating a POT file.
      + Instead, extra escaping can be requested for the msgfmt pass, when
        merging into an XML file.
      + The default value of 'escape' in the <gt:escapeRule> was "yes";
        now it is "no".
      + This means that existing translations of older POT files may no
        longer fully apply. As a maintainer of a package that has
        translatable XML files, you need to regenerate the POT file and
        pass it on to your translators.
      + XML schemas for .its and .loc files are now provided.
      + The value of the xml:lang attribute, inserted by msgfmt,
        now conforms to W3C standards.
      + 'msgfmt --xml' accept an option --replace-text, that causes
        the output to be a mono-lingual XML file instead of a multi-lingual
        XML file.
      + xgettext and 'msgfmt --xml' now support DocBook XML files.
    - Desktop: xgettext now produces POT files with correct line numbers.
  * Programming languages support:
    - Java:
      + xgettext now has an improved recognition of format strings when
        the String.formatted method is used.
    - C#:
      + The build system and tools now also support 'dotnet' (.NET) as
        C# implementation.  In order to declare a preference for 'dotnet'
        over 'mono', you can use the configure option '--enable-csharp=dotnet'.
      + xgettext now recognizes strings with embedded expressions
        (a.k.a. interpolated strings).
    - Perl:
      + xgettext now reports warnings instead of fatal errors.
      + xgettext now recognizes strings with embedded expressions
        (a.k.a. interpolated strings).
  * Runtime behaviour:
    - In the C.UTF-8 locale, like in the C locale, the *gettext() functions
      now return the msgid untranslated. This is relevant for GNU systems,
      Linux with musl libc, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Cygwin, and Android.
  * Documentation:
    - The section "Preparing Strings" now gives more advice how to deal
      with string concatenation and strings with embedded expressions.
  * xgettext:
    - Most of the diagnostics emitted by xgettext are now labelled as
      "warning" or "error".
  * msgmerge:
    - The option '--sorted-output' is now deprecated.
  * libgettextpo library:
    - This library is now multithread-safe.
    - The function 'po_message_set_format' now supports resetting a format
      string mark.

Sat Feb 24 18:50:38 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 0.22.5:
  * xgettext's processing of Vala files with printf method
    invocations has been corrected (regression in 0.22)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 13 09:03:34 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.22.4
  * Bug fixes:
    - AM_GNU_GETTEXT now recognizes a statically built libintl on
      macOS and AIX.
    - Build fixes on AIX
- Update to version 0.22.3
  * Portability:
    - The libintl library now works on macOS 14.  (Older versions
      of libintl crash on macOS 14, due to an incompatible change
      in macOS.)
- Update to version 0.22.2
  * No information available upstream
- Update to version 0.22.1
  * Bug fixes:
    - The libintl shared library now exports again some symbols
      that were accidentally missing.
    - xgettext's processing of large Perl files may have led to
      errors.
    - "xgettext --join-existing" could encounter errors.
  * Portability:
    - Building on Android is now supported.
- Update to version 0.22.0
  * PO file format:
    - When a #: line contains references to file names that contain
      spaces, these file names are surrounded by Unicode characters
      U+2068 and U+2069. This makes it possible to parse such
      references correctly.
  * Improvements for maintainers:
    - The AM_GNU_GETTEXT macro now defines two variables
      localedir_c and localedir_c_make, that can be used in C code
      or in Makefiles, respectively, for representing the value of
      the --localedir configure option.
  * Programming languages support:
    - C, C++:
      + xgettext now supports gettext-like functions that take wide
        strings (of type 'const wchar_t *', 'const char16_t *', or
        'const char32_t *') as arguments.
      + xgettext now recognizes numbers with digit separators, as
        defined by ISO C 23, as tokens.
      + xgettext and msgfmt now recognize the format string
        directive %b (for binary integer output, as defined by
        ISO C 23) in format strings.
      + xgettext and msgfmt now recognize the argument size
        specifiers w8, w16, w32, w64, wf8, wf16, wf32, wf64
        (as defined by ISO C 23) in format strings.
      + xgettext and msgfmt now recognize C++ format strings, as
        defined by ISO C++ 20.  They are marked as 'c++-format' in
        POT and PO files. A new example has been added,
        'hello-c++20', that illustrates how to use these format
        strings with gettext.
    - Java:
      + The build system and tools now also support Java versions
        newer than Java 11. This is known to work up to Java 20,
        at least. On the other hand, support for old versions of
        Java (Java 1.5 and GCJ) has been dropped.
      + Tcl: xgettext now supports the \x, \u, and \U escapes as
        defined in Tcl 8.6.
  * Portability:
    - On systems with musl libc, the *gettext() functions in libc
      now work with MO files generated from PO files with an
      encoding other than UTF-8. To this effect, the msgfmt program
      now converts the messages to UTF-8 encoding before storing
      them in a MO file.  You can prevent this byusing the msgfmt
      --no-convert option.
    - On systems with musl libc, the *gettext() functions in libc
      now work with MO files generated from PO files with ISO C 99
      <inttypes.h> format string directive macros.  To this effect,
      the msgfmt program pre-expands strings with such macros. You
      can prevent this by using the msgfmt --no-redundancy option.
  * xgettext:
    - The xgettext option '--sorted-output' is now deprecated.
    - xgettext input files of type PO that are not all ASCII and
      not UTF-8 encoded are now handled correctly.
  * The base Unicode standard is now updated to 15.0.0.
  * Emacs PO mode:
    - Fix an incompatibility with Emacs version 29 or newer.
- Rebase patches:
  * gettext-dont-test-gnulib.patch
  * 0001-msgcat-Add-feature-to-use-the-newest-po-file.patch
  * 0002-msgcat-Merge-headers-when-use-first.patch
- Drop patch which isn't required anymore since newer java
  versions are already supported by upstream:
  * gettext-0.21-jdk17.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 10:33:41 UTC 2020 - Christian Vögl <christian.voegl@suse.com>

-Updated to version 0.21
 * Improvements for translators:
   When msgfmt writes a MO file, it now does so in such a way that processes
   that are currently using an older copy of the MO file will not crash.
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  9 11:17:04 UTC 2019 - Christian Vögl <cvoegl@suse.de>

- Added -lm flag to CFLAGS

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 11 13:08:04 UTC 2019 - Christian Vögl <christian.voegl@suse.com>

- Updated to version 0.20.1:
  + msgfmt now eliminates the POT-Creation-Date header field from .mo files.
  + msgmerge now has an option --for-msgfmt, that produces a PO file meant
    for use by msgfmt only.  This option saves processing time, in particular
    by omitting fuzzy matching that is not useful in this situation.
  + The .pot file in a 'po' directory is now erased by "make maintainer-clean".
  + It is now possible to override xgettext options from the po/Makefile.in.in
    through options in XGETTEXT_OPTIONS (declared in po/Makevars).
  + The --intl option of the gettextize program (deprecated since 2010) is
    no longer available. Instead of including the intl sources in your package,
    we suggest making the libintl library an optional prerequisite of your
    package. This will simplify the build system of your package.
  + Accordingly, the Autoconf macro AM_GNU_GETTEXT_INTL_SUBDIR is gone as well.
- Rebased gettext-po-mode.diff
- Removed gettext-needlessly_init_vars.patch (now in upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 27 20:24:49 UTC 2015 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- GNU gettext 0.19.4:
  * The --keyword option of xgettext now accepts same argument
    number for both singular and plural forms.
  * Programming languages support:
    - C#: xgettext now properly handles Unicode characters encoded
      with surrogate pairs.
    - C/C++: xgettext now recognizes ISO/IEC 9899:2011 string
      literals prefixed by R, u8, u8R, u, uR, U, UR, L, or LR.
    - Shell: xgettext now properly recognizes Bash ANSI-C quoting
      ($'...').
  * Bug fixes:
    - Fix integer overflow when reading certain MO files with
      msgunfmt.
    - Avoid invalid memory access in various cases.  In particular,
      when the same argument number is specified for singular/

      strings.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 17 21:56:18 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- GNU gettext 0.19.3:
  * Fix xgettext mishandling of octal character escapes in C.
  * Fix autopoint infinite recursion with certain configure.ac.
  * The po/Makevars file has a new field MSGINIT_OPTIONS, that can
    be used to adjust msginit's operation.  This is particularly
    useful for controlling line wrapping behavior together with
    MSGMERGE_OPTIONS and XGETTEXT_OPTIONS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 15 11:49:59 CEST 2014 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 0.19.2:

    fatal and terminate the command execution.
- switch to xz tarball

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  3 19:20:25 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- GNU gettext 0.19:
  - Programming languages support:
    * Desktop Entry:
      xgettext and msgfmt now support .desktop files, used by
      desktop applications, as input and output.
    * GSettings:
      xgettext now supports GSettings schema file format used by
      GNOME applications.
    * JavaScript:
      xgettext now recognizes E4X (ECMA-357) constructs.
    * PHP:
      Single and double quotes around heredoc markers are now
      recognized.
    * Python:
      The acceptable format specifiers in the braced-syntax format
      strings is now limited to the Standard Format Specifiers, to
      reasonably avoid false-positives.
    * Scheme:
      The gettext shorthand form _"abc", used by GIMP script-fu, is
      now recognized by xgettext.
    * C and Vala:
      xgettext now recognizes C99-style Unicode character escapes.
  - The --add-location option of msgattrib, msgcat, msgcomm,
    msgconv, msgen, msgfilter, msggrep, msgmerge, msguniq, and
    xgettext commands now takes an optional argument 'never',
    'full', or 'file', to control the format of "#: ..." comments.
  - msgfmt now has --source option to keep generated .java file
    when running in Java mode.
  - msgattrib now has --empty option that sets msgstr to empty when
    clearing fuzzy flag.
  * msgexec and msgfilter pass the plural information to subprocess
    through the environment variable MSG{EXEC,FILTER}_MSGID_PLURAL
    and MSG{EXEC,FILTER}_PLURAL_FORM.
  * New built-in filters 'quot' and 'boldquot' have been added to
    msgfilter.  These filters convert Latin quotation marks ('...',
    "...") into Unicode quotation marks (for example, U+2018) if
    possible, similar to the sed commands used in po/Rules-quot and
    po/Rules-boldquot.
  * The po/Makevars file has a couple of new options
    PO_DEPENDS_ON_POT and DIST_DEPENDS_ON_UPDATE_PO, that can be
    used to adjust the behavior of updating PO files on demand.
  * xgettext now strips prefixed string before the comment tag.
    This is useful to support C-style comment like this:
    /*
     * TRANSLATORS: first line
     * second line
     */
  * In this example, the extracted comment does not contain "* " at
    the beginning of each line.
  * libgettextpo library:
    - Memory leak fixes in the PO file parser.
  * Documentation:
    - A complete example showing the use of GNU gettext in a 
      GNOME 3 application has been added

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 12 21:56:01 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- GNU gettext 0.18.3.2:
  * Add missing extern-inline.m4 into archive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 12 10:45:36 UTC 2013 - christoph.miebach@web.de

- Version 0.18.3 - July 2013

  * Runtime behaviour:
    On Mac OS X systems, the setlocale() function now properly
    invalidates loaded message catalogs when a locale has been set.

  * Programming languages support:

    - C++:
      The gnu::autosprintf class now provides an assignment
      operator.

    - Glade:
      xgettext now supports GtkBuider file format used by Glade 3.
      xgettext now also extracts contexts (msgctxt) from Glade 2
      and GtkBuider files.

    - JavaScript:
      xgettext now partially supports JavaScript.  Since the
      current JavaScript specification (ECMA-262) does not define
      the standard set of formatting methods nor translation
      functions, the implementation supports only a limited
      set of formatting methods and translation functions commonly
      used in Gjs and other popular JavaScript implemenations and
      libraries.

    - Lua:
      xgettext now supports Lua, using Ľubomír Remák's lua-gettext.

    - Python:
      xgettext and msgfmt's format string checking now recognize
      Python format string in braced syntax (PEP 3101).  xgettext
      now also supports explicit string concatenation with '+' and
      handles platform dependent line terminators (LF/CR/CRLF)
      transparently.

    - Tcl:
      Bug fix in xgettext Unicode escape handling.

    - Vala:
      xgettext now supports Vala.

  * msgattrib now has --previous option to keep previous msgid when
    making messages fuzzy, similar to msgmerge --previous.

  * msgfmt now checks PO file headers more strictly with less
    false-positives.

  * 'gettextize' now checks macro directories specified with
    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS in configure.ac.

  * Portability:
    - msginit now does not require GNU sed.
    - The Makefile rule for generating en@quot and en@boldquot now
      uses @SED@ variable instead of hard-coded 'sed' command to
      allow users to supply GNU sed.

  * Future backward-incompatibilities:
    - In future Gettext versions, the files installed by
      'gettextize' will require Automake 1.10 or later.  This will
      improve the compatibility of user projects with newer
      Automake versions.
- Remove upstreamed patches:
  gettext-configure.patch

- Update to version 0.18.2.1: Version 0.18.2 - December 2012
  + xgettext now understands the block comment syntax of Guile 2.0.
  + libgettextpo library:
    * The initial msgstr of a new message is now "", not NULL.
    * Bug fixes in the functions po_message_is_range,
      po_file_check_all, po_message_check_all.
  + Installation options:
    The configure options --with-xz and --with-bzip2 can be used to
    specify alternate compression methods for the archive used by
    the 'autopoint' program. These options, together with
    --with-git, allow to trade dependencies against installed
    package size. --with-xz has the highest compression rate,
    followed by --with-git, followed by --with-bzip2.
  + Autoconf macros:
    * The autoconf macros installed by 'gettextize' now work with
      the forthcoming Automake 1.14 and require Autoconf version
      2.60 or newer.
  + Portability:
    * Building on MacOS X 10.7, Cygwin 1.7.10, and newer 64-bit
      mingw is now supported.

- Remove obsolete patches:
  + getext-stdio.in.patch
  + gettext-codecleanup.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 21 13:43:49 CET 2010 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 0.18.1. Changes since 0.17:
  Version 0.18.1 - June 2010

  * msggrep: A '$' anchor in a regular expression now also matches
    the end of the string, even if it does not end in a newline.

  * Dependencies:
    The libraries and programs are now linked with libunistring if
    this library is already installed.

  * Installation options:
    The configure option --with-cvs is deprecated. The 'autopoint'
    program will now use the 'git' program by default to compress its
    archive.  If the configure option --without-git is specified,
    'autopoint' will not rely on 'git', but will instead rely on a
    locally installed 3 MB large archive.

  Version 0.18 - May 2010

  * PO file format:
    There is a new field 'Language' in the header entry.  It denotes
    the language code (plus optional country code) for the PO file.
    This field can be used by automated tools, such as spell
    checkers. It is expected to be more reliable than looking at the
    file name or at the 'Language-Team' field in the header entry.

    msgmerge, msgcat, msgen have a new option --lang that allows to
    specify this field. Additionally, msgmerge fills in this new
    field by looking at the 'Language-Team' field (if the --lang
    option is not given).

  * xgettext and PO file format:

    For messages with plural forms, programmers can inform the
    translators about the range of possible values of the numeric
    argument, like this:
      /* xgettext: range: 0..15 */
    This information 'range: 0..15' is stored in the PO file as a
    flag attached to the message. Translators can produce better
    translations when they know that the numeric argument is small.

  * Colorized PO files:
    msgattrib, msgcomm, msgconv, msgen, msgfilter, msggrep, msginit,
    msgmerge, msgunfmt, msguniq, xgettext now have options --color
    and --style, like msgcat has since version 0.17.

  * msgmerge is up to 10 times faster when the PO and POT files are
    large. This speedup was contributed by Ralf Wildenhues.

  * msgcmp has a new option -N/--no-fuzzy-matching, like msgmerge has
    since version 0.12.

  * msgfilter now sets environment variables during the invocation of
    the filter, indicating the msgid and location of the messge being
    processed.

  * xgettext now can extract plural forms from Qt 4 programs. The
    recommended xgettext command-line options for this case are:
      --qt --keyword=tr:1,1t --keyword=tr:1,2c,2t --keyword=tr:1,1,2c,3t

  * xgettext --language=GCC-source now recognizes also the format
    strings used in the Fortran front-end of the GCC compiler, and
    marks them as 'gfc-internal-format'.

  * autopoint can now be used to update several PO directories all
    together.

  * PO mode changes:
    - PO files with plural entries are now correctly handled.
    - Editing a message with previous msgid (in comments) removes these
      comments.  Contributed by Noritada Kobayashi.

  * The po/Makevars file has a new field MSGMERGE_OPTIONS, that can
    be used to adjust msgmerge's operation.

  * The use of the macro AM_GNU_GETTEXT without 'external' argument
    and the --intl option of the gettextize program are deprecated
    and will be removed in the next release. Instead of including
    the intl sources in your package, we suggest making the libintl
    library an (optional) prerequisite of your package.

  * Updated the meaning of 'gcc-internal-format' to match GCC 4.3.

  * Installation options:
    The configure options --without-cvs and --with-git can be used to
    specify whether 'autopoint' will use the 'cvs' program, or the
    'git' program, or none at all. These options allow to trade
    dependencies against installed package size: If --without-cvs is
    specified and --with-git is not specified, 'autopoint' will not
    rely on 'cvs' or 'git', but will instead rely on a locally
    installed a 3 MB large archive.

  * Portability: The msgfilter program now also works on native Woe32
    - platforms. Compiled C# message catalogs now also work with
    - 'mono' versions from 2009
      or newer.

- Rename packages: gettext -> gettext-runtime and 
                   gettext-devel -> gettext->tools
  Packaging closely follows uptream recommendation with a few
  exceptions.

- Initialize variable to shut up gcc.
- Disable msgmerge-compendium-5 for now.

- Update to 0.17:
 * License:
   The gettext related programs and tools are now licensed under the GPL
   version 3, instead of the GPL version 2.

 * PO file format:
   The Project-Id-Version field in the header entry may now already be filled
   in the POT file. In this case, the translators don't need to fill it in.
   xgettext has new options --package-name and --package-version that allow
   to specify the package name and version from a Makefile.

 * Colorized PO files:
   The msgcat program has new options --color and --style that produce a
   colorized PO file output, where keywords, strings, comments, or format
   directives can be highlighted.  See the documentation section
   "Highlighting parts of PO files" for more info.

 * gettextize now has a --po-dir option that allows several PO directories to
   be updated all together.

 * Programming languages support:
   - Contexts (msgctxt) are now also supported for Java and C#.
   - C# with Qt: The support for Qt format strings has been updated for Qt 4.
   - C++ with KDE:
     xgettext has a new option --kde that triggers the recognition and marking
     of KDE 4 format strings.

 * Autoconf macros:
   - A new macro AM_XGETTEXT_OPTION can be used as an alternative to modifying
     po/Makevars.

 * libgettextpo library:
   - New functions are available for querying the list of supported format
     types.
   - The functions po_message_comments and po_message_extracted_comments
     return a multiline string where each line no longer starts with a 
     redundant space. The leading space in every comment line is now stripped
     while reading the PO file.
   - Conversely, when you pass a multiline string to the function
     po_message_set_comments or po_message_set_extracted_comments, you normally
     don't pass a space at the beginning of each line, because such spaces are
     no longer trimmed during output.

 * Documentation:
   - The "Users" chapter has been completely rewritten.
   - New section "Highlighting parts of PO files".
 - A complete example showing the use of GNU gettext in Java with the Qt/Jambi
   GUI toolkit has been added.

- Add tcl and perl-libintl-perl to BuildRequires (testsuite needs
  them).
- Remove call to gl_AC_TYPE_LONG_LONG from libasprintf's 
  configure.ac
