    <comment>- now that we have the proper files in the terminfo we can switch
  to using the distro provided terminfo files again.

- As we actually have a file conflict we should also have a
  conflict for the package. (boo#1235689)

- reenable the the standalone terminfo package. the ghostty
  terminfo file in the main terminfo package is broken.
  (boo#1235689)

- Disable the standalone terminfo package as the same file is now
  in the default terminfo package.</comment>

    <comment>- testing shows that we can not rely on the terminfo files coming
  from the ncurses package. reenable the terminfo-ghostty package 
  - we drop the conflicts with the terminfo package as the ghostty
    files should be dropped from that package now.</comment>

    <comment>- with the gobject-introspection we no longer need python3-nautilus
  replace the BuildRequites with python-nautilus-common-files 

- add gobject-introspection as BuildRequires to get the GI based
  dependencies

- Rename the nautilus plugin to just ghostty.py:
  It looks like the loader interprets the path
  com.mitchellh.ghostty.py as a python class hierachy and fails to
  load the plugin because of that.

- Update to 1.1.0 
  https://ghostty.org/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-0
- drop https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/commit/f60068eabd94e6784f3b557c7287c49dd36bb24c.diff
- new subpackage for nautilus plugin
  new BuildRequires python3-nautilus python3-gobject</comment>

  * see: https://ghostty.org/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-3
  * OSC 21 (Kitty color protocol): Ghostty no longer sends a
    response for non-query requests. #5770
  * The pty no longer has an initialize size of 0x0. The size is
    something non-zero but may still be incorrect due to a race
    condition between initializing the pty and drawing the GUI
    window. We do not consider this a bug. #5776
  * Increase the maximum number of parameters for CSI sequences
    to 24. This fixes some SGR sequences that were not working
    properly in Kakoune. #5949
  * The default binding for equalize_splits is now usable by
    default for US (and similar) keyboard layouts. It was
    previously an impossible binding.
    The binding is super+ctrl+shift+plus. #5646
  * The elvish shell integration sudo feature now works properly. #5992
  * GTK: Fix various rendering issues with the &quot;ngl&quot; GSK renderer.
    This resolves compatibility issues with GTK 4.18 and Gnome 48. #6877
  * GTK: Treat negative content scale values from GTK as 1.0.
    This fixes some known default setting issues on Gentoo systems. #5954
  * GTK: Make the split drag handle area smaller to allow
    selecting text on the boundary. This fix isn't perfect but is
    an improvement. A more comprehensive fix is planned for 1.2.0. #6000
  * GTK: The title configuration is now respected when a new tab
    is created from the tab overview. #6032
  * GTK: Improve the reliability of Korean input methods,
    SPECIFICALLY THE FCITX5-HANGUL INPUT METHOD. #6779
