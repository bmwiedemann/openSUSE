-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 18 09:30:34 UTC 2017 - adrien.plazas@suse.com

- Update to version 3.25.4:
  + The way the games collection is built has been completely
    reworked to replace the GameSource types generating Game
    objects from any way of the implementation's choice by the trio
    of UriSource, UriGameFactory and GameCollection. UriSource
    generate URIs from any way of the implementation's choice,
    UriGameFactory generate Game objects from URIs and
    GameCollection acting as a glue between the two. This new
    flexibility in the creation of the games collection helped to
    simplify the way many game types were defined and helped to
    introduce new game sources to the collection.
  + Game URIs can now be passed as command line arguments, allowing
    your game files to be opened with Games from your file manager.
    The game will be automatically started by doing so.
  + Add a "Add game files" button to the collection view, allowing
    you to add game files from the collection view to the
    collection.
  + Game resources passed via the command line or the "Add game
    files" button are stored in a database and restored when
    starting the application. This allows Games to see your games
    even if its game resources detection mechanisms failed.
  + Introduction of RetroSimpleType to replace many very similar
    plugins by this simple and easier to maintain generic
    implementation of the Libretro based game types.
  + Supported games:
    - Add support for Atari Lynx, MS-DOS, WonderSwan and WonderSwan
      Color games.
    - Improve the detection of PlayStation discs by parsing them as
      an emulator would instead of using lucky guessing the
      location of the required information in the disc.
    - Don't display desktop games setting the NoDisplay or Hidden
      keys.
  + Gamepad:
    - Port the gamepad handling system from Vala to C to avoid
      using Vala's preprocessor as it is poorly handled by the
      autotools, resulting in broken tarballs.
    - Make gamepads send events similar to GdkEvent.
    - Replace the custom input types by the Linux event codes.
  + UI:
    - Use the more appropriate GtkMessageDialog instead of
      GtkDialog for most of the existing custom dialogs.
    - Refine the look of MediaSelector, using checkmarks to denote
      the currently used media.
    - Use theme relative colors for the games collection.
    - Drop a useless sorting invalidation in CollectionIconView,
      which makes the game collection loads a bit faster.
  + Improved logging of the Libretro cores by using the Core.log()
    signal with the retro_g_log() function which have been
    introduced in retro-gtk recently. This will log messages from
    the Libretro core with the core's name as the log domain
    instead of GNOME Games.
  + Improve the parameters passed to the grep command to avoid
    injections.
  + Bump retro-gtk to 0.12.
  + Bump tracker-sparql to 2.0.
  + Updated translations.
- Add BuildRequires pkgconfig(sqlite3), new dependency.
- Replace pkgconfig(retro-gtk-0.10) with pkgconfig(retro-gtk-0.12)
  BuildRequires.
- Replace  pkgconfig(tracker-sparql-1.0) with
