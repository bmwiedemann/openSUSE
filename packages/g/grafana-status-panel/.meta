  <title>Grafana Status Panel</title>
  <description>This is a plugin meant to be used as a centralized view for the status of component in a glance. It is very similar to the Single Stat panel, but it can hold multiple values from the same data source. Each value can be used to customize the panel in different ways:

  - Mark the severity of the component
  - Mark if the component is disabled
  - Show extra data in the panel about the component
