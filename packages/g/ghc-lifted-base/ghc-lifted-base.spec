%description
'lifted-base' exports IO operations from the base library lifted to any
instance of 'MonadBase' or 'MonadBaseControl'.

Note that not all modules from 'base' are converted yet. If you need a lifted
version of a function from 'base', just ask me to add it or send me a patch.

The package includes a copy of the 'monad-peel' testsuite written by Anders
Kaseorg The tests can be performed using 'cabal test'.
