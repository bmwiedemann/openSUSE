  <title>The Multiple Git Repository Tool</title>
  <description>Repo is a tool built on top of Git. Repo helps manage many Git repositories, does the uploads to
revision control systems, and automates parts of the development  workflow. Repo is not meant to
replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git.
