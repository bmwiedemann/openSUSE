- Update text-ansi to version 0.3.0.
  ## [0.3.0] - 2023-09-24

  - Switch the underlying text builder from `text-builder` to `text-builder-linear`. This also affects the API provided by
    `Text.Builder.ANSI`; users that were relying on the `Buidler` type from `text-builder` specificially are encouraged
    to simply use older versions of this package until they are able to update their own code to use `text-builder-linear`
    instead.

    The motivation for this change is performance and encoraging the ecosystem to move in the right direction. See the
    `text-builder-linear` project for more details. In a nutshell, it is the superior builder type ;)
