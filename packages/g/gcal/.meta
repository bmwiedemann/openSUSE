  <title>A Program for Printing Calendars</title>
  <description>Gcal is a program for printing calendars.  Gcal displays a calendar for
a month or a year, eternal holiday lists, and fixed date lists.  The
program correctly omits the dates that were skipped when the current
Gregorian calendar replaced the earlier Julian calendar.</description>
