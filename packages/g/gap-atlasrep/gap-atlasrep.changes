- Update to release 2.1.9
  * Prescribing a ring in AllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos (3.5-7) and
    related functions now automatically prescribes its
    characteristic. Up to now, one had to specify also the
    characteristic, otherwise characteristic zero was erroneously
    assumed.
  * Up to now, AllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos (3.5-7) and related
    functions, when called only with a prescribed ring in positive
    characteristic, could erroneously return also entries about
    representations in characteristic zero.
  * The default for the user preference "AtlasRepDataDirectory"
    (see Section 4.2-2) has been improved in the situation where
    the package directory is not writable and the GAP session runs
    inside a Julia session; if this is the case, then a Julia
    scratchspace is used as the default.
  * The star ``*`` that may appear in some lines of the output of
    DisplayAtlasInfo (3.5-1) is now documented.

- update to 2.1.8:
  * An example in Section 2.1-2 of the Tutorial had to be adjusted
  because the results of the function
  SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation (Reference:
  SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation) depend on random
  computations, in particular the implementation in GAP 4.13 may
  yield a nicer representation than had been shown before.

- Update to release 2.1.7
  * Requesting certain matrix groups in characteristic zero had
    caused an error in version 2.1.6.
  * The name of a maximal subgroup of the group M_12.2 had to be
    changed from "D8.(S4x2)" to "2^3.(S4×2)" because the old name
    suggested a wrong group structure.

- Update to release 2.1.6
  * A method for ConjugacyClasses (Reference: ConjugacyClasses
    attribute) has been added that uses a straight line program
    for computing class representatives of a group that has been
    created with AtlasGroup (3.5.8), provided such a program is
    available.
