- Update to release 3.20
  * Many changes to the manual were made. Accumulated anachronisms
    were revealed by manual/example test extraction via AutoDoc.
  * Adjusted old C code to not define a bool type (the C23 standard
    will override it soon for gcc).
  * CoveringRadius() for codes over small non-binary fields was
    throwing an error.

- Update to new upstream release 3.14
  * The external binaries from J. S. Leon and Cen Tjhai can now
