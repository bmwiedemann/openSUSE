Wed May 10 20:35:53 UTC 2023 - Matthias Bach <marix@marix.org> - 1.7

- Add a new gamemode binary package
  * This provides gamemoderun and gamemodelist commands previously
    provided via the gamemoded package. However, these actually
    require libgamemodeauto0 which was missed.
  * You can now install the gamemode package to get the full set
    of GameMode functionality. Not being able to do this admittedly
    was confusing as was reported in bsc#1211086.
- Add feral.keyring to enable verifying the source signature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    requests GameMode.
  * gamemoded will now automatically reload the configuration 
    file when it is changed and update optimisations on 
    current clients.
  * Add support for using the client library inside Flatpak by 
    communicating with the daemon via a portal.
  * Client library now uses libdbus rather than sd-bus.
  * Fix gamemoderun to use the correct library path depending on 
    whether the app is 32-bit or 64-bit.

    an extra wrapper command for games launched with gamemoderun
    (e.g. a hybrid GPU wrapper such as optirun).
