Mon Mar 18 19:27:36 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.27.0:
  * [CHANGE] Discord Integration: Enforce max length in message.
    #3597
  * [CHANGE] API: Removal of all api/v1/ endpoints. These endpoints
    now log and return a deprecation message and respond with a

  * [FEATURE] Metrics: Introduced the experimental feature flag
    --enable-feature=receiver-name-in-metrics to include the
    receiver name in the following metrics: #3045
    alertmanager_notifications_total,
    alertmanager_notifications_failed_totall,
    alertmanager_notification_requests_total,
    alertmanager_notification_requests_failed_total,
    alertmanager_notification_latency_seconds
  * [FEATURE] Metrics: Introduced a new gauge named
    alertmanager_inhibition_rules that counts the number of
    configured inhibition rules. #3681
  * [FEATURE] Metrics: Introduced a new counter named
    alertmanager_alerts_supressed_total that tracks muted alerts,
    it contains a reason label to indicate the source of the mute.
    #3565

    webhook_url_file. #3555
  * [ENHANCEMENT] Microsoft Teams Integration: Introduced support

  * [ENHANCEMENT] Microsoft Teams Integration: Add support for
    summary. #3616
  * [ENHANCEMENT] Metrics: Notification metrics now support two new
    values for the label reason, contextCanceled and
    contextDeadlineExceeded. #3631
  * [ENHANCEMENT] Email Integration: Contents of auth_password_file
    are now trimmed of prefixed and suffixed whitespace. #3680
  * [BUGFIX] amtool: Fixes the error scheme required for webhook
    url when using amtool with --alertmanager.url. #3509
  * [BUGFIX] Mixin: Fix AlertmanagerFailedToSendAlerts,
    AlertmanagerClusterFailedToSendAlerts, and
    AlertmanagerClusterFailedToSendAlerts to make sure they ignore
    the reason label. #3599
  * Removal of API v1
    The Alertmanager v1 API has been deprecated since January 2019
    with the release of Alertmanager v0.16.0. With the release of
    version 0.27.0 it is now removed.
    A successful HTTP request to any of the v1 endpoints will log
    and return a deprecation message while responding with a status
    code of 410.
    Please ensure you switch to the v2 equivalent endpoint in your
    integrations before upgrading.
  * Alertmanager support for all UTF-8 characters in matchers and
    label names
    Starting with Alertmanager v0.27.0, we have a new parser for
    matchers that has a number of backwards incompatible changes.
    While most matchers will be forward-compatible, some will not.
    Alertmanager is operating a transition period where it supports
    both UTF-8 and classic matchers, so it's entirely safe to
    upgrade without any additional configuration. With that said,
    we recommend the following:
    If this is a new Alertmanager installation, we recommend
    enabling UTF-8 strict mode before creating an Alertmanager
    configuration file. You can enable strict mode with
    alertmanager --config.file=config.yml
    --enable-feature="utf8-strict-mode".
    If this is an existing Alertmanager installation, we recommend
    running the Alertmanager in the default mode called fallback
    mode before enabling UTF-8 strict mode. In this mode,
    Alertmanager will log a warning if you need to make any changes
    to your configuration file before UTF-8 strict mode can be
    enabled. Alertmanager will make UTF-8 strict mode the default
    in the next two versions, so it's important to transition as
    soon as possible.
    Irrespective of whether an Alertmanager installation is a new
    or existing installation, you can also use amtool to validate
    that an Alertmanager configuration file is compatible with
    UTF-8 strict mode before enabling it in Alertmanager server by
    running amtool check-config config.yml and inspecting the log
    messages.
    Should you encounter any problems, you can run the Alertmanager
    with just the classic parser enabled by running alertmanager
    --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature="classic-mode". If
    so, please submit a bug report via GitHub issues.
