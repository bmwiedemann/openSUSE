  attribute name generated by appending "_text" to the name of the
  base attribute. The packetizer's handling of write boundaries not
  coinciding with packet boundaries is improved.  Better support for
  mode and speed switching in the UBX driver.  PPS message now ships

Sat May 14 14:00:06 CEST 2011 - dmueller@suse.de

- move libgpsd.so.0 from the shlib subpackage to the main package,
  as it fileconflicts with other versions of it. the library is
  internal only anyway.

- gpsd-devel depends on python-gpsd too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  4 13:10:41 UTC 2011 - devel@navlost.eu

- Update to version 2.96:
  + Bumped maximum channel count to 32 to accommodate GPS+GLONASS devices.
  + API version bumped to 5, redesign finished (changes are documented
    in the Client HOWTO).
  + cgps now handles resize signals.
  + Code can now link with uClibc for embedded use.
  + Various bugs in the C++ binding have been fixed.
  + gpxlogger can now daemonize and write to a specified log file.
  + A gpsd client can now set any locale it likes, and JSON
    will still be parsed using the C locale matching the daemon's.
  + Clients are no longer required to define a gpsd_report() hook.
  + gpsd no longer emits probe strings to unidentified USB devices at startup.
  + JSON timestamps in TPV and SKY are now ISO8601 rather than seconds since
    the Unix epoch; the library handles the older style backward-compatibly. 
  + GPGST sentences are now parsed for noise statistics when a device emits
    them.
  + AIS and RTCM2 JSON dumps have device fields.
  + JSON reports now include 50bps subframe data if the device allows access to
    it.
  + gpsdecode can now dump NMEA GPS binary, and subframe data to JSON.
  + The RTCM2 code now understands and  analyzes RTCM2.3 messages 13,
    14, and 31, and has been checked against another analyzer.
  + The ancient Sager dump format for RTCM2 is abolished in favor of a JSON
    profile.

  + gpspipe has a new -T option for setting the timestamp format
  + xgpsspeed is completely rewritten in Python
  + Qt bindings for the client library
  + gpsdcode now uses | as a field separator in -c mode, as string

- Changes of version 2.94:
  + Error-checking in the 50bps subframe code has been greatly
    improved
  + The Garmin GPS driver can now use libusb for device discovery
  + The libgps library has been split apart; the service functions
    used by the daemon now live in libgpsd

    leap-second offset
- Changes of version 2.93:

Sat Mar 27 02:43:46 CET 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.92:

    from the 2.91 tarball.
  + Improve the json import test.
- Changes from version 2.91:
  + We have support for NMEA GLONASS sentences, and a regression
    test.
  + Clients now get a DEVICE notification on every driver switch.
  + It is possible to specify a TCP/IP AIS feed such as AISHub as a

  + Serious bitrot in the NTRIP support has been fixed - it was
    probably nonfunctional for several releases before this.
  + Fixed buggy display of satellite-used flags in cgps.
  + xgps is replaced by a rewrite in Python that uses pygtk,
    eliminating a dependency on Motif; also, it now displays AIS
    information.
  + Uniform treatment of display-unit defaulting and -u in xgps,
    cgps, and lcdgps.
  + Support for AIS message types 25 and 26.
  + Support for IPv6.

    affecting track error modeling has been fixed.

  python bindings.
- Add python-gtk Requires to gpsd-clients subpackage as xgps now
  depends on it.
- Use a valid group for the devel subpackage.
- Do not manually strip executables: this will be done by the build
  service.
