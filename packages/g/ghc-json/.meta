  <title>Support for serialising Haskell to and from JSON</title>
  <description>
	  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
	  It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse
	  and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
	  Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.

	  This library provides a parser and pretty printer for converting between
	  Haskell values and JSON.
