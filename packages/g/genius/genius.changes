Tue Jul  9 19:17:17 UTC 2019 - Bj√∏rn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Drop rarian-scrollkeeper-compat BuildRequires and stop passing
  --disable-scrollkeeper to configure: No longer needed nor used or
  recognized.
- Drop translation-update-upstream BuildRequires and macro: genius
  is no longer in the t-u-u database, so no extra translations
  available.
- Update macros to current standard.
- Drop conditional hicolor-icon-theme, shared-mime-info and
  update-desktop-files BuildRequires and post(un) handling of
  relevant macros as well as gtk3-tools, update-desktop-files and

    polygons.
  + Add LinePlotWaitForClick and LinePlotMouseLocation functions
    for interactive programs (used for some of the above new
    examples).
  + LinePlotDrawPoints and LinePlotDrawLine accept a column vector
    of complex nubmers.
  + Fix possible infinite loop on parse on systems with newer flex.
  + Fix setting of elements in transposed matrices (vectors).

  + Add more sizes of icons including SVG, and add Keywords to the
    .desktop file.
  + Documentation updates.
  + Fix PeriodicExtension function.
  + ErrorFunction (erf) is using MPFR for real values so it is far
    more precise and faster.
  + The Fourier series example is no longer using a hand coded
    graph and hand computed series, so it can now be easily
    modified to show series for different functions.
  + Fix GCC 5 compilation.
  + A couple of minor fixes in the plotting code including one
    possible crasher.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 24 12:32:14 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.19:
  + New menu: Examples. These are annotated programs that show some
    mathematical concept. Generally taken from the classes I have
    been teaching. They are installed under
    prefix/share/genius/examples/ and are mostly using graphics so
    only work in the graphical GNOME/GTK version
  + New plotting functions: SurfacePlotDrawLine,
    SurfacePlotDrawPoints, SurfacePlotClear, PlotWindowPresent.
  + New rotation animation in the surface plot window.
  + Fix string constants from compiled library starting with 'E'.

  + New general functions: KroneckerProduct (alias TensorProduct),
    NewtonsMethod, HalleysMethod, LambertW, LambertWm1,
    NonzeroColumns, NonzeroElements, DisplayVariables, PrintTable,
    SetElement, SetVElement.
  + New plotting functions: PlotCanvasFreeze/PlotCanvasThaw to
    improve flicker if doing animations with genius, and
    LinePlotDrawPoints function to draw just points without the
    line. While plotting errors are no longer forced into a dialog,
    and presence of errors is indicated in the graph window below
    the graph.
  + Allow setting color in LinePlotDrawLine with RGB vector. When
    the vector building notation is done with floats and the final
    number is within 2^-20 times the step size of the goal, assume
    there were roundoff errors and still add it, just like for
    loops, so something like 1.0:0.1:3.0 now works.
  + Implement subsecond precision in wait function.
  + Fix memory corruption error triggered in nested floating point
    for loops with a floating point step.
  + Few minor bug fixes and fix some more compile warnings in
    gtkextra.
  + Streamline the compiled file format (saves about 30kb).
  + A few improvements to the documentation.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 27 04:37:32 UTC 2013 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.17:
  + Better precision for graphs especially when zoomed it a lot,
    and make font smaller if needed.
  + Line plots and parametric plots now allow "fit dependent axis"
    automatically when y limits are unspecified. And this is the
    default in the UI.
  + Add export of graphs to PDF directly.
  + Line plot step size is adaptive, also line plots now detect
    jumps and do not draw a connecting line, try plotting UnitStep
    for example.
  + Use arrow keys to move around a line plot.
  + left-right arrow keys rotate surface plot.
  + All plots are now antialiased on the screen (due to GtkExtra
    update and cairo usage).
  + Update internal GtkExtra to 3.0.5, and forward port all our
    changes/fixes (this gets us closer to supporting GTK+3 at some
    point).
  + Completion for "help on function" in the GUI.
  + Fix FindRootBisection and FindRootMullersMethod.
  + Factors is now a lot faster on very large numbers (as fast as
    Factorize).
  + Fix placement of labels on surface plots.
  + A few small fixes and updates to the documentation.
  + A few minor bugfixes.
  + Update mersenne primes (new one is known).
  + Updated translations.

- Update to version 1.0.16:
  + Add SurfacePlotData and SurfacePlotDataGrid functions to draw
    arbitrary surface data, to allow more complicated 3d plots and
    3d plots from data.
  + Add LinePlotDrawAxisLabels and SurfacePlotDrawLegends
    parameters and add corresponding UI checkboxes 
  + Add ExportPlot function to export the current contents of the
    plot window to a file from GEL
  + Surface plot now allows "fit dependent axis" automatically when
    z limits are unspecified.  And this is the default in the UI
  + Add sinc, BesselJ0, BesselJ1, BesselJn, BesselY0, BesselY1,
    BesselYn functions
  + Plot window slightly bigger (700x500 now) and there are wider
    side margins in the lineplot (2D) version to make tick labels
    always fit.
  + In both 2D and 3D plots, tick labels now use scientific
    notation when needed to avoid ugly labels
  + In surface plot the gradient always shows only the range of the
    function, so color is more useful when zoomed out.
  + Simpler output when typing "help foo" when foo is neither
    defined nor documented.
  + When for/sum/prod loops are in terms of floating point numbers
    and the final number is within 2^-20 times the step size of the
    goal, assume there were roundoff errors and still execute the
    body
  + Handle wider matrices than 2^15 columns in expansion
  + Fix flicker when plotting surfaces to allow animations with 3d
    plots
  + Fix possible uninitialized crash when reading badly formed
    standard library (should never happen, but ...)
  + Fix LinearRecursiveSequence and allow it to take vector for n
  + Fix crash on uninitialized variables in conjugate transpose
  + Fix crash on extreme zoom out or zoom in of a graph
  + Fix derivatives of Im and Re
  + Fix file chooser dialogs not starting in current directory
  + Avoid double error about uninitialized variables
  + Spelling fixes and documentation fixes
  + Require MPFR at least 2.3.0
  + Updated translations.

    long to run.
  + Accept log instead of ln for symbolic derivative when used with
    only one parameter.
  + Updated translations.

- Added support for translation-update-upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 12 17:27:12 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:
  + %desktop_database_post/postun because the package ships at
    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.
  + %mime_database_post/postun because the package ships a mime
    type definition.

- Update to version 1.0.7:
  + SYNTAX: Added a possibility to exactly specify which variables
    are copied into a function's extra dictionary when it is being
    returned. E.g. "`(x) [x0] = (x-x0)" will copy x0 from the
    current context. This is a lot more efficient than the current
    behaviour which tries to copy everything referenced.
  + SYNTAX: Add "local" variables by specifying "local x,y,z" or
    "local *" as the first statement in a function. Local
    variables are not visible from higher contexts (functions
    called within)
  + CHANGE: all system parameters are now protected and cannot be
    redefined using the "parameter" keyword
  + Add UserVariables, UndefineAll, ProtectAll, and add Undefine as
    an alias to undefine.
  + Add trigonometric Fourier series related functions:
    NumericalFourierSeriesFunction,
    NumericalFourierSineSeriesFunction,
    NumericalFourierCosineSeriesFunction, FourierSeriesFunction,
    NumericalFourierSeriesCoefficients,
    NumericalFourierSineSeriesCoefficients,
    NumericalFourierCosineSeriesCoefficients, PeriodicExtension,
    EvenPeriodicExtension, OddPeriodicExtension
  + Fix changing floating point precision!
  + Fix uninitialized variable in graphing
  + Improve variable substitution for returned functions to be more
    efficient. Slightly changes behaviour with respect to global
    functions and variables used.
  + Plot windows now not treated annoyingly as dialogs
  + Fix compilation/decompilation of all function attributes.
  + Parse/Evaluate with a syntax error at end of string no longer
    terminate genius
