%description
girara is a library that implements a user interface that focuses on
simplicity and minimalism. Currently based on GTK+,
it provides an interface that focuses on three main
components: A so-called view widget that represents the actual
application (e.g. a website (browser), an image (image viewer) or the
document (document viewer)), an input bar that is used to execute
commands of the application and the status bar which provides the user
with current information. girara was designed to replace and enhance
the user interface that is used by zathura and jumanji and other
features that those applications share.
