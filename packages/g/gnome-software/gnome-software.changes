- Add gnome-software-nouser-proxy.patch: Do not pass proxy settings
  between user session and packagekitd. openSUSE does not grant the

  packagekitd are handled by libzypp/libproxy and are loaded from
  yast proxy settings.

  some repos are refreshed. The script extracts the appstream data
  from the repo metadata and installs it into the 'well known'
  location on the file system (/usr/share/app-info).
