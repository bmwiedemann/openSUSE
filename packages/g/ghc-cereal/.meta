  <title>A binary serialization library</title>
  <description>
A binary serialization library, similar to binary, that introduces an isolate
primitive for parser isolation, and replaces the asynchronous errors with
a user-handleable Either type. Similar to binary in performance, but uses
a strict ByteString instead of a lazy ByteString, thus restricting it to
 operating on finite inputs
