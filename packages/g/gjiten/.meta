  <title>Japanese Dictionary Browser for GNOME/GTK+</title>
  <description>Gjiten is a GNOME-based Japanese dictionary program. It uses some of
the xjdic code written by Jim Breen and his dictionary files.  Gjiten
also has a kanji dictionary. Any combination of stroke count, radicals,
and search key can be used for kanji lookups.  It requires a working X
input method (such as kinput2) for Japanese input.
