Tue Mar 21 07:56:45 UTC 2023 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 4.11.1:
  * github.com/pkg/errors is no longer used to wrap errors.
  * Docker secrets are now supported for the MaxMind account ID and license key. 
  * The Dockerfile now has a Healthcheck that makes sure the modification date of
    the database directory is within the update period.
  * Removed extra underscore in script variables preventing the Docker secret
    support added in 4.11.0 from working as expected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  9 10:35:24 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to version 4.10.0:
  * HTTPS proxies are now supported.
  * An HTTP request to get the filename for the edition ID
    has been removed. This was previously required as the GeoIP
    Legacy edition IDs bore little relation to the name of
    the database on disk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  1 15:20:57 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to version 4.9.0:
  * The client now sets the User-Agent header.
  * The error handling has been improved.
  * The goreleaser configuration has been consolidated. There is now
    one checksum file for all builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 08 15:51:20 UTC 2021 - info@paolostivanin.com

- Update to version 4.8.0:
  * The Docker container now supports the following new environment
variables: GEOIPUPDATE_CONF_FILE and GEOIPUPDATE_DB_DIR

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 20 07:05:44 UTC 2021 - Johannes Segitz <jsegitz@suse.com>

- Added hardening to systemd service(s) (bsc#1181400). Modified:
  * geoipupdate.service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 23 14:36:31 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 4.7.1: 
  * In verbose mode, we now print a message before each HTTP request.
    Previously we would not print anything for retried requests.
  * Expected response errors no longer cause request retries. For example, we
    no longer retry the download request if the database subscription has
    lapsed.
  * When running with GEOIPUPDATE_FREQUENCY set, the Docker image will now
    stop when sent a SIGTERM instead of waiting for a SIGKILL. Pull request
    by Maxence POULAIN. GitHub #135.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 16 12:19:29 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 4.6.0
  * Show version number in verbose output.
  * Retry downloads in more scenarios. Previously we would not retry
    failures occurring when reading the response body, but now we do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  4 15:54:26 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to version 4.5.0:
* We no longer use a third party library for exponential backoff
* The edition ID is now included when there is a failure retrieving
  a database
* The Docker image no longer prints the generated GeoIP.conf when
  starting up. This prevents a possible leak of the account's
  license key
* The minimum Go version is now 1.11.
* Failing HTTP requests are now retried using an exponential backoff.
  The period to keep retrying any failed request is set to 5 minutes
  by default and can be adjusted using the new RetryFor
  configuration option.
* When using the go package rather than the command-line tool, the
  null value for RetryFor will be 0 seconds, which means no retries
  will be performed. To change that, set RetryFor explicitly in the
  Config you provide, or obtain your Config value via
  geoipupdate.NewConfig.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 07 08:06:55 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

  * Use correct org name
  * Add a less-strict .yamllintrc
  * Test on go 1.14.x
  * Shows location of GeoIP.conf when issue in file
  * Remove extra space
  * Fix typo in config file generation
  * Make the edition IDs list format clearer

- Fixed build

- Update to version 3.1.1

  * This version now allows parsing of license keys longer than 12
    characters.

- Update to version 3.1.0

  * This version restores the ability to use the `AccountID` / `UserId`
    999999 along with an all-zero license key when downloading free
    databases. However, the use of this combination is not recommended
    and may break in future versions.
  * When printing verbose output, only the first four character of the
    `LicenseKey` will now be displayed.

- Update to version 3.0.1

  * When there were no updates available, 3.0.0 incorrectly returned an
    exit code of 1 instead of 0. This release reverts to the pre-3.0.0
    behavior, returning an exit code of 0 in this case.

- Update to version 3.0.0

  * BREAKING CHANGE: When downloading the free databases without a
    MaxMind account, you must either not have `AccountID`, `UserId`,
    or `LicenseKey` set in your configuration file or they must be set
    to the zero values previously recommended in our documentation. Any
    other value will cause an authorization error.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: The configuration options `Protocol`,
    `SkipPeerVerification`, and `SkipHostnameVerification` are no longer
    supported. If they are present in the configuration file, they will
    be ignored. HTTPS with peer and hostname verification will be used
    on all requests.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: The configuration file must have the `AccountID`
    or the deprecated `UserId` when downloading a paid database.
    Previously, when downloading the GeoIP Legacy Country database, you
    were able to only provide the `LicenseKey`.
  * IMPORTANT: `geoipupdate-pureperl.pl` has been removed and will no
    longer be distributed with `geoipupdate`. This Perl script had known
    issues and did not have feature parity with the C implementation. If
    you were using the Perl version, we recommend that you switch to the
    C version. If you are not able to do this, you may continue using the
    Perl version distributed with 2.5.0.
  * This program no longer uses the following endpoints:
    `/app/update_getipaddr`, `/app/update`, and `/app/update_secure`.
    `/geoip/databases/{edition_id}/update` is now used instead.
  * Fixed issue in `gu_strnlen()` dereferencing a pointer before checking
    that it was in array bounds. Issue found by fcntl.
  * We now update the default GeoIP.conf during installation so that
    directory paths match build parameters. Previously this config always
    said the data directory was under /usr/local/share which was not always
    accurate.
  * Improve the error checking and display the underlying reason for the
    error when possible. Reported by Jonathan Kosgei. GitHub #82.
  * Document that the `LockFile` is not removed from the filesystem after
    a successful exit from the program. GitHub issue #79.
  * Make default configuration directory agree with default installation
    directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 16 09:09:29 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 2.5.0:
  * Document the LockFile option in the GeoIP.conf man page.
  * Remove unused base64 library.
  * Add the new configuration option PreserveFileTimes. If set, the
    downloaded files will get the same modification times as their
    original on the server. Default is 0 (unset).
  * Use the correct types when calling curl_easy_setopt().
  * In GeoIP.conf, the UserId option was renamed to AccountID and
    the ProductIds option was renamed to EditionIDs. The old
    options will continue to work, but upgrading to the new names
    is recommended for forward compatibility.
- Cleanup previous changelog entry
- Run tests during build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 16 15:35:45 UTC 2017 - Mathias.Homann@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.4.0:
  * geoipupdate now checks that the database directory is writable.
    If it is not, it reports the problem and aborts.
  * geoipupdate now acquires a lock when starting up to ensure only
    one instance may run at a time. A new option, LockFile, exists
    to set the file to use as a lock. By default, LockFile is the
    file .geoipupdate.lock in the database directory.
  * geoipupdate now prints out additional information from the
    server when a download request results in something other than
    HTTP status 2xx. This provides more information when the API
    does not respond with a database file. In conjunction with
    changes to the download service itself, errors such as lacking
    a subscription no longer show up with the message "not a valid
    gzip file".
  * ${datarootdir}/GeoIP is now created on make install.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  5 15:40:45 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 2.3.1:
  * geoipupdate now uses TCP keep-alive when compiled with cURL
    7.25 or greater.
  * Previously, on an invalid gzip file, geoipupdate would output
    binary data to stderr. It now displays an appropriate error
    message.
  * Install README, ChangeLog, GeoIP.conf.default etc into docdir.
  * $(sysconfdir) is now created if it doesn't exist.
  * The sample config file is now usable.

    rename to make it durable in the event of a crash.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  8 13:56:31 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.2.1
  * Version bump to fix PPA issue
- Changes from version 2.2.0
  * geoipupdate now verifies the MD5 of the new database before 
    deploying it. If the database MD5 does not match the expected MD5,
    geoipupdate will exit with an error.
  * The copy of base64.c and base64.h was switched to a version under
    GPL 2+ to prevent a license conflict.
  * The LICENSE file was added to the distribution.
  * Several issues in the documentation were fixed.
- Remove gpl-2.0.txt; now included in the tarball
