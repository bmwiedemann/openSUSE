  <title>The GNU Image Manipulation Program</title>
  <description>The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a powerful image
composition and editing program, which can be extremely useful for
creating logos and other graphics for Web pages.  The GIMP offers many
of the tools and filters you would expect to find in similar commercial
offerings and contains some interesting extras as well. The GIMP
provides a large image manipulation toolbox, including channel
operations and layers, effects, subpixel imaging and antialiasing, and
conversions- all including multilevel undo. The GIMP offers a scripting
facility, but many of the included scripts rely on fonts that we cannot
distribute.</description>
