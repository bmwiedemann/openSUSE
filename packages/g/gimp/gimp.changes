Wed Feb 22 10:13:56 UTC 2023 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 2.10.34:
  - Core:
    - Check for updates now works on macOS (backported from 2.99.14).
    - Update help IDs for better integration with the documentation website.
    - Symmetry dockable contents is now shown, yet deactivated, when no images are
      opened, improving discoverability (backported from 2.99.14).
    - DBus fully disabled on macOS (in some case, it could even freeze GIMP
      process when dbus is present yet not responding). Open With feature (e.g.
      from file browsers) still work fine as it uses a different code path on
      macOS. Other features using dbus (opening files or running batch commands
      from a separate GIMP process) won't work, but they probably never did on
      macOS anyway.
    - "Canvas Size" dialog took too much vertical space and now better uses the
      horizontal space by moving the preview and offset fiels to the right side,
      and the "Center" button just below (backported from 2.99.8).
    - Template selector (backported from 2.99.6) in resize dialog.
    - Color scale preferences (0..255/0..100 and LCh/HSV settings in Colors
      selection dialogs) are now remembered across sessions.
    - Eye icon header added to the item tree views to make it more obvious where
      to click for item visibility and links (backported from 2.99.10)
    - Revert color proofing behavior changed in 2.10.32 which resulted in
      inconsistent past workflows.
    - "Lock path strokes" tooltip for the dockable icon was renamed "Lock path".
  - Plug-ins:
    - DDS: make GUI translatable.
    - file-raw: added high bit depth precision export (partial backport from
      2.99.12).
    - TIFF:
      * Various bug fixes;
      * better check for invalid resolutions on import;
      * do not generated warnings for incorrect RichTIFFIPTC tags produced by
        Adobe products (only output a message to stderr, for not completely
        ignoring these);
      * Loading "reduced" image or not is now an option. We use a heuristic for
        the default value of said option (trying to guess if it's a thumbnail by
        using common usage), but final decision is now up to one knowing the image
        you load (backported from 2.99.14);
      * Default TIFF export format is "normal" TIFF, not BigTIFF (making it
        default was definitely an error in 2.10.32).
    - PSD:
      * Various bug fixes;
      * Useless physical unit conversion removed;
      * Backported improvement (2.99.10) for importing layers with clipping set
        (leading to color bleeding);
      * Backported improvements (2.99.10) for importing clipping layers;
      * Paths are now exported (backported from 2.99.14).
    - WebP: more informative error messages in some cases.
    - Flame: various bug fixes.
    - JPEG-XL:
      * metadata import backported from 2.99.14 - (requires libjxl 0.7.0)
      * Partial backport (2.99.8) of JPEG-XL export; export is always in 8bit
        lossless.
    - HEIF: various bug fixes.
    - Dicom: various bug fixes.
    - help:
      * macOS: https support now working fine for help files (bypassing
        lack of support in GIO for macOS platform).
    - animation-play: fixed on macOS.
    - PDF:
      * Import: new option "Fill transparent areas with white" to fill the
        background in white (ON by default as most office PDF writers seem to rely
        on readers filling the background with white), allowing importing
        transparent PDF files.
      * Export: new option "Fill transparent areas with background color" allowing
        to decide whether to export a PDF with transparent background.
    - TGA:
      * Added a workaround to load wrongful TGA files exported by Krita (which
        they fixed on their side too now, see Krita bug 464484).
    - ICO and CUR:
      * Magics detection for these formats has been removed (now using only using
        filename extension) because it was interfering with the detection of
        certain types of TGA images (which are likely more common than ICO and CUR
        files, and extension for these should be reliable enough).
  - Libgimpbase:
    - GimpMetadata API (in particular the gimp_metadata_set_from_*() functions)
      are now much less memory-hungry (backported from the main dev branch) when
      using GExiv 0.12.2 or over. With some huge metadata, it could cause long
      freeze or even crashes of plug-ins.
  - Libgimpwidgets:
    - Color-picking with X11 is now the default when compiled with X11, even if a
      color-picking portal also exists, because it is always right, whereas
      portals return color in display space without the space information itself
      (i.e. without profiles).
    - New dedicated GimpPickButton implementation for Windows (backported from
      2.99.14).
  - Libgimp:
    - New wrapper functions around GEGL ops, which also map to items in our Color
      menu:
      * gimp_drawable_shadows_highlights()
      * gimp_drawable_extract_component()

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 15 20:47:00 UTC 2022 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 2.10.32: (boo#1199653 CVE-2022-30067)
  - Core:
    - Adding support for localized glyphs ('locl') in Text tool
      depending on the value of the "Language" field in Text tool
      options.
    - XCF import nows drop Xmp.photoshop.DocumentAncestors tags
      after 1000 of them, similarly to what libgimpbase now does.
      This could happen in XCF files which were created e.g. from a
      PSD import before we handled the issue in libgimpbase.
    - XCF import:
      - made more robust by ignoring (with a warning) invalid
        parasites and continuing to load the rest of the file
        (which might be valid). This way, we are able to salvage
        more cases of partially corrupted XCF files.
      - additional safety checks to detect broken XCF files.
    - Version check can be globally disabled through a value in the
      `gimp-release` file. This would allow to use the same build
      on repositories with an update channels (where we don't want
      update check notifications) and on standalone (where we want
      them).
  - User Interface:
    - Removed titlebar/borders from Windows Splash Screen.
    - All official themes now have on-hover indicator around eye
      and link toggles in Layer/Channel/Path Dialog tree-views.
    - Dark theme:
      - Hover-on effect on radio menu items to improve readability.
    - Color icon theme:
      - Thin contrast border for 'close' and 'detach' to improve
        their readability against dark backgrounds on mouse-hover.
  - Plug-ins:
    - TGA: improving indexed images with alpha channel support
      (both import and export).
    - DICOM: Fix endian conversion for photometric interpretation
      "MONOCHROME1".
    - file-raw: "RGB Save Type" confusing dialog label renamed to
      "Palette Type" as on the main dev branch.
    - screenshot: option to capture cursor in now available on
      Windows.
    - pygimp: new optional parameter `run_mode_param` (defaulting
      to True) to register() function of the Python binding, which
      allows to make the "run-mode" parameter optional when
      creating a new PDB procedure. This is already used to fix
      "file-openraster-load-thumb" without changing its signature.
    - BMP: new PDB procedure "file-bmp-save2" which supports all
      options available interactively.
    - BigTIFF: our TIFF plug-in now officially supports BigTIFF
      import and export.
      - Import was actually already working transparently if you
        had a recent enough libtiff. Now the recent libtiff is
        enforced by dependency requirements.
      - Export support was added with a checkbox in the interactive
        dialog and a new "bigtiff" argument in the "file-tiff-save"
        PDB procedure.
      - When an interactive export of ClassicTIFF fails for the
        explicit reason of "Maximum TIFF file size exceeded", the
        export dialog is raised again with a message proposing to
        try again as BigTIFF or trying another compression
        algorithm. This allows because discoverability and
        understandibility of the issue, while not forcing BigTIFF
        export (since it might not be supported everywhere).
      - Unlike the same change on the main dev branch, this
        backport comes without a dependency requirement bump, which
        means this will only work if GIMP is built with recent
        enough libtiff.
    - Raw: more robust load able to load as much as possible from
      the file, then fill the rest with white, when offset and
      dimensions are bigger than actual file size.
    - Improved support of a few plug-in code for building under
      UCRT Windows environment (more modern C runtime library than
      MINGW).
    - EPS: loading transparent EPS files now supported.
    - JPEG XL: import backported from the `master` (2.99) branch.
    - WebP: export has a new IPTC checkbox (saved through XMP) as
      well as a thumbnail checkbox. (backported from dev branch,
      since 2.99.8)
    - DDS: export has a new flip option (useful for some game
      engine) as well as a new savetype option to export all
      visible layers (not only the active one).
    - TIFF:
      - import support for 8 and 16 bit CMYK(A) TIFF files.
      - 1, 2 and 4-bit B/W images are now converted to indexed
        rather than grayscale as it seems that there is more of a
        use case for these images to be handled as indexed, even
        though technically they can be considered grayscale. In the
        future we could add an option at loading time where the
        user can choose whether they prefer it to be loaded as
        indexed or grayscale.
      - Fix loading images generated by MATLAB's blockproc
        function.
      - More robust loading for 8 bps grayscale MINISWHITE TIFF.
  - Libgimp:
    - New gimp_plug_in_error_quark() as a generic GQuark/GError
      domain for plug-ins (backported from 2.99.6).
    - gimp_drawable_brightness_contrast() now works in the [-1.0,
      1.0] range (it's more of a fix than a change because it's
      what it should have been from the start).
    - Better management of modification time in metadata: IPTC tag
      Iptc.Application2.DateCreated is not overridden anymore as it
      is the original creation date of the image. Instead we set
      the XMP tag Xmp.xmp.ModifyDate for file modification time and
      Xmp.xmp.MetadataDate for metadata modification time.
    - Format of Xmp.tiff.DateTime is now properly set with timezone
      as a consequence of the previous improvement.
  - Libgimpbase:
    - Limit to 1000 ancestors when importing images with incredible
      amount of `Xmp.photoshop.DocumentAncestors` tags, which is
      most likely due to a bug in some versions of Photoshop (in
      some PSDs, we encountered over 100,000 such tags; it probably
      makes no sense that a document could have that many ancestor
      documents). GIMP will now stops at 1000 such tags before
      dropping the rest and continue loading the file.
  - Icons:
    - Chain icons for the Color icon theme reworked from the
      Symbolic versions (with contrast borders to work on any
      background color) so that the "broken" and full variants are
      easily distinguishable.
  - Translations:
    - New Galician and Georgian translations for the Windows
      installer.
    - 20 translations were updated: Catalan, Chinese (China),
      Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Georgian, German,
      Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian,
      Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.
  - Build:
    - Bumping minimum GEGL to version 0.4.36.
- drop gimp-CVE_2022-30067.patch: included in update

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 24 09:20:53 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Do not recommend lang package: the lang package has smarter
  supplements in place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 18 14:52:26 UTC 2022 - Michael Gorse <mgorse@suse.com>

- Add gimp-CVE_2022-30067.patch: fix out of memory when reading
  XCF (boo#1199653 CVE-2022-30067).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 21 19:22:16 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 2.10.30
	- Core:
    - Do not follow subpixel font rendering choice from system
      settings for text layer rendering. These systems are useful
      for GUI rendering on a screen of a specific type and pixel
      order. Yet when rendering an image which can be zoomed in or
      out, showed on various screens or even printed, subpixel font
      rendering doesn't make sense.
    - Rewrite the core selection drawing logics so that it works on
      macOS Big Sur and over. This is a backport (adapted to GTK+2)
      of the fix brought in GIMP 2.99.8 for Wayland and macOS.
    - Ignore MakerNote metadata tag at export and only store the
      tags that go in it, hence avoiding partial invalid metadata.
    - Color picking from Colors dockable can now use the
      Freedesktop portal.
    - On Windows, move from GetICMProfile() to
      WcsGetDefaultColorProfile() because the former is broken in
      Windows 11.
	 - Plug-ins:
     - metadata-viewer: improve how XMP tags with multiple values
       are handled and shown (now each value on a separate line for
       better readability).
	   - metadata-editor:
       * XMP array tags of type BAG and SEQ are now on separate
         lines.
       * Comparing XMP tags with equivalent IPTC tags with multiple
         values, each value is compared individually, instead of
         comparing the list as a whole.
     - Many robustness improvements and other fixes to the metadata
       plug-ins.
     - AVIF: prefer AOM encoder for export.
     - PSD:
       * Skip sanity check for mask of rendered layers as some layer
         mask have invalid dimensions in such cases. They will now
         be loaded correctly.
       * Fixed loading of CMYK PSD files without alpha.
       * Fixed loading of CMYK images without layers.
       * Fixed loading of merged image of a 16 bit per channel RGBA
         PSD file with the alpha channel opaque.
      - PBM: large file export now always works and does not depend
        anymore on the platform's long int size.
      - Screenshot:
        * GNOME shell implementation dropped because the D-Bus API
          has been restricted to core components for security
          reasons, thus our plug-in was failing.
        * KDE portal moved as last fallback after the X
          implementation (when running on X) and Freedesktop portal,
          because KDE is also starting to block API calls for
          security reasons.
- drop 0001-Issue-6210-Subpixel-font-rendering-system-settings-s.patch
  included in update

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 22 09:50:04 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Add upstream patch (GIMP issue #6210)
  + 0001-Issue-6210-Subpixel-font-rendering-system-settings-s.patch
    Fix issue where the textool produces false color artifacts
    when using font anti-aliasing and system is set to subpixel
    rendering.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  7 12:50:49 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- gimp-tips no longer has translations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 18 23:03:21 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 2.10.28
  - Core:
    - Dashboard now has memory support in OpenBSD.
    - Default shortcuts Shift+[ and ] for tool size changed to {
      and }.
    - Performance improvements for GIMP on macOS Big Sur: these
      improvements were actually already applied in our macOS
      packages since GIMP 2.10.22, but were applied upstream
      directly only now.
  - User Interface:
    - Dark theme: improve accessibility of GtkRadioButton by adding
      a white border on mouse-hover.
    - Gray theme: set light background for selected text in Layers
      and Paths dockable dialogs to make text visible.
    - Dark, Gray and Light themes: remove 3D shadow box around eye
      and link toggles in Layers, Channels, and Paths dockable
      dialog tree views.
  - Plug-ins:
    - Improved DDS support and fix some red/blue bit swap for
      RGB10A2 DDS.  The plug-in version is incremented so that it
      is able to catch and correct previously incorrect RGB10A2
      images exported by older versions of our plug-in.
    - DDS files with "L16" - a 16 bit luminance channel - are now
      loaded in 16-bit.
    - DICOM images:
      * Support for planar configuration.  Support for deprecated
      * big endian transfer.
    - TIFF images:
      * Thumbnail storing now done by storing the thumbnail as the
      * second
        page in the file (through Exiv2) and setting metadata
        "Exif.Thumbnail.NewSubfileType" to 1 (reduced resolution
        image) instead of storing the thumbnail as a subifd. This
        was done because of a Windows bug locking TIFF files with
        thumbnail stored as subfid.
      * Symmetrically, loading will ignore pages marked as "reduced
        resolution image" (i.e. it will consider them as
        thumbnails), as well as try to guess if a page (without
        subfile type) is a thumbnail when it meets following
        criteria: second page with YCbCr PhotometricInterpretation,
        old style jpeg compression while the first page has a
        different PhotometricInterpretation or compression.
  - Script-fu:
    - New (dir-make "/dir/name" mode) function to create a
      directory.
  - Build:
    - Fix uninstalled white-border prelight file.
    - On Windows, *.rs file extension is not associated with SUN
      Raster images anymore. The reason is that this file extension
      is mostly used for Rust code files nowadays. If Windows could
      detect file formats with "magic numbers" (i.e. byte
      identifiers), it would not be a problem, but since it relies
      apparently only the extension, it's better to remove this
      association.
    - Oppositely on Linux and other Unix-like systems using desktop
      files, add the image/x-sun-raster MimeType which was
      forgotten (there, detection should be fine and not depend on
      file extension).
    - gimp30-tips.mo is not installed anymore (only used during the
      build to generate gimp-tips.xml with multiple language
      support).
    - --enable-check-update now has an "auto" value, which is the
      new default. It is equivalent to "yes" for Windows and macOS
      and "no" in all other cases.
    - New unit test to check that localizations listed in the
      installer script match available po files in
      po-windows-installer/.
    - "msys*" host value now detected as Windows builds.
    - Bumping minimum GEGL to version 0.4.32.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 01:34:27 UTC 2021 - Stanislav Brabec <sbrabec@suse.com>

- Remove obsolete translation-update-upstream support
  (jsc#SLE-21105).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  4 17:41:02 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Move rpm macros.gimp from /etc/rpm to %{_rpmmacrodir}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 29 13:17:56 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 2.10.24
  - Core:
    - Ignore Pentax and PentaxDng metadata at export because they are
      unsupported.
    - DBus calls (remote file open, typically with double click on file
      browser; and remote command run) are now processed after all command
      line files (in case of calls during startup) and in the call order
      (FIFO) for consistency. Some timeout has also been added to not spam
      the core process with non-processable DBus calls during startup.
    - Display profile name in "Color space" field of Image Properties and
      improve ellipsis & wrap on dialog fields whose contents' size is not
      controllable together with better dialog size management.
    - Fix stack overflow when loading very large XCF files on Windows.
    - Point snapping now works outside the canvas. This is used for snap
      to guides, grid and vectors. Snap to grid only works off-canvas when
      "Show All" is enabled because off-canvas grid is not visible
      otherwise, though snap to guide and vectors will always work
      off-canvas.
  - Libgimp:
    - Various metadata improvements:
      * Improve reading of iptc tags that appear more than once.
  - Plug-ins:
    - JPEG export will better advertize when metadata export fails,
      possibly with relevant error message. Image export would not fail,
      but at least we make the person aware metadata is not properly
      exported.
    - More robust TIFF import and export:
      * Better handling of Exif.Thumbnail.* tags on export.
      * Import now ignores TIFF pages with invalid directory (rather than
        freezing and output an error to warn of possible data loss).
      * Import attempts to count the directories by reading them when the
        headers does not announce any directory, which allows to salvage
        images with improper header. Also if reading of a directory fail,
        we now output a message to warn of possible data loss.
      * Fixed loading 2 and 4-bit TIFF images in grayscale and indexed.
      * Improve support of ExtraSamples fields with non-conformant TIFF
        files.
      * Improve loading of multi page tiffs with linear TRC.
      * More safety checks as a result of fuzz-testing.
      * Improve loading of MinIsWhite and MinIsBlack images.
    - GeoTIFF tag support added (recognized and stored into image
      parasites at import, then exported back when TIFF format is used)
      with appropriate "Save GeoTIFF data" checkbox (checked by default)
      to disable GeoTIFF metadata export when not desired.
    - The metadata viewer and editor got a big cleaning and refactoring
      pass, as well as various fixes and several improvements:
      * Fix handling of IPTC tags which can appear more than once (such as
        "Keywords") in both the viewer and editor.
      * Always read both the IPTC and XMP equivalent tags in the editor,
        instead of assuming they are necessarily the same.
      * More IPTC equivalents of XMP tags added:
        + Iptc.Application2.LocationName <=> Xmp.iptc.Location
        + Iptc.Application2.BylineTitle <=> Xmp.photoshop.AuthorsPosition
        + Iptc.Application2.CountryCode <=> Xmp.iptc.CountryCode
        + Iptc.Application2.Writer <=> Xmp.photoshop.CaptionWriter
      * The editor now properly saves IPTC tags.
      * Improve UTF-8 conversion to avoid double string conversion (hence
        actually breaking encoding).
      * Use proper unit abbreviations and proper label casing.
      * GPS data is now properly formatted with better precision and with
        translatable string parts and tooltips are added to explain how to
        correctly edit GPS data (latitude, longitude, altitude).
        Also seconds part of latitude/longitude is now saved with more
        precision and altitude details now switch from .1m to .10m.
      * Better error reporting when the editor fails to write a tag, with
        proper GUI error, so that such error do not go unseen.
      * Better error handling when closing the editor or viewer too, and
        improve error handling when the calendar dialog fails.
      * Use a logging domain for debugging-only messages which pollutes
        the output.
      * Xmp.iptc.CreatorContactInfo/Iptc4xmpCore:* override the shorter
        forms Xmp.iptc.Ci* if both are present, since the longer form is
        more common.
      * Improve saving of XMP metadata.
      * And more bug fixes and refactoring steps to get rid of duplicate
        code.
    - PNG will now prompt only for layer offset different from zero. Some
      software were always setting an offset of 0 (e.g.: POV-Ray v3.7) so
      GIMP would unecessarily prompt the user until now for PNG created by
      such software.
    - BMP:
      * allow loading of BMP images with incorrect BI_BITFIELDS
        compression.
      * support loading more bit depth such as 24bpp images.
    - file-darktable:
      * support updated Lua API of darktable 3.6 and beyond;
      * Adding environment contents to debugging output when
        DARKTABLE_DEBUG env variable is set.
    - PDF import:
      * New option to reverse order of layer.
      * Support fractional DPI (allowing accurate page dimensions).
    - DDS:
      * Set blue channel of BC5 dds images to 0 instead of 255.
      * Fix DDS BC5 compression/decompression with Red and Blue swapped.
        We detect images created by an older GIMP on loading and swap the
        channels back.
    - HEIF:
      * Removes the "HDR" mention on HEIF 10/12-bit export because high
        bit depth does not necessarily means HDR.
      * Runtime detection of HEIC and AVIF file formats (depending on
        available encoders and decoders), which allows afterwards update
        of the dependency, but also allows usage for a single format (e.g.
        for distributions which want to support only AVIF).
      * With libheif 1.10, visually lossless export is possible for
        10/12 bit depths too
    - PSD:
      * More flexible reading of layer mask record size, skipping invalid
        or unsupported mask info size, hence allowing us to load more PSD
        files (at least the part of a PSD we support instead of failing
        the whole import altogether).
    - G3 fax images:
      * Improve error handling when loading.
      * Be more forgiving on bad lines which were quite frequent on older
        fax images, allowing to salvage some old images.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  6 02:29:41 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 2.10.22:
  - Core:
    - Verbose version information (`gimp-2.10 -v` on command line,
      or debug output) now displays Flatpak related information
      when available. This is especially useful for debugging (such
      as the exact Flatpak build hash, the runtime version, the
      installed Flatpak extensions, permissions, etc.).
    - OpenCL settings has now been moved to the Playground tab in
      Preferences.
    - On stable builds, "Playground" tab is now visible in
      Preferences if any of the experimental features has been
      enabled, even without the CLI option `--show-playground`.
  - Tools:
    - "gegl:matting-levin" now the default engine of Foreground
      Select tool (when present, as it is an optional feature) as
      it performs a lot better.
    - GEGL operations now display a "Sample merged" checkbox in
      Tool Options. This will be used when the operation allows to
      pick a color (hence one can pick from the edited layer or
      from visible data).
    - "Sample merged" now defaults to being activated in Color
      Picker and GEGL tools as it seems the less confusing for
      beginners who don't know of the option yet (according to a
      small poll we ran).
  - User interface:
    - In GimpSpinButton, don't propagate Enter key-press events if
      updating the spin-button's value in response changes the
      entered text. This prevents confirming dialogs when hitting
      Enter after entering a math expression in size entries,
      updating their value instead.  Likewise, don't propagate
      Escape key-press events if a new value was entered, and
      restore the original value instead.
    - GimpMemSizeEntry improved to show appropriate binary prefixes
      (kibibyte, mebibyte and gibibyte) instead of decimal ones, to
      round properly when using higher units, and to not lose
      accuracy when possible when displaying in higher units.
    - Several of the biggest pages of the Preferences dialog are
      now scrollable, allowing the dialog to fit on smaller
      displays.
  - Plug-ins:
    - Add a new GIMP_EXPORT_NEEDS_CROP export capability, which
      causes gimp_export_image() to crop the exported image content
      to the image bounds; this is useful for formats that support
      layers, but have no concept of global image bounds, hence
      cropping is the only way to enforce the image bounds.  When
      showing the export dialog, give an option to either crop the
      layers to the image bounds, or to resize the image to fit the
      layers.
    - Content type `image/webp` is now recognized (and not only
      `image/x-webp` as both seem to be in used and this format is
      unfortunately not yet listed in IANA media types (so various
      content types are in use, no clear standard apparently).
    - DDS import is now a bit more permissive, allowing to load
      some files with invalid header flags regarding compression,
      while we are able to know the right compression from other
      flags. This allows to recover invalid DDS files exported by
      other software.
    - JPEG detection improved to be more generic and reliable.
    - HEIF support improvements:
      - AVIF importing and exporting added (requires libheif
        1.8.0+)
      - 10/12-bit importing and exporting now available for
        HEIC/AVIF
      - NCLX color profile import (link with LittleCMS)
      - Metadata support when importing
      - "Lossless" option is now called "Nearly lossless (YUV420
        format)" because this is actually what it is, hence
        previous naming was misleading.
    - TIFF support improvements:
      - Add an option to crop the layers to the image bounds when
        exporting individual layers (using GIMP_EXPORT_NEEDS_CROP),
        since TIFF has no concept of global image bounds otherwise.
        Cropping is enabled by default.
      - TIFF export will not override "DocumentName" metadata tag
        anymore.
      - Stop writing file paths into TIFF DocumentNames as file
        paths can contain confidential information such as
        usernames and directory structures, making the previous
        behaviour a potential privacy and security risk.
      - Fix a file descriptor leak case which may have prevented a
        file from being opened on Windows.
    - Multiple improvements in the PSP import plug-in:
      - support reading raster layers of PSP version > 6,
      - support reading 16-bit integer PSP files,
      - support reading grayscale and indexed PSP files,
      - support PSP images with zero-length layer names,
      - fix wrong layer offset of layers,
      - fix reading layer names with high bit ASCII characters,
      - fix incorrect loading of PSP images with uncompressed
        channel data,
      - fix reading of creator block data of PSP images,
      - better error messages describing yet unsupported features,
      - improve reader stability by always using the block/chunk
        length.
    - Spyrogimp now works on Grayscale images and clutters less the
      undo history.
    - "Orientation" metadata is now reset whether you accepted to
      rotate the image or not when importing an image.
    - XPM does not export a "None" (transparent) color when unused.
    - BMP always include color masks when exporting BMP with color
      space info, as mandated by BITMAPV5HEADER specification.
  - Debugging:
    - Add progressive performance logs: progressive logs contain
      complete information after each recorded sample, by writing
      partial address maps at each sample, containing all new
      addresses introduced by the sample.  This allows recording
      complete logs even in cases where they can't be properly
      terminated, such as when GIMP crashes or freezes in the
      middle of the log.  Progressive logs are disabled by default,
      since they potentially increase the sampling cost. They can
      be enabled through a toggle in the log file-dialog, or
      through GIMP_PERFORMANCE_LOG_PROGRESSIVE environment
      variable.  Performance log viewer can now process progressive
      performance logs too.
    - Allow controlling performance-log parameters through the UI.

Mon Feb 24 22:40:45 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 2.10.18:
  https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/02/24/gimp-2-10-18-released/
  - Core:
    - In gimp:replace, when compositing the same content over itself,
      i.e., when the input and aux buffers share the same storage and
      same tile alignment, pass the input buffer directly as output,
      instead of doing actual processing. In particular, this happens
      when processing a pass-through group outside of its actual bounds.
    - In gimp_gegl_apply_cached_operation(), use gint64 for storing the
      total and processed pixel counts used for reporting progress, to
      avoid overflowing when applying an operation to a large image.
    - In GimpFilterTool and gimp_drawable_apply_operation(), use
      gimp_drawable_filter_set_add_alpha() to add an alpha channel when
      applying an operation that specifies "needs-alpha" to a drawable
      that can have alpha.
    - In GimpFilterTool, move all the drawable-filter option setup to a
      new gimp_filter_tool_update_filter() function, and call it
      whenever the drawable-filter's options need to be updated. This
      avoids duplicating logic in various places.
    - Improve the efficiency of decoding RLE data when loading ABR
      brushes, by reading entire scanlines into a buffer all-at-once,
      instead of reading the stream byte-by-byte.
    - GIMP now optionally phones home to find out if there's a new
      version available and then tells the user if there is one indeed.
      It also keeps track of the installer revision and then warns if
      there's a newer installer available. This can be disabled in
      Preferences. In that case, users still have the option to manually
      check for an update via the About dialog. The feature can be
      disabled entirely with the '--disable-check-update' configure
      switch.
  - Tools:
    - New 3D Transform tool where you can set vanishing point, camera's
      focal length, and the move and rotate layer, selection, path, or
      image in 2.5 space. With the "Unified interaction" option enabled,
      all three interaction modes of the grid (camera, move, and rotate)
      are available simultaneously. In this mode, the inner and outer
      regions of the item are used for moving and rotation,
      respectively, and the vanishing point is controlled through
      through a handle.
    - Transform tools now respect the Clip option and update the canvas
      preview accordingly.
    - New "Composited preview" option allows respecting layer's blending
      mode and position in the layer stack rather than rendering it as
      an overlay on top of the overall layer stack. This simplifies
      creating complex layer compositions greatly. The option requires
      mipmaps to be used and thus is disabled by default. It also comes
      with an experimental "Synchronous preview" suboption to render the
      composited preview synchronously. This reduces the lag for
      painting the preview, but can harm responsiveness for bigger
      images, where rendering the preview is slow.
    - Add a new "Preview linked items" option to the transform-grid
      tools. When this option is enabled, together with composited
      previews, the transform preview includes all linked layers and
      channels when transforming a layer/channel. Paths are currently
      unsupported.
    - New widget called GimpPivotSelector, a 3x3 grid of toggle buttons,
      is now used for selecting a natural pivot position (e.g. for a
      transform) relative to an item: its center, its corners, and the
      midpoints of its edges. Currently used in Rotate and 3D Transform
      tools.
    - Add "Show all" support to the Bucket Fill tool in line-art mode
    - Color picker and sample points now support displaying vlaues in
      Yu'v' (CIE 1976 UCS) color space.
    - The Symmetry Painting dock now has an "Enable reflection" option
      that allows painting patterns resembling a kaleidoscope.
    - Transform clipping is temporarily disabled for layer groups. No
      preview other than 'Adjust' works anyway. This will be fixed later
      on.
    - Construct a box-filtered mipmap hierarchy for the original brush
      on-demand, and the closest mipmap is used as the resampling source
      for downscaled brushes, significantly improving the output
      quality.
    - Now that painting is done in a separate thread, the display update
      rate has a far smaller impact on it. Increase the GimpDisplay
      update rate, which handles image updates, to 60 FPS, and the
      GimpDrawTool update rate to 120 FPS. In particular, the latter
      change makes the brush outline motion much smoother.
    - In the Airbrush tool, increase the maximal stamp FPS from 15 to
      60, and change the corresponding maximal Rate value from 150 to
      100. This technically affects tool presets, but we'll live.
    - Add a new "Snap brush outline to stroke" toggle to the "Image
      Windows" preferences page. When enabled, the brush outline in
      paint tools snaps to the individual dabs while painting, which is
      how it worked before version 2.10.16. Disable the option by
      default.  This seems to be what most other programs are doing, and
      it does give paitning a smoother feel.
    - The Warp Transform tool now respects settings for painting tools:
      showing the brush outline, snapping to dabs, and showing the paint
      tool cursor.
  - User interface:
    - Add new Symbolic-High-Contrast and Symbolic-Inverted-High-Contrast
      themes, which are automatically-generated high-contrast variants
      of the (original) Symbolic theme.  The contrast factor is settable
      in the makefile, and is currently at 1.5 for both themes.
      
    - Rename tools/invert-svg to tools/svg-contrast, which now takes a
      contrast-factor argument, and adjusts the input SVG contrast,
      instead of just inverting it.  Note that we can still use the tool
      to invert icons, using a contrast of -1.
    - Allow horizontal scrollbars in all the Preferences dialog tree-
      views, so that they don't limit the minimal width of the dialog
      (in particular, the UI- and icon-theme tree-views may contain
      arbitrarily-long paths).
    - Draw a border around the color FG/BG color areas as a pair of
      black and white rectangles instead of letting GTK do this. This
      imporoves the legibility of borders, especially in dark themes.
    - Tools are now logically grouped in the toolbox by default. Users
      can customize the groups to their liking or disable this feature
      altogether in the Preferences dialog (Interface / Toolbox page).
    - New opt-out compact style for sliders with revamped interaction.
      The widget uses a narrower layout, and the different
      upper/lower-half behavior is gone. Instead, the behavior depends
      on the mouse button and modifier used:
      - left-click is used for absolute adjustment,
      - Shift + left-click + drag changes value in small increments,
      - Ctrl + left-click + drag changes value in large increments,
      - middle-click enables numeric input mode;
      - right-click enables numeric input mode and selects the value.
    - The "You can drop dockable dialogs here" message is gone from the
      toolbox for good. Instead, highlight dockable areas when a user
      starts dragging a dockable dialog, and intensify the highlight as
      the dialog goes over a dockable area.
    - Consolidate UI for merging down and anchoring layers: As they are
      both mutually exclusive and serve an almost identical purpose, the
      "Merge down" and "Anchor Layer" are given mutually exclusive
      visibility in menus, and the anchor button is replaced with a
      merge down button in the Layers dockable whenever there is no
      active floating selection. Modifier keys are available:
      - Shift: merge layer group
      - Ctrl: merge visible layers
      - Ctrl + Shift: merge visible layers from last used values
  - Tools:
    - In GimpPaintTool, when not snapping brush outline to stroke, make
      sure to properly snap the cursor position to 15-degree angle
      multiples in line mode, not only when painting the line, but also
      during motion.
  - Plug-ins:
    - Add naive support for CMYK 8-bit PSD files
    - In plug_in_compat.pdb, when wrapping an op node inside a graph,
      set the op node as the graph node's underlying operation. This
      allows gimp_gegl_apply_operation() to perform certain
      optimizations.
    - The Spyrogimp plugin now features a Visual tab where the inner
      mechanics of a spirograph is abstracted away, and you operate on
      amount of petals etc. The plugin now also allows saving a pattern
      as a path rather than rendering it to a layer as a bitmap.
    - Improve the loading speed for PSD files, mostly by eliminating
      excessive copies.
  - Filters:
    - Don't disable gegl:color-to-alpha (which has "needs-alpha") when
      the drawable doesn't have an alpha channel, if one can be added.
    - Don't disable color-to-alpha for grayscale drawable, since the
      operation is applicable to grayscale images (in particular, it
      doesn't add color where there was none), and since GIMP no longer
      distinguishes between layers and channels according to the
      drawable format when updating the filters actions.
  - Updated translations

- Update to version 2.10.14:
  https://www.gimp.org/news/2019/10/31/gimp-2-10-14-released/
  + Core:
    - New "Selected areas continue outside the image" toggle option
      to the "Feather Selection" dialog.
    - New "Allow editing on non-visible layers" setting in
      Preferences to allow painting, transforming, and selecting on
      layers with toggled off visibility.
    - XCF loading a bit more resilient to corruption: it doesn't
      stop any more at the first layer or channel error; instead it
      tries to load more layers/channels to salvage as much data as
      possible from a corrupted XCF file.
    - In gimp:gradient, fix dithering to correspond to how we
      actually round float values to 8-bit. In particular, this
      avoids introducing noise when a component is fixed at 0 or 1
      along a segment.
    - New "Show All" view mode allowing to show pixels outside the
      canvas boundary.
    - New "Show Canvas Boundary" option to render a dotted line
      around the canvas boundary.
    - New "Keep Padding in "Show All" Mode" option, also available
      as a default option via Preferences, to preserve the padding
      color instead of displaying the checkerboard.
    - Several features updated to react as expected when run
      out-of-canvas: color-picking, canvas grid, transform tools,
      bucket fill, and more.
    - Loaded images' pixel density will now default to 72 PPI when
      no explicit resolution information was stored in the imported
      file.  Newly created images' default pixel density will
      continue to be based on the default image template (with
      value 300 PPI if it has not be changed), yet not loaded
      images anymore. 72 PPI is the common default in most software
      (and in standards such as Exif) so it makes sense we stick to
      it, only for loaded images.
  + Tools:
    - Free Select tool: fast copy|cut-paste modifiers (Alt +
      Ctrl|Shift) are now working even when the selection is not
      committed. Starting a fast copy|cut-paste will automatically
      close the polygon and commit the selection, accelerating fast
      usage of free selections.
    - Foreground Select tool: new "Grayscale" Preview Mode. Also, a
      color selector for "Color" preview (original preview mode)
      now available, to select any color and opacity for the
      preview.
    - Add a new "Image" transform type to the transform tools, in
      addition to the existing "Layer", "Selection", and "Path"
      transform types.  The "Image" mode transforms the entire
      image, rather than a single item. In tools with a preview,
      the preview shows the transformed image projection.  The
      clipping mode controls how the canvas is clipped during the
      transform; in particular, the ADJUST clipping mode resizes
      the canvas to fit its transformed size.
    - In GimpFilterTool, add a new "clipping" option, which can be
      either Adjust or Clip.  This option is controllable for
      layers, when there's no selection mask.  When set to Adjust,
      which is used by default, the filter's output may extent past
      the drawable's boundary, and the drawable will be resized to
      match the output when committed.
    - Gradient tool: offest support in shaped gradients
  + Plug-ins:
    - Simple 8-bit port of filters to GEGL: nl-filter, film,
      fractal-explorer, flame, blinds, jigsaw, gradient-flare,
      checkerboard, tile-small, curve-bend, sample-colorize,
      map-object, lighting, grid, despeckle, sphere-designer,
      contrast-retinex, hot, sparkle, cml-explorer, destripe,
      twain, animation-optimize, depth-merge, warp, imagemap,
      gimpressionist
    - Port of filters to GEGL with float support: van-gogh-lic.
    - Add color profile support for HEIF (only when libheif 1.4.0
      is available).
    - TIFF import will now ask (in interactive mode) how to process
      unspecified TIFF channels: non-premultiplied (used to be the
      default) alpha, premultiplied alpha, or just import as
      generic channel.
    - HEIF export now improved with same profile logics as JPEG or
      WebP (it can actually export higher bit-depth data, so
      profile logics should be the one as in PNG, but we only
      support 8 bpc HEIF for the time being).
    - HEIF export dialog now has a "Save color profile" checkbox
      allowing to not export with a profile when needed (needs
      libheif 1.4.0 or higher).
    - PDF exporting: text layers in layer groups are now exported
      as proper text.
    - Cleaned up the file-dds GUI, removed the "Advanced" expander.
    - gimptool external tool now install plug-ins into subfolders
      (this is not mandatory in GIMP 2.10 yet, unlike future GIMP
      3, but is already the recommended folder structure for
      plug-ins).
    - 3 procedures ("color-decode-ycocg",
      "color-decode-ycocg-scaled" and "color-decode-alpha-exp")
      removed from file-dds plug-in because they are hacks which
      should stay internal to the plug-in and are semantically wrong
      because colors in drawables are never in such formats.
  + Filters:
    - New "Normal Map" filter to generate normal maps from height
      maps in the Generic section.
    - Replace old filters with GEGL operation counterparts:
      edge-neon (gegl:edge-neon), contrast-normalize
      (gegl:stretch-contrast), oilify (gegl:oilify)
    - Add gegl:bayer-matrix and gegl:linear-sinusoid to Filters ->
      Render -> Pattern.
    - Add gegl:newsprint to Filters -> Distorts.
    - Add gegl:mean-curvature-blur to Filters -> Blur.
  + Performance:
    - Add an active-thread variable to the dashboard's misc group,
      showing the number of active worker threads.
    - Reduce time complexity of layer-group translation. When
      translating a layer group, avoid separately updating the
      original area of the child layers before translating them (as
      per the fix to issue #3484), as this results in quadratic
      time complexity w.r.t. to the maximal subgroup nesting level.
      Instead, simply defer the updating of the group's offset
      until *after* translating the child layers, so that their
      original area isn't clipped by the parent, while their new
      area is still properly updated even if the parent's size
      changes.
  + User interface:
    - Many mnemonics added in various dialogs.
    - Add a gimp-rotate-image-arbitrary action, and a corresponding
      "Image -> Transform -> Arbitrary Rotation..." menu entry,
      which activates the rotate tool in image mode (similarly to
      the corresponding action for layers).
    - On Windows, minimized GIMP window is now deiconified when
      GIMP is run again (clicking its shortcut or otherwise).
  + Preferences:
    - New "Swap compression" option: explicit control over the
      tile-swap compression algorithm in GEGL. "Best performance"
      is used by default, "Balanced", "Best compression", and
      "None" (disables compression) are available.
  + Devel docs:
    - Update the libgimpconfig and libgimpbase docs.
    - Update docs with missing symbols and types.
    - New docs for structs and enums.
  + Debugging:
    - New mnemonic-clashes tool to help looking for mnemonic
      clashes.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 15 17:24:43 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.10.12:
  + Core:
    - Add an "Incremental" option to the Dodge/Burn tool, which,
      similarly to the Paintbrush, Pencil, and Eraser tools,
      applies the effect incrementally as the pointer moves.
    - Curves now have a concept of smooth vs corner points: smooth
      points produce a smooth curve, while corner points produce a
      sharp curve (previously, all points were smooth).
    - Search the user font directory path on Windows (since Windows
      10, non-admin users have the ability to install fonts). This
      is only a temporary hack until fontconfig adds proper
      upstream support.
    - In gimp_brush_core_get_paint_buffer(), when allocating a new
      paint buffer, clear the old buffer *before* allocating the
      new one, to reduce the amount of simultaneously allocated
      memory.
    - In GimpPaintbrush, avoid refilling the paint buffer at each
      dab if the paint color/pixmap hasn't changed, hence allowing
      faster painting in some specific cases.
    - Add hygon cpu detection and enable MMX/SSE support.
    - Add a GimpSymmetry::get_transform() virtual function and a
      corresponding gimp_symmetry_get_transform() function which
      return the brush transform corresponding to a given symmetry
      stroke in terms of the rotation angle and reflection flag (in
      contrast to gimp_symmetry_get_operation() which returns the
      same transforation in terms of a GeglNode). This allows us to
      simplify, fix (artifact bugs, etc.), and improve the
      painting-code performance for several symmetry painting
      cases.
    - New gimp-brush-pipe-spacing parasite set by core code to
      preserve GIH brush's spacing across reloads.
    - Add a new Offset filter tool, as a front-end to gimp:offset.
      The tool replaces, and provides the same interface as the
      drawable-offset dialog while also providing live preview and
      on-canvas interaction.
  + Plug-ins:
    - Exported profile and data format strategy updated in several
      file plug-ins.
    - When not saving a profile, we always export as sRGB data, as
      most viewers would not display the image properly otherwise.
    - When saving a profile:
      . If a profile was manually assigned, we always export to the
        assigned format, hence pixel data is converted accordingly,
        whatever the work format.
    - If no profile was assigned:
      . If the export format support high-bit depth, we export the
        work format as-is.
      . If the export format is 8-bit max, we convert the work
        format to sRGB, except if the work format is 8-bit linear.
  + The following plug-ins were updated: JPEG, PNG, TIFF and WebP.
  + Tools:
    - Add input/output spin-buttons to the Curves tool, which allow
      setting the selected point's coordinates numerically. When
      the image precision is greater than 8-bpc, use a 0.00-100.00
      range for the point-coordinate spin-buttons instead of a
      0-255 range.
    - In the Curves tool, allow changing the curve's point types
      (cf. new curve corner points in Core section). Corner points
      are displayed with a diamond shape instead of a circle.
    - Free Select tool now creates a selection as soon as the
      polygon is closed. This selection is updated when the
      polygon, or the relevant tool-options, change, similarly to
      GimpRectangleSelectTool.
    - Derive GimpEraser from GimpPaintbrush, instead of directly
      from GimpBrushCore. This allows GimpEraser to reuse the
      paint-buffer content across dabs, improving performance.
    - Allow moving an intersecting pair of guides with the Move tool.
  + User interface:
    - In GimpCurveView, when dragging an existing curve point,
      don't immediately move the point to the cursor position upon
      button press, but rather move it relative to its current
      position as the cursor moves. This allows selecting a point
      without moving it, and adjusting its position more easily.
    - When the cursor hovers above a point in GimpCurveView, or
      when dragging a point, have the coordinate indicator show the
      point's position, rather than the cursor's.
    - In GimpCurveView, when holding down Ctrl while
      adding/dragging a point, snap the y-coordinate to the
      original curve (at the start of the drag). This is
      particularly useful for adding points along the curve.
    - In GimpDashboard, don't show legend for groups with no meter.
    - Add a tile-alloc-total variable to the dashboard's memory and
      misc groups, showing the total amount of memory used by the
      tile allocator.
    - Add a "Save Keyboard Shortcuts Now" button to the Configure
      Keyboard Shortcuts dialog.
  + Updated translations.

  pkgconfig(glib-2.0) >= 2.54.2 is enough.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  7 23:28:13 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 2.10.10:
  - Core:
    - Add gimp-scratch allocator, a fast memory allocator (on the
      order of magnitude of alloca()), suitable for small (up to a
      few megabytes), short-lived (usually, bound to the current
      stack-frame) allocations.  Unlike alloca(), gimp-scratch
      doesn't use the stack, and is therefore safer, and will also
      serve bigger requests, by falling-back to malloc().
    - In gimp_drawable_transform_buffer_affine(), avoid modifying
      the clipping mode when transforming layer masks, since this
      function is used (among other things) to transform layer
      masks together with their layer, in which case they should
      use the same clipping mode as the layer. This fixes a
      regression introduced by commit 2ae823ba, causing layer masks
      to be transformed with a mismatched clipping mode during
      layer transforms, leading to discrepencies between the
      transformed layer and the transformed mask.
    - Moved swap/cache and temporary files out the GIMP user config
      dir and added new config file substitutions ${gimp_cache_dir}
      and ${gimp_temp_dir}.
    - Pass the GEGL tile-cache size, swap path, and thread-count to
      plug-ins as part of their config, and have libgimp set the
      plug-in's GeglConfig accordingly upon initialization.
    - Layer groups are now rendered in bigger chunks rather than
      tile-by-tile (which used to pretty much eliminate
      multithreading for groups), which improves the rendering
      speed.
    - Make saving/exporting files more robust to errors. In
      particular if an error occurs during the process (be it a
      bug, a memory error, or anything else), GIMP won't overwrite
      anymore any existing file with incomplete contents, so that
      you won't end up with no valid files at all.
    - Fix a regression on support of various graphics tablet.
    - Remove the "Edit -> Fade..." feature: it makes GIMP use two
      buffers instead of one (east into system resources), it's
      broken in 2.10, and we can make the UX better for filters.
    - New generic canvas modifier 'Alt + middle click' allowing to
      pick layers by clicking on pixels. The available layers will
      be looped through (starting from the upper one) while Alt key
      is hold and the picked layer name will be temporarily
      displayed in the status bar.
    - When clearing a channel, do nothing if the channel is already
      empty; otherwise, align the cleared rectangle to the channel
      buffer's tile grid, so that all affected tiles are dropped,
      rather than zeroed.  Furthermore, only update the affected
      region of the channel.
    - Brush and pattern saving logics has been moved to core code
      (instead of plug-in).
    - Clipboard brushes and pattern can now be duplicated.
    - Parametric brushes are now 32-bit float to avoid
      posterization on large brushes.  Note: raster brushes are
      still 8-bit and plug-ins only have access to 8-bit versions
      of high-precision brushes/patterns. New API will be required
      to handle high-precision data.
    - On-canvas preview while editing a color in the colormap of an
      indexed image.
  - User interface:
    - Enabled HiDPI/Retina support for the GTK2/OSX build, fixes
      blurry icons. 
    - Add a tooltip to the "better compression" checkbox in save
      dialog to make it clearer it does not mean that the file size
      is necessarily smaller in every cases. In particular some
      best/worst case are possible when an algorithm less efficient
      in general may end up better on a particular image.
    - Add basic support for cursors with a scale factor of 2 for
      HiDPI (artwork to be updated).
    - Foreground and background color icons, as well as color
      history will now display out-of-gamut warning on indexed
      images for colors outside of the palette, as well as on
      grayscale images, for non-gray colors.
    - Pack color picker and hexadecimal entry on same line in Color
      dock.
    - Add an "Open as Image" button to the brushes dialog.
  - Usability:
    - Attempting to transform locked layers or paint on them now
      results in blinking around the status bar (where the warning
      message is displayed) and around the toolbar where lock
      toggles are. The same applies to attempting to move a
      selection where there is none — GIMP will blink around the
      toolbar where the moving target (layer, selection, path) is
      chosen.
    - GIMP now allows selecting default export file type for new
      projects.  The choice is limited to PNG, JPEG, WebP, PSD,
      ORA, TIFF, BMP.
    - GimpSpinScale widget now has an optional feature to constrain
      the value to integer when dragging with a pointer (even if
      the scale allows for fractional numbers), set with new
      function gimp_spin_scale_set_constrain_drag().  This is
      useful for settings where fractional numbers are technically
      possible, yet most common use case are with integers (such as
      pixel sizes, angles in degrees, etc.) so you want the easy
      interface to be constrained. Fractional numbers are still
      settable, for instance by keyboard edit; and arrow
      incrementation won't drop fraction parts.  This is currently
      only activated for brush options in paint tools.
  - Tools:
    - In scale tool, scale around center even when using numeric
      input.
    - New algorithm in the Bucket Fill tool when selecting the
      affected area "Fill by line art detection", based off the
      G'Mic algorithm for "smart colorization":
      https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01891876 In a few words,
      it identifies painted pixels (either based on grayscale or
      opacity values) and tries to close line arts to allow filling
      even with not perfectly closed zones; the second step of the
      algorithm will flood the colors under line art pixels to
      prevent "holes" in the filling.  It is possible to control a
      max size (in pixels) for the flooding, as well as max length
      of closing segments and splines.
    - The Bucket Fill tool got new interaction allowing to hold the
      click and move the mouse to fill based on several seed zones
      (for "Fill by line art detection" as well as "Fill similar
      colors"). You can now cancel the fill in progress with right
      click as in other tools.
    - The Bucket Fill tool now allows color picking with
      ctrl-click, same as every painting tool. It will pick either
      the foreground or background color depending on the selected
      Fill Type. The ctrl-alt modifier combination is also possible
      to pick the non-Fill Type color.
    - In the Bucket Fill tool, the Alt modifier will now switch to
      "FG color fill" when "Pattern fill" was set (instead of doing
      nothing).
    - In the Unified Transform tool, default to preserving aspect
      ratio when scaling up or down.
    - In the Healing tool, "Sample merged" now also work for the
      target pixels, allowing to draw in empty layers.
    - Selection by color is now parallelized, hence improving speed
      of the Select by Color tool (and any other processing which
      may share this piece of code now or in the future).
    - Add "Constrain handles" and "Around center" options to the
      perspective-transform tool's GUI, which are similar to the
      corresponding options of the unified-transform tool.
    - Improve color picking on indexed image to always select an
      indexed color corresponding to the picked pixel in the
      colormap.
  - Plug-ins:
    - file-pdf-save GUI now clearly indicates the order the layers
      will be used to make multi-page PDFs.
    - Add DDS loading/exporting plug-in originally developed by
      Shawn Kirst and Arne Reuter.
    - Rename the Guillotine plug-in to Slice Using Guides.
    - Add a new option saving a color profile when exporting PNG,
      JPEG, TIFF.  Always save it when exporting to PSD.
    - Remove the "Advanced" expanders from the PNG and TIFF export
      dialogs.
    - Full rewrite of the Spyrogimp plug-in with much more options
      and better interaction.
    - Indexed TIFF with alpha channel now supported.
  - Filters:
    - Add on-canvas GUI (simple lines) for circular, linear, and
      zoom motion blur.
  - Help:
    - Link to the bugtracker directly from the Help menu, also link
      to the wiki and the roadmap. Remove the link to currently
      disabled registry.gimp.org.
  - Translations:
    - Czech, Danish, French, Italian, Japanese, Marathi, Polish,
      Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian.

Fri Nov 09 06:33:32 UTC 2018 - sean@suspend.net

- Update to vesion 2.10.8:
  +Core:
  - Use adaptive chunk size in GimpProjectio nwhen rendering the
    projection asynchronously, rather than using a fixed chunk size.
    This provides a better trade-off between throughput and
    responsiveness dynamically, based on how fast the processing is.
  +Tools:
  - In all selection tools, show error on attempt to
    subtract-from/intersect-with empty selection.
  - Fix text along path not working with vertical text.
  - Fix Text tool's frame position when undoing a move operation.
  - Streamline Text tool's drawing blocking/unblocking logic.
  - When moving a text layer using the text tool (through alt-drag),
    don't change the layer's box mode to "fixed", which is unnecessary,
    since the layer's size isn't affected.
  - Transform and deformation operations now maintain color for fully
    transparent pixels, making unerase and curves manipulation of alpha
    channel more reliable.
  - All transform tools now apply changes when you asve or export/overwrite
    an image without pressing Enter first to confirm changes.
  - Heal, Dodge/Burn, Smudge and Convovle tools now adjust the processed
    buffer and mask_buffer regions according to the changes made to the 
    application region, as calculated by intersecting it with the 
    drawable and mask extents. This fixes wrong application position
    when painting on a drawable whose origin is above/to the left of the
    image's origin, and there's a selection active.
  +Plug-ins:
  - Port all plug-ins to the new iterator API in GEGL.
  - Improve automatic detection of HEIC/HEIF files.
  - Improve RawTherapee discovery by looking up registry key (should
    become useful with RawTherapee 5.5 and more). 
  +Usability:
  - Compatibility information in the Save dialog is now more understandable.
    The minimum GIMP version for the XCD file is always written down when it
    is GIMP 2.8 or over. The list of features warranting the minimum version
    is now listed in an expander container rather than as tooltip, which
    makes it more discoverable. The warning on compression is now displayed
    as its own text under the checkbox and not as additional text to the minimum    GIMP version label.
  +CLI:
   - New self-explanatory --enable-win32-debug-console CLI option
  +Translations:
   - Updated translations: Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Hungarian,
     Italian, Polish, Portugese (Brazil), Spanish, Swedish, Ukranian.

Mon Sep 17 07:59:13 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- pkgconfig(glib-2.0) >= 2.56.0 is needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 23 20:33:37 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.10.6:
  + Core:
    - Render drawable previews asynchronously.
    - Merge the file view filter and file format lists in
      GimpFileDialog. The presence of 2 lists was very confusing.
    - DLL search priority is now updated before running a plug-in
      on Windows, depending on the executable bitness. This gets
      rid of one of the last remnant of DLL hell in GIMP, which was
      when running 32-bit plug-ins from a 64-bit build of GIMP.
  + Filters:
    - New "Little Planet" (gegl:stereographic-projection) filter.
    - New "Long Shadow" (gegl:long-shadow) filter.
  + Tools:
    - Halt the Measure tool after straightening.
    - Add an "orientation" option to the measure tool,
      corresponding to the "orientation" property of
      GimpToolCompass (i.e., it controls the orientation against
      which the angle is measured, when not in 3-point mode.) The
      orientation is "auto" by default, so that the angle is always
      <= 45 deg.  Note that the "orientation" option affects the
      tool's "straighten" function, so that the layer is rotated
      toward the current orientation.
    - Text layers can now represent vertical texts, with 4
      variants: left-to-right and right-to-left lines, and forcing
      all characters to be upright or following Unicode's vertical
      orientation property. See also:
      https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr50/
      http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/VerticalOrientation.txt
  + User Interface:
    - The Dashboard dockable dialog now has an "async" field to the
      dashboard's "misc" group, showing the number of async
      operations currently in the "running" state.
    - New Preferences option to enable/disable layer-group
      previews, since these can get quite time-expensive.

Thu Jul  5 16:47:10 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.10.4 bug fix release
  Core:
  - Remove gimp_display_shell_draw_background() and all clipping
    hacks for drawing the canvas background. This optimizes away
    one entire step of drawing of image size, for each expose.
  - Font loading does not block startup anymore. Only consequence
    is that the Text tool may not be usable immediately if fonts
    are not fully loaded yet (and will output an appropriate error
    if you do so). All non-text related activities can be performed
      right away.
  - Change of the URL from bugzilla to gitlab where appropriate.
  - New tool option manager to better keep track of user context
    and paint options in a consistent manner.
  User Interface:
  - The Dashboard dockable dialog now has a 'Memory' group that
    shows memory-usage information: the currently used memory size,
    the available physical memory size, and the total physical
    memory size.  It can also show the tile-cache size, for
    comparison against the other memory stats. Note that the
    upper-bound of the meter is the physical memory size, so the
    memory usage may be over 100% when GIMP uses the swap.
  - The Dashboard dockable dialog now has "read" and "written"
    fields in the dashboard swap group, which report the total
    amount of data read-from/written-to the tile swap, respetively.
    Additionally, the swap busy indicator (used as the meter's LED)
    has been improved, so that it's active whenever data has been
    read-from/written-to the swap during the last sampling
    interval, rather than at the point of sampling.
  - Fonts can now be tagged. The user interface is the same as for
    brushes, patterns etc.
  - Some icons fixed: larger spacing between broken chains and
    gimp-tool-ellipse-select made symmetrical.
  Usability:
  - When a plug-in cannot be applied to an image because of
    mismatch in image types (e.g. layer has no alpha or image is
    greyscale), GIMP now displays a message listing supported image
    types for this plug-in.
  Tools:
  - The Measurement tool now has an "Auto straighten" option
    allowing to rotate the active drawable (layer, channel…) so
    that the measurement line is used as horizon. As other
    transform tools, the feature will work on linked drawables as
    well.
  - The Smudge tool now paints correctly on images with a color
    profile other than the GIMP's built-in one.
  Build:
  - Installer: set compatibility options to run Python plugins in
    HiDPI-aware mode.
  - Put back compatibility DLLs for really old plugins.
  - Install binary tool `gimp-test-clipboard` on the system to
    allow people to help us debug clipboard bugs.
  - --enable-bundled-mypaint-brushes renamed
    --enable-relocatable-bundle and also make WMF fonts looked up
    on the runtime prefix of GIMP (instead of the build-time path)
    when this build option was set.
  Plug-ins:
  - gimptool-2.0 binary now accepts source files with non-standard
    extensions if it can try to guess appropriate language from the
    compiler being used. It will also properly quote arguments for
    shell usage.
  - Run explicitly Python 2 as Python plug-in interpreter to
    prevent breakage on systems where Python 3 is the default.
  - raw_input()'s argument in Python console is now optional, and
    input() support has been added.
  File Formats:
  - The PSD loader now provides an option to load "merged",
    pre-composited version of the images that becomes available
    when a PSD file was saved with "Maximize Compatibility" option
    enabled in Photoshop. This is useful when loading PSD files
    that use features that GIMP doesn't currently support, and
    therefore can't render correctly, such as adjustment layers.
    When loading the merged image version, we avoid loading certain
    additional data from the file, such as channels, paths, and
    guides, while still loading metadata. This option is currently
    exposed as an additional file type ("Photoshop image
    (merged)"), which has to be explicitly selected from the
    file-type list when opening the image.
  - Embedding GIMP's built-in sRGB color profile to exported files
    is now optional. The default choice can be set in the
    Preferences dialog.
  Translations:
  - Updated translations: Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish,
    Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Romanian, Russian,
    Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian.

- update to 2.10.2 bugfix release
- drop gimp-Fix-reference-to-gegl-0.3.patch

+ Core:

  - Discard fonts which fail to load and popup an info dialog to allow
    people debug their fonts.
  - New API to suppress updates in UI until plug-ins are done
    introducing changes.
  - New API to calculate histograms in separate threads, with possible further
    extension to handle similar cases elsewhere in GIMP.
  - Tool options are now properly saved and reloaded per-device at
    startup.

+ Plug-ins:

  - New plug-in for importing and exporting HEIF images.
  - Enable visibility of rasterized vector layer from PSD.

+ Filters:

  - New Spherize filter to wrap an image around a spherical cap
  - New Recursive Transform filter to create Droste effect.

+ Usability:

    drawable doesn't have an alpha channel, or the alpha channel is locked.
  - Make the splash texts dynamic, so they are larger on larger splashes.
  - Mention pressing Enter to complete Foreground selection in the status bar.
  - Make sure that clicking outside any selection prevents Rectangle Select
    and Ellipse Select tools from creating empty selections.
  - Improve mouse wheel zooming behavior to keep the same point
    centered under the pointer even if the image is completely visible
    in the canvas.
  - Add "View -> Center Image in Window" (Shift+J) as a quick way to
    center the image at any zoom level.

  - Add a flatpak manifest for the gtk3-port branch.
  - Remove the possibility to disable script-fu.
  - Add a --with-icc-directory configure option to customize the color
    profile directory. By default, it is set to the common path
    /usr/share/color/icc.

+ Documentation:

  - Updating the description of the XCF format "devel-docs/xcf.txt", for
    third-party readers wishing to support GIMP 2.10 XCF files.
  - Add documentation skeletons for all enums in libgimpbase/, there is
    much room for improvement.

- Correctly version librsvg-devel BuildRequires: 2.36.0 is needed.
  We don't version the BuildRequires on 12.1 and earlier to avoid
  useless unresolvables; it will just result in file-svg plugin not
  being built when librsvg is not recent enough there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 14:52:22 UTC 2012 - badshah400@gmail.com

  + Remove optional gimp-module-hal subpackage.
  + Note that we already have a Obsoletes for gimp-module-hal.
- Add pkgconfig(gudev-1.0) BuildRequires for the new gudev input
  module.
- Add ghostscript-devel, ghostscript-library, libbz2-devel,
  libjasper-devel, pkgconfig(atk), pkgconfig(xcursor)
  BuildRequires: new dependencies upstream.
  + Note about ghostscript-library: ideally, we'd avoid listing it
    explicitly, but in OBS, ghostscript-mini is preferred by
    default, but it is not enough for gimp.
- Add explicit pkgconfig(gdk-pixbuf-2.0) BuildRequires so it can be
  versioned.
- Add explicit libjpeg-devel, xorg-x11-libXpm-devel, zlib-devel
  BuildRequires: they were missing before.
- Add libxslt-tools BuildRequires (or libxslt-devel on versions of
  openSUSE <= 12.1) to have xsltproc installed.
- Add fdupes BuildRequires and use %fdupes in %install to avoid
  duplicated files.
- Change gimp-doc Obsoletes in devel subpackage from <= to < to
  avoid rpmlint warning about self-obsoletion.

Fri Oct 21 11:19:42 UTC 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Change gimp-2.0-scanner-plugin Recommends to a Suggests: this
  installs xsane by default, and really, xsane is so horribly
  broken UI-wise that we don't want that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 04:47:12 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.com

  instead of ">= 2.4", which is wrong.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 15 16:19:39 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Fix build on Factory, by not excluding the
  libcontroller-linux-input.so module from the file list of the
  main package when we build without hal. It was only excluded to
  be part of a hal subpackage when there is the hal dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 12 00:14:35 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- On 12.1 and later, stop building the gimp-module-hal subpackage:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 12 17:45:43 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:
  + %desktop_database_post/postun because the package ships at
    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.
- Pass %{?no_lang_C} to %find_lang so that english documentation
  can be packaged with the program, and not in the lang subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  7 10:17:51 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Move ownership from various directories from gimp to

  scriptlets to run ldconfig.
