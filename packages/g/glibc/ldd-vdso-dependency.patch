Subject: [PATCH] elf: Restore how vDSO dependency is printed with
 LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS (BZ #29539)

The d7703d3176d225d5743b21811d888619eba39e82 changed how vDSO like
dependencies are printed, instead of just the name and address it
follows other libraries mode and prints 'name => path'.

Unfortunately, this broke some ldd consumer that uses the output to
filter out the program's dependencies.  For instance CMake
bundleutilities module [1], where GetPrequirite uses the regex to filter
out 'name => path' [2].

This patch restore the previous way to print just the name and the
mapping address.

Checked on x86_64-linux-gnu.
