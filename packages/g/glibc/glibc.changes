  Major new features:
  * Unicode 14.0.0 Support
  * Bump r_version in the debugger interface to 2
  * Support for the C.UTF-8 locale has been added to glibc
  * <math.h> functions that round their results to a narrower type, and
    corresponding <tgmath.h> macros, are added from TS 18661-1:2014, TS
    18661-3:2015 and draft ISO C2X
  * <math.h> functions for floating-point maximum and minimum,
    corresponding to new operations in IEEE 754-2019, and corresponding
    <tgmath.h> macros, are added from draft ISO C2X
  * <math.h> macros for single-precision float constants are added as a
    GNU extension
  * The __STDC_IEC_60559_BFP__ and __STDC_IEC_60559_COMPLEX__ macros are
    predefined as specified in TS 18661-1:2014
  * The exp10 functions in <math.h> now have a corresponding type-generic
    macro in <tgmath.h>
  * The ISO C2X macro _PRINTF_NAN_LEN_MAX has been added to <stdio.h>
  * printf-family functions now support the %b format for output of
    integers in binary, as specified in draft ISO C2X, and the %B variant
    of that format recommended by draft ISO C2X
  * A new DSO sorting algorithm has been added in the dynamic linker that uses
    topological sorting by depth-first search (DFS), solving performance issues
    of the existing sorting algorithm when encountering particular circular
    object dependency cases
  * A new tunable, glibc.rtld.dynamic_sort, can be used to select between
    the two DSO sorting algorithms
  * ABI support for a new function '__memcmpeq'. '__memcmpeq' is meant
    to be used by compilers for optimizing usage of 'memcmp' when its
    return value is only used for its boolean status
  * Support for automatically registering threads with the Linux rseq
    system call has been added
  * A symbolic link to the dynamic linker is now installed under
    /usr/bin/ld.so (or more precisely, '${bindir}/ld.so')
  * All programs and the testsuite in glibc are now built as position independent
    executables (PIE) by default on toolchains and architectures that support it
  * On Linux, a new tunable, glibc.malloc.hugetlb, can be used to
    either make malloc issue madvise plus MADV_HUGEPAGE on mmap and sbrk
    or to use huge pages directly with mmap calls with the MAP_HUGETLB
    flags)
  * The printf family of functions now handles the flagged %#m conversion
    specifier, printing errno as an error constant (similar to strerrorname_np)
  * The function _dl_find_object has been added
  * On Linux, the epoll_pwait2 function has been added
  * The function posix_spawn_file_actions_addtcsetpgrp_np has been added,
    enabling posix_spawn and posix_spawnp to set the controlling terminal in
    the new process in a race free manner
  * Source fortification (_FORTIFY_SOURCE) level 3 is now available for
    applications compiling with glibc and gcc 12 and later
  Deprecated and removed features, and other changes affecting compatibility:
  * On x86-64, the LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable support
    has been removed since the first PT_LOAD segment is no longer executable
    due to defaulting to -z separate-code
  * The r_version update in the debugger interface makes the glibc binary
    incompatible with GDB
  * Intel MPX support (lazy PLT, ld.so profile, and LD_AUDIT) has been removed
  * The catchsegv script and associated libSegFault.so shared object have
    been removed
  * Support for prelink will be removed in the next release; this includes
    removal of the LD_TRACE_PRELINKING, and LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS, environment
    variables and their functionality in the dynamic loader
  Changes to build and runtime requirements:
  * The audit module interface version LAV_CURRENT is increased to enable
    proper bind-now support
  * The audit interface on aarch64 is extended to support both the indirect
    result location register (x8) and NEON Q register
  Security related changes:
  * CVE-2022-23219: Passing an overlong file name to the clnt_create
    legacy function could result in a stack-based buffer overflow when
    using the "unix" protocol
  * CVE-2022-23218: Passing an overlong file name to the svcunix_create
    legacy function could result in a stack-based buffer overflow
  * CVE-2021-3998: Passing a path longer than PATH_MAX to the realpath
    function could result in a memory leak and potential access of
    uninitialized memory
  * CVE-2021-3999: Passing a buffer of size exactly 1 byte to the getcwd
    function may result in an off-by-one buffer underflow and overflow
    when the current working directory is longer than PATH_MAX and also
    corresponds to the / directory through an unprivileged mount
    namespace

    configuration file gconv-modules-extra.conf in the gconv-modules.d directory
    in the same GCONV_PATH
  * On Linux, a new tunable, glibc.pthread.stack_cache_size, can be used
    to configure the size of the thread stack cache
  * The function _Fork has been added as an async-signal-safe fork replacement

  * On Linux, the close_range function has been added
  * The function closefrom has been added
  * The posix_spawn_file_actions_closefrom_np function has been added, enabling

Tue Feb  2 09:33:28 UTC 2021 - Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

- Update to glibc 2.33
  * The dynamic linker accepts the --list-tunables argument which prints
    all the supported tunables.
  * The dynamic linker accepts the --argv0 argument and provides opportunity
    to change argv[0] string.
  * The dynamic linker loads optimized implementations of shared objects
    from subdirectories under the glibc-hwcaps directory on the library
    search path if the system's capabilities meet the requirements for
    that subdirectory.
  * The new --help option of the dynamic linker provides usage and
    information and library search path diagnostics.
  * The mallinfo2 function is added to report statistics as per mallinfo,
    but with larger field widths to accurately report values that are
    larger than fit in an integer.
  * Add <sys/platform/x86.h> to provide query macros for x86 CPU features.
  * A new fortification level _FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 is available.
  * The mallinfo function is marked deprecated.
  * When dlopen is used in statically linked programs, alternative library
    implementations from HWCAP subdirectories are no longer loaded.
  * The deprecated <sys/vtimes.h> header and the function vtimes have been
    removed.
  * On s390(x), the type float_t is now derived from the macro
    __FLT_EVAL_METHOD__ that is defined by the compiler, instead of being
    hardcoded to double.
  * A future version of glibc will stop loading shared objects from the
    "tls" subdirectories on the library search path, the subdirectory that
    corresponds to the AT_PLATFORM system name, and also stop employing
    the legacy AT_HWCAP search mechanism.
  * CVE-2021-3326: An assertion failure during conversion from the
    ISO-20220-JP-3 character set using the iconv function has been fixed.

- Update to glibc 2.32
  * Unicode 13.0.0 Support
  * New locale added: ckb_IQ
  * The GNU C Library now loads audit modules listed in the DT_AUDIT and
    DT_DEPAUDIT dynamic section entries of the main executable
  * powerpc64le supports IEEE128 long double libm/libc redirects when
    using the -mabi=ieeelongdouble to compile C code on supported GCC
    toolchains
  * To help detect buffer overflows and other out-of-bounds accesses
    several APIs have been annotated with GCC 'access' attribute
  * On Linux, functions the pthread_attr_setsigmask_np and
    pthread_attr_getsigmask_np have been added
  * The GNU C Library now provides the header file <sys/single_threaded.h>
    which declares the variable __libc_single_threaded
  * The functions sigabbrev_np and sigdescr_np have been added
  * The functions strerrorname_np and strerrordesc_np have been added
  * AArch64 now supports standard branch protection security hardening
    in glibc when it is built with a GCC that is configured with
    --enable-standard-branch-protection (or if -mbranch-protection=standard
    flag is passed when building both GCC target libraries and glibc,
    in either case a custom GCC is needed)
  * The deprecated <sys/sysctl.h> header and the sysctl function have been
    removed
  * The sstk function is no longer available to newly linked binaries
  * The legacy signal handling functions siginterrupt, sigpause, sighold,
    sigrelse, sigignore and sigset, and the sigmask macro have been
    deprecated
  * ldconfig now defaults to the new format for ld.so.cache
  * The deprecated arrays sys_siglist, _sys_siglist, and sys_sigabbrev
    are no longer available to newly linked binaries, and their declarations
    have been removed from <string.h>

    are no longer available to newly linked binaries, and their declarations
    have been removed from from <stdio.h>
  * Both strerror and strerror_l now share the same internal buffer in the
    calling thread, meaning that the returned string pointer may be invalided
    or contents might be overwritten on subsequent calls in the same thread or
    if the thread is terminated
  * Using weak references to libpthread functions such as pthread_create
    or pthread_key_create to detect the singled-threaded nature of a
    program is an obsolescent feature
  * The "files" NSS module no longer supports the "key" database (used for
    secure RPC)
  * The __morecore and __after_morecore_hook malloc hooks and the default
    implementation __default_morecore have been deprecated
  * The hesiod NSS module has been deprecated and will be removed in a
    future version of glibc

    functions for other floating-point types, now take pointer arguments to
    avoid signaling NaNs possibly being converted to quiet NaNs in argument

- Update to glibc 2.27
  * Optimized x86-64 asin, atan2, exp, expf, log, pow, atan, sin, cosf,
    sinf, sincosf and tan with FMA
  * Optimized x86-64 trunc and truncf for processors with SSE4.1
  * Optimized generic expf, exp2f, logf, log2f, powf, sinf, cosf and
    sincosf
  * In order to support faster and safer process termination the malloc API
    family of functions will no longer print a failure address and stack
    backtrace after detecting heap corruption
  * The abort function terminates the process immediately, without flushing
    stdio streams
  * On platforms where long double has the IEEE binary128 format (aarch64,
    alpha, mips64, riscv, s390 and sparc), the math library now implements
    _Float128 interfaces for that type, as defined by ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015
    These are the same interfaces added in version 2.26 for some platforms where
    this format is supported but is not the format of long double
  * On platforms with support for _Float64x (aarch64, alpha, i386, ia64,
    mips64, powerpc64le, riscv, s390, sparc and x86_64), the math library now
    implements interfaces for that type, as defined by ISO/IEC TS
    18661-3:2015
  * The math library now implements interfaces for the _Float32, _Float64 and
    _Float32x types, as defined by ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015
  * glibc now implements the memfd_create and mlock2 functions on Linux
  * Support for memory protection keys was added
  * The copy_file_range function was added
  * The ldconfig utility now processes `include' directives using the C/POSIX
    collation ordering
  * Support for two grammatical forms of month names has been added
  * Support for the RISC-V ISA running on Linux has been added
  * Statically compiled applications attempting to load locales compiled for the
    GNU C Library version 2.27 will fail and fall back to the builtin C/POSIX
    locale
  * Support for statically linked applications which call dlopen is deprecated
    and will be removed in a future version of glibc
  * Support for old programs which use internal stdio data structures and
    functions is deprecated
  * On GNU/Linux, the obsolete Linux constant PTRACE_SEIZE_DEVEL is no longer
    defined by <sys/ptrace.h>
  * libm no longer supports SVID error handling (calling a user-provided
    matherr function on error) or the _LIB_VERSION variable to control error
    handling
  * The libm functions pow10, pow10f and pow10l are no longer supported for
    new programs
  * The mcontext_t type is no longer the same as struct sigcontext
  * The add-ons mechanism for building additional packages at the same time as
    glibc has been removed
  * The res_hnok, res_dnok, res_mailok and res_ownok functions now check that
    the specified string can be parsed as a domain name
  * In the malloc_info output, the <heap> element may contain another <aspace>
    element, "subheaps", which contains the number of sub-heaps
  * In the malloc_info output, the <heap> element may contain another <aspace>
    element, "subheaps", which contains the number of sub-heaps
  * The nonstandard header files <libio.h> and <_G_config.h> are deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release
  * CVE-2018-6485, CVE-2018-6551: The posix_memalign and memalign
    functions, when called with an object size near the value of SIZE_MAX,
    would return a pointer to a buffer which is too small, instead of NULL

- Update to glibc 2.26
  * A per-thread cache has been added to malloc
  * Unicode 10.0.0 Support
  * Improvements to the DNS stub resolver
  * New function reallocarray, which resizes an allocated block (like
    realloc) to the product of two sizes, with a guaranteed clean failure
    upon integer overflow in the multiplication
  * New wrappers for the Linux-specific system calls preadv2 and pwritev2
  * posix_spawnattr_setflags now supports the flag POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID, to
    create a new session ID for the spawned process
  * errno.h is now safe to use from C-preprocessed assembly language on all
    supported operating systems
  * On ia64, powerpc64le, x86-32, and x86-64, the math library now implements
    128-bit floating point as defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (IEEE
    754-2008) and ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015
  * The synchronization that pthread_spin_unlock performs has been changed to
    now be equivalent to a C11 atomic store with release memory order to the
    spin lock's memory location
  * The DNS stub resolver no longer performs EDNS fallback
  * res_mkquery and res_nmkquery no longer support the IQUERY opcode
  * The _res_opcodes variable has been removed from libresolv
  * <string.h> no longer includes inline versions of any string functions,
    as this kind of optimization is better done by the compiler
  * The nonstandard header <xlocale.h> has been removed
  * The obsolete header <sys/ultrasound.h> has been removed
  * The obsolete signal constant SIGUNUSED is no longer defined by <signal.h>
  * The obsolete function cfree has been removed

  * The ucontext_t type no longer has the name struct ucontext
  * On S/390 GNU/Linux, the constants defined by <sys/ptrace.h> have been
    synced with the kernel
  * Linux kernel 3.2 or later is required at runtime, on all architectures
    supported by that kernel
  * The DNS stub resolver limits the advertised UDP buffer size to 1200 bytes,
    to avoid fragmentation-based spoofing attacks (CVE-2017-12132)
  * LD_LIBRARY_PATH is now ignored in binaries running in privileged
    AT_SECURE mode to guard against local privilege escalation attacks
    (CVE-2017-1000366)
  * Avoid printing a backtrace from the __stack_chk_fail function since it
    is called on a corrupt stack and a backtrace is unreliable on a
    corrupt stack (CVE-2010-3192)
  * A use-after-free vulnerability in clntudp_call in the Sun RPC system
    has been fixed (CVE-2017-12133)

    24731-2:2010, is supported to enable declarations of functions from that
    TR.
  * The feature test macro __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__, from ISO/IEC TS
    18661-1:2014, is supported to enable declarations of functions and macros
    from that TS.

    now treated as compatibility synonyms for _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.
  * The inclusion of <sys/sysmacros.h> by <sys/types.h> is deprecated.
  * New <fenv.h> features from TS 18661-1:2014 are added to libm: the

  * New <math.h> features are added from TS 18661-1:2014:
    - Signaling NaN macros: SNANF, SNAN, SNANL.
    - Nearest integer functions: roundeven, roundevenf, roundevenl, fromfp,
      fromfpf, fromfpl, ufromfp, ufromfpf, ufromfpl, fromfpx, fromfpxf,
      fromfpxl, ufromfpx, ufromfpxf, ufromfpxl.
    - llogb functions: the llogb, llogbf and llogbl functions, and the
      FP_LLOGB0 and FP_LLOGBNAN macros.
    - Max-min magnitude functions: fmaxmag, fmaxmagf, fmaxmagl, fminmag,
      fminmagf, fminmagl.
    - Comparison macros: iseqsig.
    - Classification macros: iscanonical, issubnormal, iszero.
    - Total order functions: totalorder, totalorderf, totalorderl,
      totalordermag, totalordermagf, totalordermagl.
    - Canonicalize functions: canonicalize, canonicalizef, canonicalizel.
    - NaN functions: getpayload, getpayloadf, getpayloadl, setpayload,
      setpayloadf, setpayloadl, setpayloadsig, setpayloadsigf, setpayloadsigl.
  * The functions strfromd, strfromf, and strfroml, from ISO/IEC TS 18661-1:2014,
    are added to libc.
  * Most of glibc can now be built with the stack smashing protector enabled.
  * The function explicit_bzero, from OpenBSD, has been added to libc.
  * On ColdFire, MicroBlaze, Nios II and SH3, the float_t type is now defined
    to float instead of double.
  * On x86_64, when compiling with -mfpmath=387 or -mfpmath=sse+387, the
    float_t and double_t types are now defined to long double instead of float
    and double.
  * The getentropy and getrandom functions, and the <sys/random.h> header file
    have been added.
  * The buffer size for byte-oriented stdio streams is now limited to 8192
    bytes by default.
  * The <sys/quota.h> header now includes the <linux/quota.h> header.
  * The malloc_get_state and malloc_set_state functions have been removed.
  * The “ip6-dotint” and “no-ip6-dotint” resolver options, and the
    corresponding RES_NOIP6DOTINT flag from <resolv.h> have been removed.
  * The "ip6-bytestring" resolver option and the corresponding RES_USEBSTRING
    flag from <resolv.h> have been removed.
  * The flags RES_AAONLY, RES_PRIMARY, RES_NOCHECKNAME, RES_KEEPTSIG,
    RES_BLAST defined in the <resolv.h> header file have been deprecated.
  * The "inet6" option in /etc/resolv.conf and the RES_USE_INET6 flag for
    _res.flags are deprecated.
  * DNSSEC-related declarations and definitions have been removed from the
    <arpa/nameser.h> header file, and libresolv will no longer attempt to
    decode the data part of DNSSEC record types.
  * The resource record type classification macros ns_t_qt_p, ns_t_mrr_p,
    ns_t_rr_p, ns_t_udp_p, ns_t_xfr_p have been removed from the
    <arpa/nameser.h> header file because the distinction between RR types and
    meta-RR types is not officially standardized, subject to revision, and
    thus not suitable for encoding in a macro.
  * The types res_sendhookact, res_send_qhook, re_send_rhook, and the qhook
    and rhook members of the res_state type in <resolv.h> have been removed.
  * For multi-arch support it is recommended to use a GCC which has
    been built with support for GNU indirect functions.
  * GDB pretty printers have been added for mutex and condition variable
    structures in POSIX Threads.
  * Tunables feature added to allow tweaking of the runtime for an application
    program.
  * A new version of condition variables functions have been implemented in
    the NPTL implementation of POSIX Threads to provide stronger ordering
    guarantees.
  * A new version of pthread_rwlock functions have been implemented to use a more
    scalable algorithm primarily through not using a critical section anymore to
    make state changes.
  * On ARM EABI (32-bit), generating a backtrace for execution contexts which
    have been created with makecontext could fail to terminate due to a
    missing .cantunwind annotation.  (CVE-2016-6323)
  * The DNS stub resolver functions would crash due to a NULL pointer
    dereference when processing a query with a valid DNS question type which
    was used internally in the implementation. (CVE-2015-5180)
- Enable stack protector if part of %optflags

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  2 13:55:44 UTC 2016 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to glibc 2.24
  * The minimum Linux kernel version that this version of the GNU C Library
    can be used with is 3.2
  * The pap_AN locale has been deleted
  * The readdir_r and readdir64_r functions have been deprecated
  * The type `union wait' has been removed
  * A new NSS action is added to facilitate large distributed system
    administration
  * The deprecated __malloc_initialize_hook variable has been removed from
    the API
  * The long unused localedef --old-style option has been removed
  * nextupl, nextup, nextupf, nextdownl, nextdown and nextdownf are added
    to libm
  * An unnecessary stack copy in _nss_dns_getnetbyname_r was removed
    (CVE-2016-3075)
  * Previously, getaddrinfo copied large amounts of address data to the
    stack, even after the fix for CVE-2013-4458 has been applied,
    potentially resulting in a stack overflow.  getaddrinfo now uses a
    heap allocation instead (CVE-2016-3706)
  * The glob function suffered from a stack-based buffer overflow when it
    was called with the GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC flag and encountered a long file
    name (CVE-2016-1234)
  * The Sun RPC UDP client could exhaust all available stack space when
    flooded with crafted ICMP and UDP messages (CVE-2016-4429)
  * The IPv6 name server management code in libresolv could result in a
    memory leak for each thread which is created, performs a failing
    naming lookup, and exits (CVE-2016-5417)

Tue Aug  6 09:20:04 UTC 2013 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to glibc 2.17.90 85891acadf1b:
  * CVE-2013-2207 Incorrectly granting access to another user's pseudo-terminal
    has been fixed by disabling the use of pt_chown (Bugzilla #15755).
    Distributions can re-enable building and using pt_chown via the new configure
    option `--enable-pt_chown'.  Enabling the use of pt_chown carries with it
    considerable security risks and should only be used if the distribution
    understands and accepts the risks.
  * CVE-2013-0242 Buffer overrun in regexp matcher has been fixed (Bugzilla
    #15078).
  * CVE-2013-1914 Stack overflow in getaddrinfo with many results has been
    fixed (Bugzilla #15330).
  * Add support for calling C++11 thread_local object destructors on thread
    and program exit.  This needs compiler support for offloading C++11
    destructor calls to glibc.
  * Improved worst case performance of libm functions with double inputs and
    output.
  * Support for priority inherited mutexes in pthread condition variables on
    non-x86 architectures.
  * Optimized string functions for AArch64.  Implemented by Marcus Shawcroft.
  * Optimized string functions for ARM.  Implemented by Will Newton and
    Richard Henderson.
  * Added a benchmark framework to track performance of functions in glibc.
  * New <math.h> macro named issignaling to check for a signaling NaN (sNaN).
    It is based on draft TS 18661 and currently enabled as a GNU extension.
  * On Linux, the clock function now uses the clock_gettime system call
    for improved precision, rather than old times system call.
  * Added new API functions pthread_getattr_default_np and
    pthread_setattr_default_np to get and set the default pthread
    attributes of a process.
  * Added support for TSX lock elision for pthread mutexes on i386 and x86-64.
    This may improve lock scaling of existing programs on TSX capable systems.
  * Support added for AT_HWCAP2 (to coincide with Linux kernel 3.10
    availability).  Implemented by Ryan S. Arnold.
  * Support added for POWER8 platform.  Implemented by Ryan S. Arnold.

  - glibc-sparc64-fxstat.diff
- Remove the NSS hack of opening modules using RTLD_DEEPBIND.
  This was useful for nss_ldap, since some applications used a different
  LDAP library with clashing symbol names. However, it also created
  many headaches, especially with the NSS modules not respecting
  malloc() overrides. Now, sssd is used by default for LDAP resolutions
  and we can therefore safely get rid of the hack. [bnc#477061]
- Remove the currently disabled AMD string function overrides.
  Benchmarking did not unearth any differences that would make
  convincing case for keeping the functions with all the associated
  maintenance headaches; AMD does not recommend keeping their custom
  versions of the functions either.

- Upgrade to Git HEAD as of 20091105 - glibc-2.11-13f6812ffb5b:
  * New interfaces: execvpe, pthread_sigqueue, mkstemps, mkstemps64, mkostemps,
    mkostemps64
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * Checking version of longjmp added that fails if an uninitialized stack
    frame would be created.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * STT_GNU_IFUNC is now supported in static executables.
    Implemented by H.J. Lu.

  * STT_GNU_IFUNC implemented for PPC by Alan Modra.

  * New optimized string functions for x86-64: strstr, strcasestr, memcmp,
    strcspn, strpbrk, strspn, strcpy, stpcpy, strncpy, strcmp (SSE2, SSE4.2),
    strncmp (SSE2, SSE4.2), strchr (SSE4.2), strrchr (SSE4.2).
    Contributed by H.J. Lu.

    strlen, rawmemchr, strcmp (SSSE3), strncmp (SSSE3).
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * New optimized string functions for x86: strlen, strcspn, strspn, strpbrk,
    strstr, strcasestr.
    Contributed by H.J. Lu.

  * Support for fma instruction in AVX on x86-64.
    Implemented by H.J. Lu and Ulrich Drepper.

  * AVX support in x86-64 auditing support in ld.so.
    Implemented by H.J. Lu.

  * STB_GNU_UNIQUE support added.
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * Implement second fallback mode for optimized DNS lookup for even more
    broken environments.  If two requests from the same port are not
    handled correctly close the socket and open a new one before sending
    the second request.  The 'single-request-reopen' option in /etc/resolv.conf
    can be used to select this mode right away, instead of rediscovering the
    necessity is every process again.
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * New resolver flag RES_USE_DNSSEC to enable use of verified lookup.
    Implemented by Adam Tkac.

  * Optimized iconv conversions for S390x.
    Implemented by Andreas Krebbel.

  * Using condvars with PI mutexes is now more efficient due to kernel
    support for requeueing to PI futexes.  NPTL support added for x86-64.
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * New locales: ps_AF, my_MM

- Upgrade to CVS HEAD as of 2009051010 - glibc-2.10:
  * DNS IPv4-IPv6 lookup changed back to parallel version; with broken DNS
    servers (the case e.g. for many ADSL users), you may experience long
    timeouts, once for each process (but eventually your request will be
    resolved) - the solution is to run nscd (default on SUSE) and/or
    put 'options single-request' in /etc/resolv.conf.

  * New interfaces: preadv, preadv64, pwritev, pwritev64, malloc_info
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * New Linux interfaces: accept4, fallocate, fallocate64.
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * Correct declarations of string function when used in C++ code.  This
    could lead to compile errors for invalid C++ code.

  * XPG7/POSIX 2008 compilation environment.  Many GNU-specific functions are
    now in POSIX.

  * New POSIX 2008 interface: psiginfo
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * New ISO C++1x interfaces: quick_exit, at_quick_exit
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * Support for selecting between multiple function definitions at runtime
    using STT_GNU_IFUNC symbols.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * The libcrypt library can now use the hash function implementations in
    NSS.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * The malloc implementation can be compiled to be less memory efficient
    but higher performing in multi-threaded programs.
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * New locales: nan_TW@latin, ks_IN

  * Faster strlen, strchr, strchrnul, strrchr, memchr, and rawmemchr for x86-64.
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * Extended printf hook support.  It is possible to use user-defined types
    and extend existing format specifiers.
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.

  * Handling for group shadow files has been added.
    Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.
