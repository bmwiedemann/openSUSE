Wed Aug 24 15:24:30 UTC 2016 - junghans@votca.org

- version bump to 2016 details here:
  http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2016/ReleaseNotes/index.html
- Highlights:
  - As always, we’ve got several useful performance improvements, with or without GPUs. CPU-side SIMD and threading enhancements will make GPU-accelerated simulations faster even if we’d left the GPU code alone! Thanks to these and additional GPU kernel improvements, in GPU-accelerated runs expect around 15% improvement in throughput. (And not just for plain vanilla MD, either... the pull code now supports OpenMP threading throughout, and multi-simulations have less coupling between simulations.)  
  - We have a new C++11 portability layer permitting us to accelerate in SIMD on the CPU lots of minor routines. These will also often improve runs that use accelerators or many nodes through better load balancing. POWER8, ARM64, AVX512 (KNL), and more are fully SIMD accelerated now because they are supported in the new portability layer!
  - We made further SIMD acceleration of bonded interactions which reduces their calculation time by about a factor of 2. This improves load balance at high parallelization by a factor of 2, and shows significantly better scaling.
  - Similarly, SIMD acceleration of SETTLE reduces the time for constraints by a factor of 3 to 5 - which has a strong effect for GPU runs.
  - OpenCL GPU support is now available with all combinations of MPI, thread-MPI and GPU sharing (ie. the same as CUDA). Kernel performance has improved by up to 60%. AMD GPUs benefit the most, OpenCL on NVIDIA is generally still slow.
  - Tools in the new analysis framework can handle trajectories that are subsets of the simulation system.
  - New pull coordinate geometries angle-axis, dihedral, and normal angle.
  - Checkpoint restarts work only in the cases where the implementation can always do what the user wants.
  - The version numbering has changed to be the year of the release, plus (in future) a patch number. GROMACS 2016 will be the initial release from this branch, then GROMACS 2016.1 will have the set of bugs that have been fixed in GROMACS 2016, etc.

Mon Feb  4 09:20:09 UTC 2013 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 4.6
  New features

  - New Verlet non-bonded scheme which, by default, uses exact cut-off's
    and a buffered pair-list.
  - Multi-level hybrid parallelization (MPI + OpenMP + CUDA):
    full OpenMP multithreading with the Verlet scheme;
  - OpenMP mulitthreading for PME-only nodes with the group scheme;
    native GPU acceleration using CUDA (supporte NVIDIA hardware).
  - New x86 SIMD non-bonded kernels for the usual cut-off scheme, called
    group scheme and the new verlet scheme, use x86 SIMD intrinsics (no
    more assembly code):
    SSE2
    SSE4.1
    AVX-128-FMA (for AMD Bulldozer/Piledriver)
    AVX-256 (for Intel Sandy/Ivy Bridge)
  - Automated OpenMP thread count choice to use all available cores.
  - Automated CPU affinity setting: locking processes or threads to cores.
  - Automated PP-PME (task) load-balancing: balancing non-bonded force and
    PME mesh workload when the two are executed on different
    compute-resources (i.e CPU and GPU or different CPUs). This enables
    GPU-CPU and PP-PME process load balancing by shifting work from the
    mesh to the non-bonded calculation.
  - PPPM/P3M with analytical derivative at the same cost and with the same
    features as PME.
  - New, advanced free energy sampling techniques.
  - AdResS adaptive resolution simulation support.
  - Enforced rotation ("rotational pulling")
  - Build configuration now uses CMake, configure+autoconf/make no longer
    supported. (The CMake build system features with a lot of automation
    and cleverness under the hood and we know that the it might not always
    prove to be as rock-solid as the old one. However, far more advanced
    and complex, so bear with us while we iron out issues that come up
    along the way.)
  - g_hbond now utilizes OpenMP.

  Plus plenty of bug fixes.

Thu Oct  7 07:24:01 UTC 2010 - kkaempf@novell.com

- Update to 4.5.1
  - fix bnc#642828 (CVE-2010-4001: Insecure use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
  See http://www.gromacs.org/About_Gromacs/Release_Notes/Version_4.5
  for a full list of changes

  - 2D decomposition support for PME: improved load balancing with
    up to 40% overall performance improvement for large systems.
  - Memory usage is improved for very large systems, allowing
    simulations of >100 million atoms. 
  - Running on multi-core nodes now automatically uses thread-
    based parallelization.
  - GPU computing support
  - Check-pointing is made more secure:MD5sum are used to verify
    that all files are correctly in-place before a simulation is
    appended. Output file appending at continuation is turned on
    by default
  - Full Cmake support. Autoconf/automake will be deprecated after
    the final 4.5 release!
  - Full support for 7 AMBER force fields
  - Support for CHARMM27, including cmap for dihedrals
  - Efficient Generalized-Born implicit solvent support including
    the Still/HCT/OBC-models to compute the Born radii, a novel way
    of tabulating the generalized Born-interaction formula for
    greater speed, and optimized SSE-routines for both cut-off and
    all-vs-all simulations.
  - Support for nucleic acid simulations
  - Support for Velocity-Verlet integrators for reversible T- and
    P-coupling; MTTK pressure control integrators; Nose-Hoover
    chains
  - Support for Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) free energy
    calculations
  - Decoupling group setup for free energy
  - File formats: All GROMACS tools can now read any VMD supported
    trajectory format, without converting trajectory first. (VMD
    is required)
  - g_rdf was a little bit enhanced that structure factors can be
    calculated for any system, by supplying the necessary data via
    sfactor.dat. Most of the common atomtypes are already contained,
    but everybody who needs more freedom can enhance the table
  - Library support for "dynamic index groups" based on textual
    selections (experimental feature). See the tool g_select, the
    included template.c, or Doxygen documentation for information on
    how to write analysis tools using the library. Existing tools
    have not (yet) been converted.
  - g_tune_pme: For a given number of processes or threads this tool
    systematically times mdrun with various numbers of PME-only nodes
    and determines which setting is fastest. It also checks whether
    performance can be enhanced by shifting load between the real and
    the reciprocal space part of the Ewald sum.
  - g_membed: a very convenient utility for embedding membrane
    proteins into equilibrated lipid bilayers
