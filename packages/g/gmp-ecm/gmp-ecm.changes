- update to 7.0.4
  * fixed a bug in mpres_pow:
    https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?func=detail&atid=623&aid=20712&group_id=135
  * fixed a bug with P-1 or P+1 and small B2
  * improved portability (OS X, Windows, Cygwin, non GNU ld)
  * fixed make longcheck with out-of-source build
- update to 7.0.3
  * fixed compilation issue on powerpc64
- update to 7.0.2
  * fixed bug in P-1/P+1 stage 2 and -redc when -1/N mod R has 
    less than n limbs
- update to 7.0.1
  * fixed efficiency issue with divisors of 2^n+/-1
  * allow for larger B1 values on Windows computers in batch mode
  * several fixes on Debian (FreeBSD, powerpc64)
  * fixed save files generated by gpu-ecm
  * fixed issue with gcc-5 (CC/CFLAGS from gmp.h were no longer 
    used)
  * updated longlong.h file from GMP 6.1.0
  * fixed some compiler warnings
- update to 7.0.0
  * GMP-ECM is now thread-safe. In particular the "ecmfactor" 
    binary can be called with say -t 17 to use 17 threads. 
  * Added GPU code for Step 1 (command-line option -gpu). 
  * Command-line option -param allows to choose the parametrization 
    (valid values are 0, 1, 2, 3). Command-line option -sigma allows 
    to choose the parameter. "-sigma i:s" is a shortcut to 
    "-param i -sigma s". Use -param 0 to get historical Suyama
    parametrization. 
  * The batch mode is now chosen with -param command-line option. 
    The default parametrization depends on other command-line 
    options. 
  * For P-1 stage 2, by default the NTT code is always used. 
  * Speedup in stage 2 with -no-ntt 
  * New primality proving code with APRCL (contributed by 
    David Cleaver) with --enable-aprcl (default=yes) 
  * Removed some options that were unused or not tested 
   (-n, -nn, -ve, -cofdec, -B2scale). 
  * The configure --enable-shellcmd option was removed, and also 
    the --enable-memory-debug configure option (now obsolete with 
    valgrind). 
  * The -b options was removed (breadth-first mode) 
  * Improved source coverage (92.7% of source code lines) 
- remove patch ecm-auxi.c.patch because now in upstream
