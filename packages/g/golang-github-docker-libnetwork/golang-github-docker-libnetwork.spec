# NOTE: A while ago, Docker downgraded this dependency on an upgrade, which
#       caused lots of issues when trying to upgrade the RPMs. To fix this, we
#       bumped the version to v0.7.0.1+... which RPM saw as an upgrade.
#       Unfortunately subsequent upgrades have yet to bump the other version
#       components, so we need to keep the '.1' even though it isn't
#       technically correct. Hopefully we will be able to remove it eventually.
