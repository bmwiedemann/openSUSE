- Update hslua-list to version 1.1.4.
  ## hslua-list-1.1.4

  Released 2024-10-01.

  -   Added function `List.iter`; it returns an iterator function
      that returns the next list item each time it is called.

  -   `List.extend` now returns the extended list instead of the
      list that was appended.

  ## hslua-list-1.1.3

  Released 2024-09-26.

  -   Fixed a bug that prevented `List.filter` to be used on tables
      that don't have a metatable.

  -   Added a stub function to ensure that the module can be
      compiled against Lua 5.3.

  -   Lowered the lower bound for hslua-core, allowing hslua-core
      2.1.

  ## hslua-list-1.1.2

  Released 2024-09-20.

  -   Lists can now be constructed from iterators.

  -   Added method `:at` to access list elements by index; negative
      indices are counted from the end. A second value can be
      passed, which will be returned if there is no item at the
      given index.

- Update hslua-list to version 1.1.1.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:
