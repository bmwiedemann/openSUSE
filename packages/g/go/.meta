  <title>A compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent programming language</title>
  <description>Go is an expressive, concurrent, garbage collected systems programming language
that is type safe and memory safe. It has pointers but no pointer arithmetic.
Go has fast builds, clean syntax, garbage collection, methods for any type, and
run-time reflection. It feels like a dynamic language but has the speed and
safety of a static language.</description>
