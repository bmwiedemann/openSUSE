    <comment>git-bug is a bug tracker that:

* is fully embedded in git: you only need your git repository to have a bug tracker
* is distributed: use your normal git remote to collaborate, push and pull your bugs!
* works offline: in a plane or under the sea? Keep reading and writing bugs!
* prevents vendor lock-in: your usual service is down or went bad? You already have a full backup.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.8.0:
  - More than 800 commits and a long long time after, git-bug
    v0.8.0 is now available.
  - Once again, this release represent a push towards making
    git-bug generally useful and correct. The two main
    improvements are a new Entity framework and write-capable
    WebUI.
  - Breaking changes(openSUSE package is much closer to this
    release)
    - changes in the data model makes it a requirement to use the
      migration tool to to update any previous repo.
    - remove the legacy identities that were directly embedded in
      bugs
  - Core
    - introduce a reusable entity package capable of handling
      all the complex operations of an Entity (bug, board,
      config ...): operations, DAG manipulation, conflict merge,
      signature, integrity ... to greatly simplify writing and
      maintaining an entity. Documentation 1, Documentation 2
    - introduce CombinedId, a new kind of identifier for an
      item within an Entity (for example a comment in a bug),
      that hold two partial identifiers interleaved for fast
      addressing. Documentation
    - introduce the concept of resolvers, so that entities can
      link to another

      executing the local git binary
