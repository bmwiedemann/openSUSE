    <comment>git-bug is a bug tracker that:

* is fully embedded in git: you only need your git repository to have a bug tracker
* is distributed: use your normal git remote to collaborate, push and pull your bugs!
* works offline: in a plane or under the sea? Keep reading and writing bugs!
* prevents vendor lock-in: your usual service is down or went bad? You already have a full backup.</comment>
