  - More than 800 commits and a long long time after, git-bug
    v0.8.0 is now available.

    improvements are a new Entity framework and write-capable
    WebUI.
  - Breaking changes(openSUSE package is much closer to this
    release)
    - changes in the data model makes it a requirement to use the
      migration tool to to update any previous repo.
    - remove the legacy identities that were directly embedded in
      bugs
  - Core
    - introduce a reusable entity package capable of handling
      all the complex operations of an Entity (bug, board,
      config ...): operations, DAG manipulation, conflict merge,
      signature, integrity ... to greatly simplify writing and
      maintaining an entity. Documentation 1, Documentation 2
    - introduce CombinedId, a new kind of identifier for an
      item within an Entity (for example a comment in a bug),
      that hold two partial identifiers interleaved for fast
      addressing. Documentation
    - introduce the concept of resolvers, so that entities can
      link to another

      signature, and verifying

    - rework of the Repository layer for modularity, simplicity
      and testing, allowing more easily to plug an alternative

      other app can use the entity package as a framework by
      @smoyer64

      credentials, labels, remote, identity and flags tada by

      conductive to testing
    - new command comment edit to edit a bug's comment
    - new command rm to remove a bug by @vincetiu8
