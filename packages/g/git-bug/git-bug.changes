      bugs
  - Core
    - introduce a reusable entity package capable of handling
      all the complex operations of an Entity (bug, board,

      signature, integrity ... to greatly simplify writing and
      maintaining an entity. Documentation 1, Documentation 2
    - introduce CombinedId, a new kind of identifier for an
      item within an Entity (for example a comment in a bug),
      that hold two partial identifiers interleaved for fast
      addressing. Documentation
