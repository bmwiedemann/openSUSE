  <description>gocryptfs is built on top the excellent go-fuse FUSE library. This project was inspired by EncFS and strives to fix its security issues while providing good performance.

gocryptfs uses file-based encryption that is implemented as a mountable FUSE filesystem. Each file in gocryptfs is stored as one corresponding encrypted file on disk.</description>
