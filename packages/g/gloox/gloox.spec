%description
gloox is a portable high-level Jabber/XMPP library for C++. It is fully
compliant with the XMPP RFCs, supports all of the XMPP features (including
SRV lookups, TLS, SASL, roster management, and privacy lists), and implements
several XEPs that make it ideal for writing any kind of Jabber/XMPP client
or component.
