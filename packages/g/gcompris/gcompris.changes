  taken from debian patch tracker (bgo#747949, deb#785840); patch

  requires /usr/lib64/libgtk-x11-2.0.so) and so on.

  ++ Updated Serbian translation by Мирослав Николић

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 30 09:17:14 UTC 2011 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 11.12:
  + a lot of Translations updates and fixes

  + Bug fixes
    ++ By Hans de Goede rsvg: fixed deprecated issue releated to 
       rsvg. 
    ++ wordsgame: manage depracation of the g_mutex_lock versus 
       g_static_mutex_lock cleanup, replaced deprecated g_strcasecmp 
       by g_ascii_strcasecmp 
    ++ wordsgame activity: fixed race conditions
    ++ hangman: unsupported locale in GCompris was making this 
       activity crash. Fixes bug 
       https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662576
    ++ core: now handle the ’C’ locale as en_US Currently a ’C’ 
       locale was interpreted in GCompris by Catalan.

  + New Activities
  ++ A set of activities to discover the Braille system. They have 
     been made by Srishti Sethi this summer (part of the Gnome 
     Summer of Code):
     - The history of Louis Braille
     - Discover the Braille system
     - Training using a funny game, like falling letters but with Braille
     - Braille lotto to remember Braille numbers.

   ++ click on letter uppercase: same as click on letter but with 
      only upper case. Now the old activity ’click on letter’ proposes 
      only lower case.

  + Activity updates:
  ++ erase activity: added new animals from picture by Adrien Grellier 
     and Claire Gegout from their Antarctic trip.
  ++ shapegame activities: now we display the ok button when all shapes 
     are placed even with errors. We also show a red cross indicating 
     the children errors. Thanks to Arnaud Limon for the suggestion. 
     Fixed a potential crash when a piece was overwritten by another 
     in their wrong position.
  ++ Changed the combo locale system to display the language in their 
     textual form instead of their locale code. Maintain them sorted to 
     make it even easier to use. Now activites with locale configuration 
     use this feature.
  ++ Mostly full rewrite of the click on letter activity to allow a specific 
     configuration per language and per user. Now this activity takes a desktop 
     formated file as input. It contains for each level the questions and 
     answers charaters to propose. This file can be edited in the game through 
     the config button, in this case a local data file is save under the user’s 
     My GCompris folder and is reused. Now for each country we must provide a 
     data file, this is much better than before where it was fully random and 
     was not respecting the natural difficulties of a language. If this file is 
     missing we create the level automatically from the alphabet (or from the 
     english one for Latin based alphabet) now display the text of the question 
     if we cannot play it for any reason which makes this activity playable even 
     if we don’t have the voice set or the sound is disabled. Also if one letter 
     is missing from the voice set it remains playable. Improved the graphism. 
     based on an openclipart image. Splitted click on letter in two activities, 
     on with lowercase one with uppercase as suggested by Sylvain Dechy.
  ++ memory sound activity: the tux band background image with the bsd devil is 
     considered offensive in some country. Now the bsd devil looks less like a 
     devil and more like a red little boy.
  ++ wordsgame activity: changed the text color of the falling words to be back 
     and white I found out that reading text in color other than black and white 
     is very hard.
  ++ In login.py and tuxpaint, reactivated the config button that was missing.
  ++ memory activity: fixed several potential crash cases when the memory was 
     run with sound disabled.
  ++ Now in the hangman, we display the name of the current language.
  ++ Advanced color activity: fixed color names not to include _ when 
     composed of 2 names
  ++ Fixed the 2 click drag mode ( run it with gcompris -g 2clicks).
  ++ findit: no more ask several times a missing answer at the end of the level
  ++ geo-country activity: added the italian country map with 3 sub levels, north, 
     central and south.
  ++ bar: added the keyboard shortcut ctrl-b do hide/show the GCompris control bar. 
     Now when changing the level, the sound is played before starting the activity 
     in order not to flush the own activity sound.
  ++ advanced_color: remade this activity based on the new findit engine.
  ++ details-activity: Fixed the TajMahal level. References to images was wrong.

- update to 9.6:
  + Added 2 new activities to learn to give money make in a shop. This
    is based on the money activity but now the children must give back
    money to Tux.
  + Now the erase activity reads the .jpg file in its data directory
    instead of being hardcoded. In the erase activity we have a large
    number of animal backgrounds. Now these are found at run time
    instead of being hard coded. Also the user can add its own images in
    the directory ~/My GCompris/erase.
    Added more animal images taken from wikipedia.
  + New renewable energy activity. Learn about electric dam, wind farm
    and solar panels works. This is heavily based on the watercycle
    activity.
  + In money activity, we no more auto check the answer, there is now an
    OK button Created 3 price categories in money activtiy to make the
    game more realistic.  As suggested by Arnaud Champollion, it is just
    too easy for the children.
  + improved the drawnumber activity to have its dataset taken from a
    file instead of hardcoded.  Now we have a text file named
    activity.txt that contains the images and points coordinate.
    converted .png files in .jpg in drawnumber activity to save disk
    space.

  + Fixed algebra activity to report the level properly.
  + Better error checking in case the database cannot be loaded 
    or created. Before that patch, a failure was exiting the startup 
    sequence without warning the user. Now, in case we cannot load 
    the database or it cannot be created, we follow the procedure: 
    - rename the database under the name gcompris_db.broken 
    - recreate it from scratch 
    - we failed again, fall back in no database mode. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  7 18:17:12 UTC 2010 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

  8.4.13 for all older distributions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 30 10:00:08 UTC 2009 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 8.4.13:
  + Fixed a major bug resulting in garbled string in the advanced color
    activity. In this activity the color to search was garbled in 
    American english and in case there is no translations available 
    for the running locale.
  + Now wordprocessor activity has the focus into the editing part 
    by default.
  + clickanddraw: Hide the bar as soon as the user won during the 
    bonus timeout.
  + Shapegames could crash if one tried to move an object while the 
    bonus-object (e.g. sad flower) was still shown. Fix this by 
    ensuring that the object to move or drop is the same one that 
    got dragged.
  + Shapegames: When shuffling the items for the left bar, the last 
    item was skipped. As the upper limit for random-functions is 
    exclusive, we have to pass the whole list_size, not 
    list_size - 1. Also, simplify the code.
  + Shapegames: Fix an off-by-one bug in the calculation of the amount 
    of levels, which made it possible to see the end-sequence just 
    by clicking the dice.

    (removes gcompris-8.4.11-activity_crash.patch)
  + Fixed an annoying bug in the locale selection.
    Punjabi was twice in our internal list which makes
    it impossible to access locale after Portuguese in
    our list. It was possible to access locale by going
    backward but really annoying.
    (removes gcompris-8.4.11-Punjabi.patch)

    color blinds by ASCII symbols that are locale
    agnostic.
