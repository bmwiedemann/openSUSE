- fix firstboot script: we should not go over 100% as anything that is
  after "echo 100", will just be ignored (currently, it was the cleanup)

- added an extra flatpak to Manage Extensions so a rpm based chromium or firefox browser is no longer necessary "com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager"

- Wait for Internet connectivity before proceeding with next steps.
  Before this change, the mod-firstboot script was failing when:
  * there was no network configured on the first boot (happens
    when using NetworkManager, since it's not configured by YaST
    during installation)
  * the script started before wifi connection was properly
    established
