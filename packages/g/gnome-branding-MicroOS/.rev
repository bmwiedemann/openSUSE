    <comment>- Wait for Internet connectivity before proceeding with next steps.
  Before this change, the mod-firstboot script was failing when:
  * there was no network configured on the first boot (happens
    when using NetworkManager, since it's not configured by YaST
    during installation)
  * the script started before wifi connection was properly
    established
