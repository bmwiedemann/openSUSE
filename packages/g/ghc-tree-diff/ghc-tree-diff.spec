%description
Common diff algorithm works on list structures:

' diff :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [Edit a] '

This package works on trees.

' treeDiff :: Eq a => Tree a -> Tree a -> Edit (EditTree a) '

This package also provides a way to diff arbitrary ADTs, using
'Generics'-derivable helpers.

This package differs from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gdiff gdiff>, in
a two ways: 'tree-diff' doesn't have patch function, and the "edit-script" is a
tree itself, which is useful for pretty-printing.

' >>> prettyEditExpr $ ediff (Foo 42 [True, False] "old") (Foo 42 [False,
False, True] "new") Foo {fooBool = [-True, +False, False, +True], fooInt = 42,
fooString = -"old" +"new"} '.
