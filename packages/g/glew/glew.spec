%description
The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform
open-source C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient
run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are
supported on the target platform. OpenGL core and extension
functionality is exposed in a single header file.
