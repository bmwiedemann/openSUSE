  * When standard output is /dev/null, grep no longer fails when 
    standard input is a file in the Linux /proc file system, or when
    standard input is a pipe and standard output is in append mode.
  * When grep -Fo finds matches of differing length, it could
    mistakenly print a shorter one.  Now it prints a longest one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  7 14:25:49 UTC 2016 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to grep 2.27
  * grep no longer reports a false match in a multibyte, non-UTF8 locale
    like zh_CN.gb18030, with a regular expression like ".*7" that just
    happens to match the 4-byte representation of gb18030's \uC9, the
    final byte of which is the digit "7".
  * grep by default now reads all of standard input if it is a pipe,
    even if this cannot affect grep's output or exit status.
  * grep no longer mishandles ranges in nontrivial unibyte locales.
  * grep -P no longer attempts multiline matches.
  * grep -m0 -L PAT FILE now outputs "FILE".
  * To output ':' and tab-align the following character C, grep -T no
    longer outputs tab-backspace-':'-C, an approach that has problems if
    run inside an Emacs shell window.
  * grep -T now uses worst-case widths of line numbers and byte offsets
    instead of guessing widths that might not work with larger files.
  * grep no longer reads the input in a few more cases when it is easy to
    see that matching cannot succeed, e.g., 'grep -f /dev/null'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 28 13:01:39 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- grep 2.26:
  * no longer omit output merely because it follows an output line
    suppressed due to encoding errors
  * In the Shift_JIS locale, no longer mistakenly match in the
    middle of a multibyte character
  * grep can be much faster now when standard output is /dev/null.
  * grep -F is now typically much faster when many patterns are
    given, as it now uses the Aho-Corasick algorithm instead of
    the Commentz-Walter algorithm in that case.
  * grep -iF is typically much faster in a multibyte locale, if
    the pattern and its case counterparts contain only single byte
    characters.
  * grep with complicated expressions (e.g., back-references) and
    without -i now uses the regex fastmap for better performance.
  * In multibyte locales, grep now handles leading "." in patterns
    more efficiently.
  * grep now prints a "FILENAME:LINENO: " prefix when diagnosing
    an invalid regular expression that was read from an 
   '-f'-specified file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 22 13:49:18 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- grep 2.25:
  * In the C or POSIX locale, grep now treats all bytes as valid
    characters even if the C runtime library says otherwise.
    ( Fixes yast2-users and other build failures - boo#966780 )
  * grep -oz now uses null bytes, not newlines, to terminate output
    lines.
  * grep now outputs details more consistently when reporting a
    write error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 11 09:30:02 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 2.24
  * grep -z would match strings it should not.  To trigger the bug, 
    you'd have to use a regular expression including an anchor 
    (^ or $) and a feature like a range or a backreference, causing 
    grep to forego its DFA matcher and resort to using re_search.
    With a multibyte locale, that matcher could mistakenly match a 
    string containing a newline. For example, this command: 
    printf 'a\nb\0' | LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8 grep -z '^[a-b]*b'
    would mistakenly match and print all four input bytes.  After 
    the fix, there is no match, as expected.
    [bug introduced in grep-2.7]
  * grep -Pz now diagnoses attempts to use patterns containing ^ 
    and $, instead of mishandling these patterns.  This problem 
    seems to be inherent to the PCRE API; removing this limitation 
    is on PCRE's maint/README wish list.  Patterns can continue to 
    match literal ^ and $ by escaping them with \ (now needed even 
    inside [...]). [bug introduced in grep-2.5]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  5 08:01:46 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 2.23
  * Binary files are now less likely to generate diagnostics and 
    more likely to yield text matches.  grep now reports "Binary 
    file FOO matches" and suppresses further output instead of 
    outputting a line containing an encoding error; hence grep can 
    now report matching text before a later binary match.  
    Formerly, grep reported FOO to be binary when it found an 
    encoding error in FOO before generating output for FOO, which 
    meant it never reported both matching text and matching binary 
    data; this was less useful for searching text containing 
    encoding errors in non-matching lines. [bug introduced in 
    grep-2.21]
  * grep -c no longer stops counting when finding binary data. 
    [bug introduced in grep-2.21]
  * grep no longer outputs encoding errors in unibyte locales. For 
    example, if the byte '\x81' is not a valid character in a
    unibyte locale, grep treats the byte as binary data. [bug 
    introduced in grep-2.21]
  * grep -oP is no longer susceptible to an infinite loop when 
    processing invalid UTF8 just before a match. [bug introduced in 
    grep-2.22]
  * --exclude and related options are now matched against trailing 
    parts of command-line arguments, not against the entire
    arguments. This partly reverts the --exclude-related change 
    in 2.22. [bug introduced in grep-2.22]
  * --line-buffer is no longer ineffective when combined with -l. 
    [bug introduced in grep-2.5]
  * -xw is now equivalent to -x more consistently, with -P and 
    with backrefs.  [bug only partially fixed in grep-2.19]

Fri Nov 28 15:49:19 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- GNU grep 2.21
- Improvements:
  * performance improved for searching files containing holes, on
    platforms where lseek's SEEK_DATA flag works efficiently.
  * performance improved for rejecting data that cannot match even
    the first part of a nontrivial pattern.
  * performance improved for very long strings in patterns.
  * If a file contains data improperly encoded for the current 
    locale, and this is discovered before any of the file's contents
    are output, grep now treats the file as binary.
  * -P no longer reports an error and exits when given invalid UTF-8
    data. Instead, it considers the data to be non-matching.
- Bug fixes:
  * fix issues in multibyte locales
  * grep -F -x -o no longer prints an extra newline for each match.
  * grep in a non-UTF8 multibyte locale could mistakenly match in
    the middle of a multibyte character when using a '^'-anchored
    alternate in a pattern, leading it to print non-matching lines.
  * grep -F Y no longer fails to match in non-UTF8 multibyte locales 
  * grep -E rejected unmatched ')', instead of treating it like '\)'.
   
- Changes in behavior:
  * The GREP_OPTIONS environment variable is now obsolescent
  * In locales with multibyte character encodings other than UTF-8,
    grep -P now reports an error and exits instead of misbehaving.
  * When searching binary data, grep now may treat non-text bytes as
    line terminators.  This can boost performance significantly.
  * grep -z no longer automatically treats the byte '\200' as
    binary data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  7 20:35:48 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- GNU grep 2.20
- Bug fixes:
  * grep --max-count=N FILE would no longer stop reading after the
    Nth match. I.e., while grep would still print the correct
    output, it would continue reading until end of input, and
    hence, potentially forever. [introduced in 2.19]
  * A command like echo aa|grep -E 'a(b$|c$)' would mistakenly
    report the input as a matched line. [introduced in 2.19]
- Changes in behavior:
  * grep --exclude-dir='FOO/' now excludes the directory FOO.
    Previously, the trailing slash meant the option was
    ineffective.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 24 16:50:50 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- GNU grep 2.19
- Improvements:
  * Performance has improved, typically by 10% and in some cases by
    a factor of 200.  However, performance of grep -P in UTF-8
    locales has gotten worse as part of the fix for the crashes
    mentioned below.
- Bug fixes:
  * grep no longer mishandles patterns like [a-[.z.]], and no
    longer mishandles patterns like [^a] in locales that have
    multicharacter collating sequences so that [^a] can match a
    string of two characters.
  * grep no longer mishandles an empty pattern at the end of a
    pattern list.
  * grep -C NUM now outputs separators consistently even when NUM
    is zero, and similarly for grep -A NUM and grep -B NUM.
  * grep -f no longer mishandles patterns containing NUL bytes.
  * Plain grep, grep -E, and grep -F now treat encoding errors in
    patterns the same way the GNU regular expression matcher treats
    them, with respect to whether the errors can match parts of
    multibyte characters in data.
  * grep -w no longer mishandles a potential match adjacent to a 
    letter that takes up two or more bytes in a multibyte encoding.
    Similarly, the patterns '\<', '\>', '\b', and '\B' no longer
    mishandle word-boundary matches in multibyte locales.
  * grep -P now reports an error and exits when given invalid UTF-8
    data. Previously it was unreliable, and sometimes crashed or
    looped.
  * grep -P now works with -w and -x and backreferences. Before,
    echo aa|grep -Pw '(.)\1' would fail to match, yet
    echo aa|grep -Pw '(.)\2' would match.
  * grep -Pw now works like grep -w in that the matched string has 
    to be preceded and followed by non-word components or the
    beginning and end of the line (as opposed to word boundaries
    before).  Before, this
    echo a@@a| grep -Pw @@ would match, yet this
    echo a@@a| grep -w @@ would not.  Now, they both fail to match,
    per the documentation on how grep's -w works.
  * grep -i no longer mishandles patterns containing titlecase
    characters. For example, in a locale containing the titlecase
    character 'ǈ' (U+01C8 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L WITH SMALL LETTER 
    J), 'grep -i ǈ' now matches both 'Ǉ' (U+01C7 LATIN CAPITAL
    LETTER LJ) and 'ǉ' (U+01C9 LATIN SMALL LETTER LJ).

  * grep (without -i) in a multibyte locale is now up to 7 times faster
    when processing many matched lines
  * grep's --mmap option was disabled in March of 2010, and began to
    elicit a warning in January of 2012.  Now it is completely gone.
- Reformat spec file using hints from spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  5 14:01:24 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- update to 2.16
  * Fix gnulib-provided maint.mk to report correct version number
  * The fix to make \s and \S work with multi-byte white space
    broke the use of each shortcut whenever followed by a repetition
    operator. For example, \s*, \s+, \s? and \s{3} would all
    malfunction in a multi-byte locale.
  * The fix to make grep -P work better with UTF-8 made it possible
    for grep to evoke a larger set of PCRE errors, some of which
    could trigger an abort.  E.g., this would abort:
    printf '\x82'|LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -P y
    Now grep handles arbitrary PCRE errors
  * Handle very long lines (2GiB and longer) on systems with a
    deficient read system call.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 11 20:36:13 UTC 2013 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- Update to 2.15:
  Bug fixes:
  * grep's \s and \S failed to work with multi-byte white space
    characters.
  * grep -i would segfault on systems using UTF-16-based wchar_t
    when converting an input string containing certain 4-byte UTF-8
    sequences to lower case.
  * grep -E would segfault when given a regexp like
    '([^.]*[M]){1,2}' for any multibyte character M.
  * grep -F would get stuck in an infinite loop when given a search
    string that is an invalid byte sequence in the current locale
    and that matches the bytes of the input twice on a line.  Now
    grep fails with exit status 1.
  * grep -P could misbehave.

  New features:
  * grep -P can now use a just-in-time compiler to greatly speed up
    matches, This feature is transparent to the user; no flag is
    required to enable it.  It is only available if the
    corresponding support in the PCRE library is detected when grep
    is compiled.

- Update to 2.14:
  Bug fixes:

  * grep -i '^$' could exit 0 (i.e., report a match) in a multi-byte
    locale, even though there was no match, and the command generated
    no output.  E.g., seq 2 | LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 grep -il '^$' would
    mistakenly print "(standard input)".  Related, seq 9 |
    LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 grep -in '^$' would print "2:4:6:8:10:12:14:16"
    and exit 0.  Now it prints nothing and exits with status of 1. 
    [bug introduced in grep-2.6]

  * 'grep' no longer falsely reports text files as being binary on
    file systems that compress contents or that store tiny contents
    in metadata.

- Add current German message catalog from the translation project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  5 11:27:21 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Update to 2.13:
  It's moderately important to upgrade from grep-2.6 or newer,
  since a Turkish I-with-dot (U+0130) on a matched/printed line
  makes "grep -i" (in nearly any UTF-8 locale) emit corrupt output.
  Bug fixes:
  * grep -i, in a multi-byte locale, when matching a line
    containing a character like the UTF-8 Turkish I-with-dot
    (U+0130) (whose lower-case representation occupies fewer
    bytes), would print an incomplete output line. Similarly,
    with a matched line containing a character (e.g., the Latin
    capital I in a Turkish UTF-8 locale), where the lower-case
    representation occupies more bytes, grep could print garbage.
    [bug introduced in grep-2.6]
  * --include and --exclude can again be combined, and again
    apply to the command line, e.g., "grep --include='*.[ch]'
    --exclude='system.h' PATTERN *" again reads all *.c
    and *.h files except for system.h.
    [bug introduced in grep-2.6]
  New features:
  * 'grep' without -z now treats a sparse file as binary,
    if it can easily determine that the file is sparse.
  Dropped features:
  * Bootstrapping with Makefile.boot has been broken since
    grep 2.6, and was removed.

    2.10 [bug introduced in grep-2.11]
  * grep no longer segfaults with -r --exclude-dir and no file 
    operand.  I.e., ":|grep -r --exclude-dir=D PAT" would segfault.
    [bug introduced in grep-2.11]
  * Recursive grep now uses fts for directory traversal, so it can
    handle much-larger directories without reporting things like 
    "Filename too long", and it can run much faster when dealing 
    with large directory hierarchies. [bug present since the 
    beginning]
  * grep -E 'a{1000000000}' now reports an overflow error rather 
    than silently acting like grep -E 'a\{1000000000}'.
  * The -R option now has a long-option alias --dereference-recursive.
  * The -r (--recursive) option now follows only command-line 
    symlinks. Also, by default -r now reads a device only if it is 
    named on the command line; this can be overridden with --devices.  
    -R acts as before, so use -R if you prefer the old behavior of 
    following all symlinks and defaulting to reading all devices.

Tue Mar 13 18:18:23 UTC 2012 - tabraham@novell.com

- Update to 2.11:
  * grep no longer dumps core on lines whose lengths do not fit in 
    'int'.  (e.g., lines longer than 2 GiB on a typical 64-bit host).
    Instead, grep either works as expected, or reports an error.
    An error can occur if not enough main memory is available, or if 
    the GNU C library's regular expression functions cannot handle 
    such long lines.  [bug present since "the beginning"]
  * The -m, -A, -B, and -C options no longer mishandle context line
    counts that do not fit in 'int'.  Also, grep -c's counts are now
    limited by the type 'intmax_t' (typically less than 2**63) rather
    than 'int' (typically less than 2**31).
  * grep no longer silently suppresses errors when reading a directory
    as if it were a text file.  For example, "grep x ." now reports a
    read error on most systems; formerly, it ignored the error.
    [bug introduced in grep-2.5]
  * grep now exits with status 2 if a directory loop is found, instead 
    of possibly exiting with status 0 or 1.  [bug introduced in 
    grep-2.3]
  * The -s option now suppresses certain input error diagnostics that 
    it formerly failed to suppress.  These include errors when closing 
    the input, when lseeking the input, and when the input is also the 
    output.  [bug introduced in grep-2.4]
  * On POSIX systems, commands like "grep PAT < FILE >> FILE" now report 
    an error instead of looping.  [bug present since "the beginning"]
  * The --include, --exclude, and --exclude-dir options now handle
    command-line arguments more consistently.  --include and --exclude
    apply only to non-directories and --exclude-dir applies only to
    directories.  "-" (standard input) is never excluded, since it is
    not a file name.  [bug introduced in grep-2.5]
  * grep no longer rejects "grep -qr . > out", i.e., when run with -q
    and an input file is the same as the output file, since with -q
    grep generates no output, so there is no risk of infinite loop or
    of an output-affecting race condition.  Thus, the use of the 
    following options also disables the input-equals-output failure:
      --max-count=N (-m) (for N >= 2)
      --files-with-matches (-l)
      --files-without-match (-L)
    [bug introduced in grep-2.10]
  * grep no longer emits an error message and quits on MS-Windows when
    invoked with the -r option.
  * grep no longer misinterprets some alternations involving anchors
    (^, $, \<  \>  \B, \b).  For example, grep -E "(^|\B)a" no
    longer reports a match for the string "x a".  [bug present since 
    "the beginning"]
  * If no file operand is given, and a command-line -r or equivalent
    option is given, grep now searches the working directory.  Formerly
    grep ignored the -r and searched standard input nonrecursively.
    An -r found in GREP_OPTIONS does not have this new effect.
  * grep now supports color highlighting of matches on MS-Windows.
  * Use of the --mmap option now elicits a warning.  It has been a no-op
    since March of 2010.
  * grep no longer diagnoses write errors repeatedly; it exits after
    diagnosing the first write error.  This is better behavior when
    writing to a dangling pipe.
  * Syntax errors in GREP_COLORS are now ignored, instead of sometimes
    eliciting warnings.  This is more consistent with programs that
    (e.g.) ignore errors in termcap entries.

- changes from 2.10:
  * grep no longer mishandles high-bit-set pattern bytes on systems
    where "char" is a signed type. [bug appears to affect only 
    MS-Windows]
  * On POSIX systems, grep now rejects a command like 
    "grep -r pattern . > out", in which the output file is also one 
    of the inputs, because it can result in an "infinite" disk-filling 
    loop. [bug present since "the beginning"]

- Upgrade to version 2.9 
* grep no longer clobbers heap for an ERE like '(^| )*( |$)'' )'

* grep's interpretation of range expression is now more consistent

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 24 14:47:33 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Replaced configure typo '--without-included-rege'
  in grep.spec (only in case of suse_version < 1120)
  with '--without-included-regex' (which is the default
  on systems with recent-enough version of the GNU C Library).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 23 12:47:04 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to grep-2.7 with new behavior:
  grep now diagnoses (and fails with exit status 2) commonly
  mistyped regular expression like [:space:], [:digit:], etc.
  Before, those were silently interpreted as [ac:eps]
  and [dgit:] respectively. This new behavior is disabled
  when the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set.
  Regular expressions including back references are now
  significantly faster in multi-byte locales.
  Regular expressions including "." can now be significantly
  faster in UTF-8 locales (though not in other multi-byte locales).
  Several other minor bugs were fixed.
  For details see the NEWS file.
- Adapted RPM description text to match the "Introduction to grep"
  at http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/ and removed the outdated
  Authors section, see the AUTHORS file for the right authors.
- Enhanced RPM spec file so that it builds and can be provided
  even for older openSUSE and SLES versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 22 15:45:31 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Forwarded the below "upgrade to grep-2.6.3" to openSUSE:Factory.
  This is also a reset to full compliance with upstream.
  All our own patches and "speedups" were dropped in the below
  "upgrade to grep-2.6.3" because they had bad side effects
  like bnc#618455 (SLES11-SP1) and bug#616037 (SLES9-SP4)
  which do not happen with an upstream compliant grep
  (regardless of an old version 2.5.1 or the new 2.6.3).

- On Fri Apr 9 16:43:45 CEST 2010 duwe@suse.de did a version
  upgrade to grep-2.6.3, which brings among various compile fixes
  vast improvements for UTF-8 / multibyte handling.
  Fixes bnc#255977 (SLES10-SP2) and bnc#415228 (SLES9-SP3).
