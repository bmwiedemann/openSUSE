Wed Feb  1 20:18:59 UTC 2023 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- go1.20 (released 2023-02-01) is a major release of Go.
  go1.20.x minor releases will be provided through February 2024.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.20 arrives six months after go1.19. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
  Refs boo#1206346 go1.20 release tracking
  Refs jsc#PED-1962
  * Go 1.20 includes four changes to the language
  * Language change: Go 1.17 added conversions from slice to an
    array pointer. Go 1.20 extends this to allow conversions from a
    slice to an array
  * Language change: The unsafe package defines three new functions
    SliceData, String, and StringData. Along with Go 1.17's Slice,
    these functions now provide the complete ability to construct
    and deconstruct slice and string values, without depending on
    their exact representation.
  * Language change: The specification now defines that struct
    values are compared one field at a time, considering fields in
    the order they appear in the struct type definition, and
    stopping at the first mismatch. The specification could
    previously have been read as if all fields needed to be
    compared beyond the first mismatch. Similarly, the
    specification now defines that array values are compared one
    element at a time, in increasing index order. In both cases,
    the difference affects whether certain comparisons must
    panic. Existing programs are unchanged: the new spec wording
    describes what the implementations have always done.
  * Language change: Comparable types (such as ordinary interfaces)
    may now satisfy comparable constraints, even if the type
    arguments are not strictly comparable (comparison may panic at
    runtime). This makes it possible to instantiate a type
    parameter constrained by comparable (e.g., a type parameter for
    a user-defined generic map key) with a non-strictly comparable
    type argument such as an interface type, or a composite type
    containing an interface type.
  * go command: The directory $GOROOT/pkg no longer stores
    pre-compiled package archives for the standard library: go
    install no longer writes them, the go build no longer checks
    for them, and the Go distribution no longer ships
    them. Instead, packages in the standard library are built as
    needed and cached in the build cache, just like packages
    outside GOROOT. This change reduces the size of the Go
    distribution and also avoids C toolchain skew for packages that
    use cgo. Refs jsc#PED-1962
  * go command: The implementation of go test -json has been
    improved to make it more robust. Programs that run go test
    -json do not need any updates. Programs that invoke go tool
    test2json directly should now run the test binary with
    -v=test2json (for example, go test -v=test2json or ./pkg.test
    -test.v=test2json) instead of plain -v.
  * go command: A related change to go test -json is the addition
    of an event with Action set to start at the beginning of each
    test program's execution. When running multiple tests using the
    go command, these start events are guaranteed to be emitted in
    the same order as the packages named on the command line.
  * go command: The go command now defines architecture feature
    build tags, such as amd64.v2, to allow selecting a package
    implementation file based on the presence or absence of a
    particular architecture feature. See go help buildconstraint
    for details.
  * go command: The go subcommands now accept -C <dir> to change
    directory to <dir> before performing the command, which may be
    useful for scripts that need to execute commands in multiple
    different modules.
  * go command: The go build and go test commands no longer accept
    the -i flag, which has been deprecated since Go 1.16.
  * go command: The go generate command now accepts -skip <pattern>
    to skip //go:generate directives matching <pattern>.
  * go command: The go test command now accepts -skip <pattern> to
    skip tests, subtests, or examples matching <pattern>.
  * go command: When the main module is located within GOPATH/src,
    go install no longer installs libraries for non-main packages
    to GOPATH/pkg, and go list no longer reports a Target field for
    such packages. (In module mode, compiled packages are stored in
    the build cache only, but a bug had caused the GOPATH install
    targets to unexpectedly remain in effect.)
  * go command: The go build, go install, and other build-related
    commands now support a -pgo flag that enables profile-guided
    optimization, which is described in more detail in the Compiler
    section below. The -pgo flag specifies the file path of the
    profile. Specifying -pgo=auto causes the go command to search
    for a file named default.pgo in the main package's directory
    and use it if present. This mode currently requires a single
    main package to be specified on the command line, but we plan
    to lift this restriction in a future release. Specifying
    -pgo=off turns off profile-guided optimization.
  * go command: The go build, go install, and other build-related
    commands now support a -cover flag that builds the specified
    target with code coverage instrumentation. This is described in
    more detail in the Cover section below.
  * go version: The go version -m command now supports reading more
    types of Go binaries, most notably, Windows DLLs built with go
    build -buildmode=c-shared and Linux binaries without execute
    permission.
  * Cgo: The go command now disables cgo by default on systems
    without a C toolchain. More specifically, when the CGO_ENABLED
    environment variable is unset, the CC environment variable is
    unset, and the default C compiler (typically clang or gcc) is
    not found in the path, CGO_ENABLED defaults to 0. As always,
    you can override the default by setting CGO_ENABLED explicitly.
    The most important effect of the default change is that when Go
    is installed on a system without a C compiler, it will now use
    pure Go builds for packages in the standard library that use
    cgo, instead of using pre-distributed package archives (which
    have been removed, as noted above) or attempting to use cgo and
    failing. This makes Go work better in some minimal container
    environments as well as on macOS, where pre-distributed package
    archives have not been used for cgo-based packages since Go
    1.16.
    The packages in the standard library that use cgo are net,
    os/user, and plugin. On macOS, the net and os/user packages
    have been rewritten not to use cgo: the same code is now used
    for cgo and non-cgo builds as well as cross-compiled builds. On
    Windows, the net and os/user packages have never used cgo. On
    other systems, builds with cgo disabled will use a pure Go
    version of these packages.
    On macOS, the race detector has been rewritten not to use cgo:
    race-detector-enabled programs can be built and run without
    Xcode. On Linux and other Unix systems, and on Windows, a host
    C toolchain is required to use the race detector.
  * go cover: Go 1.20 supports collecting code coverage profiles
    for programs (applications and integration tests), as opposed
    to just unit tests. To collect coverage data for a program,
    build it with go build's -cover flag, then run the resulting
    binary with the environment variable GOCOVERDIR set to an
    output directory for coverage profiles. See the 'coverage for
    integration tests' landing page for more on how to get
    started. For details on the design and implementation, see the
    proposal.
  * go vet: Improved detection of loop variable capture by nested
    functions. The vet tool now reports references to loop
    variables following a call to T.Parallel() within subtest
    function bodies. Such references may observe the value of the
    variable from a different iteration (typically causing test
    cases to be skipped) or an invalid state due to unsynchronized
    concurrent access.
  * go vet: The tool also detects reference mistakes in more
    places. Previously it would only consider the last statement
    of the loop body, but now it recursively inspects the last
    statements within if, switch, and select statements.
  * go vet: New diagnostic for incorrect time formats. The vet tool
    now reports use of the time format 2006-02-01 (yyyy-dd-mm) with
    Time.Format and time.Parse. This format does not appear in
    common date standards, but is frequently used by mistake when
    attempting to use the ISO 8601 date format (yyyy-mm-dd).
  * Runtime: Some of the garbage collector's internal data
    structures were reorganized to be both more space and CPU
    efficient. This change reduces memory overheads and improves
    overall CPU performance by up to 2%.
  * Runtime: The garbage collector behaves less erratically with
    respect to goroutine assists in some circumstances.
  * Runtime: Go 1.20 adds a new runtime/coverage package containing
    APIs for writing coverage profile data at runtime from
    long-running and/or server programs that do not terminate via
    os.Exit().
  * Compiler: Go 1.20 adds preview support for profile-guided
    optimization (PGO). PGO enables the toolchain to perform
    application- and workload-specific optimizations based on
    run-time profile information. Currently, the compiler supports
    pprof CPU profiles, which can be collected through usual means,
    such as the runtime/pprof or net/http/pprof packages. To enable
    PGO, pass the path of a pprof profile file via the -pgo flag to
    go build, as mentioned above. Go 1.20 uses PGO to more
    aggressively inline functions at hot call sites. Benchmarks for
    a representative set of Go programs show enabling
    profile-guided inlining optimization improves performance about
    3–4%. See the PGO user guide for detailed documentation. We
    plan to add more profile-guided optimizations in future
    releases. Note that profile-guided optimization is a preview,
    so please use it with appropriate caution.
  * Compiler: The Go 1.20 compiler upgraded its front-end to use a
    new way of handling the compiler's internal data, which fixes
    several generic-types issues and enables type declarations
    within generic functions and methods.
  * Compiler: The compiler now rejects anonymous interface cycles
    with a compiler error by default. These arise from tricky uses
    of embedded interfaces and have always had subtle correctness
    issues, yet we have no evidence that they're actually used in
    practice. Assuming no reports from users adversely affected by
    this change, we plan to update the language specification for
    Go 1.22 to formally disallow them so tools authors can stop
    supporting them too.
  * Compiler: Go 1.18 and 1.19 saw regressions in build speed,
    largely due to the addition of support for generics and
    follow-on work. Go 1.20 improves build speeds by up to 10%,
    bringing it back in line with Go 1.17. Relative to Go 1.19,
    generated code performance is also generally slightly improved.
  * Linker: On Linux, the linker now selects the dynamic
    interpreter for glibc or musl at link time.
  * Linker: On Windows, the Go linker now supports modern
    LLVM-based C toolchains.
  * Linker: Go 1.20 uses go: and type: prefixes for
    compiler-generated symbols rather than go. and type.. This
    avoids confusion for user packages whose name starts with
    go.. The debug/gosym package understands this new naming
    convention for binaries built with Go 1.20 and newer.
  * Bootstrap: When building a Go release from source and
    GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP is not set, previous versions of Go looked for
    a Go 1.4 or later bootstrap toolchain in the directory
    $HOME/go1.4 (%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\go1.4 on Windows). Go 1.18
    and Go 1.19 looked first for $HOME/go1.17 or $HOME/sdk/go1.17
    before falling back to $HOME/go1.4, in anticipation of
    requiring Go 1.17 for use when bootstrapping Go 1.20. Go 1.20
    does require a Go 1.17 release for bootstrapping, but we
    realized that we should adopt the latest point release of the
    bootstrap toolchain, so it requires Go 1.17.13. Go 1.20 looks
    for $HOME/go1.17.13 or $HOME/sdk/go1.17.13 before falling back
    to $HOME/go1.4 (to support systems that hard-coded the path
    $HOME/go1.4 but have installed a newer Go toolchain there). In
    the future, we plan to move the bootstrap toolchain forward
    approximately once a year, and in particular we expect that Go
    1.22 will require the final point release of Go 1.20 for
    bootstrap.
  * Library: Go 1.20 adds a new crypto/ecdh package to provide
    explicit support for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key
    exchanges over NIST curves and Curve25519. Programs should use
    crypto/ecdh instead of the lower-level functionality in
    crypto/elliptic for ECDH, and third-party modules for more
    advanced use cases.
  * Error handling: Go 1.20 expands support for error wrapping to
    permit an error to wrap multiple other errors.
  * Error handling: An error e can wrap more than one error by
    providing an Unwrap method that returns a []error.
  * Error handling: The errors.Is and errors.As functions have been
    updated to inspect multiply wrapped errors.
  * Error handling: The fmt.Errorf function now supports multiple
    occurrences of the %w format verb, which will cause it to
    return an error that wraps all of those error operands.
  * Error handling: The new function errors.Join returns an error
    wrapping a list of errors.
  * HTTP ResponseController: The new "net/http".ResponseController
    type provides access to extended per-request functionality not
    handled by the "net/http".ResponseWriter interface. The
    ResponseController type provides a clearer, more discoverable
    way to add per-handler controls. Two such controls also added
    in Go 1.20 are SetReadDeadline and SetWriteDeadline, which
    allow setting per-request read and write deadlines.
  * New ReverseProxy Rewrite hook: The httputil.ReverseProxy
    forwarding proxy includes a new Rewrite hook function,
    superseding the previous Director hook.
  * archive/tar: When the GODEBUG=tarinsecurepath=0 environment
    variable is set, Reader.Next method will now return the error
    ErrInsecurePath for an entry with a file name that is an
    absolute path, refers to a location outside the current
    directory, contains invalid characters, or (on Windows) is a
    reserved name such as NUL. A future version of Go may disable
    insecure paths by default.
  * archive/zip: When the GODEBUG=zipinsecurepath=0 environment
    variable is set, NewReader will now return the error
    ErrInsecurePath when opening an archive which contains any file
    name that is an absolute path, refers to a location outside the
    current directory, contains invalid characters, or (on Windows)
    is a reserved names such as NUL. A future version of Go may
    disable insecure paths by default.
  * archive/zip: Reading from a directory file that contains file
    data will now return an error. The zip specification does not
    permit directory files to contain file data, so this change
    only affects reading from invalid archives.
  * bytes: The new CutPrefix and CutSuffix functions are like
    TrimPrefix and TrimSuffix but also report whether the string
    was trimmed.
  * bytes: The new Clone function allocates a copy of a byte slice.
  * context: The new WithCancelCause function provides a way to
    cancel a context with a given error. That error can be
    retrieved by calling the new Cause function.
  * crypto/ecdsa: When using supported curves, all operations are
    now implemented in constant time. This led to an increase in
    CPU time between 5% and 30%, mostly affecting P-384 and P-521.
  * crypto/ecdsa: The new PrivateKey.ECDH method converts an
    ecdsa.PrivateKey to an ecdh.PrivateKey.
  * crypto/ed25519: The PrivateKey.Sign method and the
    VerifyWithOptions function now support signing pre-hashed
    messages with Ed25519ph, indicated by an Options.HashFunc that
    returns crypto.SHA512. They also now support Ed25519ctx and
    Ed25519ph with context, indicated by setting the new
    Options.Context field.
  * crypto/rsa: The new field OAEPOptions.MGFHash allows
    configuring the MGF1 hash separately for OAEP decryption.
  * crypto/rsa: crypto/rsa now uses a new, safer, constant-time
    backend. This causes a CPU runtime increase for decryption
    operations between approximately 15% (RSA-2048 on amd64) and
    45% (RSA-4096 on arm64), and more on 32-bit
    architectures. Encryption operations are approximately 20x
    slower than before (but still 5-10x faster than
    decryption). Performance is expected to improve in future
    releases. Programs must not modify or manually generate the
    fields of PrecomputedValues.
  * crypto/subtle: The new function XORBytes XORs two byte slices
    together.
  * crypto/tls: Parsed certificates are now shared across all
    clients actively using that certificate. The memory savings can
    be significant in programs that make many concurrent
    connections to a server or collection of servers sharing any
    part of their certificate chains.
  * crypto/tls: For a handshake failure due to a certificate
    verification failure, the TLS client and server now return an
    error of the new type CertificateVerificationError, which
    includes the presented certificates.
  * crypto/x509: ParsePKCS8PrivateKey and MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey
    now support keys of type *crypto/ecdh.PrivateKey.
    ParsePKIXPublicKey and MarshalPKIXPublicKey now support keys of
    type *crypto/ecdh.PublicKey. Parsing NIST curve keys still
    returns values of type *ecdsa.PublicKey and *ecdsa.PrivateKey.
    Use their new ECDH methods to convert to the crypto/ecdh types.
  * crypto/x509: The new SetFallbackRoots function allows a program
    to define a set of fallback root certificates in case an
    operating system verifier or standard platform root bundle is
    unavailable at runtime. It will most commonly be used with a
    new package, golang.org/x/crypto/x509roots/fallback, which will
    provide an up to date root bundle.
  * debug/elf: Attempts to read from a SHT_NOBITS section using
    Section.Data or the reader returned by Section.Open now return
    an error.
  * debug/elf: Additional R_LARCH_* constants are defined for use
    with LoongArch systems.
  * debug/elf: Additional R_PPC64_* constants are defined for use
    with PPC64 ELFv2 relocations.
  * debug/elf: The constant value for R_PPC64_SECTOFF_LO_DS is
    corrected, from 61 to 62.
  * debug/gosym: Due to a change of Go's symbol naming conventions,
    tools that process Go binaries should use Go 1.20's debug/gosym
    package to transparently handle both old and new binaries.
  * debug/pe: Additional IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_RISCV* constants are
    defined for use with RISC-V systems.
  * encoding/binary: The ReadVarint and ReadUvarint functions will
    now return io.ErrUnexpectedEOF after reading a partial value,
    rather than io.EOF.
  * encoding/xml: The new Encoder.Close method can be used to check
    for unclosed elements when finished encoding.
  * encoding/xml: The decoder now rejects element and attribute
    names with more than one colon, such as <a:b:c>, as well as
    namespaces that resolve to an empty string, such as xmlns:a="".
  * encoding/xml: The decoder now rejects elements that use
    different namespace prefixes in the opening and closing tag,
    even if those prefixes both denote the same namespace.
  * errors: The new Join function returns an error wrapping a list
    of errors.
  * fmt: The Errorf function supports multiple occurrences of the
    %w format verb, returning an error that unwraps to the list of
    all arguments to %w.
  * fmt: The new FormatString function recovers the formatting
    directive corresponding to a State, which can be useful in
    Formatter. implementations.
  * go/ast: The new RangeStmt.Range field records the position of
    the range keyword in a range statement.
  * go/ast: The new File.FileStart and File.FileEnd fields record
    the position of the start and end of the entire source file.
  * go/token: The new FileSet.RemoveFile method removes a file from
    a FileSet. Long-running programs can use this to release memory
    associated with files they no longer need.
  * go/types: The new Satisfies function reports whether a type
    satisfies a constraint. This change aligns with the new
    language semantics that distinguish satisfying a constraint
    from implementing an interface.
  * io: The new OffsetWriter wraps an underlying WriterAt and
    provides Seek, Write, and WriteAt methods that adjust their
    effective file offset position by a fixed amount.
  * io/fs: The new error SkipAll terminates a WalkDir immediately
    but successfully.
  * math/big: The math/big package's wide scope and input-dependent
    timing make it ill-suited for implementing cryptography. The
    cryptography packages in the standard library no longer call
    non-trivial Int methods on attacker-controlled inputs. In the
    future, the determination of whether a bug in math/big is
    considered a security vulnerability will depend on its wider
    impact on the standard library.
  * math/rand: The math/rand package now automatically seeds the
    global random number generator (used by top-level functions
    like Float64 and Int) with a random value, and the top-level
    Seed function has been deprecated. Programs that need a
    reproducible sequence of random numbers should prefer to
    allocate their own random source, using
    rand.New(rand.NewSource(seed)).
  * math/rand: Programs that need the earlier consistent global
    seeding behavior can set GODEBUG=randautoseed=0 in their
    environment.
  * math/rand: The top-level Read function has been deprecated. In
    almost all cases, crypto/rand.Read is more appropriate.
  * mime: The ParseMediaType function now allows duplicate
    parameter names, so long as the values of the names are the
    same.
  * mime/multipart: Methods of the Reader type now wrap errors
    returned by the underlying io.Reader.
  * net: The LookupCNAME function now consistently returns the
    contents of a CNAME record when one exists. Previously on Unix
    systems and when using the pure Go resolver, LookupCNAME would
    return an error if a CNAME record referred to a name that with
    no A, AAAA, or CNAME record. This change modifies LookupCNAME
    to match the previous behavior on Windows, allowing LookupCNAME
    to succeed whenever a CNAME exists.
  * net: Interface.Flags now includes the new flag FlagRunning,
    indicating an operationally active interface. An interface
    which is administratively configured but not active (for
    example, because the network cable is not connected) will have
    FlagUp set but not FlagRunning.
  * net: The new Dialer.ControlContext field contains a callback
    function similar to the existing Dialer.Control hook, that
    additionally accepts the dial context as a parameter. Control
    is ignored when ControlContext is not nil.
  * net: The Go DNS resolver recognizes the trust-ad resolver
    option. When options trust-ad is set in resolv.conf, the Go
    resolver will set the AD bit in DNS queries. The resolver does
    not make use of the AD bit in responses.
  * net: DNS resolution will detect changes to /etc/nsswitch.conf
    and reload the file when it changes. Checks are made at most
    once every five seconds, matching the previous handling of
    /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf.
  * net/http: The ResponseWriter.WriteHeader function now supports
    sending 1xx status codes.
  * net/http: The new Server.DisableGeneralOptionsHandler
    configuration setting allows disabling the default OPTIONS *
    handler.
  * net/http: The new Transport.OnProxyConnectResponse hook is
    called when a Transport receives an HTTP response from a proxy
    for a CONNECT request.
  * net/http: The HTTP server now accepts HEAD requests containing
    a body, rather than rejecting them as invalid.
  * net/http: HTTP/2 stream errors returned by net/http functions
    may be converted to a golang.org/x/net/http2.StreamError using
    errors.As.
  * net/http: Leading and trailing spaces are trimmed from cookie
    names, rather than being rejected as invalid. For example, a
    cookie setting of "name =value" is now accepted as setting the
    cookie "name".
  * net/netip: The new IPv6LinkLocalAllRouters and IPv6Loopback
    functions are the net/netip equivalents of net.IPv6loopback and
    net.IPv6linklocalallrouters.
  * os: On Windows, the name NUL is no longer treated as a special
    case in Mkdir and Stat.
  * os: On Windows, File.Stat now uses the file handle to retrieve
    attributes when the file is a directory. Previously it would
    use the path passed to Open, which may no longer be the file
    represented by the file handle if the file has been moved or
    replaced. This change modifies Open to open directories without
    the FILE_SHARE_DELETE access, which match the behavior of
    regular files.
  * os: On Windows, File.Seek now supports seeking to the beginning
    of a directory.
  * os/exec: The new Cmd fields Cancel and WaitDelay specify the
    behavior of the Cmd when its associated Context is canceled or
    its process exits with I/O pipes still held open by a child
    process.
  * path/filepath: The new error SkipAll terminates a Walk
    immediately but successfully.
  * path/filepath: The new IsLocal function reports whether a path
    is lexically local to a directory. For example, if IsLocal(p)
    is true, then Open(p) will refer to a file that is lexically
    within the subtree rooted at the current directory.
  * reflect: The new Value.Comparable and Value.Equal methods can
    be used to compare two Values for equality. Comparable reports
    whether Equal is a valid operation for a given Value receiver.
  * reflect: The new Value.Grow method extends a slice to guarantee
    space for another n elements.
  * reflect: The new Value.SetZero method sets a value to be the
    zero value for its type.
  * reflect: Go 1.18 introduced Value.SetIterKey and
    Value.SetIterValue methods. These are optimizations:
    v.SetIterKey(it) is meant to be equivalent to
    v.Set(it.Key()). The implementations incorrectly omitted a
    check for use of unexported fields that was present in the
    unoptimized forms. Go 1.20 corrects these methods to include
    the unexported field check.
  * regexp: Go 1.19.2 and Go 1.18.7 included a security fix to the
    regular expression parser, making it reject very large
    expressions that would consume too much memory. Because Go
    patch releases do not introduce new API, the parser returned
    syntax.ErrInternalError in this case. Go 1.20 adds a more
    specific error, syntax.ErrLarge, which the parser now returns
    instead.
  * runtime/cgo: Go 1.20 adds new Incomplete marker type. Code
    generated by cgo will use cgo.Incomplete to mark an incomplete
    C type.
  * runtime/metrics: Go 1.20 adds new supported metrics, including
    the current GOMAXPROCS setting (/sched/gomaxprocs:threads), the
    number of cgo calls executed (/cgo/go-to-c-calls:calls), total
    mutex block time (/sync/mutex/wait/total:seconds), and various
    measures of time spent in garbage collection.
  * runtime/metrics: Time-based histogram metrics are now less
    precise, but take up much less memory.
  * runtime/pprof: Mutex profile samples are now pre-scaled, fixing
    an issue where old mutex profile samples would be scaled
    incorrectly if the sampling rate changed during execution.
  * runtime/pprof: Profiles collected on Windows now include memory
    mapping information that fixes symbolization issues for
    position-independent binaries.
  * runtime/trace: The garbage collector's background sweeper now
    yields less frequently, resulting in many fewer extraneous
    events in execution traces.
  * strings: The new CutPrefix and CutSuffix functions are like
    TrimPrefix and TrimSuffix but also report whether the string
    was trimmed.
  * sync: The new Map methods Swap, CompareAndSwap, and
    CompareAndDelete allow existing map entries to be updated
    atomically.
  * syscall: On FreeBSD, compatibility shims needed for FreeBSD 11
    and earlier have been removed.
  * syscall: On Linux, additional CLONE_* constants are defined for
    use with the SysProcAttr.Cloneflags field.
  * syscall: On Linux, the new SysProcAttr.CgroupFD and
    SysProcAttr.UseCgroupFD fields provide a way to place a child
    process into a specific cgroup.
  * testing: The new method B.Elapsed reports the current elapsed
    time of the benchmark, which may be useful for calculating
    rates to report with ReportMetric.
  * time: The new time layout constants DateTime, DateOnly, and
    TimeOnly provide names for three of the most common layout
    strings used in a survey of public Go source code.
  * time: The new Time.Compare method compares two times.
  * time: Parse now ignores sub-nanosecond precision in its input,
    instead of reporting those digits as an error.
  * time: The Time.MarshalJSON method is now more strict about
    adherence to RFC 3339.
  * unicode/utf16: The new AppendRune function appends the UTF-16
    encoding of a given rune to a uint16 slice, analogous to
    utf8.AppendRune.
