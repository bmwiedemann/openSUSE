- Update lua to version 2.2.1.
  ## lua-2.2.1

  Released 2022-06-19.

  -   Make string-peeking independent of the current foreign
      encoding: always use char8 encoding to retrieve values of
      `LUA_PRELOAD_TABLE` and `LUA_LOADED_TABLE`.

- Update lua to version 2.2.0.
  ## lua-2.2.0

  Released 2022-02-19.

  -   Update to Lua 5.4, include Lua 5.4.4 by default.

  -   Removed `hardcode-reg-keys` flag: this is no longer required
      for Lua 5.4.

  -   Support arbitrary number of uservalues: Lua 5.4 allows an
      arbitrary number of uservalues to be associated with userdata
      objects. The functions `lua_newuserdata`, `lua_getuservalue`,
      and `lua_setuservalue` are replaced with the new functions
      `lua_newuserdatauv`, `lua_getiuservalue`, and
      `lua_setiuservalue`, respectively.

      The function `hslua_newhsuserdata` is renamed to
      `hslua_newhsuserdatauv` and takes the number of associated
      uservalues as an additional argument.

  -   Support for the new warnings system: export binding to
      `lua_warning`.

  -   The function `lua_gc` now takes three data arguments of type
      CInt. This is a workaround for the fact that the C function
      has become variadic.

  -   The new patterns `LUA_GCGEN` and `LUA_GCINC` are usable with
      `lua_gc` to switch to generational and incremental garbage
      collection, respectively.
