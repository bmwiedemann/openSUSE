- go1.18 (released 2022-03-15) is a major release of Go.
  go1.18.x minor releases will be provided through February 2023.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  Go 1.18 is a significant release, including changes to the
  language, implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. Go 1.18 arrives seven months after Go 1.17. As always,
  the release maintains the Go 1 promise of compatibility. We
  expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as
  before.
  Refs boo#1193742 go1.18 release tracking
  * See release notes https://golang.org/doc/go1.18. Excerpts
    relevant to OBS environment and for SUSE/openSUSE follow:
  * Go 1.18 includes an implementation of generic features as
    described by the Type Parameters Proposal. This includes major
    but fully backward-compatible changes to the language.
  * The Go 1.18 compiler now correctly reports declared but not
    used errors for variables that are set inside a function
    literal but are never used. Before Go 1.18, the compiler did
    not report an error in such cases. This fixes long-outstanding
    compiler issue go#8560.
  * The Go 1.18 compiler now reports an overflow when passing a
    rune constant expression such as '1' << 32 as an argument to
    the predeclared functions print and println, consistent with
    the behavior of user-defined functions. Before Go 1.18, the
    compiler did not report an error in such cases but silently
    accepted such constant arguments if they fit into an
    int64. Since go vet always pointed out this error, the number
    of affected programs is likely very small.
  * AMD64: Go 1.18 introduces the new GOAMD64 environment variable,
    which selects at compile time a minimum target version of the
    AMD64 architecture. Allowed values are v1, v2, v3, or v4. Each
    higher level requires, and takes advantage of, additional
    processor features. A detailed description can be found
    here. The GOAMD64 environment variable defaults to v1.
  * RISC-V: The 64-bit RISC-V architecture on Linux (the
    linux/riscv64 port) now supports the c-archive and c-shared
    build modes.
  * Linux: Go 1.18 requires Linux kernel version 2.6.32 or later.
  * Fuzzing: Go 1.18 includes an implementation of fuzzing as
    described by the fuzzing proposal. See the fuzzing landing page
    to get started. Please be aware that fuzzing can consume a lot
    of memory and may impact your machine’s performance while it
    runs.
  * go get: go get no longer builds or installs packages in
    module-aware mode. go get is now dedicated to adjusting
    dependencies in go.mod. Effectively, the -d flag is always
    enabled. To install the latest version of an executable outside
    the context of the current module, use go install
    example.com/cmd@latest. Any version query may be used instead
    of latest. This form of go install was added in Go 1.16, so
    projects supporting older versions may need to provide install
    instructions for both go install and go get. go get now reports
    an error when used outside a module, since there is no go.mod
    file to update. In GOPATH mode (with GO111MODULE=off), go get
    still builds and installs packages, as before.
  * Automatic go.mod and go.sum updates: The go mod graph, go mod
    vendor, go mod verify, and go mod why subcommands no longer
    automatically update the go.mod and go.sum files. (Those files
    can be updated explicitly using go get, go mod tidy, or go mod
    download.)
  * go version: The go command now embeds version control
    information in binaries. It includes the currently checked-out
    revision, commit time, and a flag indicating whether edited or
    untracked files are present. Version control information is
    embedded if the go command is invoked in a directory within a
    Git, Mercurial, Fossil, or Bazaar repository, and the main
    package and its containing main module are in the same
    repository. This information may be omitted using the flag
    -buildvcs=false. Additionally, the go command embeds
    information about the build, including build and tool tags (set
    with -tags), compiler, assembler, and linker flags (like
    -gcflags), whether cgo was enabled, and if it was, the values
    of the cgo environment variables (like CGO_CFLAGS). Both VCS
    and build information may be read together with module
    information using go version -m file or
    runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo (for the currently running binary)
    or the new debug/buildinfo package. The underlying data format
    of the embedded build information can change with new go
    releases, so an older version of go may not handle the build
    information produced with a newer version of go. To read the
    version information from a binary built with go 1.18, use the
    go version command and the debug/buildinfo package from go
    1.18+.
  * go mod download: If the main module's go.mod file specifies go
    1.17 or higher, go mod download without arguments now downloads
    source code for only the modules explicitly required in the
    main module's go.mod file. (In a go 1.17 or higher module, that
    set already includes all dependencies needed to build the
    packages and tests in the main module.) To also download source
    code for transitive dependencies, use go mod download all.
  * go mod vendor: The go mod vendor subcommand now supports a -o
    flag to set the output directory. (Other go commands still read
    from the vendor directory at the module root when loading
    packages with -mod=vendor, so the main use for this flag is for
    third-party tools that need to collect package source code.)
  * go mod tidy: The go mod tidy command now retains additional
    checksums in the go.sum file for modules whose source code is
    needed to verify that each imported package is provided by only
    one module in the build list. Because this condition is rare
    and failure to apply it results in a build error, this change
    is not conditioned on the go version in the main module's
    go.mod file.
  * go work: The go command now supports a "Workspace" mode. If a
    go.work file is found in the working directory or a parent
    directory, or one is specified using the GOWORK environment
    variable, it will put the go command into workspace mode. In
    workspace mode, the go.work file will be used to determine the
    set of main modules used as the roots for module resolution,
    instead of using the normally-found go.mod file to specify the
    single main module. For more information see the go work
    documentation.
  * go build -asan: The go build command and related commands now
    support an -asan flag that enables interoperation with C (or
    C++) code compiled with the address sanitizer (C compiler
    option -fsanitize=address).
  * //go:build lines: Go 1.17 introduced //go:build lines as a more
    readable way to write build constraints, instead of // +build
    lines. As of Go 1.17, gofmt adds //go:build lines to match
    existing +build lines and keeps them in sync, while go vet
    diagnoses when they are out of sync. Since the release of Go
    1.18 marks the end of support for Go 1.16, all supported
    versions of Go now understand //go:build lines. In Go 1.18, go
    fix now removes the now-obsolete // +build lines in modules
    declaring go 1.17 or later in their go.mod files. For more
    information, see https://go.dev/design/draft-gobuild.
  * go vet: The vet tool is updated to support generic code. In
    most cases, it reports an error in generic code whenever it
    would report an error in the equivalent non-generic code after
    substituting for type parameters with a type from their type
    set.
  * go vet: The cmd/vet checkers copylock, printf, sortslice,
    testinggoroutine, and tests have all had moderate precision
    improvements to handle additional code patterns. This may lead
    to newly reported errors in existing packages.
  * Runtime: The garbage collector now includes non-heap sources of
    garbage collector work (e.g., stack scanning) when determining
    how frequently to run. As a result, garbage collector overhead
    is more predictable when these sources are significant. For
    most applications these changes will be negligible; however,
    some Go applications may now use less memory and spend more
    time on garbage collection, or vice versa, than before. The
    intended workaround is to tweak GOGC where necessary. The
    runtime now returns memory to the operating system more
    efficiently and has been tuned to work more aggressively as a
    result.
  * Compiler: Go 1.17 implemented a new way of passing function
    arguments and results using registers instead of the stack on
    64-bit x86 architecture on selected operating systems. Go 1.18
    expands the supported platforms to include 64-bit ARM
    (GOARCH=arm64), big- and little-endian 64-bit PowerPC
    (GOARCH=ppc64, ppc64le), as well as 64-bit x86 architecture
    (GOARCH=amd64) on all operating systems. On 64-bit ARM and
    64-bit PowerPC systems, benchmarking shows typical performance
    improvements of 10% or more. As mentioned in the Go 1.17
    release notes, this change does not affect the functionality of
    any safe Go code and is designed to have no impact on most
    assembly code. See the Go 1.17 release notes for more details.
  * Compiler: The compiler now can inline functions that contain
    range loops or labeled for loops.
  * Compiler: The new -asan compiler option supports the new go
    command -asan option.
  * Compiler: Because the compiler's type checker was replaced in
    its entirety to support generics, some error messages now may
    use different wording than before. In some cases, pre-Go 1.18
    error messages provided more detail or were phrased in a more
    helpful way. We intend to address these cases in Go
    1.19. Because of changes in the compiler related to supporting
    generics, the Go 1.18 compile speed can be roughly 15% slower
    than the Go 1.17 compile speed. The execution time of the
    compiled code is not affected. We intend to improve the speed
    of the compiler in Go 1.19.
  * Linker: The linker emits far fewer relocations. As a result,
    most codebases will link faster, require less memory to link,
    and generate smaller binaries. Tools that process Go binaries
    should use Go 1.18's debug/gosym package to transparently
    handle both old and new binaries.
  * Linker: The new -asan linker option supports the new go command
    -asan option.
  * Bootstrap: When building a Go release from source and
    GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP is not set, previous versions of Go looked for
    a Go 1.4 or later bootstrap toolchain in the directory
    $HOME/go1.4 (%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\go1.4 on Windows). Go now
    looks first for $HOME/go1.17 or $HOME/sdk/go1.17 before falling
    back to $HOME/go1.4. We intend for Go 1.19 to require Go 1.17
    or later for bootstrap, and this change should make the
    transition smoother. For more details, see go#44505.
  * The new debug/buildinfo package provides access to module
    versions, version control information, and build flags embedded
    in executable files built by the go command. The same
    information is also available via runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo
    for the currently running binary and via go version -m on the
    command line.
  * The new net/netip package defines a new IP address type,
    Addr. Compared to the existing net.IP type, the netip.Addr type
    takes less memory, is immutable, and is comparable so it
    supports == and can be used as a map key.
  * TLS 1.0 and 1.1 disabled by default client-side: If
    Config.MinVersion is not set, it now defaults to TLS 1.2 for
    client connections. Any safely up-to-date server is expected to
    support TLS 1.2, and browsers have required it since 2020. TLS
    1.0 and 1.1 are still supported by setting Config.MinVersion to
    VersionTLS10. The server-side default is unchanged at TLS
    1.0. The default can be temporarily reverted to TLS 1.0 by
    setting the GODEBUG=tls10default=1 environment variable. This
    option will be removed in Go 1.19.
  * Rejecting SHA-1 certificates: crypto/x509 will now reject
    certificates signed with the SHA-1 hash function. This doesn't
    apply to self-signed root certificates. Practical attacks
    against SHA-1 have been demonstrated since 2017 and publicly
    trusted Certificate Authorities have not issued SHA-1
    certificates since 2015. This can be temporarily reverted by
    setting the GODEBUG=x509sha1=1 environment variable. This
    option will be removed in Go 1.19.
  * crypto/elliptic The P224, P384, and P521 curve implementations
    are now all backed by code generated by the addchain and
    fiat-crypto projects, the latter of which is based on a
    formally-verified model of the arithmetic operations. They now
    use safer complete formulas and internal APIs. P-224 and P-384
    are now approximately four times faster. All specific curve
    implementations are now constant-time. Operating on invalid
    curve points (those for which the IsOnCurve method returns
    false, and which are never returned by Unmarshal or a Curve
    method operating on a valid point) has always been undefined
    behavior, can lead to key recovery attacks, and is now
    unsupported by the new backend. If an invalid point is supplied
    to a P224, P384, or P521 method, that method will now return a
    random point. The behavior might change to an explicit panic in
    a future release.
  * crypto/tls: The new Conn.NetConn method allows access to the
    underlying net.Conn.
  * crypto/x509: Certificate.Verify now uses platform APIs to
    verify certificate validity on macOS and iOS when it is called
    with a nil VerifyOpts.Roots or when using the root pool
    returned from SystemCertPool. SystemCertPool is now available
    on Windows.
  * crypto/x509: CertPool.Subjects is deprecated. On Windows,
    macOS, and iOS the CertPool returned by SystemCertPool will
    return a pool which does not include system roots in the slice
    returned by Subjects, as a static list can't appropriately
    represent the platform policies and might not be available at
    all from the platform APIs.
  * crypto/x509: Support for signing certificates using signature
    algorithms that depend on the MD5 and SHA-1 hashes (MD5WithRSA,
    SHA1WithRSA, and ECDSAWithSHA1) may be removed in Go 1.19.
  * net/http: When looking up a domain name containing non-ASCII
    characters, the Unicode-to-ASCII conversion is now done in
    accordance with Nontransitional Processing as defined in the
    Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing standard (UTS #46). The
    interpretation of four distinct runes are changed: ß, ς,
    zero-width joiner U+200D, and zero-width non-joiner
    U+200C. Nontransitional Processing is consistent with most
    applications and web browsers.
  * os/user: User.GroupIds now uses a Go native implementation when
    cgo is not available.
  * runtime/debug: The BuildInfo struct has two new fields,
    containing additional information about how the binary was
    built: GoVersion holds the version of Go used to build the
    binary. Settings is a slice of BuildSettings structs holding
    key/value pairs describing the build.
  * runtime/pprof: The CPU profiler now uses per-thread timers on
    Linux. This increases the maximum CPU usage that a profile can
    observe, and reduces some forms of bias.
  * syscall: The new function SyscallN has been introduced for
    Windows, allowing for calls with arbitrary number of arguments.
    As a result, Syscall, Syscall6, Syscall9, Syscall12, Syscall15,
    and Syscall18 are deprecated in favor of SyscallN.
