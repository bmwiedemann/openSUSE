NAME
----
gradle - build automation tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
*gradle* [option...] [task...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Gradle is build automation evolved. Gradle can automate the building,
testing, publishing, deployment and more of software packages or other
types of projects such as generated static websites, generated
documentation or indeed anything else.

Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency
management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to
build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle
provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through
sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of
choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and
legacy automation challenges.

OPTIONS
-------
*-?, -h, --help*::
     Shows help message.

*-a, --no-rebuild*::
     Do not rebuild project dependencies.

*-b, --build-file*::
     Specifies the build file.

*-c, --settings-file*::
     Specifies the settings file.

*--configure-on-demand*::
     Only relevant projects are configured in this build run. This means faster build for large multi-project builds. [incubating]

*--console*::
     Specifies which type of console output to generate. Values are *plain*, *auto* (default) or *rich*.

*--continue*::
     Continues task execution after a task failure.

*-D, --system-prop*::
     Set system property of the JVM (e.g. *-Dmyprop=myvalue*).

*-d, --debug*::
     Log in debug mode (includes normal stacktrace).

*--daemon*::
     Uses the Gradle daemon to run the build. Starts the daemon if not running.

*--foreground*::
     Starts the Gradle daemon in the foreground. [incubating]

*-g, --gradle-user-home*::
     Specifies the gradle user home directory.

*--gui*::
     Launches the Gradle GUI.

*-I, --init-script*::
     Specifies an initialization script.

*-i, --info*::
     Set log level to info.

*-m, --dry-run*::
     Runs the builds with all task actions disabled.

*--max-workers*::
     Configure the number of concurrent workers Gradle is allowed to use. [incubating]

*--no-color*::
     Do not use color in the console output. [deprecated - use
     *--console=plain* instead]

*--no-daemon*::
     Do not use the Gradle daemon to run the build.

*--offline*::
     The build should operate without accessing network resources.

*-P, --project-prop*::
     Set project property for the build script (e.g. *-Pmyprop=myvalue*).

*-p, --project-dir*::
     Specifies the start directory for Gradle. Defaults to current directory.

*--parallel*::
     Build projects in parallel. Gradle will attempt to determine the optimal number of executor threads to use. [incubating]

*--parallel-threads*::
     Build projects in parallel, using the specified number of executor
     threads. [deprecated - Please use *--parallel*, optionally in
     conjunction with *--max-workers*.] [incubating]

*--profile*::
     Profiles build execution time and generates a report in the
     *<build_dir>/reports/profile* directory.

*--project-cache-dir*::
     Specifies the project-specific cache directory. Defaults to
     *.gradle* in the root project directory.

*-q, --quiet*::
     Log errors only.

*--recompile-scripts*::
     Force build script recompiling.

*--refresh-dependencies*::
     Refresh the state of dependencies.

     Print out the full (very verbose) stacktrace for all exceptions.

*-s, --stacktrace*::
     Print out the stacktrace for all exceptions.

*--stop*::
     Stops the Gradle daemon if it is running.

*-t, --continuous*::
     Enables continuous build. Gradle does not exit and will re-execute tasks when task file inputs change. [incubating]

*-u, --no-search-upward*::
     Don't search in parent folders for a *settings.gradle* file.
