%description
A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the [SHA-1 cryptographic hash
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) according to [FIPS
180-4](http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4) with performance close to the
fastest implementations available in other languages.

The core SHA-1 algorithm is implemented in C and is thus expected to be as fast
as the standard [sha1sum(1) tool](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sha1sum).
(If, instead, you require a pure Haskell implementation and performance is
secondary, please refer to the [SHA
package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SHA).)

Additionally, this package provides support for

- HMAC-SHA-1: SHA-1-based [Hashed Message Authentication
Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) (HMAC)

conforming to [RFC6234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234),
[RFC4231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4231),
[RFC5869](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869), et al..

=== Packages in the 'cryptohash-*' family

- <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-md5 cryptohash-md5> -
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-sha1 cryptohash-sha1> -
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-sha256 cryptohash-sha256> -
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-sha512 cryptohash-sha512>

=== Relationship to the 'cryptohash' package and its API

This package has been originally a fork of 'cryptohash-0.11.7' because the
'cryptohash' package had been deprecated and so this package continues to
satisfy the need for a lightweight package providing the SHA-1 hash algorithm
without any dependencies on packages other than 'base' and 'bytestring'.
The API exposed by 'cryptohash-sha1-0.11.*''s "Crypto.Hash.SHA1" module is
guaranteed to remain a compatible superset of the API provided by the
'cryptohash-0.11.7''s module of the same name.

Consequently, this package is designed to be used as a drop-in replacement for
'cryptohash-0.11.7''s "Crypto.Hash.SHA1" module, though with a [clearly smaller
footprint by almost 3 orders of
magnitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5lxv75/psa_please_use_unique_module_names_when_uploading/dbzegx3/).
