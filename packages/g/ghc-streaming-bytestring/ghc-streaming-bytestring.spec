%description
This library enables fast and safe streaming of byte data, in either 'Word8' or
'Char' form. It is a core addition to the <https://github.com/haskell-streaming
streaming ecosystem> and avoids the usual pitfalls of combinbing lazy
'ByteString's with lazy 'IO'.

We follow the philosophy shared by 'streaming' that "the best API is the one
you already know". Thus this library mirrors the API of the 'bytestring'
library as closely as possible.

See the module documentation and the README for more information.
