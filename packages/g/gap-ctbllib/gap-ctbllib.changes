- Update to release 1.3.11
  * The character tables of maximal subgroups were reordered
    following an error correction in the classifcation of the
    maximal subgroups of the Monster group (which has no subgroups
    of type L_2(59)) per the [DLPP24] paper.
  * Fixed an inconsistency in the CharacterParameters value
    relating to the p-module Brauer tables.

- Update to relesae 1.3.9
  * Bugfix: The table with identifier "2^2x3^2.2.S4" is encoded
    as a direct product. Up to now, one of the two factors did
    not fit to the identifier.
  * Data added:  The  class  fusions  from the maximal subgroups
    (L_2(11) × L_2(11)):4, 11^2:(5 × 2.A_5), 7^2:2L_2(7), and
    L_2(19).2 of the Monster group have been added.
  * In order to make AllCharacterTableNames (3.1-4) efficient
    also if the Browse package is not available, the relevant
    code from that package has been copied into CTblLib.

    had been erroneously attributed to the table with identifier
    "2.A6.2_2", but the correct table is that of "2.A6.2_1".
