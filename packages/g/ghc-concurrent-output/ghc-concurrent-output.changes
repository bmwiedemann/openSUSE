- Update concurrent-output to version 1.10.12.
  concurrent-output (1.10.12) unstable; urgency=medium

    * Bugfix: createProcessConcurrent would sometimes send the process's
      output to the console when it was supposed to be piped to a handle.
      (1.7.5 introduced this bug)
    * System.Console.Regions should be safe to use in a thread that
      receives async exceptions; displayConsoleRegions and withConsoleRegion
      have been made async exception safe.
      (However, System.Console.Concurrent is not async exception safe.)
    * Improve documentation about when withConcurrentOutput should be used.
    * Remove some unused code.
    * Allow building with older ansi-terminal versions, not only 0.9+.
