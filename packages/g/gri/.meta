  <title>A language for scientific illustration</title>
  <description>Gri is a language for scientific graphics programming.  It is a
command-driven application, as opposed to a click/point application.
It is analogous to latex, and shares the property that extensive power
is the reward for tolerating a modest learning curve.  Gri output is
in industry-standard PostScript, suitable for incorporation in
documents prepared by various text processors.

Gri can make x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In
addition to high-level capabilities, it has enough low-level
capabilities to allow users to achieve a high degree of customization.
Precise control is extended to all aspects of drawing, including
line-widths, colors, and fonts.  Text includes a subset of the tex
language, so that it is easy to incorporate Greek letters and
mathematical symbols in labels.</description>
