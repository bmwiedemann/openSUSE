- Name the installed binary `delta`, as upstream calls it, as
  renaming causes various breakages (e.g. bash completions) and 
  inconsitencies with upstream documentation and usage. 
  Add Conflict with sccs, which also provides a binary called
  `delta` instead.

- Update to version 0.4.4
  * This release mostly fixes bugs in git add -p behavior, adds 
    test coverage, and clarifies the code involved.
    In addition, a new environment variable is supported: 
    DELTA_PAGER. If set, this takes precedence over BAT_PAGER. 
    See --paging in delta --help.
    * bug git add -p one-to-one correspondence errors
    * bug Line numbers incorrect/relative - Windows/Delta 0.4.1
    * bug [Linux] git add -p not working with side-by-side

- Update to version 0.4.3
  * A few bug fixes and a couple of minor features (mac-line-length) 
   and the ability to hide all line numbers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 10 06:03:45 UTC 2020 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.1
  * This release fixes a few bugs. In particular, it makes it possible
    to use git add -p with line numbers activated. If you also have
    side-by-side activated then that will not be used in git add -p
    (it's impossible) but it will now not cause an error either.
  - Dockerfile isn't colored
  - [Linux] git add -p not working with side-by-side
  - Mismatch in line numbers between git diff and git add -p

- Update to version 0.4
  * The main new feature in this release is support for git diff
    --color-moved. This makes Git's native moved-line detection
    algorithms and styling options available when using Delta. Delta
    supports this automatically, without any configuration change, but
    see the new option inspect-raw-lines in case you need to turn it
    off.
  * The other new feature is that Delta can now cause files and commit
    hashes to be rendered as hyperlinks in your terminal emulator:
    However, this will not be available to you without, at the
    minimum, installing a patched version of less, because support for
    the hyperlink spec has only partially spread through the terminal
    application ecosystem. See delta --help text for details.
  * Bugs fixed:
      * Support --color-moved
      * Support --color-moved-ws
      * Support displaying files and commits as OSC 8 hyperlinks
      * width option is not honored in git config sections
      * diff -U0 rendered with lines out of order
      * paging should be supported in gitconfig
      * syntax-theme should be honored in a custom feature in gitconfig
      * Line numbers style not taking effect with --side-by-side
      * Duplicate "renamed" header when file is renamed with changes

- Update to version 0.3
  * This release adds a side-by-side diff view: delta -s or 
    delta --side-by-side. By default, side-by-side view has 
    line-numbers activated, and has syntax highlighting in both the 
    left and right panels.
  * The release also fixes bug #238 in which the line number display 
    alignment was broken for line numbers greater than 9999.

- Update to version 0.2
  This is a large release, introducing major changes to delta 
  configuration as well as new features and bug fixes. It involved a 
  major overhaul of the code base. 
  The highlights are:
   * To configure delta's appearance, you now use "styles" instead 
     of background color names. A style is a string like red bold ul 
     "#ffeeee" that specifies foreground color, background color, 
     and attributes. 
     See https://github.com/dandavison/delta#choosing-colors-styles.
   * Delta now reads configuration from a [delta] section in git 
     config, and this is the recommended way to configure delta. 
     See https://github.com/dandavison/delta#configuration
   * Delta now has a line numbers feature. 
   * Delta now has --diff-highlight and --diff-so-fancy 
     emulation modes
