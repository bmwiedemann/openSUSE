  * Explicitly request xz compression by @dandavison in #1249
  * Thanks to all contributors for the changes in this release! One
    particularly exciting contribution is the tweaks to the highlighting
    algorithm made by @phillipwood in #1244. This is something that has
    remained more or less the same since delta was first created, but #1244
    brings several improvements in the details of exactly which characters
    are highlighted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 09:06:07 UTC 2022 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Add bump-regex.patch to fix CVE-2022-24713 (boo#1196972)

- Update to version 0.12.1:
  * Make git include colors in output going to delta
  * Clarify language: "in front of" â "before"
  * Fix parsing for .properties files with - in path
  * Support CSI sequences other than SGR
  * Enable commit links for GitLab
  * Fall back to plain diff when process substitution is used
  * Include information about GIT_PAGER in manual
  * Use assets API from bat library instead of vendored code
  * Calling process: Query more parents, disable full scan
  * Run in diff mode iff two positional arguments are supplied

- Update to version 0.12.0:
  Firstly a breaking change: some deprecated options are no longer 
  supported: in particular plus-color and minus-color. A description 
  of this change and what you need to do if you're affected by it is below.
  Secondly, improvements, including:
  * A (much-needed) short help text is now available: use delta -h. 
    Delta is the proud possessor of 100 command-line options, 
    so I think this is going to be helpful.
  * git blame output now displays line numbers
  * Improvements to file and mode labels
  * delta now has a user manual: https://dandavison.github.io/delta/. 
    You can even create a PDF copy (print button in upper-right hand corner), 
    and the README is correspondingly now a much easier read with 
    the minimal required setup instructions and an overview of 
    functionality with screenshots.
  Finally some bug fixes, including
  * File path hyperlinks (e.g. in diff and grep output) were previously 
    sometimes incorrect, especially when delta was invoked from a 
    directory other than the repo root.
  * Some fixes to grep output parsing edge cases

- Update to version 0.11.3:
  * Fix handling of --word-diff and --color-words. Note that line-numbers 
    and side-by-side will be ignored if delta detects that the input 
    was generated by git --word-diff / --color-words.
  * DELTA_FEATURES can now be used to add to features specified in 
    ~/.gitconfig. Use a + prefix to do this: an example is 
    DELTA_FEATURES=+side-by-side which will activate side-by-side, in addition to your usual features.
  * Store less history file in a better location on Windows.
  * Fix performance issue affecting some linux users

- Update to version 0.11.2:
  * This release fixes a performance problem that was affecting some users. 

- Update to version 0.11.1:
  * Be permissive about unexpected state machine state (fixes crash)

- Update to version 0.11.0:
  * Handle combined diff format and merge conflicts
  * Handle failure to parse non hunk header

- Update to version 0.10.3:
  * Delta was previously handling --word-diff and --color-words 
    output in a nonsensical way. With this release, delta does not 
    attempt to handle these output types, allowing git's raw output 
    through unchanged. Appropriate handling may be added later.
  * When a line is unchanged but paired with a line that has 
    additions/deletions, delta now assigns the unchanged line 
    {plus,minus}-non-emph-style; previously it assigned {plus,minus}-style. 
    This change does not alter visual output by default because by 
    default those two style styles are set to the same value.
  * Fixes a bug affecting line numbers in side-by-side mode

- Update to version 0.10.2:
  * This releases fixes a bug when using side-by-side with 
    `git diff.colorMoved``

- Update to version 0.10.1:
  * Remove trailing \r from raw line, in presence of ANSI escape sequences

- Update to version 0.10.0:
  * delta displays output from git grep and rg --json ... | delta 
    with code syntax highlighting and navigate functionality.
  * delta displays output from git blame with code syntax highlighting, 
    hyperlinks to commits, and control over formatting.
  * delta syntax highlights file contents produced by git show $revision:/path/to/file
  * delta can apply syntax highlighting and arbitrary styling to the 
    raw colors emitted by git --color-moved. This is done by specifying 
    rules for remapping styles using map-styles.
  * More powerful configuration options: styles can reference other 
    styles, custom styles and custom colors can be defined in 
    gitconfig and reused, and 140 colors can be specified using their 
    standard CSS names.
  * New subcommand --show-colors outputs a demo of 140 background colors 
    with syntax highlighting, to help choose background colors.
  * New subcommand --parse-ansi takes color input and prints out the 
    corresponding style strings (useful for map-styles)
  * Utilities for interrogating the command line of the process that 
    is sending output to delta, added by @th1000s.

- Update to version 0.9.2:
  * Do not reformat submodule diffs under git add -p

- Update to version 0.9.1:
  * This is a followup to release 0.9.0 fixing a bug in the --help
    text emitted by the 0.9.0 binary.

- Update to version 0.9.0:
  With this release, long lines are wrapped in side-by-side mode, 
  thanks to a far-reaching series of contributions. No special 
  customization is needed, but sophisticated control over the details 
  is available: see `--wrap-max-lines`, `--wrap-left-symbol`, 
  `--wrap-right-symbol`, `--wrap-right-percent`, 
  `--wrap-right-prefix-symbol`, `--inline-hint-style`.
  * Fix the empty result issue in add -p
  * Recognize GitHub SSH remote URLs that don't start with git@ for hyperlinks
  * Terminate process gracefully on error in diff()
  * Ignore ctrl-c (SIGINT) to avoid leaving an orphaned pager process.
  * Remove unnecessary borrows
  * Fix computed values to be computed after all set_options
  * Make it possible to jump between files when navigate is active
  * Fix empty line highlighting
  * Fix deadlock in git diff mode
  * Support insteadOf replacements in git remote URLs
  * Do not suppress submodule diffs
  * More minimalistic display of submodule (short) diffs
  * Fix hunk header when line number is not requested and navigate is enabled
  * Display removed file name in file deletion case
  * Remove superfluous lowercasing of feature names
  * Option to set the background extension mode to ANSI or spaces
  * Add side-by-side line wrapping mode
  * Width can be an offset from the terminal width
  * Linenumber refactoring
  * Use fatal() to exit with errorcode 2
  * Re-enable ANSI fill by equalizing panel sizes
  * Update syntaxes and themes from bat v0.18.3
  * Line numbers and side-by-side mode

- Replace rust-packaging with cargo-packaging

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  4 09:02:40 UTC 2021 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Add git as BuildRequires, which is needed for testing
- Update to version 0.8.3
  * This release fixes a security vulnerability (CVE-2021-36376) 
    on Windows. Please update if you are using Windows.

- Update to version 0.8.2
  * This is a bug fix release: the bug occurs when using delta to 
    diff files whose names contain spaces. It does not affect use of 
    delta as git's pager.
  * closed bug: argument parsing error with delta fileA fileB 
    when filenames contain spaces

- Update to version 0.8.1
  * This is mainly a bug fix release: filenames containing spaces 
    were causing crashes due to a regression in 0.8.0. It also includes 
    a fix for the delta file_a file_b "diff mode" usage style, and 
    an improvement for the diff-highlight / diff-so-fancy emulation modes.
  * closed bug: Panic with filename "01g - Text"
  * closed bug: side-by-side option only works in diff mode when piping
  * closed bug: commit-style raw for diff-so-fancy / diff-highlight

- Update to version 0.8.0
  * New option: relative-paths causes all file paths to be printed 
   relative to the current directory so that they can be easily opened 
   in a text editor or used in a shell command. Using 
   `hunk-header-style = file line-number` syntax will emit the line 
   number with the file path and thus should allow your editor to 
   open at the correct line. For example, in the VS Code integrated 
   terminal this means that with no further configuration every file 
   path in git output can be opened with ctrl-click/cmd-click, and 
   opening at a specific line works. Use diff-stat-align-width to 
   control horizontal alignment of diff stat sections, 
   although this may be replaced by a better solution in the future.
  * New option: commit-regex allows delta to work nicely with custom 
    git log formats
  * Support git -c delta.foo=bar ... in latest git version
  * Support custom hyperlink hash formats
  * Allow custom themes to be defined as light themes
  * Transform file paths to be relative to current directory
  * delta file_A file_B now invokes git diff, instead of diff -u
  * Fixed bug the --24-bit-color option is unusable from .gitconfig: 
    24-bit-color is deprecated; use true-color instead.
  * Fixed bug Fix less version parsing
  * Fixed bug No output for chmod file mode change

- Update to version 0.7.1
  * This release brings two improvements due to delta contributors:
    @cben proposed a new way for delta to seed less with the regexp 
    that is used to implement navigation, which is implemented in 
    this release. This makes it possible to keep navigate=true in 
    delta config all the time, without the ill effects that it had before
  * a new option delta --show-themes, which demos the delta color 
    themes that are available locally. n and N step forwards and 
    backwards through the themes.
  * new themes
  * Fix bug Setting $PAGER to use delta results in an infinite loop
  * Fix bug --navigate breaks git log --oneline and empty git diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 20:52:58 UTC 2021 - Gordon Schulz <gordon@gordonschulz.de>

- Update to version 0.6.0
  * This release brings a new and more convenient way to change delta 
    options in a one-off git command: using git -c. Here's an example:

    git -c delta.line-numbers=false -c delta.max-line-distance=0.8 show

    One note: while quotes around color hex codes are required in 
    gitconfig, they can be omitted in the git -c context

    git -c delta.plus-style='syntax "#aa0000"'
    git -c delta.plus-style='syntax #aa0000'
  * Hunk header misaligned in some cases
  * Delta does not respect git -c
  * Can't disable line numbering from command line
  * Support for Apple Silicon/ARM64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  8 09:05:59 UTC 2021 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.5.1
  * This release is primarily to make delta build on Apple Silicon/ARM 
    for Homebrew. 
  * It also fixes an inconsistency whereby the line number was not 
    displayed in the hunk header if line-numbers was active.

- Update to version 0.5.0
  * This release introduces a cosmetic change to delta output: 
    the line number (when full line-numbers mode is not active) 
    is now displayed in the hunk header line, along with the hunk 
    header code fragment, and optionally a file path.

    Use hunk-header-style to configure it:
      --hunk-header-style <hunk-header-style>
        Style (foreground, background, attributes) for the hunk-header. 
        See STYLES section. Special attributes 'file' and 'line-number' 
        can be used to include the file path, and number of first 
        hunk line, in the hunk header. If included in the hunk header, 
        'file' and 'line-number' are styled according to 'file-style' 
        and 'hunk-header-decoration-style' respectively. 
        The style 'omit' can be used to remove the hunk header section
        from the output [default: line-number syntax]
    If you are displaying the file path in the hunk header, you may 
    want to get rid of the main file line. 
    Use file-style = <my-file-color> omit to set the color of the file 
    in the hunk header while deactivating the main file section.
  * The release also fixes a bug that was introduced in the last release 
    when using delta as a unified diff replacement, 
    i.e. delta file_a file_b.
  * delta 0.4.5 binary release messes up terminal on Ubuntu 20 04
  * delta 0.4.5 binary release does not run on macOS 10.11 (El Capitan)
  * ReadMe can now use latest less.exe (instead of forked version)
  * bump-homebrew-formula GitHub CD action is not working
  * closed: Is it possible to show the file path in the hunk header?
  * side-by-side alignment incorrect when tabs present

- Update to version 0.4.5
  * Creatied CI and CD workflows for Delta in GitHub actions
  * delta shall have non-zero status code if there were any matches 
    found
  * Expose max_buffered_lines as configurable option
  * Some theme options are not working with --color-only enabled
  * Calculate code coverage
  * Switch from Travis to GitHub actions
  * delta does not recognize Git's copy detection
  * Empty lines highlight plus-marker as whitespace-error
  * PAGER= does nothing
  * Add a test that enforces clippy and rustfmt compliance
  * Dimmed-zebra doesn't show whether line is removed vs. added
  * Windows Terminal Preview 1.4: Hyperlinks not working
  * closed: Is it possible to not use hunk header and see absolute 
            (true) not relative line numbers?
  * closed: Is it possible to show the file path in the hunk header?
  * Markdown coloring problem

Wed Oct 14 08:27:19 UTC 2020 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Name the installed binary `delta`, as upstream calls it, as
  renaming causes various breakages (e.g. bash completions) and 
  inconsitencies with upstream documentation and usage. 
  Add Conflict with sccs, which also provides a binary called
  `delta` instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 05:56:35 UTC 2020 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.4
  * This release mostly fixes bugs in git add -p behavior, adds 
    test coverage, and clarifies the code involved.
    In addition, a new environment variable is supported: 
    DELTA_PAGER. If set, this takes precedence over BAT_PAGER. 
    See --paging in delta --help.
    * bug git add -p one-to-one correspondence errors
    * bug Line numbers incorrect/relative - Windows/Delta 0.4.1
    * bug [Linux] git add -p not working with side-by-side
    * bug Delta crash on Windows when using as stand-alone diff tool

Mon Aug 10 06:03:45 UTC 2020 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.1
  * This release fixes a few bugs. In particular, it makes it possible
    to use git add -p with line numbers activated. If you also have
    side-by-side activated then that will not be used in git add -p
    (it's impossible) but it will now not cause an error either.
  - Dockerfile isn't colored
  - [Linux] git add -p not working with side-by-side
  - Mismatch in line numbers between git diff and git add -p

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  5 09:52:32 UTC 2020 - Martin Sirringhaus <martin.sirringhaus@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4

    --color-moved. This makes Git's native moved-line detection
    algorithms and styling options available when using Delta. Delta
    supports this automatically, without any configuration change, but
    see the new option inspect-raw-lines in case you need to turn it
    off.
  * The other new feature is that Delta can now cause files and commit
    hashes to be rendered as hyperlinks in your terminal emulator:
    However, this will not be available to you without, at the
    minimum, installing a patched version of less, because support for
    the hyperlink spec has only partially spread through the terminal
    application ecosystem. See delta --help text for details.
  * Bugs fixed:
      * Support --color-moved
      * Support --color-moved-ws
      * Support displaying files and commits as OSC 8 hyperlinks
      * width option is not honored in git config sections
      * diff -U0 rendered with lines out of order
      * paging should be supported in gitconfig
      * syntax-theme should be honored in a custom feature in gitconfig
      * Line numbers style not taking effect with --side-by-side
      * Duplicate "renamed" header when file is renamed with changes

- Update to version 0.3
  * This release adds a side-by-side diff view: delta -s or 
    delta --side-by-side. By default, side-by-side view has 
    line-numbers activated, and has syntax highlighting in both the 
    left and right panels.
  * The release also fixes bug #238 in which the line number display 
    alignment was broken for line numbers greater than 9999.

- Update to version 0.2
  This is a large release, introducing major changes to delta 
  configuration as well as new features and bug fixes. It involved a 
  major overhaul of the code base. 
  The highlights are:
   * To configure delta's appearance, you now use "styles" instead 
     of background color names. A style is a string like red bold ul 
     "#ffeeee" that specifies foreground color, background color, 
     and attributes. 
     See https://github.com/dandavison/delta#choosing-colors-styles.
   * Delta now reads configuration from a [delta] section in git 
     config, and this is the recommended way to configure delta. 
     See https://github.com/dandavison/delta#configuration
   * Delta now has a line numbers feature. 
   * Delta now has --diff-highlight and --diff-so-fancy 
     emulation modes
