  <title>GStreamer Streaming-Media Framework Plug-Ins</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'gstreamer-0_10-plugins-base' from project 'openSUSE:Factory'.

GStreamer is a streaming media framework based on graphs of filters
that operate on media data. Applications using this library can do
anything media-related, from real-time sound processing to playing
videos. Its plug-in-based architecture means that new data types or
processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins.
