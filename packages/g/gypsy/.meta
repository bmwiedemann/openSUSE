  <title>GPS multiplexing daemon</title>
  <description>Gypsy is a GPS multiplexing daemon which allows multiple clients to
access GPS data from multiple GPS sources concurrently.

Without some sort of multiplexing system, a GPS device can only safely
be accessed by one client. In a server situation this may not cause any
problems, but on modern desktop which could potentially have multiple
location aware devices, this could be an issue.</description>
