%description
The 'Par' monad offers a simple API for parallel programming. The library works
for parallelising both pure and 'IO' computations, although only the pure
version is deterministic. The default implementation provides a work-stealing
scheduler and supports forking tasks that are much lighter weight than
IO-threads.

For complete documentation see "Control.Monad.Par".

Some examples of use can be found in the 'examples/' directory of the source
package.

Other related packages:

* 'abstract-par' provides the type classes that abstract over different
implementations of the 'Par' monad.

* 'monad-par-extras' provides extra combinators and monad transformers layered
on top of the 'Par' monad.

Changes in 0.3.4 relative to 0.3:

* Fix bugs that cause "thread blocked indefinitely on MVar" crashes.

* Added "Control.Monad.Par.IO".
