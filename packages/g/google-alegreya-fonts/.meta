  <title>Serif Font for Literature</title>
  <description>Alegreya was chosen as one of 53 &quot;Fonts of the Decade&quot; at
the ATypI Letter2 competition in September 2011, and one
of the top 14 text type systems. It was also selected in
the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de Dise√±o, competition
held in Madrid in 2010.

Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature.
Among its crowning characteristics, it conveys a dynamic
and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of long
texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while
referring to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal 
interpretation, but rather in a contemporary typographic language.
