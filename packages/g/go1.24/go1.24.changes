- go1.24 (released 2025-02-11) is a major release of Go.
  go1.24.x minor releases will be provided through February 2026.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.24 arrives six months after Go 1.23. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
  Refs boo#1236217 go1.24 release tracking
  * Language change: Go 1.24 now fully supports generic type
    aliases: a type alias may be parameterized like a defined
    type. See the language spec for details. For now, the feature
    can be disabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=noaliastypeparams; but
    the aliastypeparams setting will be removed for Go 1.25.
  * go command: Go modules can now track executable dependencies
    using tool directives in go.mod. This removes the need for the
    previous workaround of adding tools as blank imports to a file
    conventionally named "tools.go". The go tool command can now
    run these tools in addition to tools shipped with the Go
    distribution.
  * go command: The new -tool flag for go get causes a tool
    directive to be added to the current module for named packages
    in addition to adding require directives.
  * go command: The new tool meta-pattern refers to all tools in
    the current module. This can be used to upgrade them all with
    go get tool or to install them into your GOBIN directory with
    go install tool.
  * go command: Executables created by go run and the new behavior
    of go tool are now cached in the Go build cache. This makes
    repeated executions faster at the expense of making the cache
    larger. See go#69290.
  * go command: The go build and go install commands now accept a
    -json flag that reports build output and failures as structured
    JSON output on standard output. For details of the reporting
    format, see go help buildjson. Furthermore, go test -json now
    reports build output and failures in JSON, interleaved with
    test result JSON. These are distinguished by new Action types,
    but if they cause problems in a test integration system, you
    can revert to the text build output with GODEBUG setting
    gotestjsonbuildtext=1.
  * go command: The new GOAUTH environment variable provides a
    flexible way to authenticate private module fetches. See go
    help goauth for more information.
  * go command: The go build command now sets the main module's
    version in the compiled binary based on the version control
    system tag and/or commit. A +dirty suffix will be appended if
    there are uncommitted changes. Use the -buildvcs=false flag to
    omit version control information from the binary.
  * go command: The new GODEBUG setting toolchaintrace=1 can be
    used to trace the go command's toolchain selection process.
  * cgo: cgo supports new annotations for C functions to improve
    run time performance. cgo noescape cFunctionName tells the
    compiler that memory passed to the C function cFunctionname
    does not escape. cgo nocallback cFunctionName tells the
    compiler that the C function cFunctionName does not call back
    to any Go functions.
  * cgo: cgo currently refuses to compile calls to a C function
    which has multiple incompatible declarations. For instance,
    if f is declared as both void f(int) and void f(double),
    cgo will report an error instead of possibly generating an
    incorrect call sequence for f(0). New in this release is a
    better detector for this error condition when the incompatible
    declarations appear in different files. See go#67699.
  * objdump: The objdump tool now supports dissassembly on 64-bit
    LoongArch (GOARCH=loong64), RISC-V (GOARCH=riscv64), and S390X
    (GOARCH=s390x).
  * vet: The new tests analyzer reports common mistakes in
    declarations of tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, and examples in
    test packages, such as malformed names, incorrect signatures,
    or examples that document non-existent identifiers. Some of
    these mistakes may cause tests not to run. This analyzer is
    among the subset of analyzers that are run by go test.
  * vet: The existing printf analyzer now reports a diagnostic for
    calls of the form fmt.Printf(s), where s is a non-constant
    format string, with no other arguments. Such calls are nearly
    always a mistake as the value of s may contain the % symbol;
    use fmt.Print instead. See go#60529. This check tends to
    produce findings in existing code, and so is only applied when
    the language version (as specified by the go.mod go directive
    or //go:build comments) is at least Go 1.24, to avoid causing
    continuous integration failures when updating to the 1.24 Go
    toolchain.
  * vet: The existing buildtag analyzer now reports a diagnostic
    when there is an invalid Go major version build constraint
    within a //go:build directive. For example, //go:build go1.23.1
    refers to a point release; use //go:build go1.23 instead.
    See go#64127.
  * vet: The existing copylock analyzer now reports a diagnostic
    when a variable declared in a 3-clause "for" loop such as for i
    := iter(); done(i); i = next(i) { ... } contains a sync.Locker,
    such as a sync.Mutex. Go 1.22 changed the behavior of these
    loops to create a new variable for each iteration, copying the
    value from the previous iteration; this copy operation is not
    safe for locks. See go#66387.
  * GOCACHEPROG: The cmd/go internal binary and test caching
    mechanism can now be implemented by child processes
    implementing a JSON protocol between the cmd/go tool and the
    child process named by the GOCACHEPROG environment
    variable. This was previously behind a GOEXPERIMENT. For
    protocol details, see the documentation.
  * Runtime: Several performance improvements to the runtime have
    decreased CPU overheads by 2-3% on average across a suite of
    representative benchmarks. Results may vary by
    application. These improvements include a new builtin map
    implementation based on Swiss Tables, more efficient memory
    allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex
    implementation.
  * Runtime: The new builtin map implementation and new
    runtime-internal mutex may be disabled by setting
    GOEXPERIMENT=noswissmap and GOEXPERIMENT=nospinbitmutex at
    build time respectively.
  * Compiler: The compiler already disallowed defining new methods
    with receiver types that were cgo-generated, but it was
    possible to circumvent that restriction via an alias type. Go
    1.24 now always reports an error if a receiver denotes a
    cgo-generated type, whether directly or indirectly (through an
    alias type).
  * Linker: The linker now generates a GNU build ID (the ELF
    NT_GNU_BUILD_ID note) on ELF platforms and a UUID (the Mach-O
    LC_UUID load command) on macOS by default. The build ID or UUID
    is derived from the Go build ID. It can be disabled by the -B
    none linker flag, or overridden by the -B 0xNNNN linker flag
    with a user-specified hexadecimal value.
  * Bootstrap: As mentioned in the Go 1.22 release notes, Go 1.24
    now requires Go 1.22.6 or later for bootstrap. We expect that
    Go 1.26 will require a point release of Go 1.24 or later for
    bootstrap.
  * Standard library: Directory-limited filesystem access: The new
    os.Root type provides the ability to perform filesystem
    operations within a specific directory. The os.OpenRoot
    function opens a directory and returns an os.Root. Methods on
    os.Root operate within the directory and do not permit paths
    that refer to locations outside the directory, including ones
    that follow symbolic links out of the directory. The methods on
    os.Root mirror most of the file system operations available in
    the os package, including for example os.Root.Open,
    os.Root.Create, os.Root.Mkdir, and os.Root.Stat,
  * Standard library: new benchmark function: Benchmarks may now
    use the faster and less error-prone testing.B.Loop method to
    perform benchmark iterations like for b.Loop() { ... } in place
    of the typical loop structures involving b.N like for range
    b.N. This offers two significant advantages: 1) The benchmark
    function will execute exactly once per -count, so expensive
    setup and cleanup steps execute only once, and 2) Function call
    parameters and results are kept alive, preventing the compiler
    from fully optimizing away the loop body.
  * Standard library: Improved finalizers: The new
    runtime.AddCleanup function is a finalization mechanism that is
    more flexible, more efficient, and less error-prone than
    runtime.SetFinalizer. AddCleanup attaches a cleanup function to
    an object that will run once the object is no longer reachable.
    However, unlike SetFinalizer, multiple cleanups may be attached
    to a single object, cleanups may be attached to interior
    pointers, cleanups do not generally cause leaks when objects
    form a cycle, and cleanups do not delay the freeing of an
    object or objects it points to. New code should prefer
    AddCleanup over SetFinalizer.
  * Standard library: New weak package: The new weak package
    provides weak pointers. Weak pointers are a low-level primitive
    provided to enable the creation of memory-efficient structures,
    such as weak maps for associating values, canonicalization maps
    for anything not covered by package unique, and various kinds
    of caches. For supporting these use-cases, this release also
    provides runtime.AddCleanup and maphash.Comparable.
  * Standard library: New crypto/mlkem package: The new
    crypto/mlkem package implements ML-KEM-768 and
    ML-KEM-1024. ML-KEM is a post-quantum key exchange mechanism
    formerly known as Kyber and specified in FIPS 203.
  * Standard library: New crypto/hkdf, crypto/pbkdf2, and
    crypto/sha3 packages: The new crypto/hkdf package implements
    the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand key derivation function HKDF,
    as defined in RFC 5869. The new crypto/pbkdf2 package
    implements the password-based key derivation function PBKDF2,
    as defined in RFC 8018. The new crypto/sha3 package implements
    the SHA-3 hash function and SHAKE and cSHAKE extendable-output
    functions, as defined in FIPS 202. All three packages are based
    on pre-existing golang.org/x/crypto/... packages.
  * FIPS: release includes a new set of mechanisms to facilitate
    FIPS 140-3 compliance. See https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140
    The Go Cryptographic Module is a set of internal standard
    library packages that are transparently used to implement FIPS
    140-3 approved algorithms. Applications require no changes to
    use the Go Cryptographic Module for approved algorithms.
  * FIPS: The new GOFIPS140 environment variable can be used to
    select the Go Cryptographic Module version to use in a
    build. The new fips140 GODEBUG setting can be used to enable
    FIPS 140-3 mode at runtime.
  * FIPS: Go 1.24 includes Go Cryptographic Module version v1.0.0,
    which is currently under test with a CMVP-accredited
    laboratory.
  * Standard library: New experimental testing/synctest package:
    The new experimental testing/synctest package provides support
    for testing concurrent code. The synctest.Run function starts a
    group of goroutines in an isolated "bubble". Within the bubble,
    time package functions operate on a fake clock.  The
    synctest.Wait function waits for all goroutines in the current
    bubble to block. The synctest package is experimental and must
    be enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=synctest at build time. The
    package API is subject to change in future releases. See issue
    go#67434 for more information and to provide feeback.
  * archive: The (*Writer).AddFS implementations in both
    archive/zip and archive/tar now write a directory header for an
    empty directory.
  * bytes: The bytes package adds several functions that work with
    iterators.
  * bytes: Lines returns an iterator over the newline-terminated
    lines in a byte slice.
  * bytes: SplitSeq returns an iterator over all subslices of a
    byte slice split around a separator.
  * bytes: SplitAfterSeq returns an iterator over subslices of a
    byte slice split after each instance of a separator.
  * bytes: FieldsSeq returns an iterator over subslices of a byte
    slice split around runs of whitespace characters, as defined by
    unicode.IsSpace.
  * bytes: FieldsFuncSeq returns an iterator over subslices of a
    byte slice split around runs of Unicode code points satisfying
    a predicate.
  * crypto/aes: The value returned by NewCipher no longer
    implements the NewCTR, NewGCM, NewCBCEncrypter, and
    NewCBCDecrypter methods. These methods were undocumented and
    not available on all architectures. Instead, the Block value
    should be passed directly to the relevant crypto/cipher
    functions. For now, crypto/cipher still checks for those
    methods on Block values, even if they are not used by the
    standard library anymore.
  * crypto/aes: The Stream implementation returned by NewCTR when
    used with crypto/aes is now several times faster on amd64 and
    arm64.
  * crypto/cipher: The new NewGCMWithRandomNonce function returns
    an AEAD that implements AES-GCM by generating a random nonce
    during Seal and prepending it to the ciphertext.
  * crypto/cipher: NewOFB, NewCFBEncrypter, and NewCFBDecrypter are
    now deprecated. OFB and CFB mode are not authenticated, which
    generally enables active attacks to manipulate and recover the
    plaintext. It is recommended that applications use AEAD modes
    instead. If an unauthenticated Stream mode is required, use
    NewCTR instead.
  * crypto/ecdsa: PrivateKey.Sign now produces a deterministic
    signature according to RFC 6979 if the random source is nil.
  * crypto/md5: The value returned by md5.New now also implements
    the encoding.BinaryAppender interface.
  * crypto/rand: The Read function is now guaranteed not to
    fail. It will always return nil as the error result. If Read
    were to encounter an error while reading from Reader, the
    program will irrecoverably crash. Note that the platform APIs
    used by the default Reader are documented to always succeed, so
    this change should only affect programs that override the
    Reader variable. One exception are Linux kernels before version
    3.17, where the default Reader still opens /dev/urandom and may
    fail.
  * crypto/rand: On Linux 6.11 and later, Reader now uses the
    getrandom system call via vDSO. This is several times faster,
    especially for small reads.
  * crypto/rand: On OpenBSD, Reader now uses arc4random_buf(3).
  * crypto/rand: The new Text function can be used to generate
    cryptographically secure random text strings.
  * crypto/rsa: GenerateKey now returns an error if a key of less
    than 1024 bits is requested. All Sign, Verify, Encrypt, and
    Decrypt methods now return an error if used with a key smaller
    than 1024 bits. Such keys are insecure and should not be
    used. GODEBUG setting rsa1024min=0 restores the old behavior,
    but we recommend doing so only if necessary and only in tests,
    for example by adding a //go:debug rsa1024min=0 line to a test
    file. A new GenerateKey example provides an easy-to-use
    standard 2048-bit test key.
  * crypto/rsa: It is now safe and more efficient to call
    PrivateKey.Precompute before PrivateKey.Validate. Precompute is
    now faster in the presence of partially filled out
    PrecomputedValues, such as when unmarshaling a key from JSON.
  * crypto/rsa: The package now rejects more invalid keys, even
    when Validate is not called, and GenerateKey may return new
    errors for broken random sources. The Primes and Precomputed
    fields of PrivateKey are now used and validated even when some
    values are missing. See also the changes to crypto/x509 parsing
    and marshaling of RSA keys described below.
  * crypto/rsa: SignPKCS1v15 and VerifyPKCS1v15 now support
    SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256, and SHA-3.
  * crypto/rsa: GenerateKey now uses a slightly different method to
    generate the private exponent (Carmichael's totient instead of
    Euler's totient). Rare applications that externally regenerate
    keys from only the prime factors may produce different but
    compatible results.
  * crypto/rsa: Public and private key operations are now up to two
    times faster on wasm.
  * crypto/sha1: The value returned by sha1.New now also implements
    the encoding.BinaryAppender interface.
  * crypto/sha256: The values returned by sha256.New and
    sha256.New224 now also implement the encoding.BinaryAppender
    interface.
  * crypto/sha512: The values returned by sha512.New,
    sha512.New384, sha512.New512_224 and sha512.New512_256 now also
    implement the encoding.BinaryAppender interface.
  * crypto/subtle: The new WithDataIndependentTiming function
    allows the user to run a function with architecture specific
    features enabled which guarantee specific instructions are data
    value timing invariant. This can be used to make sure that code
    designed to run in constant time is not optimized by CPU-level
    features such that it operates in variable time. Currently,
    WithDataIndependentTiming uses the PSTATE.DIT bit on arm64, and
    is a no-op on all other architectures. GODEBUG setting
    dataindependenttiming=1 enables the DIT mode for the entire Go
    program.
  * crypto/subtle: The XORBytes output must overlap exactly or not
    at all with the inputs. Previously, the behavior was otherwise
    undefined, while now XORBytes will panic.
  * crypto/tls: The TLS server now supports Encrypted Client Hello
    (ECH). This feature can be enabled by populating the
    Config.EncryptedClientHelloKeys field.
  * crypto/tls: The new post-quantum X25519MLKEM768 key exchange
    mechanism is now supported and is enabled by default when
    Config.CurvePreferences is nil. GODEBUG setting tlsmlkem=0
    reverts the default.
  * crypto/tls: Support for the experimental X25519Kyber768Draft00
    key exchange has been removed.
  * crypto/tls: Key exchange ordering is now handled entirely by
    the crypto/tls package. The order of Config.CurvePreferences is
    now ignored, and the contents are only used to determine which
    key exchanges to enable when the field is populated.
  * crypto/tls: The new ClientHelloInfo.Extensions field lists the
    IDs of the extensions received in the Client Hello
    message. This can be useful for fingerprinting TLS clients.
  * crypto/x509: The x509sha1 GODEBUG setting has been
    removed. Certificate.Verify no longer supports SHA-1 based
    signatures.
  * crypto/x509: OID now implements the encoding.BinaryAppender and
    encoding.TextAppender interfaces.
  * crypto/x509: The default certificate policies field has changed
    from Certificate.PolicyIdentifiers to
    Certificate.Policies. When parsing certificates, both fields
    will be populated, but when creating certificates policies will
    now be taken from the Certificate.Policies field instead of the
    Certificate.PolicyIdentifiers field. This change can be
    reverted with GODEBUG setting x509usepolicies=0.
  * crypto/x509: CreateCertificate will now generate a serial
    number using a RFC 5280 compliant method when passed a template
    with a nil Certificate.SerialNumber field, instead of failing.
  * crypto/x509: Certificate.Verify now supports policy validation,
    as defined in RFC 5280 and RFC 9618. The new
    VerifyOptions.CertificatePolicies field can be set to an
    acceptable set of policy OIDs. Only certificate chains with
    valid policy graphs will be returned from Certificate.Verify.
  * crypto/x509: MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey now returns an error
    instead of marshaling an invalid RSA
    key. (MarshalPKCS1PrivateKey doesn't have an error return, and
    its behavior when provided invalid keys continues to be
    undefined.)
  * crypto/x509: ParsePKCS1PrivateKey and ParsePKCS8PrivateKey now
    use and validate the encoded CRT values, so might reject
    invalid RSA keys that were previously accepted. Use GODEBUG
    setting x509rsacrt=0 to revert to recomputing the CRT values.
  * debug/elf: The debug/elf package adds support for handling
    symbol versions in dynamic ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)
    files. The new File.DynamicVersions method returns a list of
    dynamic versions defined in the ELF file. The new
    File.DynamicVersionNeeds method returns a list of dynamic
    versions required by this ELF file that are defined in other
    ELF objects. Finally, the new Symbol.HasVersion and
    Symbol.VersionIndex fields indicate the version of a symbol.
  * encoding: Two new interfaces, TextAppender and BinaryAppender,
    have been introduced to append the textual or binary
    representation of an object to a byte slice. These interfaces
    provide the same functionality as TextMarshaler and
    BinaryMarshaler, but instead of allocating a new slice each
    time, they append the data directly to an existing slice. These
    interfaces are now implemented by standard library types that
    already implemented TextMarshaler and/or BinaryMarshaler.
  * encoding/json: When marshaling, a struct field with the new
    omitzero option in the struct field tag will be omitted if its
    value is zero. If the field type has an IsZero() bool method,
    that will be used to determine whether the value is
    zero. Otherwise, the value is zero if it is the zero value for
    its type. The omitzero field tag is clearer and less
    error-prone than omitempty when the intent is to omit zero
    values. In particular, unlike omitempty, omitzero omits
    zero-valued time.Time values, which is a common source of
    friction.
  * encoding/json: If both omitempty and omitzero are specified,
    the field will be omitted if the value is either empty or zero
    (or both).
  * encoding/json: UnmarshalTypeError.Field now includes embedded
    structs to provide more detailed error messages.
  * go/types: All go/types data structures that expose sequences
    using a pair of methods such as Len() int and At(int) T now
    also have methods that return iterators, allowing you to
    simplify code. The methods are: Interface.EmbeddedTypes,
    Interface.ExplicitMethods, Interface.Methods,
    MethodSet.Methods, Named.Methods, Scope.Children,
    Struct.Fields, Tuple.Variables, TypeList.Types,
    TypeParamList.TypeParams, Union.Terms.
  * hash/adler32: The value returned by New now also implements the
    encoding.BinaryAppender interface.
  * hash/crc32: The values returned by New and NewIEEE now also
    implement the encoding.BinaryAppender interface.
  * hash/crc64: The value returned by New now also implements the
    encoding.BinaryAppender interface.
  * hash/fnv: The values returned by New32, New32a, New64, New64a,
    New128 and New128a now also implement the
    encoding.BinaryAppender interface.
  * hash/maphash: The new Comparable and WriteComparable functions
    can compute the hash of any comparable value. These make it
    possible to hash anything that can be used as a Go map key.
  * log/slog: The new DiscardHandler is a handler that is never
    enabled and always discards its output.
  * log/slog: Level and LevelVar now implement the
    encoding.TextAppender interface.
  * math/big: Float, Int and Rat now implement the
    encoding.TextAppender interface.
  * math/rand: Calls to the deprecated top-level Seed function no
    longer have any effect. To restore the old behavior use GODEBUG
    setting randseednop=0. For more background see proposal
    go#67273.
  * math/rand/v2: ChaCha8 and PCG now implement the
    encoding.BinaryAppender interface.
  * net: ListenConfig now uses MPTCP by default on systems where it
    is supported (currently on Linux only).
  * net: IP now implements the encoding.TextAppender interface.
  * net/http: Transport's limit on 1xx informational responses
    received in response to a request has changed. It previously
    aborted a request and returned an error after receiving more
    than 5 1xx responses. It now returns an error if the total size
    of all 1xx responses exceeds the
    Transport.MaxResponseHeaderBytes configuration setting.
  * net/http: In addition, when a request has a
    net/http/httptrace.ClientTrace.Got1xxResponse trace hook, there
    is now no limit on the total number of 1xx responses. The
    Got1xxResponse hook may return an error to abort a request.
  * net/http: Transport and Server now have an HTTP2 field which
    permits configuring HTTP/2 protocol settings.
  * net/http: The new Server.Protocols and Transport.Protocols
    fields provide a simple way to configure what HTTP protocols a
    server or client use.
  * net/http: The server and client may be configured to support
    unencrypted HTTP/2 connections.
  * net/http: When Server.Protocols contains UnencryptedHTTP2, the
    server will accept HTTP/2 connections on unencrypted ports. The
    server can accept both HTTP/1 and unencrypted HTTP/2 on the
    same port.
  * net/http: When Transport.Protocols contains UnencryptedHTTP2
    and does not contain HTTP1, the transport will use unencrypted
    HTTP/2 for http:// URLs. If the transport is configured to use
    both HTTP/1 and unencrypted HTTP/2, it will use HTTP/1.
  * net/http: Unencrypted HTTP/2 support uses "HTTP/2 with Prior
    Knowledge" (RFC 9113, section 3.3). The deprecated "Upgrade:
    h2c" header is not supported.
  * net/netip: Addr, AddrPort and Prefix now implement the
    encoding.BinaryAppender and encoding.TextAppender interfaces.
  * net/url: URL now also implements the encoding.BinaryAppender
    interface.
  * os/user: On Windows, Current can now be used in Windows Nano
    Server. The implementation has been updated to avoid using
    functions from the NetApi32 library, which is not available in
    Nano Server.
  * os/user: On Windows, Current, Lookup and LookupId now support
    the following built-in service user accounts: NT
    AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE, NT
    AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
  * os/user: On Windows, Current has been made considerably faster
    when the current user is joined to a slow domain, which is the
    usual case for many corporate users. The new implementation
    performance is now in the order of milliseconds, compared to
    the previous implementation which could take several seconds,
    or even minutes, to complete.
  * os/user: On Windows, Current now returns the process owner user
    when the current thread is impersonating another
    user. Previously, it returned an error.
  * regexp: Regexp now implements the encoding.TextAppender
    interface.
  * runtime: The GOROOT function is now deprecated. In new code
    prefer to use the system path to locate the "go" binary, and
    use go env GOROOT to find its GOROOT.
  * strings: The strings package adds several functions that work
    with iterators.
  * strings: Lines returns an iterator over the newline-terminated
    lines in a string.
  * strings: SplitSeq returns an iterator over all substrings of a
    string split around a separator.
  * strings: SplitAfterSeq returns an iterator over substrings of a
    string split after each instance of a separator.
  * strings: FieldsSeq returns an iterator over substrings of a
    string split around runs of whitespace characters, as defined
    by unicode.IsSpace.
  * strings: FieldsFuncSeq returns an iterator over substrings of a
    string split around runs of Unicode code points satisfying a
    predicate.
  * sync: The implementation of sync.Map has been changed,
    improving performance, particularly for map modifications. For
    instance, modifications of disjoint sets of keys are much less
    likely to contend on larger maps, and there is no longer any
    ramp-up time required to achieve low-contention loads from the
    map. If you encounter any problems, set
    GOEXPERIMENT=nosynchashtriemap at build time to switch back to
    the old implementation and please file an issue.
  * testing: The new T.Context and B.Context methods return a
    context that's canceled after the test completes and before
    test cleanup functions run.
  * testing: The new T.Chdir and B.Chdir methods can be used to
    change the working directory for the duration of a test or
    benchmark.
  * text/template: Templates now support range-over-func and
    range-over-int.
  * time: Time now implements the encoding.BinaryAppender and
    encoding.TextAppender interfaces.
  * Linux port: As announced in the Go 1.23 release notes, Go 1.24
    requires Linux kernel version 3.2 or later.
  * Darwin port: Go 1.24 is the last release that will run on macOS
    11 Big Sur. Go 1.25 will require macOS 12 Monterey or later.
  * WebAssembly: The go:wasmexport compiler directive is added for
    Go programs to export functions to the WebAssembly host.
  * WebAssembly: On WebAssembly System Interface Preview 1
    (GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm), Go 1.24 supports building a Go
    program as a reactor/library, by specifying the
    -buildmode=c-shared build flag.
  * WebAssembly: More types are now permitted as argument or result
    types for go:wasmimport functions. Specifically, bool, string,
    uintptr, and pointers to certain types are allowed (see the
    documentation for detail), along with 32-bit and 64-bit integer
    and float types, and unsafe.Pointer, which are already
    allowed. These types are also permitted as argument or result
    types for go:wasmexport functions.
  * WebAssembly: The support files for WebAssembly have been moved
    to lib/wasm from misc/wasm.
  * Windows: The 32-bit windows/arm port (GOOS=windows GOARCH=arm)
    has been marked broken. See issue go#70705 for details.
