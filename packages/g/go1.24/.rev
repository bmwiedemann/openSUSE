    <comment>- go1.24 (released 2025-02-11) is a major release of Go.
  go1.24.x minor releases will be provided through February 2026.
  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle
  go1.24 arrives six months after Go 1.23. Most of its changes are
  in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and
  libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of
  compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to
  compile and run as before.
