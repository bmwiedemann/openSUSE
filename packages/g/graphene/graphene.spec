%description
The Graphene library provides types and their relative API for affine
matrices, 4×4 matrices, projections, transformations, vectors and
quaternions.

%description -n libgraphene-1_0-0
When creating graphic libraries you most likely end up dealing with points
and rectangles. If you're particularly unlucky, you may end up dealing
with affine matrices and 2D transformations. If you're writing a graphic
library with 3D transformations, though, you are going to hit the jackpot:
4x4 matrices, projections, transformations, vectors, and quaternions.

This library provides types and their relative API; it does not deal with
windowing system surfaces, drawing, scene graphs, or input. You're
supposed to do that yourself, in your own canvas implementation, which is
the whole point of writing the library in the first place.
