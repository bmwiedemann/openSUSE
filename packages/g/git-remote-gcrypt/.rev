    <comment>- Update to 1.2:
  * When the repository cannot be found, but the repo ID is set,
    output the stderr of other commands to help the user figure out
	what's wrong (Closes: #914059).
  * Note that git-remote-gcrypt's &quot;not found&quot; error can be misleading.
- Update to 1.1:
  * Add CONTRIBUTING.md and DEVELOPER-CERTIFICATE.
  * Add experimental rclone backend (for early adoptors only).
- Update to 1.0.3:
  * Add note about non-standard rsync:// URI format.
  * Improve first section of manpage.
  * Add &quot;Known issues&quot; to README.
- Update to 1.0.2:
  Bug fixes:
  * Correctly handle the case where gcrypt.gpg-args contains more than one
    argument, separated by spaces.
    Thanks Etienne Brodu for the patch.
  Documentation:
  * Drop section &quot;Note to users of GnuPG version 2&quot;.
    The issue was a regression in GnuPG 2.x, fixed in version 2.1.16.
  * Add a note about performance when not using the rsync:// or local backends.
  * Add section containing author and maintainer information.
  * Add `apt-get` installation instructions, for the benefit of GitHub users.
  * Other minor edits and formatting changes.
- Install real changelog file and not a link
 
- Update to 1.0.1:
  * Add authorship details to script header
- Get proper release tarball from GH now. Before used commit id
  30b3f5e3356bba404eb630807879b8d4989f8c6e which was tag 1.0.0
  on private repo of maintainer
- Use rst2man to generate manpage, install that instead of readme
- Use website of new maintainer
