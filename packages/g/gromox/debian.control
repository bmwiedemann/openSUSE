Description: Groupware server (backend) with RPCH, IMAP and Z-MAPI support
 .
 Gromox is the central groupware server component of grommunio. It is
 capable of serving as a replacement for Microsoft Exchange and
 compatibles. Connectivity options include Outlook Anywhere
 (RPC-over-HTTP), IMAP/POP3, an SMTP-speaking LDA, and a PHP module
 with a Z-MAPI function subset.
 .
 Gromox relies on other components to provide a sensibly complete
 mail system, such as Postfix as a mail transfer agent, and
 grommunio-admin for user management. A web interface is available with
 grommunio-web. The grommunio distribution ships these essentials and has a
 ready-to-run installation of Gromox.
