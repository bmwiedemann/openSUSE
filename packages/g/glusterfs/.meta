  <title>Aggregating distributed file system</title>
  <description>
GlusterFS is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several 
petabytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA
or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file system.
GlusterFS is one of the most sophisticated file systems in terms of
features and extensibility. It borrows a powerful concept called
Translators from GNU Hurd kernel. Much of the code in GlusterFS is in
user space and easily manageable.
