  This is still a backwards jump from v3.6.0 (7.0.0) and v3.5.3 (6).
* Package glfsheal again

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 15 15:03:38 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.6.1
  * api: versioned symbols in libgfapi.so for compatibility
  * Use versioned symbols to keep libgfapi at libgfapi.so.0.0.0
  * Some nits uncovered:
   - there are a couple functions declared that do not have an
     associated definition, e.g. glfs_truncate(), glfs_caller_specific_init() 
   - there are seven private/internal functions used by heal/src/glfsheal
     and the gfapi master xlator (glfs-master.c): glfs_loc_touchup(),
     glfs_active_subvol(), and glfs_subvol_done(), glfs_init_done(),
     glfs_resolve_at(), glfs_free_from_ctx(), and glfs_new_from_ctx();
     which are not declared in glfs.h;
   - for this initial pass at versioned symbols, we use the earliest version
     of all public symbols, i.e. those for which there are declarations in
     glfs.h or glfs-handles.h.
     Further investigation as we do backports to 3.6, 3.4, and 3.4
     will be required to determine if older implementations need to
     be preserved (forward ported) and their associated alias(es) and
     symbol version(s) defined.

    EINVAL

    while performing rolling upgrade.
  * [AFR] I/O fails when one of the replica nodes go down
  * Fix inode leaks in gfid-access xlator

    entries are used

    is back online after a restart

    propagate to slaves.

Tue Jul 29 19:48:39 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- Update to new upstream release 3.5.1

    This option should be used when users of a volume are in more
    than approximately 93 groups (Bug 1096425).
  * Duplicate Request Cache for NFS has now been disabled by
    default, this may reduce performance for certain workloads,
    but improves the overall stability and memory footprint for
    most users.
  * Others changes are mostly bug fixes.
- disable systemd pre an post scripts for old product and then fix
  build on SLE 11  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  5 22:40:02 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 3.5.0
* AFR_CLI_enhancements: Improved logging with more clarity and
  statistical information. It allows visibility into why a
  self-heal process was initiated and which files are affected, for
  example. Prior to this enhancement, clearly identifying
  split-brain issues from the logs was often difficult, and there
  was no facility to identify which files were affected by a split
  brain issue automatically. Remediating split brain without quorum
  will still require some manual effort, but with the tools
  provided, this will become much simpler.
* Exposing Volume Capabilities: Provides client-side insight into
  whether a volume is using the BD translator and, if so, which
  capabilities are being utilized.
* File Snapshot: Provides a mechanism for snapshotting individual
  files. The most prevalent use case for this feature will be to
  snapshot running VMs, allowing for point-in-time capture. This
  also allows a mechanism to revert VMs to a previous state
  directly from Gluster, without needing to use external tools.
* GFID Access: A new method for accessing data directly by GFID.
  With this method, the data can be directly consumed in changelog
  translator, which is logging ‘gfid’ internally, very efficiently.
* On-Wire Compression + Decompression: Use of this feature reduces
  the overall network overhead for Gluster operations from a
  client.
* Prevent NFS restart on Volume change (Part 1): Previously, any
  volume change (volume option, volume start, volume stop, volume
  delete, brick add, etc.) would restart the NFS server, which led
  to service disruptions. This feature allow modifying certain
  NFS-based volume options without such interruptions occurring.
  Part 1 is anything not requiring a graph change.
* Quota Scalability: Massively increase the amount of quota
  configurations from a few hundred to 65536 per volume.
* readdir_ahead: Gluster now provides read-ahead support for
  directories to improve sequential directory read performance.
* zerofill: Enhancement to allow zeroing out of VM disk images,
  which is useful in first time provisioning or for overwriting an
  existing disk.
* Brick Failure Detection: Detecting failures on the filesystem
  that a brick uses makes it possible to handle errors that are
  caused from outside of the Gluster environment.
* Disk encryption: Implement the previous work done in HekaFS into
  Gluster. This allows a volume (or per-tenant part of a volume) to
  be encrypted “at rest” on the server using keys only available on
  the client. [Note: Only content of regular files is encrypted.
  File names are not encrypted! Also, encryption does not work in
  NFS mounts.]
* Geo-Replication Enhancement: Previously, the geo-replication
  process, gsyncd, was a single point of failure as it only ran on
  one node in the cluster. If the node running gsyncd failed, the
  entire geo-replication process was offline until the issue was
  addressed. In this latest incarnation, the improvement is
  extended even further by foregoing use of xattrs to identify
  change candidates and directly consuming from the volume
  changelog, which will improve performance twofold: one, by
  keeping a running list of only those files that may need to be
  synced; and two, the changelog is maintained in memory, which
  will allow near instant access to which data needs to be changed
  and where by the gsync daemon.
