  <title>Android 4.0 Sans Serif Fonts</title>
  <description>The Android design language relies on traditional typographic tools such as scale, space, rhythm, and alignment with an underlying grid. Successful deployment of these tools is essential to help users quickly understand a screen of information. 

To support such use of typography, Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) introduced a new type family named Roboto, created specifically for the requirements of UI and high-resolution screens.


Designer: Christian Robertson
