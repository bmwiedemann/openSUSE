Subject: [PATCH] usb-protection: Treat hubs and HID devices like any other USB
 gadget

The checks on the classes offered by a USB device are pretty lax and
uninformative from the kernel and UsbGuard levels, so our attempt at
user friendliness with USB hubs and HID devices may result in everyone
(lastly us) allowing maliciously crafted devices that present themselves
as one of these devices, but implement other classes (e.g. mass storage).

We believe this is ultimately an issue in the lower layers if this
may go through as good up to us and we cannot truly believe UsbGuard
information, but it is definitely us being the front face of this issue.

Avoid treating USB hubs and HID devices different to any other USB
gadget, this will require users to "enroll" them the same ways.
