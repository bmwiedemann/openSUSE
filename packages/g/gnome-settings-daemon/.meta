  <title>Settings daemon for the GNOME desktop</title>
  <description>gnome-settings-daemon provides a daemon run by all GNOME sessions to
provide live access to configuration settings and the changes done to
them as well as basic services like a clipboard manager, controlling
the startup of the screensaver, etc.

This module was previously part of GNOME Control Center, but has been
splitted from it for a more general use.</description>
