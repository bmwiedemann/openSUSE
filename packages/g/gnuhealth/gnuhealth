You have installed GNU Health and no idea how it should work.
(Otherwise you would not see this message)

How about reading a fine manual? You find it at
/usr/share/doc/packages/gnuhealth/GNUHealth.README.SUSE

Or see the full documentation at
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GNU_Health

Want to start immediately with some configuration?
Run openSUSE-gnuhealth-setup

Whatever you do...have fun!
