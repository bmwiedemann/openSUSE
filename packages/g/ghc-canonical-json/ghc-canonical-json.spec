%description
An implementation of Canonical JSON.

<http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Canonical_JSON>

The "canonical JSON" format is designed to provide repeatable hashes of
JSON-encoded data. It is designed for applications that need to hash, sign or
authenitcate JSON data structures, including embedded signatures.

Canonical JSON is parsable with any full JSON parser, and it allows whitespace
for pretty-printed human readable presentation, but it can be put into a
canonical form which then has a stable serialised representation and thus a
stable hash.
