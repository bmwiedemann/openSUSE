  <title>GTK key theme that sets ctrl-u in text entries</title>
  <description>A GTK key theme that make ctrl-u, ctrl-w and ctrl-h work in text
entries and text views. In contrast to the Emacs key theme which
redefines many other common key bindings (like ctrl-p) this is
one is reduced to the bare minimum to make text entries usable.
