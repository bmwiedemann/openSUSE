  <title>The Glasgow Haskell Compilation system</title>
  <description>Haskell is the standard purely functional programming language; the
current language version is Haskell 98, agreed in December 1998.

GHC is a state-of-the-art programming suite for Haskell.  Included is
an optimising compiler generating good code for a variety of
platforms, together with an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.  The distribution includes space and time profiling
facilities, a large collection of libraries, and support for various
language extensions, including concurrency, exceptions, and foreign
language interfaces (C, C++, etc).

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interprbeters, references,
contact information, links to research groups) are available from the
Haskell home page at &lt;http://www.haskell.org/&gt;.
