Tue Dec  5 00:06:11 UTC 2017 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org


Update to version 1.8.10:
  * Support for scan options without ranges, e.g. booleans, in
    tolerance check introduced in version 1.8.9.
Changes from version 1.8.9:
  * Rename preference "Open scan dialog at program start"
    -> "Open scanner at program start".
  * Fix killing processes on cancel.
  * Hide extended page numbering checkbox and source document
    frame unless scanner is not capable of duplex and ADF is
    selected. Therefore, for duplex-capable scanners, this is
    never shown. For duplex-incapable scanners, this is shown if
    the ADF is selected, but otherwise hidden.
  * Support for the new API in ImageMagick 7 for unsharp mask.
  * For single-sided documents, hide rotate facing/reverse/both
    side dropdown.
  * Missing documentation for Edit/Properties.
  * Don't reapply scan settings if value is within tolerance,
    (sf#287 Reload recursion limit (5050) exceeded).
  * Fix crash reading corrupt config file, (sf#288).
  * Translation updates.
- Changes from version 1.8.8:
  * Filter out 1 and 2 digit integers from tool warnings. Show
    original message, not filtered message, (sf#281 Error
    processing with Tesserarct: Detected 99 Diacritics).
  * Add option to profile only after successfully applying it.
  * Fix default value for unpaper script direction.
  * Fix race condition updating widgets before they can be created
    after cycling device handle.
  * Fix 16-bit PNM parsing.
  * Fix Perl warning about redundant argument in sprintf.
  * Translation updates.
- Changes from version 1.8.7:
  * Units to scan and edit paper dialogues.
  * Unsupported libsane-perl offered as Frontend choice
  * Fixed support for Poppler (pdftops) as postscript backend.
  * Reload recursion limit in Edit/Preferences, set reload
    recursion limit as triangular number of number of scan
    options, (sf#275 reload recursion limit).
  * Fixed crash with scanimage frontend due to empty cache.
  * Ghost save button, rather than hiding save dialogue if all
    pages removed, (sf#253 Save dialoque does not stay open).
  * Fixed bug causing profile dropdown to be cleared after setting
    profile.
  * Filter out integers from tool warnings, analogous to the hex
    warnings from unpaper.
  * Fixed visibility of options in save dialogue (again).
  * Right mouse click in thumbnail panel makes the page range, for
    example in save dialogue: default to "selected".
  * Take filename of PDF to email from default filename settings
    (and therefore from metadata). If this produces a blank
    filename, use "document.pdf".
  * Fixed bug requiring scan dialog to be requested twice after
    changing frontend.
  * Translation updates.
