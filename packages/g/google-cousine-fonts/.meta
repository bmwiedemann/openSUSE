  <description>Cousine was designed by Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing sans serif design that is metrically compatible with Courier New. Cousine offers improved on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts to address document portability across platforms.</description>
