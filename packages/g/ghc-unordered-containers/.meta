  <title>Efficient hashing-based container types</title>
  <description>
Efficient hashing-based container types. The containers have been optimized
for performance critical use, both in terms of large data quantities and high
speed.

The declared cost of each operation is either worst-case or amortized, but
remains valid even if structures are shared.
