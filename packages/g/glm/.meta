  <title>A C++ mathematics library for 3D graphics</title>
  <description>OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics
software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification.
 
GLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same naming
conventions and functionalities than GLSL so that when a programmer knows GLSL,
he knows GLM as well which makes it really easy to use.
 
This project isn't limited by GLSL features. An extension system, based on the
GLSL extension conventions, provides extended capabilities: matrix
transformations, quaternions, half-based types, random numbers, etc...
 
This library works perfectly with OpenGL but it also ensures interoperability
with other third party libraries and SDKs. It is a good candidate for software
rendering (Raytracing / Rasterisation), image processing, physic simulations and
any context that requires a simple and convenient mathematics library.
