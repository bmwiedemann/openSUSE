%description
In many cases, it is useful (either for error checking or documentation
reasons) to define input and output types as having a particular unit of time.
In addition, by creating a type class defining type units, this library should
make it easier to separate the units of time the developer wants to think in
versus the units of time the library author wants to think in.
