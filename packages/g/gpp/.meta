  <title>Generic Preprocessor</title>
  <description>GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax, suitable
for a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its independence from any one
programming language makes it much more versatile than the C preprocessor
(cpp), while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than that of GNU m4.
There are built-in macros for use with C/C++, LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and
Prolog files.
