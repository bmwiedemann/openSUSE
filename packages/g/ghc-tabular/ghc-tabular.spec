%description
Tabular provides a Haskell representation of two-dimensional data tables, the
kind that you might find in a spreadsheet or or a research report. It also
comes with some default rendering functions for turning those tables into ASCII
art, simple text with an arbitrary delimiter, CSV, HTML or LaTeX.

Below is an example of the kind of output this library produces. The tabular
package can group rows and columns, each group having one of three separators
(no line, single line, double line) between its members.

> || memtest 1 | memtest 2 || time test | time test 2 >

terrible || slow | slower > A 2 || pig | not bad || fast | slowest >
----++-----------+-----------++-------------+------------ > B 1 || good | awful
|| intolerable | bearable > B 2 || better | no chance || crawling | amazing > B
3 || meh | well... || worst ever | ok.
