- Update doclayout to version 0.3.
  ## 0.3

    * Add foldlChar to signature of HasChars [API change].
    * Use foldlChar in realLength. This avoids a stack overflow
      we were getting with long strings in the previous version
      (with foldrChar).  See jgm/pandoc#6031.
    * Replace isBlank with isBreakable and improved startsWithBlank.
      Previously isBlank was used in the layout algorithm where
      what we really wanted was isBreakable.
    * Avoid unnecessary calculation in updateColumns.
    * Replace a right fold with a strict left fold.
    * Add strictness annotations in realLength and updateColumn.
