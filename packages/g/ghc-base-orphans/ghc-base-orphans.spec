%description
'base-orphans' defines orphan instances that mimic instances available in later
versions of 'base' to a wider (older) range of compilers.
'base-orphans' does not export anything except the orphan instances themselves
and complements '<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-compat base-compat>'.

See the README for what instances are covered:
<https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-orphans#readme>. See also the
<https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-orphans#what-is-not-covered what is not
covered> section.
