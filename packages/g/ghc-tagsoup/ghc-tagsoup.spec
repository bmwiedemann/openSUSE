%description
TagSoup is a library for parsing HTML/XML. It supports the HTML 5
specification, and can be used to parse either well-formed XML, or unstructured
and malformed HTML from the web. The library also provides useful functions to
extract information from an HTML document, making it ideal for screen-scraping.

Users should start from the "Text.HTML.TagSoup" module.
