  <title>Parsing and extracting information from (possibly malformed) HTML/XML documents</title>
  <description>
	  TagSoup is a library for parsing HTML/XML. It supports the HTML 5
	  specification, and can be used to parse either well-formed XML, or
	  unstructured and malformed HTML from the web. The library also provides
	  useful functions to extract information from an HTML document, making
	  it ideal for screen-scraping.

	  Users should start from the Text.HTML.TagSoup module.
