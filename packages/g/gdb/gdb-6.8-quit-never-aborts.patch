Subject: gdb-6.8-quit-never-aborts.patch

;; Make the GDB quit processing non-abortable to cleanup everything properly.
;;=fedora: It was useful only after gdb-6.8-attach-signalled-detach-stopped.patch .

We may abort the process of detaching threads with multiple SIGINTs - which are
being sent during a testcase terminating its child GDB.

Some of the threads may not be properly PTRACE_DETACHed which hurts if they
should have been detached with SIGSTOP (as they are accidentally left running
on the debugger termination).
