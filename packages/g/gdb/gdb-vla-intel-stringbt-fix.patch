I have it reproducible on Fedora 20 i686 with plain
CFLAGS=-g ./configure;make;cd gdb/testsuite;make site.exp;runtest gdb.fortran/dynamic-other-frame.exp

Besides that I have updated the testcase with
	gdb_test_no_output "set print frame-arguments all"
so that there is no longer needed the patch:
	[patch] Display Fortran strings in backtraces
	https://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2014-07/msg00709.html

The fix below has no regressions for me.  Unfortunately I do not see why you
cannot reproduce it.

Thanks,
Jan
