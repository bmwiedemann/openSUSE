%description
This package includes backported versions of types that were added to
transformers in transformers 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 for users who need strict
transformers 0.2 or 0.3 compatibility to run on old versions of the platform,
but also need those types.

Those users should be able to just depend on 'transformers >= 0.2' and
'transformers-compat >= 0.3'.

Note: missing methods are not supplied, but this at least permits the types to
be used.
