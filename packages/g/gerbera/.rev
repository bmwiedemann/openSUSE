    <comment>- Update to 1.9.0:
  * New or Improved features:
    + Many more things have been added to configuration (order of
      resources for album art, DLNA profiles, upnp properties).
      Please consult https://docs.gerbera.io/en/stable/config-overview.html
      for the exact usage
    + Gerbera now can display dynamic containers, i.e. its contents
      are calculated as you click. This may show you recently add
      or changed media
    + Gerbera now supports client specific transcoding, i.e. video
      is only transcode for your older devices, newer can stream it
      as it is
    + The compatibility with Samsung TV sets was increase again
    + Minor media and upnp additions in search allow you to make
      the most out of your files
  * Refactoring of Code in Database Layer: this means that after
    the upgrade to 1.9.0 it's not possible to downgrade
  * Lots of small bug fixed

    <comment>- Update to 1.9.2:
* Titles of search results can be configured
* Containers in virtual layout can be defined as search result, so,
  e.g. albums, located in several places are only found once
* Metadata, like artist, appearing multiple times are now stored
  in that way and can be sent to UPnP clients as separate entries
  as well or addressed in layout scripts. If you have a custom js
  import script which updates metadata you have to modify it using
  the new properties (see doc on scripting)
* DLNA profile can be configured using video and audio codec,
  allow devices to pick supported streams
* DLNA profile can be set for transcoding
- Fix spec file
- Add config.xml
- Remove unneeded tmpfile
- Added hardening to systemd service(s) (bsc#1181400). Added patch(es):
  * harden_gerbera.service.patch
