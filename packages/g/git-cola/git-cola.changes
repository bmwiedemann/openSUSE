Sat Nov 25 19:10:38 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.4.1:
  * Usability, bells and whistles
  * The remote messages dialog is now displayed for the Pull and
    Push actions in the
  * Branches widget only. This dialog is disabled by default and
    enabled in the
  * main Push and Pull dialog settings.
  * The whole-file staging actions in the Diff widget's right-
    click menu are now listed
  * after the selection and hunk staging actions. This helps
    prevent accidental clicks
  * from clobbering the index for the entire file.
  * The completion popup no longer reappears after an item is
    selected in the
  * "Checkout Branch" action and similar dialogs.
  * Fixes
  * PyQt6 compatibility was improved.
- switch to PyQt6

Sat Nov 18 08:53:39 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.4.0:
  * Git Cola now preserves `# commentary` in commit messages by
    default.
  * `git dag` now includes completions for `git log` options in
    the text input field.
  * `git dag` now provides convenient search filters when right-
    clicking in the text input field.
  * A `1.25 x` Hi-DPI magnification option mode is now available
    in the Appearance settings.
  * Git Cola now runs `git commit` in the background and feedback
    is provided while the commit is running. This prevents the
    UI from freezing when running pre-commit hooks that can make
    `git commit` take a long time to run.
  * The Diff context menu was reworked to reduce visual clutter
    and better match the Status context menu.
  * The standalone `git cola tag` tool now autocompletes the tag
    name field.
  * The "Branches" dock widget now has a "Visualize" right-click
    menu option.
  * The "Stash" dialog learned to rename stashes.
  * The "Fetch", "Push" and "Pull" dialogs can now display remote
    messages from the server.
  * `git dag` fixed how it was handling refspec arguments.
  * `git dag` will now properly refresh itself when remote
    branches are updated.
  * Git Cola's python code style. We were previously disabling
    quote normalization when using `black`. Use of `cercis`
    allows us to enable quote normalization under its default
    single-quote settings.
  * Compatibility with Sphinx 7.2.0 was added to the
    `sphinxtogithub` sphinx documentation plugin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  2 18:31:13 UTC 2023 - Marcin Bajor <marcin.bajor@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.3.2

Sun Aug 13 23:26:22 UTC 2023 - Marcin Bajor <marcin.bajor@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.3.0
- Usability, bells and whistles
  * `git dag` now displays commit metadata more similarly to `git log`.
    The commit date is now displayed and the subject field is displayed
    directly above the extended description.
  * `git dag` now supports a `cola.logdate` configuration for controlling
    the date format. The configured value is passed to `git log --date=<format>`.
    https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1319
    https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1312
  * The default `patches` directory that is used when exporting patches
    is now configurable using the `cola.patchesdirectory` configuration
    variable and the Preferences dialog.
  * The Diff Editor can now export the diff selection, or the current
    diff hunk, to a `*.patch` file from the `Patches` context menu action.
  * Existing patches can be appended to by choosing a patch file from
    the `Append Patch` sub-menu in the `Patches` context menu action.
  * Patches can now be applied by dragging and dropping patches files from
    a file browser onto the diff editor. The "Apply Patches" dialog is
    launched with the drag-and-dropped patch files.
  * Shell completions for zsh are now provided in the source distribution.
    See the `contrib/_git-cola` zsh completion file for more details
- Fixes
  * ``QApplication::desktop()`` is no longer available on PyQt6.
    Git Cola no longer relies on this method.
- Packaging
  * Git Cola can now be installed on Windows using `winget`.
    See the ``README.md`` file for more details.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1308

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 27 19:35:28 UTC 2023 - Marcin Bajor <marcin.bajor@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.2.0
- Usability, bells and whistles
* The Diff Editor can now send diffs to your favorite editor before the diffs are applied.
  The right-click "Edit Diff ..." menu actions and the `Ctrl + Shift + S` /
  `Ctrl + Shift + U` hotkeys send the current diff hunk, or the selected diff, to your
  editor before they are applied to the worktree / staging area.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1290
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/794
* The Diff Editor and DAG viewer can now search within their diffs using
  `Ctrl + F` and `Ctrl + G` hotkeys.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1116
* A new *Diff Mode* can be used to diff and unstage edits relative to any commit.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/816
* The Commit Message Editor can now spell-check the summary field. Previously only the
  "Extended Description..." field supported spell checking.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/633
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1070
* Repositories in your "Recents" and "Favorites" can now be searched using the new
  "Search" tool button. Quickly switch between these repositories using the `Alt + P`
  hotkey and "Quick Open..." File menu action.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1282
* "Favorites", "Recents" and the startup dialog now display a case-insensitively
  sorted list of repositories.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1047
* The startup dialog now has a right-click context menu that allows you to prune
  stale entries and other actions that were not previously accessible from
  the startup dialog.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1199
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1280
* The "Copy Leading Paths" action in the Status tool's right-click "Copy" sub-menu
  can now strip off an arbitrary number of leading paths.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/784
* The "Cherry-Pick" action now reports errors when "git cherry-pick" fails.
  A new "Abort Cherry-Pick" action has been added for aborting a failed cherry-pick.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1062
* The diff text can now be quickly zoomed using `Ctrl + Mouse wheel` scroll.
  This will quickly change the text size within the current session only.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1029
* The Console and Diff widgets learned to open URLs. Right-click on a line
  that contains http URLs and context-menu actions for opening each URL
  using your default web browser will be displayed.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1139
* Drag-and-drop has been improved when dragging filenames from the Status tool.
  Dragging multiple files requires special handling to improve usability.
  Some terminals (such as `kitty`) consume multiple file URLs by separating paths with
  newlines. This is useful when you'd like to capture raw filenames but is less
  convenient when dropping  filenames onto a command-line. Drag with the `Alt`-modifier
  held down to drag-and-drop filenames for command-line use. Using the `Alt` modifier
  omits URLs so that the drag-and-drop payload includes only space-delimited,
  shell-quoted paths.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/719
* The DAG viewer now displays the diff between the start and end commits when
  multiple commits are selected. The diffs are displayed in the DAG's diff viewer.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/552
* The DAG viewer learned to checkout branches and initiate rebases from its right-click menu.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1113
* The DAG diff viewer learned to word-wrap the diff text.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1242
* The spelling dictionaries are now discovered dynamically at runtime.
  `dict/words` and `dict/propernames` are now discovered via `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`
  by the spell checker. This allows a spelling dictionary to be placed in eg.
  `~/.local/share/dict/words` to override the default `/usr/share/dict/words`.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/873
* The File menu now has a "Patches" sub-menu with a full set of "git am" Patch actions.
* The Diff Editor and various Diff widgets now have a "Copy Diff" action with an
  `Alt + Shift + C` hotkey that copies the selected diff text to the clipboard with the
  `+`, `-` and `<Space>` diff prefix characters removed.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1288
* The "Revert" action for reverting commits from the DAG tool now displays error
  messages when ``git revert`` fails.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/885
* The Diff Editor now uses an easier-to-see *block cursor* by default.
  Disable `cola.blockcursor <https://git-cola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-cola.html#cola-blockcursor>`_
  to continue using original *line cursor* by running
  ``git config --global cola.blockcursor false``, or by editing the settings in the menu.
* The "Unmerged" header item in the Status tool now displays a summary list of unmerged files.
* The hotkeys documentation has been updated to clarify that the "Copy Commit ID"
  action is available in several tools.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/779
* Saving files when using "Browse Other Branch" now displays errors from
  ``git show`` when saving files from arbitrary commits.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1065
* The Apply Patches dialog now reports errors when patches fail to apply.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/673
* The "Status" tool now disables "Copy" actions in its context menu when no
  files have been selected.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/697
* The "Unstage" menu item in the Status tool now uses a "Remove" icon.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1289
- Development
* The vendored `qtpy` module was modified to sever its dependency on the
  `packaging.version` module. This mostly affects users that want to run
  Git Cola directly from the the source tree outside of any virtualenv.

Sat May 28 16:44:10 UTC 2022 - Marcin Bajor <marcin.bajor@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.0.0
- These changes are primarily breaking changes for packagers of Git Cola.
  For example, Linux distribution and Homebrew package maintainers may need to
  be aware of these changes.
  Changes have been made build infrastructure and the resulting filesystem artifacts.
* The build system is now Python3-only and has been modernized for PEP-517/518.
  While Git Cola still builds and runs under Python2, it is no longer officially
  supported and may stop working in a future release without notice.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1201
* The `#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang lines in the `git-cola` and `git-dag` wrapper
  scripts have been updated to use `python3`.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1204
* The build system was switched to `setuptools` and no longer depends on `distutils`.
  ``python setup.py {build,install,build_pot,build_mo}`` are no longer provided.
  Use the https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
  ``python -m build`` tool to generate sdist and wheel distributions,
  and ``pip install .`` to install Git Cola from source.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1204
* The `git-cola`, `git-dag` and `git-cola-sequence-editor` commands are now installed
  using setuptools entry points.
* The `bin/` wrapper scripts in the source tree continue to be provided for convenience
  but they are not the scripts that get installed.
* The `qtpy` Python package is no longer installed alongside the `cola` Python package.
* The `cola` package is now installed into the standard Python site-packages location.
* The `share/git-cola/lib` private Python modules directory no longer exists.
* The `NO_VENDOR_LIBS` and `NO_PRIVATE_LIBS` Makefile options are no longer necessary.
* The `share/git-cola` filesystem namespace no longer exists. All of cola's package data
  is distributed alongside the `cola` module as package data.
* Building the Sphinx documentation now also requires the `jaraco.packaging` and
  `rst.linker` packages. See `requirements/requirements-dev.txt` for the package
  requirement details.
- Usability, bells and whistles
* Custom UI themes
  https://git-cola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-cola.html#custom-themes
  can be used by adding `*.qss` Qt stylesheet files to `~/.config/git-cola/themes/`.

- Update to 3.12.0
- Usability, bells and whistles
* The git config guitool action can now be grouped under user-defined menus.
  This is done by using slash (``/``) delimiters in the action name.
  Entries before the final slash are treated like submenus inside the
  top-level ``Actions`` menu.

  https://github.com/ximion/appstream/blob/master/NEWS#L1363
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1079
* The "cola" modules are now installed into the Python "site-packages"
  directory by default.  This allows distributions to package "git-cola" for
  multiple versions of Python.  See the PACKAGING NOTES section in the README
  for details about suppressing the installation of the private
  "share/git-cola/lib/cola" modules when building cola.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/181
* Git Cola's rebase / sequence editor, formerly known as "git-xbase" and
  installed as "share/git-cola/bin/git-xbase", has been renamed to
  "git-cola-sequence-editor" and is now installed into the default
  "bin/git-cola-sequence-editor" executable location to enable external
  reuse of this general-purpose tool.
* A workaround used by the pynsist installer preamble script was obsoleted by
  https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/pull/149

* The `git-xbase` rebase editor now includes a file list for filtering
  the changes displayed in the diff view.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1051
* The fallback `ssh-askpass` script, which provides the Username/Password
  login dialog when performing remote operations, previously presented both
  the username and password input fields with `***` asterisks.
  The dialog now uses asterisks for the password field only.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1026
* Stashes can now be applied using the `Ctrl + Enter` hotkey, popped with the
  `Ctrl + Backspace` hotkey, and dropped with the `Ctrl + Shift + Backspace`
  hotkey when inside the stash dialog.  This enables a keyboard-centric
  mouse-free workflow when using the stash dialog.
* When amending a commit, `git cola` will check whether the commit has been
  published to a remote branch using `git branch -r --contains HEAD`.
  This command can be slow when operating on a repository with many
  remote branches.  The new `cola.checkpublishedcommits` configuration
  variable allows you to opt-out of this check, which improves performance
  when amending a commit.  The settings widget exposes this variable as,
  "Check Published Commits when Amending".

  remembers the configured number of repositories in the menu.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1024
* The "revert" action in the DAG and other tools now uses
  `git revert --no-edit`, which avoids launching an editor
  when reverting the commit.  Use `Ctrl+m` in the commit message
  editor after reverting a commit to rewrite its commit message.

* The Stash dialog now shows the stash date as a tooltip when hovering
  over a stashed change.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/982>
* Qt HiDPI settings are overriden by the `git cola` HiDPI appearance settings.
  These overrides can now be disabled by selecting the "Disable" mode.
  This allows users to control Qt's HiDPI settings through environment
  variables.  Additionally, the "Auto" mode now detects the presence of
  the Qt HiDPI variables and no longer overrides them when the user has
  configured their environment explicitly.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/963
* Confirmation dialogs can now focus buttons using the Tab key.
  Previously, the "Y" and "N" keys could be used to confirm or deny
  using the keyboard, but "Tab" is more familiar.

  when in "Amend" mode, and removing staged changes.  This behavior has been
  changed to always checkout from the index, which avoids data loss.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/947
* `git cola` has been updated to work with newer versions of `gnome-terminal`
  and no longer shell-quotes its arguments when launching `gnome-terminal`.
  The `cola.terminalshellquote` configuration variable can be set to `true` to
  get the old behavior, or to handle other terminals that take the command to run
  as a single string instead of as arguments to `execv()`.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/935
* `git dag` now properly handles arbitrary input on Python3.
  Previously, an exception would be raised when entering `--grep=xxx` where
  `xxx` is a quoted string with a missing end-quote.

* The textwidth and tabwidth configuration values can now be set per-repository,
  rather than globally only.
* Text entry widgets switched to using a block cursor in v3.2.
  This has been reverted to the original line cursor for consistency with other
  applications and user expectations. (#889)

* The status widget now ensures that each item is visible when selection
  changes.  Previously, if you scrolled to the right to see the name of
  a long filename, and then selected a short filename above it, the widget
  may not have shown the short filename in the viewport.  We now ensure
  that the filenames are visible when the selection changes.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/828

  which prevented the "Stage" action from being present in the menu.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/841
* `git cola` now detects when `git lfs uninstall` has been run.  This allows
  you to re-initialize "Git LFS" in an existing repository where it had been
  previously uninstalled.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/842
* Custom color values that did not contain any hexadecimal digits in the
  `a-f` range were being converted into integers by the config reader.  This
  then caused the configured colors to be ignored.
  These color values are now interpreted correctly.  Additionally, color
  values can now use an optional HTML-like `#` prefix.

  Example `.gitconfig` snippet::

    [cola "color"]
        text = "#0a0303"

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/836

  encoded paths.  Previously, launching external commands could
  lead to tracebacks.

* The “Stash” tool learned to stash staged changes only. Select the “Stage Index” option and only staged changes will be stashed away.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/413
* The “Stash” tool learned to use vim-like navigation keyboard shortcuts, shows error messages when things go wrong, and now saves the “Stash Index” and “Keep Index” options across sessions.
* The Edit menu’s “Copy” and “Select All” actions now forward to either the diff, status, recent, or favorites widgets, based on which widget has focus.
* The “File” and “Edit” menu can now be activated using Alt-{f,e} hotkeys.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/759
* It was easy to accidentally trigger the first action in the Status tool’s context menu when using a quick right-click to bring up the menu. A short sub-second delay was added to ensure that the top-most action is not triggered unless enough time has passed. This prevents accidental activation of the first item (typically “Stage” or “Unstage”) without burdening common use cases.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/755
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/643

* The “Ctrl+S” hotkey now works for the header items in the Status tool. Selected the “Modified” header item and activating the “Stage” hotkey, for example, will stage all modified files. This works for the “Staged”, “Modified”, and “Untracked” headers. This is not enabled for the “Unmerged” header by design.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/772
* The list of “Recent” repositories previously capped the number of repositories shown to 8 repositories. This can be set to a higher value by setting the cola.maxrecent configuration variable.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/752
* The “Create Branch” dialog now prevents invalid branch names.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/765
* Updated Turkish translation.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/756
* Updated Ukrainian translation.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/753
* Updated German translation.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/802
* Updated Czech translation
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/792
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/806
* The window title can be configured to not display the absolute path of the repository.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/775
* The “Edit Remotes” editor learned to edit remote URLS.
* Bare repositories can now be created by selecting the “New Bare Repository…” action from the File menu.
* The “Branches” widget learned to configure upstream branches.
* A new git cola clone sub-command was added for cloning repositories.
- Packaging
* The vendored qtpy library was updated to v1.3.1.
* The macOS installation was made simpler for better compatibility with Homebrew.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/636
* The Windows installer is now much simpler. Git Cola now bundles Python and PyQt5, so users need only install the “Git for Windows” and “Git Cola” installers to get things working.
- Fixes
* Uninitialized difftool errors will now be displayed graphically. They were previously going to the shell.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/457
* Translations marked “fuzzy” will no longer be used when translating strings.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/782
* Deleted unmerged files will now correctly use a deleted icon.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/479
* The Ctrl+C “Copy” hotkey on the diff viewer has been fixed.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/767
* The “Create Tag” dialog did not correctly handle the case when a signed tag is requested, but no message is provided, and the user chooses to create an unannotated tag instead. This convenience fallback will now properly create an unsigned, unannotated tag.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/696
* .gitconfig and .git/config values editable by the Preferences dialog (aka git cola config) will now get unset when set to an empty value. For example, setting a different user.email in the current repository, followed by a subsequent emptying of that field, would previously result in an empty string getting stored in the config. This has been fixed so that the value will now get unset in the config instead.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/406
* Spelling and typofixes.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/748
* core.commentChar is now honored when set in the local repository .git/config.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/766
* The log window was using a format string that did not display correctly in all locales. A locale-aware format is now used.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/800
* The dialog displayed when prompting for a reference could sometimes lose focus.

- Update to 3.0
- Usability, bells and whistles
* Updated Simplified Chinese translation.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/726
* Updated Ukranian translation.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/723
* New Czech translation.

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/743
* The "name" field in the "Create Tag" dialog now includes autocompletion, which makes it easy to see which tags currently exist.
* git cola now has configurable toolbars. Use the View -> Add toolbar menu item to add a toolbar.
* Setting cola.expandtab to true will now expand tabs into spaces in the commit message editor. The number of spaces to insert is determined by consulting cola.tabwidth, which defaults to 8.
* The "Copy SHA-1" hotkey is now Alt + Ctrl + C, to avoid clobbering the ability to copy text from the DAG window.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/705
* The "Prepare Commit Message" action can now be invoked via the Ctrl+Shift+Return shortcut.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/707
* The Branches pane now has a filter field that highlights branches whose names match the string entered into its text field.
* https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/713
* Actions that are triggered in response to button presses were being triggered when the button was pressed, rather than when it was released, which was a usability flaw. All buttons now respond when clicked rather than when pressed.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/715
* The DAG window will now only refresh when object IDs change. Previously, the DAG would redraw itself in response to inotify events, such as filesystem operations, which was disruptive when inspecting a large diff in its diff viewer. The DAG will now only redraw when the object IDs corresponding to its query input changes. Furthermore, when redrawing, the scrollbar positions are retained to minimize disruption to the viewport contents.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/620
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/724
* The "About" dialog now includes the SHA-1 where Git Cola was built.

* The "Status" widget now supports custom "Copy ... to Clipboard" actions.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/437
* The main menu now has an "Edit" menu.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/725
* git dag learned to checkout commits into a detached HEAD state.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/698
* The status widget's context menus now omit actions selection-dependent actions when no file is selected.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/731
* The startup dialog now focuses the repository list so that repositories can be selected with the keyboard without mouse intervention.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/741
- Fixes
* git dag now prevents nodes from overlapping in more situations.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/689
* Adding untracked Git submodule repo directories previously ran git add submodule/ but we now call git add submodule without the trailing slash (/) to avoid staging files that belong to the submodule (which is possibly a git bug). By working around the buggy behavior we allow users to recover by issuing the appropriate git submodule add command to properly register the submodule.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/681
* We now avoid git for-each-ref --sort=version:refname on versions of git older than v2.7.0. Previously we only avoided it for versions older than v2.0.0, which was a mistake.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/686
* The error message displayed when git is not installed has been fixed.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/686
* Adding new remotes was silently broken.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/684
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/685
* The repo selection dialog had errors during startup when the cola.refreshonfocus feature was enabled, as reported on Ubuntu 16.04.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/690
* Restored support for PyQt 4.6 (Centos 6.8)
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/692
* Switching repositories now resets the "Amend Mode" and other settings when switching.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/710
* git rebase error messages now displayed when rebasing fails or stops via the standalone git cola rebase front-end.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/721
* git cola learned to stage broken symlinks.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/727
* The "View History" feature in the Browser tool was fixed, and now disambiguates between refs and paths.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/732
* The diff editor now has better support for files with CRLF rn line endings.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/730
* cola.inotify in a repo-local config is now honored when git cola is launched from a desktop entry (git cola --prompt).

Wed Jul 19 05:14:04 UTC 2017 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to 2.11
- Usability, bells and whistles
* New Ukranian translation.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/670
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/672
* New and improved French translations.
* The new Branches widget makes it easier to checkout, merge, push, and pull branches from a single interface.
git cola now includes a dark icon theme. The dark icon theme can be activated either by setting the GIT_COLA_ICON_THEME environment variable to dark, by configuring cola.icontheme to dark, or by specifying –icon-theme=dark on the command line.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/638
* Autocompletion was added to the Fetch, Push, and Pull dialogs.
* The commit message editor now remembers the “Spellcheck” setting after exiting.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/645
* git dag now uses an improved algorithm for laying out the graph, which avoids collisions under certain graph configurations, and avoids overlapping tag with commits.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/648
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/651
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/654

* Grep now shows a preview of the selected file’s content in a split window below the grep results.
* Grep now includes line numbers in the preview pane’s output.
* Edit Remotes now remembers its window settings after exiting.
* Diff now has an option to display line numbers in the editor.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/136
* Amend Last Commit can now be triggered via the Commit menu in addition to the commit message editor’s options.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/640
* The File Browser tool was made much faster and can now operate on much larger repositories.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/499
* A new “turbo” mode was added that allows you to opt-out of operations that can slow git cola on large repositories. The turbo mode is enabled by configuring git config cola.turbo true. Turbo mode disables the background loading of Git commit messages and other details in the File Browser widget.
* A new GitIgnore dialog allows adding custom gitignore patterns.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/653
* The spellchecker in git cola can now use an additional dictionary by configuring cola.dictionary to the path to a file containing a newline-separated list of words.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/663
* The stash, export patches, diff, and gitignore dialogs now remember their window sizes.
* A new git cola recent sub-command was added for finding recently edited files.
* The Fetch dialog now allows pruning remote branches.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/639
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/680
- Fixes
* git cola‘s spellchecker now supports the new dict-common filesystem layout, and prefers the /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small file over the /usr/share/dict/words provided on older distributions. This makes the spellchecker compatible with Arch, which does not provide a words symlink like Debian.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/663
* Properly handle the case where an existing file is untracked using the File Browser.
* Fix a quirk where the “Create Branch” dialog sometimes required clicking twice on the radio buttons.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/662
* Fixed a focus issue to ensure that “Push”, “Fetch”, and “Pull” can be executed with the press of a single enter key after being shown.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/661
* Committing is now allowed in when resolving a merge results in no changes. This state was previously prevented by the commit message editor, which prevented users from resolving merges that result in no changes.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/679
* The filesystem monitor would sometimes emit backtraces when directories are modified. This has been fixed.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1438522
* Absolute paths are now returned when querying for .git-relative paths from within a submodule, which uses .git-files. This fixes launching git cola from within a subdirectory of a submodule.

* git cola can now invoke the .git/hooks/cola-prepare-commit-msg hook to update the commit message. This hook takes the same parameters as Git’s prepare-commit-message hook. The default path to this hook can be overridden by setting the cola.prepareCommitMessageHook configuration variable.
http://git-cola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-cola.html#prepare-commit-message
* git cola diff (and the corresponding Diff menu actions) can now launch difftool with the standard Ctrl+D hotkey. The Ctrl+E hotkey was also added for launching an editor.
* Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) translation updates.
- Fixes
* git cola now works when installed in non-ascii, utf8-encoded paths.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/629
* Styling issues that caused black backgrounds in various widgets when using PyQ5 on Mac OS X have been fixed.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/624
* The “Open Recent” menu action was broken and has been fixed.

- Usability, bells and whistles
* New Polish translation thanks to Łukasz Wojniłowicz
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/598
* The Bypass Commit Hooks feature now disables itself automatically when a new commit is created. The new behavior turns the option into a single-use flag, which helps prevent users from accidentally leaving it active longer than intended.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/595
* git dag learned to launch an external diff viewer on selected commits. The standard Ctrl+D shortcut can be used to view diffs.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/468

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/599
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/601
* The startup screen now includes a logo and git cola version information.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/526
* The About page was revamped to contain multiple tabs. A new tab was added that provides details about git cola‘’s dependencies. New tabs were also added for giving credit to git cola‘s authors and translators.
* The About page can now be accessed via git cola about.
* The “Fast-forward only” and “No fast-forward” options supported by git pull are now accessible via git cola pull.
* Doing a forced push no longer requires selecting the remote branch.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/618
* git cola push now has an option to suppress the prompt that is shown when pushing would create new remote branches.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/605
* git dag now shows commit messages in a more readable color.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/574
* git cola browse and the status widget learned to launch the OS-specified default action for a file. When used on directories via git cola browse, or when “Open Parent Directory” is used on files, the OS-specified file browser will typically be used.
git cola browse and the status widget learned to launch terminals.
- Fixes
* git cola browse was not updating when expanding items.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/588
* Typofixes in comments, naming, and strings have been applied.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/593

* The Refresh button on the actions panel no longer raises an exception when using PyQt5.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/604
* Fixed a typo in the inotify backend that is triggered when files are removed.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/607
* Fixed a typo when recovering from a failed attempt to open a repository.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/606
* git dag now properly updates itself when launched from the menubar.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/613
* If git-cola is invoked on Windows using start pythonw git-cola, a console window will briefly flash on the screen each time git cola invokes git. The console window is now suppressed.
* We now avoid some problematic Popen flags on Windows which were breaking the git rebase feature on Windows.
* The Save button in git dag‘s “Grab File...” feature now properly prompts for a filename when saving files.
  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/617
- Development
* The qtpy symlink in the source tree has been removed to allow for easier development on Windows.

Sun Jul 31 20:21:46 UTC 2016 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to 2.7
- Fixes
* When repositories stored in non-ASCII, UTF-8-encoded filesystem paths were operated upon with LC_ALL=C set in the environment, unicode errors would occur when using python2. git cola was made more robust and will now operate correctly within this environment.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/581
* Support for the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable was fixed.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/582
- Development
* The unittest.mock module is now used instead of the original mock module when running the git cola test suite using Python3.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/569
- Packaging
* git cola is now compatible with PyQt5, PyQt4, and Pyside. git cola previously supported PyQt4 only, but will now use whichever library is available. Users are not required to upgrade at this time, but PyQt5 support can be enabled anytime by making its python modules available.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/232
NOTE: We do not yet recommend using PyQt5 because there are known exit-on-segfault bugs in Qt5 that have not yet been addressed. git cola is sensitive to this bug and is known to crash on exit when using git dag or the interactive rebase feature on PyQt5.
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-52988
* PyQt4 is stable and there are no known issues when using it so we recommend using it until the Qt5 bugs have been resolved.
git cola now depends on QtPy and includes a bundled copy of the qtpy library. If you are packaging git cola and would prefer to use qtpy from your distribution instead of the built-in version then use make NO_VENDOR_LIBS=1 when building git cola. This will prevent vendored libraries from being installed.

Sun May  1 09:08:27 UTC 2016 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to 2.6
- Usability, bells and whistles
* A new “Reset” sub-menu provides access to running “git reset –mixed” when resetting branch heads and “git reset –merge” when resetting worktrees.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/542
* git cola now supports linked worktrees, i.e. worktrees created by git worktree.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/554
- Fixes
* Diff highlighting is now robust to the user having diff.supressBlankEmpty=true in their git config.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/541

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/545
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pulls/546
* Per-repository git configuration is now properly detected when launching git cola from an application launcher.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/548

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/507
* git dag now uses consistent edge colors across updates.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/512
* git cola‘s Bookmarks widget can now be used to set a “Default Repository”. Under the hood, we set the cola.defaultrepo configuration variable. The default repository is used whenever git cola is launched outside of a Git repostiory. When unset, or when set to a bogus value, git cola will prompt for a repository, as it previously did.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/513
* git cola‘s Russian and Spanish translations were improved thanks to Vaiz and Zeioth.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/514
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/515
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/523
* git cola was translated to Turkish thanks to Barış ÇELİK.

* The status view now supports launching git gui blame. It can be configured to use a different command by setting cola.blameviewer.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/521
* git dag now allows selecting non-contiguous ranges in the log widget.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/468
* Any font can now be chosen for the diff editor, not just monospace fonts.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/525
- Fixes
* xfce4-terminal and gnome-terminal are now supported when launching git mergetool to resolve merges. These terminals require that the command to execute is shell-quoted and passed as a single string argument to -e rather than as additional command line arguments.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/524
* Fixed a unicode problem when formatting the error message that is shown when gitk is not installed. We now handle unicode data in tracebacks generated by python itself.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/528
* The New repository feature was fixed.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/533
* We now use omit the extended description when creating “fixup!” commits, for consistency with the Git CLI. We now include only the one-line summary in the final commit message.

* The user interface is now HiDPI-capable. git-cola now uses SVG icons, and its interface can be scaled by setting the GIT_COLA_SCALE environment variable.
git dag now supports the standard editor, difftool, and history hotkeys. It is now possible to invoke these actions from file widget’s context menu and through the standard hotkeys.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/473
- The Status tool also learned about the history hotkey. Additionally, the Alt-{j,k} aliases are also supported in the Status tool for consistency with the other tools where the non-Alt hotkeys are not available.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/488
*  The File Browser tool now has better default column sizes, and remembers its window size and placement.
* The File Browser now supports the refresh hotkey, and has better behavior when refreshing. The selection is now retained, and new and removed files are found when refreshing.
* A new git-cola-completion.bash completion script is provided in the contrib/ directory. It must be used alongside Git’s completion script. Source it from your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc, etc) after sourcing the git-completion.bash script and you will have command-line completion support for the git cola and git dag sub-commands.
* The “checkout” dialog now offers completion for remote branches and other git refs. This makes it easier to checkout remote branches in a detached head state. Additionally, the checkout dialog also offers completion for remote branches that have not yet been checked out, which makes it easier to create a local tracking branch by just completing for that potential name.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/390
* The “create branch” and “create tag” dialogs now save and restore their window settings.
* The “status” widget can now be configured to use a bold font with a darker background for the header items.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/506
* The “status” widget now remembers its horizontol scrollbar position across updates. This is helpful when working on projects with long paths.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/494

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/501
* We now avoid long for better Python3 compatibility.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/502
* We now use Git’s default merge message when merging branches.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/508
* Miscellaneous fixes
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/485
- Packaging

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/480
* “Launch Editor”, “Launch Difftool”, “Stage/Unstage”, and “Move Up/Down” hotkeys now work when the commit message editor has focus.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/453
* The diff editor now supports the Ctrl+u hotkey for reverting diff hunks and selected lines.
* The core.commentChar Git configuration value is now honored. Commit messages and rebase instruction sheets will now use the configured character for comments. This allows having commit messages that start with # when core.commentChar is configured to its non-default value.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/446
- Fixes
* Diff syntax highlighting was improved to handle more edge cases and false positives.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/467

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 15 09:38:10 UTC 2015 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to 2.2
- Usability, bells and whistles
* Double-click will now choose a commit in the “Select commit” dialog.
* git cola has a feature that reads .git/MERGE_MSG and friends for the commit message when a merge is in-progress. Upon refresh, git cola will now detect when a merge has completed and reset the commit message back to its previous state. It is only reset if the editor contains a message that was read from the file and has not been manually edited by the user.
* The commit message editor’s context menu now has a “Clear...” action for clearing the message across both the summary and description fields.
* Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) translation updates.
* The system theme’s icons are now used whereever possible.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/458
- Fixes
* The stash viewer now uses git show --no-ext-diff to avoid running user-configured diff tools.
* git cola now uses the setsid() system call to ensure that the GIT_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS helper programs are used when pushing changes using git. The askpass helpers will now be used even when git cola is launched from a terminal.

The behavior without setsid() is that git cola can appear to hang while pushing changes. The hang happens when git prompts the user for a password using the terminal, but the user never sees the prompt. setsid() detaches the terminal, which ensures that the askpass helpers are used.

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/218

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/262

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/377
* git dag‘s file list tool was updated to properly handle unicode paths.
* gnome-terminal is no longer used by default when cola.terminal is unset. It is broken, as was detailed in #456.

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/456
* The interactive rebase feature was not always setting $GIT_EDITOR to the value of gui.editor, thus there could be instances where rebase will seem to not stop, or hang, when performing “reword” actions.

We now set the $GIT_EDITOR environment variable when performing the “Continue”, “Skip”, and “Edit Todo” rebase actions so that the correct editor is used during the rebase.

https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/445

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 10:11:19 UTC 2015 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to 2.1.2
- Usability, bells and whistles
* Updated zh_TW translations.
* git cola rebase now defaults to @{upstream}, and generally uses the same CLI syntax as git rebase.
* The commit message editor now allows you to bypass commit hooks by selecting the “Bypass Commit Hooks” option. This is equivalent to passing the –no-verify option to git commit.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/357
* We now prevent the “Delete Files” action from creating a dialog that does not fit on screen.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/378
* git xbase learned to edit rebase instruction sheets that contain exec commands.
* The diff colors are now configurable. cola.color.{text,add,remove,header} can now be set with 6-digit hexadecimal colors. See the git cola manual <https://git-cola.readthedocs.org/en/latest/git-cola.html#configuration-variables>_ for more details.
* Improved hotkey documentation.

  * A new git cola find sub-command was added for finding files.
  * git cola now remembers the text cursor’s position when staging interactively with the keyboard. This makes it easier to use the keyboard arrows to select and stage lines.
  * The completion widgets will now select the top completion item when Enter or Return are pressed.
  * You can now refresh using F5 in addition to the existing Ctrl+R hotkey.
  * git cola now passes –no-abbrev-commit to git log to override having log.abbrevCommit = true set in .gitconfig.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 17 06:23:47 UTC 2015 - mailaender@opensuse.org

* Ctrl+L now focuses the “Search” field in the git dag tool.
* Right-clicking in the “diff” viewer now updates the cursor position before performing actions, which makes it much easier to click around and selectively stage sections. Previously, the current cursor position was used which meant that it required two clicks (left-click to update the position followed by right-click to get the context menu) for the desired section to be used. This is now a single right-click operation.
* The Ctrl+D “Launch Diff Tool” action learned to automatically choose between git difftool and git mergetool. If the file is unmerged then we automatically launch git mergetool on the path, otherwise we use git difftool. We do this because git difftool is not intended to be used on unmerged paths. Automatically using git mergetool when appropriate is the most intuitive and muscle-memory-friendly thing to do.
* You can now right-click on folders in your standard file browser and choose “Open With -> Git Cola” (Linux-only).
- Fixes
* Python 2.6 on Mac OS X Snow Leopard does not provide a namedtuple at sys.version_info. We now avoid using that variable for better portability.
* We now read the user’s Git configuration from ~/.config/git/config if that file is available, otherwise we use the traditional ~/.gitconfig path, just like Git itself.
* Some edge cases were fixed when applying partial/selected diffs.
* The diff viewer is now properly cleared when refreshing. http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/194

http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/150
* git cola now remembers your commit message and will restore it when git cola is restarted.
https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/175

- Update to version 1.8.2
- Usability, bells and whistles
* We now automatically remove missing repositories from the “Select Repository” dialog.
http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/145
* A new git cola diff sub-command was added for diffing changed files.
- Fixes
* The inotify auto-refresh feature makes it difficult to select text in the “diff” editor when files are being continually modified by another process. The auto-refresh causes it to lose the currently selected text, which is not wanted. We now avoid this problem by saving and restoring the selection when refreshing the editor.
http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/155
* More strings have been marked for l10n.
http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/157
* Fixed the Alt+D Diffstat shortcut.
http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/159
- Fixes
* Better error handling when cloning repositories.
We were not handling the case where a git URL has no basename, e.g. https://git.example.com/. git cola originally rejected these URLs instead of allowing users to clone them. It now allows these URLs when they point to valid git repositories.
Additionally, git cola learned to echo the errors reported by git clone when it fails.

* git-dag got a big visual upgrade.
* Ctrl+G now launches the “Grep” tool.
* Ctrl+D launches difftool and Ctrl+E launches your editor when in the diff panel.
* git-cola can now be told to use an alternative language. For example, if the native language is German and we want git-cola to use English then we can create a ~/.config/git-cola/language file with “en” as its contents:
$ echo en >~/.config/git-cola/language
http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/140
* A new git cola merge sub-command was added for merging branches.

Thu Aug 23 13:58:47 UTC 2012 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.8.0
- Usability, bells and whistles
* git cola learned to honor .gitattributes when showing and interactively applying diffs. This makes it possible to store files in git using a non-utf-8 encoding and git cola will properly accept them. This must be enabled by settings cola.fileattributes to true, as it incurs a small performance penalt
http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/96
* git cola now wraps commit messages at 72 columns automatically. This is configurable using the cola.linebreak variable to enable/disable the feature, and cola.textwidth to configure the limit.
http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/133
* A new “Open Recent” sub-menu was added to the “File” menu. This makes it easy to open a recently-edited repository.
http://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/135
* We now show a preview for untracked files when they are clicked using the Status tool.
* A new “Open Using Default Application” action was added to the Status tool. It is activated using either Spacebar or through the context menu. This action uses xdg-open on Linux and open on Mac OS X.
* A new “Open Parent Directory” action was added to the Status tool. It is activated using either Shift+Spacebar or through the context menu.
* git dag learned to honor the log.date git configuration variable. This makes the date display follow whatever format the user has configured.
* A new git cola config sub-command was added for quickly tweaking git cola‘s git configuration settings.
* Some small usability tweaks – some user confirmation prompts were defaulting to “Cancel” when they should have been defaulting to the affirmative option instead.
- Fixes
* Properly handle arbitrarily-named branches.
* We went back to launching git mergetool using an xterm. The reason is that there are a couple of places where git mergetool requires a terminal for user interaction not covered by –no-prompt.
* We now properly handle an edge case when applying short diffs at the start of a file

* Remote operations now prompt on errors only.
* The Tab key now jumps to the extended description when editing the summary.
* More shortcut key labels and misc. UX improvements.
- Fixes
* Selecting an item no longer copies its filename to the copy/paste buffer. Ctrl-c or the “Copy” context-menu action can be used instead.
* The repository monitoring feature on Windows learned to ignore changes within the ”.git” directory. Thanks to Andreas Sommer.-
