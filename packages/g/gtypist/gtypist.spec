%description
GNU Typist (typist) is a universal typing tutor. You can learn
correct typing and improve your skills by practising its exercises on
a regular basis. Its main features are:

* It comes with several typing tutorials: in Czech, English (Qwerty,
  Dvorak and Colemak keyboards), Russian and Spanish, as well as
  simpler exercises in German, French and Norwegian.

* It interprets a simple and intuitive scripting language that
  describes typing tutorials. You can easily modify existing
  tutorials or create new ones according to your needs.

* Users can navigate through lessons through an easy to use arrow key
  based menu interface. 'vi' up, down, left and right keys can be
  used too.
