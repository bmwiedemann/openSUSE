- Update to version 3.5.0
  * (modern branch only) Fullscreen is now borderless window (which,
    technically, it always has been, anyhow). Removed hacks which
    changed the desktop resolution in order to simulate exclusive
    fullscreen because they were a constant stability concern.
  * (modern branch only) fixed a performance regression with the
    software renderer, introduced by the recent changes to the video
    backend in 3.4.
  * Save item statistics - Items are now saved into save games and
    are displayed on the statfile
  * Upgrade libADLMIDI and libOPNMIDI
  * Large number of MinGW fixes
  * add tags for all Doom and Heretic monsters for mods that reveal
    monster names

  * default to "fullscreen" display
  * fixed a potential exploit with malformed WAD files.

    for these flags don't get ignored.
  * fixed: flag CVars in ZScript referenced wrong addresses
  * fixed: ZScript used the wrong variable for compatflags2.
  * fixed: remove ARM specific gl_es definition since it's not even
    really much different from the main line definition, anyhow
  * fixed generation of brightmaps for sprites. This forgot to take
    the added empty border for filtering improvement into account.
  * fixed ADynamicLight's shadowmap index must be reset when loading
    a savegame.
  * fixed portal restoration on revisiting level in hub.
  * Added function to FLevelLocals to test if map is being reentered.

    framebuffer backend

    in the future, performance improvements on newer hardware
  * CVAR that handles it is now 'vid_rendermode' - vid_renderer,
    swtruecolor, and r_polyrender have been removed and combined into
    new CVAR
  * added a 'lightsizefactor' command to gldefs.
  * allow animated title pics.
  * Add support for Unreal Engine 1 vertex mesh format.
  * added LevelLocals vec2/3Offset(Z) functions for portal-aware
    offsetting without needing actors
  * Add "OnGiveSecret" virtual function on Actor for customizing behavior
    of secret finding.

    "block players" lines
  * added 'revealed on automap' linedef flag, UDMF only
  * added forced automap style to linedef, UDMF only
  * Added startup song definition for custom IWADs
  * This release contains a major render optimization for highly detailed
    maps that may give a +20% performance improvement on Intel and AMD
    hardware (less on NVidia because the driver has far less overhead that
    could be optimized away.)

- Update to version 3.3.2
  * Fixed detection of .ipk7 custom IWADs
  * Restored vanilla behavior of lightning for original Hexen
  * Added loading of ZSDF lumps by full paths

    deconflict from Actor.Teleport() function
