%description
This package exports a module which is the recommended starting point for using
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens> if you aren't trying
to keep your dependencies minimal. By importing 'Lens.Micro.Platform' you get
all functions and instances from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens
microlens>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>,
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl microlens-mtl>,
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>, as well as
instances for 'Vector', 'Text', and 'HashMap'.

The minor and major versions of microlens-platform are incremented whenever the
minor and major versions of any other microlens package are incremented, so you
can depend on the exact version of microlens-platform without specifying the
version of microlens (microlens-mtl, etc) you need.

This package is a part of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens
microlens> family; see the readme <https://github.com/monadfix/microlens#readme
on Github>.
