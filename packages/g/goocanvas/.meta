  <title>A cairo-based canvas widget for GTK+</title>
  <description>GooCanvas is similar in many ways to GnomeCanvas and FooCanvas. But it
uses cairo for rendering, has an optional model/view split, and uses
interfaces for items &amp; models (so you can easily turn any application
object into a canvas item or model).</description>
