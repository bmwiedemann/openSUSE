  <title>GStreamer based Command Line Music Player</title>
  <description>The gst123 program is designed to be a more flexible command line player akin
to ogg123 and mpg123, but based on gstreamer. It can play all the file formats
supported by gstreamer, like (but not limited to) flac, ogg and mp3.
