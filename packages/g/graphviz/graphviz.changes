  with swig-4.1.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 10 00:17:55 UTC 2022 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Remove pointless libgraphviz6 subpackage only containing broken
  and unnecessary ld.so.conf.d dropin.
- Add required Provides and Obsoletes for library package split.
- Remove unversioned symlinks for plugins, breaking shared library
  policy.
- Remove duplicate python3 bindings in wrong directory (again).
- Add missing post scriptlet for webp plugin.
- Fix postun scriptlets for all plugins (be silent when graphviz
  gets removed completely, report errors otherwise).
- Cleanup spec file.
- Disable Java bindings, as unused/untested, and packaging
  is quite broken.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 24 21:32:38 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.49.3:
  - gvpr "split", "tokens", and "index" functions produce incorrect results
    This was a regression that occurred between 2.47.1 and 2.47.2.
  - Lefty is disabled by default in the Autotools build system. To re-enable it,
    pass `--enable-lefty` to `./configure`. In a future release, Lefty will be
    removed.

    that it might have breaking changes also in upcoming patch or minor
    releases (towards #2001)

    raster image compression through the optional zlib library to be explicitly
    enabled (default) or disabled

  - libexpr rejects printing the time (`%t`) if no format is provided
  - `-DDATE=…` option in the CMake build system has been removed

  - fix typos and update URLs in `edgepaint` usage text and man page
  - Fix clang's undefined behavior warning in dotLayout

    directory #2101

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 29 10:21:10 UTC 2018 - jbrielmaier@suse.de

- Support dynamic move to Guile 2.2, part of boo#1117121:
  - Replace conditional pkgconfig(guile-2.[02]) BuildRequires with

- Build with gts support (bsc#1108978, bsc#1108976)
  SLE12 flavors do not provide gts, so explicitly exclude
  gts support there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 30 11:24:20 UTC 2018 - bwiedemann@suse.com

- Extend reproducible.patch to make build reproducible (boo#1041534)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 20:12:49 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Build with PHP5 for Leap 42.x and earlier, PHP7 requires swig 3.0.11
  Drop graphviz-plugins-fix_install_dirs.patch, use sed script to
  fix directories, same as for Lua

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 19:53:42 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Do not delete dotty/lefty/lneato man pages which are part of
  the x11 subpackage, built from the addons package/spec.
  (No changelog entry).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 10 17:36:20 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Drop harmful modification of tclpkg/gv/gv_doc_langs.tcl, which
  changes the timestamp, although the file does not contain LIB_DIR.
  Graphviz ships prebuilt manpages in man and PDF format. Modifying
  the tcl script rebuilt the documentation, and replaced the PDFs
  with empty documents (due to missing groff). This also made the
  doc subpackage nonreproducible, causing rebuilds in all dependent
  packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  8 18:22:25 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Disable guile 2.2 modifications temporarily

  to addons, unused for core

Tue Jan 16 13:50:45 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Disable building the graphviz-ocaml package: we have no consumer
  of it, but not building it allows us to elminiate a build cycle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 26 10:01:19 CEST 2017 - pth@suse.de

- Reverse last change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 25 10:58:28 CEST 2017 - pth@suse.de

  anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 23 15:57:03 CEST 2017 - pth@suse.de

- Replace the recommends for graphviz-gnome by a 'supplements packageand'
  so that graphviz doesn't pull in all the X11 related stuff on a
  machine without graphical desktop (bsc#930442).

Wed Oct  4 15:43:37 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

    default was 0 (graphviz tracker 2372).
  * Graphviz gave incorrect svg when labels contained HTML entities
    (graphviz tracker 2384).
  * Building gvedit failed with undefined references (graphviz
    tracker 2388).

    that edge[style=tapered] does not work with arrowType:none
    (graphviz tracker 2391).

    to line segments for edges (graphviz tracker 2393).
  * Fix xdot background polygon coordinates being "nan" with no nodes
    (graphviz tracker 2393).

      -- -Tpng now uses cairo   (-Tpng:gd for old gd based renderer)
      -- -Tpdf now available
      -- -Tps:cairo now available (-Tps is a direct ps renderer not based on
          cairo)
      -- -Tsvg:cairo now available (-Tsvg is a direct svg renderer not based
          on cairo)
      -- -Txlib now available -- "dot -Tx11 foo.dot"  watches foo.dot with
          inotify and updates
      -- -Tgtk now available -- eventually to provide a graph editing capability
          - not fully working
      -- -Tswf "Flash" now available using the ming library. Currently has
          incomplete font support and not yet in Fedora rpms because ming not
          yet available as rpm.
  - remove hard gd dependencies from dot.  gd renderers now provided
    as optional plugin.   Deprecated, but required for -Tjpg, -Tgif and -Tvrml.
  - gvpr - Add kindOf function, plus functions to set and get default values
  - dot - Implement esep attribute to allow graph to specify room
    around nodes for spline routing.
  - neato - add vpsc library and DIGCOLA
  - neato - add IPSEPCOLA additions from Tim Dwyer
  - move: -Tps, -Tfig, -Tsvg, -Timap/ismap/cmap/cmapx, -Tdot/xdot,
    from codegens to a "core" plugin.
  - dot - new usershape plugin mechanism potentially supporting
    a wider range of input shape format -> output format combinations.
    display on changes
  - dot - new -O switch to automatically generate output file
    names based on the input filename and the -T value.
    e.g.  "dot -Tpng -O *.dot"
    Also works for case of multiple graphs in a single input file.
  - add support for "Brewer" color nameset
  - move reusable .so libraries to $PREFIX/lib per frequent request
    from Debian community.   Plugin .so's remain in $PREFIX/lib/graphviz.
  - (POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY) The default input scaling, in the
    absence of a "-s" switch, has been changed from inches to points.
    The new behavior of "neato" is equivalent to "neato -s72".
    The old behavior can be restored with "neato -s1".
    The purpose of this change is to avoid a Frequently-Made-Mistake
    when using "neato -n" to process a previously generated layout.
    Previously it was necessary to use "neato -n -s72", but with this
    change the default matches dot's output and the "-s72" is not required.
  - Added pseudo layout engines: "dot -Knop" and dot -Knop1" equivalent
    to "neato -n"
  - Added pseodo layout engine: "dot -Knop2" equivalent to "neato -n2"
  - Add support for color namespaces; add Brewer color data
  - Add support for simulated duplex edges using parallel edges:
    head arrow takes first color, tail arrow takes second color.
  - Add a small pad region around graph renderings to allow for finite
    penwidths at the drawing edges
  - Add protonode(g) and E=protoedge(g) functions to simplify language
    bindings.
  - Add special purpose code to deal with html labels from language
    bindings.

- Split off language support into subpackages.
- build php,ruby,C#,python,guile and java support in addition to tcl
- swig >= 1.3.21 differentiates between php4 and php5, so adapt
  configure test.
- Don't move tcl libraries to _libdir but instead add the graphviz
  sublibrary paths via /etc/ld.so.conf.d
- Use SONAMEs to generate pkgIndex.tcl. That way tcl can actually
  load the libraries via 'package require'
- Don't compare pointer with string literal.
