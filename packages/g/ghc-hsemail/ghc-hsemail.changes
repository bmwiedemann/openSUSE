- Update hsemail to version 2.2.0.
  ## v2.2.0

  * Drop the `parsec2read` function. `Read` is not supposed to be defined
    manually, really. It's supposed to be a dual to the derived `Show` instance.
  * Drop the Rfc2821 module. This code is not generic enough to be useful,
    really. I use it in [Postmaster](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/postmaster),
    and there it will live henceforth.
  * `caseString` no longer returns a string; it just returns `()`.
  * Make use of `DayOfWeek` type from new `time` library.
  * Drop the obsolete dependency on `mtl`.

  * Re-write code to use the modern `time` library rather than `old-time`.
  * rfc2821: drop the entire smtp FSM stuff

  * Drop support for GHC versions prior to 7.10.x.
