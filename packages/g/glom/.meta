  <title>Database designer and user interface</title>
  <description>
With Glom you can design database systems - the database and the user
interface.

    * Glom has high-level features such as relationships, lookups,
      related fields, related records, calculated fields, drop-down
      choices, searching, reports, users and groups.
    * Glom keeps things simple. It has Numeric, Text, Date, Time,
      Boolean, and Image field types.
    * Glom systems require almost no programming, but you may use
      Python for calculated fields or buttons.
    * Each Glom system can be translated for multiple languages and
      countries.
