Thu Jul 26 21:58:07 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add libgda-5_0-postgres, typelib(Gda) and python-glom Requires:

      have an (undocumented) limit.
    - Warn if we cannot get the list of users (bgo#669178)
    - Add tests.
  + Button scripts: Check and warn about pygtk2 instead of crashing

  system.

- Change BuildRequires from old-style, gtk2 based, to pkgconfig(),
  gtk3 based ones:
  + Old ones: gtkmm2-devel, libgdamm-devel, libgoocanvasmm-devel,
    libgtksourceviewmm-2_0-devel.
  + New ones: gtkmm-3.0, goocanvasmm-2.0, libgda-postgres-5.0,
    libgdamm-5.0.
- Add new pkgconfig() BuildRequires, following upstream changes:
  evince-view-3.0, pygobject-3.0.

Mon Feb 14 01:17:01 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.16.2:
  + CSV Import: Actually preview and import the field values
    (bgo#625693).
  + List view: Make the retry option actually work afer entering
    invalid data (bgo#167818).
  + Build: Remove the gconfmm dependency, because we don't use it.
- Changes from version 1.16.1:
  + Build: Fix the python module's filename.
- Changes from version 1.16.0:
  + Build:
    - Do not use deprecated gtkmm API (requires gtkmm 2.22).
    - Various small improvements
- Changes from version 1.15.2:
  + Field Formatting: Related Choices: Add a Show All checkbox, so
    that the list of choices can be restricted according to the
    relationship, instead of just showing all values in the related
    table. This allows the Choices to be used to narrow down a
    choice based on a choice in another field. (bgo#625536).
  + Allow unique fields with same name in multiple tables
    (bgo#625192).
  + Developer menu: Added Export Backup and Restore Backup menu
    items. These use PostgreSQL's pg_dump and pg_restore utilities,
    wrapping the dump and .glom file up in a .tar.gz.
  + Build:
    - Explicitly link with libdl for Python module loading test.
    - Rename the library to libglom-1-16 to be parallel-installable
      with libglom-1-14.
    - Adapt to the latest libgdamm API.
- Changes from version 1.15.1:
  + Uses Gnome::Gda::SqlBuilder in most places to avoid manually
    building SQL query strings. This should be more robust and
    safer.
  + Correct the position of "Records / Found" labels.
  + Find:
    - Make Find mode a toggle and move it to the Edit menu.
    - Fix a crash when using find mode.
  + List view:
    - Don't add a new row when cancelling editing of a placeholder
      row.
    - Don't allow placeholder rows to be delteted.
  + Build libglom and pyglom API documentation.
- Changes from version 1.14.5:
  + Allow unique fields with same name in multiple tables
    (bgo#625192).
- Changes from version 1.14.4:
  + Developer menu: Added Export Backup and Restore Backup menu
    items. These use PostgreSQL's pg_dump and pg_restore utilities,
    wrapping the dump and .glom file up in a .tar.gz.
  + Build: Explicitly link with libdl for Python module loading
    test.
- Changes from version 1.14.3:
  + Fix position of "Records / Found" labels.
  + List: Don't allow deleting placeholder rows.
  + Build: Don't require avahi-ui.
- Remove gconfmm-devel BuildRequires.
- Add postgrsql Requires, for pg_dump and pg_restore.
- Rename libglom-1_14_0 to libglom-1_16_0, following library name
  change.
- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:
  + %desktop_database_post/postun because the package ships at
    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.
  + %mime_database_post/postun because the package ships a mime
    type definition.
- Pass %{?no_lang_C} to %find_lang so that english documentation
  can be packaged with the program, and not in the lang subpackage.
- Change Requires of lang subpackage to Recommends, since the
  english documentation is not there anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      where 10 is the value of the primary key in the table.
    - Added ui.print_layout(), ui.print_report(report_name),
      and ui.start_new_record() methods.
    - Added a startup script feature, in Database Preferences.

    ui.print_report(report_name), and ui.start_new_record()
    methods.
  + Fix the build with exceptions disabled.
- Changes from version 1.13.7:
  + Avoid a crash when a script navigates from a list view to
    another table. Maybe avoid similar warnings/crashes when doing
    normal navigation.
- Changes from version 1.13.6:
  + Python scripts:
    - Fields value may now be changed like so:
      record["fieldname"] = 123
    - Simple navigation is posible via, for instance:
