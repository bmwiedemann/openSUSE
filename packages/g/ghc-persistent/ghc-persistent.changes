Fri Jun 10 15:19:57 UTC 2022 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

  * [#1407](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1407)
      * Fix a name shadowing warning.

  ## 2.14.0.1

      * Enhance `selectList` documentation with TypeApplications examples.
      * Clarify `selectSource` documentation wording.

      * Increasing quasi module test coverage, improve error assertions
  * [#1401](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1401)
      * Change `Entity` back into a regular record and drop the `HasField`
        instance. This is technically a breaking change, but [the bug in GHC's
        `COMPLETE` annotations](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15681)
        rendered a super common pattern a much more invasive breaking change than
        anticipated. As a result, upgrading to `persistent-2.14` was untenable.

        If you *did* upgrade and this broke your codebase *again*, please let me
        know and I can release another patch to shim it.

  ## 2.14.0.0

  * [#1343](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1343)
      * Implement Type Literal based field definitions
  * [#1387](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1387)
      * Better UX with `insert`. We now report a type error when you try to
        `insert` an `Entity` or a function, and we also forbid `insert`ing if the
        database would throw an error missing a primary key.
  * [#1383](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1383)
      * Primary keys have a `NonEmpty` of fields, not a `[]` of fields.
      * A `Primary` key on an entity now creates a `Unique` constructror for that
        record, with the name `#{entityName}PrimaryKey`. This also affects the
        generation of `AtLeastOneUniqueKey` and `OnlyOneUniqueKey` instances, so
        you may need to change behavior on these classes.
  * [#1381](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1381)
      * `Entity` is given a `HasField` instance that uses the database field
        names. This is primarily done to support `OverloadedRecordDot` in GHC 9.2
        and above.
      * A consequence of this is that the `Entity` constructor has been renamed to
        `Entity'`. A pattern synonym is provided that should work in almost all
        cases. You may incur a `MonadFail m` constraint if you are pattern
        matching directly on the constructor in a `do` result.
  * [#1364](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1346)
      * The type `SomePersistField` was removed in favor of using `PersistValue`
        directly.
  * [#1386](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1386)
      * The module `Database.Persist.Class.DeleteCascade` was deleted since you
        can put cascade behavior directly on your database models.
      * Removed `mkSave` from `Database.Persist.TH`. Use `mkEntityDefList`
        instead.
      * Remove the `CompositeDef` constructor from `ReferenceDef` which was not
        used internally anymore.
  * [#1385](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1385)
      * The support for entity-level sum types is deprecated. It adds a
        considerable amount of complexity to the code, and the pattern is not
        particularly good for actually supporting sum types in most databases.
  * [#1384](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1384)
      * Add `tabulateEntityA` to the `PersistEntity` class, allowing you to
        construct an `Entity a` by providing a function `EntityField a t -> f t`.
        Note that this doesn't make sense for sum entities, and the implementation
        `error`s.
      * Add `tabulateEntity` as a pure version of that.

  ## 2.13.3.5

  * [#1374](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1374)
      * Increasing test coverage for errors thrown when parsing entity definitions

  ## 2.13.3.4
  * [#1379](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1379)
      * `mkPersist` now generates code that compiles under `NoFieldSelectors` and `DuplicateRecordFields` even if field labels are not prefixed
  * [#1376](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1376)
      * Add coverage for parsing nested parens/lists in field types

- Update persistent to version 2.13.0.0.
  ## 2.13.0.0

  * [#1244](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1244)
      * Implement config for customising the FK name
  * [#1252](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1252)
      * `mkMigrate` now defers to `mkEntityDefList` and `migrateModels` instead of
        fixing the foreign key references itself.
      * `mkSave` was deprecated - the function did not fix foreign key references.
        Please use `mkEntityDefList` instead.
      * `EntityDef` will now include fields marked `MigrationOnly` and
        `SafeToRemove`. Beforehand, those were filtered out, and `mkMigrate`
        applied. The function `getEntityFields` wll only return fields defined on
        the Haskell type - for all columns, see `getEntityFieldsDatabase`.
  * [#1225](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1225)
      * The fields and constructor for `SqlBackend` are no longer exported by
        default. They are available from an internal module,
        `Database.Persist.Sql.Types.Internal`. Breaking changes from `Internal`
        modules are not reflected in the major version. This will allow us to
        release new functionality without breaking your code. It's recommended to
        switch to using the smart constructor functions and setter functions that
        are now exported from `Database.Persist.Sql` instead.
      * A new API is available for constructing and using a `SqlBackend`, provided
        in `Database.Persist.SqlBackend`. Instead of using the `SqlBackend`
        directly, use `mkSqlBackend` and the datatype `MkSqlBackendArgs`. The
        `MkSqlBackendArgs` record has the same field names as the `SqlBackend`, so
        the translation is easy:
        ```diff
  - SqlBackend
  + mkSqlBackend MkSqlBackendArgs
      { connInsertSql = ...
      , connCommit = ...
      , connEscapeFieldName = ...
      , connEscapeTableName = ...
      , etc
      }
        ```
        Some fields were omitted in `MkSqlBackendArgs`. These fields are
        *optional* - they provide enhanced or backend-specific functionality. For
        these, use the setter functions like `setConnUpsertSql`.
      * Previously hidden modules are now exposed under the `Internal` namespace.
      * The `connLimitOffset` function used to have a `Bool` parameter. This
        parameter is unused and has been removed.
  * [#1234](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1234)
      * You can now customize the default implied ID column. See the documentation
        in `Database.Persist.ImplicitIdDef` for more details.
      * Moved the various `Name` types into `Database.Persist.Names`
      * Removed the `hasCompositeKey` function. See `hasCompositePrimaryKey` and
        `hasNaturalKey` as replacements.
      * The `EntityDef` constructor and field labels are not exported by default.
        Get those from `Database.Persist.EntityDef.Internal`, but you should
        migrate to the getters/setters in `Database.Persist.EntityDef` as you can.
      * Added the `Database.Persist.FieldDef` and
        `Database.Persist.FieldDef.Internal` modules.
      * The `PersistSettings` type was made abstract. Please migrate to the
        getters/setters defined in that `Database.Persist.Quasi`, or use
        `Database.Persist.Quasi.Internal` if you don't mind the possibility of
        breaking changes.
      * Add the `runSqlCommand` function for running arbitrary SQL during
        migrations.
      * Add `migrateModels` function for a TH-free migration facility.
  * [#1253](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1253)
      * Add `discoverEntities` to discover instances of the class and return their
        entity definitions.
  * [#1250](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1250)
      * The `mpsGeneric` function has been deprecated. If you need this
        functionality, please comment with your needs on the GitHub issue tracker.
        We may un-deprecate it, or we may provide a new and better means of
        facilitating a solution to your problem.
  * [#1255](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1255)
      * `mkPersist` now checks to see if an instance already exists for
        `PersistEntity` for the inputs.

  ## 2.12.1.2

  * [#1258](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1258)
      * Support promoted types in Quasi Quoter
  * [#1243](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1243)
      * Assorted cleanup of TH module
  * [#1242](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1242)

  * [#1237](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1237)
      * Remove nonEmptyOrFail function from recent tests
  * [#1256](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1256)
      * The QuasiQuoter has been refactored and improved.
      * You can now use `mkPersistWith` to pass in a list of pre-existing
        `EntityDef` to improve foreign key detection and splitting up models
        across multiple modules.
      * The `entityId` field now returns an `EntityIdDef`, which specifies what
        the ID field actually is. This is a move to better support natural keys.
      * Several types that had lists have been refactored to use nonempty lists to
        better capture the semantics.
      * `mkDeleteCascade` is deprecated. Please use the Cascade behavior directly
        on fields.
      * You can use `Key Foo` and `FooId` interchangeably in fields.
      * Support for GHC < 8.4 dropped.
