  <title>Gnucap is the Gnu Circuit Analysis Package</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'gnucap' from project 'science'.

The primary component is a general purpose circuit simulator. It
performs nonlinear dc and transient analyses, fourier analysis, and ac
analysis. Spice compatible models for the MOSFET (level 1-7), BJT, and
diode are included in this release.

Gnucap is not based on Spice, but some of the models have been derived
from the Berkeley models.

Unlike Spice, the engine is designed to do true mixed-mode
simulation. Most of the code is in place for future support of event
driven analog simulation, and true multi-rate simulation.
