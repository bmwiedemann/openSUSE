The tarball is generated via the OBS source service, but Grafana
needs to ship the compiled frontend assets as well, which have to
be built by running yarn and grunt inside the source tree (see
https://github.com/grafana/grafana#building-frontend-assets).
This can't be done at build time on OBS, because it involves
downloading and installing packages from the internet, so instead
we have a Makefile which does the following:

- Runs `osc service disabledrun` to get the latest source tarball
- Unpacks the tarball to a temporary directory
- Runs `yarn install --pure-lockfile && grunt release`
- Adds the generated "vendor" and "public" content to the tarball,
  then compresses it with xz.
- The tarball can then be used by OBS to build an RPM.

In order for this to work you need to have npm >= 6, < 12, yarn and
grunt installed.  To get set up, run:

  # zypper in npm12
  # zypper in obs-service-download_files obs-service-go_modules \
        obs-service-obs_scm
  # npm install -g yarn
  # npm install -g grunt-cli

Then, to package a new release of Grafana, run `make` then `osc ci`
and you should be good.

If you have a patch for the Javascript frontend to apply you need
to do the following:

- Create the patch and add it with `osc add <PATCH>` to the repo
- Open the Makefile
- Add after the `cd $$basename && \` the patch with:
  `patch -p1 < ../../000x-<NAME>.patch && \`
- Do NOT add the patch to the Specfile.
- Then use the process of building Grafana as described above.
