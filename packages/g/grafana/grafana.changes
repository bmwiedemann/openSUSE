Sun May 24 21:43:04 UTC 2020 - Joao Cavalheiro <jcavalheiro@suse.com>

- Update to version 7.0.0 
  * Breaking changes
    - Removed PhantomJS: PhantomJS was deprecated in Grafana v6.4 and starting from Grafana v7.0.0, all PhantomJS support has been removed. This means that Grafana no longer ships with a built-in image renderer, and we advise you to install the Grafana Image Renderer plugin.
    - Dashboard: A global minimum dashboard refresh interval is now enforced and defaults to 5 seconds.
    - Interval calculation: There is now a new option Max data points that controls the auto interval $__interval calculation. Interval was previously calculated by dividing the panel width by the time range. With the new max data points option it is now easy to set $__interval to a dynamic value that is time range agnostic. For example if you set Max data points to 10 Grafana will dynamically set $__interval by dividing the current time range by 10.
    - Datasource/Loki: Support for deprecated Loki endpoints has been removed.
    - Backend plugins: Grafana now requires backend plugins to be signed, otherwise Grafana will not load/start them. This is an additional security measure to make sure backend plugin binaries and files haven't been tampered with. Refer to Upgrade Grafana for more information.
    - @grafana/ui: Forms migration notice, see @grafana/ui changelog
    - @grafana/ui: Select API change for creating custom values, see @grafana/ui changelog
    + Deprecation warnings
      - Scripted dashboards is now deprecated. The feature is not removed but will be in a future release. We hope to address the underlying requirement of dynamic dashboards in a different way. #24059
      - The unofficial first version of backend plugins together with usage of grafana/grafana-plugin-model is now deprecated and support for that will be removed in a future release. Please refer to backend plugins documentation for information about the new officially supported backend plugins.
  * Features / Enhancements

  Breaking changes
  -  Slack: Removed Mention setting and instead introduce Mention Users, Mention Groups, and Mention Channel. The first two settings require user and group IDs, respectively. This change was necessary because the way of mentioning via the Slack API changed and mentions in Slack notifications no longer worked.
  -  Alerting: Reverts the behavior of diff and percent_diff to not always be absolute. Something we introduced by mistake in 6.1.0. Alerting now support diff(), diff_abs(), percent_diff() and percent_diff_abs(). #21338

  - Notice about changes in backendSrv for plugin authors
    In our mission to migrate away from AngularJS to React we have removed all AngularJS dependencies in the core data retrieval service backendSrv.
    Removing the AngularJS dependencies in backendSrv has the unfortunate side effect of AngularJS digest no longer being triggered for any request made with backendSrv. Because of this, external plugins using backendSrv directly may suffer from strange behaviour in the UI.
    To remedy this issue, as a plugin author you need to trigger the digest after a direct call to backendSrv.

    Alerting: Don't include image_url field with Slack message if empty. #22372, @aknuds1

  * Breaking changes
    + Annotations
      There are some breaking changes in the annotations HTTP API for region annotations. Region annotations are now represented
      using a single event instead of two seperate events. Check breaking changes in HTTP API below and HTTP API documentation for more details.
    + Docker
      Grafana is now using Alpine 3.10 as docker base image.
    + HTTP API
      - GET /api/alert-notifications now requires at least editor access.
        New /api/alert-notifications/lookup returns less information than /api/alert-notifications and can be access by any authenticated user.
      - GET /api/alert-notifiers now requires at least editor access
      - GET /api/org/users now requires org admin role.
        New /api/org/users/lookup returns less information than /api/org/users and can be access by users that are org admins,
        admin in any folder or admin of any team.
      - GET /api/annotations no longer returns regionId property.
      - POST /api/annotations no longer supports isRegion property.
      - PUT /api/annotations/:id no longer supports isRegion property.
      - PATCH /api/annotations/:id no longer supports isRegion property.
      - DELETE /api/annotations/region/:id has been removed.
  * Deprecation notes
    + PhantomJS
      - PhantomJS, which is used for rendering images of dashboards and panels,
        is deprecated and will be removed in a future Grafana release.
        A deprecation warning will from now on be logged when Grafana starts up if PhantomJS is in use.
        Please consider migrating from PhantomJS to the Grafana Image Renderer plugin.
