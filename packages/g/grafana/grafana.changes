  * Breaking changes
    - This change impacts all instances that use external
      authentication providers to manage users and organization
      role assignments.
      From Grafana 10.1, it will no longer be possible to manually
      update organization roles (Viewer, Editor and Admin) that are
      managed by an external auth provider. We are making this
      change to clearly separate between roles managed by an
      external auth provider and manually assigned roles, which
      increases security and clarity around role management.
      If you prefer to manually set user organization roles, use
      skip_org_role_sync option in the Grafana configuration file
      of your OAuth provider.
      Refer to the release notes of Grafana 9.5 for context on the
      previous work done to build up to this change.
     - This change impacts GitHub OAuth, Gitlab OAuth, Okta OAuth
       and Generic OAuth
       Currently if no organization role mapping is found for a
       user when connecting via OAuth, Grafana doesn’t update the
       user’s organization role.
       With Grafana 10.1, on every login, if the
       role_attribute_path property does not return a role, then
       the user is assigned the role specified by the
       auto_assign_org_role option.
       To avoid overriding manually set roles, enable the
       skip_org_role_sync option in the Grafana configuration for
       your OAuth provider.
     - InfluxDB backend parser returns incompatible data with
       frontend. The data was being parsed by frontend and we
       moving towards migrating InfluxDB fully backend. One caveat
       is Frontend is generating data frames with fields Time and
       Value. The backend parser, however, generates time and
       value. This is causing issues and inconsistencies for the
       features (i.e. transformations) relying on those. In order
       to have a unique approach we choose to support what most of
       the users already have. Existing Transformations that depend
       on time fields have to be updated to use Time fields.
     - For accessibility reasons tooltip or aria-label are now
       required properties for IconButton. In order to continue to
       use IconButton, you must ensure all IconButton components
       have a corresponding tooltip or aria-label text. The tooltip
       text will also be used as the aria-label if you didn't set
       one separately. In case you add an aria-label the IconButton
       will not show a tooltip.
     - The implementation for template macro ${__series.name} was
       not always correct, resulting in an interpolation that was
       very different from the series name displayed in the
       visualization. We have now fixed this issue so that it does
       show the same name. Depending on how ${__series.name} is
       used this could result in a minor breaking change.
     - The data source template variable type has changed the way
       it represents its options. The text field still represents
       the data source name, but the value has been changed to the
       uid of the data source. This allows dashboards to declare
       the currently selected option by uid, however it changes how
       a datasource template variable value will be rendered by
       default. If the name of the data source is expected, the
       variable syntax will have to be changed to specify the text
       format.
     - We are changing the logic that creates uid in LogRowModel.
       Previously, for uid we used id field from log's data frame.
       Unfortunately, when users run multiple queries that returned
       duplicate logs data, uid was not unique which was causing
       bugs. To make uid unique across multiple queries that return
       duplicate logs data, we are now prepending uid with refId of
       query that produced the log line. We recommend not to rely
       on LogRowModel uid and instead use dataFrame id field.
     - The deprecated support for monitoring Grafana frontend using
       Sentry javascript agent has been removed in this release. If
       you have frontend logging enabled and are sending telemetry
       to Sentry by setting sentry_dsn configuration property, this
       will no longer work. Otherwise, if frontend logging is
       enabled, it will now automatically use Grafana Faro agent.
  * Deprecations
    - The query parameter of Explore's SplitOpen function is
      deprecated (passed in mapInternalLinkToExplore). Please use
      the queries parameter instead, which allows passing multiple
      queries to SplitOpen function. To pass a single query to
      SplitOpen function, set the queries parameter to an array
      containing that single query.
    - Starting with 10.0, changing the folder UID is deprecated. It
      will be removed in a future release. Please avoid using it
      because it can result in folder losing its permissions.
  * Plugin development fixes & changes
    - GrafanaUI: Define tooltip or aria-label as required for
      IconButton.
    - Select: Performance improvements when opening menu and when
      hovering over options.
    - ConfirmModal: Ignore case for confirmation text.

    - default named retention policies won't be used to query.
      Users who have a default named retention policy in their

      Having default named retention policy is not breaking
      anything. We will make sure to use the actual default

Thu Apr  6 15:03:14 UTC 2023 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Update to 9.4.7 (2023-03-16)
  * Bug fixes
    - Alerting: Update scheduler to receive rule updates only
      from database.
    - Influxdb: Re-introduce backend migration feature toggle.
    - Security: Fixes for CVE-2023-1410 (bsc#1209645).
  * Breaking changes
    The InfluxDB backend migration feature toggle
    (influxdbBackendMigration) has been reintroduced in this
    version as issues were discovered with backend processing of
    InfluxDB data. Unless this feature toggle is enabled, all
    InfluxDB data will be parsed in the frontend. This frontend
    processing is the default behavior.
    In Grafana 9.4.4, InfluxDB data parsing started to be handled
    in the backend. If you have upgraded to 9.4.4 and then added
    new transformations on InfluxDB data, those panels will fail to
    render. To resolve this either:
    - Remove the affected panel and re-create it
    - Edit the `time` field as `Time` in `panel.json` or
      `dashboard.json`

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Install actual binaries under /usr/libexec/grafana (or /usr/lib
  under older distributions) and create a simlink for wrapper
  scripts and the service (which expect the binary to be under
  /usr/share/grafana/bin)

      automatically converted. If you have existing links pointing
      to Explore update them using the format generated by Explore
      upon navigation. You can identify a compact URL by its
      format. Compact URLs have the left (and optionally right) url
      parameter as an array of strings, for example
      `&left=["now-1h","now"...]`. The standard explore URLs follow
      a key/value pattern, for example
      `&left={"datasource":"test"...}`. Please be sure to check
      your dashboards for any hardcoded links to Explore and update
      them to the standard URL pattern.

      removed in a future release. If you need to set a different
      query editor for Explore, conditionally render based on
      `props.app` in your regular query editor.
  * Plugin development fixes & changes
    - **Chore:** Remove react-testing-lib from bundles.
    - **Select:** Portal menu by default.
  * Breaking changes
    - The `@grafana/ui` package helper function
      `selectOptionInTest` used in frontend tests has been removed
      as it caused testing libraries to be bundled in the
      production code of Grafana. If you were using this helper
      function in your tests please update your code accordingly:
      ```js
      // before
      import { selectOptionInTest } from '@grafana/ui';
      // ...test usage
      await selectOptionInTest(selectEl, 'Option 2');

      // after
      import { select } from 'react-select-event';
      // ...test usage
      await select(selectEl, 'Option 2',
        { container: document.body });
      ```
    - Removed deprecated `checkHealth` prop from the `@grafana/e2e`
      `addDataSource` config. Previously this value defaulted to
      `false`, and has not been used in end-to-end tests since
      Grafana 8.0.3.
    - Removes the deprecated `LegacyBaseMap`, `LegacyValueMapping`,
      `LegacyValueMap`, and `LegacyRangeMap` types, and
      `getMappedValue` function from grafana-data. Migration is as
      follows:
      | Old                  | New                     |
      | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
      | `LegacyBaseMap`      | `MappingType`           |
      | `LegacyValueMapping` | `ValueMapping`          |
      | `LegacyValueMap`     | `ValueMap`              |
      | `LegacyRangeMap`     | `RangeMap`              |
      | `getMappedValue`     | `getValueMappingResult` |
      This change fixes a bug in Grafana where intermittent failure
      of database, network between Grafana and the database, or
      error in querying the database would cause all alert rules to
      be unscheduled in Grafana. Following this change scheduled
      alert rules are not updated unless the query is successful.
    - The `get_alert_rules_duration_seconds` metric has been
      renamed to `schedule_query_alert_rules_duration_seconds`.
    - Any secret (data sources credential, alert manager
      credential, etc, etc) created or modified with Grafana v9.0
      won't be decryptable from any previous version (by default)
      because the way encrypted secrets are stored into the
      database has changed. Although secrets created or modified
      with previous versions will still be decryptable by Grafana
      v9.0.
    - If required, although generally discouraged, the
      `disableEnvelopeEncryption` feature toggle can be enabled to
      keep envelope encryption disabled once updating to Grafana
      v9.0.
    - In case of need to rollback to an earlier version of Grafana
      (i.e. Grafana v8.x) for any reason, after being created or
      modified any secret with Grafana v9.0, the
      `envelopeEncryption` feature toggle will need to be enabled
      to keep backwards compatibility (only from `v8.3.x` a bit
      unstable, from `8.5.x` stable).
    - As a final attempt to deal with issues related with the
      aforementioned situations, the `grafana-cli admin
      secrets-migration rollback` command has been designed to
      move back all the Grafana secrets encrypted with envelope
      encryption to legacy encryption. So, after running that
      command it should be safe to disable envelope encryption
      and/or roll back to a previous version of Grafana.
    - Alternatively or complementarily to all the points above,
      backing up the Grafana database before updating could be a
      good idea to prevent disasters (although the risk of getting
      some secrets corrupted only applies to those updates/created
      with after updating to Grafana v9.0).
    - According to the dynamic labels documentation, you can use up
      to five dynamic values per label. There’s currently no such
      restriction in the alias pattern system, so if more than 5
      patterns are being used the GetMetricData API will return an
      error.
    - Dynamic labels only allow \${LABEL} to be used once per
      query. There’s no such restriction in the alias pattern
      system, so in case more than 1 is being used the
      GetMetricData API will return an error.
    - When no alias is provided by the user, Grafana will no longer
      fallback with custom rules for naming the legend.
    - In case a search expression is being used and no data is
      returned, Grafana will no longer expand dimension values, for
      instance when using a multi-valued template variable or star
      wildcard `*` in the dimension value field.
    - Time series might be displayed in a different order. Using
      for example the dynamic label `${PROP('MetricName')}`, might
      have the consequence that the time series are returned in a
      different order compared to when the alias pattern
      `{{metric}}` is used
    - In Elasticsearch, browser access mode was deprecated in
      grafana 7.4.0 and removed in 9.0.0. If you used this mode,
      please switch to server access mode on the datasource
      configuration page.
    - Environment variables passed from Grafana to external Azure
      plugins have been renamed:
      - `AZURE_CLOUD` renamed to `GFAZPL_AZURE_CLOUD`
      - `AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ENABLED` renamed to
        `GFAZPL_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ENABLED`
      - `AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID` renamed to
        `GFAZPL_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`
    - There are no known plugins which were relying on these
      variables. Moving forward plugins should read Azure settings
      only via Grafana Azure SDK which properly handles old and new
      environment variables.
    - Removes support for for ElasticSearch versions after their
      end-of-life, currently versions < 7.10.0. To continue to use
      ElasticSearch data source, upgrade ElasticSearch to version
      7.10.0+.
    - Application Insights and Insight Analytics queries in Azure
      Monitor were deprecated in Grafana 8.0 and finally removed in
      9.0. Deprecated queries will no longer be executed.
    - **grafana/ui: Button now specifies a default type="button"**
      The `Button` component provided by @grafana/ui now specifies
      a default `type="button"` when no type is provided.
      In previous versions, if the attribute was not specified for
      buttons associated with a `<form>` the default value was
      `submit` per the specification. You can preserve the old
      behavior by explicitly setting the type attribute:
      `<Button type="submit" />`
    - The `Rename by regex` transformation has been improved to
      allow global patterns of the form `/<stringToReplace>/g`.
      Depending on the regex match used, this may cause some
      transformations to behave slightly differently. You can
      guarantee the same behaviour as before by wrapping the
      `match` string in forward slashes (`/`), e.g. `(.*)` would
      become `/(.*)/`
    - `<Select />` menus will now portal to the document body by
      default. This is to give more consistent behaviour when
      positioning and overlaying. If you were setting
      `menuShouldPortal={true}` before you can safely remove that
      prop and behaviour will be the same. If you weren't
      explicitly setting that prop, there should be no visible
      changes in behaviour but your tests may need updating. If you
      were setting `menuShouldPortal={false}` this will continue to
      prevent the menu from portalling.
    - Grafana alerting endpoint prefixed with `api/v1/rule/test`
      that tests a rule against a Corte/Loki data source now
      expects the data source UID as a path parameter instead of
      the data source numeric identifier.
    - Grafana alerting endpoints prefixed with `api/prometheus/`
      that proxy requests to a Cortex/Loki data source now expect
      the data source UID as a path parameter instead of the data
      source numeric identifier.
    - Grafana alerting endpoints prefixed with `api/ruler/` that
      proxy requests to a Cortex/Loki data source now expect the
      data source UID as a path parameter instead of the data
      source numeric identifier.
    - Grafana alerting endpoints prefixed with `api/alertmanager/`
      that proxy requests to an Alertmanager now expect the data
      source UID as a path parameter instead of the data source
      numeric identifier.
    - The format of log messages have been updated, `lvl` is now
      `level` and `eror`and `dbug` has been replaced with `error`
      and `debug`. The precision of timestamps has been increased.
      To smooth the transition, it is possible to opt-out of the
      new log format by enabling the feature toggle `oldlog`.
      This option will be removed in a future minor release.
    - In the Loki data source, the dataframe format used to
      represent Loki logs-data has been changed to a more efficient
      format. The query-result is represented by a single dataframe
      with a "labels" column, instead of the separate dataframes
      for every labels-value. When displaying such data in explore,
      or in a logs-panel in the dashboard will continue to work
      without changes, but if the data was loaded into a different
      dashboard-panel, or Transforms were used, adjustments may be
      necessary. For example, if you used the "labels to fields"
      transformation with the logs data, please switch to the
      "extract fields" transformation.

  + Breaking changes (8.5.4):
    For a data source query made via /api/ds/query:
    If the DatasourceQueryMultiStatus feature is enabled and
        The data source response has an error set as part of the
        DataResponse, the resulting HTTP status code is now 207
        Multi Status instead of 400 Bad gateway
    If the DatasourceQueryMultiStatus feature is not enabled and
        The data source response has an error set as part of the
        DataResponse, the resulting HTTP status code is 400 Bad

    * Visualizations: Stack negative-valued series downwards.
      #47373, @leeoniya
  + Breaking changes (8.5.0):
    For a proxied request, e.g. Grafana's datasource or plugin
    proxy: If the request is cancelled, e.g. from the browser/by
    the client, the HTTP status code is now 499 Client closed
    request instead of 502 Bad gateway If the request times out,
    e.g. takes longer time than allowed, the HTTP status code is
    now 504 Gateway timeout instead of 502 Bad gateway. Issue
    #47473 The change in behavior is that negative-valued series
    are now stacked downwards from 0 (in their own stacks), rather
    than downwards from the top of the positive stacks. We now
    automatically group stacks by Draw style, Line interpolation,
    and Bar alignment, making it impossible to stack bars on top of
    lines, or smooth lines on top of stepped lines. Issue #47373
    The meaning of the default data source has now changed from
    being a persisted property in a panel. Before when you selected
    the default data source for a panel and later changed the
    default data source to another data source it would change all
    panels who were configured to use the default data source. From
    now on the default data source is just the default for new
    panels and changing the default will not impact any currently
    saved dashboards. Issue #45132 The Tooltip component provided
    by @grafana/ui is no longer automatically interactive (that is
    you can hover onto it and click a link or select text). It will
    from now on by default close automatically when you mouse out
    from the trigger element. To make tooltips behave like before
    set the new interactive property to true.

Sun May 24 21:43:04 UTC 2020 - Joao Cavalheiro <jcavalheiro@suse.com>

- Update to version 7.0.0
  * Breaking changes
    - Removed PhantomJS: PhantomJS was deprecated in Grafana v6.4 and starting from Grafana v7.0.0, all PhantomJS support has been removed. This means that Grafana no longer ships with a built-in image renderer, and we advise you to install the Grafana Image Renderer plugin.
    - Dashboard: A global minimum dashboard refresh interval is now enforced and defaults to 5 seconds.
    - Interval calculation: There is now a new option Max data points that controls the auto interval $__interval calculation. Interval was previously calculated by dividing the panel width by the time range. With the new max data points option it is now easy to set $__interval to a dynamic value that is time range agnostic. For example if you set Max data points to 10 Grafana will dynamically set $__interval by dividing the current time range by 10.
    - Datasource/Loki: Support for deprecated Loki endpoints has been removed.
    - Backend plugins: Grafana now requires backend plugins to be signed, otherwise Grafana will not load/start them. This is an additional security measure to make sure backend plugin binaries and files haven't been tampered with. Refer to Upgrade Grafana for more information.
    - @grafana/ui: Forms migration notice, see @grafana/ui changelog
    - @grafana/ui: Select API change for creating custom values, see @grafana/ui changelog
    + Deprecation warnings
      - Scripted dashboards is now deprecated. The feature is not removed but will be in a future release. We hope to address the underlying requirement of dynamic dashboards in a different way. #24059
      - The unofficial first version of backend plugins together with usage of grafana/grafana-plugin-model is now deprecated and support for that will be removed in a future release. Please refer to backend plugins documentation for information about the new officially supported backend plugins.
  * Features / Enhancements
    - Backend plugins: Log deprecation warning when using the unofficial first version of backend plugins. #24675, @marefr
    - Editor: New line on Enter, run query on Shift+Enter. #24654, @davkal
    - Loki: Allow multiple derived fields with the same name. #24437, @aocenas
    - Orgs: Add future deprecation notice. #24502, @torkelo

- update to 6.7.0-beta1:
  Breaking changes
  -  Slack: Removed Mention setting and instead introduce Mention Users, Mention Groups, and Mention Channel. The first two settings require user and group IDs, respectively. This change was necessary because the way of mentioning via the Slack API changed and mentions in Slack notifications no longer worked.
  -  Alerting: Reverts the behavior of diff and percent_diff to not always be absolute. Something we introduced by mistake in 6.1.0. Alerting now support diff(), diff_abs(), percent_diff() and percent_diff_abs(). #21338

  - Notice about changes in backendSrv for plugin authors
    In our mission to migrate away from AngularJS to React we have removed all AngularJS dependencies in the core data retrieval service backendSrv.
    Removing the AngularJS dependencies in backendSrv has the unfortunate side effect of AngularJS digest no longer being triggered for any request made with backendSrv. Because of this, external plugins using backendSrv directly may suffer from strange behaviour in the UI.
    To remedy this issue, as a plugin author you need to trigger the digest after a direct call to backendSrv.

    Alerting: Don't include image_url field with Slack message if empty. #22372, @aknuds1

  * Breaking changes
    + Annotations
      There are some breaking changes in the annotations HTTP API for region annotations. Region annotations are now represented
      using a single event instead of two seperate events. Check breaking changes in HTTP API below and HTTP API documentation for more details.
    + Docker
      Grafana is now using Alpine 3.10 as docker base image.
    + HTTP API
      - GET /api/alert-notifications now requires at least editor access.
        New /api/alert-notifications/lookup returns less information than /api/alert-notifications and can be access by any authenticated user.
      - GET /api/alert-notifiers now requires at least editor access
      - GET /api/org/users now requires org admin role.
        New /api/org/users/lookup returns less information than /api/org/users and can be access by users that are org admins,
        admin in any folder or admin of any team.
      - GET /api/annotations no longer returns regionId property.
      - POST /api/annotations no longer supports isRegion property.
      - PUT /api/annotations/:id no longer supports isRegion property.
      - PATCH /api/annotations/:id no longer supports isRegion property.
      - DELETE /api/annotations/region/:id has been removed.
  * Deprecation notes
    + PhantomJS
      - PhantomJS, which is used for rendering images of dashboards and panels,
        is deprecated and will be removed in a future Grafana release.
        A deprecation warning will from now on be logged when Grafana starts up if PhantomJS is in use.
        Please consider migrating from PhantomJS to the Grafana Image Renderer plugin.
