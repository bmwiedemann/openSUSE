%description
GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
operate on media data. Applications using this library can do anything
from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything
else media-related. Its plugin-based architecture means that new data
types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new
plug-ins.

This plugin contains the FFmpeg codecs, containing codecs for most popular
multimedia formats.
