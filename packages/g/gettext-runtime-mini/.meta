  <title>Tools for Native Language Support (NLS)</title>
  <description>This package contains the intl library as well as tools that ease the
creation and maintenance of message catalogs. It allows you to extract
strings from source code. The supplied Emacs mode (po-mode.el) helps
editing these catalogs (called PO files, for portable object) and
adding translations. A special compiler turns these PO files into
binary catalogs.</description>
