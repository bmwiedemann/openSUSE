%description
This package provides an efficient implementation of the Concise Binary Object
Representation (CBOR), as specified by [RFC
7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049).

If you are looking for a library for serialisation of Haskell values, have a
look at the [serialise](/package/serialise) package, which is built upon this
library.

An implementation of the standard bijection between CBOR and JSON is provided
by the [cborg-json](/package/cborg-json) package. Also see
[cbor-tool](/package/cbor-tool) for a convenient command-line utility for
working with CBOR data.

This package was formerly known as 'binary-serialise-cbor'.
