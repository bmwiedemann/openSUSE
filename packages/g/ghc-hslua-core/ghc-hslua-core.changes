- Update hslua-core to version 2.2.1.
  ## hslua-core-2.2.1

  Released 2022-06-19.

  -   Ensure that loadfile works with umlauts in filepath: The OS
      does not necessarily expect filenames to be UTF-8 encoded,
      especially Windows. On non-Windows systems, the current file
      system encoding is now used to convert filenames to C
      strings. On Windows, the `CP_ACP` codepage is used, as
      required by the Windows API.

  -   GC managed Lua state: Add new type `GCManagedState` and
      functions `newGCManagedState`, `closeGCManagedState`, and
      `withGCManagedState`. These allow to create and use a Lua
      state in flexible ways in that it does not require the state
      to be closed explicitly. The state will be closed when the
      respective variable is collected.

  -   Require lua-2.2.1.

  -   Relax upper bound for mtl, allow mtl-2.3.

- Update hslua-core to version 2.2.0.
  ## hslua-core-2.2.0

  Released 2022-02-19.

  -    Use lua-2.2.0, which requires Lua 5.4.

  -    Rename `newuserdata` to `newuserdatauv` and let it take the
       number of associated uservalues as an additional argument.

       Similarly, `newhsuserdata` is now `newhsuserdatauv`.

  -    Rename `getuservalue` and `setuservalue` to `getiuservalue`
       and `setiuservalue`, respectively. Like both functions now
       take an extra argument specifying the number of the uservalue
       that should be retrieved or set.

       It is now possible for `setiuservalue` to fail, so it returns
       a boolean to indicate whether the action was successful.

  -    The `GCControl` type has been updated to match the new gc
       control:

       -   The GCStep constructor takes an argument "stepsize";
       -   constructors GCGen and GCInc have been added;
       -   constructors GCSetPause and GCSetStepMul have been removed.

- Update hslua-core to version 2.1.0.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:

- Update hslua-core to version 2.0.0.2.
  ## hslua-core 2.0.0.2

  Released 2021-11-03.

  - Fixed output of `pushTypeMismatchError` when there is no value
    at the given index. Previously the function would report the
    value as type `string` and now reports it as `no value`.
