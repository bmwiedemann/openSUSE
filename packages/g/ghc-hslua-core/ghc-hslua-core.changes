- Update hslua-core to version 2.3.2.
  ## hslua-core-2.3.2

  Released 2024-01-18.

  -   Relaxed upper bound for text, and bytestring, allowing
      text-2.1, and bytestring-0.12.

- Update hslua-core to version 2.3.1.
  ## hslua-core-2.3.1

  Released 2023-03-17.

  -   New module *HsLua.Core.Debug*: the module provides bindings to
      a subset of functions of the Lua debug interface. Currently
      the module only exports `getupvalue` and `setupvalue`, both of
      which are also re-exported from *HsLua.Core*.

  ## hslua-core-2.3.0

  Released 2023-03-13.

  -   The functions `loadfile`, `dofile`, and `dofileTrace` now
      expect the argument to be of type `Maybe FilePath`. The
      functions load from *stdin* when the argument is `Nothing`.

  -   Added `setwarnf'` for simple warning messgae handling: The
      built-in method of setting a warn function is flexible but not
      straight-forward to use. The new `setwarnf'` function allows
      to set a Haskell action as a warning hook: the default warning
      behavior is kept in place, but, in addition to the default
      action, the hook is called on the concatenated warning
      messages. This can be used to plug Lua warnings into an
      application specific Haskell reporting system.

  -   Export `GCManagedState`, `newGCManagedState`,
      `closeGCManagedState`, and `withGCManagedState` from
      `HsLua.Core`.

- Updated spec file to conform with ghc-rpm-macros-2.5.2.

- Update hslua-core to version 2.2.1.
  ## hslua-core-2.2.1

  Released 2022-06-19.

  -   Ensure that loadfile works with umlauts in filepath: The OS
      does not necessarily expect filenames to be UTF-8 encoded,
      especially Windows. On non-Windows systems, the current file
      system encoding is now used to convert filenames to C
      strings. On Windows, the `CP_ACP` codepage is used, as
      required by the Windows API.

  -   GC managed Lua state: Add new type `GCManagedState` and
      functions `newGCManagedState`, `closeGCManagedState`, and
      `withGCManagedState`. These allow to create and use a Lua
      state in flexible ways in that it does not require the state
      to be closed explicitly. The state will be closed when the
      respective variable is collected.

  -   Require lua-2.2.1.

  -   Relax upper bound for mtl, allow mtl-2.3.

Sat Feb 19 14:38:17 UTC 2022 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update hslua-core to version 2.2.0.
  ## hslua-core-2.2.0

  Released 2022-02-19.

  -    Use lua-2.2.0, which requires Lua 5.4.

  -    Rename `newuserdata` to `newuserdatauv` and let it take the
       number of associated uservalues as an additional argument.

       Similarly, `newhsuserdata` is now `newhsuserdatauv`.

  -    Rename `getuservalue` and `setuservalue` to `getiuservalue`
       and `setiuservalue`, respectively. Like both functions now
       take an extra argument specifying the number of the uservalue
       that should be retrieved or set.

       It is now possible for `setiuservalue` to fail, so it returns
       a boolean to indicate whether the action was successful.

  -    The `GCControl` type has been updated to match the new gc
       control:

       -   The GCStep constructor takes an argument "stepsize";
       -   constructors GCGen and GCInc have been added;
       -   constructors GCSetPause and GCSetStepMul have been removed.

- Update hslua-core to version 2.1.0.
  Upstream has edited the change log file since the last release in
  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslua-core-2.1.0/src/CHANGELOG.md

- Update hslua-core to version 2.0.0.2.
  ## hslua-core 2.0.0.2

  Released 2021-11-03.

  - Fixed output of `pushTypeMismatchError` when there is no value
    at the given index. Previously the function would report the
    value as type `string` and now reports it as `no value`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  1 08:26:50 UTC 2021 - psimons@suse.com

- Add hslua-core at version 2.0.0.1.
