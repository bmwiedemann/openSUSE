  <title>Git commit message linter checking</title>
  <description>Great for use as a commit-msg git hook or as part of your gating script in
a CI/CD pipeline (e.g. jenkins). Many of the gitlint validations are based
on well-known community standards, others are based on checks that we've
found useful throughout the years. Gitlint has sane defaults, but you can
also easily customize it to your own liking.
