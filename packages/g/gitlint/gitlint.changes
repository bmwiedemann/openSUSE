- update to 0.18.0:
  * Python 3.11 support
  * Last release to support Python 3.6 (EOL since 2021-12-23)
  * **Behavior Change**: In a future release, gitlint will be
    switching to use `re.search` instead of `re.match` semantics
    for all rules. Your rule regexes might need updating as a
    result, gitlint will print a warning if so. More details are
    in the docs. (#254)
  * gitlint no longer uses the sh library by default in an
    attempt to reduce external dependencies. In case of issues,
    the use of `sh` can be re-enabled by setting the env var
    `GITLINT_USE_SH_LIB=1`. This fallback will be removed
    entirely in a future gitlint release. (#351)
  * `--commits` now also accepts a comma-separated list of commit
    hashes, making it possible to lint a list of non-contiguous
    commits without invoking gitlint multiple times (#283)
  * Improved handling of branches that have no commits (#188)
  * Support for `GITLINT_CONFIG` env variable (#189)
  * Added a new `gitlint-ci` pre-commit hook, making it easier to
    run gitlint through pre-commit in CI (#191)
  * Gitlint now recognizes `fixup=amend` commits (see related
    git documentation), available as
    `commit.is_fixup_amend_commit=True`
  * Gitlint now parses diff **stat** information, available
    in `commit.changed_files_stats` (#314)
  * Bugfixes:
  *   - Use correct encoding when using `--msg-filename`
    parameter (#310)
  *   - Various documentation fixes (#244) (#263) (#266) (#294)
    (#295) (#347) (#364) - thanks scop, OrBin, jtaylor100,
    stauchert
  * Gitlint is now split in 2 packages: `gitlint` and `gitlint-
    core`. This allows users to install gitlint without pinned
    dependencies (which is the default) (#162)
  * Python 3.10 support
  * **New Rule**: ignore-by-author-name allows users to skip
    linting commit messages made by specific authors
  * `--commit ` flag to more easily lint a single commit message
    (#141)
  * `--fail-without-commits` flag will force gitlint to fail
    (exit code 253) when the target commit range is empty
    (typically when using `--commits`)  (#193)
  * Bugfixes:
  *   - contrib-title-conventional-commits (CT1)  now properly
    enforces the commit type (#185)
  *   - contrib-title-conventional-commits (CT1) now supports the
    BREAKING CHANGE symbol "!" (#186)
  * Heads-up: Python 3.6 will become EOL at the end of 2021. It's
    likely that future gitlint releases will stop supporting
    Python 3.6 as a result. We will continue to support Python
    3.6 as long as its easily doable, which in practice usually
    means as long as our dependencies support it.
  * Under-the-hood: dependencies updated, test and github action
    improvements.
  *   - Git commit message body with only new lines is not longer
    considered empty by `body-is-missing` (#176)
  *   - Added compatibility with `git commit -s` for `contrib-
    requires-signed-off-by` rule (#178)
  * Minor tweak to gitlint commit-hook output (#173)
  * All dependencies have been upgraded to the latest available
    versions (`Click==7.1.2`, `arrow==1.0.3`, `sh==1.14.1`).
  * Minor doc fixes
  * **This release drops support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.5
    (both are EOL). Other than a few minor fixes, there are no
    functional differences from the 0.14.0 release.**
  * Other call-outs:
  * **Mac users**: Gitlint can now be installed using both
    homebrew (upgraded to latest) and macports. Special thanks to
    @harens for maintaining these packages (best-effort).
  * Bugfix: Gitlint now properly handles exceptions when using
    its built-in commit-msg hook (#166).
  * All dependencies have been upgraded to the latest available
    versions (`Click==7.1.2`, `arrow==0.17.0`, `sh==1.14.1`).
  * Much under-the-hood refactoring as a result of dropping
    Python 2.7
  * **IMPORTANT: Gitlint 0.14.x will be the last gitlint release
    to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.5, as both are EOL which
    makes it difficult to keep supporting them.**
  * Python 3.9 support
  * **New Rule**: title-min-length enforces a minimum length on
    titles (default: 5 chars) (#138)
  * **New Rule**: body-match-regex allows users to enforce that
    the commit-msg body matches a given regex (#130)
  * **New Rule**: ignore-body-lines allows users to
  * ignore parts of a commit by matching a regex against
  * the lines in a commit message body (#126)
  * Named Rules allow users to have multiple instances of the
    same rule active at the same time. This is useful when you
    want to enforce the same rule multiple times but with
    different options (#113, #66)
  * User-defined Configuration Rules allow users to dynamically
    change gitlint's configuration and/or the commit *before* any
    other rules are applied.
  * The `commit-msg` hook has been re-written in Python (it
    contained a lot of Bash before), fixing a number of platform
    specific issues. Existing users will need to reinstall their
    hooks (`gitlint uninstall-hook; gitlint install-hook`) to
    make use of this.
  * Most general options can now be set through environment
    variables (e.g. set the `general.ignore` option via
    `GITLINT_IGNORE=T1,T2`). The list of available environment
    variables can be found in the configuration documentation.
  * Users can now use `self.log.debug("my message")` for
    debugging purposes in their user-defined rules. Debug
    messages will show up when running `gitlint --debug`.
  * **Breaking**: User-defined rule id's can no longer start with
    'I', as those are reserved for built-in gitlint ignore rules.
  *  New `RegexOption` rule option type for use in user-defined
    rules. By using the `RegexOption`, regular expressions are
    pre-validated at gitlint startup and compiled only once which
    is much more efficient when linting multiple commits.
  * Bugfixes:
  *   -  Improved UTF-8 fallback on Windows (ongoing - #96)
  *   - Windows users can now use the 'edit' function of the
    `commit-msg` hook (#94)
  *   -  Doc update: Users should use `--ulimit nofile=1024` when
    invoking gitlint using Docker (#129)
  *   - The `commit-msg` hook was broken in Ubuntu's gitlint
    package due to a python/python3 mismatch (#127)
  *   - Better error message when no git username is set (#149)
  *   - Options can now actually be set to `None` (from code) to
    make them optional.
  *   -  Ignore rules no longer have `"None"` as default regex,
    but an empty regex - effectively disabling them by default
    (as intended).
  * Contrib Rules:
  *   - Added 'ci' and 'build' to conventional commit types
    (#135)
  * Under-the-hood: minor performance improvements (removed some
    unnecessary regex matching), test improvements, improved
    debug logging, CI runs on pull requests, PR request template.
- build only for primary python, this is a cli tool
- drop relax-requirements.patch (unnecessary with the switch to gitlint-core)

Wed Jan 27 15:50:32 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix filelist: do not use %{name}, as python single-spec rewrites
  the value 'as needed', interfering in this case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 16 23:17:13 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.13.1:
  * Patch to enable --staged flag for pre-commit.
  * Minor doc updates (#109)
  Revert Commits are now recognized and ignored by default (#99)
  --staged flag: gitlint can now detect meta-data (such as author details, changed files, etc) of staged/pre-commits. Useful when you use gitlint's commit-msg hook or precommit (#105)
  * New branch properties on GitCommit and GitContext, useful when writing your own user-defined rules: commit.branches and commit.context.current_branch (#108)
  * Python 3.8 support
  * Python 3.4 no longer supported. Python 3.4 has reached EOL and an increasing
  * Gitlint no longer crashes when acting on empty repositories (this only occurred in specific circumstances).
  * Under-the-hood: dependencies updated, unit and integration test improvements, migrated from TravisCI to Github Actions.
