%description -n %lname
Givaro is a C++ library for arithmetic and algebraic computations.

Its main features are implementations of the basic arithmetic of many
mathematical entities: Primes fields, Extensions Fields, Finite
Fields, Finite Rings, Polynomials, Algebraic numbers, Arbitrary
precision integers and rationals. It also provides data structures
and templated classes for the manipulation of basic algebraic
objects, such as vectors, matrices (dense, sparse, structured),
univariate polynomials (and therefore recursive multivariate).

It contains different program modules and is fully compatible with
the LinBox linear algebra library and the KAAPI kernel for
Adaptative, Asynchronous Parallel and Interactive programming.
