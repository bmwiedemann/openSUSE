%description
`conduit` is a solution to the streaming data problem, allowing for production,
transformation, and consumption of streams of data in constant memory.
It is an alternative to lazy I/O which guarantees deterministic resource
handling.

For more information about conduit in general, and how this package in
particular fits into the ecosystem, see [the conduit
homepage](https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit#readme).
