  <description>
GluCat is a library of template classes which model the universal Clifford algebras over the field of real numbers, with arbitrary dimension and arbitrary signature. GluCat implements a model of each Clifford algebra corresponding to each non-degenerate quadratic form up to a maximum number of dimensions.
