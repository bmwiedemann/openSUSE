Mon Jul 11 08:28:12 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.8.2:
  + The GluCat classes basis_matrix_t and framed_multi<> have been
    refined.
  + The class basis_matrix_t is now based on int rather than on
    Scalar_T. This should make basis matrix generation more
    efficient, especially when Scalar_T is of class dd_real or
    qd_real.
  + The class framed_multi<> is now based on either
    map<index_set_t, Scalar_T> or unordered_map<index_set_t,
    Scalar_T>, rather than the previous base class, map<const
    index_set_t, Scalar_T> or unordered_map<const index_set_t,
    Scalar_T>.  This is for compatibility with the libc++
    implementations of these bases classes.
  + The framed_multi<> and matrix_multi<> constructors that use
    the parameters val, frm and prechecked have changed. The frame
    used for the constuction now includes the union of val.frame()
    with frm, and these constructors no longer throw an exception
    if val is oustide of frm.
  + A new function, reframe(lhs,rhs,lhs_reframed,rhs_reframed)
    fixes a bug in reframing for binary operations on class
    matrix_multi<>.
  + The function reframe(self, ixt) in pyclical/PyCliCal.pyx now
    puts self into a larger frame, containing the union of
    self.frame() and index set ixt.
  + GluCat now compiles with clang++ and libc++.
  + PyClical can now be built with g++ version 4.8 and possibly
    earlier versions.
  + GluCat also compiles cleanly with Intel C++ 16.0.2.
- Drop patches incorporated upstream:
  + glucat-pyclical-demos-dir.patch
  + glucat-doxygen-build-workaround.patch
  + glucat-pyclical-pythonpath.patch.
- Pyclical module now builds with gcc older than 4.9 again,
  reenable python-glucat for openSUSE 13.2 and older.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  5 15:54:55 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.8.1:
  + The configuration option --with-tuning=arg controls test
    tuning via preprocessor macros and the header files
    test/tuning.h and test/undefine.h.
  + The configuration option --enable-check-isnan controls checks
    for NaN values, and the configuration option --with-pool-alloc
    controls the use of the Boost pool allocator.
  + The scripts test/test-all-config-options.sh,
    test/diff-all-config-outputs.sh and
    test/copy-all-config-outputs.sh enable comprehensive tesing of
    configuation options.
  + The use of Autotools has again been improved, with
    enhancements to make, make clean, make dist and make install,
    and the introduction of make check, make doc and make
    install-doc. 
- Use make check for the %check section.
- Add glucat-pyclical-demos-dir.patch to add a configure option
  "--with-demo-dir" to set a custom path to install the
  pyclical demos (defaults to %%{_datadir}/pyclical/demos);
  patch submitted upstream. We use this option to install the
  demos to %{_docdir}/%{name}/demos.
- Add glucat-doxygen-build-workaround.patch: required to
  circumvent a known doxygen 1.8.11 regression (bgo#762982); only
  required for openSUSE > 13.2. This patch should be dropped when
  the upstream doxygen bug is fixed and the fixed version is made
  available for openSUSE:Factory.
- Add glucat-pyclical-pythonpath.patch to include the correct dir
  for the Pycilcal module before building the pyclical notebooks;
  patch sent upstream.
- Add BuildRequires: automake, autoconf; new patches modify
  autotool build files.
- Package pyclical demos.
- Pyclical module does not build for openSUSE <= 13.2 or Leap
  42.1.
- Build HTML and PDF documentation, package them in a separate 
  sub-package; add BuildRequires on texlive packages required for
  building the PDF documentation.

    - <ext/hash_map> (was enabled by the option
      _GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP).
    - <backward/hash_map> (_GLUCAT_USE_BACKWARD_HASH_MAP).
    - <tr1/unordered_map> (_GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP).
    - <tr1/random> (the old default: the option
      _GLUCAT_USE_STD_RANDOM is no longer needed, and is ignored,
      as <random> is now the default).
    - <alglib/evd.h> (_GLUCAT_USE_ALGLIB).
    - <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/gees.hpp>
       (_GLUCAT_USE_BINDINGS_V1).

- Update to version 0.7.2:
  + When used with PyClical now generates IPython notebooks
  + The Pyclical tutorials are now accompanied by corresponding
    IPython notebooks.
  + The nork() function in matrix.h and matrix_imp.h is now
    accompanied by the signed_perm_nork() function, which is
    faster for the case used by fast<>() in matrix_mult_imp.h
  + Use of the Boost pool allocator with framed_multi<> is now
    optional, controlled via the new symbol
    _GLUCAT_USE_BOOST_POOL_ALLOC
  + GluCat compiles cleanly with g++ 4.8: does not trigger the
    "unused local typedefs" warning caused by the addition of
    -Wunused-local-typedefs to -Wall in g++ 4.8. See
    http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2011-07/msg02460.html
    http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2012-05/msg01388.html
  + Also compiles cleanly and builds correctly with clang++ 3.4

Thu Oct 11 06:32:01 UTC 2012 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.7.0:
  + More accurate sqrt and transcendental functions and includes
    PyClical tutorials
  + The PyClical Python extension module now comes with a set of
    tutorials that guide you through working with Clifford algebra
    calculations in Python
  + The GluCat library now supports C++11, including
    <unordered_map> and <random>
  + Now has transcendental functions that are more accurate when
    used with higher precision arithmetic. This is accomplished by
    using different Pade' approximations according to
    the numerical precision needed
  + The class glucat::framed_multi<> based on hash_map or
    unordered_map now uses constructors that specify an initial
    number of buckets
  + The basis_element cache used for glucat::matrix_multi<> now
    uses pointers to matrices instead of matrices
  + The GluCat header files have been reorganized so that they now
    directly include the header files they depend on, rather than
    relying on glucat/glucat.h and glucat/glucat_imp.h to do this
  + The default options for ./configure now yield the simplest
    usable production case: ./configure without arguments with
    GluCat 0.7.0 gives the same results as
    "./configure --with-map=unordered --enable-debug=no
    --enable-pyclical" did with GluCat 0.6.0
  + The README and INSTALL files have been completely rewritten,
    and AUTHORS has been updated.

- Update to version 0.6.0:
  + Includes the PyClical extension module for Python
  + Changes to the clifford_algebra<> API:
    - The real() function is now synonymous with scalar() and the
      imag() function always returns 0
    - New operators lhs | rhs and lhs |= rhs transform lhs by the
      twisted adjoint action of rhs

      commutes with all members of the frame of the multivector
      val. The name "elliptic" is now deprecated: use
      "complexifier" instead
    - New functions sqrt(val,i,prechecked), and
      log(val,i,prechecked) : square root and logarithm of
      multivector with specified complexifier
