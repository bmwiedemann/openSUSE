  <description>govulncheck is a CLI tool to report known vulnerabilities that affect Go code. It uses static analysis of source code or a binary's symbol table to narrow down reports to only those that could affect the application.

By default, govulncheck makes requests to the Go vulnerability database at https://vuln.go.dev. Requests to the vulnerability database contain only module paths, not code or other properties of your program. See https://vuln.go.dev/privacy.html for more. Use the -db flag to specify a different database, which must implement the specification at https://go.dev/security/vuln/database.</description>
