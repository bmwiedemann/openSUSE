  <title>Manages Multiple Stacked Monitors</title>
  <description>With a single process, GKrellM manages multiple stacked monitors and
supports applying themes to match the monitors appearance to your
window manager, Gtk, or any other theme.

* SMP CPU, Disk, Proc, and active net interface monitors with LEDs.

* Internet monitor that displays current and charts historical port
   hits.

* Memory and swap space usage meters and a system uptime monitor.

* File system meters show capacity and free space and can mount and
   umount.

* A mailbox monitor that can launch a mail reader and fetch remote
   mail.

* Clock, calendar, and hostname display.

* APM laptop battery monitor.

* CPU and motherboard temperature display if lm_sensors modules are
   installed.

* Multiple monitors managed by a single process to reduce system
   load.

* PPP on and off button that can execute your PPP scripts.

* Charts are autoscaling with configurable grid line resolution.

* Separate colors for &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; data.  The in color is used for
   CPU user time, disk read, forks, and net receive data.  The out
   color is used for CPU sys time, disk write, load, and net
   transmit data.

* A different theme can be created with the GIMP.</description>
