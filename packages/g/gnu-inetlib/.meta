  <title>Library of clients for common internet protocols</title>
  <description>GNU inetlib is a library of clients for common internet protocols. The
following protocols are currently supported: Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP) Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Post Office
Protocol (POP) Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) (alpha) Gopher Finger The inetlib
library is similar in intent to the Python internet protocols library -
the API is as close as possible to the intent of the underlying
protocol design. This allows for very efficient coding of user agents.
Additionally, inetlib includes URLStreamHandler implementations for
some of the protocols. These can be used to add support for the
corresponding URL scheme to the java.net.URL class.</description>
