%description
A custom prelude with no dependencies apart from base.

This package has the following goals:

* provide a base like sets of modules that provide a consistent set of features
and bugfixes across multiple versions of GHC (unlike base).

* provide a better and more efficient prelude than base's prelude.

* be self-sufficient: no external dependencies apart from base.

* provide better data-types: packed unicode string by default, arrays.

* Better numerical classes that better represent mathematical thing (No more
all-in-one Num).

* Better I/O system with less Lazy IO

* Usual partial functions distinguished through type system.
