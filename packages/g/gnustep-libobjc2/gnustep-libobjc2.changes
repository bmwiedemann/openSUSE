Sat Feb 27 13:42:59 UTC 2021 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.1:
  * Numerous improvements to the Objective-C++ exception
    interoperation code.
  * Fix silently ignored message sent to `super` where the
    corresponding method does not exist.
  * Fix the checks for overloaded memory management methods.
  * Several memory management bugs in corner cases of weak
    reference management were fixed.
  * Fix a bug in `objc_msgSend` that used to lead to stack
    corruption on ARM.
  * Rewrite the ARC code as C++ using a third-party Robin-Hood
    hash table to store weak references.
  * Add support for the C11 _Atomic type qualifier in property
    metadata.
- New build dependency: robin-map-devel.

- Update to version 2.0
  * This release introduces a new Objective-C ABI, which is
    designed to be forward compatible with future changes and
    removes a large number of hacks that were required for
    compatibility with the prior ABI that included features
    introduced in the 1980s.  Highlights include:
    + The linker now removes duplicate selectors within a
      library.
    + The linker will remove duplicate protocol definitions
      within a library.
    + Protocols and classes are now always accessed via an
      indirection layer, so they can be extended by future
      versions of the ABI without breaking compatibility.
    + Categories can include property metadata and both
      categories.
    + Constant strings are now emitted with a richer structure,
      which provides faster hashing and better unicode support.
    + Instance variable metadata includes size and alignment,
      allowing better object layout and more accurate
      introspection.  Instance variable metadata now includes
      more accurate information about ARC ownership semantics.
    + Method metadata now includes extended type information,
      allowing bridged languages to understand the class that
      methods expect and not just the fact that they take an
      object.  This was previously an obstacle to supporting
      JavaScriptCore's Objective-C bridge with GNUstep.

- Update to version 1.9
  * Support for 64-bit ARM (AArch64) processors, including
    assembly fast paths for message sending.
  * Improved the dispatch table representation to improve
    performance and cache usage on the fast path.
  * The implementation of `imp_implementationWithBlock`, the
    function that allows blocks to be used as methods, no longer
    requires physical pages to be mapped both writeable and
    executable.
  * Numerous improvements to the interaction between runtime
    functions and ARC.
  * Support for Thumb-2 interworking on ARM.  Note that the
    library must be compiled for ARMv7 or ARMv6T2 for this code
    to be enabled. Once it has been, other Objective-C binaries
    linked with the library can be compiled as ARM or Thumb-2
    code.  This will also generate Thumb-2 message send
    functions, improving instruction cache usage.
  * Significant improvements to ARC, including
    + The runtime no longer acquires a global lock on every
      object deallocation (a global lock is still used for
      objects that have weak references). *NOTE:* This is
      incompatible with other code directly inspecting the
      reference count and will break with older versions of
      GNUstep Base!
    + Weak references use a scheme closer to C++
      `std::weak_pointer` and are lazily zeroed on access.  This
      reduces the space overheads for weak references.
    + Some additional helper functions are added for use in
      `NSObject` and other root classes,  which simplifies the
      layering between the runtime and the Foundation (or
      equivalent) implementation.
  * Improvements to how the runtime handles layout of ivars with
    strong alignment requirements, which should fix issues
    relating to using vector types in Objective-C objects.
  * The option to build a separate libobjcxx has been removed. 
    The runtime will now depend on the C++ standard library
    implementation if no useable C++ runtime is available.  Note
    that C++ exception interworking does not work because LLVM's
    libc++abi (shipped by Apple) does not provide GNU-compatible
    hooks and so Objective-C++ exception support will be
    automatically disabled on this platform.  Any other
    platforms shipping libc++abi should consider either GNU
    libsupc++ or libcxxrt as an alternative.
