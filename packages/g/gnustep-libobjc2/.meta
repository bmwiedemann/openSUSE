  <title>GNUstep Objective-C Runtime</title>
  <description>
The GNUstep Objective-C runtime is designed as a drop-in replacement for the
GCC runtime.  It supports both a legacy and a modern ABI, allowing code
compiled with old versions of GCC to be supported without requiring
recompilation.  The modern ABI adds the following features:

	  - Non-fragile instance variables.
	  - Protocol uniquing.
	  - Object planes support.
	  - Declared property introspection.
