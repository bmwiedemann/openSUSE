- Update to version 49.0:
  + Updated translations
- Changes from version 49.rc:
  + We have headed to the big screen with a much anticipated
    fullscreen mode, in part made possible by the ever-improving
    libadwaita.
  + A big focus this cycle has been error handling, to which end we
    now better report errors to the user, complete with debug
    information for bug reports, and there also — helped by much
    expanded unit testing — should be far fewer opportunities for
    things going awry in the first place.
- Add mutter BuildRequires and launch meson test suite with mutter
  as display server.
- Don't run the test suite on s390x: the virtual mutter and Mesa do
  not play right together.

- Update to version 47.beta:
  + The preferences dialogue has been expanded to include
    scrollback size, and there has been behind the scenes work
    fixing some pesky issues and setting up future improvements.
  + Thanks to work elsewhere in the stack, we now have restored
    screen reader support. This has taken far too long, and there
    is more work do be done, but hopefully this is a significant
    step forward.
  + Additionally reworked our styles to take advantage of
    improvements in Gtk, and keep current with developments in
    Adwaita, and some more fixes.
  + Updated translations.

  + Various of our dialogues have been reworked to improve
    correctness, including how they handle especially long strings.

  + We continue to take advantage of newer Vte features wherever
    appropriate.
