- Update to version 1.20.1:
  + Fix race in rtsp-client when tunneling over HTTP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  9 22:38:30 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.20.0:
  + GstRTSPMediaFactory gained API to disable RTCP
    (gst_rtsp_media_factory_set_enable_rtcp(), "enable-rtcp"
    property). Previously RTCP was always allowed for all RTSP
    medias. With this change it is possible to disable RTCP
    completely, irrespective of whether the client wants to do RTCP
    or not.
  + Make a mount point of / work correctly. While not allowed by
    the RTSP 2 spec, the RTSP 1 spec is silent on this and it is
    used in the wild. It is now possible to use / as a mount path
    in gst-rtsp-server, e.g. rtsp://example.com/ would work with
    this now. Note that query/fragment parts of the URI are not
    necessarily correctly handled, and behaviour will differ
    between various client/server implementations; so use it if you
    must but don't bug us if it doesn't work with third party
    clients as you'd hoped.
  + multithreading fixes (races, refcounting issues, deadlocks).
  + ONVIF audio backchannel fixes.
  + ONVIF trick mode optimisations.
  + rtspclientsink: new "update-sdp" signal that allows updating
    the SDP before sending it to the server via ANNOUNCE. This can
    be used to add additional metadata to the SDP, for example. The
    order and number of medias must not be changed, however.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  4 19:45:17 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.18.6:
  + rtsp-stream: fix get_rates raciness
  + rtsp-media: Only unprepare a media if it was not already
    unpreparing anyway
  + rtsp-media: Unprepare suspended medias too
  + rtsp-client: make sure sessmedia will not get freed while used
  + rtsp-media: Also mark receive-only (RECORD) medias as prepared
    when unsuspending
  + rtsp-session: Don't unref medias twice if it is removed inside
  + examples: Fix leak in appsrc2 example
- Drop service, use source url, upstream changes in git.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 20 16:59:00 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix parameters passed to meson: with meson 60, the parameters are
  strictly checked, which helps in identifying those wrong
  parameters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 15 10:02:59 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.18.5:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 16 20:00:07 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.18.3:
  + rtsp-media: Only count senders when counting blocked streams
  + rtsp-client: Only unref client watch context on finalize, to
    avoid deadlock

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 10 08:41:39 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.18.2:
  + stream: collect a clock_rate when blocking
  + media:
    - Ignore GstRTSPStreamBlocking from incomplete streams, to
      prevent cases with prerolling when the inactive stream
      prerolls first and the server proceeds without waiting for
      the active stream. When there are no complete streams (during
      DESCRIBE), we will listen to all streams.
    - Use guint64 for setting the size-time property on rtpstorage,
      fixes potential crashes or memory corruption.
    - Get rates only on sender streams, fixing issue with ONVIF
      audio backchannel streams
    - Plug memory leak
- Fix the _service file and spec to really use the tarball
  generated by service.
