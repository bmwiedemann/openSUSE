%description
This library provides a pure Haskell implementation of the Unicode Collation
Algorithm described at <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/>. It is not as
fully-featured or as performant as 'text-icu', but it avoids a dependency on a
large C library. Locale-specific tailorings are also provided.
