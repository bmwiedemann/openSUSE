%description
'HsYAML' is a [YAML 1.2](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) processor, i.e.
a library for parsing and serializing YAML documents.

Features of 'HsYAML' include:

* Pure Haskell implementation with small dependency footprint and emphasis on
strict compliance with the [YAML 1.2
specification](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html). * Direct decoding to native
Haskell types via ('aeson'-inspired) typeclass-based API (see "Data.YAML").
* Allows round-tripping while preserving ordering, anchors, and comments at
Event-level. * Support for constructing custom YAML node graph representation
(including support for cyclic YAML data structures). * Support for the standard
(untyped) /Failsafe/, (strict) /JSON/, and (flexible) /Core/ "schemas"
providing implicit typing rules as defined in the YAML 1.2 specification
(including support for user-defined custom schemas; see "Data.YAML.Schema").
* Support for emitting YAML using /Failsafe/, (strict) /JSON/, and (flexible)
/Core/ "schemas" (including support for user-defined custom encoding schemas;
see "Data.YAML.Schema"). * Event-based API resembling LibYAML's Event-based API
(see "Data.YAML.Event"). * Low-level API access to lexical token-based scanner
(see "Data.YAML.Token").

See also the <//hackage.haskell.org/package/HsYAML-aeson HsYAML-aeson> package
which allows to decode and encode YAML by leveraging 'aeson''s 'FromJSON' and
'ToJSON' instances.
