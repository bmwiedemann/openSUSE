      assistant instead of just asking for the main branch (#5057)
    - git town set-parent now presents the same hierarchical branch
      list as git town switch (#5259)
    - When prompting for a parent branch, Git Town now also shows

      contribution regex, (#5133, #5132)

- Update to version 21.2.0:
  * New Features
    - Git Town can now use GitHub's gh CLI to talk to the GitHub
      API. No more messing with access tokens manually! (#1639)
    - GitLab users get the same treatment: Git Town now integrates
      with the glab CLI to access the GitLab API (#5079).
    - Dropped the dependency on which on Unix-like systems. One
      less external tool to worry about (#5060).
    - Git Town is now in the official Arch Linux repositories.
      Install with pacman -S git-town (#5015).
    - Git Town is now also available on OpenSUSE Stable and
      Tumbleweed.
    - The Setup Assistant now validates the forge information you
      enter works. If the connection fails, you get a chance to
      enter the credentials again. No more silent
      misconfigurations. (#3030).
  * Bug Fixes
    - git town diff-parent now shows only the changes introduced by
      the current branch, even when it's behind its parent (#5053).

      arguments correctly (#5072).
    - Continuing a suspended Git Town command that needs forge
      access now works correctly in all edge cases (#5098).
    - All interactive dialogs now render properly in
      80-character-wide terminals (#5074).
    - The setup assistant now correctly pre-selects the token scope
      you previously configured (#5046).
