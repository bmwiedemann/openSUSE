- Update to version 22.0.0:
  * BREAKING CHANGES
    - Renamed the codeberg connector to forgejo since it supports
      all Forgejo-based forges. Codeberg itself runs on Forgejo
      (#5447).
    - Start the setup assistant with git town init instead of git
      town config setup, matching Git's git init (#5269).
    - git town hack no longer converts an existing branch into a
      feature branch. Use the new feature command instead (#5516).
    - The contribute, feature, observe, park, and prototype
      commands no longer signal a problem when you run them on a
      branch that already has the desired type.
    - Removed the long-deprecated kill command. Use delete instead.
  * New Features
    - Added support for Azure DevOps (#1657).
    - Introduced the push-branches setting to control whether Git
      Town pushes local changes to tracking branches automatically.
      Disable it if you prefer to push manually (#5541).
    - Introduced the auto-sync setting to control whether hack,
      append, and prepend sync existing branches before creating a
      new one (#5540).
    - set-parent: added the --none flag to create perennial
      branches programmatically.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed git town branch in repos with a detached HEAD (#5565).
  * Dependecies
    - Go 1.24 (#5559)

- Update to version 21.5.0:
  * New Features
    - Added up and down commands to quickly move to the child or
      parent of the current branch (#5432).
    - All configuration settings can now be provided via
      environment variables, in addition to the config file and Git
      metadata. This makes it easy to use custom scripts that
      provide configuration data (#5446). For example, to load an
      API token from 1password CLI:

       GIT_TOWN_GITHUB_TOKEN=$(op read op://development/GitHub/credentials/personal_token) git town config

    - The hack, append, and prepend commands now support a stash
      flag and config option to leave staged changes as-is. Handy
      if you've carefully prepared an index you want to commit to a
      new branch (#5429).
    - The setup assistant can now do a quick setup with only the
      essential settings (#5484).
    - Added a new feature command to convert the given or current
      branch into a feature branch (#5376).
    - The detached sync flag can now be permanently enabled through
      the new detached configuration setting (#5452).
    - The auto-resolve flag can now be disabled with
      --no-auto-resolve (#5458).
  * Bug Fixes
    - The setup assistant no longer stores a dev-remote when the
      user selects the default option (#5492).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 20 06:07:44 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 21.4.3:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fewer phantom merge conflicts: Git Town now performs a
      rebase-onto only if there are actual commits to remove. If
      there are no commits to remove, Git Town performs a regular
      rebase, or if there is no need to sync, no rebase at all.
      (#5422)
    - "git town branch" prints branches in other worktrees
      de-emphasized (#5405)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 21.4.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Git Town no longer mistakes legit file conflicts for phantom
      conflicts (#5156, #5140)
    - delete: Git Town now rebases onto the correct branch (#5358)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 21.4.1:
  * Bug Fixes

      disable auto-resolving phantom conflicts (#5326).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 04 04:58:13 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 21.4.0:
  * New Features
    - The setup assistant now correctly handles existing
      configuration settings in global Git metadata (#5201)
    - When Git Town is unconfigured, it now runs the full setup
      assistant instead of just asking for the main branch (#5057)
    - git town set-parent now presents the same hierarchical branch
      list as git town switch (#5259)
    - When prompting for a parent branch, Git Town now also shows
      the hierarchical list from git town switch (#5266)
    - Added a configuration option and CLI switch to disable
      automatic resolving of phantom merge conflicts for cases
      where manual conflict resolution is preferred (#5317)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Phantom merge conflicts are now auto-resolved even when your
      stack is rooted in a perennial branch instead of the main
      branch (#5193)
    - The glab connector now correctly updates merge proposal
      targets (#5283)
    - Git Town now also removes branch type overrides when it
      deletes branches that were shipped at the remote (#5274)
    - The setup assistant now cleans up local Git metadata when you
      opt to save configuration globally (#5230)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * New Features in setup assistant:
    - now creates configuration files with name git-town.toml
      instead of the deprecated git-branches.toml (#5162)
    - now gives the user a chance to enter the observed regex and
      contribution regex, (#5133, #5132)
    - when entering perennial branches, the main and perennial
      branches from the config file are now preselected and locked
      (#5154)
    - no longer asks for the dev remote if only one Git remote
      exists (#5153)
    - now updates Git metadata only if the user entered a different
      value than already exists (#5127)
    - no longer creates commented out entries (#5110)
    - now explains how to run it manually (#5155)
  * Bug Fixes
    - updating the base branch in a stack using the gh connector
      works now (#5163)
    - setup assistant:
      - now displays the entered value for the API token scope
        (#5144)

- Update to version 21.2.0:
  * New Features
    - Git Town can now use GitHub's gh CLI to talk to the GitHub
      API. No more messing with access tokens manually! (#1639)
    - GitLab users get the same treatment: Git Town now integrates
      with the glab CLI to access the GitLab API (#5079).
    - Dropped the dependency on which on Unix-like systems. One
      less external tool to worry about (#5060).

    - Git Town is now also available on OpenSUSE Stable and
      Tumbleweed.
    - The Setup Assistant now validates the forge information you
      enter works. If the connection fails, you get a chance to
      enter the credentials again. No more silent
      misconfigurations. (#3030).
  * Bug Fixes
    - git town diff-parent now shows only the changes introduced by
      the current branch, even when it's behind its parent (#5053).
    - The GitLab connector now handles the --title and --body
      arguments correctly (#5072).
    - Continuing a suspended Git Town command that needs forge
      access now works correctly in all edge cases (#5098).
    - All interactive dialogs now render properly in
      80-character-wide terminals (#5074).
    - The setup assistant now correctly pre-selects the token scope
      you previously configured (#5046).
