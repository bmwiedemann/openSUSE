%description
Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
Haskell. For more information or to download the latest version, you can visit
the Snap project website at <http://snapframework.com/>.

This library contains the core definitions and types for the Snap framework,
including:

1. Primitive types and functions for HTTP (requests, responses, cookies,
post/query parameters, etc)

2. A monad for programming web handlers called "Snap", which allows:

* Stateful access to the HTTP request and response objects

* Monadic failure (i.e. MonadPlus/Alternative instances) for declining to
handle requests and chaining handlers together

* Early termination of the computation if you know early what you want to
return and want to prevent further monadic processing

/Quick start/: The 'Snap' monad and HTTP definitions are in "Snap.Core".
