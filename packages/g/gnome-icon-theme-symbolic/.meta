  <title>Symbolic icon theme for GNOME</title>
  <description>The purpose of this icon theme is to extend the base icon theme that
follows the Tango style guidelines for specific purposes. This would
include OSD messages, panel system/notification area, and possibly
menu icons.

Icons follow the naming specification, but have a -symbolic suffix, so
only applications specifically looking up these symbolic icons will
render them. If a -symbolic icon is missing, the app will fall back to
the regular name.</description>
