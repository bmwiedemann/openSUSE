%description
A reusable library containing hledger's core functionality. This is used by
most hledger* packages so that they support the same common file formats,
command line options, reports etc.

hledger is a robust, cross-platform set of tools for tracking money, time, or
any other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple, editable file
format, with command-line, terminal and web interfaces. It is a Haskell rewrite
of Ledger, and one of the leading implementations of Plain Text Accounting.
