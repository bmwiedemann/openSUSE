  <title>GASNet networking layer.</title>
  <description>GASNet is a language-independent, low-level networking layer that provides network-independent, high-performance communication primitives tailored for implementing parallel global address space SPMD languages and libraries such as UPC, Co-Array Fortran, SHMEM, Cray Chapel, and Titanium. The interface is primarily intended as a compilation target and for use by runtime library writers (as opposed to end users), and the primary goals are high performance, interface portability, and expressiveness. GASNet stands for &quot;Global-Address Space Networking&quot;. </description>
