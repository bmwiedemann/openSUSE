  <title>Realtime satellite tracking program for GNOME</title>
  <description>Gpredict is a real-time satellite tracking and orbit prediction
application. It can track an unlimited number of satellites and display
their position and other data in lists, tables, maps, and polar plots
(radar view). Gpredict can also predict the time of future passes for a
satellite, and provide you with detailed information about each pass.
