%description
Shakespeare is a family of type-safe, efficient template languages.
Shakespeare templates are expanded at compile-time, ensuring that all
interpolated variables are in scope. Variables are interpolated according to
their type through a typeclass.

Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter or in an external
file.

Note there is no dependency on haskell-src-extras. Instead Shakespeare believes
logic should stay out of templates and has its own minimal Haskell parser.
