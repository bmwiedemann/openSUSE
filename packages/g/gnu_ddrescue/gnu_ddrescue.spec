%description
GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
block device (hard disk, CD-ROM, etc.) to another, trying hard to
rescue data in case of read errors.

It is more memory and time efficient than dd_rescue+dd_rhelp on disks
with more than a few hundred bad sectors.

# not autoconf, but at least it behaves (nearly) like it.
