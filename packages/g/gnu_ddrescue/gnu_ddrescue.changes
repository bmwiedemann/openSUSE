-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 16 18:13:35 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 1.23:
  * A bug has been fixed that sometimes marked the wrong block as
    non-scraped when running in reverse direction>
  * The new option '--same-file' has been added. It allows infile
    and outfile to be the same file or device.
  * The new option '--shift' has been added to ddrescuelog. It
    shifts the positions of all the blocks in 'mapfile' by the
    offset ('--output-position' - '--input-position'), and writes
    the resulting mapfile to standard output.
  * In fill mode, the location data is now written as one line
    without final newline to ease finding it with simple text
    search tools.
  * Fill mode no longer requires a seekable infile. Commands like
    ddrescue -F- <(printf "BAD-SECTOR ") outfile mapfile are now
    possible.
  * The new chapter "Meaning of ddrescue's screen output" has been
    added to the manual.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  6 00:17:55 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.22
  * The -X option now stands for --max-read-errors instead of
    --exit-on-error and therefore requires an argument now.
  * New options: --max-slow-reads, --delay-slow, --reset-slow,
    --log-events, --mapfile-interval, --pause-on-error
  * The option '--pause' has been renamed to '--pause-on-pass'.
  * The option '--max-errors' has been renamed to '--max-bad-areas'.
  * ddrescue now shows the number of read errors, the error rate and
    (if a --min-read-rate is specified) the number of slow reads.
  * The 'current_pass' field has been added to the mapfile. This
    allows the copying phase to resume instead of restart from
    pass 1. It also allows the retrying phase to resume in the
    same direction it was interrupted.
  * (More option changes; see the full changelog in the "NEWS"
    file shipped inside the package.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 19 07:48:21 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.21
  * A bug in the alignment of the I/O buffer has been (hopefully)
    fixed.
  * Ddrescue now exits with status 1 in case of unaligned read in
    direct mode (because of a wrong sector size, for example).
  * Short option names '-1' and '-2' have been removed to avoid
    mistakes in the command line.
  * Only regular files are now allowed as arguments of options
    '--log-rates' and '--log-reads'.
  * Option '-D, --odirect' now works also in fill mode.
  * Option '-J, --verify-on-error' now marks blocks as failed on
    any error, and exits with status 1 if a read error happens
    before a good sector is found.
  * Option '-X, --exit-on-error' has been extended to all phases.
  * The short name '-Z' has been assigned to option
    '--max-read-rate'.
  * The mapfile is now "fsync'ed" every 5 minutes because some
    systems seem to never write the mapfile to disc.
  * Ddrescue now shows all sizes in rescue mode; non-tried,
    non-trimmed, non-scraped, bad-sector and finished.
  * Ddrescue now shows the percentage of the domain rescued in
    rescue mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 11 20:00:37 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.20
* "logfile" has been renamed to "mapfile" everywhere, even in long
  option names. ("--domain-logfile" is now "--domain-mapfile",
  etc).
* The short name of option "--synchronous" has been changed to "-y".
* The long name of option "-d" has been changed to "--idirect".
* The new option "-D, --odirect" has been added. This introduces
  a subtle backward incompatibility because "-D" was the short
  name of option "--synchronous".
* The new option "-J, --verify-on-error" has been added. It
  verifies, after each read error, that the input device is still
  returning consistent data.
* The new option "--max-read-rate" has been added.
* "direct disc access" now can copy arbitrary domains by reading
  whole sectors and writing only the requested part.
* Accounting change; only bad_sector blocks are now included in
  "errsize".
* The estimated remaining rescue time is now shown on the screen.
* Times are now shown in days, hours, minutes and seconds, instead
  of as a fraction of the appropriate unit.
* Fill mode has been extended to write location data into each
  sector.
* An emergency save of the mapfile has been added. It can be
  activated in case of ddrescue having trouble writing the mapfile.
* Device name is now shown with "--ask" or "-vv" on Haiku.
* Read-only mapfiles, like domain mapfiles or input mapfiles for
  ddrescuelog, can now be read from standard input if a hyphen '-'
  is used as mapfile name.
* Ddrescuelog can now show the status of more than one mapfile.
* "ddrescuelog --create-mapfile -" now writes the mapfile to
  standard output.
* The new chapter "Optical media" has been added to the manual.
* The configure option "--enable-linux" has been renamed to
  "--enable-non-posix".
* The targets "install-compress", "install-strip-compress",
  "install-info-compress" and "install-man-compress" have been
  added to the Makefile.
- Update download url

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 11 13:59:40 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.19
* A race condition at start of run with "--timeout=0" has been
  fixed.
* The new option -P (--data-preview) which makes ddrescue show a
  few lines of the latest data read, has been added.
* The new option -u (--unidirectional), which runs all passes in
  the same direction (forwards or backwards), has been added.
* The new option -X (--exit-on-error), which makes ddrescue exit
  after the first read error is encountered during the copying
  phase, has been added.
* New options --ask, --cpass, --pause were added.
* The option -l (--logfile-size) has been removed.
* Ddrescue now skips on the first error during the copying phase.
* Trimming is now done in one pass and may be run in reverse.
* The splitting phase has been replaced by a "scraping" phase that
  scrapes together the data not recovered by the copying or trimming
  phases. Scraping reads each non-scraped block forwards, one sector
  at a time.
* The long name of option "-n" has been changed to "--no-scrape".
* During the retrying phase, the direction is now reversed after
  each pass. Use --unidirectional to override.
* The license has been changed to GPL version 2 or later.
- Remove %gpg_verify; verification is now handled by
  source validator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 12 12:06:50 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.18.1
* A bug has been fixed in the "or" and "xor" operations of
  ddrescuelog.
* New "-H, --test-mode", "-L, --loose-domain", "-N, --no-trim",
  "-O, --reopen-on-error", "-1, --log-rates", and "-2, --log-reads"
  options have been added.
* The "-K, --skip-size" option has been extended.
* If ddrescue is interrupted by a signal, it now terminates by
  raising that signal.
* The algorithm of the copying phase has been changed.
* The "-B, --binary-prefixes", "-C, --complete-logfile", and
  "-P, --compare-as-domain" options have been added to ddrescuelog.
* Many improvements have been made to the documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 16 08:02:33 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.17
* The new options "-l, --logfile-size", and "-w,
  --ignore-write-errors" have been added.
* Trimming is now done from both edges of each non-trimmed block.
* The largest blocks are trimmed first.
* The largest blocks are now split first until logfile reaches
  "--logfile-size" entries. Ddrescue now terminates with an error
  if an unexpected EOF would discard any successfully-read data.
* ddrescue now automatically adjusts the logfile to shrinking input
  devices, like CD-ROMs written in Track-At-Once mode.
* A bug has been fixed which prevented the status from updating
  after the system clock had been put back.
- Optional signature verification on local builds

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 18 22:52:56 UTC 2012 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.16
* The new options "-K, --skip-size" and "-T, --timeout" have been
  added. The short name of option "--try-again" has been changed to
  "-A". Maximum skip size is now limited to 1% of infile size or 1
  GiB (whichever is smaller). The current position is now set to
  the end of the block when reading backwards, allowing perfect
  resumability also in reverse mode. The "-E, --max-error-rate"
  option now checks the rate of actually failed reads, not the
  growth of error size, and shows the error rate in the error
  message. The -v option increases verbosity if repeated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 12 04:59:50 UTC 2012 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.15
* The new options "-a, --min-read-rate", "-I, --verify-input-size",
  and "-x, --extend-outfile" have been added.
* ddrescue now verifies that infile, outfile and logfile are all
  different.
* Non-tried blocks are now read aligned to cluster-size sectors.
* A spurious warning about "-D" being ignored in fill mode has been
  removed.
* ddrescuelog, a tool for manipulation, display, conversion,
  comparison and testing of ddrescue logfiles, has been added.
