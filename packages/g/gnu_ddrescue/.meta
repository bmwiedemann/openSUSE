  <title>Data Copying in the Presence of I/O Errors</title>
  <description>GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to
rescue data in case of read errors.

It is more memory and time efficient than dd_rescue+dd_rhelp on disks
with more than a few hundred bad sectors.
