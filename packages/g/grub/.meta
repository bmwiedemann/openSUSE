  <title>Grand Unified Boot Loader</title>
  <description>GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader. It was derived from GRUB. It is an
attempt to produce a boot loader for IBM PC-compatible machines that
has both the ability to be friendly to beginning or otherwise
nontechnically interested users and the flexibility to help experts in
diverse environments. It is compatible with Free/Net/OpenBSD and Linux.
It supports Win 9x/NT and OS/2 via chainloaders. It has a menu
interface and a command line interface.</description>
