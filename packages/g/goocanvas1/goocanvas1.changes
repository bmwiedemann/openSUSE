Wed Jun  1 17:50:02 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Rename package to goocanvas1 as we will move to the gtk3 version
  of goocanvas in the goocanvas package.
- Rename lang subpackage to libgoocanvas3-lang to avoid any
  confusion (since goocanvas1-lang would have been installed for
  libgoocanvas3).
- Rename devel subpackage to libgoocanvas3-devel for the same
  reason.
- Change Requires for lang subpackage to a Recommends, as the
  translations are not mandatory.
- Do not add explicit Requires for cairo-devel, gtk2-devel,
  pkg-config in the devel subpackage: they will automatically be
  added the pkgconfig() way.
