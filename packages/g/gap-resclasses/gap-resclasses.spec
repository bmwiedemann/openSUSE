%description
ResClasses is a package for set-theoretic computations with residue
classes of the integers and a couple of other rings. The class of
sets which ResClasses can deal with includes the open and the closed
sets in the topology on the respective ring which is induced by
taking the set of all residue classes as a basis, as far as the usual
restrictions imposed by the finiteness of computing resources permit
this.
