- Update to release 4.7.3
  * Fixed some issues where loading ResClasses could
    inadvertently alter the behavior of GAP library functions.
  * Fixed a bug in the 3-argument version of
    'PartitionsIntoResidueClasses': If the length of the
    partitions to be computed was smaller than the biggest prime
    specified in the third argument, the third argument was just
    ignored.
  * Changed IsZ_pi from a property to a category.
  * Remove several internal helper functions.

Sat Feb  3 16:22:42 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.7.1
  * No user-visible changes (only pkg metadata)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 25 15:43:28 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.7.0
  * Several trivial methods for `SparseRep', `StandardRep' and
    `Classes' have been added (these methods are now needed by
    RCWA).
  * A utility function `GetOption' has been added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 29 22:40:04 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.6.0
  * A utility function `LaTeXStringWord' has been added.
  * The method for multiplying the empty list with a matrix has
    been made superfluous and removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 20 08:17:22 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.5.0
* Operations `CoverByResidueClasses` and `CoversByResidueClasses`
  have been introduced, and methods to compute covers of the
  integers by residue classes with prescribed moduli have been
  implemented.
* Utility functions `DrawLineNC` and `AssignGlobalNC` have been
  added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  8 15:40:43 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.4.2
* The undocumented and unused function
  `ResidueClassesIntersectionType` has been removed.
* The utility functions and -operations `DifferencesList`,
  `QuotientsList`, `FloatQuotientsList`, `RandomCombination`,
  `IsCommuting`, `BlankFreeString`, `QuotesStripped` and
  `IntOrInfinityToLaTeX` have been moved to the Utils package.
  Therefore Utils is now a needed package of ResClasses.
* The utility functions and -operations `SaveAsBitmapPicture`,
  `LoadBitmapPicture`, `DrawGrid`, `EquivalenceClasses`,
  `GraphClasses`, `AllGraphs` and `IdGraph` have been moved from
  the RCWA package here, and `IdGraph` has been renamed to
  `IdGraphNC`.
* The operations `PositionsSublist`, `GraphClasses`, `AllGraphs`
  and `IdGraphNC` have been documented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 12 19:45:50 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.1.2
* A class list ("sparse") representation for residue class unions
  has been implemented; this yields an enormous speedup for
  computations with unions of few residue classes some of which
  have big modulus.
* An auxiliary function `LogToDatedFile' has been added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 12 13:01:22 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 3.4.0
* An auxiliary function "NextProbablyPrimeInt" has been added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  7 16:25:54 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 3.3.2
* Removed a potential performance problem in a "ViewString" method
  for polynomials over finite fields.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 10 13:47:02 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Split resclasses (version 3.3.0) off the gap RPM package
