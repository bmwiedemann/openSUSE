  ### 2.14.6 development
  [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/compare/v2.14.5...v2.14.6)
  
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Ensure `any_instance` method stubs and expectations are torn down regardless of
    expectation failures. (Sam Phippen)
  
  ### 2.14.5 / 2014-02-01
  [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/compare/v2.14.4...v2.14.5)
  
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Fix regression that caused block implementations to not receive all
    args on 1.8.7 if the block also receives a block, due to Proc#arity
    reporting `1` no matter how many args the block receives if it
    receives a block, too. (Myron Marston)

Sun Oct 20 12:05:39 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.14.4
 Bug Fixes:
 
 * Fix issue where unstubing methods on "any instances" would not
   remove stubs on existing instances (Jon Rowe)
 * Fix issue with receive(:message) do ... end precedence preventing
   the usage of modifications (`and_return` etc) (Jon Rowe)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 30 18:46:51 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.14.2
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Fix `as_null_object` doubles so that they return `nil` from `to_ary`
    (Jon Rowe).
  * Fix regression in 2.14 that made `stub!` (with an implicit receiver)
    return a test double rather than stub a method (Myron Marston).
  
  ### 2.14.1 / 2013-07-07
  [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/compare/v2.14.0...v2.14.1)
  
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Restore `double.as_null_object` behavior from 2.13 and earlier: a
    double's nullness persisted between examples in earlier examples.
    While this is not an intended use case (test doubles are meant to live
    for only one example), we don't want to break behavior users rely
    on in a minor relase.  This will be deprecated in 2.99 and removed
    in 3.0. (Myron Marston)
  
  ### 2.14.0 / 2013-07-06
  [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/compare/v2.14.0.rc1...v2.14.0)
  
  Enhancements:
  
  * Document test spies in the readme. (Adarsh Pandit)
  * Add an `array_including` matcher. (Sam Phippen)
  * Add a syntax-agnostic API for mocking or stubbing a method. This is
    intended for use by libraries such as rspec-rails that need to mock
    or stub a method, and work regardless of the syntax the user has
    configured (Paul Annesley, Myron Marston and Sam Phippen).
  
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Fix `double` so that it sets up passed stubs correctly regardless of
    the configured syntax (Paul Annesley).
  * Allow a block implementation to be used in combination with
    `and_yield`, `and_raise`, `and_return` or `and_throw`. This got fixed
    in 2.13.1 but failed to get merged into master for the 2.14.0.rc1
    release (Myron Marston).
  * `Marshal.dump` does not unnecessarily duplicate objects when rspec-mocks has
    not been fully initialized. This could cause errors when using `spork` or
    similar preloading gems (Andy Lindeman).

- updated to version 2.12.2

 [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/compare/v2.12.1...v.2.12.2)

 Bug fixes

 * Fix `and_call_original` to work properly for methods defined
   on a module extended onto an object instance (Myron Marston).
 * Fix `stub_const` with an undefined constnat name to work properly
   with constant strings that are prefixed with `::` -- and edge case
   I missed in the bug fix in the 2.12.1 release (Myron Marston).
 * Ensure method visibility on a partial mock is restored after reseting
   method stubs, even on a singleton module (created via `extend self`)
   when the method visibility differs between the instance and singleton
   versions (Andy Lindeman).
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 22 07:30:56 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.12.1
 Bug fixes
 
 * Fix `any_instance` to support `and_call_original`.
   (Myron Marston)
 * Properly restore stubbed aliased methods on rubies
   that report the incorrect owner (Myron Marston and Andy Lindeman).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 13 14:05:18 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.12.0
 Enhancements
 
 * `and_raise` can accept an exception class and message, more closely
   matching `Kernel#raise` (e.g., `foo.stub(:bar).and_raise(RuntimeError, "message")`)
   (Bas Vodde)
 * Add `and_call_original`, which will delegate the message to the
   original method (Myron Marston).
 
 Deprecations:
 
 * Add deprecation warning when using `and_return` with `should_not_receive`
   (Neha Kumari)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 23 09:54:55 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.11.3
 [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/compare/v2.11.2...v2.11.3)
 
 Bug fixes
 
 * Fix `:transfer_nested_constants` option of `stub_const` so that it
   doesn't blow up when there are inherited constants. (Myron Marston)
 * `any_instance` stubs can be used on classes that override `Object#method`.
   (Andy Lindeman)
 * Methods stubbed with `any_instance` are unstubbed after the test finishes.
   (Andy Lindeman)
 * Fix confusing error message when calling a mocked class method an
   extra time with the wrong arguments (Myron Marston).
