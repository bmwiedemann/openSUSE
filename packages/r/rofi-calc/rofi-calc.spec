%description
A rofi plugin that uses libqalculate's qalc to parse natural language
input and provide results.

Since this uses libqalculate's qalc, natural language queries such as
"500 + 25%%" or "5000 EUR to USD" or "150 to hex" can be input.
It can also solve linear equations on the fly, like "60x + 30 = 50"
for instance.
