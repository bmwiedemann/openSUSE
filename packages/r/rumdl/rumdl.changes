Tue Dec 09 06:33:13 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.0.191:
  * Fixed
    - CLI: Handle broken pipe gracefully when piping to head (fixes
      #184)
      - Output to closed pipes (e.g., rumdl check . | head) no
        longer causes error messages
      - SIGPIPE is now handled properly on Unix systems
    - Config: Resolve exclude patterns relative to config file
      location (fixes #185)
      - Exclude patterns like docs/* now resolve relative to the
        project root (config file directory)
      - Previously patterns resolved relative to the current
        working directory, causing them to fail when running from a
        different directory with --config
      - This matches the behavior of Biome, Black, and
        markdownlint-cli2
      - Note: Users running from the project root (the common case)
        are unaffected
    - Docs: Correct build status badge to track release workflow

      - Configuration parsing now correctly defaults to
        case-sensitive path checking
      - Aligns TOML config behavior with programmatic defaults
    - MD022 (blanks-around-headings): Treat HTML comments and
      frontmatter as transparent
      - HTML comments between content and headings no longer
        trigger blank line warnings

        are NOT cell delimiters
      - Tables with inline code containing pipes (e.g., `x | y`) no
        longer trigger false positives
      - GFM flavor behavior unchanged (pipes in code ARE delimiters
        per spec)

        separator style than rest of table
    - Code quality fixes
      - Resolved Issues #151 and #152 with comprehensive test
        coverage

      - Separated 42 integration tests into dedicated test file
        (text_reflow_test.rs)
      - Follows established codebase pattern for test organization
      - Improves maintainability while keeping 1 private helper
        test inline
  * Changed
    - MD029 (ordered-list-prefix): Improved warning messages
      - Messages now include contextual style information
      - Shows both configured style and detected document style for
        clarity

Fri Nov 14 13:23:09 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.0.176:
  * Added
    - Git-style intelligent configuration merging
      - User and project configs can now intelligently combine
        instead of simply overriding
      - disable array uses union semantics - user can add to
        project disables
      - enable array uses replace semantics - project can enforce
        specific rules
      - When a rule appears in both enable and disable, enable wins
        (project can override user)
      - Configuration hierarchy is now explicit and follows Git's
        pattern:
        - Default (0) < UserConfig (1) < PyprojectToml (2) <
          ProjectConfig (3) < CLI (4)
      - Renamed config sources for clarity:
        - ConfigSource::RumdlToml → UserConfig (global user config)
        - ConfigSource::RumdlToml → ProjectConfig (project-level
          config files)
        - Removed Markdownlint source (now uses ProjectConfig)
      - New API methods:
        - SourcedValue::merge_union() - additive merging for
          disable arrays
        - SourcedValue::merge_override() - replacement merging for
          enable arrays
      - Example use cases:
        - User disables MD013 globally → Project enables MD013 →
          MD013 is enabled ✓
        - Project disables MD001, MD003 → User disables MD013 → All
          three are disabled ✓
      - 17 comprehensive tests covering merge semantics,
        precedence, and conflict resolution
      - Matches configuration pattern used by git, eslint,
        prettier, and other modern tools
  * Performance
    - Major memory optimizations eliminating string allocations
      - Converted LineInfo to use byte ranges instead of owned
        strings (50-80% memory reduction)
      - Eliminates N string allocations where N = number of lines
        in document
      - Added zero-copy content(&self, source: &str) -> &str method
        for on-demand access
      - Converted LineIndex to borrow &'a str instead of cloning
        (eliminates one full document copy per lint operation)
      - Converted ParsedLink/ParsedImage to use Cow<'a, str>
        (60-80% reduction in heap allocations for link/image
        parsing)
      - Zero-cost when borrowing, minimal overhead when owning -
        most data borrowed directly from source
    - Eliminated O(n²) complexity in multiple rules
      - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD027 (Multiple spaces after
        blockquote symbol)
      - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD020 (No space inside
        hashes on closed atx style heading)
      - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD046 (Code block style)
      - All three rules now use pre-computed context data with O(1)
        lookups
    - Optimized CLI commands
      - rumdl config now executes in ~18ms (eliminated duplicate
        rule instantiation)
      - Removed duplicate instantiation of ~50 rule objects between
        main.rs and formatter.rs
      - Cleaner architecture with single source of truth for rule
        instances
  * Fixed
    - Config loading: User config now always loaded as base layer
      (#131)
      - Fixed LSP server ignoring user config when finding
        project-level config files
      - User configuration is now always loaded first (unless
        --no-config is used)
      - Project configs merge on top of user config, CLI flags have
        highest priority
      - Configuration hierarchy now consistent between CLI and LSP:
        - User/global config (~/.config/rumdl/rumdl.toml) - base
          layer
        - Project config (discovered or explicit) - overrides user
          config
        - CLI flags - highest priority
      - Matches pattern used by git, eslint, prettier, and other
        tools
      - Added regression test verifying user config preserved with
        explicit project config
    - MD035: Frontmatter delimiter false positives (#40)
      - Fixed incorrect flagging of YAML/TOML frontmatter
        delimiters (---/+++) as horizontal rules
      - Rule now correctly skips frontmatter in three places:
        - most_prevalent_hr_style() - don't count frontmatter HRs
          for prevalence
        - check() - don't flag frontmatter delimiters as violations
        - fix() - don't replace frontmatter delimiters when fixing
      - Uses pre-computed LineInfo.in_front_matter field for
        efficient detection
  * Changed
    - Architecture: Consistent use of pre-computed context data
      - MD035 now uses pre-computed LineInfo.in_front_matter
        instead of function calls
      - All rules now consistently use ctx.line_index for
        line-based operations
      - Eliminates redundant function calls and O(n) scans
      - More efficient with O(1) field access patterns
    - Test infrastructure improvements
      - Implemented dynamic fixture downloading for performance
        tests
      - Test downloads now happen on-demand instead of being
        checked into repository
      - Better handling of large test files for performance
        benchmarking
    - Test quality improvements
      - Corrected ESM block test assertions to match actual MDX
        behavior
      - ESM blocks only exist at TOP of MDX files and end at first
        non-ESM line
      - Tests now assert correct behavior rather than documenting
        implementation quirks
      - Fixed MD033 test assertions to properly validate HTML
        inline rules

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      - MD041 now skips files containing only mdBook preprocessor
        directives (e.g., {{#include file.md}})
      - These composition/routing files are not standalone content
        and don't require headings
      - Eliminates false positives on mdBook include-only files

        options (code_block_line_length, heading_line_length)
      - MD054: Warns about incompatible style/styles options (rumdl
        uses individual boolean flags)
      - Prevents "Unknown option" warnings when importing
        markdownlint configs
      - Added helpful warnings explaining config model differences
    - MD011: Footnote reference false positives (#147)

      - Converted MD003, MD004, MD046, MD048, MD049, MD050, MD055
        from "first-found" to "prevalence-based" logic
      - Rules now count ALL occurrences and enforce the most
        commonly used style

        recommendations)
      - More accurate representation of document's actual style
        intent
      - Better user experience: rules adapt to what you mostly use,
        not just the first instance

        footnote extension spec
      - Implements proper block continuation context tracking for
        footnotes
      - Prevents confusion between actual indented code blocks and
        footnote continuations
      - Example that now works correctly:

          [^1]: First paragraph of footnote.

              Second paragraph (indented, but not a code block).

      - Added 11 specification-based tests ensuring robust footnote
        handling
    - CLI: Differentiate --quiet and --silent flags (#141)
      - --quiet: Shows diagnostics but suppresses progress/summary
        (matches Ruff behavior)
      - --silent: Suppresses all output including diagnostics (exit
        code still reflects violations)
      - Previously both flags behaved identically, hiding all
        output
      - Updated help text to clarify the distinction
    - LSP: Server now respects --config argument (#140)
      - Added proper support for --config flag in rumdl server

        automatically use compact formatting
      - Configurable via max-width setting (0 = inherit from
        MD013's line-length)
      - Generates informative warnings showing actual width vs
        threshold
      - Disabled by default (opt-in feature)

      - Now extracts directly from source bytes between brackets
        for perfect fidelity
      - Verified: [\nNewline\n](url) → text correctly preserved
        with newlines

      - Added FixMode enum for clear fix/check mode distinction
      - Improved code maintainability and type safety
  * Changed
    - BREAKING: MD013 tables default changed to false
      - Previously defaulted to true, causing conflicts with table
        formatting rules
      - Now defaults to false for better user experience
      - Migration: If you rely on MD013 checking table line
        lengths, add to .rumdl.toml:
          [MD013]
          tables = true
      - This prevents false positives when using MD060 or other
        table formatting tools
- Update to version 0.0.170:
  * Added
    - Include non-standard file extensions (#127)
      - New --include CLI flag to check files with non-standard

      - Follows Unix philosophy: do one thing (fix pipes) well
      - Example: | Cell 1   | Cell 2 → | Cell 1   | Cell 2 |
        (spacing preserved)
    - MD053: Allow backtick references with :: and spaces (#128)
      - Fixed false positives for Rust-style references like

  * Fixed
    - MD040: Always preserve indentation when adding language tags
      (fixes #122)
      - The MD040 rule was incorrectly removing indentation from
        code blocks when adding language tags
      - This broke list structure when code blocks were part of
        list items
      - Root cause: The fix logic had conditional behavior that
        would remove indentation for "standalone" code blocks
      - Now always preserves original indentation regardless of
        context
      - Removed 50+ lines of unnecessary is_in_nested_context()
        helper logic

        line_length setting
      - Now warns about single sentences exceeding configured
        line_length
      - No auto-fix for long single sentences (requires manual
        rephrasing)
      - Still auto-fixes multi-sentence lines by splitting on
        sentence boundaries
      - Cleaned up warning messages by removing verbose
        parentheticals
      - Maintains semantic integrity (won't split mid-sentence)
        while respecting configured line_length
    - HTML Comments: Complete fix to ignore all content inside HTML
      comments (fixes #119, #20)
      - All rules now properly ignore content within HTML comment
        blocks (<!-- ... -->)
      - Added in_html_comment field to LineInfo for comprehensive
        tracking
      - Extended filtered lines API with skip_html_comments()
        method
      - Updated MD013, MD049, and other rules to skip HTML comment
        content
      - Prevents false positives from commented-out markdown
        (MD013, MD049, MD005, MD006, MD039, MD042)
      - Better handling of multi-line HTML comments across all
        linting rules
    - MD046: Resolve false positives from Issue #118
      - Fixed incorrect flagging of valid code block syntax
      - Improved code block style detection accuracy
    - MD050: Resolve false positives from Issue #118
      - Fixed incorrect strong style detection in edge cases
      - Better handling of emphasis patterns
    - Tests: Fixed sentence_per_line_detection test assertion
      - Updated test to match simplified warning message from MD013
      - Test was expecting verbose message after message was
        simplified in earlier commit
- Update to version 0.0.162:
  * Added
    - Filtered Line Iterator Architecture: New infrastructure for
      rule implementation
      - Provides consistent interface for filtering out front
        matter, code blocks, and HTML blocks
      - Eliminates manual context checking in individual rules
      - Improves code maintainability and reduces duplication
      - Enables easier implementation of new rules
  * Fixed
    - MD052: Skip code blocks in blockquotes when checking
      references
      - Prevents false positives for reference syntax inside code
        blocks within blockquotes
      - Properly handles nested markdown structures
    - MD034: Skip URLs in front matter
      - URLs in YAML/TOML/JSON front matter no longer flagged as
        bare URLs
      - Improves compatibility with static site generators
    - Tests: Fixed flaky profiling::tests::test_concurrent_access
      test
      - Added #[serial_test::serial] attribute to prevent race
        conditions
      - Ensures reliable test execution in CI/CD environments
    - Documentation: Build badge now displays correctly
  * Performance
    - MD005: Optimized continuation detection from O(n²) to O(n)
      - Dramatically faster processing of documents with many list
        items
      - Eliminates redundant line scanning
    - General: Consolidated multiple line_info() calls for same
      line
      - Reduced redundant lookups across multiple rules
      - Improved overall linting performance
  * Changed
    - Internal Refactoring: Eliminated manual checks across all
      rules
      - Removed manual front matter detection from individual rules
      - Removed manual code block detection from individual rules
      - Removed manual HTML block detection from individual rules
      - All rules now use centralized filtering infrastructure
  * Documentation
    - Per-File-Ignores: Added comprehensive documentation for
      per-file-ignores feature
      - Detailed usage examples with glob patterns
      - Integration with both .rumdl.toml and pyproject.toml
