Mon Feb 16 12:04:02 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.1.22:
  * Added
    - Config: Per-directory configuration resolution — place
      .rumdl.toml in subdirectories to override settings for
      specific paths
    - MD075: New rule to detect orphaned table rows and headerless
      pipe content (#426)
  * Fixed
    - MD041: Support TOML (+++) and JSON ({}) front-matter formats
      alongside YAML when checking for title field (#427, thanks
      @Nathan-Furnal)
    - MD054: Match warning message with rule configuration option
      (thanks @eread in #421)
    - Style config: All style configuration values now use
      kebab-case as the canonical format and accept snake_case,
      kebab-case, and uppercase variants.  Affected rules: MD003,
      MD046, MD048, MD049, MD050, MD055, MD060, MD063 (#428, thanks
      @eread)
    - Config: Fix root detection and cross-file rule resolution for
      per-directory configs
    - MD075: Harden orphaned-table detection edge cases

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 16 05:57:30 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.1.21:
  * Added
    - CLI: New full output format with ruff-style source line
      display showing
    - offending lines with caret underlines
    - (#425)
    - GitHub Action: Add generic args input for passing extra CLI
      flags like
    - --output-format json
    - (#406)
    - MD060: loose-last-column now caps last column width at header
      text width —
    - body cells shorter than header are padded, longer cells
      extend beyond
    - (#424)
  * Changed
    - CLI: --output-format help text now documents all available
      formats with
    - descriptions (#425)
  * Fixed
    - CI: SchemaStore sync workflow now formats schema with
      Prettier before
    - committing

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 14 08:29:01 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.1.20:
  * Added
    - Config: Add extends key for config file inheritance — config
      files can declare a base config to inherit from, with child
      settings merging on top.  Supports relative paths, absolute
      paths, ~/ expansion, recursive chains (up to 10 levels), and
      circular reference detection. Works in both .rumdl.toml and
      pyproject.toml (#390)
    - Code block tools: Detect fenced code blocks inside MkDocs
      admonitions and tab containers (#423)
  * Fixed
    - MD013: Detect mkdocstrings autodoc blocks regardless of
      flavor setting (#396)
    - MD013: Enforce strict line-length limit in
      semantic-line-breaks merge (#414)
    - MD060: Detect misaligned content in center/right-aligned
      table columns (#426)
  * Changed
    - Config: disable now uses replace semantics (matching Ruff's
      ignore), giving extend-disable a distinct purpose as the
      additive variant that survives CLI overrides. Document the
      rule selection model with extend-enable / extend-disable in
      global settings

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 13 06:21:55 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.1.19:
  * Added
    - Kramdown flavor: Add kramdown/Jekyll markdown flavor support
      with block IAL ({:.class}, {:#id}), span IAL, and extension
      block ({::comment}, {::nomarkdown}, {::options}) detection.
      Enable with flavor = "kramdown" or flavor = "jekyll". MD041
      skips IALs and extension blocks as preamble; MD051 defaults
      to kramdown anchor style
    - Config: Add extend-enable and extend-disable global config
      keys for additive rule activation, following Ruff's
      extend-select pattern.  Five rules are now opt-in by default:
      MD060, MD063, MD072, MD073, MD074.  Use extend-enable =
      ["MD060"] to enable individual opt-in rules without
      overriding the full enable list
  * Fixed
    - MD013: Prevent reflow from splitting autolinks
      (<https://...>) at the colon in URL schemes by treating them
      as atomic elements (#416, #417)
    - MD013: Prevent reflow from splitting inside markdown link
      text, code spans, and HTML tag attributes by tracking element
      byte spans during word-wrap fallback (#412, #413)
    - MD013: Thread length-mode (chars/visual/bytes) through all
      reflow length calculations so CJK and other wide characters
      are measured correctly (#414)
    - MD013: Abbreviations like e.g. and i.e. inside parentheses no
      longer trigger false sentence boundary detection in
      sentence-per-line mode (#422)
    - MkDocs: Track fenced code blocks inside admonitions to
      prevent false in_code_block overrides that caused reflow
      corruption (#415)
    - MD060: Fix table formatter idempotency bug where ATX headings
      containing pipe characters were misidentified as table rows
      and reformatted Kramdown: Fix self-closing extension blocks
      ({::options ... /}) incorrectly disabling linting for all
      subsequent lines
    - Kramdown: Fix extension fence leakage causing MD022 false
      positives
  * Changed
    - Kramdown: Add three-layer architectural filtering for
      extension blocks (LineInfo sanitization, collection
      filtering, warning pipeline safety net) so rules
      automatically skip kramdown extension blocks without per-rule
      opt-in

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 11 05:57:53 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.1.18:
  * Added
    - Config: enable = ["ALL"] keyword to explicitly enable all
      rules (equivalent to omitting enable), with disable still
      applied on top
    - MD013: In non-strict mode, suppress line-length warnings when
      the excess comes entirely from inline link/image URLs — if
      replacing [text](url) with
    - [text] would bring the line within the limit, the warning is
      not raised (#393)
    - MD057: compact-paths config option to warn about unnecessary
      path traversal in wiki links (e.g., ../sibling when sibling
      suffices) (#391)
  * Changed
    - Config: enable = [] now means "no rules enabled" (was
      incorrectly treated as "use defaults"). Omitting enable still
      enables all rules.  Use enable = ["ALL"] to explicitly enable
      all rules.
  * Fixed
    - MD013: Skip mkdocstrings autodoc blocks (::: module.Class
      with indented YAML options) during paragraph reflow (#396)
    - MD013: Implement trailing-word replacement for non-strict
      mode — reflow now correctly handles lines where the last word
      pushes past the limit
    - MD044: Skip proper name checking when link text is itself a
      URL (starts with http://, https://, or www.), matching
      markdownlint behavior (#395)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 10 05:51:52 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.1.17:
  * Fixed
    - Config: enable = [] is now correctly treated as "disable all
      rules" instead
    - of being silently ignored
    - MD013: Preserve MkDocs admonition markers (!!!, ???, ???+)
      during text
    - reflow instead of stripping them from continuation lines
    - MD033: Escape regex special characters in allowed-elements
      config values —
    - square brackets and other metacharacters were being
      interpreted as regex patterns
    - MD036: Only flag emphasis as heading-like when it forms a
      standalone paragraph
    - (surrounded by blank lines), matching markdownlint behavior
  * Changed
    - MD045: Made diagnostic-only — auto-fix removed because
      meaningful alt text
    - requires human judgment. Automated placeholders derived from
      filenames (e.g.,
    - "User Profile image") are harmful for accessibility. The rule
      now reports missing
    - alt text without offering to fix it.
    - CI: Pass version in pre-commit dispatch payload
  * - Update to version 0.1.16:
  * Added
    - MD013: semantic-line-breaks reflow mode (preview) — breaks
      lines at semantic
    - boundaries using a cascading strategy: sentence boundaries
      first, then clause
    - punctuation (, ; : —), then English break-words (and, or,
      but,
    - which, that, because, etc.), then word wrap as fallback
    - (#388)
  * Fixed
    - MD013: Fix panic on multi-byte characters (smart quotes, em
      dashes) in
    - semantic line break sentence boundary detection
    - MD013: Preserve element adjacency during reflow — text
      directly adjacent
    - to shortcodes, code spans, or links (e.g., v{{< shortcode
      >}}) is no longer
    - split across lines
    - MD013: Use actual line length instead of URL-stripped length
      for line-length
    - checks — lines were incorrectly passing when long URLs
      inflated the real length
    - MD013: Preserve Quarto/Pandoc div markers (::: {.class})
      during text reflow
    - instead of reflowing them into surrounding paragraphs
    - MD001: Track fixed heading level in check() for idempotent
      fixes — repeated
    - --fix runs no longer produce different output for multi-level
      heading violations
    - MD032: Idempotent fix for ordered non-1 list followed by
      unordered list
    - MD032: Use fix() method in proptest and allow convergence
      within 3 passes
    - MD062: Bail out when unmatched angle bracket masks closing
      paren, preventing
    - false positive warnings on valid link syntax
    - MD009: Strip all trailing Unicode whitespace in a single pass
      instead of
    - handling each whitespace character separately
    - GitHub Action: Support multiple space-separated file paths in
      path input
    - docs: Fix YAML typo, indentation, and --no-exclude
      descriptions
    - (thanks @JonathanWillitts in #385)
    - config: Handle markdownlint default key and boolean rule
      semantics in
    - .markdownlint.json compatibility
    - (#389)
  * Changed
    - reflow: Extract block boundary helpers to deduplicate
      paragraph detection logic
    - MD001: Extract compute_heading_fix() to unify check() and
      fix() code paths
    - docs: Add Helix editor formatter configuration and note about
      built-in support
    - docs: Add link and nav validation guide, fix MD051 cross-file
      documentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 09 06:35:21 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

      - Replace per-line HashMap cloning in InlineConfig with
        state-transition storage
      - Deduplicate content.lines().collect() across 48 call sites

        context construction
      - Add O(1) line access via pre-computed line starts in
        LineIndex
      - Lazy-initialize rule registry with LazyLock (eliminated 5+
        redundant all_rules() calls)
      - Remove unused mmap code path from file reading
  * Changed
    - explain command completeness - Now uses the full rule
      registry instead of
    - a manually maintained list, ensuring all rules (including
      MD069-MD074) are included
  * - Update to version 0.1.15:
  * Added
    - MD074: MkDocs nav validation - Validate that mkdocs.yml
      navigation entries
    - point to existing files (requires flavor = "mkdocs")
      - not-found = "warn" (default): Report nav entries pointing
        to non-existent files
      - omitted-files = "ignore" (default): Optionally report
        markdown files not in nav

        absolute paths
      - Smart handling of directory nav entries, docs_dir setting,
        and session caching
    - MD057: Absolute links configuration - New absolute-links
      config option
    - for controlling how absolute link paths are handled
    - MkDocs flavor: Extension-aware support - Recognize
      Python-Markdown and
    - pymdown-extensions syntax to prevent false positives
      - Python-Markdown anchor style ({#custom-id} header
        attributes)
      - Unified PyMdown markup detection with span-based
        architecture
  * Fixed
    - Tables in list items lose indentation (#383)
      - rumdl fmt now preserves indentation for tables on list
        continuation lines
      - Stack-based list context tracking handles nested lists,
        mixed ordered/unordered,
      - and respects CommonMark code block boundaries
    - MD065: Fix idempotency for consecutive horizontal rules -
      Running --fix
    - twice on consecutive --- rules no longer produces different
      output
    - MD032: Fix idempotency for ordered-non-1 items with code
      fences - Fix mode

Mon Feb 02 05:45:46 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.1.9:
  * Fixed
    - MD033: Don't remove HTML tags that can't be converted to
      Markdown
      - Previously, auto-fix would destructively remove tags like
        <img>, <span>, and <div>
      - Now only safe fixable tags (em, i, strong, b, code, br, hr)
        are converted
      - All other HTML tags are left unchanged as expected

      - Added 197 tests across 20 modules for MkDocs flavor
      - Covers admonitions, content tabs, mkdocstrings, keys,
        snippets, math, and more
      - Tests edge cases, cross-flavor comparison, fix
        preservation, and malformed syntax

- Update to version 0.0.216:
  * Added
    - MD072: Custom key order for frontmatter sorting (fixes #290)
      - New key-order config option to define preferred key
        ordering
      - Keys in the order list appear first, unlisted keys sort
        alphabetically after
      - Example: key-order = ["title", "date", "author"] puts title
        first
  * Fixed
    - MD060: Preserve blockquote prefix when formatting tables
      - Tables inside blockquotes (e.g., > | A | B |) now correctly
        preserve the prefix
      - Supports nested blockquotes (>>, >>>) with proper prefix
        preservation
      - Works with all formatting styles (aligned, compact, tight)
    - MD057: Skip link patterns inside LaTeX math spans (fixes
      #289)
      - Link-like patterns inside $...$ or $$...$$ are no longer
        flagged as broken links
      - Prevents false positives from LaTeX commands that resemble
        markdown links
    - MD030: Skip empty marker lines without content (fixes #288)
      - Lines with only a list marker (no content) are now skipped
      - Prevents incorrect warnings about spacing on empty list
        items
    - MD031/MD032/MD058/MD065: Auto-fix preserves nested blockquote
      prefix (fixes #268)
      - When inserting blank lines in blockquotes, the blockquote
        prefix is now preserved
      - Works correctly with nested blockquotes (>>, >>>)
      - Blank blockquote lines use > without trailing space (per
        markdownlint-cli)
    - MD005/MD007: Prevent oscillation between rules
      - Ordered and unordered list items are now tracked in
        separate groups
      - Fixes cases where MD005 and MD007 would fight over
        indentation
- Update to version 0.0.215:
  * Fixed
    - MD057: Exclude footnote definitions from relative link
      checking (fixes #286)
      - Footnote definitions ([^id]: content) were incorrectly
        parsed as reference link definitions
      - This caused MD057 to treat footnote content as URLs (e.g.,
        [^1]: [link](https://example.com) was flagged as broken
        link)
      - Footnotes are now correctly identified and excluded from
        reference definition parsing
      - Also benefits MD053 (unused reference definitions) which
        uses the same parsing
    - MD005: Auto-fix preserves blockquote prefix (fixes #268)
      - When fixing list indentation inside blockquotes, the >
        prefix is now preserved
      - Previously, auto-fix could break blockquote structure
- Update to version 0.0.214:
  * Added
    - Per-file flavor configuration (fixes #283)
      - Configure different markdown flavors for specific file
        patterns using glob patterns
      - Example: "docs/**/*.md" = "gfm" in [global.file-flavors]
        section
      - Supports all flavor values: commonmark, gfm, mkdocs,
        obsidian, mdbook
      - File patterns are matched against relative paths from
        project root
  * Fixed
    - MD028: Skip GFM alerts when checking blank lines in
      blockquotes (fixes #126)
      - GFM alerts (> [!NOTE], > [!TIP], > [!IMPORTANT], >
        [!WARNING], > [!CAUTION]) require blank line separation to
        render correctly
      - MD028 now detects GFM alerts and allows blank lines between
        them
      - Case-insensitive detection supports both [!NOTE] and
        [!note]
      - Regular blockquotes between GFM alerts are still flagged
        correctly
    - MD032: Auto-fix handles varying blockquote whitespace (fixes
      #268)
      - Auto-fix no longer breaks blockquote structure when lines
        have different spacing
      - Properly handles mixed > and > prefixes within the same
        blockquote
    - MD032: Detect blockquotes before skip conditions (fixes #284,
      #285)
      - Blockquote detection now runs first, preventing false
        positives inside blockquotes
      - Fixes cases where multi-paragraph list items in blockquotes
        triggered warnings
- Update to version 0.0.213:
  * Fixed
    - MD031/MD046: Detect code blocks inside lists (fixes #276)
      - MD031 with list-items=true now correctly flags fenced code
        blocks inside lists
      - MD046 with style=fenced now correctly flags indented code
        blocks inside lists
      - Uses pulldown-cmark for accurate CommonMark-compliant code
        block detection
      - Properly distinguishes between code blocks and
        footnote/admonition/tab content
    - MD057: Check reference-style link definitions for broken
      links (fixes #274)
      - Reference-style link definitions like [ref]: ./path.md are
        now checked
      - Previously only inline links [text](./path.md) were
        validated
      - All existing validations apply: external URLs skipped,
        .html→.md fallback, URL decoding
    - MD007: "Do What I Mean" behavior for indent configuration
      (fixes #273)
      - When indent is explicitly set without style, automatically
        use fixed style
      - Setting indent = 4 now actually uses 4-space increments as
        expected
      - Warning shown if both indent and style = "text-aligned" are
        set (contradictory)
    - MD030: Prevent false positives in math blocks (fixes #275)
      - Math blocks ($$...$$) are now detected and excluded from
        list marker spacing checks
      - Fixes incorrect warnings about list spacing inside LaTeX
        display math
- Update to version 0.0.212:
  * Added
    - CLI: Show relative file paths in output by default (fixes
      #266)
      - Add --show-full-path flag to opt into absolute paths
      - All output formats (text, JSON, SARIF, GitHub, GitLab,
        JUnit) now consistently use paths relative to project root
        or CWD
  * Fixed
    - LSP: Respect FormattingOptions in formatting handler (fixes
      #265)
      - insertFinalNewline: Add trailing newline if missing
      - trimFinalNewlines: Remove extra trailing newlines at EOF
      - trimTrailingWhitespace: Remove trailing whitespace from all
        lines
      - Applies FormattingOptions after lint fixes to match editor
        preferences
    - Fix coordinator: Re-check all rules after each fix for
      idempotency (fixes #271)
      - rumdl check --fix now produces idempotent results
      - After each fix, all rules are re-checked with fresh
        LintContext
      - Handles cascading fixes (e.g., MD046 → MD040) in a single
        run
    - MD046: Preserve code indentation and skip MkDocs admonitions
      (fixes #269, #270)
      - Converting fenced to indented code blocks now preserves
        internal indentation
      - MkDocs admonitions (!!! note, ??? warning, ???+ tip) are
        properly skipped
    - MD012: Fix EOF blank line removal in LSP formatting (fixes
      #264)
      - Warning's fix replacement now correctly removes blank lines
        at EOF

      - Use line-based reordering to preserve original YAML
        formatting
      - Fixed config warning about "unknown option: enabled"
      - Compute fix in check() to enable LSP formatting
- Update to version 0.0.211:
  * Fixed
    - MD032: Handle blockquote continuation lines correctly (fixes
      #260)
      - Blockquote continuation lines within the same blockquote
        level no longer incorrectly trigger "list should be
        surrounded by blank lines" warnings
      - Changed detection from checking if line starts with > to
        comparing blockquote nesting levels
      - Lists inside blockquotes like > - item\n>   continuation
        now lint correctly
    - MD071: Preserve trailing newlines when fixing frontmatter
      spacing (fixes #262)
      - Auto-fix no longer removes the file's trailing newline
      - Prevents MD047 (files should end with newline) from
        triggering after MD071 fix
  * Changed
    - Rules: Add aliases for MD070, MD071, MD072

      - IAL syntax like {: .class #id} immediately after headings
        no longer triggers blank line warnings
      - IAL lines are treated as part of the heading element
      - Multiple consecutive IAL lines supported
      - Fix function preserves IAL attachment to headings

        key extraction
- Update to version 0.0.209:
  * Added
    - MD070: Nested code fence collision detection (new rule)
      - Detects when inner code fences would prematurely close
        outer fences
      - Example: outer '```' containing inner '```' causes collision
      - Suggests using longer fences ('````') for outer blocks
      - Configurable languages option to limit checking to specific
        info strings (default: ["", "markdown", "md"])
      - Auto-fix increases fence length to prevent collisions
  * Fixed
    - MD040: Fix false positives on list-indented code blocks
      (fixes #257)

        code block detection
      - List-indented closing fences no longer incorrectly flagged
        as missing language

      - Added respect-gitignore option to [global] section in
        .rumdl.toml and pyproject.toml
      - CLI flag --respect-gitignore=false syntax now works
        (previously only --no-respect-gitignore)
    - Release: Fix pre-built aarch64-linux binaries for 16K page
      systems (fixes #256)

      - Resolves LSP formatting infinite loop (adding trailing
        space → MD009 → removing space → MD030)
      - Added 16 comprehensive edge case tests covering citations,
        blockquoted lists, URLs, ISBNs, and mathematical
        expressions
    - Heading detection: Prevent list items from being detected as
      setext headings (fixes #254)
      - Per CommonMark spec 4.3, setext heading content cannot be a
        list item, ATX heading, blockquote, thematic break, code
        fence, or HTML block
      - Incomplete list items (e.g., - Orange followed by -) no
        longer incorrectly detected as level 2 headings

        regardless of actual severity level
      - JSON/JSON Lines/Azure formatters now correctly output
        "error", "warning", or "info" based on actual severity
- Update to version 0.0.208:
  * Changed
    - Reflow: Replace manual emphasis parsing with pulldown-cmark
      - Use pulldown-cmark for CommonMark-compliant emphasis, bold,

        boundary detection
  * Fixed
    - Reflow: Continue emphasis markers across sentence splits
      (fixes #251)
      - When splitting emphasized text at sentence boundaries, each
        line now properly retains its emphasis markers
      - Example: *Sentence one. Sentence two.* now correctly splits
        to *Sentence one.* and *Sentence two.*
    - Reflow: Fix line_length=0 to mean "no wrapping"
      - Previously line_length=0 would wrap after every word due to
        condition always being true
      - Now correctly treats 0 as "unlimited line length" (no
        wrapping)
    - MD007: Resolve false positives on nested unordered lists in
      ordered lists (fixes #247)
      - Nested unordered lists inside ordered lists now calculate
        expected indent based on parent's content column
      - Fixes ping-pong bug where MD007 fix would then trigger
        MD005, destroying nesting structure

        longer trigger bare URL warnings
      - URLs inside parentheses with descriptions are properly
        handled
    - MD037: Mask inline math spans before emphasis detection
      - Asterisks inside inline math ($p * q$) no longer interfere
        with emphasis detection
      - Fixes false negatives where valid * spaced emphasis * was
        not detected
    - MD051: URL-decode CJK fragments before anchor matching
      - Japanese, Korean, and Chinese heading fragments are now
        properly matched
      - URL-encoded fragments (e.g., #%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E)
        correctly resolve to decoded anchors
    - MD057: Resolve false positives for email addresses and file
      references

        single run
      - Options: commonmark, gfm (GitHub Flavored Markdown)
      - Useful for testing files against different markdown
        specifications
  * Fixed
    - MD029: Respect CommonMark list start values and preserve user
      intent (fixes #247)
      - Ordered lists starting at values other than 1 (e.g., 11.,
        12., 13.) are now validated correctly
      - Auto-fix no longer destroys user intent by changing 11. to
        1. in properly numbered lists
      - Lists with start attribute > 1 will warn but not auto-fix,
        preserving semantic numbering
    - WASM: Convert byte-based columns to character offsets for
      JavaScript
      - Column positions in WASM output now use character offsets
        instead of byte offsets
      - Fixes incorrect highlighting in editors when files contain
        multi-byte UTF-8 characters
  * Changed
    - Docs: Add mise as an installation option

      (fixes #241)
      - Inline configuration (e.g., <!--
        markdownlint-configure-file {"MD013": {"tables": false}}
        -->) was not being applied when files had short lines
      - The should_skip optimization now uses effective config
        after parsing inline overrides
    - CLI: Warn about unknown rules in --enable/--disable flags
      (fixes #243)
      - Using non-existent rule names now produces a warning
        instead of silently ignoring them
      - Invalid rules in all config entry points (CLI flags, config
        files) are now validated
    - MD034: Fix panic with multi-byte URLs and unbalanced
      parentheses
      - URLs containing non-ASCII characters (e.g., Chinese
        Wikipedia URLs) followed by unbalanced parentheses no
        longer cause a panic

  * Downloads
- Update to version 0.0.203:
  * Added
    - Config: Implement Ruff-style config inheritance model
      - User config (~/.config/rumdl/) now serves as base, project
        config extends it
      - Project-level enable/disable are additive to user config by
        default

  * Fixed
    - MD057/MD051: Skip wikilinks in cross-file validation (fixes
      #235)
      - Wikilinks ([[page]]) were incorrectly triggering "relative
        link does not exist" warnings
      - Wikilinks use a different linking system (Obsidian, etc.)
        and should not be validated as file paths
    - MD057: Fix LSP diagnostic position for cross-file links
      (fixes #234)
      - LSP was pointing to link text [...] instead of URL (...)
      - Now correctly highlights the URL portion in editor
        diagnostics
    - MD012: Remove all trailing blank lines at EOF
      - Previously only removed one trailing blank line per fix
        pass
      - Now removes all consecutive trailing blank lines in a

Tue Dec 09 06:33:13 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.0.191:
  * Fixed
    - CLI: Handle broken pipe gracefully when piping to head (fixes
      #184)
      - Output to closed pipes (e.g., rumdl check . | head) no
        longer causes error messages
      - SIGPIPE is now handled properly on Unix systems
    - Config: Resolve exclude patterns relative to config file
      location (fixes #185)
      - Exclude patterns like docs/* now resolve relative to the
        project root (config file directory)
      - Previously patterns resolved relative to the current
        working directory, causing them to fail when running from a
        different directory with --config
      - This matches the behavior of Biome, Black, and
        markdownlint-cli2
      - Note: Users running from the project root (the common case)
        are unaffected

    - MD061 (link-destination-exists): Default case_sensitive to
      true when loading from TOML
      - Configuration parsing now correctly defaults to
        case-sensitive path checking
      - Aligns TOML config behavior with programmatic defaults
    - MD022 (blanks-around-headings): Treat HTML comments and
      frontmatter as transparent
      - HTML comments between content and headings no longer
        trigger blank line warnings
      - Frontmatter is now invisible to blank line checking around

        LintContext
      - These methods were never used but could cause performance
        issues if called in loops
  * Added
    - Comprehensive regression tests for list block parsing
      - 27 new tests covering edge cases: consecutive items,
        list-breaking content, indentation rules
      - Performance tests verify O(n) scaling for 1000+ item lists

        Setext styles
      - Ensures consistent style detection across all test runs
    - MD044 (proper-names): Added international character support
      - Added tilde characters (ã, õ) and Nordic å to ASCII
        normalization
      - Enables proper name matching for international cities like
        São Paulo, Coimbra, and Århus
    - MD013 (line-length): Fixed infinite hang in sentence-per-line

        certain text patterns
    - Table style detection improvements
      - MD055/MD056/MD058: Now analyze all table rows to detect
        style, not just first row
      - Prevents false positives when first row has different
        separator style than rest of table
    - Code quality fixes
      - Resolved Issues #151 and #152 with comprehensive test
        coverage
      - Eliminated code duplication in MD005, MD042, and other
        rules
      - Extracted shared helper methods to reduce maintenance
        burden
  * Added
    - MD013: Comprehensive abbreviation detection tests
      - 42 test cases covering sentence-per-line reflow edge cases
      - Validates correct behavior for abbreviations, acronyms, and
        punctuation patterns
    - Text reflow test organization
      - Separated 42 integration tests into dedicated test file
        (text_reflow_test.rs)
      - Follows established codebase pattern for test organization
      - Improves maintainability while keeping 1 private helper
        test inline
  * Changed
    - MD029 (ordered-list-prefix): Improved warning messages
      - Messages now include contextual style information
      - Shows both configured style and detected document style for
        clarity
      - Examples: "configured style 'one'" vs "document style
        'ordered'"
    - MD029 rule name standardization
      - Removed deprecated MD029-style suffix variant
      - Unified to single consistent "MD029" identifier across

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 14 13:23:09 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.0.176:
  * Added
    - Git-style intelligent configuration merging
      - User and project configs can now intelligently combine
        instead of simply overriding
      - disable array uses union semantics - user can add to
        project disables
      - enable array uses replace semantics - project can enforce
        specific rules
      - When a rule appears in both enable and disable, enable wins
        (project can override user)
      - Configuration hierarchy is now explicit and follows Git's
        pattern:
        - Default (0) < UserConfig (1) < PyprojectToml (2) <
          ProjectConfig (3) < CLI (4)
      - Renamed config sources for clarity:
        - ConfigSource::RumdlToml → UserConfig (global user config)
        - ConfigSource::RumdlToml → ProjectConfig (project-level
          config files)
        - Removed Markdownlint source (now uses ProjectConfig)
      - New API methods:
        - SourcedValue::merge_union() - additive merging for
          disable arrays
        - SourcedValue::merge_override() - replacement merging for
          enable arrays
      - Example use cases:
        - User disables MD013 globally → Project enables MD013 →
          MD013 is enabled ✓
        - Project disables MD001, MD003 → User disables MD013 → All
          three are disabled ✓
      - 17 comprehensive tests covering merge semantics,
        precedence, and conflict resolution
      - Matches configuration pattern used by git, eslint,
        prettier, and other modern tools
  * Performance
    - Major memory optimizations eliminating string allocations
      - Converted LineInfo to use byte ranges instead of owned
        strings (50-80% memory reduction)
      - Eliminates N string allocations where N = number of lines
        in document
      - Added zero-copy content(&self, source: &str) -> &str method
        for on-demand access
      - Converted LineIndex to borrow &'a str instead of cloning
        (eliminates one full document copy per lint operation)
      - Converted ParsedLink/ParsedImage to use Cow<'a, str>
        (60-80% reduction in heap allocations for link/image
        parsing)
      - Zero-cost when borrowing, minimal overhead when owning -
        most data borrowed directly from source
    - Eliminated O(n²) complexity in multiple rules
      - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD027 (Multiple spaces after
        blockquote symbol)
      - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD020 (No space inside
        hashes on closed atx style heading)
      - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD046 (Code block style)
      - All three rules now use pre-computed context data with O(1)
        lookups
    - Optimized CLI commands
      - rumdl config now executes in ~18ms (eliminated duplicate
        rule instantiation)
      - Removed duplicate instantiation of ~50 rule objects between
        main.rs and formatter.rs
      - Cleaner architecture with single source of truth for rule
        instances
  * Fixed
    - Config loading: User config now always loaded as base layer
      (#131)
      - Fixed LSP server ignoring user config when finding
        project-level config files
      - User configuration is now always loaded first (unless
        --no-config is used)
      - Project configs merge on top of user config, CLI flags have
        highest priority
      - Configuration hierarchy now consistent between CLI and LSP:
        - User/global config (~/.config/rumdl/rumdl.toml) - base
          layer
        - Project config (discovered or explicit) - overrides user
          config
        - CLI flags - highest priority
      - Matches pattern used by git, eslint, prettier, and other
        tools
      - Added regression test verifying user config preserved with
        explicit project config
    - MD035: Frontmatter delimiter false positives (#40)
      - Fixed incorrect flagging of YAML/TOML frontmatter
        delimiters (---/+++) as horizontal rules
      - Rule now correctly skips frontmatter in three places:
        - most_prevalent_hr_style() - don't count frontmatter HRs
          for prevalence
        - check() - don't flag frontmatter delimiters as violations
        - fix() - don't replace frontmatter delimiters when fixing
      - Uses pre-computed LineInfo.in_front_matter field for
        efficient detection
  * Changed
    - Architecture: Consistent use of pre-computed context data
      - MD035 now uses pre-computed LineInfo.in_front_matter
        instead of function calls
      - All rules now consistently use ctx.line_index for
        line-based operations
      - Eliminates redundant function calls and O(n) scans
      - More efficient with O(1) field access patterns
    - Test infrastructure improvements
      - Implemented dynamic fixture downloading for performance
        tests
      - Test downloads now happen on-demand instead of being
        checked into repository
      - Better handling of large test files for performance
        benchmarking
    - Test quality improvements
      - Corrected ESM block test assertions to match actual MDX
        behavior
      - ESM blocks only exist at TOP of MDX files and end at first
        non-ESM line
      - Tests now assert correct behavior rather than documenting
        implementation quirks
      - Fixed MD033 test assertions to properly validate HTML
        inline rules

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      - MD041 now skips files containing only mdBook preprocessor
        directives (e.g., {{#include file.md}})
      - These composition/routing files are not standalone content
        and don't require headings
      - Eliminates false positives on mdBook include-only files

      - rumdl import now correctly maps markdownlint-specific
        option names to rumdl equivalents
      - MD013: Maps stern → strict, warns about incompatible
        options (code_block_line_length, heading_line_length)
      - MD054: Warns about incompatible style/styles options (rumdl
        uses individual boolean flags)
      - Prevents "Unknown option" warnings when importing
        markdownlint configs
      - Added helpful warnings explaining config model differences
    - MD011: Footnote reference false positives (#147)

        [link](url)[^footnote]
      - MD011 now skips footnote references (starting with ^)
      - Already had support for reference links, now extended to
        footnotes

        support
      - Added backward compatibility aliases for snake_case field
        names
      - Now properly supports both front-matter-title and
        front_matter_title
      - Removed undocumented config options from MD032 and MD038
    - MD004: Simplified configuration
      - Refactored to use derives instead of manual implementation

      - Converted MD003, MD004, MD046, MD048, MD049, MD050, MD055
        from "first-found" to "prevalence-based" logic
      - Rules now count ALL occurrences and enforce the most
        commonly used style
      - Tie-breakers prefer industry standards (GitHub, CommonMark
        recommendations)
      - More accurate representation of document's actual style
        intent
      - Better user experience: rules adapt to what you mostly use,
        not just the first instance

        - MD049 (emphasis-style): asterisk vs underscore
        - MD050 (strong-style): asterisk vs underscore
        - MD055 (table-pipe-style): leading/trailing pipe
          consistency
      - Updated documentation to reflect prevalence-based behavior

        footnote extension spec
      - Implements proper block continuation context tracking for
        footnotes
      - Prevents confusion between actual indented code blocks and
        footnote continuations
      - Example that now works correctly:

          [^1]: First paragraph of footnote.

              Second paragraph (indented, but not a code block).

      - Added 11 specification-based tests ensuring robust footnote
        handling
    - CLI: Differentiate --quiet and --silent flags (#141)
      - --quiet: Shows diagnostics but suppresses progress/summary
        (matches Ruff behavior)
      - --silent: Suppresses all output including diagnostics (exit
        code still reflects violations)
      - Previously both flags behaved identically, hiding all
        output
      - Updated help text to clarify the distinction
    - LSP: Server now respects --config argument (#140)
      - Added proper support for --config flag in rumdl server
        command

      - Auto-compact threshold: Tables exceeding max-width
        automatically use compact formatting
      - Configurable via max-width setting (0 = inherit from
        MD013's line-length)
      - Generates informative warnings showing actual width vs
        threshold
      - Disabled by default (opt-in feature)

      - Implemented proper GitHub anchor generation with ASCII
        normalization
      - Handles edge cases like backtick-wrapped angle brackets:
        `<FILE>` → #file
      - Verified against actual GitHub.com rendering behavior
    - MD052: Complete Jinja template support
      - Added Jinja template range checks to regex-based shortcut
        reference detection

        image alt text
      - pulldown-cmark strips newlines from Text events, causing
        whitespace loss
      - Now extracts directly from source bytes between brackets
        for perfect fidelity
      - Verified: [\nNewline\n](url) → text correctly preserved
        with newlines

  * Fixed
    - MD040: Always preserve indentation when adding language tags
      (fixes #122)
      - The MD040 rule was incorrectly removing indentation from
        code blocks when adding language tags
      - This broke list structure when code blocks were part of
        list items
      - Root cause: The fix logic had conditional behavior that
        would remove indentation for "standalone" code blocks
      - Now always preserves original indentation regardless of
        context
      - Removed 50+ lines of unnecessary is_in_nested_context()
        helper logic

        Option<String> for proper serialization
    - Cache Parallelization: Cache now works correctly with
      parallel processing
      - No mutex contention during parallel file processing
      - All output formats benefit from caching (previously only
        JSON/GitLab/SARIF/JUnit)
  * Performance
    - Single file with cache: 943ms → 7ms (135x faster)
    - Multi-file (21 files) cold cache: 14.4s → 4s (parallel
      processing)
    - Multi-file (21 files) warm cache: 14.4s → 0.019s (757x
      faster!)
    - JSON format (17 files) with cache: 13.9s → 60ms (231x faster)
- Update to version 0.0.163:
  * Changed
    - MD024: Default siblings_only to true for better usability
      - Multiple headings with same text now only flagged if
        they're direct siblings
      - Reduces false positives in documents with common section
        headings
      - More intuitive default behavior matching common use cases
  * Fixed
    - MD013: Enforce line length in sentence_per_line mode (fixes
      #111)
      - Previously, sentence_per_line mode completely ignored
        line_length setting
      - Now warns about single sentences exceeding configured
        line_length
      - No auto-fix for long single sentences (requires manual
        rephrasing)
      - Still auto-fixes multi-sentence lines by splitting on
        sentence boundaries
      - Cleaned up warning messages by removing verbose
        parentheticals
      - Maintains semantic integrity (won't split mid-sentence)
        while respecting configured line_length
    - HTML Comments: Complete fix to ignore all content inside HTML
      comments (fixes #119, #20)
      - All rules now properly ignore content within HTML comment
        blocks (<!-- ... -->)
      - Added in_html_comment field to LineInfo for comprehensive
        tracking
      - Extended filtered lines API with skip_html_comments()
        method
      - Updated MD013, MD049, and other rules to skip HTML comment
        content
      - Prevents false positives from commented-out markdown
        (MD013, MD049, MD005, MD006, MD039, MD042)
      - Better handling of multi-line HTML comments across all
        linting rules
    - MD046: Resolve false positives from Issue #118
      - Fixed incorrect flagging of valid code block syntax
      - Improved code block style detection accuracy
    - MD050: Resolve false positives from Issue #118
      - Fixed incorrect strong style detection in edge cases
      - Better handling of emphasis patterns
    - Tests: Fixed sentence_per_line_detection test assertion
      - Updated test to match simplified warning message from MD013
      - Test was expecting verbose message after message was
        simplified in earlier commit
- Update to version 0.0.162:
  * Added
    - Filtered Line Iterator Architecture: New infrastructure for
      rule implementation
      - Provides consistent interface for filtering out front
        matter, code blocks, and HTML blocks
      - Eliminates manual context checking in individual rules
      - Improves code maintainability and reduces duplication
      - Enables easier implementation of new rules
  * Fixed
    - MD052: Skip code blocks in blockquotes when checking
      references
      - Prevents false positives for reference syntax inside code
        blocks within blockquotes
      - Properly handles nested markdown structures
    - MD034: Skip URLs in front matter
      - URLs in YAML/TOML/JSON front matter no longer flagged as
        bare URLs
      - Improves compatibility with static site generators
    - Tests: Fixed flaky profiling::tests::test_concurrent_access
      test
      - Added #[serial_test::serial] attribute to prevent race
        conditions
      - Ensures reliable test execution in CI/CD environments
    - Documentation: Build badge now displays correctly
  * Performance
    - MD005: Optimized continuation detection from O(n²) to O(n)
      - Dramatically faster processing of documents with many list
        items
      - Eliminates redundant line scanning
    - General: Consolidated multiple line_info() calls for same
      line
      - Reduced redundant lookups across multiple rules
      - Improved overall linting performance
  * Changed
    - Internal Refactoring: Eliminated manual checks across all
      rules
      - Removed manual front matter detection from individual rules
      - Removed manual code block detection from individual rules
      - Removed manual HTML block detection from individual rules
      - All rules now use centralized filtering infrastructure
  * Documentation
    - Per-File-Ignores: Added comprehensive documentation for
      per-file-ignores feature
      - Detailed usage examples with glob patterns
      - Integration with both .rumdl.toml and pyproject.toml
