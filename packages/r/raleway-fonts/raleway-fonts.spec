%description
Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, designed by Matt McInerney, 
initially in a single Thin weight. It is a display face that features 
both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, 
a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as stylistic alternates 
inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than it's neo-grotesque 
inspired default character set.

The Impallariâ€“Fuenzalida derivative extends the Raleway font family
into a full set of 9 weights with true italics and expanded character
set support for all 104 Latin languages.
