  * Ensure default option/argument is not erroneously aliased.
  * Fixes a bug in the calculation of the print_wrapped method.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 20 04:28:59 UTC 2019 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.0.1

  * Fix thor when `thor/base` and `thor/group` are required without `thor.rb`.
  * Handle relative source path in `create_link`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 14 00:31:01 UTC 2019 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.0.0

  * Drop support to Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.
  * Deprecate relying on default `exit_on_failure?`.
    In preparation to make Thor commands exit when there is a failure we are deprecating
    defining a command without defining what behavior is expected when there is a failure.

    To fix the deprecation you need to define a class method called `exit_on_failure?` returning

    `false` if you want the current behavior or `true` if you want the new behavior.
  * Deprecate defining an option with the default value using a different type as defined in the option.
  * Allow options to be repeatable. See #674.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 12 17:49:13 UTC 2018 - mschnitzer@suse.com

- updated to version 0.20.3

  * Support old versions of `did_you_mean`.

  # from version 0.20.2
  * Fix `did_you_mean` support.

  # from version 0.20.1
  * Support new versions fo ERB.
  * Fix `check_unknown_options!` to not check the content that was not parsed, i.e. after a `--` or after the first unknown with `stop_on_unknown_option!`
  * Add `did_you_mean` support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 21 06:00:39 UTC 2017 - mschnitzer@suse.com

- updated to version 0.20.0
  * Add check_default_type! to check if the default value of an option
    matches the defined type. It removes the warning on usage and gives
    the command authors the possibility to check for programming errors.
  * Add disable_required_check! to disable check for required options in
    some commands. It is a substitute of disable_class_options that was
    not working as intended.
  * Add inject_into_module.
