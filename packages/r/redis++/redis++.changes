  Add cmake options to disable building static lib or shared lib.
  Used here since only shared library is packaged.
- use_shared_lib_for_test.patch
  Link against shared libraries provided by hiredis package.
- custom_install_locations.patch
  Provide CMake options for custom library and header file locations.
  For example lib64 on x86_64 and lib on i586.
