- update to 0.12.0:
  * NEW: views::chunk_by which, like the old views::group_by it replaces,
  * splits a range into a range-of-ranges, where adjacent elements satisfy a binary
  * predicate (#1648). [Note: Whereas views::group_by evaluated the predicate
  * between the current element and the first element in the chunk, views::chunk_by
  * evaluates the predicate between adjacent elements. -- end note]
  * NEW: constexpr all the algorithms that are constexpr in C++20's std::ranges
  * NEW: Fold algorithms from P2322
  * NEW: ranges::unformatted_ostream_iterator
  * NEW: Support for the build2 build system
  * Implement P2328: relax the constraint on ranges::join_view
  * to support joining ranges of prvalue non-view ranges
  * Improved algorithm for ranges::linear_distribute
  * Renamed safe_subrange_t to borrowed_subrange_t
  * Extend ranges::to to support conversion to container-of-containers
  * views::enumerate can be a borrowed_view
  * ranges::upper_bound works in the presence of overloaded operator&
  * Input iterators are no longer required to be default-constructible
  * Bug fixes
- drop fix-install.patch: upstream
