%description
The Rivet project (Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and
Theory) is a toolkit for validation of Monte Carlo event generators.
It provides a large (and ever growing) set of experimental analyses
useful for MC generator development, validation, and tuning, as well
as a convenient infrastructure for adding your own analyses. Rivet is
the most widespread way by which analysis code from the LHC and other
high-energy collider experiments is preserved for comparison to and
development of future theory models.
