  * Fixes to CMS_2016_I1487288 jet selection and normalisation.
  * Improve Vector3::azimuthalAngle() (also used by FourMomentum
    and FourVector) to use exact rather than fuzzy is-zero check,

    IEEE floating point implementations of atan2 should already be
    'safe' unless we decide that this function should throw or

    functions as wanting a conversion to use std::function.
  * Add super-generic (i)discardIfAny(particlebases,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  9 16:03:53 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

  * Long long list of changes: see
    %{_docdir}/%{name}-devel/ChangeLog.
- Rebase sover.diff for updated version.

    the devel package.
  * Move plugins to %{_libdir}/Rivet-plugins directory
  * Install an ld.so.conf file so that the plugins are found when
    compiling against them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 09:20:42 UTC 2018 - guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org

- Add _constraints file to avoid OOM build failures

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 31 22:19:11 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

  HepMC-devel >= 3 yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 23 20:25:55 UTC 2017 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.5.4:
  * Fix 8 TeV DY (ATLAS_2016_I1467454), EL/MU bits were bissing.
  * Add 13 TeV DY (ATLAS_2017_I1514251) and mark
    ATLAS_2015_CONF_2015_041 obsolete.
  * Add missing install statement for
    ATLAS_2016_I1448301.yoda/plot/info leading to segfault.
  * Slight improvements to Particle constructors.
  * Improvement to Beam projection: before falling back to
    barcodes 1 & 2, try a manual search for status=4 particles.
    Based on a patch from Andrii Verbytskyi.
  * Add CMS_2016_I1430892: dilepton channel ttbar charge asymmetry
    analysis.

    8 TeV.
  * Add ATLAS_2016_I1426515, WW production at 8 TeV.
  * Add BELLE measurement of semileptonic B0bar -> D*+ ell nu
    decays. I took the liberty to correct the data in the sense
    that I take the bin widths into account in the normalisation.
    BELLE_2017_I1512299.
    This is a nice analysis as it probes the hadronic and the
    leptonic side of the decay so very valuable for model building
    and of course it is rare as it is an unfolded B measurement.
  * Add ALEPH measurement of hadronic tau decays,
    ALEPH_2014_I1267648.
  * Add ALEPH dimuon invariant mass (OS and SS) analysis,
    ALEPH_2016_I1492968.

    transverse momentum charged particle and charged-particle jet.
  * Add CMS_2015_I1370682_PARTON, a partonic-top version of the CMS
    7 TeV pseudotop ttbar differential cross-section analysis.
  * Adding EHS_1988_I265504 from Felix Riehn: charged-particle
    production in K+ p, pi+ p and pp interactions at 250 GeV/c.
  * Fix ALICE_2012_I1116147 for pi0 and Lambda feed-down.
  * Add protection against leptons from QED FSR photon conversions
    in assigning PartonicTop decay modes. Thanks to Markus Seidel
    for the report and suggested fix.
  * Reimplement FastJets methods in terms of new static helper
    functions.
  * Add new mkClusterInputs, mkJet and mkJets static methods to
    FastJets, to help with direct calls to FastJet where particle
    lookup for constituents and ghost tags are required.
  * Fix Doxygen config and Makefile target to allow working with
    out-of-source builds. Thanks to Christian Holm Christensen.

    JADE_1983_I190818, PLUTO_1980_I154270, TASSO_1989_I277658,
    TPC_1987_I235694 for charged multiplicity in e+e- at CMS
    energies below the Z pole.
  * Added 2 analyses for charged multiplicity at the Z pole
    DELPHI_1991_I301657, OPAL_1992_I321190.
  * Updated ALEPH_1991_S2435284 to plot the average charged
    multiplicity.
  * Added analyses OPAL_2004_I631361, OPAL_2004_I631361_qq,
    OPAL_2004_I648738 for gluon jets in e+e-, most need fictitious
    e+e- > g g process.

    analyses as validated, since their cutflows match the
    documentation.
  * Add aggregate signal regions to CMS_2016_PAS_SUS_16_14.
  * Add getEnvParam function, for neater use of environment
    variable parameters with a required default.
  * Add HasBTag and HasCTag jet functors, with lower-case aliases.
  * Use std::function in functor-expanded method signatures on
    JetAlg.
  * Convert FinalState particles() accessors to use std::function
    rather than a template arg for sorting, and add filtering
    functor support -- including a mix of filtering and sorting
    functors. Yay for C++11!
  * Add ParticleEffFilter and JetEffFilter constructors from a
    double (encoding constant efficiency).
  * Add Vector3::abseta().
- Changes from version 2.5.3:
  * Add cut in BZ calculation in OPAL 4 jet analysis. Paper is not
    clear about treatment of parallel vectors, leads to division by
    zero and nan-fill and subsequent YODA RangeError
    (OPAL_2001_S4553896).
  * Fix bugs in SmearedJets treatment of b & c tagging rates.
  * Adding ATLAS_2016_I1467454 analysis (high-mass Drell-Yan at 8

    CMS_2016_I1459051 (inclusive jet cross-sections at 13 TeV) and
    CMS_PAS_FSQ_12_020 (preliminary 7 TeV leading-track underlying
    event).
  * Adding CDF_2015_1388868 (ppbar underlying event at 300, 900,
    and 1960 GeV).
  * Adding ATLAS_2016_I1467230 (13 TeV min bias),
    ATLAS_2016_I1468167 (13 TeV inelastic pp cross-section), and
    ATLAS_2016_I1479760 (7 TeV pp double-parton scattering with 4
    jets).

    ATLAS_2011_I929691 (7 TeV jet frag).
  * Fix bash bugs in rivet-buildplugin, including fixing the --cmd
    mode.
  * Add LHC Run 2 BSM analyses ATLAS_2016_CONF_2016_037 (3-lepton
    and same-sign 2-lepton), ATLAS_2016_CONF_2016_054 (1-lepton +
    jets), ATLAS_2016_CONF_2016_078 (ICHEP jets + MET),
    ATLAS_2016_CONF_2016_094 (1-lepton + many jets),
    CMS_2013_I1223519 (alphaT + b-jets), and CMS_2016_PAS_SUS_16_14
    (jets + MET).
  * Provide convenience reversed-argument versions of apply and
    declare methods, to allow presentational choice of declare
    syntax in situations where the projection argument is very
    long, and reduce requirements on the user's memory since this
    is one situation in Rivet where there is no 'most natural'
    ordering choice.
  * Adding pTvec() function to 4-vectors and ParticleBase.
  * Fix --pwd option of the rivet script
  * Add weights and scaling to Cutflow/s.
  * Add Et(const ParticleBase&) unbound function.
  * Fix missing YAML quote mark in rivet-mkanalysis.
  * Fix constness requirements on ifilter_select() and
    Particle/JetEffFilter::operator().
  * src/Analyses/ATLAS_2016_I1458270.cc: Fix inverted particle
    efficiency filtering.
  * Add rough ATLAS and CMS photon reco efficiency functions from
    Delphes (ATLAS and CMS versions are identical, hmmm).
  * Tidying/fixing make-plots custom z-ticks code. Thanks to Dmitry
    Kalinkin.
  * Fix SpiresID -> InspireID in some analyses (show-analysis
    pointed to non-existing web page).
  * Add Luminosity_fb to AnalysisInfo.
  * Added some keywords and Lumi to ATLAS_2016_I1458270.
  * Merge the ATLAS and CMS from-Delphes electron and muon tracking
    efficiency functions into generic trkeff functions -- this is
    how it should be.

  * Add eta and pT cuts to ATLAS truth b-jet definition.
  * Use rounding rather than truncation in Cutflow percentage
    efficiency printing.

  * Add isFirstWith(out), isLastWith(out) functions, and functor
    wrappers, using Cut and templated function/functor args.
  * Add Particle::parent() method.
  * Add using import/typedef of HepMC *Ptr types (useful step for
    HepMC 2.07 and 3.00).
  * Various typo fixes (and canonical renaming) in
    ParticleBaseUtils functor collection.
  * Add ATLAS MV2c10 and MV2c20 b-tagging effs to
    SmearingFunctions.hh collection.
  * Add a PartonicTops projection.
  * Add overloaded versions of the Event::allParticles() method
    with selection Cut or templated selection function arguments.
  * Add rapidity scheme arg to DeltaR functor constructors.
  * Provide an Analysis::bookCounter(d,x,y, title) function, for
    convenience and making the mkanalysis template valid.
  * Improve container utils functions, and provide combined
    remove_if+erase filter_* functions for both select- and
    discard-type selector functions.
  * Bugfix in rivet-mkhtml (NoneType: ana.spiresID() --> spiresid)
  * Added <numeric> include to Rivet/Tools/Utils.h to make gcc6
    happy
  * Add efffilt() functions and Particle/JetEffFilt functors to
    SmearingFunctions.hh
  * Adding filterBy methods for Particle and Jet which accept
    generic boolean functions as well as the Cut specialisation.
  * Add a Jet::particles(Cut&) method, for inline filtering of jet
    constituents.
  * Add 'conjugate' behaviours to container head and tail functions
    via negative length arg values.
  * Add convenience headers for including all final-state and
    smearing projections, to save user typing.
  * Add standard MET functions for ATLAS R1 (and currently copies
    for R2 and CMS).
  * Add lots of vector/container helpers for e.g. container slicing,
    summing, and min/max calculation.
  * Adapt SmearedMET to take *two* arguments, since SET is typically
    used to calculate MET resolution.
  * Adding functors for computing vector & ParticleBase differences
    w.r.t. another vector.
  * Implemented a few more cuts in prompt photon analysis
    (CDF_1993_S2742446) but to no avail, the rise of the data towards
    larger costheta values cannot be reproduced --- maybe this is a
    candidate for more scrutiny and using the boosting machinery such that
    the c.m. cuts can be done in a non-approximate way
  * Rename CDF_2009_S8383952 to CDF_2009_I856131 due to invalid Spires
    entry.
  * Add InspireID to all analysis known by their Spires key
- Even longer list of changes for version 2.2.1 through 2.5.1; see
  ChangeLog file.
- Drop upstream incorporated or otherwise fixed patches:
  * Rivet-compatibility-with-old-boost.patch.
  * 0001-fix_YODA_Histo1D_includes.patch.
  * Rivet-boost-configure-for-GCC5.patch.

Thu Jun 25 05:45:33 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add Rivet-boost-configure-for-GCC5.patch to fix autoconf
  boost macros lookup with GCC5; patch taken from boost.m4
  upstream [https://github.com/tsuna/boost.m4].

Sun Oct 26 04:40:31 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.2.0:
  + Mark Jet::containsBottom and Jet::containsCharm as deprecated
    methods: use the new methods. Analyses updated.
  + Add Jet::bTagged(), Jet::cTagged() and Jet::tauTagged() as
    ghost-assoc-based replacements for the 'contains' tagging methods.
  + Adding support for 1D and 3D YODA scatters, and helper methods
    for calling the efficiency, asymm and 2D histo divide functions.
  + Adding 5 new ATLAS analyses:
    - ATLAS_2011_I921594: Inclusive isolated prompt photon
      analysis with full 2010 LHC data
    - ATLAS_2013_I1263495: Inclusive isolated prompt photon
      analysis with 2011 LHC data
    - ATLAS_2014_I1279489: Measurements of electroweak production
      of dijets + $Z$ boson, and distributions sensitive to vector
      boson fusion
    - ATLAS_2014_I1282441: The differential production cross
      section of the $\phi(1020)$ meson in $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV $pp$
      collisions measured with the ATLAS detector
    - ATLAS_2014_I1298811: Leading jet underlying event at 7 TeV
      in ATLAS
  + Adding a median(vector<NUM>) function and fixing the other stats
    functions to operate on vector<NUM> rather than vector<int>.
  + Fix wrong behaviour of LorentzTransform with a null boost
    vector
  + Add calc() methods to Hemispheres as requested, to allow it to
    be used with Jet or FourMomentum inputs outside the normal
    projection system.
  + Improvements to the particles methods on
    ParticleFinder/FinalState, in particular adding the range of
    cuts arguments cf. JetAlg (and tweaking the sorted jets
    equivalent) and returning as a copy rather than a reference if
    cut/sorted to avoid accidentally messing up the cached copy.
  + Creating ParticleFinder projection base class, and moving
    Particles-accessing methods from FinalState into it.
  + Adding basic forms of MC_ELECTRONS, MC_MUONS, and MC_TAUS
    analyses.
- Changes from 2.2.0Beta:
  + See /usr/share/doc/packages/Rivet-devel/ChangeLog for full
    list.
- Packaging changes:
  + Rebase patch 0001-fix_YODA_Histo1D_includes.patch for current
    version; includes dropping the 2nd hunk since it is already
    incorporated upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 25 18:18:21 UTC 2014 - sfalken@opensuse.org

- Added 0001-fix_YODA_Histo1D_includes.patch
  fixed buildfailure due to YODA/Histo1D changing function names 
  Additionally fixed buildfailure from MAXINT being defined but not used
  See https://www.hepforge.org/lists-archive/rivet/2014-September/005167.html

Sat Jun 21 22:16:44 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.1.2:
  + Lots of changes since previous version (2.0.0), see
    ChangeLog file in /usr/share/doc/packages/Rivet-devel/ for a
    full list
- Packaging changes:
  + Add Rivet-compatibility-with-old-boost.patch: fix foreach
    compatibility with boost < 1.50 and make Rivet build with
    openSUSE 12.3 again
  + Now requires YODA-devel >= 1.0.6 for building
  + Package new pkgconfig file (.pc file manually stripped of
    rpaths to avoid linking issues, and an rpmlint warning)
  + Also strip rpath from rivet-config script.
