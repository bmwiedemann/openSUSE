  * Add variations on the discard/select utility functions to
    (particularly) discard single elements by equality rather than
    needing to provide a function.

  * Provide an implicit cast for FourVector and derived classes to
    PseudoJet, to avoid the incorrect conversion by PJ's template
    constructor.

    self-consistency of output file.
  * Replace regex_match with reg_search to pick up substring
    matches, too.

    the wrong decay chain was checked for weak decays.
  * Change configure script to use the --rpath=no option to
    fastjet-config, removing fragile path-hacking.
    build script.

    form, into an uncompiled analyses/examples/ directory.
  * Hide the bundled eigen3 in a mangled RivetEigen namespace, to
    avoid clashes.
  * Submission of CMS_2022_I2079374: Z pT over a wide mass range

    pdfmerge for making a booklet.
  * fix indentation in MC_MUONS.info
  * add per-file print out to rivet-merge
  * support keyboard interruption in rivet-merge
  * Correction to use xE rather than xP in OPAL_1997_S3396100, by

    runs to 3.1.x.
  * Add a --no-downloads flag to rivet-mkanalysis.

  * Add bare-lepton origin position to DressedLepton constructors.
  * Add aspace() and l/rpad() utility functions.
  * Rename the little-used in-place sortBy() functions to
    isortBy() cf. ifilter() and friends, since the behaviour
    should not change wildly just based on the constness status of

    private method on the HepMC2 WeightContainer, for robust and
    correctly ordered weight name acquisition before HepMC
    2.06.11.
  * Allow several AnalysisHandler objects to run in different
    threads. This is a temporary fix. A permanent fix involves

  * Fixes to CMS_2016_I1487288 jet selection and normalisation.
  * Improve Vector3::azimuthalAngle() (also used by FourMomentum
    and FourVector) to use exact rather than fuzzy is-zero check,

  * Plugins are unversioned; the need to depend on the version of
    the devel package.
  * Move plugins to %{_libdir}/Rivet-plugins directory
  * Install an ld.so.conf file so that the plugins are found when
    compiling against them.

Fri Mar 23 09:20:42 UTC 2018 - guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org

- Add _constraints file to avoid OOM build failures

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 31 22:19:11 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Build with HepMC2-devel, since Rivet does not compile with
  HepMC-devel >= 3 yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 23 20:25:55 UTC 2017 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.5.4:
  * Fix 8 TeV DY (ATLAS_2016_I1467454), EL/MU bits were bissing.
  * Add 13 TeV DY (ATLAS_2017_I1514251) and mark
    ATLAS_2015_CONF_2015_041 obsolete.
  * Add missing install statement for
    ATLAS_2016_I1448301.yoda/plot/info leading to segfault.
  * Slight improvements to Particle constructors.
  * Improvement to Beam projection: before falling back to
    barcodes 1 & 2, try a manual search for status=4 particles.
    Based on a patch from Andrii Verbytskyi.
  * Add CMS_2016_I1430892: dilepton channel ttbar charge asymmetry
    analysis.
  * Add CMS_2016_I1413748: dilepton channel ttbar spin
    correlations and polarisation analysis.
  * Add CMS_2017_I1518399: leading jet mass for boosted top

    decays. I took the liberty to correct the data in the sense
    that I take the bin widths into account in the normalisation.
    BELLE_2017_I1512299.
    This is a nice analysis as it probes the hadronic and the
    leptonic side of the decay so very valuable for model building
    and of course it is rare as it is an unfolded B measurement.
  * Add ALEPH measurement of hadronic tau decays,
    ALEPH_2014_I1267648.
  * Add ALEPH dimuon invariant mass (OS and SS) analysis,
    ALEPH_2016_I1492968.

    MC_JetAnalysis.
  * Fix compiler complaints about uninitialised variable in
    OPAL_2004.

    WWW cross-section at 8 TeV.
  * Add ATLAS_2016_I1449082, charge asymmetry in top quark pair
    production in dilepton channel.

    transverse momentum charged particle and charged-particle jet.
  * Add CMS_2015_I1370682_PARTON, a partonic-top version of the CMS
    7 TeV pseudotop ttbar differential cross-section analysis.
  * Adding EHS_1988_I265504 from Felix Riehn: charged-particle
    production in K+ p, pi+ p and pp interactions at 250 GeV/c.
  * Fix ALICE_2012_I1116147 for pi0 and Lambda feed-down.
  * Add protection against leptons from QED FSR photon conversions
    in assigning PartonicTop decay modes. Thanks to Markus Seidel
    for the report and suggested fix.
  * Reimplement FastJets methods in terms of new static helper
    functions.
  * Add new mkClusterInputs, mkJet and mkJets static methods to
    FastJets, to help with direct calls to FastJet where particle
    lookup for constituents and ghost tags are required.
  * Fix Doxygen config and Makefile target to allow working with
    out-of-source builds. Thanks to Christian Holm Christensen.
  * Improve DISLepton for HERA analyses: thanks to Andrii

    TPC_1987_I235694 for charged multiplicity in e+e- at CMS
    energies below the Z pole.
  * Added 2 analyses for charged multiplicity at the Z pole
    DELPHI_1991_I301657, OPAL_1992_I321190.
  * Updated ALEPH_1991_S2435284 to plot the average charged
    multiplicity.
  * Added analyses OPAL_2004_I631361, OPAL_2004_I631361_qq,
    OPAL_2004_I648738 for gluon jets in e+e-, most need fictitious
    e+e- > g g process.
  * Add Cut and functor selection args to HeavyHadrons accessor
    methods.
  * bin/rivet-mkanalysis: Add FastJets.hh include by default --
    it's almost always used.
  * src/Analyses/CMS_2016_I1473674.cc: Patch from CMS to use
    partonic tops.

    analyses as validated, since their cutflows match the
    documentation.
  * Add aggregate signal regions to CMS_2016_PAS_SUS_16_14.
  * Add getEnvParam function, for neater use of environment
    variable parameters with a required default.
  * Add HasBTag and HasCTag jet functors, with lower-case aliases.
  * Use std::function in functor-expanded method signatures on
    JetAlg.
  * Convert FinalState particles() accessors to use std::function
    rather than a template arg for sorting, and add filtering
    functor support -- including a mix of filtering and sorting
    functors. Yay for C++11!
  * Add ParticleEffFilter and JetEffFilter constructors from a
    double (encoding constant efficiency).
  * Add Vector3::abseta().
- Changes from version 2.5.3:
  * Add cut in BZ calculation in OPAL 4 jet analysis. Paper is not
    clear about treatment of parallel vectors, leads to division by

    (OPAL_2001_S4553896).
  * Fix bugs in SmearedJets treatment of b & c tagging rates.
  * Adding ATLAS_2016_I1467454 analysis (high-mass Drell-Yan at 8

    LHCB_2014_I1262703 (Z+jet at 7 TeV).
  * Adding leading dijet mass plots to MC_JetAnalysis (and all
    derived classes). Thanks to Chris Gutschow!
  * Adding CMS_2012_I1298807 (ZZ cross-section at 8 TeV),
    CMS_2016_I1459051 (inclusive jet cross-sections at 13 TeV) and
    CMS_PAS_FSQ_12_020 (preliminary 7 TeV leading-track underlying
    event).
  * Adding CDF_2015_1388868 (ppbar underlying event at 300, 900,
    and 1960 GeV).
  * Adding ATLAS_2016_I1467230 (13 TeV min bias),
    ATLAS_2016_I1468167 (13 TeV inelastic pp cross-section), and
    ATLAS_2016_I1479760 (7 TeV pp double-parton scattering with 4
    jets).
  * Adding ALICE_2012_I1116147 (eta and pi0 pTs and ratio) and
    ATLAS_2011_I929691 (7 TeV jet frag).
  * Fix bash bugs in rivet-buildplugin, including fixing the --cmd
    mode.

    jets), ATLAS_2016_CONF_2016_078 (ICHEP jets + MET),
    ATLAS_2016_CONF_2016_094 (1-lepton + many jets),
    CMS_2013_I1223519 (alphaT + b-jets), and CMS_2016_PAS_SUS_16_14
    (jets + MET).
  * Provide convenience reversed-argument versions of apply and
    declare methods, to allow presentational choice of declare
    syntax in situations where the projection argument is very
    long, and reduce requirements on the user's memory since this
    is one situation in Rivet where there is no 'most natural'
    ordering choice.
  * Adding pTvec() function to 4-vectors and ParticleBase.
  * Fix --pwd option of the rivet script
  * Add weights and scaling to Cutflow/s.
  * Add Et(const ParticleBase&) unbound function.
  * Fix missing YAML quote mark in rivet-mkanalysis.
  * Fix constness requirements on ifilter_select() and
    Particle/JetEffFilter::operator().
  * src/Analyses/ATLAS_2016_I1458270.cc: Fix inverted particle
    efficiency filtering.

    Delphes (ATLAS and CMS versions are identical, hmmm).
  * Tidying/fixing make-plots custom z-ticks code. Thanks to Dmitry
    Kalinkin.

  * Added some keywords and Lumi to ATLAS_2016_I1458270.
  * Merge the ATLAS and CMS from-Delphes electron and muon tracking

  * Add eta and pT cuts to ATLAS truth b-jet definition.
  * Use rounding rather than truncation in Cutflow percentage
    efficiency printing.

    candidate for more scrutiny and using the boosting machinery such that
    the c.m. cuts can be done in a non-approximate way

    ParticleFinder/FinalState, in particular adding the range of
    cuts arguments cf. JetAlg (and tweaking the sorted jets
