Sun Oct 23 18:41:35 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.1.7:
  * Add HEPTopTagger interface (since made optional, with no-build
    example analysis).
  * Add EXAMPLE_NTUPLE_ROOT example analysis showing how to open
    and write to a ROOT ntuple file.

  * Add EXAMPLE_LWTNN example analysis, demonstrating use of a
    preserved LWTNN neural network in Rivet.
  * Install more generically named files from the analysis
    plugin/data dirs rather than limiting to the .plot, .info,
    .yoda* set.
  * Move EXAMPLE_* analyses, which demonstrate functionality to
    analysis writers rather than being directly useful in compiled
    form, into an uncompiled analyses/examples/ directory.
  * Hide the bundled eigen3 in a mangled RivetEigen namespace, to
    avoid clashes.
  * Submission of CMS_2022_I2079374: Z pT over a wide mass range
    at 13 TeV

  separate package (Rivet-data) and have it required from both
  %{name}-devel and python3-%{name} packages.
- Run tests as part of %check section.
- Move sed fixes to hashbangs to %setup section, running them over
  scripts in source rather than on buildroot installed dirs to
  allow tests in %check to succeed.

    Particles.  It sets the user index so the constituents will
    match the indices of the particle or jet vector used as input.

    hist booking, falls back to ENERGY option to make routines
    reentrant safe
  * fix back for CounterPtr filling: no fill should mean no fill,
    not fill using weight 0
  * Add ability for mkhtml to use pdfunite in place of pdftk and
    pdfmerge for making a booklet.
  * fix indentation in MC_MUONS.info
  * add per-file print out to rivet-merge
  * support keyboard interruption in rivet-merge
  * Correction to use xE rather than xP in OPAL_1997_S3396100, by
    Adil Jueid.
  * New CMS analyses: CMS_2020_I1794169 (WZ and same-sign WW boson

    cython executable.
  * Use more numerically robust x and y definitions in

    runs to 3.1.x.
  * Add a --no-downloads flag to rivet-mkanalysis.

  * Add bare-lepton origin position to DressedLepton constructors.
  * Add aspace() and l/rpad() utility functions.
  * Rename the little-used in-place sortBy() functions to
    isortBy() cf. ifilter() and friends, since the behaviour
    should not change wildly just based on the constness status of
    an argument.
  * Add JADE_1985_I213948 gamma, pi0 and eta spectra at 14, 22.5

    private method on the HepMC2 WeightContainer, for robust and
    correctly ordered weight name acquisition before HepMC
    2.06.11.
  * Allow several AnalysisHandler objects to run in different

  * Fixes to CMS_2016_I1487288 jet selection and normalisation.
  * Improve Vector3::azimuthalAngle() (also used by FourMomentum
    and FourVector) to use exact rather than fuzzy is-zero check,
    to only check the perpendicular components, and to note that
    IEEE floating point implementations of atan2 should already be
    'safe' unless we decide that this function should throw or
    return NaN in case of null or along-z vectors.
  * Tools/Utils.h: Add isum() functions, and mark other container
    functions as wanting a conversion to use std::function.
  * Add super-generic (i)discardIfAny(particlebases,
    particlebases, bool(pb,pb)) functions.
  * Introduce TTMODE options for MC_TTBAR to pick the decay mode
- Changes from versions 2.7.1 and 2.7.0: See

  avoid ambiguous namespace; patch taken from upstream commit
- YODA >= 1.7.4 required for building.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  9 16:03:53 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.6.0:
  * Long long list of changes: see
    %{_docdir}/%{name}-devel/ChangeLog.
- Rebase sover.diff for updated version.
- Fix package groups.
- Add a plugins package containing all the different analysis
  packages:
  * Plugins are unversioned; the need to depend on the version of
    the devel package.
  * Move plugins to %{_libdir}/Rivet-plugins directory
  * Install an ld.so.conf file so that the plugins are found when
    compiling against them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 09:20:42 UTC 2018 - guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org

- Add _constraints file to avoid OOM build failures

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 31 22:19:11 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Build with HepMC2-devel, since Rivet does not compile with
  HepMC-devel >= 3 yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 23 20:25:55 UTC 2017 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.5.4:
  * Fix 8 TeV DY (ATLAS_2016_I1467454), EL/MU bits were bissing.
  * Add 13 TeV DY (ATLAS_2017_I1514251) and mark
    ATLAS_2015_CONF_2015_041 obsolete.
  * Add missing install statement for
    ATLAS_2016_I1448301.yoda/plot/info leading to segfault.
  * Slight improvements to Particle constructors.
  * Improvement to Beam projection: before falling back to
    barcodes 1 & 2, try a manual search for status=4 particles.
    Based on a patch from Andrii Verbytskyi.
  * Add CMS_2016_I1430892: dilepton channel ttbar charge asymmetry
    analysis.
  * Add CMS_2016_I1413748: dilepton channel ttbar spin
    correlations and polarisation analysis.
  * Add CMS_2017_I1518399: leading jet mass for boosted top
    quarks at 8 TeV.
  * Add convenience constructors for ChargedLeptons projection.
  * Add FinalState and Cut (optional) constructor arguments and
    usage to DISFinalState. Thanks to Andrii Verbytskyi for the
    idea and initial patch.
  * Add ATLAS_2016_I1448301, Z/gamma cross section measurement at
    8 TeV.
  * Add ATLAS_2016_I1426515, WW production at 8 TeV.
  * Add BELLE measurement of semileptonic B0bar -> D*+ ell nu
    decays. I took the liberty to correct the data in the sense
    that I take the bin widths into account in the normalisation.
    BELLE_2017_I1512299.
    This is a nice analysis as it probes the hadronic and the
    leptonic side of the decay so very valuable for model building
    and of course it is rare as it is an unfolded B measurement.
  * Add ALEPH measurement of hadronic tau decays,
    ALEPH_2014_I1267648.
  * Add ALEPH dimuon invariant mass (OS and SS) analysis,
    ALEPH_2016_I1492968.
  * The latter needed GENKTEE FastJet algorithm so I added that
    FastJets.
  * Protection against logspace exception in histobooking of
    MC_JetAnalysis.

    functors. Yay for C++11!
  * Add ParticleEffFilter and JetEffFilter constructors from a
    double (encoding constant efficiency).

  * Adding leading dijet mass plots to MC_JetAnalysis (and all
    derived classes). Thanks to Chris Gutschow!

    CMS_PAS_FSQ_12_020 (preliminary 7 TeV leading-track underlying
    event).

    and 1960 GeV).
  * Adding ATLAS_2016_I1467230 (13 TeV min bias),
    ATLAS_2016_I1468167 (13 TeV inelastic pp cross-section), and
    ATLAS_2016_I1479760 (7 TeV pp double-parton scattering with 4
    jets).
  * Adding ALICE_2012_I1116147 (eta and pi0 pTs and ratio) and

    (jets + MET).
  * Provide convenience reversed-argument versions of apply and
    declare methods, to allow presentational choice of declare
    syntax in situations where the projection argument is very
    long, and reduce requirements on the user's memory since this
    is one situation in Rivet where there is no 'most natural'
    ordering choice.
  * Adding pTvec() function to 4-vectors and ParticleBase.
  * Fix --pwd option of the rivet script
  * Add weights and scaling to Cutflow/s.
  * Add Et(const ParticleBase&) unbound function.
  * Fix missing YAML quote mark in rivet-mkanalysis.
  * Fix constness requirements on ifilter_select() and
    Particle/JetEffFilter::operator().
  * src/Analyses/ATLAS_2016_I1458270.cc: Fix inverted particle
    efficiency filtering.

    Delphes (ATLAS and CMS versions are identical, hmmm).
  * Tidying/fixing make-plots custom z-ticks code. Thanks to Dmitry

  * Added some keywords and Lumi to ATLAS_2016_I1458270.

    the c.m. cuts can be done in a non-approximate way

    ParticleFinder/FinalState, in particular adding the range of
    cuts arguments cf. JetAlg (and tweaking the sorted jets
