- Exclude 32bit buildtargets via ExcludeArch %{ix86} %{arm}. They
  have been broken for ages with no fix in sight.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 10 03:31:33 UTC 2022 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Add upstream 0001-Retro-GTK-1.0.2-fix-meson-build-failure.patch
  based on commit 8016c10e7216394bc66281f2d9be740140b6fad6 to fix
  pkg.generate() that got "export_packages" and "namespace" keyword
  arguments removed in Meson 0.60 release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 22 07:52:15 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.0.2:
  + RetroCoreDescriptor: Propagate an accidentally unhandled error.
  + Implement mouse buttons 4 and 5.
  + Fix the GLES context initialization.
  + Drop the code making temporary copies of the core to avoid
    static variable collisions, this isn't needed anymore as such
    collisions can't happen since a single instance of a core is
    used per subprocess.
  + Many code style cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 29 13:34:52 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.0.1:
  + RetroCoreView: Add the key press, key release and touch event
    masks to ensure it receives all the events it can handle, and
    hence to ensure that these input methods work as expected.
  + Meson: Add the vapi option to allow disabling building Vala
    bindings.
  + Documentation:
    - Add the Libretro Core Descriptor Specification 1.0 section.
    - Add the Retro Reference Test Case Specification 1.0 section.
  + Clean up the documentation, README.md, HACKING.md,
    retro-gtk.doap, .editorconfig, update-from-retroarch, the Meson
    files, and more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 13:15:03 UTC 2020 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.0:
  + Major API overhaul and API version bump, detailing all the
    changes would be ridiculous and hence won't be done.
  + Run Libretro cores isolated in a dedicated subprocess,
    similarly to how modern web browsers handle web pages.
  + Support Libretro cores rendering their video with OpenGL.
  + Improve the Libretro core timing accuracy.
  + Resample the Libretro core's audio output to ensure it matches
    its play speed.
- Package the new retro-runner in the main package. The library
  requires this to be present.

    - Add retro_pixbuf_set_aspect_ratio() for embedding aspect
      ratio value to a GdkPixbuf.
    - Add retro_pixbuf_get_aspect_ratio() for retrieving the value
      set with retro_pixbuf_set_aspect_ratio().
    - Deprecate x-dpi and y-dpi metadata options.
  + RetroCoreView:
    - Take pixbuf aspect ratio into account when drawing a
      standalone pixbuf instead of using aspect ratio of the
      current core.
  + Fix build on Fedora 30.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 11 09:31:07 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.16.1:

- Update to version 0.16.0:
  + Update README.md.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 30 10:28:11 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.15.90:
  + RetroMainLoop:
    - Lower the priority of the loop to prevent a lagging game from
      freezing the rendering of its video.
    - Prevent reference leaking when destroying the loop while it's
      not stopped by not giving a reference to the loop's callback.
  + RetroGLDisplay: Take the UI's scale into account, making it
    usable in Hi-DPI.
  + Prepare RetroGLDisplay for GTK+ 4:
    - Don't clear depth buffer as we don't use it and as this would
      cause glitches in GTK+ 4.
    - Explicitly use glClearColor().
    - Call glBindTexture() on every frame to ensure that we're
      always working with the right texture, which is needed for
      GTK+ 4.
  + Fix reference cycles in retro-demo to avoid memory leaks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 28 21:25:29 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.15.3:
  + Build:
    - Replace the Autotools by Meson.
    - Replace intltool for gettext.
    - Replace the update-gameinfo build target by the
      update-gameinfo.sh script.
    - Add a development profile, settable by passing the
      `-Dprofile=development` parameter to Meson. This profile
      makes it clear the application is a development version by
      appending ` (Development)` to the application name, by
      appending `Devel` to the application ID, by changing the
      style of the header bar and by appending the commit tag or
      `-devel` to the version number.
  + UI:
    - Allow to set the keyboard to gamepad mapping from the
      preferences Controllers page.
    - Make searching for local covers less greedy and asynchronous,
      speeding up the loading time of the collection.
    - Move the application menu to the collection view's header
      bar.
    - Add the Help application menu entry, opening Games'
      documentation on the GNOME wiki.
    - Add the Shortcuts application menu entry displaying a
      shortcuts window.
    - Display small thumbnails if the window is narrow to display
      more of games.
    - Correctly update the selected media number on the media
      selector.
    - Drop the shadow in the collection view's scrolled window.
  + Libretro backend:
    - Add support for .options keyfiles listing options to be set
      on a Libretro core at initialization time.
    - Add predefined options for DeSmuME and DeSmuME 2015.
  + Supported games:
    - Add support for Virtual Boy games.
    - Use a dedicated MIME type for Neo Geo Pocket Color instead of
      the Neo Geo Pocket one.
    - Use a phony TurboGrafx-CD MIME type to fetch information from
      Grilo.
  + Allow to read cue sheets in other formats than UTF-8, avoiding
    the application to crash when parsing a file in UTF-16 or other
    encoding.
  + Update the authors lists.
  + Update the appdata to the latest specifications, OARS metadata
    and update gitlab links.
  + Updated translations.
- Bump namever define to 0_14-0 following upstreams changes.

  + RetroCoreView:
    - Render the video with OpenGL instead of Cairo.
    - Drop the 'pixbuf' property, but keep the pixbuf accessor
      functions.
    - Grab the focus when clicked, avoiding to miss the player's
      keyboard events to control the game.
    - Allow it to be the default widget by default bt setting the
      'can-default' property to TRUE on construction.
  + Add internal support for GLSL based video filters and port the
    existing ones to GLSL so they can work with the OpenGL
    renderer.
  + Add RETRO_VIDEO_FILTER_CRT, a RetroVideoFilter demanding the
    video display to mimick a CRT TV screen.
  + RetroPixdata:
    - Add retro_pixdata_get_width/height() and
      retro_pixdata_load_gl_texture(), allowing to export the pixel
      data to an OpenGL texture and to draw it at the expected
      size.
    - Don't fail when constructing with a non-zero rowstride, as
      these are valid values.
  + Add the set_rumble_state() virtual method to RetroController
    and implement it in RetroCoreViewController.
  + Build system change: make retro-gtk-demo properly depend on
    retro-gtk.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#790454.
- Add pkgconfig(epoxy) BuildRequires: new dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 26 11:47:03 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.13.2:
  + Port the build system to Meson, requiring version 0.43.0 and
    drop the Autotools.
  + Drop retro_core_remove_controller(), to remove a controller
    instead set it to NULL.
  + Make retro_core_poll_controllers(),
    retro_core_get_controller_input_state() and
    retro_core_get_controller_capabilities() private as they are
    meant to be used by the Libretro core and not the end users.
  + Add:
    - retro_core_set_default_controller() to set controllers to be
      used by default when there is no controller with the
      requested capability in the requested port.
    - retro_core_view_set_as_default_controller() to easily set the
      controllers of a RetroCoreView as the default controllers of
      a RetroCore. retro-demo now uses these.
    - retro_controller_has_capability() to easily check if a
      controller has the given RetroControllerType capability.
    - Add RetroInput to encapsulate the inputs used in an input
      state query. It is used in retro_controller_get_input_state()
      and retro_core_view_get_input_state().
    - Add a count enumeration value to RetroControllerType and the
      various controller code enumerations.
  + Replace gboolean by bool in get_variable_update() to avoid
    crashes.
  + Better check the creation of the PuleAudio sound output to
    avoid crashes.
- Replace configure, make, make_install macros by meson,
  meson_build and meson_install macros following upstream port to
  Meson Build System.

  upstream dropped libretro-gtk.so and replaced libretro-gtk.so.0
  by libretro-gtk-0.14.so
- Drop intltool BuildRequires: it's not needed since retro-gtk do
  not use translations.
- Add %namever and %libver macros to facilitate updatings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 16 06:27:24 UTC 2017 - adrien.plazas@suse.com

- Update to version 0.13.1:
  + This version ports retro-gtk from Vala to C and simnplifies the
    API a lot. It comes with lots of API breaks, so many that it
    would be simpler to list what remained similar to the 0.12
    branch than what changed.
  + The API will keep changing during the 0.14 development cycle,
    but it is hoped to lead to less API breaks after that.
- Replace BuildRequires vala with BuildRequires pkgconfig(vapigen)
  as retro-gtk is now a C library compiling a VAPI.
- Rename subpackage typelib-1_0-Retro-0_12 to
  typelib-1_0-Retro-0_14 following upstream changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  3 17:56:13 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

  + Make internal and port to C:
    - GameInfo.
    - Module.
    - SystemAvInfo.
    - SystemInfo.
    - most of Core.
    - keyboard keys.
  + Remove unused symbols:
    - DiskControl.
    - GamepadConfiguration.
    - GamepadButtonType.
    - Keyboard.
    - KeyboardState.
    - MemDesc.
    - MemoryDescriptor.
    - MemoryMap.
    - Mouse.
    - VirtualGamepad.
    - get_system_info ().
    - SNES specific memory types from MemoryType.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 17 14:09:20 UTC 2017 - aplazas@suse.com

- Update to version 0.11.4.1:
  + A demo application has been added, it allows to directly test
    the without the need of an external tool.
  + Loading games:
    - Add the set_medias(), load_medias() and set_current_media()
      methods to Core and load the given medias (if any) in
      Core.init().
    - Remove load_game() and prepare() Core methods from the
      public API as they are now used indirectly.
    - This should simplify loading games for the users of the
      library.
  + Logging:
    - Add the Core.log() signal which will emit a GLib compatible
      logging message with the Libretro core's name as the log
      domain.
    - Add retro_g_log() to simply handle Core.log() by outputing
      the logs in the expected unstructured GLib fashion.
    - Remove LogLevel, Log and FileStreamLog as they are now
      useless.
  + Add CoreView as a prototype of a single widget to handle most
    inputs and outputs of a core and use it in the demo.
