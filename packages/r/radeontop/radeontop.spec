%description
A tool to view Radeon GPU utilization, both for the total activity percent
and individual blocks. Supported cards are R600 and up, even Southern
Islands should work fine. Works with both the open drivers and AMD
Catalyst. The total GPU utilization is also valid for OpenCL loads; the
other blocks are only useful in GL loads.
