simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

   example)

- *Advanced* Object-Oriented features(Mix-in, Singleton-method, for
   example)

- Operator Overloading

- Exception Handling

- Iterators and Closures

- Garbage Collection

- Dynamic Loading of Object Files (on some architectures)

BeOS, and more)</description>
