%description
Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming.  It has many features for processing text
files and performing system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is
simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

* Ruby features:

- Simple Syntax

- *Normal* Object-Oriented features (class, method calls, for
   example)

- *Advanced* Object-Oriented features(Mix-in, Singleton-method, for
   example)

- Operator Overloading

- Exception Handling

- Iterators and Closures

- Garbage Collection

- Dynamic Loading of Object Files (on some architectures)

- Highly Portable (works on many UNIX machines; DOS, Windows, Mac,
BeOS, and more)
