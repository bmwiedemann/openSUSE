Mon May 11 10:56:05 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 0.9.24
  - Added support for Ubuntu Kylin and Pop!_OS 20.04.
  - Provide the option of automatically creating a tar file of
    program configuration file and log files when submitting a bug
    report.
  - Fixed bug #1875268: Overly long download source name
    limitlessly expands window width.
  - Fixed bug #1876344: Unable to generate thumbnails or download
    from Fujifilm X-H1.
  - All message box buttons should now be able to be translated (or
    able to be translated).
  - Updated Chinese (Simplified), Czech, Dutch, French, German,
    Hungarian, Serbian, Spanish and Turkish translations.
- Changes from 0.9.23
  - Fixed bug #1872188: sqlite3.OperationalError when generating
    thumbnails.
  - Fixed bug #1873057: Add ORI to list of supported image formats.
  - Fixed bug #1873233: RAW and JPG don't synchronize when using
    stored number.
  - Fixed bug where HEIF/HEIC thumbnails on a camera were not being
    generated until they were downloaded.
  - When generating video thumbnails for phones and tablets, the
    entire video will now be downloaded and cached. Previously only
    a portion of the video was downloaded, in the hope that this
    portion could generate the thumbnail, but unfortunately it did
    not always render. This new behavior will slow down thumbnail
    generation, but does ensure the thumbnail will be rendered. If
    you object to this new behavior or know of a better approach,
    please share your thoughts in the discussion forum:

Sat Apr 11 20:04:03 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 0.9.22 
  - Fixed bugs where camera insertion and removal was not being
    detected in some circumstances. In KDE, it was camera removal.
    In Gnome-like systems where auto mounting of cameras is
    disabled or not functional, it was insertion.
  - More robustly handle a camera being unexpectedly removed during
    scanning, thumbnailing, and copying files.
  - Fixed bug #1871649: Window corruption when application scaling
    enabled on certain desktop environments. The application now
    uses Qt and Gdk to query whether any monitor has scaling
    enabled. If no scaling is enabled on any monitor, then Rapid
    Photo Downloader will not enable automatic scaling.
  - New package dependency:
    Python 3 gobject introspection for Gdk 3.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 23 14:15:10 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- removed all manual typelib requires again as we fixed the
  underlying problem in libdbusmenu 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 22 20:59:08 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 0.9.20 
  - Added support for program icon progress bars and badge counts
    on any desktop that supports the Unity LauncherEntry API, not
    just Ubuntu Unity or Gnome running under Ubuntu. (The Unity
    LauncherEntry API is used by desktops other than Unity and
    Ubuntu Gnome, e.g. KDE, Dash to Panel.)
  - Added missing property StartupWMClass to the program's desktop
    file. It's now possible to add the Rapid Photo Downloader
    launcher as a Favorite to the Gnome Shell dock and not have it
    appear as a duplicate entry when the program runs. This fix
    also enables program icon progress bars and badge counts under
    Gnome Shell extensions that support them.
  - Implemented feature request in bug #1810102: cannot change
    language in program preferences. You can now specify the
    language you want the user interface to display in regardless
    of the system locale setting.
  - Fixed problems in setup.py. Made requirements.txt more
    conformant.
  - Better handle missing ExifTool on startup.
- refreshed disable-version-check.patch
- remove the typelib requires exclude as rpd now shows the progress
  with libunity
- add requires for new dependencies:
  - python3-Babel
  - libQt5Svg5
  - typelib(Unity) = 7.0
  - typelib(UnityExtras) = 7.0
- add temporary requires that should be pulled by typelib(Unity)
  - typelib(Dbusmenu) = 0.4
  - typelib(Dee) = 1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 17 16:20:27 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 0.9.19 
  - Fixed errors in appstream metainfo file.
  - To better conform to appstream metadata requirements, renamed
    destktop and metadata files to
    net.damonlynch.rapid_photo_downloader.desktop and
    net.damonlynch.rapid_photo_downloader.metainfo.xml. The
    metainfo file is now installed in share/metainfo/, not
    share/appdata/.
  - Added Zorin OS to install.py script.
  - Only install symlinks to the program in a bin directory the
    users's home directory (i.e. ~/bin) if necessary. On recent
    installations of Debian / Ubuntu / LinuxMint etc. with a
    default profile setup, this is no longer necessary.
  - When uninstalling the program that was previously installed
    with install.py script, remove any symlinks to it created in
    ~/bin.
  - Removed setup.cfg configuration file.
  - Removed notification informing the Timeline or provisional
    download folders was rebuilt.
  - Updated Dutch, Hungarian, Russian, Spanish, Russian, and
    Turkish translations.
  - Improved fix for a bug where thumbnails would not be able to
    have their checkmark set on or off with the mouse on recent
    versions of Qt. The fix in 0.9.19b2 did not always work. The
    environment variable RPD_THUMBNAIL_MARK_FIX introduced in
    0.9.19b2 is no longer needed, and will be ignored.
  - Fixed bug #1842060: Wrong value saved for stored number.
  - Updated Czech, Dutch, French, and Spanish translations.
  - Fixed a bug where thumbnails would not be able to have their
    checkmark set on or off with the mouse on recent versions of
    Qt. See the release notes for details.
  - Improved visual appearance on high DPI screens.
  - Added HEIF / HEIC support. See the Release Notes for details.
  - Added support for CentOS 8 to installer script. Dropped support
    for Fedora 29 and older. Installer script no longer installs
    PyQt5 from PyPI on KDE Neon, because KDE Neon PyQt5 package is
    always up-to-date.
  - Added '__MACOSX' and to list of paths to ignore while scanning
    a device for photos and videos, and if the list of ignored
    paths is customized, add it and 'THMBNL' to the existing list
    of ignored paths.
  - No longer look for photos or videos in any directory on a
    camera or phone that contains a '.nomedia' file.
  - Made Timeline and thumbnails render more quickly and accurately
    on displays with fractional scaling.
  - Fixed bug #1861591: install.py should handle cases with no LANG
    variable set.
  - Fixed bug #1833525: when using the filename and subfolder name
    preference editor, under some desktop styles the example file
    and subfolder names would shrink to the extent they would be
    truncated.
  - Fixed bug where Rapid Photo Downloader would crash when the
    Preferences dialog window was closed with the escape key.
  - Fixed bug where under some desktop styles the right side panel
    would always be open even if it had been closed when Rapid
    Photo Downloader last exited.
  - Improved support for high DPI screens. Requires Qt5.6 or newer.
    Please report any remaining problems when running on high DPI
    screens. For now, if you change the desktop's screen scaling
    while Rapid Photo Downloader is running, please restart it.
- add recommends for python3-pyheif

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 16 23:26:52 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 0.9.18
  Fixed several important bugs that could cause installation to
  fail. and a bug that could cause Rapid Photo Downloader when
  displaying some date/times in locales not fully translated in the
  Python module Arrow.

  Changelog:
  - Fixed bug in install.py script which meant the most recent
    version of PyQt5 failed to install because pip failed to build
    it. The solution is to update the user's copy of pip to the
    latest version (not the system-wide version).  If this is not
    what you want, you can downgrade pip for your user after
    program installation. See the release notes for more details.

  - Fixed bug #1857144: with newer versions of the Python date time
    module Arrow, if Arrow had not been translated to use the
    user's locale, Arrow will generate an exception when displaying
    the humanized form of some dates, causing Rapid Photo
    Downloader to crash. Now Rapid Photo Downloader reverts to
    English for any humanized string that Arrow fails to handle in
    the user's locale.

  - Fixed bug #1853775: install.py script did not properly handle
    upgrading pip version < 9.0 when installing into a virtual
    environment, looping forever.

  - Added Turkish translation. Thank you to Ilker Alp for the
    translation.  Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Finnish, German,
    Indonesian, Italian, Polish, and Spanish translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  5 23:05:07 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- add BuildRequires for all our dependencies to make sure we have
  the right versions still in the distro

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  5 22:52:23 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to version 0.9.17
  - Fixed bug #1840499: Crash when python library arrow is older
    than version 0.9.0
  - Suppress parsing warnings issued by python library arrow

  - Allow the use of the Python instance that the install.py script
    is invoked with on Gentoo systems.
  - Updated Polish translation.
- changes from 0.9.16
  - Fixed bug #1839699 where program would fail to start when the
    python library arrow 0.4.15 or newer is installed.
  - Added the directory THMBNL to the standard list of ignored
    directories. This directory is used on some Sony cameras.
  - Added %f argument to Exec component of desktop file,
    potentially fixing problem with the program not appearing in
    Gnome's list of applications to deal with memory cards or
    cameras.
  - Updated Polish translation.
- changes from 0.9.15
  - Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, Hungarian,
    Japanese, Kabyle, Norwegian Nynorsk, Russian and Spanish
    translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  7 09:46:53 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 0.9.14
  * Fix bug #1821917: Error generating Timeline with Arrow
    0.13.1.
  * Fix bug #1817481: Error deleting sample file at program exit.
  * Fix bug #1810572: Error getting camera configuration on
    certain cameras.
  * Again fix bug #1801504: PyQt5_sip not installed or upgraded
    for local user when system copy already installed (bug seen
     on Fedora 29). The fix in 0.9.13 did not always work.
  * When installing using the install.py script, upgrade pip if
    its version is less than 9.0.
  * Disable the program's built-in upgrade procedure when
    running from within a python virtual environment.
  * Updated Czech, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish
    translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  7 08:03:41 UTC 2018 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Add oldsetuptools.patch to fix build on Leap 42.3 and SLE_12_SP3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  6 23:52:06 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 0.9.13
  - Added support for Sigma X3F file format.
  - Added support for installing into a Python virtual environment.
    See the file README.rst for installation instructions. Thanks
    to Matthias Homann for his code contribution.
  - Fix bug #1797479: New version check results in confusing
    messages on stderr when pip is not installed. Thanks to Eli
    Schwartz for the fix.
  - Added Deepin to supported Linux distributions.
  - Fixed bug #1801504: PyQt5_sip not installed or upgraded for
    local user when system copy already installed (bug seen on
    Fedora 29).
  - Import sip regardless of whether it is the private sip bundled
    with PyQt5 or a separate sip installation.
- changes from 0.9.12
  - Added support for Canon CR3 format. Requires ExifTool 10.87 or
    newer.  See the release notes for details on upgrading
    ExifTool. Note: program performance with CR3 files is notably
    slower than other photo file formats.  Other photo file formats
    are read using the high performance library exiv2 to read
    metadata and extract thumbnails. Unfortunately exiv2 does not
    yet support the CR3 format. Exiv2 0.28 will support the CR3
    format.
  - Fixed bug #1790351: Video date time metadata not parsed
    correctly when 'DST' appears in time zone component.
  - Added support for FFF and IIQ raw formats.
  - The MOS and MRW formats are now handled by ExifTool, not exiv2.
  - Better handle Exif date time values that unwisely deviate from
    the Exif Version 2.3 specification, e.g. Hasselblad files.
  - Fixed bug #1790278: File renaming and subfolder generation
    editor breaks with Python 3.7.
  - Updated installation script to use "loose" instead of "strict"
    Python version checking.
  - Fixed bug in installation script where a system installed Rapid
    Photo Downloader package was not being uninstalled.
  - Fixed bug #1791131: Report fatal camera access problem without
    crashing
  - Improved install.py script to install libmediainfo0 on openSUSE
    where the package exists.
- changes from 0.9.11
  - Added CentOS 7.5 as supported Linux distribution. See the
    release notes for installation instructions.
  - Add weekday as locale's abbreviated and full name to file
    renaming and subfolder generation options.
  - Correct mistake in fixing bug #1775654: optional dependencies
    listed in setup.py as required.
  - Fix bug #1787707: install.py does not handle installer tar path
    with spaces.
  - Improve detection of openSUSE in install.py script.
  - Better handle file managers that do not allow the selection of
    files using command line arguments, which is important for
    desktops like Mate, LXDE, and XFCE.
  - Provide sensible fallback when system erroneously reports
    default file manager.
  - Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, Japanese,
    Kabyle, Norwegian Nynorsk, and Spanish translations.
- changes from 0.9.10
  - Fix bug #1784175: Make application compatible with changes to
    sip introduced in PyQt 5.11, and do not install PyQt 5.11 on
    systems with Python 3.5.3 or older.
  - Fix bug #1775654: optional dependencies listed in setup.py as
    required.
  - Fix bug #1755915: Crash while accessing non-existant SQL
    database 'cache' while exiting.
  - Fix bug #1764167: Division by zero error when scanning device
    that does not report its size
  - Fix bug #1774411: splash screen covering name-dialog when set
    to auto- download
  - Fixed bug in Appstream specification.
  - Updated German translation.
- refresh disable-version-check.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 24 10:41:42 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 0.9.9
  * Fix bug #1750879: Sequence numbers increment incorrectly for
    videos when Synchronize RAW+JPEG enabled.
  * Fix bug in sequence letter generation.
  * Enable the disabling of new version checks in both the
    program logic and the user interface, which is useful for
    Linux distributions. To disable the check, Linux package
    maintainers should patch the file constants.py to
    change the line `disable_version_check = False` to
    `disable_version_check = True`.
  * Include tornado as a dependency instead of relying on the
    deprecated mini-tornado found in pyzmq.
  version 0.9.8:
  * On Sony files, use ExifTool to get shutter count metadata.
    Please note, not all Sony models produce this metadata.

- Added disable-version-check.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 30 21:48:42 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Replace description to say something about the software's
  functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 26 08:06:20 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 0.9.7
  * Fixed bug where removing a download source while another source
    was being scanned could cause a crash when the timeline was
    scrolled.
  * Fixed bug where session sequence values were being reset every
    time a download was initiated, not every time the program was
    started.
  * Updated German, Hungarian and Norwegian Bokmal translations.
  * Fix bug #1738174: Don't crash when right clicking in thumbnail
    checkbox and no thumbnail is selected.
  * Fix bug #1737416: Don't scan cameras when browsing "This
    Computer", and detect if a camera mount has been passed via
    the command line (which can happen when the program
    automatically launches in response to a camera being attached
    to the computer).
  * When opening a file in KDE's Dolphin file manager, select the
    file (and thus highlight it), like is done with Gnome Files and
    several other file managers.
  * Fix bug #1737287: Don't allow identical entries in subfolder
    generation and file renaming presets, where the preset names
    differ but their content is the same.
  version  0.9.6:
  * When scrolling is synchronized, and you click on a thumbnail,
    the top of the Timeline will be scrolled match to match it.
  * Don't crash when only new files are displayed and the Timeline
    is scrolled when scrolling is synchronized.
  * Updated Czech, Dutch, Hungarian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish
    translations.
  * Don't crash when Timeline ranges are selected and scrolling is
    synchronized.
  * The Timeline is now shown by default when the program is first
    run, or settings are reset.
  * Added option to synchronize Timeline with thumbnails. Scroll
    one, and the other automatically scrolls too. Use the button
    at the bottom-right of the Timeline to toggle this feature.
  * After clearing a Timeline selection, the display of thumbnails
    will be positioned such that the the photos in the previous
    selection are visible. Previously, the thumbnails display would
    be scrolled all the way to the top after the Timeline selection
    had been cleared.
  * Added Hasselblad 3FR files to list of supported file formats.
    If you detect any problems with the accuracy of the metadata
    from this format, please let me know.
  * Work around MediaInfoLib bug #695 that caused the libmediainfo
    shared object file to be named incorrectly, making it appear
    to be missing.
  * Correctly parse Distribution version in installer when running
    on Fedora, Debian and Peppermint.
  * Install PyQt 5.9.2 or greater. Upgrade pymediainfo to version
    2.2.0 or newer.
  * Updated Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German,
    Norwegian Nyorsk, Russian, and Spanish translations.
  version 0.9.5:
  * Added check to install.py installation script and upgrade.py
    upgrade script to ensure that SIP 4.19.3 is installed when
    PyQt 5.9 is installed. The combination of SIP  4.19.4 and
    PyQt 5.9 causes Rapid Photo Downloader to crash. Because SIP
    4.19.4 is installed by default when installing PyQt 5.9, the
    install and upgrade scripts forcibly revert to
    SIP 4.19.3 when PyQt 5.9 is installed.
  * Add option to manually mark files as previously downloaded,
    allowing for occasions when another program has already
    downloaded the files. Right-click on one or more photo or video
    thumbnails to mark them as previously downloaded.
  * Add elementary OS to list of Linux distributions supported by
    the install.py script.
  * Fixed bug in upgrade script when reporting an operational
    failure.
  * Updated Chinese, Dutch, Italian, and Norwegian Bokmal
    translations.
  version 0.9.4:
  * Workaround bug in iOS devices that create on-the-fly subfolders
    from which to download that vary each time the device is
    initialized.
  * Add progress bars and badge counts when running under Ubuntu
    17.10's Dash to Dock extension.
  * Don't crash when locale is not correctly set.
  * Updated Dutch, French and German translations.

Fri Sep 15 18:38:44 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Added python3-pyzmq version requirement

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 15 18:09:51 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.9.3:
  + When requesting GIO to unmount a camera / phone so it can be
    accessed by libgphoto2, retry several times if it fails.
    Sometimes a GIO client program such as Gnome Files needs a few
    seconds to relinquish control of the device.
  + Fixed bug where a crash could occur when removing a camera that
    was in the preliminary stages of being scanned.
  + Fixed a bug introduced in 0.9.3b1 where photo and video numbers
    and sizes were not displayed in the devices summary in the
    program's left-hand pane.
  + Fixed a bug on Fedora where the maximum length for an sqlite3
    query could be exceeded.
  + When running a user-installed python such as Anaconda or
    another custom python, where possible the install.py script now
    switches over to using the Linux distribution's system python.
  + Under Python 3.6 or newer, bumped required version of pyzmq up
    to 16.0.2, hopefully avoiding a segfault observed with pyzmq
    15.1.0 and ZeroMQ 4.1.5. See the Release Notes for more
    details.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 11 09:14:49 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Use automatic dependencies detection for typelib():
  + Add gobject-introspection BuildRequires (which contains the
    parser and rpm logic).
  + Drop the static typelib-1_0-* Requires.
  + As openSUSE does not provide Unity, filter out typelib(Unity)
    from the automatic dependency list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 10 15:10:06 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Added missing runtime dependency, fixes (boo#1057972)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 28 10:55:07 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Set correct license

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 27 06:09:22 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 0.9.2
  * When displaying the time in the Timeline in a locale that
    does not use a twelve hour clock, correctly display the time
    using the 24 hour clock. If the times or dates being displayed
    in the Timeline are not displayed correctly in your language,
    please file a bug report.
  * Fixed a bug where an exception could occur when clicking on
    some Timeline entries or displaying their thumbnails as a
    tooltip. It occurred when the Timeline had one or more entries
    in the right-most column that spanned more than one calendar
    day. The code that generates the Timeline is among the most
    complex in the application. If you notice any problems, please
    file a bug report.
  * When a download device is inserted and downloaded files are
    already in the main window, the program will now ask if the
    completed downloads should be cleared. A new, associated program
    preference controls if the program should query and what action
    to take.
  * Improved visual appearance of preferences window.
  * Fixed a bug where the thumbnail extractors might crash when
    the thumbnail cache database had not yet been created, which
    could happen in unusual circumstances such as when the disk was
    under particularly heavy load.
  * Fixed bug extracting date/time metadata from videos where
    devices that create videos from which metadata cannot be
    extracted until the entire video is downloaded from the device.
  * When running LXQt, now assume the default file manager is
    pcmanfm-qt, regardless of what the mime-type handler reports.
    URIs passed to it now have the specific file stripped from the
    path, avoiding errors with pcmanfm-qt opening it. Currently,
    compared to more mature platforms like Gnome, LXQt has
    limitations that limit Rapid Photo Downloader's
    functionality.
  * Added uninstall and uninstall including dependencies options
    to the install.py script.
  * Added localization to the install.py script. The install
    script now embeds the files needed for localization, and
    utilizes them if needed.
  * The install.py script now checks key installation folders for
    ownership and permission problems, fixing them if necessary.
  * The install.py script now correctly parses openSUSE's zypper
    output to ascertain distribution packages that are already
    installed, saving time during installation.
  * In install.py, catch return code 104 from zypper se when no
    package is found.
  * Added support for Peppermint OS to the install.py script.
  * Terminate program at startup if the program's own module
    imports are being loaded from conflicting sources, indicating
    more than one copy of the program has been installed.
  * Report gphoto2 errors on the command line and Error Reports
    window with the name of the error rather than its numeric code.
  * Catch file permission errors more effectively in copy, rename,
    and backup processes.
  * Fixed bug when deleting certain sample videos from a device
    that had already been removed.
  * Updated Belarusian, Chinese (Simplified), Czech, Dutch, French,
    German, Hungarian, Japanese, Norwegian Bokmal, Norwegian
    Nynorsk, Russian and Spanish translations.
  * Applied a patch from Mikael Wiesel to fix a bug where several
    strings were not available for translation. Additionally made
    available for translation some buttons whose text was
    untranslated. Moreover, humanized times such as "one hour ago"
    (all of which are generated using the python library Arrow)
    are now localized where Arrow supports it. Finally,
    date/times in tooltips that appear over thumbnails are now
    localized, and locale date / times are used in download
    subfolder and filename generation for values like months.

    from image device upon download completion" options are

    up correctly too

    attempting to download to a read-only folder

    location path exists

    in your image renaming; enabling this option will cause the
    program to detect matching pairs of RAW and JPEG images, and
    when they are detected, the same sequence numbers and letters
    will be applied to both image names; furthermore, sequences
    will be updated as if the images were one
  * increased maximum sequence number length to seven digits by
    user request

    stored number not updated when changed via program preferences

  * added keyboard accelerators for Preferences and Help
