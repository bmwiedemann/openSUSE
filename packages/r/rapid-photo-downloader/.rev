    <comment>- Set correct license
- Update to version 0.9.2
  * When displaying the time in the Timeline in a locale that
    does not use a twelve hour clock, correctly display the time
    using the 24 hour clock. If the times or dates being displayed
    in the Timeline are not displayed correctly in your language,
    please file a bug report.
  * Fixed a bug where an exception could occur when clicking on
    some Timeline entries or displaying their thumbnails as a
    tooltip. It occurred when the Timeline had one or more entries
    in the right-most column that spanned more than one calendar
    day. The code that generates the Timeline is among the most
    complex in the application. If you notice any problems, please
    file a bug report.
  * When a download device is inserted and downloaded files are
    already in the main window, the program will now ask if the
    completed downloads should be cleared. A new, associated program
    preference controls if the program should query and what action
    to take.
  * Improved visual appearance of preferences window.
  * Fixed a bug where the thumbnail extractors might crash when
    the thumbnail cache database had not yet been created, which
    could happen in unusual circumstances such as when the disk was
    under particularly heavy load.
  * Fixed bug extracting date/time metadata from videos where
    devices that create videos from which metadata cannot be
    extracted until the entire video is downloaded from the device.
  * When running LXQt, now assume the default file manager is
    pcmanfm-qt, regardless of what the mime-type handler reports.
    URIs passed to it now have the specific file stripped from the
    path, avoiding errors with pcmanfm-qt opening it. Currently,
    compared to more mature platforms like Gnome, LXQt has
    limitations that limit Rapid Photo Downloader's
    functionality.
  * Added uninstall and uninstall including dependencies options
    to the install.py script.
  * Added localization to the install.py script. The install
    script now embeds the files needed for localization, and
    utilizes them if needed.
  * The install.py script now checks key installation folders for
    ownership and permission problems, fixing them if necessary.
  * The install.py script now correctly parses openSUSE's zypper
    output to ascertain distribution packages that are already
    installed, saving time during installation.
  * In install.py, catch return code 104 from zypper se when no
    package is found.
  * Added support for Peppermint OS to the install.py script.
  * Terminate program at startup if the program's own module
    imports are being loaded from conflicting sources, indicating
    more than one copy of the program has been installed.
  * Report gphoto2 errors on the command line and Error Reports
    window with the name of the error rather than its numeric code.
  * Catch file permission errors more effectively in copy, rename,
    and backup processes.
  * Fixed bug when deleting certain sample videos from a device
    that had already been removed.
  * Updated Belarusian, Chinese (Simplified), Czech, Dutch, French,
    German, Hungarian, Japanese, Norwegian Bokmal, Norwegian
    Nynorsk, Russian and Spanish translations.
  * Applied a patch from Mikael Wiesel to fix a bug where several
    strings were not available for translation. Additionally made
    available for translation some buttons whose text was
    untranslated. Moreover, humanized times such as &quot;one hour ago&quot;
    (all of which are generated using the python library Arrow)
    are now localized where Arrow supports it. Finally,
    date/times in tooltips that appear over thumbnails are now
    localized, and locale date / times are used in download
    subfolder and filename generation for values like months.

    of images: this option is useful if you use the RAW + JPEG
    feature on your camera and you use sequence numbers or letters
    in your image renaming; enabling this option will cause the
    program to detect matching pairs of RAW and JPEG images, and
    when they are detected, the same sequence numbers and letters
    will be applied to both image names; furthermore, sequences
    will be updated as if the images were one
  * increased maximum sequence number length to seven digits by

    <comment>- Use automatic dependencies detection for typelib():
  + Add gobject-introspection BuildRequires (which contains the
    parser and rpm logic).
  + Drop the static typelib-1_0-* Requires.
  + As openSUSE does not provide Unity, filter out typelib(Unity)
    from the automatic dependency list.
- Added missing runtime dependency, fixes (boo#1057972)

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Added python3-pyzmq version requirement
- Update to version 0.9.3:
  + When requesting GIO to unmount a camera / phone so it can be
    accessed by libgphoto2, retry several times if it fails.
    Sometimes a GIO client program such as Gnome Files needs a few
    seconds to relinquish control of the device.
  + Fixed bug where a crash could occur when removing a camera that
    was in the preliminary stages of being scanned.
  + Fixed a bug introduced in 0.9.3b1 where photo and video numbers
    and sizes were not displayed in the devices summary in the
    program's left-hand pane.
  + Fixed a bug on Fedora where the maximum length for an sqlite3
    query could be exceeded.
  + When running a user-installed python such as Anaconda or
    another custom python, where possible the install.py script now
    switches over to using the Linux distribution's system python.
  + Under Python 3.6 or newer, bumped required version of pyzmq up
    to 16.0.2, hopefully avoiding a segfault observed with pyzmq
    15.1.0 and ZeroMQ 4.1.5. See the Release Notes for more
    details.
  + Updated translations.

- Update to 0.9.13
  - Added support for Sigma X3F file format.
  - Added support for installing into a Python virtual environment.
    See the file README.rst for installation instructions. Thanks
    to Matthias Homann for his code contribution.

    messages on stderr when pip is not installed. Thanks to Eli
    Schwartz for the fix.
  - Added Deepin to supported Linux distributions.
  - Fixed bug #1801504: PyQt5_sip not installed or upgraded for
    local user when system copy already installed (bug seen on
    Fedora 29).
  - Import sip regardless of whether it is the private sip bundled
    with PyQt5 or a separate sip installation.
- changes from 0.9.12
  - Added support for Canon CR3 format. Requires ExifTool 10.87 or
    newer.  See the release notes for details on upgrading
    ExifTool. Note: program performance with CR3 files is notably
    slower than other photo file formats.  Other photo file formats
    are read using the high performance library exiv2 to read
    metadata and extract thumbnails. Unfortunately exiv2 does not
    yet support the CR3 format. Exiv2 0.28 will support the CR3
    format.
  - Fixed bug #1790351: Video date time metadata not parsed
    correctly when 'DST' appears in time zone component.
  - Added support for FFF and IIQ raw formats.
  - The MOS and MRW formats are now handled by ExifTool, not exiv2.
  - Better handle Exif date time values that unwisely deviate from
    the Exif Version 2.3 specification, e.g. Hasselblad files.
  - Fixed bug #1790278: File renaming and subfolder generation
    editor breaks with Python 3.7.
  - Updated installation script to use &quot;loose&quot; instead of &quot;strict&quot;
    Python version checking.
  - Fixed bug in installation script where a system installed Rapid
    Photo Downloader package was not being uninstalled.
  - Fixed bug #1791131: Report fatal camera access problem without
    crashing
  - Improved install.py script to install libmediainfo0 on openSUSE
    where the package exists.

    renaming and subfolder generation options.
  - Correct mistake in fixing bug #1775654: optional dependencies
    listed in setup.py as required.
  - Fix bug #1787707: install.py does not handle installer tar path
    with spaces.
  - Improve detection of openSUSE in install.py script.
  - Better handle file managers that do not allow the selection of
    files using command line arguments, which is important for
    desktops like Mate, LXDE, and XFCE.
  - Provide sensible fallback when system erroneously reports
    default file manager.
  - Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, Japanese,
    Kabyle, Norwegian Nynorsk, and Spanish translations.
- changes from 0.9.10
  - Fix bug #1784175: Make application compatible with changes to

    <time>1584531772</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 0.9.19 
  - Fixed errors in appstream metainfo file.
  - To better conform to appstream metadata requirements, renamed
    destktop and metadata files to
    net.damonlynch.rapid_photo_downloader.desktop and
    net.damonlynch.rapid_photo_downloader.metainfo.xml. The
    metainfo file is now installed in share/metainfo/, not
    share/appdata/.
  - Added Zorin OS to install.py script.
  - Only install symlinks to the program in a bin directory the
    users's home directory (i.e. ~/bin) if necessary. On recent
    installations of Debian / Ubuntu / LinuxMint etc. with a
    default profile setup, this is no longer necessary.
  - When uninstalling the program that was previously installed
    with install.py script, remove any symlinks to it created in
    ~/bin.
  - Removed setup.cfg configuration file.
  - Removed notification informing the Timeline or provisional
    download folders was rebuilt.
  - Updated Dutch, Hungarian, Russian, Spanish, Russian, and
    Turkish translations.
  - Improved fix for a bug where thumbnails would not be able to
    have their checkmark set on or off with the mouse on recent
    versions of Qt. The fix in 0.9.19b2 did not always work. The
    environment variable RPD_THUMBNAIL_MARK_FIX introduced in
    0.9.19b2 is no longer needed, and will be ignored.
  - Fixed bug #1842060: Wrong value saved for stored number.
  - Updated Czech, Dutch, French, and Spanish translations.
  - Fixed a bug where thumbnails would not be able to have their
    checkmark set on or off with the mouse on recent versions of
    Qt. See the release notes for details.
  - Improved visual appearance on high DPI screens.
  - Added HEIF / HEIC support. See the Release Notes for details.
  - Added support for CentOS 8 to installer script. Dropped support
    for Fedora 29 and older. Installer script no longer installs
    PyQt5 from PyPI on KDE Neon, because KDE Neon PyQt5 package is
    always up-to-date.
  - Added '__MACOSX' and to list of paths to ignore while scanning
    a device for photos and videos, and if the list of ignored
    paths is customized, add it and 'THMBNL' to the existing list
    of ignored paths.
  - No longer look for photos or videos in any directory on a
    camera or phone that contains a '.nomedia' file.
  - Made Timeline and thumbnails render more quickly and accurately
    on displays with fractional scaling.
  - Fixed bug #1861591: install.py should handle cases with no LANG
    variable set.
  - Fixed bug #1833525: when using the filename and subfolder name
    preference editor, under some desktop styles the example file
    and subfolder names would shrink to the extent they would be
    truncated.
  - Fixed bug where Rapid Photo Downloader would crash when the
    Preferences dialog window was closed with the escape key.
  - Fixed bug where under some desktop styles the right side panel
    would always be open even if it had been closed when Rapid
    Photo Downloader last exited.
  - Improved support for high DPI screens. Requires Qt5.6 or newer.
    Please report any remaining problems when running on high DPI
    screens. For now, if you change the desktop's screen scaling
    while Rapid Photo Downloader is running, please restart it.
- add recommends for python3-pyheif

    <comment>- Update to version 0.9.22 
  - Fixed bugs where camera insertion and removal was not being
    detected in some circumstances. In KDE, it was camera removal.
    In Gnome-like systems where auto mounting of cameras is
    disabled or not functional, it was insertion.
  - More robustly handle a camera being unexpectedly removed during
    scanning, thumbnailing, and copying files.
  - Fixed bug #1871649: Window corruption when application scaling
    enabled on certain desktop environments. The application now
    uses Qt and Gdk to query whether any monitor has scaling
    enabled. If no scaling is enabled on any monitor, then Rapid
    Photo Downloader will not enable automatic scaling.
  - New package dependency:

  - Added support for Ubuntu Kylin and Pop!_OS 20.04.
  - Provide the option of automatically creating a tar file of
    program configuration file and log files when submitting a bug
    report.
  - Fixed bug #1875268: Overly long download source name
    limitlessly expands window width.
  - Fixed bug #1876344: Unable to generate thumbnails or download
    from Fujifilm X-H1.
  - All message box buttons should now be able to be translated (or
    able to be translated).
  - Updated Chinese (Simplified), Czech, Dutch, French, German,
    Hungarian, Serbian, Spanish and Turkish translations.
- Changes from 0.9.23
  - Fixed bug #1872188: sqlite3.OperationalError when generating
    thumbnails.
  - Fixed bug #1873057: Add ORI to list of supported image formats.
  - Fixed bug #1873233: RAW and JPG don't synchronize when using
    stored number.
  - Fixed bug where HEIF/HEIC thumbnails on a camera were not being
    generated until they were downloaded.
  - When generating video thumbnails for phones and tablets, the
    entire video will now be downloaded and cached. Previously only
    a portion of the video was downloaded, in the hope that this
    portion could generate the thumbnail, but unfortunately it did
    not always render. This new behavior will slow down thumbnail
    generation, but does ensure the thumbnail will be rendered. If
    you object to this new behavior or know of a better approach,
    please share your thoughts in the discussion forum:
