- updated to version 2.2.1

  * Zeitwerk raised `NameError` when a managed file did not define its expected constant. Now, it raises `Zeitwerk::NameError` instead, so it is possible for client code to distinguish that mismatch from a regular `NameError`.

      Regarding backwards compatibility, `Zeitwerk::NameError` is a subclass of `NameError`.

  ## 2.2.0 (9 October 2019)

  * The default inflectors have API to override how to camelize selected basenames:

      ```ruby
      loader.inflector.inflect "mysql_adapter" => "MySQLAdapter"
      ```

      This addresses a common pattern, which is to use the basic inflectors with a few straightforward exceptions typically configured in a hash table or `case` expression. You no longer have to define a custom inflector if that is all you need.

  * Documentation improvements.

  ## 2.1.10 (6 September 2019)

  * Raises `Zeitwerk::NameError` with a better error message when a managed file or directory has a name that yields an invalid constant name when inflected. `Zeitwerk::NameError` is a subclass of `NameError`.

- updated to version 2.1.9

  * Preloading is soft-deprecated. The use case it was thought for
    is no longer. Please, if you have a legit use case for it, drop
    me a line.
  * Root directory conflict detection among loaders takes ignored
    directories into account.
  * Supports classes and modules with overridden `name` methods.
  * Documentation improvements.
