    * rbt
      - Execute a number of useful sub-commands to interact with local source
        code repositories and Review Board.
    * Python API Client
      - Python bindings to simplify interaction with the the Review Board
        Web API.

There are also some user-contributed scripts and application plugins in the
contrib directory. See the associated README files for more information.
