%description
raindrops is a real-time stats toolkit to show statistics for Rack HTTP
servers.  It is designed for preforking servers such as unicorn, but
should support any Rack HTTP server on platforms supporting POSIX shared
memory.  It may also be used as a generic scoreboard for sharing atomic
counters across multiple processes.
