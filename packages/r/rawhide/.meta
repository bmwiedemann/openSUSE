  <title>Find files using pretty C expressions</title>
  <description>Rawhide (rh(1)) lets you search for files on the command line using
expressions and user-defined functions in a mini-language inspired
by C. It's like find(1), but more fun to use.

Search criteria can be very readable and self-explanatory and/or
very concise and typeable, and you can create your own lexicon of
search terms. The output can include lots of detail, like ls(1).

You can search with file glob patterns and Perl-compatible regular
expressions (regexes). You can search by name, path, symlink target
path, body, access control list (ACL), extended attributes (EA),
and all the usual file metadata (file type, permissions, owner,
size, modification time, etc.).
