  <title>Small extensible RPKI-RTR-Client C library</title>
  <description>RTRlib is an open-source C implementation of the  RPKI/Router Protocol
client. The library allows one to fetch and store validated prefix origin
data from a RTR-cache and performs origin verification of prefixes. It
supports different types of transport sessions (e.g., SSH, unprotected TCP)
and is easily extendable.
