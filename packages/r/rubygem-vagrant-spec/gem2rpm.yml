  vagrant-spec is a both a specification of how Vagrant and its various
  components should behave as well as a library of testing helpers that let you
  write your own unit and acceptance tests for Vagrant.

  The library provides a set of helper methods in addition to RSpec matchers and
  expectations to help you both unit test and acceptance test Vagrant
  components. The RSpec components are built on top of the helper methods so
  that the test library can be used with your test framework of choice, but the
  entire tool is geared very heavily towards RSpec.
