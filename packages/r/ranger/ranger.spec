%description
Ranger is a console file manager that gives you greater flexibility and a
good overview of your files without having to leave your text console. It
visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory hierarchy on
one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right.

The default keys are similar to those of Vim, Emacs and Midnight Commander,
though ranger is easily controllable with just the arrow keys or the mouse.
