- Update to 3.0
  - RemoteBox has been ported to Gtk3.
    Review the requirements before updating to ensure your
    operating system is compatible.

  to be the last release of RemoteBox based on Gtk2 as RemoteBox is
  being ported to Gtk3.

  - Server memory bar updates changed to 58 seconds
  - Added option to bind the RDP/VNC server for a guest to a 
    specific IP or hostname.

    incorrect datatype to the API

Wed Dec 18 10:09:25 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.7 version
  - RemoteBox now requires VirtualBox 6.1.x
  - VirtualBox now requires hardware virtualization and no longer 
    supports software virtualization. Removed associated options
    from RemoteBox.
  - Removed option of setting the video side-channel quality for an
    RDP connection. This option is largely unsupported by RDP 
    clients and not particularly useful.
  - Added support for the Virtio-SCSI controller
  - Added support for the AMD PCNet-ISA/NE2100 network card
  - Added support for nested hardware virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V)
    for supported processors
  - Added toolbar buttons in the VMM to create new hard disk 
    images, new floppy disk images (from 360K to 2.88MB) and move 
    media to new locations
  - Newly created floppy disk images can be optionally 
    pre-formatted with FAT12
  - Added a menu option when attached storage for creating a new
    floppy disk image and automatically attaching it
  - Added option to specify MAC address policy when importing an
    appliance
  - Added options to specify MAC address policy and include ISO
    files when exporting an appliance
  - Added options to Keep disk UUIDs, specify MAC policy and keep
    disk names when cloning a guest
  - Added OS icon for Windows 2019 64bit
  - Rewrote the copy and disk conversion code, should be cleaner
    and faster
  - Creating a new guest, now uses the ApplyDefaults API call which
    was broken in previous versions of VirtualBox. This allows 
    a lot of code cleanups and faster guest creation
  - Fixed incorrect URL on About window
  - Various code cleanups

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added option to select between Video and Audio, Video Only or 
  Audio Only when screen capturing

  extensions

  however, you cannot connect to the guest with RDP/VNC without a 
  virtual graphics card.
- Added support for setting the emulated serial UART type
- The Audio Input and Audio Output options can now also be set 
  while the guest is running
- Added support to the VMM (Virtual Media Manager) for compaction 
  of hard disk images to reduce their physical size

  Manager dialog accessible from the file menu

  additional decals
- To work around a VirtualBox bug, when changing a shared folder 
  the guest settings are now explicitly saved. This includes 
  adding, editing and deleting
- Optimised a lot of the settings retrieval code which should 
  improve latency especially for those on slower systems and 
  networks.
- Fixed the Edit Shared Folder dialog not correctly showing a 
  share's Permanent Status, when editing the shared folder.
- Various code cleanups
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 20 18:38:51 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.5 version
  - RemoteBox now only pops up a VirtualBox Extensions warning 
    dialog on login, for server operating systems that have them 
    available but the extension pack
    is not installed. Currently this is Linux, Solaris, Windows and 
    MacOS X. Others such as FreeBSD will just get a warning in the 
    message log as there are no VirtualBox extensions.
  - Added support for setting the Audio driver of a guest when 
    using a FreeBSD server
  - Improved the code which automatically adds the guest addition 
    ISO to the VMM on login which should prevent an error if the 
    server does not provide a guest additions ISO
  - Added support for VNC. If your server has the VNC extension 
    pack installed, you can use VNC to connect to the guest 
    displays instead of RDP. You must install a VNC client on your 
    RemoteBox machine and configured it as appropriate in your 
    preferences. TigerVNC is the default client
  - The guest display icon now shows whether the server expects 
    a VNC or RDP connection when opening the display of guests.
  - Added option to change the floppy drive type to 360k, 720k, 
    1.44MB, 2.88MB, 15.6MB and 63.5MB.
  - Added a button to assist with the automatic generation of 
    serial port paths
  - Fixed a bug causing the port path setting to be reset with the 
    defaults
  - Fixed audio support for Solaris servers. The SolAudio driver is 
    non functional in VirtualBox and has been replaced with OSS.

reports this as a valid minimum, the guest won't start.

Thu Apr  2 17:25:35 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Manually symlink the duplicate icon between /usr/share/icons and
  /usr/share/RemoteBox. This allows us, contrary to the use of
  fdupes, to define that we want the real file in /usr/share/icons,
  which is a requirement for Application containerisation (the icon
  needs to be extractable from a defined location for host system
  integration).
