Sun Feb  9 15:53:27 UTC 2025 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to 3.4
  * This release is really to address a major RDP display issue
  * Set RDP auth method to negotiate when creating new guests 
    (quick fix for the remote display not opening on newly created guests)
  * Changes to the xfreerdp, rdesktop and remmina presets to increase 
    compatibility
  * IMPORTANT: With RemoteBox 3.4 if you still have a guest that won't open 
    it's display. Simply Edit it's settings, go to Display->Remote Display 
    then press save. This will update some internal settings

- renamed RemoteBox-3.3_fix-env-script-interpreter.patch to 
  fix-env-script-interpreter.patch

- dropped remotebox.pdf as the only official documentation is now the website

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 30 11:30:58 UTC 2024 - Christian Galeffi <chri@gallochri.com>

-Update to 3.3
 *RemoteBox now requires VirtualBox 7.1.x.
 *Updated OS icons.
 *Added support for VirtioSound Audio Controller.
 *Implemented refresh function for guest logs, the button was 
  available but actually did nothing.
 *Changed the default freerdp client preset. VirtualBox now issues 
  self-signed certs on RDP connections, the new default ignores 
  certificate verification as RemoteBox cannot prompt you.
 *Added Remmina as a VNC/RDP client preset.
 *Significant work on removing dependence on Glade and GTKBuilder.
 *VirtualBox now uses self-signed certs on RDP connections. 
  You will need to reset your RDP settings in the RemoteBox 
  Preferences -> Guest Display Tab, by selecting a preset.
 *RemoteBox 3.3 requires the Perl module Time-HiRes to be installed 
  if not already.
 *RemoteBox 3.3 should run on ARM based Macs fine, but using ARM 
  based Macs as the server is NOT supported.

- Update to 3.2
  - RemoteBox now requires VirtualBox 7.0.x

        TPM v1.2
        TPM v2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 30 14:40:28 UTC 2022 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.1
  - Changed the RemoteBox logo
  - Various minor GUI tweaks
  - Added button to save the message log to a text file. Might be
    useful for debugging purposes.
  - Fixed: Regression introduced in 3.0 caused Connection Profiles
    dialog to essentially stop working correctly, potentially
    losing existing profiles in the process.
  - Fixed: Regression introduced in 3.0 meant that NAT rules were
    not shown for IPv4 and IPv6 networks
  - Fixed column sorting in the VMM (Virtual Media Manager)
  - Fixed various list selection bugs. The get_selected() method
    under GTK3 returns both the model and the iterator, not just
    the iterator as with GTK2
  - RemoteBox is no longer bundled with a PDF manual. Documentation
    is now exclusively maintained on the RemoteBox web site.

Thu Dec 23 11:56:21 UTC 2021 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.0
  - RemoteBox has been ported to Gtk3.
    Review the requirements before updating to ensure your
    operating system is compatible.

  The changes don't really justify a release however this is likely
  to be the last release of RemoteBox based on Gtk2 as RemoteBox is
  being ported to Gtk3.
  - Removed hearbeat option as it's no longer required
  - Server memory bar updates changed to 58 seconds
  - Added option to bind the RDP/VNC server for a guest to a 
    specific IP or hostname.

    incorrect datatype to the API

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 19 20:53:35 UTC 2020 - chri@gallochri.com

  - VirtualBox now requires hardware virtualization and no longer 
    supports software virtualization. Removed associated options
    from RemoteBox.

    RDP connection. This option is largely unsupported by RDP 
    clients and not particularly useful.

  - Added support for nested hardware virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V)

    media to new locations
  - Newly created floppy disk images can be optionally 
    pre-formatted with FAT12
  - Added a menu option when attached storage for creating a new
    floppy disk image and automatically attaching it
  - Added option to specify MAC address policy when importing an
    appliance

    files when exporting an appliance
  - Added options to Keep disk UUIDs, specify MAC policy and keep
    disk names when cloning a guest
  - Added OS icon for Windows 2019 64bit
  - Rewrote the copy and disk conversion code, should be cleaner
    and faster
  - Creating a new guest, now uses the ApplyDefaults API call which
    was broken in previous versions of VirtualBox. This allows 
    a lot of code cleanups and faster guest creation
  - Fixed incorrect URL on About window
  - Various code cleanups

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 17 12:38:15 UTC 2019 - Richard Brown <rbrown@suse.com>

- The Audio Input and Audio Output options can now also be set 
  while the guest is running

  additional decals
- To work around a VirtualBox bug, when changing a shared folder 
  the guest settings are now explicitly saved. This includes 
  adding, editing and deleting
- Optimised a lot of the settings retrieval code which should 
  improve latency especially for those on slower systems and 
  networks.
- Fixed the Edit Shared Folder dialog not correctly showing a 
  share's Permanent Status, when editing the shared folder.
- Various code cleanups
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 20 18:38:51 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.5 version
  - RemoteBox now only pops up a VirtualBox Extensions warning 
    dialog on login, for server operating systems that have them 
    available but the extension pack
    is not installed. Currently this is Linux, Solaris, Windows and 
    MacOS X. Others such as FreeBSD will just get a warning in the 
    message log as there are no VirtualBox extensions.
  - Added support for setting the Audio driver of a guest when 
    using a FreeBSD server
  - Improved the code which automatically adds the guest addition 
    ISO to the VMM on login which should prevent an error if the 
    server does not provide a guest additions ISO
  - Added support for VNC. If your server has the VNC extension 
    pack installed, you can use VNC to connect to the guest 
    displays instead of RDP. You must install a VNC client on your 
    RemoteBox machine and configured it as appropriate in your 
    preferences. TigerVNC is the default client
  - The guest display icon now shows whether the server expects 
    a VNC or RDP connection when opening the display of guests.
  - Added option to change the floppy drive type to 360k, 720k, 
    1.44MB, 2.88MB, 15.6MB and 63.5MB.
  - Added a button to assist with the automatic generation of 
    serial port paths
  - Fixed a bug causing the port path setting to be reset with the 
    defaults
  - Fixed audio support for Solaris servers. The SolAudio driver is 
    non functional in VirtualBox and has been replaced with OSS.

reports this as a valid minimum, the guest won't start.

Thu Apr  2 17:25:35 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Manually symlink the duplicate icon between /usr/share/icons and
  /usr/share/RemoteBox. This allows us, contrary to the use of
  fdupes, to define that we want the real file in /usr/share/icons,
  which is a requirement for Application containerisation (the icon
  needs to be extractable from a defined location for host system
  integration).
