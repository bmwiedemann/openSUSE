%description
Puma is a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for
Ruby/Rack applications. Puma is intended for use in both development and
production environments. It's great for highly concurrent Ruby implementations
such as Rubinius and JRuby as well as as providing process worker support to
support CRuby well.
