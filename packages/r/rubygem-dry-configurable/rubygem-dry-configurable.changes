updated to version 0.14.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 0.14.0 2022-01-14
  
  
  ### Changed
  
  - Settings defined after an access to `config` will still be made available on that `config`. (#130 by @timriley)
  - Cloneable settings are cloned immediately upon assignment. (#130 by @timriley)
  - Changes to config values in parent classes after subclasses have already been created will not be propogated to those subclasses. Subclasses created _after_ config values have been changed in the parent _will_ receive those config values. (#130 by @timriley)
  
  [Compare v0.13.0...v0.14.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-configurable/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0)
  
  ## 0.13.0 2021-09-12
  
  
  ### Added
  
  - Added flags to determine whether to warn on the API usage deprecated in this release (see "Changed" section below). Set these to `false` to suppress the warnings. (#124 by @timriley)
  
    ```ruby
    Dry::Configurable.warn_on_setting_constructor_block false
    Dry::Configurable.warn_on_setting_positional_default false
    ```
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - Fixed `ArgumentError` for classes including `Dry::Configurable` whose `initializer` has required kwargs. (#113 by @timriley)
  
  ### Changed
  
  - Deprecated the setting constructor provided as a block. Provide it via the `constructor:` keyword argument instead. (#111 by @waiting-for-dev & @timriley)
  
    ```ruby
    setting :path, constructor: -> path { Pathname(path) }
    ```
  - Deprecated the setting default provided as the second positional argument. Provide it via the `default:` keyword argument instead. (#112 and #121 by @waiting-for-dev & @timriley)
  
    ```ruby
    setting :path, default: "some/default/path"
    ```
  - [BREAKING] Removed implicit `to_hash` conversion from `Config`. (#114 by @timriley)

updated to version 0.12.1
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 0.12.1 2021-02-15
  
  
  ### Added
  
  - Settings may be specified with a `cloneable` option, e.g.
  
  ```ruby
  setting :component_dirs, Configuration::ComponentDirs.new, cloneable: true
  ```
  
  This change makes it possible to provide “rich” config values that carry their own
  configuration interface.
  
  In the above example, `ComponentDirs` could provide its own API for adding component
  dirs and configuring aspects of their behavior at the same time. By being passed to
  the setting along with `cloneable: true`, dry-configurable will ensure the setting's
  values are cloned along with the setting at all the appropriate times.
  
  A custom cloneable setting value should provide its own `#initialize_copy` (used by
  `Object#dup`) with the appropriate logic. (@timriley in #102)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - Only `#initialize` instance method is prepended, leaving the rest of the instance
  methods to be included as normal again. This allows classes including
  `Dry::Configurable` to override instance methods with their own methods as required
  (@adam12 in #103)
