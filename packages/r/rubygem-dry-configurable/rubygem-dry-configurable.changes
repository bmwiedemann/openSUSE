  ## 0.16.1 2022-10-13

Mon Oct 10 13:03:10 UTC 2022 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

updated to version 0.16.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 0.16.0 2022-10-08
  
  
  ### Added
  
  - Support for custom config classes via `config_class:` option (#136 by @solnic)
  
    ```ruby
    extend Dry::Configurable(config_class: MyConfig)
    ```
  
    Your config class should inherit from `Dry::Configurable::Config`.
  - Return `Dry::Core::Constants::Undefined` (instead of nil) as the value for non-configured settings via a `default_undefined: true` option (#141 by @timriley)
  
    ```ruby
    extend Dry::Configurable(default_undefined: true)
    ```
  
    You must opt into this feature via the `default_undefined: true` option. Non-configured setting values are still `nil` by default.
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - Remove exec bit from version.rb (#139 by @Fryguy)
  
  ### Changed
  
  - Improve memory usage by separating setting definitions from config values (#138 by @timriley)
  
    Your usage of dry-configurable may be impacted if you have been accessing objects from `_settings` or the internals of `Dry::Configurable::Config`. `_settings` now returns `Dry::Configurable::Setting` instances, which contain only the details from the setting's definition. Setting _values_ remain in `Dry::Configurable::Config`.
  - Use Zeitwerk to speed up load time (#135 by @solnic)

updated to version 0.15.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 0.15.0 2022-04-21
  
  
  ### Changed
  
  - The `finalize!` method (as class or instance method, depending on whether you extend or include `Dry::Configurable` respectively) now accepts a boolean `freeze_values:` argument, which if true, will recursively freeze all config values in addition to the `config` itself. (#105 by @ojab)
  
    ```ruby
    class MyConfigurable
      include Dry::Configurable
  
      setting :db, default: "postgre"
    end
  
    my_obj = MyConfigurable.new
    my_obj.finalize!(freeze_values: true)
    my_obj.config.db << "sql" # Will raise FrozenError
    ```
  - `Dry::Configurable::Config#update` will set hashes as values for non-nested settings (#131 by @ojab)
  
    ```ruby
    class MyConfigurable
      extend Dry::Configurable
  
      setting :sslcert, constructor: ->(v) { v&.values_at(:pem, :pass)&.join }
    end
  
    MyConfigurable.config.update(sslcert: {pem: "cert", pass: "qwerty"})
    MyConfigurable.config.sslcert # => "certqwerty"
    ```
  - `Dry::Configurable::Config#update` will accept any values implicitly convertible to hash via `#to_hash` (#133 by @timriley)

updated to version 0.14.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 0.14.0 2022-01-14
  
  
  ### Changed
  
  - Settings defined after an access to `config` will still be made available on that `config`. (#130 by @timriley)
  - Cloneable settings are cloned immediately upon assignment. (#130 by @timriley)
  - Changes to config values in parent classes after subclasses have already been created will not be propogated to those subclasses. Subclasses created _after_ config values have been changed in the parent _will_ receive those config values. (#130 by @timriley)
  
  [Compare v0.13.0...v0.14.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-configurable/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0)
  
  ## 0.13.0 2021-09-12
  
  
  ### Added
  
  - Added flags to determine whether to warn on the API usage deprecated in this release (see "Changed" section below). Set these to `false` to suppress the warnings. (#124 by @timriley)
  
    ```ruby
    Dry::Configurable.warn_on_setting_constructor_block false
    Dry::Configurable.warn_on_setting_positional_default false
    ```
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - Fixed `ArgumentError` for classes including `Dry::Configurable` whose `initializer` has required kwargs. (#113 by @timriley)
  
  ### Changed
  
  - Deprecated the setting constructor provided as a block. Provide it via the `constructor:` keyword argument instead. (#111 by @waiting-for-dev & @timriley)
  
    ```ruby
    setting :path, constructor: -> path { Pathname(path) }
    ```
  - Deprecated the setting default provided as the second positional argument. Provide it via the `default:` keyword argument instead. (#112 and #121 by @waiting-for-dev & @timriley)
  
    ```ruby
    setting :path, default: "some/default/path"
    ```
  - [BREAKING] Removed implicit `to_hash` conversion from `Config`. (#114 by @timriley)

Thu Jun 24 17:18:22 UTC 2021 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

updated to version 0.12.1
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 0.12.1 2021-02-15
  
  
  ### Added
  
  - Settings may be specified with a `cloneable` option, e.g.
  
  ```ruby
  setting :component_dirs, Configuration::ComponentDirs.new, cloneable: true
  ```
  
  This change makes it possible to provide “rich” config values that carry their own
  configuration interface.
  
  In the above example, `ComponentDirs` could provide its own API for adding component
  dirs and configuring aspects of their behavior at the same time. By being passed to
  the setting along with `cloneable: true`, dry-configurable will ensure the setting's
  values are cloned along with the setting at all the appropriate times.
  
  A custom cloneable setting value should provide its own `#initialize_copy` (used by
  `Object#dup`) with the appropriate logic. (@timriley in #102)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - Only `#initialize` instance method is prepended, leaving the rest of the instance
  methods to be included as normal again. This allows classes including
  `Dry::Configurable` to override instance methods with their own methods as required
  (@adam12 in #103)
