  ## 0.12.1 2021-02-15
  
  
  ### Added
  
  - Settings may be specified with a `cloneable` option, e.g.
  
  ```ruby
  setting :component_dirs, Configuration::ComponentDirs.new, cloneable: true
  ```
  
  This change makes it possible to provide “rich” config values that carry their own
  configuration interface.
  
  In the above example, `ComponentDirs` could provide its own API for adding component
  dirs and configuring aspects of their behavior at the same time. By being passed to
  the setting along with `cloneable: true`, dry-configurable will ensure the setting's
  values are cloned along with the setting at all the appropriate times.
  
  A custom cloneable setting value should provide its own `#initialize_copy` (used by
  `Object#dup`) with the appropriate logic. (@timriley in #102)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - Only `#initialize` instance method is prepended, leaving the rest of the instance
  methods to be included as normal again. This allows classes including
  `Dry::Configurable` to override instance methods with their own methods as required
  (@adam12 in #103)
