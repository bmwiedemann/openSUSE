  <title>Relativistic Kinematics (RK)</title>
  <description>This package provides a C++ double precision implementation of several basic geometric entities and transformations: points in 3d, directions in 3d (unit vectors), 3-vectors, points in 4d, 4-vectors, rotations, linear transformations, and boosts. The main purpose of the package is representing 4-momenta of relativistic particles and related formulae.</description>
