- updated to version 2.0.0

  * Breaking changes:
    * Digest authentication support is now deprecated, as it relies on
      digest authentication support in rack, which has been deprecated
      (Jeremy Evans #294)
    * `Rack::Test::Utils.build_primitive_part` no longer handles array
      values (Jeremy Evans #292)
    * `Rack::Test::Utils` module methods other than `build_nested_query`
      and `build_multipart` are now private methods (Jeremy Evans #297)
    * `Rack::MockSession` has been combined into `Rack::Test::Session`,
      and remains as an alias to `Rack::Test::Session`, but to keep some
      backwards compatibility, `Rack::Test::Session.new` will accept a
      `Rack::Test::Session` instance and return it (Jeremy Evans #297)
    * Previously protected methods in `Rack::Test::Cookie{,Jar}` are now
      private methods (Jeremy Evans #297)
    * `Rack::Test::Methods` no longer defines `build_rack_mock_session`,
      but for backwards compatibility, `build_rack_test_session` will call
      `build_rack_mock_session` if it is defined (Jeremy Evans #297)
    * `Rack::Test::Methods::METHODS` is no longer defined
      (Jeremy Evans #297)
    * `Rack::Test::Methods#_current_session_names` has been removed
      (Jeremy Evans #297)
    * Headers used/accessed by rack-test are now lower case, for rack 3
      compliance (Jeremy Evans #295)
    * Frozen literal strings are now used internally, which may break
      code that mutates static strings returned by rack-test, if any
      (Jeremy Evans #304)

  * Minor enhancements:
    * rack-test now works with the rack main branch (what will be rack 3)
      (Jeremy Evans #280 #292)
    * rack-test only loads the parts of rack it uses when running on the
      rack main branch (what will be rack 3) (Jeremy Evans #292)
    * Development dependencies have been significantly reduced, and are
      now a subset of the development dependencies of rack itself
      (Jeremy Evans #292)
    * Avoid creating multiple large copies of uploaded file data in
      memory (Jeremy Evans #286)
    * Specify HTTP/1.0 when submitting requests, to avoid responses with
      Transfer-Encoding: chunked (Jeremy Evans #288)
    * Support `:query_params` in rack environment for parameters that
      are appended to the query string instead of used in the request
      body (Jeremy Evans #150 #287)
    * Reduce required ruby version to 2.0, since tests run fine on
      Ruby 2.0 (Jeremy Evans #292)
    * Support :multipart env key for request methods to force multipart
      input (Jeremy Evans #303)
    * Force multipart input for request methods if content type starts
      with multipart (Jeremy Evans #303)
    * Improve performance of Utils.build_multipart by using an
      append-only design (Jeremy Evans #304)
    * Improve performance of Utils.build_nested_query for array values
      (Jeremy Evans #304)

  * Bug fixes:
    * The `CONTENT_TYPE` of multipart requests is now respected, if it
      starts with `multipart/` (Tom Knig #238)
    * Work correctly with responses that respond to `to_a` but not
      `to_ary` (Sergio Faria #276)
    * Raise an ArgumentError instead of a TypeError when providing a
      StringIO without an original filename when creating an
      UploadedFile (Nuno Correia #279)
    * Allow combining both an UploadedFile and a plain string when
      building a multipart upload (Mitsuhiro Shibuya #278)
    * Fix the generation of filenames with spaces to use path
      escaping instead of regular escaping, since path unescaping is
      used to decode it (Muir Manders, Jeremy Evans #275 #284)
    * Rewind tempfile used for multipart uploads before it is
      submitted to the application
      (Jeremy Evans, Alexander Dervish #261 #268 #286)
    * Fix Rack::Test.encoding_aware_strings to be true only on rack
      1.6+ (Jeremy Evans #292)
    * Make Rack::Test::CookieJar#valid? return true/false
      (Jeremy Evans #292)
    * Cookies without a domain attribute no longer are submitted to
      requests for subdomains of that domain, for RFC 6265
      compliance (Jeremy Evans #292)
    * Increase required rack version to 1.3, since tests fail on
      rack 1.2 and below (Jeremy Evans #293)
