Sat Feb  1 11:46:46 UTC 2020 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- update to remind-3.3.0
- FIX: rem2ps: Add a %%PageBoundingBox: document structuring convention
  comment.
- FIX: rem2ps: Ignore unknown SPECIAL-type reminders.
- IMPROVEMENT: In calendar mode ("-c" option), Remind automatically adjusts
  the width of the calendar to fit the terminal window if standard output
  is a TTY.
- IMPROVEMENT: Add JSON-based output with "remind -pp" and "remind -ppp"
  The JSON-based intermediate format preserves a lot more information
  about the original reminder, allowing back-ends more insight into
  the intent of the reminder, the recurrence used, etc.  See the documentation
  in "man rem2ps"
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind can "reverse-engineer" reminders that it creates
  using the additional information in the "remind -pp" format, so it
  doesn't create or use ugly comment blocks to delimit the reminders
  it creates.
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Add popup help to most buttons and controls.
- NEW FEATURE: Add support for $DefaultColor system variable, suggested
  by Tim Chase.
- NEW FEATURE: The "-@[n][,m]" command-line option allows colored reminders
  in Agenda Mode as well as in Calendar Mode.  It also adds support for
  terminal emulators that can handle the xterm 256-color escape sequences
  as well as the true 24-bit color escape sequences.
- CHANGE: SPECIALs are now case-insensitive.  Before, only SPECIAL COLOR
  would work.  Now you can use Special Color, special color, etc.

- defattr still needed to support SLE11-SP4 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  4 10:04:23 UTC 2020 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- update to remind-3.2.0
- removed buildroot and defattr calls from spec. No londer needed. 
- IMPROVEMENT: Add support for events spanning multiple days (with AT
  and DURATION).  Add trigeventstart() and trigeventduration()
  introspection functions; see "MULTI-DAY EVENTS" in the man page.
- IMPROVEMENT: Add introspection functions trigback(), trigdelta(),
  trigduration(), trigfrom(), trigpriority(), trigrep(),
  trigscanfrom(), trigtimedelta(), trigtimerep(), and triguntil().  See
  man page for details; thanks to Tim Chase for the suggestion.
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Use PNG images for the next month / previous
  month buttons rather than -> and <-.  Also use nice anti-aliased
  moon phase images instead of ugly blocky bitmaps.
- CHANGE: Modify addition so that previously-illegal combinations
  TIME + TIME, TIME + DATETIME and DATETIME + TIME are now allowed.
  Also allow DATETIME - TIME.  If t1 and t2 are expressions of type TIME
  and dt is an expression of type DATETIME, then the following are now
  equivalent (before, the expressions on the left-hand side would fail
  with a "Type mismatch" error.)
  t1 + t2     ==     t1                + coerce("INT", t2)
  dt + t2     ==     dt                + coerce("INT", t2)
  t1 + dt     ==     coerce("INT", t1) + dt
  dt - t2     ==     dt                - coerce("INT", t2)
- DOC FIX: Document previously-undocumented $MaxStringLen system variable
- DOC FIX: Various minor documentation fixes.
- BUG FIX: Specifying a DURATION without an AT clause results in an error.
  Before, it would be accepted but not do anything useful.
- BUG FIX: Catch potential date overflow in slide() function
- BUG FIX: Fix compile error when compiling Romanian version; eliminate
  compiler warning when compiling non-English versions.
- BUG FIX: TkRemind: Fix startup failure of TkRemind if options are at
  default. :(

Fri Aug 14 15:32:07 UTC 2015 - puzel@suse.com

- update to remind-3.1.15 
  - BUG FIX: Fix a buffer overflow found by Alexander Keller
    (CVE-2015-5957)
  - BUG FIX: Make parser reject an AT followed by more than one time.
  - BUG FIX: Make parser reject repeated delta or *repeat values.
  - NEW FEATURE: Putting the line __EOF__ in a .rem file causes
    Remind to treat it as end-of-file.
  - IMPROVEMENT: Use better PNG images for moons in the HTML display
  - BUG FIX: The "-n" command-line option should really run in
    "ADVANCE_MODE" rather than "CAL_MODE" internally; otherwise,
    the substitution sequences may be misinterpreted.
  - BUG FIX: A typo in clearing out MD5 sum context has been fixed.
  - BUG FIX: Typo in Spanish translation was fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 22 20:28:03 UTC 2013 - puzel@suse.com

- update to remind-3.1.13 
  - BUG FIX: Sunrise/Sunset calculations greatly improved thanks to
    John McGowan.  Accuracy should now be within a couple of
    minutes in most places.
  - BUG FIX: Allow specification of margins as low as 0 points in
    rem2ps, courtesy of Jonathan Kamens.
  - BUG FIX: Permit compilation with gcc 2.95 (which doesn't allow
    variable declarations after non-declaration statements in a
    block.)
  - BUG FIX: Several minor documentation errors corrected courtesy
    of Simon Ruderich.
  - BUG FIX: Spurious test harness failure was fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 11:42:15 UTC 2012 - puzel@suse.com

- update to remind-3.1.12 
  - NEW FEATURE: Many substitution sequences "%x" have an alternate
    mode denoted by "%*x".  This alternate mode leaves out
    prepositions.  For example, in English "%i" might yield "on
    01-25" while "%*i" yields only "01-25".
  - BUG FIX: The "dusk" and "dawn" calculations were completely
    wrong.  They have been fixed.  Also, sunrise/sunset calculations
    have been tweaked, so the results may be off by a minute or two
    compared to previous versions of Remind.
  - BUG FIX: For some inexplicable reason, dawn was considered to
    happen when the sun was 14 degrees below the horizon instead of
    the standard 6 degrees for Civil Dawn.  This has been fixed.
  - BUG FIXES: Clarified the man pages and fixed some typos.
  - BUG FIX: Add THROUGH to the remind.vim syntax highlighting file.
  - ENHANCEMENT (?): Allow SPECIAL COLOR to be spelled SPECIAL
    COLOUR.
  - BUG FIX: Apply minor Debian cleanups reported by Kurt B. Kaiser.

  - add the THROUGH keyword.  You can omit blocks of dates

    output. Note that UTF-8 strings are still not supported in
    PostScript output.
  - add support for UTF-8 line-drawing characters in calendar
    output
  - you can have multiple TAG clauses in a REM statement
  - avoid spawning long-running background processes in "make
    test"

    compilers choke.)

    in earlier versions of Remind.
  - Yom HaShoah is moved to Thursday if it would normally fall on
    a Friday. Thanks to Jonathan Kamens for pointing this out.

    special variables to make reminder files less wordy. See man page
    for details.
  - Ignore msgprefix() and msgsuffix() on RUN-type reminders.
  - Adjust Remind and Rem2PS so that SHADE specials don't obliterate
    earlier MOON specials.
  - Fix bug in SCHED calculations if Remind is started in the middle
    of a SCHED interval.
