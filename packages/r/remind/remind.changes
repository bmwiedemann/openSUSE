- NEW FEATURE: Remind: Add the NOQUEUE modifier to the REM statement for
  explicitly telling Remind not to queue a timed reminder.

- NEW FEATURE: Remind: Add soleq() function to return the DATETIME of
  solstices and equinoxes.  See $SysInclude/seasons.rem for an example
  of how to use the function.

- BUG FIX: TkRemind: Provide better error indication if showing today's
  reminders fails on startup.

- BUG FIX: Remind: Refuse to read world-writable directories.

- BUG FIX: Tests depended on the actual date of the test run.  This has
  been fixed.

- INTERNAL CHANGE: Remind: Change inappropriately-named "Julian" variables
  to "DSE" (= Days Since Epoch) since they weren't really holding true
  Julian dates.

- INTERNAL CHANGE: Add "SPDX-License-Identifier" tags to most files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Clément Bœsch.

- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: A few performance fixes, likely not even noticeable in
  most cases.

- MINOR FIXES: Fix misleading comments in the source code.

- MINOR FIX: Remove unnecessary %"...%" markers in holidays/us.rem

- MINOR FIX: Don't use the -ffat-lto-objects if we're compiling with Clang.

- MINOR FIX: Remind: Fix a broken printf-format string (need to double up on %
  to get a literal % in the output.)

- BUG FIX: Make test suite pass regardless of the date on which it is run.
  D'oh!!!

- BUG FIX: Make sure the banner gets printed each time through a "*N"
  command-line option loop.

Fri Oct 14 15:39:42 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- VERSION 4.2 Patch 0 - 2022-10-14

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Allow weekdays to be globally-omitted.  For example:

       OMIT Saturday Sunday

  globally-omits all Saturdays and Sundays.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add ansicolor() built-in function to make it easier
  to colorize reminders on the terminal.  Suggested by Tim Chase.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add several special variables related to the color
  mode: $UseVTColors, $UseBGVTColors, $Use256Colors, $UseTrueColors and
  $TerminalBackground.  Based on a suggestion by Tim Chase.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add utctolocal() and localtoutc() built-in functions.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add timezone() built-in function.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add trigtags() function per suggestion from Tim Chase.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: The $AddBlankLines system variable controls whether or
  not a blank line is added after each reminder.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: The built-in functions columns() and rows() return the
  width and height of the terminal (in character positions) respectively.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: The built-in function columns("string") returns the
  number of columns occupied by "string" on the terminal, taking into account
  double-width Unicode characters and zero-width ANSI escape sequences.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: You can add custom substitution sequences of the form
  %{name} or %*{name} that end up calling the function subst_name and using
  its return value as the replacement for the substitution sequence.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add the FUNSET command to undefine a user-defined
  function.

- NEW FILES: Add standard include files holidays/jewish.rem and
  ansitext.rem (the latter defines standard ANSI escape codes for
  changing text attributes such as bold, underline, etc.)

- NEW EXAMPLES: add examples/alignmemt.rem, examples/ansitext and
  examples/astro

- BUG FIX: remind: Make MSF correctly format UTF-8 text and text with
  embedded ANSI color-changing codes.

- BUG FIX: remind: Make ADDOMIT actually work correctly in a SATISFY-type
  REM command.  Bug found by Gunther Reißig

- BUG FIX: Convert documentation files and src/lang.h to UTF-8.  Patch
  from Jochen Sprickerhof.

- BUG FIX: Fix tests in non-UTF-8 locales.

- BUG FIX: Fix a few problems with the include/holidays/us.rem file.

- BUG FIX: remind: Fix an ancient logic error in DBufPutc that hurt
  performance.

- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: Clean up code and remove some dead code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 28 15:06:04 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- VERSION 4.1 Patch 0 - 2022-09-25

- NEW FEATURE: remind: "remind -c" now supports the MOON special, printing
  the moon phases in the calendar if the locale supports UTF-8 encoding.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: "remind -c" now supports the SHADE special.  Works
  best with the 256-color extended XTerm palette or 24-bit true-color
  terminal escape sequences.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: "remind -c" now supports the WEEK special.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: The new "stdout()" function returns a string describing
  where stdout is going.  Examples of return values are "TTY" if remind's
  output is going to terminal, "FILE" if it's redirected to a plain file,
  or "PIPE" if it's going to a pipe.  See the man page for all the details.

- NEW FEATURE: Add the "-wt" option to set the calendar width to the terminal
  width even if standard output is a pipe.  Useful for situations like this:

      remind -wt -c .reminders | less -R

- CHANGE: "make install" now no longer strips debugging symbols from the
  remind and rem2ps executables.  Use "make install-stripped" if you want
  them stripped.

- CHANGE: remind: "remind -c" highlights today's date in bold, if
  colors are enabled.

- CHANGE: Dump string values with control characters escaped.

- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Document behavior of DO and filedir() with respect
  to symbolic links.

- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Add home page link to man pages.  Suggested by Ian! D.
  Allen.

- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Make date in man pages actually be the release date.
  Include Remind version in man pages.  Also suggested by Ian! D. Allen.

- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Fix inaccuracy in how string constants were documented.

- BUG FIX: Makefiles: Pass CFLAGS at link-time so link-time optimization
  actually happens.  Pointed out by Zolan Puskas.

- BUG FIX: If the first REM command to trigger was a RUN command, the banner
  would not print.  This has been fixed.

- BUG FIX: replace deprecated 'fgrep' with 'grep -F' (Jochen Sprickerhof)

- BUG FIX: make "make test" depend on "make all" (Jochen Sprickerhof)

- BUG FIX: make "REM ... SATISFY ... MSG foo" respect $DefaultColor.  Bug
  reported by Gunther Reißig.

- BUG FIX: Don't consider IFTRIG true if we could not compute a trigger date.
  Bug noted by Gunther Reißig

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 19 07:52:25 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- VERSION 4.0 Patch 3 - 2022-08-16

- IMPROVEMENT: remind: add plain_body and calendar_body JSON keys in -pp...
  output.

- BUG FIX: tkremind: Don't create empty files called '&1' when creating
  a new reminder.

- BUG FIX: remind: Don't call signal-unsafe functions from signal handler

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  2 21:54:06 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- VERSION 4.0 Patch 2 - 2022-08-02

- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Allow more forms of OMIT as per Ian D. Allen!'s request:

               OMIT Month [THROUGH Month]
               OMIT Day Month [THROUGH Day Month]
               OMIT Day Month Year [THROUGH Day Month Year]

- BUG FIX: Make $T behave as documented, exactly like trigdate().  $T would
  return '1989-12-31' rather than 0 if the trigger date was not valid.

- BUG FIX: TkRemind: Fix resizing bug for a calendar with 6 rows.

- DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENT: Improve TkRemind documentation; document use
  of inotifywait if available. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  4 13:52:17 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- VERSION 4.0 Patch 1 - 2022-06-03

- IMPROVEMENT: Add $SuppressLRM system variable to suppress the UTF-8
  Left-to-Right mark in "remind -c" output.

- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Document the "q" sub-option to the "-p" option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  5 18:53:29 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

-  VERSION 4.0 Patch 0 - 2022-04-04

- MAJOR NEW FEATURE: remind: Remind output can effectively be
  translated into other languages at run-time.  A number of system
  variables let you translate English words to another language, and a
  mechanism for altering the substitution filter at run-time lets you
  translate its output so the results are idiomatic.  See the man page
  sections "RUN-TIME SUPPORT FOR OTHER LANGUAGES", "RUN-TIME
  MODIFICATION OF THE SUBSTITUTION FILTER" and "LANGUAGE PACKS".

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add the pad() built-in function

- NEW FEATURE: tkremind: Day numbers can be displayed left-aligned,
  centered or right-aligned.

- IMPROVEMENT: contrib/remind-conf-mode: The Emacs syntax-highlighter
  has been updated with the latest system variables and functions
  and has been made case-insensitive.

- IMPROVEMENT: remind, rem2ps: Use link-time optimization with gcc if
  possible.

- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Print better diagnostics when errors occur inside
  a user-defined function.  We now show the stack trace to make it easier
  to figure out where the error actually is.

- CHANGE: Add a "q" sub-option to the "-p", "-pp", and "-ppp" options.
  This causes Remind *not* to remove the %"...%" marker sequence from
  remind bodies.

- BUG FIX: rem2pdf: Make rem2pdf respect the --prefix ./configure flag.
  Loosely based on patch by Jonathan Kamens.

- BUG FIX: tkremind: Fix the "-m" flag, which was broken in 03.04.00.

- BUG FIX: Fix the overflow-detection functions so they work with link-time
  optimization.  The previous versions would be optimized away.

- BUG FIX: Warn if the arguments to the "-@" option are out of range.
  Problem noted by Ian! D. Allen.

- BUG FIX: Always interpret $Latitude and $Longitude input values in the
  "C" locale.  (We do accept localized input, but warn.)

- BUG FIX: Fix many spelling mistakes caught by Jens Schleusener

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 26 18:00:17 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- remind-nostrip.patch removed, no longer needed 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 20 21:22:30 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- nostrip-patch removed, does no longer apply, and no longer needed

- Version 3.4 Patch 2 - 2022-03-14

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add syntactic sugar to simplify some common
  types of reminders.  See "SYNTACTIC SUGAR FOR REM" in the remind
  man page.  Based on suggestions from Ian! D. Allen.

- CHANGE: examples/defs.rem: The examples file has been updated to use
  the newer syntactic sugar.

- CHANGE: remind: Always parse the body of REM statements to catch
  expression errors.  In the past, something like:

      REM 2025-01-02 MSG [1/0]

  would not cause a division-by-zero error except on 2025-01-02.  Now,
  the error is always caught.  NOTE POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: There may
  be edge-cases when formerly-valid remind scripts now trigger errors.
  However, this is pretty unlikely.

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add the "trig" function to allow more
  expressiveness when creating triggers.  See man page for details.

- IMPROVEMENT: tkremind: Tweak the calendar display; improve ability to
  customize colors, including supplying two built-in themes.  Based on
  patch and suggestion from Paulo (last name unknown).

- IMPROVEMENT: tkremind: TkRemind handles errors in reminders scripts
  much more unobtrusively.  Instead of popping up a modal dialog box
  with almost-unreadable error output, it discreetly notifies you of
  errors with a button that lets you view the specific error messages
  in a more readable format.

- IMPROVEMENT: examples/remind.vim: Update list of keywords in vim syntax
  highlighting file.

- IMPROVEMENT: contrib/remind-conf-mode: Update the list of keywords,
  functions and variables in the Emacs syntax-highlighting file.  Also make
  it match them case-insensitively.

- CHANGE: remind: Increase $MaxSatIter default to 1000 instead of 150.
  Computers are much faster than when I first wrote remind and they
  can handle this higher limit easily.  The higher limit also enables
  certain reasonable reminders that failed in the past because of the
  low SATISFY iteration limit.

- CHANGE: remind: The "||" operator now returns the value of the first
  non-zero operand rather than just returning 1 or 0.  Similarly, "&&"
  returns 0 if either operand is false or the value of the last
  operand if both operands are true.

     NOTE POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: Remind scripts that depend on ||
     and && always returning exactly one of 1 or 0 may need
     adjustment.

- CHANGE: The || and && operators can accept any non-STRING type as long
  as both operands have the same type.  The "false" values are defined
  as follows; true values are any other value:

     INT:      0
     TIME:     00:00
     DATE:     '1990-01-01'             (the Remind epoch)
     DATETIME: '1990-01-01@00:00'       (the Remind epoch)

- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Issue diagnostics if an UNTIL or THROUGH date
  is earlier than any possible trigger date, as well as an UNTIL date
  with a fully-specified date and no repeat ("*N").  Suggestion from
  Ian! D. Allen.

- BUG FIX: tkremind: If the same moon phase appeared twice in a month,
  TkRemind would not display the first occurrence correctly.  This has
  been fixed.

- BUG FIX: rem2pdf: Fix typos in the man page.

- BUG FIX: remind: The IF command documentation didn't reflect how it
  actually worked; now it does.

- BUG FIX: remind: Use correct UNTIL/THROUGH keyword in error message.

- BUG FIX: rem2pdf: Correct the calculation that warns about an over-full
  calendar box.  Problem noted by Jonathan Kamens.

- BUG FIX: remind: The "remind -c" output would sometimes be incorrect if
  scripts with double-wide characters were used.  This has been fixed.

- BUG FIX: remind: The "remind -c" output would sometimes be incorrect
  if right-to-left scripts were used in reminders.  This has been fixed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 23 19:37:21 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- VERSION 3.4 Patch 1 - 2022-02-23

- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: Support the INSTALL_BASE environment variable for
  installing rem2pdf in a non-standard location like your home directory.
  This is passed in to rem2pdf's Makefile at build and install time.

- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: ./configure: Add --disable-perl-build-artifacts flag
  to avoid installation of perllocal.pod and .packlist files.

- BUG FIX: tkremind: If the system date rolls over, update the display
  to correctly highlight the current date.  This worked in older versions
  of Remind, but was broken by 03.04.00.

- BUG FIX: rem2pdf: The small calendar font would sometimes be scaled
  incorrectly so the small calendar overflowed the box.  This has been
  fixed. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 13 17:39:19 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- VERSION 3.4 Patch 0 - 2022-02-10

- MAJOR CHANGE: Remind and its helpers (except for rem2ps) fully support
  UTF-8.  If your system locale is a UTF-8 locale and your terminal
  can handle UTF-8 encoding, you can enjoy full Unicode support in Remind.

- NEW FEATURE: Added a rem2pdf Remind-to-PDF converter.  It can handle
  the full UTF-8 character set and features a new PANGO special reminder
  type that lets you format the text in the PDF calendar (by changing the
  font size, color, underlining, etc.)

- NEW FEATURE: remind:  New system variables $Sunday through $Saturday
  and $January through $December let you set weekday and month names
  to whatever you like, permitting you to produce calendars in your
  local language, even if it's not one of the languages Remind supports
  by default.

- NEW FEATURE: tkremind: If rem2pdf installed, TkRemind offers you the
  choice of PDF or PostScript output in the Print dialog.

- CHANGE: remind: Increase the number of allowed "full OMITs" from 500
  to 1000.

- CHANGE: Remove the annoying code that slowed compilation and running
  on Windows and Mac OS X.  I believe the point has been made and free
  OSes have enough of a critical mass that the annoyances are
  counter-productive.

- CLEANUP: remind: C source code: Replace the LAT_DEG, LAT_MIN,
  LAT_SEC and LON_DEG, LON_MIN, LON_SEC macros with DEFAULT_LATITUDE
  and DEFAULT_LONGITUDE.

- CLEANUP: remind: C source code: Remove various unused or obsolete macros.

- BUG FIXES: Minor fixups to groff source and Makefiles courtesy of
  Jochen Sprickerhof.

- BUG FIX: Properly support formatting of double-wide characters in the
  terminal mode "remind -c" calendar.

- BUG FIX: rem2html: Document how to highlight today with a red border

- BUG FIX: rem2html: Generate and install a man page for rem2html

- BUG FIX: remind: Get rid of LAT_DEG/LAT_MIN/LAT_SEC and
  LON_DEG/LON_MIN/LON_SEC macros in favour of DEFAULT_LATITUDE and
  DEFAULT_LONGITUDE.

- IMPROVEMENT: All localized languages now use UTF-8 exclusively.
  Support for old character encodings like ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-2
  has been dropped since modern UNIXes have pretty much standardized
  on UTF-8.

- CHANGE: remind: Non-English versions of remind *no longer* accept
  non-English month- and weekday-names in trigger specifications.  This
  was a misfeature.  NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 25 18:18:20 UTC 2022 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 12 - 2022-01-24

- UPDATE: rem2html: Use JSON::MaybeXS instead of JSON::Any, since JSON::Any
  is deprecated.  NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY: If you don't have JSON::MaybeXS
  installed, you'll need to install it before trying to install or update
  rem2html

- NEW FEATURE: Add a DO command.  This is just like INCLUDE, but relative
  paths are interpreted relative to the directory containing the current
  file.  That is:

      DO somefile.rem

  is equivalent to:

      INCLUDE [filedir()]/somefile.rem

- NEW FEATURE: Add the $DefaultTDelta system variable and associated
  -tt[N] command-line option to set a default time delta for timed
  reminder without an explicit +N delta.

- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Store .tkremindrc in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tkremindrc
  or $HOME/.config/tkremindrc as per the XDG Base Directory Specification.

- BUG FIX: remind: Make the shell() built-in function respect
  $MaxStringLen

- BUG FIX: Use size_t to track the size of dynamic buffers rather than int.
  This permits Remind to read in files with lines longer than 1GB and to
  consume more than 1GB of output from the shell() command, both of which
  will surely be massively useful.  (The old limit was 1GB rather than 2GB
  because of details of the dynamic buffer resizing algorithm.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 30 15:20:00 UTC 2021 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 11 - 2021-12-30

- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Save the print dialog settings so they persist.

- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Show queue in sorted order.

- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Pass "-r" flag to inotifywait

- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Draw moon phases with Tk canvas items rather than
  using PNG images.  This lets them change color along with other TkRemind
  preferences.

- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Underline editable reminders when the pointer enters
  them; fire up the editor with either Button-1 or Button-3 for
  non-TkRemind-generated reminders.

- NEW FUNCTION: Remind: Add the isany() built-in function.

- IMPROVEMENT: rem2html: Add class names indicating number of rows in calendar

- IMPROVEMENT: remind: In -z0 mode, sleep with higher precision to ensure we
  wake as close to possible to each 1-minute boundary.

- IMPROVEMENT: rem2html: Coalesce table.rem-cal CSS into one block.  Thanks
  to Ian! D. Allen for pointing this out.

- IMPROVEMENT: examples/defs.rem: Modernize the examples and get rid of some
  cruft.

- CHANGE: Add $Latitude and $Longitude system variables.  Deprecate
  $LatDeg, $LatMin, $LatSec, $LongDeg, $LongMin and $LongSec.

- CHANGE: Test: Add "dump $" to test.rem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 30 15:04:45 UTC 2021 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- Changes to remind 

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 10 - 2021-11-30

- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Apply window and text colors to all GUI elements
  including buttons and status labels.

- NEW FEATURE: The new ADDOMIT keyword can shorten reminder files.
  The command:

      REM ...whatever... ADDOMIT MSG Foo

  behaves identically to:

      REM ...whatever... SATISFY 1
      IF trigvalid()
          OMIT [trigdate()] MSG Foo
      ENDIF

  For example, Labour Day can be displayed and omitted as follows:

      REM Mon 1 Sep SCANFROM -7 ADDOMIT MSG Labour Day

- UPDATE: Update contrib/remind-conf-mode to latest release

- CHANGE: The parser does not auto-convert numbers 90-99 to 1990-1999.  This
  was messing up things like "DURATION 90".  It also means you can no longer
  abbreviate the years 1990-1999 as 90-99.

- BUG FIX: Various documentation fixes

- BUG FIX: When switching users with the "-u" option, call initgroups()
  to properly set group membership list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 15 07:30:07 UTC 2021 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- rem2html is included, cleanup of specfile

- CHANGES TO REMIND

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 9 - 2021-10-14

- NEW FEATURE: Add "-+username" option to tell Remind to trust files owned by
  "username" and allow RUN directives in them.  Idea courtesy of Ian! D. Allen

- NEW FEATURE: Add "-u+username" variant to tell Remind to switch users to
  "username" without disabling RUN directives.  Idea courtesy of Ian! D. Allen

- CHANGE: rem2html: rem2html has been moved out of the www/ directory into
  its own rem2html/ directory.  If your system has the prerequisites
  (namely Perl, Getopt::Long and JSON::Any) then rem2html will be installed
  by "make install".

- CHANGE: Remove "cm2rem".  It was about 20 years obsolete.

- CHANGE: rem2html: Use inline data: URL images for moon images by default,
  thus producing a completely stand-alone HTML file.

- CHANGE: Remove unnecessary spaces from "remind -pp" JSON output.

- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Various man page fixes and tweaks.

- BUG FIX: rem2html: Tweak the default CSS stylesheet; more rational
  handling of rem2html command-line options.

- BUG FIX: remind: "remind -c" would sometimes highlight *two* days as
  "today"; this has been fixed.

- BUG FIX: Add a missing #ifdef...#endif and remove a C99-ism.  This once again
  allows Remind to be compiled with some very old C compilers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 14 06:33:59 UTC 2021 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- CHANGES TO REMIND

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 8 - 2021-09-13

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add INCLUDECMD command

- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add shellescape() built-in function

- BUG FIX: tkremind: TkRemind would sometimes fill in incorrect initial
  values for the reminder-editing form if you clicked on a TkRemind-created
    reminder to edit it.  This has been fixed.

- BUG FIX: tkremind: Get back better error messages from Remind if you
  try to create a reminder with an invalid date specification.

- BUG FIX: remind: Catch integer overflow if we try to evaluate $IntMin * -1

- DOC UPDATES: remind: Minor man page fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 11 08:50:47 UTC 2021 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- CHANGES TO REMIND

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 7 - 2021-05-10

- MINOR FIX: Refuse to run "make test" as root --- it would fail
  anyway with an obscure message.

- BUG FIX: Remind would sometimes compute incorrect trigger date for:
  REM Tue 29 Feb MSG ...

- BUG FIX: Remind would sometimes compute incorrect trigger date for
  a date spec like: Tue 31 2021 MSG ... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 30 21:48:24 UTC 2021 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- CHANGES TO REMIND

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 6 - 2021-03-30

- test/test.rem: Change local to en_US.utf-8 only if current locale
  is not a UTF-8 locale.

- MINOR CHANGE: Remind's arithemtic operators (+, -, *, /) give errors
  on overflow rather than silently giving the wrong answer.

- MINOR CHANGE: Add $IntMin and $IntMax system variables.

- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Document that TkRemind now requires Tcl/Tk version
  8.5 or newer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 22 08:16:00 UTC 2021 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- update to remind 3.3.5

- CHANGES TO REMIND

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 5 - 2021-01-21

- NEW FEATURE: tkremind: Add ability to change fonts and colors from
  within TkRemind "Options" dialog.

- CHANGE: tkremind: TkRemind now requires Tcl/Tk 8.5 or newer.

- CHANGE: tkremind: You can specify the location of the options
  file on the command-line if you want to use one other than ~/.tkremindrc

- CLEANUP: tkremind: Remove "Apply Options" from Options dialog; we only
  need "Save Options".

- DOC FIX: Add missing release note in 3.3.4 notes regarding
  setpagedevice patch

- DOC FIX: tkremind: Document shortcut keys.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 12 15:50:42 UTC 2021 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- update to remind 3.3.4

- CHANGES TO REMIND

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 4 - 2021-01-12

- NEW FEATURE: If "inotifywait" is installed, TkRemind uses it to refresh
  the calendar display right away when the reminders file/directory is updated.
  This makes TkRemind react almost instantly if external tools are editing
  or updating reminders.

- MINOR NEW FEATURE: rem2ps has a new '-x' option; this puts the day numbers
  on the top-left of the day's box instead of the top-right.

- MINOR FIXES: A typo in remind.1 was fixed; additional comments regarding
  UNTIL were added.

- BUG FIX: rem2ps: Call setpagedevice to set page size
  Based on a patch from Jonathan Kamens

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 13:47:55 UTC 2020 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- update to remind 3.3.3

- CHANGES TO REMIND

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 3 - 2020-11-09

- BUG FIX: Fix startup crash in TkRemind if "Show Today's Reminders on
  Startup" is enabled (which, unfortunately, is the default.)  Bug reported

- update to remind 3.3.2

- CHANGES TO REMIND

* VERSION 3.3 Patch 2 - 2020-11-08

- MINOR NEW FEATURE: Add MAYBE-UNCOMPUTABLE keyword; see the man page
  and discussion at
  https://dianne.skoll.ca/pipermail/remind-fans/2020/003745.html

- CHANGE: TkRemind always invokes Remind with the "-itkremind=1" option,
  even when printing.  NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY: This is a behavior change!
  When you print from TkRemind, we also invoke Remind with "-itkprint=1"
  so you can detect that PostScript is being generated.

- CHANGE: The maxmimum length of a variable name has been increased from
  16 characters to 64 characters.  Modern computers have plenty of memory.

- BUG FIXES: Minor documentation updates, typo fixes, clarifications, etc.

- BUG FIX: Fix calendar-drawing alignment errors when displaying UTF-8
  strings with zero-width combining characters and strings with tabs.

- BUG FIX: TkRemind would mess up placement of the WEEK special if invoked
  with the "-m" option.  This has been fixed.

- BUG FIX: TkRemind would sometimes fail with an error message when editing
  a reminder; this is because it was interpreting months 08 and 09 as
  illegal octal numbers.  This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 20 19:49:55 UTC 2020 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- update to remind 3.3.1
- CHANGE: For overlapping multi-day events, issue a reminder for the
  most *recent* event rather than the earliest event.  NOTE
  INCOMPATIBILITY: This is a behavior change!
- CHANGE: Do not convert 90-99 to 1990-1999 when parsing numbers to
  recognize years.  NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY: This is a behavior change!
- CHANGE: Revert change to -y option that included filename and line
  number in the hash.
- CHANGE: Retain newlines (produced by %_) in JSON output.
- FIX: Document $FormWidth system variable
- FIX: Highlight today's date in "remind -c" output
- FIX: Eliminate compiler warnings on Ubuntu 18.04.
- IMPROVEMENT: Allow times to be specified either in 24-hour mode
  (HH:MM or HH.MM) or AM/PM mode (HH:MMam; HH:MMpm, etc.)
- IMPROVEMENT: Allow DURATION to be specified as a time (1:30) or a
  number of minutes (90).
- IMPROVEMENT: If terminal size can be determined, set $FormWidth to
  terminal width - 8; if not, set $FormWidth to 72.
- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: Add the "ampm()" built-in function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  1 11:46:46 UTC 2020 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- update to remind-3.3.0
- FIX: rem2ps: Add a %%PageBoundingBox: document structuring convention
  comment.
- FIX: rem2ps: Ignore unknown SPECIAL-type reminders.
- IMPROVEMENT: In calendar mode ("-c" option), Remind automatically adjusts
  the width of the calendar to fit the terminal window if standard output
  is a TTY.
- IMPROVEMENT: Add JSON-based output with "remind -pp" and "remind -ppp"
  The JSON-based intermediate format preserves a lot more information
  about the original reminder, allowing back-ends more insight into
  the intent of the reminder, the recurrence used, etc.  See the documentation
  in "man rem2ps"
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind can "reverse-engineer" reminders that it creates
  using the additional information in the "remind -pp" format, so it
  doesn't create or use ugly comment blocks to delimit the reminders
  it creates.
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Add popup help to most buttons and controls.
- NEW FEATURE: Add support for $DefaultColor system variable, suggested
  by Tim Chase.
- NEW FEATURE: The "-@[n][,m]" command-line option allows colored reminders
  in Agenda Mode as well as in Calendar Mode.  It also adds support for
  terminal emulators that can handle the xterm 256-color escape sequences
  as well as the true 24-bit color escape sequences.
- CHANGE: SPECIALs are now case-insensitive.  Before, only SPECIAL COLOR
  would work.  Now you can use Special Color, special color, etc.

Sat Jan  4 10:11:59 UTC 2020 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- defattr still needed to support SLE11-SP4 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  4 10:04:23 UTC 2020 - Detlef Steuer <detlef.steuer@gmx.de>

- update to remind-3.2.0
- removed buildroot and defattr calls from spec. No londer needed. 
- IMPROVEMENT: Add support for events spanning multiple days (with AT
  and DURATION).  Add trigeventstart() and trigeventduration()
  introspection functions; see "MULTI-DAY EVENTS" in the man page.
- IMPROVEMENT: Add introspection functions trigback(), trigdelta(),
  trigduration(), trigfrom(), trigpriority(), trigrep(),
  trigscanfrom(), trigtimedelta(), trigtimerep(), and triguntil().  See
  man page for details; thanks to Tim Chase for the suggestion.
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Use PNG images for the next month / previous
  month buttons rather than -> and <-.  Also use nice anti-aliased
  moon phase images instead of ugly blocky bitmaps.
- CHANGE: Modify addition so that previously-illegal combinations
  TIME + TIME, TIME + DATETIME and DATETIME + TIME are now allowed.
  Also allow DATETIME - TIME.  If t1 and t2 are expressions of type TIME
  and dt is an expression of type DATETIME, then the following are now
  equivalent (before, the expressions on the left-hand side would fail
  with a "Type mismatch" error.)
  t1 + t2     ==     t1                + coerce("INT", t2)
  dt + t2     ==     dt                + coerce("INT", t2)
  t1 + dt     ==     coerce("INT", t1) + dt
  dt - t2     ==     dt                - coerce("INT", t2)
- DOC FIX: Document previously-undocumented $MaxStringLen system variable
- DOC FIX: Various minor documentation fixes.
- BUG FIX: Specifying a DURATION without an AT clause results in an error.
  Before, it would be accepted but not do anything useful.
- BUG FIX: Catch potential date overflow in slide() function
- BUG FIX: Fix compile error when compiling Romanian version; eliminate
  compiler warning when compiling non-English versions.
- BUG FIX: TkRemind: Fix startup failure of TkRemind if options are at
  default. :(
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 15:32:07 UTC 2015 - puzel@suse.com

- update to remind-3.1.15 
  - BUG FIX: Fix a buffer overflow found by Alexander Keller
    (CVE-2015-5957)
  - BUG FIX: Make parser reject an AT followed by more than one time.
  - BUG FIX: Make parser reject repeated delta or *repeat values.
  - NEW FEATURE: Putting the line __EOF__ in a .rem file causes
    Remind to treat it as end-of-file.
  - IMPROVEMENT: Use better PNG images for moons in the HTML display
  - BUG FIX: The "-n" command-line option should really run in
    "ADVANCE_MODE" rather than "CAL_MODE" internally; otherwise,
    the substitution sequences may be misinterpreted.
  - BUG FIX: A typo in clearing out MD5 sum context has been fixed.
  - BUG FIX: Typo in Spanish translation was fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 22 20:28:03 UTC 2013 - puzel@suse.com

- update to remind-3.1.13 
  - BUG FIX: Sunrise/Sunset calculations greatly improved thanks to
    John McGowan.  Accuracy should now be within a couple of
    minutes in most places.
  - BUG FIX: Allow specification of margins as low as 0 points in
    rem2ps, courtesy of Jonathan Kamens.
  - BUG FIX: Permit compilation with gcc 2.95 (which doesn't allow
    variable declarations after non-declaration statements in a
    block.)
  - BUG FIX: Several minor documentation errors corrected courtesy
    of Simon Ruderich.
  - BUG FIX: Spurious test harness failure was fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 11:42:15 UTC 2012 - puzel@suse.com

- update to remind-3.1.12 
  - NEW FEATURE: Many substitution sequences "%x" have an alternate
    mode denoted by "%*x".  This alternate mode leaves out
    prepositions.  For example, in English "%i" might yield "on
    01-25" while "%*i" yields only "01-25".
  - BUG FIX: The "dusk" and "dawn" calculations were completely
    wrong.  They have been fixed.  Also, sunrise/sunset calculations
    have been tweaked, so the results may be off by a minute or two
    compared to previous versions of Remind.
  - BUG FIX: For some inexplicable reason, dawn was considered to
    happen when the sun was 14 degrees below the horizon instead of
    the standard 6 degrees for Civil Dawn.  This has been fixed.
  - BUG FIXES: Clarified the man pages and fixed some typos.
  - BUG FIX: Add THROUGH to the remind.vim syntax highlighting file.
  - ENHANCEMENT (?): Allow SPECIAL COLOR to be spelled SPECIAL
    COLOUR.
  - BUG FIX: Apply minor Debian cleanups reported by Kurt B. Kaiser.

    output
  - you can have multiple TAG clauses in a REM statement

  - Yom HaShoah is moved to Thursday if it would normally fall on
    a Friday. Thanks to Jonathan Kamens for pointing this out.

    special variables to make reminder files less wordy. See man page
    for details.
  - Ignore msgprefix() and msgsuffix() on RUN-type reminders.
  - Adjust Remind and Rem2PS so that SHADE specials don't obliterate
    earlier MOON specials.
