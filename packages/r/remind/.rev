  - BUG FIX: Sunrise/Sunset calculations greatly improved thanks to
    John McGowan.  Accuracy should now be within a couple of
    minutes in most places.
  - BUG FIX: Allow specification of margins as low as 0 points in
    rem2ps, courtesy of Jonathan Kamens.
  - BUG FIX: Permit compilation with gcc 2.95 (which doesn't allow
    variable declarations after non-declaration statements in a
    block.)
  - BUG FIX: Several minor documentation errors corrected courtesy
    of Simon Ruderich.
  - BUG FIX: Spurious test harness failure was fixed.</comment>

    &quot;ADVANCE_MODE&quot; rather than &quot;CAL_MODE&quot; internally; otherwise,
    the substitution sequences may be misinterpreted.

    <comment>- update to remind 3.3.3
- CHANGES TO REMIND
* VERSION 3.3 Patch 3 - 2020-11-09
- BUG FIX: Fix startup crash in TkRemind if &quot;Show Today's Reminders on
  Startup&quot; is enabled (which, unfortunately, is the default.)  Bug reported
  by Martin Ziemer.

- update to remind 3.3.2
- CHANGES TO REMIND
* VERSION 3.3 Patch 2 - 2020-11-08
- MINOR NEW FEATURE: Add MAYBE-UNCOMPUTABLE keyword; see the man page
  and discussion at
  https://dianne.skoll.ca/pipermail/remind-fans/2020/003745.html
- CHANGE: TkRemind always invokes Remind with the &quot;-itkremind=1&quot; option,
  even when printing.  NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY: This is a behavior change!
  When you print from TkRemind, we also invoke Remind with &quot;-itkprint=1&quot;
  so you can detect that PostScript is being generated.
- CHANGE: The maxmimum length of a variable name has been increased from
  16 characters to 64 characters.  Modern computers have plenty of memory.
- BUG FIXES: Minor documentation updates, typo fixes, clarifications, etc.
- BUG FIX: Fix calendar-drawing alignment errors when displaying UTF-8
  strings with zero-width combining characters and strings with tabs.
- BUG FIX: TkRemind would mess up placement of the WEEK special if invoked
  with the &quot;-m&quot; option.  This has been fixed.
- BUG FIX: TkRemind would sometimes fail with an error message when editing
  a reminder; this is because it was interpreting months 08 and 09 as
  illegal octal numbers.  This has been fixed.</comment>

    <comment>- update to remind 3.3.4
- CHANGES TO REMIND
* VERSION 3.3 Patch 4 - 2021-01-12
- NEW FEATURE: If &quot;inotifywait&quot; is installed, TkRemind uses it to refresh
  the calendar display right away when the reminders file/directory is updated.
  This makes TkRemind react almost instantly if external tools are editing
  or updating reminders.
- MINOR NEW FEATURE: rem2ps has a new '-x' option; this puts the day numbers
  on the top-left of the day's box instead of the top-right.
- MINOR FIXES: A typo in remind.1 was fixed; additional comments regarding
  UNTIL were added.
- BUG FIX: rem2ps: Call setpagedevice to set page size

- test/test.rem: Change local to en_US.utf-8 only if current locale
  is not a UTF-8 locale.
- MINOR CHANGE: Remind's arithemtic operators (+, -, *, /) give errors
  on overflow rather than silently giving the wrong answer.
- MINOR CHANGE: Add $IntMin and $IntMax system variables.
- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Document that TkRemind now requires Tcl/Tk version
  8.5 or newer.</comment>

- CHANGES TO REMIND
* VERSION 3.3 Patch 9 - 2021-10-14
- NEW FEATURE: Add &quot;-+username&quot; option to tell Remind to trust files owned by
  &quot;username&quot; and allow RUN directives in them.  Idea courtesy of Ian! D. Allen
- NEW FEATURE: Add &quot;-u+username&quot; variant to tell Remind to switch users to
  &quot;username&quot; without disabling RUN directives.  Idea courtesy of Ian! D. Allen
- CHANGE: rem2html: rem2html has been moved out of the www/ directory into
  its own rem2html/ directory.  If your system has the prerequisites
  (namely Perl, Getopt::Long and JSON::Any) then rem2html will be installed
  by &quot;make install&quot;.
- CHANGE: Remove &quot;cm2rem&quot;.  It was about 20 years obsolete.
- CHANGE: rem2html: Use inline data: URL images for moon images by default,
  thus producing a completely stand-alone HTML file.
- CHANGE: Remove unnecessary spaces from &quot;remind -pp&quot; JSON output.
- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Various man page fixes and tweaks.
- BUG FIX: rem2html: Tweak the default CSS stylesheet; more rational
  handling of rem2html command-line options.
- BUG FIX: remind: &quot;remind -c&quot; would sometimes highlight *two* days as
  &quot;today&quot;; this has been fixed.
- BUG FIX: Add a missing #ifdef...#endif and remove a C99-ism.  This once again
  allows Remind to be compiled with some very old C compilers.</comment>

    <comment>- remind-nostrip.patch removed, no longer needed 

- Version 3.4 Patch 2 - 2022-03-14
- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add syntactic sugar to simplify some common
  types of reminders.  See &quot;SYNTACTIC SUGAR FOR REM&quot; in the remind
  man page.  Based on suggestions from Ian! D. Allen.
- CHANGE: examples/defs.rem: The examples file has been updated to use
  the newer syntactic sugar.
- CHANGE: remind: Always parse the body of REM statements to catch
  expression errors.  In the past, something like:
      REM 2025-01-02 MSG [1/0]
  would not cause a division-by-zero error except on 2025-01-02.  Now,
  the error is always caught.  NOTE POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: There may
  be edge-cases when formerly-valid remind scripts now trigger errors.
  However, this is pretty unlikely.
- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add the &quot;trig&quot; function to allow more
  expressiveness when creating triggers.  See man page for details.
- IMPROVEMENT: tkremind: Tweak the calendar display; improve ability to
  customize colors, including supplying two built-in themes.  Based on
  patch and suggestion from Paulo (last name unknown).
- IMPROVEMENT: tkremind: TkRemind handles errors in reminders scripts
  much more unobtrusively.  Instead of popping up a modal dialog box
  with almost-unreadable error output, it discreetly notifies you of
  errors with a button that lets you view the specific error messages
  in a more readable format.
- IMPROVEMENT: examples/remind.vim: Update list of keywords in vim syntax
  highlighting file.
- IMPROVEMENT: contrib/remind-conf-mode: Update the list of keywords,
  functions and variables in the Emacs syntax-highlighting file.  Also make
  it match them case-insensitively.
- CHANGE: remind: Increase $MaxSatIter default to 1000 instead of 150.
  Computers are much faster than when I first wrote remind and they
  can handle this higher limit easily.  The higher limit also enables
  certain reasonable reminders that failed in the past because of the
  low SATISFY iteration limit.
- CHANGE: remind: The &quot;||&quot; operator now returns the value of the first
  non-zero operand rather than just returning 1 or 0.  Similarly, &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;
  returns 0 if either operand is false or the value of the last
  operand if both operands are true.
     NOTE POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: Remind scripts that depend on ||
     and &amp;&amp; always returning exactly one of 1 or 0 may need
     adjustment.
- CHANGE: The || and &amp;&amp; operators can accept any non-STRING type as long
  as both operands have the same type.  The &quot;false&quot; values are defined
  as follows; true values are any other value:
     INT:      0
     TIME:     00:00
     DATE:     '1990-01-01'             (the Remind epoch)
     DATETIME: '1990-01-01@00:00'       (the Remind epoch)
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Issue diagnostics if an UNTIL or THROUGH date
  is earlier than any possible trigger date, as well as an UNTIL date
  with a fully-specified date and no repeat (&quot;*N&quot;).  Suggestion from
  Ian! D. Allen.
- BUG FIX: tkremind: If the same moon phase appeared twice in a month,
  TkRemind would not display the first occurrence correctly.  This has
  been fixed.
- BUG FIX: rem2pdf: Fix typos in the man page.
- BUG FIX: remind: The IF command documentation didn't reflect how it
  actually worked; now it does.
- BUG FIX: remind: Use correct UNTIL/THROUGH keyword in error message.
- BUG FIX: rem2pdf: Correct the calculation that warns about an over-full
  calendar box.  Problem noted by Jonathan Kamens.
- BUG FIX: remind: The &quot;remind -c&quot; output would sometimes be incorrect if
  scripts with double-wide characters were used.  This has been fixed.
- BUG FIX: remind: The &quot;remind -c&quot; output would sometimes be incorrect
  if right-to-left scripts were used in reminders.  This has been fixed.
- VERSION 3.4 Patch 1 - 2022-02-23
- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: Support the INSTALL_BASE environment variable for
  installing rem2pdf in a non-standard location like your home directory.
  This is passed in to rem2pdf's Makefile at build and install time.
- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: ./configure: Add --disable-perl-build-artifacts flag
  to avoid installation of perllocal.pod and .packlist files.
- BUG FIX: tkremind: If the system date rolls over, update the display
  to correctly highlight the current date.  This worked in older versions
  of Remind, but was broken by 03.04.00.
- BUG FIX: rem2pdf: The small calendar font would sometimes be scaled
  incorrectly so the small calendar overflowed the box.  This has been
  fixed. 
- VERSION 3.4 Patch 0 - 2022-02-10
- MAJOR CHANGE: Remind and its helpers (except for rem2ps) fully support
  UTF-8.  If your system locale is a UTF-8 locale and your terminal
  can handle UTF-8 encoding, you can enjoy full Unicode support in Remind.
- NEW FEATURE: Added a rem2pdf Remind-to-PDF converter.  It can handle
  the full UTF-8 character set and features a new PANGO special reminder
  type that lets you format the text in the PDF calendar (by changing the
  font size, color, underlining, etc.)
- NEW FEATURE: remind:  New system variables $Sunday through $Saturday
  and $January through $December let you set weekday and month names
  to whatever you like, permitting you to produce calendars in your
  local language, even if it's not one of the languages Remind supports
  by default.
- NEW FEATURE: tkremind: If rem2pdf installed, TkRemind offers you the
  choice of PDF or PostScript output in the Print dialog.
- CHANGE: remind: Increase the number of allowed &quot;full OMITs&quot; from 500
  to 1000.
- CHANGE: Remove the annoying code that slowed compilation and running
  on Windows and Mac OS X.  I believe the point has been made and free
  OSes have enough of a critical mass that the annoyances are
  counter-productive.
- CLEANUP: remind: C source code: Replace the LAT_DEG, LAT_MIN,
  LAT_SEC and LON_DEG, LON_MIN, LON_SEC macros with DEFAULT_LATITUDE
  and DEFAULT_LONGITUDE.
- CLEANUP: remind: C source code: Remove various unused or obsolete macros.
- BUG FIXES: Minor fixups to groff source and Makefiles courtesy of
  Jochen Sprickerhof.
- BUG FIX: Properly support formatting of double-wide characters in the
  terminal mode &quot;remind -c&quot; calendar.
- BUG FIX: rem2html: Document how to highlight today with a red border
- BUG FIX: rem2html: Generate and install a man page for rem2html
- BUG FIX: remind: Get rid of LAT_DEG/LAT_MIN/LAT_SEC and
  LON_DEG/LON_MIN/LON_SEC macros in favour of DEFAULT_LATITUDE and
  DEFAULT_LONGITUDE.
- IMPROVEMENT: All localized languages now use UTF-8 exclusively.
  Support for old character encodings like ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-2
  has been dropped since modern UNIXes have pretty much standardized
  on UTF-8.
- CHANGE: remind: Non-English versions of remind *no longer* accept
  non-English month- and weekday-names in trigger specifications.  This
  was a misfeature.  NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY.

    <comment>-  VERSION 4.0 Patch 0 - 2022-04-04
- MAJOR NEW FEATURE: remind: Remind output can effectively be
  translated into other languages at run-time.  A number of system
  variables let you translate English words to another language, and a
  mechanism for altering the substitution filter at run-time lets you
  translate its output so the results are idiomatic.  See the man page
  sections &quot;RUN-TIME SUPPORT FOR OTHER LANGUAGES&quot;, &quot;RUN-TIME
  MODIFICATION OF THE SUBSTITUTION FILTER&quot; and &quot;LANGUAGE PACKS&quot;.
- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add the pad() built-in function
- NEW FEATURE: tkremind: Day numbers can be displayed left-aligned,
  centered or right-aligned.
- IMPROVEMENT: contrib/remind-conf-mode: The Emacs syntax-highlighter
  has been updated with the latest system variables and functions
  and has been made case-insensitive.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind, rem2ps: Use link-time optimization with gcc if
  possible.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Print better diagnostics when errors occur inside
  a user-defined function.  We now show the stack trace to make it easier
  to figure out where the error actually is.
- CHANGE: Add a &quot;q&quot; sub-option to the &quot;-p&quot;, &quot;-pp&quot;, and &quot;-ppp&quot; options.
  This causes Remind *not* to remove the %&quot;...%&quot; marker sequence from
  remind bodies.
- BUG FIX: rem2pdf: Make rem2pdf respect the --prefix ./configure flag.
  Loosely based on patch by Jonathan Kamens.
- BUG FIX: tkremind: Fix the &quot;-m&quot; flag, which was broken in 03.04.00.
- BUG FIX: Fix the overflow-detection functions so they work with link-time
  optimization.  The previous versions would be optimized away.
- BUG FIX: Warn if the arguments to the &quot;-@&quot; option are out of range.
  Problem noted by Ian! D. Allen.
- BUG FIX: Always interpret $Latitude and $Longitude input values in the</comment>

    <comment>- VERSION 4.1 Patch 0 - 2022-09-25
- NEW FEATURE: remind: &quot;remind -c&quot; now supports the MOON special, printing
  the moon phases in the calendar if the locale supports UTF-8 encoding.
- NEW FEATURE: remind: &quot;remind -c&quot; now supports the SHADE special.  Works
  best with the 256-color extended XTerm palette or 24-bit true-color
  terminal escape sequences.
- NEW FEATURE: remind: &quot;remind -c&quot; now supports the WEEK special.
- NEW FEATURE: remind: The new &quot;stdout()&quot; function returns a string describing
  where stdout is going.  Examples of return values are &quot;TTY&quot; if remind's
  output is going to terminal, &quot;FILE&quot; if it's redirected to a plain file,
  or &quot;PIPE&quot; if it's going to a pipe.  See the man page for all the details.
- NEW FEATURE: Add the &quot;-wt&quot; option to set the calendar width to the terminal
  width even if standard output is a pipe.  Useful for situations like this:
      remind -wt -c .reminders | less -R
- CHANGE: &quot;make install&quot; now no longer strips debugging symbols from the
  remind and rem2ps executables.  Use &quot;make install-stripped&quot; if you want
  them stripped.
- CHANGE: remind: &quot;remind -c&quot; highlights today's date in bold, if
  colors are enabled.
- CHANGE: Dump string values with control characters escaped.
- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Document behavior of DO and filedir() with respect
  to symbolic links.
- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Add home page link to man pages.  Suggested by Ian! D.
  Allen.
- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Make date in man pages actually be the release date.
  Include Remind version in man pages.  Also suggested by Ian! D. Allen.
- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Fix inaccuracy in how string constants were documented.
- BUG FIX: Makefiles: Pass CFLAGS at link-time so link-time optimization
  actually happens.  Pointed out by Zolan Puskas.
- BUG FIX: If the first REM command to trigger was a RUN command, the banner</comment>

    <comment>- VERSION 4.2 Patch 1 - 2022-12-15

    <comment>- VERSION 4.2 Patch 2 - 2023-01-01
- NEW FEATURE: Remind: Add the NOQUEUE modifier to the REM statement for
  explicitly telling Remind not to queue a timed reminder.

- INTERNAL CHANGE: Remind: Change inappropriately-named &quot;Julian&quot; variables
  to &quot;DSE&quot; (= Days Since Epoch) since they weren't really holding true
  Julian dates.
- INTERNAL CHANGE: Add &quot;SPDX-License-Identifier&quot; tags to most files.</comment>

    <comment>- VERSION 4.2 Patch 9 - 2024-02-04
- CHANGE: remind: Do not attempt to guess terminal background color on
  startup.  Only obtain it as needed.  This can prevent mojibake from
  appearing on terminals that don't support the color query escape
  sequence.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Add new system variables $NumFullOmits,
  $MaxFullOmits, $NumPartialOmits and $MaxPartialOmits.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Issue a warning if someone OMITs every possible date.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: In several error messages complaining about limits
  being exceeded, include the actual limit in the error message.  Clarify
  the man page regarding limits on the number of OMITs.
- MINOR NEW FEATURE: remind:  The expression STRING * INT or INT * STRING
  is now accepted and yields a string that is INT concatenations of the
  origina STRING.  In this case, INT must be non-negative and the total
  string length can't exceed $MaxStringLen.
- DOCUMENTATION: Add &quot;Astronomical Algorithms&quot; by Jean Meeus to bibliography.
- DOCUMENTATION FIX: Update address of the Free Software Foundation in the
  license file.
- DOCUMENTATION: Note that rem2ps is deprecated and will not received any
  new features.  Further development will happen on rem2pdf.
- BUG FIX: Preserve the filename() and priority context for queued reminders.
  Previously, the filename information was lost and the priority was
  coming from uninitialized memory (yikes!).  bug found by Alexander
  Möller.
- BUG FIX: build.tk: Various minor improvements.
- BUG FIX: remind: In server mode, if we de-queue a reminder without
  triggering it, issue a &quot;NOTE queued %d&quot; message to update the
  client's notion of the queue size.
- BUG FIX: tkremind: Fix typo found by Lorenzo Bazzanini.</comment>

    <comment>* VERSION 6.1 Patch 1 - 2025-09-12
- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add the new --max-expr-complexity=n
  command-line argument.  It is possible to write expressions that use
  enormous amounts of CPU time, such as the following:
          FSET fib(n) iif(n &lt;= 2, 1, fib(n-1)+fib(n-2))
          SET a fib(100)
  That will take essentially forever to execute, but will not hit the
  built-in recursion limit.  Using a command-line argument of
  --max-expr-complexity=1000000 will terminate evaluation in a few
  dozen milliseconds on modern hardware, and should not affect
  realistic reminder scripts.  See the man page for details.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Add UTF-8-aware functions to complement the
  byte-aware functions that could give incorrect results by splitting
  a UTF-8 character sequence.  The correspondence between old and new
  functions is:
     NON-UTF-8-AWARE   UTF-8-AWARE
     ===============   ===========
     strlen            mbstrlen
     substr            mbsubstr
     index             mbindex
     char              mbchar
     asc               codepoint
  See the remind(1) man page for details.
- MINOR NEW FEATURE: remind: You can use hexadecimal integer constants
  like 0xFE12 in expressions.  This is mostly useful for using
  codepoint() since Unicode code points are often expressed in
  hexadecimal.
- BUG FIX: remind: When truncating a string when executing DUMPVARS or
  during debugging of expression evaluation, Remind could sometimes
  cut the string in the middle of a UTF-8 sequence.  This has been</comment>

    <comment>* VERSION 6.1 Patch 2 - 2025-09-19
- BUG FIX: remind: A reminder on a specific fixed date and time that
  uses the TZ feature could erroneously issue a &quot;Can't compute trigger&quot;
  error.  This has been fixed.
- CHANGE: remind: The default for --max-expr-complexity is 10,000,000
  (ten million) instead of unlimited.  This should not affect any
  real-world Remind scripts.</comment>

- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Issue a warning that SCANFROM should be used
  with ADDOMIT in cases where Remind detects a movable OMIT.
- NEW FEATURE: remind: Add $WarningLevel system variable.  This lets
  you suppress warnings added by new versions of Remind until you have
  a chance to update your remind scripts.
- BUG FIX / IMPROVEMENT: include/holidays/*.rem: Simplify the logic
  used for moving holidays before/after weekends.  Also fixes bugs
  found in the logic used to move New Year's Day.  Thanks to Nimrod
  Levy for pointing out the New Year's Day bug.
- IMPROVEMENT: include/holidays/jewish.rem: This file was reworked by
  Nimrod Levy to simplify logic and optionally add the counting of the
  Omer.
- BUG FIX: remind: &quot;remind -c&quot; would add an unnecessary blank line for
  completely-empty calendar rows if you used the &quot;-w,0,0&quot; option.
  This is now fixed.  Bug pointed out by Tim Chase.</comment>

    <comment>* VERSION 6.1 Patch 5 - 2025-10-09
- BUG FIX: remind: Yet another bug in TZ handling was fixed.  I hope this
  is the final TZ bug; the test suite has had a large number of TZ tests
  added.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: If the directory /usr/share/zoneinfo exists, Remind
  warns about time zone names that look invalid.  You can override the
  warning by prefixing your time zone name with &quot;!&quot; if you want to use
  non-file-based time zone names like &quot;UTC+0400&quot;.
- MINOR IMPROVEMENTS: A couple of man page typos were fixed.
* VERSION 6.1 Patch 4 - 2025-10-08
- BUG FIX: remind: In calendar mode, reminders that specify a TZ zone
  that is *behind* the system time zone could sometimes not show up.
  The bug has been fixed; thanks to Jin Chen for reporting it.
- CHANGE: remind: Any time Remind runs another program (for example,
  in response to REM ... RUN, the shell() command, the -k option, or
  INCLUDECMD) it connects that command's standard input to /dev/null
  so that it cannot interfere with the main Remind process's standard
  input.
- BUG FIX: remind: Don't set up an inotify file descriptor if we are
  not running in Daemon Mode.
- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: remind: When using readline to read from a
  terminal, include the line number in the Remind&gt; prompt.
- IMPROVEMENT: lang/*.rem: Suppress redefined function warnings if you
  include one language file and then later on a different one.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Make the output of &quot;make test&quot; slightly more
  verbose; color-code the PASS and FAIL results if standard output
  refers to a terminal.
- CHANGE: include/holidays/*.rem: Add %&quot;..%&quot; markers and %! %b
  suffixes to all reminders.  This prevents you from having to use the
  msgsuffix() hack if you want advance warning of holidays.</comment>

    <comment>* VERSION 06.01.08 - 2025-10-27
- BUG FIXES: tkremind: Fix many bugs with modal dialogs: Clicking too fast
  to launch them could cause error messages; closing them with the window
  manager &quot;close&quot; button rather than &quot;Cancel&quot; could cause errors.  Thanks
  to Tug Williams for finding these bugs.
- MINOR NEW FEATURE: tkremind: The &quot;Print&quot; dialog has a &quot;Show Command&quot;
  button that lets you cut-and-paste the command tkremind would have used
  for printing.  You can then customize it as you like.
- MINOR FIXES: remind: A few silly errors in the man page were fixed.
* VERSION 06.01.07 - 2025-10-23
- IMPROVEMENT: tkremind: Add a &quot;help&quot; button that pops up the TkRemind man
  page (and offers a browser for all the remind-related man pages.)
- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: rem2pdf: Leave less whitespace between the day number and
  the entries in a calendar box.
- MINOR IMPROVEMENT: make test: If hunspell is installed, check the spelling
  of *all* man pages.  Previously, some were being missed.
- DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENT: WHATSNEW: Make the version numbers in this file
  exactly match the ones reported by &quot;remind --version&quot;.  That is, we say
  &quot;06.01.07&quot; instead of &quot;Version 6.1 Patch 7&quot;.
* VERSION 06.01.06 - 2025-10-20
- NEW FEATURE: rem2pdf: Add command-line options to set colors of various
  parts of the calendar such as the gridlines, the day numbers, etc.
- NEW FEATURE: rem2pdf: Add a command-line option to make the calendar title
  into a hotlink to a URL that you supply.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Make the tzconvert() function warn about possibly
  invalid time zone names, similar to the warning issued by the TZ keyword.
- IMPROVEMENT: &quot;make test&quot;: If spellintian and hunspell are installed,
  use them to spell-check and lint the man pages and README.md file.
- PORTABILITY IMPROVEMENT: Make Remind compile on OpenIndiana (a
  Solaris derivative.)  &quot;make test&quot; fails because of deficiencies in</comment>

    <comment> * VERSION 06.02.00 - 2025-11-03
- MAJOR NEW FEATURE: TkRemind: A new &quot;View...&quot; menu lets you choose a
  calendar view from the following choices: Entire month, 1 week, 2
  weeks or 4 weeks.
- NEW FEATURE: remind: The &quot;z&quot; flag for the &quot;-c&quot; option makes Remind
  turn reminders with a &quot;Url:&quot; INFO string into clickable hyperlinks.
  Note that your terminal must support the escape sequences at
  https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda
  for this feature to work.
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: The Print dialog now allows you to preview
  (and if you wish, adjust) the command used to print a calendar.
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: The Agenda Mode window (&quot;Show Today's
  Reminders&quot;) has navigation buttons for moving back or forward one
  day at a time.
- IMPROVEMENT: TkRemind: Add many keyboard shortcuts.  All pop-up
  windows can be closed with Esc or Control-W.  Other shortcuts are
  documented in the tkremind man page.
- CHANGE: TkRemind: If you hand-edit a reminder in the &quot;Preview
  Reminder&quot; dialog box, it is marked as non-editable by TkRemind.
- CHANGE: TkRemind: Remove support for rem2ps.  All printing is now
  done using rem2pdf.
- IMPROVEMENT: remind: Improve error reporting if there's extraneous
  content after an expression.
- IMPROVEMENT: tests: test-rem was tweaked to allow testing of an
  installed Remind installation.  This work was done by Jochen
  Sprickerhof.
- IMPROVEMENT: rem2pdf: When rendering weekly calendars, reduce the
  default size when drawing moons; if a day does not have a moon
  indicator, don't leave a big gap before the first reminder entry.
- IMPROVEMENT: rem2pdf: Draw moon phases left-aligned.</comment>

    <comment>* VERSION 06.02.01 - 2025-11-10
- BUG FIX: remind: Obey $ParseUntriggered in Calendar Mode.  Before,
  $ParseUntriggered was always being treated as 1 in Calendar Mode.
- BUG FIX: TkRemind: Fix some buggy interactions between the Options
  dialog and the font chooser.
- TEST FIX: One test was consistently failing under MUSL, and it is
  not clear whether MUSL's or glibc's interpretation is correct.
  Remove that test so all tests pass under MUSL.</comment>

    <comment>- VERSION 06.02.03 - 2026-02-05
- NEW FEATURE: rem2html: Add a new --yaag option to produce a calendar
  in the &quot;year-at-a-glance&quot; format.  This format features a table with
  an entire month in each row.  Thanks to Robert Black for suggesting
  this and for helping out with the CSS.
- CHANGE: remind: If standard output is a TTY, then default
  $TerminalHyperlinks to 1
- CHANGE: remind: Increase the default value of $MaxSatIter from 1000
  to 10000, reflecting the higher speed of the new expression
  evaluation engine as well as the speed of modern CPUs.
- UPDATE: examples/remind.vim: Update the URL to point to maintained
  version.
- IMPROVEMENT: include/sun.rem: Add Wikipedia links for sunrise/sunset
- IMPROVEMENT: Add MOON, SHADE, WEEK, COLOR and COLOUR to the Emacs
  syntax highlighting keyword list.
- IMPROVEMENT: If an invalid value is assigned to a system variable,
  issue the error &quot;Invalid value for system variable&quot; rather than
  &quot;Type mismatch&quot;
- DOC FIX: Fix typo in man page
- BUG FIX: rem2html: Eliminate &quot;use of uninitialized variable&quot;
  warning.
- BUG FIX: remind: The &quot;trigbase&quot; JSON key in &quot;remind -pp&quot; output had
  an incorrectly-formatted value.  This has been fixed; thanks to
  Georg Simon for reporting this bug.</comment>
