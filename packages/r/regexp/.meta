  <title>Simple regular expressions API</title>
  <description>Regexp is a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package that was
graciously donated to the Apache Software Foundation by Jonathan Locke.
He originally wrote this software back in 1996 and it has stood up
quite well to the test of time. It includes complete Javadoc
documentation as well as a simple Applet for visual debugging and
testing suite for compatibility.</description>
