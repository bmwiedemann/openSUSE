    Added suffix libdrm to CMakeLists.txt for drm
    
    [ Upstream commit e85647f7df194aa2e3b534a959decf4037fc2835 ]
    
    Cannonical libdrm package installation results in headers installed at
    `\usr\include\libdrm`. The current CMakeLists.txt installation script
    search the headers only in `drm` suffix which is where headers are found
    in readhat base distros. I propose to add also the cannonical path
    `libdrm` also used in distros like archlinux.
