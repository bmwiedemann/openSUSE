  <title>An automated system for building LaTeX documents</title>
  <description>This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
runs just as many compilations as necessary. The module system provides a
great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user
intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, dvipdfm, pdftex,
makeindex. A good number of standard packages are supported, including
graphics/graphicx (with automatic conversion between various formats and
Metapost compilation).</description>
