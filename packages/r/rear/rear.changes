Thu Jul 14 12:55:28 CEST 2022 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 2.7
  New features, bigger enhancements,
  and possibly backward incompatible changes:
  * ReaR’s default TMPDIR is now /var/tmp (it was /tmp before)
  * Stop ReaR from possibly overwriting its own disk and
    backup drives for OUTPUT=USB and OUTPUT=RAWDISK
    via new WRITE_PROTECTED_... config variables.
  * Added initial LUKS2 support.
  * Overhauled RAID code with changed RAID related entries
    in /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
  * Initial preliminary basic support to automatically resize an
    active last partition on RAID0 and RAID1 disks to be able to
    automatically resize RAID0 and RAID1 arrays.
  * Automatically shrink LVs if needed during "rear recover"
    on a bit smaller replacement disk.
  * Support to wipe disks before recreating
    partitions/volumes/filesystems/...
    see the new DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED in
    /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
  * Error out when files greater or equal ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT
    should be included in the ISO.
  * Rsync OUTPUT_URLs are now properly supported with BACKUP=RSYNC.
    The special handling of an rsync OUTPUT_URL with OUTPUT=PXE
    is removed and the URL is interpreted as in all other cases.
  * RAWDISK: Add local rescue partition installation capability.
  * Allow setting a PBA-specific firmware configuration via the
    new OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES configuration variable.
  * Support OPAL 2 self-encrypting NVMe disk drives.
  * OPALPBA: Provide a permanent unlocking mode via
    OPAL_PBA_UNLOCK_MODE (see default.conf).
  * POWER architecture (ppc64) support for BACKUP=DP.
  * NSR enhancement for point-in-time recovery with
    EMC Networker client.
  * BACKUP=NBKDC: Enhanced ReaR backup and restore to also work
    with NovaStor DataCenter 8.0 and higher.
  * Support for systemd and parallel restore with
    Data Protector BACKUP=DP.
  * Now “rear format” has in addition to the ‘–efi’ switch
    a ‘–bios’ switch. If none is given (i.e. by default)
    it will now do hybrid formatting.
  * Overhauled serial console support code via SERIAL_CONSOLE_...
    config variables (see default.conf for details).
  * Support for HTTP sources when using PXE via new PXE_HTTP_URL
  * In /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf changed ISO_VOLID from
    "RELAXRECOVER" to "REAR-ISO" and accordingly ‘RELAXRECOVER’
    in variable names was replaced. In particular
    USER_INPUT_RELAXRECOVER_SYMLINK_TARGET was renamed as
    USER_INPUT_ISO_SYMLINK_TARGET so only the new name will work.
  A detailed list can be found in the rear-release-notes.txt file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 23 09:48:51 CEST 2020 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 2.6
  New features, bigger enhancements
  and possibly backward incompatible changes:
  * Initial preliminary first basic support for IBM Z architecture
    "s390x" (a.k.a. "z Systems", "System/390", "s390").
  * New BACKUP=CDM method to support
    Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM).
  * New use-case for BLOCKCLONE backup method with the
    "multiple backups" approach for a more complex LUKS setup
    with different passphrases or keys.
  * Initial draft implementation of the new 'mountonly' workflow
    to use ReaR as rescue system, therein mount the filesystems
    of the target system so that one can manually repair it.
  * Enable creation of non consecutive partitions.
  * Improved handling of partition label type for multipath disks
    plus including of multipath disks in backup.
  * Enhanced default AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp )
    to automatically exclude temporarily mounted things
    (e.g. USB devices).
  * Now we have CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="true" by default.
    See the explanation in default.conf what that means.
  * Replaced grub-mkimage with grub-mkstandalone when building
    GRUB2 image for using GRUB2 as recovery system UEFI bootloader.
  A detailed list can be found in the rear-release-notes.txt file.
- Version upgrade to 2.5
  New features, bigger enhancements
  and possibly backward incompatible changes:
  * Enhancements to better support mmcblk/eMMC disks.
  * Now there is in default.conf MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
    which means that now by default all kernel modules
    get included in the recovery system.
  * The new verify script .../950_verify_disklayout_file.sh
    verifies the disklayout.conf file that is created
    by "rear mkrescue/mkbackup".
  * Basic support for EFISTUB booting.
  * The whole 'rear dump' output format need to be changed
    to improve it to clearly distinguish array elements.
  * Now during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" md5sums are created
    for all regular files in in the recovery system. During
    recovery system startup it verifies those md5sums.
  * GRUB2 installation on x86 and ppc64le architecture
    was completely rewritten and enhanced.
  A detailed list can be found in the rear-release-notes.txt file.
- Version upgrade to 2.4
  New features, bigger enhancements
  and possibly backward incompatible changes:
  * Major rework and changed default behaviour how ReaR behaves
    in migration mode when partitions can or must be resized
    to fit on replacement disks with different size. The new
    default behaviour is that only the partition end value of the
    last partition on a disk (and therefore its partition size)
    may get changed.
  * Network setup was completely reworked to support bonding,
    bridges, vlans and teaming.
  * Initial (limited) support for certain ARM based hardware. It
    should work with Raspberry Pis, most TI and Allwinner devices.
  * Simplified and enhanced TSM restore
    plus first draft of TSM backup.
  * EMC Avamar support has been added.
  * Duplicity backup has been seriously enhanced.
  * Support for TCG Opal 2-compliant self-encrypting disks
    and RAWDISK output.
  A detailed list can be found in the rear-release-notes.txt file.

  cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1656

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 20 16:56:11 CET 2017 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 2.3
  (fate#323930 fate#323931 fate#323932)
  New features and bigger enhancements:
  * First steps towards running ReaR unattended in general
  * SSH support in the recovery system is now secure by default
  * Improved verification of the recovery system contents
  * ReaR is now more safe against recreating on a wrong disk
  Possibly backward incompatible changes:
  * In addition to STDERR now also STDOUT is redirected into the
    log file so that when programs prompt via STDOUT to get input
    the program's prompt could be no longer visible to the user
  * There are no longer private SSH keys in the recovery system by
    default and a RSA key is generated from scratch when starting
    sshd during recovery system startup so that it does no longer
    work by default to use SSH in the recovery system via the
    SSH keys that exist on the original system
  * By default it is now fatal when 'ldd' reports a 'not found'
    library for any file in a /bin/ or /sbin/ directory in the
    recovery system so that now 'rear mkrescue/mkbackup'
    may fail where it had (blindly) worked before
  * Improved autodetection when the disk layout looks ambiguous.
    Now 'rear recover' switches by default more often into the
    MIGRATION_MODE where manual disk layout configuration happens
    via several user dialogs so that by default 'rear recover'
    shows more often user dialogs
  A detailed list can be found in the rear-release-notes.txt file.

Wed Jul 26 12:58:25 CEST 2017 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 2.2
  A detailed list can be found in the rear-release-notes.txt file.
  Changes include (excerpt):
  * Let the get_disk_size() function retry several times to be more
    fail-safe when udev needs some time until device files appear.
    This introduces the new generic helper function retry_command()
    plus the new config variables REAR_SLEEP_DELAY and
    REAR_MAX_RETRIES. For details see default.conf and
    lib/layout-functions.sh (issue #1370)
  * ReaR failed to continue due incorrect check of presence
    of USB device (REAR-000) in /proc/mounts, despite foregoing
    script (060_mount_NETFS_path.sh) did mounting of this device
    (issue #1415)
  * Add missing privilege separation dir to start sshd
    on Debian 9 (issue #1381)
  * Redirect rsync verbose output to backup log (issue #1387)
  * Load storage controllers in rescue system in same order
    as on host system (issue #1384):
    Copy over modules from initrd on SUSE LINUX and prevent sorting
    of MODULES_LOAD array to keep the order intended.
  * Add /yaboot to ISO_FILE when running SUSE ppc64 (issue #1414)
  * Add SSL cert directories so we can interact
    with Google Cloud Storage (issue #1402)
  * Modified the "unattended" into "automatic" with ISO_DEFAULT
    required for automated recovery tests (issue #1397)
  * Use the original fds when ReaR was launched (which are now
    saved as fd6, fd7, and fd8 for stdin, stdout, and stderr
    respectively) for actually intended user input and user output.
    To keep backward compatible behaviour all old deprecated usage
    of '>&8' is converted into '>/dev/null' but /dev/null usage
    in general should be cleaned up later (issues #887, #1395)
  * Added new generic UserInput and UserOutput plus LogUserOutput
    functions that are intended to replace current user input
    functionality that calls select or read directly.
    For the next ReaR version 2.3 it is planned to also
    redirect stdout into the log file in addition to stderr
    (issues #885, #1366, #1398, #1399)
  * The 'make rpm' now relies on 'make srpm' which creates
    the src.rpm package first. This src.rpm package can then
    be easily copied to another computer to rebuild a rpm package
    from it without needed the sources itself (or git checkout)
    (issue #1389)
  * Replaced some perl regexp with grep native extended regexp
    (issue #1376)
  * Introducing SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER variable in default.conf
    This variable should enable users booting with Secure Boot,
    to use whatever custom signed boot loader they like, and
    removes hard coded entry "shim.efi" from ReaRs code
    (issue #1374)
  * Enhanced and cleaned up making ISO on POWER (ppc64/ppc64le).
    Now the backup can be stored in the ISO (via BACKUP_URL=iso...)
    and even multiple ISOs work on POWER now (issues #697, #1383)
  * Create multipath.conf only during migration (from non-mulitpath
    to multipath), and always copy /etc/multipath/bindings to the
    TARGET_FS_ROOT (issues #1382, #1393)
- Version upgrade to 2.1
  A detailed list can be found in the rear-release-notes.txt file.
  Changes include (excerpt):
  * Support for Grub2 installation with software RAID1 on Linux
    on POWER (ppc64/ppc64le) (issue #1369)
  * REBUILD_INITRAMFS variable was introduced.
    The new default.conf setting REBUILD_INITRAMFS="yes" rebuilds
    the initramfs/initrd during "rear recover" to be more on the
    safe side. With REBUILD_INITRAMFS="" the old behaviour
    can still be specified (issue #1321)
  * ISO_RECOVER_MODE=unattended mode (issue #1351) - required
    for automated ReaR testing with OUTPUT=ISO
  * MODULES variable supports now special values like
    'all_modules', 'loaded_modules', 'no_modules'
    (issues #1202, #1355)
  * Include systemd/network to preserve
    "Predictable Network Interface Names" (issue #1349)
  * Various improvements regarding multipath
    (issues #1190, #1309, #1310, #1311, #1314, #1315, #1324,
     #1325, #1328, #1329, #1344, #1346)
  * Show OUTPUT variables in rear dump (issue #1337)
  * Added support for "grub PXE style" via PXE_CONFIG_GRUB_STYLE
    and PXE_TFTP_IP on non x86 platform (issue #1339)
  * Try 'wipefs -force' and use 'dd' as fallback to better
    clean up disk partitions (issue #1327)
  * Reorganized "finalize" scripts ordering and cleanup of the
    PPC bootloader installation (issue #1323)
  * Avoid long default wait in 'dig' when DNS servers are not set
    (issue #1319)
  * Fail-safe calculations in partitioning code
    (issues #1269, #1307)
  * Improved support on ppc/ppc64/ppc64le architectures
    (issues #1178, #1311, #1313, #1322)
  * Define hostname in both /etc/HOSTNAME and /etc/hostname
    in rescue image (for Arch) (issue #1316)
  * Rename network interface when MAC not present in udev
    (issue #1312)
  * Added support for 'nano' editor (in addition to 'vi')
    (issues #1298, #1306)
  * mmcblk disk types are now supported (issues #1301, #1302)
  * NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES variable was introduced
    to restore file capabilities in a proper way (issue #1283)
  * Added required libs and files for 'curl' with HTTPs
    by default (issues #1267, #1279)
  * More precise XFS file system creation during rear recover
    (issues #1208, #1213, #1276)
  * DRLM management and security improvements (issue #1252)
  * Improved BOOTLOADER support (issue #1242)
  * DRLM support for multiple backups via multiple config files
    (issue #1229)
  * FIRMWARE_FILES support to exclude firmware files
    in rescue image to reduce the size of image (issue #1216)
  * Enable SELinux in the rescue image for tar internal
    backup method if BACKUP_SELINUX_DISABLE=0 (issue #1215)
  * BOOT_OVER_SAN is now fully supported
    (issues #1190, #1309, #1314, #1315, #1325, #1329, #1344)
  * NVME disks are now fully supported (issue #1191)
  * Some initial basic support for new backup type ZYPPER
    was added (issues #1085, #1209)
  * Finding UEFI boot loaders on non standard places
    (issues #1204, #1225, #1293)
  * The USB UEFI partition size USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE for kernel
    image has been increased from 100 to 200 MB (issue #1205)
  * REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION variable was introduced to specify
    initrd compression (e.g. 'lzma' for PPC64)
    (issues #1142, #1218, #1290)
  * New backup type BLOCKCLONE was added to backup
    non-Linux partitions (e.g. Windows NTFS partitions)
    (issues #1078, #1162, #1172, #1180)
  * Bareos 16.2 is now supported (issue #1169)
  * New USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE and
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PARAMS variables
    were added (issue #1217)
  * Improved the USB backup selection menu during the recovery
    via USB (issue #1166)
  * USB_SUFFIX variable was introduced to align backup on USB
    with backup on NFS (issues #1164, #1160, #1145)
  * Forbid incremental backup to work on BACKUP_URL=usb://
    (issue #1146)
  * The USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt setting is now honered
    while formatting the USB disk (issue #1153)
- Version upgrade to 2.0
  Backward incompatible change: ReaR 2.00 introduced the 3-digits
  scripts instead of the 2-digits script. This means all scripts
  must begin with 3 digits, e.g. 010-my-script.sh instead
  of 10-my-script. Therefore, if you wrote your own scripts
  make sure to renumber these.
  A detailed list can be found in the rear-release-notes.txt file.
  Changes include (excerpt):
  * Bareos support: add missing directory /var/run/bareos
    in recovery system (issue #1148)
  * Forbid BACKUP_URL=usb for BACKUP_TYPE=incremental/differential
    (issues #1141 and #1145)

    while tar backup restore (issue #1116)
  * Implement simulation mode with simulation with the workflows
    validate and shell (issue #1098)
  * Update 11-multiple-backups.adoc : Multiple backups are
    in general not supported for BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
    or BACKUP_TYPE=differential (issues #1074 and #1123)
  * Using RUNTIME_LOGFILE in all scripts as needed (issue #1119)
  * New Backup method was added - BORG
    (issues #1030, #1037, #1046, #1048, #1118)
  * Multiple backups are now possible (issues #1088, #1102, #1096)
    see the documentation page (New)

    This was required for RHEL 7 (issue #650)
  * Check via NSR if the ISO image is not obsolete (issue #653)
  * Added ebiso support within rear (required for UEFI booting
    with SLES 11 & 12 (issue #657)
  * FDR/Upstream (BACKUP=FDRUPSTREAM) (NEW!) (issue #659)
- SLE11-ext3-example.conf, SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf,
  and SLE12-btrfs-example.conf are now provided in the
  upstream sources.
- SLE12-SP1-btrfs.patch and rear1172a-gpt_sync_mbr.patch
  are obsolete because it is now implemented in the upstream
  sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 15:00:49 CET 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Create a separate directory /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/ for
  example config files, see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/681
  and install the SUSE example config files there - i.e.:
  /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-ext3-example.conf
  /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf
  /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 28 15:27:59 CET 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- rear1172a-gpt_sync_mbr.patch adds support for the
  SUSE specific gpt_sync_mbr partitioning
  see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544
  (bsc#950610).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 13:02:44 CEST 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Enhanced SLE12-SP1-btrfs.patch so that for mounted btrfs
  subvolumes that have the 'no copy on write' attribute set
  those btrfs subvolumes are recreated with that attribute set
  (by using 'chattr' on the btrfs subvolume directory),
  see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556
  (bsc#946006 fate#318701).
- Enhanced SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf so that also lsattr is
  in the recovery system (useful but not strictly required).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 11:04:18 CEST 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version 1.17.2.a is rear 1.17.2 with SLE12-SP1-btrfs.patch that
  makes it work specifically for the default btrfs structure
  in SLE12-SP1, see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556
  (bsc#946006 fate#318701).
- SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf is an example for SLE12-SP1
  with default btrfs subvolumes that gets installed
  as /usr/share/rear/conf/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf
- Warning for users who upgrade Relax-and-Recover (rear):
  Users who already use it must re-validate that their
  particular disaster recovery procedure still works.
  See in particular "Version upgrades" at
  http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery
  Automatic version upgrades are not possible in practice.
  The user must explicitly specify his intended rear version.
  For one product like SLE11 or SLE12 we provide several versions
  in parallel so that users where version N does not support their
  particular needs can upgrade to version M but on the other hand
  users who have a working disaster recovery procedure with
  version N do not need to upgrade. Therefore the package name
  contains the version and all packages conflict with each other
  to avoid that an installed version gets accidentally
  replaced with another version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  7 12:42:05 CEST 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Update to version 1.17.2
  * Fixed the NTP startup script (issue #641)
  * Fixed the vfat label issue (issue #647)
  * Improved the DUPLICITY method with finding all required
    libraries and python scripts
  * Added the /run directory to the list of recreating missing
    directories (issue #619)
  * Fix issue with USB disk and rsync as internal backup
    program (issue #645)
  * Fix rsync restore: -anchored invalid rsync option (issue #642)
  * A new variable was introduced NSR_POOLNAME (issue #640)
  * Replaced almost all temporary files from /tmp/ to $TMP_DIR/
    (issue #607)
    Related to security recommendations for Fedora and RHEL:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1239009 (f22)
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1238843 (rhel 7.2)
  * In script 27_hpraid_layout.sh added the missing
    HPSSACLI_BIN_INSTALLATION_DIR variable to the COPY_AS_IS
    array (issue #630)
  * Syslinux version > 5.00 is now supported (ISO and USB output)
    works on Debian 8, Ubuntu 15.04 (issue #624)
  * Bail out when syslinux/modules are not found in lib/
    bootloader-functions.sh (issues #467 and #596)
    You could also define a variable SYSLINUX_MODULES_DIR if rear
    cannot find it automatically (should not be necessary)
  * Support was added for SLES11 on PPC64 hardware
    (issues #616 and #628)
  * Support was added for new hardware - PPC64LE - RHEL
    and Ubuntu (issue # 627)
  * FIX the hashed password (SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD variable) and
    added a missing library libfreeblpriv3 (issue #560)
  * Insert a 3 seconds sleep after a volume group restauration
    to give udevd or systemd-udevd time to create needed devices
    (issue #608 and #617)
  * Variable MANUAL_INCLUDE=YES has been introduced to work with
    array BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE (issue #597)
  * Add new variable NSR_DEFAULT_POOL_NAME (defaulting to Default)
    to use a different default pool name.
    Renamed the RETENTION_TIME variable to NSR_RETENTION_TIME
    (issue #640)
  * new document 10-integrating-external-backup.adoc which
    explains the steps to take for a new backup integration
    into rear
  * All AsciiDoc documentation changed extention
    from .txt to .adoc
- Known restrictions on openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise
  (in general see https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery):
  * rear 1.17.2 will not work with default btrfs on SLES12-SP1
    because support for btrfs in rear explicitly excludes
    snapshot subvolumes but on SLES12-SP1 what is mounted
    at '/' will be a btrfs snapshot subvolume (issue #556)
  * rear 1.17.2 does not work with UEFI because of various
    different reasons (issues #588 #585 #583 #229 #214)
  * rear does not support partitions of type 'gpt_sync_mbr'
    aka. 'hybrid (synced) MBR' (issue #544)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 15:55:49 CEST 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Use "ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64 ppc64le" instead
  of "BuildArch: noarch" in the spec file.
  rear contains only bash scripts plus documentation so that
  on first glance it could be "BuildArch: noarch" but actually
  it is not "noarch" because it only works on those architectures
  that are explicitly supported. Of course the rear bash scripts
  can be installed on any architecture just as any binaries can be
  installed on any architecture. But the meaning of architecture
  dependent packages should be on what architectures they will
  work. Therefore only those architectures that are actually
  supported are explicitly listed. This avoids that rear can
  be "just installed" on architectures that are actually
  not supported (e.g. ARM or IBM z Systems).
  Furthermore for some architectures it requires architecture
  dependent packages (like syslinux for x86 and x86_64)
  so that rear must be architecture dependent.
  See the GitHub issue https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/629

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 30 13:57:05 CEST 2015 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Update to version 1.17.1
  * Removed the plain password in the logs (and output) coming
    from BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY to avoid crib (issue #568)
  * Mount vfat file system without special mount options
    seems to work much better then with these options in recovery
    mode, therefore, we do not use these anymore (especially
    for /boot/efi) (issue #576)
  * Elilo support has been added for SLES
    (not fully tested yet) - issue #583
  * Grub2 rescue menu has been added (enable this feature
    with GRUB_RESCUE=y) - issue #589
  * splitted script 31_include_uefi_tools.sh in two pieces:
    31_include_uefi_tools.sh: to grab the UEFI tools (as long
    as /boot/efi is mounted), and 32_include_uefi_env.sh: to dig
    deeper into the configuration when UEFI is active
    (related to issue #214). This is necessary to have to UEFI
    tools on SLES 11/12 where we cannot create an UEFI bootable
    ISO image. We must boot in BIOS mode, and need the UEFI tools
    to make the system bootable over UEFI.
  * It is now possible to format an USB disk with a vfat and ext3
    partition (for UEFI booting) - issue #593
      rear -v format -- --efi /dev/<usbdevice>
    However, UEFI booting from an USB disk has not been
    implemented yet (sponsoring?).
  * Simplified the code for ext* fs and added StopIfError calls
    to prevent divide by zero during recovery (issue #598)
  * Syslinux version >6 requires some special handling due to
    splitting up the package (Ubuntu 15.04) (issue #584)
  * Debian 8 support added with ISO booting with latest syslinux
    release as well (issues #596, #599 and #600)
  * Changed the behavior of SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD - now saved as MD5
    hash password, but backwards compatibility is still respected
    (issue #560)
  * For EMC NetWorker server/client we added some exclude items
    to COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_NSR (issue #571)
  * Removed the Warning message from main rear script as it was
    misleading (issues #563 and #564)
  * output/ISO/Linux-i386/80_create_isofs.sh: make sure
    ISO_FILES[@] are copied to isofs directory (issue #569)
- SLE11-ext3-example.conf is an example for SLE11
  with default ext3 filesystem that gets installed as
  /usr/share/rear/conf/SLE11-ext3-example.conf
- SLE12-btrfs-example.conf is an example for SLE12
  with default btrfs subvolumes that gets installed
  as /usr/share/rear/conf/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf
- Have config(noreplace) also for all files in /usr/share/rear/
  to avoid that RPM package update overwrites user edited files
  because Relax-and-Recover (rear) is meant to be adapted and
  enhanced by the user according to his particular needs
  (see http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery).
- Added rear-rpmlintrc to filter the following false positives
  rpmlint warning messages:
  * non-etc-or-var-file-marked-as-conffile
    because config(noreplace) is intentionally for all files
    in /usr/share/rear/ (see above)
  * systemd-service-without-service_del_preun
    systemd-service-without-service_del_postun
    systemd-service-without-service_add_pre
    systemd-service-without-service_add_post
    because the systemd unit files in /usr/share/rear/skel/
    are not meant to be used in the running system.
    They are used to build the rear recovery system ISO image.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 15 19:42:07 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.17.0
  * rear 1.17 introduced a new stage directory (init) which
    is called before any workflow. Can be used for extra
    initialization code, custom configurations and other stuff
    that should happen each time that ReaR is used (was added
    especially for DRLM as plugin for their DRLM variables)
    (issue #557)
  * RHEL 5 could not mount NFS share as portmap daemon was not
    started yet. Reason was that script
    verify/NETFS/default/08_start_required_daemons.sh
    was executed after the mount test instead of before.
    (issue #547)
  * RHEL 6 on PPC64 architecture has problems with seclabel mount
    option. There was a fix which cuts the seclabel mount option
    (as rear is by default not using SELinux) (issue #545)
  * Disaster Recovery Linux Manager (DRLM) is a new Open Source
    project to centrally manage Disaster Recovery for Linux.
    ReaR 1.17 adds support for DRLM with a new configuration
    option DRLM_MANAGED=y (issue #522)
  * Adding /etc/crypto-policies/ when openssl is requested
    (prep/NETFS/default/09_check_encrypted_backup.sh) - required
    for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179239
    (issue #523)
  * Introduced USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER in default.conf file and
    modified all the involved scripts to follow the logic
    (issue #214)
  * Archicture PPC64 has been enhanced (partition recognition
    issue #536, console #537)
  * TSM restore filespace has been enhanced (issue #535)
  * Correct the usage of set -e and StopIfError function
    (issue #534, #541)
  * With BACKUP_TYPE=incremental disable variable
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY (mutual exclusive with this mode)
    (issue #143)
  * Increased to start variable from 32768 to 2097152 in script
    10_include_partition_code.sh (issue #492)
  * Adding /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf (Ubuntu) to rear image
    when found (issue #520)
  * When using /etc/rear/mappings/ip_addresses IPADDR/cidr
    must be translated into IPADDR and NETMASK (for RHEL 5 and 6)
    (issue #460)
  * mdadm layout code was changed in RHEL 7; code to deal with it
    (issue #518)
  * Adding missing driver xhci_hcd to GNU/Linux.conf (issue #519)
  * Adding findmnt command to GNU/Linux.conf file; request
    from https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908854
  * BTRFS code has been rewritten by J. Meixner to get
    SUSE rear116 fork back into our master tree of rear. BTRFS is
    now properly recreated on Fedora 20 and 21 and on SLES 12 and
    openSUSE 13 (issue #233, #497, #538) See also
    https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908854
  * Enhanced the systemd start-up of udev daemons which is
    different on Fedora 20 and 21 (issue #507, #531)
  * BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="anchored" became a default option
    in default.conf (issue #475)
  * Fixed an issue with auto-detection of the client name
    in BAREOS (issue #542)
  * Ubuntu 14.04 did not detect /dev/sda automatically - added
    upstart script 99-makedev.sh to create missing block devices
    like sda (issue #446)
  * New script
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/34_false_blacklisted.sh
    added as work-around. Sometimes we might see the HP Smart
    Storage Array disk listed as a multipath device. Most likely
    this device was not blacklisted in the blacklist section of
    the /etc/multipath.conf file (do not forget to rebuilt the
    initial ramdisk after this) e.g.
    falsempathdev=$( multipath -l | grep "HP,LOGICAL" | awk '{print $1}' )
    # mpatha
  * Added a systemd service script for SEP Sesam to start sesam
    client automatically (issue #498)
  * Disk Layout Generation with HP SmartArray with more than
    one Logical Drive correction introduced by issue #208
    (issue #455)
  * OUTPUT_URL=null was added to avoid 2 ISO images on the local
    system (issue #501, #419)
  * Fix drbd restore code so it can handle multiple volumes in
    single resource (issue #495)
  * Function get_device_name was enhanced to properly translate
    /dev/vg/lv to /dev/mapper/vg-lv (issue #494)
  * Fixed the "lvm wait yes" problem (issue #493)
  * Device name conflict when grep disklayout file without proper
    space (issue #491)
  * Several fixes with mdadm code
    (issue #480, #489, #490, #508, #539)
  * Several fixes in the 10_include_partition_code.sh script
    (issue #487, #492)
  * Being a bit more careful when deleting the outputfs directory
    when rear finishes (issue #465)
  * Add a new config option USE_STATIC_NETWORKING (issue #488)
  * Resolving library search with duply (issue #482)
  * Improved the RPM package build for SLES, removed
    the lsb requirement (issue #479)
  * Integrated the patch skip_sysconfig_kernel_if_not_exist.diff
    from SUSE (issue #477)
  * Debian 7 reference to grub.conf was corrected (issue #473)
  * Debian packing was improved (issue #474, #484)
  * Commercial backup solution Galaxy 10 support added to rear
    (issue #471)
    Also, point in time recovery was implemented (issue #472)
  * Fixed the error "unary operator expected with BACKUP_TYPE"
    (issue #422)
  * lvm release 2.02.72 had already the knowledge
    of norestorefile (issue #462)
  * Add prefix $OUTPUT_PREFIX to all PXE related files
    (issue #464)
  * 55-migrate-network-devices.sh: fixed type with /sys/class/net
    (issue #459)
  * Removed Get_Start_Date function with Netbackup because
    (depending on backup strategy) it led to partial restore
    only (issue #456)
  * 26_crypt_layout.sh: fixed issue when cypher contains :
    (issue #425)
  * 55-migrate-network-devices.sh: rebuild the array instead
    of unset (issue #452)
  * skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup : change uname -n
    by $HOSTNAME to avoid short/long hostname problems
    (issue #439)
  * Added a mkdir for $VAR_DIR/output if dir does not exist
    (issue #440)
  * 95_check_missing_programs.sh to find REQUIRED_PROGS before
    proceeding (issue #418)
  * Added a fix for autorizing and recognizong the boot flag
    in the partition (issue #443)
  * udev showing error message during startup (issue #442)
  * Prevent "ntpd -q" from waiting forever if, for example,
    no network is available, by killing it after 10 seconds
    (issue #438)
  * Several improvements around duply and duplicity
    [Debian related] (issues #426, #478)
  * 95_copy_result_files.sh uses now [*] instead of [@] with
    array (issue #431)
  * New variable introduced for TSM in default.conf file
    called LANG_RECOVER (issue #424)
  * Added Pre check script for removing older releases first
    during upgrade (RPM - issue #361)
  * Prevent udev rule rewrites if systemd-udevd is running
    issue #405
  * Fix "Networker backup fails if pool name contains spaces"
    (issue #427 and #429)
  * Fix the "More than 128 partitions is not supported" problem
    (issue #373 and #428) during recreating the partition layout
  * A new configuration option, USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y, will
    cause statically configured network settings to be applied
    even when USE_DHCLIENT is in effect (issue #447).
- Remove rear-release-notes.txt-1.16; rear-release-notes.txt has
  been updated
- Remove traditional_style_for_bash_3.diff; merged on upstream
  release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 13 12:28:52 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Provide also the other documentation ("make install" only
  installs the man page).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  9 14:48:24 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.16 from upstream (fate#316508)
  that has in particular VLAN tagging support (fate#317032).
  For details see the rear-release-notes.txt file.
  Warning for users who upgrade Relax-and-Recover (rear):
  Users who already use it must re-validate that their
  particular disaster recovery procedure still works.
  See in particular "Version upgrades" at
  http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery
- bug-859436_40_restore_with_tsm.sh.diff is obsolete
  because the issue is fixed in the uptream sources.
- rear-release-notes.txt-1.16 replaces the outdated
  doc/rear-release-notes.txt from rear-1.16.tar.gz.
- traditional_style_for_bash_3.diff replaces bash 4.x syntax
  with traditional style for bash 3.x if bash 3.x is used
  (i.e. up to openSUSE:11.1 and SLE11 where we have bash 3.x)
  where the test in the build environment assumes that the
  same bash major version is also used by the end-user in his
  runtime environment but even if the end-user had upgraded
  his bash it should not matter because bash 3.x syntax
  should also work for bash 4.x.
- Added an explicit os.conf to not depend on LSB dependencies
  to avoid calling "lsb_release" in config-functions.sh
  that might result inconsistent values (bnc#877042).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  7 17:23:08 CET 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Added "Requires: lsb-release" because rear calls "lsb_release"
  in /usr/share/rear/lib/config-functions.sh (bnc#861871).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  7 12:08:12 CET 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Cleanup of the LSB RPM requirements (bnc#861871):
  Replaced "Requires: lsb" by explicitly requiring
  only those RPM packages that are mandatory for rear
  (in particular when a binary is called in a script)
  because "Requires: lsb" would require much too much,
  see https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=807747#c4
  "A distribution is LSB Certified or LSB compliant if and only if
   the distribution provides all requirements as outlined in the
   specification."
  Accordingly the lsb RPM requires tons of stuff that is not
  needed by rear (in particular various graphical libraries,
  sound stuff, printing stuff, and so on).
- Replaced rear-1.15.tar.gz with the current one from upstream at
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/1.15/rear-1.15.tar.gz
  that contains exactly same files but the tarball differs
  (probably it was re-packed at upstream) and that causes
  failures of our automated factory-auto check scripts like:
  "download_files is configured to fail when the upstream file
   is different then the committed file".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 13:00:39 CET 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.15 from upstream (fate#316508).
  For details see the rear-release-notes.txt file.
- bug-859436_40_restore_with_tsm.sh.diff fixes recovery
  with TSM (Tivoli Storage Manager) since version 6.4 that
  results in an error message "ANS1102E" as fixed upstream
  in https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/356 (bnc#859436).
- Warning for users who upgrade from rear 1.10.0
  (e.g. when upgrading from SUSE Linux Enterprise 11):
  Rear 1.15 has many new features and fundamental changes.
  In particular the filesystem creation is totally different
  (via the so called "layout workflow" instead of the old
  "dr workflow" that has been removed in rear 1.14).
  Users who already use rear must completely re-validate that
  their particular disaster recovery procedure still works.
  See in particular "Version upgrades" at
  http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 12 08:30:00 UTC 2013 - werner@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  5 16:16:09 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Require mkisofs instead of genisoimage, as we plan to switch to
  it. (rear works both /usr/bin/mkisofs and /usr/bin/genisoimage)
- Avoid UUOC: better deletion strategy for gitignore

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    RPM upgrade problems
  * add OS_MASTER_* variables to define a parent distro,
    e.g. Fedora for CentOS
  * remove Linux-x86_64 and map it to Linux-i386 to remove
    a lot of symlinks pointing to directories
