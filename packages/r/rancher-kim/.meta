  <title>kim - The Kubernetes Image Manager</title>
  <description>kim is a Kubernetes-aware CLI that will install a small builder backend consisting of a BuildKit daemon bound to the Kubelet's underlying containerd socket (for building images) along with a small server-side agent that the CLI leverages for image management (think push, pull, etc) rather than talking to the backing containerd/CRI directly. kim enables building images locally, natively on your k3s cluster.</description>
