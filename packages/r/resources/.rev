- Update to version 1.5.0

      interface was added or removed
    - App icons were not shown for user-wide installed Flatpaks

    - Resources can now monitor connected batteries
    - CPU usage normalization can now be toggled off
    - Total read and write stats for drives
  + Improvements
    - Graph colors have been revamped to avoid low contrast
      situations and improve consistency within views

      standard shortcuts
    - More stability when performance statistics could not be
      determined
    - Some entries in the settings dialog now have subtitles
