- Update to v1.2.0:
  * Security audit completed by Trail of Bits found no major concerns
  * Ceph: Added a new "crash collector" daemon to send crash telemetry
    to the Ceph dashboard, support for priority classes, and a new
    CephClient resource to create user credentials

    1.11 to 1.12.
  * Device filtering is now configurable for the user by adding an
    environment variable
    + A new environment variable DISCOVER_DAEMON_UDEV_BLACKLIST is
      added through which the user can blacklist the devices
    + If no device is specified, the default values will be used to
      blacklist the devices
  * The topology setting has been removed from the CephCluster CR. To
    configure the OSD topology, node labels must be applied.
  * See the OSD topology topic. This setting only affects OSDs when
    they are first created, thus OSDs will not be impacted during
    upgrade.
  * The topology settings only apply to bluestore OSDs on raw devices.
    The topology labels are not applied to directory-based OSDs.
  * Creation of new Filestore OSDs on disks is now deprecated.
    Filestore is in sustaining mode in Ceph.
    + The storeType storage config setting is now ignored
    + New OSDs created in directories are always Filestore type
    + New OSDs created on disks are always Bluestore type
    + Preexisting disks provisioned as Filestore OSDs will remain as
      Filestore OSDs
  * Rook will no longer automatically remove OSDs if nodes are removed
    from the cluster CR to avoid the risk of destroying OSDs
    unintentionally. To remove OSDs manually, see the new doc on OSD
    Management
