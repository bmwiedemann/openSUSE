The Rook Operator has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods -l "app=rook-ceph-operator"

                                **** CREATING A CEPH CLUSTER ****
*************************************************************************************************
After confirming the Rook Operator is running properly, the Ceph cluster can be deployed through
YAML files which describe the desired state of the cluster. Sample YAML configuration files are
included in the 'rook-k8s-yaml' package provided with SUSE Enterprise Storage 7. If installed
(on an admin workstation or CaaSP master node) the sample YAML files can be found in
the /usr/share/k8s-yaml/rook/ceph directory structure.

Further documentation can be found in the 'Deploying and Administering Ceph on SUSE CaaS Platform'
guide. This is under active development, but can be seen at the following URL:

   https://susedoc.github.io/doc-ses/master/single-html/ses-rook/

NOTE: The sample configuration files can serve as templates for production deployments. Whether
creating entirely new configuration files or modifying the provided samples, ensure the following
requirements are met:

 - The CephCluster resource must be customized to meet deployment needs.
 - The CephCluster must be deployed in its own namespace (samples default to 'rook-ceph').
   - At this time, only one Ceph cluster per Kubernetes cluster is supported.
 - Role Based Access Control (RBAC) roles and role bindings must be configured.
   - This helm chart includes the required RBAC configuration to create a CephCluster CRD
      in the same namespace.
 - Any disk devices added to the cluster must be empty (no filesystem or partitions).
   - Disk devices must be referenced using their devnode name (e.g. '/dev/sdb' or '/dev/xvde')
