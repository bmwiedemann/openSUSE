  ## Rails 7.0.4 (September 09, 2022) ##
  
  *   Fixes proxy downloads of files over 5MiB
  
      Previously, trying to view and/or download files larger than 5mb stored in
      services like S3 via proxy mode could return corrupted files at around
      5.2mb or cause random halts in the download. Now,
      `ActiveStorage::Blobs::ProxyController` correctly handles streaming these
      larger files from the service to the client without any issues.
  
      Fixes #44679

  *   Don't stream responses in redirect mode

      Previously, both redirect mode and proxy mode streamed their
      responses which caused a new thread to be created, and could end
      up leaking connections in the connection pool. But since redirect
      mode doesn't actually send any data, it doesn't need to be
      streamed.

  *   Revert the ability to pass `service_name` param to `DirectUploadsController` which was introduced
      in 7.0.0.
  
      That change caused a lot of problems to upgrade Rails applications so we decided to remove it
      while in work in a more backwards compatible implementation.
  
      *Gannon McGibbon*
  
  *   Allow applications to opt out of precompiling Active Storage JavaScript assets.
