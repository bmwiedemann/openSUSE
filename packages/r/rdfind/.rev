    <comment>Add rdfind

Rdfind is a program that finds duplicate files. It is useful for compressing
backup directories or just finding duplicate files. It compares files based on
their content, NOT on their file names.</comment>

    <comment>- use gcc 13 for releases &lt; 1600
- run autoconf to fix upstream autoconf bug
- update to 1.7.0:
  * Major things
    - new checksum xxhash. It is much faster than sha1 (which is
      still the default). use -checksum xxh128 to get the new
      checksum. Note that it is not a cryptographic checksum, but
      hey it's an order of magnitude faster!
    - increased buffer size when calculating the checksum, and it
      can be controlled from the command line via -buffersize N
  The important parts of this release have been co-authored with
  @trollkarlen who did a majority of the work. Thanks!
  * Minor things
    - Clean up CI
    - switch to C++17
    - auto format shell scripts
