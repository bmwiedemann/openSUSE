- run autoconf to fix upstream autoconf bug

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  7 17:57:11 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 1.7.0:
  * Major things
    - new checksum xxhash. It is much faster than sha1 (which is
      still the default). use -checksum xxh128 to get the new
      checksum. Note that it is not a cryptographic checksum, but
      hey it's an order of magnitude faster!
    - increased buffer size when calculating the checksum, and it
      can be controlled from the command line via -buffersize N
  The important parts of this release have been co-authored with
  @trollkarlen who did a majority of the work. Thanks!
  * Minor things
    - Clean up CI
    - switch to C++17
    - auto format shell scripts
  * Here is an autogenerated list:
    - Fix minor issues by @pauldreik in #168
