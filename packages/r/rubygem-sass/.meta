  <title>A powerful but elegant CSS compiler that makes CSS fun again</title>
  <description>      Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding
      nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
      It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the
      command line tool or a web-framework plugin.</description>
