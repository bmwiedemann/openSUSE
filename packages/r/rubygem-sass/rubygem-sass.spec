%description
Ruby Sass is deprecated! See https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass for
details.
Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding
nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the
command line tool or a web-framework plugin.
