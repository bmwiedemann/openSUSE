    <comment>- Update to readline-8.0 final

- Update to readline-8.0-rc1 for testing 

- Update to readline-8.0-beta2 for testing
  j. Readline now allows application-defined keymap names; there is a new public
     function, rl_set_keymap_name(), to do that.
  k. The &quot;Insert&quot; keypad key, if available, now puts readline into overwrite
     mode.
    readline-5.2-conf.patch
- Port and modify patches
  * readline-6.2-metamode.patch
  * readline-6.3-input.dif
  * readline-7.0-screen.patch
  * readline-8.0.dif

- Update to readline-8.0-beta for testing
  a. Non-incremental vi-mode search (`N', `n') can search for a shell pattern, as
     Posix specifies (uses fnmatch(3) if available).
  b. There are new `next-screen-line' and `previous-screen-line' bindable
     commands, which move the cursor to the same column in the next, or previous,
     physical line, respectively.
  c. There are default key bindings for control-arrow-key key combinations.
  d. A negative argument (-N) to `quoted-insert' means to insert the next N
     characters using quoted-insert.
  e. New public function: rl_check_signals(), which allows applications to
     respond to signals that readline catches while waiting for input using
     a custom read function.
  f. There is new support for conditionally testing the readline version in an
     inputrc file, with a full set of arithmetic comparison operators available.</comment>

  * Map all &quot;screen(-xxx)?.yyy(-zzz)?&quot; to &quot;screen&quot; as well as
    map &quot;konsole(-xxx)?&quot; and &quot;gnome(-xxx)?&quot; to &quot;xterm&quot;

- Add official patch readline80-001
  The history file reading code doesn't close the file descriptor open to
  the history file when it encounters a zero-length file.

- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.</comment>

    <comment>- Add official patch readline80-002
  When using previous-history to go back beyond the beginning of the history list,
  it's possible to move to an incorrect partial line.
- Add official patch readline80-003
  Reading history entries with timestamps can result in history entries joined
  by linefeeds.
- Add official patch readline80-004
  If writing the history file fails, and renaming the backup history file fails,
  it's possible for readline's history code to return the wrong error to its
  caller.</comment>

    buffer when aborting an incremental search.

- Update to readline-8.1-rc2 for testing 
  * Bracketed paste mode is enabled by default. There is a configure-time
    option (--enable-bracketed-paste-default) to set the default to on or off.
  * Terminals that are named &quot;dumb&quot; or unknown do not enable bracketed paste
    by default.

    <comment>- Add patch readline82-001 and its signing readline82-001
  * Starting a readline application with an invalid locale
    specification for LC_ALL/LANG/LC_CTYPE can cause it crash on
    the first call to readline.

- Update to final readline-8.2
  r. When replacing a history entry, make sure the existing entry has a non-NULL
     timestamp before copying it; it may have been added by the application, not
     the history library.

- Update to readline-8.2-rc4
  m. Readline now checks for changes to locale settings (LC_ALL/LC_CTYPE/LANG)
     each time it is called, and modifies the appropriate locale-specific display
     and key binding variables when the locale changes.
- Port patch readline-8.2.dif

- Update to readline-8.2-rc2

- use https:// for source urls  
- Update to readline-8.2-rc1

- Update to readline-8.2-beta
  a. There is now an HS_HISTORY_VERSION containing the version number of the
     history library for applications to use.
  b. History expansion better understands multiple history expansions that may
     contain strings that would ordinarily inhibit history expansion (e.g.,
     `abc!$!$').
  c. There is a new framework for readline timeouts, including new public
     functions to set timeouts and query how much time is remaining before a
     timeout hits, and a hook function that can trigger when readline times</comment>

    <comment>- Add upstream patch readline82-002
  * It's possible for readline to try to zero out a line that's not null-
    terminated, leading to a memory fault.
- Add upstream patch readline82-003
- Add upstream patch readline82-004
- Add upstream patch readline82-005
  * If an application is using readline in callback mode, and a signal arrives
    after readline checks for it in rl_callback_read_char() but before it
    restores the application's signal handlers, it won't get processed until the
    next time the application calls rl_callback_read_char(). Readline needs to
    check for and resend any pending signals after restoring the application's
    signal handlers.
- Add upstream patch readline82-006
  * This is a variant of the same issue as the one fixed by patch 5. In this
    case, the signal arrives and is pending before readline calls rl_getc().
    When this happens, the pending signal will be handled by the loop, but may
    alter or destroy some state that the callback uses. Readline needs to treat
    this case the same way it would if a signal interrupts pselect/select, so
    compound operations like searches and reading numeric arguments get cleaned
    up properly.
- Add upstream patch readline82-007
  * If readline is called with no prompt, it should display a newline if return
    is typed on an empty line. It should still suppress the final newline if
    return is typed on the last (empty) line of a multi-line command.</comment>
