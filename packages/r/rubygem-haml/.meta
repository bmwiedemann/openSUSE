  <title>An elegant, structured XHTML/XML templating engine</title>
  <description>      Haml (HTML Abstraction Markup Language) is a layer on top of XHTML or XML
      that's designed to express the structure of XHTML or XML documents
      in a non-repetitive, elegant, easy way,
      using indentation rather than closing tags
      and allowing Ruby to be embedded with ease.
      It was originally envisioned as a plugin for Ruby on Rails,
      but it can function as a stand-alone templating engine.</description>
