- Update to 8.7:
  * Typed Racket offers Shallow and Optional modes for its gradual
    types. These modes lower the cost of interacting with untyped code,
    but provide less protection against buggy interactions.

  * Racket uses Unicode 14.0 for character and string operations, and
    includes grapheme operations. DrRacket supports emojis.

  * Racket supports RV64G (RISC-V).

  * Programmers can disable definition shadowing using
    `(#%declare #:require=define)`.
  
  * The module dependency graphs available using raco dependencies-graph
    and DrRacket's Module browser are faster and have new package
    filtering support.
  
  * DrRacket is more responsive when killing programs that produce a lot
    of output.
  
  * Plot 3D allows negative altitude values (e.g., looking at the plot
    from "below").
  
  * The `scriblib/bibtex` and `scriblib/autobib` libraries support DOIs.
  
  * There are many other repairs and improvements!

- Fix file list

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 12 21:26:11 UTC 2022 - Fred Fu <moonsolo@gmail.com>

- Update to 8.6:
  * Racket has an “equal-always?” primitive that equates values that will stay
    the same even if mutated. See
    https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Equality.html#%28def.%28%28quote.~23~25kernel%29._equal-always~3f%29%29

  * This release uses a new build system, Zuo, which is implemented as a little
    language, in accordance with the ideas of Language Oriented Programming
    (LOP). The implementation has a single C file (plus libraries implemented in
    Zuo), so it compiles easily. The zuo/build library is modeled on make and
    Shake for tracking dependencies and build steps. See
    https://docs.racket-lang.org/zuo/index.html and
    https://racket.discourse.group/t/new-build-system-pushed-to-git-repo/873

  * Racket supports stencil vectors, which associate a virtual bitmask with a
    vector, enabling certain mask-equipped update operations. See
    https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stencil_vectors.html

  * Racket supports Arm64 machines running Windows.

  * Redex has support for simultaneous substitutions. See
    https://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/reference.html#%28form._%28%28lib._redex%2Freduction-semantics..rkt%29._substitute%29%29

  * The Web Server provides control over the maximum number of concurrent
    connections via its “safety limits” construct. See
    https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server-internal/dispatch-server-unit.html#%28part._safety-limits%29

  * The Web Server has improved logging performance and improved request parsing performance, reducing tail latencies.

  * The Web Server supports logging response status code via
    web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-logresp. See
    https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server-internal/dispatch-logresp.html

  * The db library supports custom types for PostgreSQL connections; see
    pg-custom-type for details. See
    https://docs.racket-lang.org/db/util.html#%28def._%28%28lib._db%2Futil%2Fpostgresql..rkt%29._pg-custom-type%29%29

  * The release includes many other repairs and changes!

- Remove patch racket-amsmath-mathabx.patch, since the conflict between modern
  amsmath and mathabx LaTeX styles has been resolved in the upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  9 07:01:25 UTC 2022 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Add patch racket-amsmath-mathabx.patch
  * Avoid conflict between modern amsmath and mathabx LaTeX styles to
    get e.g. scsh build again

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 8 18:26:11 UTC 2022 - Fred Fu <moonsolo@gmail.com>
- Update to 8.5:
  * Racket's new `-y` flag automatically keeps compiled files up to date,
    reducing subsequent load times.
  
  * Error-message realms allow Racket-hosted languages to adapt and
    rewrite error messages to make sense in a particular context.
  
  * Nonprivileged users can control package installation scope using an
    "other-version" directory in the addon-dir.
  
  * Racket CS runs on platforms where native-code generation is not
    currently supported (e.g., s390x or ppc64). See "README.txt" in the
    source distribution for more information on the --enable-pb flag to
    configure.
  
  * DrRacket's new 'Reopen Closed Tab' file menu item will open previously
    closed tabs.
  
  * Typed Racket has support for the `xml` library; use `typed/xml`.
  
  * Rackunit reports source locations for failed test cases in the
    Typed Racket language.
  
  * Plot has violin plots and improved box-and-whisker plots.
  
  * Boxes are supported alongside lists, vectors etc. in place-channel
    messages.
  
  * Those who manually configure Racket CS to use Zlib compression for
    compiled code should be aware of CVE-2018-25032; the next release and
    the current snapshot builds use a newer, safer version of zlib.
  
  * The release includes many other repairs and changes!

- Spec changes:
  * add google-roboto-fonts to the build dependencies. Fonts are required for
  the following two cases: 1. making scribble documents 2. compiling programs
  that depend on font-related library (e.g. racket/draw) at compile time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 16 15:26:11 UTC 2022 - Fred Fu <moonsolo@gmail.com>
- Fix bug for boo#1198475
  * add a new build dependency, `ncurses-devel`, to enable `expeditor`
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 6 15:26:11 UTC 2022 - Fred Fu <moonsolo@gmail.com>
- Update to 8.4:
  * Command-line Racket provides a new expression editor by default for
    its read-eval-print loop (REPL). The new REPL is based on the Chez
    Scheme expression editor, but extended to use the same
    language-sensitive syntax coloring and indentation tools as DrRacket.
  * Typed Racket adds a kind system, preventing programmers from
    writing nonsensical type expressions. It checks whether type
    constructors are correctly applied to arguments, and separates
    type constructors from polymorphic types. The `:kind` form enables
    checking the kind of a type expression at the REPL. The new system
    also correctly rejects some ill-formed recursive types.
  * Racket has a `file-or-directory-stat` for unified information about
    file-system objects.
  * DrRacket shows the region affected by an `#;` S-expression comment
    by fading the commented-out region.
  * Racket on Chez has faster multiplication and division for some
    numbers.
  * Web server: The files dispatcher supports all standard caching-related
    HTTP response headers (e.g., Cache-Control).
  * Web server: A new dispatcher captures the common pattern of processing
    HTTP requests and responses in a layered fashion.
  * The Web Server supports use of the Cache-Control header, and includes
    a new wrapping dispatcher.
  * Expander: add "portal" syntax to support new forms of syntax object
    binding.
  * Documentation search is improved.
  * Some hash operations support an optional `try-order?` argument.
  * The plot-metrics interface has documentation.
  * Fonts support OpenType feature settings.
  * The Gui library has improved support for Wayland.
  * The computation of quadratic roots is further improved.
  * The `set/c` contract adds support for random generation.
  * DrRacket's interactions window supports #lang-specific coloring
    and indentation.
  * DrRacket's parenthesis-based keyboard shortcuts change based on
    the parentheses that each different #lang uses.
  * The release includes many other bug repairs and other improvements!

  Transition/Update notes:
  * To turn off expeditor and make Racket's REPL go back to the old
    editline/readline-based editor, use the command

      ,input readline

    and then restart Racket. Get back to the new expression editor with

      ,input expeditor

    To toggle color mode for the new expression editor, use one of the
    following, which does not require restarting Racket:

      ,color #false
      ,color #true

  * Support for comment fading in DrRacket requires an increment to
    the "WXME" format version so files with non-text content written
    by DrRacket v8.4 will open only in v8.4 and later. This does not
    affect files that consist only of unicode text.
  * The addition of the kind system to Typed Racket means that certain
    mild abuses of the type system no longer type check, most notably
    the 'application' of a polymorphic type.

- Spec changes:
  * fix the path to locate a list of html files where references of
    %{build-root} need to removed
  * add more html files to the list above
  * remove the command that deletes `.LOCKpkgs.rktd`, so users will not
    have to manually create this file as a root user in order to successfully
    run `raco` or `drracket`.

- RPMlintrc changes:
  * remove unused filters.
  * add a filter to ignore warnings on `.LOCKpkgs.rktd`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 1 12:26:11 UTC 2021 - Fred Fu <moonsolo@gmail.com>
- Update to 8.3:
  * Racket removes syntax arming and disarming in favor of a simpler system of
    protected syntax operations, along with other updates to the syntax system.
  * DrRacket has improved support for custom #lang languages.
  * Typed Racket improves precision for type-checking of non-polymorphic
    structures, existential types, and certain binding forms.
  * Scribble HTML output gains a button to show / hide the table of contents on
    mobile platforms.
  * Redex’s stepper’s GUI shows IO-judgment form rule names.
  * Many bug fixes!
- Remove dont-strip.patch, since --disable-strip has been repaired or improved
  in 8.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 10 07:26:11 UTC 2021 - Fred Fu <moonsolo@gmail.com>
- Update to 8.2:
  * Racket CS improved the performance of large-integer arithmetic.
  * Racket has improved support for layered and tethered installation.
  * Racket CS supports nonatomic allocation via ffi/unsafe.
  * Cross-compilation works fully with the raco cross tool, which
    is distributed separately as the “raco-cross” package.
  * DrRacket has performance improvements when editing files with
    picts containing large bitmaps.
  * Typed Racket more consistently refines field types of
    non-polymorphic structs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 27 11:34:54 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 8.0:
  * Racket CS is the default implementation
    (except for ppc64le and s390x)
  * Racket CS has better parallel garbage collection, a 10%–30% reduction
    in the size of generated code, and various targeted optimizations.
  * A rewrite of the test-engine package allows the #lang versions of
    teaching languages to produce linked test-failure messages.
  * The release comes with a new mark-up DSL for composing text to appear
    in the REPL (simple-tree-text-markup).
  * Redex has an added define-overriding-judgment form and improved
    error source location reporting.
  * Windows scrolling speed reflects the system preference.
  * The db package uses the utf8mb4 charset for MySQL connections.
- Rebase dont-strip.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 21 13:14:06 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 7.8:

- Racket version bumped to 6.10.1.
- Spec changes
  * Drop --collectsdir in %configure in favour of --prefix (%configure
    would fail otherwise)
  * Drop 0-size file guard. This used to delete lock files (LOCKpkgs.rktd)
    lack of which would result in errors in many contexts, including
    basic usage of both DrRacket and raco (package manager)
  * Drop %_datadir/%name/collects from %dir, because parent folder is already
    included in another %dir entry. This fixes a warning about collects folder
    being listed twice.
  * Added reference to starter-sh.
  * Drop DrRacket's -singleInstance option from %suse_update_desktop_file. This
    option caused error messages coming from %suse_update_desktop_file itself.
