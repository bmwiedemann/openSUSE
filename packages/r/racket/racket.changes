  main and doc pacakges

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 29 12:55:43 UTC 2019 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

Wed Mar 27 18:12:23 UTC 2019 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Require some missed libraries and certificates for build
  as well as for installation even if rmplint cries 
- Update to racket 7.2
  * The contract system supports collapsible contracts, which avoid
    repeated wrappers in certain pathological situations. Thanks to Daniel
    Feltey.
  * Quickscript, a scripting tool for DrRacket, has become part of the
    standard distribution. Thanks to Laurent Orseau.
  * The web server's built-in configuration for serving static files
    recognizes the ".mjs" extension for JavaScript modules.
  * The `data/enumerate` library supports an additional form of
    subtraction via `but-not/e`, following Yorgey and Foner's ICFP'18
    paper. Thanks to Max New.
  * The `letrec.rkt` example model in Redex has been changed to more
    closely match Racket, which led to some bug fixes in Racket's
    implementation of `letrec` and `set!`.
  * The racklog library has seen a number of improvements, including fixes
    to logic variable binding, logic variables containing predicates being
    applicable, and the introduction of an `%andmap` higher-order predicate.

Thu Nov 29 22:02:09 UTC 2018 - Tomasz Olszewski <olszewst@gmail.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 24 21:10:21 UTC 2017 - olszewst@gmail.com

- Racket version bumped to 6.10.1.
- Spec changes
  * Drop --collectsdir in %configure in favour of --prefix (%configure
    would fail otherwise)
  * Drop 0-size file guard. This used to delete lock files (LOCKpkgs.rktd)
    lack of which would result in errors in many contexts, including
    basic usage of both DrRacket and raco (package manager)
  * Drop %_datadir/%name/collects from %dir, because parent folder is already
    included in another %dir entry. This fixes a warning about collects folder
    being listed twice.
  * Added reference to starter-sh.
  * Drop DrRacket's -singleInstance option from %suse_update_desktop_file. This
    option caused error messages coming from %suse_update_desktop_file itself.

  into same style.
