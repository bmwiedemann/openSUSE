%description
The rcm suite of tools is for managing dotfiles directories. This is a
directory containing all the .*rc files in your home directory (.zshrc,
.vimrc, and so on). These files have gone by many names in history,
such as “rc files” because they typically end in rc or “dotfiles”
because they begin with a period.
