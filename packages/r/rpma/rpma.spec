%description -n %{lname}
librpma is a C library for accessing persistent memory (PMem) devices on
remote hosts over Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).

The librpma library provides two possible schemes of operation:
Remote Memory Access and Messaging. Both of them are available over a connection
established between two peers. Both of these schemes can make use of PMem as
well as DRAM for the sake of building
Remote Persistent Memory Accessing (RPMA) applications.
