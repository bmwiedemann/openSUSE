  <title>Rootkit Hunter Scans for Rootkits, Backdoors, and Local Exploits</title>
  <description>Rootkit Hunter scans files and systems for known and unknown rootkits,
backdoors, and sniffers.  The package contains one shell script, a few
text-based databases, and optional Perl modules. This tool scans for
rootkits, backdoors, and local exploits by running tests like:

* Comparing MD5 hashes

* Looking for default files used by rootkits

* Checking for wrong file permissions for binaries

* Looking for suspected strings in LKM and KLD modules

* Looking for hidden files

* Optionally scanning within plain text and binary files

* Checking software versions

* Testing applications</description>
