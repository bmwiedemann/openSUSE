%description
Rocs is a Graph Theory IDE for helping professors to show the results
of a graph algorithm and also helping students to do the algorithms.

Rocs has a scripting module, done in Qt Script, which interacts with
the drawn graph and every change in the graph with the script is
reflected on the drawn one.
