  <title>Fastest and safest AV1 encoder</title>
  <description>rav1e is an AV1 video encoder.

AV1 is a video codec by the Alliance for Open Media, composed of most
of the important Web companies (Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon,
Microsoft, Mozilla...).

AV1 has the potential to be up to 20% better than the HEVC codec, but
the patents license is totally free, while HEVC patents licenses are
insanely high and very confusing.

rav1e features:

* Intra and inter frames
* 64x64 superblocks
* 4x4 to 64x64 RDO-selected square and 2:1/1:2 rectangular blocks
* DC, H, V, Paeth, smooth, and a subset of directional prediction modes
* DCT, (FLIP-)ADST and identity transforms (up to 64x64, 16x16 and 32x32 respectively)
* 8-, 10- and 12-bit depth color
* 4:2:0 (full support), 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 (limited) chroma sampling
* Variable speed settings
* Near real-time encoding at high speed levels
