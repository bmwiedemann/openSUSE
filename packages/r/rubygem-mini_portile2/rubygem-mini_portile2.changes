- ### 2.8.7 / 2024-05-31

#### Added

- When setting the C compiler through the `MiniPortile` constructor, the preferred keyword argument is now `:cc_command`. The original `:gcc_command` is still supported. (#144 by @flavorjones)
- Add support for extracting xz-compressed tarballs on OpenBSD. (#141 by @postmodern)
- Add OpenBSD support to the experimental method `MakeMakefile#mkmf_config`. (#141 by @flavorjones)

#### Changed

- `MiniPortileCMake` now detects the C and C++ compiler the same way `MiniPortile` does: by examining environment variables, then using kwargs, then looking in RbConfig (in that order). (#144 by @flavorjones)
- GPG file verification error messages are captured in the raised exception. Previously these errors went to `stderr`. (#145 by @flavorjones)

### 2.8.6 / 2024-04-14

#### Added

- When using CMake on FreeBSD, default to clang's "cc" and "c++" compilers. (#139 by @mudge)

- ### 2.8.5 / 2023-10-22

#### Added

- New methods `#lib_path` and `#include_path` which point at the installed directories under `ports`. (by @flavorjones)
- Add config param for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, which now defaults to `Release`. (#136 by @Watson1978)

#### Experimental

Introduce experimental support for `MiniPortile#mkmf_config` which sets up MakeMakefile variables to properly link against the recipe. This should make it easier for C extensions to package third-party libraries. (by @flavorjones)

- With no arguments, will set up just `$INCFLAGS`, `$libs`, and `$LIBPATH`.
- Optionally, if provided a pkg-config file, will use that config to more precisely set `$INCFLAGS`, `$libs`, `$LIBPATH`, and `$CFLAGS`/`$CXXFLAGS`.
- Optionally, if provided the name of a static archive, will rewrite linker flags to ensure correct linkage.

Note that the behavior may change slightly before official support is announced. Please comment on [#118](https://github.com/flavorjones/mini_portile/issues/118) if you have feedback.

- updated to version 2.8.4
    Various fixes to build system

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 21 11:32:18 UTC 2022 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

updated to version 2.8.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ### 2.8.0 / 2022-02-20

  #### Added

  - Support xz-compressed archives (recognized by an `.xz` file extension).
  - When downloading a source archive, default open_timeout and read_timeout to 10 seconds, but allow configuration via open_timeout and read_timeout config parameters.

Tue Jan 25 07:11:31 UTC 2022 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

updated to version 2.7.1
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ### 2.7.1 / 2021-10-20

  #### Packaging

  A test artifact that has been included in the gem was being flagged by some users' security scanners because it wasn't a real tarball. That artifact has been updated to be a real tarball. [#108]


  ### 2.7.0 / 2021-08-31

  ### Added

  The commands used for "make", "compile", and "cmake" are configurable via keyword arguments. [#107] (Thanks, @cosmo0920!)



-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  1 03:47:32 UTC 2021 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 2.6.1

  #### Dependencies

  Make `net-ftp` an optional dependency, since requiring it as a hard dependency in v2.5.2 caused warnings
  to be emitted by Ruby 2.7 and earlier. A warning message is emitted if FTP functionality is called and
  `net-ftp` isn't available; this should only happen in Ruby 3.1 and later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 14 16:20:21 UTC 2021 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 2.5.1

  #### Dependencies

  This release ends support for ruby < 2.3.0. If you're on 2.2.x or earlier,
  we strongly suggest that you find the time to upgrade, because [official
  support for Ruby 2.2 ended on 2018-03-31](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/06/20/support-of-ruby-2-2-has-ended/).

  #### Enhancements

  * `MiniPortile.execute` now takes an optional `:env` hash, which is merged
    into the environment variables for the subprocess. Likely this is only useful for specialized use cases. [#99]
  * Experimental support for cmake-based projects extended to Windows. (Thanks, @larskanis!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
