- 7.0.8:


## Active Support

*   Fix `TimeWithZone` still using deprecated `#to_s` when `ENV` or `config` to
    disable it are set.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Fix CacheStore#write_multi when using a distributed Redis cache with a connection pool.

    Fixes [#48938](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/48938).

    *Jonathan del Strother*



## Active Model

*   No changes.



## Active Record

*   Fix `change_column` not setting `precision: 6` on `datetime` columns when
    using 7.0+ Migrations and SQLite.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Fix unscope is not working in specific case

    Before:
    ```ruby
    Post.where(id: 1...3).unscope(where: :id).to_sql # "SELECT `posts`.* FROM `posts` WHERE `posts`.`id` >= 1 AND `posts`.`id` < 3"

    ```

    After:
    ```ruby
    Post.where(id: 1...3).unscope(where: :id).to_sql # "SELECT `posts`.* FROM `posts`"
    ```

    Fixes #48094.

    *Kazuya Hatanaka*

*   Fix associations to a STI model including a `class_name` parameter

    ```ruby
    class Product < ApplicationRecord
      has_many :requests, as: :requestable, class_name: "ProductRequest", dependent: :destroy
    end

    # STI tables
    class Request < ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :requestable, polymorphic: true

      validate :request_type, presence: true
    end

    class ProductRequest < Request
      belongs_to :user
    end
    ```

    Accessing such association would lead to:

    ```
    table_metadata.rb:22:in `has_column?': undefined method `key?' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
    ```

    *Romain Filinto*

*   Fix `change_table` setting datetime precision for 6.1 Migrations

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Fix change_column setting datetime precision for 6.1 Migrations

    *Hartley McGuire*


## Action View

*   Fix `form_for` missing the hidden `_method` input for models with a
    namespaced route.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Fix `render collection: @records, cache: true` inside `jbuilder` templates

    The previous fix that shipped in `7.0.7` assumed template fragments are always strings,
    this isn't true with `jbuilder`.

    *Jean Boussier*


## Action Pack

*   Fix `HostAuthorization` potentially displaying the value of the
    X_FORWARDED_HOST header when the HTTP_HOST header is being blocked.

    *Hartley McGuire*, *Daniel Schlosser*



## Active Job

*   Fix Active Job log message to correctly report a job failed to enqueue
    when the adapter raises an `ActiveJob::EnqueueError`.

    *Ben Sheldon*



## Action Mailer

*   No changes.



## Action Cable

*   No changes.

    *Sean Doyle*




7.0.7.2:

No changes between this and 7.0.7.2.  This release was just to fix file permissions in the previous release.

7.0.7.1:


## Active Support

*   Use a temporary file for storing unencrypted files while editing

    [CVE-2023-38037]

7.0.7:


## Active Support

*   Fix `Cache::NullStore` with local caching for repeated reads.

    *fatkodima*

*   Fix `to_s` with no arguments not respecting custom `:default` formats

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Fix `ActiveSupport::Inflector.humanize(nil)` raising ``NoMethodError: undefined method `end_with?' for nil:NilClass``.

    *James Robinson*

*   Fix `Enumerable#sum` for `Enumerator#lazy`.

    *fatkodima*, *Matthew Draper*, *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Improve error message when EventedFileUpdateChecker is used without a
    compatible version of the Listen gem

    *Hartley McGuire*



## Active Model

*   Error.full_message now strips ":base" from the message.

    *zzak*

*   Add a load hook for `ActiveModel::Model` (named `active_model`) to match the load hook for
    `ActiveRecord::Base` and allow for overriding aspects of the `ActiveModel::Model` class.



## Active Record

*   Restores functionality to the missing method when using enums and fixes.

    *paulreece*

*   Fix `StatementCache::Substitute` with serialized type.

    *ywenc*

*   Fix `:db_runtime` on notification payload when application have multiple databases.

    *Eileen M. Uchitelle*

*   Correctly dump check constraints for MySQL 8.0.16+.

    *Steve Hill*

*   Fix `ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#in_order_of` to include `nil`s, to match the
    behavior of `Enumerable#in_order_of`.

    For example, `Post.in_order_of(:title, [nil, "foo"])` will now include posts
    with `nil` titles, the same as `Post.all.to_a.in_order_of(:title, [nil, "foo"])`.

    *fatkodima*

*   Revert "Fix autosave associations with validations added on `:base` of the associated objects."

    This change intended to remove the :base attribute from the message,
    but broke many assumptions which key these errors were stored.

    *zzak*

*   Fix `#previously_new_record?` to return true for destroyed records.

    Before, if a record was created and then destroyed, `#previously_new_record?` would return true.
    Now, any UPDATE or DELETE to a record is considered a change, and will result in `#previously_new_record?`
    returning false.

    *Adrianna Chang*

*   Revert breaking changes to `has_one` relationship deleting the old record before the new one is validated.

    *zzak*

*   Fix support for Active Record instances being uses in queries.

    As of `7.0.5`, query arguments were deep duped to avoid mutations impacting
    the query cache, but this had the adverse effect to clearing the primary key when
    the query argument contained an `ActiveRecord::Base` instance.

    This broke the `noticed` gem.

    *Jean Boussier*



## Action View

*   Fix `render collection: @records, cache: true` to cache fragments as bare strings

    Previously it would incorrectly cache them as Action View buffers.

    *Jean Boussier*

*   Don't double-encode nested `field_id` and `field_name` index values

    Pass `index: @options` as a default keyword argument to `field_id` and
    `field_name` view helper methods.

    *Sean Doyle*



## Action Pack

*   No changes.



## Active Job

## Action Cable

*   No changes.



## Active Storage

*   No changes.



## Action Mailbox

*   No changes.



## Action Text

*   No changes.



## Railties

*   Update default scaffold templates to set 303 (See Other) as status code
    on redirect for the update action for XHR requests other than GET or POST
    to avoid issues (e.g browsers trying to follow the redirect using the
    original request method resulting in double PATCH/PUT)

    *Guillermo Iguaran*





7.0.6:

## Active Support

*   Fix `EncryptedConfiguration` returning incorrect values for some `Hash`
    methods

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Fix arguments being destructed `Enumerable#many?` with block.

    *Andrew Novoselac*

*   Fix humanize for strings ending with id.

    *fatkodima*



## Active Model

*   No changes.



## Active Record

*   Fix autosave associations with validations added on `:base` of the associated objects.

    *fatkodima*

*   Fix result with anonymous PostgreSQL columns of different type from json.

    *Oleksandr Avoiants*

*   Preserve timestamp when setting an `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` value to `timestamptz` attribute.

    *fatkodima*

*   Fix where on association with has_one/has_many polymorphic relations.

    Before:
    ```ruby
    Treasure.where(price_estimates: PriceEstimate.all)
    #=> SELECT (...) WHERE "treasures"."id" IN (SELECT "price_estimates"."estimate_of_id" FROM "price_estimates")
    ```

    Later:
    ```ruby
    Treasure.where(price_estimates: PriceEstimate.all)
    #=> SELECT (...) WHERE "treasures"."id" IN (SELECT "price_estimates"."estimate_of_id" FROM "price_estimates" WHERE "price_estimates"."estimate_of_type" = 'Treasure')
    ```

    *Lázaro Nixon*

*   Fix decrementing counter caches on optimistically locked record deletion

    *fatkodima*

*   Ensure binary-destined values have binary encoding during type cast.

    *Matthew Draper*

*   Preserve existing column default functions when altering table in SQLite.

    *fatkodima*

*   Remove table alias added when using `where.missing` or `where.associated`.

    *fatkodima*

*   Fix `Enumerable#in_order_of` to only flatten first level to preserve nesting.

    *Miha Rekar*



## Action View

*   No changes.



## Action Pack

*   No changes.



## Active Job

*   Fix error Active Job passed class with `permitted?`.

    *Alex Baldwin*



## Action Mailer

*   No changes.



## Action Cable

*   Fix Action Cable Redis configuration with sentinels.

    *Dmitriy Ivliev*



## Active Storage

*   Fix retrieving rotation value from FFmpeg on version 5.0+.

    In FFmpeg version 5.0+ the rotation value has been removed from tags.
    Instead the value can be found in side_data_list. Along with
    this update it's possible to have values of -90, -270 to denote the video
    has been rotated.

    *Haroon Ahmed*



## Action Mailbox

*   No changes.



## Action Text

*   No changes.



## Railties

*   Avoid escaping paths when editing credentials.

  fix CVE-2022-44566 (bsc#1207450)
  
  ## Rails 7.0.4.1 (January 17, 2023) ##
  
  *   Make sanitize_as_sql_comment more strict
  
      Though this method was likely never meant to take user input, it was
      attempting sanitization. That sanitization could be bypassed with
      carefully crafted input.
  
      This commit makes the sanitization more robust by replacing any
      occurrances of "/*" or "*/" with "/ *" or "* /". It also performs a
      first pass to remove one surrounding comment to avoid compatibility
      issues for users relying on the existing removal.
  
      This also clarifies in the documentation of annotate that it should not
      be provided user input.
  
      [CVE-2023-22794]
  
  *   Added integer width check to PostgreSQL::Quoting
  
      Given a value outside the range for a 64bit signed integer type
      PostgreSQL will treat the column type as numeric. Comparing
      integer values against numeric values can result in a slow
      sequential scan.
  
      This behavior is configurable via
      ActiveRecord::Base.raise_int_wider_than_64bit which defaults to true.

updated to version 7.0.4
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## Rails 7.0.4 (September 09, 2022) ##
  
  *   Symbol is allowed by default for YAML columns
  
      *Étienne Barrié*
  
  *   Fix `ActiveRecord::Store` to serialize as a regular Hash
  
      Previously it would serialize as an `ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess`
      which is wasteful and cause problem with YAML safe_load.
  
      *Jean Boussier*
  
  *   Add `timestamptz` as a time zone aware type for PostgreSQL
  
      This is required for correctly parsing `timestamp with time zone` values in your database.
  
      If you don't want this, you can opt out by adding this initializer:
  
      ```ruby
      ActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_types -= [:timestamptz]
      ```
  
      *Alex Ghiculescu*
  
  *   Fix supporting timezone awareness for `tsrange` and `tstzrange` array columns.
  
      ```ruby
      # In database migrations
      add_column :shops, :open_hours, :tsrange, array: true
      # In app config
      ActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_types += [:tsrange]
      # In the code times are properly converted to app time zone
      Shop.create!(open_hours: [Time.current..8.hour.from_now])
      ```
  
      *Wojciech Wnętrzak*
  
  *   Resolve issue where a relation cache_version could be left stale.
  
      Previously, when `reset` was called on a relation object it did not reset the cache_versions
      ivar. This led to a confusing situation where despite having the correct data the relation
      still reported a stale cache_version.
  
      Usage:
  
      ```ruby
      developers = Developer.all
      developers.cache_version
  
      Developer.update_all(updated_at: Time.now.utc + 1.second)
  
      developers.cache_version # Stale cache_version
      developers.reset
      developers.cache_version # Returns the current correct cache_version
      ```
  
      Fixes #45341.
  
      *Austen Madden*
  
  *   Fix `load_async` when called on an association proxy.
  
      Calling `load_async` directly an association would schedule
      a query but never use it.
  
      ```ruby
      comments = post.comments.load_async # schedule a query
      comments.to_a # perform an entirely new sync query
      ```
  
      Now it does use the async query, however note that it doesn't
      cause the association to be loaded.
  
      *Jean Boussier*
  
  *   Fix eager loading for models without primary keys.
  
      *Anmol Chopra*, *Matt Lawrence*, and *Jonathan Hefner*
  
  *   `rails db:schema:{dump,load}` now checks `ENV["SCHEMA_FORMAT"]` before config
  
      Since `rails db:structure:{dump,load}` was deprecated there wasn't a simple
      way to dump a schema to both SQL and Ruby formats. You can now do this with
      an environment variable. For example:
  
      ```
      SCHEMA_FORMAT=sql rake db:schema:dump
      ```
  
      *Alex Ghiculescu*
  
  *   Fix Hstore deserialize regression.

updated to version 7.0.3.1
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## Rails 7.0.3.1 (July 12, 2022) ##
  
  *   Change ActiveRecord::Coders::YAMLColumn default to safe_load
  
      This adds two new configuration options The configuration options are as
      follows:
      
      * `config.active_storage.use_yaml_unsafe_load`
      
      When set to true, this configuration option tells Rails to use the old
      "unsafe" YAML loading strategy, maintaining the existing behavior but leaving
      the possible escalation vulnerability in place.  Setting this option to true
      is *not* recommended, but can aid in upgrading.
      
      * `config.active_record.yaml_column_permitted_classes`
      
      The "safe YAML" loading method does not allow all classes to be deserialized
      by default.  This option allows you to specify classes deemed "safe" in your
      application.  For example, if your application uses Symbol and Time in
      serialized data, you can add Symbol and Time to the allowed list as follows:
      
      ```
      config.active_record.yaml_column_permitted_classes = [Symbol, Date, Time]
      ```

Sun May 15 15:19:24 UTC 2022 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 7.0.3

  *   Some internal housekeeping on reloads could break custom `respond_to?`
      methods in class objects that referenced reloadable constants. See
      [#44125](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/44125) for details.

      *Xavier Noria*

  *   Fixed MariaDB default function support.

      Defaults would be written wrong in "db/schema.rb" and not work correctly
      if using `db:schema:load`. Further more the function name would be
      added as string content when saving new records.

      *kaspernj*

  *   Fix `remove_foreign_key` with `:if_exists` option when foreign key actually exists.

      *fatkodima*

  *   Remove `--no-comments` flag in structure dumps for PostgreSQL

      This broke some apps that used custom schema comments. If you don't want
      comments in your structure dump, you can use:

      ```ruby
      ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks.structure_dump_flags = ['--no-comments']
      ```

      *Alex Ghiculescu*

  *   Use the model name as a prefix when filtering encrypted attributes from logs.

      For example, when encrypting `Person#name` it will add `person.name` as a filter
      parameter, instead of just `name`. This prevents unintended filtering of parameters
      with a matching name in other models.

      *Jorge Manrubia*

  *   Fix quoting of `ActiveSupport::Duration` and `Rational` numbers in the MySQL adapter.

      *Kevin McPhillips*

  *   Fix `change_column_comment` to preserve column's AUTO_INCREMENT in the MySQL adapter

  *   Make sure encrypted attributes are not being filtered twice.
  
      *Nikita Vasilevsky*
  
  *   Dump the database schema containing the current Rails version.
  
      Since https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/42297, Rails now generate datetime columns
      with a default precision of 6. This means that users upgrading to Rails 7.0 from 6.1,
      when loading the database schema, would get the new precision value, which would not match
      the production schema.
  
      To avoid this the schema dumper will generate the new format which will include the Rails
      version and will look like this:
  
      ```
      ActiveRecord::Schema[7.0].define
      ```
  
      When upgrading from Rails 6.1 to Rails 7.0, you can run the `rails app:update` task that will
      set the current schema version to 6.1.
  
      *Rafael Mendonça França*
  
  *   Fix parsing expression for PostgreSQL generated column.

      *Kevin Newton*

  *   Fix migration compatibility to create SQLite references/belongs_to column as integer when migration version is 6.0.
  
      Reference/belongs_to in migrations with version 6.0 were creating columns as
      bigint instead of integer for the SQLite Adapter.
  
      *Marcelo Lauxen*
  
  *   Fix joining through a polymorphic association.
  
      *Alexandre Ruban*
  
  *   Fix `QueryMethods#in_order_of` to handle empty order list.
  
      ```ruby
      Post.in_order_of(:id, []).to_a
      ```
  
      Also more explicitly set the column as secondary order, so that any other
      value is still ordered.
  
      *Jean Boussier*
  
  *   Fix `rails dbconsole` for 3-tier config.
  
      *Eileen M. Uchitelle*
  
  *   Fix quoting of column aliases generated by calculation methods.
  
      Since the alias is derived from the table name, we can't assume the result
      is a valid identifier.
  
      ```ruby
      class Test < ActiveRecord::Base
        self.table_name = '1abc'
      end
      Test.group(:id).count
      # syntax error at or near "1" (ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid)
      # LINE 1: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_all, "1abc"."id" AS 1abc_id FROM "1...
      ```
