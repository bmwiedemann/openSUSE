  <title>Home Media Solution for GNOME based on UPnP/DLNA</title>
  <description>Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio,
video and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. In
technical terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer
implemented through a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other
devices in the market is achieved by conformance to very strict
requirements of DLNA and on the fly conversion of media to format that
client devices are capable of handling.</description>
