  <title>The RPM Package Manager</title>
  <description>RPM Package Manager is the main tool for managing the software packages
of the SuSE Linux distribution.

RPM can be used to install and remove software packages. With rpm, it
is easy to update packages.  RPM keeps track of all these manipulations
in a central database.	This way it is possible to get an overview of
all installed packages.  RPM also supports database queries.</description>
