    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.5
  * Support recursively (deep) freezing Country and Timezone instances. #80.
  * Allow negative daylight savings time offsets to be derived when reading
    from zoneinfo files. The utc_offset and std_offset are now derived
    correctly for Europe/Dublin in the 2018a and 2018b releases of the Time
    Zone Database. 
- Updated to version 1.2.4
  * Ignore the leapseconds file that is included in zoneinfo directories installed with version 2017c and later of the Time Zone Database.
- updated to version 1.2.3
 see installed CHANGES.md
  Version 1.2.3 - 25-Mar-2017
  ---------------------------
  * Reduce the number of String objects allocated when loading zoneinfo files.
    #54.
  * Make Timezone#friendly_identifier compatible with frozen string literals.
  * Improve the algorithm for deriving the utc_offset from zoneinfo files. This
    now correctly handles Pacific/Apia switching from one side of the
    International Date Line to the other whilst observing daylight savings time.
    #66.
  * Fix an UnknownTimezone exception when calling transitions_up_to or
    offsets_up_to on a TimezoneProxy instance obtained from Timezone.get_proxy.
  * Allow the Factory zone to be obtained from the Zoneinfo data source.
  * Ignore the /usr/share/zoneinfo/timeconfig symlink included in Slackware
    distributions. #64.
  * Fix Timezone#strftime handling of %Z expansion when %Z is prefixed with more
    than one percent. #31.
  * Support expansion of %z, %:z, %::z and %:::z to the UTC offset of the time
    zone in Timezone#strftime. #31 and #67.
- put the requires actually in the gem_packages
- port MANUAL to gem2rpm.yml
- updated to version 1.2.2
 * Fix an error with duplicates being returned by Timezone#all_country_zones
   and Timezone#all_country_zone_identifiers when used with tzinfo-data
   v1.2014.6 or later.
 * Use the zone1970.tab file for country timezone data if it is found in the
   zoneinfo directory (and fallback to zone.tab if not). zone1970.tab was added
   in tzdata 2014f. zone.tab is now deprecated.
 Version 1.2.1 - 1-Jun-2014
 --------------------------
 * Support zoneinfo files generated with zic version 2014c and later.
 * On platforms that only support positive 32-bit timestamps, ensure that
   conversions are accurate from the epoch instead of just from the first
   transition after the epoch.
 * Minor documentation improvements.
 Version 1.2.0 - 26-May-2014
 ---------------------------
 * Raise the minimum supported Ruby version to 1.8.7.
 * Support loading system zoneinfo data on FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.
   Resolves #15.
 * Add canonical_identifier and canonical_zone methods to Timezone. Resolves #16.
 * Add a link to a DataSourceNotFound help page in the TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound
   exception message.
 * Load iso3166.tab and zone.tab files as UTF-8.
 * Fix Timezone#local_to_utc returning local Time instances on systems using UTC
   as the local time zone. Resolves #13.
 * Fix == methods raising an exception when passed an instance of a different
   class by making &lt;=&gt; return nil if passed a non-comparable argument.
 * Eliminate &quot;require 'rational'&quot; warnings. Resolves #10.
 * Eliminate &quot;assigned but unused variable - info&quot; warnings. Resolves #11.
 * Switch to minitest v5 for unit tests. Resolves #18.
- require timezone
- updated to version 1.1.0
 * TZInfo is now thread safe. ThreadSafe::Cache is now used instead of Hash
   to cache Timezone and Country instances returned by Timezone.get and
   Country.get. The tzinfo gem now depends on thread_safe ~&gt; 0.1.
 * Added a transitions_up_to method to Timezone that returns a list of the times
   where the UTC offset of the timezone changes.
 * Added an offsets_up_to method to Timezone that returns the set of offsets
   that have been observed in a defined timezone.
 * Fixed a &quot;can't modify frozen String&quot; error when loading a Timezone from a
   zoneinfo file using an identifier String that is both tainted and frozen.
   Resolves #3.
 * Support TZif3 format zoneinfo files (now produced by zic from tzcode version
   2013e onwards).
 * Support using YARD to generate documentation (added a .yardopts file).
 * Ignore the +VERSION file included in the zoneinfo directory on Mac OS X.
 * Added a note to the documentation concerning 32-bit zoneinfo files (as
   included with Mac OS X).
- updated to version 1.0.1
 * Fix a test case failure when tests are run from a directory that contains a
   dot in the path (issue #29751).
- updated to version 1.0.0
 * Allow TZInfo to be used with different data sources instead of just the
   built-in Ruby module data files.
 * Include a data source that allows TZInfo to load data from the binary
   zoneinfo files produced by zic and included with many Linux and Unix-like
   distributions.
 * Remove the definition and index Ruby modules from TZInfo and move them into
   a separate TZInfo::Data library (available as the tzinfo-data gem).
 * Default to using the TZInfo::Data library as the data source if it is
   installed, otherwise use zoneinfo files instead.
 * Preserve the nanoseconds of local timezone Time objects when performing
   conversions (issue #29705).
 * Don't add the tzinfo lib directory to the search path when requiring 'tzinfo'.
   The tzinfo lib directory must now be in the search path before 'tzinfo' is
   required.
 * Add utc_start_time, utc_end_time, local_start_time and local_end_time instance
   methods to TimezonePeriod. These return an identical value as the existing
   utc_start, utc_end, local_start and local_end methods, but return Time
   instances instead of DateTime.
 * Make the start_transition, end_transition and offset properties of
   TimezonePeriod protected. To access properties of the period, callers should
   use other TimezonePeriod instance methods instead (issue #7655).
- updated to version 0.3.37
 * Updated to tzdata version 2013b
  (http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/2013-March/000010.html).
- updated to version 0.3.36
 * Updated to tzdata version 2013a
   (http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/2013-March/000009.html).
 * Fix TimezoneTransitionInfo#eql? incorrectly returning false when running on
   Ruby 2.0.
 * Change eql? and == implementations to test the class of the passed in object
   instead of checking individual properties with 'respond_to?'.
- updated to version 0.3.35
  (http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/2012-November/000007.html).
- updated to version 0.3.34

    Timezone.default_dst attribute.  Thanks to Kurt Werle for the
    suggestion and patch.
- update to version 0.3.28
  * Add support for Ruby 1.9.3 (trunk revision 31668 and later).
    Thanks to Aaron Patterson for reporting the problems running on
    the new version. Closes #29233.

  * Updated to tzdata version 2011g
    (http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.time.tz/3758).

  * Change invalid timezone check to exclude characters not used in
    timezone identifiers and avoid 'character class has duplicated
    range' warnings with Ruby 1.9.2.
  * Ruby 1.9.2 has deprecated &quot;require 'rational'&quot;, but older
    versions of Ruby need rational to be required. Require rational
    only when the Rational module has not already been loaded.
  * Remove circular requires (now a warning in Ruby 1.9.2). Instead
    of using requires in each file for dependencies, tzinfo.rb now
    requires all tzinfo files. If you were previously requiring
    files within the tzinfo directory (e.g. require
    'tzinfo/timezone'), then you will now have to require 'tzinfo'
    instead.

    Ruby 1.9.  Only use Rational.new! if it is available (it is
    preferable in Ruby 1.8 for performance reasons). Thanks to
    Jeremy Kemper and Pratik Naik for reporting this.
    Closes #22312.

    Pratik Naik for spotting this. Closes #19184.
  * Prevent warnings from being output when running Ruby with the
    -v or -w command line options. Thanks to Paul McMahon for the
    patch. Closes #19719.

  * Updated to tzdata version 2008b
    (http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.time.tz/2149).
  * Support loading timezone data in Ruby 1.9.0. Use DateTime.new!
    if it is available instead of DateTime.new0 when constructing
    transition times.  DateTime.new! was added in Ruby 1.8.6.

  Version 1.2.9 - 16-Dec-2020
  ---------------------------
  
  * Fixed an incorrect InvalidTimezoneIdentifier exception raised when loading a
    zoneinfo file that includes rules specifying an additional transition to the
    final defined offset (for example, Africa/Casablanca in version 2018e of the
    Time Zone Database). #123.
