Fri Jun 23 07:12:03 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- Update to version 1.4.6:
  * Enhancements
    - Introduced `v1.26.4-rancher2-1`, `v1.25.9-rancher2-2`,
      `v1.24.13-rancher2-2`, and `v1.23.16-rancher2-3`
  * Kubernetes Versions
    - Each version of RKE has a specific list of supported
      Kubernetes versions. If you want to use a different version
      than listed below, you will need to update Kubernetes using
      the [system images]
      (https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/system-images/)
      option in your `cluster.yml`.
      - Kubernetes version
        - v1.26.4-rancher2-1 (Default)
        - v1.25.9-rancher2-2
        - v1.24.13-rancher2-2
        - v1.23.16-rancher2-3
  * Experimental Kubernetes version
    - N/A
  * New Images in v1.26.4-rancher2-1, v1.25.9-rancher2-2 and
    v1.24.13-rancher2-2
    - Updated Hyperkube Image based on k8s versions
      - rancher/hyperkube:v1.26.4-rancher2

  * Known Major Issues
    - Ephemeral /var/lib/dockershim and /var/lib/cri-dockerd
      directories for kubelet container could cause
      kubelet/dockershim to send empty portMappings after upgrade.
      The workaround is to bind mount these directories by
      specifying extra_binds for kubelet service. See #2993.
    - In clusters where cloud_provider is configured and either
      address or internal_address does not contain a valid IP
      address (e.g., hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to
      start. See #1725.

Thu Mar  9 05:51:59 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- Update to version 1.4.3:
  * Enhancements
    - Introduced v1.24.10-rancher4-1 and v1.23.16-rancher2-1.
  * Major Bug Fixes
    - Fixed high cpu usage issue for v1.24 clusters #38816
    - Fixed issues around hostname-override for AWS cloud provider:
      - Added hostname-override back to RKE. RKE will continue
        finding the node by matching hostname_override to
        kubernetes.io/hostname label on the node. Fixes node not
        found regression.
      - RKE will now set the hostname-override for kube-proxy to
        the instance metadata hostname only if
        useInstanceMetadataHostname is true. If
        useInstanceMetadataHostname is false, RKE will use
        hostname-override set by users.
    - Refer to RKE PR for more details and rancher/rancher#37634
      (comment) for testing usecases.
    - Fixed upgrade issue from clusters having v1beta1 calico
      custom resource definitions with latest kubernetes versions.
      #40280
    - Removed flannel cpu/memory limits with latest kubernetes
      versions #40178

- Update to 1.3.9:
  * BUGFIX:
    A data-corruption issue is reported in etcd 3.5.0, 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 per upstream etcd advisory. The upstream issue has not yet been resolved and no fix is available.
    All 1.22 and 1.23 releases of RKE embed etcd v3.5.x. For this reason, we recommend that users avoid deploying new production Kubernetes clusters using these releases until the issue is fixed upstream and we publish a release that includes that fix.
    Please note that RKE v1.3.8+ creates clusters with v1.22.x by default so we recommend setting kubernetes_version: in cluster.yml to other available Kubernetes versions.
    For existing clusters created with these versions, upstream recommends:
      Enable data corruption check with --experimental-initial-corrupt-check flag. The flag is the only reliable automated way of detecting an inconsistency. This mode has seen significant usage in production and is going to be promoted as default in etcd v3.6.
    Per upstream recommendation as mentioned above, please update your existing clusters to the following new versions introduced with RKE v1.3.9: v1.22.7-rancher1-2 and v1.23.4-rancher1-2. They have the etcd arg experimental-initial-corrupt-check set to true.
    Note this may not always work etcd-io/etcd#13766 (comment) and we suggest not deploying new clusters on production with these versions.
  * Known Major Issues
    - In clusters where cloud_provider is configured, and either address or internal_address does not contain a valid IP address (e.g. hostname or FQDN), kube-proxy will fail to start. See #1725.
  * Kubernetes Versions
