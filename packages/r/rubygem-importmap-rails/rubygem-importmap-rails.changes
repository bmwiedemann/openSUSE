- 2.0.1:

## What's Changed

* Ensure update only runs when there are outdated packages by @dhh 

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1

2.0.0:

## What's Changed

This major release includes two potentially backwards-incompatible changes:

* The compatibility shim is no longer included, since [all major browsers now natively support import maps](https://caniuse.com/import-maps). But if you need to support old browsers, like Safari 15, Firefox 75, Chrome 88, you should continue using the 1.x series of this gem.
* Preloading is now the default. So if you have pins that you intend to lazy load, you need to specifically call `preload: false` as part of the pin.

All changes:

* Drop the bundled shim by @dhh in https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails/pull/216
* Pinning should just always download by @dhh in https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails/pull/217
* Preload all by default by @dhh in https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails/pull/218
* Update Impoortmaps::Command#puts_table to be markdown compatible by @faqndo97 in https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails/pull/222
* bin/importmap update by @botandrose in https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails/pull/214
