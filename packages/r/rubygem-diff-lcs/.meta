  <title>A port of Algorithm::Diff to Ruby</title>
  <description>Diff::LCS is a port of Algorithm::Diff that uses the McIlroy-Hunt longest
common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compute intelligent differences between
two sequenced enumerable containers. The implementation is based on Mario I.
Wolczko's Smalltalk version (1.2, 1993) and Ned Konz's Perl version
(Algorithm::Diff).
