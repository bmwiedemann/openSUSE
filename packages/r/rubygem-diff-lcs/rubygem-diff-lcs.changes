Sat Dec 25 22:32:52 UTC 2021 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.5.0

  * Updated the CI configuration and monkey-patch Hoe.

  * Kenichi Kamiya fixed a test configuration deprecation in SimpleCov. [#69]

  * Tien introduced several corrections and code improvements:

    - Removed an off-by-one error when calculating an index value by embracing
      Ruby iteration properly. This had a side-effect of fixing a long-standing
      bug in `#traverse_sequences` where the traversal would not be transitive.
      That is, `LCS(s2, s1)` should produce a sequence that is transitive with
      `LCS(s1, s2)` on traversal, and applying the diff computed from those
      results would result in equivalent changes that could be played forward or
      backward as appropriate. [#71], [#75]

    - The above fix resulted in a changed order of the longest common subsequence
      when callbacks were applied. After analysis, it was determined that the
      computed subsequence was _equivalent_ to the prior version, so the test was
      updated. This also resulted in the clarification of documentation when
      traversing the subsequences. [#79]

    - An infinite loop case in the case where Diff::LCS would be included into an
      enumerable class has been fixed. [#73]

    - Clarified the purpose of a threshold test in calculation of LCS. [#72],
      [#80]

  * Removed autotest directory

Mon Jul 13 17:24:56 UTC 2020 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.4.4

  ## 1.4.4 / 2020-07-01

  - Fixed an issue reported by Jun Aruga in the Diff::LCS::Ldiff binary text
    detection. [#44][]
  - Fixed a theoretical issue reported by Jun Aruga in Diff::LCS::Hunk to raise
    a more useful exception. [#43][]
  - Added documentation that should address custom object issues as reported in
    [#35][].

  - Fixed more diff errors, in part reported in [#65][].

    - The use of `Numeric#abs` is incorrect in `Diff::LCS::Block#diff_size`.
      The diff size _must_ be accurate for correct change placement.
    - When selecting @max_diff_size in Diff::LCS::Hunk, choose it based on
      `block.diff_size.abs`.
    - Made a number of changes that will, unfortunately, increase allocations
      at the cost of being safe with frozen strings.
    - Add some knowledge that when `Diff::LCS::Hunk#diff` is called, that we
      are processing the _last_ hunk, so some changes will be made to how the
      output is generated.

      - `old`, `ed`, and `reverse_ed` formats have no differences.
      - `unified` format will report `\ No newline at end of file` given the
        correct conditions, at most once. Unified range reporting also
        differs for the last hunk such that the `length` of the range is
        reduced by one.
      - `context` format will report `\No newline at end of file` given the
        correct conditions, up to once per "file". Context range reporting also
        differs for the last hunk such that the `end` part of the range is
        reduced by one to a minimum of one.

  - Added a bunch more tests for the cases above, and fixed `hunk_spec.rb` so
    that the phrase being compared isn't nonsense French.

  - Updated formatting.
  - Added a Rake task to assist with manual testing on Ruby 1.8.

  ## 1.4.3 / 2020-06-29

  - Fixed several issues with the 1.4 on Rubies older than 2.0. Some of this was
    providing useful shim functions to Hoe 3.x (which dropped these older
    Rubies a while ago). Specifically:

    - Removed Array#lazy from a method in Diff::LCS::Hunk.
    - Changed some unit tests to use old-style Symbol-keyed hashes.
    - Changed some unit test helper functions to no longer use keyword
      parameters, but only a trailing options hash.
    - Made the use of `psych` dependent on `RUBY_VERSION >= 1.9`.

    Resolves [#63][].

Sat Jun 27 18:37:42 UTC 2020 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.4.2

  ## 1.4.2 / 2020-06-23

  - Camille Drapier fixed a small issue with RuboCop configuration. [#59][]
  - Applied another fix (and unit test) to fix an issue for the Chef team.
    [#60][], [#61][]

  ## 1.4.1 / 2020-06-23

  - Fix an issue where diff sizes could be negative, and they should be. [#57][],
    [#58][]

  ## 1.4 / 2020-06-23

  - Ruby versions lower than 2.4 are soft-deprecated and will not be run as
    part of the CI process any longer.
  - Akinora MUSHA (knu) added the ability for Diff::LCS::Change objects to be
    implicitly treated arrays. Originally provided as pull request [#47][],
    but it introduced a number of test failures as documented in [#48][], and
    remediation of Diff::LCS itself was introduced in [#49][].
  - Resolved [#5][] with some tests comparing output from `system` calls to
    `bin/ldiff` with some pre-generated output. Resolved [#6][] with these
    tests.
  - Resolved a previously undetected `bin/ldiff` issue with `--context` output
    not matching `diff --context` output.
  - Resolved an issue with later versions of Ruby not working with an `OptParse`
    specification of `Numeric`; this has been changed to `Integer`.
  - Brandon Fish added truffleruby in [#52][].
  - Fixed two missing classes as reported in [#53][].

- updated to version 1.2.3
 * Bugs Fixed:
   * The new encoding detection for diff output generation (added in 1.2.2)
     introduced a bug if the left side of the comparison was the empty set.
     Originally found in rspec/rspec-expectations#238 and
     rspec/rspec-expectations#239. Jon Rowe developed a reasonable heuristic
     (left side, right side, empty string literal) to avoid this bug.
     https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/pull/238
     https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/pull/239
 * There is a known issue with Rubinius in 1.9 mode reported in
   rubinius/rubinius#2268 and demonstrated in the Travis CI builds. For all
   other tested platforms, diff-lcs is considered stable. As soon as a suitably
   small test-case can be created for the Rubinius team to examine, this will be
   added to the Rubinius issue around this.

   https://travis-ci.org/halostatue/diff-lcs/jobs/6241195
 
 == 1.2.2 / 2013-03-30
 
 * Bugs Fixed:
   * Diff::LCS::Hunk could not properly generate a difference for comparison
     sets that are not US-ASCII-compatible because of the use of literal regular
     expressions and strings. Jon Rowe (JonRowe) found this in
     rspec/rspec-expectations#219 and provided a first pass implementation in
     diff-lcs#15. I've reworked it because of test failures in Rubinius when
     running in Ruby 1.9 mode. This coerces the added values to the encoding of
     the old dataset (as determined by the first piece of the old dataset).
