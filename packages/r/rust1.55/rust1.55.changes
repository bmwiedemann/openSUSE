	Version 1.55.0 (2021-09-09)
	============================

	Language
	--------
	- [You can now write open "from" range patterns (`X..`), which will start at `X` and
	  will end at the maximum value of the integer.][83918]
	- [You can now explicitly import the prelude of different editions
	  through `std::prelude` (e.g. `use std::prelude::rust_2021::*;`).][86294]

	Compiler
	--------
	- [Added tier 3\* support for `powerpc64le-unknown-freebsd`.][83572]

	\* Refer to Rust's [platform support page][platform-support-doc] for more
	   information on Rust's tiered platform support.

	Libraries
	---------

	- [Updated std's float parsing to use the Eisel-Lemire algorithm.][86761]
	  These improvements should in general provide faster string parsing of floats,
	  no longer reject certain valid floating point values, and reduce
	  the produced code size for non-stripped artifacts.
	- [`string::Drain` now implements `AsRef<str>` and `AsRef<[u8]>`.][86858]

	Stabilised APIs
	---------------

	- [`Bound::cloned`]
	- [`Drain::as_str`]
	- [`IntoInnerError::into_error`]
	- [`IntoInnerError::into_parts`]
	- [`MaybeUninit::assume_init_mut`]
	- [`MaybeUninit::assume_init_ref`]
	- [`MaybeUninit::write`]
	- [`array::map`]
	- [`ops::ControlFlow`]
	- [`x86::_bittest`]
	- [`x86::_bittestandcomplement`]
	- [`x86::_bittestandreset`]
	- [`x86::_bittestandset`]
	- [`x86_64::_bittest64`]
	- [`x86_64::_bittestandcomplement64`]
	- [`x86_64::_bittestandreset64`]
	- [`x86_64::_bittestandset64`]

	The following previously stable functions are now `const`.

	- [`str::from_utf8_unchecked`]


	Cargo
	-----
	- [Cargo will now deduplicate compiler diagnostics to the terminal when invoking
	  rustc in parallel such as when using `cargo test`.][cargo/9675]
	- [The package definition in `cargo metadata` now includes the `"default_run"`
	  field from the manifest.][cargo/9550]
	- [Added `cargo d` as an alias for `cargo doc`.][cargo/9680]
	- [Added `{lib}` as formatting option for `cargo tree` to print the `"lib_name"`
	  of packages.][cargo/9663]

	Rustdoc
	-------
	- [Added "Go to item on exact match" search option.][85876]
	- [The "Implementors" section on traits no longer shows redundant
	  method definitions.][85970]
	- [Trait implementations are toggled open by default.][86260] This should make the
	  implementations more searchable by tools like `CTRL+F` in your browser.
	- [Intra-doc links should now correctly resolve associated items (e.g. methods)
	  through type aliases.][86334]
	- [Traits which are marked with `#[doc(hidden)]` will no longer appear in the
	  "Trait Implementations" section.][86513]


	Compatibility Notes
	-------------------
	- [std functions that return an `io::Error` will no longer use the
	  `ErrorKind::Other` variant.][85746] This is to better reflect that these
	  kinds of errors could be categorised [into newer more specific `ErrorKind`
	  variants][79965], and that they do not represent a user error.
	- [Using environment variable names with `process::Command` on Windows now
	  behaves as expected.][85270] Previously using envionment variables with
	  `Command` would cause them to be ASCII-uppercased.
	- [Rustdoc will now warn on using rustdoc lints that aren't prefixed
	  with `rustdoc::`][86849]
