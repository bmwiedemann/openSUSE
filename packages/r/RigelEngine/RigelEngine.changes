Sat Sep  5 18:49:23 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.6.2
  General improvements
  * More robust sound format handling, fixing issues on some
    platforms where the audio device does not support 16-bit signed
    integer PCM output (e.g. web browsers)
  * It's now possible to navigate the options menu using a keyboard
  Gamepad support improvements
  * All menus, including the options menu, can now be navigated via
    gamepad.
  * The highscore name entry screen can now be exited using a
    gamepad.
  * When in-game, the "start" button on a gamepad now brings up a
    pause menu, allowing saving, loading, modifying options etc.
    without needing a keyboard.
  * When saving the game using a gamepad, a name is automatically
    generated for the saved game to avoid the need for a keyboard.
    The name contains episode, level, and difficulty.
  Bug fixes
  * When dying in a boss level after activating the boss, the music
    was not reset back to the pre-boss music.
  * The hint machine could be activated even without having the
    hint globe (by pressing up)

    specific level via the command line
    (example: -l L2 --difficulty easy)

    allowing the game to run on older GPUs which support
    OpenGL 3.0 but not GLSL 150.

  * OpenGL ES support was broken and is now fixed, allowing the
    game to run on some older GPUs and on a Raspberry Pi (not
    optimized yet)
  * Fixed a crash when running the game on Linux with Mesa
    software rendering
  Bug fixes
  * Fixed camera position being wrong upon respawning
  * Fixed missing animation for walking turkey

- Update to version 0.6.0-beta
  Overview
  * As of this release, the full game (Shareware and registered
    version content) can be completed without any known issues,
    making RigelEngine feature complete in terms of gameplay.
  * In addition, gamepad/controller support was further improved.
  Gamepad support improvements
  * Force field card readers, door locks, and teleporters can be
    triggered by moving the analog stick up. Previously, this
    worked only with the D-Pad
  * Improved analog stick sensitivity for piloting Duke's ship
  * It's now possible to use the analog stick for menu navigation,
    in addition to the D-Pad
  Bug fixes
  * It was possible for a ceiling sucker to try to eat Duke while
    he was already dying, which would lead to a crash. This is now
    fixed.
  * Fixed an inconsistency in the way blowing fans work. This was
    making certain areas in the game harder to reach than intended
    (e.g. the upper left edge allowing access to a laser pickup
    near the exit of O7)
  * Duke would fail to attach to climbing pipes in certain
    circumstances, making some jumps in O1 harder than intended.
  * Fixed initial camera offset being slightly wrong on some levels
  * Fixed red birds sometimes getting stuck after reaching the
    ground
  * Fixed some inconsistencies in how the red bird behaves
  * The water effect shader did not compile for OpenGL ES, making
    the game unplayable in GL ES mode (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi).
  * Fixed cloak not being removed when dying while cloaked
- Update to version 0.5.3-beta
  General improvements
  * Debugging functionality is now disabled by default. This
    prevents accidentally hitting one of the debug feature keys
    (like single step mode) during gameplay. It can be reenabled
    with a command line option (-d).
  Gamepad support improvements
  * Analog stick movement is more reliable, especially on a PS4
    ontroller, and there is much less unintended up/down motion
  * The trigger buttons (LT/RT aka L2/R2) can now be used for
    jumping/shooting in addition to LB/RB (aka L1/R1)
  * The game will now detect a gamepad if it's plugged in or
    turned on during gameplay
  Bug fixes
  * Conveyor belts with an upward slope (as found in level N7)
    did not work
  * Cloak was not effective when eaten by a snake or ceiling sucker
  * When cloaked, enemy shots were flying through the player
    instead of disappearing
  * Enemy rocket shots were missing acceleration
  * Explosion effect was missing for enemy rocket shots
  * Nuclear waste barrels were not affected by gravity or conveyor
    belts
  * Inconsistencies in climbing pipe movement which caused
    problems in level O1 are now fixed
  * Hover bot spawn machine was spawning indefinitely, instead of
    stopping after 30 bots
  * Bonuses 2 and 7 were potentially given incorrectly if the
    player died before reaching a checkpoint
  * Watchbot container would disappear if the carrier was
    destroyed after it had released the container
  * Stair stepping movement wasn't fully matching the original,
    causing an inconsistency with the conveyor belts found in O5
    and O6
  * Physics for items released from item boxes were incorrect,
    causing problems in O5 and O6

- Update to version 0.5.2-beta
  New features
  * When starting RigelEngine for the first time, a graphical file
    browser UI is shown. This allows choosing the location of the
    Duke Nukem II data files required for playing the game. The
    chosen location is stored in the user profile, so this only
    has to be done once.
  * Adds a button to the options menu to choose a different Duke
    Nukem II installation (only in main menu's options menu).
  Bug fixes
  * Added missing rocket fire sounds for episode 3 boss enemy
  * Stopped explosion sprites from incorrectly appearing in N4
    and N8
  * Fix
    and ed missing water animations
  * Fixed collision detection for player shots, which makes it
    possible to properly shoot the first burnable wall in M5 with
    a rocket launcher
  * Fixed collision detection for dynamic geometry, which fixed
    issues in N5
