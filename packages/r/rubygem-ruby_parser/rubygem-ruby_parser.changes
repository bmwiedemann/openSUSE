- updated to version 3.4.0
 * 1 major enhancement:
 
   * Replaced hand-written/optimized f'd-up lexer with an oedipus_lex
     generated lexer. This makes it roughly 40-50% faster.
 
 * 30 minor enhancements:
 
   * 2.0: Added support for a.b c() do d end.e do |f| g end
   * 2.0: Added support for a.b c() do d end.e f do |g| h end
   * Added -s flag to ruby_parse_extract_error to output timings.
   * Added RubyLexer #command_state and #last_state to deal with oedipus_lex differences.
   * Added String#lineno and #lineno= because I'm a bad bad person.
   * Added a bunch of RubyLexer scanning methods: beginning_of_line?, check, scan, etc.
   * Added a bunch of process_* methods extracted from old yylex. process_amper, etc.
   * Added lib/.document to save my laptop's battery from pain and suffering
   * Adjust lineno when we lex a bunch of blank lines.
   * Attach lineno to tIDENTIFIER values (strings, ugh)
   * Cleaned up and re-ordered node_assign to be faster (ordered by actual occurrance).
   * Extend RubyParserStuff#gettable to set the lineno if it comes in with the id.
   * Extended RubyParserStuff#new_case to take line number.
   * Finally dropped RPStringScanner's BS #current_line.
   * Finally dropped RPStringScanner's BS line number calculation (lineno). 
   * Implemented Sexp#add_all since we now have a test case for it.
   * Removed :call case of node_assign. I don't think it is possible.
   * Removed RubyLexer #extra_lines_added. No longer used. Complex heredoc lineno's possible screwed up.
   * Removed RubyLexer#parse_number. Handled by oedipus_lex.
   * Removed RubyLexer#yacc_value now that next_token returns pairs.
   * Removed RubyLexer's @src. Now taken care of by oedipus_lex.
   * Removed RubyParser#advance. RubyParser#next_token takes care of everything now.
   * Removed RubyParserExtras#arg_add. (presidentbeef! YAY!)
   * Removed lib/gauntlet_rubyparser.rb. I just don't use it anymore. Too slow.
   * RubyLexer#is_label_possible? doesn't need an arg
