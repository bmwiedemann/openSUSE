- Update to new upstream release 6.10
  * C codegen: test P vs PE in goto/call/ret statements in EOF
    actions, just before re-entering. If at the end of the input
    block then the EOF check is jumped to. This change prevents
    overrunning the buffer if control flow is issued in an EOF
    action without fixing the input pointer first. If a program
    properly issues an fhold before the control flow the program
    won't be affected.
  * Updated action label generation. The previous set of
    conditions for generating the label didn't cover actions
    coming from the eofAction pointer (eof trans covered since it
    points into the set of transitions).
  * Use separate signed/unsigned values for host type min/max.
    Using separate values avoids the need to type cast before the
    data goes into FsmCtx structs. Keep it in native types until
    it is used.
  * Optionally do not generate entry point variables. Adds
    noentry write option for data.
