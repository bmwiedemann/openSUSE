  protocol.file.allow always" to check section.

Thu May 19 12:26:50 UTC 2022 - Carmen Bianca Bakker <carmen@carmenbianca.eu>

- update to 1.0.0:
  - Added the ability to ignore parts of a file when running `reuse lint`. Simply
    add `REUSE-IgnoreStart` and `REUSE-IgnoreEnd` as comments and all lines
    between the two will be ignored by the next run of `reuse lint`. (#463)
  - Meson subprojects are now ignored by default. (#496)
  - Added `--skip-existing` flag to `addheader` in order to skip files that
    already contain SPDX information. This may be useful for only adding SPDX
    information to newly created files. (#480)
  - Added `--recursive` flag to `addheader`. (#469)
  - Ignore all SPDX files with their typical formats and extensions. (#494)
  - Add support for merging copyright lines based on copyright statement,
    transforming multiple lines with a single year into a single line with a
    range. (#328)
  - Deprecated `--explicit-license` in favour of `--force-dot-license`.
    `--explicit-license` will remain useable (although undocumented) for the
    foreseeable future. (#476)
  - Better support for unary "+" operator in license identifiers. For example, if
    `Apache-1.0+` appears as a declared license, it should not be identified as
    missing, bad, or unused if `LICENSES/Apache-1.0.txt` exists. It is, however,
    identified separately as a used license. (#123)
  - When `addheader` creates a `.license` file, that file now has a newline at the
    end. (#477)
  - `supported-licenses` command that lists all licenses supported by REUSE (#401)
  - `--quiet` switch to the `lint` command (#402)

Sun Aug 16 21:27:11 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.11.1:
  - Always write the output files encoded in UTF-8, explicitly. This is already the
    default on most Unix systems, but it was not on Windows.
  - All symlinks and 0-sized files in projects are now ignored.
  - The licenses CAL-1.0 and CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception contain an SPDX tag
    within themselves. Files that are named after these licenses are now ignored.
  - Fixed a bug where `addheader` wouldn't properly apply the template on
    `.license` files if the `.license` file was non-empty, but did not contain
    valid SPDX tags.
  - Add support for autoconf comment style (listed as m4).
    + Cython (`.pyx`, `.pxd`)
    + Sass and SCSS (`.sass`, `.scss`)
    + XSL (`.xsl`)
    + Mailmap (`.mailmap`)
  - Added `--single-line` and `--multi-line` flags to `addheader`. These flags
    force a certain comment style.
  - Added support for Mercurial 4.3+.
  - A pre-commit hook has been added.
  - When an incorrect SPDX identifier is forwarded to `download` or `init`, the
    tool now suggests what you might have meant.
  - Under the hood, a lot of code that has to do with Git and Mercurial was moved
    into its own module.
  - Fixed a bug with `addheader --explicit-license` that would result in
    `file.license.license` if `file.license` already existed.
  - Fixed a Windows-only bug to do with calling subprocesses.
  - Fixed a rare bug that would trigger when a directory is both ignored and
    contains a `.git` file.
