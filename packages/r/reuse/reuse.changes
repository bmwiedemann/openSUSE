Sun Jan 28 19:07:20 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.0.1:
  * `.qrc` and `.ui` now have the HTML comment style instead of
    being marked uncommentable.
  * This reverts behaviour introduced in v3.0.0: the contents of
    uncommentable * files are scanned for REUSE information again.
    The contents of binary files are not.
  * Implement handling LicenseRef in `download` and `init`.
  * Declared support for Python 3.12.
  * More file types are recognised:
    + TCL (`.tcl`)
    + Julia (`.jl`)
    + Modern Fortran (`.f90`)
    + Bazel (`.bzl`)
    + GNU Linker script (`.ld`)
    + Assembly code (`.s`)
    + Empty placeholders (`.empty`)
    + ShellCheck configuration (`.shellcheckrc`)
    + Pylint in-project configuration (`pylintrc`)
    + Lisp schemes (`.sld`, `.sls`, `.sps`)
  + Added comment styles:
  * `csingle` for Zig (`.zig`) and Hare (`.ha`)
  * Display recommendations for steps to fix found issues during
    a lint.
  * Add support for Pijul VCS. Pijul support is not added to the
    Docker image.
  * When running `annotate` on a file with an unrecognised file
    path, the tool currently exits early. To automatically
    create a .license file for unrecognised files,
    `--fallback-dot-license` has been added.
  * Ignore `.sl` directory as used by Sapling SCM.
  * Alpine Docker image now uses 3.18 as base.
  * The Git submodule detection was made less naïve. Where
    previously it detected
  * a directory with a `.git` file as a submodule, it now uses
    the git command to detect submodules. This helps detect
    (quoted from Git man page) "[repositories] that were cloned
    independently and later added as a submodule or old setups",
    which "have the submodule's git directory inside the submodule
    instead of embedded into the superproject's git directory".
  * No longer scan binary or uncommentable files for their
    contents in search of REUSE information.
  * `--force-dot-license` and `--skip-unrecognised` are now
    mutually exclusive on `annotate`.
  * No longer create and publish `-extra` Docker images. The
    `openssh-client` package is now in the main image.
  * No longer create and publish `dev` Docker images.
  * The `-debian` Docker image is now based off debian:12-slim.
    It used to be based on the python:slim image, which used
    debian:slim under the hood.
  * Removed deprecated `--explicit-license`.
  * Removed deprecated `addheader`.
  * No longer depend on `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` for
    documentation.
  * Syntax errors in .reuse/dep5 now have better error handling.
  * Reduced python-debian minimum version to 0.1.34.
  * Fix issue in `annotate` where `--single-line` and `--multi-
    line` would not correctly raise an error with an incompatible
    comment style
  * Fix parsing existing copyright lines when they do not have a
    year
  * Better handling of Lisp comment styles. Now, any number of
    ";" characters is
  * recognised as the prefix to a Lisp comment, and ";;;" is used
    when inserting comment headers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  1 21:32:01 UTC 2023 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to 2.1.0:
  * Added
    + Detect SPDX snippet tags in files. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#699)
    + More file types are recognised:
      + Fennel (`.fnl`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#638)
      + CommonJS (`.cjs`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#632)
      + Qt .pro (`.pro`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#632)
      + Qt .pri (`.pri`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#755)
      + Qt .qrc (`.qrc`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#755)
      + Qt .qss(`.qss`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#755)
      + Qt .ui (`.ui`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#755)
      + Textile (`.textile`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool##712)
      + Visual Studio Code workspace (`.code-workspace`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#747)
      + Application Resource Bundle (`.arb`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#749)
      + Svelte components (`.svelte`)
      + AES encrypted files (`.aes`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#758)
      + Jakarte Server Page (`.jsp`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#757)
      + Clang format (`.clang-format`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#632)
      + Browserslist config (`.browserslist`)
      + Prettier config (`.prettierrc`) and ignored files (`.prettierignore`)
      + Flutter pubspec.lock (`pubspec.lock`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#751)
      + Flutter .metadata (`.metadata`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#751)
      + Terraform (`.tf`, `tfvars`) and HCL (`.hcl`). (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#756)
      + Typst (`.typ`)
    + Added loglevel argument to pytest and skip one test if loglevel is too high
      (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#645).
    + `--add-license-concluded`, `--creator-person`, and `--creator-organization`
      added to `reuse spdx`. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#623)
    + Additional license metadata for the Python package has been added. The actual
      SPDX license expression remains the same:
      `Apache-2.0 AND CC0-1.0 AND CC-BY-SA-4.0 AND GPL-3.0-or-later`.
      (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#733)
    + Added `--contributor` option to `annotate`. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#669)
    + Added `--json` flag to `lint` command (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#654).
    + `reuse.ReuseInfo` now has `copy` and `union` methods. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#759)
    + `reuse.ReuseInfo` now stores information about the source from which the
      information was gathered. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#654, gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#787)
    + Added Ukrainian and Czech translations (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#767)
    + Added `--suppress-deprecation` to hide (verbose) deprecation warnings.
      (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#778)
  * Changed
    + Bumped SPDX license list to v3.20. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#692)
    + `reuse.SpdxInfo` was renamed to `reuse.ReuseInfo`. It is now a (frozen)
      dataclass instead of a namedtuple. This is only relevant if you're using reuse
      as a library in Python. Other functions and methods were similarly renamed.
      (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#669)
    + Sphinx documentation: Switched from RTD theme to Furo. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#673,
      gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#716)
    + Removed dependency on setuptools' `pkg_resources` to determine the installed
      version of reuse. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#724)
    + Bumped SPDX license list to v3.21. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#763)
    + `Project.reuse_info_of` now returns a list of `ReuseInfo` objects instead of a
      single one. This is because the source information is now stored alongside the
      REUSE information. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#787)
  * Deprecated
    + Pending deprecation of aggregation of file sources. Presently, when copyright
      and licensing information is defined both within e.g. the file itself and in
      the DEP5 file, then the information is merged or aggregated for the purposes
      of linting and BOM generation. In the future, this will no longer be the case
     unless explicitly defined. The exact mechanism for this is not yet concrete,
     but a `PendingDeprecationWarning` will be shown to the user to make them aware
     of this. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#778)
  * Removed
    + Python 3.6 and 3.7 support has been dropped. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#673,
      gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#759)
    + Removed runtime and build time dependency on `setuptools`.
      (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#724)
  * Fixed
    + Fixed automatic generation of Sphinx documentation via readthedocs.io by
      adding a `.readthedocs.yaml` configuration file (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool##648)
    + Fixed a compatibility issue where reuse could not be installed (built) if
      gettext is not installed. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool##691)
    + Translations are available in Docker images. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool##701)
    + Marked the `/data` directory in Docker containers as safe in Git, preventing
      errors related to linting Git repositories. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool##720)
    + Repaired error when using Galician translations. (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool##719)
- Version 2.0.0: This version was yanked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  5 00:22:48 UTC 2023 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.1.2:
  * It is now possible/easier to use the `build` module to build this module.
    Previously, there was a namespace conflict (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#640).
- Changes of 1.1.1:
  * Don't include documentation files (e.g. `README.md`) in top-level (i.e.,
    `site-packages/`) (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#657).
  * Include documentation directory in sdist
    (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#657).
- Changes of 1.1.0:
  * Added support for Python 3.11 (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#603).
  * More file types are recognised:
    + Kotlin script (`.kts`)
    + Android Interface Definition Language (`.aidl`)
    + Certificate files (`.pem`)
  * Added comment styles:
    + Apache Velocity Template (Extensions: `.vm`, `.vtl`)
      (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#554).
    + XQuery comment style (Extensions: `.xq(l|m|y|uery|)`)
      (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#610).
  * Some special endings are always stripped from copyright and
    licensing statements (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#602):
    + `">` (and variations such as `'>`, `" >`, and `"/>`)
    + `] ::`
  * Removed `setup.py` and replaced it with a Poetry configuration
    (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#600).
  * Updated PyPI development status to 'production/stable'
    (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#381).
  * The pre-commit hook now passes `lint` as an overridable argument
    (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#574).
  * `addheader` has been renamed to `annotate`. The functionality remains the
    same (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#550).
  * Bumped SPDX license list to v3.19.
  * `addheader` has been deprecated. It still works, but is now undocumented
    (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#550).
  * Releases to PyPI are no longer GPG-signed. Support for this is not present
    in Poetry and not planned (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#600).
  * Dependency on `requests` removed; using `urllib.request` from the standard
    library instead (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#600).
  * Repair tests related to CVE-2022-39253 changes in upstream Git. New
    versions of Git no longer allow `git submodule add repository path` where
    repository is a file. A flag was added to explicitly allow this in the test
    framework (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#619).
  * Sanitize xargs input in scripts documentation (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#525).
  * License identifiers in comments with symmetrical ASCII art frames are now
    properly detected (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#560)
  * Fixed an error where copyright statements contained within a multi-line
    comment style on a single line could not be parsed (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#593).
  * In PHP files, add header after `<?php` (gh#fsfe/reuse-tool#543).
- Adapt spec file to poetry.
- Update URL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 16 12:02:17 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Allow git to use the file: protocol: add "git config --global
  protocol.file.allow always" to check section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 12:26:50 UTC 2022 - Carmen Bianca Bakker <carmen@carmenbianca.eu>

- update to 1.0.0:
  - Added the ability to ignore parts of a file when running `reuse lint`. Simply
    add `REUSE-IgnoreStart` and `REUSE-IgnoreEnd` as comments and all lines
    between the two will be ignored by the next run of `reuse lint`. (#463)
  - Meson subprojects are now ignored by default. (#496)
  - Added `--skip-existing` flag to `addheader` in order to skip files that
    already contain SPDX information. This may be useful for only adding SPDX
    information to newly created files. (#480)
  - Added `--recursive` flag to `addheader`. (#469)
  - Ignore all SPDX files with their typical formats and extensions. (#494)
  - Add support for merging copyright lines based on copyright statement,
    transforming multiple lines with a single year into a single line with a
    range. (#328)
  - Deprecated `--explicit-license` in favour of `--force-dot-license`.
    `--explicit-license` will remain useable (although undocumented) for the
    foreseeable future. (#476)
  - Better support for unary "+" operator in license identifiers. For example, if
    `Apache-1.0+` appears as a declared license, it should not be identified as
    missing, bad, or unused if `LICENSES/Apache-1.0.txt` exists. It is, however,
    identified separately as a used license. (#123)
  - When `addheader` creates a `.license` file, that file now has a newline at the
    end. (#477)
  - `supported-licenses` command that lists all licenses supported by REUSE (#401)
  - `--quiet` switch to the `lint` command (#402)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 16 21:27:11 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.11.1:
  - Always write the output files encoded in UTF-8, explicitly. This is already the
    default on most Unix systems, but it was not on Windows.
  - All symlinks and 0-sized files in projects are now ignored.
  - The licenses CAL-1.0 and CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception contain an SPDX tag
    within themselves. Files that are named after these licenses are now ignored.
  - Fixed a bug where `addheader` wouldn't properly apply the template on
    `.license` files if the `.license` file was non-empty, but did not contain
    valid SPDX tags.
  - Add support for autoconf comment style (listed as m4).
    + Cython (`.pyx`, `.pxd`)
    + Sass and SCSS (`.sass`, `.scss`)
    + XSL (`.xsl`)
    + Mailmap (`.mailmap`)
  - Added `--single-line` and `--multi-line` flags to `addheader`. These flags
    force a certain comment style.
  - Added support for Mercurial 4.3+.
  - A pre-commit hook has been added.
  - When an incorrect SPDX identifier is forwarded to `download` or `init`, the
    tool now suggests what you might have meant.
  - Under the hood, a lot of code that has to do with Git and Mercurial was moved
    into its own module.
  - Fixed a bug with `addheader --explicit-license` that would result in
    `file.license.license` if `file.license` already existed.
  - Fixed a Windows-only bug to do with calling subprocesses.
  - Fixed a rare bug that would trigger when a directory is both ignored and
    contains a `.git` file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 23 16:17:07 UTC 2020 - Carmen Bianca Bakker <carmen@carmenbianca.eu>

Wed May 16 12:50:44 UTC 2018 - carmen@carmenbianca.eu

- Update to version 0.3.0:
  + Bill of materials output is now deterministic.  Entries are
    sorted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 17 12:14:17 UTC 2018 - carmen@carmenbianca.eu

- Update to version 0.2.0:
  + Added translations for Dutch, Esperanto and Spanish.
  + Added new `-only` and `-or-later` SPDX tags for GPL.
  + Based on argparse instead of click.
- Remove xfail-test.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 19 13:27:16 UTC 2017 - carmen@carmenbianca.eu

- Added package, version 0.1.1.
- Add xfail-test.patch to ignore a test that fails occasionally.
