This package should use just the content of the git tree. If you need
to make changes, make them in git and update the package from git (you
can send merge request if you don't have write access).

The online repository is at:
http://github.com/openSUSE/rollback-helper

For building the package from git run the service directly:
osc service disabledrun

Note that spec and changes files are not part of the git repo.
