- updated to version 2.1.1

  ## [2.1.1] - 2021-02-23 - [Janosch MÃ¼ller](mailto:janosch84@gmail.com)

  ### Fixed

  - fixed `NameError` when requiring only `'regexp_parser/scanner'` in v2.1.0
    * thanks to [Jared White and Sam Ruby](https://github.com/ruby2js/ruby2js) for the report

  ## [2.1.0] - 2021-02-22 - [Janosch MÃ¼ller](mailto:janosch84@gmail.com)

  ### Added

  - common ancestor for all scanning/parsing/lexing errors
    * `Regexp::Parser::Error` can now be rescued as a catch-all
    * the following errors (and their many descendants) now inherit from it:
      - `Regexp::Expression::Conditional::TooManyBranches`
      - `Regexp::Parser::ParserError`
      - `Regexp::Scanner::ScannerError`
      - `Regexp::Scanner::ValidationError`
      - `Regexp::Syntax::SyntaxError`
    * it replaces `ArgumentError` in some rare cases (`Regexp::Parser.parse('?')`)
    * thanks to [sandstrom](https://github.com/sandstrom) for the cue

  ### Fixed

  - fixed scanning of whole-pattern recursion calls `\g<0>` and `\g'0'`
    * a regression in v2.0.1 had caused them to be scanned as literals
  - fixed scanning of some backreference and subexpression call edge cases
    * e.g. `\k<+1>`, `\g<x-1>`
  - fixed tokenization of some escapes in character sets
    * `.`, `|`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `^`, `$`, `?`, `+`, `*`
    * all of these correctly emitted `#type` `:literal` and `#token` `:literal` if *not* escaped
    * if escaped, they emitted e.g. `#type` `:escape` and `#token` `:group_open` for `[\(]`
    * the escaped versions now correctly emit `#type` `:escape` and `#token` `:literal`
  - fixed handling of control/metacontrol escapes in character sets
    * e.g. `[\cX]`, `[\M-\C-X]`
    * they were misread as bunch of individual literals, escapes, and ranges
  - fixed some cases where calling `#dup`/`#clone` on expressions led to shared state

updated to version 2.0.3
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## [2.0.3] - 2020-12-28 - [Janosch MÃ¼ller](mailto:janosch84@gmail.com)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - fixed error when scanning some unlikely and redundant but valid charset patterns
    - e.g. `/[[.a-b.]]/`, `/[[=e=]]/`,
  - fixed ancestry of some error classes related to syntax version lookup
    - `NotImplementedError`, `InvalidVersionNameError`, `UnknownSyntaxNameError`
    - they now correctly inherit from `Regexp::Syntax::SyntaxError` instead of Rubys `::SyntaxError`
  
  ## [2.0.2] - 2020-12-25 - [Janosch MÃ¼ller](mailto:janosch84@gmail.com)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - fixed `FrozenError` when calling `#to_s` on a frozen `Group::Passive`
    * thanks to [Daniel Gollahon](https://github.com/dgollahon)
  
  ## [2.0.1] - 2020-12-20 - [Janosch MÃ¼ller](mailto:janosch84@gmail.com)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - fixed error when scanning some group names
    * this affected names containing hyphens, digits or multibyte chars, e.g. `/(?<a1>a)/`
    * thanks to [Daniel Gollahon](https://github.com/dgollahon) for the report
  - fixed error when scanning hex escapes with just one hex digit
    * e.g. `/\x0A/` was scanned correctly, but the equivalent `/\xA/` was not
    * thanks to [Daniel Gollahon](https://github.com/dgollahon) for the report
  
  ## [2.0.0] - 2020-11-25 - [Janosch MÃ¼ller](mailto:janosch84@gmail.com)
  
  ### Changed
  
  - some methods that used to return byte-based indices now return char-based indices
    * the returned values have only changed for Regexps that contain multibyte chars
    * this is only a breaking change if you used such methods directly AND relied on them pointing to bytes
    * affected methods:
    * `Regexp::Token` `#length`, `#offset`, `#te`, `#ts`
    * `Regexp::Expression::Base` `#full_length`, `#offset`, `#starts_at`, `#te`, `#ts`
    * thanks to [Akinori MUSHA](https://github.com/knu) for the report
  - removed some deprecated methods/signatures
    * these are rarely used and have been showing deprecation warnings for a long time
    * `Regexp::Expression::Subexpression.new` with 3 arguments
    * `Regexp::Expression::Root.new` without a token argument
    * `Regexp::Expression.parsed`
  
  ### Added
  
  - `Regexp::Expression::Base#base_length`
    * returns the character count of an expression body, ignoring any quantifier
  - pragmatic, experimental support for chained quantifiers
    * e.g.: `/^a{10}{4,6}$/` matches exactly 40, 50 or 60 `a`s
    * successive quantifiers used to be silently dropped by the parser
    * they are now wrapped with passive groups as if they were written `(?:a{10}){4,6}`
    * thanks to [calfeld](https://github.com/calfeld) for reporting this a while back
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - incorrect encoding output for non-ascii comments
    * this led to a crash when calling `#to_s` on parse results containing such comments
    * thanks to [Michael Glass](https://github.com/michaelglass) for the report
  - some crashes when scanning contrived patterns such as `'\ðŸ˜‹'`
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 21:43:06 UTC 2020 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.8.2

  ### Fixed

  - fix `FrozenError` in `Expression::Base#repetitions` on Ruby 3.0
    * thanks to [Thomas Walpole](https://github.com/twalpole)
  - removed "unknown future version" warning on Ruby 3.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 14:47:43 UTC 2020 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

updated to version 1.8.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ### [1.8.0] - 2020-09-20 - [Janosch MÃ¼ller](mailto:janosch84@gmail.com)
  
  ### Changed
  
  - dropped support for running on Ruby 1.9.x
  
  ### Added
  
  - regexp flags can now be passed when parsing a `String` as regexp body
    * see the [README](/README.md#usage) for details
    * thanks to [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/owst)
  - bare occurrences of `\g` and `\k` are now allowed and scanned as literal escapes
    * matches Onigmo behavior
    * thanks for the report to [Marc-AndrÃ© Lafortune](https://github.com/marcandre)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - fixed parsing comments without preceding space or trailing newline in x-mode
    * thanks to [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/owst)
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  8 09:52:37 UTC 2020 - Dan ÄŒermÃ¡k <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 1.7.1

  ### Fixed

  - Support for literals that include the unescaped delimiters `{`, `}`, and `]`. These
    delimiters are informally supported by various regexp engines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  3 10:35:34 UTC 2020 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.7.0

  ### Added

  - `Expression#each_expression` and `#traverse` can now be called without a block
    * this returns an `Enumerator` and allows chaining, e.g. `each_expression.select`
    * thanks to [Masataka Kuwabara](https://github.com/pocke)

  ### Fixed

  - `MatchLength#each` no longer ignores the given `limit:` when called without a block

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 19 07:28:44 UTC 2019 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.6.0

  ### Added

  - Added support for 16 new unicode properties introduced in Ruby 2.6.2 and 2.6.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  8 08:21:50 UTC 2019 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.5.1

  ### Fixed

  - Fixed `#options` (and thus `#i?`, `#u?` etc.) not being set for some expressions:
    * this affected posix classes as well as alternation, conditional, and intersection branches
    * `#options` was already correct for all child expressions of such branches
    * this only made an operational difference for posix classes as they respect encoding flags
  - Fixed `#options` not respecting all negative options in weird cases like '(?u-m-x)'
  - Fixed `Group#option_changes` not accounting for indirectly disabled (overridden) encoding flags
  - Fixed `Scanner` allowing negative encoding options if there were no positive options, e.g. '(?-u)'
  - Fixed `ScannerError` for some valid meta/control sequences such as '\\C-\\\\'
  - Fixed `Expression#match` and `#=~` not working with a single argument

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 17 11:50:20 UTC 2019 - Lukas Krause <lukas.krause@suse.com>

- update to version 1.5.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ### [1.5.0] - 2019-05-14 - Janosch MÃ¼ller

  ### Added

  - Added #referenced_expression for backrefs, subexp calls and conditionals
    * returns the Group expression that is being referenced via name or number

  - Added Expression#repetitions
    * returns a Range of allowed repetitions (1..1 if there is no quantifier)
    * like #quantity but with a more uniform interface

  - Added Expression#match_length
    * allows to inspect and iterate over String lengths matched by the Expression

  ### Fixed

  - Fixed Expression#clone "direction"
    * it used to dup ivars onto the callee, leaving only the clone referencing the original objects
    * this will affect you if you call #eql?/#equal? on expressions or use them as Hash keys
  
  - Fixed #clone results for Sequences, e.g. alternations and conditionals
    * the inner #text was cloned onto the Sequence and thus duplicated
    * e.g. Regexp::Parser.parse(/(a|bc)/).clone.to_s # => (aa|bcbc)

  - Fixed inconsistent #to_s output for Sequences
    * it used to return only the "specific" text, e.g. "|" for an alternation
    * now it includes nested expressions as it does for all other Subexpressions

  - Fixed quantification of codepoint lists with more than one entry (\u{62 63 64}+)
    * quantifiers apply only to the last entry, so this token is now split up if quantified

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  5 09:41:53 UTC 2019 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.4.0
