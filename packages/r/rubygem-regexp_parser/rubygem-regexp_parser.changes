  ### [1.8.0] - 2020-09-20 - [Janosch Müller](mailto:janosch84@gmail.com)
  
  ### Changed
  
  - dropped support for running on Ruby 1.9.x
  
  ### Added
  
  - regexp flags can now be passed when parsing a `String` as regexp body
    * see the [README](/README.md#usage) for details
    * thanks to [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/owst)
  - bare occurrences of `\g` and `\k` are now allowed and scanned as literal escapes
    * matches Onigmo behavior
    * thanks for the report to [Marc-André Lafortune](https://github.com/marcandre)
  
  ### Fixed
  
  - fixed parsing comments without preceding space or trailing newline in x-mode
    * thanks to [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/owst)
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  8 09:52:37 UTC 2020 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 1.7.1

  ### Fixed

  - Support for literals that include the unescaped delimiters `{`, `}`, and `]`. These
    delimiters are informally supported by various regexp engines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  3 10:35:34 UTC 2020 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.7.0

  ### Added

  - `Expression#each_expression` and `#traverse` can now be called without a block
    * this returns an `Enumerator` and allows chaining, e.g. `each_expression.select`
    * thanks to [Masataka Kuwabara](https://github.com/pocke)

  ### Fixed

  - `MatchLength#each` no longer ignores the given `limit:` when called without a block

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 19 07:28:44 UTC 2019 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.6.0

  ### Added

  - Added support for 16 new unicode properties introduced in Ruby 2.6.2 and 2.6.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  8 08:21:50 UTC 2019 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.5.1

  ### Fixed

  - Fixed `#options` (and thus `#i?`, `#u?` etc.) not being set for some expressions:
    * this affected posix classes as well as alternation, conditional, and intersection branches
    * `#options` was already correct for all child expressions of such branches
    * this only made an operational difference for posix classes as they respect encoding flags
  - Fixed `#options` not respecting all negative options in weird cases like '(?u-m-x)'
  - Fixed `Group#option_changes` not accounting for indirectly disabled (overridden) encoding flags
  - Fixed `Scanner` allowing negative encoding options if there were no positive options, e.g. '(?-u)'
  - Fixed `ScannerError` for some valid meta/control sequences such as '\\C-\\\\'
  - Fixed `Expression#match` and `#=~` not working with a single argument

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 17 11:50:20 UTC 2019 - Lukas Krause <lukas.krause@suse.com>

- update to version 1.5.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ### [1.5.0] - 2019-05-14 - Janosch Müller

  ### Added

  - Added #referenced_expression for backrefs, subexp calls and conditionals
    * returns the Group expression that is being referenced via name or number

  - Added Expression#repetitions
    * returns a Range of allowed repetitions (1..1 if there is no quantifier)
    * like #quantity but with a more uniform interface

  - Added Expression#match_length
    * allows to inspect and iterate over String lengths matched by the Expression

  ### Fixed

  - Fixed Expression#clone "direction"
    * it used to dup ivars onto the callee, leaving only the clone referencing the original objects
    * this will affect you if you call #eql?/#equal? on expressions or use them as Hash keys
  
  - Fixed #clone results for Sequences, e.g. alternations and conditionals
    * the inner #text was cloned onto the Sequence and thus duplicated
    * e.g. Regexp::Parser.parse(/(a|bc)/).clone.to_s # => (aa|bcbc)

  - Fixed inconsistent #to_s output for Sequences
    * it used to return only the "specific" text, e.g. "|" for an alternation
    * now it includes nested expressions as it does for all other Subexpressions

  - Fixed quantification of codepoint lists with more than one entry (\u{62 63 64}+)
    * quantifiers apply only to the last entry, so this token is now split up if quantified
