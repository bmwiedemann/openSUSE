  *   Raise exception when calling `to_h` in an unfiltered Parameters.
  
      This method will raise on unfiltered Parameters if
      `config.action_controller.raise_on_unfiltered_parameters` is true.
  
      Before we returned either an empty hash or only the always permitted parameters
      (`:controller` and `:action` by default).
  
      The previous behavior was dangerous because in order to get the attributes users
      usually fallback to use `to_unsafe_h` that could potentially introduce security issues.
  
      *Rafael Mendonça França*
  
  *   Add `ActionController::Parameters#to_hash` to implicit conversion.
  
      Now methods that implicit convert objects to a hash will be able to work without
      requiring the users to change their implementation.
  
      This method will return a `Hash` instead of a `ActiveSupport::HashWithIndefirentAccess`
      to mimic the same implementation of `ActiveSupport::HashWithIndefirentAccess#to_hash`.
  
      This method will raise on unfiltered Parameters if
      `config.action_controller.raise_on_unfiltered_parameters` is true.
  
      *Rafael Mendonça França*
  
  *   Undeprecate `ActionController::Parameters#to_query` and `#to_param`.
  
      Previously it was raising a deprecation because it may be unsafe to use those methods
      in an unfiltered parameter. Now we delegate to `#to_h` that already raise an error when
      the Parameters instance is not permitted.
  
      This also fix a bug when using `#to_query` in a hash that contains a
      `ActionController::Parameters` instance and was returning the name of the class in the
      string.
  
      *Rafael Mendonça França*
  
  *   Use more specific check for :format in route path
  
      The current check for whether to add an optional format to the path is very lax
      and will match things like `:format_id` where there are nested resources, e.g:
  
      ``` ruby
      resources :formats do
        resources :items
      end
      ```
  
      Fix this by using a more restrictive regex pattern that looks for the patterns
      `(.:format)`, `.:format` or `/` at the end of the path. Note that we need to
      allow for multiple closing parenthesis since the route may be of this form:
  
      ``` ruby
      get "/books(/:action(.:format))", controller: "books"
      ```
  
      This probably isn't what's intended since it means that the default index action
      route doesn't support a format but we have a test for it so we need to allow it.
  
      Fixes #28517.
  
      *Andrew White*
  
  *   Don't include default headers in `ActionController::Metal` responses
  
      The commit e16afe6 introduced an unintentional change of behavior where the default
      headers were included in responses from `ActionController::Metai` based controllers.
      This is now reverted to the previous behavior of having no default headers.
  
      Fixes #25820.
  
      *Jon Moss*
  
  *   Fix malformed URLS when using `ApplicationController.renderer`
  
      The Rack environment variable `rack.url_scheme` was not being set so `scheme` was
      returning `nil`. This caused URLs to be malformed with the default settings.
      Fix this by setting `rack.url_scheme` when the environment is normalized.
  
      Fixes #28151.
  
      *George Vrettos*
  
  *   Commit flash changes when using a redirect route.
  
      Fixes #27992.

 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## Rails 5.0.1 (December 21, 2016) ##
  
  *   Restored correct `charset` behavior on `send_data` and `send_file`: while
      they should pass along any supplied value, they should not add a default.
  
      Fixes #27344.
  
      *Matthew Draper*
  
  
  ## Rails 5.0.1.rc2 (December 10, 2016) ##
  
  *   Move `cookies`, `flash`, and `session` methods back to
      `ActionDispatch::Integration::Session`.
  
      *Matthew Draper*
  
  *   Do not reset in `ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest#open_session`; doing so
      is incompatible with existing (unintended) API usage.
  
      *Sean Griffin*
  
  
  ## Rails 5.0.1.rc1 (December 01, 2016) ##
  
  *   Fixed error caused by `force_ssl_redirect` when `session_store` is
      enabled.
  
      Fixes #19679
  
      *Taishi Kasuga*
  
  *   Use accept header in integration tests with `as: :json`
  
      Instead of appending the `format` to the request path. Rails will figure
      out the format from the header instead.
  
      This allows devs to use `:as` on routes that don't have a format.
  
      Fixes #27144.
  
      *Kasper Timm Hansen*
  
  *   Fixed integration test requests appending and changing request paths.
  
          #Before
          post "/anything", params: params, headers: headers, as: :json
  
      "/anything" would be converted to "/anything.json" based on format.
      The path is now maintained and the format is respected based on `:as`
      option.
  
      Fixes #27144.
  
  *   Fixes incorrect output from rails routes when using singular resources.
  
      Fixes #26606.
  
      *Erick Reyna*
  
  *   Fixes multiple calls to `logger.fatal` instead of a single call,
      for every line in an exception backtrace, when printing trace
      from `DebugExceptions` middleware.
  
      Fixes #26134.
  
      *Vipul A M*
  
  *   Add `ActionController::Parameters#merge!`, which behaves the same as `Hash#merge!`.
  
      *Yuji Yaginuma*
  
  *   Added `ActionController::Parameters#deep_dup` which actually creates
      a params copy, instead of refereing to old references in params.
  
      Fixes #26566.
  
      *Pavel Evstigneev*, *Rafael Mendonça França*
  
  *   Make `fixture_file_upload` work in integration tests.
  
      *Yuji Yaginuma*
  
  *   Add `to_param` to `ActionController::Parameters` deprecations.
  
      In the future `ActionController::Parameters` are discouraged from being used
      in URLs without explicit whitelisting. Go through `to_h` to use `to_param`.
  
      *Kir Shatrov*
  
  *   Fix nested multiple roots
  
      The PR #20940 enabled the use of multiple roots with different constraints
      at the top level but unfortunately didn't work when those roots were inside
      a namespace and also broke the use of root inside a namespace after a top
      level root was defined because the check for the existence of the named route
      used the global :root name and not the namespaced name.
  
      This is fixed by using the name_for_action method to expand the :root name to
      the full namespaced name. We can pass nil for the second argument as we're not
      dealing with resource definitions so don't need to handle the cases for edit
      and new routes.
  
      Fixes #26148.
  
      *Ryo Hashimoto*, *Andrew White*
  
  *   SSL: Changes redirect behavior for all non-GET and non-HEAD requests
      (like POST/PUT/PATCH etc) to `http://` resources to redirect to `https://`
      with a [307 status code](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.7) instead of [301 status code](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.2).
  
      307 status code instructs the HTTP clients to preserve the original
      request method while redirecting. It has been part of HTTP RFC since
      1999 and is implemented/recognized by most (if not all) user agents.
  
          # Before
          POST http://example.com/articles (i.e. ArticlesContoller#create)
          redirects to
          GET https://example.com/articles (i.e. ArticlesContoller#index)
  
          # After
          POST http://example.com/articles (i.e. ArticlesContoller#create)
          redirects to
          POST https://example.com/articles (i.e. ArticlesContoller#create)
  
      *Chirag Singhal*
  
  *   Add `:as` option to `ActionController:TestCase#process` and related methods.
  
      Specifying `as: mime_type` allows the `CONTENT_TYPE` header to be specified
      in controller tests without manually doing this through `@request.headers['CONTENT_TYPE']`.
  
      *Everest Stefan Munro-Zeisberger*
  
  *   Prevent autoload from deadlocking while ActionController::Live is streaming.
  
      *Alex Chinn*
  
  *   Don't override the `Accept` header in integration tests when called with `xhr: true`.
  
      Fixes #25859.
  
      *David Chen*
  
  *   Reset a new session directly after its creation in `ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest#open_session`.
  
      Fixes #22742.
  
      *Tawan Sierek*
  
  *   Fix 'defaults' option for root route.
  
      A regression from some refactoring for the 5.0 release, this change
      fixes the use of 'defaults' (default parameters) in the 'root' routing method.
  
      *Chris Arcand*
  
  *   Check `request.path_parameters` encoding at the point they're set.
  
      Check for any non-UTF8 characters in path parameters at the point they're
      set in `env`. Previously they were checked for when used to get a controller
      class, but this meant routes that went directly to a Rack app, or skipped
      controller instantiation for some other reason, had to defend against
      non-UTF8 characters themselves.
  
      *Grey Baker*
  
  *   Don't raise ActionController::UnknownHttpMethod from ActionDispatch::Static
  
      Pass `Rack::Request` objects to `ActionDispatch::FileHandler` to avoid it
      raising `ActionController::UnknownHttpMethod`. If an unknown method is
      passed, it should exception higher in the stack instead, once we've had a
      chance to define exception handling behaviour.
  
      *Grey Baker*
  
  *   Handle `Rack::QueryParser` errors in `ActionDispatch::ExceptionWrapper`
  
      Updated `ActionDispatch::ExceptionWrapper` to handle the Rack 2.0 namespace
      for `ParameterTypeError` and `InvalidParameterError` errors.
  
      *Grey Baker*
  
  *   Deprecated omitting the route path.
      Specify the path with a String or a Symbol instead.
  
          # Before
          get action: :show, as: :show
          # After
          get "", action: :show, as: :show
  
      *Volmer*
  
  *   Added new `ActionDispatch::DebugLocks` middleware that can be used
      to diagnose deadlocks in the autoload interlock.
      To use it, insert it near the top of the middleware stack, using
      `config/application.rb`:
  
          config.middleware.insert_before Rack::Sendfile, ActionDispatch::DebugLocks
  
      After adding, visiting `/rails/locks` will show a summary of all
      threads currently known to the interlock.
  
      *Matthew Draper*
  
  *   Fix request encoding in Integration tests when string literals are
      frozen using `--enable-frozen-string-literal` or `# frozen_string_literal: true`.
  
      *Volmer*
  
  *   Since long keys are truncated when passed to ciphers, Ruby 2.4
      doesn't accept keys greater than their max length.
      Fixed default key length on cipher for `ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor`,
      which was causing errors on Ruby 2.4.
  
      *Vipul A M*
  
  *   Fixed adding implicitly rendered template digests to ETags.
      Properly ignore implicit template cache option to ETag, if `template: false`
      is passed when rendering.
  
      *Javan Makhmali*

      early in the `setup` chain.
  
      *Yves Senn*
  
  *   Parse RSS/ATOM responses as XML, not HTML.

  *   ActionController::TestSession now accepts a default value as well as
      a block for generating a default value based off the key provided.
  
      This fixes calls to session#fetch in ApplicationController instances that
      take more two arguments or a block from raising `ArgumentError: wrong
      number of arguments (2 for 1)` when performing controller tests.
  
      *Matthew Gerrior*
  
  *   Fix to keep original header instance in `ActionDispatch::SSL`
  
      `ActionDispatch::SSL` changes headers to `Hash`.
      So some headers will be broken if there are some middlewares
      on `ActionDispatch::SSL` and if it uses `Rack::Utils::HeaderHash`.

      nesting multiple routes.
  
      See #18373.
  
      *Ravil Bayramgalin*
  
  *   Fix regression where a gzip file response would have a Content-type,
      even when it was a 304 status code.
  
      See #19271.
  
      *Kohei Suzuki*
  
  *   Fix handling of empty X_FORWARDED_HOST header in raw_host_with_port
  
      Previously, an empty X_FORWARDED_HOST header would cause
      Actiondispatch::Http:URL.raw_host_with_port to return nil, causing
      Actiondispatch::Http:URL.host to raise a NoMethodError.
  
      *Adam Forsyth*
  
  *   Fallback to `ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT']` in `url_for`.
  
      Fixed an issue where the `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` environment variable is not
      prepended to the path when `url_for` is called. If `SCRIPT_NAME` (used by Rack)
      is set, it takes precedence.
  
      Fixes #5122.
  
      *Yasyf Mohamedali*
  
  *   Fix regression in functional tests. Responses should have default headers
      assigned.

 *   Prepend a JS comment to JSONP callbacks. Addresses CVE-2014-4671
     ("Rosetta Flash")
 *   Because URI paths may contain non US-ASCII characters we need to force
     the encoding of any unescaped URIs to UTF-8 if they are US-ASCII.
     This essentially replicates the functionality of the monkey patch to
     URI.parser.unescape in active_support/core_ext/uri.rb.
     Fixes #16104.
 *   Generate shallow paths for all children of shallow resources.
     Fixes #15783.
 *   JSONP responses are now rendered with the `text/javascript` content type
     when rendering through a `respond_to` block.
