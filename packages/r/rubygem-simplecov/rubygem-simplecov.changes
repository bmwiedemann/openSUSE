- updated to version 0.17.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  0.17.0 (2019-07-02)
  ===================
  
  Maintenance release with nice convenience features and important bugfixes.
  Notably this **will be the last release to support ruby versions that have reached their end of life**. Moving forward official CRuby support will be 2.4+ and JRuby support will be 9.1+. Older versions might still work but no guarantees.
  
  ## Enhancements
  
  * Per default filter hidden files and folders. See [#721](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/721) (thanks [Renuo AG](https://www.renuo.ch))
  * Print the exit status explicitly when it's not a successful build so it's easier figure out SimpleCov failed the build in the output. See [#688](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/688) (thanks [@daemonsy](https://github.com/daemonsy))
  
  ## Bugfixes
  
  * Avoid a premature failure exit code when setting `minimum_coverage` in combination with using [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests). See [#706](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/706) (thanks [@f1sherman](https://github.com/f1sherman))
  * Project roots with special characters no longer cause crashes. See [#717](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/717) (thanks [@deivid-rodriguez](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez))
  * Avoid continously overriding test results with manual `ResultMergere.store_results` usage. See [#674](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/674) (thanks [@tomeon](https://github.com/tomeon))

- updated to version 0.16.1
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  0.16.1 (2018-03-16)
  ===================
  
  ## Bugfixes
  
  * Include the LICENSE in the distributed gem again (accidentally removed in 0.16.0). (thanks @tas50)
  
  0.16.0 (2018-03-15)
  ===================
  
  ## Enhancements
  
  * Relax version constraint on `docile`, per SemVer
  * exception that occurred on exit is available as `exit_exception`! See [#639](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/639)  (thanks @thomas07vt)
  * Performance: processing results now runs from 2.5x to 3.75x faster. See [#662](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/662) (thanks @BMorearty & @eregon)
  * Decrease gem size by only shipping lib and docs
  
  ## Bugfixes
  
  * (breaking) Stop handling string filters as regular expressions, use the dedicated regex filter if you need that behaviour. See [#616](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/616) (thanks @yujinakayama)
  * Avoid overwriting the last coverage results on unsuccessful test runs. See [#625](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/625) (thanks @thomas07vt)
  * Don't crash on invalid UTF-8 byte sequences. (thanks @BMorearty)

## Bugfixes

* Fix merging race condition when running tests in parallel and merging them. See [#570](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/570) (thanks @jenseng)
* Fix relevant lines for unloaded files - comments, skipped code etc. are correctly classigied as irrelevant. See [#605](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/605) (thanks @odlp)
* Allow using simplecov with frozen-string-literals enabled. See [#590](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/590) (thanks @pat)
* Make sure Array Filter can use all other filter types. See [#589](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/589) (thanks @jsteel)
* Make sure file names use `Simplecov.root` as base avoiding using full absolute project paths. See [#589](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/589) (thanks @jsteel)

 ## Bugfixes

  * In 0.9.0, we introduced a regression that made SimpleCov no-op mode fail on Ruby 1.8, while
    dropping 1.8 support altogether is announced only for v1.0. This has been fixed.
    See [#333](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/333) (thanks (@sferik)


 0.9.0, 2014-07-17 ([changes](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/compare/v0.8.2...v0.9.0))

 ## Enhancements

   * New interface to specify multiple formatters.
     See [#317](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/317) (thanks @sferik)
   * Document in the README how to exclude code from coverage reports,
     and that the feature shouldn't be abused for skipping untested

   * Clarify Ruby version support.
     See [#279](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/279) (thanks @deivid-rodriguez)

     See [#245](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/245) (thanks to @bf4)
   * Using `Kernel.exit` instead of exit to avoid uncaught throw :IRB_EXIT when
     exiting irb sessions.

     See [#285](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/285)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- updated to version 0.8.2, see CHANGELOG.md (tons of those)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 28 05:56:51 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 0.7.1
  * [BUGFIX] The gem packages of 0.7.0 (both simplecov and simplecov-html) pushed to Rubygems had some file
    permission issues, leading to problems when installing SimpleCov in a root/system Rubygems install and then
    trying to use it as a normal user (see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/171, thanks @envygeeks
    for bringing it up). The gem build process has been changed to always enforce proper permissions before packaging
    to avoid this issue in the future.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 12 09:43:22 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 0.7.0
  * [FEATURE] The new `maximum_coverage_drop` and `minimum_coverage` now allow you to fail your build when the
    coverage dropped by more than what you allowed or is below a minimum value required. Also, `refuse_coverage_drop` disallows
    any coverage drops between test runs.
    See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/151, https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/11,
    https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/90, and https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/96 (thanks to @infertux)
  * [FEATURE] SimpleCov now ships with a built-in MultiFormatter which allows the easy usage of multiple result formatters at
    the same time without the need to write custom wrapper code.
    See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/158 (thanks to @nikitug)
  * [BUGFIX] The usage of digits, hyphens and underscores in group names could lead to broken tab navigation
    in the default simplecov-html reports. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov-html/pull/14 (thanks to @ebelgarts)
  * [REFACTORING] A few more ruby warnings removed. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/106 and
    https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/139. (thanks to @lukejahnke)
  * A [Pledgie button](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/commit/63cfa99f8658fa5cc66a38c83b3195fdf71b9e93) for those that
    feel generous :)
  * The usual bunch of README fixes and documentation tweaks. Thanks to everyone who contributed those!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 10 19:08:48 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- update to 0.6.4
 * [BUGFIX] Encoding issues with ISO-8859-encoded source files fixed.
   See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/117. (thanks to @Deradon)
 * [BUGFIX] Ensure ZeroDivisionErrors won't occur when calculating the coverage result, which previously
   could happen in certain cases. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/128. (thanks to @japgolly)
 * [REFACTORING] Changed a couple instance variable lookups so SimpleCov does not cause a lot of warnings when
   running ruby at a higher warning level. See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/106 and
   https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/pull/119. (thanks to @mvz and @gioele)
 * [BUGFIX] Modified the API-changes for newer multi_json versions introduced with #122 and v0.6.2 so
   they are backwards-compatible with older multi_json gems in order to avoid simplecov polluting
   the multi_json minimum version requirement for entire applications.
   See https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/132
 * Added appraisal gem to the test setup in order to run the test suite against both 1.0 and 1.3
   multi_json gems and ensure the above actually works :)
