  <title>Robinhood policy engine</title>
  <description>Robinhood Policy Engine is a versatile tool to manage contents of large file systems. It maintains a replicate of filesystem medatada in a database that can be queried at will. It makes it possible to schedule mass action on filesystem entries by defining attribute-based policies, provides fast 'find' and 'du' enhanced clones, gives to administrators an overall view of filesystem contents through its web UI and command line tools.
It supports any POSIX filesystem and implements advanced features for Lustre filesystems (list/purge files per OST or pool, read MDT changelogs...)</description>
