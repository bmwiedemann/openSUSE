-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 27 23:19:02 UTC 2021 - Marcin Bajor <marcin.bajor@gmail.com>

- Backport patch for glibc 2.34 compatibility, add
  fix-glibc_234-build.patch

  boo#1186455

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  8 11:35:53 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Adding -fno-tree-loop-vectorize because GCC10 causes a weird bug:
  https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/issues/5749

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  6 11:08:19 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 5.8
- Automatically recover detail lost to lens blur (diffraction)
  using the new Capture Sharpening tool, located in the “Raw” tab.
  It takes place right after demosaicing, and as it works in
  linear space it is not prone to haloing. Capture Sharpening in
  combination with Post-Resize Sharpening allows for detailed
  and crisp results.
- CR3 support: image data is decoded so you can process your raw files,
  but metadata is not supported yet. If you have an ICC or DCP input
  profile for your CR3-producing camera, you will need to point
  RawTherapee to it manually
  (Color tab > Color Management > Input Profile > Custom).
- Improvements of various camera models (new DCP dual-illuminant
  input profiles, raw crops, white levels, etc.), speedups and
  optimizations to various tools, better memory management,
  various bug fixes. See the git log for details.
- Remove shared libs from spec because it was building just a couple
  of .a libs
- Switched from -O2 to -O3, as suggested in the release notes 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 08:20:56 UTC 2019 - Marcin Bajor <marcin.bajor@gmail.com>

- Update to 5.7
- Film Negative tool, for easily developing raw photographs of film negatives.
- Support for reading “rating” tags from Exif and XMP, shown in the File Browser/Filmstrip using RawTherapee’s star rating system.
- Hundreds of bug fixes, speed optimizations and raw format support improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 20 21:09:30 UTC 2019 - Marcin Bajor <marcin.bajor@gmail.com>

- Update to 5.6
- New features since 5.5
* Pseudo-HiDPI support, for a smooth and sharp user interface regardless of screen size. 
  Pseudo-HiDPI mode is disabled by default, enable it in Preferences > General > Appearance. 
  Scaling in RawTherapee depends on font size, DPI and display scaling. 
  While scaling has been tested to work well in Windows, Linux and macOS,
  there are some macOS display modes which are incompatible with it,
  specifically those modes suffixed by "(HiDPI)" in macOS Display settings. 
  Some versions of macOS (10.14.*) seem to not list any modes, in which case the user must just give it a try.
* Ability to move tools to a new Favorites tab, http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/Favorites_Tab
* "Unclipped" processing profile, to make it easy to save an image while
  preserving data across the whole tonal range, http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/Unclipped
* User-adjustable tiles-per-thread settings in Preferences > Performance,
  for users who want to find optimal values for their system. The default value of 2 tiles-per-thread performs best overall.
* Hundreds of speed optimizations, bug fixes, and overall improvements. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 17 22:37:48 UTC 2018 - Marcin Bajor <marcin.bajor@gmail.com>

- Update to 5.5
- New features since 5.4
* Filter to remove striping artifacts caused by Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF) as seen in Sony cameras,
  and to remove banding artifacts caused by Nikon's too-aggressive in-camera PDAF correction.
  These are available for any camera which has a PDAF entry in camconst.json, currently:
  Nikon Z 6, Nikon Z 7, Sony DSC-RX1RM2, Sony ILCE-6000, Sony ILCE-6300, Sony ILCE-6500, Sony ILCE-7M3,
  Sony ILCE-7RM2, Sony ILCE-7RM3, Sony ILCE-9
* Ability to specify custom working color spaces through the workingspaces.json file.
* Unbounded processing - allows you to decide whether out-of-gamut colors should get clipped.
* Improved support for Canon mRaw format variants.
* New Shadows/Highlights tool (replaced previous one).
* Contrast threshold mask which divides an image into areas of high and low detail,
  allowing the effect of certain tools to be focused where it matters most and to mitigate the effect
  on areas where it would be undesirable, for example having the Sharpening tool affect only the in-focus
  subject without affecting the out-of-focus background. Available for:
  Sharpening, Post-Resize Sharpening, Microcontrast, Demosaicing
* Dual-demosaic algorithms, making use of the new contrast threshold mask, allowing one to use a combination
  of demosaicing algorithms where one is best for details and the other best for plain areas.
* New color toning methods:
  Grid, allowing you to separately tone the shadows and highlights using two points on a simple color grid.
  Regions, allowing you to tone based on any number of masks. Supports functions from the American Society of Cinematographers 
  Color Decision List (ASC CDL).
* Resizable main histogram with scaling modes: Linear, Log, Log-Log
  The log scales can be adjusted by click-dragging the mouse sideways inside the histogram area.
* Support for Blackmagic and Canon Magic Lantern lj92 encoded files.
* Allows you to specify how many border rows/columns to discard during demosaicing - those who shoot raw video at a standard resolution
  such as 1920x1080 will appreciate being able to preserve the dimensions.
* New Soft Light tool which enhances contrast and saturation by emulating the effect of blending an image with a copy of itself in "soft light" blending mode in GIMP.
* The Resize tool allows you to specify whether you want it to upscale or only downscale.
* New icon and cursor theme.
* ICC
* The bundled ICC profiles have been re-generated, and now include ICC v2 and v4 variants.
* If your screen's resolution is such that not all icons fit in a toolbar, you can now scroll the toolbar using the mouse scroll-wheel.
* New "Flexible" tone curve type. A characteristic of the cubic spline curve (renamed from "Custom" to "Standard") 
  is that editing one node could have a huge impact on what happens to the curve in relation to the other nodes.
  The new "Flexible" centripetal Catmull–Rom spline curve allows you to make adjustments to any part of the curve with little impact on the other parts.
* Allow saving both floating-point and integer type files at both 16-bit and 32-bit precision from RawTherapee GUI and CLI.
* Improved lensfun chromatic aberration correction.
* The raw chromatic aberration correction tool can now run in several iterations, and gained a feature to avoid introducing a color shift which could result from correcting chromatic aberration before demosaicing.
* Certain sliders now operate on a logarithmic scale, allowing for a meaningful response over large ranges.
* Dedicated "Reset" button in Crop tool.
* Support for new cameras, and new input color profiles.
* Speed enhancements and bug fixes, for a total of over 1300 commits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 21 20:45:21 UTC 2018 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to 5.4
- New features since 5.3
* New default processing profiles, now the default look for raw photos closely matches the out-of-camera look with regard to tones and includes lens distortion and vignetting correction.
* New histogram matching tool, to have RawTherapee automatically adjust the image for you to match the out-of-camera look with a single click of a button.
* New HDR Tone Mapping tool to compress the light in scenes with a high dynamic range, allowing you to show details in both shadows and highlights in a realistic way.
* New Local Contrast tool to boost clarity using a simple interface.
* New color toning method L*a*b* Color Correction Grid.
* New RCD demosaicing algorithm to minimize artifacts even with artificial lighting and strong chromatic aberration.
* New thumbnail overlay icons in the File Browser and Filmstrip to help you distinguish normal images from HDR and Pixel Shift ones.
* Added support for showing out-of-gamut areas based on the output profile.
* Added support for reading and writing metadata and ICC profiles to and from PNG images.
* Added support for processing Sony Pixel Shift ARQ raw files - make sure that the ARQ extension is enabled in Preferences > File Browser > Parsed Extensions.
* Create Sony ARQ raw files using https://github.com/agriggio/make_arq
* Added support for saving 32-bit floating-point TIFFs clamped to [0;1].
* Added profiled chromatic aberration correction support using Lensfun.
* More tools now have an on/off switch.
* The user interface is cleaner, with all power-house tools moved into a new "Advanced" tab to prevent slider-shock to newcomers.
* The Metadata tab now lets you choose whether you want to copy metadata unchanged, edit metadata or strip metadata when saving images. Now you can also make metadata changes in batch mode.
* The choice of whether the main histogram should display information using the working profile or the output profile is now available from the Editor tab's top toolbar.
* The Crop tool's aspect ratio now defaults to that of the image, and RawTherapee automatically zooms-to-fit the crop once it's placed.
* RGB input-type ICC profiles can now be used as output profiles.
* The saved reference image for profiling (created from within the Color Management tool) now contains metadata.
* PNG and compressed TIFF images make use of better compression.
* Shortcut key changes: Zoom-to-fit the crop using "f", fit the whole image using "Alt+f".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 30 21:02:42 UTC 2017 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to 5.3
- New features since 5.2
* CIECAM02 enhanced with control over the scene and viewing conditions.

* ACES, DCI-P3 Theater and DCI-P3 D65 output color profiles.
* Numerous speed optimizations and bug fixes. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 23 22:17:57 UTC 2017 - marcin.bajor@gmail.com

- Update to 5.2
- New Features since 5.1
* GIMP plugin to open raw images in GIMP using RawTherapee - see RawPedia.
* "Remote" mode (-R command line option) to allow opening images ("Open with" or passed as arguments) in a full-fledged instance. The -R mode allows you to open an image in an already-running instance of RawTherapee, if that instance was also started using -R. Opening an image without the -R option will open RawTherapee in "no-File-Browser" mode which lacks the File Browser and Queue tabs, and the Preferences button.
* Added DCP profiles for accurate color for: FUJIFILM X-T20
- Most significant improvements
* 4x speedup of the Microcontrast tool.
* CIECAM02 curves no longer cause a sudden jump in brightness.
* Improved stability in METM (Multiple Editor Tabs Mode) in Windows.
* Improvement to the MEOW (Multiple Editor Tabs in Own Window) mode.
* LCP files lead to better results.
* Large speedup and stability improvement when opening folders containing hundreds or thousands of images.
* Many memory leaks fixed.
* Pixel Shift speedups, reduction of memory requirements, and motion mask preview accuracy improved.
* The preview of the Tone Mapping tool is now much more accurate at any zoom level.
