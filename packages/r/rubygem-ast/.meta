  <description>AST is a library for manipulating abstract syntax trees.

It embraces immutability; each AST node is inherently frozen at creation, and updating a child node requires recreating that node and its every parent, recursively.

This is a design choice. It does create some pressure on garbage collector, but completely eliminates all concurrency and aliasing problems.</description>
