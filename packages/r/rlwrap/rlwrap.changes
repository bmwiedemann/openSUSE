Fri Sep 12 13:52:54 UTC 2025 - Daniel Donisa <daniel.donisa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.47

  * Bug fix

  - use libptytty by default and add --with-libptytty option to configure. Keep the original ptytty.c code as a fallback.
  - add libtinfow to the list of libraries that are checked for the presence of tgetent()
  - only look for filters in $RLWRAP_FILTERDIR and don't add this directory to filter's PATH
  - have rlwrap source conform to POSIX.1c (as we cannot use Polarhome anymore to test on ancient systems)
  - extend testclient with a test that spawns a child and then dies (testing the effect of --skip-setctty)
  - make configure backdate src/completion.rb a few seconds to prevent spurious calls to rbgen
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  6 13:55:18 UTC 2025 - Daniel Donisa <daniel.donisa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.46.2

  * Bug fix

  - python filters would cause "invalid escape sequence" SyntaxWarnings with python 3.12 or newer.
  -  --skip-ctty option skips making slave pty a controlling terminal
  -  warn (don't die) when a specified completion file is not found
  -  configure will bail out (not just warn) when no termcap -like library is found.
  -  additionally check for TERM when INSIDE_EMACS is set (allowing the use of rlwrap within shells run by emacs)
  -  gcc -Wformat-security would warn about rl_message() being used in an unsafe manner.
  -  silence unhelpful input/output error messages at command exit
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  8 16:55:32 UTC 2022 - Daniel Donisa <daniel.donisa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.46.1

  * Bug fix

  - When compiled with readline-8.2, correctly handle echo'ed user input when accepting a line (see #168)
  - This will disable bracketed-paste when compiled with readline-8.1 or earlier. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 21 08:28:23 UTC 2022 - Daniel Donisa <daniel.donisa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.46

  * Bug fixes:

  - rlwrapfilter.py would not find collections.Callable with newer (>= 3.10) python
  - rlwrapfilter.py would choke on rlwrap version strings (like 0.45.2) that cannot be converted by float()
  - rlwrap could segfault or garble prompts containing a carriage return
  - configure.ac would complain about obsolete macros with newest autoconf
  - Bind TAB to self-insert if no completions are specified on the rlwrap command line

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  9 12:13:24 UTC 2021 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Use upstream tar ball, that do not repack 
- Skip /usr/bin/env in filter scripts

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  8 13:59:05 UTC 2021 - Daniel Donisa <daniel.donisa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.45.2:

  * Bug fixes:

  - rlwrap enables bracketed-paste when instructed to do so by .inputrc, but would then never disable it at exit.
  - rlwrap -z (i.e. rlwrap when using a filter) would still open /tmp/rlwrap.debug after forking the filter command, preventing other users from running it afterwards
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 14 09:56:24 UTC 2021 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- switch to github release urls
- Update to 0.45.1:

  * Bug fixes:

  - rlwrap would always open /tmp/rlwrap.debug after forking child command, preventing other users from running it.
  - Fix args to setitimer() call to prevent EINVAL error on return
  - advise about --always-readline if in direct mode at first user ENTER keystroke
  - check for I_SWROPT even if isastream() is present (compile would fail on Oracle linux)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 13 13:29:55 UTC 2021 - Daniel Donisa <daniel.donisa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.45:
  * New features
    - --only-cook '!<regexp>' enables confident mode where every
      possible prompt that matches a regexp is cooked immediately
      (so that even prompts that get printed while handling a large
      paste are cooked).
    - --no-children (-N) now enables direct mode whenever the client
      switches to the alternate screen. This makes editors and pagers
      usable even when using --always-readline on non-linux systems
    - --always-echo echoes user input even when the client has
      switched off ECHO.
      filter makefilter to easily employ shell commands (like sed,
      or grep) as rlwrap filters
      filters can change (some) bindable and internal readline
      variables with a new RlwrapFilter method tweak_readline_oob()
  * Bug fixes
    - rlwrap now correctly handles bracketed paste
      --ansi-colour-aware (-A) didn't do anything at all. Now it
    - recognises colour codes as well as common control codes like
      window titles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 23 01:32:51 UTC 2021 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.44:
  * rlwrap is now aware of multi-byte characters and correctly handles prompts (or
  things that look like prompts, e.g. progress indicators) that contain them.
  * rlwrap filters can now also filter signals (see RlwrapFilter(3pm)),
  changing them, or providing extra input to the rlwrapped command.
  * Key sequences can now be bound to rlwrap-direct-keypress (using a new
  readline command rlwrap-direct-prefix) (contributed by Yuri d'Elia) 
- drop reproducible.patch (obsolete)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 17 15:40:33 UTC 2018 - bwiedemann@suse.com

- Add reproducible.patch to fix a build race (boo#1102408)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  3 14:43:32 UTC 2017 - aavindraa@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.43:
 * New features
   - Filters can now be written in python 
   - Filters can respond to hotkeys (i.e. single keypresses bound to rlwrap-hotkey in .inputrc)
 * Bug fixes
   - rlwrap now always searches terminfo before termcap.
   - playing back a readline macro consisting of more than one line would crash rlwrap.
   - rlwrap --one-shot could accept more than one line when input in quick succession.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 18 21:41:44 UTC 2015 - sfalken@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.42:
  + Changes from 0.37 to 0.40
    - configure will now find tgentent() in libtinfo
    - compiling with gcc -O2 made rlwrap hang after Ctrl-D on
      empty line
    - HP-UX 11 has weird tgentent() return values, confusing rlwrap
    - Solaris: rlwrap would sometimes fail with "TIOCSWINSZ failed
      on slave pty"
    - Single quote ' is now word-breaking by default
    - multi-line edit would mangle upper ASCII and UTF-8 (and still
      does that to UTF-16 :( )
    - added --extra-char-after-completion and --multi-line-ext
    - rlwrap now recognizes the 'rmcup' and 'rmkx' character
      sequences used by programs that use an alternate screen
      (like editors and pagers) to return from it.
    - configure will now correctly determine pty type on SCO
    - rlwrap --no-children would leak file descriptors to
      /proc/<command_pid>/wchan
    - non-ASCII characters in multi-lin input are no longer
      replaced by spaces after calling an external editor
    - running rlwrap within emacs would crash (division by zero)
      rlwrap now bails out whenever terminal width == 0
    - added --enable-proc-mountpoint config option to use alternate
      linux-like proc filesystems (like in FreeBSD) for finding 
      <command>s working dir (-c option) and kernel function in which
      <command> is sleeping (-N option)
    - added prototype for copy_without_ignore_markers, fixing a
      segfault on FreeBSD
    - Filters now get complete echo lines even if the echo comes
      back in chunks
  + Changes from 0.40 to 0.41
    - Slightly late SIGCHLD could cause an I/O error on master pty
    - Added -W (-polling) option to poll slave pty for changes in
      its interrupt character and ISIG flag.
    - if $TERM is not found in termcap/terminfo database, use vt100
  + Changes from 0.41 to 0.42
    - Added --mirror-arguments (-U) option
    - On SunOS tcgetattr(slave pty) failed with "Invalid argument"
    - If the completion list contained two words, one of which a
      prefix of the other (e.g. "sea" and "seagull") the shorter
      one would be skipped when displaying a list of completions
    - reading completion files (with the -f option, or from
      $RLWRAP_HOME/<command>_completions) could fail with an
      incorrect ENOENT ("No such file or directory")
    - rlwrap -z listing wouldn't list filters
    - When both master and slave pty are unfit for sensing slave
      commands terminal settings, rlwrap now bails out with an
      error "cannot determine terminal mode of slave command"
  + Dropped:
    - rlwrap-0.37.tar.bz2
  + Added:
    - rlwrap-0.42.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 19 11:47:49 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.37:
  + Commands that emit "status lines" using backspaces and carriage
    returns could confuse rlwrap
  + rlwrap uses C strings internally, and thus cannot cope with
    command output that contains zero bytes (padding). It used to
    replace these with spaces, now the zero bytes are removed.
  + If the RLWRAP_HOME is set, but $RLWRAP_HOME doesn't exist,
    rlwrap will create it
  + Typo: SIGERR instead of SIG_ERR in signals.c

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  6 14:40:29 UTC 2010 - hvogel@novell.com

- Update to version 0.36
 * When rlwrap kills itself after a command crash it will not dump
   core, in order to avoid clobbering command's core dump.
 * Many small improvements and fixes for multi-line input 
 * Many small fixes and improvements in signal handling 
 * Added --one-shot (-o) and --only-cook (-O) options
 * Added EXAMPLES section and -t option to rlwrap manpage
 * prefix arguments are now correctly reset
 * Hyphens in rlwrap manpage are now all properly escaped
 * Major new feature: filtering. Filters sit between rlwrap and the
   wrapped command, re-writing command output, input, prompts,
   history, and completion word lists. 
 * At program exit, rlwrap now outputs a newline only when the client 
   didn't.       
 * Added -g, -I, -N, -S, -w and -z options
 * -p option now takes colour names (-pYellow)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 16 16:05:45 CET 2008 - hvogel@suse.de

- Update to version 0.30:
  * EOF on stdin (e.g. by pressing CTRL-D) would end prompt colouring.
  * added -q option 
  * added -A option to handle (ANSI-)coloured prompts
  * added -p option to colourise uncoloured prompts 
  * added -t option to set terminal type for client command
  * rlwrap now copies its terminal settings from the client
    even when this has put its terminal in single-keypress
    (uncooked) mode. A rlwrapped emacs will now respond to CTRL-C 
    and CTRL-G as it should.
  * error messages and warnings now include the rlwrap version number 
  * added a very simple custom malloc/free debugger for use with the 
    --debug option. Rather fragile and not well tested, use with care.
  * Whenever TERM is not set, rlwrap assumes vt100. Set TERM=dumb if
    you really have a dumb terminal.
  * rlwrap now leaves the handling of multi-line prompts and edit
    buffers to readline (except when in horizontal-scroll mode or when 
    configured with --enable-homegrown-redisplay).  
  * whenever --always-readline is set, SIGWINCH not passed to 
    client command immediately, but only *after* accepting a line.
  * --spy-on-readline now enabled by default
