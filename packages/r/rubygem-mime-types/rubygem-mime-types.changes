  == 3.1 / 2016-05-22
  
  * 1 documentation change:
  
    * Tim Smith (@tas50) updated the build badges to be SVGs to improve
      readability on high-density (retina) screens with pull request
      {#112}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/112].
  
  * 3 bug fixes
  
    * A test for MIME::Types::Cache fails under Ruby 2.3 because of frozen
      strings, {#118}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/118].
      This has been fixed.
  
    * The JSON data has been incorrectly encoded since the release of mime-types
      3 on the +xrefs+ field, because of the switch to using a Set to store
      cross-reference information. This has been fixed.
  
    * A tentative fix for
      {#117}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/117] has been
      applied, removing the only circular require dependencies that exist (and
      for which there was code to prevent, but the current fix is simpler).
      I have no way to verify this fix and depending on how things are loaded by
      +delayed_job+, this fix may not be sufficient.
  
  * 1 governance change
  
    * Updated to {Contributor Covenant 1.4}[Code-of-Conduct_rdoc.html].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 22 05:38:25 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 3.0
 see installed History.rdoc

  == 3.0 / 2015-11-21
  
  * 2 governance changes
  
    * This project and the related mime-types-data project are now exclusively
      MIT licensed. Resolves
      {#95}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/95].
  
    * All projects under the mime-types organization now have a standard code of
      conduct adapted from the {Contributor
      Covenant}[http://contributor-covenant.org]. This text can be found in the
      {Code-of-Conduct.rdoc}[Code-of-Conduct_rdoc.html] file.
  
  * 3 major changes
  
    * All methods deprecated in mime-types 2.x have been removed.
    * mime-types now requires Ruby 2.0 compatibility or later. Resolves
      {#97}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/97].
    * The registry data has been removed from mime-types and put into
      mime-types-data, maintained and released separately. It can be found at
      {mime-types-data}[https://github.com/mime-types/mime-types-data].
  
  * 17 minor changes:
  
    * MIME::Type changes:
  
      * Changed the way that simplified types representations are creatd to
        reflect the fact that +x-+ prefixes are no longer considered special
        according to IANA. A simplified MIME type is case-folded to lowercase. A
        new keyword parameter, +remove_x_prefix+, can be provided to remove +x-+
        prefixes.
      * Improved initialization with an Array works so that extensions do not
        need to be wrapped in another array. This means that <tt>%w(text/yaml
        yaml yml)</tt> works in the same way that <tt>['text/yaml', %w(yaml
        yml)]</tt> did (and still does).
      * Changed +priority_compare+ to conform with attributes that no longer
        exist.
      * Changed the internal implementation of extensions to use a frozen Set.
      * When extensions are set or modified with +add_extensions+, the primary
        registry will be informed of a need to reindex extensions. Resolves
        {#84}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/84].
      * The preferred extension can be set explicitly. If not set, it will be the
        first extension. If the preferred extension is not in the extension list,
        it will be added.
      * Improved how xref URLs are generated.
      * Converted +obsolete+, +registered+ and +signature+ to attr_accessors.
  
    * MIME::Types changes:
  
      * Modified MIME::Types.new to track instances of MIME::Types so that they
        can be told to reindex the extensions as necessary.
      * Removed +data_version+ attribute.
      * Changed #[] so that the +complete+ and +registered+ flags are keywords
        instead of a generic options parameter.
      * Extracted the class methods to a separate file.
      * Changed the container implementation to use a Set instead of an Array to
        prevent data duplication. Resolves
        {#79}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/79].
  
    * MIME::Types::Cache changes:
  
      * Caching is now based on the data gem version instead of the mime-types
        version.
      * Caching is compatible with columnar registry stores.
  
    * MIME::Types::Loader changes:
  
      * MIME::Types::Loader::PATH has been removed and replaced with
        MIME::Types::Data::PATH from the mime-types-data gem. The environment
        variable RUBY_MIME_TYPES_DATA is still used.
      * Support for the long-deprecated mime-types v1 format has been removed.
      * The registry is default loaded from the columnar store by default. The
        internal format of the columnar store has changed; many of the boolean
        flags are now loaded from a single file. Resolves
        {#85}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/85].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 04:32:57 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.6.2
 see installed History.rdoc

  == 2.6.2 / 2015-09-13
  
  * Bugs:
    * Emilio Losada (@losadaem) fixed an error where +each_with_object+'s block
      parameters are the inverse of those used by +inject+. Resolves
      {#107}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/107] with pull
      request {#108}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/108].
    * Matt Beedle (@mattbeedle) fixed a typo in MIME::Type::Columnar negatively
      affecting people who use the +use_instead+ functionality. Resolved in
      {#109}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/109].
  * Documentation:
    * Juanito Fatas (@JuanitoFatas) fixed a documentation issue with the README
      not properly linking internally on the generated rdoc source. Resolved with
      {#105}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/105].
  * Development:
    * Fixed a minor issue in the IANA registry parser that would generate empty
      +text+ xrefs if the +text+ section was empty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 28 04:30:45 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.6.1
 see installed History.rdoc

  == 2.6.1 / 2015-05-25
  
  * Bugs:
    * Make columnar store handle all supported extensions, not just the first.
    * Avoid circular require when using the columnar store.
  
  == 2.6 / 2015-05-25
  
  * New Feature:
    * Columnar data storage for the MIME::Types registry, contributed by Jeremy
      Evans (@jeremyevans). Reduces default memory use substantially (the mail
      gem drops from 19 Mib to about 3 Mib). Resolves
      {#96}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/96],
      {#94}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/94],
      {#83}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/83]. Partially
      addresses {#64}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/64]
      and {#62}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/62].
  * Development:
    * Removed caching of deprecation messages in preparation for mime-types 3.0.
      Now, deprecated methods will always warn their deprecation instead of only
      warning once.
    * Added a logger for deprecation messages.
    * Renamed <tt>lib/mime.rb</tt> to <tt>lib/mime/deprecations.rb</tt> to not
      conflict with the {mime}[https://rubygems.org/gems/mime] gem on behalf of
      the maintainers of the {Praxis Framework}[http://praxis-framework.io/].
      Provided by Josep M. Blanquer (@blanquer),
      {#100}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/100].
    * Added the columnar data conversion tool, also provided by Jeremy Evans.
  * Documentation:
    * Improved documentation and ensured that all deprecated methods are marked
      as such in the documentation.
  * Development:
    * Added more Ruby variants to Travis CI.
    * Silenced deprecation messages for internal tools. Noisy deprecations are
      noisy, but that's the point.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 26 06:36:34 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.5
 see installed History.rdoc

  == 2.5 / 2015-04-25
  
  * Bugs:
    * David Genord (@albus522) fixed a bug in loading MIME::types cache where a
      container loaded from cache did not have the expected +default_proc+,
      {#86}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/86].
    * Richard Schneeman (@schneems) provided a patch that substantially reduces
      unnecessary allocations.
  * Documentation:
    * Tibor Szol√°r (@flexik) fixed a typo in the README,
      {#82}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/82]
    * Fixed {#80}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/80],
      clarifying the relationship of MIME::Type#content_type and
      MIME::Type#simplified, with Ken Ip (@kenips).
  * Development:
    * Juanito Fatas (@JuanitoFatas) enabled container mode on Travis CI,
      {#87}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/87].
  * Moved development to a mime-types organization under
    {mime-types/ruby-mime-types}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  9 06:58:25 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.4.3
 * Bugs:
   * Restored Ruby 1.9.2 support by using +private_constant+ conditionally.
     Fixes {#77}[https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/77] found by
     Kris Leech (@krisleech). The conditional use of +private_constant+ here
     will be removed for mime-types 3.0, when Ruby 1.9.2 support will be
     unconditionally removed.
 
 == 2.4.2 / 2014-10-15
 
 * Bugs:
   * Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove) found a loading bug and provided a fix that
     nearly doubled registry load performance
     ({#74}[https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/74]).
   * Godfrey Chan (@chancancode) provided a prophylactic security fix to use
     <tt>JSON.parse</tt> instead of <tt>JSON.load</tt> in
     {#75}[https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/75]. This provides a
     20% improvement over the already improved result, resulting in a total 55%
     performance boost.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 15 11:01:47 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.4.1
  * Changed the sort order of many of the extensions to restore behaviour
    from mime-types 1.25.1.
  * Added +friendly+ MIME::Type descriptions where known.
  * Added +reg+, +ps1+, and +vbs+ extensions to application/x-msdos-program and
    application/x-msdownload.
  * Updated the IANA media registry entries as of release date.
    * Several MIME types had updated metadata (application/alto-*, RFC7285;
      application/calendar\+json, RFC7265; application/http, RFC7230;
      application/xml, RFC7303; application/xml-dtd, RFC7303;

      text/xml, RFC7303; text/xml-external-parsed-entity, RFC7303)
    * MIME::Type application/EDI-Consent was renamed to application/EDI-consent.
    * Obsoleted application/vnd.informix-visionary in favour of
      application/vnd.visionary. Obsoleted
      application/vnd.nokia.n-gage.symbian.install with no replacement.
    * Added MIME types: application/ATF, application/coap-group\+json,
      application/DCD, application/merge-patch\+json, application/scaip\+xml,
      application/vnd.apache.thrift.binary, application/vnd.artsquare,

Mon May 26 10:51:03 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.3
 * Updated the IANA media registry entries as of release date.
   * Several MIME types had additional metadata added on the most recent import.
   * MIME::Type application/pidfxml was renamed to application/pidf\+xml.
   * Added MIME types: application/3gpdash-qoe-report\+xml,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 15 18:45:59 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.2
 * Clarified contribution guidelines for MIME types. Resolves
   {#57}[https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/57].
 * Fixed a small bug where deprecated methods would warn of deprecation when
   called by internal methods. Resolves
   {#60}[https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/60].
 * Dropped Code Climate; added Coveralls for test coverage reports.
 * Removing external references to RubyForge, as it is shutting down. Resolves
   {#59}[https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/59].
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 23 09:24:52 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.1
 * API Changes (MIME::Type):
   * Added MIME::Type#xrefs and MIME::Type#xref_urls that have better handling
     of types of reference information. MIME::Type#references= has been
     deprecated. In a future release, both MIME::Type#references will be turned
     into a short-hand view on MIME::Type#xrefs, MIME::Type#urls will be an
     alias for MIME::Type#xref_urls, and MIME::Type#references= will be removed.
 * New or Updated MIME Types:
   * This information is now tracked in History-Types.rdoc.
 * MIME Type Development Tools
   * The IANA registry format changed, breaking the IANA registry tool
     previously used. Rewrote IANADownloader and IANADownloader::Parser as
     IANARegistryParser using the XML form.
   * The LTSW list has been dropped as it has not been updated since 2002.
   * The default Apache MIME types configuration list is now used to enrich MIME
     type data with additional extension information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 31 05:54:42 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.0, see History.rdoc
 
 * API Changes (General):
   * mime-types is no longer compatible with Ruby 1.8. Additionally, for its
     YAML operations (normally development and test), it requires a YAML parser
     that conforms to the Psych parser, not the Syck parser. This would only be
     a problem with an alternative Ruby 1.9.2 interpreter that does not
     implement the Psych parser conventions by requiring +psych+.
   * MIME::InvalidContentType has been renamed to
     MIME::Type::InvalidContentType.
 * API Changes (MIME::Type):
   * Construction of a MIME::Type can be with any of the following objects:
     * An array containing a valid content type identifier and an optional array
       of extensions. This allows MIME::Type.new to be used instead of
       MIME::Type.from_array for the most common use-case. Fixes #43.
       https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/43
     * A Hash containing the output of MIME::Type#to_h, as would be deserialized
       from the JSON representation of a MIME::Type. This replaces
       MIME::Type.from_hash using a different parameter set.
     * Another MIME::Type.
     * A content type identifier string.
   * Assignment of an invalid encoding to MIME::Type#encoding= will raise a
     MIME::Type::InvalidEncoding exception rather than a plain ArgumentError.
   * MIME::Type#url has been renamed to MIME::Type#references.
   * MIME::Type#use_instead is now tracked as its own attribute, not as part of
     MIME::Type#docs.
   * MIME::Type#system, MIME::Type#system?, MIME::Type#platform?,
     MIME::Type#to_a, MIME::Type#to_hash, MIME::Type.from_array,
     MIME::Type.from_hash, and MIME::Type.from_mime_type have been deprecated
     for removal.
   * Implemented YAML object encoding and decoding methods,
     MIME::Type#encode_with and MIME::Type#init_with.
   * Implemented JSON hash encoding methods.
   * Added MIME::Type#add_extensions to easily add extensions to a MIME::Type.
     Fixes #44. https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/44
 * API Changes (MIME::Types):
   * MIME type caching has been extracted to its own class. It is structurally
     similar to what was introduced with mime-types 1.25, but is no longer
     considered an experimental interface.
   * MIME type loading has been extracted to its own class. Loading has changed
     substantially.
   * MIME::Types#[] accepts a new filter flag, :registered. The :platform flag
     has been deprecated.
   * The MIME::Types#type_for platform parameter has been deprecated.
   * Added the ability for MIME::Types#type_for produce results for multiple
     filenames or extensions by providing an array as the first parameter. Fixes
     #42. https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/42
   * MIME::Types#add_type_variant and MIME::Types#index_extensions have been
     deprecated as public methods. They will be private in a future version.
   * MIME::Types#defined_types, MIME::Types.cache_file,
     MIME::Types.add_type_variant, and MIME::Types.index_extensions have been
     deprecated for removal.
 * Default Registry Changes:
   * The default registry is now a file in the directory data/, located via
     MIME::Types::Loader::PATH. +PATH+ is defined in the file
     lib/mime/types/path.rb so that system packagers only have to modify one
     file in order to put the registry in a location that is not where a gem
     version of mime-types would expect it. This resolves issue #36, reported by
     postmodern. https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/36
   * The default registry is now a single file in JSON format. This resolves
     issue #28 reported by jasonlor (an error with mime-types in MacRuby).
     https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/28
   * The default registry is compiled from YAML files in type-lists/, resolving
     issue #37 reported by postmodern requesting an easier-to-edit format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  3 08:10:13 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 1.25
 * New Features:
   * Adding lazy loading and caching functionality to the default data based on
     work done by Greg Brockman (gdb).
 * Bugs:
   * Force the default internal application encoding to be used when reading the
     MIME types database. Based on a change by briangamble, found in the rapid7
     fork.
 * New extensions:
   * mjpeg (video/x-motion-jpeg) based on a change by punkrats, found in the
     vidibus fork.
 * Modernized MiniTest configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 05:05:24 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 1.24
 * Code Climate:
   * Working on improving the quality of the mime-types codebase through the use
     of Code Climate. https://codeclimate.com/github/halostatue/mime-types
   * Simplified MIME::Type.from_array to make more assumptions about assignment.
 * Documentation:
   * LeoYoung <mrleoyoung@gmail.com> pointed out that the README.rdoc contained
     examples that could never possibly work because MIME::Types#[] returns (for
     all the versions I have handy) an array, not a single type. I have updated
     README.rdoc to reflect this.
 * Removed Nokogiri as a declared development dependency. It is still required
   if you're going to use the IANA parser functionality, but it is not necessary
   for most development purposes. This has been removed to ensure that Travis CI
   passes on Ruby 1.8.7.
 * New MIME Types:
   * 7zip (application/x-7z-compressed). Fixes a request by kodram.
     https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/32
   * application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Fixes a request by alexkwolfe.
     https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/39
   * Various new MIME types from IANA:
     * application/mbms-schedule\+xml from 3GPP and Turcotte.
     * application/provenance\+xml from W3C and Herman.
     * application/session-info from 3GPP and Firmin.
     * application/urc-grpsheet\+xml, application/urc-targetdesc\+xml,
       application/uisocketdesc\+xml from Zimmermann.
     * application/api\+json from Klabnik.
     * application/vnd.etsi.pstn\+xml from Han and Belling.
     * application/vnd.fujixerox.docuworks.container from Tashiro.
     * application/vnd.windows.devicepairing from Dandawate.
     * video/vnd.radgamettools.bink and video/vnd.radgamettools.smacker from
       Andersson.
 * Updated MIME Types:
   * RFC 6960 was adopted (application/ocsp-request and application/ocsp-response).

  GPL-1.0+)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 27 05:43:01 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 1.23
 * New Feature:
   * Arnaud Meuret (ameuret) suggested that it could be useful if the MIME type
     collection was enumerable, so he implemented it in #30. Thanks for the
     contribution! https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/30
 * Updated MIME Types:
   * RFC6910 was adopted (application/call-completion).
   * RFC6902 was adopted (application/json-patch\+json).
   * RFC6917 was adopted (application/mrb-consumer\+xml,
     application/mrb-publish\+xml).
   * RFC6922 was adopted (application/sql).
   * RFC2560 is being
     {updated}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pkix-rfc2560bis].
 * Administrivia:
   * The gemspec now includes information about the licenses under which the
     mime-types gem is available.
