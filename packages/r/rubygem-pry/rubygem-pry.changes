    - Add Pry::Testable, an improved modular replacement for PryTestHelpers. breaking change.
    - Add a new category module: "Pry::Platform". Loosely related to #1668 below.

  # Bug fixes

    - Fix a case of infinite recursion in Pry::Method::WeirdMethodLocator#find_method_in_superclass that users of the Hanami web framework experienced and reported since 2015.
    - Fix a bug where Method objects were not returned for setters inherited from a default (Pry::Config::Default). Eg, this is no longer an error:
    - Do not capture unused Proc objects in Text helper methods no_color and no_paging, for performance reasons. Improve the documentation of both methods.
    - Fix String#pp output color.

  as well as modules

  * pry-coolline now works properly with Pry (https://github.com/pry/pry-coolline)
  * alias_command method now much more powerful, e.g: alias_command "lM", "ls -M"
  * `whereami` is now more intelligent, automatically showing entire sourcecode of current method if current context is a method (thanks robgleeson).
  * new `raise-up` command. Allows you to raise an exception that will bubble out of pry (ending the session) and escape into enclosing program.
  
  remaining items:
  * fixed windows crashing bug when paging
  * lines ending with \ are incomplete (kudos to fowl)
  * `edit-method -n` no longer blocks (thanks misfo)s
  * show instance methods of modules by default in ls
