- updated to version 1.5.0
    * SafeListSanitizer, PermitScrubber, and TargetScrubber now all support pruning of unsafe tags.

        By default, unsafe tags are still stripped, but this behavior can be
        changed to prune the elementand its children from the document by passing
        prune: true to any of these classes' constructors.

- updated to version 1.4.2

  * Slightly improve performance.

    Assuming elements are more common than comments, make one less method call per node.

    *Mike Dalessio*

  ## 1.4.1 / 2021-08-18

  * Fix regression in v1.4.0 that did not pass comment nodes to the scrubber.

    Some scrubbers will want to override the default behavior and allow comments, but v1.4.0 only
    passed through elements to the scrubber's `keep_node?` method.

    This change once again allows the scrubber to make the decision on comment nodes, but still skips
    other non-elements like processing instructions (see #115).

    *Mike Dalessio*

  ## 1.4.0 / 2021-08-18

  * Processing Instructions are no longer allowed by Rails::Html::PermitScrubber

    Previously, a PI with a name (or "target") matching an allowed tag name was not scrubbed. There
    are no known security issues associated with these PIs, but similar to comments it's preferred to
    omit these nodes when possible from sanitized output.

    Fixes #115.

- updated to version 1.2.0

  * Remove needless `white_list_sanitizer` deprecation.

    By deprecating this, we were forcing Rails 5.2 to be updated or spew
    deprecations that users could do nothing about.

    That's pointless and I'm sorry for adding that!

    Now there's no deprecation warning and Rails 5.2 works out of the box, while
    Rails 6 can use the updated naming.
