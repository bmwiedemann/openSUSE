  [Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v3.9.1...v3.9.2)
  
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Emit a warning when `around` hook is used with `:context` scope
    (Phil Pirozhkov, #2687)
  * Prevent invalid implementations of `Exception#cause` from being treated as a
    valid cause (and causing strange errors) in `RSpec::Core::Formatters::ExceptionPresenter`.
    (Jon Rowe, #2703)
  * Correctly detect patterns when `rspec_opts` is an array in `RSpec::Core::RakeTask`.
    (Marc-André Lafortune, #2704)

    (Sam Joseph, Matt Rider, @okothkongo1, #2586)
  * Add `did_you_mean` suggestions for file names encountering a `LoadError`
    outside of examples. (@obromios, #2601)
  * Add a minimalist quick fix style formatter, only outputs failures as
    `file:line:message`. (Romain Tartière, #2614)
  * Convert string number values to integer when used for `RSpec::Configuration#fail_fast`
    (Viktor Fonic, #2634)

  * Prevent warning on Ruby 2.6.0-rc1 (Keiji Yoshimi, #2582)
  * Fix `config.define_derived_metadata` so that it supports cascades.
    (Myron Marston, #2630).

Sun Aug  5 18:58:12 UTC 2018 - mschnitzer@suse.com

- updated to version 3.8.0

	[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v3.7.1...v3.8.0)

	Enhancements:

	* Improve shell escaping used by `RSpec::Core::RakeTask` and `--bisect` so
		that it works on `Pathname` objects. (Andrew Vit, #2479)
	* Nicely format errors encountered while loading files specified
		by `--require` option.  (Myron Marston, #2504)
	* Significantly improve the performance of `--bisect` on platforms that
		support forking by replacing the shell-based runner with one that uses
		forking so that RSpec and the application environment can be booted only
		once, instead of once per spec run. (Myron Marston, #2511)
	* Provide a configuration API to pick which bisect runner is used for
		`--bisect`. Pick a runner via `config.bisect_runner = :shell` or
		`config.bisect_runner = :fork` in a file loaded by a `--require`
		option passed at the command line or set in `.rspec`. (Myron Marston, #2511)
	* Support the [XDG Base Directory
		Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/)
		for the global options file. `~/.rspec` is still supported when no
		options file is found in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rspec/options` (Magnus Bergmark, #2538)
	* Extract `RSpec.world.prepare_example_filtering` that sets up the
		example filtering for custom RSpec runners. (Oleg Pudeyev, #2552)

	Bug Fixes:

	* Prevent an `ArgumentError` when truncating backtraces with two identical
		backtraces. (Systho, #2515, Benoit Tigeot, #2539)

  [Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v3.6.0...v3.7.0)
  
  Enhancements:
  
  * Add `-n` alias for `--next-failure`. (Ian Ker-Seymer, #2434)
  * Improve compatibility with `--enable-frozen-string-literal` option
    on Ruby 2.3+. (Pat Allan, #2425, #2427, #2437)

  ### 3.6.0 / 2017-05-04
  [Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v3.6.0.beta2...v3.6.0)
  
  Enhancements:
  
  * Add seed information to JSON formatter output. (#2388, Mitsutaka Mimura)
  * Include example id in the JSON formatter output. (#2369, Xavier Shay)
  * Respect changes to `config.output_stream` after formatters have been
    setup. (#2401, #2419, Ilya Lavrov)
  
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Delay formatter loading until the last minute to allow accessing the reporter
    without triggering formatter setup. (Jon Rowe, #2243)
  * Ensure context hook failures running before an example can access the
    reporter. (Jon Jensen, #2387)
  * Multiple fixes to allow using the runner multiple times within the same
    process: `RSpec.clear_examples` resets the formatter and no longer clears
    shared examples, and streams can be used across multiple runs rather than
    being closed after the first. (#2368, Xavier Shay)
  * Prevent unexpected `example_group_finished` notifications causing an error.
    (#2396, VTJamie)
  * Fix bugs where `config.when_first_matching_example_defined` hooks would fire
    multiple times in some cases. (Yuji Nakayama, #2400)
  * Default `last_run_status` to "unknown" when the `status` field in the
    persistence file contains an unrecognized value. (#2360, matrinox)
  * Prevent `let` from defining an `initialize` method. (#2414, Jon Rowe)
  
  ### 3.6.0.beta2 / 2016-12-12
  [Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v3.6.0.beta1...v3.6.0.beta2)
  
  Enhancements:
  
  * Include count of errors occurring outside examples in default summaries.
    (#2351, Jon Rowe)
  * Warn when including shared example groups recursively. (#2356, Jon Rowe)
  * Improve failure snippet syntax highlighting with CodeRay to highlight
    RSpec "keywords" like `expect`. (#2358, Myron Marston)
  
  ### 3.6.0.beta1 / 2016-10-09
  [Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v3.5.4...v3.6.0.beta1)
  
  Enhancements:
  
  * Warn when duplicate shared examples definitions are loaded due to being
    defined in files matching the spec pattern (e.g. `_spec.rb`) (#2278, Devon Estes)
  * Improve metadata filtering so that it can match against any object
    that implements `===` instead of treating regular expressions as
    special. (Myron Marston, #2294)
  * Improve `rspec -v` so that it prints out the versions of each part of
    RSpec to prevent confusion. (Myron Marston, #2304)
  * Add `config.fail_if_no_examples` option which causes RSpec to fail if
    no examples are found. (Ewa Czechowska, #2302)
  * Nicely format errors encountered while loading spec files.
    (Myron Marston, #2323)
  * Improve the API for enabling and disabling color output (Josh
    Justice, #2321):
    * Automatically enable color if the output is a TTY, since color is
      nearly always desirable if the output can handle it.
    * Introduce new CLI flag to force color on (`--force-color`), even
      if the output is not a TTY. `--no-color` continues to work as well.
    * Introduce `config.color_mode` for configuring the color from Ruby.
      `:automatic` is the default and will produce color if the output is
      a TTY. `:on` forces it on and `:off` forces it off.

    conflicting keys if the value in the host group was inherited from
    a parent group instead of being specified at that level.
    (Myron Marston, #2307)
  * Handle errors in `:suite` hooks and provide the same nicely formatted
    output as errors that happen in examples. (Myron Marston, #2316)

  * Make sure example block is still available when using `duplicate_with`
    to clone examples. (bootstraponline, #2298)

  * Only consider example and group declaration lines from a specific file
    when applying line number filtering, instead of considering all
    declaration lines from all spec files. (Myron Marston, #2170)
  * Fix failure snippet extraction so that snippets that contain `do-end` style
    block and end with `end`-only line can be extracted properly.

    (Bradley Schaefer, #2144)

    the DRb connection error from being listed as the cause of all
    expectation failures. (Myron Marston, #2156)

  ### 3.4.0 / 2015-11-11
  [Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v3.3.2...v3.4.0)
  
  Enhancements:
  
  * Combine multiple `--pattern` arguments making them equivalent to
    `--pattern=1,2,...,n`. (Jon Rowe, #2002)
  * Improve `inspect` and `to_s` output for `RSpec::Core::Example`
    objects, replacing Ruby's excessively verbose output. (Gavin Miller, #1922)
  * Add `silence_filter_announcements` configuration option.
    (David Raffensperger, #2007)
  * Add optional `example_finished` notification to the reporter protocol for
    when you don't care about the example outcome. (Jon Rowe, #2013)
  * Switch `--bisect` to a recursion-based bisection algorithm rather than
    a permutation-based one. This better handles cases where an example
    depends upon multiple other examples instead of just one and minimizes
    the number of runs necessary to determine that an example set cannot be
    minimized further. (Simon Coffey, #1997)
  * Allow simple filters (e.g. `:symbol` key only) to be triggered by truthey
    values. (Tim Mertens, #2035)
  * Remove unneeded warning about need for `ansicon` on Windows when using
    RSpec's `--color` option. (Ashley Engelund, #2038)
  * Add option to configure RSpec to raise errors when issuing warnings.
    (Jon Rowe, #2052)
  * Append the root `cause` of a failure or error to the printed failure
    output when a `cause` is available. (Adam Magan)
  * Stop rescuing `NoMemoryError`, `SignalExcepetion`, `Interrupt` and
    `SystemExit`. It is dangerous to interfere with these. (Myron Marston, #2063)
  * Add `config.project_source_dirs` setting which RSpec uses to determine
    if a backtrace line comes from your project source or from some
    external library. It defaults to `spec`, `lib` and `app` but can be
    configured differently. (Myron Marston, #2088)
  * Improve failure line detection so that it looks for the failure line
    in any project source directory instead of just in the spec file.
    In addition, if no backtrace lines can be found from a project source
    file, we fall back to displaying the source of the first backtrace
    line. This should virtually eliminate the "Unable to find matching
    line from backtrace" messages. (Myron Marston, #2088)
  * Add support for `:extra_failure_lines` example metadata that will
    be appended to the failure output. (bootstraponline, #2092).
  * Add `RSpec::Core::Example#duplicate_with` to produce new examples
    with cloned metadata. (bootstraponline, #2098)
  * Add `RSpec::Core::Configuration#on_example_group_definition` to register
    hooks to be invoked when example groups are created. (bootstraponline, #2094)
  * Add `add_example` and `remove_example` to `RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup` to
    allow  manipulating an example groups examples. (bootstraponline, #2095)
  * Display multiline failure source lines in failure output when Ripper is
    available (MRI >= 1.9.2, and JRuby >= 1.7.5 && < 9.0.0.0.rc1).
    (Yuji Nakayama, #2083)
  * Add `max_displayed_failure_line_count` configuration option
    (defaults to 10). (Yuji Nakayama, #2083)
  * Enhance `fail_fast` option so it can take a number (e.g. `--fail-fast=3`)
    to force the run to abort after the specified number of failures.
    (Jack Scotti, #2065)
  * Syntax highlight the failure snippets in text formatters when `color`
    is enabled and the `coderay` gem is installed on a POSIX system.
    (Myron Marston, #2109)
  
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Lock `example_status_persistence_file` when reading from and writing
    to it to prevent race conditions when multiple processes try to use
    it. (Ben Woosley, #2029)
  * Fix regression in 3.3 that caused spec file names with square brackets in
    them (such as `1[]_spec.rb`) to not be loaded properly. (Myron Marston, #2041)
  * Fix output encoding issue caused by ASCII literal on 1.9.3 (Jon Rowe, #2072)
  * Fix requires in `rspec/core/rake_task.rb` to avoid double requires
    seen by some users. (Myron Marston, #2101)

  ### 3.3.0 / 2015-06-12
  [Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v3.2.3...v3.3.0)
  
  Enhancements:
  
  * Expose the reporter used to run examples via `RSpec::Core::Example#reporter`.
    (Jon Rowe, #1866)
  * Make `RSpec::Core::Reporter#message` a public supported API. (Jon Rowe, #1866)
  * Allow custom formatter events to be published via
    `RSpec::Core::Reporter#publish(event_name, hash_of_attributes)`. (Jon Rowe, #1869)
  * Remove dependency on the standard library `Set` and replace with `RSpec::Core::Set`.
    (Jon Rowe, #1870)
  * Assign a unique id to each example and group so that they can be
    uniquely identified, even for shared examples (and similar situations)
    where the location isn't unique. (Myron Marston, #1884)
  * Use the example id in the rerun command printed for failed examples
    when the location is not unique. (Myron Marston, #1884)
  * Add `config.example_status_persistence_file_path` option, which is
    used to persist the last run status of each example. (Myron Marston, #1888)
  * Add `:last_run_status` metadata to each example, which indicates what
    happened the last time an example ran. (Myron Marston, #1888)
  * Add `--only-failures` CLI option which filters to only the examples
    that failed the last time they ran. (Myron Marston, #1888)
  * Add `--next-failure` CLI option which allows you to repeatedly focus
    on just one of the currently failing examples, then move on to the
    next failure, etc. (Myron Marston, #1888)
  * Make `--order random` ordering stable, so that when you rerun a
    subset with a given seed, the examples will be order consistently
    relative to each other. (Myron Marston, #1908)
  * Set example group constant earlier so errors when evaluating the context
    include the example group name (Myron Marson, #1911)
  * Make `let` and `subject` threadsafe. (Josh Cheek, #1858)
  * Add version information into the JSON formatter. (Mark Swinson, #1883)
  * Add `--bisect` CLI option, which will repeatedly run your suite in
    order to isolate the failures to the smallest reproducible case.
    (Myron Marston, #1917)
  * For `config.include`, `config.extend` and `config.prepend`, apply the
    module to previously defined matching example groups. (Eugene Kenny, #1935)
  * When invalid options are parsed, notify users where they came from
    (e.g. `.rspec` or `~/.rspec` or `ENV['SPEC_OPTS']`) so they can
    easily find the source of the problem. (Myron Marston, #1940)
  * Add pending message contents to the json formatter output. (Jon Rowe, #1949)
  * Add shared group backtrace to the output displayed by the built-in
    formatters for pending examples that have been fixed. (Myron Marston, #1946)
  * Add support for `:aggregate_failures` metadata. Tag an example or
    group with this metadata and it'll use rspec-expectations'
    `aggregate_failures` feature to allow multiple failures in an example
    and list them all, rather than aborting on the first failure. (Myron
    Marston, #1946)
  * When no formatter implements #message add a fallback to prevent those
    messages being lost. (Jon Rowe, #1980)
  * Profiling examples now takes into account time spent in `before(:context)`
    hooks. (Denis Laliberté, Jon Rowe, #1971)
  * Improve failure output when an example has multiple exceptions, such
    as one from an `it` block and one from an `after` block. (Myron Marston, #1985)
  
  Bug Fixes:
  
  * Handle invalid UTF-8 strings within exception methods. (Benjamin Fleischer, #1760)
  * Fix Rake Task quoting of file names with quotes to work properly on
    Windows. (Myron Marston, #1887)
  * Fix `RSpec::Core::RakeTask#failure_message` so that it gets printed
    when the task failed. (Myron Marston, #1905)
  * Make `let` work properly when defined in a shared context that is applied
    to an individual example via metadata. (Myron Marston, #1912)
  * Ensure `rspec/autorun` respects configuration defaults. (Jon Rowe, #1933)
  * Prevent modules overriding example group defined methods when included,
    prepended or extended by config defined after an example group. (Eugene Kenny, #1935)
  * Fix regression which caused shared examples to be mistakenly run when specs
    where filtered to a particular location.  (Ben Axnick, #1963)
  * Fix time formatting logic so that it displays 70 seconds as "1 minute,
    10 seconds" rather than "1 minute, 1 second". (Paul Brennan, #1984)
  * Fix regression where the formatter loader would allow duplicate formatters.
    (Jon Rowe, #1990)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 11 06:04:47 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 3.2.3
 Bug Fixes:
 
 * Fix how the DSL methods are defined so that RSpec is compatible with
   gems that define methods of the same name on `Kernel` (such as
   the `its-it` gem). (Alex Kwiatkowski, Ryan Ong, #1907)
 * Fix `before(:context) { skip }` so that it does not wrongly cause the
   spec suite to exit with a non-zero status when no examples failed.
   (Myron Marston, #1926)
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 20 20:48:34 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 3.2.2
 Bug Fixes:
 
 * Fix regression in 3.2.0 that allowed tag-filtered examples to
   run even if there was a location filter applied to the spec
   file that was intended to limit the file to other examples.
   (#1894, Myron Marston)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 26 06:19:30 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 3.2.1
 Bug Fixes:
 
 * Notify start-of-run seed _before_ `start` notification rather than
   _after_ so that formatters like Fuubar work properly. (Samuel Esposito, #1882)
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  6 20:23:34 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 3.2.0
 Enhancements:
 
 * Improve the `inspect` output of example groups. (Mike Dalton, #1687)
 * When rake task fails, only output the command if `verbose` flag is
   set. (Ben Snape, #1704)
 * Add `RSpec.clear_examples` as a clear way to reset examples in between
   spec runs, whilst retaining user configuration.  (Alexey Fedorov, #1706)
 * Reduce string allocations when defining and running examples by 70%
   and 50% respectively. (Myron Marston, #1738)
 * Removed dependency on pathname from stdlib. (Sam Phippen, #1703)
 * Improve the message presented when a user hits Ctrl-C.
   (Alex Chaffee #1717, #1742)
 * Improve shared example group inclusion backtrace displayed
   in failed example output so that it works for all methods
   of including shared example groups and shows all inclusion
   locations. (Myron Marston, #1763)
 * Issue seed notification at start (as well as the end) of the reporter
   run. (Arlandis Word, #1761)
 * Improve the documentation of around hooks. (Jim Kingdon, #1772)
 * Support prepending of modules into example groups from config and allow
   filtering based on metadata. (Arlandis Word, #1806)
 * Emit warnings when `:suite` hooks are registered on an example group
   (where it has always been ignored) or are registered with metadata
   (which has always been ignored). (Myron Marston, #1805)
 * Provide a friendly error message when users call RSpec example group
   APIs (e.g. `context`, `describe`, `it`, `let`, `before`, etc) from
   within an example where those APIs are unavailable. (Myron Marston, #1819)
 * Provide a friendly error message when users call RSpec example
   APIs (e.g. `expect`, `double`, `stub_const`, etc) from
   within an example group where those APIs are unavailable.
   (Myron Marston, #1819)
 * Add new `RSpec::Core::Sandbox.sandboxed { }` API that facilitates
   testing RSpec with RSpec, allowing you to define example groups
   and example from within an example without affecting the global
   `RSpec.world` state. (Tyler Ball, 1808)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 18 14:57:13 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.14.8
 Bug fixes:
 
 * Fix regression with the `TextMateFormatter` that prevented backtrace links
   from being clickable. (Stefan Daschek)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  1 06:07:21 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.14.7
 Bug fixes:
 
 * Fix regression in 2.14.6 that broke the Fivemat formatter.
   It depended upon either
   `example.execution_result[:exception].pending_fixed?` (which
   was removed in 2.14.6 to fix an issue with frozen error objects)
   or `RSpec::Core::PendingExampleFixedError` (which was renamed
   to `RSpec::Core::Pending::PendingExampleFixedError` in 2.8.
   This fix makes a constant alias for the old error name.
   (Myron Marston)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 20 12:05:37 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.14.6
 Bug fixes:
 
 * Format stringified numbers correctly when mathn library is loaded.
   (Jay Hayes)
 * Fix an issue that prevented the use of frozen error objects. (Lars Gierth)
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 05:05:51 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.14.5
 Bug fixes:
 
 * Fix a `NoMethodError` that was being raised when there were no shared
   examples or contexts declared and `RSpec.world.reset` is invoked.
   (thepoho, Jon Rowe, Myron Marston)
 * Fix a deprecation warning that was being incorrectly displayed when
   `shared_examples` are declared at top level in a `module` scope.
   (Jon Rowe)
 * Fix after(:all) hooks so consecutive (same context) scopes will run even if
   one raises an error. (Jon Rowe, Trejkaz)
 * JsonFormatter no longer dies if `dump_profile` isn't defined (Alex / @MasterLambaster, Jon Rowe)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 30 18:46:53 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.14.4
  Bug fixes
  
  * Fix regression in 2.14: ensure configured requires (via `-r` option)
    are loaded before spec files are loaded. This allows the spec files
    to programatically change the file pattern (Jon Rowe).
  * Autoload `RSpec::Mocks` and `RSpec::Expectations` when referenced if
    they are not already loaded (`RSpec::Matches` has been autoloaded
    for a while). In the `rspec` gem, we changed it recently to stop
    loading `rspec/mocks` and `rspec/expectations` by default, as some
    users reported problems where they were intending to use mocha,
    not rspec-mocks, but rspec-mocks was loaded and causing a conflict.
    rspec-core loads mocks and expectations at the appropriate time, so
    it seemed like a safe change -- but caused a problem for some authors
    of libraries that integrate with RSpec. This fixes that problem.
    (Myron Marston)
  * Gracefully handle a command like `rspec --profile path/to/spec.rb`:
    the `path/to/spec.rb` arg was being wrongly treated as the `profile`
    integer arg, which got cast `0` using `to_i`, causing no profiled
    examples to be printed. (Jon Rowe)
  
  ### 2.14.3 / 2013-07-13
  [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v2.14.2...v2.14.3)
  
  Bug fixes
  
  * Fix deprecation notices issued from `RSpec::Core::RakeTask` so
    that they work properly when all of rspec-core is not loaded.
    (This was a regression in 2.14) (Jon Rowe)
  
  ### 2.14.2 / 2013-07-09
  [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v2.14.1...v2.14.2)
  
  Bug fixes
  
  * Fix regression caused by 2.14.1 release: formatters that
    report that they `respond_to?` a notification, but had
    no corresponding method would raise an error when registered.
    The new fix is to just implement `start` on the deprecation
    formatter to fix the original JRuby/ruby-debug issue.
    (Jon Rowe)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 06:15:19 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.13.1
 [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v2.13.0...v2.13.1)
 
 Bug fixes
 
 * Use hook classes as proxies rather than extending hook blocks to support
   lambdas for before/after/around hooks. (David Chelimsky)
 * Fix regression in 2.13.0 that caused confusing behavior when overriding
   a named subject with an unnamed subject in an inner group and then
   referencing the outer group subject's name. The fix for this required
   us to disallow using `super` in a named subject (which is confusing,
   anyway -- named subjects create 2 methods, so which method on the
   parent example group are you `super`ing to?) but `super` in an unnamed
   subject continues to work (Myron Marston).
 * Do not allow a referenced `let` or `subject` in `before(:all)` to cause
   other `let` declarations to leak across examples (Myron Marston).
 * Work around odd ruby 1.9 bug with `String#match` that was triggered
   by passing it a regex from a `let` declaration. For more info, see
   http://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8059 (Aaron Kromer).
 * Add missing `require 'set'` to `base_text_formatter.rb` (Tom
   Anderson).
 
 Deprecations
 
 * Deprecate accessing `let` or `subject` declarations in `before(:all)`.
   These were not intended to be called in a `before(:all)` hook, as
   they exist to define state that is reset between each example, while
   `before(:all)` exists to define state that is shared across examples
   in an example group (Myron Marston).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 19:45:46 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.13.0
 Enhancements
 
 * Allow `--profile` option to take a count argument that
   determines the number of slow examples to dump
   (Greggory Rothmeier).
 * Add `subject!` that is the analog to `let!`. It defines an
   explicit subject and sets a `before` hook that will invoke
   the subject (Zubin Henner).
 * Fix `let` and `subject` declaration so that `super`
   and `return` can be used in them, just like in a normal
   method. (Myron Marston)
 * Allow output colors to be configured individually.
   (Charlie Maffitt)
 
 Bug fixes
 
 * Don't blow up when dumping error output for instances
   of anonymous error classes (Myron Marston).
 * Fix default backtrace filters so lines from projects
   containing "gems" in the name are not filtered, but
   lines from installed gems still are (Myron Marston).
 * Fix autotest command so that is uses double quotes
   rather than single quotes for windows compatibility
   (Jonas Tingeborn).
 * Fix `its` so that uses of `subject` in a `before` or `let`
   declaration in the parent group continue to reference the
   parent group's subject. (Olek Janiszewski)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 18 14:52:21 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.12.2
 [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v2.12.1...v2.12.2)
 
 Bug fixes
 
 * Fix `RSpec::Core::RakeTask` so that it is compatible with rake 0.8.7
   on ruby 1.8.7. We had accidentally broke it in the 2.12 release
   (Myron Marston).
 * Fix `RSpec::Core::RakeTask` so it is tolerant of the `Rspec` constant
   for backwards compatibility (Patrick Van Stee)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  2 15:29:48 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.12.1
 [full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v2.12.0...v2.12.1)
 
 Bug fixes
 
 * Specs are run even if another at\_exit hook calls `exit`. This allows
   Test::Unit and RSpec to run together. (Suraj N. Kurapati)
 * Fix full doc string concatenation so that it handles the case of a
   method string (e.g. "#foo") being nested under a context string
   (e.g. "when it is tuesday"), so that we get "when it is tuesday #foo"
   rather than "when it is tuesday#foo". (Myron Marston)
 * Restore public API I unintentionally broke in 2.12.0:
   `RSpec::Core::Formatters::BaseFormatter#format_backtrce(backtrace, example)`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 13 14:04:17 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 2.12.0
 Enhancements
 
 * Add support for custom ordering strategies for groups and examples.
   (Myron Marston)
 * JSON Formatter (Alex Chaffee)
 * Refactor rake task internals (Sam Phippen)
 * Refactor HtmlFormatter (Pete Hodgson)
 * Autotest supports a path to Ruby that contains spaces (dsisnero)
 * Provide a helpful warning when a shared example group is redefined.
   (Mark Burns).
 * `--default_path` can be specified as `--default-line`. `--line_number` can be
   specified as `--line-number`. Hyphens are more idiomatic command line argument
   separators (Sam Phippen).
 * A more useful error message is shown when an invalid command line option is
   used (Jordi Polo).
 * Add `format_docstrings { |str| }` config option. It can be used to
   apply formatting rules to example group and example docstrings.
   (Alex Tan)
 * Add support for an `.rspec-local` options file. This is intended to
   allow individual developers to set options in a git-ignored file that
   override the common project options in `.rspec`. (Sam Phippen)
 * Support for mocha 0.13.0. (Andy Lindeman)
 
 Bug fixes
 
 * Remove override of `ExampleGroup#ancestors`. This is a core ruby method that
   RSpec shouldn't override. Instead, define `ExampleGroup#parent_groups`. (Myron
   Marston)
 * Limit monkey patching of shared example/context declaration methods
   (`shared_examples_for`, etc.) to just the objects that need it rather than
   every object in the system (Myron Marston).
 * Fix Metadata#fetch to support computed values (Sam Goldman).
 * Named subject can now be referred to from within subject block in a nested
   group (tomykaira).
 * Fix `fail_fast` so that it properly exits when an error occurs in a
   `before(:all) hook` (Bradley Schaefer).
 * Make the order spec files are loaded consistent, regardless of the
   order of the files returned by the OS or the order passed at
   the command line (Jo Liss and Sam Phippen).
 * Ensure instance variables from `before(:all)` are always exposed
   from `after(:all)`, even if an error occurs in `before(:all)`
   (Sam Phippen).
 * `rspec --init` no longer generates an incorrect warning about `--configure`
   being deprecated (Sam Phippen).
 * Fix pluralization of `1 seconds` (Odin Dutton)
 * Fix ANSICON url (Jarmo Pertman)
 * Use dup of Time so reporting isn't clobbered by examples that modify Time
   without properly restoring it. (David Chelimsky)
 
 Deprecations
 
 * `share_as` is no longer needed. `shared_context` and/or
   `RSpec::SharedContext` provide better mechanisms (Sam Phippen).
 * Deprecate `RSpec.configuration` with a block (use `RSpec.configure`).
