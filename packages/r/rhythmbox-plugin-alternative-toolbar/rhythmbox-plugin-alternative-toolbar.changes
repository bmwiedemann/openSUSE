- Adjust __requires_exclude macro definition to use the following
  pattern: typelib\\((Foo|Bar|...)\\). It's both more precise and
  makes the need to manually adding GdkPixbuf and PeasGtk typelib()
  Requires obsolete - so they are dropped - because the old pattern
  - typelib\((Foo|Bar|...\\) - would also match them.
