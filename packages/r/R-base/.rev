    <comment>- There were a few new files in foreign and rpart.
  Fixed now. Builds fine. 
  The upstream release happened today 11:01 CET. Would just
  be great if it could be included in 12.3! 
- Upstream release 2.15.3
- see, as usual, /usr/lib/R/doc/NEWS.html 
- This is mostly a bugfix release and the final release for the
  R-2.x.y series.
- Most important additions:
  NEW FEATURES:
    o lgamma(x) for very small x (in the denormalized range) is no
      longer Inf with a warning.
    o image() now sorts an unsorted breaks vector, with a warning.
    o The internal methods for tar() and untar() do a slightly more
      general job for 'ustar'-style handling of paths of more than 100
      bytes.
    o Packages compiler and parallel have been added to the reference
      index (refman.pdf).
    o untar(tar = &quot;internal&quot;) has some support for pax headers as
      produced by e.g. gnutar --posix (which seems prevalent on
      OpenSUSE 12.2) or bsdtar --format pax, including long path and
      link names.
    o sQuote() and dQuote() now handle 0-length inputs.  (Suggestion of
      Ben Bolker.)
    o summaryRprof() returns zero-row data frames rather than throw an
      error if no events are recorded, for consistency.
    o The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.32.
    o The tcltk namespace can now be re-loaded after unloading.
      The Tcl/Tk event loop is inhibited in a forked child from package
      parallel (as in e.g. mclapply()).
    o parallel::makeCluster() recognizes the value random for the</comment>

- Upstream release 3.0.1
- Most important 
  CHANGES IN R 3.0.1:
  NEW FEATURES:
    o chooseCRANmirror() and chooseBioCmirror() gain an ind argument
      (like setRepositories()).
    o mcparallel has a new argument mc.interactive which can modify the
      interactive flag in the child process. The new default is FALSE
      which makes child processes non-interactive by default (this
      prevents lock-ups due to children waiting for interactive input).
    o scan() now warns when end-of-file occurs within a quoted string.
    o count.fields() is now consistent with scan() in its handling of
      newlines in quoted strings.  Instead of triggering an error, this
      results in the current line receiving NA as the field count, with
      the next line getting the total count of the two lines.
    o The default method of image() will plot axes of the class of xlim
      and ylim (and hence of x and y if there is a suitable range()
      method).  Based on a suggestion of Michael Sumner.
    o load() now has a verbose argument for debugging support, to print
      the names of objects just before loading them.
    o When loading a serialized object encounters a reference to a
      namespace which cannot be loaded, this is replaced by a reference
      to the global environment, with a warning.
    o pairs() gains a line.main option for title placement.
    o The remaining instances in which serialization to a raw vector
      was limited to 2GB have been unlimited on a 64-bit platform, and
      in most cases serialization to a vector of more than 1GB will be
      substantially faster.</comment>

- Upstream release 3.0.2
- Most important
  CHANGES IN R 3.0.2:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * The NEWS files have been re-organized.
      This file contains news for R &gt;= 3.0.0: news for the 0.x.y, 1.x.y
      and 2.x.y releases is in files NEWS.0, NEWS.1 and NEWS.2.  The
      latter files are now installed when R is installed.  An HTML
      version of news from 2.10.0 to 2.15.3 is available as
      doc/html/NEWS.2.html.
    * sum() for integer arguments now uses an integer accumulator of at
      least 64 bits and so will be more accurate in the very rare case
      that a cumulative sum exceeds 2^53 (necessarily summing more than
      4 million elements).
    * The example() and tools::Rd2ex() functions now have parameters to
      allow them to ignore \dontrun markup in examples.  (Suggested by
      Peter Solymos.)
    * str(x) is considerably faster for very large lists, or factors
      with 100,000 levels, the latter as in PR#15337.
    * col2rgb() now converts factors to character strings not integer
      codes (suggested by Bryan Hanson).
    * tail(warnings()) now works, via the new `[` method.
    * There is now support for the LaTeX style file zi4.sty which has
      in some distributions replaced inconsolata.sty.
    * unlist(x) now typically returns all non-list xs unchanged, not
      just the &quot;vector&quot; ones.  Consequently, format(lst) now also works
      when the list lst has non-vector elements.
    * The tools::getVignetteInfo() function has been added to give</comment>

    <comment>- Upstream release 3.0.3
- Most important
  CHANGES IN R 3.0.3:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * On Windows there is support for making .texi manuals using
      texinfo 5.0 or later: the setting is in file
      src/gnuwin32/MkRules.dist.
      A packaging of the Perl script and modules for texinfo 5.2 has
      been made available at &lt;URL:
      http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/&gt;.
    * write.table() now handles matrices of 2^31 or more elements, for
      those with large amounts of patience and disc space.
    * There is a new function, La_version(), to report the version of
      LAPACK in use.
    * The HTML version of 'An Introduction to R' now has links to PNG
      versions of the figures.
    * There is some support to produce manuals in ebook formats. (See
      doc/manual/Makefile.  Suggested by Mauro Cavalcanti.)
    * On a Unix-alike Sys.timezone() returns NA if the environment
      variable TZ is unset, to distinguish it from an empty string
      which on some OSes means the UTC time zone.
    * The backtick may now be escaped in strings, to allow names
      containing them to be constructed, e.g. `\``.  (PR#15621)
    * read.table(), readLines() and scan() now warn when an embedded
      nul is found in the input.  (Related to PR#15625 which was
      puzzled by the behaviour in this unsupported case.)
    * (Windows only.)  file.symlink() works around the undocumented
      restriction of the Windows system call to backslashes.  (Wish of
      PR#15631.)
    * KalmanForecast(fast = FALSE) is now the default, and the help</comment>

    <comment>- Upstream release 3.1.0
- Most impotant
  CHANGES IN R 3.1.0:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * type.convert() (and hence by default read.table()) returns a
      character vector or factor when representing a numeric input as a
      double would lose accuracy.  Similarly for complex inputs.
      If a file contains numeric data with unrepresentable numbers of
      decimal places that are intended to be read as numeric, specify
      colClasses in read.table() to be &quot;numeric&quot;.
    * tools::Rdiff(useDiff = FALSE) is closer to the POSIX definition
      of diff -b (as distinct from the description in the man pages of
      most systems).
    * New function anyNA(), a version of any(is.na(.)) which is fast
      for atomic vectors, based on a proposal by Tim Hesterberg. (Wish
      of PR#15239.)
    * arrayInd(*, useNames = TRUE) and, analogously, which(*, arr.ind =
      TRUE) now make use of names(.dimnames) when available.
    * is.unsorted() now also works for raw vectors.
    * The &quot;table&quot; method for as.data.frame() (also useful as
      as.data.frame.table()) now passes sep and base arguments to
      provideDimnames().
    * uniroot() gets new optional arguments, notably extendInt,
      allowing to auto-extend the search interval when needed.  The
      return value has an extra component, init.it.
    * switch(f, ...) now warns when f is a factor, as this typically
      happens accidentally where the useR meant to pass a character
      string, but f is treated as integer (as always documented).
    * The parser has been modified to use less memory.
    * The way the unary operators (+ - !) handle attributes is now more</comment>

    <comment>- first submit from new devel project
- Removed / commented out symlink to %{_bindir}/r
  new package 'littler' should be used instead for packages
  that need /usr/bin/r 

-  Add make dependency for Rcmd

- Created symlink to %{_bindir}/r
  Many CRAN packages ship with scripts which call %{_bindir}/r,
  which creates a dependency on it, this fixes that.</comment>

  CHANGES IN R 3.1.2:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * embedFonts() now defaults to format = &quot;ps2write&quot; for .ps and .eps
      files.  This is available in Ghostscript 9.x (since 2010) whereas
      the previous default, format = &quot;pswrite&quot;, was removed in
      Ghostscript 9.10.
    * For consistency with [dpqr]norm(), [dp]lnorm(sdlog = 0) model a
      point mass at exp(mulog) rather than return NaN (for an error).
    * capabilities() now reports if ICU is compiled in for use for
      collation (it is only actually used if a suitable locale is set
      for collation, and never for a C locale).
    * (OS X only.) Package tcltk checks when loaded if it is linked
      against the CRAN X11-based Tcl/Tk and if so that the Tcl/Tk
      component and the X11 libraries are installed.  This allows more
      informative error messages to be given advising the installation
      of the missing component or of XQuartz.
      The X11() device and X11-based versions of the data editor and
      viewer (invoked by edit() and View() for data frames and matrices
      from command-line R) check that the X11 libraries are installed
      and if not advises installing XQuartz.
    * icuSetCollate() allows locale = &quot;default&quot;, and locale = &quot;none&quot; to
      use OS services rather than ICU for collation.
      Environment variable R_ICU_LOCALE can be used to set the default
      ICU locale, in case the one derived from the OS locale is
      inappropriate (this is currently necessary on Windows).
    * New function icuGetCollate() to report on the ICU collation
      locale in use (if any).
    * utils::URLencode() was updated to use unreserved and reserved</comment>

  CHANGES IN R 3.1.3:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * The internal method of download.file() can now handle files
      larger than 2GB on 32-bit builds which support such files (tested
      on 32-bit R running on 64-bit Windows).
    * kruskal.test() warns on more types of suspicious input.
    * The as.dendrogram() method for &quot;hclust&quot; objects gains a check
      argument protecting against memory explosion for invalid inputs.
    * capabilities() has a new item long.double which indicates if the
      build uses a long double type which is longer than double.
    * nlm() no longer modifies the callback argument in place (a new
      vector is allocated for each invocation, which mimics the
      implicit duplication that occurred in R &lt; 3.1.0); note that this
      is a change from the previously documented behavior. (PR#15958)
    * icuSetCollate() now accepts locale = &quot;ASCII&quot; which uses the basic
      C function strcmp and so collates strings byte-by-byte in
      numerical order.
    * sessionInfo() tries to report the OS version in use (not just
      that compiled under, and including details of Linux
      distributions).
    * model.frame() (used by lm() and many other modelling functions)
      now warns when it drops contrasts from factors.  (Wish of
      PR#16119)
    * install.packages() and friends now accept the value type =
      &quot;binary&quot; as a synonym for the native binary type on the platform
      (if it has one).
    * Single source or binary files can be supplied for
      install.packages(type = &quot;both&quot;) and the appropriate type and</comment>

    <comment>- Upstream release 3.2.0
  For all releases &lt;= 13.2 Publishing:texinfo had to be linked, because
  texinfo &gt;= 5.1 is needed starting from 3.2.0.
  Factory works without any additional dependencies.
- Most important
  CHANGES IN 3.2.0:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * anyNA() gains a recursive argument.
    * When x is missing and names is not false (including the default
      value), Sys.getenv(x, names) returns an object of class &quot;Dlist&quot;
      and hence prints tidily.
    * (Windows.)  shell() no longer consults the environment variable
      SHELL: too many systems have been encountered where it was set
      incorrectly (usually to a path where software was compiled, not
      where it was installed).  R_SHELL, the preferred way to select a
      non-default shell, can be used instead.
    * Some unusual arguments to embedFonts() can now be specified as
      character vectors, and the defaults have been changed
      accordingly.
    * Functions in the Summary group duplicate less.  (PR#15798)
    * (Unix-alikes.) system(cmd, input = ) now uses
      'shell-execution-environment' redirection, which will be more
      natural if cmd is not a single command (but requires a
      POSIX-compliant shell). (Wish of PR#15508)
    * read.fwf() and read.DIF() gain a fileEncoding argument, for
      convenience.
    * Graphics devices can add attributes to their description in
      .Device and .Devices.  Several of those included with R use a
      &quot;filepath&quot; attribute.
    * pmatch() uses hashing in more cases and so is faster at the
      expense of using more memory. (PR#15697)
    * pairs() gains new arguments to select sets of variables to be
      plotted against each other.</comment>

  CHANGES IN R 3.2.1:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * utf8ToInt() now checks that its input is valid UTF-8 and returns
      NA if it is not.
    * install.packages() now allows type = &quot;both&quot; with repos = NULL if
      it can infer the type of file.
    * nchar(x, *) and nzchar(x) gain a new argument keepNA which
      governs how the result for NAs in x is determined.  For the R
      3.2.x series, the default remains FALSE which is fully back
      compatible.  From R 3.3.0, the default will change to keepNA = NA
      and you are advised to consider this for code portability.
    * news() more flexibly extracts dates from package NEWS.Rd files.
    * lengths(x) now also works (trivially) for atomic x and hence can
      be used more generally as an efficient replacement of sapply(x,
      length) and similar.
    * The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.37, a bug-fix
      release.
    * diag() no longer duplicates a matrix when extracting its
      diagonal.
    * as.character.srcref() gains an argument to allow characters
      corresponding to a range of source references to be extracted.
  BUG FIXES:
    * acf() and ccf() now guarantee values strictly in [-1,1] (instead
      of sometimes very slightly outside). PR#15832.
    * as.integer(&quot;111111111111&quot;) now gives NA (with a warning) as it
      does for the corresponding numeric or negative number coercions.</comment>

- Most important
CHANGES IN R 3.2.2:
  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
    * It is now easier to use secure downloads from https:// URLs on
      builds which support them: no longer do non-default options need
      to be selected to do so.  In particular, packages can be
      installed from repositories which offer https:// URLs, and those
      listed by setRepositories() now do so (for some of their
      mirrors).
      Support for https:// URLs is available on Windows, and on other
      platforms if support for libcurl was compiled in and if that
      supports the https protocol (system installations can be expected
      to do).  So https:// support can be expected except on rather old
      OSes (an example being OS X 'Snow Leopard', where a non-system
      version of libcurl can be used).
      (Windows only) The default method for accessing URLs _via_
      download.file() and url() has been changed to be &quot;wininet&quot; using
      Windows API calls.  This changes the way proxies need to be set
      and security settings made: there have been some reports of sites
      being inaccessible under the new default method (but the previous
      methods remain available).
  NEW FEATURES:
    * cmdscale() gets new option list. for increased flexibility when a
      list should be returned.
    * configure now supports texinfo version 6.0, which (unlike the
      change from 4.x to 5.0) is a minor update.  (Wish of PR#16456.)
    * (Non-Windows only) download.file() with default method = &quot;auto&quot;
      now chooses &quot;libcurl&quot; if that is available and a https:// or
      ftps:// URL is used.</comment>

  CHANGES IN R 3.2.3:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * Some recently-added Windows time zone names have been added to
      the conversion table used to convert these to Olson names.
      (Including those relating to changes for Russia in Oct 2014, as
      in PR#16503.)
    * (Windows) Compatibility information has been added to the
      manifests for Rgui.exe, Rterm.exe and Rscript.exe.  This should
      allow win.version() and Sys.info() to report the actual Windows
      version up to Windows 10.
    * Windows &quot;wininet&quot; FTP first tries EPSV / PASV mode rather than
      only using active mode (reported by Dan Tenenbaum).
    * which.min(x) and which.max(x) may be much faster for logical and
      integer x and now also work for long vectors.
    * The 'emulation' part of tools::texi2dvi() has been somewhat
      enhanced, including supporting quiet = TRUE.  It can be selected
      by texi2dvi = &quot;emulation&quot;.
      (Windows) MiKTeX removed its texi2dvi.exe command in Sept 2015:
      tools::texi2dvi() tries texify.exe if it is not found.
    * (Windows only) Shortcuts for printing and saving have been added
      to menus in Rgui.exe.  (Request of PR#16572.)
    * loess(..., iterTrace=TRUE) now provides diagnostics for
      robustness iterations, and the print() method for
      summary(&lt;loess&gt;) shows slightly more.
    * The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.38, a bug-fix
      release.
    * View() now displays nested data frames in a more friendly way.
      (Request with patch in PR#15915.)

    <comment>- upstrem releases minorst bug fix release
  NEWS: The 3.2.4 release had two annoyances which we would rather 
  not have in an &quot;ultra-stable&quot; release, designed to hang around 
  for the duration of the 3.3 series. One was a relatively minor 
  Makefile issue affecting system using R's bundled lzma library. 
  The other, rather more serious, affected printing and formatting 
  of POSIXlt objects, which would unpredictably get the Daylight 
  Savings Time wrong. 

- Some version numbers of recommended packages corrected 

- Release numbers for sub-packages improved

- added MakefileTypo.patch to enable building for 12.2
  was a one charcter show stopper 

- upstream release 3.2.4, only minor improvements
CHANGES IN R 3.2.4:
  NEW FEATURES:
    • install.packages() and related functions now give a more
      informative warning when an attempt is made to install a base
      package.
    • summary(x) now prints with less rounding when x contains infinite
      values. (Request of PR#16620.)
    • provideDimnames() gets an optional unique argument.
    • shQuote() gains type = &quot;cmd2&quot; for quoting in cmd.exe in Windows.
      (Response to PR#16636.)
    • The data.frame method of rbind() gains an optional argument
      stringsAsFactors (instead of only depending on
      getOption(&quot;stringsAsFactors&quot;)).</comment>

      usetz = TRUE) ended in two &quot;CEST&quot; time formats.
    • A typo in the Makefile for src/extra/xz prevented builds of

  Removed removal of backup file that was meanwhile removed upstream.

  Thx to Jan Engelhardt, again!

- clean up of spec file after comments from  Jan Engelhardt in 
  https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/393426
  Some unneeded explicit BuildRequires removed. 

- tre.patch was removed.  

- and libbz2-devel needed, too.
  

- added BuildRequires: bzip2
  for i586.

- upstream release 3.3.0

    * nchar(x, *)'s argument keepNA governing how the result for NAs in
      x is determined, gets a new default keepNA = NA which returns NA
      where x is NA, except for type = &quot;width&quot; which still returns 2,
      the formatting / printing width of NA.
    * All builds have support for https: URLs in the default methods
      for download.file(), url() and code making use of them.
      Unfortunately that cannot guarantee that any particular https:
      URL can be accessed.  For example, server and client have to

- Most important changes
  CHANGES IN R 3.3.1:
  BUG FIXES:
    * R CMD INSTALL and hence install.packages() gave an internal error
      installing a package called description from a tarball on a
      case-insensitive file system.
    * match(x, t) (and hence x %in% t) failed when x was of length one,
      and either character and x and t only differed in their Encoding
      or when x and t where complex with NAs or NaNs.  (PR#16885.)
    * unloadNamespace(ns) also works again when ns is a 'namespace', as
      from getNamespace().
    * rgamma(1,Inf) or rgamma(1, 0,0) no longer give NaN but the
      correct limit.
    * length(baseenv()) is correct now.
    * pretty(d, ..) for date-time d rarely failed when &quot;halfmonth&quot; time
      steps were tried (PR#16923) and on 'inaccurate' platforms such as
      32-bit windows or a configuration with --disable-long-double; see
      comment #15 of PR#16761.
    * In text.default(x, y, labels), the rarely(?) used default for
      labels is now correct also for the case of a 2-column matrix x
      and missing y.
    * as.factor(c(a = 1L)) preserves names() again as in R &lt; 3.1.0.
    * strtrim(&quot;&quot;[0], 0[0]) now works.
    * Use of Ctrl-C to terminate a reverse incremental search started
      by Ctrl-R in the readline-based Unix terminal interface is now
      supported for readline &gt;= 6.3 (Ctrl-G always worked).  (PR#16603)
    * diff(&lt;difftime&gt;) now keeps the &quot;units&quot; attribute, as subtraction
      already did, PR#16940.</comment>

  CHANGES IN R 3.3.2:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * extSoftVersion() now reports the version (if any) of the readline
      library in use.
    * The version of LAPACK included in the sources has been updated to
      3.6.1, a bug-fix release including a speedup for the
      non-symmetric case of eigen().
    * Use options(deparse.max.lines=) to limit the number of lines
      recorded in .Traceback and other deparsing activities.
    * format(&lt;AsIs&gt;) looks more regular, also for non-character atomic
      matrices.
    * abbreviate() gains an option named = TRUE.
    * The online documentation for package methods is extensively
      rewritten.  The goals are to simplify documentation for basic
      use, to note old features not recommended and to correct
      out-of-date information.
    * Calls to setMethod() no longer print a message when creating a
      generic function in those cases where that is natural: S3
      generics and primitives.
  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:
    * Versions of the readline library &gt;= 6.3 had been changed so that
      terminal window resizes were not signalled to readline: code has
      been added using a explicit signal handler to work around that
      (when R is compiled against readline &gt;= 6.3).  (PR#16604)
    * configure works better with Oracle Developer Studio 12.5.
  UTILITIES:
    * R CMD check reports more dubious flags in files
      src/Makevars[.in], including -w and -g.</comment>

    <comment>- a change in OBS now requires a BuildRequire: shadow for
  some openSUSE releases.

- upstream release 3.3.3
- Most important changes
  CHANGES IN R 3.3.3:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * Changes when redirection of a http:// URL to a https:// URL is
      encountered:
        * The internal methods of download.file() and url() now report
          that they cannot follow this (rather than failing silently).
        * (Unix-alike) download.file(method = &quot;auto&quot;) (the default)
          re-tries with method = &quot;libcurl&quot;.
        * (Unix-alike) url(method = &quot;default&quot;) with an explicit open
          argument re-tries with method = &quot;libcurl&quot;.  This covers many
          of the usages, e.g. readLines() with a URL argument.
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * The configure check for the zlib version is now robust to
      versions longer than 5 characters, including 1.2.11.
  UTILITIES:
    * Environmental variable _R_CHECK_TESTS_NLINES_ controls how R CMD
      check reports failing tests (see SS8 of the 'R Internals' manual).
  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:
    * (C-level Native routine registration.)  The undocumented styles
      field of the components of R_CMethodDef and R_FortranMethodDef is
      deprecated.
  BUG FIXES:
    * vapply(x, *) now works with long vectors x.  (PR#17174)
    * isS3method(&quot;is.na.data.frame&quot;) and similar are correct now.

    <comment>- And again that ldconfig call. Newline was obviously wrong.
  Hopefully correct now. 

- Jan Engelhardt &lt;jengelh@inai.de&gt; asked for reverting the change
  to the ldconfig call. So be it.

- improvements for
  a) calling /sbin/ldconfig, which no longer gives a warning
  b) unregistering info-pages in %preun instead of %postun</comment>

    <comment>- upstream update to 3.4.0
  CHANGES IN R 3.4.0:
  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
   * (Unix-alike) The default methods for download.file() and url()
     now choose &quot;libcurl&quot; except for file:// URLs.  There will be
     small changes in the format and wording of messages, including in
     rare cases if an issue is a warning or an error.  For example,
     when HTTP re-direction occurs, some messages refer to the final
     URL rather than the specified one.
     Those who use proxies should check that their settings are
     compatible (see ?download.file: the most commonly used forms work
     for both &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;libcurl&quot;).
   * table() has been amended to be more internally consistent and
     become back compatible to R &lt;= 2.7.2 again.  Consequently,
     table(1:2, exclude = NULL) no longer contains a zero count for
     &lt;NA&gt;, but useNA = &quot;always&quot; continues to do so.
   * summary.default() no longer rounds, but its print method does
     resulting in less extraneous rounding, notably of numbers in the
     ten thousands.
   * factor(x, exclude = L) behaves more rationally when x or L are
     character vectors.  Further, exclude = &lt;factor&gt; now behaves as
     documented for long.
   * Arithmetic, logic (&amp;, |) and comparison (aka 'relational', e.g.,
     &lt;, ==) operations with arrays now behave consistently, notably
     for arrays of length zero.
     Arithmetic between length-1 arrays and longer non-arrays had
     silently dropped the array attributes and recycled.  This now
     gives a warning and will signal an error in the future, as it has
     always for logic and comparison operations in these cases (e.g.,
     compare matrix(1,1) + 2:3 and matrix(1,1) &lt; 2:3).</comment>

    <comment>- upstream update to 3.4.1
CHANGES IN R 3.4.1:
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * The deprecated support for PCRE versions older than 8.20 has been
      removed.
  BUG FIXES:
    * getParseData() gave incorrect column information when code
      contained multi-byte characters.  (PR#17254)
    * Asking for help using expressions like ?stats::cor() did not
      work.  (PR#17250)
    * readRDS(url(....)) now works.
    * R CMD Sweave again returns status = 0 on successful completion.
    * Vignettes listed in .Rbuildignore were not being ignored
      properly.  (PR#17246)
    * file.mtime() no longer returns NA on Windows when the file or
      directory is being used by another process.  This affected
      installed.packages(), which is now protected against this.
    * R CMD INSTALL Windows .zip file obeys --lock and --pkglock flags.
    * (Windows only) The choose.files() function could return incorrect
      results when called with multi = FALSE.  (PR#17270)
    * aggregate(&lt;data.frame&gt;, drop = FALSE) now also works in case of
      near-equal numbers in by.  (PR#16918)
    * fourfoldplot() could encounter integer overflow when calculating
      the odds ratio. (PR#17286)
    * parse() no longer gives spurious warnings when extracting srcrefs
      from a file not encoded in the current locale.
      This was seen from R CMD check with inst/doc/*.R files, and check
      has some additional protection for such files.
    * print.noquote(x) now always returns its argument x (invisibly).
    * Non-UTF-8 multibyte character sets were not handled properly in</comment>

    <comment>- upstream update to 3.4.2
CHANGES IN R 3.4.2:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * Setting the LC_ALL category in Sys.setlocale() invalidates any
      cached locale-specific day/month names and the AM/PM indicator
      for strptime() (as setting LC_TIME has since R 3.1.0).
    * The version of LAPACK included in the sources has been updated to
      3.7.1, a bug-fix release.
    * The default for tools::write_PACKAGES(rds_compress=) has been
      changed to &quot;xz&quot; to match the compression used by CRAN.
    * c() and unlist() are now more efficient in constructing the
      names(.) of their return value, thanks to a proposal by Suharto
      Anggono.  (PR#17284)
  UTILITIES:
    * R CMD check checks for and R CMD build corrects CRLF line endings
      in shell scripts configure and cleanup (even on Windows).
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * The order of selection of OpenMP flags has been changed: Oracle
      Developer Studio 12.5 accepts -fopenmp and -xopenmp but only the
      latter enables OpenMP so it is now tried first.
  BUG FIXES:
    * within(List, rm(x1, x2)) works correctly again, including when
      List[[&quot;x2&quot;]] is NULL.
    * regexec(pattern, text, *) now applies as.character(.) to its
      first two arguments, as documented.
    * write.table() and related functions, writeLines(), and perhaps
      other functions writing text to connections did not signal errors
      when the writes failed, e.g. due to a disk being full.  Errors
      will now be signalled if detected during the write, warnings if
      detected when the connection is closed.  (PR#17243)</comment>

    <comment>- upstream updated to 3.4.3
  CHANGES IN R 3.4.3:
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * A workaround has been added for the changes in location of
      time-zone files in macOS 10.13 'High Sierra' and again in
      10.13.1, so the default time zone is deduced correctly from the
      system setting when R is configured with --with-internal-tzcode
      (the default on macOS).
    * R CMD javareconf has been updated to recognize the use of a Java
      9 SDK on macOS.
  BUG FIXES:
    * raw(0) &amp; raw(0) and raw(0) | raw(0) again return raw(0) (rather
      than logical(0)).
    * intToUtf8() converts integers corresponding to surrogate code
      points to NA rather than invalid UTF-8, as well as values larger
      than the current Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF.  (This aligns with
      the current RFC3629.)
    * Fix calling of methods on S4 generics that dispatch on ... when
      the call contains ....
    * Following Unicode 'Corrigendum 9', the UTF-8 representations of
      U+FFFE and U+FFFF are now regarded as valid by utf8ToInt().
    * range(c(TRUE, NA), finite = TRUE) and similar no longer return
      NA. (Reported by Lukas Stadler.)
    * The self starting function attr(SSlogis, &quot;initial&quot;) now also
      works when the y values have exact minimum zero and is slightly
      changed in general, behaving symmetrically in the y range.
    * The printing of named raw vectors is now formatted nicely as for
      other such atomic vectors, thanks to Lukas Stadler.</comment>

    <comment>- upstrem updated to 3.4.4
  CHANGES IN R 3.4.4:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * Sys.timezone() tries more heuristics on Unix-alikes and so is
      more likely to succeed (especially on Linux).  For the slowest
      method, a warning is given recommending that TZ is set to avoid
      the search.
    * The version of LAPACK included in the sources has been updated to
      3.8.0 (for the routines used by R, a very minor bug-fix change).
    * parallel::detectCores(logical = FALSE) is ignored on Linux
      systems, since the information is not available with virtualized
      OSes.
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * configure will use pkg-config to find the flags to link to jpeg
      if available (as it should be for the recently-released jpeg-9c
      and libjpeg-turbo).  (This amends the code added in R 3.3.0 as
      the module name in jpeg-9c is not what that tested for.)
  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:
    * Sys.timezone(location = FALSE) (which was a stop-gap measure for
      Windows long ago) is deprecated.  It no longer returns the value
      of environment variable TZ (usually a location).
    * Legacy support of make macros such as CXX1X is formally
      deprecated: use the CXX11 forms instead.
  BUG FIXES:
    * power.prop.test() now warns when it cannot solve the problem,
      typically because of impossible constraints. (PR#17345)
    * removeSource() no longer erroneously removes NULL in certain
      cases, thanks to D'enes T'oth.
    * nls(`NO [mol/l]` ~ f(t)) and nls(y ~ a) now work.  (Partly from
      PR#17367)</comment>

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 3.5.0:
  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
    * All packages are by default byte-compiled on installation.  This
      makes the installed packages larger (usually marginally so) and
      may affect the format of messages and tracebacks (which often
      exclude .Call and similar).
  NEW FEATURES:
    * factor() now uses order() to sort its levels, rather than
      sort.list().  This allows factor() to support custom vector-like
      objects if methods for the appropriate generics are defined.  It
      has the side effect of making factor() succeed on empty or
      length-one non-atomic vector(-like) types (e.g., &quot;list&quot;), where
      it failed before.
    * diag() gets an optional names argument: this may require updates
      to packages defining S4 methods for it.
    * chooseCRANmirror() and chooseBioCmirror() no longer have a
      useHTTPS argument, not needed now all R builds support https://
      downloads.
    * New summary() method for warnings() with a (somewhat
      experimental) print() method.
    * (methods package.) .self is now automatically registered as a
      global variable when registering a reference class method.
    * tempdir(check = TRUE) recreates the tempdir() directory if it is
      no longer valid (e.g. because some other process has cleaned up
      the /tmp directory).
    * New askYesNo() function and &quot;askYesNo&quot; option to ask the user
      binary response questions in a customizable but consistent way.
      (Suggestion of PR#17242.)
    * New low level utilities ...elt(n) and ...length() for working
      with ... parts inside a function.</comment>

    <comment>-  CHANGES IN R 3.5.1 :
  BUG FIXES:
    * file(&quot;stdin&quot;) is no longer considered seekable.
    * dput() and dump() are no longer truncating when
      options(deparse.max.lines = *) is set.
    * Calls with an S3 class are no longer evaluated when printed,
      fixing part of PR#17398, thanks to a patch from Lionel Henry.
    * Allow file argument of Rscript to include space even when it is
      first on the command line.
    * callNextMethod() uses the generic from the environment of the
      calling method. Reported by Herv'e Pag`es with well documented
      examples.
    * Compressed file connections are marked as blocking.
    * optim(*, lower = c(-Inf, -Inf)) no longer warns (and switches the
      method), thanks to a suggestion by John Nash.
    * predict(fm, newdata) is now correct also for models where the
      formula has terms such as splines::ns(..) or stats::poly(..),
      fixing PR#17414, based on a patch from Duncan Murdoch.
    * simulate.lm(glm(*, gaussian(link = &lt;non-default&gt;))) has been
      corrected, fixing PR#17415 thanks to Alex Courtiol.
    * unlist(x) no longer fails in some cases of nested empty lists.
      Reported by Steven Nydick.
    * qr.coef(qr(&lt;all 0, w/ colnames&gt;)) now works.  Reported by Kun
      Ren.
    * The radix sort is robust to vectors with &gt;1 billion elements (but
      long vectors are still unsupported). Thanks to Matt Dowle for the
      fix.
    * Terminal connections (e.g., stdin) are no longer buffered. Fixes
      PR#17432.
    * deparse(x), dput(x) and dump() now respect c()'s argument names</comment>

    <comment>-  CHANGES IN R 3.5.2:
  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:
    * New macro CXX_VISIBILITY analogous to C_VISIBILITY (which several
      packages have been misusing for C++ code) for the default C++
      compiler (but not necessarily one used for non-default C++
      dialects like C++14).
  TESTING:
    * The random number generator tests in tests/p-r-random-tests.R no
      longer fail occasionally as they now randomly sample from
      &quot;certified&quot; random seeds.
  BUG FIXES:
    * The &quot;glm&quot; method of drop1() miscalculated the score test
      (test=&quot;Rao&quot;) when the model contained an offset.
    * Linear multiple empty models such as lm(y ~ 0) now have a
      correctly dimensioned empty coefficient matrix; reported by Brett
      Presnell.
    * vcov(&lt;empty mlm&gt;) and hence confint() now work (via a consistency
      change in summary.lm()).
    * confint(&lt;multiple lm()&gt;) now works correctly; reported on R-devel
      by Steven Pav.
    * quade.test() now also works correctly when its arguments are not
      yet sorted along groups, fixing PR#15842.
    * Installation on a Unix-alike tries harder to link to the pthread
      library where required (rather than relying on OpenMP to provide
      it: configuring with --disable-openmp was failing on some Linux
      systems).
    * The data.frame method for print(x) is fast now also for large
      data frames x and got an optional argument max, thanks to
      suggestions by Juan Telleria.
    * hist() no longer integer overflows in very rare cases, fixing</comment>

    <comment>-  CHANGES IN R 3.6.0:
  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
    * Serialization format version 3 becomes the default for
      serialization and saving of the workspace (save(), serialize(),
      saveRDS(), compiler::cmpfile()).  Serialized data in format 3
      cannot be read by versions of R prior to version 3.5.0.
      Serialization format version 2 is still supported and can be
      selected by version = 2 in the save/serialization functions.  The
      default can be changed back for the whole R session by setting
      environment variables R_DEFAULT_SAVE_VERSION and
      R_DEFAULT_SERIALIZE_VERSION to 2.  For maximal
      back-compatibility, files vignette.rds and partial.rdb generated
      by R CMD build are in serialization format version 2, and resave
      by default produces files in serialization format version 2
      (unless the original is already in format version 3).
    * The default method for generating from a discrete uniform
      distribution (used in sample(), for instance) has been changed.
      This addresses the fact, pointed out by Ottoboni and Stark, that
      the previous method made sample() noticeably non-uniform on large
      populations.  See PR#17494 for a discussion.  The previous method
      can be requested using RNGkind() or RNGversion() if necessary for
      reproduction of old results.  Thanks to Duncan Murdoch for
      contributing the patch and Gabe Becker for further assistance.
      The output of RNGkind() has been changed to also return the
      'kind' used by sample().
  NEW FEATURES:
    * Sys.setFileTime() has been vectorized so arguments path and time
      of length greater than one are now supported.
    * axis() gets new option gap.axis = NA for specifying a
      multiplication factor for the minimal &quot;gap&quot; (distance) between</comment>

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 3.6.1:
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * The default detection of the shell variable libNN is overridden
      for derivatives of Debian Linux, some of which have started to
      have a /usr/lib64 directory.  (E.g. Ubuntu 19.04.)  As before, it
      can be specified in config.site.
  UTILITIES:
    * R CMD config knows the values of AR and RANLIB, often set for LTO
      builds.
  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:
    * The use of a character vector with .Fortran() is formally
      deprecated and gives a non-portability warning.  (It has long
      been strongly discouraged in 'Writing R Extensions'.)
  BUG FIXES:
    * On Windows, GUI package installation via menuInstallPkgs() works
      again, thanks to Len Weil's and Duncan Murdoch's PR#17556.
    * R CMD check on data() fixing PR#17558 thanks to Duncan Murdoch.
    * quasi(*, variance = list(..)) now works more efficiently, and
      should work in all cases fixing PR#17560.  Further, quasi(var =
      mu(1-mu)) and quasi(var = &quot;mu ^ 3&quot;) now work, and quasi(variance
      = &quot;log(mu)&quot;) now gives a correct error message.
    * Creation of lazy loading database during package installation is
      again robust to Rprofile changing the current working directory
      (PR#17559).
    * boxplot(y ~ f, horizontal=TRUE) now produces correct x- and
      y-labels.
    * rbind.data.frame() allows to keep &lt;NA&gt; levels from factor columns
      (PR#17562) via new option factor.exclude.
      Additionally, it works in one more case with matrix-columns which
      had been reported on 2017-01-16 by Krzysztof Banas.</comment>

    <comment>-  CHANGES IN R 3.6.2:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * runmed(x, *) gains a new option na.action determining _how_ to
      handle NaN or NA in x.
    * dotchart() gains new options ann, xaxt, frame.plot and log.
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * Detection of the C stack direction has been moved from run-time
      to configure: this is safer with LTO builds and allows the
      detection to be overridden - see file config.site.
    * Source-code changes enable installation on platforms using gcc
      -fno-common (the expected default for gcc 10.x).
  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:
    * installTrChar (which is nowadays is wrapped by installChar) is
      defined in Rinternals.h.  (Neither are part of the API.)
  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:
    * Header Rconfig.h contains the value of FC_LEN_T deduced at
      installation which is used by the prototypes in headers
      R_ext/BLAS.h and R_ext/Lapack.h but to avoid extensive breakage
      this is only exposed when USE_FC_LEN_T is defined.
      If a package's C/C++ calls to BLAS/LAPACK allow for the 'hidden'
      arguments used by most Fortran compilers to pass the lengths of
      Fortran character arguments, define USE_FC_LEN_T and include
      Rconfig.h (possibly _via_ R.h) before including R_ext/BLAS.h or
      R_ext/Lapack.h.
    * A package with Fortran source code and perhaps C (but not C++)
      sources can request for its shared object/DLL to be linked by the
      Fortran compiler by including a line USE_FC_TO_LINK= in
      src/Makevars[.win] and using $(SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS) as part of
      PKG_LIBS.
      The known reason for doing so is a package which uses Fortran</comment>

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 3.6.3:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * The included LAPACK has been updated to version 3.9.0 (for the
      included routines, just bug fixes).
  BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a C level integer overflow in rhyper(); reported by
      Benjamin Tyner in PR#17694.
    * Uses of url(gzcon(.)) needing to extend buffer size have failed
      (with HTTP/2 servers), reported by G'abor Cs'ardi.
    * predict(loess(..), se=TRUE) now errors out (instead of
      seg.faulting etc) for large sample sizes, thanks to a report and
      patch by Benjamin Tyner in PR#17121.
    * tools:assertCondition(., &quot;error&quot;) and hence assertError() no
      longer return errors twice (invisibly).
    * update(form, new) in the case of a long new formula sometimes
      wrongly eliminated the intercept from form, or (more rarely)
      added a garbage term (or seg.faulted !); the fix happened by
      simplifying the C-level logic of terms.formula().  Reported by
      Mathias Amb&quot;uhl in PR#16326.
    * The error message from stopifnot(.., &lt;error producing call&gt;)
      again contains the full &quot;stopifnot(.......)&quot; call: Its attempted
      suppression did not work consistently.
    * On Windows, download.file(., , &quot;wininet&quot;, headers=character())
      would fail; reported with patch proposal by Kevin Ushey in
      PR#17710.

    <comment>- CHANGES IN 4.0.0:
  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
    * Packages need to be (re-)installed under this version (4.0.0) of
      R.
    * matrix objects now also inherit from class &quot;array&quot;, so e.g.,
      class(diag(1)) is c(&quot;matrix&quot;, &quot;array&quot;).  This invalidates code
      incorrectly assuming that class(matrix_obj)) has length one.
      S3 methods for class &quot;array&quot; are now dispatched for matrix
      objects.
    * There is a new syntax for specifying _raw_ character constants
      similar to the one used in C++: r&quot;(...)&quot; with ... any character
      sequence not containing the sequence )&quot;.  This makes it easier to
      write strings that contain backslashes or both single and double
      quotes.  For more details see ?Quotes.
    * R now uses a stringsAsFactors = FALSE default, and hence by
      default no longer converts strings to factors in calls to
      data.frame() and read.table().
      A large number of packages relied on the previous behaviour and
      so have needed/will need updating.
    * The plot() S3 generic function is now in package base rather than
      package graphics, as it is reasonable to have methods that do not
      use the graphics package.  The generic is currently re-exported
      from the graphics namespace to allow packages importing it from
      there to continue working, but this may change in future.
      Packages which define S4 generics for plot() should be
      re-installed and package code using such generics from other
      packages needs to ensure that they are imported rather than rely
      on their being looked for on the search path (as in a namespace,
      the base namespace has precedence over the search path).

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 4.0.1:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * paste() and paste0() gain a new optional argument recycle0.  When
      set to true, zero-length arguments are recycled leading to
      character(0) after the sep-concatenation, i.e., to the empty
      string &quot;&quot; if collapse is a string and to the zero-length value
      character(0) when collapse = NULL.
      A package whose code uses this should depend on R (&gt;= 4.0.1).
    * The summary(&lt;warnings&gt;) method now maps the counts correctly to
      the warning messages.
  BUG FIXES:
    * aov(frml, ...) now also works where the formula deparses to more
      than 500 characters, thanks to a report and patch proposal by Jan
      Hauffa.
    * Fix a dozen places (code, examples) as Sys.setlocale() returns
      the new rather than the previous setting.
    * Fix for adding two complex grid units via sum().  Thanks to Gu
      Zuguang for the report and Thomas Lin Pedersen for the patch.
    * Fix parallel::mclapply(..., mc.preschedule=FALSE) to handle raw
      vector results correctly. PR#17779
    * Computing the base value, i.e., 2, &quot;everywhere&quot;, now uses
      FLT_RADIX, as the original machar code looped indefinitely on the
      ppc64 architecture for the longdouble case.
    * In R 4.0.0, sort.list(x) when is.object(x) was true, e.g., for x
      &lt;- I(letters), was accidentally using method = &quot;radix&quot;.
      Consequently, e.g., merge(&lt;data.frame&gt;) was much slower than
      previously; reported in PR#17794.
    * plot(y ~ x, ylab = quote(y[i])) now works, as e.g., for xlab;
      related to PR#10525.
    * parallel::detect.cores(all.tests = TRUE) tries a matching OS name</comment>

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 4.0.3:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * On platforms using configure option --with-internal-tzcode,
      additional values &quot;internal&quot; and (on macOS only) &quot;macOS&quot; are
      accepted for the environment variable TZDIR.  (See ?TZDIR.)
      On macOS, &quot;macOS&quot; is used by default if the system timezone
      database is a newer version than that in the R installation.
    * When install.packages(type = &quot;source&quot;) fails to find a package in
      a repository it mentions package versions which are excluded by
      their R version requirement and links to hints on why a package
      might not be found.
    * The default value for options(&quot;timeout&quot;) can be set from
      enviromnent variable R_DEFAULT_INTERNET_TIMEOUT, still defaulting
      to 60 (seconds) if that is not set or invalid.
      This may be needed when child R processes are doing downloads,
      for example during the installation of source packages which
      download jars or other forms of data.
  LINK-TIME OPTIMIZATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * There is now support for parallelized Link-Time Optimization
      (LTO) with GCC and for 'thin' LTO with clang _via_ setting the
      LTO macro.
    * There is support for setting a different LTO flag for the Fortran
      compiler, including to empty when mixing clang and gfortran (as
      on macOS).  See file config.site.
    * There is a new LTO_LD macro to set linker options for LTO
      compilation, for example to select an alternative linker or to
      parallelize thin LTO.
  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:
    * The LINPACK argument to chol.default(), chol2inv(),
      solve.default() and svd() has been defunct since R 3.1.0.  Using</comment>

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 4.0.4:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * File share/texmf/tex/latex/jss.cls has been updated to work with
      LaTeX versions since Oct 2020.
    * Unicode character width tables (as used by nchar(, type = &quot;w&quot;))
      have been updated to Unicode 12.1 by Brodie Gaslam (PR#17781),
      including many emoji.
    * The internal table for iswprint (used on Windows, macOS and AIX)
      has been updated to include many recent Unicode characters.
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * If an external BLAS is specified by --with-blas=foo or _via_
      environment variable BLAS_LIBS is not found, this is now a
      configuration error.  The previous behaviour was not clear from
      the documentation: it was to continue the search as if
      --with-blas=yes was specified.
  BUG FIXES:
    * all.equal(x,y) now &quot;sees&quot; the two different NAs in factors,
      thanks to Bill Dunlap and others in PR#17897.
    * (~ NULL)[1] and similar formula subsetting now works, thanks to a
      report and patch by Henrik Bengtsson in PR#17935.  Additionally,
      subsetting leaving an empty formula now works too, thanks to
      suggestions by Suharto Anggono.
    * .traceback(n) keeps source references again, as before R 4.0.0,
       fixing a regression; introduced by the PR#17580, reported
       including two patch proposals by Brodie Gaslam.
    * unlist(plst, recursive=FALSE) no longer drops content for
      pairlists with list components, thanks to the report and patch by
      Suharto Anggono in PR#17950.
    * iconvlist() now also works on MUSL based (Linux) systems, from a
      report and patch suggestion by Wesley Chan in PR#17970.</comment>

    * The change to the internal table in R 4.0.4 for iswprint has been
          reverted: it contained some errors in printability of 'East
	        Asian' characters.
    * For packages using LazyData, R CMD build ignored the
          --resave-data option and the BuildResaveData field of the
	        DESCRIPTION file (in R versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.4).</comment>

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 4.1.0:
  FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
    * It is planned that the 4.1.x series will be the last to support
      32-bit Windows, with production of binary packages for that
      series continuing until early 2023.
  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
    * Data set esoph in package datasets now provides the correct
      numbers of controls; previously it had the numbers of cases added
      to these.  (Reported by Alexander Fowler in PR#17964.)
  NEW FEATURES:
    * www.omegahat.net is no longer one of the repositories known by
      default to setRepositories().  (Nowadays it only provides source
      packages and is often unavailable.)
    * Function package_dependencies() (in package tools) can now use
      different dependency types for direct and recursive dependencies.
    * The checking of the size of tarball in R CMD check --as-cran
      &lt;pkg&gt; may be tweaked via the new environment variable
      _R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_TARBALL_THRESHOLD_, as suggested in
      PR#17777 by Jan Gorecki.
    * Using c() to combine a factor with other factors now gives a
      factor, an ordered factor when combining ordered factors with
      identical levels.
    * apply() gains a simplify argument to allow disabling of
      simplification of results.
    * The format() method for class &quot;ftable&quot; gets a new option justify.
      (Suggested by Thomas Soeiro.)
    * New ...names() utility.  (Proposed by Neal Fultz in PR#17705.)
    * type.convert() now warns when its as.is argument is not
      specified, as the help file always said it _should_.  In that
      case, the default is changed to TRUE in line with its change in</comment>

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 4.1.3:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * The default version of Bioconductor has been changed to 3.14.
      (This is used by setRepositories and the menus in GUIs.)
  UTILITIES:
    * R CMD check --as-cran has a workaround for a bug in versions of
      file up to at least 5.41 which mis-identify DBF files last
      changed in 2022 as executables.
  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:
    * The legacy S-compatibility macros SINGLE_* in R_ext/Constants.h
      (included by R.h) are deprecated and will be removed in R 4.2.0.
  BUG FIXES:
    * Initialization of self-starting nls() models with initialization
      functions following the pre-R-4.1.0 API (without the ...
      argument) works again for now, with a deprecation warning.
    * Fixed quoting of ~autodetect~ in Java setting defaults to avoid
      inadvertent user lookup due to leading ~, reported in PR#18231 by
      Harold Gutch.
    * substr(., start, stop) &lt;- v now treats _negative_ stop values
      correctly.  Reported with a patch in PR#18228 by Brodie Gaslam.
    * Subscripting an array x without dimnames by a
      length(dim(x))-column character matrix gave &quot;random&quot; non-sense,
      now an error; reported in PR#18244 by Mikael Jagan.
    * ...names() now matches names(list(...)) closely, fixing PR#18247.
    * all.equal(*, scale = s) now works as intended when length(s) &gt; 1,
      partly thanks to Michael Chirico's PR#18272.
    * print(x) for long vectors x now also works for named atomic
      vectors or lists and prints the correct number when reaching the
      getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) limit; partly thanks to a report and
      proposal by Hugh Parsonage to the R-devel list.</comment>

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
    * The formula method of aggregate() now matches the generic in
      naming its first argument x (resolving PR#18299 by Thomas
      Soeiro).
      This means that calling aggregate() with a formula as a named
      first argument requires name formula in earlier versions of R and
      name x now, so portable code should not name the argument (code
      in many packages did).
    * Calling &amp;&amp; or || with either argument of length greater than one
      now gives a warning (which it is intended will become an error).
    * Calling if() or while() with a condition of length greater than
      one gives an error rather than a warning.  Consequently,
      environment variable _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_ no longer has
      any effect.
    * Windows users should consult the WINDOWS section below for some
      profound changes including
        * Support for 32-bit builds has been dropped.
        * UTF-8 locales are used where available.
        * The default locations for the R installation and personal
          library folder have been changed.
      Thanks to Tomas Kalibera for months of work on the Windows port
      for this release.
  NEW FEATURES:
    * matrix(x, n, m) now warns in more cases where length(x) differs
      from n * m, as suggested by Abby Spurdle and Wolfgang Huber in
      Feb 2021 on the R-devel mailing list.
      This warning can be turned into an error by setting environment
      variable _R_CHECK_MATRIX_DATA_ to TRUE: R CMD check --as-cran
      does so unless it is already set.</comment>

    <comment>- CHANGES IN R 4.2.2:
  NEW FEATURES:
    * tools::Rdiff(useDiff = TRUE) checks for the presence of an
      external diff command and switches to useDiff = FALSE if none is
      found.  This allows R CMD Rdiff to always work.
    * On Windows, environment variable R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT
      can be used to switch to only 'best-effort' SSL certificate
      revocation checks with the default &quot;libcurl&quot; download method.
      This reduces security, but may be needed for downloads to work
      with MITM proxies (PR#18379).
    * (macOS) The run-time check for libraries from XQuartz for X11 and
      Tcl/Tk no longer uses otool from the Apple Developer Tools
      (PR#18400).
    * The LaTeX style for producing the PDF manuals, Rd.sty, now loads
      the standard amsmath, amsfonts and amssymb packages for greater
      coverage of math commands in the Rd \eqn and \deqn macros.  The
      \mathscr LaTeX command is also provided (via the mathrsfs
      package, if available, or the amsfonts bundle otherwise),
      fulfilling the wish of PR#18398.
    * (Windows) The default format of readClipboard() and
      writeClipboard() has been changed to 13 (CF_UNICODETEXT).
  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:
    * The PDF manuals (if built) can be compacted by the new target
      make compact-pdf (at the top level or in directory doc/manual).
    * There is now configure support for LLVM clang 15 on Linux, which
      defaults to position-independent (PIE) executables whereas
      gfortran does not.
    * Many small changes to ease compilation (and suppress warnings)
      with LLVM clang 15.
