 Redis Server
==============

1. cp -a /etc/redis/default.conf.example /etc/redis/instancename.conf

We use the "cp -a" here, so that our permissions are preserved.
In case you copied the file with out the "-a"

chown root:redis  /etc/redis/instancename.conf
chmod u=rw,g=r,o= /etc/redis/instancename.conf

2. change at least pidfile, logfile and dir setting
# the pid file *has* to match your config filename without the ".conf"

pidfile /run/redis/instancename.pid
logfile /var/log/redis/instancename.log
dir /var/lib/redis/instancename/

If you want to run more than one instance you also have to change the
socket path and/or the ip:port combination.
 e.g. /run/redis/instancename.sock

Also make sure if you copy configurations from somewhere, that "daemonize"
should be set to "no".

3. create the database dir:
$ install -d -o redis -g redis -m 0750 /var/lib/redis/instancename/

4. systemctl start redis@instancename
5. systemctl enable redis@instancename

6. To stop/restart all instances at the same time use:

systemctl restart redis.target
systemctl stop redis.target

 Redis Sentinel
================

1. cp -a /etc/redis/sentinel.conf.example /etc/redis/sentinel-instancename.conf

We use the "cp -a" here, so that our permissions are preserved.
In case you copied the file with out the "-a"

chown root:redis  /etc/redis/sentinel-instancename.conf
chmod u=rw,g=rw,o= /etc/redis/sentinel-instancename.conf

Please note that the sentinel config needs write permissions for the group.
The chmod line differs from the line for the normal redis server.

2. change at least pidfile, logfile setting
# the pid file *has* to match your config filename without the ".conf"

pidfile /run/redis/instancename.pid
logfile /var/log/redis/instancename.log

If you want to run more than one instance you also have to change the
socket path and/or the ip:port combination.
 e.g. /run/redis/instancename.sock

Also make sure if you copy configurations from somewhere, that "daemonize"
should be set to "no".

4. systemctl start redis-sentinel@instancename
5. systemctl enable redis-sentinel@instancename

6. To stop/restart all instances at the same time use:

systemctl restart redis-sentinel.target
systemctl stop redis-sentinel.target

 Integration with apache when using unix domain sockets
=========================================================

If you plan to use redis in combination with apache, then you should
add 'redis' to apache group and set 'unixsocketperm 770':
$ usermod -a -G redis wwwrun
$ systemctl restart apache2
then apache is able to connect to redis socket
