    If you're using big-endian please consider the compatibility implications with
    RESTORE, replication and persistence.
  * Fix wrong order of key/value in Lua's map response (#8266)
    If your scripts use redis.setresp() or return a map (new in Redis 6.0), please

  * ACL patterns for Pub/Sub channels (#7993)
  * Support ACL for Sentinel mode (#7888)
  * Support getting configuration from both stdin and file at the same time (#7893)
    Lets you avoid storing secrets on the disk.
  New features in CLI tools:
  * redis-cli RESP3 push support (#7609)
  * redis-cli cluster import support source and target that require auth (#7994)
  * redis-cli URIs able to provide user name in addition to password (#8048)
  * redis-cli/redis-benchmark allow specifying the prefered ciphers/ciphersuites (#8005)
  * redis-cli add -e option to exit with code when command execution fails (#8136)
  Command behavior changes:
  * EXISTS should not alter LRU (#8016)
    In Redis 5.0 and 6.0 it would have touched the LRU/LFU of the key.
  * OBJECT should not reveal logically expired keys (#8016)
    Will now behave the same TYPE or any other non-DEBUG command.
  * Improve db id range check for SELECT and MOVE (#8085)
    Changes the error message text on a wrong db index.
  * Modify AUTH / HELLO error message (#7648)
    Changes the error message text when the user isn't found or is disabled.
  * BITOPS length limited to proto_max_bulk_len rather than 512MB (#8096)
    The limit is now configurable like in SETRANGE, and APPEND.
  * GEORADIUS[BYMEMBER] can fail with -OOM if Redis is over the memory limit (#8107)
  Other behavior changes:
  * Optionally (default) fail to start if requested bind address is not available (#7936)
    If you rely on Redis starting successfully even if one of the bind addresses
    is not available, you'll need to tune the new config.
  * Limit the main db dictionaries expansion to prevent key eviction (#7954)
    In the past big dictionary rehashing could result in massive data eviction.
    Now this rehashing is delayed (up to a limit), which can result in performance
    loss due to hash collisions.
  * CONFIG REWRITE is atomic and safer, but requires write access to the config file's folder (#7824, #8051)
    This change was already present in 6.0.9, but was missing from the release
    notes.
  * A new incremental eviction mechanism that reduces latency on eviction spikes (#7653)
    In pathological cases this can cause memory to grow uncontrolled and may require
    specific tuning.
  * Not resetting "save" config when Redis is started with command line arguments. (#7092)
    In case you provide command line arguments without "save" and count on it
    being disabled, Now the defaults "save" config will kick in.
  * Update memory metrics for INFO during loading (#7690)
  * When "supervised" config is enabled, it takes precedence over "daemonize". (#8036)
  * Assertion and panic, print crash log without generating SIGSEGV (#7585)
  * Added crash log report on SIGABRT, instead of silently exiting (#8004)
  * Disable THP (Transparent Huge Pages) if enabled (#7381)
    If you deliberately enabled it, you'll need to config Redis to keep it.
  Bug fixes:
  * Handle output buffer limits for module blocked clients (#8141)
    Could result in a module sending reply to a blocked client to go beyond the
    limit.
  * Fix setproctitle related crashes. (#8150, #8088)
    Caused various crashes on startup, mainly on Apple M1 chips or under
    instrumentation.
  * A module doing RM_Call could cause replicas to get nested MULTI (#8097).
  * Backup/restore cluster mode keys to slots map for repl-diskless-load=swapdb (#8108)
    In cluster mode with repl-diskless-load, when loading failed, slot map
    wouldn't have been restored.
  * Fix oom-score-adj-values range, and bug when used in config file (#8046)
    Enabling setting this in the config file in a line after enabling it, would
    have been buggy.
  * Reset average ttl when empty databases (#8106)
    Just causing misleading metric in INFO
  * Disable rehash when Redis has child process (#8007)
    This could have caused excessive CoW during BGSAVE, replication or AOFRW.
  * Further improved ACL algorithm for picking categories (#7966)
    Output of ACL GETUSER is now more similar to the one provided by ACL SETUSER.
  * Fix bug with module GIL being released prematurely (#8061)
    Could in theory (and rarely) cause multi-threaded modules to corrupt memory.
  * Fix cluster redirect for module command with no firstkey. (#7539)
  * Reduce effect of client tracking causing feedback loop in key eviction (#8100)
  * Kill disk-based fork child when all replicas drop and 'save' is not enabled (#7819)
  * Rewritten commands (modified for propagation) are logged as their original command (#8006)
  * Fix cluster access to unaligned memory (SIGBUS on old ARM) #7958
  * If diskless repl child is killed, make sure to reap the child pid (#7742)
  * Broadcast a PONG message when slot's migration is over, may reduce MOVED responses (#7571)
  Other improvements:
  * TLS Support in redis-benchmark (#7959)
  * Accelerate diskless master connections, and general re-connections (#6271)
  * Run active defrag while blocked / loading (#7726)
  * Performance and memory reporting improvement - sds take control of its internal fragmentation (#7875)
  * Speedup cluster failover. (#7948)
  Platform / toolchain support related improvements:
  * Optionally (not by default) use H/W Monotonic clock for faster time sampling (#7644)
  * Remove the requirements for C11 and _Atomic supporting compiler (#7707)
    This would allow to more easily build and use Redis on older systems and
    compilers again.
  * Fix crash log registers output on ARM. (#8020)
  * Raspberry build fix. (#8095)
  * Setting process title support for Haiku. (#8060)

  Info fields and introspection changes:
  * Add INFO fields to track diskless and disk-based replication progress (#7981)
  * Add INFO field for main thread cpu time, and scrape system time. (#8132)
  * Add total_forks to INFO STATS (#8155)

  * Add tracking bcast flag and client redirection in client list (#7995)
  * Fixed INFO client_recent_max_input_buffer includes argv array (#8065, see #7874)
  * Note that a few other changes listed above added their info fields.
  Module API changes:
  * Add CTX_FLAGS_DENY_BLOCKING as a unified the way to know if blocking is allowed (#8025)
  * Add data type callbacks for lazy free effort, and unlink (#7912)
  * Add data type callback for COPY command (#8112)
  * Add callbacks for defrag support. (#8149)

Thu Jun  6 20:43:34 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 5.0.5
  Major changes from the Redis 5 series:

  1. The new Stream data type.
     https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
  2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers, Cluster and Dictionary APIs.
  3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
  4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C
     code inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for
     more info.
  5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
  6. Active defragmentation version 2.
  7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
  8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
  9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
  10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect
      often.
  11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
  12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1
  13. CLIENT UNBLOCK and CLIENT ID.
  14. The LOLWUT command was added. http://antirez.com/news/123
  15. We no longer use the "slave" word if not for API backward
      compatibility.
  16. Differnet optimizations in the networking layer.
  17. Lua improvements:
      - Better propagation of Lua scripts to replicas / AOF.
      - Lua scripts can now timeout and get in -BUSY state in the
        replica as well.
  18. Dynamic HZ to balance idle CPU usage with responsiveness.
  19. The Redis core was refactored and improved in many ways.

  However the list above really does not do justice to the changes
  of Redis 5 since the core was improved in many ways during the
  development of the new version. However certain changes were back
  ported into Redis 4 once they were sensed as safe, because many
  improvements were hard to distinguish from fixes.

  The most important user facing improvement is without doubts the
  introduction of the new general purpose data type after years:
  the streams.

  Note that we worked to improve and fix streams till a few hours
  ago, so while we are not aware of critical bugs in this release,
  surely there is to handle it with some care for the first weeks.
  Bug reporting will be highly appreciated and we are ready to work
  immediately to release 5.0.1 once there is enough important stuff
  to justify a new release (probably soon).

  People not using the streams can have probably a better
  production-ready experience with Redis 5, also because many
  internals are shared with Redis 4 so the jump is not as big as it
  was between 3.2 and 4 in terms of how things internally work.

  Well, many thanks to the Redis community and the developers that
  made this release possible, contributing bug reports, patches,
  new features, working on the clients, sometimes debugging
  problems for days. Also thank to everybody that adopted Redis for
  their use cases making things work for users worldwide.

  already.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  6 17:01:14 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- added systemd unit file file redis-sentinel
  - the unit file uses the same multiple instance mechanism as the
    normal redis unit file

    systemctl start redis-sentinel@default will look for

    /etc/redis/sentinel-default.conf

    and expects a pid file

    /var/run/redis/sentinel-default.pid

    Please make sure your sentinel config sets the pid file.

  - adapted the default sentinel.conf.example to set the pid file
    and the log file similar to the normal redis.conf:
    /var/log/redis/sentinel-<instancename>.log
    /var/run/redis/sentinel-<instancename>.pid

    The unit file checks for the pid file so please adapt your
    local sentinel configs.

    Changed: redis-conf.patch
  - adapt and restructure README.SUSE
    - move the LimitNoFile to the service file itself so the user
      do not have to manually do that step for every instance
    - move the apache integration into its own section
    - add section for redis-sentinel
  - install sentinel example config with group write permissions
    to indicate that the actually config needs to be writable.

- Update to 4.0.11
  * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/4.0.11/00-RELEASENOTES
  * The disconnection time between the master and slave was reset
    in an incorrect place, sometimes a good slave will not be able
    to failover because it claims it was disconnected for too much
    time from the master.
  * A replication bug, rare to trigger but non impossible, is in
    Redis for years. It was lately discovered at Redis Labs and
    fixed by Oran Agra. It may cause disconnections,
    desynchronizations and other issues.
  * RANDOMKEY may go in infinite loop on rare situations. Now fixed.
  * EXISTS now works in a more consistent way on slaves.
  * Sentinel: backport of an option to deny a potential security
    problem when the SENTINEL command is used to configure an
    arbitrary script to execute.

  - Important security issues related to the Lua scripting engine.
    Please check https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/5017 for
    more information.
  - A bug with SCAN, SSCAN, HSCAN and ZSCAN, that may not return
    all the elements.  We also add a regression test that can
    trigger the issue often when present, and may in theory be able
    to find unrelated regressions.
  - A PSYNC2 bug is fixed: Redis should not expire keys when saving
    RDB files because otherwise it is no longer possible to use
    such RDB file as a base for partial resynchronization. It no
    longer represents the right state.
  - Compatibility of AOF with RDB preamble when the RDB checksum is
    disabled.
  - Sentinel bug that in some cases prevented Sentinel to detect
    that the master was down immediately. A delay was added to the
    detection.

  * Latency monitor could report wrong latencies under certain conditions.
  * AOF rewriting could fail when a backgronud rewrite is triggered and
    at the same time the AOF is switched on/off.
  * Redis Cluster crash-recovery safety improved.
  * Redis Cluster has now the ability to configure certain slaves so that
    they'll never attempt a failover.
  * Keyspace notifications API in modules.
  * RM_Call() is now faster by reusing the same client.

- Update to 4.0.7
  * Release notes: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/4.0.7/00-RELEASENOTES
  * Many 32 bit overflows were addressed in order to allow to use Redis with
    a very significant amount of data, memory size permitting.
  * MEMORY USAGE fixed for the list type.
  * Allow read-only scripts in Redis Cluster.
  * Fix AOF pipes setup in edge case.
  * AUTH option for MIGRATE.
  * HyperLogLogs are no longer converted from sparse to dense in order
    to be merged.
  * Fix AOF rewrite dead loop under edge cases.
  * Fix processing of large bulk strings (>= 2GB).
  * Added RM_UnlinkKey in modules API.
  * Fix Redis Cluster crashes when certain commands with a variable number
    of arguments are called in an improper way.
  * Fix memory leak in lazyfree engine.
  * Fix many potentially successful partial synchronizations that end
    doing a full SYNC, because of a bug destroying the replication
    backlog on the slave. So after a failover the slave was often not able
    to PSYNC with masters, and a full SYNC was triggered. The bug only
    happened after 1 hour of uptime so escaped the unit tests.
  * Improve anti-affinity in master/slave allocation for Redis Cluster
    when the cluster is created.
  * Improve output buffer handling for slaves, by not limiting the amount
    of writes a slave could receive.

- Update to 4.0.2
  * Release notes: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/4.0.2/00-RELEASENOTES
  * Different replication fixes to PSYNC2, the new 4.0 replication engine.
  * Modules thread safe contexts were introduced. They are an experimental
    API right now, but the API is considered to be stable and usable when needed.
  * SLOWLOG now logs the offending client name and address. Note that this is a
    backward compatibility breakage in case old code assumes that the slowlog
    entry is composed of exactly three entries.
  * The modules native data types RDB format changed.
  * The AOF check utility is now able to deal with RDB preambles.
  * GEORADIUS_RO and GEORADIUSBYMEMBER_RO variants, not supporting the STORE option,
    were added in order to allow read-only scaling of such queries.
  * HSET is now variadic, and HMSET is considered deprecated
    (but will be supported for years to come). Please use HSET in new code.
  * GEORADIUS huge radius (>= ~6000 km) corner cases fixed,
    certain elements near the edges were not returned.
  * DEBUG DIGEST modules API added.
  * HyperLogLog commands no longer crash on certain input (non HLL) strings.
  * Fixed SLAVEOF inside MULTI/EXEC blocks.
  * Many other minor bug fixes and improvements.

Wed Jun 29 12:14:42 UTC 2016 - rmaliska@suse.com

- Update to 3.2.1
* [FIX] Cleaned up spec file.
* [FIX] Critical bug in Sentinel was hopefully fixed.
* [FIX] BITFIELD bugs fixed.
* [FIX] GEO commands fixes on syntax errors and edge cases.
* [NEW] RESOTRE now accepts dumps generated by older Redis versions.
* [NEW] Jemalloc now is configured to save you memory, for a problem a
        change in the jemalloc configuration did not really survived when the
        3.2.0 release was finalized.
* [NEW] TTL and TYPE command no longer alter the last access time of a key, for
        LRU evictions purposes. A new TOUCH command was introduced *just* to
        update the access time of a key.
* [FIX] A bug was fixed in redis-cli, that connected to the instance running on the
        port 6379 if there was one, regardless of what was specified.
* [NEW] TCP keep alive is now enabled by default. This should fix most ghost
        connections problems without resulting in any practical change in otherwise
        sane deployments.
* [FIX] A Sentinel crash that could happen during failovers was fixed.
* [NEW] avg_ttl reporting in INFO improved.
* [NEW] Sentinel: improve handling of known Sentinel instances.
* [NEW] Redis Cluster address update (via gossip section) processing improved
        to avoid initiating inwanted handshakes.
* [FIX] Critical bug fixed: There was a problem in the way a cluster instance 
        loaded the AOF that could cause data written via scripts to be lost during 
        reshardings.
* [NEW] There is a new very powerful BITFIELD command. Check the documentation
        here: http://redis.io/commands/BITFIELD
* [NEW] CONFIG GET is allowed during the loading of the dataset.
* [NEW] The DEBUG command have new features and can show an help with DEBUG HELP.
* [NEW] redis-cli show hits about the commands arguments to the right.
* [NEW] GEORADIUS got a STORE / STOREDIST option to store the result into a target
        key (as as orted set) instead of reporting it to the user.
* [NEW] Redis Cluster replicas migration now works in a slightly different way. In
        the past a slave could migrate only to a master that used to have slaves
        in the past (and if there was still trace of this information). Now instead
        if a new slave gets at least a slot, and at least one other master in the
        cluster has a slave, then the new master is considered a valid target for
        replica migration. So if it will be orphaned and there is a spare slave
        it will get one.
* [NEW] CLUSTER SLOTS output now includes the node ID (in a backward compatible
        manner).

Wed Feb 17 12:17:41 UTC 2016 - eshmarnev@suse.com

- Update to 3.0.7:
* [FIX] Many fixes to MIGRATE multiple keys implementation.
* [FIX] A Redis Cluster node crash was fixed because of wrong handling of
        node->slaveof pointers.
* [FIX] Fix redis-trib rebalance when nodes need to be left empty because
        the specified weight is zero.
* [FIX] MIGRATE: Never send -ASK redirections for MIGRATE when there are
* [FIX] Lua debugger crash when printing too deeply nested objects.
* [FIX] Redis-cli implementation of Lua debugging now allows to use the
        SCRIPT DEBUG command directly, switching to debugging mode as needed.
* [FIX] Redis-trib is now able to fix more errors. A new CLUSTER subcommand
        called BUMPEPOCH was introduced in order to support new modes
        for the "fix" subcommand.
* [NEW] Redis proctected mode: this feature improves Redis security and makes
        harder to run Redis in a configuration that is unsecure because no
        firewalling was used in order to protect Redis from external accesses.
* [NEW] Cluster/Sentinel tests now use OSX leak to perform leak detection
        at the end of every unit.
* [NEW] Detect and show server crashes during Cluster/Sentinel tests.
* [NEW] More reliable Cluster/Sentinel test becuase of timing errors and
        -LOADING errors. 
* [FIX] lua_struct.c/getnum security issue fixed. 
* [FIX] Redis Cluster replica migration fixed.
* [FIX] Fix a race condition in processCommand() because of interactions
        with freeMemoryIfNeeded(). 
* [NEW] Backported from the upcoming Redis 3.2:
        MIGRATE now supports an extended multiple-keys pipelined mode, which
        is an order of magnitude faster. Redis Cluster now uses this mode
        in order to perform reshardings and rebalancings.
* [NEW] Backported from the upcoming Redis 3.2:
        Redis Cluster has now support for rebalancing via the redis-trib
        rebalance command. Demo here:
* [NEW] Redis Cluster redis-trib.rb new "info" subcommand.
* [NEW] Redis Cluster tests improved. 
* [NEW] Log offending memory access address on SIGSEGV/SIGBUS

- Update to 3.0.5
  * [FIX] MOVE now moves the TTL as well. A bug lasting forever... 
		finally fixed thanks to Andy Grunwald that reported it.
	* [FIX] Fix a false positive in HSTRLEN test.
	* [FIX] Fix a bug in redis-cli --pipe mode that was not able to 
		read back replies from the server incrementally. Now a mass 
		import will use a lot less memory, and you can use --pipe to 
		do incremental streaming.
	* [FIX] Slave detection of master timeout.
	* [NEW] Cluster: redis-trib fix can fix an additional case for 
		opens lots.
	* [NEW] Cluster: redis-trib import support for --copy and 
		--replace options

- update to 3.0.4
  Upgrade urgency: HIGH for Redis and Sentinel. However note that in
                   order to fix certain replication bugs, the
                   replication internals were modified in a very heavy
                   way. So while this release is conceptually saner, it
                   may contain regressions. For this reason, before the
                   release, QA activities were performed by me (antirez)
                   and Redis Labs and no evident bug was found.

  - [FIX] A number of bugs related to replication PSYNC and the (yet
    experimental) diskless replication feature were fixed. The bugs
    could lead to inconsistency between masters and slaves. (Salvatore
    Sanfilippo, Oran Agra fixed the issue found by Yuval Inbar)
  - [FIX] A replication bug in the context of PSYNC partial
    resynchonization was found and fixed. This bug happens even when
    diskless replication is off in the case different slaves connect at
    different times while the master is creating an RDB file, and later
    a partial resynchronization is attempted by a slave that connected
    not as the first one. (Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran Agra)
  - [FIX] Chained replication and PSYNC interactions leading to
    potential stale chained slaves data set, see issue #2694. (Salvatore
    Sanfilippo fixed an issue reported by "GeorgeBJ" user at Github)
  - [FIX] redis-cli --scan iteration fixed when returned cursor
    overflows 32 bit signed integer. (Ofir Luzon, Yuval Inbar)
  - [FIX] Sentinel: fixed a bug during the master switch process, where
    for a failed conditional check, the new configuration is rewritten,
    during a small window of time, in a corrupted way where the master
    is also reported to be one of the slaves. This bug is rare to
    trigger but apparently it happens in the wild, and the effect is to
    see a replication loop where the master will try to replicate with
    itself.  A detailed explanation of the bug and its effects can be
    found in the commit message here:
    https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/c20218eb5770b2cafb12bc7092313b8358fedc0a.
    The bug was found by Jan-Erik Rediger using a static analyzer and
    fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo.
  - [FIX] Sentinel lack of arity checks for certain commands.  (Rogerio
    Goncalves, Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  - [NEW] Replication internals rewritten in order to be more resistant
    to bugs.  The replication handshake in the slave side was rewritten
    as a non blocking state machine. (Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran Agra)
  - [NEW] New "replication capabilities" feature introduced in order to
    signal from the master to the slave what are the features supported,
    so that the master can choose the kind of replication to start
    (diskless or not) when master and slave are of different versions.
    (Oran Agra, Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  - [NEW] Log clients details when SLAVEOF command is received.

    Gravell).

  * [FIX] Fix blocking operations timeout precision when HZ is at
          its default value (not increased) and there are thousands
          of clients connected at the same time. This bug affected
          Sidekiq users that experienced a very long delay for

- update to 3.0.0
  >> What's new in Redis 3.0 compared to Redis 2.8?

  * Redis Cluster: a distributed implementation of a subset of Redis.
  * New "embedded string" object encoding resulting in less cache
    misses. Big speed gain under certain work loads.
  * AOF child -> parent final data transmission to minimize latency
    due to "last write" during AOF rewrites.
  * Much improved LRU approximation algorithm for keys eviction.
  * WAIT command to block waiting for a write to be transmitted
    to the specified number of slaves.
  * MIGRATE connection caching. Much faster keys migraitons.
  * MIGARTE new options COPY and REPLACE.
  * CLIENT PAUSE command: stop processing client requests for a
    specified amount of time.
  * BITCOUNT performance improvements.
  * CONFIG SET accepts memory values in different units (for
    example you can use "CONFIG SET maxmemory 1gb").
  * Redis log format slightly changed reporting in each line the
    role of the instance (master/slave) or if it's a saving child
    log.
  * INCR performance improvements.

  >> Refactoring changes (no new features nor bug fixes)

  * Blocking operations full refactoring (blocked.c)
  * Client output buffer memory tracking refactored.

    (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [FIX] Enable HAVE_ATOMIC for PowerPC. (Matt Stancliff)
  * [FIX] More robust PSYNC and AOF rewrites tests.

          (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [NEW] The COMMAND command, exposing the Redis command table
          as an API. (Matt Stancliff)
  * [NEW] Update used memory with C11 __atomic. (Matt Stancliff)
- additional changes from 2.8.12
  * [FIX / BREAKS BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY] Using SELECT inside Lua
    scripts no longer makes the selected DB to be set in the
    calling client.  So Lua can still use SELECT, but the client
    calling the script will remain set to the original DB. Thix
    fixes an issue with Redis replication of Lua scripts that
    called SELECT without reverting the selected DB to the original
    one. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [FIX] Sentinel failover was instalbe if the master was detected
    as available during the failover (especially during manual
    failovers) because of an implementation error (lack of checking
    of SRI_PROMOTED flag). (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [FIX] Cancel SHUTDOWN if initial AOF is being written.
    (Matt Stancliff)
  * [FIX] Sentinel: bind source address for outcoming connections.

  * [NEW] redis-cli --intrinsic-latency stopped with SIGINT still
    reports stats (Matt Stancliff)
  * [NEW] Sentinels broadcast an HELLO message ASAP after a
    failover in order to reach a consistent state faster (before it
    relied for periodic HELLO messages). (Salvatore Sanfilippo).
  * [NEW] Jemalloc updated to 3.6.0. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [NEW] CLIENT LIST speedup. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [NEW] CLIENT LIST new unique incremental ID to every client.
    (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [NEW] ROLE command added. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [NEW] CLIENT KILL new form to kill by client type and ID (see
    doc at redis.io for more info). (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [NEW] Sentinel now disconnects clients when instances are
    reconfigured (see http://redis.io/topics/sentinel-clients).
    (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
  * [NEW] Hiredis update to latest version. (Matt Stancliff)

- additional changes from 2.8.11
  # UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH if you use Lua scripting, LOW otherwise.
  * [FIX] A previous fix for Lua -> Redis numerical precision
    enhancement introduced a new problem. In Redis 2.8.10 commands
    called from Lua passing a string that "looks like" a very large
    number, may actually use as argument the string converted as a
    float. This bug is now fixed.
  * [FIX] Now commands other than *PUSH* adding elements to a list
    will be able to awake clients blocked in a blocking POP
    operation.
  * [FIX] Cygwin compilation fixes.

- additional changes from 2.8.10
  # UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH if you use min-slaves-to-write option.
  * [FIX] IMPORTANT! A min-slaves-to-write option active in a slave
    totally prevented the slave from acception the master stream of
    commands.  This release includes testes for
    min-slaves-to-write, and a fix for this issue.
  * [FIX] Sometimes DEL returned 1 for already expired keys. Fixed.
  * [FIX] Fix test false positive because new osx 'leaks' output.
  * [FIX] PFCOUNT HLL cache invalidation fixed: no wrong value was
    reported but the cache was not used at all, leading to lower
    performances.
  * [FIX] Accept(2) multiple clients per readable-event invocation,
    and better processing of I/O while loading or busy running a
    timedout script.  Basically now the LOADING / BUSY errors are
    reported at a decent speed.
  * [FIX] A softwaer watchdog crash fixed.
  * [FIX] Fixed a Lua -> Redis numerical precision loss.
  * [NEW] Lua scripting engine speed improved.
  * [NEW] Sentinel generates one new event for humans to understand
    better what is happening during a failover:
    +config-update-from.  Also the time at which a failover will be
    re-attempted is logged.
- additional changes from 2.8.9
  # UPGRADE URGENCY: LOW, only new features introduced, no bugs fixed.
  * [NEW] The HyperLogLog data structure. You can read more about
    it in this blog post. http://antirez.com/news/75
  * [NEW] The Sorted Set data type has now support for
    lexicographic range queries, check the new commands
    ZRANGEBYLEX, ZLEXCOUNT and ZREMRANGEBYLEX, which are documented
    at http://redis.io.

- additional changes from 2.8.8
  # UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH for Redis, LOW for Sentinel. There is a
    potentially critical bug fix causing data loss in Redis but it
    requires a combination of disk full and the use of the SHUTDOWN
    command.
  * [FIX] Fixed data loss when SHUTDOWN was used with a disk full
    condition.
  * [FIX] Fixed a memory leak in the SORT syntax error processing.
  * [FIX] When Sentinel down-after-milliseconds parameter is
    modified at runtime now it gets propagated to all the slaves
    and sentinel instances of the master.
  * [FIX] `install_server.sh` script finally fixed.
  * [FIX] Different fixes to maxclients handling.
  * [NEW] Sentinels are now able to send update messages in a
    peer-to-peer fashion even if no Redis instances are available.
    Now the Sentinel liveness property that the most updated
    configuration in a given partition is propagated to all the
    Sentinels is extended to partitions without reachable
    instances.
  * [NEW] Sentinel safety properties are now ensured in a
    crash-recovery system model since some state is persisted on
    disk before replying to other nodes, and reloaded at startup.
  * [NEW] Sentinel now uses CLIENT SETNAME so that it is easy to
    identify Sentinels using CLIENT LIST among other clients.
  * [NEW] Sentinel failure detection and reconnection code
    improved.
  * [NEW] Use all 24 bits (instead of 22) for the Redis objects LRU
    field.  Note that the new LRU algorithm using eviction pools
    was not backported from unstable for safery / code maturity
    concerns.
  * [NEW] Majory speedup for the INFO command (it is now 6 times
    faster).
  * [NEW] More Sentinel unit tests.
  * [NEW] New command DEBUG ERROR returns the specified error.
    Example: DEBUG ERROR "LOADING database". This is handy to write
    Redis client libraries unit tests.
  * [NEW] redis-cli now supports multi-line editing via updated
    linenoise lib.
  Thanks to Matt Stancliff and Jan-Erik Rediger for the work done
  in the context of this release.
- additional changes from 2.8.7
  # UPGRADE URGENCY: LOW for Redis, LOW for Sentinel. However this
    release adds new features so users may want to upgrade in order
    to exploit the new functionalities.
  * [FIX] Sometimes the absolute config file path was obtained in a
    wrong way.  This happened when there was a "dir" directive
    inside the config file and at the same time the configuration
    file was given as a relative path to redis-server or
    redis-sentinel executables.
  * [FIX] redis-cli: Automatically enter --slave mode when SYNC or
    PSYNC are called during an interactive session.
  * [FIX] Sentinel "IDONTKNOW" error removed as it does not made
    sense with the new Sentinel design. This error was actually a
    fix for a design error in the first implementation of Sentinel.
  * [FIX] Sentinel: added a missing exit() call to abort after
    config file checks at startup. This error was introduced with
    an improvement in a previous 2.8 release.
  * [FIX] BITCOUNT: fixed unaligned access causing issues in sparc
    and other archs not capable of dealing with unaligned accesses.
    This also makes the code faster in archs where unaligned
    accesses are allowed.
  * [FIX] Sentinel: better nodes fail over start time
    desynchronization to avoid split-brain during the voting
    process needed to get authorization to fail over. This means
    the system is less likely to need to retry and will fail over
    faster. No changes in behavior / correctness.
  * [FIX] Force INFO used_memory_peak to match peak memory. This
    generated some confusion among users even if it was not an
    actual bug.
  * [NEW] Sentinel unit tests and framework. More tests needed and
    units must be improved in order to have less false positives,
    but it is a start and features a debugging console that is
    useful to fix tests or to inspect bugs causing tests failures.
  * [NEW] New Sentinel events: +/-monitor and +set used to monitor
    when an instance to monitor is added or removed, or when a
    configuration is modified via SENTINEL SET.
  * [NEW] Redis-cli updated to use SCAN instead of random sampling
    via RANDOMKEY in order to implement --bigkeys feature. Moreover
    the implementation now supports pipelining and reports more
    information at the end of the scan. Much faster, much better. A
    special thank you to Michael Grunder for this improvement.
  * [NEW] redis-cli now supports a new --intrinsic-latency mode
    that is able to meter the latency of a system due to kernel /
    hypervisor.  How to use it is explained at
    http://redis.io/topics/latency.
  * [NEW] New command BITPOS: find first bit set or clear in a
    bitmap.
  * [NEW] CONFIG REWRITE calls are now logged.

Tue Mar  4 13:51:48 UTC 2014 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.8.6
  Redis 2.6 is mostly a strict subset of 2.8. However there are a 
  few things that you should be aware of:
  The following commands changed behavior:
    * SORT with ALPHA now sorts according to local collation locale
      if no STORE option is used.
    * ZADD/ZINCRBY are now able to accept a bigger range of values
      as valid scores, that is, all the values you may end having
      as a result of calling ZINCRBY multiple times.
    * Many errors are now prefixed by a more specific error code
      instead of the generic -ERR, for example -WRONGTYPE, -NOAUTH, ...
    * PUBLISH called inside Lua scripts is now correctly propagated
      to slaves.
  The following redis.conf and CONFIG GET / SET parameters changed:
    * logfile now uses the empty string in order to log to standard
      output, so 'logfile stdout' is now invalid, use 'logfile ""'
      instead.
  The following INFO fields changed format in a non-backward compatible way:
    * The list of slaves in INFO is now in field=value format.
  Replication:
    Redis 2.8 can be used as slave for Redis 2.6, but doing this is
    only a good idea for the short amount of time needed to upgrade
    your servers.  We suggest to update both master and slaves at
    about the same time.

- update to 2.6.14
  UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH because of the following two issues:
      * Lua scripting + Replication + AOF in slaves problem (see Issue #1164).
      * AOF + expires possible race condition (see Issue #1079).

  * [FIX] AOF bug: expire could be removed from key on AOF rewrite.
  * [FIX] Allow writes from scripts called by AOF loading in read-only slaves.
  * [FIX] Sentinel: parse new verison of INFO replication output correctly.
  * [NEW] Reset masterauth if an empty string is configured.

  and netcat runtime dependency (for init script?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 24 09:39:19 UTC 2011 - prusnak@opensuse.org

- updated to 2.2.7
  * Fixed bug #543-2 (the issue was reopened with a completely
    different report) that caused Redis to randomly crash on list
    push performed against lists with other clients blocked with BLPOP
    (or variants).
  (changes from 2.2.6)
  * Fixed bug #543. If you saw Redis instances crashing on List
    operations (only happening with a non-default max entry size
    ziplist setting in redis.conf) it was almost certainly this
    problem.
  * Fixed a bug with replication where SLAVEOF NO ONE caused
    a slave to close the connection with all its slaves.
  (changes from 2.2.5)
  * Fixed a crash occurring when loading an AOF containing
    the SPOP command.

Fri Apr 15 18:18:56 UTC 2011 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.2.4
  * Return value of OBJECT DEBUG against sorted sets fixed, now is
    "skiplist".
- additional changes from 2.2.3
  * Fixed issue #503. MONITOR + QUIT (and other combinations) could
    crash the server.
  * OBJECT command implemented. See http://redis.io/commands/object
  * Fixed a problem in redis-cli related to escapes in the form
    "\x..".
  * Fixed a minor memory leak in redis-cli
  * Saved RDB on SIGTERM on archs where it was not working properly.
- additional changes from 2.2.2
  * AOF file descriptor leak after the first rewrite fixed.
  * Return value of GETRANGE / SUBSTR is now an empty string if the
    interval specified is not valid, or the key does not exist. Was
    a null bulk reply before, but this is against the Redis way.
- fix the path to the log file in the conf patch to match the rest
  of the package
- created log dir
- changed home dir of the redis user from /var/run/redis to
  /var/lib/redis. the old home dir wasnt created anyway.

- update to version 1.2.6
  fixes two critical replication bugs, and a few improvements.
  - Fixed Issue 207
    (http://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=207) (broken
    replication with binary arguments not in the last position with
    the MSET command or any other command issued with new
    multi-bulk protocol)
  - Fixed Issue 174
    (http://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=174) (temp
    names collisions producing broken slave-side .rdb files)
  - Redis-cli backported from Redis master, with interactive mode,
    line editing via the linenoise library, auth ability, and much
    more.
  - ZRANGEBYSCORE now supports WITHSCORES as well (backported from
    master)
  - A simplified version of redis-stat (from redis tools) added.
- update to version 1.2.5
  fixes a replication bug: multiple slaves connecting to the same
  master could lead to random crashes or corruptions.
- use PROF parameter to pass in optflags

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  5 06:12:24 EST 2010 - pzb@suse.de

- Add BuildRoot to spec file to enable builds on old distros
- Patch initscript to use netcat instead of nc i
    (same command, different package)

- Update to Redis 1.2.3
  - The example init script was broken for a typo. Fixed.
  - Support for large files in 32 bit targets, very important when saving 
      very large databases or when using the Append Only File (when Redis 
      was compiled for 64 bit target there was no problem).
  - Now 'make 32bit' uses -m32 instead of Apple-specific -arch
  - Stack trace fixed for some Linux targets
