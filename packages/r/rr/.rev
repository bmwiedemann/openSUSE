    <comment>- Update to 5.6.0:
  * This release includes many bug fixes, improvements to system call coverage, and
    incremental performance improvements. Plus:
  * ARM Aarch64 support is now production quality (features implemented and
    tests pass), with some caveats. Recent iterations of Cortex and Neoverse (AWS
    Graviton) chips are supported, as is Apple M1 (when running Linux on bare metal
    M1). LDREX/STREX are not supported; userspace code must use Large System
    Extensions atomics only. Thanks to Yichao Yu and Keno Fischer for this work! We
    don't have prebuilt ARM packages yet.
  * Recording applications that use RDTSC heavily should be much faster than in
    previous versions of rr.
  * The rseq system call is now supported (via emulation).
-  Remove patches contained in new release:
  * rr-glib-234.patch
  * rr-map-elf-header.patch
  * rr-pthread-for-new-gcc.patch</comment>

    <comment>- Drop e32502d0.patch: 
  This was added due to a build fail related to:
  https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/issues/3485
  Which seems to have been a bug in gcc:
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109420
  But now it seems that it fails our build and without this patch
  it builds fine

- Add e32502d0.patch: Avoid having type members and enum members
  of Arch with the same name 

- Add 2248c85c.patch: Fix build on Tumbleweed with gcc13 by
  explicitly including cstdint</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 5.7.0:
  * This release includes many bug fixes, improvements to system
    call coverage, and incremental performance improvements.
    In particular, performance is improved for applications with
    thousands of threads (partly via the new WaitManager).
    A lot of rare intermittent bugs have been fixed, partly due
    to significant reworking of how unexpected task exits are handled.
- Remove upstream patches:
  * 2248c85c.patch
  * 2979c60e.patch</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 5.8.0:
  * This release contains many small bug fixes and updates for new
    syscalls and CPU microarchitectures.
  * There is some support for lldb now. rr replay -d lldb will
    launch LLDB and connect it to rr just like we do for gdb.
    LLDB does not expose reverse-execution commands so for now,
    you can only replay forwards. (Of course you can still replay a
    recording as many times as you need to.)</comment>

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to 5.9.0:
  * As usual there are lots of small improvements and bugfixes.
    The main feature of this release is that in kernels &gt;= 6.10,
    rr now works with perf_event_paranoid set to 2, which is the
    default for most distributions. This requires a kernel bug fix
    by Kyle Huey that only shipped in 6.10. rr is slightly more
    efficient with perf_event_paranoid set to 1, but that won't
    matter in practice.</comment>
