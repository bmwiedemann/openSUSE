    <comment>- Update to 5.6.0:
  * This release includes many bug fixes, improvements to system call coverage, and
    incremental performance improvements. Plus:
  * ARM Aarch64 support is now production quality (features implemented and
    tests pass), with some caveats. Recent iterations of Cortex and Neoverse (AWS
    Graviton) chips are supported, as is Apple M1 (when running Linux on bare metal
    M1). LDREX/STREX are not supported; userspace code must use Large System
    Extensions atomics only. Thanks to Yichao Yu and Keno Fischer for this work! We
    don't have prebuilt ARM packages yet.
  * Recording applications that use RDTSC heavily should be much faster than in
    previous versions of rr.
  * The rseq system call is now supported (via emulation).
-  Remove patches contained in new release:
  * rr-glib-234.patch
  * rr-map-elf-header.patch
  * rr-pthread-for-new-gcc.patch</comment>
