    <comment>- Update to 5.6.0:
  * This release includes many bug fixes, improvements to system call coverage, and
    incremental performance improvements. Plus:
  * ARM Aarch64 support is now production quality (features implemented and
    tests pass), with some caveats. Recent iterations of Cortex and Neoverse (AWS
    Graviton) chips are supported, as is Apple M1 (when running Linux on bare metal
    M1). LDREX/STREX are not supported; userspace code must use Large System
    Extensions atomics only. Thanks to Yichao Yu and Keno Fischer for this work! We
    don't have prebuilt ARM packages yet.
  * Recording applications that use RDTSC heavily should be much faster than in
    previous versions of rr.
  * The rseq system call is now supported (via emulation).
-  Remove patches contained in new release:
  * rr-glib-234.patch
  * rr-map-elf-header.patch
  * rr-pthread-for-new-gcc.patch</comment>

    <comment>- Drop e32502d0.patch: 
  This was added due to a build fail related to:
  https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/issues/3485
  Which seems to have been a bug in gcc:
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109420
  But now it seems that it fails our build and without this patch
  it builds fine

- Add e32502d0.patch: Avoid having type members and enum members
  of Arch with the same name 

- Add 2248c85c.patch: Fix build on Tumbleweed with gcc13 by
  explicitly including cstdint</comment>
