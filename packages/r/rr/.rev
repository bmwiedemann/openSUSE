    <comment>- Update to 5.3.0:
  * This is primarily a maintenance release.
    There are many bug fixes, improvements to system call coverage,
	and incremental performance improvements.
  * The rr sources, rr buildid and rr traceinfo commands have been
    added to make it easier for external tools to work with rr
	traces. rr ls has been added to improve management of traces.
- Remove:
  * rr-5.2.0-cpp14.patch
  * rr-5.2.0-python3.patch
  * rr-5.2.0-remove-ucontext.patch

    <comment>- Update to 5.4.0:
  * As usual there are many bug fixes, improvements to system call
    coverage, and incremental performance improvements.
  * AMD Zen CPUs are now supported, with some caveats.
  * There is experimental support for ARM AArch64 platforms that
    avoid the STREX instruction.
  * rr record has a new option --nested=detach which lets nested
    rr recordings run &quot;detached&quot; to create a separate recording.</comment>
