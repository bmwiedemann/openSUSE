Tue Sep  9 21:02:32 UTC 2025 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- fix build, add rr-5.9.0-fix-glibc-2-42.patch from upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 14 08:25:25 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 5.9.0:
  * As usual there are lots of small improvements and bugfixes.
    The main feature of this release is that in kernels >= 6.10,
    rr now works with perf_event_paranoid set to 2, which is the
    default for most distributions. This requires a kernel bug fix
    by Kyle Huey that only shipped in 6.10. rr is slightly more
    efficient with perf_event_paranoid set to 1, but that won't
    matter in practice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 21 05:59:29 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 5.8.0:
  * This release contains many small bug fixes and updates for new
    syscalls and CPU microarchitectures.
  * There is some support for lldb now. rr replay -d lldb will
    launch LLDB and connect it to rr just like we do for gdb.
    LLDB does not expose reverse-execution commands so for now,
    you can only replay forwards. (Of course you can still replay a
    recording as many times as you need to.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 12 10:42:41 UTC 2024 - pgajdos@suse.com

- remove dependency on /usr/bin/python3 using
  %python3_fix_shebang macro, [bsc#1212476]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 07:14:20 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 5.7.0:
  * This release includes many bug fixes, improvements to system
    call coverage, and incremental performance improvements.
    In particular, performance is improved for applications with
    thousands of threads (partly via the new WaitManager).
    A lot of rare intermittent bugs have been fixed, partly due
    to significant reworking of how unexpected task exits are handled.
- Remove upstream patches:
  * 2248c85c.patch
  * 2979c60e.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 24 08:05:13 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Drop e32502d0.patch: 
  This was added due to a build fail related to:
  https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/issues/3485
  Which seems to have been a bug in gcc:
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109420
  But now it seems that it fails our build and without this patch
  it builds fine

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 12 07:35:32 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Add e32502d0.patch: Avoid having type members and enum members
  of Arch with the same name 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 30 17:21:00 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Add 2248c85c.patch: Fix build on Tumbleweed with gcc13 by
  explicitly including cstdint

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 31 14:09:34 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add 2979c60e.patch: Avoid creating a struct with elements after
  ethtool_sset_info's variable-length-array.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 16 07:12:55 UTC 2022 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- filelist fix for aarch64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  8 06:59:55 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 5.6.0:
  * This release includes many bug fixes, improvements to system call coverage, and
    incremental performance improvements. Plus:
  * ARM Aarch64 support is now production quality (features implemented and
    tests pass), with some caveats. Recent iterations of Cortex and Neoverse (AWS
    Graviton) chips are supported, as is Apple M1 (when running Linux on bare metal
    M1). LDREX/STREX are not supported; userspace code must use Large System
    Extensions atomics only. Thanks to Yichao Yu and Keno Fischer for this work! We
    don't have prebuilt ARM packages yet.
  * Recording applications that use RDTSC heavily should be much faster than in
    previous versions of rr.
  * The rseq system call is now supported (via emulation).
-  Remove patches contained in new release:
  * rr-glib-234.patch
  * rr-map-elf-header.patch
  * rr-pthread-for-new-gcc.patch

Mon Sep 20 14:08:36 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

    coverage, and incremental performance improvements.
  * AMD Zen CPUs are now supported, with some caveats.
  * There is experimental support for ARM AArch64 platforms that
    avoid the STREX instruction.
  * rr record has a new option --nested=detach which lets nested
    rr recordings run "detached" to create a separate recording.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 18 11:56:00 UTC 2019 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 5.3.0:
  * This is primarily a maintenance release.
    There are many bug fixes, improvements to system call coverage,
	and incremental performance improvements.
  * The rr sources, rr buildid and rr traceinfo commands have been
    added to make it easier for external tools to work with rr
	traces. rr ls has been added to improve management of traces.

- Update to 5.0.0:
  Introduction of Cap'n Proto to stabilize the recording format.
  Recordings created in this rr release should be replayable in any
  future rr release.
  New rr pack command makes recordings self-contained.
  Recordings can be made on one machine and replayed on a different
  machine by trapping CPUID instructions when supported on the replay
  machine.
  Brotli compression for smaller traces and lower recording overhead.
  rr replay command line argument -- can be followed by any
  number of arguments to be passed to the debugger.
  rr now chooses replay as the default subcommand if
  the first argument is a directory.
  Performance improvements.
  Syscall support expanded.
  Many bugs fixed.
