- updated to version 7.0.3

  *   Allow relative redirects when `raise_on_open_redirects` is enabled.

      *Tom Hughes*

  *   Fix `authenticate_with_http_basic` to allow for missing password.

      Before Rails 7.0 it was possible to handle basic authentication with only a username.

      ```ruby
      authenticate_with_http_basic do |token, _|
        ApiClient.authenticate(token)
      end
      ```

      This ability is restored.

      *Jean Boussier*

  *   Fix `content_security_policy` returning invalid directives.

      Directives such as `self`, `unsafe-eval` and few others were not
      single quoted when the directive was the result of calling a lambda
      returning an array.

      ```ruby
      content_security_policy do |policy|
        policy.frame_ancestors lambda { [:self, "https://example.com"] }
      end
      ```

      With this fix the policy generated from above will now be valid.

      *Edouard Chin*

  *   Fix `skip_forgery_protection` to run without raising an error if forgery
      protection has not been enabled / `verify_authenticity_token` is not a
      defined callback.

      This fix prevents the Rails 7.0 Welcome Page (`/`) from raising an
      `ArgumentError` if `default_protect_from_forgery` is false.

      *Brad Trick*

  *   Fix `ActionController::Live` to copy the IsolatedExecutionState in the ephemeral thread.

      Since its inception `ActionController::Live` has been copying thread local variables
      to keep things such as `CurrentAttributes` set from middlewares working in the controller action.

      With the introduction of `IsolatedExecutionState` in 7.0, some of that global state was lost in
      `ActionController::Live` controllers.

      *Jean Boussier*

  *   Fix setting `trailing_slash: true` in route definition.

      ```ruby
      get '/test' => "test#index", as: :test, trailing_slash: true

      test_path() # => "/test/"
      ```
