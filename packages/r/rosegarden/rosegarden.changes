    segment.
    Fix Insert Controller Sequence (Bug #1478) Previously, in the
    NotationView, adding a controller sequence where there were no
    matching controller sequences would reset the start time of the

    - Fix sysex import dialog black-on-black problem.

      signature changes.
    - Fix a refresh bug introduced in r13273 and present in 13.06
      involving deleting contemporaneous segments on a track. This
      may have broken CompositionView refresh in other cases as
      well.
    - Fix UTF8 in track and segment names.
    - Fix the update of notation editors when a track name is
      changed.
    - Fix a "No such key" bug in the key signature dialog.
    - Fix MIDI thru latency issue when recording.
    - Fix repeating segments so they function when overlapping on
      one track.
    - Fix tuplet numbers drawing in black when they should be other
      colors.
    - Fix several interconnected bugs related to MIDI export that
      were causing a variety of problems due to issues with bad
      event ordering and the introduction of spurious controllers.
    - Fix problems when recording past the end of the composition.
    - Fix various crashes when pasting.
    - Fix crash when attempting to import programs from .sfArk
      files (format not supported).
  + New Features:
    - Selection event filter can select rests.
    - Selection event filter can select either performance or
      notation duration.
    - LilyPond export converts a ''(c)'' or a ''(C)'' in the
      copyright header to a proper symbol automatically.
    - New interpretation toolbar for the notation editor
      streamlines the ''**Adjust -> Interpret**'' process.
    - New option to allow LilyPond to export fingerings inside the
      staff (can improve collision resolution).
    - New option to instruct Rosegarden not to start JACK
      automatically at startup, allowing you to control this
      behavior without having to put garbage in your ~/.jackdrc
      file.
    - Support LilyPond 2.14.
    - Added a appdata file.
- Changes from version 13.06:
  + Bugs Fixed:
    - Fix disappearing ties in notation editor.
    - Program changes are now sent on channels for tracks that are
      armed when going into record.
    - CPU usage reduced by almost 50% when recording MIDI.
    - The range editing commands no longer mess up markers.
    - Fixed an internal leak in the channel allocator.
    - Fixed a crash on paste bug, while revealing other related
      problems that remain to be fixed.
    - Fixed latency compensation in subgroups through a mysterious
      mechanism that seems to work.
    - Fixed a subtle bug involving the drawing of track dividers
      and vertical scrolling.
    - Changing note durations works correctly across barlines. So
      does adding dots to notes.
    - Menu items have a somewhat more consistent style.
    - Certain crashes related to Paste commands shouldn't happen
      any more.
    - The tempo dialog now defaults more sensibly to replacing the
      most recent tempo.
    - Now when you change staffs in the notation editor (with Next
      Staff Down, etc) Rosegarden chooses the next staff more
      sensibly.
    - When you open multiple segments in the notation editor,
      Rosegarden chooses a starting staff more sensibly.
    - Range commands such as edit -> Cut Range now don't split
      segments. Previously only Insert Range kept segments intact.
    - Range commands also try to keep linked segments linked
      together when possible.
  + New Features:
    - Additional work and improvements on the pitchbend sequence
      dialog.
    - Controllers are now easier to place and arrange thru the
      Notation -> Adjust -> controllers -> Insert Controller
      Sequence... menu. The dialog isn't new but it is clearer than
      before and gives you more control over what is placed.
    - "Move to Staff Above" and "Move to Staff Below" now have
      variants that ask what type of pasting to do; formerly it was
      always notation-style pasting.
    - It is now easier to create beat tracks, ie tracks that have a
      note on each beat for use with FitToBeatsCommand and/or
      groove quantize. See [[how_to_make_beat_tracks]].
    - For those users (both of you) who use Segment -> Expand Block
      Chord Segments by Figuration, there is now support for
      figurations without parameter chords.
    - Also for those who use Segment -> Expand Block Chord Segments
      by Figuration, there is Segment -> Update all Figurations,
      which tracks down all regions previously generated from
      figurations and updates them.
    - Ornaments can now be [[how_to_edit_ornaments|inspected and
      edited]] inline, as notation.  Formerly they were only
      available in the Event List Editor.
    - If you want to try to use Rosegarden as a true layered
      editor, ornaments whose trigger consists of tied notes can
      even be set so that only certain sections play.
    - Range commands and other commands that move segments timewise
      are faster now.

- Update to version 11.02, rosegarden-gcc46fix.patch is merged.
- Upstream bug Fixes: *Track numbers are no longer cut off

   notes as though it were a single unit, which fixes several
   problems that have been outstanding since as far back as 2002
  *Resizing a segment via click and drag near the edge or with the
   resize tool now leaves that segment as the selected segment
  *When attempting to select a note by clicking toward the extreme
   edges of the note head, it is less likely that you will move the
   note instead of merely selecting it.
  *Insertion / Playback pointer correctly advances in Notation
   editor when entered notes are split and tied.
  *Progress dialogs tweaked to fine tune their behavior.
  *Alt+PgUp and Alt+PgDown now highlight the events in a segment in
   Notation view consistently.
- New Features: *The matrix editor represents tied notes with a
   different fill pattern
  *The split-and-tie long notes option has been made the factory
   default once more, in light of the vastly improved handling of
   ties in the matrix and notation editors.
