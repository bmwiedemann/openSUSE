Sun Dec 22 21:34:10 UTC 2013 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 13.10:
  + Bugs Fixed:
    - Pitch Bend Sequence Dialog, number of steps must be positive.
    - Fix disconnected move up staff / move down staff commands.
    - Fix sysex import dialog black-on-black problem.
    - Fix for #1372 Rests of new segments don't adapt to time
      signature changes.
    - Fix a refresh bug introduced in r13273 and present in 13.06
      involving deleting contemporaneous segments on a track. This
      may have broken CompositionView refresh in other cases as
      well.
    - Fix UTF8 in track and segment names.
    - Fix the update of notation editors when a track name is
      changed.
    - Fix a "No such key" bug in the key signature dialog.
    - Fix MIDI thru latency issue when recording.
    - Fix repeating segments so they function when overlapping on
      one track.
    - Fix tuplet numbers drawing in black when they should be other
      colors.
    - Fix several interconnected bugs related to MIDI export that
      were causing a variety of problems due to issues with bad
      event ordering and the introduction of spurious controllers.
    - Fix problems when recording past the end of the composition.
    - Fix various crashes when pasting.
    - Fix crash when attempting to import programs from .sfArk
      files (format not supported).
  + New Features:
    - Selection event filter can select rests.
    - Selection event filter can select either performance or
      notation duration.
    - LilyPond export converts a ''(c)'' or a ''(C)'' in the
      copyright header to a proper symbol automatically.
    - New interpretation toolbar for the notation editor
      streamlines the ''**Adjust -> Interpret**'' process.
    - New option to allow LilyPond to export fingerings inside the
      staff (can improve collision resolution).
    - New option to instruct Rosegarden not to start JACK
      automatically at startup, allowing you to control this
      behavior without having to put garbage in your ~/.jackdrc
      file.
    - Support LilyPond 2.14.
    - Added a appdata file.
- Changes from version 13.06:
  + Bugs Fixed:
    - Fix disappearing ties in notation editor.
    - Program changes are now sent on channels for tracks that are
      armed when going into record.
    - CPU usage reduced by almost 50% when recording MIDI.
    - The range editing commands no longer mess up markers.
    - Fixed an internal leak in the channel allocator.
    - Fixed a crash on paste bug, while revealing other related
      problems that remain to be fixed.
    - Fixed latency compensation in subgroups through a mysterious
      mechanism that seems to work.
    - Fixed a subtle bug involving the drawing of track dividers
      and vertical scrolling.
    - Changing note durations works correctly across barlines. So
      does adding dots to notes.
    - Menu items have a somewhat more consistent style.
    - Certain crashes related to Paste commands shouldn't happen
      any more.
    - The tempo dialog now defaults more sensibly to replacing the
      most recent tempo.
    - Now when you change staffs in the notation editor (with Next
      Staff Down, etc) Rosegarden chooses the next staff more
      sensibly.
    - When you open multiple segments in the notation editor,
      Rosegarden chooses a starting staff more sensibly.
    - Range commands such as edit -> Cut Range now don't split
      segments. Previously only Insert Range kept segments intact.
    - Range commands also try to keep linked segments linked
      together when possible.
  + New Features:
    - Additional work and improvements on the pitchbend sequence
      dialog.
    - Controllers are now easier to place and arrange thru the
      Notation -> Adjust -> controllers -> Insert Controller
      Sequence... menu. The dialog isn't new but it is clearer than
      before and gives you more control over what is placed.
    - "Move to Staff Above" and "Move to Staff Below" now have
      variants that ask what type of pasting to do; formerly it was
      always notation-style pasting.
    - It is now easier to create beat tracks, ie tracks that have a
      note on each beat for use with FitToBeatsCommand and/or
      groove quantize. See [[how_to_make_beat_tracks]].
    - For those users (both of you) who use Segment -> Expand Block
      Chord Segments by Figuration, there is now support for
      figurations without parameter chords.
    - Also for those who use Segment -> Expand Block Chord Segments
      by Figuration, there is Segment -> Update all Figurations,
      which tracks down all regions previously generated from
      figurations and updates them.
    - Ornaments can now be [[how_to_edit_ornaments|inspected and
      edited]] inline, as notation.  Formerly they were only
      available in the Event List Editor.
    - If you want to try to use Rosegarden as a true layered
      editor, ornaments whose trigger consists of tied notes can
      even be set so that only certain sections play.
    - Range commands and other commands that move segments timewise
      are faster now.

- Update to version 11.02, rosegarden-gcc46fix.patch is merged.
- Upstream bug Fixes: *Track numbers are no longer cut off
  *The notation and matrix editors now treat a series of tied
   notes as though it were a single unit, which fixes several
   problems that have been outstanding since as far back as 2002
  *Resizing a segment via click and drag near the edge or with the
   resize tool now leaves that segment as the selected segment
  *When attempting to select a note by clicking toward the extreme
   edges of the note head, it is less likely that you will move the
   note instead of merely selecting it.
  *Insertion / Playback pointer correctly advances in Notation
   editor when entered notes are split and tied.
  *Progress dialogs tweaked to fine tune their behavior.
  *Alt+PgUp and Alt+PgDown now highlight the events in a segment in
   Notation view consistently.
- New Features: *The matrix editor represents tied notes with a
   different fill pattern
  *The split-and-tie long notes option has been made the factory
   default once more, in light of the vastly improved handling of
   ties in the matrix and notation editors.

   propagate to the stable 10_10 branch.
