  <title>Ruby Make</title>
  <description>This package contains Rake, a simple ruby build program with
capabilities similar to make.

Rake has the following features:

* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
   standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
   syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

* Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.

*  Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about
   manipulating file names and paths.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier.
