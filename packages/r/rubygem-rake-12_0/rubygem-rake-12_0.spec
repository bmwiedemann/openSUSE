%description
Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are
specified in standard Ruby syntax.
Rake has the following features:
* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard
Ruby syntax.
No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab
or a space?)
* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.
* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file
names and paths.
* Supports parallel execution of tasks.
