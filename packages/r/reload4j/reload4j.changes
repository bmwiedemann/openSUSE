- Update to upstream version 1.2.25
  * Given that some users encountered problems with the changes
    made in version 1.2.24, the thread context class loader (TCCL)
    is now tried first under all JDK versions unless the
    "log4j.ignoreTCL" system property is set to true. This was
    intended behavior all along except that is was disabled in
    JDK 9 and later due to a coding error.
- Update to upstream version 1.2.24
  * The loadClass and getResource methods in the Loader class are
    used to search for resources and to load classes, typically
    appenders or layouts. In this release, only the class loader
    that loaded the Loader class itself is used. The thread context
    class loader (TCCL) is no longer used. In previous releases,
    this was already the case when running under JDK 9 and later
    but not under JDK 8 or earlier. The change provides both more
    consistent and also simpler behavior. It should be be
    transparent to users.
- Update to upstream version 1.2.23
  * Added Automatic-Module-Name entry set to ch.qos.reload4j in
    the MANIFEST.MF file. This should help in including reload4j
    as a named dependency in Jigsaw modular projects.
- Update to upstream version 1.2.22
  * Fixed a newly discovered XXE vector vulnerability reported
    against Chainsaw.
- Update to upstream version 1.2.21
  * The binary compatibility issue between earlier versions of
    reload4j and slf4j-log4j12 has been fixed. Although it is
    recommended that you use slf4j-reload4j as the preferred adapter
    for the slf4j/reload4j combination, with reload4j version 1.2.21
    and later you can freely mix any version of slf4j-log4j12, if
    you have to.
- Modified patch:
  * reload4j-java1.patch
    + rediff to changed context

- Update to upstream version 1.2.20
  * For enabled logging statements, the performance of iterating
    on appenders attached to a logger has been significantly
    improved.

- Added patch:
  * reload4j-java1.patch
    + Some projects using log4j12 expect the org.apache.log4j.MDC
      class to have internal boolean variable java1. We add it
      there just to avoid runtime incompatibilities as a log4j12
      drop-in replacement.
- Add Provides and Obsoletes to the javadoc package in order to
  transition smoothly out of log4j12-javadoc and log4j12-manual
