Version 1.62.1 (2022-07-19)
==========================

Rust 1.62.1 addresses a few recent regressions in the compiler and standard
library, and also mitigates a CPU vulnerability on Intel SGX.

* [The compiler fixed unsound function coercions involving `impl Trait` return types.][98608]
* [The compiler fixed an incremental compilation bug with `async fn` lifetimes.][98890]
* [Windows added a fallback for overlapped I/O in synchronous reads and writes.][98950]
* [The `x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx` target added a mitigation for the
  MMIO stale data vulnerability][98126], advisory [INTEL-SA-00615].

Version 1.62.0 (2022-06-30)
==========================

Language
--------

- [Stabilize `#[derive(Default)]` on enums with a `#[default]` variant][94457]
- [Teach flow sensitive checks that visibly uninhabited call expressions never return][93313]
- [Fix constants not getting dropped if part of a diverging expression][94775]
- [Support unit struct/enum variant in destructuring assignment][95380]
- [Remove mutable_borrow_reservation_conflict lint and allow the code pattern][96268]

Compiler
--------

- [linker: Stop using whole-archive on dependencies of dylibs][96436]
- [Make `unaligned_references` lint deny-by-default][95372]
  This lint is also a future compatibility lint, and is expected to eventually
  become a hard error.
- [Only add codegen backend to dep info if -Zbinary-dep-depinfo is used][93969]
- [Reject `#[thread_local]` attribute on non-static items][95006]
- [Add tier 3 `aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm` and `x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm` targets\*][94872]
- [Implement a lint to warn about unused macro rules][96150]
- [Promote `x86_64-unknown-none` target to Tier 2\*][95705]

\* Refer to Rust's [platform support page][platform-support-doc] for more
   information on Rust's tiered platform support.

Libraries
---------

- [Windows: Use a pipe relay for chaining pipes][95841]
- [Replace Linux Mutex and Condvar with futex based ones.][95035]
- [Replace RwLock by a futex based one on Linux][95801]
- [std: directly use pthread in UNIX parker implementation][96393]

Stabilized APIs
---------------

- [`bool::then_some`]
- [`f32::total_cmp`]
- [`f64::total_cmp`]
- [`Stdin::lines`]
- [`windows::CommandExt::raw_arg`]
- [`impl<T: Default> Default for AssertUnwindSafe<T>`]
- [`From<Rc<str>> for Rc<[u8]>`][rc-u8-from-str]
- [`From<Arc<str>> for Arc<[u8]>`][arc-u8-from-str]
- [`FusedIterator for EncodeWide`]
- [RDM intrinsics on aarch64][stdarch/1285]

Clippy
------

- [Create clippy lint against unexpectedly late drop for temporaries in match scrutinee expressions][94206]

Cargo
-----

- Added the `cargo add` command for adding dependencies to `Cargo.toml` from
  the command-line.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-add.html)
- Package ID specs now support `name@version` syntax in addition to the
  previous `name:version` to align with the behavior in `cargo add` and other
  tools. `cargo install` and `cargo yank` also now support this syntax so the
  version does not need to passed as a separate flag.
- The `git` and `registry` directories in Cargo's home directory (usually
  `~/.cargo`) are now marked as cache directories so that they are not
  included in backups or content indexing (on Windows).
- Added automatic `@` argfile support, which will use "response files" if the
  command-line to `rustc` exceeds the operating system's limit.

Compatibility Notes
-------------------

- `cargo test` now passes `--target` to `rustdoc` if the specified target is
  the same as the host target.
  [#10594](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10594)
- [rustdoc: doctests are now run on unexported `macro_rules!` macros, matching other private items][96630]
- [rustdoc: Remove .woff font files][96279]
- [Enforce Copy bounds for repeat elements while considering lifetimes][95819]
- [Windows: Fix potentinal unsoundness by aborting if `File` reads or writes cannot
  complete synchronously][95469].
