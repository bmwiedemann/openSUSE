%description
rofi is a popup window switcher roughly based on "superswitcher",
requiring only xlib and pango. This version started off as a clone of
simpleswitcher, the version from Sean Pringle. Rofi developed extra
features, like a run dialog, SSH launcher and can act as a drop-in
dmenu replacement.
