  ### unreleased
  
  ### 4.8.0 - 2021-04-29
  
  * enhancements
    * Devise now enables the upgrade of OmniAuth 2+. Previously Devise would raise an error if you'd try to upgrade. Please note that OmniAuth 2 is considered a security upgrade and recommended to everyone. You can read more about the details (and possible necessary changes to your app as part of the upgrade) in [their release notes](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/releases/tag/v2.0.0). [Devise's OmniAuth Overview wiki](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/OmniAuth:-Overview) was also updated to cover OmniAuth 2.0 requirements.
      - Note that the upgrade required Devise shared links that initiate the OmniAuth flow to be changed to `method: :post`, which is now a requirement for OmniAuth, part of the security improvement. If you have copied and customized the Devise shared links partial to your app, or if you have other links in your app that initiate the OmniAuth flow, they will have to be updated to use `method: :post`, or changed to use buttons (e.g. `button_to`) to work with OmniAuth 2. (if you're using links with `method: :post`, make sure your app has `rails-ujs` or `jquery-ujs` included in order for these links to work properly.)
      - As part of the OmniAuth 2.0 upgrade you might also need to add the [`omniauth-rails_csrf_protection`](https://github.com/cookpad/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection) gem to your app if you don't have it already. (and you don't want to roll your own code to verify requests.) Check the OmniAuth v2 release notes for more info.
    * Introduce `Lockable#reset_failed_attempts!` model method to reset failed attempts counter to 0 after the user signs in.
      - This logic existed inside the lockable warden hook and is triggered automatically after the user signs in. The new model method is an extraction to allow you to override it in the application to implement things like switching to a write database if you're using the new multi-DB infrastructure from Rails for example, similar to how it's already possible with `Trackable#update_tracked_fields!`.
    * Add support for Ruby 3.
    * Add support for Rails 6.1.
    * Move CI to GitHub Actions.
  
  * deprecations
    * `Devise::Models::Authenticatable::BLACKLIST_FOR_SERIALIZATION` is deprecated in favor of `Devise::Models::Authenticatable::UNSAFE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_SERIALIZATION` (@hanachin)

  ### 4.2.0 - 2016-07-01

    * Remove the deprecated `Devise::ParameterSanitizer` API from Devise 3.
      Please use the `#permit` and `#sanitize` methods over `#for`.
    * Remove the deprecated OmniAuth URL helpers. Use the fully qualified helpers
      (`user_facebook_omniauth_authorize_path`) over the scope based helpers
      ( `user_omniauth_authorize_path(:facebook)`).
    * Remove the `Devise.bcrypt` method, use `Devise::Encryptor.digest` instead.
    * Remove the `Devise::Models::Confirmable#confirm!` method, use `confirm` instead.
    * Remove the `Devise::Models::Recoverable#reset_password!` method, use `reset_password` instead.

  * bug fixes
    * Fix an `ActionDispatch::IllegalStateError` when testing controllers with Rails 5 rc 2(by @hamadata).
    * Use `ActiveSupport.on_load` hooks to include Devise on `ActiveRecord` and `Mongoid`,
      avoiding autoloading these constants too soon (by @lucasmazza, @rafaelfranca).
  * enhancements
    * Display the minimum password length on `registrations/edit` view (by @Yanchek99).
    * You can disable Devise's routes reloading on boot by through the `reload_routes = false` config.
      This can reduce the time taken to boot the application but it might trigger
      some errors if you application (mostly your controllers) requires that
      Devise mappings be loaded during boot time (by @sidonath).
    * Added `Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers` to bypass the sign in process using
      Warden test API (by @lucasmazza).
    * Define `inspect` in `Devise::Models::Authenticatable` to help ensure password hashes
      aren't included in exceptions or otherwise accidentally serialized (by @tkrajcar).
    * Add missing support of `Rails.application.config.action_controller.relative_url_root` (by @kosdiamantis).
  * deprecations
    * `Devise::TestHelpers` is deprecated in favor of `Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers`
      (by @lucasmazza).
    * The `sign_in` test helper has changed to use keyword arguments when passing
      a scope. `sign_in :admin, users(:alice)` should be rewritten as
      `sign_in users(:alice), scope: :admin` (by @lucasmazza).
    * The option `bypass` of `Devise::Controllers::SignInOut#sign_in` method is
      deprecated in favor of `Devise::Controllers::SignInOut#bypass_sign_in`
      method (by @ulissesalmeida).

  * backwards incompatible changes
    * Do not store confirmation, unlock and reset password tokens directly in the database. This means tokens previously stored in the database are no longer valid.

- updated to version 3.0.1
 * enhancements
   * Add after_confirmation callback
 
 * bug fix
   * When using rails 3.2, the generator adds 'attr_accessible' to the model (by @jcoyne)
   * Clean up CSRF token after authentication (by @homakov). Notice this change will clean up the CSRF Token after authentication 
    (sign in, sign up, etc). So if you are using AJAX for such features, you will need to fetch a new CSRF token from the server.
