  <title>Tool to read the monitor details directly from the monitor</title>
  <description>read-edid is a pair of tools (originally by John Fremlin) for reading the EDID from a monitor. It should work with most monitors made since 1996 (except for newer ones with 256-byte EDID's - WiP), assuming the video card supports the standard read commands (most do).read-edid is a set of two tools - get-edid, which gets the raw edid information from the monitor, and parse-edid, which turns the raw binary information into an XF86Config-compatible monitor section.</description>
