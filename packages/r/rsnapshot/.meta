  <title>Backup program using hardlinks</title>
  <description>rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility for making backups of local
and remote systems. Using rsync and hard links, it is possible to keep
multiple, full backups instantly available. The disk space required is
just a little more than the space of one full backup, plus
incrementals. Depending on your configuration, it is quite possible to
set up in just a few minutes. Files can be restored by the users who
own them, without the root user getting involved. There are no tapes to
change, so once it's set up, you may never need to think about it
again.</description>
