 # This is a simple shell script to backup a PostgreSQL database with rsnapshot.
 #
 # The assumption is that this will be invoked from rsnapshot. Also, since it
-# will run unattended, the user that runs rsnapshot (probably root) should have
-# a .pgpass file in their home directory that contains the password for the
-# postgres user. For example:
-#
-# /root/.pgpass (chmod 0600)
-#   *:*:*:postgres:thepassword
+# will run unattended, the user that runs rsnapshot (probably root) must su
+# to the postgres user.
 #
 # This script simply needs to dump a file into the current working directory.
 # rsnapshot handles everything else.
