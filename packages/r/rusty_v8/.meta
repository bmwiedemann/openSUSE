<package name="rusty_v8" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title> V8 javascript bindings for Rust </title>
  <description>Do not install. Only used as the first stage for building deno, and for development/debugging purposes.

Deno offers an alternate build, where the v8 engine is referenced through a static binary dump.

This package exists just to test rusty_v8 in isolation. It will generate binaries that include full debug symbols/tables.

Users should refer to the deno package for an integrated build without development symbols.</description>
