Sat Dec 17 14:46:45 UTC 2022 - Yunhe Guo <i@guoyunhe.me>

- Update to version 1.14.0
  * AUDIO/COREAUDIO/APPLE: Allow coreaudio3 driver to work with audio devices that have 2 or more output channels
  * CHEEVOS: Fix construction of Cheevos badge path
  * CLI: Fixed not getting any output when running --version or --features without --verbose
  * CLI: Fixed crash when running empty - parameter (it proceeded to content loading)
  * CLI: Reformatted --features to require less rows and to be more consistent
  * CLI: Added -V shorthand for --version
  * CLI: Tab removal + whitespace nits
  * CONFIG/MIDI: Prevent MIDI startup error with old configurations
  * DATABASE/EXPLORE/VIEW: Bugfix - RGUI did not clear thumbnail on non-playlist items such as Save and Delete
    menu_explore_get_entry_playlist_index() returns -1 on invalid entries, but the variable where it was stored was unsigned
  * DATABASE/EXPLORE/VIEW: Bugfix - XMB+Ozone cleared thumbnail in Quick Menu when navigating away from Run
  * FASTFORWARD: Restore framelimit on fastforward toggle. Fast-forward was broken after toggling vrr_runloop off, since it will force frame limit to 1.0 (even on every frame) and never restores it. So let's make sure the wanted ratio is applied when toggling FF (Fastforward).
  * FFMPEG CORE: Fix runtime error in FFmpeg core when build with FFmpeg n5.1.2 and OpenGL ES
  * GFX/VIDEO FILTERS: (picoscale_256x_320x240) Added snn function to upscale Fuse (ZX Spectrum) core borderless output to 320x240. ZX Spectrum resolution of 256x192 was previously unsupported.
  * HOTKEYS: Further reorder internal hotkey items for consistency and removed SEND_DEBUG_INFO, OVERLAY_NEXT and OSK from visible hotkey bind list. "Send Debug Info" stuff is removed as much as possible without breakage due to translation files.
  * INPUT/AUTOCONFIG: Disable 'pause on controller disconnect' by default - was enabled by default on 1.13.0
  * INPUT/MENU: Device Index menu refactor
  * INPUT/OVERLAY: Fix analog drift blocking touch input (could occur on overlay_next if physical inputs shown on overlay)
  * INPUT/OVERLAY: Fix overlay_next buttons lighting up in unison
  * INPUT/OVERLAY: Skip meta keys in input_overlay_add_inputs (not supported by input_state_internal)
  * LEAPFROG: Add Leapfrog (LFx000) Target
  * LOCALIZATION: Updates
  * LOCALIZATION/INPUT/IME/MENU/ONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Extended IME and Korean OSK
  * MENU: Cleanup of help texts
  * MENU: Allow toggling info off with the same button
  * MENU: Allow menu wallpaper/background reset. Let's also remove the current wallpaper from the screen when pressing Start.
  * MENU: Null driver shows with different color (Added for all menus the ability to show "disabled" items with a muted color)
  * MENU/DRIVERS: Menu driver first, Audio Resampler removed because it is enough to exist under audio settings
  * MENU/INPUT: Moved "Confirm Quit" to Input menu
  * MENU/INPUT/HOTKEYS: Input hotkey menu completely overhauled to keep related entries together, and also adjusted some labels and sublabels
  * MENU/OVERLAY: Fix overlays behind menu without core running. "Show Overlay Behind Menu" is currently broken with Ozone and XMB (with any other color theme than Plain) when running without a core.
  * MENU/MATERIALUI: Fix home screen on first startup - no more stray entries
  * MENU/OZONE: Allowed drawing sidebar and thumbnail bar background color also when core is running
  * MENU/OZONE: Stopped using different padding and position for savestate thumbnails vs imageviewer
  * MENU/OZONE: Removed gradient background effect when core is running, because some themes already have gradient background, which creates ugly rough steps
  * MENU/OZONE: Fixed "Gray Light" theme from using the same background as "Gray Dark", which makes selection cursor near impossible to see
  * MENU/OZONE: Some whitespace corrections
  * MENU/UX: Extend OFF menu value colors
  * MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - Menu Visibility icons (Quick Menu + Settings)
  * MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - Playlist Manager icons
  * MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - Explore icon as database icon
  * MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - View and filter icons as cursor icon (folder icon in GLUI)
  * MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - View save + delete icons
  * MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - Moved Explore + Views below Standalone Cores
  * MENU/UX/OZONE: Removed icons from menus where others items don't have icons, and added icons to menus where the rest have icons
  * MENU/UX/OZONE: Changed the way "no icon" is handled from kludgy way of not drawing SUBSETTING icon
  * MENU/UX/XMB: Changed playlist entry index positioning to bottom right when thumbnails are in vertical mode, because big lists will overlap with arrow and current "breadcrumb" icons when the position is next to current selection
  * MENU/UX/XMB: Added a rather nasty hack to prevent showing wrong icons under Explore as "breadcrumb" icon
  * MENU/UX/XMB: Optimized certain icon drawing loops (Main horizontal icons were looped even when not visible, and all previous "breadcrumb" icons were looped when only one certain was needed)
  * MENU/UX/MATERIALUI: Fixed showing icons where there should not be any (Waitable Swapchains, Show Recording + Streaming)
  * SDL GFX: Fix no menu on start/blank screen issue. 
  * SRAM: Don't init SRAM saving without content (gets rid of the redundant logging)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 21 11:58:53 UTC 2022 - Yunhe Guo <i@guoyunhe.me>

  * FRONTEND: Fix default remaps folder for various cores: remap should be nested in config folder
  * GFX/VIDEO FILTERS: Prevent video filter init if game is not running
  * HOTKEYS: Fix shader toggle and add hotkey + sublabel
  * HOTKEYS: Cleanups and corrections - Keep hotkey pause and menu pause separate in order to not trigger unwanted pause when toggling menu regardless if menu will pause or not
  * HOTKEYS: Cleanups and corrections - Allow unpausing with Start (makes resuming more convenient after controller disconnect if menu does not pause)
  * INPUT: Fixed the way devices were previously indexed. Input devices were only being indexed in order and would stop at the first time an input has no device connected to it. The problem is when a device gets disconnected, that input will have no devices connected to it, but the next input may still have a device connected. So, that makes changing the port of the currently connected devices impossible.
  * INPUT/AUTOCONFIG: Add option for pause on controller disconnect
  * INPUT/AUTOCONFIG: Driver independent disconnection notification. Should show disconnect notification now properly on Windows with XInput and/or DirectInput pads
  * INPUT/HID: Added usb hid controllers for the famous ZeroDelay encoder and also for "Kade: Kick Ass Dynamic Encoder" to be able to use some custom arcade sticks.
  * INPUT/OVERLAY: Add eightway area types.
  * INPUT/OVERLAY: Ignore hitboxes with zero area. I.e. Set 'reach_x' or 'reach_y' to zero to ensure no hitbox math is done. This simplifies designating animation-only descriptors (e.g. for eightway areas) or obsolete descriptors.
  * INPUT/OVERLAY: Add 'reach' and 'exclusive' for hitboxes. Allows stretching hitboxes and handling their overlap.
  * INPUT/OVERLAY: Fix overlay next_index for unnamed targets

  * MENU/OZONE: Footer improvements - Show "Search" helper only when search function is enabled
  * MENU/OZONE: Footer improvements - Fix "Thumbnails available" helper for save states
  * MENU/OZONE: Footer improvements - Tighten padding between icon and title, and widen between helpers
  * MENU/OZONE: Launching anything from a View no longer throws Quick Menu off the screen
  * MENU/OZONE: Save state thumbnails in slot dropdown obeys fullscreen toggle properly when content launched via CLI
  * MENU/OZONE: Save state thumbnail dropdown won’t allow fullscreen toggle when it shouldn’t
  * MENU/OZONE: Selection position remembering in non-playlists won’t flash the first entry
  * MENU/OZONE: Remember selection per main tabs
  * MENU/OZONE: Remove incomplete assets warning
  * MENU/OZONE: Add option to adjust cursor memory when changing menu tabs
  * MENU/OZONE: Further extend texture support for Core Option categories

  * MENU/XMB: Add truncate playlist name option
  * MENU/XMB: Improve background image selector
  * MENU/XMB: Add option to adjust cursor memory when changing menu tabs
  * MENU/XMB: Further extend texture support for Core Option categories
  * MENU/MATERIALUI: Remove incomplete assets warning
  * QB: Don't fail if OSDependent/OGLCompiler libraries are not present
  * SCANNER/PS1: Improved scanning of PS1 discs
  * SCANNER/PS2: Added serial scanning of PS2 discs - should now scan DVDs and other discs which were previously missed
  * THUMBNAIL: If you rename title, you cannot use the thumbnail image. because the thumbnail filename and the title must be the same.
    If there is no thumbnail with title, find the thumbnail image with rom-name. This has nothing to do with IME.
  * THREADED VIDEO/GLCORE: Fix regression 'Shader presets dont load, when video driver is set to glcore'
  * VULKAN: Fix HDR inverse tonemapping. Only skip tonemapper if HDR10 is explicitly enabled by last shader pass. Otherwise, we are simply just inheriting the bit-depth of the swapchain.

Sat Feb 19 04:06:41 UTC 2022 - Yunhe Guo <i@guoyunhe.me>

- Remove retroarch-config.patch and use upstream config and updater

- Add retroarch_migrate_config.py and run it after installation
- Update to version 1.10.0
  * ARCHIVE: Allow loading files from archive subdirectory
  * AUDIO: Remove frame limit from audio batch callback. Before, if
    a core used the audio batch callback, there would be a hidden
    cap of 1024 on the number of audio frames that could be sent. If
    a core exceeded this value, any excess samples were silently
    discarded. While this is sufficient for 'normal' samplerates/
    framerates, it means that e.g. a core using the batch callback
    to send 44100 Hz audio at 30 fps with would have entirely broken
    sound. This has been fixed by removing the audio batch frame limit.

  * 3DS: Initial networking support, HTTP requests won’t work yet.
  * 3DS: Now reports memory and battery state.
  * AUDIO: Added ‘Audio Resampler Quality’ setting to Audio Settings. Setting
    this higher will increase sound quality at the expense of sound latency
    and/or performance. Setting this value lower will improve sound latency/
    performance at the expense of sound quality. Only has an effect if the
    Sinc resampler is used, and you have to restart the game for changes to take effect.
  * CHEEVOS: Fix unofficial achievements not being loaded.
  * CHEEVOS: Show savestate menu entries when no achievements are
    found even if hardcore mode is enabled.

    concept implemented for core MAME 2003.
  * COMMON: Add quick menu option to watch shader files for changes and
    recompile them automatically (Linux only for now).
  * D3D8: Direct3D 8 can now work on systems that have Direct3D 8 installed.
  * D3D9: Add menu support for MaterialUI/XMB.
  * D3D10: Initial video driver implementation.
  * D3D11: Initial video driver implementation.
  * D3D11: SPIRV-Cross/slang shader support for D3D11.

    (Saving one for */foo/bar/mario.sfc* would result in *shaders/presets/corename/bar.ext*).
    We decided it’s safer to still isolate the presets to a single core
    because different cores may treat video output differently.
  * SHADERS: Don’t save the path to the current preset to the main config.
    This was causing weird behavior, instead it will try to load *currentconfig.ext*
    and it will save a preset with that name when select *apply shader preset*.
    The resulting shader will restore properly after restarting and even
    after core/parent/game specific presets are loaded
