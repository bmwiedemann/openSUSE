    and/or performance. Setting this value lower will improve sound latency/
    performance at the expense of sound quality. Only has an effect if the
    Sinc resampler is used, and you have to restart the game for changes to take effect.

    (Saving one for */foo/bar/mario.sfc* would result in *shaders/presets/corename/bar.ext*).
    We decided it’s safer to still isolate the presets to a single core
    because different cores may treat video output differently.
  * SHADERS: Don’t save the path to the current preset to the main config.
    This was causing weird behavior, instead it will try to load *currentconfig.ext*
    and it will save a preset with that name when select *apply shader preset*.

    after core/parent/game specific presets are loaded
