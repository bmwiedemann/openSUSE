 = Rake 10.0.1 Released
 
   "Jim, when will Rake reach version 1.0?"
 
 Over the past several years I've been asked that question at
 conferences, panels and over twitter. Due to historical reasons (or
 maybe just plain laziness) Rake has (incorrectly) been treating the
 second digit of the version as the major release number. So in my head
 Rake was already at version 9.
 
 Well, it's time to fix things. This next version of Rake drops old,
 crufty, backwards compatibility hacks such as top level constants, DSL
 methods defined in Object and numerous other features that are just no
 longer desired. It's also time to drop the leading zero from the
 version number as well and call this new version of rake what it
 really is: Version 10.
 
 So, welcome to Rake 10.0!
 
 Rake 10 is actually feature identical to the latest version of Rake 9
 (that would be the version spelled 0.9.3), *except* that Rake 10 drops
 all the sundry deprecated features that have accumulated over the years.
 
 If your Rakefile is up to date and current with all the new features
 of Rake 10, you are ready to go. If your Rakefile still uses a few
 deprecated feeatures, feel free to use Rake 9 (0.9.3) with the same
 feature set. Just be aware that future features will be in Rake 10
 family line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 14 06:01:23 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 10.0.0
 * Show only the interesting portion of the backtrace by default (James M. Lawrence).
 * Added --reduce-compat optiont to remove backward compatible DSL hacks (James M. Lawrence).
 * lib/rake/file_list.rb (Rake::FileList#egrep): there is no need to
   open files in binary mode. (NAKAMURA Usaku)

-  update to 0.9.2
  * Added deprecation warnings to the Rake DSL methods.
  * *Incompatible* *change*: Rake DSL commands ('task', 'file', etc.)  are
    no longer private methods in Object.  If you need to call 'task :xzy' inside
    your class, include Rake::DSL into the class.  The DSL is still available at
    the top level scope (via the top level object which extends Rake::DSL).
  * Rake now warns when the deprecated :needs syntax used.
  * Rake history is now UTF-8 encoded.
  * Rake now uses case-insensitive comparisons to find the Rakefile on Windows.
    Based on patch by Roger Pack.

    Baginski.

    current directory.  Patch by Alex Chaffee.

    Lüdtke
  * Rake::RDocTask is deprecated.  Use RDoc::Task from RDoc 2.4.2+ (require

  * Rake::GemPackageTask is deprecated.  Use Gem::PackageTask (require
    'rubygems/package_task')
  * Rake now outputs various messages to $stderr instead of $stdout.
  * Rake no longer emits warnings for Config.  Patch by Santiago Pastorino.
  * Split rake.rb into individual files.

    at the time of the error.
  * Accepted change by warnickr to not expand test patterns in shell
    (allowing more files in the test suite).

    (Redmine #57).

    if it can't find the directory.
  * Added fix to handle ruby installations in directories with

    directory in the package for testing. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

    taint and freeze.
  * Added ability clear prerequisites, and/or actions from an
    existing task.

    time.
  * Changed RDoc test task to have no default template. This makes
    it easier for the tempate to pick up the template from the
    environment.
  * Changed from using Mutex to Monitor. Evidently Mutex causes
    thread join errors when Ruby is compiled with
    -disable-pthreads. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

    spaces in file task names. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

    However, if RAKE_COLUMNS is explicitly set, it will be honored
    in any case. (Patch provided by Gavin Stark).
  * Numerous fixes for running under windows. A big thanks to
    Bheeshmar Redheendran for spending a good part of the afternoon
    at the Lonestar Ruby Conference to help me work out these
    issues.
