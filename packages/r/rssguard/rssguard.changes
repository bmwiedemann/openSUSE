    operations.
  * Message list SQL queries are now fully adjustable. This will
    allow for integration of labels functionality in the future.
  * Auto-update status of feeds is now more general and complete.
    (issue #91)
  * Display feed title in list of messages. (issue #97)
  * Displayed feeds can now be sorted by multiple columns. Do you

- Update to version 3.4.0
  Added:
  * New icons (CC 3.0 BY) inspired by the work of Dave Gandy.
  * "Cleanup database" action has now configurable shortcut. 
    (issue #90)
  * Fixed #76, now user can choose to "not show the dialog 
    again" when opening hyperlink from message previewer. This 
    only concerns the lite version of RSS Guard which uses 
    simpler text component for message previewing.
  Changed:
  * (Linux only) Primary user data/config storage is now undex 
    $HOME/.config/RSS Guard. XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is 
    respected. If old user data is detected, then old user data 
    path is used. Note that the location of cache is now changed 
    too to $XDG_{CACHE,DATA}_HOME/RSS Guard.

    names separator. (issue #75)

- Update to version 3.3.7
  Added:
  * Some localizations added & updated.
  * User now can place custom user skins in user "data" 
    folder. (issue #81) See "About" dialog for the exact path.
  * User now can select if DB transactions are enabled or not. 
    (bug #70) By default, DB transactions are now switched OFF, 
    therefore anyone who wants better performance, must turn 
    them ON in app settings.
  * MySQL database backend now requires at least version 5.5, 
    DB encoding is now changed to utf8mb4 character set. (bug 
    #74)
  * Height if message attachment image is now configurable, 
    defaults to 36. (issue #69)
  * All textual contents of all messages are now locally saved 
    in explicit UTF-8 encoding. This is partially because of 
    MySQL backend. We need to keep encoding of data sent to DB 
    and encoding of DB itself in parity.
  Changed:
  * TT-RSS plugin now does NOT require service URL to be 
    entered with "/api/" suffix. In other words, do not use that 
    suffix now, RSS Guard will add it silently when it needs to.
  Fixed:
  * Fixed problem with strings in core being rendered 
    untranslated. (bug #60)
  * Fixed problem with feed updates progress bar flickering. 
    (bug #73)
