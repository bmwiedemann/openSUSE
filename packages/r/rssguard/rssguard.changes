Fri May 31 15:14:30 UTC 2024 - Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz <jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net>

- Update to version 4.7.2
  * Fixed:
    - Some non-lite installation packages were wrongly named.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1426)
    - Plugins were loaded multiple times. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1427)
- Update to version 4.7.1
  * Fixed:
    - Fixed detection of plugins which was broken due to wrong plugin search
      path. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1416, gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1420)
    - If "Show unread only" article list filter is active and you select
      article (which then gets marked read) and then feed is fetched, currently
      selected article does not suddenly disappear from the list.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1415)
    - Selected "style" was disappearing from settings dialog even thought it
      was correctly saved into settings. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1408)
    - Right-clicking article selects it (and displays its contents) but does
      not modify read/unread state. This behavior was corrupted in previous
      release, therefore we just return to old good behavior.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1410)
    - XML parser now allows leading and trailing blank lines when loading XML
      of feeds. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1403)
    - Date/time parsing was further enhanced, although there are some connected
      issues which will be hunted in the future.
    - Qt5/Windows builds will use only qtmultimedia media player backend
      because libmpv dropped Windows 7 support.
    - Fixed "About" dialog RSS Guard information formatting.
- Fix compilation on Leap:
  * Use an specific gcc
  * Disable mpv on versions older than 15.6
- Drop fix_plugin_loading.patch, it was merged upstream
- Replace rssguard-4.7.0-add_library_version.patch with updated
  rssguard-4.7.2-add_library_version.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 22 19:04:29 UTC 2024 - Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz <jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net>

- Update to version 4.7.0
  * Added:
    - Full article content can now be fetched with a single button. Button is
      placed in article viewer toolbar right next to "Reader mode" button. This
      feature (just as "reader mode" feature) requires Node.js installation.
      The feature works both for articles and for regular websites opened in
      embedded web browser.
    - Article now can be marked (upon selection) as read with delay or only
      manually. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1017)
    - All RSS Guard plugins/services are now placed in their own library
      (DLL/SO/DYLIB) files and are loaded by main RSS Guard library
      dynamically. This means that unused services can now be removed from RSS
      Guard installation if not used by the user. Also it allows for a cleaner
      and slimmer common codebase. Refactoring of main RSS Guard library was
      also done and it is now more usable as regular dynamic-link library. I
      expect some regressions as this was HUGE change. Also, this change allows
      new potential interested people in writing new plugins easier as they now
      can just copy one of existing plugins and tweak for new service. Also
      this change now propagates to RSS Guard installer which allows you to
      only install plugins/services you want.
    - Application (Qt) style and icon theme now can be properly set to respect
      system style/icons and this setting is dynamic, meaning if you change
      system theme and restart RSS Guard, new theme is honored.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1352)
    - Button to copy system/app information to "About..." dialog.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1318)
    - All modal dialogs now remember their sizes forever.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1336)
  * Fixed:
    - Removed debugging forgotten code. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1354)
    - "Cleanup" button in downloader was greyed out when it should not be.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1350)
    - App crashes when changing notification sound.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1317)
    - Built-in user-agent was updated. You can also supply your own user-agent,
      see rssguard.exe --help for more info.
- Replace rssguard-4.6.6-add_library_version.patch with updated rssguard-4.7.0-add_library_version.patch
- Add fix_plugin_loading.patch from upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  2 17:54:57 UTC 2023 - Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz <jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net>
- Update to version 4.5.3
  + Added:
    - Article and feed toolbar heights are now normalized to same values.
  + Fixed:
    - Fixed couple of cases where feed multi-selection and/or batch operations
      were not taking multi-selection properly into account.
    - Fixed some unnecessary prompts to restart app in settings dialog.
    - Updated translations and readme.
- Update to version 4.5.2
  + Added:
    - Added new "Discover feeds" dialog which is automatically opened when user
      hits "Add new feed" button. In this dialog, use does not have to input
      exact feed address but can enter just regular website address and RSS
      Guard will try to discover all available feeds possible.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1134)
    - ATOM/RSS/JSON/Sitemap feeds now automatically use "ETag" HTTP headers
      which has potential speedup when fetching feeds with no new messages.
      This can bring 10-80 % speedup if user uses more feeds which do support
      "ETag". (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1136)
    - Support for Sitemap "sitemap.xml" files is added! Vast majority of
      websites have sitemaps and RSS Guard now can read them in the same way it
      does with RSS/ATOM formats. "Discover feeds" dialog has Sitemaps support
      integrated and it even is able to traverse sitemap indexes. GZipped
      sitemaps are supported too. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1129)
    - Added multiple/extended selection to feeds list! Now it is possible to
      select multiple items at once (feeds, categories, etc.) and perform batch
      actions on them - batch editing, deleting, marking read/unread,
      re-sorting - when some feeds are selected it is now in "Edit selected
      items" dialog possible to batch change only some properties in a very
      clean and universal way. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1010,
      gh#martinrotter/rssguard#89)
    - Localizations updated.
    - Documentation updated.
    - Arguments parsing is now totally overhauled. It is now possible to use
      both double and single quotes to quote arguments. Read "Scraping

    - Local files can now be used directly as sources for feeds, just select
      "Local file" in add/edit feed dialog.
  + Fixed:
    - Fixed OPML import/export when some feeds use custom script as source.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1133)
    - RSS/ATOM parsing is now greatly enhanced.
- Update to version 4.5.1
  + Added:
    - Completely new, custom "toast" notifications:

      - Can be displayed on secondary screens.
      - Automatically adopts look of currently active RSS Guard skin.
      - Can be close via close corner button or via Esc keyboard button.
      - When hovered with mouse, notification stays shown, when not hovered,
        it is automatically hidden after 15 seconds.
      - Displays list of newly fetched articles and offers some basic actions
        like marking as read, showing in article list or in web browser.
      - These notifications do not need "tray icon" to be activated.
      - Can be tweaked in Notifications section of settings.
    - pdb debugging file is now distributed with RSS Guard on Windows.
    - NPM packages updated to latest versions.
  + Fixed:
    - AppData file now does not contain <pre> tags.

      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1098)
    - Fixed behavior of Google-based phrase suggestion in web browser
      navigation text box.
    - Many different features of RSS Guard got minor fixes, some parts of
      source code were refactored. Particularly, one nasty "semi-bug" was fixed
      which influenced speed of article switching in article list. It should
      now be faster. Much faster.
    - Article counting for "regex queries" is now disabled because this was
      very performance-hungry even with small number of regex queries, sadly.
    - Translations of some languages are now more complete.
    - Some unused source code was removed.
    - Some unused deps were removed.
- Update to version 4.5.0
  + Added:

      pane. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1045)
    - Right-to-left optional layout for feeds/articles. You can switch this in
      each feed properties.
    - Gmail: Labels are now fetched from the service too and they are
      synchronizable.
    - New feature called "regex queries" allowing users to have (persistent)
      regular expression based article list filters. See your feed list for
      "Regex queries" item and right click to add one.
    - "reader mode" feature now uses skin-based format & colors.
    - All features which generate random colors now use better HSV-based
      algorithm.
    - Added application-wide and feed-wide ability to limit articles based on
      article date/time. This can be changed in application settings in "Feed
      fetching" section and in feed properties dialog in "Articles" section.
    - JavaScript code of article filters now has syntax highlighting.
    - Use non-standard "url" element as fallback for article URLs in RSS
      format.
    - Percentages of localization progres for each translation is now shown in
      "Localization" settings section.
    - "clang-format" updated.
    - User CSS styles can now be supplied via file
      <user-data-folder>/web/user-styles.css.
    - When fetching metadata during OPML import, there is now option to NOT
      fetch icons. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#1009)
  + Fixed:
    - Icons in feed list are now correctly vertically centered.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#999)

      inspired by similar feature of QuiteRSS. The behavior is switchable in
      settings. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#948)
    - Details of selected feed list item are now enhanced with new information.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#962)

      performance fine-tuning which might be addressed in the future.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#952)
    - Behavior and visual representation of "article highlighter" and "article
      list filter" tool buttons is now fixed. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#943)
    - Newly created label is now placed in correct sort position in feed list.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#978)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 26 20:17:04 UTC 2023 - Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz <jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net>

- Update to version 4.3.4
  + Added:
    - Persistent article/item viewer. By default it is on. If no article is
      selected but feed/category is, then miscellaneous information about
      selected feed list item is displayed. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#424)
    - Reworked logic of determining which article states
      (read/unread/starred/unstarred) have changed when synchronizing states to
      remote feed servers. This concerns all synchronized plugins like Gmail,
      Greader, Feedly, etc. and show in theory lead to much better performance
      when you mark many articles as read or unread.
    - Couple of extra QoL enhancements for Gmail like proper encoding of
      attachment filenames, turned off displaying of "enclosures" as these are
      displayed in other way, etc.
  + Fixed:
    - Deadlock when fetching feeds in some corner situations is now resolved.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#910)
    - URLs of articles are now sanitized from leading and trailing spaces.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#914)
    - ATOM feeds were mistakenly changed to RSS feeds during OPML import.
      (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#913)

    - Freezing of GUI when fetching feeds should now be gone even on newer Qt
      library.
    - Correct account-wide proxy is used when importing feeds.
    - Article duplicity checks are now much more useful and actually working in
      article filters.
    - Translations synced.

- Add rssguard-4.3.4-fix-build.patch
- Drop rssguard-4.3.3-fix-build.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 30 20:35:46 UTC 2023 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- Update to version 4.3.3
  + Added:

      regexp or wildcard as search phrase and you can choose whether to search
      just in titles or in whole article. (#886)
    - Added option to focus feed/article lists with keyboard shortcuts. (545)
    - Uninstaller now should detect if RSS Guard is running or not. (#529)

    - Word-wrap is now correctly used for plain-text articles. (#900)
    - Some memory leaks were patched and also SQLite database connections now
      share "cache" across all threads, resulting in drastically better RAM
      usage of the app.

    - Updated docs, updated translations.
- Added patch rssguard-4.3.3-fix-build.patch
- Refreshed patch rssguard-4.2.2-add_library_version.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  8 20:35:40 UTC 2023 - Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz <jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net>

- Update to version 4.3.2:
  + Added:
    - Display total number of underlying feeds/categories in account's tooltip
      in feed list. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#881)
    - Press "CTRL+F" when article script textbox is highlighted in "Article
      filters" dialog to allow for text searching. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#889)
    - Filtering option in article list toolbar are now inclusive with checkbox
      like appearance. You can now thus select multiple filtering conditions
      and if article meets atleast one of them, it is displayed. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#468)
    - WebEngine disk cache now can be disabled in settings. If it is "disabled"
      then RSS Guard will use memory-based cache which is automatically
      destroyed when RSS Guard exits. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#725)
    - Help spoilers now can display HTML help with clickable hyperlinks.
    - Skins are now able to load custom TTF and OTF fonts and also skins now
      are able to specify application-wide font. You can see sample usage of
      this feature in sample skin.
  + Fixed:
    - Fixed crash when importing OPML files.
    - Fixed looooong-standing hidden bug which could cause that labels
      DEassigned from filters were not synchronized back to feed service if
      supported.
    - Enhanced information about "resources" in "About" dialog.
- Update to version 4.3.1:
  + Fixed:
    - Reverted to Qt 6.3 for Windows 10+ builds due to some regressions AGAIN.
    - Fixed TT-RSS icons downloading when obtaining list of feeds/folders.
    - RSS Guard now converts all placeholders (for example "%data%") to native
      path folder separators.
- Update to version 4.3.0:
  + Added:
    - Massive update for feed fetching mechanism. It is now very parallelized
      and performance gain should be brutal. On my development PC with 4 cores
      (Intel i5) I observed 800 % performance boost. Note that this feature
      required huge number of changes on source code so there could be some
      corner case regressions or not so polished situations. File bug report
      when that happens. Also, number of threads used by this feature is
      configurable via --threads command line switch. This parallelization
      approach will also be applied to some other parts of application in the
      future, particularly for some massive batched network operations in some
      plugin - TT-RSS, Greader or Gmail - which will result in massive
      performance boost too.
    - RSS Guard is now available on Flathub in two distinct variants - "full"
      and "lite" (same as "nonwebengine").
    - Suffix ".xml" is also accepted for OPML 2.0 files.
    - Brutal speed enhancements when importing OPML 2.0 files. Whole
      functionality is now properly parallelized and performance boost is
      potentially massive, depending on number of your CPU cores/threads.
    - Qt 6 bumped to 6.4.2 version - this fixes some regressions.
  + Fixed:
    - Some random Mac OS X crash. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#866)
- Update to version 4.2.6:
  + Added:
    - Bunch of premade sample article filters added to "Article filters" window.
    - Placeholders in external tools definitions can be now arbitrarily placed.
    - Article RSS enclosures can now be added from within article filters.
    - Added customizable skin color for feeds with NEW articles. So now it is

    disables it and it won't get any new articles. See "Edit feed"

    + Labels are even synchronizable for Inoreader and TT-RSS.
    + Each message can have assigned multiple labels.
    + Feed's view now offers "Labels" folder with handy
      per-label filtering.

    + You can assign arbitrary color to each of your labels.
  * Numix is now default icon theme.

    (https://minicss.org) instead of Bootstrap. This will make
    viewing of messages quite faster while being more
    lightweight.
  * Message body now has "auto" reading direction - enhances
    support for RTL messages.
  * JSON feeds (https://www.jsonfeed.org) are now supported.
  * Added basic CLI interface, run "rssguard --help" to see its
    API overview.

    for column show/hide operations.
  * Background color of rows in feed/message list can now be
    alternated.
  * Message titles are now properly sanitized before messages
    are processed by message filters.

    (https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/blob/master/resources/docs/Documentation.md#documentation)
  Fixed/changed:
  * Correct icons are now downloaded when fetching metadata for
    RSS/ATOM/JSON feeds.
  * Fixed crash when clearing contents of statusbar.
  * Translations synchronized.
  * Message previwers were completely overhauled to support
    displaying of (active) labels.
  * Codebase of web-based and text-based message previwers was
    unified, they now share all common code.
  * Some fixes for message filtering mechanism.
  * Scroll position within message viewer is now remembered if
    message gets reloaded.
  * Text-based message viewer now handles newlines better.
  * Fixed OPML export/import for some feeds/categories which
    could be skipped due to various specific errors.
  * Synchronization logic for "feeds" is now more universal,
    resulting in better behavior when running "Sync in" actions.
  * Obsolete Qt-related code removed/replaced.
  * Source code does not use hardcoded GUI colors anymore. They
    are fetched from active skin instead, making some texts more
    readable and GUI more consistent.
  * Fixed various MySQL-related problems and errors which
    rendered MySQL DB backend unusable for many users.
  * Icon themes are not bundled on Linux anymore, RSS Guard
    fully relies on system-wide themes now.

    for testing.

    allow for integration of labels functionality in the future.

    (issue #91)
  * Display feed title in list of messages. (issue #97)
  * Displayed feeds can now be sorted by multiple columns. Do you

  * "Cleanup database" action has now configurable shortcut. 
    (issue #90)
  * Fixed #76, now user can choose to "not show the dialog 
    again" when opening hyperlink from message previewer. This 
    only concerns the lite version of RSS Guard which uses 
    simpler text component for message previewing.
  Changed:
  * (Linux only) Primary user data/config storage is now undex 
    $HOME/.config/RSS Guard. XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is 
    respected. If old user data is detected, then old user data 
    path is used. Note that the location of cache is now changed

    folder. (issue #81) See "About" dialog for the exact path.
  * User now can select if DB transactions are enabled or not. 
    (bug #70) By default, DB transactions are now switched OFF, 
    therefore anyone who wants better performance, must turn 
    them ON in app settings.
  * MySQL database backend now requires at least version 5.5, 
    DB encoding is now changed to utf8mb4 character set. (bug 
    #74)
  * Height if message attachment image is now configurable, 
    defaults to 36. (issue #69)
  * All textual contents of all messages are now locally saved 
    in explicit UTF-8 encoding. This is partially because of 
    MySQL backend. We need to keep encoding of data sent to DB 
    and encoding of DB itself in parity.
  Changed:
  * TT-RSS plugin now does NOT require service URL to be 
    entered with "/api/" suffix. In other words, do not use that 
    suffix now, RSS Guard will add it silently when it needs to.

    untranslated. (bug #60)
