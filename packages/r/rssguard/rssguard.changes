Wed Feb  8 20:35:40 UTC 2023 - Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz <jaime.marquinez.ferrandiz@fastmail.net>

- Update to version 4.3.2:
  + Added:
    - Display total number of underlying feeds/categories in account's tooltip
      in feed list. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#881)
    - Press "CTRL+F" when article script textbox is highlighted in "Article
      filters" dialog to allow for text searching. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#889)
    - Filtering option in article list toolbar are now inclusive with checkbox
      like appearance. You can now thus select multiple filtering conditions
      and if article meets atleast one of them, it is displayed. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#468)
    - WebEngine disk cache now can be disabled in settings. If it is "disabled"
      then RSS Guard will use memory-based cache which is automatically
      destroyed when RSS Guard exits. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#725)
    - Help spoilers now can display HTML help with clickable hyperlinks.
    - Skins are now able to load custom TTF and OTF fonts and also skins now
      are able to specify application-wide font. You can see sample usage of
      this feature in sample skin.
  + Fixed:
    - Fixed crash when importing OPML files.
    - Fixed looooong-standing hidden bug which could cause that labels
      DEassigned from filters were not synchronized back to feed service if
      supported.
    - Enhanced information about "resources" in "About" dialog.
- Update to version 4.3.1:
  + Fixed:
    - Reverted to Qt 6.3 for Windows 10+ builds due to some regressions AGAIN.
    - Fixed TT-RSS icons downloading when obtaining list of feeds/folders.
    - RSS Guard now converts all placeholders (for example "%data%") to native
      path folder separators.
- Update to version 4.3.0:
  + Added:
    - Massive update for feed fetching mechanism. It is now very parallelized
      and performance gain should be brutal. On my development PC with 4 cores
      (Intel i5) I observed 800 % performance boost. Note that this feature
      required huge number of changes on source code so there could be some
      corner case regressions or not so polished situations. File bug report
      when that happens. Also, number of threads used by this feature is
      configurable via --threads command line switch. This parallelization
      approach will also be applied to some other parts of application in the
      future, particularly for some massive batched network operations in some
      plugin - TT-RSS, Greader or Gmail - which will result in massive
      performance boost too.
    - RSS Guard is now available on Flathub in two distinct variants - "full"
      and "lite" (same as "nonwebengine").
    - Suffix ".xml" is also accepted for OPML 2.0 files.
    - Brutal speed enhancements when importing OPML 2.0 files. Whole
      functionality is now properly parallelized and performance boost is
      potentially massive, depending on number of your CPU cores/threads.
    - Qt 6 bumped to 6.4.2 version - this fixes some regressions.
  + Fixed:
    - Some random Mac OS X crash. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#866)
- Update to version 4.2.6:
  + Added:
    - Bunch of premade sample article filters added to "Article filters" window.
    - Placeholders in external tools definitions can be now arbitrarily placed.
    - Article RSS enclosures can now be added from within article filters.
    - Added customizable skin color for feeds with NEW articles. So now it is
      possible to distinguish between NEW and UNREAD (but old) articles. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#850)
    - Added application debug log dialog. See "Help" menu for more.
    - Too big fetched feed icons are now automatically scaled down to fixed
      size (48x48).
    - Now it is possible to run post-process script when importing OPML. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#848)
    - Now it is possible to change "User-Agent" HTTP header. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#835)
    - Added now column into article list which shows labels for each article. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#768)
    - Now it is possible to "suppress" feed. Suppressed feeds do not trigger
      notifications. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#745)
  + Fixed:
    - HTML detection on the QTextBrowser viewer is now more precise. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#813)
    - Article decoding for Nextcloud News works better. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#814)
    - Inoreader built-in API tokens are removed, because they were abused.
    - Default AdBlock lists now have corrected URL addresses.
    - Fixed full-article scraper "scrape-full-articles.py".
    - Do some preparations and code cleanups for adding "lite" RSS Guard
      variant to Flathub.
    - Nextcloud News plugin processes "mediaThumbnail" and "mediaDescription"
      when parsing articles. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#831)
    - Avoid appending empty RSS enclosures to articles. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#832)
    - AppImage reverted to Qt 5 as Qt 6 support in AppImage generator is very
      very buggy.
    - All dialogs where icons/images are selected now load their "formats"
      dynamically to support all possible image formats correctly. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#834) This
      effectivelly adds "webp" and other formats on systems where it is
      supported.
    - Fixed crash. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#849)
    - Enable smooth-scrolling by default. (gh#martinrotter/rssguard#793)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 21 13:15:53 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 4.2.5:
  + Added:
    - RSS Guard now can use super fast feed/article refresh rates.
      At this point it is possible to set refresh interval even to
      1 second to allow super fast checking for content changes.
  + Fixed:
    - Newspaper mode caused some GUI glitches.
    - Feedly crashed whole application when performing folder/feed
      synchronization.
    - Some specific feeds are faulty but some adjustments were made
      to make RSS/ATOM parsing more loose.

  Added:
  * Feedly now supports intelligent synchronization algorithm, resulting in
    much faster sync.
  * Feedly now decodes feed titles from HTML to plain text.
  * New CLI "-w" option to force "nowebengine" behavior even in standard
    "webengine" RSS Guard builds.
  * Article viewers are greatly refactored and internally use sane C++
    interface - this allows this piece of RSS Guard to be expanded better in
    the future.
  * "nowebengine" text-based article viewer now can display images. (#583)
  * "nowebengine" text-based article viewer now can act as VERY SIMPLE web browser.
    It displays webpages in a simpler text-like fashion, it can follow hyperlinks, context menu offers more actions like downloading of links etc.

    customizable, you can set to display e. g. time only for today's

    better UX.
  * New action "Open main menu" can now be added to toolbars.

    disables it and it won't get any new articles. See "Edit feed"
    dialog, specifically "Miscellaneous" tab.

    especially subsequent synchronizations. Also, some Gmail-related
    fixes were added.

    allow for integration of labels functionality in the future.

  * "Cleanup database" action has now configurable shortcut. 
    (issue #90)

    simpler text component for message previewing.

  * (Linux only) Primary user data/config storage is now undex 
    $HOME/.config/RSS Guard. XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is 
    respected. If old user data is detected, then old user data

    (bug #70) By default, DB transactions are now switched OFF, 
    therefore anyone who wants better performance, must turn 
    them ON in app settings.
  * MySQL database backend now requires at least version 5.5, 
    DB encoding is now changed to utf8mb4 character set. (bug 
    #74)
  * Height if message attachment image is now configurable, 
    defaults to 36. (issue #69)
  * All textual contents of all messages are now locally saved 
    in explicit UTF-8 encoding. This is partially because of 
    MySQL backend. We need to keep encoding of data sent to DB 
    and encoding of DB itself in parity.
  Changed:

    entered with "/api/" suffix. In other words, do not use that 
    suffix now, RSS Guard will add it silently when it needs to.

    untranslated. (bug #60)
