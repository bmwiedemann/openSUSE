# There used to be a docker-runc package which was specifically for Docker.
# Since Docker now tracks upstream more consistently, we use the same package
# but we need to obsolete the old one. bsc#1181677
# NOTE: We can't use the package version here because docker-runc used a
#       different versioning scheme by accident (1.0.0rc92 vs 1.0.0~rc92 -- and
#       GNU sort considers the former to be newer than the latter, in fact
#       1.0.0rc92 is newer than 1.0.0 according to GNU sort). So we invent a
#       fake 1.0.0.1 version.

%description
runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI
specification. It is designed to be as minimal as possible, and is the workhorse
of Docker. It was originally designed to be a replacement for LXC within Docker,
and has grown to become a separate project entirely.
