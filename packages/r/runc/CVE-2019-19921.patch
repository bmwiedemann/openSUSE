Subject: [PATCH] rootfs: do not permit /proc mounts to non-directories

mount(2) will blindly follow symlinks, which is a problem because it
allows a malicious container to trick runc into mounting /proc to an
entirely different location (and thus within the attacker's control for
a rename-exchange attack).

This is just a hotfix (to "stop the bleeding"), and the more complete
fix would be finish libpathrs and port runc to it (to avoid these types
of attacks entirely, and defend against a variety of other /proc-related
attacks). It can be bypased by someone having "/" be a volume controlled
by another container.

Fixes: CVE-2019-19921
