- Update to runc v1.1.5. Upstream changelog is available from
  <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.5>.

  Includes fixes for the following CVEs:
   - CVE-2023-25809 bsc#1209884
   - CVE-2023-27561 bsc#1208962
   - CVE-2023-28642 bsc#1209888

  * Fix the inability to use `/dev/null` when inside a container.
  * Fix changing the ownership of host's `/dev/null` caused by fd redirection
    (a regression in 1.1.1). bsc#1168481
  * Fix rare runc exec/enter unshare error on older kernels.
  * nsexec: Check for errors in `write_log()`.

- Drop version-specific Go requirement.

- Update to runc v1.1.4. Upstream changelog is available from
  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.4.
  bsc#1202021

  * Fix mounting via wrong proc fd. When the user and mount namespaces are
    used, and the bind mount is followed by the cgroup mount in the spec,
    the cgroup was mounted using the bind mount's mount fd.
  * Switch kill() in libcontainer/nsenter to sane_kill().
  * Fix "permission denied" error from runc run on noexec fs.
  * Fix failed exec after systemctl daemon-reload. Due to a regression
    in v1.1.3, the DeviceAllow=char-pts rwm rule was no longer added and
    was causing an error open /dev/pts/0: operation not permitted: unknown when systemd was reloaded.
    (boo#1202821)

- Update to runc v1.1.3. Upstream changelog is available from
  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.3.
  (Includes a fix for bsc#1200088.)

  * Our seccomp `-ENOSYS` stub now correctly handles multiplexed syscalls on
    s390 and s390x. This solves the issue where syscalls the host kernel did not
    support would return `-EPERM` despite the existence of the `-ENOSYS` stub
    code (this was due to how s390x does syscall multiplexing).
  * Retry on dbus disconnect logic in libcontainer/cgroups/systemd now works as
    intended; this fix does not affect runc binary itself but is important for
    libcontainer users such as Kubernetes.
  * Inability to compile with recent clang due to an issue with duplicate
    constants in libseccomp-golang.
  * When using systemd cgroup driver, skip adding device paths that don't exist,
    to stop systemd from emitting warnings about those paths.
  * Socket activation was failing when more than 3 sockets were used.
  * Various CI fixes.
  * Allow to bind mount /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid to inside container.
  * runc static binaries are now linked against libseccomp v2.5.4.

  CVE-2022-29162 bsc#1199460

  * A bug was found in runc where runc exec --cap executed processes with
    non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux
    environment. For more information, see [GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66][] and
    CVE-2022-29162. bsc#1199460
  * `runc spec` no longer sets any inheritable capabilities in the created
    example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.

- Update to runc v1.1.1. Upstream changelog is available from

  * runc run/start can now run a container with read-only /dev in OCI spec,
    rather than error out. (#3355)
  * runc exec now ensures that --cgroup argument is a sub-cgroup. (#3403)
    libcontainer systemd v2 manager no longer errors out if one of the files
    listed in /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate do not exist in container's
    cgroup. (#3387, #3404)
  * Loosen OCI spec validation to avoid bogus "Intel RDT is not supported"
    error. (#3406)
  * libcontainer/cgroups no longer panics in cgroup v1 managers if stat
    of /sys/fs/cgroup/unified returns an error other than ENOENT. (#3435)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to runc v1.1.0. Upstream changelog is available from
  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0.

  - libcontainer will now refuse to build without the nsenter package being
    correctly compiled (specifically this requires CGO to be enabled). This
    should avoid folks accidentally creating broken runc binaries (and
    incorrectly importing our internal libraries into their projects). (#3331)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 14 05:04:21 UTC 2021 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to runc v1.1.0~rc1. Upstream changelog is available from
  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc.1.

  + Add support for RDMA cgroup added in Linux 4.11.
  * runc exec now produces exit code of 255 when the exec failed.
    This may help in distinguishing between runc exec failures
    (such as invalid options, non-running container or non-existent
    binary etc.) and failures of the command being executed.
  + runc run: new --keep option to skip removal exited containers artefacts.
    This might be useful to check the state (e.g. of cgroup controllers) after
    the container has￼exited.
  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS and SCMP_ACT_KILL_THREAD
    (the latter is just an alias for SCMP_ACT_KILL).
  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_NOTIFY (seccomp actions). This allows
    users to create sophisticated seccomp filters where syscalls can be
    efficiently emulated by privileged processes on the host.
  + checkpoint/restore: add an option (--lsm-mount-context) to set
    a different LSM mount context on restore.
  + intelrdt: support ClosID parameter.
  + runc exec --cgroup: an option to specify a (non-top) in-container cgroup
    to use for the process being executed.
  + cgroup v1 controllers now support hybrid hierarchy (i.e. when on a cgroup v1
    machine a cgroup2 filesystem is mounted to /sys/fs/cgroup/unified, runc
    run/exec now adds the container to the appropriate cgroup under it).
  + sysctl: allow slashes in sysctl names, to better match sysctl(8)'s
    behaviour.
  + mounts: add support for bind-mounts which are inaccessible after switching
    the user namespace. Note that this does not permit the container any
    additional access to the host filesystem, it simply allows containers to
    have bind-mounts configured for paths the user can access but have
    restrictive access control settings for other users.
  + Add support for recursive mount attributes using mount_setattr(2). These
    have the same names as the proposed mount(8) options -- just prepend r
    to the option name (such as rro).
  + Add runc features subcommand to allow runc users to detect what features
    runc has been built with. This includes critical information such as
    supported mount flags, hook names, and so on. Note that the output of this
    command is subject to change and will not be considered stable until runc
    1.2 at the earliest. The runtime-spec specification for this feature is
    being developed in opencontainers/runtime-spec#1130.
  * system: improve performance of /proc/$pid/stat parsing.
  * cgroup2: when /sys/fs/cgroup is configured as a read-write mount, change
    the ownership of certain cgroup control files (as per
    /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate) to allow for proper deferral to the container
    process.
  * runc checkpoint/restore: fixed for containers with an external bind mount
    which destination is a symlink.
  * cgroup: improve openat2 handling for cgroup directory handle hardening.
    runc delete -f now succeeds (rather than timing out) on a paused
    container.
  * runc run/start/exec now refuses a frozen cgroup (paused container in case of
    exec). Users can disable this using --ignore-paused.
- Update version data embedded in binary to correctly include the git commit of
  the release.
- Drop runc-rpmlintrc because we don't have runc-test anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  6 04:38:25 UTC 2021 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to runc v1.0.3. Upstream changelog is available from
  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.3. CVE-2021-43784
  bsc#1193436

  * A potential vulnerability was discovered in runc (related to an internal
    usage of netlink), however upon further investigation we discovered that
    while this bug was exploitable on the master branch of runc, no released
    version of runc could be exploited using this bug. The exploit required
    being able to create a netlink attribute with a length that would overflow a
    uint16 but this was not possible in any released version of runc. For more
    information see GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f and CVE-2021-43784.

    Due to an abundance of caution we decided to do an emergency release with
    this fix, but to reiterate we do not believe this vulnerability was
    possible to exploit. Thanks to Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero for
    discovering and reporting this vulnerability so quickly.
  * Fixed inability to start a container with read-write bind mount of a
    read-only fuse host mount.
  * Fixed inability to start when read-only /dev in set in spec.
  * Fixed not removing sub-cgroups upon container delete, when rootless cgroup
    v2 is used with older systemd.
  * Fixed returning error from GetStats when hugetlb is unsupported (which
    causes excessive logging for kubernetes).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 23 09:35:05 UTC 2021 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to runc v1.0.2. Upstream changelog is available from
  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2

  * Fixed a failure to set CPU quota period in some cases on cgroup v1.
  * Fixed the inability to start a container with the "adding seccomp filter
    rule for syscall ..." error, caused by redundant seccomp rules (i.e. those
    that has action equal to the default one). Such redundant rules are now
    skipped.
  * Made release builds reproducible from now on.
  * Fixed a rare debug log race in runc init, which can result in occasional
    harmful "failed to decode ..." errors from runc run or exec.
  * Fixed the check in cgroup v1 systemd manager if a container needs to be
    frozen before Set, and add a setting to skip such freeze unconditionally.
    The previous fix for that issue, done in runc 1.0.1, was not working.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 18 02:40:16 UTC 2021 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to runc v1.0.1. Upstream changelog is available from
  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.1

  * Fixed occasional runc exec/run failure ("interrupted system call") on an
    Azure volume.
  * Fixed "unable to find groups ... token too long" error with /etc/group
    containing lines longer than 64K characters.
  * cgroup/systemd/v1: fix leaving cgroup frozen after Set if a parent cgroup is
    frozen. This is a regression in 1.0.0, not affecting runc itself but some
    of libcontainer users (e.g Kubernetes).
  * cgroupv2: bpf: Ignore inaccessible existing programs in case of
    permission error when handling replacement of existing bpf cgroup
    programs. This fixes a regression in 1.0.0, where some SELinux
    policies would block runc from being able to run entirely.
  * cgroup/systemd/v2: don't freeze cgroup on Set.
  * cgroup/systemd/v1: avoid unnecessary freeze on Set.

- Update to runc v1.0.0. Upstream changelog is available from
  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0

  ! The usage of relative paths for mountpoints will now produce a warning
    (such configurations are outside of the spec, and in future runc will
    produce an error when given such configurations).

  * cgroupv2: devices: rework the filter generation to produce consistent
    results with cgroupv1, and always clobber any existing eBPF
    program(s) to fix runc update and avoid leaking eBPF programs
    (resulting in errors when managing containers).
  * cgroupv2: correctly convert "number of IOs" statistics in a
    cgroupv1-compatible way.
  * cgroupv2: support larger than 32-bit IO statistics on 32-bit architectures.
  * cgroupv2: wait for freeze to finish before returning from the freezing
    code, optimize the method for checking whether a cgroup is frozen.
  * cgroups/systemd: fixed "retry on dbus disconnect" logic introduced in rc94
  * cgroups/systemd: fixed returning "unit already exists" error from a systemd
    cgroup manager (regression in rc94)

  + cgroupv2: support SkipDevices with systemd driver
  + cgroup/systemd: return, not ignore, stop unit error from Destroy
  + Make "runc --version" output sane even when built with go get or
    otherwise outside of our build scripts.
  + cgroups: set SkipDevices during runc update (so we don't modify
    cgroups at all during runc update).
  + cgroup1: blkio: support BFQ weights.
  + cgroupv2: set per-device io weights if BFQ IO scheduler is available.

- Update to runc v1.0.0-rc4. Upstream changelog:
	+ runc now supports v1.0.0 of the OCI runtime specification. #1527
	+ Rootless containers support has been released. The current state of
	  this feature is that it only supports single-{uid,gid} mappings as an
	  unprivileged user, and cgroups are completely unsupported. Work is
	  being done to improve this. #774
	+ Rather than relying on CRIU version nnumbers, actually check if the
	  system supports pre-dumping. #1371
	+ Allow the PIDs cgroup limit to be updated. #1423
	+ Add support for checkpoint/restore of containers with orphaned PTYs
	  (which is effectively all containers with terminal=true). #1355
	+ Permit prestart hooks to modify the cgroup configuration of a
	  container. #1239
	+ Add support for a wide variety of mount options. #1460
	+ Expose memory.use_hierarchy in MemoryStats. #1378
	* Fix incorrect handling of systems without the freezer cgroup. #1387
	* Many, many changes to switch away from Go's "syscall" stdlib to
	  "golang.org/x/sys/unix". #1394 #1398 #1442 #1464 #1467 #1470 #1474
	  #1478 #1491 #1482 #1504 #1519 #1530
	* Set cgroup resources when restoring a container. #1399
	* Switch back to using /sbin as the installation directory. #1406
	* Remove the arbitrary container ID length restriction. #1435
	* Make container force deletion ignore non-existent containers. #1451
	* Improve handling of arbitrary cgroup mount locations when populating
	  cpuset. #1372
	* Make the SaneTerminal interface public. #1479
	* Fix cases where runc would report a container to be in a "Running"
	  state if the init was a zombie or dead. #1489
	* Do not set supplementary groups for numeric users. #1450
	* Fix various issues with the "owner" field in runc-list. #1516
	* Many other miscellaneous fixes, some of which were made by first-time
	  contributors. Thanks, and welcome to the project! #1406 #1400 #1365
	  #1396 #1402 #1414 #1412 #1408 #1418 #1425 #1428 #1436 #1433 #1438
	  #1410 #1447 #1388 #1484 #1481 #1496 #1245 #1524 #1534 #1526 #1533
	- Remove any semblance of non-Linux support. #1502
	- We no longer use shfmt for testing. #1510

- Substitute %__-type macro indirections

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 16:34:03 UTC 2017 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- update version to the one required by docker-17.04.0-ce (bsc#1034053)

  is available in all archs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 29 15:47:52 UTC 2017 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- fix bsc#1028113 - runc: make sure to ignore cgroup v2 mountpoints
  This is a backport of https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/1266
  + ignore_cgroup2_mountpoint.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 24 18:08:10 UTC 2017 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- update to docker-1.13.0 requirement

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 13 13:58:33 UTC 2017 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- fix CVE-2016-9962 bsc#1012568 and applying the patch
  CVE-2016-9962.patch, because 1.12.6 partially fixes it (it contains
  the first patch attached in bsc#1012568)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 19 12:49:38 UTC 2016 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- update runc to the version used in docker 1.12.5 (bsc#1016307).
  This fixes bsc#1015661

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 19 12:17:07 UTC 2016 - asarai@suse.com

- For the moment, we have to switch to using Docker's fork of runC. This *will*
  be solved properly by creating a new package purely for Docker's runC fork,
  because it's quite silly to tie OCI project releases to Docker's vendoring
  scheme. Once this is fixed, this package will be switch to being purely-OCI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 16 17:05:37 UTC 2016 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- add the /usr/bin/docker-run symlink to partially fix bsc#1015661

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  it fails to build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 26 08:59:54 UTC 2016 - asarai@suse.com

- Remove docker-runc symlink because it's been fixed within the Docker
  package. bsc#978260

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 25 17:02:33 UTC 2016 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- Create a symlink /usr/sbin/docker-runc -> /usr/sbin/docker
  Docker expects this symlink to exist bsc#978260

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 25 15:56:00 UTC 2016 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- Remove GOPATH at the end of the GOPATH assignment
  cause GOPATH is empty and if we do that, we get the path ""
  appended, which causes gcc6-go to complain

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 12:27:57 UTC 2016 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- add go_arches in project configuration: this way, we can use the
  same spec file but decide in the project configuration if to
  use gc-go or gcc-go for some archs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 18 10:35:29 UTC 2016 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- use gcc6-go instead of gcc5-go (bsc#988408)

- bump git commit id to the one required by docker v1.12.0 (bsc#995058)
- run unit tests during package build
- remove seccomp-use-pkg-config.patch
  The patch is now upstream.
- remove GO_BUILD_FLAGS macro and substitute with BUILDFLAGS env variable to
  allow for easier string appending.
- only run unit test on architectures that provide the go list and go test tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 17 10:29:15 UTC 2016 - cbrauner@suse.de

- Add runc-test package which contains the source code and the test. This
  package will be used to run the integration tests.
- Simplify package build and check sections: Instead of symlinking we default to
  cp -avr. go list gets confused by symlinks hence, we need to copy the source
  code anyway if we want to run unit tests during package build at some point.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 29 09:03:24 UTC 2016 - asarai@suse.de

* Update to runC 0.1.1. (bsc#989566 FATE#320763) Changelog from upstream:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 19 09:59:05 UTC 2016 - asarai@suse.de

* Don't use gcc-go for aarch64, since gc has grown support for it and is more
  stable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 15 10:46:04 UTC 2016 - asarai@suse.de

* Disable seccomp entirely for aarch64 builds, since it is not provided on all
  SUSE platforms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 27 14:50:32 UTC 2016 - asarai@suse.de

* Added runC man pages.
