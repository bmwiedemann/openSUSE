%description
This library is a asynchronous C implementation of the Raft consensus protocol.
It implements the core Raft algorithm logic, and various drivers are provided
that implement actual network communication and persistent data storage.

The library supports asynchronous or non-blocking I/O engines (such as libuv and
io_uring), although it can be used in threaded or blocking contexts as well.

that implement actual network communication and persistent data storage.

The library supports asynchronous or non-blocking I/O engines (such as libuv and
io_uring), although it can be used in threaded or blocking contexts as well.
This library is a fully asynchronous C implementation of the Raft consensus protocol.

This package contains the files necessary for developing and building applications
using the library.
