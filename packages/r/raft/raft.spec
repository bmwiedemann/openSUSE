%description
This library is a fully asynchronous C implementation of the Raft consensus protocol.

It implements the core Raft algorithm logic and a pluggable interface defining I/O for
networking and persistent storage. The algorithm supports leadership election,
log replication, log compaction, and  membership changes.

A stock implementation of the I/O interface based on libuv is included.
