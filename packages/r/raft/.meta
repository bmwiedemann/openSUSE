  <title>Fully asynchronous C implementation of the Raft consensus protocol</title>
  <description>This library is a fully asynchronous C implementation of the Raft consensus protocol.

It implements the core Raft algorithm logic and a pluggable interface defining I/O for
networking and persistent storage. The algorithm supports leadership election,
log replication, log compaction, and  membership changes.
