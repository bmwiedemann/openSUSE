Sun Sep 16 02:44:51 UTC 2018 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- Updated to version 0.10.0
- Breaking change
  * The match semantics of -w/--word-regexp have changed slightly.
    They used to be \b(?:<your pattern>)\b. Now, it's
    (?:^|\W)(?:<your pattern>)(?:$|\W). This matches the behavior
    of GNU grep and is believed to be closer to the intended
    semantics of the flag. 
- Features
  * Add -U/--multiline flag that permits matching over multiple lines.
  * Add -P/--pcre2 flag that gives support for look-around and
    backreferences.
  * Add --json flag that prints results in a JSON Lines format.
  * --one-file-system flag to skip directories on different file systems.
  * Add --sort and --sortr flag for more sorting. Deprecate --sort-files.
  * The --trim flag strips prefix whitespace from all lines printed.
  * Add --null-data flag, which makes ripgrep use NUL as a line terminator.
  * The --passthru flag now works with the --replace flag.
  * Add --line-buffered and --block-buffered for forcing a buffer strategy.
  * Add --pre-glob for filtering files through the --pre flag.
- Bug fixes
  * Searching with non-zero context can now use memory maps if
    appropriate.
  * ripgrep will now stop correctly when its output pipe is closed.
  * The -w/--word-regexp flag now works more intuitively.
  * Detection of readable stdin has improved on Windows.
  * Matching empty lines now works correctly in several corner cases.
  * Color escape sequences now coalesce, which reduces output size.
  * ripgrep is now more robust with respect to memory maps failing.
  * Color escape sequences are no longer emitted for empty matches.
  * Context from the --passthru flag should not impact process exit status.
  * Fixes bug in ignore crate where first path was always treated
    as a symlink.
  * Read stderr asynchronously when running a process.
  * Add compile time and runtime CPU features to --version output.
  * Don't complete bare pattern after -f in zsh.

    after search results.
