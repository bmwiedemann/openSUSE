- update to ripgrep 13.0.0:
  * A new short flag, -., has been added. It is an alias for the --hidden
    flag, which includes hidden files and directories in search
  * ripgrep is now using a new vectorized implementation of memmem, which
    accelerates many common searches. Please report performance regressions
    (or major improvements).
  * BREAKING: Binary detection output has changed slightly. In this
    release, a tweak has been made to the output format when a
    binary file is detected.

    Previous format:
      Binary file FOO matches (found "\0" byte around offset XXX)

    New format:
      FOO: binary file matches (found "\0" byte around offset XXX)

  * vimgrep output in multi-line now only prints the first line for
    each match. In multi-line mode, --count is now equivalent
    to --count-matches.
  * VULN #1773: public facing issue tracking CVE-2021-3013. ripgrep's README
    now contains a section describing how to report a vulnerability
  * PERF #1657: Check if a file should be ignored first before issuing stat calls
  * PERF memchr#82: ripgrep now uses a new vectorized implementation of memmem
  * FEAT: Added or improved file type filtering for ASP, Bazel, dvc,
    FlatBuffers, Futhark, minified files, Mint, pofiles (from GNU gettext)
    Racket, Red, Ruby, VCL, Yang
  * FEAT #1404: ripgrep now prints a warning if nothing is searched
  * FEAT #1680: Add -. as a short flag alias for --hidden.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 16 02:44:51 UTC 2018 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- Updated to version 0.10.0
- Breaking change
  * The match semantics of -w/--word-regexp have changed slightly.
    They used to be \b(?:<your pattern>)\b. Now, it's
    (?:^|\W)(?:<your pattern>)(?:$|\W). This matches the behavior
    of GNU grep and is believed to be closer to the intended
    semantics of the flag. 
- Features
  * Add -U/--multiline flag that permits matching over multiple lines.
  * Add -P/--pcre2 flag that gives support for look-around and
    backreferences.
  * Add --json flag that prints results in a JSON Lines format.
  * --one-file-system flag to skip directories on different file systems.
  * Add --sort and --sortr flag for more sorting. Deprecate --sort-files.
  * The --trim flag strips prefix whitespace from all lines printed.
  * Add --null-data flag, which makes ripgrep use NUL as a line terminator.
  * The --passthru flag now works with the --replace flag.
  * Add --line-buffered and --block-buffered for forcing a buffer strategy.
  * Add --pre-glob for filtering files through the --pre flag.
- Bug fixes
  * Searching with non-zero context can now use memory maps if
    appropriate.
  * ripgrep will now stop correctly when its output pipe is closed.
  * The -w/--word-regexp flag now works more intuitively.
  * Detection of readable stdin has improved on Windows.
  * Matching empty lines now works correctly in several corner cases.
  * Color escape sequences now coalesce, which reduces output size.
  * ripgrep is now more robust with respect to memory maps failing.
  * Color escape sequences are no longer emitted for empty matches.
  * Context from the --passthru flag should not impact process exit status.
  * Fixes bug in ignore crate where first path was always treated
    as a symlink.
  * Read stderr asynchronously when running a process.
  * Add compile time and runtime CPU features to --version output.
  * Don't complete bare pattern after -f in zsh.
