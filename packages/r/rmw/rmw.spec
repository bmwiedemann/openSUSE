%description
rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a safe-remove utility for the command line. It
can move and restore files to and from directories specified in a
configuration file, and can also be integrated with your regular
desktop trash folder (if your desktop environment uses the
FreeDesktop.org Trash specification). One of the unique features of rmw
is the ability to purge items from your waste (or trash) directories
after x number of days.
