- rmw 0.8.1:
  * the curses menu library is now much more likely to be found on *BSD
  systems
  * bugfix: when attempting to restore a file from a waste folder
  listed in the config file that has a trailing slash, rmw will no
  longer report that the file is not in a waste folder.
  - curses is no longer a requirement (configure -Dwithout-curses=true)
  - removed '-e' command line option ('--empty' option not affected)

- rmw 0.8.0:
  * The config option 'purge_after' has been deprecated and replaced
  with 'expire_age' ('purge_after' will still be accepted, but the user
  will be given a deprecation warning).
  * When '-u' is used, the mrl file will no longer be removed, but
  emptied instead. If a user gives the '-u' option when the mrl file is
  empty, they will get a friendlier message stating that there are no
  items in the list (instead of an error message about the file not
  being found).
  * fixed handling of dot dirs ('.' and '..'). Instead of giving an
  error message and quitting, rmw will print a message stating that
  they'll be skipped.
  * The environmental variable RMWTEST_HOME has been replaced with
  RMW_FAKE_HOME (Trying to use RMWTEST_HOME will give a deprecation
  warning and still work).
  * Expanded the man page and updated the README (improved documentation)
  * Replaced autotools build system with meson
  * rmw now uses the canfigger library for parsing the configuration file.
- disabled a restore test that failed when 'make check' is run with
  superuser privileges
