- rmw 0.9.0:

  - When purging, '-ff' is no longer needed to confirm removal of
    non-writable expired directories and files
  * replace function used to remove directories with rm from FreeBSD;
    Thanks to @DiegoMagdaleno and @dcantrell
  * change message displayed to user when a file being rmw'ed is on a
    filesystem that doesn't haven't a WASTE folder defined
  + Ignore requests to ReMove top-level files, add --top-level-bypass option
    to bypass the protection
  + Ignore requests to ReMove user's home directory
  * bugfix: buffer underflow when calling trim_char() with empty
    string (Thanks to Christopher Wellons)
  * replace valgrind test setup with asan (-fsanitize)
  * the 'ESC' key can now be used to quit the restore file selection menu

- rmw 0.8.1:
  * the curses menu library is now much more likely to be found on *BSD
  systems
  * bugfix: when attempting to restore a file from a waste folder
  listed in the config file that has a trailing slash, rmw will no
  longer report that the file is not in a waste folder.
  - curses is no longer a requirement (configure -Dwithout-curses=true)
  - removed '-e' command line option ('--empty' option not affected)

Sun Jun  28 01:00:00 UTC 2021 - Andy Alt <andy400-dev@yahoo.com>

- rmw 0.8.0:
  * The config option 'purge_after' has been deprecated and replaced
  with 'expire_age' ('purge_after' will still be accepted, but the user
  will be given a deprecation warning).
  * When '-u' is used, the mrl file will no longer be removed, but
  emptied instead. If a user gives the '-u' option when the mrl file is
  empty, they will get a friendlier message stating that there are no
  items in the list (instead of an error message about the file not
  being found).
  * fixed handling of dot dirs ('.' and '..'). Instead of giving an
  error message and quitting, rmw will print a message stating that
  they'll be skipped.
  * The environmental variable RMWTEST_HOME has been replaced with
  RMW_FAKE_HOME (Trying to use RMWTEST_HOME will give a deprecation
  warning and still work).
  * Expanded the man page and updated the README (improved documentation)
  * Replaced autotools build system with meson
  * rmw now uses the canfigger library for parsing the configuration file.
- disabled a restore test that failed when 'make check' is run with
  superuser privileges
