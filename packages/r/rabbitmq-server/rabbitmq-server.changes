Thu Dec  2 15:17:05 UTC 2021 - Fusion Future <qydwhotmail@gmail.com>

- Update to 3.9.11
  * Core Server Bug Fixes
    - When a TLS-enabled listener failed to stop, it logged all of
      its settings which could contain sensitive values.
  * Core Server Enhancements
    - Quorum queues now store commands for enqueued messages in a
      more compact format on disk (some derivative data has been dropped).
    - queue.declare-ok response to AMQP 0-9-1 clients operating on
      a stream could return a ready-for-delivery message count
      value that was out of sync with the stream leader replica.
    - Classic queues now deliver more efficiently on channels that
      had global QoS changed during consumer operation.
  * Prometheus Plugin Enhancements
    - New optional metrics provided by the GET /metrics/detailed
      endpoint. These metrics are cluster-wide, and therefore must
      not be aggregated.
  * Management Agent Plugin Enhancements
    - Disabling the plugin will stop metric collection performed
      periodically by queues, streams, connections, et cetera.
- Changes in 3.9.10:
  * Core Server Bug Fixes
    - Make stream coordinator more defensive to rapid declaration
      and deletion cycles.
  * Core Server Enhancements
    - Several inter-node communication listener settings are now
      exposed to rabbitmq.conf:
      + distribution.listener.port_range.min = 25675
      + distribution.listener.port_range.max = 25675
      + distribution.listener.interface = 192.168.0.1
  * OAuth 2 Plugin Bug Fixes
    - Signing keys specified in rabbitmq.conf were not translated
      correctly, resulting in exceptions during permission checks.
- Drop upstreamed patch
  * harden_rabbitmq-server.service.patch: https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3770

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 19 02:39:00 UTC 2021 - Fusion Future <qydwhotmail@gmail.com>

- Update to 3.9.9:
  * Core Server Bug Fixes
    - Fixed an issue where node monitor could produce a false network
      partition when one of the cluster members was restarted.
    - Message store resiliency improvements.
    - Reduced log noise in certain scenarios where a new queue leader
      is elected.
    - Queue leader rebalancing now logs less.
  * Prometheus Plugin Bug Fixes
    - TLS-enabled Prometheus endpoint listener port was not correctly
      stored internally.
  * Management Plugin Bug Fixes
    - Persistent message count is now displayed correctly on
      individual queue pages.
    - Restore compatibility with IE 11.
  * Consistent Hashing Exchange Plugin Bug Fixes
    - Corrected deletion of duplicate bindings between an exchange
      and a queue.
  * Enhancements
    - Core Server: cluster_formation.target_cluster_size_hint is a
      new configuration setting that can be used to specify expected
      initial cluster size.
    - Prometheus Plugin: Metric rendering efficiency improvements
      (mostly latency).
- Don't install the (now gone) OCF script.
- Refreshed patch:
  * harden_rabbitmq-server.service.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 20 11:17:30 UTC 2021 - Fusion Future <qydwhotmail@gmail.com>

- Update to 3.9.8:
  * Core Server Bug Fixes
    - When the mandatory flag was used when publishing to classic
      queues, but publisher confirms were not, channels memory
      usage would grow indefinitely.
    - rabbitmq-diagnostics memory_breakdown failed to read memory
      of connection reader, writer and channel processes.
    - In some environments, Stream replicas advertised IP
      addresses that could not be reached by cluster peers.
      RabbitMQ node hostnames are now advertised as well so that
      other peers can resolve them to get an externally visible IP
      address.
  * Prometheus Plugin Enhancements
    - More data is exposed via the GET /metrics/detailed endpoint.
  * Management Plugin Bug Fixes
    - When setting topic permissions, the list of exchanges in the
      UI now honors the currently selected virtual host.
  * AWS Peer Discovery Plugin Enhancements
    - The plugin now logs more details for failed AWS API
      requests.
  * Web STOMP Plugin Enhancements
    - STOMP-over-WebSockets connections now can consume from
      streams.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 24 10:53:58 UTC 2021 - Fusion Future <qydwhotmail@gmail.com>

- Update to 3.9.7:
  + All Components
    * All bytecode is now compiled using the +deterministic
      compiler flag. This should eliminate the capture of some
      irrelevant build environment attributes in produced
      artifacts, improve consistency between builds, and reduce the
      file level diff between release artifacts.
  + Core Server
    * Enhancements
      - Classic queue shutdown now uses a much higher timeout (up
        to 10 minutes instead of 30 seconds).
      - In environments with many queues (especially mirrored
        queues) and many consumers this means that the chance of
        queue indices rebuilding after node restart is now
        substantially lower.
    * Bug Fixes
      - Quorum queues no longer leak memory and disk space when a
        consumer is repeatedly added and cancelled on an empty
        queue.
  + Prometheus Plugin
    * Enhancements
      - More configurability for metrics exposed via the Prometheus
        endpoint.
  + Shovel Plugin
    * Bug Fixes
      - Shovel URIs could be logged with credentials in some
        scenarios.
  + Dependency Upgrades
    * observer_cli has been upgraded from 1.6.2 to 1.7.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 17 00:15:42 UTC 2021 - Fusion Future <qydwhotmail@gmail.com>

- Update to 3.9.6:
  + Core Server
    * Bug Fixes
      - TLS information delivered in Proxy protocol header is now
        attached to connection metrics as if it was provided by a
        non-proxying client.
      - max_message_size had a one-off error in the validator.
      - mirroring_sync_batch_size was incorrectly validated as if
        it represented batch size in bytes.
  + Stream Plugin
    * Bug Fixes
      - Offset parameters were not stored correctly in some cases.
      - Partitions list order is now stable.
      - When stream clients close connections abruptly, publisher
        and consumer metrics get cleaned up correctly.
  + Management Plugin
    * Enhancements
      - Stream publishers are now listed on the individual stream
        page.
      - Counters have been added to the tiles of several sections
        on detail pages.
  + Dependency Upgrades
    * Osiris was upgraded to 1.2.0
    * Ranch was upgraded to 2.1.0
- Removes socat dependency from specs.
  (gh#rabbitmq/rabbitmq-packaging#8)
- Fix rpmlint errors:

        from definitions.
      - Reduced unnecessary debug logging from streams.
  + AWS Peer Discovery Plugin
    * Enhancements
      - AWS API calls are now retried multiple times.
  + Management Plugin
    * Enhancements
      - PUT /api/vhosts/{name} now can update metadata (tags and
        descriptions) for existing virtual hosts.

Tue May 11 23:02:52 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to RabbitMQ 3.8.16
 * This is the first release to drop support for Erlang 22.3 and
   introduce support for the upcoming Erlang 24 release
 * AWS Peer Discovery Plugin was unintentionally excluded from the
   distribution in 3.8.15 and has now been added back.
 * Management Plugin: Messaging polling HTTP API endpoint leaked
   temporary connections it used in case of a polling timeout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 10:29:26 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to RabbitMQ 3.8.15
  * Fixed quorum queues did not take snapshots as frequently as they
    are expected to with some configurations.
  * Fixed quorum queue name was unintentionally limited: the length
    of virtual host and actual queue name was limited to 254 characters
  * Fixed deleting a quorum queue would leave some of its internal
    metrics data around.
  * Client destination address is now obtained w.r.t. the Proxy
    protocol settings.
  * Full changes:
    https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.15
- Update to RabbitMQ 3.8.14
  * Fixed direct reply-to failed witn an exception on Erlang 22.3
- Update to RabbitMQ 3.8.13
  * Fixed nodes that had an unusually long name could overflow
    message property lengths with the direct reply-to identifier
    they generated.
- Update to RabbitMQ 3.8.12
  * Maintenance mode no longer transfers leaders of classic mirrored
    queue.
  * Exclusive queues that happen to be matched by classic queue
    mirroring policies will no longer be considered for rebalancing
    operations since they are not actually mirrored
  * Default replica count for quorum queues was using an incorrect
    configuration key name. The default value is now 3, so in a
    cluster of five or seven nodes, only three will host replicas
    for newly declared quorum queues.
  * Default runtime busy waiting settings were changed to none by
    default, which reduces CPU footprint on nodes that are mostly idle.
  * Definition import now imports runtime parameters after exchanges,
    queues, and bindings to reduce the likelihood of starting dynamic
    Shovels from racing with topology imports.
  * Fixed memory monitor could run into an exception if queried very
    early on node boot before it was fully initialized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  4 03:15:39 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Remove recipe parts for SUSE 11.x, since that does not build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  1 03:31:44 PM UTC 2021 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Update to RabbitMQ 3.8.11

  * Quorum queues that had active consumers during a rolling
    cluster upgrade could run into an exception and restart loop.

  * Nodes that had reverse_dns_lookup set to true could not accept
    client connections.

- Update to RabbitMQ 3.8.10

  * This release deprecates boot time definition import build into
    the management plugin.

  * Repeated polling of a quorum queue with basic.get that yielded
    an empty response could result in an unbounded growth of log
    segment files on on disk.

  * RabbitMQ core plugin activation was revisited to be closer to
    that of 3.7.x. This does not any related improvements w.r.t.
    definition import, e.g. those introudced in RabbitMQ 3.8.6.

  * Syslog dependency was not started correctly. This meant no log
    messages were sent to Syslog.

  * rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_node_is_quorum_critical returned
    a false positive for a node marked for maintenance.

  * Queues could update their internal bookkeeping state
    incorrectly in some cases, leading to a file_handle_cache
    operation exception.

  * Quorum queues now can use the reject-publish max length
    overflow strategy.

  * Quorum queues now support consumer priority.

  * Per-user connection and queue limits. This is similar to
    per-vhost limits but, as the name suggests, these limits are
    associated for a given user.

  * TLSv1.3 is no longer considered experimental (on Erlang 23) and
    excluded from TLS listener configuration.

  * When a node is put under maintenance, it will now stop all
    local quorum queue replicas after completing leadership
    transfer. This means that no quorum queue replicas on the node
    will be considered for leader elections.

  * Nodes now keep track of failed client authentication attempts
    and expose it as a metric via both the Prometheus endpoint and
    the HTTP API at GET /api/auth/attempts/{node}.

  * bypass_pem_cache is a new configuration key that makes it
    possible to disable the cache of PEM files used by the Erlang
    TLS implementation. This rotated certificates quicker to detect
    for nodes but can also increase latency for inbound TLS
    connections, e.g. under high connection churn scenarios.

  * Definition import now safely handles some missing queue object
    arguments.

  * rabbitmq.conf schema now allows for peer certificate chain
    verification depth to be set to zero. When this value is used,
    peer certificate must be signed by a trusted CA certificate
    directly in order for the verification to pass.

  * RABBITMQ_IO_THREAD_POOL_SIZE will no longer be respected by
    RabbitMQ nodes. It is no longer relevant with supported Erlang
    versions and will simplify rabbitmq-diagnostics
    runtime_thread_stats output.

  * The +K runtime parameter is no longer used by RabbitMQ nodes as
    it has no effect with supported Erlang versions.

- Update to 3.8.4
- RabbitMQ 3.8.4 is a maintenance release.
- Full release notes: https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.4
- RabbitMQ 3.8.4 is a maintenance release.
- This release requires Erlang/OTP 21.3 or later.
  22.3 or 23.0 series is recommended.
- This is the first release to officially support Erlang 23. Compared to 3.8.3, which
  generally works as expected on Erlang 23, Prometheus monitoring plugin had to
  be adapted to support a memory allocator metric format that has changed compared to
  earlier Erlang releases.
  There is one remaining known Erlang 23 incompatibility: rabbitmq-diagnostics observer will fail on Erlang 23.
  This will be addressed in a future release.
  The root cause is the same memory allocator metric change.

  mitigate breakage in 3.6.16 change)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 10 12:46:56 UTC 2018 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 3.6.16 (bsc#1109991):
  Bug fixes:
  + Queue master locator min-masters incorrectly calculated the number of masters.
  + Maximum supported number of queue priorities (255) is now enforced
  Enhancements:
  + queue.delete operations will now force delete queues that don't have a promotable master
  + Lock contention in internal database is now much lower when a node with a lot of exclusive queues
shuts down or is otherwise considered to be unavailable by peers
  + Default max number of channels allowed on a connection (a.k.a. channel_max) has been lowered from 65535 to 2047.
The new default is much safer and will reduce the effect application channel leaks have on node resource consumption. This is a potentially breaking change.

Wed Apr  5 08:16:09 UTC 2017 - vuntz@suse.com

- Stop shipping rabbitmq-server OCF resource agent as source file
  while it's included in the upstream tarball. Add patches for code
  that was specific to our variant; they now got upstreamed, but
  are not in this version of rabbitmq yet: pull-request-20.patch
  and pull-request-21.patch.
- Also package the rabbitmq-server-ha OCF resource agent as it
  seems to be more appropriate for clustering. Add upstream fixes
  for making it more solid: pull-request-24.patch and
  pull-request-25.patch.
- Ship an example of /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf, as this is
  useful indication. It only contains commented examples, based on
  what the Debian package is doing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 15 13:09:26 UTC 2017 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Cleanup file list and prepare merging the plugins package into
  the main package:
  - No longer create parts of the filelist in %install
  - Only exclude the plugins starting with rabbitmq_* and not all
    files in the plugin dir. Some of the files are basic libraries
    needed to even launch rabbitmq. (boo#1025442)
- in the tmpfiles.d file: make the directory group owned
- own the run dir in the non systemd case

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 13 10:54:43 UTC 2017 - mrueckert@suse.de

Mon Feb  6 15:32:24 UTC 2017 - mrueckert@suse.de

- IMPORTANT CHANGE

  Require the epmd service instead of running our own version as
  rabbitmq user.

  This requires that you configure epmd to listen on more
  interfaces than just 127.0.0.1.

  For non systemd based distributions you can set EPMD_ADDRESSES in
  /etc/sysconfing/erlang.

  For systemd based distributions please follow
  /usr/share/doc/packages/erlang/README.SUSE

  IMPORTANT CHANGE

  This change is also documented in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/rabbitmq-server/README.SUSE

- update to 3.5.1
  This release adds support for priority queues which were available
  as a plugin before. Performance is improved; in particular messages
  smaller than configurable size are embedded in the queue index to
  reduce I/O and memory consumption. Stability of clustering and
  autoheal partition handling is improved as well. A new
  pause_if_all_down partition handling mode is added. The management
  web UI now shows many more I/O statistics.

  This release also corrects a number of defects in the broker and
  plugins, as well as introducing many smaller new features and
  improvements.

- Add ocf-fixes.patch to fix issues in the OCF file:
  - use the wrapper function to call rabbitmqctl for stop, so that
    we interpret correctly the exit code.
  - accept 1 as valid exit code from "rabbitmqctl status", instead
    of totally breaking when we get it.
- We use a patch as the OCF file comes from upstream, so it's
  better to keep the changes isolated.

    of clustering, adds support for per-message TTL, introduces
    plugins for web-STOMP and MQTT, and adds many smaller new
    features and bug fixes.
