 RabbitMQ and EPMD
===================

RabbitMQ requires epmd to listen on more interfaces than just localhost.
The easiest solution is to set the listening address to "0.0.0.0". But
you can also limit it to certain interfaces/IPs.

For non systemd based distributions you can set EPMD_ADDRESSES in
/etc/sysconfing/erlang.

For systemd based distributions please follow
/usr/share/doc/packages/erlang/README.SUSE
