  <title>INI file reader and writer</title>
  <description>This is a native Ruby package for reading and writing INI files.
Although made popular by Windows, INI files can be used on any system thanks
to their flexibility. They allow a program to store configuration data, which
can then be easily parsed and changed. Two notable systems that use the INI
format are Samba and Trac.

An initialization file, or INI file, is a configuration file that contains
configuration data for Microsoft Windows based applications. Starting with
Windows 95, the INI file format was superseded but not entirely replaced by
a registry database in Microsoft operating systems.
