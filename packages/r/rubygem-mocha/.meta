  <title>A library for mocking and stubbing using a syntax like that of JMock</title>
  <description>Mocha is a library for mocking and stubbing using a syntax like that of JMock.

It can be used with many testing frameworks e.g. Test::Unit, RSpec, test/spec,
expectations, Dust, MiniTest and even JtestR.

Mocha provides a unified, simple and readable syntax for both traditional
mocking and partial mocking.</description>
