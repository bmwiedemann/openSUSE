- updated to version 1.0.0
 ### External changes
 * Assume 'mocha' has been required when requiring 'mocha/setup'.
 * Provide shortcuts for integrating with specific test library i.e. `require 'mocha/test_unit'` or `require 'mocha/mini_test'`
 as alternatives to `require 'mocha/setup'`.
 * Do not automatically try to integrate with test libraries. Since the automatic test library integration functionality
 requires the test library to be loaded and this doesn't usually happen until *after* the bundle is loaded, it makes things
 simpler if we use `require 'mocha/setup'` to explicitly setup Mocha when we know the test library has been loaded. Fixes #146 & #155.
 * Consider stubs on superclasses if none exist on primary receiver. Largely based on changes suggested by @ccutrer in #145.
 Note: this may break existing tests which rely on the old behaviour. Stubbing a superclass method and then invoking that
 method on a child class would previously cause an unexpected invocation error. By searching up through the inheritance
 hierarchy for each of the delegate mock objects, we can provide more intuitive behaviour. Instead of an unexpected invocation
 error, invoking the method on the child class will cause the stubbed method on the superclass to be used.
 * Avoid recursion when constructing unexpected invocation message. Fixes #168.
 * Add explanation of method dispatch. Heavily based on the relevant jMock v1 documentation. Fixes #172.
 * Make class_eval line number more accurate. This sets the line number as the line number of the `def` statement. Closes #169.
 * Allow nesting of `responds_with` parameter matcher. Closes #166.
 * Define `Mocha` module before it's referenced. The test helper defines a class `TestCase` within the `Mocha` module. When
 running the tests inside the bundle, the `Mocha` module happens to be defined at this point. However when running the tests outside the bundle, it is not defined and so an exception is raised: `uninitialized constant Mocha (NameError)`. Fixes #163.
 * Document lack of thread-safety. Fixes #154.
 * Document how to use the build-matrix script. Fixes #160.
 * Stubbing non-public method should use same visibility. This will probably break some existing tests that were somehow relying
 on the stubbed method being public while the original method was protected or private. Fixes #150.
 
 ### Internal changes
 * Use lastest Rubygems in Travis CI builds.
 * Run the standard test suite against Ruby 2.1.0 in the build matrix.
 * Run integration tests against Ruby 2.0.0 with latest Test::Unit gem in the build matrix.
 * Test::Unit is not available in Ruby v1.9.3 standard library, so remove it from the build matrix.
 * Force use of Test::Unit runner, etc in relevant integration tests. Prior to this, I don't think we were really testing the
 Mocha integration with Test::Unit much, because, although `TestUnitTest` was a subclass of `Test::Unit::TestCase`, the
 important test case instances are the temporary ones built by `TestRunner#run_as_test` et al. Prior to this change, these
 would only have used Test::Unit where MiniTest was not available *at all* i.e. only in early versions of Ruby and when the
 MiniTest gem was not loaded.
 * Reset environment variables between build matrix builds.
 * Only activate integration with relevant test library for each of the integration tests.
 * Include standard build combinations from Travis CI config i.e. builds using standard library versions of test libraries.
 * Fix `build-matrix.rb` script. Also use `.travis.yml` to decide what combinations to run. This means we
 can now simulate the Travis CI build locally and avoid duplication. Fixes #157.
 * Remove Ruby version map from build matrix script. I'm using the `rbenv-aliases` plugin to alias minor versions to the
 relevant patch version.

Wed May 15 03:53:05 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 0.14.0
 * Official support for MiniTest v5. All tests now pass on the continuous integration build.
 * Add speculative support for Minitest v5. Due to incompatibilities it has not yet been possible to run the Mocha test suite against Minitest v5. However, @zenspider (author of Minitest) provided the patch and he has tested it against Rails v4. Fixes #156. Thanks to @zenspider.
 * Documentation updates.

- update to 0.9.8
  * Fixed bug "NameError raised when using Mocha as a Rails plug-in" 
    - http://floehopper.lighthouseapp.com/projects/22289/tickets/53. 
    Since 0.9.6 the Rails plugin has been broken. See bug report for
    details. You will need to explicitly load Mocha *after* the test
    framework has been loaded, e.g. by adding "require 'mocha'" at the
    bottom of test/test_helper.rb.
  * Make Mocha::ParameterMatchers#regexp_matches, #includes,
    #has_value, #has_key more robust. Thanks to Sander Hartlage.
  * Allow passing a block to Mocha::Configuration methods to only
    change configuration for the duration of the block. Thanks to Dan
    Manges.
  * Fixed bug "doc generation fails in 0.9.7 gem" -
    http://floehopper.lighthouseapp.com/projects/22289/tickets/51.
  * Remove rdoc template incorporating google analytics from source
    control. The file just needs to exist locally and be ignored by
    source control. This should stop the warning showing up on
    e.g. RunCodeRun build results.

- update to 0.9.7

  * Added support for ‘test-unit’ gem (version >= 2.0).
  * Stop requiring rubygems
  * Renamed Mocha::Standalone to Mocha::API to better reflect its purpose.
  * Fix exception raised by HasEntry#matches?
  * Fixes for MiniTest and Ruby 1.9.1

- update to 0.9.5
- Changelog:
  * Fixed Lighthouse bug 32 - stub_everything should mean mock
    responds to anything.
  * Added Expectation#twice to improve readability. Tthanks 
    to pull request from Celestino Gomes.
  * In Ruby 1.9, requiring ‘test/unit’ loads a thin wrapper around 
    MiniTest and Test::Unit::TestCase ends up inheriting from 
    MiniTest::Unit::TestCase. So we need to avoid including the 
    Mocha modules more than once to avoid nasty consequences. 
    Thanks to Matthias Hennemeyer for help with this.
  * Ruby 1.9 includes rake, but not rake/contrib. For the moment 
    I‘ve moved the sshpublisher require into the only rake task 
    that needs it, so that I can at least run the tests in 
    Ruby 1.9. It looks like I will need to build a rake/contrib
    gem or similar to get this working properly
