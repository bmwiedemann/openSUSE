- updated to version 3.2.4

* lots of improvements and bugfixes. See ChangeLog for the full list

* title messages are now also searched in graphics artwork directory;
  those found in graphics directory have precendence over those found
  in level directory -- this handles title messages stored in graphics
  directories as part of the artwork set, just like title images; this
  makes sense, as corresponding special font definitions for messages
  are usually defined in the same graphics artwork directory, and also
  because title images and title messages that are combined in a level
  set introduction should usually not be separated when the level set
  is used with a different artwork set (e.g. using "override graphics")
* added use of hashes created from static lists (element tokens, image
  config, font tokens) to speed up lookup of configuration parameters
* added "busy" animation when initializing program and loading artwork
* added initialization profiling for program startup (debugging only)
* added graphics engine directive "border.draw_masked_when_fading" that
  enables/disables drawing of border mask over screen that is just faded
* added additional configuration directives for setup screen draw offset
  menu.draw_xoffset.SETUP[XXX] and menu.draw_yoffset.SETUP[XXX] with XXX
  in GAME, EDITOR, GRAPHICS, SOUND, ARTWORK, INPUT, SHORTCUTS_1,
  SHORTCUTS_2, CHOOSE_ARTWORK, CHOOSE_OTHER (where "CHOOSE_ARTWORK" is
  used to define draw offset on custom artwork selection screens and
  "CHOOSE_OTHER" is used on all other list style selection screens, like
  choosing game speed or screen mode for fullscreen mode)
* added eight pure decoration graphic definitions for the game panel
* added support for accessing native Diamond Caves II level packages
* added game panel control to display arbitrary elements on game panel
* added game panel control to display custom element score (globally
  unique for identical custom elements) either as value or as element
* added ".draw_masked" and ".draw_order" to game panel control drawing
* added displaying of gravity state (on/off) as new game panel control
* added animation for game panel elements (similar to game elements)
* added new pseudo game mode "PANEL" to define panel fonts and graphics
  - panel fonts now use ".PANEL" suffix instead of ".PLAYING" suffix
  - panel graphics now use ".PANEL" suffix instead of ".DOOR" suffix
  (else graphics would have to use ".PLAYING", which would be confusing)
* added attribute ".tile_size" for element style game panel controls
* added <space> key as additional valid key to use for confirm requester
* improved menu fading, adding separate fading definitions for entering
  and leaving a "content" screen (in general), and optional definitions
  for the special "content" screens SCORES, EDITOR, INFO and PLAYING
* added (currently invisible) setup option to define scroll delay value
* added option "game.forced_scroll_delay_value" to override user choice
  of scroll delay value for certain level sets with "graphicsinfo.conf"
* replaced setup option "scroll delay: on/off" by new setup option that
  directly allows selecting the desired scroll delay value from 0 to 8
* added displaying of most game panel control elements (not animated)
* added new configuration directives to display additional game engine
  values on the game control panel, like the following examples:
  - game.panel.time_hh/time_mm/time_ss	- level time in HH/MM/SS format
  - game.panel.penguins			- number of penguins to rescue
  - game.panel.level_name		- level name of current level
* added support for preview tile sizes "1" and "2" (1x1 and 2x2 pixels)
* added new player option "no centering when relocating" for "invisible"
  teleportations to level areas that look exactly the same, giving the
  illusion that the player did not relocate at all (this was the default
  since 3.2.3, but caused visual problems with room creation in "Zelda")
* added new menu fading effect "melt", shamelessly stolen from "DOOM"
* improved menu fading, adding separate fading definitions for entering
  and leaving a menu and for fading between menu and "content" screens
* improved menu fading, adding separate fading definitions for fading
  between menu screens and fading between menu and "destination" screens
* titlemessage_initial_x and titlemessage_x set to "[DEFAULT]" in static
  configuration (set from "[titlemessage_initial]" and "[titlemessage]")
* fading settings of "[titlemessage_initial]" and "[titlemessage]" set
  to "[DEFAULT]" in static configuration (set from "[title_initial]" and
  "[title]")
* improved title fading, allowing fading animation types "none", "fade"
  and "crossfade" (including cross-fading of last title to main menu)
