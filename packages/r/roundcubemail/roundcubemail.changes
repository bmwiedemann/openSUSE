- Modify roundcubemail-httpd.conf for OpenSuSE v.13.1 apache2
    o Apache2 on OpenSuSE v.13.1 has the mod_access_compat.c module
      statically compiled into the Apache2 core. This means it can't
      be unloaded and the older pre-2.4 access directives must be 
      used. Since it is not advised to mix pre and post 2.4 access
      methods the file had to be modified to look for this static
      module and load pre-2.4 directives if found on Apache 2.4. It
      should be forward compatible if the mod_access_compat.c module
      become dynamic in the future and is not loaded.
