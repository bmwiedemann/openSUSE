  <title>The enhanced syslogd for Linux and Unix</title>
  <description>Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd supporting, among others,
MySQL, syslog/tcp, RFC 3195, permitted sender lists, filtering on any
message part, and fine grain output format control. It is quite
compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in replacement.
Its advanced features make it suitable for enterprise-class, encryption
protected syslog relay chains while at the same time being very easy to
setup for the novice user.</description>
