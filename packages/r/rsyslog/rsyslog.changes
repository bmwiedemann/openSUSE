- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2110.0:
  * 2021-10-13: config bugfix: global(security.abortonidresolutionfail=) did not work
    when used with rscript based configuration, it was not checked.
  * 2021-10-13: config bugfix: global param $privDropToUser did not work correctly
    The parameter was not implemented for rscript based configuration and
    did not properly apply to legacy configuration. In essence, it almost always
    did not work as expected.
    see also: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4642
    see also: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/commit/cbcaf2c7e5b67e5465e47bc7cc67af2eae47bd31
  * 2021-10-12: rscript bugfix: ruleset called async when ruleset had queue.type="direct"
    The call rscript statement is able to call a rule set either synchronously or
    asynchronously. We did this, because practice showed that both modes
    are needed. For various reasons we decided to make async
    calls if the ruleset has a queue assigned and sync if not.
    To know if a "queue is assigned" we just checked if queue parameters were
    given. It was overlookeded the case of someone explicitly specifying a
    "direct  queue", aka "no queue". As such, queue="direct" triggered async
    calls. That in turn meant that when a write operation to a variable was
    made inside that rule set, other rulesets could or could not see the
    write. While if was often not seen, this was a data race where the
    change could also be seen by the outside.
    This is now fixed. No matter if queue.type="direct" is specified or
    left out, the call will always by synchronous. Any values written to
    variables will also be seen by the "outside world" in later processing
    stages.
    Note that this has some potential to BREAK EXISTING CONFIGURATIONS.
    We deem this acceptable because:
    1. this was racy at all, so unexpected behaviour could alwas occur
    2. it is actually unlikely that someone used the triggering conditions
       in practice. But we can not outrule this, especially when the
       configuration was auto-generated.
    Potential compatibility issues can be solved by defining a small
    array-memory queue on the ruleset in question instead of specifying
    direct type.
    Again, we expect that almost all users will never experience any
    problems. If you do, however, please let us know: we may add an
    option to re-enable the bug.
  * 2021-10-12: ksi bugfix: locking bug fixed in rsksiCtxOpenFile

    Thanks to Orgad Shaneh for the patch.
  * 2021-10-11: mkubernetes bugfix: no connection retry to kubernetes APP
    When connection to the kubernates API was not possible, mmkubernetes
    did not retry. This does now happen via regular rsyslog retry
    mechanism.
    Thanks to github user jayme-github for the analysis and patch.

  * 2021-10-11: openssl bugfix: Correct gnutlsPriorityString (custom ciphers) behaviour
    * Only apply default anon ciphers if gnutlsPriorityString is NULL and
      Authentication Mode is set to anon. Otherwise we do not set them
      as they overwrite custom Ciphers.
    * Added two tests for custom cipher configuration (anon/certvalid mode).
    * Add call for applyGnutlsPriorityString if gnutlsPriorityString changes.
    * Merged openssl init code from Connect into osslInitSession
    closes: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4686
  * 2021-10-11: build issue: handle undefined MAXPATHLEN, PATH_MAX
    While we handled missing PATH_MAX, we did not handle missing MAXPATHLEN.
    This happens under GNU/Hurd, because there is no official limit. However,
    extremely long pathes are extremely uncommon, so we do not want to
    use slow dynamic alloc each time we need to build pathes. So we
    impose a limit of 4KiB, which should be fairly enough. Note that
    this obviously increases stack requirements in GNU/Hurd.
    As suggested by Michael Biebl, we have now implemented a generic
    approach to handle this via autoconf.
  * 2021-09-12: openssl: extended output information on connection failure
    Now includes the remote client/server IP address in the log output.
  * 2021-09-12: imhttp enhancements - query parameter ingestion & basic auth support
    * Basic Authentication support & tests
      * configured via imhttp option "basicAuthFile". This option should be configured
        to point to your htpasswd file generated via a standard htpasswd tool.
      tests:
      * imhttp-post-payload-basic-auth.sh
      * imhttp-post-payload-basic-auth-vg.sh
    * Query parameter ingestion capability & tests
      use t `addmetadata` option to inject query parameters into
      metadata for imhttp input.
    DISTRO PACKAGERS BEWARE: NEW DEPENDENCY FOR IMHTTP:
    libaprutil (libaprutil1-dev on debian'ish, apr-util-devel on Red Hat)
    Thanks to Nelson Yen for the patch.
  * 2021-09-07: testbench bugfix: privdrop tests under root user did not work
    When running under root, the privdrop tests did not properly work. This
    patch fixes the issue and skips test where necessary.
    This also includes some modernization of the related tests.
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4619
  * 2021-09-07: core/ratelimiting: fix rate limiting for already parsed messages
    Rate limiting may not have worked if the considered message had already
    been parsed (not having NEEDS_PARSING in msgFlags).
    This affects also imuxsock in its default configuration
    (useSpecialParser="true" and ratelimit.severity="1")
  * 2021-09-07: core bugfix: use of property $wday terminates string
    When $wday is used inside a template, all template parts after it
    are ignored. For exmaple:
    template(name="json_filename" type="string" string="/var/log/%$wday%.log")
    would generate something like "/var/log/0" - the ".log" part would be
    missing. For the same reason, $wday can not reliably checked in script
    filters.
    Thanks to Alain Thivillon for reporting the bug and providing an
    excellent analysis, which essentiellay was exactly this fix here.
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4670
  * 2021-09-07: core/queue bugfix: potential misadressing when queue discarded messages
    When a discard mark was set, the queue was very busy and discarded messages, a
    NULL pointer access could happen. Depending on circumstances, several problems
    could occur, including a SEGFAULT. This is now fixed.
    closes: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4437
  * 2021-09-07: imdiga bugfix: iOverallQueueSize calculation could be incorrect
    This issue only affects testbench and rsyslog development debugging. The active
    messages counter, used for synchronizing test steps, went wrong when the queue
    discarded messages on it's consumer thread. Now fixed.
  * 2021-09-06: gnutls driver: SAN priority did not work correctly on server side
    PrioritizeSAN was not propagated when accepting a new connection, this is now fixed.
    Thanks to Attila Lakatos for the patch.
  * 2021-08-24: config: implement script-equavalent for $PrivDrop* statements

- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2108.0:
  * 2021-08-16: openssl tls: Improved error message output on tls failures.
    closes: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4645
  * 2021-08-16: impstats: add percentile metrics tracking functionality
    Brief overview:
    TO configure tracking percentile metrics in rainerscript:
    User would need to define:
      - which percentile to track, such as [p50, p99, etc.]
      - window size - note, this correlates directly with memory usage to
      track the percentiles.
    To track a value, user would call built-in function `percentile_observe()` in their configurations to
    record an integer value, and percentile metrics would be emitted every
    impstats interval.
    Thanks to Nelson Yen for the patch.
  * 2021-08-12: imfile: add parameter "ignoreolderthanoption"
    instructs imfile not to ingest a file that has not been modified in the
    specified number of seconds.
    Thanks to github user yanjunli76 for the patch (submitted from Nelson Yen)
  * 2021-08-10: imklog bugfix: invalid memory adressing, could cause abort
    This is a regeression from commit 94c4a87. It introduced a free() call
    using an object that was no longer valid (the main pointer to the
    to-be-freed object) was already freed at time of use. This could
    cause various issues, including a segfault.
    Note: this bug was triggerred only during late phase of rsyslog
    shutdown, so it did not affect regular operation.
    Special thanks to github user wxiaoguang for analyzing the issue
    and providing a draft fix proposal, on which this patch builds.
    see also https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/4629
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4625
  * 2021-08-09: imfile bugfix: deleteStateOnFileDelete missed some state files
    When the log file is deleted, imfile would attempt to delete the statefile but it
    was missing the file_id part of the statefile name. This means the statefiles were
    only removed in the log file was less than 512 characters, because for very small
    files the file ID hash is not created. This lead to some state files not being
    deleted.
    Thanks to pearseimperva for the patch.
  * 2021-08-09: imfile bugfix: hash char invalidly added in readmode != 0
    If imfile is ingesting log files with readMode set to 2 or 1, the resulting
    messages all have a '#' character at the end. This patch corrects the behaviour.
    Note: if some external script "supported" the bug of extra hash character at
    the end of line, it may be necessary to update them.
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4491
  * 2021-08-09: omelasticsearch bugfix: errorFile mutex was not consistently locked
    Lock the file during SIGHUPs to avoid issues with concurrent accesses by
    writeDataError().
    Thanks to François Poirotte for the patch.
  * 2021-08-09: imudp: add socket type (IPv4 vs. 6) to input name
    Most importantly, the input name is used for stats counter names as
    well. Previously, the same name was used for IPv4 and IPv6, so we had
    two counters with an equal name. That left users puzzled.
    Unfortunately, this change can potentially require changes to existing
    analysis scripts, as the name is now slightly different.
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4364
  * 2021-08-06: omfwd: add capability for action-specific TLS certificate settings
    This permits to override the global definitions for TLS certificates
    at the action() level.
  * 2021-08-06: imfile bugfix: file handle leak if "freshStartTail" was turned on
  * 2021-08-05: imtcp: permit to use different certificate files per input/action
    This completes the ability to override global/default TLS settings at the imtcp
    input() level. Support for using multiple CAs/Certs per Connection is now provided.
  * 2021-08-04: imptcp bugfix: keep alive interval was incorrectly set
    The interval was accidentally set to keep alive interval. This has been
    corrected.
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4609
  * 2021-07-08: openssl network driver bugfix: small memory leak
    Fixes a static, non-growing memory leak which existed when parameter
    "GnutTLSPriorityString" was used. This was primarily a cosmetic issue,
    but caused some grief during development in regard to memory leak
    detectors.
    Note: yes, this is for openssl -- the parameter name is historical.
  * 2021-07-07: psrv bugfix: abort if no listener could be started
    Modules (like imtcp and imdiag) which use tcpsrv could abort or
    otherwise malfunction if no listener for a specific input could
    be started.
    Found during implementing a new feature, no report from practice.
    But could very well happen.
  * 2021-07-07: mmkubernetes bugfix: apiserver error handling
    - Added graceful handling of apiserver errors with unexpected responses,
      i.e., anything other than 200, 404, or 429. Idea is that apiserver
      transient error state will recover. We don't want mmkubernetes to miss
      metadata resolution for containers that don't have cached metadata.
      During these transient error states, mmkubernetes will provide basic
      container file path based resolution of namespace and pod metadata for
      new pods whose metadata is not yet cached. After this error state
      recovers, mmkubernetes is expected to resume its metadata resolution as
      expected.
    - Added a unit test case for apiserver return 500 with changes to mock server
    -  Fixed existing unit test that was failing due to missing expected results file
    -  Added mmkubernetes unit tests to testbench
    Thanks to Abdul Waheed for the patch (submitted from Nelson Yen).
  * 2021-07-07: ommongodb bugfixes
    - Fix Segmentation fault when server is down
    - Add server connexion check while resuming
    Thanks to Kevin Guillemot for the patch.
  * 2021-06-28: omkafka improvements
    - drain librdkafka queues and retry later during rsyslog restart or hup. This
      re-injects messages into rsyslog's native queues.
    - add statsname on per kafka instance for better visibility
    - omkafka - count errors related ssl as "errors_ssl"
    Thanks to Nelson Yen for the patch.
  * 2021-06-23: some CI/QA improvements, Travis-CI disabled
    For the time being, Travis CI is disabled because it was outdated and Travis also
    changed their system. We will re-evaluate if we re-enable it. Since quite a while
    the Travits tests were redundant with the rest of CI, so this does not reduce
    coverage.
  * 2021-06-23: omhttp bugfix: dynrestpath param in batch mode invalid
    When batchmode was used, the templates could not be used to
    expand dynrestpath. We are now storing the restpath param
    within the batch data if we are in batch mode.
    When we are in batch mode, and the restpath value changes, the
    batch is submitted and reinitialized
    closes: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4567
  * 2021-06-17: add predefined template RSYSLOG_SyslogRFC5424Format
    This is essentially the same as RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format with
    a better name and a fix to remove the unnecessary LF at the end of
    the message.
    The different name also enables us to fix the LF issue without
    any concern about backwards compatibility.
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4384
  * 2021-06-17: impstats/bugfix: _sender_stats reports integer counter as string
    Note that this introduces a small backwards incompatibility: in previous output
    the field was of string type, now it is integer (as intended). We discussed this
    on the mailing list and the overwhelming thought was that this is not a problem
    because almost all analysis backends are able to cover that format change. This made
    the bugfix essentially costmetic.
    HOWEVER, if you still experience issues, please let us know. We can add an option
    to provide the previous format, and just spared to do so because there was no

Tue Jun 15 17:42:39 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2106.0:
  * NOTE: the prime new feature is support for TLS and non-TLS connections
    via imtcp in parallel. Furthermore, most TLS parameters can now be overriden
    at the input() level. The notable exceptions are certificate files, something
    that is due to be implemented as next step.
  * 2021-06-14: new global option "parser.supportCompressionExtension"
    This permits to turn off rsyslog's single-message compression extension
    when it interferes with non-syslog message processing (the parser
    subsystem expects syslog messages, not generic text)
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4598
  * 2021-05-12: imtcp: add more override config params to input()
    It is now possible to override all module parameters at the input() level. Module
    parameters serve as defaults. Existing configs need no modification.
  * 2021-05-06: imtcp: add stream driver parameter to input() configuration
    This permits to have different inputs use different stream drivers
    and stream driver parameters.
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/3727
  * 2021-04-29: imtcp: permit to run multiple inputs in parallel
    Previously, a single server was used to run all imtcp inputs. This
    had a couple of drawsbacks. First and foremost, we could not use
    different stream drivers in the varios inputs. This patch now
    provides a baseline to do that, but does still not implement the
    capability (in this sense it is a staging patch).
    Secondly, we now ensure that each input has at least one exclusive
    thread for processing, untangling the performance of multiple
    inputs from each other.
    see also: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/3727
  * 2021-04-27: tcpsrv bugfix: potential sluggishnes and hang on shutdown
    tcpsrv is used by multiple other modules (imtcp, imdiag, imgssapi, and,
    in theory, also others - even ones we do not know about). However, the
    internal synchornization did not properly take multiple tcpsrv users
    in consideration.
    As such, a single user could hang under some circumstances. This was
    caused by improperly awaking all users from a pthread condition wait.
    That in turn could lead to some sluggish behaviour and, in rare cases,
    a hang at shutdown.
    Note: it was highly unlikely to experience real problems with the
    officially provided modules.
  * 2021-04-22: refactoring of syslog/tcp driver parameter passing
    This has now been generalized to a parameter block, which makes it much cleaner and
    also easier to add new parameters in the future.
  * 2021-04-22: config script: add re_match_i() and re_extract_i() functions
    This provides case-insensitive regex functionality.
    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4429

Thu May 18 12:38:04 UTC 2017 - dziolkowski@suse.com

Version 8.27.0 [v8-stable] 2017-05-16
- imkafka: add module
- imptcp enhancements:
  * optionally emit an error message if incoming messages are truncated
  * optionally emit connection tracking message (on connection create and
    close)
  * add "maxFrameSize" parameter to specify the maximum size permitted
    in octet-counted mode
  * add parameter "discardTruncatedMsg" to permit truncation of
    oversize messages
  * improve octect-counted mode detection: if the octet count is larger
    then the set frame size (or overly large in general), it is now
    assumed that octet-stuffing mode is used. This probably solves a
    number of issues seen in real deployments.
- imtcp enhancements:
  * add parameter "discardTruncatedMsg" to permit truncation of
    oversize messages
  * add "maxFrameSize" parameter to specify the maximum size permitted
    in octet-counted mode
- imfile bugfix: "file not found error" repeatedly being reported
  for configured non-existing file. In polling mode, this message
  appeared once in each polling cycle, causing a potentially very large
  amout of error messages. Note that they were usually emitted too
  infrequently to trigger the error message rate limiter, albeit often
  enough to be a major annoance.
- imfile: in inotify mode, add error message if configured file cannot
  be found
- imfile: add parameter "fileNotFoundError" to optinally disable
  "file not found" error messages
- core: replaced gethostbyname() with getaddrinfo() call
  Gethostbyname() is generally considered obsolete, is not reentrant and
  cannot really work with IPv6. Changed the only place in rsyslog where
  this call remained.
  Thanks to github user jvymazal for the patch
- omkafka: add "origin" field to stats output
  See also https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/1508
  Thanks to Yury Bushmelev for providing the patch.
- imuxsock: rate-limiting also uses process name
  both for the actual limit procesing as well as warning messages emitted
  see also https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/1520
  Thanks to github user jvymazal for the patch
- Added new module: KSI log signing ver. 1.2 (lmsig_ksi_ls12)
- rsylsog base functionality now builds on osx (Mac)
  Thanks to github user hdatma for his help in getting this done.
- build now works on solaris again

- includes changes from 8.21.0:
  * CHANGE OF BEHAVIOUR:
    by default, internal messages are no longer logged via the internal
    bridge to rsyslog but via the syslog() API call [either directly or
    via liblogging). For the typical single-rsyslogd-instance installation this
    is mostly unnoticable (except for some additional latency). If multiple
    instances are run, only the "main" (the one processing system log messages)
    will see all messages. To return to the old behaviour, do either of those
    two:
    1) add in rsyslog.conf:
       global(processInternalMessages="on")
    2) export the environment variable RSYSLOG_DFLT_LOG_INTERNAL=1 
       This will set a new default - the value can still be overwritten via
       rsyslog.conf (method 1). Note that the environment variable must be
       set in your **startup script**.

Thu Aug 21 14:47:32 UTC 2014 - mrueckert@suse.de

- rsyslog 8.4.0 [v8-stable]
  - this is the new stable branch, which incorporates all
    enhancements of rsyslog 8.3.
- rsyslog 8.3.5 [v8-devel] 2014-08-05
  - mmjsonparse: support selectable cookie and target containers
    This permits to put different meanings into a json formatted
    syslog message, e.g. the "traditional" cee or cim data.
  - bugfix: mmjsonparse did not build with json-c < 0.10 This was a
    regression introduced some time in the past in order to support
    API changes in json-c. Now we check for the - rsyslog and use
    proper code.
  - omprog: emit error message via syslog() if loading binary fails
    This happens after forking, so omprog has no longer access to
    rsyslog's regular error reporting functions. Previously, this
    meant any error message was lost. Now it is emitted via regular
    syslog (which may end up in a different instance, if multiple
    instances run...)
  - couple of patches imported from v7-stable (7.6.4)
- rsyslog 8.3.4 [v8-devel] 2014-07-11
  - new pmciscoios parser supporting various Cisco IOS formats
  - RFC3164 timestamp parser now accepts timezones and subsecond
    resolution ... at least for some common formats and where we
    could do so without running risk of breaking proper formats (or
    introducing regressions)
  - new parser config object -- permits to define custom parser
    definitions
  - new tzinfo config object -- permits to define time zone offsets
    This is a utility object that currently is being used by some
    parsers.
  - bugfix: mishandling of input modules not supporting new input
    instances If they did not support this, accidently the output
    module part of the module union was written, leading to
    unpredictable results. Note: all core modules do support this
    interface, but some contributed or very old ones do not.
  - bugfix: double-free when ruleset() parser parameters were used
    While unlikely, this could cause stability issues even after
    the config phase.
- rsyslog 8.3.3 [v8-devel] 2014-06-26
  - unify input object naming imudp now supports "name" paramter,
    as other inputs do. "inputname" has been deprecated, but can
    still be used. Same applies to "appendport" subparamter".
    Thanks to "Nick Syslog" for the suggestion.
  - made the missing (contributed) modules build under v8 [import
    from 8.2.2] Modules:
    * mmrfc5424addhmac omrabbitmq omgssapi omhdfs omzmq3
  - added a cleanup process (janitor); permits to close omfile
    files after a timeout
  - make omgssapi build under v8.3 [import vom v8.2] note that we
    could do this to the stable, because there is NO regression
    chance at all: only omgssapi was changed, and this module did
    NOT work previously.
  - removed obsolete --disable-fsstnd configure option Thanks to
    Thomas D. for alerting us.  Closes:
    https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/72
- rsyslog 8.3.2 [v8-devel] 2014-05-02
  - new template options for date extraction:
    - year
    - month
    - day
    - wday
    - hour
    - minute
    - second
    - tzoffshour
    - tzoffsmin
    - tzoffsdirection
    - wdayname For string templates, these are property options and
      they are prefixed with "date-" (e.g. "date-year",
      "date-month", ...) see also:
      https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/65
  - bugfix: mmexternal remove framing char before processing JSON
    reply This did not have any real bad effects, but caused
    unnecessary processing, as empty replies were not properly
    detected. Otherwise, the bug was not noticible from the user's
    PoV.
  - bugfix: mmexternal segfault due to invalid free in non-json
    input mode closes: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/70
  - bugfix: mmexternal segfault when external plugin sent invalid
    reply ... or no reply at all. This happened if the reply was
    imporper JSON.  Now, we emit an error message in those cases.
    see also: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/69
  - bugfix: mmexternal did potentially pass incomplete data to
    restarted external plugin This could happen if EPIPE was
    returned "too late", in which case the beginning of the data
    could be lost.
  - bugfix: mmexternal did not properly process messages over 4KiB
    The data to be passed to the external plugin was truncated
    after 4KiB.  see: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/64
  - imrelp: added support for per-listener ruleset and inputname
    see: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/63 Thanks to
    bobthesecurityguy github user for the patch
- rsyslog 8.3.1 [v8-devel] 2014-04-24
  - external message modification interface now support modifying
    message PRI
  - "jsonmesg" property will include uuid only if one was
    previously generated This is primarily a performance
    optimization. Whenever the message uuid is gotten, it is
    generated when not already present. As we used the regular
    setter, this means that always the uuid was generated, which is
    quite time-consuming. This has now been changed so that it only
    is generated if it already exists. That also matches more
    closly the semantics, as "jsonmesg" should not make
    modifications to the message.  Note that the same applies to
    "fulljson" passing mode for external plugins.
  - added plugin to rewrite message facility and/or severity Name:
    fac-sever-rewrite.py
  - permits to build against json-c 0.12 Unfortunately, json-c had
    an ABI breakage, so this is necessary. Note that - rsyslogs
    prior to 0.12 had security issues (CVE-2013-6370,
    CVE-2013-6371) and so it is desirable to link against the new -
    rsyslog.  Thanks to Thomas D. for the patch. Note that at least
    some distros have fixed the security issue in older - rsyslogs
    of json-c, so this seems to apply mostly when building from
    sources.
  - bugfix: using UUID property could cause segfault
  - bugfix/mmexternal: memory leak
  - bugfix: memory leak when using "jsonmesg" property
  - bugfix: mmutf8fix did not detect two invalid sequences Thanks
    to Axel Rau for the patch.
  - bugfix: build problems with lexer.l on some platforms For some
    reason, the strdup() prototype and others are missing. I admit
    that I don't know why, as this happens only in 8.3.0+ and there
    is no indication of changes to the affected files. In any case,
    we need to fix this, and the current solution works at least as
    an interim one.
- rsyslog 8.3.0 [v8-devel] 2014-04-10
  - new plugin for anonymizing credit card numbers Thanks to Peter
    Slavov for providing the code.
  - external message modification modules are now supported They
    are bound via the new native module "mmexternal". Also, a
    sample skeleton for an external python message modification
    module has been added.
  - new $jsonmesg property with JSON representation of whole
    message object closes:
    https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/19
  - improved error message for invalid field extraction in string
    template see also:
    http://kb.monitorware.com/problem-with-field-based-extraction-t12299.html
  - fix build problems on Solaris
  - NOTE: a json-c API that we begun to use requires the compiler
    to be in c99 mode. By default, we select it automatically. If
    you modify this and use gcc, be sure to include "-std=c99" in
    your compiler flags. This seems to be necessary only for older
    - rsyslogs of gcc.
- rsyslog 8.2.3 [v8-stable] 2014-??-??
  - bugfix: ommysql: handle/mem leak upon termination of worker
    thread This could become bad if the (instance) worker threads
    are often started and terminated. But it takes quite a while to
    show effect.
- added documentation tarball and also install the html
  documentation
  new subpackage rsyslog-doc
- drop rsyslog-pid-file.patch: patch is included in update
- added rsyslog-8.4.0_implicit_declaration.patch:
  include sys/time.h for gettimeofday

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 16 15:17:34 UTC 2014 - jsegitz@suse.com

  properly they'll live in /etc/apparmor/profiles/extras.
- Added rsyslog-pid-file.patch to fix a regression that causes the pid
  file to be created in /etc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  4 19:40:26 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

  "rsyslogd-2307: warning: ~ action is deprecated, consider using
   the 'stop' statement instead"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 14 06:37:40 UTC 2014 - heinemannj66@gmail.com

- rsyslog 8.2.1 [v8-stable]
  * permits to build against json-c 0.12
    Unfortunately, json-c had an ABI breakage, so this is necessary. Note
    that versions prior to 0.12 had security issues (CVE-2013-6370,
    CVE-2013-6371) and so it is desirable to link against the new version.
    Thanks to Thomas D. for the patch. Note that at least some distros
    have fixed the security issue in older versions of json-c, so this
    seems to apply mostly when building from sources.
  * doc is no longer shipped as part of the rsyslog tarball
    Instead, the rsyslog-doc project creates its own tarball. This is the
    result of a mailing list discussion after the 8.2.0 release with a
    tarball-in-tarball approach, which was disliked by almost all distro
    maintainers. This move also has the advantage of de-coupling the
    release cycles of both projects a bit (which turned out to be a bit
    problematic in practice).
  * bugfix: mmutf8fix did not detect two invalid sequences
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 14 06:31:47 UTC 2014 - heinemannj66@gmail.com

- rsyslog 8.2.0 [v8-stable]
  This starts a new stable branch based on 8.1.6 plus the following changes:
  * we now use doc from the rsyslog-doc project
    As such, the ./doc subtree has been removed. Instead, a cache of the
    rsyslog-doc project's files has been included in ./rsyslog-doc.tar.gz.
    Note that the exact distribution mode for the doc is still under
    discussion and may change in future releases.
    This was agreed upon on the rsyslog mailing list. For doc issues
    and corrections, be sure to work with the rsyslog-doc project. It is
    currently hosted at https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog-doc
  * add support for specifying the liblogging-stdlog channel spec
    new global parameter "stdlog.channelspec"
  * add "defaultnetstreamdrivercertfile" global variable to set a default
    for the certfile.
  * omelasticsearch: add new "usehttps" parameter for secured connections
  * "action resumed" message now also specifies module type
    which makes troubleshooting a bit easier. Note that we cannot output all
    the config details (like destination etc) as this would require much more
    elaborate code changes, which we at least do not like to do in the
    stable version.
  * add capability to override GnuTLS path in build process
  * better and more consistent action naming, action queues now always
    contain the word "queue" after the action name
  * bugfix: ompipe did resume itself even when it was still in error

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 14 06:27:10 UTC 2014 - heinemannj66@gmail.com

    were missing.
  - bugfix: double-free in omelasticsearch
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=461
    a security advisory for this bug is available at:
    http://www.lsexperts.de/advisories/lse-2013-07-03.txt
    PLEASE NOTE: This issue only existed if omelasticsearch was used
    in a non-default configuration, where the "errorfile" parameter
    was specified. Without that parameter set, the bug could not be
    triggered. Thanks to Markus Vervier and Marius Ionescu for providing
    a detailled bug report. Special thanks to Markus for coordinating
    his security advisory with us.

  - bugfix: segfault due to invalid dynafile cache handling
    Accidently, the old-style cache size parameter was used when the
    dynafile cache was created in a RainerScript action. If the
    old-style size was lower than the one actually set, this lead to
    misadressing when the size was overrun, and that could lead to
    all kinds of “interesting things”, often in segfaults.

- update to 7.2.7 [v7-stable] 2013-04-17:
  - rsyslogd startup information is now properly conveyed back to init
    when privileges are beging dropped. Actually, we have moved
    termination of the parent in front of the priv drop. So it shall
    work now in all cases. See code comments in commit for more details.
  - If forking, the parent now waits for a maximum of 60 seconds for
    termination by the child
  - improved debugging support in forked (auto-backgrounding) mode.
    The rsyslog debug log file is now continued to be written across the
    fork.
  - updated systemd files to match current systemd source
  - bugfix: failover/action suspend did not work correctly
    This was experienced if the retry action took more than one second
    to complete. For suspending, a cached timestamp was used, and if the
    retry took longer, that timestamp was already in the past. As a
    result, the action never was kept in suspended state, and as such no
    failover happened. The suspend functionalit now does no longer use
    the cached timestamp (should not have any performance implication,
    as action suspend occurs very infrequently).
  - bugfix: nested if/prifilt conditions did not work properly

    Thanks to Philippe Muller for the patch.
  - bugfix: several issues in imkmsg
    see bug tracker: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=421#c8
  - bugfix: imuxsock was missing SysSock.ParseTrusted module parameter
    To use that functionality, legacy rsyslog.conf syntax had to be used.
    Also, the doc was missing information on the "ParseTrusted" set of
    config directives.
  - bugfix: parameter action.execOnlyWhenPreviousIsSuspended was
    accidently of integer-type. For obvious reasons, it needs to be
    boolean. Note that this change can break existing configurations
    if they circumvented the problem by using 0/1 values.
  - doc bugfix: rsyslog.conf man page had invalid file format info

- update to 7.2.6 [v7-stable] 2013-03-05:
  - slightly improved config parser error messages when invalid escapes
    happen
  - bugfix: include files got included in the wrong order
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=411
    This happens if an $IncludeConfig directive was done on multiple
    files (e.g. the distro default of $IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf).
    In that case, the order of include file processing is reversed, which
    could lead to all sorts of problems.
    Thanks to Nathan Stratton Treadway for his great analysis of the
    problem, which made bug fixing really easy.
  - bugfix: omelasticsearch failed when authentication data was provided
    ... at least in most cases it emitted an error message:
    "snprintf failed when trying to build auth string"
    Thanks to Joerg Heinemann for alerting us.
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=404
  - bugfix: some property-based filter were incorrectly parsed
    This usually lead to a syntax error on startup and rsyslogd not actually
    starting up. The problem was the regex, which did not care for double
    quote characters to follow in the action part - unfortunately something
    that can frequently happen with v6+ format. An example:
    :programname, isequal, "as" {action(type="omfile" ...) }
    Here, the part 
    :programname, isequal, "as" {action(type="omfile"
    was treated as the property filter, and the rest as action part.
    Obviously, this did not work out. Unfortunately, such situations usually
    resulted in very hard to understand error messages.

Mon Jan  7 10:58:19 UTC 2013 - mt@suse.com

- Update to 7.2.4 [v7-stable] with following changes:
  - enhance: permit RFC3339 timestamp in local log socket messages
    Thanks to Sebastien Ponce for the patch.
  - imklog: added ParseKernelTimestamp parameter (import from 5.10.2)
    Thanks to Marius Tomaschewski for the patch.
  - fix missing functionality: ruleset(){} could not specify ruleset queue
    The "queue.xxx" parameter set was not supported, and legacy ruleset
    config statements did not work (by intention). The fix introduces the
    "queue.xxx" parameter set. It has some regression potential, but only
    for the new functionality. Note that using that interface it is possible
    to specify duplicate queue file names, which will cause trouble. This
    will be solved in v7.3, because there is a too-large regression
    potential for the v7.2 stable branch.
  - imklog: added KeepKernelTimestamp parameter (import from 5.10.2)
    Thanks to Marius Tomaschewski for the patch.
  - bugfix: imklog mistakenly took kernel timestamp subseconds as nanoseconds
    ... actually, they are microseconds. So the fractional part of the 
    timestamp was not properly formatted. (import from 5.10.2)
    Thanks to Marius Tomaschewski for the bug report and the patch idea.
  - bugfix: supportoctetcountedframing parameter did not work in imptcp
  - bugfix: modules not (yet) supporting new conf format were not properly
    registered. This lead to a "module not found" error message instead of
    the to-be-expected "module does not support new style" error message.
    That invalid error message could be quite misleading and actually stop
    people from addressing the real problem (aka "go nuts" ;))
  - bugfix: template "type" parameter is mandatory (but was not)
  - bugfix: some message properties could be garbled due to race condition
    This happened only on very high volume systems, if the same message was
    being processed by two different actions. This was a regression caused
    by the new config processor, which did no longer properly enable msg
    locking in multithreaded cases. The bugfix is actually a refactoring of
    the msg locking code - we no longer do unlocked operations, as the use
    case for it has mostly gone away. It is potentially possible only at
    very low-end systems, and there the small additional overhead of doing
    the locking does not really hurt. Instead, the removal of that 
    capability can actually slightly improve performance in common cases,
    as the code path is smaller and requires slightly less memory writes.
    That probably outperforms the extra locking overhead (which in the 
    low-end case always happens in user space, without need for kernel
    support as we can always directly aquire the lock - there is no
    contention at all).
- Removed imklog-kernel-timestamp-parsing (bnc#783967) patch obsoleted
  by this version.

Thu Nov 22 14:12:36 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Update to 7.2.3 (v7-stable) a release providing following fixes:
  - regression fix: rsyslogd terminated when wild-card $IncludeConfig did not
    find actual include files. For example, if this directive is present:
    $IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
    and there are no *.conf files in /etc/rsyslog.d (but rsyslog.d exists),
    rsyslogd will emit an error message and terminate. Previous (and expected)
    behaviour is that an empty file set is no problem. HOWEVER, if the
    directory itself does not exist, this is flagged as an error and will
    load to termination (no startup).
    Unfortunately, this is often the case by default in many distros, so this
    actually prevents rsyslog startup.
  - doc improvements
  - enabled to build without libuuid, at loss of uuid functionality
    this enables smoother builds on older systems that do not support
    libuuid. Loss of functionality should usually not matter too much as
    uuid support has only recently been added and is very seldom used.
  - bugfix: omfwd did not properly support "template" parameter
  - bugfix: potential segfault when re_match() function was used
    Thanks to oxpa for the patch.
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=371
  - bugfix: potential abort of imtcp on rsyslogd shutdown
  - bugfix: imzmq3 segfault with PULL subscription
    Thanks to Martin Nilsson for the patch.
  - bugfix: improper handling of backslash in string-type template()s
  - bugfix: leading quote (") in string-type template() lead to thight loop
    on startup
  - bugfix: no error msg on invalid field option in legacy/string template
  - bugfix: potential segfault due to invalid param handling in comparisons
    This could happen in RainerScript comparisons (like contains); in some
    cases an unitialized variable was accessed, which could lead to an
    invalid free and in turn to a segfault.
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=372
    Thanks to Georgi Georgiev for reporting this bug and his great help
    in solving it.
  - bugfix: no error msg on unreadable $IncludeConfig path
  - bugfix: $IncludeConfig did not correctly process directories
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=376
    The testbench was also enhanced to check for these cases.
    Thanks to Georgi Georgiev for the bug report.
  - bugfix: make rsyslog compile on kfreebsd again
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=380
    Thanks to Guillem Jover for the patch.
  - bugfix: garbled message if field name was used with jsonf property option
    The length for the field name was invalidly computed, resulting in either
    truncated field names or including extra random data. If the random data
    contained NULs, the rest of the message became unreadable.
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=374
  - bugfix: potential segfault at startup with property-based filter
    If the property name was followed by a space before the comma, rsyslogd
    aborted on startup. Note that no segfault could happen if the initial
    startup went well (this was a problem with the config parser).
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=381
  - bugfix: imfile discarded some file parts
    File lines that were incomplete (LF missing) *at the time imfile polled
    the file* were partially discarded. That part of the line that was read 
    without the LF was discarded, and the rest of the line was submitted in
    the next polling cycle. This is now changed so that the partial content
    is saved until the complete line is read. Note that the patch affects
    only read mode 0.
    Thanks to Milan Bartos for providing the base idea for the solution.
- Merged also fixes for unreliable kernel timestamp regression (bnc#783967),
  which will be picked up in a later v7-stable release:
  - imklog: added $klogParseKernelTimestamp option (default off),
    wich reverts to the 5.8.x behavior to use receive time for the
    kernel messages instead to try parse and convert the kernel
    timestamp, what is not reliable on some hardware (intel i7/Xeon).
  - imklog: added $klogKeepKernelTimestamp option (default off),
    causing to not remove the kernel timestamp from the message
    after a successful conversion.
  - imklog: fixed a conversion bug causing a <1sec incorrectness
    of the message time when the kernel timestamp is parsed.
- Removed {} arround RSYSLOG_PARAMS variable in service file. systemd
  seems sometimes to not like it any more (bnc#788330).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 20 11:44:16 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 29 15:39:26 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Update to 7.2.1 (v7-stable), a pure bug-fixing release: 
  - bugfix: ruleset()-object did only support a single statement
  - added -D rsyslogd option to enable config parser debug mode
  - improved syntax error messages by outputting the error token
  - the rsyslog core now suspeneds actions after 10 failures in
    a row. This was former the case after 1,000 failures and could
    cause rsyslog to be spammed/ressources misused.
    See the v6 compatibility doc for more details.
  - ommongodb rate-limits error messages to prevent spamming the
    syslog closes (for v7.2):
    http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=366
- Enabled compilation of kmsg, the kernel’s new structured logging
  system modile, mmaudit the message modification module supporting
  Linux audit format and mmjsonparse providing the cee-enhanced
  syslog format support message modification module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 24 15:01:53 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Update to 7.2.0 (v7-stable) a full structured-logging/CEE enabled
  version which provides following features compared to v5-stable:
  * greatly improved configuration language – the new language is
    much more intuitive than the legacy format. It will also prevent
    some typical mistakes simply be not permitting these invalid
    constructs. Note that legacy format is still fully supported
    (and you can of course do the same mistakes if you use legacy
    format).
  * greatly improved execution engine – with nested if/then/else
    constructs as well as the capability to modify variables during
    processing.
  * full support for structured logging and project lumberjack/CEE.
    this includes everything from being able to create, interpret
    and handle JSON-based structured log messages, including the
    ability to normalize legacy text log messages.
  * more plugins – like support for MongoDB, HDFS, and ElasticSearch
    as well as for the kernel’s new structured logging system.
  * higher performance – many optimizations all over the code, like
    5 to 10 times faster execution time for script-based filters,
    enhanced multithreaded TCP input plugin, DNS cache and many more.

Mon Sep 17 12:13:04 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Update to 6.4.1  [V6-STABLE] 2012-09-06:
  - bugfix: multiple main queues with same queue file name were not
    detected.  This lead to queue file corruption. While the root
    cause is a config error, it is a bug that this important and
    hard to find config error was not detected by rsyslog.
  - bugfix: “jsonf” property replacer option did generate invalid
    JSON in JSON, we have “fieldname”:”value”, but the option
    emitted “fieldname”=”value”. Interestingly, this was accepted
    by a couple of sinks, most importantly elasticsearch. Now the
    correct format is emitted, which causes a remote chance that
    some things that relied on the wrong format will break.
    Thanks to Miloslav Trmač for the patch
  - change $!all-json did emit an empty (thus non-JSON) string if
    no libee data was present. It now emits {} and thus valid JSON.
    There is a small risk that this may break some things that
    relied on the previous inconsistency. Thanks to Miloslav Trmač
    for the patch
  - bugfix: omusrsmsg incorrect return state & config warning
    handling. During config file processing, Omusrmsg often
    incorrectly returned a warning status, even when no warning was
    present (caused by uninitialized variable). Also, the core
    handled warning messages incorrectly, and treated them as
    errors. As a result, omusrmsg (most often) could not properly be
    loaded. Note that this only occurs with legacy config action
    syntax. This was a regression caused by an incorrect merge in to
    the 6.3.x codebase.
    Thanks to Stefano Mason for alerting us of this bug.
  - bugfix: Fixed TCP CheckConnection handling in omfwd.c. Interface
    needed to be changed in lower stream classes. Syslog TCP Sending
    is now resumed properly. Unfixed, that lead to non-detection of
    downstate of remote hosts.

Mon May  7 10:31:08 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Updated to 5.8.11 [V5-stable] 2012-05-03:
  - bugfix: ommysql did not properly init/exit the mysql runtime
    library this could lead to segfaults. Triggering condition:
    multiple action instances using ommysql. Thanks to Tomas
    Heinrich for reporting this problem and providing an initial
    patch (which my solution is based on, I need to add more code
    to clean the mess up).
  - bugfix: rsyslog did not terminate when delayable inputs were
    blocked due to unvailable sources. Fixes:
    http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=299
    Thanks to Marcin M for bringing up this problem and Andre
    Lorbach for helping to reproduce and fix it.
  - bugfix: active input in “light delay state” could block
    rsyslog termination, at least for prolonged period of time
  - bugfix: imptcp input name could not be set. Config directive
    was accepted, but had no effect
    bugfix: assigned ruleset was lost when using disk queues
    This looked quite hard to diagnose for disk-assisted queues,
    as the pure memory part worked well, but ruleset info was lost
    for messages stored inside the disk queue.
  - bugfix: hostname was not requeried on HUP
    Thanks to Per Jessen for reporting this bug and Marius
    Tomaschewski for his help in testing the fix.
  - bugfix: inside queue.c, some thread cancel states were not
    correctly reset. While this is a bug, we assume it did have
    no practical effect because the reset as it was done was set
    to the state the code actually had at this point. But better
    fix this…
- Removed obsolete requery hostname patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 12 09:22:38 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

    for disk queue config. Thanks to Tomas Heinrich for the patch.
  - bugfix: segfault if disk-queue was started up with old queue file
    Thanks to Tomas Heinrich for the patch.
  - bugfix: memory leak in array passing output module mode
  by 5.8.9 [V5-stable] 2012-03-15:
  - added tool to recover disk queue if .qi file is missing
    (recover_qi.pl)
    Thanks to Kaiwang Chen for contributing this tool
  - bugfix: stopped DA queue was never processed after a restart
    due to a regression from statistics module.
  - added better doc for statsobj interface.
    Thanks to Kaiwang Chen for his suggestions and analysis in
    regard to the stats subsystem.
  by 5.8.8  [V5-stable] 2012-03-05:
  - bugfix: omprog made rsyslog abort on startup if not binary to
    execute was configured
  - bugfix: imklog invalidly computed facility and severity
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=313
    improves interop with systemd journal

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 20 15:33:05 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Detect if we have to use the new /run/systemd/journal/syslog
  socket instead of the /dev/log under newer systemd versions.
  Obsoletes listen.conf installed by systemd (bnc#747871).
- updated to 5.8.7 [V5-stable]:
  - bugfix: instabilities when using RFC5424 header fields
    Thanks to Kaiwang Chen for the patch
  - bugfix: imuxsock did truncate part of received message if it did
    not contain a proper date. The truncation occured because we
    removed that part of the messages that was expected to be the date.
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=295
  - bugfix: potential abort after reading invalid X.509 certificate
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=290
    Thanks to Tomas Heinrich for the patch
  - bugfix: stats counter were not properly initialized on creation
  - FQDN hostname for multihomed host was not always set to the correct
    name if multiple aliases existed. Thanks to Tomas Heinreich for the
    patch.
- updated to 5.8.6 [V5-stable]:
  - bugfix: missing whitespace after property-based filter was not
    detected
  - bugfix: $OMFileFlushInterval period was doubled - now using correct
    value
  - bugfix: ActionQueue could malfunction due to index error
    Thanks to Vlad Grigorescu for the patch
  - bugfix: $ActionExecOnlyOnce interval did not work properly
    Thanks to Tomas Heinrich for the patch
  - bugfix: race condition when extracting program name, APPNAME,
    structured data and PROCID (RFC5424 fields) could lead to invalid
    characters e.g. in dynamic file names or during forwarding (general
    malfunction ofthese fields in templates, mostly under heavy load)
  - bugfix: imuxsock did no longer ignore message-provided timestamp,
    if so configured (the *default*). Lead to no longer sub-second
    timestamps.
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=281
  - bugfix: omfile returns fatal error code for things that go really
    wrong previously, RS_RET_RESUME was returned, which lead to a loop
    inside the rule engine as omfile could not really recover.
  - bugfix: imfile did invalid system call under some circumstances
    when a file that was to be monitored did not exist BUT the state
    file actually existed. Mostly a cosmetic issue. Root cause was
    incomplete error checking in stream.c; so patch may affect other
    code areas.
  - bugfix: rsyslogd -v always said 64 atomics were not present
    thanks to mono_matsuko for the patch
- Changed /etc/rsyslog.early.conf to just include rsyslog.conf,
  fixed spec to use sd-daemon.[ch] from docs on 11.4 only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 20 12:11:18 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Cleaned up the config files a bit, updated comments in config
  file, marked the /etc/rsyslog.early.conf obsolete.
  Note: rsyslog will be started early/before network using its normal
  /etc/rsyslog.conf config file (adopted scripts in syslog-service
  package). When any kind of remote logging is in use, then on-disk
  queues should be enabled. To start it after the network, please set
  the SYSLOG_REQUIRES_NETWORK=yes variable in /etc/sysconfig/syslog
  (bnc#728565).

  - bugfix: The NUL-Byte for the syslogtag was not copied in MsgDup
    (msg.c)
  - bugfix: fixed incorrect state handling for Discard Action
    (transactions) Note: This caused all messages in a batch to be
    set to COMMITTED, even if they were discarded. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 11:05:18 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Adopted to require new syslog-service package on 12.x, that
  provides the /etc/init.d/syslog LSB init script and systemd
  syslog.service service file. Removed rsyslog.service file
  installation from spec file. (fate#311316).

  - bugfix: MSGID corruption in RFC5424 parser under some
    circumstances closes:
    http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=275
- remove rsyslog-5.8.0-memcpy.patch:
  applied upstream
- fix build for older distros:
  only buildrequire systemd-devel for newer than 11.4, use systemd
  for the others

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 19 04:54:03 UTC 2011 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Fix build with new gnutls 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  2 07:35:13 UTC 2011 - aj@suse.de

- Require systemd-devel to follow package split.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 13 11:10:15 UTC 2011 - mrueckert@suse.de

- drop modules imtemplate and omtemplate, the 2 modules are base
  templates for people who want to develop their own modules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 12 13:35:54 UTC 2011 - mrueckert@suse.de

- enabled a few more modules which dont pull extra dependencies:
  impstats, pmcisconames, pmaixforwardedfrom, pmsnare, pmrfc3164sd,
  omruleset, mmsnmptrapd

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 12 13:11:04 UTC 2011 - mrueckert@suse.de

- guard the file list entry for rsyslog.service with
  if {with systemd}. Please keep the package working on older
  distros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 12 12:59:13 UTC 2011 - mrueckert@suse.de

- upstream asked to change the syntax in the default config files
  to the new syntax:
  old: *.* * # (write to all)
  new: *.* :omusrmsg:*

  old: *.* $channel
  new: *.* :omfile:$channel

  from what i can see we are only affected with:
  old: *.emerg *
  new: *.emerg :omusrmsg:*

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 12 12:52:58 UTC 2011 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Updated to 5.8.3  [V5-stable]
  - systemd support: set stdout/stderr to null - thx to Lennart for
    the patch
  - added support for the ":omusrmsg:" syntax in configuring user
    messages
  - added support for the ":omfile:" syntax in configuring user
    messages Note: previous outchannel syntax will generate a
    warning message. This may be surprising to some users, but it
    is quite urgent to alert them of the new syntax as v6 can no
    longer support the previous one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 21 13:50:42 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to 5.8.2 [V5-stable] (bnc#701282) a maintenance release,
  containing only stability fixes:
  - bugfix: problems in failover action handling
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=270
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=254
  - bugfix: mutex was invalidly left unlocked during action processing
    At least one case where this can occur is during thread shutdown,
    which may be initiated by lower activity. In most cases, this is
    quite unlikely to happen. However, if it does, data structures may be
    corrupted which could lead to fatal failure and segfault. I detected
    this via a testbench test, not a user report. But I assume that some
    users may have had unreproducable aborts that were cause by this bug.
  - bugfix: memory leak in imtcp & subsystems under some circumstances
    This leak is tied to error conditions which lead to incorrect cleanup
    of some data structures. [backport from v6]
  - bugfix/improvement:$WorkDirectory now gracefully handles trailing
    slashes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 31 12:14:59 UTC 2011 - aj@suse.de

- Add systemd service file back (bnc#696963).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 07:53:38 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Removed touch of obsolete /var/log/boot.log from spec post.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 15:43:28 UTC 2011 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 5.8.1
  - bugfix: invalid processing in QUEUE_FULL condition If the the
    multi-submit interface was used and a QUEUE_FULL condition
    occured, the failed message was properly destructed. However,
    the rest of the input batch, if it existed, was not processed.
    So this lead to potential loss of messages and a memory leak.
    The potential loss of messages was IMHO minor, because they
    would have been dropped in most cases due to the queue
    remaining full, but very few lucky ones from the batch may have
    made it. Anyhow, this has now been changed so that the rest of
    the batch is properly tried to be enqueued and, if not
    possible, destructed.
  - new module mmsnmptrapd, a sample message modification module
    This can be useful to reformat snmptrapd messages and also
    serves as a sample for how to write message modification
    modules using the output module interface. Note that we
    introduced this new functionality directly into the stable
    release, as it does not modify the core and as such cannot have
    any side-effects if it is not used (and thus the risk is solely
    on users requiring that functionality).
  - bugfix: rate-limiting inside imuxsock did not work 100% correct
    reason was that a global config variable was invalidly accessed
    where a listener variable should have been used.  Also
    performance-improved the case when rate limiting is turned off
    (this is a very unintrusive change, thus done directly to the
    stable version).
  - bugfix: $myhostname not available in RainerScript (and no error
    message) closes:
    http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=233
  - bugfix: memory and file descriptor leak in stream processing
    Leaks could occur under some circumstances if the file stream
    handler errored out during the open call. Among others, this
    could cause very big memory leaks if there were a problem with
    unreadable disk queue files. In regard to the memory leak, this
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=256
  - bugfix: doc for impstats had wrong config statements also,
    config statements were named a bit inconsistent, resolved that
    problem by introducing an alias and only documenting the
    consistent statements Thanks to Marcin for bringing up this
    problem.
  - bugfix: IPv6-address could not be specified in omrelp this was
    due to improper parsing of ":" closes:
    http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=250
  - bugfix: TCP connection invalidly aborted when messages needed
    to be discarded (due to QUEUE_FULL or similar problem)
  - bugfix: $LocalHostName was not honored under all circumstances
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=258
  - bugfix(minor): improper template function call in syslogd.c

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 29 11:38:40 UTC 2011 - idoenmez@novell.com

  conditionals so we can switch them on and off by more easily.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 26 12:30:17 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Dropped obsolete rsyslog-systemd-integration.bnc656104.diff

  This is the new v5-stable branch, importing all feature from the
  5.7.x versions. To see what has changed in regard to the previous
  v5-stable, check the entries for 5.7.x in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/rsyslog/ChangeLog.

  - bugfix: race condition in deferred name resolution
    closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=238

  included in the release
- refreshed rsyslog-systemd-integration.bnc656104.diff:
  most of the patch went upstream just a small chunk left
- fixed the with_dbi conditional, it was using the build_with_relp.
- added a new conditional with_systemd and moved all the systemd
  specific things from suse_version >= 1140 to the with_systemd
  conditional. the patch line in the preamble should be
  unconditional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  8 13:24:34 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- bugfix: race condition in deferred name resolution (id=238)
  from v5.8.0 candidate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 24 16:34:31 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

  * bugfix: failover did not work correctly if repeated msg
  reduction was on.
  affected directive: $ActionExecOnlyWhenPreviousIsSuspended on
  * bugfix: omlibdbi did not use password from rsyslog.conf
  closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=203
  * bugfix(kind of): tell users that config graph can currently
  not be generated
  closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=232
  * bugfix: discard action did not work under some circumstances
  fixes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=217
  (bnc#676041)
  * bugfix: potential abort condition when $RepeatedMsgReduction
  were set to on as well as potentially in a number of other places
  where MsgDup() was used. This only happened when the imudp input
  module was used and it depended on name resolution not yet had
  taken place. (bnc#679030)
  * bugfix: fixed a memory leak and potential abort condition
  this could happen if multiple rulesets were used and some output
  batches contained messages belonging to more than one ruleset.
  fixes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=226
  fixes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=218
  * bugfix: memory leak when $RepeatedMsgReduction on was used
  bug tracker: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=225
  (bnc#681568)
- Merged systemd socket activation support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  2 16:47:24 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- update to 5.6.3 (v5-stable) with following bugfixes (digest):
  * action processor released mememory too early, resulting in
  potential issue in retry cases (very unlikely).
  * batch processing flagged invalid message as "bad" under some
  circumstances
  * unitialized variable could cause issues under extreme
  conditions plus some minor nits.
  * batches which had actions in error were not properly retried
  in all cases
  * imfile did duplicate messages under some circumstances
- enabled plain tcp input, unix socket output, last message
  parser and the libdbi module as separate package.
- disabled systemd patch for openSUSE <= 11.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 20 14:10:59 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Improved systemd socket activation support to allow multiple
  unix sockets and activation in forking mode (bnc#656197).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  3 16:49:41 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- update to 5.6.2 (v5-stable) with following bugfixes:
  * compile failed on systems without epoll_create1()
    Thanks to David Hill for providing a fix.
  * atomic increment for msg object may not work correct on
    all platforms. Thanks to Chris Metcalf for the patch
  * replacements for atomic operations for non-int sized types
    had problems. At least one instance of that problem could
    potentially lead to abort (inside omfile).
- Increased mark frequency in rsyslog.conf to 1 hour
- Enabled duplicate message reduction in rsyslog.conf to catch
  at least buggy programs running amok and writting same message
  zillion times until the disk gets out of space (bnc#656197).
- Merged rsyslog-systemd-integration.bnc656104.diff (fuzz=0).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 29 10:32:58 CET 2010 - mt@suse.de

- update to 5.6.1
  This release addresses a TLS bug, that has been bothering a lot
  of users lately. It stops rsyslog from looping, thus disabling
  functionality and bearing the risk of unresponsiveness of the
  whole system. Other issues have been fixed for imptcp, failing
  testbench, segfault on empty templates and failed compile.
  For more detailed information, please review the ChangeLog and
    http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=194,
    http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=204,
    http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=206.

  series to the v5-stable branch.
  - bugfix: a couple of problems that imfile had on some platforms,
    namely Ubuntu (not their fault, but occured there)
  - bugfix: imfile utilizes 32 bit to track offset. Most importantly,

    64 bit long's!)
- removed obsolete patch
  - xconsole-pipe-loop
- rpmlint
  - name-repeated-in-summary C Rsyslog

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 13 08:56:15 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to rsyslog version 5.4.0 (v5-stable). This version begins
  a new stable series based on the 5.3.x series, which has been
  proven rather well in practice. The new 5.4.0 contains fixes for
  all known problems. See ChangeLog file for a detailed history.
  The main new feature is speed: several optimizations were done,
  including support for epoll in tcp listeners.
- Added new lmzlibw.so and omruleset.so to the file list.
- Recompressed original tar.gz source archive using bzip2.

- Added read-only RSYSLOGD_NATIVE_VERSION sysconfig/syslog variable,
  that is set to the native mode version number for the -c parameter
  while every installation and used in the /etc/init.d/syslog script,
  except the user overrides this default in RSYSLOGD_COMPAT_VERSION.

- Updated to rsyslog version 4.4.1 (v4-stable), a bug-fixing release,
  providing some important fixes for issues that have only been
  detected after the beta phase. Some of them are serious (like a
  segfault when UDP messageforwarding is activated), so users of
  4.4.0 are urged to upgrade to this release. Changelog for 4.4.1:
  * features requiring Java are automatically disabled if Java
    is not present (thanks to Michael Biebl for his help!)
  * bugfix: invalid double-quoted PRI, among others in outgoing
    messages. This causes grief with all receivers.
    Bug tracker: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=147
  * bugfix: Java testing tools were required, even if testbench
    was disabled. This resulted in build errors if no Java was
    present on the build system, even though none of the selected
    option actually required Java. (I forgot to backport a similar
    fix to newer releases).
  * bugfix (backport): omfwd segfault. Note that the orginal (higher
    version) patch states this happens only when debugging mode is
    turned on. That statement is wrong: if debug mode is turned off,
    the message is not being emitted, but the division by zero in
    the actual parameters still happens.
- Removed jave2-devel-packages from build requires again

- Updated to rsyslog version 4.4.0, the actual stable 4.4.x series.
  It provides several bugfixes, performance improvements and new
  features: It adds generic network stream server for syslog, the
  capability to rebind the send socket of the UDP output section,
  allows multiple tcp listeners, multiple recipients in ommail,
  new plugins as omprog, improved documentation and testbench
  with a config switch. Please review ChangeLog file for details.
- Removed obsolete moddirs patch (included in 4.4.0)
- Added java2-devel-packages to BuildRequires (for test suite)
- Enabled omprog and omtemplate plugins, added them and the
  lmstrmsrv plugin to the base-plugins file list.

- Security fix to honor $AllowedSender settings (bnc#457273).
