%description
Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety,
speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a
garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use
cases other languages are not good at: embedding in other languages,
programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing
low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. It improves
on current languages targeting this space by having a number of
compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while
eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve "zero-cost
abstractions", even though some of these abstractions feel like those
of a high-level language. Even then, Rust still allows precise control
like a low-level language would.

%description -n rls
The RLS provides a server that runs in the background, providing IDEs,
editors, and other tools with information about Rust programs. It
supports functionality such as 'goto definition', symbol search,
reformatting, and code completion, and enables renaming and
refactorings.  It can be used with an IDE such as Gnome-Builder.
