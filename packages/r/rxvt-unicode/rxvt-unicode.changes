Wed Apr  4 05:22:54 UTC 2018 - glin@suse.com

- added rxvt-unicode-secondarywheel.patch from to add the new
  option: secondaryWheel to enable mouse scrolling for the pagers,
  e.g. less, man, vim, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 31 14:55:32 UTC 2017 - mrueckert@suse.de

- added rxvt-unicode-hardening.patch: (boo# 1036456)
  While urxvt is not directly affected by CVE-2017-7483. We add a
  patch to harden urxvt to avoid similar bugs in the future.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  7 08:30:16 UTC 2016 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- update to 9.22
  - NOTICE: this release updates terminfo.
	- add terminfo capabilities for various ctrl and shift-ctrl key variants
        - fix longstanding core font encoding bug where some character
          ranges could not be mapped from unicode to the font: affected
          encodings are big5, gb2312, iso8859-8 (hebrew), jis0201 and
          ksc5601 .
        - fix crash when the number of columns is 1 and a 0 width character is inserted
        - fix a crash when parsing an invalid color specification
        - fix a buffer overflow in font name parser
	- do not start blinking cursor if the window is unfocused
	- change the width of underline and i-beam cursor to 2 pixels (based on
	  a patch by Omar Sandoval).
	- add pointerShape resource to change the mouse pointer shape
	- a keysym resource for a key which is already bound to an
	  action now properly rebinds the key.
	- do not report mouse motion events if Shift is active
	- put the alpha component last in responses to OSC color queries
	- the key_press hook is now invoked before processing the
	  event, as documented. This change was done in 9.21 but not
	  announced and fixes debian bugs #511377, #531751 and red hat
	  bug #1105069. Note that this change breaks a few scripts,
	  such as mark-yank-urls, which rely on the previous buggy
	  behaviour that urxvt processes the event (in particular
	  keysym bindings) before invoking the hook.
	- the tabbed extension now properly refreshes the active tab
	  on a key press when the mouse pointer is outside the terminal
	  window.
	- add 'lookup_keysym' perl method to lookup the action bound
	  to a key combination.
	- a key combination bound to 'matcher:select' can now be used
	  to cycle through the matches in matcher.
        - change perl integer accessors (->width et al.) into mutators.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 17 13:17:47 UTC 2015 - mrueckert@suse.de

- move requires for the terminfo files from terminfo to
  terminfo-base (boo #936332)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 24 16:19:43 UTC 2015 - meissner@suse.com

- install COPYING

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 23 14:37:52 UTC 2015 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- remove %{_terminfo}/r/rxvt-unicode 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 23 11:18:45 UTC 2015 - meissner@suse.com

- %clean section removed, moved makeinstall to %install

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 18 20:46:55 UTC 2015 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- update to 9.21
    - fix pixel droppings on overdraw when a secondary core font has the
          same height but different ascent.
        - implement cvvis in terminfo as blinking cursor, to distinguish it
          from cnorm (emacs uses cvvis which is commonly a blinking cursor).
        - when xft support was compiled in, colour queries erroneously returned
          premultiplied values, this also affected internal queries, for example
          when calculating faded colour. alpha is now divided out when possible,
          which is more correct but loses colour resolution.
    - add DECSCUSR xterm extension to set the cursor to a vertical bar.
    - add 'extension:string' action, and associated on_action perl
      hook, for keysym resources that invokes actions provided by
      perl extensions. The 'perl:string' action and
      on_user_command hook are deprecated but still supported.
    - add 'builtin-string' action for keysym resources that restores string
      mappings for keys that have predefined actions in urxvt.
    - add -k option to urxvtc for killing the daemon process.
        - document urxvtd's -e/--eval option that was implemented in 9.16,
          but not documented.
    - add -dockapp option to make the wm treat urxvt as a dockapp.
    - add -mc option and multiClickTime resource to set the maximum time
      between multi-click select events (patch by Joe Peterson).
    - new 'eval' extension to evaluate arbitrary perl code with keysym
      bindings. The extension also provides methods that implement basic
      actions, such as pasting selections and scrolling.
    - the macosx-clipboard and macosx-clipboard-native extensions have been removed.
    - kuake extension now uses the kuake.hotkey resource to specify the hotkey.
    - new 'matcher:select' mode of matcher to iterate over the matches with the keyboard.
    - the 'matcher:list' feature of matcher now honours the launcher
      associated to a matched pattern.
    - speed-up matcher underlining on very long lines (reported by Edward Z. Yang).
    - fix up/down commands of searchable-scrollback so that they always move
      to the previous/next logical line with a match, if any.
    - searchable-scrollback resource has been deprecated (use keysym instead).
        - extension parameter passing is deprecated (use resource mechanism instead).
        - upgrade to GPLv3 (see COPYING).
    - compile out of the box on Solaris 10, again.
        - fix height and position of the stippled area in next scrollbar (patch
          by Thomas Otto).
        - fix off-by-one bug causing the iso14755 window not to jump out of the
          way properly.
    - fix crash that may happen if a lib to which urxvt is linked to calls setenv.
    - fix memory leak in special_{encode,decode} perl methods.
    - fix refresh bug that occurs when reverse video is set on a cell
      containing a space and with the same bg and fg colour, red hat bug
      #830236.
        - fix crash that may happen if an x error is received after a terminal
          window/popup has been destroyed already.
        - removed superfluous 0 digit from sgr terminfo sequence.
        - greatly improve colour allocation on colour-starved pseudocolour
          displays to avoid read-write cells instead of simply failing
          (this is only relevant for antique 8bpp frame buffers).
        - do not free fade colours when not doing fading (this is likely
          only relevant for antique 8bpp frame buffers).
    - do not specialcase 2 or 4 colour visuals, leading to
          simpler and actually more correct code.
        - hopefully no longer leak colours on !truecolour visuals.
        - use consistent method names (scr_recolour => scr_recolor).
        - use simpler (but slightly less bogus) formula for nearest
          colour choice (this is likely only relevant for antique 8bpp
          frame buffers).
        - remove fallback behaviour when initialising colours - the
          behaviour was inconsistent between startup vs. later and
          was only effective when valid colours couldn't be allocated.
* add rxvt-unicode-9.21-xsubpp.patch to correct wrong harcoded patch in makefile
* add rxvt-unicode-0001-Prefer-XDG_RUNTIME_DIR-over-the-HOME.patch
* removed unused rxvt-unicode-remove_unused_attribute.patch

- update to 9.20 (bnc#876101 CVE-2014-3121)
  - (libptytty) fix bug that prevented urxvtd from writing utmp
    entries when using --fork (reported by Ryan Kavanagh).
  - security bugfix: window property values could be queried even
    in secure mode (reported by Phillip Hallam-Baker).
  - fix build when perl is enabled and fading is disabled.
  - fix regression that broke continuous scrolling when pressing
    and holding the scrollbar up or down button, gentoo bug
    #493992.
  - increase the maximum length of a command sequence to 32k bytes,
    to allow longer OSC sequences (previous limit was 2k).
  - new Ctrl-Meta-c and Ctrl-Meta-v bindings to interact with the
    CLIPBOARD selection.
  - new extension: selection-to-clipboard.
  - the extensions macosx-clipboard and macosx-clipboard-native are
    deprecated and will be removed in the next release.  Support
    for the clipboard on OS X can be more generally enabled by
    setting the XQuartz preference to sync the OS X pasteboard
    and the X11 clipboard.
- dropped rxvt-return-in-nonvoid-function.patch included upstream

- added background perl module to files packaged

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  6 20:19:22 UTC 2013 - dhall@wustl.edu

- update to 9.19
  * work around perl 5.18.0 breakage in tabbed extension
    (reported by Karol Blazewicz) and in pod (Dominic Hargreaves).
  * fix regression that caused the double-click word selection to
  * erroneously include a tab on the left of the selected word.
  * implement FOCUS variable and focus_fade function in background
    expression, to allow focus-sensitive background images.
  * add support for the set cursor style (DECSCUSR) control
    function.
  * honour cursorColor also when the cursor style is underline.
  * export some Color_xxx constants to Perl.
  - 9.18
    * fix regression that caused artifacts on resize.
  - 9.17
    * add shade operator in background perl extension.
    * avoid starting or ending the selection in the middle of wide
      characters to avoid artifacts (reported by Tiago Resende).
    * fix artifacts that may occur if the character in the cursor
      cell has width > 1 (reported by Tiago Resende).
    * fix regression that causes artifacts on scrolling if
      saveLines is 0 and the window is resized (reported by Bert
      Münnich).
    * fix build when perl is enabled and pixbuf and transparency
      are disabled.
  - 9.16
    * the "so much new stuff your eyes will pop out" release.
    * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: renamed urlLauncher resource to url-launcher.
    * fix processing of DEC private mode save sequences (patch by Patrick
      Hemmer).
    * perl extensions now have their own manpages, installed as urxvt-NAME(1),
      e.g. urxvt-background(1) - see urxvt-extensions(1) for a list.
    * fix disabling of cursor blink with the option-popup menu (based on a
      patch by Jan Larres).
    * the font height is not augmented anymore when lineSpace is non zero.
    * fix "new pagemap" vs. "delete pagemap" mismatch ([] vs. non-[]),
      as diagnosed by clang.
    * fix height mismatch between active and inactive cursor when
      lineSpace is non zero (patch by Stanislav Seletskiy).
    * make it compile with LOCAL_X_IS_UNIX again (reported by
      nickfailure@gmail.com).
    * completely redone background pixmap support - users can now
      specify arbitrary expressions (And programs) that calculate
      new terminal backgrounds. see the urxvt-background manpage
      for details.
    * xrender is now required for background pixmap support.
    * perl extensions can now provide commandline switches and resources
      which show up in -help etc.
    * iso14755 51 mode window now displays row and column.
    * implement a -visual switch and move that and -depth to frills, also
      warn when we can't get the requested visual.
    * new env variable: RXVT_PERL_LIB.
    * allocate all screen memory in one go and let the virtual memory
      subsystem sort it out. this simplifies code, improves access
      locality, saves a bit of ram and makes things a bit faster, too.
    * remove support for libafterimage.
    * update to CVS version of libev, for a whopping 11kb size decrease.
    * do not ship yet another copy of ecb.h, use the one in libev or
      libptytty instead.
    * selectively mark some methods as cache-hot/cache cold, which
      might speed up execution but definitely decreases codesize.
    * Fix regression that prevented the scrollbar trough color
      from being applied (reported by Derek B. Noonburg).
    * Fix the scrollbar size for rxvt style (patch by Mark Robinson).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 22 02:11:41 UTC 2012 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- enable support for libstartup-notification
- update to 9.15:
  * finding a matching font (e.g. bold version of the base font) was broken
  * fix parsing of bg image styles: they really work now
  * fix blurring of bg image borders when using xrender
  * fix xrender blur on common xrender implementations that do not behave
    correctly when the same pixmap is used as source and destination in
    composite operations
  * fix regression that caused tabbed to compute the wrong size for tabs
  * allow again an empty suffix in a keysym list spec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 21 23:46:34 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 9.14:
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the urxvtd default socket path is now
    $HOME/.urxvt/urxvtd-<nodename>
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the "list" keysym expansion now requires loading of
    the "keysym-list" perl extension
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: A scale value of 0 in the bg image geometry no longer
    enables tiling, so as to make it possible to disable both scaling and
    tiling
  * overhaul of the bg image operations. The old operations have been
    deprecated in favour of elementary operations and styles built on top of
    the new operations and scale/position settings
  * support for libafterimage is deprecated and will be removed in the next
    release
  * fix a crash caused by selection_check not properly resetting out-of-bounds
    mark values (can happen when extending a selection while scrolling up in
    curses programs for example)
  * do not move the selection when scrolling up and the selection is outside
    the scrolling region
  * fix display of bold bright black
  * fix memory leak when urgentOnBell is set
  * fix a redraw bug that occurs when a bg pixmap is set and the wm does not
    honour the size hints set by urxvt. Now urxvt forces the size of the
    terminal window to be a multiple of the cell size
  * sanitise the argument of SD / SU sequences. Fixes a possible crash when the
    argument is big enough, red hat bug #711137
  * correctly split long lines when scrolling
  * urxvt now looks for perl extensions also in $HOME/.urxvt/ext
  * add bell-command perl extension to execute a command when a bell event
    occurs
  * add set_urgency perl binding to set/reset the urgency hint
  * consume button release event in matcher (exg)
  * keyboard accessible list of recent matches in matcher
  * properly process 'keysym' sequences in tabbed when using 'focus follows
    mouse' and the focus is on the main window but not on the active terminal
    window
  * support for the freedesktop startup-notification protocol
  * the direction of VPR and VPB commands was reversed
  * fix alignment of inherited root pixmap when it is a different size than the
    root window and the terminal window is off the left or top edge
  * make $self visible in "eval perl expression" popup action, also handle
    exceptions better
  * fix parsing of '-e' when it occurs as an option argument, such as in 'urxvt
    -title -e'

- changes from 9.12:
  * fix regression in processing of SelectionNotify events. urxvt would fail to
    request a selection if the owner did not support the UTF8_STRING target
  * fix rendering of double width chars in certain circumstances, more likely
    to happen if urxvt is compiled with 256 colors support as urxvt runs out of
    fonts much earlier then. Fixes gentoo bug #358151
  * restore support for 'list' syntax in keysym resources
  * always premultiply colour values - while this increases differences between
    core fonts and xft, it is "more correct" in practical situations
  * disable PTYTTY_REENTRANT option - not needed for urxvt and saves a bit of
    code
  * remove lucidatypewriter from the list of fallback fonts, it was the only
    non-xft non-cellfont in the list anyway

- changes from 9.11:
  * remove 'list' syntax for keysym resources, as it serves no useful purpose.
    If you need it, poke us and provide a use case
  * fix alpha channel support. Premultiply alpha in colours if the visual
    supports an alpha channel, as xrender expects premultiplied alpha
  * fix reply to a selection request sent by an obsolete client such as
    syncterm
  * fix crash when the window is resized and the overlay is active
  * match character-wise rather than byte-wise in selection extension again.
    perl 5.8.9+ is required to avoid extreme slowdowns. Fixes debian bugs
    #523072, #616463
  * fix a possible crash if the INCR transfer process for a selection property
    timeouts and at least one chunk is received
  * work around a memory corruption bug in xorg's XrmSetDatabase (apparently
    broken since http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-commit-diffs/2004-March/000239.html)
  * fix memory corruption bug when custom command sequences bound to keys were
    injected into an already-full pty input buffer
  * gdk-pixbuf is autodetected by default and preferred over libafterimage
  * do not prepend a newline to the selection text when the starting line of
    the selection is not highlighted
  * don't swap perl env with real env, save and restore it, just in case we
    ever get recursive perl invocations. also saves a bit of codespace with gcc
  * fix various memory leaks
  * fix typo in kIC terminfo capability, debian bug #446444
  * document 'thickness' resource
  * fix debian bug #504817, to the extent possible
  * add support for previewing the pasted data in confirm-paste
  * added "newlines to spaces" option in selection-popup
  * revert to 38400 baud max., mission accomplished
  * no longer create scary "pty_fill: PLEASE REPORT" message, instead, silently
    drain the input (problem is well understood now)
  * no longer swallow rob nation's own graphics mode commands

Mon Dec 27 23:33:34 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to version 9.10
  * fix minor memory leaks in urxvt and urxvtd
  * fix regression in urxvtd that prevented options from being
    correctly set
  * implement xterm's horribly broken 1005 mouse reporting mode,
    and an alternative 1015 mode that works in non-utf-8 locales
    and has fewer limitations
  * fix a possible bug where mouse notifications didn't work after
    startup for the upper left corner
  * implement our own pixbuf to pixmap rendering to get rid of
    dependency on buggy gdk-pixbuf-xlib; only truecolor visuals are
    supported
  * apply tinting before shading when both operations are
    requested: previously they were intermixed when lightening and
    the result was inaccurate and confusing; note that now a black
    tint yields a completely black image, regardless of shading
  * avoid spurious redraws of the bg image when bg is transparent
    or when using 'root' mode
  * dynamically number options according to compiletime requirements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 10 21:46:54 UTC 2010 - mrueckert@suse.de

- reenable 256bit support:
  the 256color support is a compile time option. so we provide 2
  binaries now.

  WARNING: you need a patched screen on < 11.4 to use the 256color
  version.

  - binaries come as <binname>-256color
  - removed --with-term from the configure params.
    each of the binaries will set correct TERM variable depending
    on the compile time option
  - added note to README.SuSE
- spec clean up
- added --enable-warnings to see the compiler warnings

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Emanuele Giaquinta).
  - make sure pagewise scrolling scrolls at least one line

  - add highlightTextColor resource to change the foreground colour
    of highlighted characters (Emanuele Giaquinta).
  - make highlightColor apply also to selected cells with reverse
    video but not to non selected cells with reverse video

    when part of them was deleted (tracked down by Miroslav Lichvar).
  - artificially enlargen the previous character at the end of a line
    when trying to output a character that doesn't fit. looks ugly, but

    no longer apply.
  - the urgency hint is now cleared on both focus in and focus out.
  - cache urgency hint locally to avoid server rtt on every focus change.

  - ignore byte-order marks and do not treat them like combining characters.
  - fix build issue when CURSOR_BLINK is not defined (Emanuele Giaquinta).
  - do some µ-optimisations to the character fast path.
  - use a less cunning, but more robust algorithm to avoid one terminal
    monopolising the whole process by outputting a lot of text.
  - try to work around linux first breaking sched_yield and now breaking
    the only known workaround.
  - new option -icon to set _NET_WM_ICON (based on patch by Frank Schmitt).
  - initialise the as visual only on demand, instead of unconditionally,
    to save memory in the common case of not using visual gimmicks.
  - try to work around bugs in a few wm's that errornously resize
    client windows on hint property updates by temporarily
    disabling size hints.
  - implement the DECSTR soft reset sequence and use it for tput init,
    and make hard RIS and DECSTR both reset more private modes, such
    as mouse reporting.
  - redundantly clear mouse reporting and a few other states in
    tput init/tput reset, for older urxvts.
  - partial/full clear screens did cause flickering and possibly pixel
    droppings when urxvt viewed the scrollback buffer.
  - use current rendition style in DCH sequence.
  - the 132/80 mode switch no longer forces a screen reset.
  - add an osc sequence to change the border colour (Emanuele Giaquinta).
  - new perl extension "overlay-osc", for status displays and the like.
  - fix some minor cursor drawing issues with overlays by allowing
    overlays to modify screen flags (to disable the cursor themselves).
  - work around programs not restoring rstyle before rmcup
    (analysed by Miroslav Lichvar).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 16 11:49:44 CEST 2009 - coolo@novell.com

- fix build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 11 18:01:01 CEST 2008 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 9.05
  - new option --cd/chdir to set the starting working directory.
  - tabbed extension now starts in the "correct" working directory.
  - work around fedora 9 providing isastream but not the relevant
    header file for it (report by Tuncer Ayaz).
  - upgrade libev, fixing a bug in the select backend with more
    than 31 file descriptors on non-linux 64 bit systems.
  - correctly reset the multibyte state to the initial one after
    EILSEQ (patch by Neil Booth). This fixes the issue of
    rxvt-unicode not properly displaying text after an illegal
    sequence on NetBSD and probably other systems.
  - more intelligent property handling with -pe tabbed, works
    around broken window managers (kwm et al.), saves bandwidth and
    should help working window managers as well.
  - made tabs moveable (based on a patch by Petr Machata).
  - implement ESC [ 3 K as a more rational alternative to ESC [ 0 K.
  - support relative paths for RXVT_SOCKET in urxvtd.
  - the tabbed extension now blindly copies over all (rxvt-)
    resources from the toplevel window to the children.
  - better diagnostic on 0x0 window geometries.
  - update AnyEvent API to version 3.4 and above.
  - document the default value of :0 for DISPLAY.
  - rename perl method XChangeWindowProperty to XChangeProperty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - the "exg makes everybody happy" release.
  - fix build with !xft.
  - always compile in plain style scrollbar.

  - add buffered resource to control xft double-buffering.
- additional changes from 9.0
  - fix a crash bug where urxvtd would crash when urxvtc was called
    with wrong arguments (I wish debian maintainers in general
    would report bugs and their proposed fixes to the original
    package maintaienrs instead of sitting on them for good measure
    to see if anybody notices).
  - drawing xft compose characters was causing garbage to be drawn.
  - correctly clear xft character background in all cases.
  - implement bracketed paste mode (xterm private mode 2004).
  - improve documentation on alpha channel handling, make urxvt
    work better on servers lacking the RENDER extension when alpha
    channels or background images are used.
  - check for refresh after initialising to avoid staying blank
    till the first event arrives. or so.
  - the FORCE_UNBUFFERED_XFT feature macro works again.
  - continuously update transparency while moving/resizing now.
  - OSC 39/49 are deprecated and aliased to OSC 10/11.
  - cub1 now acts as advertised (and ignores the "wrapped" state).
  - the 132/80 mode switch now forces a height of 24, too, and
    resets the terminal.
  - scrollbar code cleanups.
  - stopping children is no longer confused with children exiting.
  - removed (undocumented) #aarrggbb format.
  - updated to libev 3.0.
- additional changes from 8.9
  - fix the issue where urxvtd would not immediately close a window
    when the command exited but only on the next X event.
  - changed terminfo file not to use application keypad mode.
  - fix the issue where making a selection in one urxvtd window
    would not clear it visually in another.
  - fix an issue of urxvt not getting background pixmap updates and
    flickering after bg pixmap changes (reported by Mikachu).
  - fix redraw bug in xterm scrollbar with -sr
    (reported by Mikachu).
  - correctly provide dependencies for libev (µikachu).
  - minor code reorganisations and cleanups.
  - be more robust in case the urxvt-popup extension cannot be
    loaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 23 17:42:24 CET 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 8.8
  - option -C was aliased to all unsupported options, activating
    options that shouldn't be compiled in, leading to interesting
    effects.
  - updated libev, working around a bug in linux 2.4, curing the
    symptom of urxvt not closing its window on shell exit. also
    fixes a problem with urxvt not refreshing.
  - the text blink callback was called even when no blinking text
    was visible.
  - pre-8.4 slipwheeling behaviour has been reinstated, with some
    minor improvements.
  - streamlined x events processing to only flush once per display
    and not once per terminal window.
  - quite a bit of minor code cleanups and codesize optimisations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  4 16:42:15 CET 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 8.7
  - update libev with an important bugfix that would cause crashes
    when closing windows (when using rxvtd, and update is
    recommended).
  - do not compile in the block builtin graphics with
    --disable-frills.
- additional changes from 8.6
  - upgrade libev to disable kqueue on anything but netbsd as it
    seems to be broken everywhere else w.r.t. ptys.
  - allow for spurious event notifications, as at least epoll and
    especially solaris ports like to lie about them (symptoms:
    urxvt "hangs" until there is some x11 related activity).
  - -keysym command line options are now subjected to xlib parsing.
  - add 'xrm' option analogous to Xt one.
- additional changes from 8.5a
  - make it compile with --disable-transparency.

Sun Feb 18 20:27:16 CET 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 8.2:
  - fix make depend in src/, reported by exg.
  - fixed typo in urxvt::GET_CUSTOM, causing the result to be
    wrong. (patch by Sergey Vlasov).
  - unbundled iom perl interface somewhat.
  - scrollbar-xterm now uses the selected scrollColor instead of
    fg (found by Aiviru).
  - disabled linux kernel bug workaround again: disabling it
    gives a 50% speed hit on affected machines, while enabling
    it gives a similar speed hit to screen, which is likely the
    more common case to work around for :/
  - urxvt::rend2mask perl function, and utilization of it by
    matcher (patch by Moshe Kamensky).
  - use perl:matcher on a keysym to open most recently displayed
    URL.
  - with matcher, when multiple patterns match, last wins, not
    first.
  - fix make and make install with srcdir != builddir.
  - updated bundled libptytty to fix a bug where the tty would be
    kept open (see the libptytty ChangeLog for details).
  - delay setting the IUTF8 flag to after the tty settings have
    been set so its value does not get lost (reported and analysed
    by Andrei Paskevich).
  - rip out support for obsolete sgtty.h interface.
  - rip out support for non-POSIX termios variants.
  - update libptytty.
  - update iom.C, make it call ptytty::sanitise_stdfd on init.
  - when !XFT, change rounding of colours to use a less correct
    formula to meet user expectancies (#aaa becomes #a000a000a000
    not #9f9f9f9f9f9f).
  - change the starting offset of the pixmap set with
    backgroundPixmap from (50,50) to (0,0).
  - fix a typo in button_release, now meta-button2 request the
    value of the Clipboard selection as it should (patch by Serge
    Koksharov).
  - fix a bug in drawing a cell with a nonspacing char when using
    an xft font with inheritPixmap and tintColor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 17 18:58:07 CET 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 8.1:
  - fix the assumption that chars < 256 are single-width. Now only
    assume this for codepoints 32 to 126 (reported by Dai.H.).
  - $term->strwidth returned wide chars as width 1, because some
    jerk confused min and max. Fixing this also fixes xim-onthespot.
    Reported by Takano Akio.
  - secondaryScroll is now enabled by default (as per the manpage),
    reported by exg.
  - correct the description of [percent]color rgba format in the
    manpage.
  - incorporated macosx-clipboard extension by Samuel Ljungkvist.
  - ignore (some) useless focus events. (reported by mmc)

Fri Nov  3 02:38:56 CET 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- uptdate to version 8.0:
  Combining characters will no longer erase the characters below
  them. Font bold/italic morphing will not be applied to
  manually-specified fonts. A crash when using non-UTF-8 locales
  (e.g. C) has been fixed. The powerful "matcher" extension now
  replaces mark-urls. The outline cursor color is now correct;
  starting urxvtc in an inaccessible directory no longer crashes
  urxvtd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 14 13:28:01 CEST 2006 - mfabian@suse.de

- fix configure.ac test for working Xlocale (makes XIM work again).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 11 20:53:39 CEST 2006 - mfabian@suse.de

- move stuff from /usr/X11R6/ to /usr/ (because of X11R7).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  7 22:15:26 CEST 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to version 7.9:
  * fix the crashing bug people encountered with 7.8 + urxvtd +
    perl + transparency. Oight to fix debian bug #380348.
  * fix urxvtc.1.pod: it actually claimed -pty-fd would not work.
    But it does! :->
  * rxvt_fatal() in case the locale string is too long for our
    static buffer.
  * fixed many, many, typos in the manpages (patch supplied by ves)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  7 03:27:38 CEST 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- added -DXPM_INC_X11=1 to the CFLAGS so we properly link with xpm
  on 10.2 and newer
- a little bit spec file cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 17:55:56 CEST 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to version 7.8:
  This release primarily fixes a lot of bugs but also adds a few
  minor features: unlike Xt and previous versions, rxvt-unicode
  now always reads $HOME/.Xdefaults, a kuake-like extension has
  been added, Xft and X11 colours now agree (this fixes colour
  banding effects), hilightcolour-support has been re-enabled,
  the "depth" resource is now respected, several Debian patches
  have been integrated, and double-buffered Xft is now
  configurable via features.h. Many minor bugs have been fixed.

- WARNING this version seems to have a broken daemon mode (urxvtd)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 17:14:50 CEST 2006 - schwab@suse.de

- Fix broken configure check.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 17 18:07:42 CEST 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- added rxvt-unicode-7.7_utmp_including.patch:
  UTMP_FILE is defined in /usr/include/utmp.h
  if you want to check for it, you have to include it before
  checking for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 23 13:54:30 CEST 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- No longer install the terminfo file. It is part of the terminfo
  package now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 16 20:19:43 CEST 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to version 7.7
  o use double-buffered drawing (xft fonts only). On many
    driver/hardware combination this actually increases xft
    drawing speed, at the expense of more network bandwidth and
    slight nausea on the side of the author.
  o readline perl extension now requires shift-click instead of
    a normal click, and eats the click.
  o tabbed perl extension now supports -e.
  o disabled graphics-exposures on the main drawing GC, report
    any refresh bugs please.
  o improve property handling for -pe tabbed: avoid unnecessary
    property changes (for kde's benefit) at the expense of extra
    round-trips, improve size hint setting.
  o modified XIM according to a patch sent by Takano Akio that
    sets the preedit rectangle for OverTheSpot, which helps some
    input methods to correctly position their preedit window.
  o un-optimise the line clearing on newly scrolled-in lines a
    bit: the former reasoning was that any fg colour on default bg
    looks the same in empts spaces, but thats not true when
    reversing (e.g.  selection), so also check for matching fg
    colours. This fixes the problem where selecting newly
    scrolled-in lines would exhibit wrong colours.
  o fix a bug in the perl interface causing focus in events to
    generate focus out perl events, causing bad focus effects
    with -pe tabbed.
  o fix a race resulting in a crash on exiting.
  o fix a with --disable-xft that caused xfreecolors to be called
    on colors never allocated, resulting in aborts
    (reported by Paco-Paco).
  o resources on non-initial screens weren't refetched correctly
    (reported by Paco-Paco).
  o fix a bug in xcopyarea pass and _disable_ it, as it seems not
    to be working in either rxvt-unicode nor in the original rxvt.
  o removed undocumented -exec alias for the -e option.

- Additional changes from 7.6:
  o changed interpretation of [alpha] colour prefix.
  o +option now really sets the option to default, instead of
    using the resource value.
  o options that require an argument now really _require_ an
    argument.
  o the tabbed extension now forwards focus and keys events to
    th relevant tab window.
  o tab colours are now configurable and have sensible defaults
    (initial patch by hednod).
  o option menu is extendable, readline, selection and selection-
    autotransform can now be disabled/enabled at runtime.
  o forcing a configure event to tabbed subwindows with -pe
    tabbed, for the benefit of automove-background.
  o the automove-background extension added a wrong constant
    offset.
  o force refresh of XA_RESOURCE_STRING on virtual reconnect.
  o return exit status 2 in urxvtc when urxvtd couldn't be
    contacted.
  o the linux yield hack is back, now using usleep, and enabled
    only on __linux__.
  o further round trip eliminations in the !XFT case by
    remembering the colour components.
  o plain scrollbar works better with -sr.
  o fixed half-shadow scrollbar look.
  o more colour rtt optimisations.
  o properly(?) free colours on window close.
  o reorganised the FAQ into multiple sections.
  o add ISO646.1991-IRV to the list of supported codesets.
  o minor libptytty update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 01 11:17:02 CET 2006 - mfabian@suse.de

- add "Provides: locale(xorg-x11:ja;ko;zh)".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 31 23:41:13 CET 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to version 7.5
  o further improvements to the careful mode detection, and font width
    detection:
    o fully double-wide fonts will now be correctly treated,
    o overlap detection was improved.
    o detect totally broken fonts (usually synthesized by xft).
    o careful mode forced refresh sometimes clashed with blinking,
      causing unnecessary screen redraws.
  o better handling of XFT combining characters.
  o enable antialiasing for some replacement fonts, as they
    might get used for other encodings which really need it, later.
  o remove spacing=100 from all default fonts, as this creates totally
    weird spacing (5 times normal) with xft.
  o removed iso10646 fallback, as xorgs iso10646 encoded fonts are mostly
    broken.
  o removed gnu unifont fallback, all combining characters are broken.
  o replace named colours by xorg's rgb.txt equivalents, to
    reduce round trip time on startup, and short-cut allocation
    of rgb:rr/gg/bb for xft.
  o short-cut allocation of rgb values in the xlib case
    (patch by Paco-Paco).
  o overhauled color management: smaller codesize, alpha support.
  o support "rgba:rrrr/gggg/bbbb/aaaa" color specifications and
    an "[alpha]" prefix.
  o try to work around Xft and Xrender forcing everything to be 100%
    transparent. Long Live Xft!
  o do not include X11/Intrinsic.h anymore, directly use
    Xlib/Xutil/Xresource directly.
  o try to find a nearest matching color when color allocation fails
    on a pseudocolor screen.
  o SYNCCVS: compared to rxvt-cvs 2006-01-28, no relevant changes.
  o fix version report (DA) (which was unfortunately broken).
  o changed version number report again, now to emulate xterm closer.
  o added the OSC sequence 702 to detect the urxvt version number.
  o small configure updates.
  o further RTT optimisations.

- additional changes from 7.4
  o screen background wasn't always erased properly when scrolling,
  o re-enabled clearing optimisation disabled in 7.4pre.
  o small configure updates for libptytty.
  o fixed version options: line output.
  o removed stoopid debugging message left in the code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 13:01:49 CET 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 7.3
  o don't let iso14755 or mouse reporting get into the way of perl
    (could lead to global grabs never being cleared).
  o experimental OnTheSpot editing support (-pe xim-onthespot).
  o moved Shift-Button2 paste combination to Meta-Button2.
  o the cutchars resource will now be respected and used by the
    selection extension.
  o added the "remote-clipboard" extension which just runs
    external commands to fetch and store the selection data.
  o added -depth switch that tries to get a different visual depth
    than the default (replaces the old PREFER_24_BIT logic).
  o removed (unused) arabic presentation form composing sequences.
  o be more strict when deciding that a core font glyph is too
    wide and needs the careful rendering mode.
  o allow more leeway for italic fonts when deciding that a
    character is too wide and needs careful mode.
  o redraw even more characters around characters using careful
    mode.
  o made selection-pastebin fully asynchronous.
  o reduced number of server turnarounds at startup by allocating
    atoms only once per display.
  o renamed on_keyboard_command to on_user_command.
  o changed version sos (ESC [ > c) response to be more compatible
    with xterm.
