- Remove with_daap defines since all versions of openSUSE we build
  for have the required version of libdmapsharing. It was also set
  up wrong so we had the unfortunate error that we didn't build
  daap support for any release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 25 09:48:14 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  7 15:52:37 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + Conditionally enable pkgconfig()-BuildRequires: clutter-1.0,
    clutter-gst-2.0, clutter-gtk-1.0, clutter-x11-1.0 and newly
    added mx-1.0.
  + Disabled per default, as mx-1.0 is not maintained and not
    available on openSUSE anymore.
- No longer replace clutter-gst-2.0 with clutter-gst-3.0 in
  configure: the change is useless, as the visualisation plugin can
  not be built in any case.

  + Updated translations.
- Replace pkgconfig() BuildRequires for GStreamer 1.0 port:
  + Old: gstreamer-0.10, gstreamer-interfaces-0.10,
    gstreamer-pbutils-0.10, gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10.
  + New: gstreamer-1.0, gstreamer-audio-1.0, gstreamer-base-1.0,
    gstreamer-pbutils-1.0, gstreamer-plugins-base-1.0.
- Replace pkgconfig(gnome-keyring-1) BuildRequires with
  pkgconfig(libsecret-1), following upstream.
- Enable pkgconfig(clutter-gst-2.0) BuildRequires: with the port
  to GStreamer 1.0, also clutter-gst was ported.
- Replace gnome-doc-utils-devel BuildRequires with yelp-tools,
  following upstreams port to the new documentation infrastructure.
- Drop rhythmbox-no-webkit-no-context-pane.patch: fixed upstream.
- Drop gnome-common BuildRequires and call to autogen.sh, as we
  don't carry patches touching the build system anymore.
- Change with_webkit defines to %{suse_version} > 1220: the
  GStreamer 1.0 / 0.10 conflictt is no longer a problem on opeSUSE
  12.3 and newer (webkit and rhythmbox both link Gst 1.0 in this
  case).
- Introduce with_daap defines: libdmapsharing >= 2.9.16 is
  required, which does not yet exist.
- No longer pass --disable-scrollkeeper to configure: it is no
  longer recognized after the move to yelp-tools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 31 20:33:36 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Disable webkit support (define with_webkit 0) (bnc#787216,
  bnc#783923).
  Based on the defines, we conditionally:
  + Enable pkgconfig(webkitgtk-3.0) BuildRequires (with_webkit 1).
  + Enable packaging of the context pane plugin (with_webkit 1).
  + Pass --without-webkit to configure (with_webkit 0).
- Add rhythmbox-no-webkit-no-context-pane.patch: if webkit support
  is disabled, the context pane plugin should not be built (as it
  can't work without webkit).
- Add gnome-common BuildRequires and call to autogen.sh, as above
  patch touches the build system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  1 19:49:54 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.98:
  + New dialog for importing music into the library
  + New audio CD metadata lookup library, replacing libmusicbrainz
  + Improved transitions between album art images

    bgo#684304, bgo#684333.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop pkgconfig(libmusicbrainz4): upstream replaced libmusicbrain
  usage with GStreamer and libsoup.
- Replace pkgconfig(clutter-gst-1.0) BuildRequires with
  pkgconfig(clutter-gst-2.0): openSUSE 12.3 no longer ships
  clutter-gst-1.0. The replacement BuildRequire is currently
  commented out, as rhythmbox can't make use of clutter-gst-2.0 yet
  due to the changed APIs. As a consequence we do not provide the
  visualizer plugin at the moment.
- Drop pkgconfig(gconf-2.0) BuildRequires: no longer needed.
- Drop rhythmbox-CVE-2012-3355.patch: fixed upstream.
- Drop rhythmbox-link-discid.patch: fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 21 21:31:23 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Some of those changes were already in our package thanks to
  rhythmbox-port-gtk3.patch. Drop it now rhythmbox-port-gtk3.patch.
- Re-enable translation-update-upstream in %setup, now that
  rhythmbox-port-gtk3.patch is gone.
- Remove gnome-common BuildRequires and call to gnome-autogen.sh,
  that were only needed for rhythmbox-port-gtk3.patch.
- Remove fdupes BuildRequires since we don't call %fdupes.
- Add and remove pkgconfig() BuildRequires, following upstream
  changes:
  + Added: clutter-1.0, clutter-gst-1.0, clutter-gtk-1.0,
    clutter-x11-1.0, gconf-2.0, grilo-0.1,
    gstreamer-interfaces-0.10, gstreamer-pbutils-0.10, mx-1.0, tdb.
  + Removed: dbus-glib-1, libgnome-media-profiles-3.0.
- Change pkgconfig(pygobject-2.0) BuildRequires to
  pkgconfig(pygobject-3.0).
- Add xz BuildRequires because we can't build a package for a
  xz-compressed tarball without explicitly specifying that... See
  bnc#697467 for more details.
- Remove python-coherence Recommends: the upnp-coherencde plugin is
  now gone.
- Change --disable-vala configure option to --enable-vala.
- Remove now non-existing --disable-schemas-install configure
  option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  6 15:24:58 UTC 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 27 14:33:34 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Remove mozilla-xulrunner-devel BuildRequires: it was only there
  for the NPAPI headers, but rhythmbox actually uses a private copy
  of those headers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  7 16:15:27 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Package the DAAP plugin again, now that the version of
  libdmapsharing in Factory is new enough.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  4 11:30:52 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Move to pkgconfig()-style BuildRequires:
  + Note that the package won't build on old distributions anyway
    because of the GNOME 3 port, so using pkgconfig()-style doesn't
    break anything.
  + Old ones: brasero-devel, dbus-1-glib-devel,
    gstreamer010-plugins-base-devel, json-glib-devel,
    libavahi-glib-devel, libgnome-keyring-devel, libgpod-devel,
    libgudev-1_0-devel, libmtp-devel, libmusicbrainz3-devel,
    libnotify-devel, libsoup-devel, totem-pl-parser-devel.
  + New ones: avahi-glib, dbus-glib-1, json-glib-1.0,
    gnome-keyring-1, gstreamer-0.10, gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10,
    gudev-1.0, libbrasero-media3, libgpod-1.0, libmtp,
    libmusicbrainz3, libnotify, libsoup-2.4, libsoup-gnome-2.4,
    totem-plparser.
- Change libwebkit-devel BuildRequires to pkgconfig(), to build
  against the GTK+ 3 version of webkit.
- Change python-gstreamer-0_10-devel, python-gtk-devel
  BuildRequires to pkgconfig(pygobject-2.0) as only python-gobject
  is needed for the GTK+ 3 port.
- Change python-gstreamer-0_10 Requires to python-gobject, for the
  same reason.
- Remove unneeded gcc-c++, libmusicbrainz-devel BuildRequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  infrastructure. This patch brings us to git commit e0e5d06e.
- Add gnome-common BuildRequires and call to gnome-autogen.sh,
  needed for the patch.
- Disable translation-update-upstream for the moment as the patch
  breaks this.

  libgnome-media-profiles-3.0, libpeas-1.0, libpeas-gtk-1.0.
- Add gobject-introspection-devel BuildRequires.

  on the GNOME 3 platform yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 12 19:50:10 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:
  + %desktop_database_post/postun because the package ships at
    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.
- Pass %{?no_lang_C} to %find_lang so that english documentation
  can be packaged with the program, and not in the lang subpackage.
- Change Requires of lang subpackage to Recommends, since the
  english documentation is not there anymore.

    player devices

  + Initial implementation of the Rygel MediaServer2 D-Bus
    specification
