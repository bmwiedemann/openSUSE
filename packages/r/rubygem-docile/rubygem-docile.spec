%description
Docile treats the methods of a given ruby object as a DSL (domain specific
language) within a given block. 
Killer feature: you can also reference methods, instance variables, and local
variables from the original (non-DSL) context within the block. 
Docile releases follow Semantic Versioning as defined at semver.org.
