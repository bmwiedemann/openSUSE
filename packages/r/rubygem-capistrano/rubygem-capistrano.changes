 https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/compare/v3.3.5...v3.4.0
 
 * Fixed fetch revision for annotated git tags. (@igorsokolov)
 * Fixed updating roles when custom user or port is specified. (@ayastreb)
 * Disables statistics collection.
 
 * `bin/` is not suggested to be in `linked_dirs` anymore (@kirs)
   * bin/ is often checked out into repo
   * https://github.com/capistrano/bundler/issues/45#issuecomment-69349237
 
 * Bugfix:
   * release_roles did not honour additional property filtering (@townsen)
   * Refactored and simplified property filtering code (@townsen)
 
 * Breaking Changes
   * Hosts with the same name are now consolidated into one irrespective of the
     user and port. This allows multiple declarations of a server to be made safely.
     The last declared properties will win. See capistrnorb.com Properties documentation
     for details.
   * Inside the on() block the host variable is now a copy of the host, so changes can be
     made within the block (such as dynamically overriding the user) that will not persist.
     This is very convenient for switching the SSH user temporarily to 'root' for example.
 
 * Minor changes
   * Add role_properties() method (see capistrano.github.io PR for doc) (@townsen)
   * Add equality syntax ( eg. port: 1234) for property filtering (@townsen)
   * Add documentation regarding property filtering (@townsen)
   * Clarify wording and recommendation in stage template. (@Kriechi)
     * Both available syntaxes provide similar functionality, do not use both for the same server+role combination.
   * Allow specification of repo_path using stage variable
     default is as before (@townsen)
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  6 18:18:17 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 3.3.5
 * Fixed setting properties twice when creating new server. See [issue
   #1214](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/issues/1214) (@ayastreb)
 
 ## `3.3.4`
 
 https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/compare/v3.3.3...v3.3.4
 
 * Minor changes:
   * Rely on a newer version of capistrano-stats with better privacy (@leehambley)
   * Fix cucumber spec for loading tasks from stage configs (@sponomarev)
   * Minor documentation fixes (@deeeki, @seuros, @andresilveira)
   * Spec improvements (@dimitrid, @sponomarev)
   * Fix to CLI flags for git-ls-remote (@dimitrid)
 
 ## `3.3.3`
 
 https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/compare/v3.2.1...v3.3.3
 
 * Enhancement (@townsen)
   * Added the variable `:repo_tree` which allows the specification of a sub-tree that
     will be extracted from the repository. This is useful when deploying a project
     that lives in a subdirectory of a larger repository.
     Implemented only for git and hg.
     If not defined then the behaviour is as previously and the whole repository is
     extracted (subject to git-archive `.gitattributes` of course).
 
 * Enhancement (@townsen): Remove unnecessary entries from default backtrace
 
     When the `--backtrace` (or `--trace`) command line option is not supplied
     Rake lowers the noise level in exception backtraces by building
     a regular expression containing all the system library paths and
     using it to exclude backtrace entries that match.

Sun May 18 09:04:37 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 3.2.1
 
 * Bug Fixes:
   * 3.2.0 introduced some behaviour to modify the way before/after hooks were called, to allow the optional
     preservation of arguments to be passed to tasks. This release reverts that commit in order to restore
     original functionality, and fix (fairly serious) bugs introduced by the refactoring.
 
 * Minor changes:
   * Update dsl#local_user method and add test for it. (@bruno-)
   * Revert short sha1 revision with git. (@blaugueux)
   * Changed asking question to more standard format (like common unix commandline tools) (@sponomarev)
   * Fixed typos in the README. (@sponomarev)
   * Added `keys` method to Configuration to allow introspection of configuration options. (@juanibiapina)
 
 ## `3.2.0`
 
 The changelog entries here are incomplete, because many authors choose not to
 be credited for their work, check the tag comparison link for Github.
 
 https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0
 
 * Minor changes:
   * Added `keys` method to Server properties to allow introspection of automatically added
     properties.
   * Compatibility with Rake 10.2.0 - `ensure_task` is now added to `@top_level_tasks` as a string. (@dmarkow)
   * Amended the git check command, "ls-remote", to use "-h", limiting the list to refs/heads

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 20 09:29:44 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 3.1.0
 Breaking changes:
 
   * `deploy:restart` task **is no longer run by default**.
     From this version, developers who restart the app on each deploy need to declare it in their deploy flow (eg `after 'deploy:publishing', 'deploy:restart'`).
 
     Please, check https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/commit/4e6523e1f50707499cf75eb53dce37a89528a9b0 for more information. (@kirs)
 
 * Minor changes
   * Tasks that used `linked_dirs` and `linked_files` now run on all roles, not just app roles (@mikespokefire)
   * Tasks `deploy:linked_dirs`, `deploy:make_linked_dirs`, `deploy:linked_files`, `deploy:cleanup_rollback`,
     `deploy:log_revision` and `deploy:revert_release` now use `release_roles()` not `roles()` meaning that they
     will only run on servers where the `no_release` property is not falsy. (@leehambley)
   * Fixed bug when `deploy:cleanup` was executed twice by default (@kirs)
   * Config location can now be changed with `deploy_config_path` and `stage_config_path` options (@seenmyfate)
   * `no_release` option is now available (@seenmyfate)
   * Raise an error if developer tries to define `:all` role, which is reserved (@kirs)
   * `deploy:fallback` hook was added to add some custom behaviour on failed deploy (@seenmyfate)
   * Correctly infer namespace in task enhancements (@seenmyfate)
   * Add SHA to revision log (@blackxored)
   * Allow configuration of multiple servers with same hostname but different ports (@rsslldnphy)
   * Add command line option to control role filtering (@andytinycat)
   * Make use of recent changes in Rake to over-ride the application name (@shime)
   * Readme corrections (@nathanstitt)
   * Allow roles to be fetched with a variable containing an array (@seenmyfate)
   * Improve console (@jage)
   * Add ability to filter tasks to specific servers (host filtering). (@andytinycat)
   * Add a command line option to control role filter (`--roles`) (@andytinycat)
   * Use an SCM object with a pluggable strategy (@coffeeaddict)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 22 08:40:26 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- update to 2.12.0
  This release reverts the very verbose logging introduced in the previous version, it also
  enables a handful of power-user features which are largely un-documented, but shouldn't be

  read through deploy.rb in the Gem if you want to know how a new feature works!

   * Add the "rpm" remote dependency. Nick Hoffman (nickhoffman)
   * Add commented deploy:cleanup task to default recipe. Jean-Philippe Doyle (j15e)
   * Teach deploy:web:enable to fail gracefully. Lee Marlow (lmarlow)
   * Ticket 193 alias task show wrong name when it is not overridden. Rafa García (rgo)
   * Allow configuration of which roles assets are precompiled on. Frederick Cheung (fcheung)
   * Fix transfer action to honor dry-run flag. Serg Podtynnyi (shtirlic)
   * Changed single to double quotes for Windows, fixes a Windows bug in the HG module. Matthew J Morrison (mattjmorrison)
   * Add UnsharedRemoteCache (copied from eycap gem). Ben Symonds (bensymonds)
  
  As ever, a sincere thanks to all contributors, and do not hesitate to contact me if this
  release causes problems for you.
