- Update to version 3.1.3 [bsc#1076503]:
  Protocol: 31 (unchanged)

- SECURITY FIXES:
  * Fixed a buffer overrun in the protocol's handling of xattr names and
    ensure that the received name is null terminated.
  * Fix an issue with --protect-args where the user could specify the arg
    in the protected-arg list and short-circuit some of the arg-sanitizing
    code.

- BUG FIXES:
  * Don't output about a new backup dir without appropriate info verbosity.
  * Fixed some issues with the sort functions in support/rsyncstats script.
  * Added a way to specify daemon config lists (e.g. users, groups, etc)
  * that contain spaces (see "auth users" in the latest rsyncd.conf manpage).
  * If a backup fails (e.g. full disk) rsync exits with an error.
  * Fixed a problem with a doubled --fuzzy option combined with --link-dest.
  * Avoid invalid output in the summary if either the start or end time had
    an error.
  * We don't allow a popt alias to affect the --daemon or --server options.
  * Fix daemon exclude code to disallow attribute changes in addition to
    disallowing transfers.
  * Don't force nanoseconds to match if a non-transferred, non-checksummed
    file only passed the quick-check w/o comparing nanosecods.

- ENHANCEMENTS:
  * Added the ability for rsync to compare nanosecond times in its
    file-check
    comparisons, and added support nanosecond times on Mac OS X.
  * Added a short-option (-@) for --modify-window.
  * Added the --checksum-choice=NAME[,NAME] option to choose the checksum
    algorithms.
  * Added hashing of xattr names (with using -X) to improve the handling of
    files with large numbers of xattrs.
  * Added a way to filter xattr names using include/exclude/filter rules
    (see the --xattrs option in the manpage for details).
  * Added "daemon chroot|uid|gid" to the daemon config (in addition to the
    old chroot|uid|gid settings that affect the daemon's transfer process).
  * Added "syslog tag" to the daemon configuration.
  * Some manpage improvements.

- DEVELOPER RELATED:
  * Tweak the "make" output when yodl isn't around to create the man pages.
  * Changed an obsolete autoconf compile macro.
  * Support newer yodl versions when converting man pages.

- Dropped patches fixed upstream:
  * rsync-CVE-2017-16548.patch
  * rsync-3.1.2-CVE-2018-5764.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 29 13:53:04 UTC 2011 - puzel@novell.com

- update to rsync-3.0.8 
 - Notable changes:
  - Fixed two buffer-overflow issues.
  - Fixed a data-corruption issue when preserving hard-links
    without preserving file ownership, and doing deletions either
    before or during the transfer (CVE-2011-1097).  
  - Fixed a potential crash when an rsync daemon has a
    filter/exclude list and the transfer is using ACLs or xattrs.
  - Fixed a hang if a really large file is being processed by an
    rsync that can't handle 64-bit numbers.  
  - For devices and special files, we now avoid gathering useless
    ACL and/or xattr information for files that aren't being
    copied.  
  - Properly handle requesting remote filenames that start with a
    dash.  
  - Fixed a bug in the comparing of upper-case letters in file
    suffixes for --skip-compress.
  - If an rsync daemon has a module configured without a path
    setting, rsync will now disallow access to that module.
  - Some improvements to the hard-linking code to ensure that
    device-number hashing is working right, and to supply more
    information if the hard-link code fails.
  - Fixed a bug that prevented --numeric-ids from disabling the
    translation of user/group IDs for ACLs.
  - The --link-dest checking for identical symlinks now avoids
    considering attribute differences that cannot be changed on the
    receiver.
  - Fixed a bug with --fake-super when copying files and dirs that
    aren't user writable.
  - Fixed a bug where a sparse file could have its last sparse
    block turned into a real block when rsync sets the file size
    (requires ftruncate).
  - Fixed the working of --force when used with --one-file-system.
  - Various manpage improvements.
- run spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 19 10:55:59 UTC 2010 - jengelh@medozas.de

- rsyncd.rc changes:
* Do not use killproc -TERM, but just killproc, so that killproc
  waits until the service is actually shut down, before attempting
  to restart it (when "restart" is used). Fixes bnc#546977.
* Change the "reload" action to return "missing" because rsyncd
  does not handle SIGHUP
* Adjust "force-reload" accordingly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 14:21:21 UTC 2010 - puzel@novell.com

- update to rsync-3.0.7 
  - Fixed a bogus free when using --xattrs with --backup.
  - Avoid an error when --dry-run  was trying to stat a prior hard-link
	file that hasn't really been created.
  - Fixed a problem with --compress (-z) where the receiving side could
	return the error "inflate (token) returned -5".
  - Fixed a bug where --delete-during could delete in a directory before
	it noticed that the sending side sent an I/O error for that
	directory (both sides of the transfer must be at least 3.0.7).
  - Improved --skip-compress's error handling of bad character-sets and
	got rid of a lingering debug fprintf().
  - Fixed the daemon's conveyance of io_error value from the sender.
  - An rsync daemon use seteuid() (when available) if it used setuid().
  - Get the permissions right on a --fake-super transferred directory
	that needs more owner permissions to emulate root behavior.
  - An absolute-path filter rule (i.e. with a '/' modifier) no longer
	loses its modifier when sending the filter rules to the remote
	rsync.
  - Improved the "--delete does not work without -r or -d" message.
  - Improved rsync's handling of --timeout to avoid a weird timeout case
	where the sender could timeout even though it has recently written
	data to the socket (but hasn't read data recently, due to the
	writing).
  - Some misc manpage improvements.
  - Fixed the chmod-temp-dir testsuite on a system without /var/tmp.
  - Make sure that a timeout specified in the daemon's config is used as
	a maximum timeout value when the user also specifies a timeout.
  - Improved the error-exit reporting when rsync gets an error trying to
	cleanup after an error:  the initial error is reported.
  - The AIX sysacls routines will now return ENOSYS if ENOTSUP is
	missing.
  - Made our (only used if missing) getaddrinfo() routine use
	inet_pton() (which we also provide) instead of inet_aton().
  - The exit-related debug messages now mention the program's role so it
	is clear who output what message.

Thu Apr 16 12:16:41 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- update to 3.0.6pre1 (bugfix release)
- noteworthy changes:
  - Fixed a --read-batch hang when rsync is reading a batch file that was
    created from an incremental-recursion transfer
  - Fixed the daemon's socket code to handle the simultaneous arrival of
    multiple connections.
  - Fix --safe-links/--copy-unsafe-links to properly handle symlinks that
    have consecutive slashes in the value.
  - Fixed the parsing of an [IPv6_LITERAL_ADDR] when a USER@ is prefixed.
  - The sender now skips a (bogus) symlink that has a 0-length value, which
    avoids a transfer error in the receiver.
  - Fixed a case where the sender could die with a tag-0 error if there was
    an I/O during the sending of the file list.
  - Fixed the rrsync script to avoid a server-side problem when -e is at the
    start of the short options.
  - Fixed a problem where a vanished directory could turn into an exit code
    23 instead of the proper exit code 24.
  - Fixed the --iconv conversion of symlinks when doing a local copy.
    receiving side when a mount-point directory did not match a directory in
    the transfer.
  - Fixed the dropping of an ACL mask when no named ACL values were present.
  - Fixed an ACL/xattr corruption issue where the --backup option could cause
    rsync to associate the wrong ACL/xattr information with received files.
  - Fixed the use of --xattrs with --only-write-batch.
  - Fixed the use of --dry-run with --read-batch.
  - Fixed a run-time issue for systems that can't find iconv_open() by adding
    the --disable-iconv-open configure option.
  - Complain and die if the user tries to combine --remove-source-files (or
    the deprecated --remove-sent-files) with --read-batch.

  - fixed the use of -s (--protect-args) when used with a remote source or
    destination that had an empty path (e.g. "host:")
  - fixed the use of a dot-dir path (e.g. foo/./bar) inside a --files-from
    file when the root of the transfer isn't the current directory
  - fixed a bug with "-K --delete" removing symlinks to directories when
    incremental recursion is active
  - fixed a hard to trigger hang when using --remove-source-files
  - got rid of an annoying delay when accessing a daemon via a remote-shell
  - properly ignore (superfluous) source args on a --read-batch command

    confusing "non-empty" qualifier
  - fixed reverse lookups in the compatibility-library version of
    getnameinfo()
  - fixed a bug when using --sparse on a sparse file that has over 2GB of
    consecutive sparse data
  - avoid a hang when using at least 3 --verbose options on a transfer with a
    client sender (which includes local copying)
  - fixed a problem with --delete-delay reporting an error when it was ready
    to remove a directory that was now gone
  - got rid of a bunch of "warn_unused_result" compiler warnings
  - if an ftruncate() on a received file fails, it now causes a partial-
    transfer warning

    destination files have root-level attributes (e.g. selinux values) that
    a non-root copy can't affect.
  - The --iconv option now converts the content of a symlink too, instead
    of leaving it in the wrong character-set.

  - The handling of implied directories when using --relative has changed to
    send them as directories (e.g. no implied dir is ever sent as a symlink).
  - Requesting a remote file-listing without specifying -r (--recursive) now
    sends the -d (--dirs) option to the remote rsync rather than sending -r
    along with an extra exclude of /*/*.
  - In --dry-run mode, the last line of the verbose summary text is output
    with a "(DRY RUN)" suffix to help remind you that no updates were made.
    Similarly, --only-write-batch outputs "(BATCH ONLY)".
  - A writable rsync daemon with "use chroot" disabled now defaults to a
    symlink-munging behavior designed to make symlinks safer while also
    allowing absolute symlinks to be stored and retrieved.
  - Starting up an extra copy of an rsync daemon will not clobber the pidfile
    for the running daemon -- if the pidfile exists, the new daemon will exit
    with an error.

- re-applied patches from upstream kit:
  - acls.diff,xattrs.diff,slp.diff
- removed patches:
  - rsync-overlong.patch (upstream code cleaned up)
  - lutimes-hack.diff (should not be needed any more)
  - rsync-fix_fuzzy.patch (fixed upstream)
  - rsync-hlink_crash.patch (upstream cleaned up) 
  - munge-symlinks-2.6.9.diff (integrated upstream)
