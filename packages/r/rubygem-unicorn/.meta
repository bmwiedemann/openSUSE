  <title>Rack HTTP server for fast clients and Unix</title>
  <description>Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in UnixUnix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between \Unicorn and slow clients.
