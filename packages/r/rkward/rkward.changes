- aj asked for details why a user should update.
- Note: I'm only the packager, not even using this software
- myself. But if you ask: here is upstream's list of improvements:
  New features and improvements
        Preview device windows will display some status information (most importantly, warnings or errors)
        Most plot plugins gain options to control margins and tick label orientation
        Added option for installing packages from source (implicitly enabled on Unixoid platforms)
        Omit comments on missing function calls in dialog code windows (e.g., if prepare() is unused, there's no "## Prepare" in the output either)
        Output markup is now more XHTML compliant and easier to parse
        Also save cursor position, folding, etc. for scripts. Note: Implementation details may be subject to change.
        New function rk.list.labels() to retrieve column labels in a data.frame
        rk.get.label() will now return an empty string ("") instead of NULL, in case no label is assigned
        Do not offer to restore individual removed columns of a data.frame opened for editing
        combined all Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney-tests in one plugin (from previously two separate plugins)
        Added polyserial/polychoric correlations to correlation matrix plugin
        Added more compression options to the "Save objects as R code" plugin
        Added MacPorts support, see README.MacPorts and bundle build script in the macports folder
        Added dynamically generated table-of-contents menu to output document
        Allow some markup inside <text> elements in plugins, and auto-add breaks only for duplicate newlines.
        Reorganized t-test plugin, and add support for single sample t-tests
        Box plot plugin gains more options for adding means
        Improve keypress handling issues in the R Console, when the cursor or a selection is outside the editable range
        Only install translations which are at least 80% complete (not counting strings in plugins, which are not yet translatable)
        When asking for workspace file to open, use appropriate file filter
        When configured to ask for workspace to open on startup, don't prompt to save, first
        Simplified the "Sort Data" plugin, and added a help page
        Added GUI support for inspecting the call stack during debugging
        The backend executable is no longer linked against KDE libraries
        Objects, which are not acceptable in a varslot, will still be shown, there, with a warning 
    Bugfixes
        Fixed: Entering "0" as propabilities (quantiles) vector in distribution plugins would cause error message
        Fixed: Wrong handling of carriage returns ('\r') in the console window
        Fixed: Spinboxes had wrong initial values
        Fixed: Changed configuration settings would not be saved for script editor
        Fixed: One character missing in R commands on lines longer than 4096 characters
        Fixed: "Next"-button in wizards would remain enabled while settings are missing on a page
        Fixed: Dynamic pages in a wizard would cause a layout bug on the first page
        Fixed: Plot history and graphical menus broken in some cases with R 2.15.0
        Fixed: If the rkward package was loaded in a plain R session, q() and quit() still work
        Fixed: Would not show output of system() commands to stderr on the console (on Unix-like systems)
        Fixed: Function argument hints for the second half of the parameter list would not be quoted, correctly
        Fixed: Failure to open workspaces with non-latin1 filenames from the command line
        Fixed: Saving / restoring workplace layout would fail when saving to directories with unusual characters
        Fixed: potential crash when clicking "Select all updates" in the package installation dialog
        Fixed: potential crash in object name completion under certain conditions
        Fixed: On Windows, detached windows would sometimes be positioned with the menubar outside the upper screen edge
