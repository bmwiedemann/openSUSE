- moved COPYING to %license line 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 23 17:42:02 UTC 2019 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Add upstream patches to fix build in Factory:
  * Fix-compilation.patch
  * Another-missing-include-file.patch
  * Another-include-file-fix.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 17 10:39:46 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Disable installation of r.xml again, syntax-highlighting (and
  ktexteditor before it) already contains a newer version anyway

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 17 07:47:47 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- upstream release 0.7.0b
  * First release of RKWard to be based on KF5 (version 5 of the
  KDE libraries)

- Most important changes:

- New features and improvements 
  Implement "split view" feature, allowing to partion the main window, and to have several views of the same files / data side-by-side
  Double click on object in Workspace browser tries to open reference page, not object viewer, if the object is outside of .GlobalEnv
  Limit the number of debug log-files to keep (at most three, each, for frontend and backend)
  Remove Windows-only UI for setInternet2()-option (no longer available in R, with setInternet2(TRUE) the default since R 3.2.2)
  Remove startup wrapper script (moving the still-needed functionality into the main executable)
  Preview status messages can now be closed
  Show the message accompanying rk.show.files() or rk.edit.files() inside the main window, instead of a separate dialog
  File browser gains "Rename" context menu action
  File selection fields in plugin dialogs remember the last used directory (per session), and check for a valid selection

- Bug fixes
  Fix crash with R 3.5.x due to use to STRING_PTR
  Fixed: Creating trellis on-screen plots, while package lattice is not on the search path would produce errors in plot history mechanism
  Function argument hinting is less easily fooled by braces inside quotes
  Better handling of text drag-and-drop inside the R console window
  Fix NAs introduced by editing data containing characters that cannot be encoded in the system locale
  Fixed: Preview boxes followed by a <stretch/> element would not work under some circumstances
  Fixed: Setting an output CSS file via the GUI did not work
  Fixed: Bug report feature on Windows did nothing
  Avoid some potential encoding issues, that could cause graphical select.list to fail for certain strings, under some circumstances

- Fix versioned package dependency on R-base, it was spelt R-Base
  by mistake and therefore ineffective (boo#993268)
- Drop rkward-translations.tar.xz, the translations are included in
  the released tarball as usual

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  8 18:23:51 UTC 2017 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to latest snapshot of the "frameworks" git branch (WIP
  port to Qt5/KF5), the KDE4 version cannot be built or installed
  anymore on Tumbleweed and Leap 15 as Qt4WebKit is to be dropped
- Add rkward-translations.tar.xz containing the latest translations
  from SVN

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 12 08:45:11 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

        Most plot plugins gain options to control margins and tick label orientation
        Added option for installing packages from source (implicitly enabled on Unixoid platforms)

        Also save cursor position, folding, etc. for scripts. Note: Implementation details may be subject to change.

        Improve keypress handling issues in the R Console, when the cursor or a selection is outside the editable range
        Only install translations which are at least 80% complete (not counting strings in plugins, which are not yet translatable)
        When asking for workspace file to open, use appropriate file filter
        When configured to ask for workspace to open on startup, don't prompt to save, first
        Simplified the "Sort Data" plugin, and added a help page
        Added GUI support for inspecting the call stack during debugging
        The backend executable is no longer linked against KDE libraries

        Fixed: Failure to open workspaces with non-latin1 filenames from the command line
        Fixed: Saving / restoring workplace layout would fail when saving to directories with unusual characters
        Fixed: potential crash when clicking "Select all updates" in the package installation dialog
        Fixed: potential crash in object name completion under certain conditions
