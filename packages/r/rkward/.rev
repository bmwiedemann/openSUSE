    <comment>- aj asked for details why a user should update.
- Note: I'm only the packager, not even using this software
- myself. But if you ask: here is upstream's list of improvements:
  New features and improvements
        Preview device windows will display some status information (most importantly, warnings or errors)
        Most plot plugins gain options to control margins and tick label orientation
        Added option for installing packages from source (implicitly enabled on Unixoid platforms)
        Omit comments on missing function calls in dialog code windows (e.g., if prepare() is unused, there's no &quot;## Prepare&quot; in the output either)
        Output markup is now more XHTML compliant and easier to parse
        Also save cursor position, folding, etc. for scripts. Note: Implementation details may be subject to change.
        New function rk.list.labels() to retrieve column labels in a data.frame
        rk.get.label() will now return an empty string (&quot;&quot;) instead of NULL, in case no label is assigned
        Do not offer to restore individual removed columns of a data.frame opened for editing
        combined all Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney-tests in one plugin (from previously two separate plugins)
        Added polyserial/polychoric correlations to correlation matrix plugin
        Added more compression options to the &quot;Save objects as R code&quot; plugin
        Added MacPorts support, see README.MacPorts and bundle build script in the macports folder
        Added dynamically generated table-of-contents menu to output document
        Allow some markup inside &lt;text&gt; elements in plugins, and auto-add breaks only for duplicate newlines.
        Reorganized t-test plugin, and add support for single sample t-tests
        Box plot plugin gains more options for adding means
        Improve keypress handling issues in the R Console, when the cursor or a selection is outside the editable range
        Only install translations which are at least 80% complete (not counting strings in plugins, which are not yet translatable)
        When asking for workspace file to open, use appropriate file filter
        When configured to ask for workspace to open on startup, don't prompt to save, first
        Simplified the &quot;Sort Data&quot; plugin, and added a help page
        Added GUI support for inspecting the call stack during debugging
        The backend executable is no longer linked against KDE libraries
        Objects, which are not acceptable in a varslot, will still be shown, there, with a warning

    <comment>- upstream release 0.6.2

    <comment>- upstream release 0.6.3
- Most important changes:
- New features and improvements

  New string property modifier &quot;quoted&quot; to make it easier to quote dynamic strings inside plugins
  Reworked distribution calculator plugins
  Added power analysis plugin (already existed as separate plugin)
  Assume plugin .js files to be in utf-8 encoding; this allows using non-ascii characters in the generated code
  &lt;matrix&gt; element gains options min_rows and min_columns, and the details of fixed_width=&quot;true&quot; have been improved
  Add R function rk.set.plugin.status() to allow further customization of loaded plugins (hiding of individual menu entries)
  Pluginmap-management was reworked, partially, and moved to Settings-&gt;Manage R packages and plugins

  Change default in Workspace browser to showing only .GlobalEnv, initially
  Support automatically generating a printable header parameter from most plugin elements
  New Object based convience method for printing headers from plugins
  Implement polyPath()-drawing in RK() device
  Pre-compile the common js code included in every plugin (only when compiled with Qt &gt;= 4.7)
  Improve crash recovery dialog to not prompt again for the same files
  Plugins and in-application help pages can now be fully translated
- Fixes

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- upstream release 0.7.0b
  * First release of RKWard to be based on KF5 (version 5 of the
  KDE libraries)
- Most important changes:
- New features and improvements 
  Implement &quot;split view&quot; feature, allowing to partion the main window, and to have several views of the same files / data side-by-side
  Double click on object in Workspace browser tries to open reference page, not object viewer, if the object is outside of .GlobalEnv
  Limit the number of debug log-files to keep (at most three, each, for frontend and backend)
  Remove Windows-only UI for setInternet2()-option (no longer available in R, with setInternet2(TRUE) the default since R 3.2.2)
  Remove startup wrapper script (moving the still-needed functionality into the main executable)
  Preview status messages can now be closed
  Show the message accompanying rk.show.files() or rk.edit.files() inside the main window, instead of a separate dialog
  File browser gains &quot;Rename&quot; context menu action
  File selection fields in plugin dialogs remember the last used directory (per session), and check for a valid selection
- Bug fixes
  Fix crash with R 3.5.x due to use to STRING_PTR
  Fixed: Creating trellis on-screen plots, while package lattice is not on the search path would produce errors in plot history mechanism
  Function argument hinting is less easily fooled by braces inside quotes
  Better handling of text drag-and-drop inside the R console window
  Fix NAs introduced by editing data containing characters that cannot be encoded in the system locale
  Fixed: Preview boxes followed by a &amp;lt;stretch/&amp;gt; element would not work under some circumstances
  Fixed: Setting an output CSS file via the GUI did not work
  Fixed: Bug report feature on Windows did nothing
  Avoid some potential encoding issues, that could cause graphical select.list to fail for certain strings, under some circumstances
- Fix versioned package dependency on R-base, it was spelt R-Base
  by mistake and therefore ineffective (boo#993268)
- Drop rkward-translations.tar.xz, the translations are included in
  the released tarball as usual (forwarded request 597346 from wolfi323)</comment>

    <comment>- Disable installation of r.xml again, syntax-highlighting (and
  ktexteditor before it) already contains a newer version anyway

(The version in syntax-highlighting/ktexteditor is embedded, so there is no file xonflict, but it's pointless to install it) (forwarded request 598799 from wolfi323)</comment>
