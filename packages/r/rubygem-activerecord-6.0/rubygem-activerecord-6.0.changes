  ## Rails 6.0.4 (June 15, 2021) ##
  
  *   Only warn about negative enums if a positive form that would cause conflicts exists.
  
      Fixes #39065.
  
      *Alex Ghiculescu*
  
  *   Allow the inverse of a `has_one` association that was previously autosaved to be loaded.
  
      Fixes #34255.
  
      *Steven Weber*
  
  *   Reset statement cache for association if `table_name` is changed.
  
      Fixes #36453.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Type cast extra select for eager loading.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Prevent collection associations from being autosaved multiple times.
  
      Fixes #39173.
  
      *Eugene Kenny*
  
  *   Resolve issue with insert_all unique_by option when used with expression index.
  
      When the `:unique_by` option of `ActiveRecord::Persistence.insert_all` and
      `ActiveRecord::Persistence.upsert_all` was used with the name of an expression index, an error
      was raised. Adding a guard around the formatting behavior for the `:unique_by` corrects this.
  
      Usage:
  
      ```ruby
      create_table :books, id: :integer, force: true do |t|
        t.column :name, :string
        t.index "lower(name)", unique: true
      end
  
      Book.insert_all [{ name: "MyTest" }], unique_by: :index_books_on_lower_name
      ```
  
      Fixes #39516.
  
      *Austen Madden*
  
  *   Fix preloading for polymorphic association with custom scope.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Allow relations with different SQL comments in the `or` method.
  
      *Takumi Shotoku*
  
  *   Resolve conflict between counter cache and optimistic locking.
  
      Bump an Active Record instance's lock version after updating its counter
      cache. This avoids raising an unnecessary `ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError`
      upon subsequent transactions by maintaining parity with the corresponding
      database record's `lock_version` column.
  
      Fixes #16449.
  
      *Aaron Lipman*
  
  *   Fix through association with source/through scope which has joins.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Fix through association to respect source scope for includes/preload.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Fix eager load with Arel joins to maintain the original joins order.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Fix group by count with eager loading + order + limit/offset.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Fix left joins order when merging multiple left joins from different associations.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Fix index creation to preserve index comment in bulk change table on MySQL.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Change `remove_foreign_key` to not check `:validate` option if database
      doesn't support the feature.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Fix the result of aggregations to maintain duplicated "group by" fields.
  
      *Ryuta Kamizono*
  
  *   Do not return duplicated records when using preload.
  
      *Bogdan Gusiev*
  
  
  ## Rails 6.0.3.7 (May 05, 2021) ##
  
  *   No changes.
  
  
  ## Rails 6.0.3.6 (March 26, 2021) ##
  
  *   No changes.
  
  
  ## Rails 6.0.3.5 (February 10, 2021) ##
  
  *   Fix possible DoS vector in PostgreSQL money type
  
      Carefully crafted input can cause a DoS via the regular expressions used
      for validating the money format in the PostgreSQL adapter.  This patch
      fixes the regexp.
  
      Thanks to @dee-see from Hackerone for this patch!
  
      [CVE-2021-22880]

  ## Rails 6.0.3 (May 06, 2020) ##
  
  *   Recommend applications don't use the `database` kwarg in `connected_to`
  
      The database kwarg in `connected_to` was meant to be used for one-off scripts but is often used in requests. This is really dangerous because it re-establishes a connection every time. It's deprecated in 6.1 and will be removed in 6.2 without replacement. This change soft deprecates it in 6.0 by removing documentation.
  
      *Eileen M. Uchitelle*
  
  *   Fix support for PostgreSQL 11+ partitioned indexes.
  
      *Sebasti√°n Palma*
  
  *   Add support for beginless ranges, introduced in Ruby 2.7.
  
      *Josh Goodall*
  
  *   Fix insert_all with enum values
  
      Fixes #38716.
  
      *Joel Blum*
  
  *   Regexp-escape table name for MS SQL
  
      Add `Regexp.escape` to one method in ActiveRecord, so that table names with regular expression characters in them work as expected. Since MS SQL Server uses "[" and "]" to quote table and column names, and those characters are regular expression characters, methods like `pluck` and `select` fail in certain cases when used with the MS SQL Server adapter.
  
      *Larry Reid*
  
  *   Store advisory locks on their own named connection.
  
      Previously advisory locks were taken out against a connection when a migration started. This works fine in single database applications but doesn't work well when migrations need to open new connections which results in the lock getting dropped.
  
      In order to fix this we are storing the advisory lock on a new connection with the connection specification name `AdisoryLockBase`. The caveat is that we need to maintain at least 2 connections to a database while migrations are running in order to do this.
  
      *Eileen M. Uchitelle*, *John Crepezzi*
  
  *   Ensure `:reading` connections always raise if a write is attempted.
  
      Now Rails will raise an `ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyError` if any connection on the reading handler attempts to make a write. If your reading role needs to write you should name the role something other than `:reading`.
  
      *Eileen M. Uchitelle*
  
  *   Enforce fresh ETag header after a collection's contents change by adding
      ActiveRecord::Relation#cache_key_with_version. This method will be used by
      ActionController::ConditionalGet to ensure that when collection cache versioning
      is enabled, requests using ConditionalGet don't return the same ETag header
      after a collection is modified. Fixes #38078.
  
      *Aaron Lipman*
  
  *   A database URL can now contain a querystring value that contains an equal sign. This is needed to support passing PostgresSQL `options`.
  
       *Joshua Flanagan*
  
  *   Retain explicit selections on the base model after applying `includes` and `joins`.
  
      Resolves #34889.
  
      *Patrick Rebsch*

- updated to version 6.0.2

  *   Share the same connection pool for primary and replica databases in the
      transactional tests for the same database.

      *Edouard Chin*

  *   Fix the preloader when one record is fetched using `after_initialize`
      but not the entire collection.

      *Bradley Price*

  *   Fix collection callbacks not terminating when `:abort` is thrown.

      *Edouard Chin*, *Ryuta Kamizono*

  *   Correctly deprecate `where.not` working as NOR for relations.

      12a9664 deprecated where.not working as NOR, however
      doing a relation query like `where.not(relation: { ... })`
      wouldn't be properly deprecated and `where.not` would work as
      NAND instead.

      *Edouard Chin*

  *   Fix `db:migrate` task with multiple databases to restore the connection
      to the previous database.

      The migrate task iterates and establish a connection over each db
      resulting in the last one to be used by subsequent rake tasks.
      We should reestablish a connection to the connection that was
      established before the migrate tasks was run

      *Edouard Chin*

  *   Fix multi-threaded issue for `AcceptanceValidator`.

      *Ryuta Kamizono*

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 12 13:32:40 UTC 2019 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 6.0.1

  *    Common Table Expressions are allowed on read-only connections.

       *Chris Morris*

  *    New record instantiation respects `unscope`.

       *Ryuta Kamizono*

  *    Fixed a case where `find_in_batches` could halt too early.

       *Takayuki Nakata*

  *    Autosaved associations always perform validations when a custom validation
       context is used.

       *Tekin Suleyman*

  *    `sql.active_record` notifications now include the `:connection` in
       their payloads.

       *Eugene Kenny*

  *    A rollback encountered in an `after_commit` callback does not reset
       previously-committed record state.

       *Ryuta Kamizono*

  *    Fixed that join order was lost when eager-loading.

       *Ryuta Kamizono*

  *   `DESCRIBE` queries are allowed on read-only connections.

      *Dylan Thacker-Smith*

  *   Fixed that records that had been `inspect`ed could not be marshaled.

      *Eugene Kenny*

  *   The connection pool reaper thread is respawned in forked processes. This
      fixes that idle connections in forked processes wouldn't be reaped.

      *John Hawthorn*

  *   The memoized result of `ActiveRecord::Relation#take` is properly cleared
      when `ActiveRecord::Relation#reset` or `ActiveRecord::Relation#reload`
      is called.

      *Anmol Arora*

  *   Fixed the performance regression for `primary_keys` introduced MySQL 8.0.

      *Hiroyuki Ishii*

  *   `insert`, `insert_all`, `upsert`, and `upsert_all` now clear the query cache.

      *Eugene Kenny*

  *   Call `while_preventing_writes` directly from `connected_to`.

      In some cases application authors want to use the database switching middleware and make explicit calls with `connected_to`. It's possible for an app to turn off writes and not turn them back on by the time we call `connected_to(role: :writing)`.

      This change allows apps to fix this by assuming if a role is writing we want to allow writes, except in the case it's explicitly turned off.

      *Eileen M. Uchitelle*

  *   Improve detection of ActiveRecord::StatementTimeout with mysql2 adapter in the edge case when the query is terminated during filesort.

      *Kir Shatrov*

      Fixes #36761, #34328, #24281, #12953.

      *Ryuta Kamizono*

  *   Make the DATABASE_URL env variable only affect the primary connection. Add new env variables for multiple databases.

      *John Crepezzi*, *Eileen Uchitelle*

  *   Add a warning for enum elements with 'not_' prefix.

          class Foo
            enum status: [:sent, :not_sent]
          end

      *Edu Depetris*

  *   Make currency symbols optional for money column type in PostgreSQL
