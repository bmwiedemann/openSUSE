%description
redsea is a command-line RDS (Radio Data System) decoder.
It can be used with any RTL-SDR USB radio stick with the rtl_fm tool.
It can also decode the raw ASCII bitstream, the hex format used by RDS Spy,
and audio files containing multiplex signals (MPX).

RDS groups are printed to the terminal as line-delimited JSON objects
or, optionally, undecoded hex blocks (-x).
