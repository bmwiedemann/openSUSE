Sat Dec 28 19:04:53 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.1.0
  New features:
  * Decode 'broadcaster use' data in Slow labeling codes
    (variant 6).
  * Decode 'decoder identification' bits in Group 15B.
  * Workaround buggy encoders that show 1 extra character in
    RT+ fields.
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix a crash when the input file has a very high sample rate.
  * Fix a crash from uncaught iconv exceptions from corrupted
    utf8/ucs2 data.
  * Fix the CSVReader (used in the TMC decoder) ignoring the last
    line of any file.
  * Remove extra trailing space in transparent data channels
    hexdump.
  * Make raw libsndfile errors user-friendlier (instead of
    saying 'System error').
  Build system fixes:
  * Set default installation prefix to /usr/local.
  * Reduce compiler workload somewhat with forward declarations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 20 06:15:41 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.0.1
  Fixes:
  * Fix a crash (uncaught json exception) when attempting to
    serialize a string that's invalid UTF-8, e.g. if long PS gets
    corrupted.
  * Fix build when the installed version of nlohmann-json is too
    old.
  * Fix a couple of integer overflows, one affecting the
    subcarrier reset functionality (of #94) after 3.5 hours of
    runtime and another one causing a potential sync glitch after
    41 days of constant data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 27 19:53:59 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.0.0
  New features:
  * Add support for Enhanced RadioText (eRT).
  * Add support for Long PS in Group 15A.
  * Add runtime option --no-fec for disabling error correction.
  UX changes:
  * Breaking: Print a warning to stderr if the raw MPX input sample
    rate is not specified (breaks the previous silent assumption
    of 171 kHz)
  * Improve error reporting in general
  * Add --output hex (same as --output-hex) to mirror --input hex
  Fixes:
  * Fix detection of invalid date/time (timestamps >2000 years ago)
  * Noise resistance improvements.
    + Require three (instead of two) repeats of a new PI before
      accepting it for the JSON output
    + Require three (instead of two) synchronization pulses before
      locking.
  Maintainability:
  * Migrate build system from autotools to meson.
  * Switch from patched, packaged-in JsonCPP to external
    nlohmann-json.
  * Breaking: The order of some JSON elements has changed
    (insertion order instead of alphabetical)
  * Remove unmaintained build options for non-liquid, non-TMC
    builds.
  * Fix compiler warnings, issues identified via static analysis,
    and other code cleanup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 28 10:17:43 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.21
  * Add support for decoding LTCC and LTECC in TMC.
  * Add support for decoding RDS output from the TEF6686 tuner.
  * Add support for Alternative Frequencies Method B.
  * AF shown too less in JSON even for error-free signals.
  Breaking:
  * Change the name of the field alt_kilohertz to either
    alt_frequencies_a or alt_frequencies_b. The type of data sent
    by these methods differs. When --show-partial is set, the AF
    list will be in partial_alt_frequencies regardless of method.
  * Add option --input / -i to specify the stdin input format
    (bits, hex, mpx, tef). The old options will still work.
  * Fix automake script on Windows.
  * Fix compatibility with current liquid-dsp.
  * Fix output for UTF-8 encoded TMC location tables.
  * Fix clock_time displaying wrong date around midnightj
  * Fix misinterpretation of the Decoder Identification bits.
  * Fix decoding of RadioText for stations that don't use string
    terminators.
  * Show RadioText for stations that don't transmit end-of-message
    code.
  * Fix an off-by-one bug in the RadioText decoder that sometimes
    caused missing characters at the end of messages.
  * Fix runaway PLL after digital silence by clamping the phase
    error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  8 21:08:05 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.20

  * Add partial support for DAB cross-referencing.
  * Add support for raw broadcaster data in EON (variant 15).
  * Add support for transparent data channels (groups 5A, 5B).
  * Add support for fractional seconds in the rx timestamp
    format (%f).
  * Add support for TMC tuning info variant 8.
  * Add buffer delay compensation to rx timestamps. Timestamps
    aim to represent the time the PCM samples were read in.
  * Place some JSON fields in the beginning of the line for
    easier visual inspection (pi, group, ps...).
  * Print raw ODA data if the application is not supported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  6 12:00:24 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

Sun May 19 14:44:41 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.18
  * Add support for loading multiple TMC location databases by
    specifying --loctable more than once.
  * Sample rate can also be specified as -r 171k instead of -r 171000.
  * Fix a crash if the input audio file couldn't be loaded.
  * Print usage help instead of error message when stdin is empty.
  * Speed up loading of TMC location database.
  * Improve block sync detection by ignoring spurious sync pulses.
  * Fine-tune filter bandwidths for better sensitivity, based on
    test runs.
  * At EOF, process the last partially received group.
  * Remove character codetables G1 and G2 since they don't appear
    in the latest RDS standard any more.
  * Clean up code to ensure maintainability. Redsea now requires
    a compiler that supports C++14.

Fri Dec 14 00:11:07 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Trim bias, extend description.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  8 15:42:04 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.17.1
  Bugfix release.
  * Return exit value 0 if --version or --help was requested
  * Don't open stdout for libsndfile unless --feed-through was
    specified, otherwise json can't be written (this may break the
    feed-through on Linux temporarily)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  5 18:06:27 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.17.0
  * Change the type of the JSON field for TMC message urgency, from
    integer (0, 1, 2) to string ("none", "U", "X"), to better match
    its values in the specification
  * Speed improvements by avoiding a few extraneous buffer copies
    internally

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 19:58:46 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.16.0
  * Add support for multi-channel signals (--channels) - libsndfile
    is now a required dependency
  * Speed improvements: â—¦By using a lookup table instead of sinf/cosf
    to generate the mix-down sinusoid
  * By only using one mix-down operation instead of two

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 31 19:55:28 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.15.0
  * Add prog_item_number field containing the raw Program Item Number
  * Add partial_alt_kilohertz field containing an incomplete list of
    alternative frequencies when the --show-partial option is used
  * Add configure option --without-macports to disable directory checks
    when cross-compiling
  * Reduce write calls to output JSON stream using a streamstring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  9 11:18:06 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

    (RBDS) stations - activated by the -u switch. These are very
    noise-resistant as they're based on the PI code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 19 15:43:58 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de
