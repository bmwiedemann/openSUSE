- Update to version 1.0.1:
  * For the tests, force the usage of the Boost static libraries by
    setting Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to ON in CMake
    (gh#Tessil/robin-map#50).
- Changes from version 1.0:
  * Add support for efficient serialization.
  * Remove compilation warnings when -Wshadow flag is set.
  * Fix USE_STORED_HASH_ON_REHASH to return true when bucket_count
    is 0, STORE_HASH is true and is_power_of_two_policy::value is
    true.
  * Fix CMake warning by specifying a project language before
    including GNUInstallDirs.
  * Create a local tsl-robin-mapTargets.cmake
    (gh#Tessil/robin-map#45).

- Update to version 0.6.3:
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#26: Raise the maximum possible size of
    the hash table when using the prime_growth_policy on a  64-bit
    platform.
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#31: When min_load_factor() > 0, the
    clear() method will also reset the bucket_count of the hash
    table to 0.
  * Fix shrink when min_load_factor is set and a range erase with
    end() as last is called. The m_try_skrink_on_next_insert was
    not correctly set.
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#33: The value function of a const
    iterator can now be called and returns a mutable reference to
    the underlying value_type.
- Ran spec-cleaner.
