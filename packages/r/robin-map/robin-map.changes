Fri Jun 21 17:00:23 UTC 2024 - Friedrich Haubensak <hsk17@mail.de>

- Update to version 1.3.0: 
  * Add erase_fast(iterator pos) method which in contrast to
    erase(iterator pos) doesn't return an iterator, avoiding the
    cost of looking for the next element after erasure of the
    element at iterator pos.
- Changes of version 1.2.2:
  * Specify library version & versioning rules in headers
  * Mark error_message in numeric_cast as unused to avoid compiler
    warning in some cases
  * Remove support for CMake < 3.3

Sun May 28 20:20:08 UTC 2023 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.2.1: Fix missing project version increment in CMake.
- Changes of version 1.2.0:
  * Fix a rare but critical bug which only occurs when a very long collision
    chain (> 32 767) occurs due to a poor hash function
    (gh#Tessil/robin-map#52).
  * Replace deprecated std::aligned_storage since C++23 by alignas
   (gh#Tessil/robin-map#61).
  * Raise DIST_FROM_IDEAL_BUCKET_LIMIT to 8192.
  * Clear and shrink the moved hash table in the move operator to be coherent
    with the move constructor.
  * When using C++17, std::launder the reinterpreted pointer from
    std::aligned_storage to adapt to the change of object model introduced in
    P0137R1. Fix potential but very unlikely undefined behaviour.
  * When exceptions are disabled, only print the error message when
    defined(TSL_DEBUG) instead of !defined(NDEBUG).
  * Check that bucket_count doesn't exceed max_bucket_count() after the
    constructor initialization.

Sat Jun 25 14:44:09 UTC 2022 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.0.1:
  * For the tests, force the usage of the Boost static libraries by
    setting Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to ON in CMake
    (gh#Tessil/robin-map#50).
- Changes from version 1.0:
  * Add support for efficient serialization.
  * Remove compilation warnings when -Wshadow flag is set.
  * Fix USE_STORED_HASH_ON_REHASH to return true when bucket_count
    is 0, STORE_HASH is true and is_power_of_two_policy::value is
    true.
  * Fix CMake warning by specifying a project language before
    including GNUInstallDirs.
  * Create a local tsl-robin-mapTargets.cmake
    (gh#Tessil/robin-map#45).

Sat Feb 27 14:07:52 UTC 2021 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.6.3:
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#26: Raise the maximum possible size of
    the hash table when using the prime_growth_policy on a  64-bit
    platform.
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#31: When min_load_factor() > 0, the
    clear() method will also reset the bucket_count of the hash
    table to 0.
  * Fix shrink when min_load_factor is set and a range erase with
    end() as last is called. The m_try_skrink_on_next_insert was
    not correctly set.
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#33: The value function of a const
    iterator can now be called and returns a mutable reference to
    the underlying value_type.
- Ran spec-cleaner.

- Created robin-map package from Fedora source rpm to enable
  OpenImageIO > 2.0.0 to build to enable OpenShadingLanguage to be
  updated and build with LLVM10.
