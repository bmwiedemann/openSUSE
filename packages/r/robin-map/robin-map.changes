- Update to version 0.6.3:
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#26: Raise the maximum possible size of
    the hash table when using the prime_growth_policy on a  64-bit
    platform.
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#31: When min_load_factor() > 0, the
    clear() method will also reset the bucket_count of the hash
    table to 0.
  * Fix shrink when min_load_factor is set and a range erase with
    end() as last is called. The m_try_skrink_on_next_insert was
    not correctly set.
  * Fix gh#Tessil/robin-map#33: The value function of a const
    iterator can now be called and returns a mutable reference to
    the underlying value_type.
- Ran spec-cleaner.
