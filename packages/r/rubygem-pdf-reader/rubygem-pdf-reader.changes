- updated to version 2.4.0
 see installed CHANGELOG

  v2.4.0 (21st November 2019)
  - Optimise overlapping characters code introduced in 2.3.0. Text extraction of pages with
    thousands of characters is still slower than it was in 2.2.1, but it might tolerable
    for now. See https://github.com/yob/pdf-reader/pull/308 for details.
  - Implement very basic font substitution for Type1 and TrueType fonts that aren't embedded
  - Remove PDF::Hash class. It's been deprecated since 2010, and it's hard to believe anyone
    is still using it.
  - Several small bug fixes
  
  v2.3.0 (7th November 2019)
  - Text extraction now makes an effort to skip duplicate characters that overlap, a
    common approach used for a fake "bold" effect, This will make text extraction a bit
    slower - if that turns out to be an issue I'll look into further optimisations or
    provide a toggle to turn it off
  - Several small bug fixes
  
  v2.2.1 (27th July 2019)
  - Improve utf8 text extraction from CMaps that contain surrogate pair ligatures
