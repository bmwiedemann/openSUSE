  *   jtappa added the ability to skip fsync with a new option to Minitar.unpack
      and Minitar::Input#extract_entry. Provide `:fsync => false` as the last
      parameter to enable. Merged from a modified version of PR [#37][].

  ## 0.8 / 2019-01-05
  
  *   inkstak resolved an issue introduced in the fix for [#31][] by allowing
      spaces to be considered valid characters in strict octal handling. Octal
      conversion ignores leading spaces. Merged from a slightly modified version
      of PR [#35][].
  
  *   dearblue contributed PR [#32][] providing an explicit call to #bytesize for
      strings that include multibyte characters. The PR has been modified to be
      compatible with older versions of Ruby and extend tests.
  
  *   Akinori MUSHA (knu) contributed PR [#36][] that treats certain badly
      encoded regular files (with names ending in `/`) as if they were
      directories on decode.

- updated to version 0.7
 see installed History.md

  ## 0.7 / 2018-02-19
  
  *   Fixed issue [#28][] with a modified version of PR [#29][] covering the
      security policy and position for Minitar. Thanks so much to ooooooo\_q for
      the report and an initial patch. Additional information was added as
      [#30][].
  
  *   dearblue contributed PR [#33][] providing a fix for Minitar::Reader when
      the IO-like object does not have a `#pos` method.
  
  *   Kevin McDermott contributed PR [#34][] so that an InvalidTarStream is
      raised if the tar header is not valid, preventing incorrect streaming of
      files from a non-tarfile. This is a minor breaking change, so the version
      has been bumped accordingly.
  
  *   Kazuyoshi Kato contributed PR [#26][] providing support for the GNU tar
      long filename extension.
  
  *   Addressed a potential DOS with negative size fields in tar headers
      ([#31][]). This has been handled in two ways: the size field in a tar
      header is interpreted as a strict octal value and the Minitar reader will
      raise an InvalidTarStream if the size ends up being negative anyway.
