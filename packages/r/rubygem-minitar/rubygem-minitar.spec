%description
The minitar library is a pure-Ruby library that provides the ability to deal
with POSIX tar(1) archive files.
This is release 0.9, adding a minor feature to Minitar.unpack and
Minitar::Input#extract_entry that when <tt>:fsync => false</tt> is provided,
fsync will be skipped.
minitar (previously called Archive::Tar::Minitar) is based heavily on code
originally written by Mauricio Julio Fern√°ndez Pradier for the rpa-base
project.
