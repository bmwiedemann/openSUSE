updated to version 1.15.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  # 1.15.0
  
  * Add a readonly mode, for environments in which the updated cache wouldn't be persisted. See #428 and #423.
  
  # 1.14.0
  
  * Require Ruby 2.6.
  * Add a way to skip directories during load path scanning.
    If you have large non-ruby directories in the middle of your load path, it can severely slow down scanning.
    Typically this is a problem with `node_modules`. See #277.
  * Fix `Bootsnap.unload_cache!`, it simply wouldn't work at all becaue of a merge mistake. See #421.

updated to version 1.13.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  # 1.13.0
  
  * Stop decorating `Kernel.load`. This used to be very useful in development because the Rails "classic" autoloader
    was using `Kernel.load` in dev and `Kernel.require` in production. But Zeitwerk is now the default, and it doesn't
    use `Kernel.load` at all.
  
    People still using the classic autoloader might want to stick to `bootsnap 1.12`.
  
  * Add `Bootsnap.unload_cache!`. Applications can call it at the end of their boot sequence when they know
    no more code will be loaded to reclaim a bit of memory.
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 13 16:52:37 UTC 2022 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.12.0

  * `bootsnap precompile` CLI will now also precompile `Rakefile` and `.rake` files.

  * Stop decorating `Module#autoload` as it was only useful for supporting Ruby 2.2 and older.

  * Remove `uname` and other patform specific version from the cache keys. `RUBY_PLATFORM + RUBY_REVISION` should be
    enough to ensure bytecode compatibility. This should improve caching for alpine based setups. See #409.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 10 15:43:33 UTC 2022 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.11.1

  * Fix the `can't modify frozen Hash` error on load path cache mutation. See #411.

  # 1.11.0

  * Drop dependency on `fileutils`.

  * Better respect `Kernel#require` duck typing. While it almost never comes up in practice, `Kernel#require`
    follow a fairly intricate duck-typing protocol on its argument implemented as `rb_get_path(VALUE)` in MRI.
    So when applicable we bind `rb_get_path` and use it for improved compatibility. See #396 and #406.

  * Get rid of the `Kernel.require_relative` decorator by resolving `$LOAD_PATH` members to their real path.
    This way we handle symlinks in `$LOAD_PATH` much more efficiently. See #402 for the detailed explanation.

  * Drop support for Ruby 2.3 (to allow getting rid of the `Kernel.require_relative` decorator).

updated to version 1.10.3
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  # 1.10.3
  
  * Fix Regexp and Date type support in YAML compile cache. (#400)
  
  * Improve the YAML compile cache to support `UTF-8` symbols. (#398, #399)
    [The default `MessagePack` symbol serializer assumes all symbols are ASCII](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-ruby/pull/211),
    because of this, non-ASCII compatible symbol would be restored with `ASCII_8BIT` encoding (AKA `BINARY`).
    Bootsnap now properly cache them in `UTF-8`.
  
    Note that the above only apply for actual YAML symbols (e..g `--- :foo`).
    The issue is still present for string keys parsed with `YAML.load_file(..., symbolize_names: true)`, that is a bug
    in `msgpack` that will hopefully be solved soon, see: https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-ruby/pull/246
  
  * Entirely disable the YAML compile cache if `Encoding.default_internal` is set to an encoding not supported by `msgpack`. (#398)
    `Psych` coerce strings to `Encoding.default_internal`, but `MessagePack` doesn't. So in this scenario we can't provide
    YAML caching at all without returning the strings in the wrong encoding.
    This never came up in practice but might as well be safe.

updated to version 1.10.2
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  # 1.10.2
  
  * Reduce the `Kernel.require` extra stack frames some more. Now bootsnap should only add one extra frame per `require` call.
  
  * Better check `freeze` option support in JSON compile cache.
    Previously `JSON.load_file(..., freeze: true)` would be cached even when the msgpack version is missing support for it.
  
  # 1.10.1
  
  * Fix `Kernel#autoload`'s fallback path always being executed.
  
  * Consider `unlink` failing with `ENOENT` as a success.
  
  # 1.10.0
  
  * Delay requiring `FileUtils`. (#285)
    `FileUtils` can be installed as a gem, so it's best to wait for bundler to have setup the load path before requiring it.
  
  * Improve support of Psych 4. (#392)
    Since `1.8.0`, `YAML.load_file` was no longer cached when Psych 4 was used. This is because `load_file` loads
    in safe mode by default, so the Bootsnap cache could defeat that safety.
    Now when precompiling YAML files, Bootsnap first try to parse them in safe mode, and if it can't fallback to unsafe mode,
    and the cache contains a flag that records wether it was generated in safe mode or not.
    `YAML.unsafe_load_file` will use safe caches just fine, but `YAML.load_file` will fallback to uncached YAML parsing
    if the cache was generated using unsafe parsing.
  
  * Minimize the Kernel.require extra stack frames. (#393)
    This should reduce the noise generated by bootsnap on `LoadError`.
  
  # 1.9.4
  
  * Ignore absolute paths in the loaded feature index. (#385)
    This fixes a compatibility issue with Zeitwerk when Zeitwerk is loaded before bootsnap. It also should
    reduce the memory usage and improve load performance of Zeitwerk managed files.
  
  * Automatically invalidate the load path cache whenever the Ruby version change. (#387)
    This is to avoid issues in case the same installation path is re-used for subsequent ruby patch releases.

Tue Dec 21 22:47:57 UTC 2021 - Manuel Schnitzer <mschnitzer@suse.com>

- updated to version 1.9.3

  # 1.9.3

  * Only disable the compile cache for source files impacted by [Ruby 3.0.3 [Bug 18250]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18250).
    This should keep the performance loss to a minimum.

  # 1.9.2

  * Disable compile cache if [Ruby 3.0.3's ISeq cache bug](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18250) is detected.
    AKA `iseq.rb:13 to_binary: wrong argument type false (expected Symbol)`
  * Fix `Kernel.load` behavior: before `load 'a'` would load `a.rb` (and other tried extensions) and
    wouldn't load `a` unless `development_mode: true`, now only `a` would be loaded and files with
    extensions wouldn't be.

- updated to version 1.7.5

  # 1.7.5

  * Handle a regression of Ruby 2.7.3 causing Bootsnap to call the deprecated `untaint` method. (#360)
  * Gracefully handle read-only file system as well as other errors preventing to persist the load path cache. (#358)

  # 1.7.4

  * Stop raising errors when encoutering various file system errors. The cache is now best effort,
    if somehow it can't be saved, bootsnapp will gracefully fallback to the original operation (e.g. `Kernel.require`).
