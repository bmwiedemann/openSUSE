%description
Byebug is a Ruby debugger. It's implemented using the
TracePoint C API for execution control and the Debug Inspector C API for
call stack navigation.  The core component provides support that front-ends
can build on. It provides breakpoint handling and bindings for stack frames
among other things and it comes with an easy to use command line interface.
