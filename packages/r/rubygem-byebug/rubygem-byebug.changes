  * Unfriendly output in byebug's executable when script doesn't exist.
  * Unfriendly output in byebug's executable when script has invalid code.
  ## 9.0.2 - 2016-05-15

  * Unrelated error message when using `pry` command and Pry not installed.
  * Interrupting program execution from remote control interface (#239, thanks
    @izaera).
  ### Removed
  * Official Ruby 2.0.0 support. `var local` no longer works in Ruby 2.0. The
    rest of the commands should still work as before, but `byebug` is no longer
    tested against this version so they might start breaking in the
    future.
  ## 8.2.5 - 2016-04-27

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 23 05:28:32 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 8.2.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## Master (Unreleased)
  
  ## 8.2.0 - 2015-11-12
  ### Fixed
  * [#184](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/184) &
  [#188](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/188), both due
  to the way of running evaluations in a separate thread.
  
  ### Added
  * `debug` command to evaluate things in a separate thread, since this behavior
  was removed from default `eval` to fix the above issues.
  
  ## 8.1.0 - 2015-11-09
  ### Fixed
  * Command history should be specific per project.
  * Better error message in certain edge cases when printing the backtrace.
  * Bug in evaluator which would show information about having stopped at a
  breakpoint in some cases.
  
  ### Added
  * Ability to autolist source code after `frame` command.
  * Ability to stop at lines where methods return.
  
  ## 8.0.1 - 2015-11-07
  ### Fixed
  * Error stream wouldn't be properly reset when using standalone `byebug`.
  * Confusing error message for invalid breakpoint locations.
  
  ## 8.0.0 - 2015-11-05
  ### Fixed
  * [#183](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/183). Compilation
  in Ruby 2.0. Regression introduced in 7.0.0
  * "Return value is: nil" would be displayed when stopping right before the end
  of a class definition. We want to avoid showing anything instead.
  
  ## Changed
  * Plugins now need to implement an `at_end` method (separate from `at_return`)
  in their custom processors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 05:28:49 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 7.0.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 7.0.0 - 2015-11-04
  ### Fixed
  * [#177](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/177). Some issues
  with formatting results of evaluations.
  * [#144](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/144). Ruby process
  after using byebug does no longer get slow.
  * [#121](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/121). `byebug`
  commands inside code evaluated from debugger's prompt are now properly working.
  * Another evaluation bug in autocommands.
  * `finish 0` command would sometimes fail to stop right before exiting the
  current frame.
  * Runner's `--[no-]stop` option now works (thanks @windwiny).
  * Change variable name `bool`, avoid conflict clang's predefined macro
  
  ### Removed
  * `ps` command.
  
  ### Changed
  * [#166](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/166). Don't load
  the entire library on require, but only when a `byebug` call is issued. Thanks
  @bquorning.
  * The above fix to the `finish 0` command cause `byebug`'s entrypoint to
  require 3 steps out instead of 2. In general, plugins using
  `Byebug::Context.step_out` will need to be changed to consider "c return events"
  as well.
  
  ### Added
  * `autopry` setting that calls `pry` on every stop.
  * Return value information to debugger's output when `finish 0` is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 24 04:28:30 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 6.0.2
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 6.0.2 - 2015-08-20
  ### Fixed
  * The user should always be given back a prompt unless (s)he explicitly states
  the opposite. This provides a more general fix to the bug resolved in 6.0.1.
  
  ## 6.0.1 - 2015-08-19
  ### Fixed
  * Bug in evaluation where the user would lose the command prompt when entering
  an expression with a syntax error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 19 04:28:31 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 5.0.0
 see installed CHANGELOG.md

  ## 5.0.0
  ### Fixed
  * [#136](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/136). `frame`
  command not working with negative numbers (thanks @ark6).
  
  ### Added
  * IDE support and a new command/subcommand API for plugins.
  * Add a "savefile" setting holding the file where "save" command saves current
  debugger's state.
  
  ### Changed
  * `disable` no longer disable all breakpoints, it just shows command's help
  instead. To disable all breakpoints now you need to do `disable breakpoints`
  (or `dis b`). Similarly, you can't no longer use `dis 1 2 3` but need to do
  `dis b 1 2 3` to disable specific breakpoints. The same applies to the `enable`
  command.
  
  ### Removed
  * `help set <setting>` no longer works. `help set` includes that same output and
  it's not verbose enough so that this is a problem. Same with `help show
  <setting>`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  8 09:25:07 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 4.0.5

 system now.
 
 ## 4.0.4 - 2015-03-27

 * #127

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 20 05:33:10 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 4.0.3
 ### Fixed
 * Unused variable warning in context.c

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 18 15:39:52 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 4.0.2
 ### Fixed
 * Removed `rb-readline` as a dependency and show a help message whenever
 requiring readline fails instead (#118)
 
 ## 4.0.1 - 2014-03-13
 ### Fixed
 * .yml files needed for printers support were missing from the release... :S
 * Add `rb-readline` as a dependency (#118)
 
 ## 4.0.0 - 2014-03-13
 ### Added
 - `untracevar` command that stops tracing a global variable.
 - Window CI build through AppVeyor.
 - OSX CI build through Travis.
 - Style enforcement through RuboCop.
 - C style enforment using the `indent` command line utility.
 - Some remote debugging tests (thanks @eric-hu).
 - Printer's support (thanks @astashov).
 
 ### Changed
 - A lot of internal refactoring.
 - `tracevar` now requires the full global variable name (with "$").
 - `catch` command is not allowed in post_mortem mode anymore. It was not
 working anyways (#92).
 - `step` is now more user friendly when used in combination with `up` (see #85).
 - `var const` can now be called without an argument and will show constants in
 the current scope.
 - `break` with a class name now creates breakpoints regardless of class not
 being yet defined. If that's the case, it gives a warning but the class is
 created anyways.
 
 ### Fixed
 - Code reloading issues.
 - `set fullpath` was not showing fullpaths. Now it is.
 - `up`, `down` and `frame` commands now work in post_mortem mode (#93).
 - Fixes in rc file (.byebugrc): invalid commands are just ignored instead of
 aborting, global (home) rc file is now properly loaded before project's file.
 - Backtraces not working in `post_mortem` mode (#93).
 - 'cmd1 ; cmd2 ; ...; cmdN' syntax which allows running several commands
 sequentially.
 - Finish command not stopping at the correct line (#101).
 - `break` with namespaced class, like `break A::B#c` should now work (#106).
 - Command history is now persisted before exiting byebug.
 - Setting breakpoint in a method would stop not only at the beginning of the
 method but also at the beginning of every block inside the method.
 - Setting breakpoints on module methods (#122, @x-yuri).
 
 ### Removed
 - `autoreload` setting as it's not necessary anymore. Code should always be up
 to date.
 - `reload` command for the same reason.
 - Gem dependency on `debugger-linecache`.
 - `step+`, `step-`, `next+`, `next-`, `set/show linetrace_plus` and
 `set/show forcestep` commands. These were all mechanisms to deal with TracePoint
 API event dupplication, but this duplicated events have been completely removed
 from the API since
 [r48609](bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/48609), so
 they are no longer necessary.
 - `info file` subcommands: `info file breakpoints`, `info file mtime`, `info
 file sha1`, `info file all`. Now all information is listed under `info file`.
 - `testing` setting. It was just a hack to be able to test `byebug`. Nobody was
 supposed to actually use it!
 - `var class` command, just use Ruby (`self.class.class_variables`).
 - `p` command, just use `eval`, or just type your expression and `byebug` will
 autoevaluate it.
 - `exit` alias for `quit`.
