  <description>Byebug is a Ruby 2 debugger. It's implemented using the
Ruby 2 TracePoint C API for execution control and the Debug Inspector C API
for call stack navigation.  The core component provides support that
front-ends can build on. It provides breakpoint handling and bindings for
stack frames among other things and it comes with an easy to use command
line interface.</description>
