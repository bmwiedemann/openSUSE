  <title>A streaming player for listening to online radios</title>
  <description>Radio Tray is an online radio streaming player that runs on a Linux system
tray. Its goal is to have the minimum interface possible, making it very
straightforward to use.

Radio Tray is not a full featured music player, there are plenty of
excellent music players already. However, there was a need for a simple
application with minimal interface just to listen to online radios.
And that's the sole purpose of Radio Tray.</description>
