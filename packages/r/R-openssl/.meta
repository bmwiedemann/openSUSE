<package name="R-openssl" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Toolkit for Encryption, Signatures and Certificates Based on OpenSSL</title>
  <description>Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH pubkey parsers. Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384 and P-521. Cryptographic signatures can either be created and verified manually or via x509 certificates. AES can be used in cbc, ctr or gcm mode for symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public key) encryption or EC for Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions combine RSA and AES for encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key generators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure random number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually performing crypto calculations on large multibyte integers.
