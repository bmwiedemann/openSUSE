  <title>Data files for Rocks'n'Diamonds</title>
  <description>This is a nice little game with color graphics and sound for your Unix system
with color X11.  You need an 8-Bit color display or better.  It will not work
on black&amp;white systems, and maybe not on gray scale systems.

If you know the game Boulder Dash (Commodore C64) or Emerald Mine (Amiga),
you know what Rocks'n'Diamonds is about.

Data files (levels, tapes, graphics, music, sound) for Rocks'n'Diamonds.</description>
