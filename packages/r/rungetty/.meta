  <title>Minimal Getty for Virtual Consoles</title>
  <description>rungetty might be the getty you were looking for when you want to run any
program, not just login. If a different program than login is used it usually
is run as nobody:nogroup, or the user/group specified on the commandline.
rungetty can even be configured to autologin, under certain circumstances.
See the manual page for more information.

You have to change some lines in /etc/inittab for having any effect after
installing the package.  rungetty is based on mingetty and therefore not
suitable for serial use.
