  <title>CI::Reporter allows you to generate reams of XML for use with continuous integration systems</title>
  <description>CI::Reporter is an add-on to Test::Unit, RSpec and Cucumber that allows you to generate XML reports of your test, spec and/or feature runs. The resulting files can be read by a continuous integration system that understands Ant's JUnit report XML format, thus allowing your CI system to track test/spec successes and failures.</description>
