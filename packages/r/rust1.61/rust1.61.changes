Version 1.61.0 (2022-05-19)
==========================

Language
--------

- [`const fn` signatures can now include generic trait bounds][93827]
- [`const fn` signatures can now use `impl Trait` in argument and return position][93827]
- [Function pointers can now be created, cast, and passed around in a `const fn`][93827]
- [Recursive calls can now set the value of a function's opaque `impl Trait` return type][94081]

Compiler
--------

- [Linking modifier syntax in `#[link]` attributes and on the command line, as well as the `whole-archive` modifier specifically, are now supported][93901]
- [The `char` type is now described as UTF-32 in debuginfo][89887]
- The [`#[target_feature]`][target_feature] attribute [can now be used with aarch64 features][90621]
- X86 [`#[target_feature = "adx"]` is now stable][93745]

Libraries
---------

- [`ManuallyDrop<T>` is now documented to have the same layout as `T`][88375]
- [`#[ignore = "…"]` messages are printed when running tests][92714]
- [Consistently show absent stdio handles on Windows as NULL handles][93263]
- [Make `std::io::stdio::lock()` return `'static` handles.][93965] Previously, the creation of locked handles to stdin/stdout/stderr would borrow the handles being locked, which prevented writing `let out = std::io::stdout().lock();` because `out` would outlive the return value of `stdout()`. Such code now works, eliminating a common pitfall that affected many Rust users.
- [`Vec::from_raw_parts` is now less restrictive about its inputs][95016]
- [`std::thread::available_parallelism` now takes cgroup quotas into account.][92697] Since `available_parallelism` is often used to create a thread pool for parallel computation, which may be CPU-bound for performance, `available_parallelism` will return a value consistent with the ability to use that many threads continuously, if possible. For instance, in a container with 8 virtual CPUs but quotas only allowing for 50% usage, `available_parallelism` will return 4.

Stabilized APIs
---------------

- [`Pin::static_mut`]
- [`Pin::static_ref`]
- [`Vec::retain_mut`]
- [`VecDeque::retain_mut`]
- [`Write` for `Cursor<[u8; N]>`][cursor-write-array]
- [`std::os::unix::net::SocketAddr::from_pathname`]
- [`std::process::ExitCode`] and [`std::process::Termination`]. The stabilization of these two APIs now makes it possible for programs to return errors from `main` with custom exit codes.
- [`std::thread::JoinHandle::is_finished`]

These APIs are now usable in const contexts:

- [`<*const T>::offset` and `<*mut T>::offset`][ptr-offset]
- [`<*const T>::wrapping_offset` and `<*mut T>::wrapping_offset`][ptr-wrapping_offset]
- [`<*const T>::add` and `<*mut T>::add`][ptr-add]
- [`<*const T>::sub` and `<*mut T>::sub`][ptr-sub]
- [`<*const T>::wrapping_add` and `<*mut T>::wrapping_add`][ptr-wrapping_add]
- [`<*const T>::wrapping_sub` and `<*mut T>::wrapping_sub`][ptr-wrapping_sub]
- [`<[T]>::as_mut_ptr`][slice-as_mut_ptr]
- [`<[T]>::as_ptr_range`][slice-as_ptr_range]
- [`<[T]>::as_mut_ptr_range`][slice-as_mut_ptr_range]

Cargo
-----

No feature changes, but see compatibility notes.

Compatibility Notes
-------------------

- Previously native static libraries were linked as `whole-archive` in some cases, but now rustc tries not to use `whole-archive` unless explicitly requested. This [change][93901] may result in linking errors in some cases. To fix such errors, native libraries linked from the command line, build scripts, or [`#[link]` attributes][link-attr] need to
  - (more common) either be reordered to respect dependencies between them (if `a` depends on `b` then `a` should go first and `b` second)
  - (less common) or be updated to use the [`+whole-archive`] modifier.
- [Catching a second unwind from FFI code while cleaning up from a Rust panic now causes the process to abort][92911]
- [Proc macros no longer see `ident` matchers wrapped in groups][92472]
- [The number of `#` in `r#` raw string literals is now required to be less than 256][95251]
- [When checking that a dyn type satisfies a trait bound, supertrait bounds are now enforced][92285]
- [`cargo vendor` now only accepts one value for each `--sync` flag][cargo/10448]
- [`cfg` predicates in `all()` and `any()` are always evaluated to detect errors, instead of short-circuiting.][94295] The compatibility considerations here arise in nightly-only code that used the short-circuiting behavior of `all` to write something like `cfg(all(feature = "nightly", syntax-requiring-nightly))`, which will now fail to compile. Instead, use either `cfg_attr(feature = "nightly", ...)` or nested uses of `cfg`.
- [bootstrap: static-libstdcpp is now enabled by default, and can now be disabled when llvm-tools is enabled][94832]
