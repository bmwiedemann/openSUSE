- updated to version 2.1.0
   The major change of the 2.1 release is to switch over to `Hash#fetch`
   as the fundamental CRUD read method inplace of the previous `#read` core
   extension (an alias of `#[]`). This is a pretty fundamental change which
   required modification of a number of classes. So please do extra-diligence
   and file an issue if you experience any problems.
   
   In addition, the Hash#read core extension has been renamed to Hash#retrieve
   to avoid any possible confusion with IO objects. This release also fixes
   a couple of issues with 1.8 compatibility and makes a few other small 
   enhancements.
   
   Changes:
   
   * Rename Hash#read to Hash#retrieve.
   * Deprecate `Dictionary.alpha` in favor of `Dictionary.alphabetic`.
   * Add support for block argument in Dictionary#order_by_key and #order_by_value.
   * Fix OpenHash issues with Ruby 1.8.x compatibility.
   * OpenHash methods are opened up via `protected` instead of `private`.
   * Change OpenCascade to auto-create the subclass when inherited.
