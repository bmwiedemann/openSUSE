- Update to version 0.37.0:
  This release features a new linter rule, several new language
  server features, and many improvements and fixes. The two major
  OPA versions bumped since the last release additionally contains
  several performance improvements that were contributed as part of
  developing Regal!
  * New Rule: prefer-equals-comparison
    The prefer-equals-comparison linter rule recommends using the
    == operator for equality comparison over the unification
    operator =. The rule helps improve code clarity by using
    operators for their intended purposes: := for assignment, ==
    for equality comparison, and = for unification. The linter
    identifies when = is used for comparison by checking if both
    sides of the operator are "unassignable".

    Avoid

      input.request.method = "GET"

    Prefer

      input.request.method == "GET"

    There are some certainly valid use cases for the unification
    operator! But simple equality comparison is not one. For more
    information, see the documentation for the rule. As an amusing
    aside, this fixes one of the first issues created in the
    project!
  * Language server: Document highlighting to help show where
    function args are referenced
    Document highlighting is one of the more subtle features of the
    LSP specification, but a really helpful one when implemented
    well. The experimental first implementation that shipped with
    Regal v0.36.0 is no longer experimental, and has also been
    extended to highlight usage of function argument variables
    inside of a function head or body.
    (Please find the screencast in the release notes)
  * Language server: Selection ranges
    Selection ranges provide smart selection of code that can
    expand and shrink based on knowledge of the code rather than
    simple text properties, like hyphens or whitespace. This makes
    moving code around extremely fast, and without leaving the
    keyboard. Consult the language server docs for how to enable
    this in your editor
    (Please find the screencast in the release notes)
  * Improvements
    - The pointless-reassignment rule would previously only flag
      reassignment at the top level of a rule body. Now it flags
      pointless reassignments also in nested bodies, like
      comprehensions, every statements, and so on.
    - All completion providers are now implemented purely in Rego
    - Remove the go-semver dependency in favor of a custom, much
      faster implementation
    - Build: Reduce permissions granted in update-caps top-level
      workflow, by @timothyklee
    - Docs: Update language server page to demonstrate recently
      added features
    - Docs: Add kakoune LSP configuration example
  * Windows compatibility improvements
    In this release we have fixed various Windows bugs (Language
    Server Init, Goto Definition, Error Popups) in #1740, #1737,
    #1736, following #1633, and #1642 last release.
    These fixes have also made it possible to run our test suites
    on Windows runners to catch issues sooner in future. A huge
    thanks to @charlieegan3 for his tireless work on this!
  * Bugs fixed
    - Fix false positive in use-some-for-output-vars triggered by
      nested variables in rule ref heads, like rule[input[i]].allow
      if ....
    - Fix false positive in redundant-existence-check when a not
      check made an existence check necessary, reported by @gusega
    - Fix false positive in narrow-argument rule, which would
      incorrectly flag some arrays passed as arguments
    - Ensure that the language server InitOptions is never nil and
      don't cause issues with clients that don't provide those
  * Dependency Updates:

Sun Sep 14 12:09:36 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.36.1 (0.36.0 was not released):
  This is Regal v0.36! The first Regal release since becoming a
  part of the OPA project last month. This release mostly delivers
  a number of new language server features as well as wider
  improvements under the hood and to the developer experience.
  * A note about Regal's documentation
    Our documentation is now displayed as part of the main OPA
    website!
    https://www.openpolicyagent.org/projects/regal
    From this release, links generated from Regal in output to
    rules will point to this location. You might find links to the
    old location as we get things updated. Please feel free to open
    any issues for link problems you find just so we don't miss
    anything.
  * Get contextual documentation when calling built-in functions
    - Following PR #1654, the Regal language server will now offer
      signatureHelp to compatible clients. This shows the current
      argument type and description in the help text for built-in
      functions. This is in addition to the other general function
      documentation displayed here.
  * Quickly see related fields in when editing METADATA
    - PR #1657 implements support for the documentHighlight request
      from clients. This is currently only used to show signal
      other related METADATA keys when working with Rego metadata.
      In future, this same functionality could be used to highlight
      other related items currently in the viewport.
  * Jump directly from ignore directives to documentation
    - documentLink is another request from clients which allow the
      server to respond with link ranges. We have used this to make
      regal ignore directives clickable, helping users quickly
      learn what they mean when encountered in policies PR #1657.
  * Get live diagnostics from custom rules as you type
    - PR #1631 ensures that users of custom linter rules are also
      able to access these for live diagnostics in language server
      clients. Previously these were not evaluated in the server,
      only in the Regal CLI.
  * Notable Refactors & Development Changes
    - Rego Language Server Routing: PR #1675 makes some notable
      changes to how Rego is used within the Regal’s language
      server. The Language Server Protocol (LSP), which Regal
      implements to support LSP clients, is based on JSON message
      passing. This lends itself to Rego evaluation which is JSON
      in, JSON out. This PR updates the handling of different LSP
      messages sent from clients to route them in Rego, handling
      Rego backed rules first, and falling back to Golang
      implementations that still remain otherwise. This sets the
      direction for more Rego LSP functionality in the language
      server in future.
    - Development bundle loading from disk: PR #1646 gives those
      working on Regal in development the option of using the
      current source for the Regal bundle without rebuilding the
      binary. This improves the experience when working on Rego
      based language server functionality by reducing the time of a
      feedback loop. Set REGAL_BUNDLE_PATH to use this feature.

Tue Jul 01 10:15:29 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.35.1 (0.35.0 was not released):
  We're happy to release v0.35.1, the mid-summer release of Regal
  for the 🏖️ ! This release updates to OPA v1.6.0 bringing a number
  of performance improvements as well as other improvements and bug
  fixes.
  * Improved Schema Loading This PR replaces Regal's custom schema
    loader with one that matches OPA's behavior, enabling the same
    schemas to work across opa check, opa eval, and other OPA
    commands. PR #1605
  * Performance Improvements
    - Thanks to a PR in OPA, Regal's memory use is now much reduced
      due to a change conditionally supplying built-in contexts
      only when needed.
    - This PR optimizes Rego evaluation by directly mapping source
      data to ast.Value objects instead of going through
      intermediate map[string]any or JSON representations,
      eliminating ~2.9 million allocations in benchmarks. PR #1606
    - Regal contributors will be happy with
      open-policy-agent/opa#7442 which makes running Regal's tests
      around 2.5x as fast!
  * Code Actions Rewrite
    - Code actions are LSP features that provide automated fixes or
      refactoring suggestions (like "quick fix" options), and this
      PR implements them for Regal with server-side filtering to
      reduce data transfer and ensure consistent editor behavior.
      This is also now implemented in Rego! PR #1604
  * Docs
    - PR #1584 refactors a number of Regal's pages including
      breaking down the previously large README into separate
      files. Browse the new structure on the Regal Website.
    - The Code Lens documentation has been updated to better
      explain supported configurations. Thanks @Shinzu for the
      report here. #1596

Wed Jun 04 18:37:17 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.34.1:
  This patch release fixes a bug found since v0.34.0 as well as it
  bumps the OPA dependency to the v1.5.1 patch also released today.
  While Regal's own policies were not affected by the regression in
  walk, custom linter rules could very well be.
  * Highlights
    - OPA v1.5.0 -> v1.5.1
    - Go 1.23 -> 1.24
    - Fix false positive in sprintf-arguments-mismatch when the
      %-*s pattern was used for padding.
  * Changelog
    - OPA v1.5.1 and some perf tweaks (#1580)
    - docs: Update typo in link (#1581)
    - deps: Revert 47c70f0 tablewriter changes (#1579)
    - docs: Update to allow better regal docs generation (#1578)
    - [create-pull-request] automated change (#1577)
    - fix: consider padding pattern in sprintf-arguments-mismatch
      (#1575)
    - build(deps): bump ossf/scorecard-action in the dependencies
      group (#1576)
    - Fix deprecated notices in .goreleaser.yaml (#1570)
    - Go 1.23 -> 1.24 (#1573)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 31 07:05:06 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.34.0:
  After a month of development, we're happy to announce Regal
  v0.34. This version of the OPA community's favorite linter and
  language server brings you new 3 linter rules, performance
  improvements and much more.
  With the v0.34.0 release, Regal now ships with more than 100
  linter rules!
  Which is pretty close to one new week per rule since the project
  started.
  * New rules
    - unresolved-reference
      This one is particularly exciting! The new
      unresolved-reference rule reports any references (like
      data.users.permissions) that cannot be resolved (i.e. found)
      anywhere in the project. Some projects will have valid
      references that can't be resolved at the time Regal lints the
      project, and the rule provides configuration options to mark
      certain references, or entire paths (like data.users.*) as
      resolved. See the docs for the rule for more details.
    - pointless-import
      Category: imports
      The new pointless-import rule will flags imports of the same
      package, and other import forms where the import has no real
      effect.
    - single-item-in
      Category: idiomatic
      The single-item-in rule reports cases of in being used on a
      single item collection, and suggests using an equality check
      instead.
  * Performance
    - Use OPA v1.5.0, which brings performance improvements to walk
      reducing linting time by about 10%.
    - Faster linting by avoiding walk in a few locations where
      possible.
    - Improve performance of aggregate rules.
    - Several performance optimizations to Regal's linter rules.
  * API
    - The linter API now has a new Prepare method that can be used
      to prepare the linter before reusing it across several runs.
  * Various
    - Some rules that would previously only scan the topmost level
      of a rule body will now recursively scan the whole rule.
    - The input completions provider has been rewritten in Rego
      (previously Go).
    - The automatic version check has been rewritten in Rego
      (previously Go).
  * Bugs
    - Fix false positive in custom one-liner-rule.
  * Docs
    - Updated roadmap. Go check it out!
    - Move rules table from README and into a more interactive form
      on the Styra docs. Take a look!
    - Add link to Renovating Rego blog.
    - README: add link to KubeCon London talk, which prominently
      featured Regal.
    - Update links to adapt to OPA's new documentation.
    - Update outdated information in README.

- Update to version 0.33.1:
  This release is the same tag as v0.33.1, please see that release
  for the release notes.
  Another v0.33.1 was released to trigger the rebuilding of some
  assets that were deleted in a draft release.
  * New Rule: in-wildcard-key
    Using a wildcard variable (_) for the key in the key-value form
    of iteration (some _, value in collection) is never needed, and
    can be replaced by the simple some value in … form . This rule
    flags cases where the key iteration is redundant. (Read more)
  * New Rule: confusing-alias
    While import aliases can improve readability, aliasing an
    import reference that is also imported without an alias is
    confusing, as both names point to the same resource. This rule
    catches such cases. (Read more)
  * New Rule: mixed-iteration
    Rego supports different styles of collection iteration. While
    "reference style" iteration (collection[_]) can be concise for
    deeply nested structures, mixing it with the some .. in style
    within a single iteration expression makes for code that’s more
    difficult to follow. This rule encourages consistency within a
    single iteration statement. (Read more)
  * New Rule: narrow-argument
    This new rule analyzes function arguments to suggest narrowing
    them down to the minimal value the function depends on. This
    can improve clarity and reusability. The rule considers
    incrementally defined functions across all their definitions.
    This is a powerful but opinionated rule and is thus in the
    custom category and is not on by default. See the documentation
    for how to enable it if you’re curious to try it out! (Read
    more)
  * Performance Improvements
    Several improvements have been made to reduce memory
    allocations and improve overall linting performance. Numbers
    below refer to Regal’s benchmark for linting its own policies.
    - Optimized config loading and parsing, saving around 2.7
      million allocations (#1491).
    - Reduced allocations by approximately 2 million (#1494).
    - Improved the performance of the use-strings-count rule,
      saving almost 1 million allocations (#1465).
    - Optimized reference comparisons and small iteration patterns,
      saving around 300k allocations (#1472).
    - Included performance enhancements alongside an update to the
      external-reference rule to make it more configurable (#1496).
  * OPA v1.3.0
    Regal has been upgraded to use OPA v1.3.0. This brings several
    upstream improvements, including support for the new one-liner
    grouping in formatting (see OPA#6760). (#1459)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug in the handling of Rego input from stdin. Thanks
      @tokyowizard for the report! (#1474)
    - Fixed a panic that could occur in FindConfigRoots when
      supplied with unexpected arguments. (#1487)
  * Other Rule Updates
    - The external-reference rule can now be configured with a
      maximum number of allowed external references, instead of
      solely flagging all external uses within a function. If you
      previously had this rule disabled, you might want to try
      enabling it now, and possibly tweak its configuration to your
      liking. (#1496)
    - The rule-length rule now has a separate setting
      (max-test-rule-length) with a higher default value (60 vs 30)
      for test rules, acknowledging that tests often include
      substantial data. (#1476)
    - Updated documentation for the rule-named-if rule based on
      community feedback received via the page feedback form
      (please let us know if you see issues! & thanks for the
      report!) (#1463)
