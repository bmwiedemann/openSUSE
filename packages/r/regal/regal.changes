- Update to version 0.34.1:
  This patch release fixes a bug found since v0.34.0 as well as it
  bumps the OPA dependency to the v1.5.1 patch also released today.
  While Regal's own policies were not affected by the regression in
  walk, custom linter rules could very well be.
  * Highlights
    - OPA v1.5.0 -> v1.5.1
    - Go 1.23 -> 1.24
    - Fix false positive in sprintf-arguments-mismatch when the
      %-*s pattern was used for padding.
  * Changelog
    - OPA v1.5.1 and some perf tweaks (#1580)
    - docs: Update typo in link (#1581)
    - deps: Revert 47c70f0 tablewriter changes (#1579)
    - docs: Update to allow better regal docs generation (#1578)
    - [create-pull-request] automated change (#1577)
    - fix: consider padding pattern in sprintf-arguments-mismatch
      (#1575)
    - build(deps): bump ossf/scorecard-action in the dependencies
      group (#1576)
    - Fix deprecated notices in .goreleaser.yaml (#1570)

- Update to version 0.34.0:
  After a month of development, we're happy to announce Regal
  v0.34. This version of the OPA community's favorite linter and
  language server brings you new 3 linter rules, performance
  improvements and much more.
  With the v0.34.0 release, Regal now ships with more than 100
  linter rules!
  Which is pretty close to one new week per rule since the project
  started.
  * New rules
    - unresolved-reference
      This one is particularly exciting! The new
      unresolved-reference rule reports any references (like
      data.users.permissions) that cannot be resolved (i.e. found)
      anywhere in the project. Some projects will have valid
      references that can't be resolved at the time Regal lints the
      project, and the rule provides configuration options to mark
      certain references, or entire paths (like data.users.*) as
      resolved. See the docs for the rule for more details.
    - pointless-import
      Category: imports
      The new pointless-import rule will flags imports of the same
      package, and other import forms where the import has no real
      effect.
    - single-item-in
      Category: idiomatic
      The single-item-in rule reports cases of in being used on a
      single item collection, and suggests using an equality check
      instead.
  * Performance
    - Use OPA v1.5.0, which brings performance improvements to walk
      reducing linting time by about 10%.
    - Faster linting by avoiding walk in a few locations where
      possible.
    - Improve performance of aggregate rules.
    - Several performance optimizations to Regal's linter rules.
  * API
    - The linter API now has a new Prepare method that can be used
      to prepare the linter before reusing it across several runs.
  * Various
    - Some rules that would previously only scan the topmost level
      of a rule body will now recursively scan the whole rule.
    - The input completions provider has been rewritten in Rego
      (previously Go).
    - The automatic version check has been rewritten in Rego
      (previously Go).
  * Bugs
    - Fix false positive in custom one-liner-rule.
  * Docs
    - Updated roadmap. Go check it out!
    - Move rules table from README and into a more interactive form
      on the Styra docs. Take a look!
    - Add link to Renovating Rego blog.
    - README: add link to KubeCon London talk, which prominently
      featured Regal.
    - Update links to adapt to OPA's new documentation.
    - Update outdated information in README.

      (#1551)

- Update to version 0.33.1:
  This release is the same tag as v0.33.1, please see that release
  for the release notes.
  Another v0.33.1 was released to trigger the rebuilding of some
  assets that were deleted in a draft release.
  * New Rule: in-wildcard-key
    Using a wildcard variable (_) for the key in the key-value form
    of iteration (some _, value in collection) is never needed, and
    can be replaced by the simple some value in … form . This rule
    flags cases where the key iteration is redundant. (Read more)
  * New Rule: confusing-alias
    While import aliases can improve readability, aliasing an
    import reference that is also imported without an alias is
    confusing, as both names point to the same resource. This rule
    catches such cases. (Read more)
  * New Rule: mixed-iteration
    Rego supports different styles of collection iteration. While
    "reference style" iteration (collection[_]) can be concise for
    deeply nested structures, mixing it with the some .. in style
    within a single iteration expression makes for code that’s more
    difficult to follow. This rule encourages consistency within a
    single iteration statement. (Read more)
  * New Rule: narrow-argument
    This new rule analyzes function arguments to suggest narrowing
    them down to the minimal value the function depends on. This
    can improve clarity and reusability. The rule considers
    incrementally defined functions across all their definitions.
    This is a powerful but opinionated rule and is thus in the
    custom category and is not on by default. See the documentation
    for how to enable it if you’re curious to try it out! (Read
    more)
  * Performance Improvements
    Several improvements have been made to reduce memory
    allocations and improve overall linting performance. Numbers
    below refer to Regal’s benchmark for linting its own policies.
    - Optimized config loading and parsing, saving around 2.7
      million allocations (#1491).
    - Reduced allocations by approximately 2 million (#1494).
    - Improved the performance of the use-strings-count rule,
      saving almost 1 million allocations (#1465).
    - Optimized reference comparisons and small iteration patterns,
      saving around 300k allocations (#1472).
    - Included performance enhancements alongside an update to the
      external-reference rule to make it more configurable (#1496).
  * OPA v1.3.0
    Regal has been upgraded to use OPA v1.3.0. This brings several
    upstream improvements, including support for the new one-liner
    grouping in formatting (see OPA#6760). (#1459)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug in the handling of Rego input from stdin. Thanks
      @tokyowizard for the report! (#1474)
    - Fixed a panic that could occur in FindConfigRoots when
      supplied with unexpected arguments. (#1487)
  * Other Rule Updates
    - The external-reference rule can now be configured with a
      maximum number of allowed external references, instead of
      solely flagging all external uses within a function. If you
      previously had this rule disabled, you might want to try
      enabling it now, and possibly tweak its configuration to your
      liking. (#1496)
    - The rule-length rule now has a separate setting
      (max-test-rule-length) with a higher default value (60 vs 30)
      for test rules, acknowledging that tests often include
      substantial data. (#1476)
    - Updated documentation for the rule-named-if rule based on
      community feedback received via the page feedback form
      (please let us know if you see issues! & thanks for the
      report!) (#1463)
