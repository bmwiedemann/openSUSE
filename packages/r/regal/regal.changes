- Update to version 0.33.1:
  This release is the same tag as v0.33.1, please see that release
  for the release notes.
  Another v0.33.1 was released to trigger the rebuilding of some
  assets that were deleted in a draft release.
  * New Rule: in-wildcard-key
    Using a wildcard variable (_) for the key in the key-value form
    of iteration (some _, value in collection) is never needed, and
    can be replaced by the simple some value in … form . This rule
    flags cases where the key iteration is redundant. (Read more)
  * New Rule: confusing-alias
    While import aliases can improve readability, aliasing an
    import reference that is also imported without an alias is
    confusing, as both names point to the same resource. This rule
    catches such cases. (Read more)
  * New Rule: mixed-iteration
    Rego supports different styles of collection iteration. While
    "reference style" iteration (collection[_]) can be concise for
    deeply nested structures, mixing it with the some .. in style
    within a single iteration expression makes for code that’s more
    difficult to follow. This rule encourages consistency within a
    single iteration statement. (Read more)
  * New Rule: narrow-argument
    This new rule analyzes function arguments to suggest narrowing
    them down to the minimal value the function depends on. This
    can improve clarity and reusability. The rule considers
    incrementally defined functions across all their definitions.
    This is a powerful but opinionated rule and is thus in the
    custom category and is not on by default. See the documentation
    for how to enable it if you’re curious to try it out! (Read
    more)
  * Performance Improvements
    Several improvements have been made to reduce memory
    allocations and improve overall linting performance. Numbers
    below refer to Regal’s benchmark for linting its own policies.
    - Optimized config loading and parsing, saving around 2.7
      million allocations (#1491).
    - Reduced allocations by approximately 2 million (#1494).
    - Improved the performance of the use-strings-count rule,
      saving almost 1 million allocations (#1465).
    - Optimized reference comparisons and small iteration patterns,
      saving around 300k allocations (#1472).
    - Included performance enhancements alongside an update to the
      external-reference rule to make it more configurable (#1496).
  * OPA v1.3.0
    Regal has been upgraded to use OPA v1.3.0. This brings several
    upstream improvements, including support for the new one-liner
    grouping in formatting (see OPA#6760). (#1459)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug in the handling of Rego input from stdin. Thanks
      @tokyowizard for the report! (#1474)
    - Fixed a panic that could occur in FindConfigRoots when
      supplied with unexpected arguments. (#1487)
  * Other Rule Updates
    - The external-reference rule can now be configured with a
      maximum number of allowed external references, instead of
      solely flagging all external uses within a function. If you
      previously had this rule disabled, you might want to try
      enabling it now, and possibly tweak its configuration to your
      liking. (#1496)
    - The rule-length rule now has a separate setting
      (max-test-rule-length) with a higher default value (60 vs 30)
      for test rules, acknowledging that tests often include
      substantial data. (#1476)
    - Updated documentation for the rule-named-if rule based on
      community feedback received via the page feedback form
      (please let us know if you see issues! & thanks for the
      report!) (#1463)
