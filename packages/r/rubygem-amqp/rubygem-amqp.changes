  ```
  
  Contributed by Michael Lutsiuk.

- updated to version 1.3.0
  ### Exchange-to-Exchange Bindings Support
  
  amqp gem now supports [Exchange-to-Exchange Bindings](http://www.rabbitmq.com/e2e.html), a RabbitMQ
  extension.
  
  `AMQP::Exchange#bind` and `AMQP::Exchange#unbind` work very much like `AMQP::Queue#bind` and
  `AMQP::Queue#unbind`, with the argument exchange being the source one.
  
  ### Internal Exchange Declaration
  
  amqp gem now supports declaration of internal exchanges
  (used via exchange-to-exchange bindings, cannot be published to
  by clients).
  
  To declare an exchange as internal, add `:internal => true` to
  declaration options.

  ### Initial Connection Failures Retries
  
  Set connection status to closed on connection failure, which
  means connection retries succeed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 20 09:29:47 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to version 1.2.0
  amqp gem now supports [Authentication Failure
  Notification](http://www.rabbitmq.com/auth-notification.html). Public
  API for authentication failure handling hasn't changed.
  
  This extension is available in RabbitMQ 3.2+.
  
  ## basic.qos Recovery Fix
  
  `basic.qos` setting will now be recovered first thing after
  channel recovery, to the most recent value passed via `:prefetch` channel
  constructor option or `AMQP::Channel#prefetch`.

  ### Automatic Recovery Fix

  Contributed by Devin Christensen.
  
  
  ## Changes Between 1.1.5 and 1.1.6
  
  ### 65535 Channels Per Connection
  
  amqp gem now allows for 65535 channels per connection and
  not Ruby process.
  
  Contributed by Neo (http://neo.com) developers.
  
  
  ## Changes Between 1.1.4 and 1.1.5
  
  ### channel.close is Delayed Until After Channel is Open
  
  This eliminates a race condition in some codebases that use
  very short lived channels.
  
  
  ## Changes Between 1.1.3 and 1.1.4
  
  ### ConnectionClosedError is Back
  
  `ConnectionClosedError` is now defined again.

  a bug fix for messages exactly 128 Kb in size.
  
  
  ### AMQ::Client is Removed
  
  `amq-client` has been incorporated into amqp gem. `AMQ::Client` and related
  modules are no longer available.
  
  ### AMQP::Channel#confirm_select is Now Delayed
  
  `AMQP::Channel#confirm_select` is now delayed until after the channel
  is opened, making it possible to use it with the pseudo-synchronous
  code style.
  
  ### RabbitMQ Extensions are Now in Core
  
  amqp gem has been targeting RabbitMQ exclusively for a while now.
  
  RabbitMQ extensions are now loaded by default and will be even more
  tightly integrated in the future.
  
  ### AMQP::Channel.default is Removed
  
  `AMQP::Channel.default` and method_missing-based operations on the default
  channel has been removed. They've been deprecated since 0.6.
