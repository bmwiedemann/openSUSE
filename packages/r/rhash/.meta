  <title>Recursive Hasher</title>
  <description>RHash (Recurcive Hasher) is a console utility for computing and
verifying magnet links and hash sums of files.
It supports CRC32, MD4, MD5, SHA1/SHA2, Tiger, DC++ TTH, BitTorrent
BTIH, AICH, eDonkey hash, GOST R 34.11-94, RIPEMD-160, HAS-160, EDON-R,
Whirlpool and Snefru hash algorithms. Hash sums are used to ensure and
verify integrity of large volumes of data for a long-term storing or
transferring.

Program features:
 * Calculation of Magnet links and EDonkey 2000 links.
 * Output in a predefined (SFV, BSD-like) or a user-defined format.
 * Updating crc files (adding hash sums of files missing in the crc
   file).
 * Ability to process directories recursively.
