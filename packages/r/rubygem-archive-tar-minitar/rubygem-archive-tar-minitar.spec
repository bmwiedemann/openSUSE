%description
Archive::Tar::Minitar is a pure-Ruby library and command-line utility that
provides the ability to deal with POSIX tar(1) archive files. The
implementation is based heavily on Mauricio Ferna'ndez's implementation in
rpa-base, but has been reorganised to promote reuse in other projects.
