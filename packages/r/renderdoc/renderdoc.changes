Mon Dec 19 09:11:29 UTC 2022 - Patrik Jakobsson <patrik.jakobsson@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.24
  * This is a hotfix release, containing a fix for a common D3D12
    crash that could happen when analysing a capture using bindless
    resource access. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  5 11:46:40 UTC 2022 - Patrik Jakobsson <patrik.jakobsson@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.23
- UI: When trying to connect to a remote host using an incompatible
  version, display the version it is running. This is only
  supported as of v1.23 and newer, older versions will all report
  as 'older than v1.23'.
- UI: The buffer formatted allows stdint types like uint8_t or
  int32_t.
- All: Add an in-application API function to set a title for an
  ongoing capture.
- Linux: Use $HOME as a backup if getpwuid fails.
- Vulkan/D3D12: Add a number of optimisations to D3D12 and Vulkan
  both during capture and on replay, to improve performance. This
  would affect programs using bindless and large number of
  resources most.
- Vulkan/D3D12: When doing feedback on bindless resources, if a
  pixel shader is never invoked due to being offscreen/clipped,
  treat that as valid and display no resources as used instead of
  falling back to showing all resources.
- Vulkan: Give a default name to un-named children in constant
  buffer structs.
- Vulkan: Add support for extensions:
  * VK_EXT_mutable_descriptor_type
  * VK_AMD_memory_overallocation_behavior
  * VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory
- D3D12: Relax the requirement for D3D12Core.dll to be signed by
  microsoft on trusted captures. This works around an issue where
  UE5.1 re-signed D3D12Core.dll as coming from epic, causing it to
  be rejected. The signature check will still be applied on files
  marked as untrusted e.g. downloaded from the internet.
- OpenGL: Allow use of OVR extensions on desktop GL.
- OpenGL: In the case that two different incompatibly-typed shader
  variables are both bound to the same texture slot, display this
  as an error in the pipeline state view.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 10 06:59:27 UTC 2022 - Patrik Jakobsson <patrik.jakobsson@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.22
  * UI: Improved the highlighting of changed variables when
    stepping/running in the shader debugger.
  * OpenGL: When capture is unsupported on a running program,
    display the reason why in the connection window as well as in
    the overlay text.
  * OpenGL: Show bicubic filtering functions in pipeline state
    viewer.
  * OpenGL: Replay multisampled backbuffers on OpenGL ES.
  * D3D: Display magic quality values better in texture viewer
    status bar.
  * D3D12: Improve performance for adding patterns into discarded
    resources.
  * Vulkan: On fastest replay optimisation level don't override
    renderpass load ops.
  * Vulkan: Optimise contiguous bindings of sparse pages in buffers
    before passing to the driver.
  * Vulkan: Add support for extensions:
    - VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout
    - VK_EXT_primitive_topology_list_restart
    - VK_EXT_primitives_generated_query
    - VK_EXT_depth_clip_control
    - VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 07:15:54 UTC 2022 - Patrik Jakobsson <patrik.jakobsson@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.21
  * UI: Highlight the current event in the texture viewer context
    menu that shows resource usage.
  * UI: Improve handling of source-level shader debugging
    breakpoints.
  * All: Show status in mesh viewer when geometry data is not
    available, e.g. when using multiview and geometry/tessellation
    on vulkan.
  * All: Tweaked the in-program overlay to be more readable and
    better organised, especially around multiple windows.
  * All: Handle applications that don't create any
    graphics-compatible queues on Vulkan or D3D12 to still be able to
    capture and replay correctly.
  * Vulkan: Improve the clarity of error messages for incompatible
    captures, showing the reason for the incompatibility and what
    device was captured on and replayed on.
  * Vulkan: Implemented tracking of printf statements from geometry
    shaders.
  * Vulkan: Allow buffer format re-interpreting of push constants.
  * OpenGL: Display the 'intuitive' state of face culling winding,
    rather than strictly following enums (e.g. when clip origin is
    non-default, GL_CCW frontface means that clockwise wound
    polygons are front-facing).

- Update to version 1.20
  * Views of buffers, either storage/raw buffers or constant buffers,

  * Most complex error messages (particularly those that reference some
    error replaying or problem with the API like a fatal error) now
    contain better explanations of what problem has happened.
  * UI: Tweak behaviour around closing all captures on shutdown to be
    more consistent.
  * D3D12: Support the encoded color in obfuscated PIX-style markers.
  * ARM: Update hardware counter library.
  * Vulkan: Add support for some extensions:
    - VK_KHR_pipeline_library
    - VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library
    - VK_QCOM_render_pass_store_ops
    - VK_GOOGLE_surfaceless_query

  portable and re-usable between APIs.
  * The location breadcrumbs in the event browser now has an
  edit button to edit the 'path' as a text string.

  * The resource inspector has some sorting options now.
  * Compute shader debugging can now be launched either by split
    workgroup & thread ID, or by global thread ID. 
  * The mesh viewer now allows you to select the axis convention of
    input vertex data for e.g. Z-up instead of Y-up or
    left/right-handed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 11 18:14:53 UTC 2021 - Patrik Jakobsson <patrik.jakobsson@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.16
  * The bindless feedback for D3D12 which was added in v1.15 now supports
    DXIL SM6.x shaders, via DXIL patching. 
  * The API backends have been hardened to handle the majority of cases
    where an API fatal error happens during replay while analysing a
    capture - device lost/TDR, out of GPU memory, or when using
    remote-replay if the remote server crashes or disconnects.
- osc build apparently auto-cleans your spec-file now (without even asking)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 10:44:42 UTC 2020 - Patrik Jakobsson <patrik.jakobsson@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.10 
  * Highlights
    - Reduced idle overhead while injected into programs, while not
      actively capturing a frame.
    - All APIs have seen improvements, though some will see greater
      savings than others especially depending on API usage
      patterns. Modern APIs (D3D12/Vulkan) with high frequency API
      calls and command buffer recording will likely see bigger
      savings.
    - Improved speed of capturing a frame on Vulkan when GPU-local
      host-visible uncached memory is mapped.
    - Improved application startup time from cold.
    - Improved replay time for switching events for Vulkan
      captures with large numbers of descriptors bound with few
      actually used (i.e. 'bindless' type workflows).
