- ### Fixed

* Corrupted CFF index data

  there was a subtle bug in cff index implementation that resulted in
  a data corruption. in certain circumstances some items didn't get
  properly encoded. this happened when items were not previously accessed.

  this resulted, for instance, in missing glyphs. but only sometimes
  because indexes might've still contain data that shouldn't've been
  there. in combination with incorrect encoding (see further) this
  resulted in some glyphs still being rendered, sometimes even correctly.

  along with the fix a rather large api change landed. this resulted in
  quite a big diff.

* Incorrect CFF encoding in subsets

  TTFunk used to reuse encoding from the original font. This mapping was
  incorrect for subset fonts which used not just a subset of glyphs but
  also a different encoding.

  A separate issue was that some fonts have empty CFF encoding. This
  incorrect mapping resulted in encoding that mapped all codes to glyph 0.

  This had impact on Prawn in particular. PDF spec explicitly says that
  CFF encoding is not to be used in OpenType fonts. `cmap` table should
  directly index charstrings in the CFF table. Despite this PDF renderers
  still use CFF encoding to retrieve glyphs. So TTFunk has to discard the
  original CFF encoding and supply its own.

  Alexander Mankuta

* `maxp` table

  The table is now correctly parsed and encoded for both TrueType and CFF-based
  OpenType fonts.

* Files are closed sooner

  Files were garbage collected but could stay open for longer than necessary.

  Jon Burgess

* Long date time in the `head` table

  The `created` and `modified` fields we parsed and encoded with incorrect
  endiannes. Additionally helper methods were added to convert these fields to
  and from Ruby `Time`.

   Jens Kutilek, Peter Goldstein

* Removed execution permissions on non-executable files
