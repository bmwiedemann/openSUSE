  <title>A comprehensive and flexible logging library written in Ruby</title>
  <description>Log4r is a comprehensive and flexible logging library written in Ruby for use
in Ruby programs. It features a hierarchical logging system of any number of
levels, custom level names, logger inheritance, multiple output destinations,
execution tracing, custom formatting, thread safteyness, XML and YAML
configuration, and more. 

Log4r is an adherent to the philosophy of logging using simple print
statements. What Log4r adds to this philosophy is a flexible way of controling
the information being logged. Log information can be sent to any kind of
destination and with varying degrees of importance. Log4r is designed so that
logging statements can remain in production code with almost no extra
computational cost.

Log4r intends to be easy to use and configure, no matter the complexity. Casual
scripts can use Log4r right away with minimal configuration, while more
sophisticated applications can set up a structured configuration file in XML or
YAML. Comprehensive documentation is provided, with a user's manual, a
reference API, and over a dozen examples. Log4r attempts to abide by the
Principle of Least Surprise, which means that it works as intended at all
points. 

Log4r was inspired by and provides much of the features of the Apache Log4j
project, but is not a direct implementation or clone. Aside from superficial
similarities, the projects are not related in any way and the code base is
completely distinct. Log4r was developed without even looking at the Apache
Log4j code.
