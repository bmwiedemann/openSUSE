  <title>Real-time Audio I/O Library</title>
  <description>RtAudio is a set of C++ classes that provide a common API for realtime audio
input/output across different operating systems. RtAudio significantly
simplifies the process of interacting with computer audio hardware. It was
designed with the following objectives:

  * object-oriented C++ design
  * simple, common API across all supported platforms
  * allow simultaneous multi-api support
  * support dynamic connection of devices
  * provide extensive audio device parameter control
  * allow audio device capability probing
  * automatic internal conversion for data format, channel number compensation,
    (de)interleaving, and byte-swapping
