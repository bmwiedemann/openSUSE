RtAudio is a set of C++ classes that provide a common API for
realtime audio input/output across different operating systems.
RtAudio allows simultaneous multi API support, supports dynamic
connection of devices, provides extensive audio device parameter
control, allows audio device capability probing, and has automatic
internal conversion for data format, channel number compensation,
(de)interleaving, and byte-swapping.
