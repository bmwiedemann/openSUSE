      (@taoza).
  *   Updated the IANA media registry entries as of release date:
  
      *   Updated metadata for application/EmergencyCallData.Comment\+xml,
          application/EmergencyCallData.DeviceInfo\+xml,

          finally been registered. As such, this version *reverses* the

      issue with JSON data encoding for the `xrefs` field.
