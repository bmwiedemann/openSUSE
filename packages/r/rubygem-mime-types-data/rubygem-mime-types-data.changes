      (@taoza).
  *   Updated the IANA media registry entries as of release date:

          finally been registered. As such, this version *reverses* the
          use-instead relationship of image/bmp and image/x-bmp.
  
  *   This version requires mime-types 3.1 or later to manage data because of an
      issue with JSON data encoding for the `xrefs` field.
