- Update to 5.5:
  * NEW raylib pre-configured Windows package: The new raylib portable and
    self-contained Windows package for raylib 5.5, intended for nobel devs that
    start in programming world, comes with one big addition: support for C code
    building for Web platform with one-single-mouse-click! For the last 10
    years, the pre-configured raylib Windows package allowed to edit simple C
    projects on Notepad++ and easely compile Windows executables with an
    automatic script; this new release adds the possibility to compile the same
    C projects for Web platform with a simple mouse click. This new addition
    greatly simplifies C to WebAssembly project building for new users. The
    raylib Windows Installer package can be downloaded for free from raylib on
    itch.io.
  * NEW raylib project creator tool: A brand new tool developed to help raylib
    users to setup new projects in a professional way. raylib project creator
    generates a complete project structure with multiple build systems
    ready-to-use and GitHub CI/CD actions pre-configured. It only requires
    providing some C files and basic project parameters! The tools is free and
    open-source, and it can be used online!.
  * NEW Platform backend supported: RGFW: Thanks to the rcore platform-split
    implemented in raylib 5.0, adding new platforms backends has been greatly
    simplified, new backends can be added using provided template,
    self-contained in a single C module, completely portable. A new platform
    backend has been added: RGFW. RGFW is a new single-file header-only
    portable library (RGFW.h) intended for platform-functionality management
    (windowing and inputs); in this case for desktop platforms (Windows, Linux,
    macOS) but also for Web platform. It adds a new alternative to the already
    existing GLFW and SDL platform backends.
  * NEW Platform backend version supported: SDL3: Previous raylib 5.0 added
    support for SDL2 library, and raylib 5.5 not only improves SDL2
    functionality, with several issues reviewed, but also adds support for the
    recently released big SDL update in years: SDL3. Now users can select at
    compile time the desired SDL version to use, increasing the number of
    potential platforms supported in the future!
  * NEW Retro-console platforms supported: Dreamcast, N64, PSP, PSVita, PS4:
    Thanks to the platform-split on raylib 5.0, supporting new platform
    backends is easier than ever! Along the raylib rlgl module support for the
    OpenGL 1.1 graphics API, it opened the door to multiple homebrew
    retro-consoles backend implementations! It's amazing to see raylib running
    on +20 year old consoles like Dreamcast, PSP or PSVita, considering the
    hardware constraints of those platforms and proves raylib outstanding
    versability! Those additional platforms can be found in separate
    repositories and have been created by the amazing programmer Antonio Jose
    Ramos Marquez (@psxdev).
  * NEW GPU Skinning support: After lots of requests for this feature, it has
    been finally added to raylib thanks to the contributor Daniel Holden
    (@orangeduck), probably the developer that has further pushed models
    animations with raylib, developing two amazing tools to visualize and test
    animations: GenoView and BVHView. Adding GPU skinning was a tricky feature,
    considering it had to be available for all raylib supported platforms,
    including limited ones like Raspberry Pi with OpenGL ES 2.0, where some
    advance OpenGL features are not available (UBO, SSBO, Transform Feedback)
    but a multi-platform solution was found to make it possible. A new example,
    models_gpu_skinning has been added to illustrate this new functionality. As
    an extra, previous existing CPU animation system has been greatly improved,
    multiplying performance by a factor (simplifiying required maths).
  * NEW raymath C++ operators: After several requested for this feature, C++
    math operators for Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Quaternion and Matrix has
    been added to raymath as an extension to current implementation. Despite
    being only available for C++ because C does not support it, these operators
    simplify C++ code when doing math operations.
  * Normals support on batching system
  * Clipboard images reading support
  * CRC32/MD5/SHA1 hash computation
  * Gamepad vibration support
  * Improved font loading (no GPU required) with BDF fonts support
  * Time-based camera movement
  * Improved GLTF animations loading

  * For details check project changelog

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 20 09:23:14 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 4.5.0:
  * NEW Improved ANGLE support on Desktop platforms: Support for OpenGL ES 2.0 on Desktop platforms (Windows,
    Linux, macOS) has been reviewed by @wtnbgo GitHub user. Now raylib can be compiled on desktop for OpenGL
    ES 2.0 and linked against ANGLE. This small addition open the door to building raylib for all ANGLE
    supported backends: Direct3D 11, Vulkan and Metal. Please note that this new feature is still experimental
    and requires further testing!
  * NEW Camera module: A brand new implementation from scratch for rcamera module, contributed by @Crydsch
    GitHub user! New camera system is simpler, more flexible, more granular and more extendable. Specific camera
    math transformations (movement/rotation) have been moved to individual functions, exposing them to users if
    required. Global state has been removed from the module and standalone usage has been greatly improved; now
    rcamera.h single-file header-only library can be used externally, independently of raylib. A new
    UpdateCameraPro() function has been added to address input-dependency of UpdateCamera(), now advance users
    have full control over camera inputs and movement/rotation speeds!
  * NEW Support for M3D models and M3D/GLTF animations: 3d models animations support has been a limited aspect of
    raylib for long time, some versions ago IQM animations were supported but raylib 4.5 also adds support for
    the brand new M3D file format, including animations and the long expected support for GLTF animations! The
    new M3D file format is simple, portable, feature complete, extensible and open source. It also provides a
    complete set of tools to export/visualize M3D models from/to Blender! Now raylib supports up to 3 model
    file-formats with animations: IQM, GLTF and M3D.
  * NEW Support QOA audio format (import/export): Just a couple of months ago the new QOA file format was
    published, a very simple, portable and open source quite-ok-audio file format. raylib already supports it,
    added to raudio module and including audio loading from file, loading from memory, streaming from file,
    streaming from memory and exporting to QOA audio format. Because simplicity really matters to raylib!
  * NEW Module for compressed textures loading: rl_gputex, a portable single-file header-only small library to
    load compressed texture file-formats (DDS, PKM, KTX, PVR, ASTC). Provided functionality is not new to raylib
    but it was part of the raylib rtextures module, now it has been moved into a separate self-contained library,
    improving portability. Note that this module is only intended to load compressed data from files, ready to be
    uploaded to GPU, no compression/decompression functionality is provided. This change is a first step towards
    a better modularization of raylib library.
  * Reviewed rlgl module for automatic limits checking: Again, rlgl has been reviewed to simplify usage. Now
    users do not need to worry about reaching the internal render-batch limits when they send their triangles to
    draw 2d/3d, rlgl manages it automatically! This change allows a great simplification for other modules like
    rshapes, rtextures and rmodels that do not need to worry about bufffer overflows and can just define as many
    vertex as desired!
  * Reviewed rshapes module to minimize the rlgl dependency: Now rshapes 2d shapes drawing functions only depend
    on 6 low-level functions: rlBegin(), rlEnd(), rlVertex3f(), rlTexCoord2f(), rlNormal3f(), rlSetTexture().
    With only those pseudo-OpenGl 1.1 minimal functionality, everything can be drawn! This improvement converts
    rshapes module in a self-contained, portable shapes-drawing library that can be used independently of raylib,
    as far as entry points for those 6 functions are provided by the user. It even allows to be used for software
    rendering, with the proper backend!
  * Added data structures validation functions: Multiple functions have been added by @RobLoach GitHub user to
    ease the validation of raylib data structures: IsImageReady(), IsTextureReady(), IsSoundReady()... Now users
    have a simple mechanism to make sure data has been correctly loaded, instead of checking internal structure
    values by themselfs.

Thu Nov  3 12:43:51 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Switch -DUSE_EXTERNAL_GLFW to OFF:
  Earlier we build required on our glfw package.
  But with raylib 4.2.0 they started to use features are only
  in the development version.
  They were unhappy that glfw 3.4.0 takes a long time to be
  relased and decided to create a in-tree copy.
  So for raylib 4.2.0 to build we need to use this in-tree version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 12 05:37:23 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 4.2.0:
  * extra libraries cleanup:
  * examples review
  * rres resource format
  * raygui official gui library
  * new file system API
  * New audio stream processors API
  * For details see https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/4.2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 28 17:50:08 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 4.0.0:
  * Naming consistency and coherency: API has been completely
    reviewed to be consistent on naming conventions
  * Event Automation System: This new experimental feature has been
    added for future usage, it allows to record input events and
    re-play them automatically.
  * Custom game-loop control: As requested by some advance users,
    the game-loop control can be exposed
  * For details see: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/4.0.0/CHANGELOG

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 19 09:27:56 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to 3.7.0
  * rlgl module for greater abstraction level. Now rlgl functionality
    is self-contained in the module and used by higher-level layers,
  * Multiple rlgl functions have been renamed for consistency
  * A new API has been added, more comprehensive and better integrated
    with raylib, the new stereo rendering can be combined with
    RenderTexture and Shader API allowing the user to manage fbo and
    distortion shader directly.
  * New file access callbacks system.
  * glTF animations support.
  * raylib supports music streamming from memory data for all
    supported file formats: WAV, OGG, MP3, FLAC, XM and MOD.
  * Most raylib enums names and values names have been renamed for
    consistency, now all value names start with the type of data
    they represent.
  * See: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/3.7.0/CHANGELOG
- Drop raylib-3.0.0-noexamples.patch
- Edit _service:
  * Exclude examples as they are licensed under unsupported licenses
    (Upstream does not provid the -noexamples package anymore)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 14:46:21 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 3.5.0:
  * Platform supported: Raspberry Pi 4 native mode (no X11 windows)
    through DRM subsystem and GBM API. Actually this is a really
    interesting improvement because it opens the door to raylib to
	support other embedded platforms (Odroid, GameShell, NanoPi...).
    Also worth mentioning the un-official homebrew ports of raylib
    for PS4 and PSVita.
  * NEW configuration options exposed: For custom raylib builds,
    config.h now exposes more than 150 flags and defines to build
    raylib with only the desired features, for example, it allows to
    build a minimal raylib library in just some KB removing all
    external data filetypes supported, very useful to generate small
    executables or embedded devices.
  * NEW automatic GIF recording feature: Actually, automatic GIF
    recording (CTRL+F12) for any raylib application has been available
    for some versions but this feature was really slow and low-performant
    using an old gif library with many file-accesses. It has been replaced
    by a high-performant alternative (msf_gif.h) that operates directly
    on memory... and actually works very well! Try it out!
  * NEW RenderBatch system: rlgl module has been redesigned to support
    custom render batches to allow grouping draw calls as desired, previous
    implementation just had one default render batch. This feature has not
    been exposed to raylib API yet but it can be used by advance users dealing
    with rlgl directly. For example, multiple RenderBatch can be created
    for 2D sprites and 3D geometry independently.
  * NEW Framebuffer system: rlgl module now exposes an API for custom Framebuffer
    attachments (including cubemaps!). raylib RenderTexture is a basic
    use-case, just allowing color and depth textures, but this new API allows
    the creation of more advance Framebuffers with multiple attachments,
    like the G-Buffers. GenTexture*() functions have been redesigned to use this new API.
  * Improved software rendering: raylib Image*() API is intended for
    software rendering, for those cases when no GPU or no Window is available.
    Those functions operate directly with multi-format pixel data on RAM and
    they have been completely redesigned to be way faster, specially for small
    resolutions and retro-gaming. Low-end embedded devices like microcontrollers
    with custom displays could benefit of this raylib functionality!
  * File loading from memory: Multiple functions have been redesigned to load
    data from memory buffers instead of directly accessing the files, now all
    raylib file loading/saving goes through a couple of functions that load
    data into memory. This feature allows custom virtual-file-systems and it
    gives more control to the user to access data already loaded in memory
    (i.e. images, fonts, sounds...).
  * NEW Window states management system: raylib core module has been
    redesigned to support Window state check and setup more easily and also
    before/after Window initialization, SetConfigFlags() has been reviewed and
    SetWindowState() has been added to control Window minification,
    maximization, hidding, focusing, topmost and more.
  * For details see CHANGELOG file

  Raysan seems to have forgotten that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 29 09:59:00 UTC 2020 - Scott Young <dev@iotib.net>
- Added missing development header files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 09:17:57 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0:
  * All global variables from the multiple raylib modules have
    been moved to a global context state, it has several benefits, first, better
    code readability with more comprehensive variables naming and categorization
    (organized by types, i.e. CORE.Window.display.width,
    CORE.Input.Keyboard.currentKeyState or RLGL.State.modelview). Second, it allows
    better memory management to load global context state dynamically when required
    (not at the moment), making it easy to implement a hot-reloading mechanism if
    desired.
  * All memory allocations on raylib and its dependencies now use
    RL_MALLOC, RL_FREE and similar macros. Now users can easely hook their own
    memory allocations mechanism if desired, having more control over memory
    allocated internally by the library. Additionally, it makes it easier to port
    the library to embedded devices where memory control is critical. For more info
    check raylib issue #1074.
  * All I/O file accesses from raylib are being moved
    to memory data access, now all I/O file access is centralized into just four
    functions: LoadFileData(), SaveFileData(), LoadFileText(), SaveFileText().
    Users can just update those functions to any I/O file system. This change makes
    it easier to integrate raylib with Virtual File Systems or custom I/O file
    implementations.
  * All raylib data structures have been reviewed and optimized
    for pass-by-value usage. One of raylib distinctive design decisions is that
    most of its functions receive and return data by value. This design makes
    raylib really simple for newcomers, avoiding pointers and allowing complete
    access to all structures data in a simple way. The downside is that data is
    copied on stack every function call and that copy could be costly so, all
    raylib data structures have been optimized to stay under 64 bytes for fast copy
    and retrieve.
  * All raylib tracelog messages have been reviewd and categorized
    for a more comprehensive output information when developing raylib
    applications, now all display, input, timer, platform, auxiliar libraries,
    file-accesses, data loading/unloading issues are properly reported with more
    detailed and visual messages.
  * raudio module has been internally reviewed to
    accomodate the new Music structure (converted from previous pointer format) and
    the module has been adapted to the highly improved miniaudio v0.10.
  * text module reviewed to improve fonts generation and text management functions, Font
    structure has been redesigned to better accomodate characters data, decoupling
    individual characters as Image glyphs from the font atlas parameters. Several
    improvements have been made to better support Unicode strings with UTF-8
    encoding.
  * Multiple new examples added (most of them contributed by raylib
    users) and all examples reviewed for correct execution on most of the supported
    platforms, specially Web and Raspberry Pi. A detailed categorized table has
    been created on github for easy examples navigation and code access.
  * New GitHub Actions CI system has been implemented for Windows, Linux and macOS code
    and examples compilation on every new commit or PR to make sure library keeps
    stable and usable with no breaking bugs.
  * Note that only key changes are
    listed here but there is way more! About 30 new functions, multiple functions
    reviewed, bindings to +40 programming languages and great
    samples/demos/tutorials created by the community, including raylib integration
    with Spine, Unity, Tiled, Nuklear, enet and more!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 31 09:26:07 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 2.5.0:
  * New window management and filesystem functions to query monitor
    information, deal with clipboard, check directory files info and
    even launch a URL with default system web browser. Experimental
    High-DPI monitor support has also been added through a compile flag.
  * Redesigned Gamepad mechanism, now generic for all platforms and
    gamepads, no more specific gamepad configurations.
  * Redesigned UWP input system, now raylib supports UWP seamlessly,
    previous implementation required a custom input system implemented
    in user code.
  * rlgl module has been redesigned to support a unique buffer for
    shapes drawing batching, including LINES, TRIANGLES, QUADS in the
    same indexed buffer, also added support for multi-buffering if required.
    Additionally, rlPushMatrix()/rlPopMatrix() functionality has been
    reviewed to behave exactly like OpenGL 1.1, models_rlgl_solar_system
    example has been added to illustrate this behaviour.
  * VR simulator has been reviewed to allow custom configuration of
    Head-Mounted-Device parameters and distortion shader, core_vr_simulator
    has been properly adapted to showcase this new functionality, now
    the VR simulator is a generic configurable stereo rendering system
    that allows any VR device simulation with just a few lines of code
    or even dynamic tweaking of HMD parameters.
  * Support for Unicode text drawing; now raylib processes UTF8
    strings on drawing, supporting Unicode codepoints, allowing rendering
    mostly any existent language (as long as the font with the glyphs is provided).
  * Brand new text management API, with the addition of multiple functions
    to deal with string data
  * Multiple new shapes and textures drawing functions 
  * Experimental cubemap support, to automatically load multiple
    cubemap layouts (LoadTextureCubemap()).
  * Skeletal animation support for 3d models, this addition implied a
    redesign of Model data structure to accomodate multiple mesh/multiple
    materials support and bones information. Multiple models functions
    have been reviewed and added on this process, also glTF models
    loading support has been added.
