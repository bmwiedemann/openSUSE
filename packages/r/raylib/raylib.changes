- Update to 2.5.0:
  * New window management and filesystem functions to query monitor
    information, deal with clipboard, check directory files info and
    even launch a URL with default system web browser. Experimental
    High-DPI monitor support has also been added through a compile flag.
  * Redesigned Gamepad mechanism, now generic for all platforms and
    gamepads, no more specific gamepad configurations.
  * Redesigned UWP input system, now raylib supports UWP seamlessly,
    previous implementation required a custom input system implemented
    in user code.
  * rlgl module has been redesigned to support a unique buffer for
    shapes drawing batching, including LINES, TRIANGLES, QUADS in the
    same indexed buffer, also added support for multi-buffering if required.
    Additionally, rlPushMatrix()/rlPopMatrix() functionality has been
    reviewed to behave exactly like OpenGL 1.1, models_rlgl_solar_system
    example has been added to illustrate this behaviour.
  * VR simulator has been reviewed to allow custom configuration of
    Head-Mounted-Device parameters and distortion shader, core_vr_simulator
    has been properly adapted to showcase this new functionality, now
    the VR simulator is a generic configurable stereo rendering system
    that allows any VR device simulation with just a few lines of code
    or even dynamic tweaking of HMD parameters.
  * Support for Unicode text drawing; now raylib processes UTF8
    strings on drawing, supporting Unicode codepoints, allowing rendering
    mostly any existent language (as long as the font with the glyphs is provided).
  * Brand new text management API, with the addition of multiple functions
    to deal with string data
  * Multiple new shapes and textures drawing functions 
  * Experimental cubemap support, to automatically load multiple
    cubemap layouts (LoadTextureCubemap()).
  * Skeletal animation support for 3d models, this addition implied a
    redesign of Model data structure to accomodate multiple mesh/multiple
    materials support and bones information. Multiple models functions
    have been reviewed and added on this process, also glTF models
    loading support has been added.
  * For details see Changelog file
