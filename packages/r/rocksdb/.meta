  <title>RocksDB</title>
  <description>RocksDB is a high performance embedded database for key-value data.
It is a fork of LevelDB which was then optimized to exploit many
central processing unit (CPU) cores, and make efficient use of fast
storage, such as solid-state drives (SSD), for input/output (I/O)
bound workloads. It is based on a log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree)
data structure.</description>
