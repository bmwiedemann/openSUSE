- update constraints for reliable building

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 13:51:07 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 8.6.7
  * Fixed a bug where compaction read under non direct IO still falls back to RocksDB internal prefetching after file system's prefetching returns non-OK status other than Status::NotSupported()
  * For non direct IO, eliminate the file system prefetching attempt for compaction read when Options::compaction_readahead_size is 0

- update to 8.6.6
  * Fix a bug with atomic_flush=true that can cause DB to stuck after a flush fails 
  * Fix a bug where RocksDB (with atomic_flush=false) can delete output SST files of pending flushes when a previous concurrent flush fails
  * When the compressed secondary cache capacity is reduced to 0, it should be completely disabled. Before this fix, inserts and lookups would still go to the backing LRUCache

- update to 8.6.5
  * Fixed a bug where rocksdb.file.read.verify.file.checksums.micros is not populated.

- update to 8.6.4
  * Public API change: Add a column family option default_temperature that is used for file reading accounting purpose, such as io statistics, for files that don't have an explicitly set temperature.

- update to 8.6.3
  * Fix a bug where if there is an error reading from offset 0 of a file from L1+ and that the file is not the first file in the sorted run, data can be lost in compaction and read/scan can return incorrect results.
  * Fix a bug where iterator may return incorrect result for DeleteRange() users if there was an error reading from a file.

- update to 8.6.2
 * Fix for async_io where during seek, when reading a block for seeking a target key in a file without any readahead, the iterator aligned the read on a page boundary and reading more than necessary. This increased the storage read bandwidth usage.

- update to 8.6.1
  * Options::compaction_readahead_size 's default value is changed from 0 to 2MB.
  * Compaction read performance will regress when Options::compaction_readahead_size is explicitly set to 0

- update to 8.6.0
  * Added enhanced data integrity checking on SST files with new format_version=6. 
  * Add a new feature to trim readahead_size during scans upto upper_bound when iterate_upper_bound is specified. 
  * RocksDB will compare the number of input keys to the number of keys processed after each compaction. 
  * Add a CF option bottommost_file_compaction_delay to allow specifying the delay of bottommost level single-file compactions.
  * Add support to allow enabling / disabling user-defined timestamps feature for an existing column family in combination with the in-Memtable only feature.
  * Implement a new admission policy for the compressed secondary cache that admits blocks evicted from the primary cache with the hit bit set. 
  * Add a column family option memtable_max_range_deletions that limits the number of range deletions in a memtable.
  * Add PutEntity API in sst_file_writer
  * Add timeout in microsecond option to WaitForCompactOptions 
  * New statistics rocksdb.file.read.{get|multiget|db.iterator|verify.checksum|verify.file.checksums}.micros measure read time of block-based SST tables or blob files during db open, Get(), MultiGet(), using db iterator, VerifyFileChecksums() and VerifyChecksum(). They require stats level greater than StatsLevel::kExceptDetailedTimers.
  * Add close_db option to WaitForCompactOptions to call Close() after waiting is done.
  * Add a new compression option CompressionOptions::checksum for enabling ZSTD's checksum feature to detect corruption during decompression.
  * Mark Options::access_hint_on_compaction_start related APIs as deprecated. 
  * Statistics rocksdb.sst.read.micros now includes time spent on multi read and async read into the file
  * For Universal Compaction users, periodic compaction (option periodic_compaction_seconds) will be set to 30 days by default if block based table is used.
  * Fix a bug in FileTTLBooster that can cause users with a large number of levels (more than 65) to see errors like "runtime error: shift exponent .. is too large.." 


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 27 16:56:46 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 8.5.4:
  * Fix a bug where compaction read under non direct IO still falls
    back to RocksDB internal prefetching after file system's
    prefetching returns non-OK status other than
    Status::NotSupported()
  * For non direct IO, eliminate the file system prefetching
    attempt for compaction read when
    Options::compaction_readahead_size is 0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  6 06:44:11 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 8.5.3
  * Fixed a race condition in GenericRateLimiter that could cause it to stop granting requests

- update to 8.5.2
  * Fix a bug where iterator may return incorrect result for DeleteRange() users if there was an error reading from a file.

- update to 8.5.1
  * Fix a bug where if there is an error reading from offset 0 of a file from L1+ and that the file is not the first file in the sorted run, data can be lost in compaction and read/scan can return incorrect results.

- update to 8.5.0
  * Public API Changes:
      Removed recently added APIs GeneralCache and MakeSharedGeneralCache() as our plan changed to stop exposing a general-purpose cache interface. The old forms of these APIs, Cache and NewLRUCache(), are still available, although general-purpose caching support will be dropped eventually.
  * Behavior Changes
      Option periodic_compaction_seconds no longer supports FIFO compaction: setting it has no effect on FIFO compactions. FIFO compaction users should only set option ttl instead.
      Move prefetching responsibility to page cache for compaction read for non directIO use case
  * Performance Improvements
      In case of direct_io, if buffer passed by callee is already aligned, RandomAccessFileRead::Read will avoid realloacting a new buffer, reducing memcpy and use already passed aligned buffer.
      Small efficiency improvement to HyperClockCache by reducing chance of compiler-generated heap allocations
  * Bug Fixes
      Fix use_after_free bug in async_io MultiReads when underlying FS enabled kFSBuffer. kFSBuffer is when underlying FS pass their own buffer instead of using RocksDB scratch in FSReadRequest. Right now it's an experimental feature.
      Fix a bug in FileTTLBooster that can cause users with a large number of levels (more than 65) to see errors like "runtime error: shift exponent .. is too large.."

Thu Jul 27 13:10:54 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 8.3.2
  * Bug Fixes:
      Reduced cases of illegally using Env::Default() during static destruction by never destroying the internal PosixEnv itself
- update to 8.3.1
  * Performance Improvements:
      Fixed higher read QPS during DB::Open() reading files created prior to #11406, 
- update to 8.3.0
  * New Features:
      Introduced a new option block_protection_bytes_per_key, which can be used to enable per key-value integrity protection for in-memory blocks in block cache 
      Improve the operational safety of publishing a DB or SST files to many hosts by using different block cache hash seeds on different hosts.
      Introduced a new option CompactionOptionsFIFO::file_temperature_age_thresholds that allows FIFO compaction to compact files to different temperatures based on key age 
      Added a new ticker stat to count how many times RocksDB detected a corruption while verifying a block checksum: BLOCK_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH_COUNT.
      New statistics rocksdb.file.read.db.open.micros that measures read time of block-based SST tables or blob files during db open.
      New statistics tickers for various iterator seek behaviors and relevant filtering, as *_LEVEL_SEEK_*. (#11460)
  * Public API Changes:
      EXPERIMENTAL: Add new API DB::ClipColumnFamily to clip the key in CF to a certain range. It will physically deletes all keys outside the range including tombstones.
      Add MakeSharedCache() construction functions to various cache Options objects, and deprecated the NewWhateverCache() functions with long parameter lists.
      Changed the meaning of various Bloom filter stats (prefix vs. whole key), with iterator-related filtering only being tracked in the new *_LEVEL_SEEK_*. stats. (#11460)
  * Behavior changes:
      For x86, CPU features are no longer detected at runtime nor in build scripts, but in source code using common preprocessor defines. 
      This will likely unlock some small performance improvements on some newer hardware, but could hurt performance of the kCRC32c checksum, 
      which is no longer the default, on some "portable" builds. See PR #11419 for details.
  * Bug Fixes:
      Delete an empty WAL file on DB open if the log number is less than the min log number to keep
      Delete temp OPTIONS file on DB open if there is a failure to write it out or rename it
  * Performance Improvements:
      Improved the I/O efficiency of prefetching SST metadata by recording more information in the DB manifest.

Fri Apr 21 12:55:27 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <Andreas.Stieger@gmx.de>

- RocksDB 8.1.1
  * Compaction output file cutting logic now considers range
    tombstone start keys. For example, SST partitioner now may
    receive ParitionRequest for range tombstone start keys.
  * If the async_io ReadOption is specified for MultiGet or
    NewIterator on a platform that doesn't support IO uring, the
    option is ignored and synchronous IO is used.
  * Add support for SecondaryCache with HyperClockCache
  * New statistics and performance counters
  * bug fixes
  * API changes: Changed various functions and features in Cache
    that are mostly relevant to custom implementations or wrappers
