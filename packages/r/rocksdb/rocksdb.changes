Sat Jun 29 13:24:27 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 9.3.1:
  * Optimistic transactions and pessimistic transactions with the
    WriteCommitted policy now support the GetEntity API.
  * Added new Iterator property, "rocksdb.iterator.is-value-pinned",
    for checking whether the Slice returned by Iterator::value()
    can be used until the Iterator is destroyed.
  * Optimistic transactions and WriteCommitted pessimistic
    transactions now support the MultiGetEntity API.
  * Optimistic transactions and pessimistic transactions with the
    WriteCommitted policy now support the PutEntity API. Support
    for read APIs and other write policies (WritePrepared,
    WriteUnprepared) will be added later.
  * Exposed block based metadata cache options via C API
  * Exposed compaction pri via c api.
  * Add a kAdmPolicyAllowAll option to TieredAdmissionPolicy that
    admits all blocks evicted from the primary block cache into
   the compressed secondary cache.
  * CompactRange() with change_level=true on a CF with FIFO
    compaction will return Status::NotSupported().
  * External file ingestion with FIFO compaction will always ingest
    to L0.
  * bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 23 20:13:16 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 9.2.1:
  * Added two options deadline and max_size_bytes for CacheDumper
    to exit early
  * API for wide-column point lookups with read-your-own-writes
    consistency, and a batched versions of the same
  * API to support programmatically read a SST file as a raw table
    file
  * API to wait for background purge to complete
  * DeleteRange() will return NotSupported() if row_cache is
    configured since they don't work together in some cases
  * Deprecated CompactionOptions::compression
  * Using OptionChangeMigration() to migrate from non-FIFO to FIFO
    compaction with Options::compaction_options_fifo.
    max_table_files_size > 0 can cause the whole DB to be dropped
    right after migration if the migrated data is larger than
    max_table_files_size
  * Various behavior changes, and changes of defaults
  * On distributed file systems that support file system level
    checksum verification and reconstruction reads, RocksDB will
    now retry a file read if the initial read fails RocksDB block
    level or record level checksum verification. This applies to
    MANIFEST file reads when the DB is opened, and to SST file
    reads at all times.
  * Bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 22 20:56:46 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 9.1.1:
  * Adde an option GetMergeOperandsOptions::continue_cb to give
    users the ability to end GetMergeOperands()'s lookup process
    before all merge operands were found.
  * Add sanity checks for ingesting external files that currently
    checks if the user key comparator used to create the file is
    compatible with the column family's user key comparator.
  * Support ingesting external files for column family that has
    user-defined timestamps in memtable only enabled
  * On file systems that support storage level data checksum and
    reconstruction, retry SST block reads for point lookups, scans,
    and flush and compaction if there's a checksum mismatch on the
    initial read.
  * Some enhancements and fixes to experimental Temperature handling
    features, including new default_write_temperature CF option and
    opening an SstFileWriter with a temperature.
  * WriteBatchWithIndex now supports wide-column point lookups via
    the GetEntityFromBatch API.
  * Implement experimental features:
    API Iterator::GetProperty("rocksdb.iterator.write-time") to
    allow users to get data's approximate write unix time and write
    data with a specific write time via WriteBatch::TimedPut API.
- drop rocksdb-9.0.0-Fix-zstd-typo-in-cmake.patch, upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 18 06:08:39 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 9.0.1:
  * Fix CMake Javadoc and source jar builds
  * Fix Java SstFileMetaData to prevent throwing
    java.lang.NoSuchMethodError

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 19 20:47:00 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 9.0.0:
  * Provide support for FSBuffer for point lookups. Also added
    support for scans and compactions that don't go through prefetching.
  * *Make SstFileWriter create SST files without persisting user
    defined timestamps when the
    Option.persist_user_defined_timestamps flag is set to false.
  * Add support for user-defined timestamps in APIs
    DeleteFilesInRanges and GetPropertiesOfTablesInRange.
  * Mark wal_compression feature as production-ready. Currently
    only compatible with ZSTD compression.
  * Public API Changes, including incompatible changes
  * format_version=6 is the new default setting in
    BlockBasedTableOptions, for more robust data integrity
    checking. DBs and SST files written with this setting cannot be
    read by RocksDB versions before 8.6.0.
  * Compactions can be scheduled in parallel in an additional
    scenario: multiple files are marked for compaction within a
    single column family
  * For leveled compaction, RocksDB will try to do intra-L0
    compaction if the total L0 size is small compared to Lbase.
  * Users with atomic_flush=true are more likely to see the impact
    of this change.
  * Bug Fixes
- add rocksdb-9.0.0-Fix-zstd-typo-in-cmake.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 28 15:18:46 UTC 2024 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 8.11.3:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix a bug where older data of an ingested key can be returned for read when universal compaction is used
    + Apply appropriate rate limiting and priorities in more places.

- update to 8.11.0:
  * New Features
    + Add new statistics: rocksdb.sst.write.micros measures time of each write to SST file 

  * Public API Changes
    + Added another enumerator kVerify to enum class FileOperationType in listener.h. 
      Update your switch statements as needed.
    + Add CompressionOptions to the CompressedSecondaryCacheOptions structure to allow users to specify 
      library specific options when creating the compressed secondary cache.
    + Deprecated several options: level_compaction_dynamic_file_size, ignore_max_compaction_bytes_for_input, 
    + check_flush_compaction_key_order, flush_verify_memtable_count, compaction_verify_record_count, 
      fail_if_options_file_error, and enforce_single_del_contracts
    + Exposed options ttl via c api.

  * Behavior Changes
    + rocksdb.blobdb.blob.file.write.micros expands to also measure time writing the header and footer. 
      Therefore the COUNT may be higher and values may be smaller than before. For stacked BlobDB, 
      it no longer measures the time of explictly flushing blob file.
    + Files will be compacted to the next level if the data age exceeds periodic_compaction_seconds 
      except for the last level.
    + Reduced the compaction debt ratio trigger for scheduling parallel compactions
    + For leveled compaction with default compaction pri (kMinOverlappingRatio), 
      files marked for compaction will be prioritized over files not marked when picking a file 
      from a level for compaction.

  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix bug in auto_readahead_size that combined with IndexType::kBinarySearchWithFirstKey + fails 
      or iterator lands at a wrong key
    + Fixed some cases in which DB file corruption was detected but ignored on creating a backup with BackupEngine.
    + Fix bugs where rocksdb.blobdb.blob.file.synced includes blob files failed to get synced 
      and rocksdb.blobdb.blob.file.bytes.written includes blob bytes failed to get written.
    + Fixed a possible memory leak or crash on a failure (such as I/O error) 
      in automatic atomic flush of multiple column families.
    + Fixed some cases of in-memory data corruption using mmap reads with BackupEngine, sst_dump, or ldb.
    + Fixed issues with experimental preclude_last_level_data_seconds option that could interfere 
      with expected data tiering.
    + Fixed the handling of the edge case when all existing blob files become unreferenced. 
      Such files are now correctly deleted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 18:53:31 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 8.10.2:
  * Fix bug in auto_readahead_size that combined with
    IndexType::kBinarySearchWithFirstKey + fails or iterator lands
    at a wrong key

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 11 19:45:23 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 8.10.0:
  * Provide support for async_io to trim readahead_size by doing
    block cache lookup
  * Added initial wide-column support in WriteBatchWithIndex. This
    includes the PutEntity API and support for wide columns in the
    existing read APIs (GetFromBatch, GetFromBatchAndDB,
    MultiGetFromBatchAndDB, and BaseDeltaIterator).
  * Custom implementations of TablePropertiesCollectorFactory may
    now return a nullptr collector to decline processing a file,
    reducing callback overheads in such cases.
  * Make ReadOptions.auto_readahead_size default true
  * Bug fixes and performance improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 12 20:57:08 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 8.9.1:
  * Add GetEntity() and PutEntity() API implementation for
    Attribute Group support. Through the use of Column Families, 
    AttributeGroup enables users to logically group wide-column
    entities.
  * Make the EnableFileDeletion API not default to force enabling.
    For users that rely on this default behavior and still want to
    continue to use force enabling, they need to explicitly pass a
    true to EnableFileDeletion.
  * During off-peak hours defined by daily_offpeak_time_utc, the
    compaction picker will select a larger number of files for
    periodic compaction. This selection will include files that are
    projected to expire by the next off-peak start time, ensuring
    that these files are not chosen for periodic compaction outside
    of off-peak hours.
  * If an error occurs when writing to a trace file after
    DB::StartTrace(), the subsequent trace writes are skipped to
    avoid writing to a file that has previously seen error. In this
    case, DB::EndTrace() will also return a non-ok status with info
    about the error occured previously in its status message.
  * Deleting stale files upon recovery are delegated to SstFileManger
    if available so they can be rate limited.
  * Make RocksDB only call TablePropertiesCollector::Finish() once.
  * When WAL_ttl_seconds > 0, we now process archived WALs for
    deletion at least every WAL_ttl_seconds / 2 seconds. Previously
    it could be less frequent in case of small WAL_ttl_seconds values
     when size-based expiration (WAL_size_limit_MB > 0 ) was
    simultaneously enabled.
  * Fix a crash or assertion failure bug in experimental new
    HyperClockCache variant, especially when running with a
    SecondaryCache.
  * Fix a race between flush error recovery and db destruction that
    can lead to db crashing.
  * Fix some bugs in the index builder/reader path for user-
    defined timestamps in Memtable only feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 24 14:40:42 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 8.8.1
  * Bug fixes:
    - Make the cache memory reservation accounting in Tiered cache 
    (primary and compressed secondary cache) more accurate to avoid over/under charging the secondary cache.
    - Allow increasing the compressed_secondary_ratio in the Tiered cache after setting it to 0 to disable.

- update to 8.8.0
  * New features:
    - Introduce AttributeGroup by adding the first AttributeGroup support API, MultiGetEntity(). 
    - Added new tickers rocksdb.fifo.{max.size|ttl}.compactions to count FIFO compactions 
      that drop files for different reasons
    - Add an experimental offpeak duration awareness by setting DBOptions::daily_offpeak_time_utc in "HH:mm-HH:mm" format.
    - Users can now change the max bytes granted in a single refill period (i.e, burst) during runtime 
      by SetSingleBurstBytes() for RocksDB rate limiter
  * Public API Changes:
    - The default value of DBOptions::fail_if_options_file_error changed from false to true. 
    - Add new Cache APIs GetSecondaryCacheCapacity() and GetSecondaryCachePinnedUsage() 
      to return the configured capacity, and cache reservation charged to the secondary cache.
  * Behavior Changes:
    - For non direct IO, eliminate the file system prefetching attempt for compaction read 
      when Options::compaction_readahead_size is 0
    - During a write stop, writes now block on in-progress recovery attempts
    - Deleting stale files upon recovery are delegated to SstFileManger if available so they can be rate limited.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fix a bug in auto_readahead_size where first_internal_key of index blocks wasn't copied properly 
      resulting in corruption error when first_internal_key was used for comparison.
    - Fixed a bug where compaction read under non direct IO still falls back to RocksDB internal prefetching 
      after file system's prefetching returns non-OK status other than Status::NotSupported()
    - Add bounds check in WBWIIteratorImpl and make BaseDeltaIterator, WriteUnpreparedTxn and WritePreparedTxn 
      respect the upper bound and lower bound in ReadOption.
    - Fixed the handling of wide-column base values in the max_successive_merges logic.
    - Fixed a rare race bug involving a concurrent combination of Create/DropColumnFamily and/or Set(DB)Options 
      that could lead to inconsistency between (a) the DB's reported options state, (b) the DB options in effect, 
      and (c) the latest persisted OPTIONS file.
    - Fixed a possible underflow when computing the compressed secondary cache share of memory reservations 
      while updating the compressed secondary to total block cache ratio.
   * Performance Improvements
    - Improved the I/O efficiency of DB::Open a new DB with create_missing_column_families=true and many column families.

- update to 8.7.3
  * Behavior Changes:
    - Deleting stale files upon recovery are delegated to SstFileManger if available so they can be rate limited.
  * Public API Changes:
    - Add new Cache APIs GetSecondaryCacheCapacity() and GetSecondaryCachePinnedUsage() to return 
      the configured capacity, and cache reservation charged to the secondary cache.
  * Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed a possible underflow when computing the compressed secondary cache share of memory reservations 
      while updating the compressed secondary to total block cache ratio.
    - Fix an assertion failure when UpdeteTieredCache() is called in an idempotent manner.

Sat Oct 28 19:10:49 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update constraints for reliable building

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 13:51:07 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 8.6.7
  * Fixed a bug where compaction read under non direct IO still falls back to RocksDB internal prefetching after file system's prefetching returns non-OK status other than Status::NotSupported()
  * For non direct IO, eliminate the file system prefetching attempt for compaction read when Options::compaction_readahead_size is 0

- update to 8.6.6
  * Fix a bug with atomic_flush=true that can cause DB to stuck after a flush fails 
  * Fix a bug where RocksDB (with atomic_flush=false) can delete output SST files of pending flushes when a previous concurrent flush fails
  * When the compressed secondary cache capacity is reduced to 0, it should be completely disabled. Before this fix, inserts and lookups would still go to the backing LRUCache

- update to 8.6.5
  * Fixed a bug where rocksdb.file.read.verify.file.checksums.micros is not populated.

- update to 8.6.4
  * Public API change: Add a column family option default_temperature that is used for file reading accounting purpose, such as io statistics, for files that don't have an explicitly set temperature.

- update to 8.6.3
  * Fix a bug where if there is an error reading from offset 0 of a file from L1+ and that the file is not the first file in the sorted run, data can be lost in compaction and read/scan can return incorrect results.
  * Fix a bug where iterator may return incorrect result for DeleteRange() users if there was an error reading from a file.

- update to 8.6.2
 * Fix for async_io where during seek, when reading a block for seeking a target key in a file without any readahead, the iterator aligned the read on a page boundary and reading more than necessary. This increased the storage read bandwidth usage.

- update to 8.6.1
  * Options::compaction_readahead_size 's default value is changed from 0 to 2MB.
  * Compaction read performance will regress when Options::compaction_readahead_size is explicitly set to 0

- update to 8.6.0
  * Added enhanced data integrity checking on SST files with new format_version=6. 
  * Add a new feature to trim readahead_size during scans upto upper_bound when iterate_upper_bound is specified. 
  * RocksDB will compare the number of input keys to the number of keys processed after each compaction. 
  * Add a CF option bottommost_file_compaction_delay to allow specifying the delay of bottommost level single-file compactions.
  * Add support to allow enabling / disabling user-defined timestamps feature for an existing column family in combination with the in-Memtable only feature.
  * Implement a new admission policy for the compressed secondary cache that admits blocks evicted from the primary cache with the hit bit set. 
  * Add a column family option memtable_max_range_deletions that limits the number of range deletions in a memtable.
  * Add PutEntity API in sst_file_writer
  * Add timeout in microsecond option to WaitForCompactOptions 
  * New statistics rocksdb.file.read.{get|multiget|db.iterator|verify.checksum|verify.file.checksums}.micros measure read time of block-based SST tables or blob files during db open, Get(), MultiGet(), using db iterator, VerifyFileChecksums() and VerifyChecksum(). They require stats level greater than StatsLevel::kExceptDetailedTimers.
  * Add close_db option to WaitForCompactOptions to call Close() after waiting is done.
  * Add a new compression option CompressionOptions::checksum for enabling ZSTD's checksum feature to detect corruption during decompression.
  * Mark Options::access_hint_on_compaction_start related APIs as deprecated. 
  * Statistics rocksdb.sst.read.micros now includes time spent on multi read and async read into the file
  * For Universal Compaction users, periodic compaction (option periodic_compaction_seconds) will be set to 30 days by default if block based table is used.
  * Fix a bug in FileTTLBooster that can cause users with a large number of levels (more than 65) to see errors like "runtime error: shift exponent .. is too large.." 


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 27 16:56:46 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 8.5.4:
  * Fix a bug where compaction read under non direct IO still falls
    back to RocksDB internal prefetching after file system's
    prefetching returns non-OK status other than
    Status::NotSupported()
  * For non direct IO, eliminate the file system prefetching
    attempt for compaction read when
    Options::compaction_readahead_size is 0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  6 06:44:11 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 8.5.3
  * Fixed a race condition in GenericRateLimiter that could cause it to stop granting requests

- update to 8.5.2
  * Fix a bug where iterator may return incorrect result for DeleteRange() users if there was an error reading from a file.

- update to 8.5.1
  * Fix a bug where if there is an error reading from offset 0 of a file from L1+ and that the file is not the first file in the sorted run, data can be lost in compaction and read/scan can return incorrect results.

- update to 8.5.0
  * Public API Changes:
      Removed recently added APIs GeneralCache and MakeSharedGeneralCache() as our plan changed to stop exposing a general-purpose cache interface. The old forms of these APIs, Cache and NewLRUCache(), are still available, although general-purpose caching support will be dropped eventually.
  * Behavior Changes
      Option periodic_compaction_seconds no longer supports FIFO compaction: setting it has no effect on FIFO compactions. FIFO compaction users should only set option ttl instead.
      Move prefetching responsibility to page cache for compaction read for non directIO use case
  * Performance Improvements
      In case of direct_io, if buffer passed by callee is already aligned, RandomAccessFileRead::Read will avoid realloacting a new buffer, reducing memcpy and use already passed aligned buffer.
      Small efficiency improvement to HyperClockCache by reducing chance of compiler-generated heap allocations
  * Bug Fixes
      Fix use_after_free bug in async_io MultiReads when underlying FS enabled kFSBuffer. kFSBuffer is when underlying FS pass their own buffer instead of using RocksDB scratch in FSReadRequest. Right now it's an experimental feature.
      Fix a bug in FileTTLBooster that can cause users with a large number of levels (more than 65) to see errors like "runtime error: shift exponent .. is too large.."

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 27 13:10:54 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 8.3.2
  * Bug Fixes:
      Reduced cases of illegally using Env::Default() during static destruction by never destroying the internal PosixEnv itself
- update to 8.3.1
  * Performance Improvements:
      Fixed higher read QPS during DB::Open() reading files created prior to #11406, 
- update to 8.3.0
  * New Features:
      Introduced a new option block_protection_bytes_per_key, which can be used to enable per key-value integrity protection for in-memory blocks in block cache 
      Improve the operational safety of publishing a DB or SST files to many hosts by using different block cache hash seeds on different hosts.
      Introduced a new option CompactionOptionsFIFO::file_temperature_age_thresholds that allows FIFO compaction to compact files to different temperatures based on key age 
      Added a new ticker stat to count how many times RocksDB detected a corruption while verifying a block checksum: BLOCK_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH_COUNT.
      New statistics rocksdb.file.read.db.open.micros that measures read time of block-based SST tables or blob files during db open.
      New statistics tickers for various iterator seek behaviors and relevant filtering, as *_LEVEL_SEEK_*. (#11460)
  * Public API Changes:
      EXPERIMENTAL: Add new API DB::ClipColumnFamily to clip the key in CF to a certain range. It will physically deletes all keys outside the range including tombstones.
      Add MakeSharedCache() construction functions to various cache Options objects, and deprecated the NewWhateverCache() functions with long parameter lists.
      Changed the meaning of various Bloom filter stats (prefix vs. whole key), with iterator-related filtering only being tracked in the new *_LEVEL_SEEK_*. stats. (#11460)
  * Behavior changes:
      For x86, CPU features are no longer detected at runtime nor in build scripts, but in source code using common preprocessor defines. 
      This will likely unlock some small performance improvements on some newer hardware, but could hurt performance of the kCRC32c checksum, 
      which is no longer the default, on some "portable" builds. See PR #11419 for details.
  * Bug Fixes:
      Delete an empty WAL file on DB open if the log number is less than the min log number to keep
      Delete temp OPTIONS file on DB open if there is a failure to write it out or rename it
  * Performance Improvements:
      Improved the I/O efficiency of prefetching SST metadata by recording more information in the DB manifest. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 21 12:55:27 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <Andreas.Stieger@gmx.de>

- RocksDB 8.1.1
  * Compaction output file cutting logic now considers range
    tombstone start keys. For example, SST partitioner now may
    receive ParitionRequest for range tombstone start keys.
  * If the async_io ReadOption is specified for MultiGet or
    NewIterator on a platform that doesn't support IO uring, the
    option is ignored and synchronous IO is used.
  * Add support for SecondaryCache with HyperClockCache
  * New statistics and performance counters
  * bug fixes
