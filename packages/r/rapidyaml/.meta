  <title>Rapid YAML</title>
  <description>Or ryml, for short. ryml is a C++ library to parse and emit YAML, and do it fast, on everything from x64 to bare-metal chips without operating system. (If you are looking to use your programs with a YAML tree as a configuration tree with override facilities, take a look at c4conf).</description>
