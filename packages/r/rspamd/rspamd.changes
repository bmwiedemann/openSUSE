  can be removed in 1.8.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 24 22:39:44 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 1.8.0
  The most important features and fixes
  - New selectors framework
    This framework allows to combine and process different data
    extracted from messages and use that in different plugins, such
    as multimap, reputation or ratelimits. It is also possible to
    use data extracted in Rspamd regular expressions.
  - Coroutines API support in Lua
    Now you can write code in a usual imperative manner but you
    still will not block any other tasks. Each potentially blocking
    operation creates a yielding-point. In turn, this means the
    code is suspended until the operation is done (just like
    blocking) and resumes only when there is some result.
    Meanwhile, other tasks are processed as usual.
  - Clickhouse optimization
    Rspamd now uses a flat table to optimize ClickHouse SQL
    requests. In fact, joins are not recommended by the ClickHouse
    developers as multiple joins have proven to be slow. Hence,
    Rspamd has moved all data to a single table. Schema migration
    is done automatically, however, please read the migration notes
    in case of any doubts. Old data is not migrated nor deleted
    automatically.
    There is now optional data retention support in the ClickHouse
    module. You can set retention policies for the data stored in
    Clickhouse to conform different regulations (e.g. GDPR).
  - Unicode processing improvements
    Rspamd now normalizes all unicode data using NFKC schema prior
    to processing. This helps to prevent ‚Äúglyph‚Äù attacks used by
    some spammers nowadays. Unicode conversion has also been
    improved to continue on bad symbols instead of giving up and
    working with raw data.
  - Language detection improvements
    We have reworked the language detector to use stop-words and
    rely on unicode glyphs more extensively. As the result of this
    work, the speed of language detection has been increased
    significantly (by 10 times in some cases). The preciseness of
    the detection has also been improved.
  - Fixed various bugs in sesssions handling
    We have located and fixed various hidden issues caused by async
    rules chaining. It might cause inconsistencies in the
    dependencies processing, crashes in rare cases and other ‚Äúbad
    things‚Äù.
  - Various Web Interface improvements and fixes
    There are multiple improvements and fixes in the Web Interface.
    In particular, the issues with cluster support and aggregation
    have been addressed.

  For all the fixes see
  https://rspamd.com/announce/2018/09/24/rspamd-1.8.0.html

- split out rspamc and rspamadm into a rspamd-client package.
  the main package will still require it so nothing would change
  from this perspective.

  This allows administration and training from other machines
  without installing the whole stack.
