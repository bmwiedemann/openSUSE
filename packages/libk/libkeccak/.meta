  <title>Keccak-family hashing library, including SHA-3</title>
  <description>libkeccak is a bit-oriented lanewise implementation of the Keccak-
family with support for extend output size, state marshalling,
algorithm tuning with implicit parameters, secure erasure of
sensitive data, and HMAC.

A subset of Keccak was specified by NIST as SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3).
