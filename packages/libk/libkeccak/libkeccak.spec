%description
libkeccak is a bit-oriented lanewise implementation of the Keccak
family with support for extend output size, state marshalling,
algorithm tuning with implicit parameters, secure erasure of
sensitive data, and HMAC.

A subset of Keccak was specified by NIST as SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3).
