    <comment>- update to 1.2.0:
 * enhancement: kcapi-hasher: add madvise and 64 bit support by Brandur Simonsen
 * fix: fix clang warnding in KDF implementation by Khem Raj
 * fix: fix inverted logic in kcapi-main test logic reported by Ondrej Mosnáček
 * fix: return error when iteration count is zero for PBKDF as reported by
   Guido Vranken
 * enhancement: add function kcapi_cipher_stream_update_last to indicate the
   last block of a symmetric cipher stream operation
 * disable XTS multithreaded tests as it triggers a race discussed in
   https://github.com/smuellerDD/libkcapi/issues/92. The conclusion is
   the following: xts(aes) doesn't support chaining requests like for other
   ciphers such as CBC (at least as implemented in the kernel Crypto API).
   That can be seen in `crypto/testmgr.h` - the ciphers that are expected to
   return IVs usable for chaining have the `.iv_out` entries filled in in their
   test vectors (and those that don't support it do not). One can see that only
   CTR and CBC test vectors have them, not XTS.
   Looking again at how XTS is defined, it seems one could implement
   transparent chaining by simply decrypting the final tweak using the tweak
   key and return it as the output IV... but I believe this has never been
   mandated nor implemented in the Crypto API (likely because of the overhead
   of the final tweak decryption, which would be pointless if you're not going
   to use the output IV - and there is currently no way to signal to the driver
   that you are going to need it).
 * disable AIO parallel tests due to undefined behavior (forwarded request 830821 from dirkmueller)</comment>

- Update to version 1.4.0
  * fix: ensure that LTO is supported (by Simo Sorce)
  * fix: add LTO regression testing (by Ondrej Mosnacek)
  * enhancement: add sm3sum, sm3hmac tools, add APIs kcapi_md_sm3, kcapi_md_hmac_sm3
  * enhancement: add SM4 convenience functions
  * fix: support AEAD encryption of arbitrary size with kcapi-enc
- removed libkcapi-fix-lto.patch (upstream)

- use https url

- Update to version 1.3.1
  * fix: fix -Wconversion warnings (by Ondrej Mosnacek)
  * fix: fix bad data types in _kcapi_common_send_meta (by Ondrej Mosnacek)
  * fix: Version symbols to maintain ABI compatibility (by Simo Sorce)
  * fix: disable io_getevents on systems that do not support it (by Khem Raj)
  * fix: remove prctl PR_SET_DUMPABLE to allow library to be debugged - as the
    library does not store any sensitive data in data structures it owns, such
    security precautions may not be necessary considering the benefit of
    allowing regular debugging
  * fix: ensure that sendmsg is always used as fallback when vmsplice cannot be
    used
  * enhancement: add kcapi_set_maxsplicesize and kcapi_get_maxsplicesize
  * enhancement: the variable types are changed from int32_t to ssize_t and
    from uint32_t to size_t to match common POSIX and Linux APIs
- Added libkcapi-fix-lto.patch</comment>
