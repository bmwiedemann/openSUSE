          - `Git`
          - `find in files`
          - `Language Server Plugin` over SSH
          - Diff plugin
      - UI updates
      - Added new tab control style: `FIREFOX` (screenshot below)
      - Build tab output rewritten: it now honours the terminal colours
      - Git plugin log view re-written and it now uses the same control as the build output, which honours the terminal colours

      - Project Settings: Use `append` by default for PCH flags option (*rlbxku1r*)
      - `clangd` + `clang-format` that comes with CodeLite for macOS and Windows are now using version `12.0.0`
      - File System Workspace: support multi-line commands in the build pages
      - When using the file system workspace, export a special enviroment variable `CXX_INCLUDE_PATHS` this variable contains a list of compiler search paths for header files, separated by `;` is useful when using `CMake` + `MinGW` + `file system workspace` under windows, where the `CMAKE_EXPORTS_COMPILE_COMMANDS` does not include the compiler search paths, which breaks `clangd` code completion

      - When importing themes with true black colour as their background colour, soften the it a bit
      - git plugin: better support for remote repository where the workspace is not set in the root folder of the workspace

      - New: added an option to highlight the current line number (in the line number margin)
      - C++ workspace dialog updated
      - `MINIMAL` and `DEFAULT` tab design refreshed
      - Build tab: added `Copy all` context menu entry
      - Find bar: the search logic re-written from scratch. With the old search, replacing 1000+ string instances using `Replace All` on a file with size of 6MB took roughly 45 seconds (On Windows machine, 32GB memory and 24 cores)    With the new code (which performs in-buffer replacement where it can) this takes roughly 300ms!
      - CodeLite logo updated

      - The 'best project settings' for certain builders can be obtained from the builder object. (*rlbxku1r*)
      - Auto-detect and set the output file extension (exe, lib, dll, a, so, dylib) for given project type. (*rlbxku1r*)
      - Colour `.toml` files as `INI` files ("properties")
      - Remoty: re-wrote the "Open workspace" dialog
      - SFTP browser dialog: if the path in the "Browse" entry is a file path, remove the file name and just open the folder
      - Add option to enable spell checking on wxTextCtrl from within wxCrafter (*iwbnwif*)
      - [Allow the user the change the active project from the menu (Workspace -> Set active project) or from the "Goto Anything" dialog (`Ctrl-Shift-P`)][4]
      - Language Server Protcol: implemented `Hover` request message
      - Language Server Protocol: implemented `Find references`. This feature will only be shown for Language Servers that support it like
          - `clangd`
          - `python-lsp`
          - `typescript-language-server`
          - `rust-analyzer`
      - The old code completion was removed from CodeLite (`codelite_indexer`), instead, we now provide our own C++ language server named `ctagsd` which a re-written from scratch code completion engine with excellent C++11/14 features
      - Line margin: highlight the current line, in addition this feature performance is now in `O(1)` and is not depend on the size of the opened file

      - wxCrafter: by default, generate `.hpp` files instead of `.h`
      - Remoty plugin: the way it launches language servers on the remote machine has changed. [See the docs for more details][6]
      - Improved file syntax using the shebang
      - Make the `Preferences` dialog more native to the host OS
      - Added an option to enable/disable the newly added feature of highligting the current line number. This should allow CodeLite running on older machines with bad graphics cards to run smoother
      - Improved type info tooltips (`ctagsd`)
      - Find Bar: use the same text control as the main editor instead of `wxTextCtrl`

    * File System Workspace: added the ability to exclude folders
      from the workspace. The folders are still visible, but they 
      will be excluded in * various operations, like Find In Files,
      Parsing etc

    * Renamed default build system from "CodeLite Make 
      Generator" -> "CodeLite Makefile Generator"
    * Added new Build System: CodeLite Makefile 
      Generator - UNIX - which generates UNIX compatible Makefiles, 
      even when on Windows (useful for cygwin / MSYS environments)
    * contextual highlight is no longer done using the SQLite 
      symbol database, as a result it should feel much more faster
    * Git reset: added a WARNING icon to the dialog + Cancel 
      button (which is now the new default)
    * Navigation bar now also displays "git blame" info 
      (author + commit hash + date) for the current line
    * UI updated to the Preferfences and Colour and fonts dialog
    * Refined dark theme support by removing various border which
      might look bright on dark theme
    * Language Server Plugin: you can now mark an LSP as SSH. This 
      will execute it on a remote machine instead (you still need 
      to make sure that it is installed on the remote machine)

      state the account + binary to debug and CodeLite will do the 
      rest
    * Language Server Plugin: opening a header file will now 
      automatically send the implementation file (cpp) to the active
      LSP for parsing. This way we make sure that goto-definition 
      will work immediately
    * Implemented a proper "switch to workspace" functionality. 
      It is now possible to call Open Workspace without the need 
      to the currently opened one. In addition, CodeLite will now 
      display a dialog that will list the last opened workspaces
    * PHP Find In Files: 1. Starting find-in-files from the context
      menu will force the find-in-files dialog to use the selected 
      dialogs from the tree view *this are transient paths and will 
      not be remembered* 2. Starting find-in-files from any other 
      way, will use the last used settings
    * Fixed: find in files offset is broken when non ASCII text is 
      presented in the editor 
- Rebase fix_compilation_JSON_wxWidgets.patch.

Wed Nov 25 19:22:34 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 14.0.2.
  * Increased the external tools limit from 10 -> 20

    of the source tree build. The entire build artifacts are placed
    in a single folder under the workspace path, this is similar to
    CMake
  * New workspace type introduced: The File System Workspace 
    see: https://wiki.codelite.org/pmwiki.php/Main/FileSystemWorkspace
  * Improved startup time by reducing the number of syscalls 
    significantly
