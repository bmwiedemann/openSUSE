    * Find In Files: should now load faster on Windows
    * Fixed: File System Workspace: keep the last 'File mask' 
      value used
    * Language Server Protocol: Initialized notification to the 
      server
    * Prevent hangs under Wayland when changing Workspace View 
      tabs
    * Properly save/load workspace breakpoints and avoid mixing 
      between two different workspaces breakpoints
    * File System Workspace: when 'remote development' is enabled,
      do not attempt to remote save a file that is not part of our
      source tree or was opened by the SFTP plugin
    * Fixed: crash when switching between themes
    * gdb does not display local variables properly
    * Creating a new file from the context menu in the File System
      Workspace - does not add it to git or svn
    * Outline: honour the general background theme colour
    * Bootstrap wizard: if the user select Default profile, load 
      all plugins
    * Fixed crash in codelite-terminal when executed with 
      --command
    * Fixed: SFTP overrides file attributes if these were modified
      after the file was loaded into CodeLite
    * LLDB settings: keep the full path for debugserver
    * Fixed: cppcheck is now working from the context menu again
    * File System Workspace: set the default working directory to
      the workspace folder
    * PHPdoc return value is not handled correctly 
  * Changes

    * By default, show minimal list of buttons in the toolbar when
      first time installing CodeLite
    * By default, enable minimal list of plugins (by profile type)
    * File System Workspace: split the settings into 2 different 
      files: a local and shared file. The content in the "local" 
      files is kept under .codelite/ directory in the workspace 
      folder and is not to be saved into git or any source control
      the * default .workspace file contains properties that should
      be shared
    * File System Workspace: added 'working directory' field
    * Language Server Protocol: optimized the traffic between 
      LSP <-> CodeLite by adding checksum checks before calling LSP
      to re-parse a file
    * Language Server Protocol: added support for implemented 
      'extDocument/documentSymbol' protocol message
    * PHP: update PHP xdebug UI view to fit the IDE look

    * File System Workspace: added an option to use remote build
    * Internal changes to how GDB communicate changes to CodeLite
    * Appearance: honor *system* dark themes
    * Language Server Protocol: install the user code completion 
      provided by clangd automatically
    * Creating or deleting a folder via the 'Explorer' view, will 
      automatically sync PHP workspace
    * file system workspace: extend the default file extensions to
      show with *.py, *.rb, *.php and *.php
    * python support: adjust method document style to match the 
      NumPy method as described here: 
      https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/
    * [PHP] Find functions in context when inserting PHPDoc
    * [PHP] Add return type to signature
    * [PHP] Add nullable type to signature in auto-complete
    * [PHP] Hint nullable and default values
    * [PHP] Handel parsing of by reference values in PHPDoc
    * [PHP] Allow parsing of nullable types from PHPDoc
    * [PHP] Handle parsing PHP 7.1 nullable types
    * [PHP] Handle common mistakes when parsing PHPDoc
    * [PHP] Add missing native types
    * [PHP] Group tags in generated PHPDoc
    * [PHP] Set return type to mixed when unspecified
    * Callgraph is no longer included in the default installer of
      CodeLite
    * File System Workspace: added the ability to exclude folders
      from the workspace. The folders are still visible, but they 
      will be excluded in * various operations, like Find In Files,
      Parsing etc
    * Full parsing of workspace is roughly 30% faster now
    * Renamed default build system from "CodeLite Make 
      Generator" -> "CodeLite Makefile Generator"
    * Added new Build System: CodeLite Makefile 
      Generator - UNIX - which generates UNIX compatible Makefiles, 
      even when on Windows (useful for cygwin / MSYS environments)
    * contextual highlight is no longer done using the SQLite 
      symbol database, as a result it should feel much more faster
    * Git reset: added a WARNING icon to the dialog + Cancel 
      button (which is now the new default)
    * Navigation bar now also displays "git blame" info 
      (author + commit hash + date) for the current line
    * UI updated to the Preferfences and Colour and fonts dialog
    * Refined dark theme support by removing various border which
      might look bright on dark theme
    * Language Server Plugin: you can now mark an LSP as SSH. This 
      will execute it on a remote machine instead (you still need 
      to make sure that it is installed on the remote machine)
    * Quick Debug: it is now possible to debug over SSH from. Just 
      state the account + binary to debug and CodeLite will do the 
      rest
    * Language Server Plugin: opening a header file will now 
      automatically send the implementation file (cpp) to the active
      LSP for parsing. This way we make sure that goto-definition 
      will work immediately
    * Implemented a proper "switch to workspace" functionality. 
      It is now possible to call Open Workspace without the need 
      to the currently opened one. In addition, CodeLite will now 
      display a dialog that will list the last opened workspaces
    * PHP Find In Files: 1. Starting find-in-files from the context
      menu will force the find-in-files dialog to use the selected 
      dialogs from the tree view *this are transient paths and will 
      not be remembered* 2. Starting find-in-files from any other 
      way, will use the last used settings
    * Fixed: find in files offset is broken when non ASCII text is 
      presented in the editor 
- Rebase fix_compilation_JSON_wxWidgets.patch.
