      - **Remoty plugin**: use the newly added `codelite-remote` interface which allows using various plugin on a remote machines:
          - `Git`
          - `find in files`
          - `Language Server Plugin` over SSH

      - Project Settings: Improve dirty settings detection (*rlbxku1r*)
      - Project Settings: Use `append` by default for PCH flags option (*rlbxku1r*)
      - `clangd` + `clang-format` that comes with CodeLite for macOS and Windows are now using version `12.0.0`
      - File System Workspace: support multi-line commands in the build pages
      - When using the file system workspace, export a special enviroment variable `CXX_INCLUDE_PATHS` this variable contains a list of compiler search paths for header files, separated by `;` is useful when using `CMake` + `MinGW` + `file system workspace` under windows, where the `CMAKE_EXPORTS_COMPILE_COMMANDS` does not include the compiler search paths, which breaks `clangd` code completion
      - GDB-MI output parser re-written to support custom file paths with unusual characters
      - VIM:Add some new commands (`~`, `o`, `O`) (mx)
      - When importing themes with true black colour as their background colour, soften the it a bit
      - git plugin: better support for remote repository where the workspace is not set in the root folder of the workspace
      - change the location of CodeLite temp folder into `/tmp/codelite/PID`. This should reduce the spam under the `/tmp` folder
      - Support drawing multiline text in the clTreeCtrl
      - Code completion entry tooltip: CodeLite now supports Markdown rendering
      - New project wizard: more fixes to avoid problems when using `MSYS2` compiler on Windows (*rlbxku1r*)

      - Colouring of semantic tokens is now done by the Language Server plugin
      - Updated the default themes that comes with CodeLite
      - C++ context menu: `Find Declaration` &amp; `Find Implementation` entries are now replaced withe single, intelligent `Find Symbol` entry
      - [Implemented: Feature request: &quot;Open resource&quot; dialog should support optional [:line[:column]] &quot;coordinates&quot;][3]
      - New: added an option to highlight the current line number (in the line number margin)
      - C++ workspace dialog updated
      - `MINIMAL` and `DEFAULT` tab design refreshed
      - Build tab: added `Copy all` context menu entry
      - Find bar: the search logic re-written from scratch. With the old search, replacing 1000+ string instances using `Replace All` on a file with size of 6MB took roughly 45 seconds (On Windows machine, 32GB memory and 24 cores)    With the new code (which performs in-buffer replacement where it can) this takes roughly 300ms!
      - CodeLite logo updated
      - C++ new class wizard: use `C++11` features (*rlbxku1r*)
      - C++ parser: fix parsing class with `final` (*rlbxku1r*)

          - accept `C++11` type alias
          - accept `C++11` `final` keyword
          - accept `C++11` `alignas` keyword
          - accept `C++11` `noexcept` keyword
          - Accept `C++17` nested namespace notation
          - Properly collect using aliases (e.g. `using std::shared_ptr;`)
      - Script language keywords updated to include: `local`, `function`, `exit` and `return`
      - Remoty: support for auto detection of: `pylsp` language server
      - SFTP: attempt to compare checksums before re-downloading file from remote server
      - Recognize `.ts` files types (`TypeScript`)
      - Code cleanup: removed all `tern` code completion code, use `typescript-language-server` instead
      - Added new language server tab to log LSP messages of type `logMessage`, `telemetry` and `showMessage`
      - File types: `patch` and `diff` are now properly identified by CodeLite
      - Better dark theme support for Linux built with `-DWITH_NATIVEBOOK=0`

      - Updated the colour themes
      - Source code formatter: added an option to disable the formatting engines

      - CodeFormatter: added basic JSON formatter
      - Handle various workspace files (`NodeJS`, `Docker`, `FSW`, `Rust`, `Remoty`) as `JSON` files
      - The 'best project settings' for certain builders can be obtained from the builder object. (*rlbxku1r*)
      - Auto-detect and set the output file extension (exe, lib, dll, a, so, dylib) for given project type. (*rlbxku1r*)
      - Colour `.toml` files as `INI` files (&quot;properties&quot;)
      - Remoty: re-wrote the &quot;Open workspace&quot; dialog
      - SFTP browser dialog: if the path in the &quot;Browse&quot; entry is a file path, remove the file name and just open the folder
      - Add option to enable spell checking on wxTextCtrl from within wxCrafter (*iwbnwif*)
      - [Allow the user the change the active project from the menu (Workspace -&gt; Set active project) or from the &quot;Goto Anything&quot; dialog (`Ctrl-Shift-P`)][4]
      - Language Server Protcol: implemented `Hover` request message
      - Language Server Protocol: implemented `Find references`. This feature will only be shown for Language Servers that support it like
          - `clangd`
          - `python-lsp`
          - `typescript-language-server`
          - `rust-analyzer`
      - The old code completion was removed from CodeLite (`codelite_indexer`), instead, we now provide our own C++ language server named `ctagsd` which a re-written from scratch code completion engine with excellent C++11/14 features
      - Line margin: highlight the current line, in addition this feature performance is now in `O(1)` and is not depend on the size of the opened file

      - We now provide wxCrafter standalone builds for Windows / GTK (experimental)
      - wxCrafter: allow to keep sizers are members
      - wxCrafter: fixed: crash when clicking on `Select virtual directory` while in standalone mode
      - wxCrafter: event handlers are now using the `wx3.0` syntax of `Bind()`/`Unbind()` instead of `Connect()`/`Disconnect()`
      - wxCrafter: by default, generate `.hpp` files instead of `.h`
      - Remoty plugin: the way it launches language servers on the remote machine has changed. [See the docs for more details][6]
      - Improved file syntax using the shebang
      - Make the `Preferences` dialog more native to the host OS
      - Added an option to enable/disable the newly added feature of highligting the current line number. This should allow CodeLite running on older machines with bad graphics cards to run smoother
      - Improved type info tooltips (`ctagsd`)
      - Find Bar: use the same text control as the main editor instead of `wxTextCtrl`
