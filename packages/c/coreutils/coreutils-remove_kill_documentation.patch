-
-@pindex kill
-@cindex send a signal to processes
-
-The @command{kill} command sends a signal to processes, causing them
-to terminate or otherwise act upon receiving the signal in some way.
-Alternatively, it lists information about signals.  Synopses:
-
-@example
-kill [-s @var{signal} | --signal @var{signal} | -@var{signal}] @var{pid}@dots{}
-kill [-l | --list | -t | --table] [@var{signal}]@dots{}
-@end example
-
-@mayConflictWithShellBuiltIn{kill}
-
-The first form of the @command{kill} command sends a signal to all
-@var{pid} arguments.  The default signal to send if none is specified
-is @samp{TERM}@.  The special signal number @samp{0} does not denote a
-valid signal, but can be used to test whether the @var{pid} arguments
-specify processes to which a signal could be sent.
-
-If @var{pid} is positive, the signal is sent to the process with the
-process ID @var{pid}.  If @var{pid} is zero, the signal is sent to all
-processes in the process group of the current process.  If @var{pid}
-is @minus{}1, the signal is sent to all processes for which the user has
-permission to send a signal.  If @var{pid} is less than @minus{}1, the signal
-is sent to all processes in the process group that equals the absolute
-value of @var{pid}.
-
-If @var{pid} is not positive, a system-dependent set of system
-processes is excluded from the list of processes to which the signal
-is sent.
-
-If a negative @var{pid} argument is desired as the first one, it
-should be preceded by @option{--}.  However, as a common extension to
-POSIX, @option{--} is not required with @samp{kill
--@var{signal} -@var{pid}}.  The following commands are equivalent:
-
-@example
-kill -15 -1
-kill -TERM -1
-kill -s TERM -- -1
-kill -- -1
-@end example
-
-The first form of the @command{kill} command succeeds if every @var{pid}
-argument specifies at least one process that the signal was sent to.
-
-The second form of the @command{kill} command lists signal information.
-Either the @option{-l} or @option{--list} option, or the @option{-t}
-or @option{--table} option must be specified.  Without any
-@var{signal} argument, all supported signals are listed.  The output
-of @option{-l} or @option{--list} is a list of the signal names, one
-per line; if @var{signal} is already a name, the signal number is
-printed instead.  The output of @option{-t} or @option{--table} is a
-table of signal numbers, names, and descriptions.  This form of the
-@command{kill} command succeeds if all @var{signal} arguments are valid
-and if there is no output error.
-
-The @command{kill} command also supports the @option{--help} and
-@option{--version} options.  @xref{Common options}.
-
-A @var{signal} may be a signal name like @samp{HUP}, or a signal
-number like @samp{1}, or an exit status of a process terminated by the
-signal.  A signal name can be given in canonical form or prefixed by
-@samp{SIG}@.  The case of the letters is ignored, except for the
-@option{-@var{signal}} option which must use upper case to avoid
-ambiguity with lower case option letters.
-@xref{Signal specifications}, for a list of supported
-signal names and numbers.
