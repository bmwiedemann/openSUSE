While uid_t and gid_t are both unsigned, the values (uid_t) -1 and
(gid_t) -1 are reserved.  A uid or gid argument of -1 to the chown(2)
system call means to leave the uid/gid unchanged.  Catch this case
so that trying to set a uid or gid to -1 will result in an error.

Test cases:

  chown 4294967295 file
  chown :4294967295 file
  chgrp 4294967295 file
