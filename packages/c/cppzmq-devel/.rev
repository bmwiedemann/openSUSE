    <comment>- Update to version 4.6.0
  * New generic algorithms for sending and receiving multipart messages
  * New to_string and to_string_view member functions in message_t
  * Less surprising behaviour when move assigning socket_t and context_t
  * Return types for send and recv moved into zmq namespace
  * Checks for 32/64bit-ness in cppzmqConfigVersion.cmake removed
  * fixed issues when compiling with C++11
  * fixed and improved cmake build (in and out of source builds, libzmq discovery, fallback to pkg-config and more)
  * updated README.md with clear design goals, supported platforms
  * official CI support for Linux, MacOS and Windows
  * unit tests infrastructure
  * test code coverage brought to 77%
  * updated code style (more details in .clang-format)
  * socket_t:
    + added support for draft ZMQ_SERVER and ZMQ_CLIENT sockets
    + added support for draft ZMQ_RADIO and ZMQ_DISH sockets
  * poller_t:
    + poller_t became thin abstraction layer on zmq_poller_*
    + functionality with std::function handlers split and moved to a new active_poller_t in zmq_addon.hpp
    + simpler and safer implementation
    + made non-copyable, but properly movable
    + more consistent and robust error handling
    + event type part of handler definition
    + fixed a segfault issue when modifying poller_t from a handler
    + added empty method indicating presence of registered sockets
  * context_t:
    + added methods for context options: setctxopt(int option_, int optval_) and int getctxopt(int option_)
  * message_t:
    + easier construction from iterable type e.g. std::string, std::array
    + added != and == operators and equals method marked as deprecated</comment>
