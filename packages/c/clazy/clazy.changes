Tue Oct 15 07:41:03 UTC 2019 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Update to 1.6:
  * New Checks:
    - heap-allocated-small-trivial-type
    - signal-with-return-value
    - qproperty-type-mismatch, contributed by Jean-Michaël Celerier
  * Removed level3. Moved all level3 checks to manual level.
  * Fixed regressions with LLVM 9.0
  * Minimum LLVM was bumped to 5.0
  * Fixit infrastructure was overhauled
  * Clazy no longer rewrites files directly, to avoid races
    when parallel invocations change the same header.
  * Clazy now exports a yaml file with the replacements, to be
    applied with clang-apply-replacements.
  * The way to enable code rewrite is now: -Xclang -plugin-arg-clazy
    -Xclang export-fixes for clang or -export-fixes=somefile.yaml for clazy-standalone
  * All other fixit arguments and fixit env variables were removed
- Update cmake-clang-cpp.patch to make clazy build with both clang 8 and 9.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 28 18:38:25 UTC 2019 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Add cmake-clang-cpp.patch: fix build with LLVM 9.
- Replace outdated llvm-clang-devel dependency by clang-devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 16 09:19:04 UTC 2019 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Remove workarounds for older openSUSE versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  1 10:20:52 UTC 2019 - Wolfgang Bauer <wbauer@tmo.at>

- Update to 1.5
  * New Checks:
    ifndef-define-typo
    lowercase-qml-type-name
    qrequiredresult-candidates
  * New Fixits:
    range-loop now supports adding missing refs or const-ref
    range-loop now supports adding qAsConst()
    function-args-by-ref now adding missing refs or const-ref (experimental)
    Introduced CLAZY_FIXIT_SUFFIX env variable
  * Removed support for the obscure -DCLAZY_BUILD_UTILS_LIB to
    simplify the CMakeLists.txt
  * Renamed the clazy plugin from ClangLazy.so to ClazyPlugin.so
  * fully-qualified-moc-types now warns for slot/invokable return
    values too. They need to be fully qualified for QML.
  * Fixed a crash (clang assert) in raw-environment-function
- BuildRequire ncurses-devel instead of pkgconfig(ncurses) on Leap
  42.3 to fix build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 25 20:30:06 UTC 2018 - Wolfgang Bauer <wbauer@tmo.at>

- Update to 1.4
  * New Checks:
    connect-by-name
    skipped-base-class
    qstring-varargs
    fully-qualified-moc-types
    qt-keywords, with fixit included
    qhash-with-char-pointer-key
    wrong-qevent-cast
    static-pmf
    raw-environment-function
    empty-qstringliteral
  * auto-unexpected-qstringbuilder now also warns for lambdas
    returning QStringBuilder
  * performance optimizations
  * Added -header-filter=<regex> option to clazy-standalone. Only
    headers matching the regexp will have warnings, besides the
    .cpp file from the translation unit, which is never filtered
    out.
  * Added -ignore-dirs=<regex> option to clazy-standalone, and its
    CLAZY_IGNORE_DIRS env variable equivalent.
  * Added CLAZY_HEADER_FILTER env variable which adds above
    functionality to both clazy and clazy-standalone
  * unused-non-trivial-variable got
    unused-non-trivial-variable-no-whitelist option
  * unused-non-trivial-variable got user-blacklist and
    user-whitelist support
  * container-inside-loop is now a manual check instead of level2
  * HiddenLevel was renamed to ManualLevel
  * connect-3arg-lambda now warns when passing a lambda to
    QTimer::singleShot() or QMenu::addAction() without a context
    object
  * old-style-connect warns for QMenu::addAction() and
    QMessageBox::open() too now
