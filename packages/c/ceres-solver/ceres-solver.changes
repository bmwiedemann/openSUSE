- Update to version 2.1.0.
  * New Features:
    + Support for CUDA based dense solvers - DENSE_QR,
      DENSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY & DENSE_SCHUR (Joydeep Biswas,
      Sameer Agarwal)
    + Manifold is the new LocalParameterization. Version 2.1 is
      the transition release where users can use both
      LocalParameterization as well as Manifold objects as they
      transition from the former to the latter.
      LocalParameterization will be removed in version 2.2.
      There should be no numerical change to the results as a
      result of this change. (Sameer Agarwal, Johannes Beck,
      Sergiu Deitsch)
    + A number of changes to Jet s (Sergiu Deitsch):
      - Jet gained support for, copysign, fma (fused multiply-add),
        midpoint (C++20 and above), lerp (C++20 and above),
        3-argument hypot (C++17 and above), log10, log1p, exp1m,
        norm (squared norm).
      - Quiet floating-point comparison: isless, isgreater,
        islessgreater, islessequal, isgreaterequal, isunordered,
        signbit, fdim
      - Categorization and comparison operations are applied
        exclusively and consistently to the scalar part of a
        Jet now: isnan, isinf, isnormal, isfinite, fpclassify
        (new), fmin, fmax
      - It is now possible to safely compare a Jet against a
        scalar (or literal) without constructing a Jet first
        (even if it’s nested)
        This enables interaction with various arithmetic functions
        that expect a scalar like instance, such as
        boost::math::pow<-N> for reciprocal computation.
    + Add NumericDiffFirstOrderFunction (Sameer Agarwal)
  * Backward Incompatible API Changes:
    + LocalParameterization is deprecated. It will be removed
      in version 2.2. Use Manifold instead.
    + Classification functions like IsFinite are deprecated.
      Use the C++11 functions (isfinite, isnan etc) going
      forward. However to maintain consistent behaviour with
      comparison operators, these functions only inspect the
      scalar part of the Jet.
  * Many Bug Fixes & Minor Changes, for details, see

Sat Jan 16 18:24:07 UTC 2021 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 2.0.0.
  * C++ threading based multi-threading support.
  * Problem::AddResidualBlock(), SizedFunction, AutoDiffCostFunction,
    NumericDiffCostFunction support an arbitrary number of parameter 
    blocks using variadic templates 
  * Significantly faster AutoDiff 
  * Mixed precision solves when using SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY. 
  * LocalParameterization objects can have a zero sized tangent 
    size, which effectively makes the parameter block constant. 
    In particular, this allows for a SubsetParameterization that 
    holds all the coordinates of a parameter block constant.
  * Visibility based preconditioning now works with Eigen and CXSparse. 
  * Added Problem::EvaluateResidualBlock() and 
    Problem::EvaluateResidualBlockAssumingParametersUnchanged(). 
  * GradientChecker now uses RIDDERS method for more accurate 
    numerical derivatives.
  * Covariance computation uses a faster SVD algorithm 
  * A new local parameterization for lines
  * A new (SUBSET) preconditioner for problems with general sparsity. 
  * Faster Schur elimination using faster custom BLAS routines for 
    small matrices.
  * Automatic differentiation for FirstOrderFunction in the form of
    AutoDiffFirstOrderFunction. 
  * TinySolverAutoDiffFunction now supports dynamic number of 
    residuals just like AutoDiffCostFunction.
  * Backward Incompatible API Changes
    * EvaluationCallback has been moved from Solver::Options to 
      Problem::Options for a more correct API.
    * Removed Android.mk based build.
    * Solver::Options::num_linear_solver_threads is no more.
  * Several other moinor fixes and changes

- Use a _service file for download and compression
- Update to version 1.14.0
  * New EvaluationCallback API. (Keir Mierle)
  * TBB based threading (Yury Prokazov & Mike Vitus)
  * C++11 threads based threading (Mike Vitus)
  * A ceres::Context object to cache and keep track of global state.

- Update to version 1.13.0
  * LineSearchMinimizer and GradientProblemSolver are up to 2x faster
    due to fewer function evaluations. (Sameer Agarwal)
  * SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY is significantly faster because Ceres now
    computes the normal equations exploiting the static block sparsity
    structure. (Cheng Wang & Sameer Agarwal)
