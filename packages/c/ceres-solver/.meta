    Ceres Solver is an open source C++ library for modeling and solving large,
    complicated optimization problems. It can be used to solve Non-linear
    Least Squares problems with bounds constraints and general unconstrained
    optimization problems. It is a mature, feature rich, and performant
    library that has been used in production at Google since 2010.
