%description
Ksenia Erulevich, designer of the Alice typeface, was inspired by Lewis
Carrolâ€™s novel and decided to make a typeface that will be suitable for
typesetting that book.

It came out eclectic and quaint, old-fashioned, having widened
proportions, open aperture, and soft rounded features; perfect for long
meditative text-setting and headlines.
