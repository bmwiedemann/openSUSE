%description
Cecilia is a graphic user interface for the sound synthesis and sound
processing package CSound. Cecilia enables the user to build very
quickly graphic interfaces with sliders and curves to control CSound
instruments. It is also an editor to CSound with syntax highlighting
and a built-in reference. It is also a great tool to explore the parameters
of a new opcode in an interactive and intuitive way.

Cecilia uses the pyo audio engine created for the Python programming language.

Cecilia was designed by and for musicians and sound designers. All
the traditional sound processing devices are included such as EQs,
compressors and delays adapted for the most simple applications and
the wildest imaginable sonic contortions.
