- Update to 3.2.1
   - fixed problem with IS_FIXED_SIZE macro for cubic elements
   - added check for open file to routines that don't take
     a file number (suggestion from Marc Poinet)
   - added HTMLHelp interface to cmake scripts
   - added AdditionalFamilyName to UserDefinedData
   - fixed compiler complaint about comparison between int and enum
   - added routines to set MPI communicator for parallel I/O
   - updated CMake scripts to work within other scripts (remove conflicts)
   - updates to some cgnstools utility conversion routines
   - fixes and updates to tests and cgnscheck
   - updates to support CG_FILE_ADF2 (2.5 compatibility)
   - fix for point set subregions
- Update to  3.2
   - full integration of parallel I/O using HDF5 with MPI
   - implemented CPEX 0033 and 0034
   - compression (rewriting) of file to remove unused space is no
     longer automatically done, since may interfere with parallel I/O.
     Added cgnscompress program to tools to do this afterwards.
   - removed cgnsversion program from tools since support was getting
     out of hand (N squared problem with versions).
   - added routines to convert to and from AFLR3, FAST, and TetGen
   - implemented cubic elements (CPEX 0036)
   - CGNStools documentation no longer included with source.
     The NASA Glenn website (or local copy) is now used instead.
- Update to 3.1.4-2
   - fixes to cmake scripts for Fortran
   - added check for open file to routines that don't take
     a file number (suggestion from Marc Poinet)
   - CGNStools documentation no longer included with source.
     The NASA Glenn website (or local copy) is now used instead.
   - save window size for cgnsview
   - fix to computing path lists in CMake script
- Update to 3.1.4
   - added some const definitions to library
   - moved unlink of filename when using CG_MODE_WRITE on open to cgio
   - fixed goto for FamilyBCDataset for UserData, .etc
   - added cg_get_cgio_f and cg_root_id_f Fortran routines
   - fixed cmake and configure scripts to allow MPI with HDF5 and
     fixed bugs in those scripts
   - updated CGNSplot to handle all element types and 1-d and 2-d cases
   - fixes to cgnscheck
   - cleaned up some compiler warnings
   - added cgnsBuild.defs Makefile include to installation
   - removed unneeded tools directory from cgnstools
   - cgnstools no longer built automatically - need to set configure flag
   - allow CellCenter for BCs
   - added cg_precision and cg_precision_f functions to get integer
     size used to create the file (32 or 64)
