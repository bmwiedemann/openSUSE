  <title>CFD General Notation System</title>
  <description>The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) provides a general, portable, and extensible standard for the storage and retrieval of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis data. It consists of a collection of conventions, and free and open software implementing those conventions. It is self-descriptive, machine-independent, well-documented, and administered by an international steering committee. It is also an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

The system consists of two parts: (1) a standard format for recording the data, and (2) software that reads, writes, and modifies data in that format.  The format is a conceptual entity established by the documentation; the software is a physical product supplied to enable developers to access and produce data recorded in that format.

The CGNS system is designed to facilitate the exchange of data between sites and applications, and to help stabilize the archiving of aerodynamic data.  The data are stored in a compact, binary format and are accessible through a complete and extensible library of functions.  The API (Application Program Interface) is platform independent and can be easily implemented in C, C++, Fortran and Fortran90 applications.  </description>
