  <title>Transport-agnostic network filesystem</title>
  <description>ccgfs is a transport-agnostic filesystem. Common transport modes are
&quot;pull&quot; and &quot;push&quot;, the latter of which makes it possible to export a
filesystem located in a LAN to a DMZ host without needing to allow
connections from the DMZ as would be the case with the pull model.
Any transport can be used, e.g. ssh for encryption.
