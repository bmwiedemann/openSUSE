Thu Mar 24 22:56:21 UTC 2022 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net> 

- Update to version 8.15.1.
  * Fixes an inconsistency when using module subtyping with
    inductive types.
  * Speeds up CoqIDE on large files.
  * Fixes a bug where `coqc -vok` was not creating a .vok file.
  * Fixes a regression in `cbn`.
  * Improves usability of schemes with `elim foo using scheme with
    (P0 := ...)` (the `P0` name was not accessible in 8.15.0).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 15 18:03:24 UTC 2022 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.15.0.
  * The `apply with` tactic no longer renames arguments unless
    the compatibility flag `Apply With Renaming` is set.
  * Improvements to the `auto` tactic family, fixing `Hint Unfold`
    behavior, and generalizing the use of discrimination nets.
  * The `typeclasses eauto` tactic has a new `best_effort` option
    allowing it to return partial solutions to a proof search
    problem, depending on the mode declarations associated to each
    constraint. This mode is used by typeclass resolution during
    type inference to provide more precise error messages.
  * Many commands and options were deprecated or removed after
    deprecation and more consistently support locality attributes.
  * The `Import` command is extended with `import_categories` to
    select the components of a module to import or not, including
    features such as hints, coercions, and notations.
  * A visual Ltac debugger is now available in CoqIDE.
  * For more details, see refman/changes.html in coq-doc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 12 20:11:15 UTC 2021 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.14.1.
  * Fixed the implementation of persistent arrays used by the VM
    and native compute so that it uses a uniform representation.
    Previously, storing primitive floats inside primitive arrays
    could cause memory corruption.
  * Fixed missing registration of universe constraints in Module
    Type elaboration.
  * Made `abstract` more robust with respect to Ltac `constr`
    bindings containing existential variables.
  * Correct support of trailing `let` by tactic `specialize`.
  * Fixed an anomaly with `Extraction Conservative Types` when
    extracting pattern-matching on singleton types.
  * Regular error instead of an anomaly when calling `Separate
    Extraction` in a module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 20 21:31:46 UTC 2021 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.14.0.
  * The internal representation of match has changed to a more
    space-efficient and cleaner structure, allowing the fix of a
    completeness issue with cumulative inductive types in the type-
    checker. The internal representation is now closer to the user-
    level view of match, where the argument context of branches and
    the inductive binders in and as do not carry type annotations.
  * A new coqnative binary performs separate native compilation of
    libraries, starting from a .vo file. It is supported by
    coq_makefile.
  * Improvements to typeclasses and canonical structure resolution,
    allowing more terms to be considered as classes or keys.
  * More control over notations declarations and support for
    primitive types in string and number notations.
  * Removal of deprecated tactics, notably omega, which has been
    replaced by a greatly improved lia, along with many bug fixes.
  * New Ltac2 APIs for interaction with Ltac1, manipulation of
    inductive types and printing.
  * Many changes and additions to the standard library in the
    numbers, vectors and lists libraries. A new signed primitive
    integers library Sint63 is available in addition to the
    unsigned Uint63 library.
  * For more details, see refman/changes.html in coq-doc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  4 12:51:43 UTC 2021 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Add documentation package based on github.com/coq/doc until we
  can build the documentation directly in OBS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 12 21:17:33 UTC 2021 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.13.2.
  * Fix crash when using vm_compute on an irreducible PArray.set.
  * Fix crash when loading .vo files containing a vm_compute
    normalized primitive array.
  * Fix Ltac2.Array.init computational complexity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 25 21:50:43 UTC 2021 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.13.1.
  * Fix arities of VM opcodes for some floating-point operations
    that could cause memory corruption.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  7 22:48:00 UTC 2021 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.13.0.
  * Introduction of primitive persistent arrays in the core
    language, implemented using imperative persistent arrays.
  * Introduction of definitional proof irrelevance for the equality
    type defined in the SProp sort.
  * Cumulative record and inductive type declarations can now
    specify the variance of their universes.
  * Various bugfixes and uniformization of behavior with respect to
    the use of implicit arguments and the handling of existential
    variables in declarations, unification and tactics.
  * New warning for unused variables in catch-all match branches
    that match multiple distinct patterns.
  * New warning for Hint commands outside sections without a
    locality attribute, whose goal is to eventually remove the
    fragile default behavior of importing hints only when using
    Require. The recommended fix is to declare hints as export,
    instead of the current default global, meaning that they are
    imported through Require Import only, not Require.
  * General support for boolean attributes.
  * Many improvements to the handling of notations, including
    number notations, recursive notations and notations with
    bindings. A new algorithm chooses the most precise notation
    available to print an expression, which might introduce changes
    in printing behavior.
  * Tactic improvements in lia and its zify preprocessing step,
    now supporting reasoning on boolean operators such as Z.leb and
    supporting primitive integers Int63.
  * Typing flags can now be specified per-constant / inductive.
  * Improvements to the reference manual including updated syntax
    descriptions that match Coq's grammar in several chapters, and
    splitting parts of the tactics chapter to independent sections.
- Add build flag to turn off building of the IDE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 13 15:55:58 UTC 2020 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.12.2. Fixes two impacting 8.12 regressions:
  * Fixed a regression causing notations mentioning a coercion to
    be ignored.
  * Fixed a regression causing incomplete inference of implicit
    arguments in exists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 17 22:09:12 UTC 2020 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.12.1. This contains mostly bug fixes:
  * Polymorphic side-effects inside monomorphic definitions were
    incorrectly handled as not inlined. This allowed deriving an
    inconsistency.
  * Regression in error reporting after SSReflect's case tactic.
    A generic error message "Could not fill dependent hole in
    apply" was reported for any error following case or elim.
  * Several bugs with Search.
  * The details environment introduced in coqdoc in Coq 8.12 can
    now be used as advertised in the reference manual.
  * View menu "Display parentheses" introduced in CoqIDE in
    Coq 8.12 now works correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 20 08:33:34 UTC 2020 - Martin Li≈°ka <mliska@suse.cz>

- Use memoryperjob constraint instead of %limit_build macro.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 21:48:40 UTC 2020 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.12.0.
  * New binder notation for non-maximal implicit arguments using []
    allowing to set and see the implicit status of arguments
    immediately.
  * New notation Inductive "I A | x : s := ..." to distinguish the
    uniform from the non-uniform parameters in inductive
    definitions.
  * More robust and expressive treatment of implicit inductive
    parameters in inductive declarations.
  * Improvements in the treatment of implicit arguments and
    partially applied constants in notations, parsing of
    hexadecimal number notation and better handling of scopes and
    coercions for printing.
  * A correct and efficient coercion coherence checking algorithm,
    avoiding spurious or duplicate warnings.
  * An improved Search command which accepts complex queries. This
    takes precedence over the now deprecated ssreflect search.
  * Many additions and improvements of the standard library.
  * Improvements to the reference manual include a more logical
    organization of chapters along with updated syntax descriptions
    that match Coq's grammar in most but not all chapters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  6 12:11:06 UTC 2020 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.11.2.
  * Fixed a kernel issue where using Require inside a section
    caused an anomaly when closing the section.
  * Fixed normalization in conclusion of custom induction scheme.
  * Fixed a loss of location of some tactic errors.
  * Ignore -native-compiler option when built without native
    compute support.
  * Fixed a segfault issue with CoqIDE completion.
  * Highlighting style is now consistently applied to all three
    buffers of CoqIDE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  8 22:20:23 UTC 2020 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.11.1, with upstream support for OCaml 4.10.
  * Allow more inductive types in Unset Positivity Checking mode.
  * Fixed bugs in dealing with precedence of notations in custom
    entries.
  * In primitive floats, print a warning when parsing a decimal
    value that is not exactly a binary64 floating-point number.
    For instance, parsing 0.1 will print a warning whereas parsing
    0.5 won't.
  * Fixed an issue in CoqIDE about compiling file paths containing
    spaces.
  * Fixed an issue where Extraction Implicit on the constructor of
    a record was leading to an anomaly.
- Remove now obsolete ocaml-410-build.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 29 21:42:13 UTC 2020 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

    scale tactics, with built-in support for datatypes and the
    multi-goal tactic monad.
  * Primitive floats are integrated in terms and follow the binary64
    format of the IEEE 754 standard, as specified in the
    Coq.Float.Floats library.
  * Many other cleanups and improvements have been performed and
    are further described in the changelog.
  * Special note on compatibility: Fixed bugs of Export and Import
    that can have a significant impact on user developments.
- Drop unneeded empty *.vos files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  3 13:22:18 UTC 2019 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 8.9.0.
  * Kernel: mutually recursive records are now supported.
  * Notations:
    + Support for autonomous grammars of terms called ‚Äúcustom
      entries‚Äù.
    + Deprecated notations of the standard library will be removed
      in the next version of Coq, see the next subsection for a
      script to ease porting.
    + Added the "Numeral Notation" command for registering decimal
      numeral notations for custom types.
  * Tactics: Introduction tactics intro/intros on a goal that is an
    existential variable now force a refinement of the goal into a
    dependent product rather than failing.
  * Decision procedures: deprecation of tactic romega in favor of
    lia and removal of fourier, replaced by lra which subsumes it.
  * Proof language: focusing bracket { now supports named goals,
    e.g. [x]:{ will focus on a goal (existential variable) named x.
  * SSReflect: the implementation of delayed clear was simplified:
    the variables are always renamed using inaccessible names when
    the clear switch is processed and finally cleared at the end of
    the intro pattern. In addition to that, the use-and-discard
    flag {} typical of rewrite rules can now be also applied to
    views, e.g. => {}/v applies v and then clears v.
    See Section Introduction in the context.
  * Vernacular:
    + Experimental support for attributes on commands, as in
      "#[local] Lemma foo : bar". Tactics and tactic notations now
      support the deprecated attribute.
    + Removed deprecated commands "Arguments Scope" and "Implicit
      Arguments" in favor of "Arguments (scopes)" and "Arguments
      (implicits)".
    + New flag "Uniform Inductive Parameters" to avoid repeating
      uniform parameters in constructor declarations.
    + New commands "Hint Variables" and "Hint Constants" for
      controlling the opacity status of variables and constants in
      hint databases. It is recommended to always use these
      commands after creating a hint database with Create HintDb.
    + Multiple sections with the same name are now allowed.
  * Library: additions and changes in the VectorDef, Ascii, and
    String libraries. Syntax notations are now available only when
    using "Import" of libraries and not merely "Require".
    (Source of incompatibility, see Change Log for details)
  * Toplevels: coqtop and coqide can now display diffs between
    proof steps in color, using the Diffs option.
  * Documentation: we integrated a large number of fixes to the new
    Sphinx documentation.
  * Tools: removed gallina utility and homebrewed Emacs mode.
- Update to version 8.9.1, which contains
  * some quality-of-life bug fixes,
  * many improvements to the documentation,
  * a critical bug fix related to primitive projections and
    native_compute.

  needed, and the docs aren't build with TeX and hevea anymore.
- Remove dependencies that are automatically detected.
