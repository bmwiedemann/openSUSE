  <title>Web Front-End to Monitor System Data via RRDtool</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'cacti' from project 'openSUSE:Factory:Contrib'.

Cacti is a complete front-end to RRDtool: it stores all necessary
information for creating graphs and populates them with data from a
MySQL database. The front-end is completely PHP driven. Along with
being ableto maintain graphs, data sources, and round robin archives
ina database, Cacti also handles data gathering. There exists an SNMP
support for those accustomed to creating traffic graphs with MRTG as
well.
