- Update to version 2.4:
  * (bsc#1186226) - (CVE-2019-18906) client side password hashing is equivalent to clear text password storage
  * Fix authentication on all places.
  * Fix sysconfig variable name.
  * First step to use plain text password instead of hashed password.
  * Move repository into the SUSE github organization
  * decorate readme with more usage instructions
  * in RPC server, if client comes from localhost, remember its ipv4 localhost address instead of ipv6 address
  * Test clear expired commands in TestDB_UpdateSeenFlag
  * tell a record to clear expired pending commands upon saving a command result; introduce pending commands RPC test case
  * avoid hard coding 127.0.0.1 in host ID of alive message test; let system administrator mount and unmount disks by issuing these two commands on key server.
