  <title>Small command-line, lossless MP3 editor</title>
  <description>This is a small program to edit mp3 files without quality loss. Playback is
realized via mpg123, so be sure to have it installed or at least have a
symlink to your favorite mp3 playing program.
You can mark beginning and end of a segment with 'a' and 'b' and save the
segment with 's'.
Beginning with version 0.5 even VBR files are officially supported.  Using a
timetable with VBR files will not be as precise as with CBR files, though.
