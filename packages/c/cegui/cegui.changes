  Factory.

- Update to version 0.8.7
  * FIX: Bug regarding order of destruction : Element object
     referenced by '__auto_titlebar__' is not attached to Element
  * FIX: Child removal always triggered a deactivation event due to
     a change in a fix for 0.8.5, now the deactivation event is
     only triggered when the element was actually active.
  * MOD: Some changes around the Cmake for the OgreRenderer
     were done, both fixes and enhancements
  * FIX: SimpleTimer.cpp includes headers into namespace

     CEGUICoreWindowRendererSet in Docu

     Scrollbar's autowindow children
  * FIX: Properties that are forwarded via PropertyLinkDefinitions
     are printed to XML
  * FIX: Tooltips behave glitchy, take away focus from underlying
     windows, affect move-events
  * FIX: Tooltips are wrongly printed to XML, inheritance affects
     the printing and uses wrong values
  * FIX: Numerous windows XML-print some redundant
     (because forwarded) AutoWindow properties
  * FIX: Scrollable panes print their children inside their
     autowindow instead of directly inside them
  * FIX: StaticText uses incorrect Font when DefaultFont of a
     GUIContext is changed
  * FIX: Window font ignored in RenderStringTextComponents
  * FIX: Issue an exception if the locale is unexpected, before
     parsing anything with sscanf
