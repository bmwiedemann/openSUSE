%description
This plugin is designed to work in conjunction with flannel, a network fabric
for containers. When flannel daemon is started, it outputs a
/run/flannel/subnet.env file that looks like this:

FLANNEL_NETWORK=10.1.0.0/16
FLANNEL_SUBNET=10.1.17.1/24
FLANNEL_MTU=1472
FLANNEL_IPMASQ=true

This information reflects the attributes of flannel network on the host. The
flannel CNI plugin uses this information to configure another CNI plugin, such
as bridge plugin.
