    <comment>- update to 1.12.1:
  * fix: Pulls Fulcio root and intermediate when --certificate-chain is not
    passed into verify-blob command. The v1.12.0 release introduced a
    regression: when COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL was not set, cosign verify-blob would
    check a --certificate (without a --certificate-chain provided) against the
    operating system root CA bundle. In this release, Cosign checks the
    certificate against Fulcio's CA root instead (restoring the earlier
    behavior).
  * fix: fix cert chain validation for verify-blob in non-experimental mode
  * fix: add COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 for verify-bloba
  * Fix BYO-root with intermediate to fetch intermediates from annotation
  * fix: fixing breaking changes in rekor v1.12.0 upgrade
- use go-modules service to generate the vendor.tar and use zstd (forwarded request 1006385 from dirkmueller)</comment>
