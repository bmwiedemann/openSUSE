- Work with upstream compliant CUPS 1.4 on all platforms
  which means to have a fixed "/usr/lib/cups/" directory
  on all platforms (see Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#575544).
- Make sure lpadmin talks only to the cupsd on localhost
  via the '-h localhost' command line option.
- Removed the test if /var/run/cups/cups.sock is a socket
  because the local cupsd may run just as well without it
  (only "Listen localhost:631" in cupsd.conf is mandatory).
