+If a file or an archive is larger than the default or configured size (see \-\-max\-filesize and \-\-max-scansize options) scanning will abort at the limit, and the file will be marked as "OK".

 Most of the options are simple switches which enable or disable some features. Options marked with [=yes/no(*)] can be optionally followed by =yes/=no; if they get called without the boolean argument the scanner will assume 'yes'. The asterisk marks the default internal setting for a given option.
