  <title>A simple testing framework for command line applications</title>
  <description>Cram is a functional testing framework for command line applications
based on Mercurial's `unified test format'.

Cram tests look like snippets of interactive shell sessions. Cram runs
each command and compares the command output in the test with the
command's actual output.
