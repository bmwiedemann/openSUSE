- update to 0.7
* Added the -d/--debug flag that disables diffing of expected/actual output and
    instead passes through script output to stdout/stderr.
* Added the --shell-opts flag for specifying flags to invoke the shell with. By
    setting --shell-opts='-x' and --debug together, this can be used to see shell 
    commands as they're run and their output in real time which can be useful for
    debugging slow or hanging tests.
* Added xUnit XML output support (for better integration of test results with Bamboo
    and other continuous integration tools).
* Added support for using (esc) on expected out lines that aren't automatically 
    escaped in actual output.
* Added the $TESTSHELL environment variable. This allows a test to portably check
    what shell it was invoked with.
* Added an error message for when no tests are found in a directory.
* Changed Makefile to install into /usr/local by default.
* Simplified the Makefile's targets. The targets available now are all, build, 
    check/test, clean, dist, install, and quicktest (for running the test suite
    without checking test coverage).
* Fixed non-ASCII strings not being escaped with (esc) on Python 3.
* Fixed a crash on tests that don't have a trailing newline.
* Fixed a crash when using set -x with zsh.
