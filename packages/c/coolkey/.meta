  <title>CoolKey and CAC PKCS #11 PKI Module for Smart Cards</title>
  <description>Linux Driver support for the CoolKey and CAC products. CoolKeys are
part of a complete PKI solution that provides smart card login, single
sign-on, secure messaging, and secure email access. In the complete
solution, users are issued CoolKeys by their employer, ISP, bank, or
other parties. When the user plugs the keys in for the first time, the
keys are automatically provisioned with certificates, keys, and a PIN,
unique for that user by the Red Hat Certificate System. Once the
CoolKey is provisioned, the user can take the key to any system and use
it to login (authenticate), send and receive signed and encrypted
email, or participate in secure messaging or IRC communication. Using a
CoolKey should be as easy as starting a car. To accomplish that vision,
we are focusing on building complete support for CoolKey on exactly one
token. As the system is built out, we can add token support. CoolKeys
are based on JavaCard 1.2. We are testing with Axalto Egate Cyberflex
cards, which are available in both smart card and USB Fob form factors.</description>
