%description
Checksec is a bash script to check the properties of executables (like PIE,
RELRO, PaX, Canaries, ASLR, Fortify Source). It has been originally written by
Tobias Klein and the original source is available here:
http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html

Modern Linux distributions offer some mitigation techniques to make it harder
to exploit software vulnerabilities reliably. Mitigations such as RELRO,
NoExecute (NX), Stack Canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and
Position Independent Executables (PIE) have made reliably exploiting any
vulnerabilities that do exist far more challenging. The checksec script is
designed to test what *standard* Linux OS and PaX (http://pax.grsecurity.net/)
security features are being used.
