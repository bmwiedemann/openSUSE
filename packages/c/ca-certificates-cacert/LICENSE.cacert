Alternatives

If you find the terms of the above Root Distribution License difficult or
inadequate for your purposes, you may wish to:

  • Enter into the CAcert Community Agreement by registering as a Member. This
    is free.
  • Delete CAcert Root Certificates from your software. Your software
    documentation should give directions and assistance for this.

These alternatives are outside the above Root Distribution License and do not
incorporate.
