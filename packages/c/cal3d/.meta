  <title>Cal3D</title>
  <description>Cal3D is a skeletal based 3D character animation library written in C++ in a platform-/graphic API-independent way. Originally designed to be used in a 3D client for Worldforge, it evolved into a stand-alone product which can be used in many different kinds of projects. It supports combining animations and actions through a &quot;mixer&quot; interface, and work is currently underway to integrate morph targets (interpolating between one mesh and another, using the same vertex sequence) easily into the system.

For now, this is an aggregate of cal3d, but should be moved in the long run.</description>
