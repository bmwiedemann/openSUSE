  <title>Periodic cpu utilization statistics</title>
  <description>cpustat periodically reports the current CPU utilization of running tasks and
can optionally report per CPU and per task utilization statistics at the end
of a run.
cpustat has been designed and optimized to use a minimal amount of CPU cycles
to monitor a system hence it is a light weight alternative to traditional
process monitoring tools such as top.
