%description
Coccinelle is a program matching and transformation engine which
provides the language SmPL (Semantic Patch Language) for specifying
desired matches and transformations in C code. [It does not recognize
C++.]

Coccinelle performs collateral evolutions in software. Such
evolutions comprise the changes that are needed in client code in
response to evolutions in library APIs, and may include modifications
such as renaming a function, adding a function argument whose value
is somehow context-dependent, and reorganizing a data structure.
Beyond collateral evolutions, Coccinelle is used for finding and
fixing bugs in systems code.
