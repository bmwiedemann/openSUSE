Sat Jan 28 19:47:27 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- updaet to 20230120:
  * Intel's 13th Generation Core datasheet provides stepping names as
    well as numbers!  So:
  * cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(11,7) Raptor Lake B0 stepping.
  * cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(11,15) Raptor Lake C0
    steppings, and clarified case for unknown stepping.
  * cpuid.man: Added 743844: 13th Generation Core datasheet.
  * cpuid.c: Fixed (0,6)(12,15) synth typo: Emearld Rapids.
  * cpuid.c: Added 6/eax IA32_HW_FEEDBACK_THREAD_CONFIG bit 25.
  * cpuid.c: Added 7/0/edx SGX-KEYS: SGX attestation services.
  * cpuid.c: Clarified 7/0/edx IA32_MCU_OPT_CTRL SRBDS mitigation MSR.
  * cpuid.c: Clarified 7/0/edx IA32_TSX_FORCE_ABORT MSR.
  * cpuid.c: Added 7/1/edx CET_SSS: shadow stacks w/o page faults.
  * cpuid.c: Added several 7/2/edx bits.
  * cpuid.c: In 0xd/0/eax, corrected CET_U & CET_S, which were IA32_XSS.
  * cpuid.c: In 0xd/0/eax, removed the IA32_XSS bits, which aren't
    relevant for XCR0.
  * cpuid.c: For 0xd/1/ecx, enumerate the IA32_XSS bits instead of a
    hex bitmask.
  * cpuid.c: For 0xd, added IA32_XSS PASID state (couple places).
  * cpuid.c: Renamed 0x1a: Native Model ID.
  * cpuid.c: Added synth & uarch decoding for (0,6),(11,15) Raptor Lake
    from MSR_CPUID_table*.
  * cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(9,7),5 Pentium Gold G7400,
    based on instlatx64 sample.
  * cpuid.c: Added rudimentary synth decoding for future (0,6),(12,15)
    Emerald Rapids CPUs.
  * cpuid.c: Added 7/1/eax LASS: linear address space separation.
  * cpuid.c: Corrected 0x18/n/edx maximum number of addressible IDs, which
    should use minus-one notation.
  * cpuid.c: Certain leaves cannot be displayed correctly in isolation,
    i.e. without information about other leaves saved in the stash.  For
    example, the display for leaf 3 uses bits saved from leaf 1.  If the
    -l/--leaf option is used to restrict cpuid to reading only a single
    leaf, such leaves now are displayed as raw hex, rather than with
    incorrect information.  This is handled by passing a NULL stash to
    print_reg() and below, and by many new checks for a NULL stash.
  * cpuid.c: Updated cache associativity strings used in 0x80000006 and
    0x80000019 leaves to use value ranges, as in AMD docs.
  * cpuid.c: Fixed mistake in AMD L3 range reservation support: it's in
    0x80000020/0 register EBX, not ECX.
  * cpuid.c: Added 0x80000026/0/edx extended APIC ID.
  * cpuid.c: Added synth & uarch decoding for (10,15),(1,1) Genoa, from
    AMD 57095 revision guide.
  * cpuid.man: Added AMD 57095 revision guides, and some older guides that
    I'd forgotten.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 15 08:43:11 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20161114

  cpuid to dump just the specified leaf and subleaf. If
  -s/--subleaf is not specified, it is assumed to be 0. The
  intended purpose for this is to display raw dumps of
  not-yet-supported leaves.
* cpuid.c: Added AVX512DQ, AVX512IFMA, AVX512BW, AVX512VL, and
  CLWB decoding to 7/ebx.

  processors.
* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Apollo Lake processors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 30 08:57:28 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20160814
* cpuinfo2cpuid: Added a script that takes input from a
  /proc/cpuinfo file and converts it into suitable input to
  cpuid. The information that cpuid is capable of producing based
  on this very limited input information is slight, but
  apparently there is interest in getting the synthesized (synth)
  leaf from this.
* Support SGX, MPX, BNDLDX/BNDSTX, RDPID, and IA32_XSS PT state.
* Add information for Skylake, Broadwell, Broadwell-E and -EX
  processors, Atom C2000 (Avoton) with A0/A1 steppings, Atom
  Z3n00 (Bay Trail) stepping 1, Xeon D-1500 (Broadwell-DE) V2
  stepping, corrected Atom Z8000 (Cherry Trail), added Atom S1200
  (Centerton) and VIA Eden.

  N and J series.
