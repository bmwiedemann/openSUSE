-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 23 09:54:56 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20170122
  * Added synth decoding for Intel Knights Landing B0.
  * Added new synth decodings for Intel Kaby Lake.
  * Fixed synth decodings for AMD Steamroller and Jaguar.
  * Added synth decodings for AMD Puma and Excavator.
  * For (6,15),(0,2) Piledriver processors, detect FX series and
    report it as Vishera instead of Abu Dhabi/Seoul/Delhi.
  * Added general microarchitecure names for AMD (e.g.
    Piledriver) in addition to specific core names (e.g. Trinity)
    for later generation processors. If I have trouble
    remembering these, it seems likely other people do too.

    Bridge processors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  2 08:55:37 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20161201
  * Fixed bugs in the subleaf walks for 0x8000001d (AMD cache
    information) and 0x40000003 (Xen hypervisor information) because
    the code for them was under wholly the wrong loops.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 15 08:43:11 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20161114
* cpuid.c: Added -l/--leaf and -s/--subleaf options to cause
  cpuid to dump just the specified leaf and subleaf. If
  -s/--subleaf is not specified, it is assumed to be 0. The
  intended purpose for this is to display raw dumps of
  not-yet-supported leaves.
* cpuid.c: Added AVX512DQ, AVX512IFMA, AVX512BW, AVX512VL, and
  CLWB decoding to 7/ebx.
* cpuid.c: Added AVX512VBMI to 7/ecx.
* cpuid.c: Added print_f_0_edx to show L3 cache QoS monitoring
  support.
* cpuid.c: Added total & local bandwidth monitoring to 0xf/1/edx.
* cpuid.c: Added 0x15/ecx nominal core crystal clock decoding.
* cpuid.c: In print_17_0_ebx, corrected reversed scheme
  encodings.
* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Xeon D-1500 (Broadwell-DE) Y0
  stepping.
* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding comment about Braswell D1
  stepping, but its stepping number is not documented.
* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(8,14) Kaby Lake
  processors.
* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Apollo Lake processors.
* cpuid.c: Added vague synth decoding for (0,6),(9,14) Kaby Lake
  processors.
* cpuid.c: Add AVX512_4VNNIW & AVX512_4FMAPS flags.
* cpuid.c: Add Knights Mill (KNM) CPUID.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 30 08:57:28 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 20160814
* cpuinfo2cpuid: Added a script that takes input from a
  /proc/cpuinfo file and converts it into suitable input to
  cpuid. The information that cpuid is capable of producing based
  on this very limited input information is slight, but
  apparently there is interest in getting the synthesized (synth)
  leaf from this.
* Support SGX, MPX, BNDLDX/BNDSTX, RDPID, and IA32_XSS PT state.
* Add information for Skylake, Broadwell, Broadwell-E and -EX
  processors, Atom C2000 (Avoton) with A0/A1 steppings, Atom
  Z3n00 (Bay Trail) stepping 1, Xeon D-1500 (Broadwell-DE) V2
  stepping, corrected Atom Z8000 (Cherry Trail), added Atom S1200
  (Centerton) and VIA Eden.

* Corrected Atom Z3000 model & stepping which were bafflingly
  wrong: (0,6)(3,5),1 -> (0,6)(3,7),8.
* Corrected other Bay Trail stepping names for Celeron/Pentium
  N and J series.
* Added synth decoding for Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Corner).
* Added synth decoding for Intel Atom C2000 (Avoton).
