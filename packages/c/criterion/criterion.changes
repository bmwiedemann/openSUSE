- Rename devel package from libcriterion3-devel to
  libcriterion-devel: the devel package never follows the soversion
  of the libraries, as it is, unlike the libraries, not meant to be
  parallel-installable.

- Update to 2.4.2:
  * Fix: fixed crash in assert failure reporting when there was no diff.
    If the user-provided function to stringify an object was bugged and
    produced equal output for non-equal objects, thus producing an empty
    diff, Criterion crashed trying to access an unset parameter list.
  * Fix: fixed crashing tests when Criterion was compiled with nanopb>=0.4.7
  * Fix: fixed deadlock when test timeout was specified and the system was
    overloaded.
  * Fix: fixed segfault if map_shdr fails (David Gloe).
  * Fix: fixed memory leak on test failure (Jookia).
  * Fix: fixed gt() and ge().
  * Fix: escape XML/JSON reports.
  * Misc: converted klib and debugbreak submodules to subprojects
  * Misc: various documentation fixes (Yuri Victorovich, Jonas Schulze).
  * Misc: various updates to dependencies.
- Delete fix-nanopb.patch
- Add fix-meson.patch: since klib and debugbreak provides only some header
  files, search for those deps in Meson fails, therefore we have to remove
  them. Those deps are specified in the spec file though.
