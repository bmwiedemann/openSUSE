%description
container-diff is a tool for analyzing and comparing container images.
container-diff can examine images along several different criteria, including:
- Docker Image History
- Image file system
- Apt packages
- RPM packages
- pip packages
- npm packages

These analyses can be performed on a single image, or a diff can be performed
on two images to compare.
