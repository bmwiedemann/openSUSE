  <description>
	  Caffeine is a system applet that allows the user to temporarily
	  inhibit both the screensaver and the sleep power saving mode,
	  simply by clicking on it. This could be useful for example when
	  watching long flash videos or playing certain full screen games
	  that don't inhibit the screensaver by themselves.
