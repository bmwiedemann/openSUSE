  available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  1 13:56:18 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.8.3
  + No changelog for this version
- Changes from version 2.8.2
  + Fixes some minor bugs in 2.8.
  + Fix a major bug inadvertently introduced in the short-lived
    2.8.1 (caffeine-indicator was broken).
- Changes from version 2.8
  + Restores widely-missed functionality removed in Caffeine 2.7:
    namely the ability to inhibit desktop idleness manually,
    (via the new caffeine-indicator) and the ability to inhibit
    desktop idleness for the duration of a particular command
    (via the new command 'caffeinate'). It should also work in most
    desktop environments again (Caffeine 2.7 worked in only a few).
- Replace python-devel BuildRequires with python3-devel: follow
  upstreams port to python3
- Changed dependencies:
  + python3-xdg in place of python-xdg
  + python3-xlib in place of python-xlib
- Rebase
  caffeine-fix-desktop-file-semicolon-trailing-character.patch.

  really fix the missing trailing ;

- Update to version 2.7.2:
  + Fix a crash when there is no active window (lp#1322291).
  + Fix Caffeine not terminating when the session ends
    (lp#1324304).
- Changes from version 2.7.1:
  + Fix a crash when a window disappears during full-screen check.
- Changes from version 2.7:
  + Remove manual control, and hence UI.
  + Allow multiple instances per user: should really be one per X
    display.
- Changes from version 2.6.2:
  + Add a build number just to persuade Launchpad to rebuild.
- Changes from version 2.6:
  + Auto-activate the screensaver when a full-screen window is
    present.
  + Remove the ability to watch processes; applications should
    inhibit idleness themselves, and many now do.
  + Remove -a and -d command-line arguments: single-instance
    nature of Caffeine means it shouldn't be used from the command
    line. xdg-screensaver should be used instead.
  + Bump to standards 3.9.5 (no change).
- Changes from version 2.5:
  + Fix right-click on icon (lp#892663).
  + Replace autostart option with an XDG autostart .desktop file.
  + Remove specific support for Quake Live.
  + Require appindicator3; remove non-appindicator support.
  + Put requirement for notify support in package, not code.
  + Remove ability to disable icon: this should be done by the
    desktop environment, not the application.
  + Remove hash-bang lines from non-executable files (lp#931875).
  + Fix race condition for notifications, patch from Andr√© Ericson
    (lp#892865).
  + Fix i18n issues (lp#941495).
  + Fix Open Build Service desktop file errors (lp#931874).
  + Add dependencies for all required libraries (lp#1093324).
  + Fix recognition of apps which mention their name in their
    arguments (lp#1249796).
  + Use freedesktop ScreenSaver DBus API instead of per-desktop
    APIs (lp#1239935).
  + Put description string on one line in setup.py to placate
    rpmbuild (lp#595889).
  + Remove non-working Flash support.
  + Remove custom logging module.
  + Remove --preferences command-line option, no longer needed.
  + Remove --time command-line option: we're not supporting timed
    disabling any more.
  + Make Ctrl+C work (lp#907517).
- Remove obsolete patches (fixed upstream):
  + caffeine-add-indicator-menu.patch
  + caffeine-fix-desktop-categories.patch
  + caffeine-fix-non-executable-script.patch
- Added
  caffeine-fix-desktop-file-semicolon-trailing-character.patch: fix
  missing semicolons in .desktop file.
- Drop glib2-devel BuildRequires: caffeine no longer install a
  gschema file.
- Remove glib2_gsettings_schema_post/postun due to above change.
- Drop and deprecate caffeine-lang subpackage: upstream does not
  provide translations anymore.
- Remove deprecated %py_requires.
