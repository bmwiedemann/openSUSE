- update to 6.0.0:
  * The display settings window in the setup tool has been
    reorganised to a better arrangement.
  * It is now possible to load .lmp files (and play back demos)
    with long filenames
  * In the setup tool, it is now possible to hold down shift when
  * changing key/mouse/joystick bindings to prevent other
    bindings to the same key from being cleared (thanks myk).
  * The joystick menu in the setup tool now has a test button
  * Specifying the -privateserver option implies -server
  * Freedesktop.org desktop files are now installed for Doom and
    the setup tool, which will appear in the main menu on desktop
  * environments such as Gnome and KDE
  * The Chex Quest dehacked patch (chex.deh) will now be detected
    if it is in the same directory as the IWAD file.
  * Added support for the alternate version of the Final Doom
    executable included in some later versions of the Id
    Anthology.
  * Very short sound effects are not played, to better emulate
    the behavior of DMX in Vanilla Doom
  * The null sector dereference emulation code has been imported
    from Prboom+ - this fixes a desync with CLNJ-506.LMP
  * The IDMUS cheat doesn’t work when emulating the v1.9
    executable
  * Menu navigation when using joystick/joypad (thanks AXDOOMER).
  * For configuration file value for shift keys, use scan code
    for right shift, not left shift (thanks AXDOOMER).
  * Default joystick buttons for the setup tool now match Vanilla
  * The default sfx/music volume set by the setup tool is now 8
    instead of 15, matching the game itself. (thanks AXDOOMER).
  * Weapon cycling from the shotgun to the chaingun in Doom 1 now
    works properly (thanks AXDOOMER).
  * MIDI playback that locked up when using an empty MUS / MIDI
    file
  * Default sampling rate used by setup tool changed to 44100Hz,
    to match the game default (thanks AXDOOMER).
