  <title>Wire Font</title>
  <description>Wire is a condensed monoline sans. Its modular-based characters are
flavored with a sense of art nouveau. Nearly hairline thickness suggests
usage for body text above 12px. While at display sizes it reveals its
tiny dot terminals to create a sharp mood in headlines.

For web typesetting it is recommended to adjust letter-spacing for sizes
below 30px to 0.033em and up. For 12 px we recommend the value of
0.085em.
