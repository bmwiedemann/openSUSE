-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 12 10:41:08 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.26.2:
  + Accept upper case 'A' when selecting all content in a Text
    actor. This is similar to what GTK+ allows, and makes it easier
    to select text with Caps Lock enabled.
  + Use GDK API when using Wayland sub-surfaces. The GDK backend on
    Wayland uses sub-surfaces to allow Cogl to manage the rendering
    surface; now that GDK exposes the necessary API, we can avoid
    using the Wayland API directly, and instead let GDK manage the
    surface for us.
  + Documentation fixes.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#766326, bgo#768243, bgo#768734, bgo#781975,
    bgo#759085, bgo#774546, bgo#762888, bgo#772412, bgo#770288,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 18:57:02 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.25.6:
  + Enable swap throttling for fullscreen windows with GDK. Avoids
    performance penalties with the GDK backend on constrained
    devices running full screen Clutter and Clutter-GTK
    applications.
  + Add platform-specific data for the libinput input backend. This
    allows implementing high level functionality when writing
    Wayland compositors based on Clutter.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#752752, bgo#755849.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 15:02:38 UTC 2016 - fcrozat@suse.com

- Resync BuildRequires with the ones from configure.ac:
  + pkgconfig(gdk-3.0) >= 3.16.0 (needed when building X11 and

    bgo#754889, bgo#754890, bgo#754938, bgo#754993, bgo#755014.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 21 18:06:18 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.23.6:
  + Require Cogl 1.21.2.
  + Prefer the OpenGL 3.x Cogl driver. The GL3 driver drops legacy
    API, and should bring a slight performance improvement, as well
    as lower memory overhead. If GL3 is not supported, Clutter
    falls back to the older GL driver transparently.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#742678, bgo#746279, bgo#753895.
  + Updated translations.
- Add pkgconfig(gio-2.0) BuildRequires: This is now an explicit
  dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 23 12:15:00 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.23.4:
  + Add functions for binding a GListModel to a ClutterActor. The
    bind_model() and bind_model_with_propertis() methods on
    ClutterActor allow binding objects inside a GListModel
    implementation to children or an actor.
  + Add event types for touchpad gestures. Currently, the libinput
    input backend is the only one that will generate the touchpad
    events for swipe and pinch/zoom/rotate, but support for other
    backends is planned in the future.
  + Documentation fixes.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#752272, bgo#752056, bgo#752104, bgo#751472.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 30 13:24:04 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.23.2:
  + Add accessor functions for ClutterActor state. Currently, actor
    state is accessible only via GObject properties and via
    pre-processor macros; the former are not very friendly for C
    developers, while the latter are not usable from language
    bindings. New functions have been added to fill in the gap; the
    macros have a "soft" deprecation, since compiler warnings
    cannot be used to detect their use.
  + Merge the Cally API reference into Clutter's. The Cally API is
    part of the Clutter shared library; it makes sense to have the
    API references merged.
  + Improve visual handling with the GDK backend running on X11.
    Cogl has its own visual, based on its preferred GLXFBConfig;
    this means that Clutter should use and expose the correct
    GdkVisual instance when creating the GdkWindow used for drawing
    the contents of the stage.
  + Improve input device handling in the GDK backend. Properly
    detect touchpad devices; translate touch events.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#707982, bgo#750496, bgo#747489, bgo#747951,
    bgo#749739, bgo#749482.

  detection, previous commit had a typo (bgo#749482).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 12 17:51:36 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.22.2:
  + Improve touchpad detection in the X11 backend. The X11 backend
    now uses the same heuristics as GDK.
  + Fix handling of SwapBuffersWithDamage on EGL. Use the correct
    arguments for the Cogl API, which is mapped on the
    corresponding EGL extension.
  + Fix ClutterStage:use-alpha. Painting the stage with the
    use-alpha property is now working on all backends.
  + Fix detection of an ARGB visual in the GDK backend.

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 18 02:23:38 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.21.2:
  + Improve input device handling. Both on the evdev input backend,
    and the XInput2 backend for X11.
  + Allow content implementations to drive actors preferred size.
    If a ClutterActor is only used to paint a ClutterContent
    implementation, it should be possible to allow the actor to
    have the same preferred size of its content. We use a
    ClutterRequestMode to specify this behaviour.
  + Documentation fixes.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#738520, bgo#739050, bgo#741350, bgo#740997,
    bgo#676326, bgo#711182, bgo#709252, bgo#669743, bgo#719962,

Tue Apr 15 05:32:29 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.18.2:
  + Fix the list of dependencies. Clutter 1.18 depends on Cogl
    1.17.5 when building the EGL/KMS backend.
  + Fixes for the Visual Studio build files. Use the new symbol
    visibility annotations when building with MSVC.
  + Fix event handling on Windows. An optimization led to a crash
    on the Windows backend when delivering events without an
    associated ClutterStage.
  + Ensure that set_child_above/below work on the Stage
    ClutterStage should respect the paint order when using the
    Actor API.
  + Skip conformance test suite on X11 when DISPLAY is unset.
    Instead of bailing out when initializing the test suite we
    should just tell the test suite API to skip the units. This
    allows the TAP driver to catch the skipped tests and avoid
    warnings.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#728177, bgo#727020, bgo#711645, bgo#726762,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  8 22:21:19 CEST 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.3.6:
  + Provide a fallback on GLX if the MESA_copy_sub_buffer extension
    is not available, by using EXT_framebuffer_blit. Both
    mechanisms are also throttled to avoid taking all resources
    when using them in a compositor like Mutter.
  + Use (and cache) fragment shaders instead of texture combiners
    inside Cogl materials. Cogl will automatically fall back from
    GLSL to ARBfp to fixed functions depending on the level of
    support of the underlying GL implementation.
  + Implement a new design for materials; this allows scaling up
    the number of materials in a scene, and also makes copying
    materials less expensive.
  + Make Cogl materials responsible for depth testing, and add new
    experimental API.
  + Use the (modified) GLU tesselator to draw paths to a vertex
    buffer object instead of using the stencil buffer, or the
    scanline rasterizer on platforms without a stencil buffer.
  + Add ClutterDeformEffect, a base class for effects that deform
    an actor's geometry when painting it; ClutterPageTurnEffect is
    an implementation of a "page curl" deformation using the
    DeformEffect API.
  + Always use scissoring when clipping, to reduce the amount of
    buffer that has to be cleared.
  + Allow ClutterShaderEffect sub-classes to use vertex shaders by
    setting a constructor property; the default remains fragment
    shader.
  + Remove the button of the press event from the
    DragAction::drag-begin and DragAction::drag-end signals.
  + Do not promote clipped redraws to full redraws.
  + Improve the consistency of the default state name in
    ClutterState, both in the API and in the serialization format.
  + Fix a rounding error with the Text layout size.
  + Add utility functions for CoglMatrix and CoglColor.
  + Avoid a re-allocation cycle warning when resizing the surface
    of a CairoTexture actor from within the allocate()
    implementation.
  + Do not add the GL libraries for the EGL X11 backend.
  + Add more checks for size of data passed to the shader types
    GValue functions.
  + Add width and height to the BindConstraint.
  + Parse actions, constraints and effects inside an actor
    definition for ClutterScript.
  + Merge the code of native and x11 backends for EGL into a single
    backend; also allow creating GL context with the EGL backend.
  + Use XSETTINGS to set up the backend configuration options, like
    the font name, resolution, font options and double click
    options, on X11; this also allows ClutterText actors created
    using the default font name to be updated when the font name
    and options change; similarly, this allows ClutterUnits to be
    updated when the screen resolution changes.
  + Implement the texture_from_pixmap extension support inside Cogl
    itself, and unify ClutterX11TexturePixmap and
    ClutterGLXTexturePixmap.
  + Documentation improvements in the API reference and in the
    cookbook.
  + Use the -Bsymbolic-functions linker option on supported
    platforms to avoid intra-library PLT jumps.
  + Fix painting transparent stages on X11 using the :use-alpha
    property of ClutterStage.
  + Fix emission of scroll events on Windows.
- Changes from version 1.3.2:
  + Add ClutterEffect, a ClutterActorMeta sub-class that affects
    the way an actor paints itself.
  + Add ClutterClickAction, an action that provides "button-like"
    semantics for any ClutterActor.
  + ClutterDragAction now moves the actor to which it has been
    applied by default, using a class handler for the ::drag-motion
    signal.
  + Add the :pick-with-alpha property to ClutterTexture; this
    property allows using the alpha channel of a texture when
    picking it.
  + Regenerate the mipmaps on COGL textures when a texture is
    modified.
  + Documentation and build fixes.
- Changes from version 1.3.2:
  + Add ActorMeta, a class for run-time composition of actions
    and constraints on a ClutterActor:
    - Add ClutterAction, a class for implementing business logic
      related to event handling.
    - Add ClutterConstraint, a class for implementing business
      logic related to sizing and positioning.
    - ClutterDragAction is an Action sub-class that implements
      signals and properties for dragging actors.
    - ClutterAlignConstraint and ClutterBindConstraint are two
      Constraint sub-classes that allow relative positioning with
      fixed layout managers.
  + Add ClutterState, an object for defining state transitions.
  + Add ClutterBoxLayout:homogeneous property.
  + Implement retained clip stacks.
  + Support retained paths.
  + Add an experimental vector3 API.
  + Make ClutterActor implement AtkImplementor, and allow
    retrieving an AtkObject from a ClutterActor.
  + Improve ClutterText's Pango layout caching mechanism.
  + Fix set up of the GLX_SGI_swap_control extension.
  + Fix EGLX backend.
  + Documentation fixes for Clutter and COGL.
  + Fix the conformance test suite by executing every test unit in
    a separate process.
  + Add platform-dependent defines for Cogl.
  + Update the MingW cross-compilation script.
  + New recipe in the Cookbook.
- Move the make check properly to the %check section, but disable
  it for the moment. Development went a bit ahead the test suite
  and it does not even start.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 10 15:57:36 CEST 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.8:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 29 19:48:23 CEST 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.6:
  + Check if the TexturePixmap actor have an allocation before
    asking for its allocation box, to avoid a costly re-layout.
  + Handle spurious GLX_BufferSwapComplete events more gracefully
    than an assertion failure.
  + Fix a memory leak in the atlas.
  + Use the right constant when calling GetClassLongPtr() in the
    win32 event handling code; this fixes a compilation issue on
    win64.
  + Check the size of the Pango layouts in the cache to avoid
    blowing cache slots.
  + Remove the need for using a function introduced by GLib 2.18,
    to keep our current requirements.
  + Documentation fixes in Clutter and COGL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 22 23:22:44 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + Handle TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB in the 2D sliced textures, and add
    a test case for that extension to avoid regressions
  + Improve the strictness of the JSON parser in the internal copy
    of JSON-GLib to which we fall back in the absence of the system
    one
  + Fix a crasher on NVidia drivers when enabling the ARGB visuals
    by default on GLX.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  3 09:56:06 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  + Improve the Animator API for consistency, and the
    implementation to match the intended behaviour, as documented
  + Add initial (and internal) support for queueing clipped region
    updates and let the GLX texture-from-pixmap actor take
    advantage of it
  + Support any pixel format in cogl_read_pixels()
  + Conditionally use G_VALUE_COLLECT_INIT() in functions using
    variadic arguments lists
  + Consistently use :min-width and :min-height inside the Stage to
    define the minimum size of the Stage window
  + Implement the Scriptable interface for ClutterModel
    sub-classes; this allows setting ClutterModel columns (both
    types and names) in ClutterScript definitions
  + Add support for unsigned integer indices in the VertexBuffer
    API
  + Documentation fixes for Clutter: the coverage is now 100%
  + Fixes for the EGL native backend
  + Require libtool >= 2.2.6
  + Improve tests coverage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 25 21:55:32 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.14:
  + Fix interaction between user resizable Stages and fullscreen on
    X11
  + Define the semantics of ENTER and LEAVE events when actors are
    on the border of the Stage window
  + Take the InputDevice of an event into consideration when
    throttling MOTION events
  + Round the coordinates when clipping to a rectangle in window
    coordinates
  + Always trust the user-provided coordinates when creating a
    CoglTexture from a foreign GL texture
  + Split Clutter's debug annotations from the pick and paint mode
    behavioural modifiers
  + Improve the usage of the CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT flag so that
    every actor using a ClutterFixedLayout manager will
    automatically benefit from it
  + Fix the packing order of ClutterBox so that the convention of
    first-in-first-painted is maintained
  + Documentation fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 09:42:53 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.12:
  + Added ClutterAnimator, a class that allows defining complex
    implicit animations involving multiple actors and states
  + New experimental COGL API to expose “hardware” buffers such as
    PBOs or libdrm surfaces
  + Fixed the issues with resizable stages getting a 1×1 window
    with the X11 backends
  + Expose input devices for every event; by default, X11 and
    Windows backends expose the core devices only
  + Add the ClutterStage:key-focus property, for key focus tracking
  + Allow setting transformable value types in ClutterAnimation
    when calling clutter_animation_bind() and
    clutter_animation_update()
  + Delay the creation of the default Stage until
    clutter_stage_get_default() is actually called; this reduces
    the work of clutter_init()
  + Implement Ctrl+Delete and Ctrl+Backspace in ClutterText
  + Improve the extendability of CoglTexture with internal backends
  + Add implicit texture atlasing; Cogl will try to put every
    texture inside the same texture atlas by default, to avoid
    state changes in the driver and (hopefully) improve performance
  + Fix notification of the cursor and selection changes in
    ClutterText; this improves the usage of Clutter from A11Y
    toolkits
  + Do not wait for a frame if the system clock goes backwards
  + Fix the dirtying of the clip state; this unbreaks
    cogl_path_fill()
  + Documentation and build fixes: COGL is now 100% documented
  + Fixed compilation with the Sun C compiler
  + Use SSE2 instructions to premultiply RGBA images, if available
  + Improve readability of ClutterActor::raise/::lower warnings
  + Add sanity checks for _clutter_do_pick() to avoid invoking it
    on stages in their destruction phase
  + Avoid multiple type checks in clutter_actor_get_paint_opacity()
  + Fix some race conditions in the resizing of the Stage on the
    X11 backends
  + Optimize taking sub-textures of sub-textures
  + Add support for getting event notification after a non-blocking
    glXSwapBuffers() by using the INTEL_GFX_swap_events extension
    that has been added to Mesa 7.8
  + Improve ClutterBox and ClutterGroup
- Drop clutter-cogl-buffer.patch: fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 10 14:24:25 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.10:
  + Fixed a regression in textures that caused all the textures to
    be drawn as white rectangles
  + Fixed compilation with the Sun C compiler
  + Use SSE2 instructions to premultiply RGBA images, if available
  + Improve readability of ClutterActor::raise/::lower warnings
- Changes from version 1.1.8:
  + Added ClutterAnimator, a class that allows defining complex
    implicit animations involving multiple actors and states
  + New experimental COGL API to expose "hardware" buffers such as
    PBOs or drm surfaces
  + Fixed the issues with resizable stages getting a 1x1 window
    with the x11 backends
  + Expose input devices for every event; by default, X11 and
    Windows backends expose the core devices only

  + Allow setting transformable value types in ClutterAnimation
    when calling clutter_animation_bind() and
    clutter_animation_update()
  + Delay the creation of the default Stage until
    clutter_stage_get_default() is actually called

  + Add implicit texture atlasing
  + Fix notification of the cursor and selection changes in
    ClutterText
  + Do not wait for a frame if the system clock goes backwards
  + Fix the dirtying of the clip state; this unbreaks
    cogl_path_fill()
  + Documentation and build fixes
- Fix build by adding clutter-cogl-buffer.patch from upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 00:55:57 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.6:
  + Some fixes for the Win32 backend
  + Profiling support via the UProf library
  + Improved conformance tests with coverage reports via gcov
  + ClutterTexture no longer tres to read back texture data into
    g_malloc'd memory on unrealize
  + The CGL_* defines from cogf-defines.h have been removed
  + Added a delete-event signal to the stage
  + Fix for using cogl_rectangle with different texture coordinates
    for multiple layers
  + Fix for using stencil and depth buffers in FBOs on Intel
    drivers in Mesa
  + Support for subtitles in ClutterMedia
  + ClutterGLX will now use an RGB visual by default
  + Fix ClutterText to allow using Pango markup and attributes in
    the same actor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 15:28:27 CET 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.4:
  + Update the ClutterScript parser to be more resilient, and
    support constructor and ChildMeta properties. The parser also
    respects the order of the properties in the UI definitions when
    applying them, and will apply the properties of an Actor after
    building the scene graph.
  + Simplified the implementation of LayoutManager sub-classes, and
    added support for animating a layout manager.
  + Allow short-circuiting some layout operations by setting a
    specific flag on ClutterActor.
  + Improve caching of the preferred size of a ClutterActor.
  + Allow declaring "internal children" for a ClutterContainer
    implementation: the memory management of these actors will be
    deferred entirely to the Container.
  + Let the ClutterStage honour the :opacity property and the alpha
    component of the stage color. This requires support in the
    Clutter backend used.
  + Improve Windows and OSX backends.
  + Simplify the feature detection code for OpenGL; this also
    reduced the required OpenGL version to 1.2.
  + Improve the matrix stack handling code. The matrices can be
    debugged by using the COGL_DEBUG environment variable, assuming
    that Clutter was compiled with the right configure-time switch.
  + Improve COGL API for draw buffers, and for offscreen buffer
    support.
  + Add support for text direction to ClutterActor.
  + Documentation, introspection and build fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 14 15:11:46 CET 2009 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.2:
  + Add ClutterLayoutManager, an abstract proxy class for easily
    writing layout management policies; also add ClutterLayoutMeta,
    a class for storing layout properties.
  + Add ClutterBox, a generic container actor that relies on a
    ClutterLayoutManager instance to manage the layout of its
    children.
  + Add the following layout managers:
    - ClutterFixedLayout - a layout manager implementing the policy
      used by ClutterGroup
    - ClutterBinLayout - a layout manager for packing actors as
      layers inside the same area, with per-actor alignment
    - ClutterFlowLayout - a layout manager arranging actors as a
      reflowing grid
    - ClutterBoxLayout - a layout manager arranging actors as a
      single line
  + Remove the requirement for the backend-specific implementation
    of ClutterStage to be a ClutterActor: a Stage implementation
    must only implement the ClutterStageWindow interface. This
    cleans up the backend code.
  + COGL source tree clean up and rationalization; COGL now knows
    the platform, and not only the driver (GL or GLES) so we can
    migrate part of the low-level backend code from Clutter to COGL
    where it makes sense.
  + Remove code duplication across whole COGL.
  + The GLES 2.0 driver for COGL, and the EGLX backend for Clutter
    have been fixed and confirmed working.
  + Add "dump-pick-buffer" to CLUTTER_DEBUG: this debug options
    dumps the contents of each pick() buffer into a PNG file, for
    debugging purposes.
  + Allow interpolating intervals of ClutterUnits for animating
    unit-based properties.
  + Increase strictness and correctness of the ClutterUnits grammar
    parser.
  + Add GValue transformation functions for ClutterPath to and from
    a string.
  + Fix word movement in ClutterText; implement GObject getter for
    :use-markup; emit notification for :position; decouple the
    :text property from the :use-markup property.
  + Do not queue redraws or relayouts on actors currently being
    destroyed.
  + Support #rrggbb and #rgb notations for ClutterColor.
  + Multiple bug fixes.
  + Provide _NET_WM_PID on the X11 stage implementation.
  + Documentation and Introspection annotation fixes.
  + Add test units for the ClutterActor size requesition.
  + Build fixes.
  + Use AM_SILENT_RULES if Automake 1.11 is detected, and fall back
    to Shave on older Automake versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    using the right vertex to perform the transformation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 31 20:29:43 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Remove Obsoletes for libclutter-glx-0_9-0.
- Drop clutter-rpmlintrc as it's not needed anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 29 15:03:25 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 1.0.0:
  + Allow per-stage disabling of motion event throttling; this
    should allow platforms or applications that require all the
    motion events not for drawing purposes to get them exactly like
    Clutter gets them from the windowing system.
  + Various documentation fixes.
  + Add per-word key navigation inside ClutterText.
  + Fix the RGB<->HLS conversion.
  + Various fixes for the OSX backend.
  + Various build-related fixes.
- Drop clutter-build-fix.patch: fixed upstream. Remove autoreconf
  call.
- Rename libclutter-glx-0_9-0 to libclutter-glx-1_0-0 and make it
  obsolete the old package.
- Add clutter-rpmlintrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 00:26:17 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 0.9.8:
  + Add more introspection annotations for language bindings.
  + Fix a bug in clutter_animation_set_alpha(), which also broke
    the clutter_actor_animate_with_alpha() function.
  + Check if the stage requires a relayout before showing it; this
    fixes a bug in the X11-based backends, especially under
    compositing window managers, where a 640x480 window would
    flicker before the default stage was shown for the first time.
  + Performance fixes for Cogl.
  + Sliced textures were broken by the COGL journalling.
  + Use the redraw cycle when asynchronously loading textures from
    files.
  + Miscellaneous compilation fixes for the OS X and Windows
    backends.
  + Allow querying from within the paint function of an Actor
    whether the actor is currently being directly painted or by a
    Clone actor.
  + In the GLX backend, when using the non-implicit sync-to-vblank
    inside glXSwapBuffers(), call glFinish() to avoid potential
    tearing.
- Changes from version 0.9.6:
  + Allow the manipulation of the actor's transformation matrix, so
    that is is possible to apply additional transformations in a
    way that is compatible with the transformations already applied
    by the scene graph.
  + Fix a race in the X11 backend that happened between resizing
    the stage drawable and the call to glViewport().
  + Merge the cogl-journal-batching branch; this branch implements
    batching the geometry of the elements of the scene graph before
    sending it to OpenGL, thus minimizing the number of state
    changes and improving the overall performance of Clutter-based
    applications.
  + Add more debugging states for Clutter and COGL, which allow the
    developer to track the state of the journal; to check the VBO
    fallback paths; to disable picking for reliable profiling; to
    disable software-side matrix transformations in favour of the
    driver/GPU ones.
  + Improve the ability to "break out" of COGL by using
    gl_begin/gl_end semantics; applications that drop into raw GL
    are, though, ignoring all the caching performed by COGL and
    might incur in performance issues.
  + Fixed the :load-async and :load-data-async properties of
    Texture by removing the unneeded G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT flag.
  + Added an initial migration guide that shows the porting process
    from older releases of Clutter to the 1.0 API; the first
    chapter deals with the migration from ClutterEffect to the new
    implicit animations API.
  + Fixed MT-safety for the master clock.
- Add clutter-build-fix.patch to fix build, and call autoreconf for
  it.
- Add xorg-x11-libXext-devel Requires in the devel package.

- Update to version 0.9.4:
  + Set the layout height in ClutterText, so that wrapping and
    ellipsization work correctly to fill all the allocated area.
  + Remove all the units-based API, and migrate all the positional
    and dimensional accessors to use floating point values when
    dealing with pixels. All the properties dealing with pixels now
    that a floating point value as well.
  + Add the ability to track wether an actor is going to be painted
    or not, using the "mapped" flag. This also allows Clutter to be
    more strict in the handling of the scenegraph, ensuring
    correctness and avoiding wasting resources on nodes that won't
    be painted.
  + Add debugging facilities for COGL, similar to those of Clutter;
    through them is also possible to have an on screen debugging
    mode that shows the boundaries of each rectangle sent to the
    GPU.
  + Rework "units" into real logical distance units that can be
    converted between millimeters, typographic points and ems into
    pixels.
  + Simplify the Animation class to avoid redundancy and the
    possibility of it going out of sync with the Timeline and Alpha
    instances it uses.
  + Move every operation into a single "master clock" source that
    advances the timelines, dispatches events and redraws the
    stages in a predictable sequence, thus avoiding unneeded
    redraws. The default is to follow the sync-to-vblank cycle, if
    it is supported by the drivers.
  + Cache the glyphs geometry into a vertex buffer object to avoid
    resubmitting too much information to the GPU.
  + Rework the behaviour of ClutterModel when a filter is applied.
  + Allow submitting premultiplied texture data; this removes the
    need for unpremultiplying data in CairoTexture.
  + Add a simple API for submitting blending and texture combining
    modes through a string description.
  + Move Timelines to pure time-based objects.
  + Lots of performance improvements.
  + Removal of all the deprecated API.
  + Removal of all the fixed point entry points.
  + Lots of documentation fixes - the coverage is now 99% of the
    exported 1600 symbols for Clutter and 80%+ of the 300 exported
    symbols for COGL.
  + Generate the GObject Introspection data for both Clutter and
    COGL at build time.
  + Build environment fixes.
