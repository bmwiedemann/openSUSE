  <title>Marko Horobchyk Font</title>
  <description>Marko Horobchyk is a brush-inspired typeface for children's literature.

As the name suggests (Horobchyk is Ukrainian for sparrow), the initial
idea was to create a typeface-companion for Marko the sparrow — a
cartoon character by illustrator and type designer Zhenya Spizhovyi.

Marko Horobchyk is simple and smooth, has special inner tension and
eye-catchy detailing. The letterforms are based on calligraphy and
sketches — this is what makes Marko Horobchyk lively, enchanting, and
amiable.

Marko Horobchyk will work best in medium to large sizes and captivating
headlines.
While it is technically optimised for better performance on screen,
carefully adjusted outlines promise good quality in print too.
