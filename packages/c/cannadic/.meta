  <title>Extension Dictionary for Canna</title>
  <description>This dictionary has been compiled as a supplement to the dictionaries
distributed with Canna3.5b2. It is based on Kana-Kanji conversion
dictionaries distributed under the GPL and Kana-Kanji conversion
distributed without restrictions. While using this dictionary, many
missing words have been successively added. Currently the main
dictionary and the suffix and prefix dictionary together contain about
130,000 words.</description>
