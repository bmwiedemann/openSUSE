%description
This package contains a static set of CA root certificates for
OpenSSL extracted from MozillaFirefox for use in containers. The
package pre-fills /var/lib/ca-certificates with a static set of
certificates if /var/lib/ca-certificates does not exist yet.

Therefore an upgrade of this package will NOT update the list of
root CA certificates in the system.

It it not possible to configure additional root CA certificates
using this package.

The package is only intended for use in containers that want to
avoid installing p11-kit.

For all other use cases please install the
"ca-certificates-mozilla" package.
