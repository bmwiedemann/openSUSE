Sat Jan  5 18:55:46 UTC 2019 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Updated to version 3.17.3:
  + Add support for TLS Server Name Indication (SNI). This enables
    the sending of your hostname, if available, to the server so
    that it can select the appropriate certificate for your
    domain. This is useful for servers which host multiple domains
    on the same IP address. This is a hidden Account preference,
    'use_tls_sni', and is enabled by default.
  + SSL/TLS certificate manager: The Delete key will now delete
    the selected certificate.
  + Window sizes are now remembered for the 'Apply tags' and
    SSL/TLS certificate manager windows.
  + Bug fixes:
    * claws#3519, 'Links including umlauts are broken'.
    * claws#4134, 'Save message to' option not set when it should
      be.
    * Prevent the Tools/SSL/TLS Certificates dialogue from
      crashing when certificate filenames contain a fingerprint.
    * Build on GNU Hurd.
    * Various build fixes when building without GnuTLS.
- Changes from version 3.17.2:
  + Message List: A context menu has been added to the column
    headers, it has two entries: a new option, 'Lock column
    headers', and 'Set displayed colums'.
  + Folder List:  A context menu has been added to the column
    headers, containing 'Set displayed columns'.
  + Preferences: The Display/Summaries option page has been split
    into three notebook pages: Folder List, Message List, and
    Defaults. The Message List page contains the new 'Lock column
    headers' option. The Defaults page contains several new
    options for new folders.
  + New Folder Properties: It is now possible to control signing
    and encrypting options on the Compose page. By default it
    follows the Account preferences, but they can be overridden to
    always sign and/or encrypt, or never sign/encrypt.
  + Saving sent messages: The global preference, 'Save sent
    messages', can now be overriden by the Folder Property and
    Account preferences. The global preference no longer needs to
    be activated for the Account Preference, 'Put sent messages
    in ...' option to function. Likewise, the Folder Property,
    'Save copy of outgoing messages to this folder instead of
    Sent', no longer relies on the global preference being set.
  + SSL/TLS certificates: The SHA-256 fingerprint is now
    displayed, and the MD5 fingerprint has been removed.
  + SSL/TLS certificates list: Status and Expiry columns have been
    added, and expired and invalid certificates are now clearly
    indicated.
  + QuickSearch: body searches are now quicker.
  + QuickSearch: symbols used in Extended searches are now
    expanded in the 'Edit' dialogue.
  + Re-editing: Flags and tags are now preserved when re-editing a
    message.
  + PDF Viewer plugin: Ctrl+scroll now zooms.
  + Tools: added cm-break.pl script, which breaks thread
    references for the selected messages; textviewer.pl has been
    updated and now requires perl 5.14.1.
  + The legacy "sylpheed-claws" symlink is no longer installed in
    the bindir.
  + Bug fixes:
    * claws#3418, 'Building on a Cross Compiling toolchain doesn't
      work'.
    * claws#3889, 'Address and quoted message inconsistent in
      reply'.
    * claws#4114, 'autogen.sh: Fix argument quoting'.
    * claws#4115, 'autogen: avoid unwarranted re-configure'.
    * claws#4120, 'New cert files are created in $HOME instead of
      in ~/.claws-mail/certs'.
    * claws#4121, 'Moving a subfolder in another folder erases its
      processing rules' (sic).
    * claws#4132, '"Mark all as (un)read" dialog appears when
      acting on 1 message only'.
    * claws#4133, 'trying to read message from an NNTP group (with
      all expired articles.'.
    * Regression where mail was not being checked at startup when
      it should have been.
    * Show correct address:port in SOCKS5 proxy connection failure
      message.
    * Prevent unexpected loss of drafted message.
    * Quicksearch eating keypresses it didn't handle.
    * Reply from mainwindow menu and toolbar when mainwindow's
      messageview is hidden.
    * CID 1438531 Fix wrong test leading to dead code.
    * CID 1439871 and validate Unicode char strictly.
    * CID 1439996 and remove unnecessary comparison.
    * RSSyl: lost processing rules when renaming folder.
    * Annoyance where your current reading is disturbed when a
      new msg is filtered into the current folder.
    * Don't leave the user in limbo when privacy system is 'none'
      and auto signing/encrypting is set.
    * Several memory leaks.
  + Translation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 16 13:31:23 UTC 2016 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to version 3.14.1:
  * 'hide_timezone', a new hidden preference that sets the timezone
    of date fields sent over the network to the unknown timezone
    value as specified in RFC 5322 ยง3.3.  Default value is false
    (i.e., send available timezone information).
  * 'rewrite_first_from', a new hidden preference which  works
    around a limitation of some servers with 'overly-liberal
    parsers'. When this is turned on and the
    Content-Transfer-Encoding is set to 8bit or 7bit, in a message
    body starting with 'From ' the 'From ' will become '=46rom '
    (i,e, encoded form of 'F') and the Content- Transfer-Encoding
    will be changed to Quoted-Printable. When it is turned off no
    such modification will be made but it is very likely that an
    MTA will convert the 'From ' to '>From '. See RFC 4155 for
    further details. Default value is '1', turned on.
  * Templates: it is now possible to attach a file, using
    '|attach_output{sub_expr}' or '|A{sub_expr}', 'sub_expr' is
    evaluated as a command-line to get the filename name from,
    using an absolute /path/to/filename.
  * IMAP mailboxes which show subscribed folders only are now
    indicated by a green folder icon.
    * The Icon Legend has had the missing folder icons added and
      also has an improved layout.
  * Drafted messages: Do not add Message-ID for draft, unless the
    message already has one. A Message-ID header is now only added
    when queuing a message, and any existing Message-ID and
    References headers in drafts, if there are any, are kept.
  * Disable hiding threads and messages in draft folders.
  * The /View/Go to/... actions now respect the 'Open message when
    selected' option.
  * In the UI 'POP' is used instead of 'POP3', 'IMAP' instead of
    'IMAP4', 'SSL/TLS' instead of 'SSL'.
  * GnuTLS: Enforce "strong enough" Diffie-Hellman prime even when
    using older versions of GnuTLS library.
    Since GnuTLS 3.1.7, this minimum size is dictated by the
    priority string, and currently (GnuTLS 3.3.0) the "safe-enough"
    value is 1008 bits. We set this minimum size explicitly for
    older GnuTLS versions.
    Users who are affected by this (their servers use DH prime
    smaller than 1008 bits) can override this by using a priority
    string starting with the keyword "LEGACY". However, this
    keyword only works with GnuTLS 3.3.0 or newer.
  * RSSyl plugin: Enable keeping old items by default.
  * vCalendar plugin: The ics file name is now used for the WebCal
    subscription folder name.
  * vCalendar plugin: Use hours/minutes for vcalendar alert time.
  * Notification plugin: Add support for unity/messaging menu.
  * PDF Viewer plugin: The icons are now themeable.
  * Updated manual in English and Spanish.
  * Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan, Czech,
    Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Indonesian, Italian,
    Norwegian Bokmรฅl, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish,
    Traditional Chinese, and Turkish.
  * Bug fixes:
    - bug 2918, 'Notification Popup icon is hardcoded'
    - bug 3207, 'Claws segfaults when closing LDAP-enabled address
      book'
    - bug 3515, 'Ctrl-Shift-X opens multiple external editors'

- Update to version 3.14.0:
  + Passwords can now be secured with a Master Passphrase.
  + Passwords: The password storage method has changed. All 
    passwords are now stored in a separate file, 
    (~/.claws-mail/passwordstorerc),
    and use a stronger encryption than previously. Existing 
    passwords are moved to the new file automatically, in the old 
    format. The new format will be used whenever old passwords are 
    changed or when a Master Passphrase is used. All new passwords 
    are saved using the new format, irrespective of whether a 
    Master Passphrase is used or not. Further information can be 
    found here:
    http://www.claws-mail.org/doc/password_encryption.txt
  + Compose window: Removed the outer scrollbar from header area.
  + Message view: The HTML to plain text converter now indicates 
    list items with a hyphen (-), adds a line break after , 
    and indents text within blockquotes.
  + Main window: Changed default /View/Show or hide/Menubar 
    shortcut to Ctrl+F12.
  + SSL certificates list: Added automatic scrollbar.
  + Address book: Double-clicking datasources now opens the edit
    dialogue. 
  + Forwarding: The external editor is now automatically used when
    forwarding as attachment, if the preference is set.
  + Preferences: Automatic mail checking can now be configured in
    hours, minutes and seconds.
  + Preferences: The 'next_on_delete' hidden preference now 
    applies to trashing or moving, in addition to deleting, a 
    message.
  + Command line: Added -geometry to set geometry for main window.
  + IMAP: Added SASL 'PLAIN' and 'LOGIN' authentication methods 
    for accounts. Renamed the old plaintext 'LOGIN' to 
    'plaintext'.
  + IMAP: The acccount preference, 'Move deleted mails to trash 
    and expunge immediately' has been removed.
  + Notification plugin: Added 'Get mail from account...' to the
    SysTray module's menu.
  + Notification plugin: Focus the widget between 
    iconify/deiconify events.
  + Tools: Added tools/cm-reparent.pl, which can be used to fix 
    thread parenting for two or more messages.

Mon Dec 21 18:12:02 UTC 2015 - kieltux@gmail.com

- update to version 3.13.1 (CVE-2015-8614, boo#959993):
  + When attaching files with no suffix, e.g. Makefile, the correct
    mime type is now found.
  + Added support for a whole range of extra TLDs.
  + 'โ' is used instead of '-->' in the Message List when sender is
    yourself. (Only visible if the hidden pref 'enable_swap_from'
    is set to 0.)
  + An external editor can now be embedded in the Compose window.
    This depends upon the 'Text editor' option (/Configuration/
    Preferences/Message View/External Programs) having a suitable
    value, such as 'gvim -f --socketid %w %s'.
  + Address Book: address books can now be searched.
  + A hidden pref has been added, 'next_on_delete'. This controls
    the message selection when a message is deleted. A setting of
    '0' which cause the previous, older message to be selected,
    a setting of '1' will cause the next, newer message to be
    selected.
  + PDF Viewer plugin: Support for encrypted (password protected)
    PDFs.
  + RSSyl plugin: The feed preferences window appearance has been
    improved.
  + The --enable-new-addrbook configure option has been renamed to
    --enable-alternate-addressbook.
  + Windows: Re-enabled regexps.
  + Updated man page.
  + Misc bugs fixed:
    - better fix for crash after broken pgp keyring update, and
      bogus EOF message on verifying sigs of missing keys
    - building on OpenBSD
    - libetpan version test
    - folder renaming for IMAP on Windows.

Thu Oct 15 16:25:39 UTC 2015 - kieltux@gmail.com

- update to version 3.13.0:
  + Preferences are now saved to disk immediately on pressing OK or
    Apply.
  + New preferences have been added for default sorting of the
    message lists. They are found in the 'Message list' frame of
    the Display/Summaries page of the general preferences. These
    options only apply to newly created folders.
  + The menu item 'Delete thread' has been moved to the Message
    menu. Previously clicking it would not delete the thread, but
    just move it to the Trash folder. Now it will delete the
    thread. An additional menu item has been added, 'Move thread to
    trash', which implements the original behaviour.
  + Compose window: By default it is no longer possible to add
    user-defined headers, with only those pre-defined in the drop
    down menus being possible. To restore the old behaviour, a new
    hidden preference has been added: 'type_any_header', setting
    this to 1 restores the old behaviour.
  + Automatic account selection is now also applied when you reply
    to one of your own messages, e.g. from the Sent folder.
  + Folder list: The Left and Right cursor keys now collapse or
    expand the currently selected folder tree item. The Left cursor
    key also moves the selection to parent folder, if current
    folder is within a collapsed tree.
  + Folder list: The Home and End keys now move the selection to
    the first folder and last folder in the tree.
  + Account Auto-configuration: when errors occur, a more detailed
    error message is shown.
  + GnuPG plugins:
    - An option has been added to specify the location of the GnuPG
      executable.
    - A new hidden preference has been added which limits the
      number of results returned when using your keyring for
      address auto-completion: 'autocompletion_limit'. The default
      value is 0, which means there is no limit, any other number
      will limit the results to that number.
  + Python plugin: Folder has been added to MessageInfo objects.
  + The GeoLocation plugin is no longer included.
  + The user manual has been updated.
  + The man page has been updated.
  + Misc bugs fixed:
    - make 'date' (not thread date) the default sort when
      clicking column header to switch to date sort.
    - Several memory leaks in RSSyl.
    - IPv6 now works on Windows, for connections not handled by
	  libetpan.
    - GPG preferences initialization.
    - Possible crash when gpg is upgraded to gpg-v21 
    - Save temporary file in mime temporary directory when using
	  right-click/Open image instead of saving in current working
	  directory.
    - Crash in address completion when matching group name.
    - Correct handling of RFC3339 timestamp format with second
	  fraction.
    - Building on GLib older than 2.25.
  + Bugs fixed: claws#2115, claws#3209, claws#3253, claws#3263,
    claws#3296, claws#3352, claws#3454, claws#3473, claws#3475,

  + SSLv3 server connections are now disabled by default, in
    response to the POODLE vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566).
  + Several PGP/Core plugin improvements:
    - Indicate when a key has been revoked or has expired when
      displaying signature status.
    - When displaying the full information, show the Validity, and
      the Owner Trust level. Also indicate expired and revoked
      keys, and revoked UIDs.
    - The "Content-Disposition: attachment" flag in PGP/MIME signed
      messages has been removed. It was confusing for cetain MUAs.
  + A new version of the RSSyl plugin, completely redesigned and
    rewritten.
  + The results of TAB address completion in the Compose window
    have improved ordering.
  + Due to popular demand, use of the Up key in the message body in
    the Compose window stops at the top of the message body and
    does not continue up to the header fields. This reverts the
    behaviour introduced in version 3.10.0.
  + In the Compose window, when navigating with the arrow keys,
    selecting, and thus modifying, the Account selector is now
    prevented.
  + In the Compose window, a mnemonic (s) has been added to the
    Subject line.

  + A new QuickSearch filter has been added that searches a
    header's content only.
  + A Reply-To field has been added to the main Template
    configuration.

- update to 3.10.0 
  - Complete SSL certificate chains are now saved, and if built with
    Libetpan 1.4.1, the IMAP SSL connection's certificate chain is made
    available. Both of these allow correct certificate verification
    instead of a bogus 'No certificate issuer found' status.
  - Auto-configuration of account email servers, based on SRV records,
    is now possible. (GLib >= 2.22 is required.)
  - Added a preference to avoid automatically drafting emails that are
    to be sent encrypted, (Configuration/Preferences/Compose/Writing).

    Drafts folder, in order to draw the attention to unfinished mails
    there.
  - It is now possible to add a 'Replace signature' button to the
    Compose window toolbar.
  - Quotation wrapping and undo/redo in the Compose window has been
    improved.

    agent header' and applies to both X-Mailer and X-Newsreader headers.
  - Added hidden preferences, 'address_search_wildcard' and
    'folder_search_wildcard', to choose between matching from start of
    the folder name/address or any part of the name. (Activating these
    options restores the previous behaviour.)
  - Added hidden preference 'enable_avatars' to control the internal
    capture/render process, and which allows disabling it by external
    plugins for example.
  - 'Check for new folders' now only updates the folder list, not
    updating the contents of folders. If needed, it can be followed by
    'Check for new messages'
  - When using Redirect, the redirecting account's address is used in
    the SMTP MAIL FROM instead of the original sender's address.

    completion.

    dialogue. See the option 'Warn when Subject is empty' option on
    the '/Configuration/Preferences/Mail handling/Sending' page.
  + When sending messages, if the hostname cannot be determined,
    fallback to 'localhost' rather than 'unknown', as the latter is
    rejected by some servers.
  + Added better handling of messages from broken mailers, such as
    yahoo groups.
  + PDF plugin: the minimum required version of poppler is 0.12.0.
  + PGP/* plugin: long key IDs are now displayed in the dialogues

Wed Feb 27 12:01:20 CET 2008 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to version 3.3.1, update is based on package from BS
  * Forbid attaching anything containing "../" or ".ssh/" in mailto:
    URIs.
  * Add a hidden preference, 'use_networkmanager', to disable
    NetworkManager handling
  * Due to licensing problems, the ClamAV plugin has been removed
  * Added NetworkManager support
  * Added DIGEST-MD5 support for IMAP authentication
  * Added Folder Properties option, 'Run processing rules when opening'
    to the General page.
  * Added sub-sorting to the Message List; when the Sort type is either
    Subject, From, To or Tags, sub-sorting by Date will be active.
  * Added from=address to the mailto sequence
    The 'from' will try to select the first matching account in the
    Accounts list, otherwise it will use the usual account selection
    mechanism but will override it with the given 'from' address.
  * Added insert=FILE  to the mailto sequence (stands for 'insert file')
    This adds the ability to create a new message from the command-line,
    with the body set from the contents of an existing file.
  * Added mailto with NNTP accounts
    This comes into play if mailto is used when an NNTP account is the
    default account or if an NNTP account address is used with 'from'.
  * Added several GUI improvements to the Filtering, Processing, Tags,
    Actions, Templates, Logging and Address Book dialogues
  * Added a tooltip to the 'replied' icon in the Message List which
    indicates 'click to see your reply' feature.
  * Added 'claws-mail --version-full' to display the version and a list
    of the compiled-in features
  * Implemented speed-ups to list operations, deletions and cache
    updates.
  * Updated the man page
  * The Trayicon plugin icons are now themable.
  * text/calendar message parts are now automatically displayed if a
    plugin handling text/calendar is loaded, e.g. vCalendar.
