  <title>Unicode Version of the Computer Modern Fonts</title>
  <description>Computer Modern Unicode fonts were converted from metafont sources
using [1] textrace and [2] pfaedit (030404). Their main purpose is to
create free good quality fonts for use in X Window System applications
supporting many languages. Currently the fonts contain glyphs from
Latin1 (Metafont ec, tc), Cyrillic (la, rx) and Greek (cbgreek when
available) code sets.
