- Corrected project URL in spec file to match the changed upstream
  location as-of May 30th 2020.

  Noted the project URL change in README.SUSE without removing the old URL
  because it represents the location the project source was obtained from.
  The next project source update is available from the new project URL. When
  the package is updated with that source all URL project references will be
  modified to only show the new URL.

  Add crash-update-whitepaper-URL.patch
  Note change of no longer valid old project whitepaper URL to current valid
  project whitepaper URL in help output. Leave the old one reported because it
  represents the location the project source was obtained from for this
  package version.

- Add crash-verify-exception-frame-accessible-for-all-verify-requests.patch
  In calls to search a stack for x86_64 exceptions a flag is used
  to request the stack be verified for room to contain saved
  registers. The verify is not performed if other flags are used
  in the same call. Fixing this exposes another bug where only a
  kernel stack is verified anyway, even if the exception is being
  searched for on a userspace stack. Patch fixes both problems.

Tue Feb  4 15:50:22 UTC 2020 - David Mair <dmair@suse.com>

- Upgraded the source to version 7.2.8. The previous version was
  modified to support newer kernels used in SLE-15-SP2 but was not
  complete.
  * Includes a fix for kernels that contain:
      e0703556644a531e50b5dc61b9f6ea83af5f6604
    which introduces symbol namespaces. Without the change then
    depending on architecture:
     (1) the kernel module symbol list will contain garbage
     (2) the session fails during initialization with a dump of
         the internal buffer allocation stats followed by the
         message "crash: cannot allocate any more memory"
     (3) the session fails during initialization with a
         segmentation violation (bsc#1162064)
  * Includes the merge of the S390x patches since crash 7.2.7
    (bsc#1156645/bsc#1161640)
  * Source already includes XZ compressed module support, removed:
      crash-symbols-add-support-for-XZ.patch
  * Refreshed patches that were no longer aligned with source:
      crash-allow-use-of-sadump-captured-KASLR-kernel.patch
      crash-s390-autodetect-kaslr.patch
      crash-sles9-time.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upgraded the source tarball to version 7.2.7. This is required
  to support coredumps from currently used kernel versions in the
  product (bsc#1159686).
- droped the patch obsoleted due to already being present in the
  new source:
  * crash-allow-kmem-section-is-early.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 12 19:39:11 UTC 2019 - David Mair <dmair@suse.com>

- Added commit c0371f6ee2cae31ec9f506bbd231ab8fbe334c13 - Fix to
  allow live analysis of s390x kernels that have been configured

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 19 20:42:50 UTC 2018 - dmair@suse.com

- Upgraded to 7.2.1 because it includes the fixes to support
  several core cases that recently were caused tofail to open.
  As a result, removed patches that were already superceded by

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 14 22:32:42 UTC 2017 - dmair@suse.com

- Upgrade the source tarball to version to 7.2.0 which requires the
  removal of patches that are then already applied:

  crash-gdb-add-proc_service-sync-with-GLIBC.patch
  crash-xen_add_support_for_domU_with_linux_kernel_from_3.19.patch

  A complete changelog is available via the crash source page at:

  http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog.html

  Added crash-ppc64-book3s-update-hash-page-table-geometry.patch
  from hbathini@linux.vnet.ibm.com via bsc#1067702 to correct
  errors with virtual-to-physical address translation in the larger
  virtual address range of newer kernels.

  Added a BuildRequires of libelf that will populate the build
  workspace with libelf (from elfutils) even though it is not
  directly required by crash but is required by gdb (which crash
  nests). It no longer got picked up automatically for build and
  gdb and kernel module features had build errors before it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  9 14:43:20 UTC 2017 - dmair@suse.com

- crash-xen_add_support_for_domU_with_linux_kernel_from_3.19.patch:
  Since linux kernel 3.19 crash readmem() can't be used to read
  xen_p2m_addr associate memory directly during m2p translation.
  PV domU p2m mapping is also stored at xd->xfd + xch_index_offset
  and organized as struct xen_dumpcore_p2m. This patch implements
  a special reading function read_xc_p2m() to extract the mfns
  from xd->xfd + xch_index_offset and makes and crash support Xen
  PV domU dumpfiles for kernel 3.19 and later (bsc#1043501).

- crash source nests gdb source but gdb has a new build error on
  Factory due to the bug and build environment modifications. The
  fix is upstream gdb but not upstream crash's gdb.

  Created crash patch:

  crash-gdb-add-proc_service-sync-with-GLIBC.patch

  to create the gdb patch in expanded crash and added to the gdb
  Makefile patch it's application. Resolves the build error.

- Upgrade of source tarball to 7.1.7 from upstream, removal of
  crash-kernel-4.7.patch (source includes it) and refresh of other
  patches to align with the version. For a detailed changelog of
  the source tarball see:

  http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog.html

  Feature enhancements included from 7.1.6:

  - Introduction of support for "live" ramdump files, such as those
    that are specified by the latest QEMU version's mem-path
    argument of a memory-backend-file  object, e.g.:

    $ qemu-kvm ...other-options... \
      -object memory-backend-file,id=MEM,size=128m,mem-path=/tmp/MEM,share=on \
      -numa node,memdev=MEM -m 128

    and a live session run can be run against the guest kernel like so:

             $ crash <path-to-guest-vmlinux> live:/tmp/MEM@0

  - Implemented support for the redesigned ARM64 kernel virtual
    memory layout that was introduced in Linux 4.6. Plus ARM64
    support for 4k pages with 4-level page tables and 48 VA bits.
    NB: On live systems automatic operation with Linux 4.6 ARM64
    kernels requires that CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE is not configured.
    If it is configured then use with a live system requires two
    --machdep arguments, e.g.:

      --machdep phys_offset=<base physical address>
      --machdep kimage_voffset=<kernel kimage_voffset value>

  - Improvement of the ARM64 bt -f display so that, for most cases,
    the stack frame delimiter will be the location of the old FP
    and LR pair.

  - New bt -v option that checks all tasks for evidence of stack
    overflows.

  - Incorporation of an alternative stack backtrace mathod
    accessed directly using bt -o and the default method can be
    toggled between the two using bt -O.

  - Fix for the case where the sym/dis commands fail for a symbol
    name that is composed entirely of hexadecimal characters and
    was previously interpreted as an address.

  - Determine structure member data if the member is contained in
    an anonymous structure or union (no longer necessary to use a]
    discrete gdb "printf" command to find the offset of it).

  - Session initialization speed up.

  - Addition of "list -S" and "tree -S" options (similar to the -s
    option of each command) where member values are read from
    memory instead of being interpreting gdb output (much faster
    behavior for 1-, 2-, 4- and 8-byte members).

  - Fix to recognize x86_64 Linux 4.8-rc1 and later kernels that
    are configured with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY.

  - Support for PPC64 virtual address translation of radix MMU.

  - Improvement of "dev -d" output to display I/O statistics for
    devices that use the blk-mq interface.

  Feature enhancements included from 7.1.7:

  - Restore x86_64 "dis" command's symbol translation for call or
    jump target addresses for kernels configured with
    CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE.

  - Re-factor of the trace extension module to locate all of the
    ftrace buffers and extracts data from each of them rather than
    only the primary one.

  - Support for s390x CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK configuration so
    that "bt" command no longer shows incomplete output.

  - Support for live ARM64 kernels from Linux 4.6 that have the
    kernel image loaded anywhere in physical memory.

  - Update of /dev/crash/kernel driver to v1.3 which adds support
    Linux 4.6 and later ARM64 kernels configured with
    CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY and S390x kernels that use
    xlate_dev_mem_ptr() and unxlate_dev_mem_ptr() rather than
    kmap() and kunmap().

 - refresh eppic-support-arm64.patch crash-debuginfo-compressed.patch

  adjust for git host changes in eppic-switch-to-system-lib.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 27 16:29:33 UTC 2015 - dmair@suse.com

- Upgrade to 7.1.1 from upstream. At the time of writing the only
  published changelog was supplied by e-mail list and is as follows

  - Fix for two minor issues with the "net" command.  Without the patch,
   the "net -a" option appends its correct output with the command's 
   "Usage:" message; and if either the "net -x" or "net -d" options are
   used without also specifying "-s" or "-S", the error message would
   indicate "net: illegal flag: 800000" or "net: illegal flag: 1000000"
   instead of showing the command's "Usage:" message.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - If the kernel (live or dumpfile) has the TAINT_LIVEPATCH bit set, or
   if the Red Hat "kpatch" module is installed, the tag "[LIVEPATCH]" 
   will be displayed next to the kernel name in the initial system 
   banner and by the "sys" command.  This new tag replaces the 
   "[KPATCH]" tag that was introduced in crash-7.0.7.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Addressed three Coverity Scan complaints in vmware_vmss.c:
     50:leaked_storage: Variable "fp" going out of scope leaks the 
        storage it points to.
     53:leaked_storage: Variable "fp" going out of scope leaks the 
        storage it points to.
    256:warning: Use of memory after it is freed 
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Remove the LKCD-only "propeller spinner" seen when a dumpfile read 
   requires more than 2048 page header accesses.  This was put in place
   because of the non-random-access design of LKCD dumpfiles.  Without 
   the patch, the spinner display is intermingled with command output, 
   which complicates the parsing of the output.
   (watters.sam@gmail.com)

 - Fix to support the Linux version increment from 3 to 4.  Without the
   patch, both dumpfile and live sessions fail during initialization,
   issuing the message "WARNING: kernel version inconsistency between 
   vmlinux and dumpfile" or "WARNING: kernel version inconsistency 
   between vmlinux and live memory", followed by the nonsensical fatal
   error message "crash: incompatible arguments:  vmlinux is not SMP -- 
   vmcore is SMP" or "crash: incompatible arguments:  vmlinux is not 
   SMP -- live system is SMP".  To prevent unexpected kernel version
   bumps in the future, support has been added for version 5.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Add support for more than 16TB of physical memory space in the SADUMP
   dumpfile format.  Without the patch, there is a limitation caused
   by several 32-bit members of dump_header structure, in particular
   the max_mapnr member, which overflows if the dumpfile contains more
   than 16TB of physical memory space.  The header_version member of
   the dump_header structure has been increased from 0 to 1 in this 
   extended new format, and the new 64-bit members will be used.
   (d.hatayama@jp.fujitsu.com)

 - Fix for command lines that are redirected to a pipe.  Without the
   patch, if an external piped-to command contains a quoted string that 
   includes a "|" character, the command fails with the message "crash: 
   pipe operation failed".
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for insecure temporary file usage in _rl_tropen() as reported by
   readline library CVE-2014-2524.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - When the gdb-<version>.patch file has changed and a rebuild is 
   done from within a previously-existing build tree, the "patch -N" 
   option is used to ignore patches that have been previously applied; 
   this patch also applies the "patch -r-" option to prevent unnecessary
   .rej files from being created.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix to account for Xen hypervisor's "domain" structure member name
   change from "is_paused_by_controller" to "controller_pause_count".
   Without the patch, in Xen 4.2.5 and later, the crash session fails
   during initialization with the error message 'crash: invalid 
   structure member offset: domain_is_paused_by_controller".
   (dietmar.hahn@ts.fujitsu.com)

 - During initialization, reject useless ARM64 "(A)" and "(a)" absolute
   symbols that are below the text region.  Without the patch, several
   recently-introduced absolute symbols have been introduced into the
   kernel, which will be displayed by "sym -l" prior to the first kernel
   virtual address symbol, and will show up in command output where 
   memory values are translated into kernel symbol references.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for ARM64 kernels to account for changes in the virtual memory
   layout introduced in Linux 3.17.  The vmalloc region end address, and
   the vmemmap start and end addresses are now calculated at kernel 
   build time, because they depend upon the size of a struct page.
   Accordingly, the crash utility needs to calculate those three address
   values dynamically, after the embedded gdb module has initialized.
   Without the patch, reads of page structures return invalid data due 
   to incorrect virtual-to-physical translations of memory in the
   vmemmap range.  This in turn causes commands that require page 
   structure contents to fail or show invalid data, such as "kmem -p", 
   "kmem -[sS]", and the "kmem -[fF]" options.
   (anderson@redhat.com)
 
 - Fix to support ELF vmcore dumpfiles whose PT_LOAD file offset values
   of their respective memory segments are not laid out sequentially 
   from low to high in the dumpfile.  This has only been seen in ELF 
   dumpfiles created by VMware's "vmss2core -M" facility.  Without the
   patch, the crash session may fail during initialization, either with
   the message "cannot malloc ELF header buffer", or "crash: <dumpfile>:
   not a supported file format".
   (anderson@redhat.com)
 
 - Enhancement to the support of VMware .vmss suspended state dumpfiles.
   There may be holes in the memory address saved for PCI, etc.  In such
   cases, the memory dump is divided into regions.  With this patch, up 
   to 3 memory regions are supported.
   (hfu@vmware.com)

 - Fortified the error handling of task gathering from the pid_hash[] 
   chains during session initialization.  If a chain has been corrupted,
   the patch prevents the sequence from entering an infinite loop, and 
   the error messages associated with corrupt/invalid chains have been
   updated to report the pid_hash[] index number.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Implemented a new STRDUPBUF() utility that will duplicate an existing
   string into a buffer allocated with GETBUF().  As is the case with
   any buffer allocated with GETBUF(), it is only meant to exist during
   the life-span of the current command.  If it is not explicitly freed
   via FREEBUF(), then it will be freed automatically prior to the next 
   command.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Implemented a new fill_struct_member_data() function that gathers
   a bundle of data that describes a structure member.  The function
   receives a pointer to a struct_member_data structure, in which the
   caller has initialized the "structure" and "member" name pointers:
    
     struct struct_member_data {
             char *structure;
             char *member;
             long type;
             long unsigned_type;
             long length;
             long offset;
             long bitpos;
             long bitsize;
     };

   A gdb "printm" command is crafted using those two fields, and the
   output of the command is used to initialize the remaining six fields.
   Adapted from Qiao Nuohan's "pstruct" extension module.
   (anderson@redhat.com, qiaonuohan@cn.fujitsu.com)

 - Implemented a new "runq -c cpu(s)" option to display the run queue
   data of specified cpus.  It can be used in conjunction with all runq
   command options.  The cpus must be specified in a comma- and/or 
   dash-separated list; for examples, "3", "1,8,9", "1-23", or "1,8-15".
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Build extension modules that utilize the generic extensions/Makefile
   with -g.  In addition, build the snap.c extension module with -g.
   (rabinv@axis.com)

 - Several fixes, updates, and enhancements for 32-bit MIPS support:
     (1) The MIPS general purpose registers in the elf_gregset_t 
         don't start at index 0 but at index 6.
     (2) Adjust for the kernel's pt_regs structure changes between
         kernel versions.  For example, fields are inserted into the 
         middle based on build time options, and the amount of padding
         at the head of the structure was changed relatively recently.
         To handle this, split the structure definition into two parts
         and get the offsets of these two parts dynamically.
     (3) Do not display each parsed kernel symbol during initialization 
         when invoked with "crash -d8".
     (4) Add support for loading raw MIPS ramdump dumpfiles. 
     (5) Add support for compressed kdump dumpfiles.
   (rabinv@axis.com)

 - Fix for a typo in "help foreach", and a fix for a spelling error in 
   "help input".
   (weijg.fnst@cn.fujitsu.com)

 - Fix for "and and" and "the the" typos in the README file. 
   (weijg.fnst@cn.fujitsu.com)

 - Fix to address the Xen 4.5.0 hypervisor symbol name change from 
   "dom0" to "hardware_domain".  Without the patch, the crash session
   fails with the error message "crash: cannot resolve: dom0".
   (dslutz@verizon.com)
   
 - Fix for a regression in crash-7.1.0 that causes failures when the 
   "crash -t" option is run on a live system, and when analyzing remote
   Linux kernels.  Without the patch, "crash -t" on a live system fails
   with the message "crash: cannot open remote memory source: /dev/mem", 
   and attempts to analyze a Linux kernel remotely just shows the kernel 
   timestamp and exits immediately. 
   (dslutz@verizon.com, anderson@redhat.com)

 - Speed up the session invocation time of "flattened" format dumpfiles
   created by the makedumpfile(8) facility.  When sorting the blocks of
   memory by their intended ELF or compressed kdump file offsets, the
   patch replaces the bubble-sort method that is currently used with an
   insertion sort method. 
   (dslutz@verizon.com)

 - Remove the non-existent "-L" option from the "ps" command's mutually-
   exclusive options error message.
   (vvs@parallels.com)

 - Fix for the "irq", "mount", "kmem -p" and "kmem -v" commands when
   they are used in an input file.  If more than one of any of those 
   four commands are used in an input file, the output of the second 
   and subsequent command instances will not display their respective 
   command headers.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Implemented a new "kmem -m" option that is similar to "kmem -p",
   but it allows the user to specify the page struct members to be 
   displayed.  The option takes a comma-separated list of one or 
   more page struct members, which will be displayed following the
   page structure address.  The "flags" member will always be expressed
   in hexadecimal format, and the "_count" and "_mapcount" members will
   always be expressed in decimal format.  Otherwise, all other members
   will be displayed in hexadecimal format unless the current output 
   radix is 10 and the member is a signed/unsigned integer.  Members 
   that are data structures may be specified by the data structure's 
   member name, or expanded to specify a member of that data structure.
   For example, "-m lru" refers to a list_head data structure, in which
   case both the list_head.next and list_head.prev pointer values will
   be displayed; if "-m lru.next" is specified, just the list_head.next
   value will be displayed.
   (atomlin@redhat.com, anderson@redhat.com)

 - Support enhancement for the 32-bit MIPS architecture that retrieves
   the per-cpu registers from the NT_PRSTATUS notes stored in the header
   of compressed kdump dumpfiles.
   (rabinv@axis.com)

 - Fix to remove an invalid warning message on ARM64 if a crash session
   is invoked with the "-d<number>" debug flag.  Without the patch, 
   the invalid message is "WARNING: SPARSEMEM_EX: questionable section 
   values".
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Remove the leftover ".constructor" build file in the extensions 
   subdirectory when "make extensions" is complete, and update the
   top-level .gitignore file to ignore post-build extensions 
   subdirectory files.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for a segmentation violation generated by the "help -[n|D]" 
   options on ARM64 compressed kdumps.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Additional output for the "help [-D|-n]" options on ARM64.  For ELF
   kdump vmcores and compressed kdumps, the elf_prstatus structure in
   each NT_PRSTATUS note will be translated. 
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - The "help -r" option has been extended to dump the ARM64 registers
   stored in each per-cpu NT_PRSTATUS note in compressed kdump and
   ELF kdump dumpfiles.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for the ARM64 page size determination on Linux 4.1 and later 
   kernels.  Without the patch, the crash session fails during
   initialization with the message "crash: invalid/unsupported page 
   size: 98304" on kernels with 64K pages.  On kernels with 4K pages,
   the message is "crash: invalid/unsupported page size: 6144".  In
   addition, the "-p <page-size>" command line override option 
   had no effect on ARM64; that has been fixed as well.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for the DATE display in the initial system banner and by the
   "sys" command to account for the Linux 3.17 change that moved
   the "timekeeper" symbol and structure into a containing tk_core
   structure; the "shadow_timekeeper" timekeeper will be used as an
   alternative.  Without the patch, the DATE shows something within
   a few hours of the Linux epoch, such as "Wed Dec 31 18:00:00 1969".
   (kmcmartin@redhat.com)

 - Fixes for the translation of ARM64 PTEs, as displayed by the "vm -p"
   and "vtop" commands.  Without the patch, if "vm -p" references a 
   swapped-out page on Linux 4.0 and later kernels, the SWAP location 
   may indicate "(unknown swap location)", and will show an invalid 
   OFFSET value; on Linux 3.13 and later kernels, running "vtop" on a 
   user virtual address incorrectly translates the PTE contents of 
   swapped out pages by showing a PHYSICAL address and FLAGS translation
   instead of the SWAP device and OFFSET.  It is possible that there may
   be PTE bit translation errors on other kernel versions; the patch 
   addresses the changes in ARM64 PTE bit definitions made in Linux
   3.11, 3.13, and 4.0 kernels.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Enhanced the "struct.member" display capability of the "struct", 
   "union", "task", "list" and "tree" commands.  If a specified 
   structure member contains an embedded structure, the output may 
   be restricted to just the embedded structure by expressing the 
   .member argument as "member.member".  If a specified structure 
   member is an array, the output may be restricted to a single array
   element by expressing the .member argument as "member[index]".  
   Furthermore, these embedded member specifications may extend beyond
   one level deep, for example, by expressing the member argument as 
   "member.member.member", or "member[index].member".
   (Alexandr_Terekhov@epam.com, anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for any command that passes strings to gdb for evaluation,
   where the string contains a parentheses-within-parentheses 
   expression along with a ">" or ">>" operator inside the outermost
   set of parentheses.  Without the patch, a command such as the
   following fails like so: 

     crash> p ((1+1) >> 1)
     p: gdb request failed: p ((1+1)
     crash>

  (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for the handling of ARM64 kernel module per-cpu symbols.  Without
   the patch, if the debuginfo data of an ARM64 kernel module that 
   contains a per-cpu section is loaded by "mod -s <module>" or 
   "mod -S", commands such as "bt" or "sym" may incorrectly translate 
   the module's virtual addresses to symbol names.

   member offset: cfs_rq_throttled".
   (vinayakm.list@gmail.com)

 - Add support for Xen PVH guest types introduced in Xen 4.4.  Without
   the patch, running against a Xen 4.4 hypervisor binary would fail 
   during session initialization with the error message "crash: invalid 
   structure member offset: domain_is_hvm".  In addition, the PVH guest
   type is being registered internally as an HVM guest type, the debug
   "help -X ofs" command's display of the domain_domain_flags offset
   has been fixed to show it in decimal, and the setting of the internal
   dc->domain_flags has been fixed to contain all flags set, not just 
   the first one found.

 - Fix for the "kmem -S" command on Linux 3.1 and later kernels that are
   configured with CONFIG_SLUB.  Because the the page structure's inuse 
   and objects fields used by SLUB were changed from discrete u16 types
   to bit-fields within an unsigned int, the display of per-node partial 
   slab statistics are incorrect.  Without the patch, the TOTAL and 
   ALLOCATED values are incorrectly shown as equal values, and therefore
   the FREE value is always zero.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for the "kmem -S" command for kernels that are configured with 
   CONFIG_SLUB.  Eash per-cpu slab object dump may show incorrect 
   ALLOCATED and FREE values; and as seen on Linux 3.5 and later 
   kernels, the TOTAL value and the number of individual objects dumped
   may also be incorrect (too small).
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - When executing the commands from an input file specified by the 
   "-i <file>" command line option, or when accepting input from a 
   file as a set of commands or as a set of command arguments using the
   "<" redirection character, unconditionally cease the operation if 
   CTRL-c is entered.  Without the patch, depending upon the command
   that was running when the SIGINT was received, the operation may 
   continue uninterruptibly until the file contents are consumed.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Enhanced the "bt -F" option such that if "-F" is entered twice,
   and if the stack frame contents reference a slab cache object, both 
   the slab cache name and the stack contents will be displayed within 
   brackets.
   (anderson@redhat.com)
 
 - Enhanced the "rd -S" option such that if "-S" is entered twice,
   and if the memory contents reference a slab cache object, both the 
   slab cache name and the memory contents will be displayed within 
   brackets. 
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for the X86_64 "bt" command to prevent an unwarranted message
   indicating "WARNING: possibly bogus exception frame" generated
   from a blocked kernel thread that was in the process of exec'ing
   a user process via the call_usermodehelper() facility.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for the X86_64 "bt" command to more correctly determine the 
   function frame that called into an interrupted function.  Without 
   the patch, the first frame just above an IRQ exception frame
   register dump may show an invalid/stale function.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for the X86_64 "bt" command if a page fault exception was
   generated by the invalid contents of the RIP register.  Without 
   the patch, the exception frame register dump is not displayed
   above the "page_fault" stack frame; and in a related issue, the
   "bt -e" option will not find and display the exception frame.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - When invoking a crash session with a compressed vmlinux file,
   make the same host-machine/vmlinux endian verification that is 
   done with uncompressed vmlinx files.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Reduce the number of CTRL-c entries required to unconditionally
   terminate any manually-entered command from three to one.
   (anderson@redhat.com)

 - Fix for the X86_64 "bt" command if an async page fault exception
   occurred in a KVM guest running a Linux 2.6.38 or later kernel.
   Without the patch, the exception frame register dump is not displayed
   above the "async_page_fault" stack frame.

- Implementation of 7.0.4 from upstream and patch refresh.

- Fix for the "ps" command's display of per-task RSS and %MEM values 
  in Linux 2.6.34 and later kernels in which SPLIT_RSS_COUNTING is
  enabled.  Without the patch, the values are only taken from each 
  task's mm_struct.rss_stat structure, which may contain stale values
  because they may not be synchronized with the RSS values stored
  in each per-thread task_struct.rss_stat structure; this may lead
  to invalid or slightly low RSS values, and worst-case, the %MEM
  value may show garbage percentage values.
  (vinayakm.list@gmail.com)

- Addressed a few (harmless) Coverity Scan complaints in diskdump.c:

  when the snappy library is built in:
    diskdump.c:1046: warning: passing argument 3 of 
      'snappy_uncompressed_length' from incompatible pointer type
      /usr/include/snappy-c.h:120: note: expected ‘size_t *’ but argument

    diskdump.c:1056: warning: passing argument 4 of ‘snappy_uncompress’ 
      from incompatible pointer type
      /usr/include/snappy-c.h:103: note: expected ‘size_t *’ but argument
      is of type ‘ulong *’
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Created a simpler interface with the internal do_list() function.
  Currently, if a caller wants to gather the contents of a list into
  an array, it must do the following:

  (1) call hq_open() so that the list contents will be verified and
      saved in the hash queue
  (2) call do_list() to store the list in the hash queue and return
      the number of entries in the list
  (3) allocate a buffer to store the array of entries in the list
  (4) pass the allocated buffer to retrieve_list() to be populated 
      from the hash queue
  (5) call hq_close()

  With this patch, if the passed-in list_data.flags field has a new  
  LIST_ALLOCATE bit set, then do_list() will perform steps (1), (3), 
  (4) and (5) above.  The caller can access the allocated array via
  a new list_data.list_ptr member, and, when done parsing the list,
  the allocated buffer should be returned via FREEBUF().  The only 
  restriction is that the hash queue cannot be currently in use, or
  the do_list() call will fail.  It should also be noted that there
  are circumstances where it still makes sense that steps (1), (3), 
  (4) and (5) are performed by the do_list() caller.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Modified the internal parent_list() function, used by "ps -p", to 
  utilize the simpler new do_list() functionality described above.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Modified the internal dump_vmap_area() function, used by the 
  "kmem -v", "kmem <address>" and "search" commands, to utilize

  "mount" and "files -d" commands, to utilize the simpler new 
  do_list() functionality.

- Modified the internal get_kmem_cache_list() function, used by the 
  "kmem -[sS]", "kmem <address>", "rd -S" and "bf -F" commands,

  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Modified the internal show_net_devices_v2() and show_net_devices_v3()
  functions, used by the "net" command, to utilize the simpler new 
  do_list() functionality.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- The "help -r" option has been extended to dump the X86 and X86_64 
  registers stored in the NT_PRSTATUS notes in netdump ELF, kdump ELF,
  and compressed kdump dumpfiles.  Without the patch, the option only 
  supports ELF dumpfiles created by the "virsh dump --memory-only"
  facility.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Modified the "runq -g" display to show the CFS task_group and cfs_rq 
  addresses; also the current task is also displayed in its CFS or RT
  queue with with the notation "[CURRENT]" appended to the task data. 
  (Anthony.Chen@Teradata.com)

- Additional modification to the "runq -g" to display the task_group
  and rt_rq addresses for the RT queues, similar in nature to the CFS
  queue changes are done by the patch above.  In addition, the CFS 
  rb_root and RT prio_array addresses are no longer shown given that 
  they can be determined by looking at the cfs_rq and rt_rq structures
  whose addresses are now displayed. 
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Modified the behavior of the "mod -t" option when running against
  Linux 2.6.18 and earlier kernels such that the hexadecimal value of
  the module->license_gplok member is always displayed.  Without the
  patch, if a module's license_gplok boolean or bitmask value is 0,
  it would only be displayed if the module was unsigned.
  (anderson@redhat.com, atomlin@redhat.com)

- Modified the internal dump_tasks_in_task_group_rt_rq() and 
  dump_RT_prio_array() functions, used by the "runq" command,
  to utilize the simpler new do_list() functionality.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Resurrection of the remote analysis capability for use with the
  "xen-crashd" daemon running on a Xen Dom0 host, which communicates
  with a paused or shutdown DomU guest kernel.  The daemon can be 
  accessed like so:

    $ crash localhost:5001,/dev/xenmem vmlinux

  (dslutz@verizon.com)

- Prevent the X86_64 "bt" command from using starting RSP and RIP 
  values taken from the NT_PRSTATUS notes of kdump dumpfiles if the
  RSP address is not in the task's kernel stack, or in any of the 
  relevant per-cpu exception stacks.  This can happen when the number
  of NT_PRSTATUS notes does not match the number of online cpus.  
  Without the patch, the command may generate a segmentation violation,
  fail with the error message "bt: cannot determine starting stack 
  pointer", or fail with an error message indicating that the command 
  "cannot transition" from an exception stack to the previous stack.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Fix for the X86_64 "bt" command for displaying the backtraces of 
  active tasks running on the non-crashing cpus in kdump dumpfiles
  in which the "crash_nmi_callback" function frame does not appear
  in the per-cpu NMI exception stacks.  That function frame is 
  normally used as the starting point for the backtraces of those 
  tasks, but if it does not exist, the "notify_die" frame will be 
  used instead.  Without the patch, the backtraces of the active 
  non-crashing tasks are incorrect or incomplete.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Increment the X86_64 NR_CPUS maximum value from 5120 to 8192
  to be able to account for Linux 3.13-rc1 and later kernels 
  in which CONFIG_MAXSMP has been configured.  If that is true, 
  the CONFIG_NR_CPUS value is overridden, and the kernel NR_CPUS 
  value will be set to 8192.  This will cause the crash session to
  fail with the messages "WARNING: kernel-configured NR_CPUS (8192) 
  greater than compiled-in NR_CPUS (5120)" and "crash: recompile crash
  with larger NR_CPUS".
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- A crash-7.0.3 fix for the proper determination of the kernel NR_CPUS
  configurable for Linux 3.8 and later kernels introduced a regression
  in Linux 3.8 and later kernels if:
    (1) the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SLAB, and
    (2) the sum of the kernel's NR_CPUS and MAX_NUMNODES values exceed 
	the NR_CPUS value compiled into the crash utility.
  Without the patch, the crash session generates a segmentation fault
  while it indicates "please wait: gathering kmem slab cache data".
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Update for the extensions/trace.c extension module to support the 
  ftrace data structure changes introduced in Linux 3.10 kernels.  
  Without the patch, loading the module with the "extend" command fails
  with the error message "extend: trace.so: no commands registered: 
  shared object unloaded".
  (d.hatayama@jp.fujitsu.com)

- Increment the S390 and S390X NR_CPUS maximum value from 64 to 512.
  (holzheu@linux.vnet.ibm.com)

- Implemented support for the redesigned per-slab object bookkeeping 
  that was introduced in Linux 3.13-rc1 for kernels configured with 
  CONFIG_SLAB.  In those kernels, the head page structure associated 
  with each slab is overloaded to serve as the (now removed) slab data
  structure, and the array of kmem_bufctl_t data structures that used 
  to be appended to each slab data structure for object management has
  been replaced by a new freelist stack mechanism.  Without the patch,
  the crash session would fail during initialization with the error 
  message "crash: invalid structure member offset: kmem_cache_s_c_num".
  It should be noted that this patch has only been tested on 3.13-rc1
  kernels, which do not have the modified freelist_idx_t in place as
  of yet, so the replacement of integer-sized indexes with byte or 
  short sized indexes had not been checked in.  Furthermore, if this 
  proposed patch set gets accepted:
    [RFC][PATCH 0/3] re-shrink 'struct page' when SLUB is on.
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/12/11/589
  then both CONFIG_SLAB and CONFIG_SLUB support in the crash utility
  will be broken yet again.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- In order to facilitate the building of the crash binary with either
  or both of the optional LZO or SNAPPY compression libraries, two new
  Makefile targets have been added:
    $ make lzo
    $ make snappy
  Without the patch, the CFLAGS.extra and LDFLAGS.extra files must be
  created or modified as described in these changelog entries:
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog.html#LZO
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog.html#SNAPPY
  This patch simply does the work automatically.  After having done it
  one time, there is no need to use the targets for subsequent builds.          
  The relevant libraries must pre-exist on the build machine.

- Implementation of 7.0.3 from upstream and patch refresh.

- Fix for the ARM architecture if the backtrace unwind information 
  cannot be gathered during session initialization.  Without the patch, 
  the two unwind-related warning messages indicating "WARNING: UNWIND: 
  failed to gather unwind_table list" and "WARNING: UNWIND: failed to 
  initialize module unwind tables" are followed by the fatal error 
  message "crash: cannot hash task_struct entries".

- Fix for the "help -[Dn]" dumpfile information display of the GUID EFI
  table in the header of SADUMP dumpfiles.  Without the patch, only 33 
  of the 36 bytes in the table are translated.
  (d.hatayama@jp.fujitsu.com)

- Fix for the determination of the kernel NR_CPUS configurable for
  Linux 3.8 and later kernels that are configured with CONFIG_SLAB. 
  Without the patch, the kernel's compiled-in NR_CPUS value was 
  incorrectly calculated to be the sum of the kernel's NR_CPUS and
  MAX_NUMNODES configurables.
  (anderson@redhat.com)
     
- In the next release of makedumpfile, the status field of the 
  dumpfile header of compressed kdumps will show the compression 
  type that was utilized.  The "help -[Dn]" output has been updated
  to display that information.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- For kernels configured with CONFIG_SLAB in which an array_cache
  pointer referenced by a kmem_cache structure is invalid, the
  individual cache(s) will be marked as invalid.  During session
  initialization, the message "crash: kmem_cache: <cache-address>: 
  invalid array_cache pointer" will be displayed, and during runtime, 
  attempts to access the cache(s) will result in a message indicating 
  that the cache is "[INVALID/CORRPUTED]".  Without the patch, the 
  message "crash: unable to initialize kmem slab cache subsystem" is 
  displayed during session initialization, and run-time commands that 
  attempt to access the kmem slab cache subsystem fail with the error
  message "kmem cache slab subsystem not available".
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Fix for the "kmem -[sS] <slab-object-address>" option in Linux 3.6
  and later kernels configured with CONFIG_SLAB.  Without the patch, 
  the command fails with the message "kmem: address is not allocated in 
  slab subsystem: <slab-object-address>.  This also causes the 
  "kmem <slab-object-address>" command to (quietly) fail to determine
  that the address is a slab object.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Fix for the "bt" command if a kernel __init text address is 
  encountered.  Without the patch, and depending upon the reallocation
  of the __init text memory, a bogus framesize may be calculated, or 
  more likely, in a compressed kdump, a warning message indicating 
  "bt: page excluded: kernel virtual address: <address>  type: 
  gdb_readmem_callback" will be displayed following the frame data.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Update for determining whether an S390X PTE contains a swap entry
  in Linux 3.12 and later kernels.
  (holzheu@linux.vnet.ibm.com)

- Resurrected the translation and display of the page.flags bits by the
  "kmem -p" command on Linux 2.6.26 and later kernels whose vmlinux 
  debuginfo data contains either the "pageflags" enumerator or the 
  "pageflag_names" array of trace_print_flags structures.  If they are
  not available, just the page.flags value is printed in hexadecimal,
  as has been done since Linux 2.4.9.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Fix for the "bt" command when used with vmcore files that were
  created with the recently-introduced "virsh dump --memory-only", 
  which dumps KVM guests into an ELF vmcore similar to those created 
  by the kdump facility.  Without the patch, a faulty backtrace for the 
  panic task may be generated due to the use of incorrect starting 
  RSP/RIP registers; this happens because (unlike kdump) the 
  non-panicking cpus are offlined prior to the dumpfile being created,
  which in turn leads to the use of the wrong NT_PRSTATUS note. 
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Fix for the CPU number display on systems with 255 or more cpus
  during the initial banner, by the "set" command, the "ps" command, 
  and by all commands that display the per-task header consisting of 
  the task address, pid, cpu and command name.  Without the patch, for
  cpu 255, the "sys" command displays "NO_PROC_ID", and the other 
  commands would show a "-" for the cpu number; for cpu numbers greater
  than 255, garbage values would be displayed in the cpu number field.
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Implemented support for compressed kdump header version 6, in which
  makedumpfile(8) adds new fields in the kdump_sub_header to support
  large memory systems with pfn values that are larger than 32-bits.
  Without the patch, if the system contains physical memory located
  in high memory such that its maximum pfn value is overflows the
  32-bit "max_mapnr" field in the header, the crash session will fail
  with the error message "crash: vmlinux and vmcore do not match!".
  (jingbai.ma@hp.com)

- Fix for the "net -s" command on Linux 3.8 and later kernels.  Without
  the patch, the command fails with the message "net: invalid structure
  member offset: inet_opt_daddr".
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Fix a build failure in a native ARM64 environment due to obsolete
  LKCD dumpfile headers. 
  (anderson@redhat.com)

- Implementation of a new "per-cpu object" as an argument format that
  can be passed to the "p", "struct", "union" or "*" commands.  The
  format is expressed as either <per-cpu symbol>:<cpu-specifier> or
  as <per-cpu offset>:<cpu-specifier>, where the per-cpu symbol or
  per-cpu offset must precede a colon, and where the <cpu-identifier>
  follows the colon.  The cpu-identifier may be expressed in any of
  the following manners:
          :             CPU of the currently selected task.
          :a[ll]        all CPUs.
          :#[-#][,...]  CPU list(s), e.g. "1,3,5", "1-3",
                        or "1,3,5-7,10".
  Without the patch, per-cpu symbols are only accepted by the "p" 
  command, and the data type and the resolved kernel virtual address 
  for each per-cpu instance are displayed shown.  With this patch, a
  colon and a cpu-specifier may be appended to the symbol name, and the
  the contents of the symbol on each cpu that is specified will be
  displayed by the "p" command.  For the "struct/union/*" commands, an
  argument may be specified using either a per-cpu offset value or 
  per-cpu symbol name followed by a colon and cpu-specifier, and the
  contents of each structure/union on each specified cpu will be
  displayed.

- Re-execution of 150764 by tabraham@suse.com to re-align patch
  content, re-number patches for latest spec contents and to
  remove some incidental content (e.g. whitespace insertion and
  leftover comments of new lines). Comment from tabraham follows:

 - added crash-display-date-fix.patch
   This is a backport of the fix from crash-6.0.9 to fix the date
   displayed by the initial system banner and by the "sys" command
   for linux kernel 3.6 and later. Without the patch, the date
   displayed will be that of the UNIX epoch adjusted to local time.

 - added crash-kmem_cache_slab.patch
   This is a backport of the fix from crash-6.1.0 for Linux 3.0 and
   later kernels that have been configured with CONFIG_SLAB and with-
   out CONFIG_NODES_SHIFT. Without the patch, the warning messages
   "crash: nr_node_ids: symbol does not exist" and "crash: unable to
   initialize kmem slab cache subsystem" are displayed during
   initialization, and the "kmem -[sS]" options fail with the message
   "kmem: kmem cache slab subsystem not available".

Fri Jun  1 09:20:03 UTC 2012 - dmair@suse.com

- Update to crash 6.0.7 from upstream and adjust patches to apply
  without offsets. Upstream changes:
  o Enhanced the search command to allow the searched-for value to
    be entered as a crash (expression) or a kernel symbol name. The
    resultant value of an (expression) or kernel symbol value must
    fit into in the designated value size if -w or -h are used, and
    neither variant may be used with the -c option.  If found, both
    the resultant value and the argument input string will be
    displayed next to the target address(es).
  o Added a new "search -t" option that will restrict the search to
    the kernel stack pages of all tasks.  If one or more matches
    are found in a task's kernel stack, the output is preceded with
    a task-identifying header.
  o Fix for the s390x "bt -[tT]" options when run on an active task
    on a live system.  Without the patch, the options fail with the 
    message "bt: invalid/stale stack pointer for this task: 0".
  o Fix for s390x "vm -p" option, which may show invalid user to
    physical address translation data if a page is not mapped.
    Without the patch, a page's translation may indicate
    "<address>   SWAP: (unknown swap location)  OFFSET: 0",
    or show an incorrect swap offset on an actual swap device.
  o Added new "vm -[xd]" options to be used in conjunction with
    "vm -[mv]", which override the current default output format 
    with hexadecimal or decimal format for just the command instance.  
    Without the patch, it would require changing the default output 
    format with "hex" or "dec" prior to executing "vm -[mv]".  The 
    new flags may also be used with "foreach vm -[mv]".
  o Fix for the s390x "vm -p" and "vtop -u <user-address>" commands
    if the page containing the relevant PTE is not mapped.  Without
    the patch, the commands fail with the error message "vm: read
    error: kernel virtual address: 0  type: entry" or "vtop: read
    error: kernel virtual address: 0  type: entry"
  o Fix for the s390x "vm -p" command and "vtop -u <user-address>"
    commands to properly translate pages that are swapped out into
    their swap file and offset.  Without the patch, the swap file
    and offset would not be displayed.
  o Added new "list -[xd]" options to be used in conjunction with
    "list -s", which override the current default output format 
    with hexadecimal or decimal format for just the command instance.
    Without the patch, it would require changing the default output 
    format with "hex" or "dec" prior to executing "list -s".
  o Added new "net -[xd]" options to be used in conjunction with 
    "net -S", which override the current default output format
    with hexadecimal or decimal format for just the command instance.
    Without the patch, it would require changing the default output
    format with "hex" or "dec" prior to executing "net -S".  The new 
    flags may also be used with "foreach net -S".
  o Added new "mach -[xd]" options to be used in conjunction with 
    "mach -c", which override the current default output format
    with hexadecimal or decimal format for just the command instance.
    Without the patch, it would require changing the default output
    format with "hex" or "dec" prior to executing "mach -c".
  o If the value read from the cpu online, present, or possible masks
    contains a cpu bit value that is outside the architecture's maximum 
    NR_CPUS value, print a warning message during invocation.  Without
    the patch, a corrupt vmcore containing a bogus mask value could 
    quietly corrupt heap memory.
  o Add support to for reading dumpfiles compressed by LZO using
    makedumpfile version 1.4.4 or later.  This feature is disabled by
    default.  To enable this feature, build the crash utility in the 
    following manner:
    (1) Install the LZO libraries by using the host system's package
        manager or by directly downloading libraries from author's 
        website.  The packages required are:
          - lzo
          - lzo-minilzo
          - lzo-devel
        The author's website is: http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo
    (2) Create a CFLAGS.extra file and an LDFLAGS.extra file in top-level
        crash sources directory:
          - enter -DLZO in the CFLAGS.extra file
          - enter -llzo2 in the LDFLAGS.extra file.
    (3) Build crash with "make" as always.
    * Only available as a source option for manual build in this
      environment
  o Fix for the included "trace" extension module.  Without the patch,
    if the module initialization sequence fails, a double-free in the
    module may lead to a subsequent malloc() segmentation violation
    in the crash session.
  o Incorporated the "ipcs" extension module written by Qiao Nuohan 
    as a built-in command.  The command displays the kernel's usage 
    of the System V shared memory, semaphore and message queue IPC
    facilities.  It differs from the original extension module by
    fixing a failure scenario if the current task is exiting, and
    adds a "-n pid|task" option, which displays the IPCS facilities
    with respect to the namespace of a given pid or task.
  o Fix for a gdb-7.3.1 regression that causes the line number capability
    to fail with certain ranges of x86 base kernel text addresses.
    Without the patch, the "dis -l <symbol>" or "sym <symbol>"
    commands would fail to show line number information for certain
    ranges of base kernel text addresses.
  o Added a new "printm" command to the embedded gdb module.  It
    is currently only used by the "pstruct" extension module, but
    can be used to dump the type, size, offset, bitpos and bitsize
    values of an expression.
  o Added a new "runq -t" option that displays the timestamp information
    of each cpu's runqueue, which consists of either the rq.clock, the
    rq.most_recent_timestamp or rq.timestamp_last_tick value, whichever 
    applies.  Following each cpu timestamp is the last_run or timestamp 
    value of the active task on that cpu, whichever applies, along with 
    the task identification.
  o Fix for an initialization-time warning when running on a live system
    with the most recent version of the modprobe command, which no longer
    supports the -l and --type options.  The modprobe is used to detect
    whether the crash.ko memory driver is part of the distribution.  
    Without the patch, a warning message is issued that indicates
    "/sbin/modprobe: invalid option -- 'l'".  If the driver is built into
    the kernel, the message is harmless.  If the driver is not built into
    kernel, then the crash.ko (/dev/crash) driver would not be selected 
    as the live memory source.

- delete crash-foreach-match-running.patch: upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 14 20:24:51 UTC 2012 - dmair@suse.com

- Update to crash 6.0.6 from upstream
  o Extend the supported cross-architecture build capability so
    that it applies to the SIAL extentension module. Without the
    patch, when building the SIAL module an environment where the
    overlying crash utility was built with "make target=ARM",
    "make target=PPC", or "make target=X86", the SIAL extension
    module would continue to be built for the host architecture
  o Fixes for memory leaks and possible segmentation violations
    when unloading SIAL extension module scripts.
  o Fix for the new "foreach RU" task state qualifier.  Without the
    patch, the runnable tasks are not selected.
  o Fix to disallow multiple task states from being entered using
    the "foreach <task-state>" qualifier.  Without the patch, if
    multiple states were entered, the last one on the command line 
    would be honored.
  o Fix for the "extend" command to allow the usage of 32-bit PPC 
    extension modules.  Without the patch, the command fails with the
    message: "extend: <object>.so: not an ELF format object file".
  o If an input line starts with "#" or "//", then the line will be 
    saved as a comment that is visible when re-cycling through the 
    command history list.
  o Fix for a crash-5.1.9 regression that broke the "bt -g" option.
    Without the patch, the option is ignored completely.
  o Fix for s390x virtual-to-physical translation of virtual
    addresses that are backed by 1MB pages.
  o The s390x has a dumpfile method that creates "live dumps", where
    the kernel continues to run while the dumpfile is being created.
    The initial system banner display and the "sys" command will
    inform the user that the dumpfile is a "[LIVE DUMP]", and the
    "bt -a" option will fail with the message "bt: -a option not
    supported on a live system or live dump".
  o Newly-created dumpfiles generated by the "snap.c" extension module
    will now be recognized as "live dumps".  Accordingly, the initial
    system banner display and the "sys" command will inform the user
    that the dumpfile is a "[LIVE DUMP]", and the "bt -a" option will
    fail with the message "bt: -a option not supported on a live
    system or live dump".
  o If "bt" alone is attempted on an active task in a "live dump", it
    will indicate "(active)", i.e., the same as if it were attempted
    on a live system.
  o If an extension module does not define the appropriate architecture,
    i.e., "-DX86", "-DX86_64", etc., then the inclusion of "defs.h"
    will generate a compiler failure indicating "error: 'NR_CPUS'
    undeclared here (not in a function)".  In that case, the
    architecture will now default to that of the host machine.
  o Prevent a highly-unlikely incorrect calculation of the maximum 
    cpudata array length of a kmem_cache during initialization of 
    of CONFIG_SLAB kernels.
  o Prevent an infinite loop during the initialization of the
    kmem_cache subsystem in CONFIG_SLAB kernels if the cache list or
    the vmcore is corrupt.  If the kmem_cache list links back into
    itself, messages showing the first "duplicate" entry in the list
    and "crash: unable to initialize kmem slab cache subsystem" will
    be displayed.
  o Update to the "mod" command to additionally search for module
    object files in the directory containing the kernel namelist
    (vmlinux) file. This will allow an alternate module-debuginfo
    directory tree to be set up like so:

      # cd <directory>
      # rpm2cpio kernel-debuginfo-<release>.rpm | cpio -idv

    Having done that, and by referencing the vmlinux file in that
    directory tree directly or by symbolic link, the "mod" command
    will search for module object files starting from the directory
    containing the vmlinux file if they are not found in the standard 
    /lib/modules/<release> directory.
  o Update to the s390x "bt" command if a task was running in
    userspace. Without the patch, the back trace display ended at the
    kernel entry function frame; with the patch, the user space PSW
    register is displayed with a "(user space)" tag, followed by the
    general purpose register set.
  o In the unlikely event that the access of ARM or x86_64 kernel
    unwind table data fails during crash invocation, print a warning
    message and allow the crash session to continue.  Without the
    patch, the crash session would fail immediately.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 16:30:23 UTC 2012 - dmair@suse.com

- Update to crash 6.0.5 from upstream and adjust patch positions
  to match current crash source.
  6.0.5 changelog is:
  o Enhancement to the "foreach" command to allow any of the "name"
    arguments to be POSIX extended regular expressions.  The
    expression string must be encompassed by "'" characters, and
    will be matched against the names of all tasks.
  o Fix for the embedded gdb module's "ptype" command, and by
    extension, the crash utility's "struct" command, to be able to
    fully display embedded structure or union members of a
    structure/union.  Without the patch, if a structure or union is
    a member of a structure or union that is a member of a
    structure or union, then it is displayed as "struct {...}" or
    "union {...}".
  o Extend the "ps -l" output to also display the task state next
    to its last_run/timestamp value.
  o Enhancement to the "foreach" command which adds a new "state"
    task-indentifier argument that filters tasks by their task
    state. The state argument may be any of the task states
    displayed by the "ps" command: RU, IN, UN, ST, ZO, SW or DE.
  o Implemented a new pc->cmd_cleanup function pointer and an
    optional pc->cmd_cleanup_arg argument that will allow any
    command to register a function and an optional argument that
    will be called after a command has completed successfully, or
    more likely, unsuccessfully. Normally the only cleanup required
    for a command is the freeing of buffers that were allocated
    with GETBUF(), but that is performed automatically after each
    command is run.  However, with the introduction of the new
    POSIX regular expression functionality of the "foreach"
    command, there needed to be a way to call regfree() in the case
    where where regcomp() was called successfully, but then the
    command later encountered one of several fatal error
    conditions. This facility is also available for use by
    extension module commands.
  o Enforce the usage of a kernel thread's pgd from its active_mm
    for the ARM "vtop -c" command; if its active_mm is NULL, make
    the command fail similarly to the other architectures,
    displaying the error message "vtop: no active_mm for this
    kernel thread".
  o Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command running against recent kernels
    if an active task was operating on its IRQ stack when the crash
    occurred.  Without the patch, the determination of the IRQ
    exception frame was off-by-8, displaying invalid register data
    and the error message "bt: WARNING: possibly bogus exception
    frame".
  o Update to handle the vfsmount structure change in 3.3 kernels,
    in which most members of the vfsmount structure have been moved
    into a new "struct mount", and the vfsmount structure has been
    embedded in the new mount structure.  Without the patch, the
    following commands will fail, displaying the following error
    messages:

      mount: "mount: invalid structure member offset: vfsmount_mnt_list"
      files: "files: invalid structure member offset: dentry_d_covers"
         vm: "vm: invalid structure member offset: dentry_d_covers"
       swap: "swap: invalid structure member offset: dentry_d_covers
      fuser: "files: invalid structure member offset: dentry_d_covers"

    The "fuser" command generates the above error because it uses
    the "files" command behind the scenes.
  o Fix for the "ps" command to prevent the display of "??" under
    the ST (task state) column.  Without the patch, in more recent
    kernels, if more than one bit were set in the task_struct.state
    field, the state would display "??".  With the fix, the primary
    state will always be displayed.
  o Update to the output of the "set" command when it displays a
    task's state.  Without the patch, if more than one bit was set
    in the task_struct.state field, "STATE: (unknown)" would be
    displayed.  With the fix, all bits in both the task_struct.state
    and task_struct.exit_state fields are translated.
  o Implemented a new "vm -P <vma-address>" option, which is similar
    to "vm -p", but only does the page translations of the specified
    VM area of a context.
  o Add support for the Freescale PowerPC e500mc version of the E500
    processor chipset, and rework the PPC platform-specific code in
    order to more easily support new processors.
  o Implemented a new "gdb" crash environment variable that can be
    used to alter a crash session's behavior such that all commands
    are passed directly to the embedded gdb module.  The new mode
    is turned on and off by entering "set gdb on" and "set gdb off".
    When running in this mode, the command prompt will be "gdb>".
    In order to execute native crash commands while running in this
    mode, precede the command with the "crash" directive, for
    example, "crash ps".
  o Fix for a "*** stack smashing detected ***: crash terminated"
    failure during the initial system banner display on a 32-bit
    PPC platform.
  o Redesigned/simplified the internal read_string() function to
    prevent a potential segmentation violation.
  o Updates for the 32-bit PPC "vtop" command output:

      (1) Translate kernel virtual addresses for FSL BOOKE by using 
          the TLBCAM setting
      (2) Remove the PMD line from the display
      (3) Fix the displayed PHYSICAL values of FSL BOOKE PTE format

  o Fix for crash invocation failure on 3.3-era kernels in which
    the former standalone "xtime" timespec structure has been moved
    into the "timekeeper" structure.  Without the patch, the crash
    session would fail early on with the message "crash: cannot
    resolve: xtime". The patch also prevents the crash session
    failure in the unlikely event that the timespec access fails.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 29 22:12:17 UTC 2012 - dmair@suse.com

- Update to crash 6.0.4 from upstream and adjust patch locations
  to match current crash source.
  6.0.4 changelog is:
  o Fix to allow the recently-added "mod -g" and "mod -r" options
    to be used together.
  o Additional update for 3.1.x and later kernels configured with
    CONFIG_SLAB, which have replaced the kmem_cache.nodelists[]
    array with a pointer to an outside array.
  o Document the "crash [-h|--help] all" option in the crash.8 man 
    page and in the "crash [-h|--help]" output.
  o Fix the S390/S390X-specific "s390dbf" command's "hex_ascii"
    debug data printing routine to prevent the display of
    non-ASCII characters.
  o Fix for ARM stack unwinding on 3.2 and later kernels due to
    commit:
      http://git.kernel.org/linus/de66a979012dbc66b1ec0125795a3f79ee667b8a
  o Implemented a new "search -x <count>" option that displays the
    memory contents before and after any found search target.
  o  Fix for the x86_64 Xen hypervisor "bt" command.  Without the
     patch, the contents of the RDX register in exception frames
     incorrectly shows the contents of the RCX register.
  o Implementation of a platform-based vmalloc address translation
    scheme for the 32-bit PPC architecture, introducing suppport
    for the PPC44X platform while maintaining the current default
    platform.
  o Fix for the usage of native gdb commands where the command
    output is redirected to a pipe and then redirected to a file.
  o Fix to prevent a crash session that is run over a network
    connection that is killed/removed from going into 100%
    cpu-time loop.
  o Fix for the support of PPC64 compressed kdumps, a regression
    that was introduced in crash-6.0.3 when support for 32-bit PPC
    compressed kdumps was implemented.
  o Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command to prevent the possible
    skipping of the stack frame just above an exception frame that
    indicates "[exception RIP: unknown or invalid address]".
  Patches with modified target locations are:
    crash-make-emacs-default.diff
    crash-sles9-time.patch
    crash-crosscrash-hint.diff
    crash-missing-declarations.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 16:31:37 UTC 2012 - dmair@suse.com

- Update to crash 6.0.3 from upstream and modifications to compile.

    sial_free() for an uninitialised variable
  o Fix for the "runq" command for kernels that are configured
    with CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED
  o Implemented build and code for the analysis of 32-bit PPC ELF
    kdump vmcores
  o Implemented the capability of building a PPC crash binary on
    a PPC64 host, which can be done by entering "make target=PPC"
  o Determine the PPC page size from the kdump PAGESIZE vmcoreinfo
    data
  o Fix for the "kmem -[sS]", "kmem -[fF]" and "kmem <address>"
    options in 3.2 kernels
  o Addition of a set of dumpfile read diagnostic debug statements
  o Fix for X86 kernels that have CONFIG_X86_32,
    CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM, CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM_MANUAL and CONFIG_NUMA
    all configured
  o Fix for the "vtop" command on large NUMA X86 kernels where a
    node's starting physical address is larger than 32-bits
  o Update for the ARM architecture to recognize a recent change
    of its vmlinux section name from ".init" to ".init.text"
  o Significant speed increase of the "kmem -p" command, especially
    on large-memory systems
  o Implemented new "irq -a" and "irq -s" options
  o Removal of a redundant read of the kernel's __per_cpu_offset
    pointers in the ARM architecture's arm_get_crash_notes()
    function
  o Fix for an ARM architecture segmentation violation because of a
    stack overflow due to recursion in the page table translation
    code
  o Fix for the the "FREE HIGH" tally in the X86 "kmem -i" display
  o Fix for the "kmem -n" output display for 32-bit architectures
    that are configured with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM
  o Cleanup of several SIAL extension module files to address bison
    2.5 and gcc 4.4.3 compile-time warnings
  o Fix for "net -[sS]" command options on the ARM architecture
  o Fix for the ARM "bt" command to allow the core kernel unwind
    tables to be used in cases where the module unwind tables are
    inaccessible
  o Implementation of a new "dev -d" option that displays disk
    device I/O statistics
  o Update for 3.1.x and later kernels configured with CONFIG_SLAB,
    which have replaced the kmem_cache.nodelists[] array with a
    pointer to an  outside array
  o Implemented build and code for analysis of 32-bit PPC
    compressed kdump vmcores
  o Prevent the "runq" command from dumping an unending loop of
    tasks if the CFS runqueue has been corrupted
  o Repurposed/renamed the rarely-used and rarely-needed "mod -r"
    option to "mod -R"
  o Implemented a new "mod -r" option, which will pass the
    "-readnow" flag to the embedded gdb module, which will override
    the two-stage strategy that it uses for reading symbol tables
    from module object files
  o Performance increase for the "kmem -s <address>" option on 
    kernels configured with CONFIG_SLAB, most notably on kernels
    whose kmem_cache.array[NR_CPUS] array is several pages in size
  o Require that the "<slabname>" argument to "kmem -s <slabname>" 
    be escaped with a '\' character in two situations:
    (1) in the highly-unlikely case of a kmem_cache slab named
        "list", to prevent the ambiguity with the "kmem -s list"
        command option.
    (2) if the first character of the <slabname> actually is a '\'
        character
  Modifications to compile are as follows:
  o Replacement of crash-6.0.2.tar.gz with crash-6.0.3.tar.gz
  o Remove crash-wrong-memset.patch the fix is present in 6.0.3
  o Remove crash-add-read-diags.patch the change is in 6.0.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  3 20:09:41 UTC 2011 - dmair@novell.com

- Update to 5.1.1
  o Fix for the potential to miss tasks when walking the pid_hash
    table in 2.6.24 and later kernels.  Without the patch, the task
    will simply not be seen in the gathered task list.

  o Enhancement for the ARM architecture's "bt" command  to print
    out the user space register set for tasks entering the kernel
    via the syscall entry point. 

  o Rework of the handling of "set" commands that are put in 
    .crashrc files so that only the following options are resolved
    prior to session initialization: silent, console, core, edit,
    namelist, and zero_excluded.  All others are resolved
    immediately after session initialization is complete.
    Accordingly, the use of "set -c <cpu>", "set -p",
    "set -a [task|pid]" and set [pid|task]" are now acceptable
    .crashrc commands.

  o The entering of "set -v" in a .crashrc file would cause an
    immediate segmentation violation.  The "set" command rework
    above defers the command until session initialization is
    complete.

  o The entering of "set dumpfile <filename>" in a .crashrc file
    would cause a fatal "seek" error during session initalization
    with most most dumpfile types, so the "dumpfile" option has
    been removed from the "set" command.

  o The execution of "alias" commands from a .crashrc file used to
    be performed immediately; that behavior has been changed so
    that they are executed immediately after session initialization
    is complete.

  o Enhancement of the "repeat" command to allow command aliases.

  o Fix for running "kmem -s" on a live system if an offline cpu is
    brought back online while the command is executing.  Without
    the patch, the online operation may cause a segmentation
    violation.

  o Change the behavior of "bt -[tT]" to allow the command options
    to be run on active tasks on live systems.  Without the patch,
    both command options would display the task data banner
    followed by "(active)".  

  o Fix for the ARM architecuture's "irq" command when run on
    2.6.36 and later kernels.  Without the patch, the command fails
    with the error message "irq: invalid kernel virtual address: 23
    type: irq_chip typename".   The fix replaces the custom ARM IRQ
    dumping function with the architecture-neutral version.

  o Introduced support for using /proc/kcore as an alternative
    source of live memory to /dev/mem.  Doing so allows vmalloc
    memory access on 32-bit architectures when the underlying
    mapped physical memory is in highmem, which is not allowed by
    the /dev/mem driver.  It would also be usable on systems that
    are configured with CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM but still configured
    with CONFIG_PROC_KCORE.  To enforce the use of /proc/kcore, it
    may be entered on the command line.

  o If a live crash session attempts to use /dev/mem as a live
    memory source, and it is determined that the system is
    configured with CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, /proc/kcore will
    automatically be tried as an alternative.  

  o Fix to allow "/dev/crash" to be entered on the command line for
    live sessions.  Because it is used automatically if it exists,
    it is never necessary to enter it on the command line.  However,
    if it is used, without the patch, the session fails during
    initializaion with the error message "crash: /dev/crash: No
    such file or directory" if the crash.ko driver is a module, or
    "crash: /dev/crash: not a supported file format" if the driver
    is built into the kernel.

  o Fix for the ARM "bt" command to address the issue behind faulty
    warning messages that indicate "WARNING: UNWIND: unsupported
    personality routine".

  o Fix for the ARM "bt" command to address the issue behind faulty
    warning messages that indicate "bt: WARNING: UNWIND: cannot
    find index for <address>".

  o Call FREEBUF() on a GETBUF()-generated buffer ub the
    do_radix_tree() utility function.

  o Show hexadecimal values in the "INDEX" colum of "kmem -p",
    because because "page.index" is typically a shared-use field
    that may also contain a pointer value.

    names.
  o Fix for "swap" and "kmem -i" commands on 2.6.29 or later,
    big-endian, ppc64 kernels, where the swap_info_struct.flags

    alone on the command line without preceding it with "gdb"
  o Fix the processing of bit fields on big endian systems in the SIAL

  o New option "ps -G" to restrict the process status output to the thread
    group leader of a thread group
  o Several fixes for the "repeat" command when used in conjunction
    with an input file.  Without the patch:
    - Depending upon the command executed from the input file, a SIGINT
      would kill the command currently being executed from the input file,
      but the "repeat" command would then restart it.
    - If a command in the input file redirected its output to a pipe, the
      repeat operation could stop prematurely after executing that particular
      command.
    - If a command in the input file redirected its output to a pipe, the
      zombies of the command being piped to would not be cleaned up until the
      repeat command was stopped.
    - If the last command in the input file redirected its output to a pipe,
      all subsequent executions of the input file would only display the
      output of that last command.
  o New extension: "trace.so"
  o Fix for a potential failure to initialize the kmem slab cache 
    subsystem on 2.6.22 and later CONFIG_SLAB kernels if the dumpfile

    (instead of 0)
  o Change the cursor location when cycling through the command history
    in "vi" editing mode (the default)

    descriptor structures that are located beyond a 4GB file offset
    in the vmcore file
  o Fix the "sym <address>" command option when the address references
    a symbol in the vsyscall FIXMAP virtual address page in certain
    x86_64 kernel versions
  o Multiple fixes for the "bt" command on x86_64:
    - properly recognize vsyscall FIXMAP virtual addresses when
      encountered as the RIP in an exception frame.
    - always use the NMI exception stack when available, not the per-cpu
      IRQ stack of an active non-crashing task
    - correctly determine the frame just above an IRQ interrupt exception
      frame, or above an exception frame that gets handled on the process
      stack, such as a page fault
    - correctly calculate the frame size to differentiate between text
      return addresses and the precise text RIP address of an exception
  o Fix usage of a System.map file argument with 2.6.30 and later kernels
    to avoid "crash: symbol count overflow (trace_kmalloc)" messages
  o Fix usage of a System.map file argument whose symbol list does not
    contain an "_end" symbol.
  o Fix "kmem -p <address>" or "kmem <address>" when <address> is not
    a page structure address to avoid the annoying "kmem: WARNING:
    sparsemem: invalid section number: 8192" messages

    definition, which in turn contains ${CFLAGS} to allow user-defined
    CFLAGS on the "make" command line
  o Bail out with a "not a supported file format" error immediately
    when trying to open x86 vmlinux file on an x86_64 host
  o Fix the "bt" command on x86 Xen hypervisor dumpfiles where a vcpu

    error.
  o Only allow trusted versions of .crashrc and .gdbinit files to
    be sourced during session initialization.
  o Fix for a potential but highly unlikely buffer overflow in the
    gdb dwarfread.c and dwarf2read.c files, which requires a hand-
    crafted object file with a location block (DW_FORM_block) that
    contains a large number of operations.
  o Fix for a potential but highly unlikely integer overflow in the
    Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, which requires a hand-
    crafted object file that that specifies a large number of
    section headers, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
  o Enable stack unwind on ia64 when using a kerntypes file as the
    kernel namelist.
  o Fix for failure of "files -R" command option if an inode is
    unknown due to a NULL f_dentry pointer in any open file
    structure because of a kernel error condition.
  o Allow an LKCD kerntypes debuginfo file created from a kernel
    module to be loaded with the command:
    "mod -s <module> <kerntypes-file>".

    during runtime via "<", where more than one command in the
    input file  results in a fatal error.
  o Clean up causes for warning messages when compiling with gcc
    4.3.2.
  o Fix to prevent a segmentation violation during initialization
    when parsing (corrupted) module symbols.
  o If an active task experiences a kernel stack overflow, the
    task's thread_info structure located at the very bottom of the
    stack will likely have its "cpu" field corrupted.
  o Modification of the the "files" command when a task has an open
    file referenced by a file descriptor, but the file structure's
    f_dentry  field is NULL.
  o Fix for the "bt" command on x86 Xen architectures when the
    backtrace starts on the hard IRQ stack.

  o Fix for a bug in the SIAL extension when dealing with
    bitfields.
  o Fix for the "files" command when run on 2.6.25 and later
    kernels,  which would either fail with an "invalid kernel
    virtual address" error of type "fill_dentry_cache", or would
    show nonsensical/garbage "ROOT" and "CWD" pathnames.
  o Addition of a new "null-stop" environment variable that can be
    turned on/off with the "set" command.
  o Fix for the builtin "g" alias, which would fail with an
    "Ambiguous command" error from the embedded gdb module.

    user_regs_struct structure members.
  o Fix for initialization-time failure when running against 2.6.27
    x86_64 xen kernels, which indicate "crash: cannot resolve:

  o Fix for initialization-time failure when running against Xen
    4.4  hypervisor binaries, which indicate "crash: invalid
    structure member offset: domain_is_polling".
