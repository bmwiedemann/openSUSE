%description
Chocolate Doom is a Doom source port with focus on accurate
reproduction of the original DOS version of Doom and other games
based on the Doom engine. There are no new features, a lack of high
resolution rendering, and goes as far as to duplicate or recreate
bugs and crashes found in the DOS executable that were fixed before
the initial open-sourcing of the Doom engine.
