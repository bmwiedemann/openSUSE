- Update to version 10.1:
  + Firefox: multiple fixes of GNOME Shell extensions
    synchronization.
  + Firefox 56 is minimum supported version now. ESR users should
    use browser extension version 10.0.1.
  + Known issues:
    - In Firefox with enabled synchronization of GNOME Shell
      extensions all Shell extensions may be removed after screen
      got locked because of missed support of "locked" idle state
      in WebExtensions API implementation.
    - Chrome extension may be auto uninstalled after upgrade to
      connector version 10. It can be restored using inline
      installation link at https://extensions.gnome.org or using
      Chrome Store.
    - Firefox can consume a lot of CPU and sometime crash on quit
      because of Mozilla's bug bmo#1349874.
  + Updated translations.
- Stop using source service, upstream now does regular releases.
