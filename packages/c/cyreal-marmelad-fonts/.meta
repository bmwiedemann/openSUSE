  <title>Marmelad Cyrillic Font</title>
  <description>Marmelad is designed specifically for medium to large-size headlines and
remains well-balanced for long text setting because of its regular
proportions and medium contrast. Ascenders and descenders are elegant
and details refined. The name and overall feel refers to marmalade
sweets â€“ soft and ductile.

All vertical strokes are rounded towards the baseline, which is why
technically there is no sense for overshoots in rounded letters like O.
Marmelad performs well on screen because of its soft rounded features
and generous x-height.

The font supports Latin-1, Cyrillic and Turkish (Latin-5) encoding.
