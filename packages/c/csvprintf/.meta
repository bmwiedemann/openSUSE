  <title>Simple CSV file parser for the UNIX command line</title>
  <description>
  csvprintf is a simple UNIX command line utility for parsing CSV files.

  cvsprintf works just like the printf(1) command line utility. You supply
  a printf(1) format string on the command line and each record in the
  CSV file is formatted accordingly. Each format specifier in the format
  string contains a column accessor to specify which CSV column to use,
  so for example %3$d would format the third column as a decimal value.

  csvprintf can also convert CSV files into XML documents and back.
