%description
cmocka is an elegant unit testing framework for C with support for mock
objects. It only requires the standard C library, works on a range of computing
platforms (including embedded) and with different compilers.

Features:
  * Support for mock objects
  * Only requires the C library
  * Several supported output formats (Subunit, TAP, jUnit XML)
  * Fully documented API
  * Test fixtures
  * Exception handling for signals (SIGSEGV, SIGILL, ...)
  * No fork() used
  * Very well tested
  * Testing of memory leaks, buffer overflows and underflows.

Also, CMocka tries to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C
compilers.
