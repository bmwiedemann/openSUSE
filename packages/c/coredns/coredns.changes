- Fix summary of coredns-extras.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 10:19:48 UTC 2019 - Marco Vedovati <mvedovati@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.6.3:
  * Spelling corrections and other minor improvements and polish.
  * Two new plugins: clouddns and sign.

- Changed included from version 1.6.1:
  * Fix a panic in the hosts plugin.
  * The reload now detects changes in files imported from the main Corefile.
  * route53 increases the paging size when talking to the AWS API, this
    decreases the chances of getting throttled.

- Changed included from version 1.6.0:
  * The -cpu flag is removed from this version.
  * This release sports changes in the file plugin.
    A speed up in the log plugin and fixes in the cache and hosts plugins.
  * Upcoming deprecation: the kubernetes federation plugin will be moved to
    github.com/coredns/federation. This is likely to happen in CoreDNS 1.7.0.

- Changed included from version 1.5.2:
  * Small bugfixes and a change to Caddy’s import path
    (mholt/caddy -> caddyserver/caddy).
  * Doing a release helps plugins deal with the change better.

- Changed included from version 1.5.1:
  * Various bugfixes, better documentation and cleanups.
  * The -cpu flag is somewhat redundant (cgroups/systemd/GOMAXPROCS are better
    ways to deal with this) and we want to remove it; if you depend on it in
    some way please voice that in this PR otherwise we’ll remove it in the next
    release.

- Changed included from version 1.5.0:
  * Two new plugins in this release: grpc, and ready. And some polish and 
    simplifications in the core server code.
  * The use of TIMEOUT and no_reload in file and auto have been fully deprecated. 
    As is the proxy plugin.
  * And a update on two important and active bugs:
    - 2593 seems to hone in on Docker and/or the container environment being a 
      contributing factor.
    - 2624 is because of TLS session negotiating in the forward plugin.

- Changed included from version 1.4.0:
  * Our first release after we became a graduated project in CNCF.
  * Deprecation notice for the next release:
    - auto will deprecate TIMEOUT and recommends the use of RELOAD (2516).
    - auto and file will deprecate NO_RELOAD and recommends the use of RELOAD 
      set to 0 (2536).
    - health will revert back to report process level health without plugin status. 
      A new ready plugin will make sure plugins have at least completed their 
      startup sequence.
    - The proxy will be moved to an external repository and as such be 
      deprecated from the default set of plugin; use the forward as a replacement.
    - The previous announced deprecations have been enacted.
    - The (unused) gRPC watch functionally was removed from the server.

Tue Jul  2 23:55:24 UTC 2019 - Daniel Orf <dorf@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.3.1:
  * log now allows multiple names to be specified
  * import was added to give it a README.md to make it’s documentation more discoverable
  * kubernetes TTL is also applied to negative responses (NXDOMAIN, etc)

- Changed included from version 1.3.0:
  * EDNS0 handling in the server and make it compliant with https://dnsflagday.net/
  * k8s_external a new plugin that allows external zones to point to Kubernetes in-cluster services.
  * rewrite fixes a bug where a rule would eat the first character of a name
  * log now supported the metadata labels. It also fixes a bug in the formatting of a plugin logging a info/failure/warning
  * forward removes the dynamic read timeout and uses a fixed value now.
  * kubernetes now checks if a zone transfer is allowed. Also allow a TTL of 0 to avoid caching in the cache plugin.
