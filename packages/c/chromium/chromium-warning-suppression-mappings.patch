Subject: [PATCH] Add warning suppression mapping file to the build

This adds an (empty) warning suppression mapping file, per the linked bug. It controls its use by adding a new gn arg pointing to the file, and passing the WSM to each clang compilation if the arg is set. Since the arg is set in our `.gn` file, consumers of our `build/` directory will see no change, but can choose to use their own WSM file if they wish.

It also contains some hacks/configs to make sure the file gets uploaded by reclient/siso.

So far, the file is unused, but we'll start filling it out as we make progress enabling warnings.

+# Warning Suppression Policy: updates to this file should be tightly controlled,

+#
+# 1. This file should never grow (as measured by the number of files suppressed)
+#    except when a new warning is enabled.
+# 2. This file should only be used to opt out whole directories, never
+#    individual files.
+# 3. This file should be used as a last resort; if it's possible to fix the warning or suppress
+#    it without using the file, do so.
+#    1. For first-party code, just fix it directly, or use `#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored`.
+#    2. For third-party code, first attempt to fix it upstream.
+#    3. If that's not possible, attempt to suppress the warning using `-Wno` flags in a gn file.
+# 4. All entries should have a path to eventually be removed.
+#
+# In practice, rules (3) and (4) mean that the only accepted use case for this file is to
+# speed up rolls or enable a warning slightly sooner, for cases where an upstream fix has been
+# proposed but is likely to take a long time to get merged and rolled into chromium.
+#
+# We may make an exception to the policy for extremely high-value warnings that backslide a lot
+# (such as unsafe buffers), but this is expected to be rare.
+
+# Formatting note: Don't put comments on the same line as a glob pattern! Clang
+# will get confused and the warning won't be suppressed.
