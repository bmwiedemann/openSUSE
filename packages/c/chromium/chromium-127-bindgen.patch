description: fix bindgen-related stuff

Also, the call to bindgen sets the path for libclang to
rust_bindgen_root, which is wrong. We're already passing
clang_base_path with the path to libclang, there's no reason that
we'd expect libclang to be in the same directory as bindgen. That
fix should probably go upstream.
