  * Look in /usr/lib64/qt5/bin for lrelease
  * Fix deprecation warnings.
  * Enable catagorized view by default, might also be a Qt issue?

- Update to 2.3.3:
  * For Opus files, use R128_TRACK_GAIN and R128_ALBUM_GAIN to store
    replaygain values.
  * Remove user-agent checking when serving local files, this is easily
    fake-able and breaks playback to forked-daap (and mopidy?)

  * Initialise network proxy factory when starting.
  * If artist, album, and title are empty in replaygain dialog, then show
    filename in title column.
  * Opus does not use replaygain peak tags, so do not write.
  * Use same 'album key' for all discs in an album, so that playqueue groups
    them together, and shuffle by albums keeps them together.
  * Remove confirmation dialog when saving replaygain tags.
  * Fix saving 'Descending' order for smart playlists.
  * When getting 'basic' title of song, also remove any 'prod. XXX', etc. values.
  * Allow .jpeg as extension from cover dialog.
  * Fix QMediaPlayer stuck with network streams - thanks to theirix
  * Always show volume control.
  * Fix 'Show Current Song Information' (i) toolbar button showing when
    interface is collpased and resized.
  * When expand intrface, don't shrink width. Conversely, when collapsing
    don't expand width.

    one track from the album.
  * Don't try to reduce brackets when showing album name and year.
  * Add option to sort smart playlists by title.
  * Change toolbar colours if palette changes.
  * Add another qt5ct palette work-around.
  * Don't stop library scan just because of failure in 1 directory.
  * Handle empty VolumeIdentifier in MTP devices.
  * Add more actions to search page results.
  * For MPD>=21, use its albumart protocol to fetch covers.
  * When copying tracks to a device, only update cache if configured to do so.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 03 11:47:23 UTC 2018 - enzokiel@kabelmail.de

  * When using Track Organizer to rename music tracks, rename any
    other files that have the same basename as the music file.

    uplayed' is checked, then only download unplayed episodes.

  * Add Brazilian Portuguese translation - thanks to
    Wanderson Gonçalves Pereira.
  * Fix 'Locate In Library / Album' for albums with musicbrainz ID.
  * Check HTTP stream URLs are valid URLs, and scheme starts with
    http.
  * Due to reports of crashes in libvlc code, default to using
    QtMultiMedia for HTTP stream playback on Linux builds (already
    default for Mac/Win).
  * Use ":/" as root path for windows folder browse, seems to then
    list each drive.
  * If a dynamic playlist has rating 0..5 stars, then include all
    songs (even those without an explicit rating).
  * Ubuntu icon theme is now named Yaru, so install there.
  * Don't install Yaru icon by default.

  error in a way not allowed in factory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 28 16:36:41 UTC 2018 - enzokiel@kabelmail.de

  - Added fix-no-return-in-nonvoid-function.diff and

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 08:03:39 UTC 2018 - cornelis@solcon.nl

- Change to Recommends: mpd. mpd can also run remotely without a
  local instance. It still needs some form of mpd, so recommends
  seems the right choice.

- Update to version 1.5.0:
 1. Remove cover size setting, set automatically.
 2. Artist images only shown in grid view.

 6. Simplify view config pages.
 7. Use QUrl with server details to build HTTP address used to compare MPD http
    file paths against.
 8. Store song ratings in MPD's sticker DB. Ratings stored using 'rating' key
    and values 0 to 10. In the UI, ratings are show as 5 stars.
 9. If we fail to download a cover, don't keep trying next time song is played.
10. Simplify toolbar cover widget, no border.
11. Allow preference dialog to shrink smaller. If screen size is less than

    check this setting by calling cantata as follows: CANTATA_NETBOOK=1 cantata
12. Support MPDs "find modified-since" with MPD 0.19 and newer. If a number is
    entered it is taken to be 'modified since X days in past', otherwise a date
    should be entered (e.g. 01/12/2001 to find all tracks since 1st Dec 2001)
    Cantata will first try to convert from your locale date format, default
    date format, and then ISO date format.
13. Show covers in search results.
14. Show performer in cover tooltip if this is set and different to album
    artist.
15. Always large action icons for grid view.
16. Increase gap between add and play icons in grid view.

19. Reorganize playqueue context menu.
20. Use 'Metadata' and not 'Tags' as metadata/tags view in context song pane.
21. Minor changes to song progress slider.
22. Show covers in playlist tree and list views.

    be selected.
24. Also read /com/canonical/desktop/interface/scrollbar-mode to determine if
    overlay scrollbars have been disabled.
25. Add note about 'AlbumArtist' tag to initial settings wizard.
26. Use QDesktopWidget::logicalDpiX()/96.0 to set DPI scale factor.

28. Save QDir::homePath()/ as ~ in config file, and convert when read.
29. Allow all bar title and artist columns to be hidden in playqueue.
30. Add option to disable song info tooltips.
31. Only show icons in message widget buttons if style uses icons for dialog
    buttons.
32. Add option to have separate play queue search action - enabled by default.
33. Revert back to storing scaled covers as JPG. PNG is taking too much space,
    especially with retina displays.
34. Read ArtistSort, AlbumArtistSort, and AlbumSort from MPD. If found, use
    these to sort items.
35. Add 'Full Refresh' action - cuases caches to be removed, and models to be
    completely refreshed.
36. Add actions to mark podcast as episode as listened or new.
37. Add action to cancel podcast downloads.
38. Download podcasts sequentially.
39. Configurable limit to auto podcast downloading.

51. If run under Unity or OSX, then place close buttons on left.
52. Fix auto-marking of played downloaded podcasts when connected via a local
    socket.
53. Fix playback of local files by inbuilt HTTP server.
54. In catata-tags.exe set unhandled exception handler, to prevent windows
    crash dialog appearing.
55. If a command fails to be sent to MPD, and the socket is in an error state,
    then reconnect and update status and playqueue.
56. For windows builds, when window is not focused, draw sidebar selection as
    a darkened background.
57. If MPD supports https, then there is no need to convert SoundCould URLs.
58. If playlist is loaded and replaces playqueue, then start playback of first
    track.
59. Custom/thin scrollbars for context view.
60. If fail to read a Gtk setting from DConf then try GSettings.

- Update to 1.3.4:
  1. Fix adding songs to playqueue with priority when playqueue is not empty.

- Update to 1.3.0:
  1. Basic undo/redo for playqueue.
  2. Search tab - searches performed via MPD. This tab is hidden by default.
  3. Optionally cache scaled covers, to improve loading of albums view. (Displaying of covers should be faster after 1st run, when the scaled contents are saved)
  4. Only start internal HTTP server when required, and stop after last non-MPD track removed from playqueue.
  5. If listallinfo fails then use lsinfo recursively to retrieve the music collection. listallinfo requires more memory with MPD 0.18, and has been reported to fail for large collections.
  6. Cache folder listing (as per music collection), if folders view is used.

 11. Fix short-cuts in preferences dialog.
 12. Dont clear the playqueue when Cantata is passed a song as a commandline at start-up.

    of genres associated with artists.
 3. Fix decoding of details for Online service URLs sent to MPD, and
    subsequently read back.
 4. Dont allow dragging of stream categories onto playqueue.
 5. Replace # in stream names with ${hash} when passing to MPD, and revert when

 2. Optionally show current album cover as backdrop to playqueue.
 3. Add support for a per-user, Cantata controlled, MPD instance.
 4. Option to toggle usage of monochrome sidebar icons.
 5. Simplify, config UI. Only show HTTP settings if more than 1 active interface, dont build Proxy config by default.
 6. Automatically play AudioCD if started with cdda:// URL
 7. Automatically assign accelarators in Qt bulds, to match KDE behaviour.
 8. HTTP stream playback for Qt5 builds with QtMultiMedia. (Disabled from default builds, pass -DENABLE_HTTP_STREAM_PLAYBACK=ON to cmake)

 8. Fix lyrics background when we toggle from showing cover to not showing.
 9. Replace multiple blank lines with single blank line when showing lyrics.

 5. Fix restoring of splitter sizes when we start minimized to system tray.
 6. Fix decoding of Cantata HTTP stream URLs.
 7. Work-around issue of non display of main window when using transparent
    QtCurve theme.
 8. Fix playing of some non-MP3 files external to MPD database via Cantata's
    simple HTTP server.
 9. Fix playing of files containing square brackets, etc, that are external
    to MPD database via Cantata's simple HTTP server.
10. Fix detection of some filetypes.
11. Prevent multiple KDE Cantata windows appearing if app is attempted to be
    started repeatedly in quick succession.
12. For streams, if we have a 'name' but no artist or album title, then just
    display the name (this is usually the Radio Station)
13. For a song to be 'empty', artist, album, title, and name need to be empty.
    This fixes detection of updates to the name field when playing streams.
14. Fix potential memory leak when stopping threads.
15. Only enable play queue save-as and clear buttons if there are items in the
    play queue!
16. Fix detection of streams in play queue when current song is updated.
- Update to version 0.9.1:
1. Fix saving of 'Store covers in MPD dir' setting.
2. Show/hide main window when KDE tray item clicked.
3. Add 'Show Window' to tray item menu.
4. Dont allow to set focus onto clear button in line-edits.
5. Remove animation when showing messagewidget, seems to workaround a crash
   when compiled with KDE and using Oxygen.
6. Fix activation of devices tab via keyboard shortcut.
Update to version 0.9.0:
 1. Add a 'server' mode to cantata-dynamic. This contains a basic HTTP API to
    list rules, update rules, and start/stop the dynamic mode.
 2. Allow use of 'dynamic' playlists in windows builds, but only for server mode
    cantata-dynamic.
 3. Add support for 'Similar Artists' in dynamic mode.
 4. Add a gui setting to control the enforcement of single-click.
 5. When sorting tracks, sort on duration after sorting on name, title, and
    genre. This way if tracks do not have a track number, disc, year, etc, then
    we will sort on the name/title before duration.
 6. When refreshing DB, make sure Albums view is at top level.
 7. Set Artist, AlbumArtist, and Album of cue files to that of assigned album.
 8. Improve item-view mouse over for Gtk+ style - when hovering, draw selection
    into a QPixmap and set painter's opacity before drawing image.
 9. Workaround issue of sometimes having an item (in icon view) staying in
    mouse-over state, even though mouse has left view.
10. For Qt translations, provide two strings for plural translation. One for
    singular (e.g. "1 Track") and one for plural (e.g. "%1 Tracks"). For
    languages that have more than 1 plural form, it is suggested that BOTH
    strings are translatated to the format "Items: %1" - e.g. "1 Track" becomes
    "Tracks: 1", and "%1 Tracks" becomes "Tracks: %1"
11. Device sync support for Qt-only  builds. To support this, a cut-down version
    of Solid is included.
12. Don't enforce oxygen icons for Qt-only (Linux) builds. Check for missing
    icons, and use alternatives.
13. Use a random icon that matches the repeat icon better.
14. Draw the consume icon in code, so that it matches random and repeat better.
15. Add a ON/OFF style checkbox for linux builds when NOT run under KDE, and
    using QGtkStyle.
16. Add a custom spinbox to closer match Gtk3's large button spinbox style.
    Only for linux builds NOT run under KDE, and using QGtkStyle.
17. Add 'Show Window' action to Linux builds - so that we have a way of
    restoring the Cantata window from the Unity menubar.
18. Use freedesktop.org notifications for Qt-only Linux builds.
19. Show menubar when run under Unity (Qt-only build).
20. Improve MPRISv2 interface - signal when proprties change.
21. Play/Pause track when middle click on tray icon for Qt-only builds (KDE
    builds already have this). Thanks to spartanj for the patch.
22. Remove faded icons from background of sync dialog views (as these did not
    render correctly with all styles), and enforce alternate row colours - as
    per other views.
23. Fix image/icon size, and spacing issues, in sync dialog when the library
    view is set to use icon/list style.
24. Add 'Add To Playlist' action to playqueue context menu.
25. Fix retrieval of covers from file-system based devices.
26. Support for modifiable keyboard shortcuts in Qt-only builds. (Code stolen
    from Quassel!)
27. Add option to control whether Cantata should minimise to the notification
    area when closed (default), or terminate.
28. Only save settings when modified.
29. Add option to support GNOME media keys.
30. Add setting to control name (without extension) of downloaded cover files.
31. For KDE builds, if run under Unity set KStatusNotifierItem status to
    Active - otherwise no item appears.
32. Truncate error messages to 150 characters. Set message (up to 500
    characters) as tooltip of message widget.
33. Remove setting of dockmanager item to current cover. This is better handled
    by an external dockmanager helper script, as per amarok, etc.
34. Remove option to enable/disable MPRIS interface, and always have enabled.
35. Disable Phonon stream playback support by default. Currently not all
    Phonon backends seem to work reliably, and there can be delays between
    pressing a button (e.g. start) and the action occuring (due to buffering?).
    To re-enable pass -DENABLE_PHONON=ON to cmake.
36. Handle UTF-8 playlist names.
37. Sort selected playqueue indexes before adding to stored playlist.
38. Update 'Add To Playlist' menu when rename a playlist.
39. Only need to download/parse streams (to check if they are a playlist) when
    added from the streams page. (Streams in an MPD playlist will not be
    playlists themselves, as MPD does not support this.)
40. Allow building of replaygain support with either ffmpeg or mpg123, or both.
41. Display extra information texts in messageboxs and not whats-this popups,
    as QGtkStyle seems to have issues with the palette in these.
42. Fix dynamic playlists with UTF-8 strings.
43. Remove unreferenced library cache's each time connection details are saved.
44. When KDE version is closed via quit action, ensure main window destructor
    is called - so that settings are saved.
45. Compile windows build against taglib 1.8 - enables tag editing and track
    reorganisation.
46. Korean translation - thanks to Min Ho Park.
47. Fix detection of audio codecs for ffmpeg 1.0.
48. Remove libmaia usage.
49. For Linux Qt builds, use dbus to determine single app status.
50. Add connect/disconnect functionality for UMS devices.
51. Fix crash when calling QFileDialog in Qt-only builds when Oxygen or QtCurve
    themes are used.
52. In devices view, only show covers that come from device.
53. Remove folders, albums, and cover art, when deleting tracks from MTP
    devices.
54. Copy covers from MTP devices. (Copying to the device is not currently
    supported.)
55. Show track listing progress when loading MTP devices.
56. For Qt-only Linux builds, check if current icon theme has the
    "document-save-as" icon. If not, then if the user has ether oxugen or gnome
    icon theme installed - set the icon theme name to this.
57. For Qt-only builds, allow to configure the icon theme name via Cantata's
    config file (~/.config/cantata/cantata.conf on Linux). Edit file and add
    (e.g.) the following in the "[General]" section:

        iconTheme=oxygen

    ...there is no GUI for this, as its only a work-around for some window
    managers.
58. If group single tracks, or multiple artists, settings are changed, then
    rebuild library and device models from existing set of songs - as opposed
    to re-reading all songs from mpd/device.
59. If window is minimized to system tray when Cantata is terminated, then
    restore to this state when restarted.
60. Add search line-edits, and expand/collapse all, to sync dialog.
61. Add a 1 pixel border around large cover in top-left corner.
62. When refresh button is pressed send an update and stats request to MPD.
63. Hard-code black background and gray text for cover widget tooltip.
64. Ignore quit action if we have open dialogs.
65. Fix crash when copying items to devices after a rescan has been performed.
66. Use UPower (Linux/Qt) to detect when being resumed, and if so reconnect to
    MPD.
67. In sync dialog, when detecting items unique to library/device, revert
    various artist work-around for each track if it is enabled on the device.
68. Fix memleak when copying items to/from devices.
69. When creating temp files, ensure these are in /tmp!
70. If applying various artist workaround for a remote device, apply the
    workaround to a local temp file, and send this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  4 21:51:29 UTC 2012 - cornelis@solcon.nl

- Update to version 0.8.3.1:
  * Fix Qt-only compile.
- Update to version 0.8.3:
  * Add CMake options to disable 'automagic' dependencies - required for gentoo
    USE flags (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/automagic.xml). Because of this
    WANT_KDE_SUPPORT option has been renamed to ENABLE_KDE
  * When requesting covers from a HTTP server, use QUrl::toPercentEncoding.
  * Fix multiple download attempts when getting covers from HTTP.
  * With KDE builds (4.7 or later), and Windows Qt builds, reconnect to MPD when
    system is resumed. (A reconnect attempt is made every half second for a max
    of 15 seconds)
  * When restoring window from notification area, also raise and activate the
    window.
  * Fix issue with certain styles not drawing selection background in icon view.
  * If we show an error, or info, message whilst using compact interface - then
    adjust size to take message widget into account.
  * If we lose MPD connection, then show error widget.
  * Reset status when connection lost.
  * Don't attempt to send commands if not connected.
  * Update version of KMessageWidget
  * Update Polish translation.
  * Show current song details in tooltip of notification icon for Qt builds as
    per KDE builds.
  * If 'showPage' is called (via DBUS interface), ensure interface is expanded.
  * Save MPD filename scheme settings with MPD server settings.
  * Use QWIDGETSIZE_MAX and not INT_MAX to set maximum height of expanded
    interface.
  * More consistent control of prev/next buttons.
  * Allow 'showPage' dbus command to also show playqueue (if this has been
    placed in the sidebar)
  * Fix handling of filename's with quotes.
  * Fix track order when adding newly added album, via folders page, to
    playqueue.
  * Don't split albums based upon year - this messes up compilation albums,
    where each track may have a different year.
  * To be consistent, use the year of the lowest track number to be an album's
    year.
  * Use "users" group and not "audio" when setting the group ID of covers,
    lyrics, and audio files.
  * If we have no song tag details, show filename in playqueue.
  * In KDE builds, check if MPD is readable each time we get a device added
    or removed signal from Solid if using KDE4.9. If we are using an older KDE,
    or using Qt-only (on Linux) then watch for changes to /proc/mounts
  * If the date string received from MPD is longer than 4 characters, just use
    the first 4 - as we are only interested in the year.
  * If not changing artist/albumartist/album of a track in tag editor, then
    just update track if possible - as opposed to removing and adding to list
    (which causes a complete refresh of list)
  * When displaying cover tooltip, if image is too big or image file is not
    found (as is the case for embedded covers), then save the image into a
    base64 array as a PNG - and have Qt use this in the 'img' tag.
  * Use correct palette (Active/Inactive) when drawing item text.
  * Force single-click activation in views. To enable double-click mode (which
    depends upon the style), edit cantatarc (KDE) or cantata.conf (Qt only) and
    set 'forceSingleClick=false' in the '[General]' section.
  * When looking for album covers, also check for "${file}.jpg/png",
    "${albumArtist} - ${album}.jpg/png" and "${album}.jpg/png" within current
    songs folder. (These are checked AFTER cover.jpg/png, etc.)
  * Improve FancyTabWidget appearance for Gtk+ style - when hovering, draw
    selection into a QImage and set painter's opacity before drawing image.
  * Elide to right (or left for RTL) strings in sidebar.
  * Dont clear genre list when clearing music library model.
  * If we are grouping multiple-artists albums under 'Various Artists', then
    we also need to place 'Various Artists' albums there as well. This oddity
    can occur when i18n('Various Artists') != 'Various Artists'
  * Add 'Back' action to context menu of list/icon views.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 27 08:27:38 UTC 2012 - cornelis@solcon.nl

- Updated project's URLs

--- --------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 21 11:48 UTC 2012
+ update to version 0.8.1
  - Detect when this is the first time a user has run Cantata. If so, don't place the play queue in the sidebar.
  - Dont attempt to rename a playlist to its current name - otherwise it is deleted!
  - When applying updates in tag editor, track organizer, or replay gain dialog show a progress bar to indicate activity.
  - Display version number in Qt-only about dialog.

  - If 'Music folder' in settings dialog is a http folder (path starts with http://), then attempt to download cover-art from the http server.
  - Dont update MPD volume just after we receive a status update - as MPD already has that setting! Fixes an issue with pulseaudio setups - where MPD disconnects from pulse audio, tells cantata that volume is -1, and cantata attempts to set volume to 0.
  - When fading on stop, reset original volume immediately before sending stop.
  - Fix saving of library to XML cache when multiple artist albums are grouped under 'Various Artists' (only save artist attribute once!!)
  - Use command list when adding songs to playlist.

  - Disable volume control if MPD returns a volume of -1 - as it does when the mixer is disabled.
  - Read images from mp3 (ID3v2), mp4, flac, and ogg files.

  - Fix/workaround issues with fetching lyrics from letras.mus.br
  - Add option to specify HTTP server listen address/interface.
  - Support MPD queue functionality. Add an 'Add With Priority' to menu of library, etc, views. Add a 'Set Priority' to play queue. Requires MPD 0.17.0 or newer.
  - Only ignore closeEvent if this is a 'spontaneous' event and we have a tray icon.
  - Drastically reduce replay-gain calculation memory usage.
  - Make more columns italic in replaygain dailog to make entries that will be modified.
  - Make TagLib optional.
  - Adjust size of covers in grouped view, icons in views, and main cover preview based upon font size.
  - Add an extra cover-size setting (Automatic) which will adjust the covers in library and albums view based upon font size.

  - When reading mpd.conf file, if bind_to_address is set to "any", then use default of "locahost".
  - Fix noticing of tag changes when MPD database is updated. When comparing songs need to check all fields - not just filename!
  - Fix usage of tekstowo.pl and vagalume.com.br in lyrics settings.
  - Stop position timer whilst dragging slider.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 24 18:03 UTC 2012

  - Attempt to fix errors in cache where the displayed name was saved.
  - Fix tag-editor's 'Various Artists' workaround when all tracks is selected.
  - Set minimum font size for info page.

  - Fix detection of non standard filename covers.
  - Clear any existing search when 'Locate In Library' is activated.
  - In tag-editor, only set placeholder text to '(Various)' for fields wherethere are actually some values set.
  - Add now playing info to MPRIS interface - thanks to Martin Blumenstingl for the patch.
  - Better, less hacky, workaround for QAbstractItemView shift-select bug (https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-18009). Thanks to Spitfire
    from qtcentre.org forums for fix.
  - Add a 'search' action (Ctrl-F) that will move focus to curent tab's search field - or to play queue search field (if play queue has focus).
  - Add 'Raise' support to MPRIS interface.
  - Added a cantata-specific dbus interface with 'showPage(page, focusSearch)' method. So, to raise cantata, show library page, and focus on its search field:
    qdbus org.kde.cantata /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 Raise
    qdbus org.kde.cantata /cantata showPage library true

  - Add option to sort albumview by artist/year/album.
  - Add dialog where user can specify artist and title to fetch lyrics - useful if automatic fetching fails.

- Update to version 0.5.1
  * Reduce QMutex usage - have MPDStats/MPDStatus emitted as objects, and stored in relevant classes.
  * When renaming files, rename file.lyrics if it exists.
  * Use QDateTime::toString(Qt::SystemLocaleShortDate) to show server last update in server info page.
  * TagLib is required for build.
  * Enable tag editor for Qt builds.
  * Qt-only build does not install icons, so we need to embed the 16px and 22px version of each into the application.
  * Save lyrics and info pages zoom settings.
  * If compiled for Qt-only, and icon theme is not oxygen, then check to see if current icon theme has required icons (devices/media-optical-audio, etc) If not, then if oxygen is installed - set icon theme to oxygen.
  * Allocate more space for tab if required - up to a max of 50% extra. This fixes "HTTP Server" config page title under Ubuntu with Qt-only build.
  * Install icon for Qt-only build.
