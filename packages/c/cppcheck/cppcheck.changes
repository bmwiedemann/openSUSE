  * Support importing projects with project-name

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 14 11:18:59 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.12.0:
  * uselessOverride finds overriding functions that either
    duplicate code from or delegate back to the base class
    implementation
  * knownPointerToBool finds pointer to bool conversions that are
    always true or false
  * truncLongCastAssignment and truncLongCastReturn check
    additional types, including float/double/long double
  * duplInheritedMember also reports duplicated member functions
  * constParameter*/constVariable* checks find more instances of
    pointers/references that can be const, e.g. when calling
    library functions
  * Write how many checkers was activated after a run
  * Added --checkers-report that can be used to generate a report
    in a file that shows what checkers was activated and disabled
  * The qmake build system has been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future version.
  * Command-line option '--template
- update to 2.11:
  * pop_back on empty container is UB
  * Improve useStlAlgorithm check to handle many more conditions
    in the loop for any_of, all_of and none_of algorithms
  * ValueFlow can evaluate the return value of functions even
    when conditionals are used
  * ValueFlow will now forward the container sizes being returned
    from a function
  * ValueFlow can infer possible values from possible symbolic
    values
  * Improve valueflow after pushing to container
  * The new option --check-level= has been added that controls
    how much checking is made by Cppcheck. The default checking
    level is "normal". If you feel that you can wait longer on
    results you can use --check-level=exhaustive.
  * It is no longer necessary to run "--check-config" to get
    detailed "missingInclude" and "missingIncludeSystem"
    messages. They will always be issued in the regular analysis
    if "missingInclude" is enabled.
  * "missingInclude" and "missingIncludeSystem" are reported with
    "-j" is > 1 and processes are used in the backend (default in
    non-Windows binaries)
  * "missingInclude" and "missingIncludeSystem" will now cause
    the "--error-exitcode" to be applied
  * "--enable=information" will no longer implicitly enable
    "missingInclude" starting with 2.16. Please enable it
    explicitly if you require it.
  * The `constParameter` and `constVariable` checks have been
    split into 3 different IDs based on if the variable is a
    pointer, a reference, or local. The different IDs will allow
    users to suppress different const warning based on variable
    type.
  * `constParameter`
  * `constParameterReference`
  * `constParameterPointer`
  * `constVariable`
  * `constVariableReference`
  * `constVariablePointer`
  * More command-line parameters will now check if the given
    integer argument is actually valid. Several other internal
    string-to-integer conversions will now be error checked.
  * scanning projects (with -j1) will now defer the analysis of
    markup files until the whole code was processed
- add werror-return-type.patch to fix false warnings where
  gcc can not properly detect the "noreturn" nature of the function

Tue May 30 10:57:47 UTC 2023 - Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>

    which fails on "unsigned char" archs (arm, ppc)
  * Run test suite with "-j1", as TestProcessExecutor test is flaky otherwise

    "NO_WINDOWS_SEH"
  * detect more redundant calls of std::string::c_str(), std::string::substr(),
    and unnecessary copies of containers
  * Add a match function to addon similiar to Token::Match used internally by
    cppcheck:

Thu Oct 18 08:43:15 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.85:
  Changes from 1.83:
  Command line:
  - fixes in parser
  - Improved loading of platform files.
  GUI:
  - few minor improvements in user interface
  - Code preview
  - Added MISRA addon integration
  - Platform can be selected in project settings
  - Fixed issue when loading xml results file
  Addons:
  - We are now officially releasing our MISRA addon. So far it supports MISRA C 2012.
  Changes from 1.85:
  General:
  - We are modernizing the Cppcheck code. Support for MSVC 2010 and GCC 4.4 is dropped.
    You now need a compiler that is at least as good as MSVC 2013 or GCC 4.6.
  Checking improvements:
  - New check: Suggest STL algorithms instead of hard-coded for loops
  - New check: Warn about ineffective algorithms (same iterator passed)
  - New check: Mismatching iterators used together in operators
  - Container (STL/Qt/WxWidgets/etc) access out of bounds
  - Improved the checkers that warns about same/opposite expressions, track variable values better.
  - Variable scope: warn about references also
  Graphical user interface:
  - You can specify undefines in the project file dialog
  - Fixed configuration of suppressions
  - Windows: Fixed issue of wrong/no theme being applied to UI elements
  Misra:
  - support per file excludes from cppcheck
  - support per file suppressions from cppcheck
  - summary will now summarize results for all files again
  - a few false positives were fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 10:40:07 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 1.82
  Bug fixes:
  * Better handling of namespaces
  * Fixed false positives
  * Fixed parsing of compile databases
  * Fixed parsing of visual studio projects
  Enhancements
  * New check; Detect mistakes when there are multiple strcmp() in
    condition
    Example:
     if (strcmp(password,"A")==0 || strcmp(password,"B")==0 || strcmp(password,"C"))
     There is a missing '==0', and therefore this condition is
     always true except when password is "C".
  * New check; pointer calculation result can't be NULL unless
    there is overflow
   Example:
     someType **list_p = ...;
     if ((list_p + 1) == NULL)
   The result for '(list_p + 1)' can't be NULL unless there is
   overflow (UB).
  * New check; public interface of classes should be safe - detect
    possible division by zero
    Example:
      class Fred {
      public:
      void setValue(int mul, int div) {
        value = mul / div; // <- unsafe
      }
      ...
    This check does not consider how Fred::setValue() is really
    called.
    If you agree that the public interface of classes should
    always be safe; it should be allowed to call all public
    methods with arbitrary arguments, then this checker will be
    useful.
  * Fixed a few false negatives
  * More information in the cfg files

  version 1.81
  CPPCHECK:
  * New warning: Check if condition after an early return is
    overlapping and therefore always false.
  * Improved knowledge about C/C++ standard, windows, posix,
    wxwidgets, gnu
  * Better handling of Visual Studio projects
  GUI:
  * Compile: Qt5 is now needed to build the GUI
  * Compile: New qmake flag HAVE_QCHART
  * Project: You can now run cppcheck-addons
  * Project: We have integrated clang-tidy
  * Results view: Reload last results (if cppcheck build dir is
    used) when GUI is started
  * Results view: Tag the warnings with custom keywords
    (bug/todo/not important/etc..)
  * Results view: Shows when warning first appeared (since date)
  * Results view: Suppress warnings through right-click menu
  * Statistics: Added charts (shown if Qt charts module is enabled
    during build)

  version 1.80
  Checking improvements:
  * Added platform for Atmel AVR 8 bit microcontrollers (avr8)
  * Better 'callstacks' in cppcheck messages
  * Improved gnu.cfg, posix.cfg, wxwidgets.cfg and std.cfg, added
    motif.cfg

    parsing
  Command line changes:

    instead of --append and will then allow you to use #define etc also.
  - The threads handling has been improved. Using -jN now works in
    windows also.

  - NULL pointers: Improved checking of default function
    argument values.
