- Workaround for CMake lacking a CFGDIR variable.
  * Patch was submitted (https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/pull/1554)

Thu Oct 18 08:43:15 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.85:
  Changes from 1.83:
  Command line:
  - fixes in parser
  - Improved loading of platform files.
  GUI:
  - few minor improvements in user interface
  - Code preview
  - Added MISRA addon integration
  - Platform can be selected in project settings
  - Fixed issue when loading xml results file
  Addons:
  - We are now officially releasing our MISRA addon. So far it supports MISRA C 2012.
  Changes from 1.85:
  General:
  - We are modernizing the Cppcheck code. Support for MSVC 2010 and GCC 4.4 is dropped.
    You now need a compiler that is at least as good as MSVC 2013 or GCC 4.6.
  Checking improvements:
  - New check: Suggest STL algorithms instead of hard-coded for loops
  - New check: Warn about ineffective algorithms (same iterator passed)
  - New check: Mismatching iterators used together in operators
  - Container (STL/Qt/WxWidgets/etc) access out of bounds
  - Improved the checkers that warns about same/opposite expressions, track variable values better.
  - Variable scope: warn about references also
  Graphical user interface:
  - You can specify undefines in the project file dialog
  - Fixed configuration of suppressions
  - Windows: Fixed issue of wrong/no theme being applied to UI elements
  Misra:
  - support per file excludes from cppcheck
  - support per file suppressions from cppcheck
  - summary will now summarize results for all files again
  - a few false positives were fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 10:40:07 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 1.82
  Bug fixes:
  * Better handling of namespaces
  * Fixed false positives
  * Fixed parsing of compile databases
  * Fixed parsing of visual studio projects
  Enhancements
  * New check; Detect mistakes when there are multiple strcmp() in
    condition
    Example:
     if (strcmp(password,"A")==0 || strcmp(password,"B")==0 || strcmp(password,"C"))
     There is a missing '==0', and therefore this condition is
     always true except when password is "C".
  * New check; pointer calculation result can't be NULL unless
    there is overflow
   Example:
     someType **list_p = ...;
     if ((list_p + 1) == NULL)
   The result for '(list_p + 1)' can't be NULL unless there is
   overflow (UB).
  * New check; public interface of classes should be safe - detect
    possible division by zero
    Example:
      class Fred {
      public:
      void setValue(int mul, int div) {
        value = mul / div; // <- unsafe
      }
      ...
    This check does not consider how Fred::setValue() is really
    called.
    If you agree that the public interface of classes should
    always be safe; it should be allowed to call all public
    methods with arbitrary arguments, then this checker will be
    useful.
  * Fixed a few false negatives
  * More information in the cfg files

  version 1.81
  CPPCHECK:
  * New warning: Check if condition after an early return is
    overlapping and therefore always false.
  * Improved knowledge about C/C++ standard, windows, posix,

  GUI:
  * Compile: Qt5 is now needed to build the GUI
  * Compile: New qmake flag HAVE_QCHART

  * Results view: Reload last results (if cppcheck build dir is
    used) when GUI is started
  * Results view: Tag the warnings with custom keywords
    (bug/todo/not important/etc..)
  * Results view: Shows when warning first appeared (since date)
  * Results view: Suppress warnings through right-click menu
  * Statistics: Added charts (shown if Qt charts module is enabled
    during build)

    enforce checking the code as C++)

  - The threads handling has been improved. Using -jN now works in 
    windows also.
