  <title>A tool for static C/C++ code analysis</title>
  <description>This program tries to detect bugs that your C/C++ compiler don't see. Cppcheck is versatile. You can check non-standard code that includes various compiler extensions, inline assembly code, etc. Checking covers for example these errors:

 * Out of bounds
 * Uninitialized member variable 'classname::varname'
 * Using 'memfunc' on class
 * Using 'memfunc' on struct that contains a 'std::classname'
 * Class Base which is inherited by class Derived does not have a virtual destructor
 * Memory leak: varname
 * Resource leak: varname
 * Deallocating a deallocated pointer: varname
 * Using 'varname' after it is deallocated / released
 * Invalid radix in call to strtol or strtoul. Must be 0 or 2-36
 * Overlapping data buffer varname
 * Unsigned division. The result will be wrong.
 * Unusual pointer arithmetic
