- c-ares 1.30.0

Features:

* Basic support for SIG RR record (RFC 2931 / RFC 2535) [PR #773]

Changes:
* Validation that DNS strings can only consist of printable ascii characters
  otherwise will trigger a parse failure. [75de16c] and [40fb125]

Bugfixes:
* QueryCache: Fix issue where purging on server changes wasn't working. [a6c8fe6]

- updated dowload URLs to point to github
- updated keyring to include Brad House DA7D64E4C82C6294CB73A20E22E3D13B5411B7CA

Sun Jun  2 02:30:49 UTC 2024 - jun wang <jgwang@suse.com>

- c-ares 1.29.0

Features:
  * When using ARES_OPT_EVENT_THREAD, automatically reload
    system configuration when network conditions change.
    [PR #759]
  * Apple: reimplement DNS configuration reading to more
    accurately pull DNS settings. [PR #750]
  * Add observability into DNS server health via a server state
    callback, invoked whenever a query finishes. [PR #744]
  * Add server failover retry behavior, where failed servers are
    retried with small probability after a minimum delay.
    [PR #731]

Changes:
  * Mark ares_channel_t * as const in more places in the public
    API. [PR #758]

Bugfixes:
  * Due to a logic flaw dns name compression writing was not
    properly implemented which would result in the name prefix not
    being written for a partial match. This could cause issues in
    various record types such as MX records when using the
    deprecated API. Regression introduced in 1.28.0. [Issue #757]
  * Revert OpenBSD SOCK_DNS flag, it doesn't do what the docs say
    it does and causes c-ares to become non-functional. [PR #754]
  * ares_getnameinfo(): loosen validation on salen parameter.
    [Issue #752]
  * cmake: Android requires C99. [PR #748]
  * ares_queue_wait_empty() does not honor timeout_ms >= 0.

  * Add function `ares_search_dnsrec()` to search for records
    using the new DNS record data structures. [PR #719]
  * Rework internals to pass around `ares_dns_record_t` instead of
    binary data, this introduces new public functions of
    `ares_query_dnsrec()` and `ares_send_dnsrec()`. [PR #730]

Changes:
  * tests: when performing simulated queries, reduce timeouts
    to make tests run faster
  * Replace configuration file parsers with memory-safe parser. [PR #725]
  * Remove `acountry` completely, the manpage might still get
    installed otherwise. [Issue #718]

Bugfixes:
  * CMake: don't overwrite global required libraries/definitions/includes
    which could cause build errors for projects chain building c-ares.
    [Issue #729]
  * On some platforms, `netinet6/in6.h` is not included by `netinet/in.h`
    and needs to be included separately. [PR #728]
  * Fix a potential memory leak in `ares_init()`. [Issue #724]
  * Some platforms don't have the `isascii()` function.
    Implement as a macro. [PR #721]

- c-ares 1.27.0
  Security:
  * Moderate. CVE-2024-25629. Reading malformatted /etc/resolv.conf,
    /etc/nsswitch.conf or the HOSTALIASES file could result in a crash.
    GHSA-mg26-v6qh-x48q (CVE-2024-25629, bsc#1220279)

  Features:
  * New function ares_queue_active_queries() to retrieve number of in-flight
    queries. PR #712
  * New function ares_queue_wait_empty() to wait for the number of in-flight
    queries to reach zero. PR #710
  * New ARES_FLAG_NO_DEFLT_SVR for ares_init_options() to return a failure if
    no DNS servers can be found rather than attempting to use 127.0.0.1. This
    also introduces a new ares status code of ARES_ENOSERVER. PR #713

  Changes:
  * EDNS Packet size should be 1232 as per DNS Flag Day. PR #705

  Bugfixes:

Fri Feb  9 07:35:39 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Ensure multibuild flavors result in different src names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  3 09:40:16 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- c-ares 1.26.0:
  * Event Thread support. Integrators are no longer required to
    monitor the file descriptors registered by c-ares for events
    and call ares_process() when enabling the event thread feature
    via ARES_OPT_EVENT_THREAD passed to ares_init_options().
  * Added flags to are_dns_parse() to force RAW packet parsing
  * Mark ares_fds() as deprecated
  * Bug fixes
- move tests into a build flavor to avoid gtest/gmock build loop

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  8 10:16:54 UTC 2024 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de> - 1.25

- Update to version 1.25
Changes:
 o Rewrite ares_strsplit() as a wrapper for ares__buf_split() for memory
   safety reasons.
 o The ahost utility now uses ares_getaddrinfo() and returns both IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses by default.

Bug Fixes:
 o Tests: Live reverse lookups for Google's public DNS servers no longer
   return results, replace with CloudFlare pubic DNS servers.
 o Connection failures should increment the server failure count first or a
   retry might be enqueued to the same server
 o On systems that don't implement the ability to enumerate network interfaces
   the stubs used the wrong prototype.
 o Fix minor warnings and documentation typos
 o Fix support for older GoogleTest versions
 o getrandom() may require sys/random.h on some systems.
 o Fix building tests with symbol hiding enabled.

- 0001-Use-RPM-compiler-options.patch: dropped, obsolete

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 11:35:57 UTC 2024 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de> - 1.24

- Update to version 1.24
Features:
  * Add support for IPv6 link-local DNS servers. Nameserver formats
    can now accept the 0face suffix, and a new ares_get_servers_csv()
    function was added to return servers that can contain the link-local
    interface name.

Changes:
  * Unbundle GoogleTest for test cases. Package maintainers will now
    need torequire GoogleTest (GMock) as a build dependency if
    building tests. New GoogleTest versions require C++14 or later.
  * Replace nameserver parsing code to use new memory-safe functions.
  * Replace the sortlist parser with new memory-safe functions.
  * Various warning fixes and dead code removal. 

Bugfixes:
 * Old Linux versions require POSIX_C_SOURCE or _GNU_SOURCE to
   compile with thread safety support
 * A non-responsive DNS server that caused timeouts wouldn't
   increment thefailure count, this would lead to other servers
   not being tried. Regression introduced in 1.22.0
 * Some projects that depend on c-ares expect invalid parameter
   option valuespassed into ares_init_options() to simply be
   ignored. This behavior has been restored
 * getrandom() can fail if the kernel doesn't support
   the syscall, fall back to another random source
 * ares_cancel() when performing ares_gethostbyname() or
   ares_getaddrinfo()with AF_UNSPEC, if called after one address
   class was returned but before the other address class, it
   would return ARES_SUCCESS rather than ARES_ECANCELLED

- disable-live-tests.patch: dropped, not needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 13:04:38 UTC 2023 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de> - 1.23

- Update to version 1.23
  Features:
    Introduce optional (but on by default) thread-safety for the c-ares library. This has no API nor ABI implications.
    resolv.conf in modern systems uses attempts and timeouts options instead of the old retrans and retry options.
    Query caching support based on TTL of responses. Can be enabled via ares_init_options() with ARES_OPT_QUERY_CACHE. 
  Bugfixes:
    ares_init_options() for ARES_OPT_UDP_PORT and ARES_OPT_TCP_PORT accept theport in host byte order, but it was reading it as network byte order. Regression introduced in 1.20.0.
    ares_init_options() for ARES_FLAG_NOSEARCH was not being honored forares_getaddrinfo() or ares_gethostbyname(). Regression introduced in 1.16.0.
    Autotools MacOS and iOS version check was failing
    Environment variables passed to c-ares are meant to be an override for system configuration. Regression introduced in 1.22.0.
    Spelling fixes as detected by codespell.
    The timeout returned by ares_timeout() was truncated to milliseconds butvalidated to microseconds which could cause a user to attempt to process timeouts prior to the timeout actually expiring.
    CMake was not honoring CXXFLAGS passed in via the environment which couldcause compile and link errors with distribution hardening flags during packaging.
    Fix Windows UWP and Cygwin compilation.
    ares_set_servers_*() for legacy reasons needs to accept an empty server listand zero out all servers. This results in an inoperable channel and thus is only used in simulation testing, but we don't want to break users. Regression introduced in 1.21.0. 

Changes in version 1.22.1
  Bugfixes:
    Fix /etc/hosts processing performance with all entries using same IPaddress. Large hosts files using the same IP address for all entries could use exponential time.
    Fix typos in manpages
    Fix OpenWatcom building 

Changes in version 1.22.0
  Features:
    ares_reinit() is now implemented to re-read any system configuration and immediately apply to an existing ares channel
    The adig command line program has been rewritten and its format now more closely matches that of BIND's dig utility
    The new DNS message parser and writer functions have now been made public
    RFC9460 HTTPS and SVCB records are now supported
    RFC6698 TLSA records are now supported
    The server list is now internally dynamic and can be changed without impacting existing queries
    Hosts file processing is now cached until the file is detected to be changed to speed up repetitive lookups of large hosts files 
  Changes:
    Internally all DNS messages are now written using the new DNS writing functions
    EDNS is now enabled by default
    Internal cleanups in function prototypes 
  Bugfixes:
    Randomize retry penalties to prevent thundering herd issues when dns servers throttle requests
    Fix Windows build error for missing if_indextoname()

  * Remove bin/acountry from built tools as nerd.dk is gone
  * Default per-query timeout has been reduced to 2s with a 3x retry count
  * rand: add support for getrandom()

  Bug fixes:
  * TCP back to back queries were broken
  * Ensure queries for ares_getaddrinfo() are not requeued during
    destruction
  * ares_getaddrinfo() should not retry other address classes if
    one address class has already been returned
  * Avoid production ill-formed result when qualifying a name
    with the root domain
  * Fix missing prefix for CMake generated libcares.pc
  * DNS server ports can now be read from system configuration
    instead of defaulting to port 53, aka openBSD resolv.conf format
  * Replace usages of sprintf with snprintf

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 1.19.0
  Security:
  * Low. Stack overflow in ares_set_sortlist() which is used
    during c-ares initialization and typically provided by an
    administrator and not an end user.
    (bsc#1208067, CVE-2022-4904)
  Changes:
  * Add ARES_OPT_HOSTS_FILE similar to ARES_OPT_RESOLVCONF for
    specifying a custom hosts file location.
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix memory leak in reading /etc/hosts when using localhost
    fallback.

    tries due to search criteria.
  * Asterisks should be allowed in host validation as CNAMEs may
    reference wildcard domains.
  * AutoTools build system referenced bad STDC_HEADERS macro.
  * Even if one address class returns a failure for
    ares_getaddrinfo() we should still return the results we have.
  * Fix ares_getaddrinfo() numerical address resolution with
    AF_UNSPEC
  * Fix tools and help information.
  * Various documentation fixes and cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  7 16:57:20 UTC 2021 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- update to 1.18.1. Changes since 1.17.2:
  * Allow '/' as a valid character for a returned name for
    CNAME in-addr.arpa delegation
  * no longer forwards requests for localhost resolution per RFC6761
  * During a domain search, treat ARES_ENODATA as ARES_NXDOMAIN so

    in the search.
  * Provide ares_nameser.h as a public interface as needed by NodeJS
  * Add support for URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) records via
    ares_parse_uri_reply()

- disable unit tests for SLE12 since GCC compiler too old to build

- new upstream website
- drop multibuild - tests do not require static library anymore
- spec file cleanup
- drop sources that were re-added to upstream distibution

- 5c995d5.patch: augment input validation on hostnames to allow _
  as part of DNS response (bsc#1190225)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 12 13:59:07 UTC 2021 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- update to 1.17.2:
  Security:
  * When building c-ares with CMake, the RANDOM_FILE would not be set
    and therefore downgrade to the less secure random number generator
  * If ares_getaddrinfo() was terminated by an ares_destroy(),
    it would cause a crash
  * Crash in sortaddrinfo() if the list size equals 0 due to
    an unexpected DNS response
  * Expand number of escaped characters in DNS replies as per
    RFC1035 5.1 to prevent spoofing follow-up
    (bsc#1188881, CVE-2021-3672)

    due to applications not performing valiation themselves 

  Changes:
  * ares_malloc(0) is now defined behavior (returns NULL) rather than system-specific to catch edge cases 

  Bug fixes:
  * Building tests should not force building of static libraries except on Windows
  * Relative headers must use double quotes to prevent pulling in a system library

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 16 15:05:28 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.17.1:
    Travis: add iOS target built with CMake (#378)
    Issue #377 suggested that CMake builds for iOS with c-ares were broken. This PR adds an automatic Travis build for iOS CMake.
  - fix build
    External projects were using non-public header ares_dns.h, make public again (#376)
    It appears some outside projects were relying on macros in ares_dns.h, even
    though it doesn't appear that header was ever meant to be public.  That said,
    we don't want to break external integrators so we should distribute this header
    again.
  - note that so versioning has moved to configure.ac
  - note about 1.17.1
  - fix sed gone wrong
    autotools cleanup (#372)
    * buildconf: remove custom logic with autoreconf

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 17 12:07:22 UTC 2020 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Version update to 1.17.0
  Security:
  * avoid read-heap-buffer-overflow in ares_parse_soa_reply found during
    fuzzing
  * Avoid theoretical buffer overflow in RC4 loop comparison
  * Empty hquery->name could lead to invalid memory access
  * ares_parse_{a,aaaa}_reply() could return a larger *naddrttls than was
    passed in (bsc#1178882, CVE-2020-8277)

  Changes:
  * Update help information for adig, acountry, and ahost
  * Test Suite now uses dynamic system-assigned ports rather than hardcoded
    ports to prevent failures in containers
  * Detect remote DNS server does not support EDNS using rules from RFC 6891
  * Source tree has been reorganized to use a more modern layout
  * Allow parsing of CAA Resource Record

  Bug fixes:
  * readaddrinfo bad sizeof()
  * Test cases should honor HAVE_WRITEV flag, not depend on WIN32
  * FQDN with trailing period should be queried first
  * ares_getaddrinfo() was returning members of the struct as garbage values if
    unset, and was not honoring ai_socktype and ai_protocol hints.
  * ares_gethostbyname() with AF_UNSPEC and an ip address would fail
  * Properly document ares_set_local_ip4() uses host byte order

For details, see https://c-ares.haxx.se/changelog.html

Thu Sep 10 01:31:11 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Implement multibuild specfile to split out tests into its own
  flavor; this way we can build and run tests, which require
  static lib, as well as avoid packaging the latter without issues
  with the installed cmake file..

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  8 20:35:17 UTC 2020 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Version update to 1.16.1
  Security:
  * Prevent possible use-after-free and double-free in ares_getaddrinfo() if 
    ares_destroy() is called prior to ares_getaddrinfo() completing. 
	Reported by Jann Horn at Google Project Zero.
  Changes:
  * Allow TXT records on CHAOS qclass. Used for retriving things like
    version.bind, version.server, authoris.bind, hostname.bind, and id.server. [3] 
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix Windows Unicode incompatibilities with ares_getaddrinfo() [1]
  * Silence false cast-align compiler warnings due to valid casts of struct
    sockaddr to struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6.
  * MacOS should use libresolv for retrieving DNS servers, like iOS
  * CMake build system should populate the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property of
    installed targets [2]
  * Correct macros in use for the ares_getaddrinfo.3 man page
- Changes in version 1.16.0
  Changes:
  * Introduction of ares_getaddrinfo() API which provides similar output
    (including proper sorting as per RFC 6724) to the system native API, but
	utilizes different data structures in order to provide additional
	information such as TTLs and all aliases. Please reference the respective
	man pages for usage details.
  * Parse SOA records from ns_t_any response
  * CMake: Provide c-ares version in package export file
  * CMake: Add CPACK functionality for DEB and RPM
  * CMake: Generate PDB files during build
  * CMake: Support manpage installation
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix bad expectation in IPv6 localhost test.
  * AutoTools: use XC_CHECK_BUILD_FLAGS instead of XC_CHECK_USER_FLAGS to
    prevent complaints about CPPFLAGS in CFLAGS.
  * Fix .onion handling
  * Command line usage was out of date for adig and ahost.
  * Typos in manpages
  * If ares_getenv is defined, it must return a value on all platforms
  * If /etc/resolv.conf has invalid lookup values, use the defaults.
  * Tests: Separate live tests from SetServers* tests as only live tests
    should require internet access.
  * ares_gethostbyname() should return ENODATA if no valid A or AAAA record
    is found, but a CNAME was found.
  * CMake: Rework library function checking to prevent unintended linking
    with system libraries that aren't needed.
  * Due to use of inet_addr() it was not possible to return 255.255.255.255
    from ares_gethostbyname().
  * CMake: Fix building of tests on Windows 
- Drop regression.patch which have been fixed upstream
- Refresh disable-live-tests.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 28 15:52:23 UTC 2020 - Michał Rostecki <mrostecki@opensuse.org>

- Add netcfg as the build requirement and runtime requirement.
  ares_getaddrinfo function uses the getservbyport_r function which
  requires the /etc/services file to function properly. That config
  file is provided by the netcfg package. Unit tests rely on it
  too, hence it has to be a build dependency as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
