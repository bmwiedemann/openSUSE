    original.
  * Linux binary installer: Various improvements to the binary installer.
    It now creates an un-installer (calibre-uninstall) that will remove
    all files created by the installer. It also no longer asks for the
    installation directory. If you wish to change that, you need to
    specify it in the installation command itself. Also the installer is
    now downloaded securely via HTTPS from github and verifies the
    signature of the installed files. Finally, it can be used to create an
    isolated install, that only makes changes to files in the installation
    directory and does not require root privileges.
  * Metadata download: Add an option to merge the downloaded comments into
    existing comments, instead of overwriting (Preferences->Metadata
    download).

    whenever they are opened for editing. Look under 'Editor Settings' in
    the Edit Book Preferences.
  * Bulk metadata download: When reviewing downloaded metadata allow
    hiding the controls on the comments box by right clicking in the

  * Smarten punctuation: Correct handling for decade abbreviations like
    '60s and measurements in feet and inches like 1' 2".

    do not use shorthand CSS properties as the Nook cannot handle them.
  * Conversion: Fix incorrect CSS being generated when converting files
    that have  tags with width or height attributes that contain
    fractional numbers.
  * Edit Book: When editing EPUB files, and a file is added in META-INF/
    do not automatically add it to the manifest. Also do not warn about
    unmanifested files inside META-INF/ since a few vendors (Apple)
    require non standard files in that location.
  * Fix Book details popup window not being updated when editing metadata
    in the main window
  * Edit book: Fix editor not marking the book as modified when doing a
    Replace All that does not affect any currently open files.
  * Windows: Use a separate worker process to move files to the recycle
    bin. Fixes the problem of the recycle bin icon not being updated when
    deleting books into an empty recycle bin. Also avoids the overhead of
    launching a new, short-lived worker process for every delete.
  * calibredb: When deleting books/formats wait for deleted files to be
    moved to recycle bin, before quitting
  * RTF Output: Fix invalid RTF being produced when the text contains a
    double backslash.
  * Edit book: Fix option to disable showing the character before cursor
    not working
  * Get Books: Update various store plugins to account for changes to the
    store websites

    windows, calibre could leave behind the old format file, because the
    filename shortening algorithm has changed. Handle that case.

    after using the virtual libraries.

    multiple titles, remove the extra titles.

    metadata edit dialog to be much slower than before

    use the series field for it.
  o Get Books: Update the Amazon and Foyles store plugins

  o Chrome that causes it to not work with book lists containing some

  o Template editor: Use dummy metadata instead of blank/unknown values

    find a font on the system that is capable of rendering the characters
  o Fix regression that broke certain types of CSS selectors.
  o Use font-weight:bold instead of font-weight:bolder for the  and  tags
    as ADE cant handle bolder when embedded fonts are used

    o Email delivery: You can now specify a subject that calibre will use
      when sending emails per email account, configured in
      Preferences->Sending by email. The subject is a template of the same
      kind used in Save to Disk, etc. So you can specift the
      title/authors/series/whatever in the template.
    o Apple driver: When an iDevice is detected, inform the user about the
      Connect to iTunes method instead of trying to connect directly to the
      device, as the latter can be buggy. See
      http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127883 for details
    o SONY driver: Search for books on the device in all directories not
      just database/media/books. This can be turned off by customizing the

    o Plugin developers: calibre now has a new plugin API, see
      http://calibre-ebook.com/user_manual/creating_plugins.html Your
      existing plugins should continue to work, but it would be good to test
      them to make sure.

    o E-book viewer: Fix viewer losing place in very long single file

- Another spec file fix (requirement should have been libicu rather
  than icu)
- Now all requirements noted on the calibre home page should be
  matched. As a consequence, calibre will only install on
  openSUSEFactory, since it requires libicu >= 4.4.0. That

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 14 22:15:01 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- reformatted complete calibre.changes file:
  openSUSE:Factory requires a linewidth < 70
  (refer to the dashed lines for linewidth) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 13 09:35:04 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- removed Require: python-django-tagging since it is no longer
  needed (searched the calibre sources for "tagging" and "django")

- added packages that are only required, to BuildRequires, too,
  because 

  Requires should always be a subset of BuildRequires. If there
  are packages that are only Required 
  * there is no way to check whether these packages are available
    in the given repositories unless you install the package (the
    build environment only contains packages from the given
    repositories and the project 
  * the project's repository might become inconsistent, because
    Required packages do not block a build. So a package might get
    published, although a Required package does not build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 12 16:01:20 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- another Requires fix

    needed
  * python packages now all link to devel:languages:python

     to select a random book from your calibre library 
   o SONY driver: Add a couple of special extra collections

     read arbitrary png/gif/js/css/html files
   o On X11 initialize fontconfig in the GUI thread as Qt
     also uses fontconfig internally and fontconfig is not
     thread safe. Fixes a few random crashes on calibre
     strartup
   o When using the remove specific format actions, only show
     available formats in the selected books

     box.

     width and height specified.
   o Conversion pipeline: Fix bug that caused height/width
     specified in %/em of screen size to be incorrectly calculated
     by a factor of 72./DPI

     specified for the image

Sat Mar 13 21:32:13 UTC 2010 - toms@suse.de

- Update 0.6.45 (11 Mar, 2010)
  New Features
    * Option for more aggressive duplicates detection when adding
      books
       Closes tickets: 5016
      "There is now an option in Preferences->Add/Save that will
       cause calibre to try to detect duplicates based on title
       and author similarity. If a duplicate is found, calibre
       will automatically merge files intot he existing entry,
       instead of creating a new one."
    * Support for setting metadata in Topaz files and getting pdf
      anntations from a Kindle
    * ODT Input: Fix handling of mixed ordered and un-ordered
      lists
    * Support for the Samsung Moment
      Closes tickets: 5077

  Bug Fixes
    * Fix generated list of formats when generating catalog in CSV
      format
      Closes tickets: 5092
    * CHM metadata: Fix unicode handling
      Closes tickets: 5080
    * Iriver story driver: Put uploads into the Books directory
    * Improved iRex DR800 support
      Closes tickets: 5082
    * When creating ZIP/EPUB files encode all file names in UTF-8
      and set the UTF-8 bit marker. When extracting from a
      ZIP/EPUB file, if the UTF-8 bit marker is not set, still
      assume that the file name is encoded in UTF-8. If UTF-8
      decoding fails try to detect character encoding using
      chardet. This is because  most ZIP/EPUB files calibre comes
      across seem to be utf-8  encoded.
