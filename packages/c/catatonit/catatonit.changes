- Fix build to correctly build a static binary (which will allow it to work in
  all containers). This was caused by forgetting to include
  'glibc-devel-static'. I've added a check to ensure it doesn't happen by
  accident again.
- Add catatonit-rpmlintrc to include filters for "static binary" warnings,
  since this is intentional.
