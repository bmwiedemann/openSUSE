Sat Dec 14 09:18:44 UTC 2024 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to catatonit v0.2.1. See the upstream changelog at
  <https://github.com/openSUSE/catatonit/releases/tag/v0.2.1>
  * catatonit will now chdir to / in order to avoid keeping the directory
    it was running in busy. This was causing issues with rootless Podman's
    pause container keeping some /home/... paths busy and blocking umounts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Apr 11 09:57:33 UTC 2022 - Richard Brown <rbrown@suse.com>

- Update to catatont v0.1.7
- This release adds the ability for catatonit to be used as the only
process in a pause container, by passing the -P flag (in this mode no
subprocess is spawned and thus no signal forwarding is done).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 25 14:28:41 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add 99bb9048f.patch: configure.ac: call AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE only
  once. Fix build with autocnf 2.71 / automake 1.16.5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 05:16:12 UTC 2021 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to catatonit v0.1.6, which fixes a few bugs -- mainly ones related to
  socket activation or features somewhat adjacent to socket activation (such as
  passing file descriptors).
- Update catatonit-rpmlintrc in order to cover that static binaries are now an
  error not a warning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  2 16:20:29 UTC 2020 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to catatonit v0.1.5, which fixes two bugs where catatonit would hang
  endlessly when pid1 died in very specific ways. bsc#1176155

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 29 07:35:13 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to catatonit v0.1.4, which includes support for "-g".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 18 13:06:13 UTC 2018 - asarai@suse.com

- Update to catatonit v0.1.3, which includes a fix for docker compatiblity so
  that dockerd doesn't give spurrious warnings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  6 18:31:08 UTC 2018 - asarai@suse.com

- Fix build to correctly build a static binary (which will allow it to work in
  all containers). This was caused by forgetting to include
  'glibc-devel-static'. I've added a check to ensure it doesn't happen by
  accident again.
- Add catatonit-rpmlintrc to include filters for "static binary" warnings,
  since this is intentional.
