- Update to version 1.1:
  * Added functions split_gluon, default_parton_numbers,
    rename_partons in Col_functions. These functions are used for
    g -> qqbar splitting.
  * Removed Matchbox interface to Herwig, since ColorFull along
    with the interface, is shipped with Herwig from version 7.0.
  * Included various minor updates from Herwig version.
- Changes from version 1.0:
  * Fixed Monomial.h to build using --std=c++11 and --std=c++14.
  * Fixed all warnings appearing with -Wextra for g++ and clang
    using --std=c++11 and c++14. This required removing some
    arguments in private functions.
- Move shared libs to standard libdir from libdir/name; this
  makes the package compliant with openSUSE shared lib packaging
  policy, and no longer requires the installation of a conf file.
- Drop patches incorporated or otherwise fixed upstream:
  * ColorFull-monomial-conjugate-assignment.patch
  * ColorFull-monomial-illegal-or-usage.patch
