  <title>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</title>
  <description>Crawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of games like Rogue, Hack, and
Moria. Your objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave complex and
retrieve the Orb of Zot, which is guarded by many horrible and hideous
creatures.

This is the Stone Soup version of Dungeon Crawl and contains both the terminal and the tiles version (based on SDL).</description>
