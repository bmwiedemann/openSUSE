-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 20 05:02:09 UTC 2014 - devel.openSUSE.org@gmail.com

- Added crawl_24_gbdbe590.patch:
- Update to git master 0.14.1-24-gbdbe590:
 * Make drakes breathe, not throw (hangedman, Grunt)
   This was broken when the dragon genus was split.  I didn't restore
   the "roars" message, though.
   Also incorporates "Restrict drake breathe message to targeted spells."
 * Don't crash on t-r at the map edge (bh)
 * Fix an #ifdef (MarvinPA).
 * Include tileweb-text.cc in MSVC builds.
 * Add hash.cc to, remove obsolete files from, MSVC project.
 * Allow using Luajit on 64-bit systems (#8641)
   64-bit luajit doesn't support lua_newstate or custom allocators, so don't
   try to use one there.  However, give a warning if this happens with a
   webtiles or dgamelaunch build, because servers probably do want the
   memory throttling.
 * Don't crash on time step while siren-mesmerised (#8546)
 * Use the correct skill in variable-range rod spells (#8307)
   For the purposes of the hostile-in-range check and darken_beyond_range,
   we were computing power using the spell schools rather than Evocations.
 * More carefully chase item links in the pickup menu (#8603)
   Moving the item to the player destroyed it; normally that would have set
   the non-item's link to NON_ITEM, exiting the loop, but level excursions as
   part of pickup could overwrite the link.
 * Allow more than just the fallback hell entry in old late D.
 * Generate abyss/hell entries in old games with D:27.
   This includes generating hell entries on every level as we currently do in
   Depths.
 * Fix a bad array subscript (#8594)
   This has incorrectly been 9 rather than 0 since the function was added
   in 0.13-a0-927-g55b8bbf.
 * Replace a few uses of a <= b <= c (#8594)
   One of them was incorrect, and the other correct but confusing.
 * Fix a potential teleport closet (#8604)
 * Fix some Asterion speech. (MarvinPA, #8602)
 * Distinguish artefact from non- when swapping rings (#8062)
   If the left ring was a artefact and the right ring a non-artefact of the
   same base time, we failed to ask which to swap out.
 * Time-out unintentional Vp bat form normally (#8392)
 * Remove mention of ! from tutorial/hints skills screen (#5346).
   According to b702f4e, this menu is supposed to be disabled because it
   explains advanced commands which aren't available in the simple menu,
 * Allow toggling skill practicing in tutorial/hints mode again.
   Broken by ecaf8b2.
   It's a sad state of affairs that nobody thought this was a bug for
   almost three years.
 * Mention some 0.13 changes in the changelog (#7000).
 * Don't allow wielding an item that's too large while transformed.
 * Relevant for tree-form.
 * tilepick-p.cc: fix SP_NAGA switch fallthrough
 * Don't crash when mousing over remembered-but-gone webs (#8429)
 * Remove some residual item race references (#8480).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
