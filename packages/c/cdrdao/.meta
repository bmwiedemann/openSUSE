  <title>Write CD-Rs in Disk-At-Once Mode</title>
  <description>CDRDAO creates CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode driven by a description
file called a toc file. In DAO mode, it is possible to create
nonstandard track pregaps that have lengths other than 2 seconds and
contain nonzero audio data. This is useful for dividing live recordings
into tracks where 2 second gaps would be irritating.</description>
