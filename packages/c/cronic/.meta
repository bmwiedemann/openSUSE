  <title>A cure for Cron's chronic email problem</title>
  <description>Cronic is a small shim shell script for wrapping cron jobs so that cron only
sends email when an error has occurred. Cronic defines an error as any non-
trace error output or a non-zero result code. Cronic filters Bash execution
traces (or anything matching PS4) from the error output, so jobs can be run
with execution tracing to aid forensic debugging. Cronic has no options, it
simply executes its arguments.</description>
