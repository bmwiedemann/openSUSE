- Update to version 2.2.0:
  * Upgrade from v2.1
    It is strongly advised to upgrade to v2.2 from the previous
    minor version, which is v2.1. Upon upgrade for each minor
    release, Crossplane performs any necessary migrations of its
    CRDs to ensure the latest versions are stored in the Kubernetes
    API server. Therefore, it is important to upgrade sequentially
    through one minor version at a time as described in the upgrade
    docs.
  * Notable and Breaking Changes
    - Input CRDs included in Function packages are no longer
      installed by the package manager, following the xpkg
      specification. Unknown or disallowed resources in a package
      are now ignored instead of causing package installation to
      fail. See #6976.
    - The on-disk structure of the package cache has changed. This
      breaks an undocumented behavior via which packages could be
      side-loaded into Crossplane, which was especially useful for
      testing. See #6981 for details on the change and #7147 for
      discussion of the test changes necessary to accommodate it.
  * Highlights
    - ImageConfig can now be used to configure the
      DeploymentRuntimeConfig used for packages, including those
      installed as dependencies. Note that a matching ImageConfig
      takes precedence over the runtimeConfigRef in a package spec
      if both are present. See #6382.
    - The MRD controller now uses server-side apply to update CRDs,
      improving reliability. See #6934.
    - The pipeline inspector is now available as an alpha feature
      (disabled by default). When enabled, the inspector forwards
      function requests and responses to a user-configured gRPC
      endpoint for debugging or observability. See #7025 and #7031.
    - XRDs can now configure x-kubernetes-validations outside of
      the spec. This allows for validation of metadata such as
      names and labels. See #7018.
    - Composition and operation functions can now request OpenAPI
      schemas for any resource kind in the cluster using the
      RequiredSchemas field in the function response. Crossplane
      now advertises capabilities (including required schemas) to
      functions in a new function request field. See #7022.
    - The crossplane beta trace CLI command now supports tracing
      all resources of a given kind, and supports watching
      resources. See #6552 and #7015.
    - New documentation has been added regarding connection details
      for composite resources and workload identity with
      Crossplane.

  Warnings and breaking changes
  * Backwards Compatibility with v1
    The Crossplane maintainers have taken thoughtful consideration
    to make major improvements and changes in v2 while maintaining
    backwards compatibility for the vast majority of v1 workloads.
    We expect most users to be able to upgrade to v2 without any
    changes to their control plane. However, there is a set of 4
    breaking changes that we have made, mostly to long deprecated
    features and features that have remained stuck in alpha for a
    long time.
    If you are not using any of these 4 features, you can upgrade
    to v2 without any issues and your existing workload should
    continue operating as usual.
    The following features have been removed:
    - Native patch and transform within composition (mode:
      Resources)
      You can migrate your compositions to use function pipelines
      with the crossplane beta convert pipeline-composition command
      available in the v1 crossplane CLI. See the Crossplane docs
      for details.
    - ControllerConfig
      These have been replaced by DeploymentRuntimeConfig. You can
      migrate your existing ControllerConfig to
      DeploymentRuntimeConfig with the crossplane beta convert
      deployment-runtime command available in the v1 crossplane
      CLI. See the Crossplane docs for details.
  * login/logout removed from Crossplane CLI
    The crossplane xpkg login and crossplane xpkg logout commands
    have been removed from the Crossplane CLI. To login to a
    registry before pushing a package, consider using docker login
    locally, or the docker/login-action from CI.
    An example of this pattern can be seen in many Community
    Extension Projects, for example function-auto-ready.
  * CLI-related commits
    - Add #sig-cli to README
    - Support Rendering Default Values from XRD in Crossplane CLI
