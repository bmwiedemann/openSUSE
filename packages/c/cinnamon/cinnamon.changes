-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 24 20:58:01 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.6.6:
  * Sound settings: Assign the selected device to the profile
    selector.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 21 07:11:21 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.6.5 (changes since 3.6.3):
  * calendar applet: Just listen to the gsetting key for 24h to
    make sure the vertical panel default clock obeys global
    date/time settings.
  * st-theme.c: st_theme_resolve_url could assert with a theme
    issue.
  * cinnamon-settings: Use icon buttons in the xlet management
    pages.
  * Fixes crash if device.get_icon_name() is Null.
  * Allow showing seconds on a vertical panel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 18 00:00:12 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.6.3:
  * Show-desktop: Disable peek-at-desktop by default.
  * menu applet: Recalculate applications list box height when the
    menu's allocation changes.
  * Applets: When setting an icon, make sure it's actually an
    St.Icon. Some applets (such as the keyboard applet) set
    _applet_icon to something other than an St.Icon, so it causes
    an error when trying to set the icon using one of the api
    functions. This was causing the keyboard applet not to show in
    the panel edit mode after a keyboard layout was added and
    removed.
  * applet settings: Fix panel switch buttons not being hidden when
    there is only one panel.
  * Add Adwaita-dark thumbnails.
  * extension settings: Scan the system directory for extensions.
  * Initialise applet position to avoid drag and drop errors in
    edit mode occasionally the null applet position was being
    carried through to the writing of the new applet causing 
    apparent drop failures, and to the disappearance of the
    highlighted drop box. Much visible weirdness with a very simple
    solution.
  * workspace switcher: Fix an undeclared variable warning.
  * applet settings: Improve the logic for highlighting the panel.
    The panel is now only highlighted when there is more than one
    panel, and it's better about selecting and highlighting the
    correct panel when one is added or removed.
  * Fixed spacing. Add a missing semicolon.
  * popupMenu: Prevent a warning of this._triangle.
  * Clock applet: Respect a 12h/24h choice in the vertical mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 12 21:00:18 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.6.2:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 20 16:09:40 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.6 (changes since 3.4.4):
  * osdWindow.js: Always check the theme node on first showing - an
    actor's width isn't necessarily filled if it hasn't been
    explicitly set, causing the first few activations of the OSD to not show an accurate level bar.
  * cs_default: Fix an incorrect button label (but preserve
    translations).
  * main.js: Remove an obsolete Meta enum member reference.
  * workspace.js: Use our normal prototype init method.
  * workspace.js: Initalise WindowClone._zoomStep to 0.
  * slideshow-applet: Fix a translation.
  * cs_themes.py: Create the file "~/.icons/default/index.theme" and
    set the selected cursor theme inside of it. This ensures other
    (non-gtk) applications end up using the same theme (though they
    are required to be restarted for these changes to take effect).
  * keyboard-applet: Applet icon vanishes when moved in edit mode.
  * cinnamon-json-makepot: Add keyword option, change language used
    by xgettext to JavaScript.
  * expoThumbnail: Correct a couple of calls with mismatched
    argument counts.
  * window-list: Set AppMenuButtons unreactive during panel edit
    mode.
  * panel-launchers: Set PanelAppLaunchers unreactive during panel
    edit mode.
  * windows-quick-list: Fix argument warning.
  * Fix a reference to undefined actor._delegate warning.
  * ui/environment: Handle undefined actors in
    containerClass.prototype.add.
  * ui/cinnamonDBus: Handle null xlet objects in
    CinnamonDBus.highlightXlet.
  * deskletManager: Initialise some variables and remove the
    variables that were initialised, probable typo

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * classicSwitcher.js: Fix hidpi issues.
  * KeybindingWidgets.py: Fix parsing of accelerators that are
    shifted but not alpha-numeric characters.

    provided.
  * window-list applet: Fix argument warning.
  * Add an issue template.
  * ui/settings: Handle undefined old settings values.
  * hotCorner.js: Fix hover delay callback.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 28 19:20:44 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.3:
  * panel-launchers: Put individual launcher actions back in the
    main popup, having an options and preferences submenu was a
    bit ambiguous.
  * panel-launchers: Remove an undeclared variable warning.
  * deskletManager: Correct a call to file.delete.
  * Add a menu item to toggle the on-screen keyboard.
- Use update-alternatives to create the default.desktop xsession.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 16:11:48 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.2:
  * st-texture-cache.c: Do not cache st_texture_cache_load_from_raw.
    Its only user is the Notification Daemon. These are transient
    images that were being stored in the cache that would never be
    evicted during theme changes (this does not just mean times
    when the user changed the icon theme).
  * l10n: Translate hardcoded string for settings reset
    confirmation dialogue.
  * Silence a few more warnings, new warnings.
  * expo, overview: Unreference actors that we destroy whenever the
    respective view closes.
  * cinnamon-slideshow.py: Only allow a single instance to run.
  * Sound applet: Avoid spacing problem in vertical panel.
  * photoframe-desklet: Fix a few issues.
  * notificationDaemon.js: Silence an occasional warning.
  * SettingsWidgets.py: Make switch widgets use "center" vertical
    alignment instead of "fill," to prevent the switch growing in
    height when the label text gets ellipsised (either through
    resizing of the window, or localisation).
  * Progress bar text initialises and resets.
  * cinnamon-settings-users: Restrict the size of user images, as
    they are displayed in the right view when a user is selected.
    If the image at /var/lib/AccountsService/icons/<user> is set to
    a ridiculously-sized image, it won't break the ui.
  * cs_user: Don't let large images break the ui - make sure we
    scale the selected image to an appropriate size.
    Also, don't crop user-selected images (but keep cropping webcam
    images) - it's strange to select an image file and have the
    ends of it cut off.
  * cinnamon-settings-users.py: Fix picture preview in file
    selector to maintain a reasonable size.
  * cs_user.py: Handle image previews better in the face chooser
    dialogue.
  * ChooserButtonWidgets.py: Fix a Python 3 error.
  * window-list: Bring space around preview down and correct a
    calculation problem.
  * StScrollView: Queue redraws whenever the adjustments change, to
    prevent artifacts outside of the view itself.
  * StScrollView: More effective way of fixing the graphical 
    artefacts generated during scrolling. This also appears to fix
    some unrelated tearing issues I was seeing in the menu while
    testing.
  * main.c: Own onboard's dbus name to prevent it starting when
    gnome's a11y keyboard settings key is active
    (org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-keyboard-enabled).
    Also own caribou's daemon. Caribou's OSK won't interfere in a
    Cinnamon session, but its daemon will run needlessly in the
    background otherwise.
  * panel: Avoid cjs giving a warning that dummyPanels[i][j] is
    undefined.
  * systray applet: Make sure an icon actually got parented to
    this.manager_container before calling remove_child.
    This issue can occur during session startup.
  * spacer applet: Use a unique style class in the theme to prevent
    the applet from appearing active when hovered.
  * theme: Add applet-spacer class for spacer applet.
  * spacer applet: Use track_hover instead of a new style to
    prevent highlighting.
  * osdWindow: get the correct child allocation when calculating
    the width of the level bar. If a padding or margin is added to
    the level-bar style class, it was causing the parent bin to
    expand to accomodate the child's width plus its required
    padding.
- Rebase cinnamon-wheel-and-sbin-path.patch,
  cinnamon-no-gksu-requirement.patch,
  cinnamon-favourite-applications.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 24 14:40:01 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.1:
  * Remove usage of GTK_POLICY_EXTERNAL.
  * checkBox.js: Remove extra unused argument which was causing a
    warning with new cjs/mozjs.
  * st-bin.c: Fix y_fill setter (it was setting x_fill to the value
    of the existing y_fill, before it is set in the same call).
  * menu applet: Fix keyboard navigation of recent context menu.
    Fix closing of same menu when switching to another category.
    Also fix closing when opening another recent's context menu.
  * menu applet: Notify when a recent file is activated that can't
    be accessed.
  * menu applet: Make missing file notification transient.
  * menu applet (vector box): Partially revert c0d37dd: there is
    flickering as events go from a button to the vector box and
    back. Remove the idle callback, and directly react to the enter
    even once more. To compensate, increase our
    maybeUpdateVectorBox delay timeout, which more or less fixes
    the original problem the above commit was attempting to fix.
  * menu applet: _select_category - only call displayButtons if the
    category has really changed.
  * menu applet: Fix keyboard navigation when a second recent
    context menu is toggled open.
  * Sound settings: Fix device icons.
  * xlet-settings.py: Ignore files and directories in the config
    directory that aren't created by our settings api as well as
    instances that no longer exist.
  * ExtensionCore.py: Don't scrub the config directory on load.
    This is no longer necessary since xlet settings now ignores
    anything that isn't an active instance, and some applets need a
    place to store extra files so they get cleaned up on uninstall.
  * cs_panel.py: Fix a crash when there are no panels.
  * sound-applet: Remove extraneous arguments on add_actor calls.
  * radioButton.js: Remove an extra argument to add_actor.
  * window-list-applet: Fix undefined reference warning.
  * cinnamon-json-makepot: Add support to extract "title" and
    "units" keys on list elements.
  * User applet: Remove the ability to switch to guest with LightDM.
  * runDialog.js: Fix undefined variable warning.
  * Reorganise the default applets in the panel.
  * User applet: Remove trailing spaces.
  * Applets: Make TextIconApplet smarter and adapt to vertical
    panels.
  * menu applet: Use _select_category to select recents and places,
    so we can cache the current selection more accurately and
    prevent needless calls to _displayButtons.
  * window list: Add a missing dependency to settings.
- Remove cinnamon-fix-gtk-3.14.patch.
- Rebase cinnamon-no-gksu-requirement.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  7 11:23:03 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.0:
  * Fix gnome terminal losing desktop file association during
    Cinnamon restart.
  * cinnamon-json-makepot: Add support to scan for JS files inside
    sub-dirs.
  * Start systray applet first
  * Use generic marshaller.
  * Pull functions out of loops in _refreshPlaces, _refreshApps...
  * Move uri assignment in _refreshRecent's while loop into new...
  * Use let instead of var in new handler functions.
  * panel: Rework allocation logic to avoid looping in edit mode
    this was causing the context menu animation to fail to complete
    causing the user not to be able to exit edit mode.
  * theme-node: Fix leak on stylesheet change.
  * cinnamon_dbus_acquire_name: Don't leak the result.
  * cinnamon_dbus_acquire_name: Don't leak error.
  * keyboard: Destroy the key's boxpointe.
  * Fix hotcorner hover delay timeout removal. This fixes a
    "Invalid or null source id used when attempting to run
    Mainloop.source_remove()" when leaving a hotcorner. The timeout
    is already destroyed by returning false in the callback, but we
    still knew about the timeout id and tried to remove the
    non-existing timeout.
  * st-box-layout: Don't report a paint volume when we have no
    allocation.
  * window-tracker: Fix a memory leak.
  * tooltips.js: Remove leftover logging.
  * Add cinnamon-stap-monitor utility.
  * panel.js: Couple fixes to previous commit. Let the panel
    sections cover the entire panel in edit mode. Clean up
    _allocate a bit - since we always have the centre zone occupied
    (artificially or naturally,) we don't ever need to handle cases
    where it isn't.
  * panel.js: Fix dnd pseudo-class style application for vertical
    panels.
  * panel: Allow right and left panel zones to naturally fill space.
    Fix vertical allocate calculations in st-box-layout (align_end
    was only working for horizontal box layouts).
  * panel.js: Clean actor and style class names up, simplify some
    code that no longer needs to differentiate between vertical and
    horizontal panels.
  * cs_screensaver.py: Expose setting for floating widgets.
  * panel.js: Restore the "important" style flag, accidentally
    removed from panel zones.
  * expoThumbnail.js: Don't reposition thumbnails on
    position-changed.
  * cs_screensaver.py: Use a stack to switch between default
    screensaver and plugin previews.
  * panel.js: Restore some allocation code mistakenly removed in a
    previous commit. This restores the behavior of allowing
    left/right panels to occupy more than half the panel if the
    centre zone is empty.
  * Sound applet: Fix a segmentation fault that happened when menu
    animations were disabled (gh#linuxmint/Cinnamon#5977).
  * cinnamon-desktop-editor: Use the default icon when file is
    nonexistent.

  * windowManager: Move handling of workspace switch effects to one
    place.
  * window-list: Don't lose our focus style class when opening the
    context menu.
  * Settings widgets range: Add an optional argument to show the
    current value of on the scale widget. This was originally the
    way it worked in the xlet settings, but with the rework, that
    functionality wasn't reimplemented. This rendered the settings
    of several applets less usefull.
  * Show desktop applet: Fix preview being stuck by
    keyboard-triggered menu open.
  * settings.js: Rebuild the settings file if it becomes corrupted.
    If the settings have already been loaded, we use the latest
    version we have, otherwise we restore from defaults.

    system.
  * cs_startup.py: Add a "Run now" button for when a row is selected.
  * Make sure applets that don't support vertical panels don't get
    dropped on a vertical panel. This was happening with at least
    some applets, causing them to "disappear", and could only be
    recovered by removing them from applet settings and re-adding
    them again.
  * cinnamon-settings: Fix some sliders being drawn backwards.
  * settings.js: Handle corrupt settings the right way. Fixes
    several issues with the previous implementation.
  * xlet settings: Add a list widget.
  * xlet settings: Fix the reference to new option added to wrong
    element.
  * Settings: Add support for lightdm-settings.

    inspecting.

    (gh#linuxmint/Cinnamon#6374).
  * Add Manjaro Support in System Info (gh#linuxmint/Cinnamon#6387).

  * st-theme-node: Remove a double declaration that gives a
    compiler warning.
  * Start inode/directory application instead unregistered
    x-scheme-handler/file in case of unmounted bookmarks.
  * st-entry: Change the variable type to avoid a compiler warning.
  * Add a chooser for "inode/directory" to be able to choose the
    default file manager.
  * xlet-settings: Add a missing string for l10n.
  * st-box-layout: Remove an unused variable.
  * panel.js: Refactor Panel._showPanel and Panel._hidePanel.
  * panel.js: Don't clip the panel box shadow when showing after
    hide.
  * cs_accessibility: Restore previous theme when disabling
    High Contrast.
  * Remove panelMenu.js, which is unused but for 2 applets.
    There are a bunch of applets that import it but don't use it,
    all of which can be fixed now.
  * hotcorners: Remove the icon option.
  * cinnamon-looking-glass.py: Handle the numpad entering in entry.
  * Remove aclocal from autogen.sh as autoreconf runs it.
  * Fix for non translated applet names on Remove context menu items.
  * [Xlets] Expose config deletion request to xlet.
  * modalDialog: Avoid a js warning.

  * Update keybindings.js.
  * Adapt Cinnamon to multi-process CSD.
  * messageTray: Show critical notifications in fullscreen.
  * cs_panel.py: Replace panel widgets with backended ones.
    This will hopefully ensure that the widgets are consistent with
    the rest of Cinnamon in terms of behaviour and appearance, as
    well as easier to maintain.
  * panel.js: Keep track of panelPosition and monitor changes.
  * panel.js: Refactor _moveResizePanel.
  * layout.js: Don't include clipped off areas in input region.
  * README file to reStructuredText file.
  * St: Margin: Remove margin:auto from menu applet and default
    theme. This avoids warning messages as margin:auto is not
    supported. And it also means third party theme developers will
    not copy non-functional CSS. The warning messages for the
    programmatic insertion of margin:auto in the menu applet were
    particularly cryptic.
  * st: Fix a couple icon/text-shadow bugs.
  * cinnamon-json-makepot: Fix for undefined global name.
  * Update cs_power.py.
  * Use St.Icon instead of fetching icons from St.TextureCache.

    (gh#linuxmint/Cinnamon#6486).
  * menu-applet & panel-launchers: Add new mouse cursors while.
    dragging applications (gh#linuxmint/Cinnamon#5859)

- Update to version 3.2.8:
  * menu applet: Only construct one context menu for recent files,
    and re-use it.
  * menu applet: Don't reconstruct recent files, just re-order,
    add, remove as required.
  * menu applet: Fix a couple of minor leaks (actors created but
    never added to a container - being GInitiallyUnowned, they
    never get their floating ref sunk, and so can't be unreffed.
    Fix a prototype mismatch, and just rename GenericButton to
    NoRecentDocsButton, since that's the only user of it.
  * Fix tuples for Python 3.6.
  * tooltips.js: Add a hide timer to check if a tooltip should hide
    itself, but for various reasons never got to act on a
    leave-event (due to vagaries in event reporting).
  * recent applet: Rework to be non-destructive when updating the
    recent list (this brings a lot of the recent changes to the
    menu applet over to this one).
  * recents, applets: Couple of warning clean ups.
  * network applet: Remove a useless log warning. At some point
    more than a year ago we started getting these (possibly a
    change to NetworkManager), they have no value whatsoever, but
    fill up the log.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 15 13:02:12 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.7:
  * Fix power settings segfault.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 23 18:43:19 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.6:
  * Add a generic "bluetooth" icon.
  * power applet: Don't connect to any signals that call
    _devicesChanged until we have the power proxy (since the
    callbacks assume we do have it).
  * windowAttentionHandler.js: Make the ignored application check
    case- insensitive. While we're here make it a gsettings array
    for convenience.
  * org.cinnamon.gschema.in: Add pidgin to ignored wm classes.
  * Touchpad settings: Invert motion-threshold setting widget.
  * appletManager.js: Fix copy/pasting applet panel applet layouts.
    Extension.get_max_instances() needed an extra argument, and
    then we were doing work twice - finished removing obsolete code.
  * cinnamon-recorder: Fix crash when starting recorder.
  * cinnamon-recorder.c: Restore avoidance of the panel when
    drawing the recording indicators. This was removed during some
    panel work a while back and never restored. Always draw them on
    the primary monitor now (the only monitor with reliable,
    simple-to-get workarea information).
  * Fix spelling mistakes.
  * onscreen keyboard: Add option to change activation behaviour -
    accessible mode has the keyboard appear whenever focus demands
    it (ordinary accessibility behavior). On-demand mode will have
    the keyboard only appear when the user requests it via an
    applet click or keyboard shortcut.
  * Themes settings: Fix loading icon themes when a theme isn't
    readable.
  * popupMenu.js: Use the signalManager.disconnect correctly -
    the source actor (the panel actor for the applet) has to be the
    second argument, the object to disconnect from. Was causing
    flickering in the menu applet after repositioning it.
  * Settings: Don't hardcode "more info" link colour in spices
    modules.
  * [desrt] network: Properly remove connections from list.
  * Network applet: Fix icon not showing VPN status.
  * Network applet: Delete trailing spaces.
  * Network applet: Fix applet showing "Auto" wireless connection
    when turning wifi OFF and then back ON.
  * tray icons: Bump icon request to 24px, then scale back to 20px
    in the applet. This is needed due to changes to GtkIconSize
    values in Gtk3. GtkStatusIcon iterates thru the built-in icon
    sizes to pick an appropriate icon to use, and as of 3.18 there
    are no sizes between 16px and 24px.
  * Preferred application settings: Set mimetypes more exhaustively.
- Rebase cinnamon-network-user-connections.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  1 12:43:15 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

  * cinnamon-settings: Remove hard-coded theming for the main
    cinnamon-settings icon view.

    custom icon if one is set in metadata (via file manager).

- Update to version 3.0.4:

    gtk3 >= 3.16.

    coverart.
  * sound-applet: Fix an icon name.
  * Ignore accents/stokes when searching the menu or
    cinnamon-settings.
  * Menu applet: Remove trailing spaces.
  * Menu applet: Don't refresh twice at the same time.

    box, if an application was dragged over, but not dropped on the
    favourites box.

  cinnamon-no-gksu-requirement.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 22 15:13:43 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.3:
  * Ensure label text is properly escaped before applying it with
    set_markup().
  * SettingsWidgets.py: Use a more compatible GFileMonitorFlags –
    WATCH_MOVES is not available in glib 2.40.
  * cinnamon-settings: Include module keywords in desktop files.
  * cinnamon-app: Provide access to desktop file keywords.
    Use them in the menu applet search.
  * generated desktop files: Re-run, to remove unnecessary comment.
  * extensions: Check extensions for unsafe calls (synchronous,
    etc., things that can potentially freeze Cinnamon) and make the
    user aware of them in Cinnamon Settings.
  * ExtensionCore.py: scan_extension_thread – if the metadata.json
    file is not found, this must be a versioned xlet, check the
    parent directory for it instead.
  * cs_power.py: Expose setting to allow lid-closed action even
    when external monitors are attached.
  * messageTray.js: Don't let notifications with buttons fade on
    mouse-over.
  * menu applet: Use application id instead of application name for
    searches prevents duplicate search results for applications
    with the same desktop entry name when searching with a more
    specific term.
  * sound applet: smplayer: Fix artist metadata display and disable
    seek. While seeking does work, after the first time you seek
    the amount seeked is incorrect. It appears to seek the amount
    between the beginning of the seek bar and where you released
    the click instead.
  * cs_themes: Add setting for dark theme variant preference.
    This is only settable from ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini, so
    add the ability to modify that as well.
  * cs_effects.py: Expose gtk-overlay-scrollbar setting.
  * cs_sound: Set selection mode to none on the SoundBox() object.
  * Settings: Don't include text/html in the source code mimetypes.
  * st-texture-cache.c: use g_themed_icon_new instead of
    g_themed_icon_new_with_default_fallbacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 12 09:54:43 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.2:
  * Cache generated thumbnails.
  * Fix desktop effects on dialogs and menus.
    This prevents desktop effects on dialogs and menus from being
    used if desktop-effects is turned off. It's like already like
    this in the effects settings dialog.
  * Power applet: Fixed declaration of alias variable.
  * Window list: Fix call on null object.
  * Fix handling of device icon where GIcon is null.
  * cinnamon-settings: Don't set the stack switcher to use the main
    settings stack on creation.
    This is causing visual glitches in a lot of Gtk themes when
    changing from the main icon view to a page that displays the
    stack switcher.
  * Fix highlighting not working correctly for multiple instances
    of an applet.
  * ExtensionCore.py: Don't break when an xlet provides a bad icon
    file.
  * Add null conditional to return empty array when get_devices
    returns null.
  * Correct a potential infinite loop.
  * accessibility settings: Don't use PackageKit for now when
    looking for assistance applications that are installed.
    Just look for their binaries, and notify if not installed.
    Watch the bin folders in case the user installs the dependency
    and doesn't restart cinnamon settings.
  * cs_sound.py: Add a close button to the speaker test dialog.
  * Fix image close crash.

  * Add new default application buttons.
  * Show panel-launchers actions.
  * Tab indents into space indents, more item without dots.
  * Move sound settings to python as a native module.
  * Add a custom page to display when no input devices are
    available or applications are currently playing. Add a custom
    settings box for the sound effects page to prevent getting a
    very tall window when opening the settings. Make a few tweaks
    to the test sound dialog and add the relevant icons.
  * Some visual tweaks to the sound settings.
  * Sound settings: Add mute to all volume controls.
  * cs_sound.py: Few fixes to the volume slider/mute button.
  * layout.js: Remove code for interaction with the screensaver.
  * cs_sound.py: Add padding to the end of stream names in
    applications page.
  * Viber stealing focus fix.
  * magnifier.js: Update the lens size as well as shape when we turn
    on lens mode.
  * Generate new desktop files for sound and accessibility.
  * Touchpad settings: Rename "natural scrolling" to
    "reverse scrolling direction".
  * Fix middle click action in the photo frame.
  * photoframe: Recurse subdirectories.
  * Sound settings: Fix device not showing when its icon isn't
    found (fixes bluetooth devices not showing up).
  * Power settings: Don't add the Gtk.Stack if it's empty.
  * Power settings/applet: Let the user rename battery powered
    devices.
  * Power settings: Fix power bars not being aligned.
  * tooltips.js: Hide if the stage's key focus changes - prevents
    tooltips from becoming stuck if you use the keyboard to switch
    focus (hit the menu key while a window list preview is showing).
  * cs_keyboard: Add a "wide" style class to the pane separator in
    the shortcuts page and remove some unneeded padding so this
    looks a little nicer in most newer themes.
  * effects: Enable effects on dialogs and menus by default.
  * Sound applet: Correctly identify changed artwork from Spotify
    (and add support for new URLs in version 0.27.x).
  * Theme settings: Don't filter themes missing gtk-3.0 if they
    provide gtk-3.*.
  * Show multi line descriptions in applet about.
  * Sound applet: Use wget to download remote artwork covers.

    match muffin changes.

  * Cinnamon Settings: Remove a couple of old debug output.
  * Cinnamon Settings: Retire cinnamon-bluetooth
    (replaced with Blueberry).

    increase performance, might cause regressions in cases where the
    St texture needs to be refreshed following a file change)".
  * panel-launcher: Fix an undeclared variable warning.
  * Fixed cinnamon slideshow error.
  * Adjust to Muffin API changes for handling fullscreen windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 30 21:43:12 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 2.8.8:
  * layout.js: Remove code for interaction with the screensaver.
    It was always broken until 2.8.7, where it was 'fixed', and has
    caused some reported regression where the panels will be hidden
    after returning from the screensaver.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  9 18:09:32 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.7:
  * cs_keyboard.py: Fix event handlers for teaching keybindings -
    the cursor-down and -up keys were being incorrectly used to
    navigate the tree view during teach mode, and it was breaking
    focus (and cancelling the teach).
  * magnifier: Limit max zoom to a reasonable value.
  * menu applet: Fix vfade in the program list - it was only showing
    when desktop zoom was turned entirely off.
    We've reworked zoom since then, so that the .applications key
    only determines whether we listen to key and mouse bindings or
    not - actual zoom activation occurs only when the magnification
    factor becomes > 1.0.
  * screensaver: Fix proxy to listen to the correct service, fix
    layout changes when the screensaver starts/stops.
  * layout.js: Get an actual boolean from the screensaver proxy.
  * signalManager.js: Pass argument array correctly, and don't wipe
    out this._storage when filtering out disconnected items.
  * cinnamonDBus: Rename Cinnamon to CinnamonDBus, and import
    Cinnamon so screenshot calls work.
  * window-list: Prevent the window list thumbnails from showing
    when the applets context menu is open.
  * window-list: Properly update the label in the window preview.
  * cs_backgrounds: For an update of some of the reveal children
    on initial page load to fix some settings not showing properly
  * Fix D-Bus methods for screen capture.
  * util.js: Do not modify error message.
- Rebase cinnamon-fix-backgrounds-lookup.patch,

  xscreensaver configs path (boo#960165).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 21 18:19:08 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Exclude typelib(Cinnamon), typelib(CinnamonJS), typelib(Gvc),
  and typelib(St) from dependencies and provides as these are in a
  custom directory: /usr/lib64/cinnamon/ (last two also conflict
  with GNOME Shell package).
- Merge typelib-1_0-Cinnamon-0_1 into cinnamon as it doesn't
  contain real GObject introspection (different directory).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 13 16:17:59 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Depend on cinnamon-control-center-common: required by parts of
  cinnamon-settings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 19:24:16 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.5:
  * workspace-switcher applet: Update relevant workspace graph when
    a window is added or removed from a workspace.
  * workspace-switcher applet: Do not ignore maximised windows in
    the graph.
  * Handle situations when /usr/lib64/ is a symlink to /usr/lib/
    and vice versa on some distributions causing modules being
    loaded multiple times.
  * Replace has_icon method with lookup_icon one to fix missing
    flags icons in keyboard applet.
  * signalManager.js: Fix typo.
  * effects: Currently when setting the minimise animation to
    "traditional" no sound effect is used when restoring the window.
    Change this so the minimise sound is played in this case.
  * Sound applet: Close menu when closing media player.
  * Fix menu applet's graphical oddity during search.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 21:01:32 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.4:
  * Fix a timer issue in TooltipBase and window list; in rare cases,
    two enter events occurred without a leave event in between,
    leaving an orphaned _showTimer behind.

    "Cinnamon" style so these get used on new installs.

    of appletObj is hit upon.

Mon Aug 10 13:12:00 UTC 2015 - i@marguerite.su

- don't need to fix rpath
  * we used chrpath/patchelf to remove runpath and add rpath,
    but patchelf has an unfixed serious bug that confuses strip,
    which will cause a "version glibc_2.2.5 not defined in file 
    libc.so.6 with link time reference" segfault.
    https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/issues/10
  * upstream borrowed this hacky patch from gnome-shell
    http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-commit/2012-05/msg00780.html
    that will link libcinnamon-js.so, so indeed no need of rpath fix
    anymore.

    RPATH can find /usr/lib(64)/cinnamon/libcinnamon-js.so
    have to explicitly set RPATH=/usr/lib(64)/cinnamon  
  * we use chrpath/patchelf to delete RUNPATH and force
    set RPATH. As RUNPATH will "hide" RPATH and OBS may
    have DT_RUNPATH for all builds, we can never set
    RPATH by patch (the RPATH in Makefiles will end up
    to be RUNPATH anyway)

- Add cinnamon-explicitly-link-againt-gl.patch: Cogl does not
  explicitly link against GL or GLES any more, and clutter master
  dropped the 'gl' pkg-config requirement because it introduced
  unneeded and conflicting dependencies. Cinnamon still uses
  glXQuery* API, so it needs to explicitly link against libGL.
  Upstream: https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/pull/301
- Removed dependency on gnome-shell -- though it's usefull, if a
  package requires cinnamon for build (ex: cinnamon-extensions),
  a lot of unwanted stuff is pulled.
