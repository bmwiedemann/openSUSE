- Update to version 0.6.0~0:
  * README and documentation improvements 
  * Read the rustc path passed by Cargo; fixes #90
  * Read location of Cargo from the environment variable Cargo sets for third-party subcommands
  * Add a note on sccache version compatibility to CHANGELOG.md
  * Panic on compilation commands where we fail to parse the arguments instead of silently ignoring the error
  * Specifying the binary-scanning feature is no longer needed
  * Pass options such as --offline to `cargo metadata`
  * Pass on arguments from `cargo auditable` invocation to the rustc wrapper; prep work towards fixing #83
  * Bump rust-audit-info to 0.5.2
  * Bump auditable-serde version to 0.5.2
  * Correctly fill in the source even in dependency entries when converting to cargo-lock data format
  * Drop the roundtrip through &str in semver::Version; now that semver 1.0 has shipped the versions are API-compatible and this is no longer necessary
  * Release auditable-info 0.6.1
  * Bump all the version requirements for things depending on auditable-info
  * Fix audit_info_from_slice function signature
