  <title>Userspace tools for interacting with the Connection Tracking System</title>
  <description>The conntrack-tools are a set of tools targeted at system
administrators. They are conntrack, the userspace command line
interface, and conntrackd, the userspace daemon. The tool conntrack
provides a full featured interface that has replaced the old procfs
interface. Using conntrack, you can view and manage the in-kernel
connection tracking state table from userspace. On the other hand,
conntrackd covers the specific aspects of stateful firewalls to
enable highly available scenarios, and can be used as statistics
collector as well.</description>
