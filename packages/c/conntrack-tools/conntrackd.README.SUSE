The conntrackd daemon comes with an example conntrackd.conf configuration
file in /etc/conntrackd/ - please adjust to your needs (the file will not 
get overwritten during package updates) to your needs.

If you want to start conntrackd with additional options (see 
`man 8 conntrackd`), please add them in /etc/sysconfig/conntrackd.
