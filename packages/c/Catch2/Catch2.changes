- Update to version 2.11.0
  Improvements:
  * JUnit reporter output now contains more details in case of
    failure (#1347, #1719)
  * Added SonarQube Test Data reporter (#1738)
    + It is in a separate header, just like the TAP, Automake,
      and TeamCity reporters
  * `range` generator now allows floating point numbers (#1776)
  * Reworked part of internals to increase throughput
  Fixes:
  * The single header version should contain full benchmarking
    support (#1800)
  * `[.foo]` is now properly parsed as `[.][foo]` when used on
    the command line (#1798)
  * Fixed compilation of benchmarking on platforms where
    `steady_clock::period` is not `std::nano` (#1794)
  version 2.10.2
  Improvements:
  * Catch2 will now compile on platform where `INFINITY` is
    double (#1782)
   Fixes:
  * Warning suppressed during listener registration will no
    longer leak
  version 2.10.1
  Improvements:
  * Catch2 now guards itself against `min` and `max` macros from
    `windows.h` (#1772)
  * Templated tests will now compile with ICC (#1748)
  * `WithinULP` matcher now uses scientific notation for
    stringification (#1760)
  Fixes:
  * Templated tests no longer trigger `-Wunused-templates`
    (#1762)
  * Suppressed clang-analyzer false positive in context getter
    (#1230, #1735)
  Miscellaneous:
  * CMake no longer prohibits in-tree build when Catch2 is used
    as a subproject (#1773, #1774)
  version 2.10.0
  Fixes:
  * `TEMPLATE_LIST_TEST_CASE` now properly handles non-copyable
    and non-movable types (#1729)
  * Fixed compilation error on Solaris caused by a system header
    defining macro `TT` (#1722, #1723)
  * `REGISTER_ENUM` will now fail at compilation time if the
    registered enum is too large
  * Removed use of `std::is_same_v` in C++17 mode (#1757)
  * Fixed parsing of escaped special characters when reading
    test specs from a file (#1767, #1769)
  Improvements:
  * Trailing and leading whitespace in test/section specs are
    now ignored.
  * Writing to Android debug log now uses `__android_log_write`
    instead of `__android_log_print`
  * Android logging support can now be turned on/off at compile
    time (#1743)
    + The toggle is `CATCH_CONFIG_ANDROID_LOGWRITE`
  * Added a generator that returns elements of a range
    + Use via `from_range(from, to)` or `from_range(container)`
  * Added support for CRTs that do not provide `std::nextafter`
    (#1739)
    + They must still provide global `nextafter{f,l,}`
    + Enabled via `CATCH_CONFIG_GLOBAL_NEXTAFTER`
  * Special cased `Approx(inf)` not to match non-infinite values
    + Very strictly speaking this might be a breaking change,
      but it should match user expectations better
  * The output of benchmarking through the Console reporter when
    `--benchmark-no-analysis` is set is now much simpler (#1768)
  * Added a matcher that can be used for checking an exceptions
    message (#1649, #1728)
    + The matcher helper function is called `Message`
    + The exception must publicly derive from `std::exception`
    + The matching is done exactly, including case and whitespace
  * Added a matcher that can be used for checking relative
    equality of floating point numbers (#1746)
    + Unlike `Approx`, it considers both sides when determining
      the allowed margin
    + Special cases `NaN` and `INFINITY` to match user
      expectations
    + The matcher helper function is called `WithinRel`
  * The ULP matcher now allows for any possible distance between
    the two numbers
  * The random number generators now use Catch-global instance
    of RNG (#1734, #1736)
    + This means that nested random number generators actually
      generate different numbers
  Miscellaneous:
  * In-repo PNGs have been optimized to lower overhead of using
    Catch2 via git clone
  * Catch2 now uses its own implementation of the URBG concept
    + In the future we also plan to use our own implementation
      of the distributions from `<random>` to provide
      cross-platform repeatability of random results
  version 2.9.2
  Fixes:
  * `ChunkGenerator` can now be used with chunks of size 0
    (#1671)
  * Nested subsections are now run properly when specific
    section is run via the `-c` argument (#1670, #1673)
  * Catch2 now consistently uses `_WIN32` to detect Windows
    platform (#1676)
  * `TEMPLATE_LIST_TEST_CASE` now support non-default
    constructible type lists (#1697)
  * Fixed a crash in the XMLReporter when a benchmark throws
    exception during warmup (#1706)
  * Fixed a possible infinite loop in CompactReporter (#1715)
  * Fixed `-w NoTests` returning 0 even when no tests were
    matched (#1449, #1683, #1684)
  * Fixed matcher compilation under Obj-C++ (#1661)
  Improvements:
  * `RepeatGenerator` and `FixedValuesGenerator` now fail to
    compile when used with `bool` (#1692)
    + Previously they would fail at runtime.
  * Catch2 now supports Android's debug logging for its debug
    output (#1710)
  * Catch2 now detects and configures itself for the RTX
    platform (#1693)
    + You still need to pass `--benchmark-no-analysis` if you
      are using benchmarking under RTX
  * Removed a "storage class is not first" warning when
    compiling Catch2 with PGI compiler (#1717)
  Miscellaneous:
  * Documentation now contains indication when a specific
    feature was introduced (#1695)
    + These start with Catch2 v2.3.0, (a bit over a year ago).
    + `docs/contributing.md` has been updated to provide
      contributors guidance on how to add these to newly written
      documentation
  * Various other documentation improvements
    + ToC fixes
    + Documented `--order` and `--rng-seed` command line options
    + Benchmarking documentation now clearly states that it
      requires opt-in
    + Documented `CATCH_CONFIG_CPP17_OPTIONAL` and
      `CATCH_CONFIG_CPP17_BYTE` macros
    + Properly documented built-in vector matchers
    + Improved `*_THROWS_MATCHES` documentation a bit
  * CMake config file is now arch-independent even if
    `CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` is in CMake cache (#1660)
  * `CatchAddTests` now properly escapes `[` and `]` in test
     names (#1634, #1698)
  * Reverted `CatchAddTests` adding tags as CTest labels (#1658)
    + The script broke when test names were too long
    + Overwriting `LABELS` caused trouble for users who set them
      manually
    + CMake does not let users append to `LABELS` if the test
      name has spaces
  version 2.9.1
  Fixes:
  * Fix benchmarking compilation failure in files without
    `CATCH_CONFIG_EXTERNAL_INTERFACES` (or implementation)
  version 2.9.0
  Improvements:
  * The experimental benchmarking support has been replaced by
    integrating Nonius code (#1616)
    + This provides a much more featurefull micro-benchmarking
      support.
    + Due to the compilation cost, it is disabled by default.
      See the documentation for details.
    + As far as backwards compatibility is concerned, this
      feature is still considered experimental in that we might
      change the interface based on user feedback.
  * `WithinULP` matcher now shows the acceptable range (#1581)
  * Template test cases now support type lists (#1627)
  version 2.8.0
  Improvements:
  * Templated test cases no longer check whether the provided
    types are unique (#1628)
    + This allows you to e.g. test over `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`,
      and `size_t` without compilation failing
  * The precision of floating point stringification can be
    modified by user (#1612, #1614)
  * We now provide `REGISTER_ENUM` convenience macro for
    generating `StringMaker` specializations for enums
    + See the "String conversion" documentation for details
  * Added new set of macros for template test cases that enables
    the use of NTTPs (#1531, #1609)
    + See "Test cases and sections" documentation for details
  Fixes:
  * `UNSCOPED_INFO` macro now has a
    prefixed/disabled/prefixed+disabled versions (#1611)
  * Reporting errors at startup should no longer cause a
    segfault under certain circumstances (#1626)
  Miscellaneous:
  * CMake will now prevent you from attempting in-tree build
    (#1636, #1638)
    + Previously it would break with an obscure error message
      during the build step
