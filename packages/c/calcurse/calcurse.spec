%description
Calcurse is a text-based personal organizer which helps keep track of events
and everyday tasks. It has a calendar and a "todo" list, and puts your
appointments in order. The user interface is configurable, and you can choose
between different color schemes and layouts. All of the commands are
documented within an online help system.
