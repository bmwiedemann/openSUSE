    calcurse source tree.
  * Experimental CalDAV support: The calcurse distribution tarball now includes
    an experimental script called calcurse-caldav that can be used to
    synchronize calcurse with your mobile devices or any other computer. For
    details, please refer to contrib/caldav/README in the calcurse source tree.
  * Support for a filter mode -F that is identical to -G but writes the
    filtered items back to the calcurse data files instead of stdout. Can be
    used to remove certain items from a script. Use with care!

    restrict the set of items that are read from the appointments file. All
    old command line options are still supported for backwards compatibility.
  * Support for shorthands such as "tomorrow" or "monday" as date specifiers.
  * Support for dates beyond 2038 on platforms with 64-bit time_t.
  * Several fixes to the user interface.
  * Handle CRLF line endings in iCal files
