%description
This software package computes Igusa (genus 2) class polynomials,
which parameterise the CM points in the moduli space of 2-dimensional
abelian varieties, i.e. Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves.

This program is also able to compute theta constants at arbitrary
precision.

%description -n %lname
This library package computes Igusa (genus 2) class polynomials,
which parameterise the CM points in the moduli space of 2-dimensional
abelian varieties, i.e. Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves.

It includes libraries that can be called from within a C program.
This subpackage provides the development headers for CM.
