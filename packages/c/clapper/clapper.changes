- Update to version 0.5.1:
  * A quick hotfix release. Fixes problems with new video sink on
    displays with non-100% scaling applied.
- Changes from version 0.5.0:
  * Clapper now includes an all new and improved GStreamer video
    sink. With it, we are moving away from GLArea into using
    GdkPaintable. This already gives us slight performance
    improvement in some cases and opens new possibilities to
    improve it further at a later time. New sink now also handles
    overlaying and displaying subtitles on the GTK side of things
    (as a separate GdkTextures instead of drawing them into
    framebuffer). Old, now called "legacy" sink is still included.
    If there are any problems with the new one, you can set
    CLAPPER_USE_LEGACY_SINK=1 env to use the old one.
  * Networking was ported into libsoup3. The built-in, unfinished
    web application was removed.
  * Additionally, app now supports D-Bus launching
    (DBusActivatable).
  * Some other misc fixes and few small UI changes were also done.
  * Updated translations.
- Update libnames define to align with soname.
