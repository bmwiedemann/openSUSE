  + Clapper was basically rewritten from scratch, but the most
    significant changes to the Clapper application itself include:
    - Brand new, simplified and consistent UI
    - Player now operates on playback queue model
    - Multiple queue progression modes to choose from (consecutive,
      repeat item, carousel, shuffle)
    - New media info window (shows media information and GStreamer
      elements used to play it)
    - More dialogs and windows use libadwaita
    - Multiple new status/info overlays showing what is going and
      other messages
    - Added video buffering animation
    - Clapper will now inform users about missing GStreamer plugins
      needed for playback
    - Video chapters now appear throughout the seek bar on hover and
      while dragging slider
    - Vastly expanded MPRIS implementation
    - Integrated media discovery (see titles of queued items instead
      of URIs)
    - Expanded WebSocket server functionality (for remote playback
      control)
    - Increased maximum volume amplification level to 200%
    - Added some new keyboard shortcuts
    - In addition to volume, now also speed and queue progression
      mode are restored on launch

- Update to version 0.5.1:
  * A quick hotfix release. Fixes problems with new video sink on
    displays with non-100% scaling applied.
- Changes from version 0.5.0:
  * Clapper now includes an all new and improved GStreamer video
    sink. With it, we are moving away from GLArea into using
    GdkPaintable. This already gives us slight performance
    improvement in some cases and opens new possibilities to
    improve it further at a later time. New sink now also handles
    overlaying and displaying subtitles on the GTK side of things
    (as a separate GdkTextures instead of drawing them into
    framebuffer). Old, now called "legacy" sink is still included.
    If there are any problems with the new one, you can set
    CLAPPER_USE_LEGACY_SINK=1 env to use the old one.
  * Networking was ported into libsoup3. The built-in, unfinished
    web application was removed.
  * Additionally, app now supports D-Bus launching
    (DBusActivatable).
  * Some other misc fixes and few small UI changes were also done.
  * Updated translations.
- Update libnames define to align with soname.
