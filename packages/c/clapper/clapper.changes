Mon Jan 20 21:34:47 UTC 2025 - Florian "spirit" <sp1rit@disroot.org>

- Update to version 0.8.0:
  + Notice:
    This release also introduces a brand new libpeas based plugin
	system for the Clapper library. The idea is to enhance it with
	new capabilities that do stuff outside of GStreamer scope of
	things. To avoid confusion with term plugins that GStreamer uses,
	they are called "enhancers" instead. They'll be expanded in the
	future.
  + What's Changed:
    * clapper: Player now uses playbin3 by default
    * clapper: Add APIs for media caching via download to local
	  storage
    * Add more command line options (including ability to set custom
	  GStreamer filter and sink elements)
    * Add "New Window" functionality in UI
    * Added menu option to clear playback queue
    * Resize app window to match aspect ratio with middle click or
	  keyboard shortcut
    * clapper: Add media item creation with cached file
    * clapper-app: Add unfullscreen keyboard shortcut
    * Support libpeas based plugin system
    * Add adaptive streaming bitrate control to Clapper API
    * clapper-app: Remember and restore optimal bitrate (video
	  quality) starting adaptive streaming
    * Make dektop file i18n.
    * clapper-gtk: Add video placeholder widget
    * Other various improvements and bug fixes
    * Updated translations

Thu Jun  9 14:20:30 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.5.1:
  * A quick hotfix release. Fixes problems with new video sink on
    displays with non-100% scaling applied.
- Changes from version 0.5.0:
  * Clapper now includes an all new and improved GStreamer video
    sink. With it, we are moving away from GLArea into using
    GdkPaintable. This already gives us slight performance
    improvement in some cases and opens new possibilities to
    improve it further at a later time. New sink now also handles
    overlaying and displaying subtitles on the GTK side of things
    (as a separate GdkTextures instead of drawing them into
    framebuffer). Old, now called "legacy" sink is still included.
    If there are any problems with the new one, you can set
    CLAPPER_USE_LEGACY_SINK=1 env to use the old one.
  * Networking was ported into libsoup3. The built-in, unfinished
    web application was removed.
  * Additionally, app now supports D-Bus launching
    (DBusActivatable).
  * Some other misc fixes and few small UI changes were also done.
  * Updated translations.
- Update libnames define to align with soname.
