- Update to 2.12.8.2:
  * Calc can now correctly compile without CUSTOM being defined

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 16 11:21:53 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.8.1:
  * Fixed how the *.tar.bz2 are formed.  The calc-2.12.8.0.tar.bz2 file
    that was formed for calc version 2.12.8.0 was missing most files.
  * Expanded 'make chk' to also verify that 'make distchk' and 'make
    distlist' execute successfully.  This will help check a regression
    of the bug that produced the bogus calc-2.12.8.0.tar.bz2 file.
  * Added additional regression tests related 0^(zero_expression)==1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 16 11:20:00 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.8.0:
  * Fixed a mistake in "help intro" where some inserted text changed
    the value of "." and thus made the next result incorrect.
  * Clarified in "help factor" that 1 is returned if no
    factor below the limit was found.
  * Removed Makefile variable ${MAKEFILE_REV}.
  * The missing cscript/square.calc file has been restored.
  * Fixed compiler errors and warnings related to GCC.  In particular,
    gcc/9.3.1 and gcc/10.2.1 now compile calc without any compiler
    errors or warnings, even with -Werror -Wextra -pedantic.
  * To print out information about the calc compilation
    environment, we added the following make rule:
  * make calcinfo
  * Improved how 'make debug' operates.
  * Created a new calc bug report Email address.  Created a new
    calc question Email address.  Created a new calc contribution
    Email address.  See the BUGS file for details.
  * Added "help questions" to print the QUESTIONS help file.
  * If the environment variable $CALCHELP is defined and is non-empty,
    then calc help files will be in the directory by the $CALCHISTFILE
    environment variable.
  * If the environment variable $CALCCUSTOMHELP is defined and is
    non-empty, then custom calc help files will be in the directory
    by the $CALCCUSTOMHELP environment variable.
  * Fixed a number of typos in text and in source code comments.

- Build with march=corei7 instead of native 
  to avoid compile-time CPU-detection (boo#1100677)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  4 08:22:25 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.7.6:
  * The missing cscript/square.calc file has been restored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  4 08:20:34 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.7.5:
  * Requiring calc shell scripts to use -s -f at the end of the
    initial #! line.
  * Fixed /tmp/mersenne example in calc(1) man page.
  * Added make variable ${ARCH_CFLAGS}.  The ${ARCH_CFLAGS} is
    added after ${CCMISC} and before ${EXTRA_CFLAGS} when building
    the ${CFLAGS} for compiling C code.  are ${CC} when compiling
    C files.  The default value is:
  * By default, the calc history file is located in ~/.calc_history.
    Now, if the environment variable $CALCHISTFILE is defined
    and is non-empty, then calc history file will be defined
    by the $CALCHISTFILE environment variable.
  * Calc as defined 0^0 as 1.  However in the past, 0 raised to
    an expression that evaluated to zero returned 1.  The result
    was that 0^0 was different than 0^(6-6) or even 0^(0).
    Now, calc will return 1 for 0^(0) and 0^zero when zero == 0.

Thu Dec 27 10:49:37 UTC 2012 - dvaleev@suse.com

- build with -DHAVE_NO_FPOS. Don't use fgetpos() and fsetpos() but 
  use fseek() and ftell() instead. The code that generates 
  fposval.h is completely broken. It tries to detect the size of 
  fpos_t but fails on ppc.
