Fri May 14 08:52:48 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.13.0.1:
  * Replaced /usr/local with the use of ${PREFIX} in calc Makefiles.
    The ${PREFIX} is not the same as ${T}.  The ${T} specifies
    a top level directory under which calc installs things.
    While usually ${T} is empty, it can be specific path
    as if calc where "chrooted" during an install.
    The ${PREFIX} value, during install, is a path between
    the top level ${T} install directory and the object
    such as an include file.

  * Corrected a few more typos in Makefile comments.
    - Added Makefile.local, a file with a single comment.  The main
     Makefile includes Makefile.local just before the first all rule.
     One may override any Makefile setting by modifying Makefile.local.
     For example, Makefile.local could force BLD_TYPE:
     HAVE_STRING_H:= YES
     HAVE_TIMES_H:= YES
     SED:= /usr/local/bin/nsed
    - Added ${LOC_MKF} to specify the make of the file that is
      included just before the all file.  So one could place
      the above override lines into a different file and call
      make changing the ${LOC_MKF} value.  For example:
    - make LOC_MKF=Makefile.private clobber all chk
    - Updated HOWTO.INSTALL to mention Makefile.local.

Wed Apr  7 07:41:36 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.13.0.0:
  * Fixed typo (missing quotes) in the env rule.
  * Fixed intendation problem in CHANGES.
  * Combined 2.12.9.1 changes into the 2.12.8.2 to 2.12.9.0
    range, and thus renamed the range to 2.12.8.2 to 2.12.9.1.
  * Fixed issues related to building Makefile.simple.
  * Fixed how the Makefile variable MANPATH is set for macOS.
  * Added a bunch of information to the near bottom of HOWTO.INSTALL
    on calc Makefiles.  This information discusses the various
    Makefiles found in the calc source.
  * Added comments in various calc Makefiles about their origin.
    In particular, for Makefiles that are constructed such as
    Makefile.simple, custom/Makefile and custom/Makefile.simple
    there are comments about how they were made.
  * For all calc Makefiles, including those in sub-directories,
    near the top there is now a line of the form:
    # SRC: ... some message about the origin ...
  * Fixed how the calc(1) man page is installed under macOS.
  * Fixed how calc man page in ${CATDIR} is formed.
  * Fixed how Makefile.simple is formed.
  * Fixed the #! calc script argument processing.  The initial #!
    line must end in a -f.  For example, if calc is in /usr/local/bin/calc,
    then the following would be the first line of a calc script:
  * It is common that -q be usde with a calc script, so assuming the
    same /usr/local/bin/calc path
  * Use of -s in the #! first line of a calc script is not needed
    since -f implies -f.
  * The argv() will now return values more typical of C's main().
    Before it returned one less than the number of arguments.  Now,
    for example, when calc is given 2 args, argv() will return 3.
  * The value of argv(0) will be the path to calc, or in the
    case of a #! calc cscript, it will return the name of the script.
  * Updated the calc man page and help/argv to reflect the
    above changes.
  * Improved the formatting of the calc man page.
  * Fixed the formation of the win32 sub-directory via the win32_hsrc
    Makefile rule.
  * Due to incompatible changes to the argv() function, and #! calc
    scripts, we are setting the version to the next minor number:
- Remove checksum.sha-256

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 12 08:54:39 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.19.0:
  * Added notes to help/unexpected about:
    display() will limit the number of digits printed after decimal point
    %d will format after the decimal point for non-integer numeric values
    %x will format as fractions for non-integer numeric values
    fprintf(fd, "%d\n", huge_value) may need fflush(fd) to finish
  * Fixed Makefile dependencies for the args.h rule.
  * Fixed Makefile cases where echo with -n is used.  On some systems,
    /bin/sh does not use -n, so we must call /bin/echo -n instead
    via the ${ECHON} Makefile variable.
  * Add missing standard tools to sub-Makefiles to make them
    easier to invoke directly.
  * Sort lists of standard tool Makefile variables and remove duplicates.
  * Declare the SHELL at the top of Makefiles.
  * Fixed the depend rule in the custom Makefile.
  * Improved the messages produced by the depend in the Makefiles.
  * Changed the UNUSED define in have_unused.h to be a macro with
    a parameter.  Changed all use of UNUSED in *.c to be UNUSED(x).
  * Removed need for HAVE_UNUSED in building the have_unused.h file.
  * CCBAN is given to ${CC} in order to control if banned.h is in effect.
  * The banned.h attempts to ban the use of certain dangerous functions
    that, if improperly used, could compromise the computational integrity
    if calculations.
  * In the case of calc, we are motivated in part by the desire for calc
    to correctly calculate: even during extremely long calculations.
  * If UNBAN is NOT defined, then calling certain functions
    will result in a call to a non-existent function (link error).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 22 10:57:23 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.8.2:
  * Calc can now correctly compile without CUSTOM being defined

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 16 11:21:53 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.8.1:
  * Fixed how the *.tar.bz2 are formed.  The calc-2.12.8.0.tar.bz2 file
    that was formed for calc version 2.12.8.0 was missing most files.
  * Expanded 'make chk' to also verify that 'make distchk' and 'make
    distlist' execute successfully.  This will help check a regression
    of the bug that produced the bogus calc-2.12.8.0.tar.bz2 file.
  * Added additional regression tests related 0^(zero_expression)==1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 16 11:20:00 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.8.0:
  * Fixed a mistake in "help intro" where some inserted text changed
    the value of "." and thus made the next result incorrect.
  * Clarified in "help factor" that 1 is returned if no
    factor below the limit was found.
  * Removed Makefile variable ${MAKEFILE_REV}.
  * The missing cscript/square.calc file has been restored.
  * Fixed compiler errors and warnings related to GCC.  In particular,
    gcc/9.3.1 and gcc/10.2.1 now compile calc without any compiler
    errors or warnings, even with -Werror -Wextra -pedantic.
  * To print out information about the calc compilation
    environment, we added the following make rule:
  * make calcinfo
  * Improved how 'make debug' operates.
  * Created a new calc bug report Email address.  Created a new
    calc question Email address.  Created a new calc contribution
    Email address.  See the BUGS file for details.
  * Added "help questions" to print the QUESTIONS help file.
  * If the environment variable $CALCHELP is defined and is non-empty,
    then calc help files will be in the directory by the $CALCHISTFILE
    environment variable.
  * If the environment variable $CALCCUSTOMHELP is defined and is
    non-empty, then custom calc help files will be in the directory
    by the $CALCCUSTOMHELP environment variable.
  * Fixed a number of typos in text and in source code comments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 14 19:08:34 UTC 2021 - Bernhard Wiedemann <bwiedemann@suse.com>

- Build with march=corei7 instead of native 
  to avoid compile-time CPU-detection (boo#1100677)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  4 08:22:25 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.7.6:
  * The missing cscript/square.calc file has been restored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  4 08:20:34 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.7.5:
  * Requiring calc shell scripts to use -s -f at the end of the
    initial #! line.
  * Fixed /tmp/mersenne example in calc(1) man page.
  * Added make variable ${ARCH_CFLAGS}.  The ${ARCH_CFLAGS} is
    added after ${CCMISC} and before ${EXTRA_CFLAGS} when building
    the ${CFLAGS} for compiling C code.  are ${CC} when compiling
    C files.  The default value is:
  * By default, the calc history file is located in ~/.calc_history.
    Now, if the environment variable $CALCHISTFILE is defined
    and is non-empty, then calc history file will be defined
    by the $CALCHISTFILE environment variable.
  * Calc as defined 0^0 as 1.  However in the past, 0 raised to
    an expression that evaluated to zero returned 1.  The result
    was that 0^0 was different than 0^(6-6) or even 0^(0).
    Now, calc will return 1 for 0^(0) and 0^zero when zero == 0.
