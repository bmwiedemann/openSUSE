  <title>Cluster synchronization tool</title>
  <description>Csync2 is a cluster synchronization tool. It can be used to keep files
on multiple hosts in a cluster in sync. Csync2 can handle complex
setups with much more than just 2 hosts, handle file deletions and can
detect conflicts. It is expedient for HA-clusters, HPC-clusters, COWs
and server farms.</description>
