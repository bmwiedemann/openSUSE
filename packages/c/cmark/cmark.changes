- update to 0.30.2
 * Fix parsing of emphasis before links (#424, Nick Wellnhofer).
    Fixes a regression introduced with commit ed0a4bf.
  * Update to Unicode 14.0 (data-man).
  * Add `~` to safe href character set (#394, frogtile).
  * Update CMakeLists.txt (Saleem Abdulrasool).  Bump the minimum required
    CMake to 3.7. Imperatively define output name for static library.
  * Fix install paths in libcmark.pc (Sebastián Mancilla).
    `CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>` can be relative or absolute path, so it is wrong to
    prefix CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX because if CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir> is set to an
    absolute path it will result in a malformed path with two absolute paths
    joined together.  Instead, use `CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>` from
    GNUInstallDirs.
  * Properly indent block-level contents of list items in man (#258).
    This handles nested lists as well as items with multiple paragraphs.
    The change requires addition of a new field block_number_in_list_item
    to cmark_renderer, but this does not change the public API.
  * Fix quadratic behavior when parsing emphasis (#389, Nick
    Wellnhofer).  Delimiters can be deleted, so store delimiter positions
    instead of pointers in `openers_bottom`. Besides causing undefined
    behavior when reading a dangling pointer, this could also result
    in quadratic behavior when parsing emphasis.
  * Fix quadratic behavior when parsing smart quotes (#388, Nick Wellnhofer).
    Remove matching smart quote delimiters.  Otherwise, the same opener
    could be found over and over, preventing the `openers_bottom`
    optimization from kicking in and leading to quadratic behavior when
    processing lots of quotes.
  * Modify CMake configuration so that the project can be built with
    older versions of CMake (#384, Saleem Abdulrasool).  (In 0.30.0,
    some features were used that require CMake >= 3.3.) The cost of this
    backwards compatibility is that developers must now explicitly invoke
    `cmark_add_compile_options` when a new compilation target is added.
  * Remove a comma at the end of an enumerator list, which was flagged
    by clang as a C++11 extension.
  * make_man_page.py: use absolute path with CDLL. This avoids the error
    "file system relative paths not allowed in hardened programs."
  * Include cmark version in cmark(3) man page (instead of LOCAL).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 21 06:45:39 UTC 2021 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 0.30.0
  * Use official 0.30 spec.txt.
  * Add `cmark_get_default_mem_allocator()` (#330).  API change: this
    adds a new exported function in cmark.h.
  * Fix #383.  An optimization we used for emphasis parsing was
    too aggressive, causing us to miss some emphasis that was legal
    according to the spec.  We fix this by indexing the `openers_bottom`
    table not just by the type of delimiter and the length of the
    closing delimiter mod 3, but by whether the closing delimiter
    can also be an opener.  (The algorithm for determining emphasis
    matching depends on all these factors.)  Add regression test.
  * Fix quadratic behavior with inline HTML (#299, Nick Wellnhofer).
    Repeated starting sequences like `<?`, `<!DECL ` or `<![CDATA[` could
    lead to quadratic behavior if no matching ending sequence was found.
    Separate the inline HTML scanners. Remember if scanning the whole input
    for a specific ending sequence failed and skip subsequent scans.
  * Speed up hierarchy check in tree manipulation API (Nick Wellnhofer).
    Skip hierarchy check in the common case that the inserted child has
    no children.
  * Fix quadratic behavior when parsing inlines (#373, Nick Wellnhofer).
    The inline parsing code would call `cmark_node_append_child` to append
    nodes. This public function has a sanity check which is linear in the
    depth of the tree. Repeated calls could show quadratic behavior in
    degenerate trees. Use a special function to append nodes without this
    check.  (Issue found by OSS-Fuzz.)
  * Replace invalid characters in XML output (#365, Nick wellnhofer).
    Control characters, U+FFFE and U+FFFF aren't allowed in XML 1.0, so
    replace them with U+FFFD (replacement character). This doesn't solve
    the problem how to roundtrip these characters, but at least we don't
    produce invalid XML.
  * Avoid quadratic output growth with reference links (#354, Nick Wellnhofer).
    Keep track of the number bytes added through expansion of reference
    links and limit the total to the size of the input document. Always
    allow a minimum of 100KB.  Unfortunately, cmark has no error handling,
    so all we can do is to stop expanding reference links without returning
    an error. This should never be an issue in practice though. The 100KB
    minimum alone should cover all real-world cases.
  * Fix issue with type-7 HTML blocks interrupting paragraphs
    (see commonmark/commonmark.js#213).
  * Treat `textarea` like `script`, `style`, `pre` (type 1 HTML block),
    in accordance with spec change.
  * Define whitespace per spec (Asherah Conor).
  * Add `MAX_INDENT` for xml (#355).  Otherwise we can get quadratic
    increase in size with deeply nested structures.
  * Fix handling of empty strings when creating XML/HTML output
    (Steffen Kieß).
  * Commonmark renderer: always use fences for code (#317).
    This solves problems with adjacent code blocks being merged.
  * Improve rendering of commonmark code spans with spaces (#316).
  * Cleaner approach to max digits for numeric entities.
    This modifies unescaping in `houdini_html_u.c` rather than
    the entity handling in `inlines.c`.  Unlike the other,
    this approach works also in e.g. link titles.
  * Fix entity parser (and api test) to respect length limit on
    numeric entities.
  * Don't allow link destinations with unbalanced unescaped parentheses.
    See commonmark/commonmark.js#177.
  * `print_usage()`: Minor grammar fix, swap two words (#305, Øyvind A. Holm).
  * Don't call `memcpy` with `NULL` as first parameter.
    This is illegal according to the C standard, sec. 7.1.4.
    See <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/06/26/nonnull.html>.
  * Add needed include in `blocks.c`.
  * Fix unnecessary variable assignment.
  * Skip UTF-8 BOM if present at beginning of buffer (#334).
  * Fix URL check in `is_autolink` (Nick Wellnhofer).  In a recent commit,
    the check was changed to `strcmp`, but we really have to use `strncmp`.
  * Fix null pointer deref in `is_autolink` (Nick Wellnhofer).
    Introduced by a recent commit. Found by OSS-Fuzz.
  * Rearrange struct cmark_node (Nick Wellnhofer).  Introduce multi-purpose
    data/len members in struct cmark_node. This is mainly used to store
    literal text for inlines, code and HTML blocks.
    Move the content strbuf for blocks from `cmark_node` to `cmark_parser`.
    When finalizing nodes that allow inlines (paragraphs and headings),
    detach the strbuf and store the block content in the node's data/len
    members. Free the block content after processing inlines.
    Reduces size of struct `cmark_node` by 8 bytes.
  * Improve packing of `struct cmark_list` (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Use C string instead of chunk in a number of contexts (Nick Wellnhofer,
    #309).  The node struct never references memory of other nodes now.
    Node accessors don't have to check for delayed creation of C strings,
    so parsing and iterating all literals using the public API should
    actually be faster than before.  These changes also reduce the size
    of `struct cmark_node`.
  * Add casts for MSVC10 (from kivikakk in cmark-cfm).
  * commonmark renderer:  better escaping in smart mode.  When
    `CMARK_OPT_SMART` is enabled, we escape literal `-`, `.`, and quote
    characters when needed to avoid their being "smartified."
  * Add options field to `cmark_renderer`.
  * commonmark.c - use `size_t` instead of `int`.
  * Include `string.h` in `cmark-fuzz.c`.
  * Fix #220 (hash collisions for references) (Vicent Marti via cmark-gfm).
    Reimplemented reference storage as follows:
    1. New references are always inserted at the end of a linked list. This
    is an O(1) operation, and does not check whether an existing (duplicate)
    reference with the same label already exists in the document.
    2. Upon the first call to `cmark_reference_lookup` (when it is expected
    that no further references will be added to the reference map), the
    linked list of references is written into a fixed-size array.
    3. The fixed size array can then be efficiently sorted in-place in O(n
    log n). This operation only happens once. We perform this sort in a
    _stable_ manner to ensure that the earliest link reference in the
    document always has preference, as the spec dictates. To accomplish
    this, every reference is tagged with a generation number when initially
    inserted in the linked list.
    4. The sorted array is then compacted in O(n). Since it was sorted in a
    stable way, the first reference for each label is preserved and the
    duplicates are removed, matching the spec.
    5. We can now simply perform a binary search for the current
    `cmark_reference_lookup` query in O(log n). Any further lookup calls
    will also be O(log n), since the sorted references table only needs to
    be generated once.
    The resulting implementation is notably simple (as it uses standard
    library builtins `qsort` and `bsearch`), whilst performing better than
    the fixed size hash table in documents that have a high number of
    references and never becoming pathological regardless of the input.
  * Comment out unused function `cmark_strbuf_cstr` in `buffer.h`.
  * Re-add `--safe` command-line option as a no-op (#344), for backwards
    compatibility.
  * Update to Unicode 13.0
  * Generate and install cmake-config file (Reinhold Gschweicher).
    Add full cmake support. The project can either be used with
    `add_subdirectory` or be installed into the system (or some other
    directory) and be found with `find_package(cmark)`. In both cases the
    cmake target `cmark::cmark` and/or `cmark::cmark_static` is all that
    is needed to be linked.  Previously the `cmarkConfig.cmake` file
    was generated, but not installed.  As additional bonus of generation
    by cmake we get a generated `cmake-config-version.cmake` file for
    `find_package()` to search for the same major version.
    The generated config file is position independent, allowing the
    installed directory to be copied or moved and still work.
    The following four files are generated and installed:
    `lib/cmake/cmark/cmark-config.cmake`,
    `lib/cmake/cmark/cmark-config-version.cmake`,
    `lib/cmake/cmark/cmark-targets.cmake`,
    `lib/cmake/cmark/cmark-targets-release.cmake`.
  * Adjust the MinGW paths for MinGW64 (Daniil Baturin).
  * Fix CMake generator expression checking for MSVC (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Fix `-Wconst-qual` warning (Saleem Abdulrasool).  This enables building
    with `/Zc:strictString` with MSVC as well.
  * Improve and modernize cmake build (Saleem Abdulrasool).
    + Build: add exports targets for build tree usage (#307).
    + Uuse target properties for include paths.
    + Remove the unnecessary execute permission on CMakeLists.txt.

  * Remove "-rdynamic" flag for static builds (#300, Eric Pruitt).
  * Fixed installation on other than Ubuntu GNU/Linux distributions
    (Vitaly Zaitsev).
  * Link executable with static or shared library (Nick Wellnhofer).
    If `CMARK_STATIC` is on (default), link the executable with the static
    library. This produces exactly the same result as compiling the library
    sources again and linking with the object files.
    If `CMARK_STATIC` is off, link the executable with the shared library.
    This wasn't supported before and should be the preferred way to
    package cmark on Linux distros.
    Building only a shared library and a statically linked executable
    isn't supported anymore but this doesn't seem useful.
  * Reintroduce version check for MSVC /TP flag (Nick Wellnhofer).
    The flag is only required for old MSVC versions.
  * normalize.py: use `html.escape` instead of `cgi.escape` (#313).
  * Fix pathological_tests.py on Windows (Nick Wellnhofer).
    When using multiprocessing on Windows, the main program must be
    guarded with a `__name__` check.
  * Remove useless `__name__` check in test scripts (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Add CIFuzz (Leo Neat).
  * cmark.1 - Document --unsafe instead of --safe (#332).
  * cmark.1: remove docs for `--normalize` which no longer exists (#332).
  * Add lint target to Makefile.
  * Add uninstall target to Makefile.
  * Update benchmarks (#338).
  * Fix typo in documentation (Tim Gates).
  * Increase timeout for pathological tests to avoid CI failure.
  * Update the Racket wrapper with the safe -> unsafe flag change (Eli
    Barzilay).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  6 09:15:08 UTC 2019 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 0.29.0
  * Update spec to 0.29.
  * Make rendering safe by default (#239, #273).
    Adds `CMARK_OPT_UNSAFE` and make `CMARK_OPT_SAFE` a no-op (for API
    compatibility).  The new default behavior is to suppress raw HTML and
    potentially dangerous links.  The `CMARK_OPT_UNSAFE` option has to be set
    explicitly to prevent this.
    **NOTE:** This change will require modifications in bindings for cmark
    and in most libraries and programs that use cmark.
    Borrows heavily from @kivikakk's patch in github/cmark-gfm#123.
  * Add sourcepos info for inlines (Yuki Izumi).
  * Disallow more than 32 nested balanced parens in a link (Yuki Izumi).
  * Resolve link references before creating setext header.
    A setext header line after a link reference should not
    create a header, according to the spec.
  * commonmark renderer: improve escaping.
    URL-escape special characters when escape mode is URL, and not otherwise.
    Entity-escape control characters (< 0x20) in non-literal escape modes.
  * render:  only emit actual newline when escape mode is LITERAL.
    For markdown content, e.g., in other contexts we want some
    kind of escaping, not a literal newline.
  * Update code span normalization to conform with spec change.
  * Allow empty `<>` link destination in reference link.
  * Remove leftover includes of `memory.h` (#290).
  * A link destination can't start with `<` unless it is
    an angle-bracket link that also ends with `>` (#289).
    (If your URL really starts with `<`, URL-escape it.)
  * Allow internal delimiter runs to match if both have lengths that are
    multiples of 3.  See commonmark/commonmark#528.
  * Include `references.h` in `parser.h` (#287).
  * Fix `[link](<foo\>)`.
  * Use hand-rolled scanner for thematic break (see #284).
    Keep track of the last position where a thematic break
    failed to match on a line, to avoid rescanning unnecessarily.
  * Rename `ends_with_blank_line` with `S_` prefix.
  * Add `CMARK_NODE__LAST_LINE_CHECKED` flag (#284).
    Use this to avoid unnecessary recursion in `ends_with_blank_line`.
  * In `ends_with_blank_line`, call `S_set_last_line_blank`
    to avoid unnecessary repetition (#284).  Once we settle whether a list
    item ends in a blank line, we don't need to revisit this in considering
    parent list items.
  * Disallow unescaped `(` in parenthesized link title.
  * Copy line/col info straight from opener/closer (Ashe Connor).
    We can't rely on anything in `subj` since it's been modified while parsing
    the subject and could represent line info from a future line.  This is
    simple and works.
  * `render.c`: reset `last_breakable` after cr.  Fixes jgm/pandoc#5033.
  * Fix a typo in `houdini_href_e.c` (Felix Yan).
  * commonmark writer: use `~~~` fences if info string contains backtick.
    This is needed for round-trip tests.
  * Update scanners for new info string rules.
  * Add XSLT stylesheet to convert cmark XML back to Commonmark
    (Nick Wellnhofer, #264).  Initial version of an XSLT stylesheet that
    converts the XML format produced by `cmark -t xml` back to Commonmark.
  * Check for whitespace before reference title (#263).
  * Bump CMake to version 3 (Jonathan Müller).
  * Build: Remove deprecated call to `add_compiler_export_flags()`
    (Jonathan Müller).  It is deprecated in CMake 3.0, the replacement is to
    set the `CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET` (or in our case `C_VISIBILITY_PRESET`) and
    `VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` properties of the target.  We're already
    setting them by setting the CMake variables anyway, so the call can be
    removed.
  * Build: only attempt to install MSVC system libraries on Windows
    (Saleem Abdulrasool).  Newer versions of CMake attempt to query the system
    for information about the VS 2017 installation.  Unfortunately, this query
    fails on non-Windows systems when cross-compiling:
    `cmake_host_system_information does not recognize <key> VS_15_DIR`.
    CMake will not find these system libraries on non-Windows hosts anyways,
    and we were silencing the warnings, so simply omit the installation when
    cross-compiling to Windows.
  * Simplify code normalization, in line with spec change.
  * Implement code span spec changes.  These affect both parsing and writing
    commonmark.
  * Add link parsing corner cases to regressions (Ashe Connor).
  * Add `xml:space="preserve"` in XML output when appropriate
    (Nguyễn Thái Ngọc Duy).
    (For text, code, code_block, html_inline and html_block tags.)
  * Removed meta from list of block tags.  Added regression test.
    See commonmark/CommonMark#527.
  * `entity_tests.py` - omit noisy success output.
  * `pathological_tests.py`: make tests run faster.
    Commented out the (already ignored) "many references" test, which
    times out.  Reduced the iterations for a couple other tests.
  * `pathological_tests.py`: added test for deeply nested lists.
  * Optimize `S_find_first_nonspace`.  We were needlessly redoing things we'd
    already done.  Now we skip the work if the first nonspace is greater than
    the current offset.  This fixes pathological slowdown with deeply nested
    lists (#255).  For N = 3000, the time goes from over 17s to about 0.7s.
    Thanks to Martin Mitas for diagnosing the problem.
  * Allow spaces in link destination delimited with pointy brackets.
  * Adjust max length of decimal/numeric entities.
    See commonmark/CommonMark#487.
  * Fix inline raw HTML parsing.
    This fixes a recently added failing spec test case.  Previously spaces
    were being allowed in unquoted attribute values; no we forbid them.
  * Don't allow list markers to be indented >= 4 spaces.
    See commonmark/CommonMark#497.
  * Check for empty buffer when rendering (Phil Turnbull).
    For empty documents, `->size` is zero so
    `renderer.buffer->ptr[renderer.buffer->size - 1]` will cause an
    out-of-bounds read. Empty buffers always point to the global
    `cmark_strbuf__initbuf` buffer so we read `cmark_strbuf__initbuf[-1]`.
  * Also run API tests with `CMARK_SHARED=OFF` (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Rename roundtrip and entity tests (Nick Wellnhofer).
    Rename the tests to reflect that they use the library, not the
    executable.
  * Generate export header for static-only build (#247, Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Fuzz width parameter too (Phil Turnbull).  Allow the `width` parameter to
    be generated too so we get better fuzz-coverage.
  * Don't discard empty fuzz test-cases (Phil Turnbull).  We currently discard
    fuzz test-cases that are empty but empty inputs are valid markdown. This
    improves the fuzzing coverage slightly.
  * Fixed exit code for pathological tests.
  * Add allowed failures to `pathological_tests.py`.
    This allows us to include tests that we don't yet know how to pass.
  * Add timeout to `pathological_tests.py`.
    Tests must complete in 8 seconds or are errors.
  * Add more pathological tests (Martin Mitas).
    These tests target the issues #214, #218, #220.
  * Use pledge(2) on OpenBSD (Ashe Connor).
  * Update the Racket wrapper (Eli Barzilay).
  * Makefile: For afl target, don't build tests.

- update to 0.26.0
* Implement spec changes for list items:
	+ Empty list items cannot interrupt paragraphs.
	+ Ordered lists cannot interrupt paragraphs unless they start with 1.
	+ Removed "two blank lines break out of a list" feature.
* Fix sourcepos for blockquotes.
* Fix sourcepos for atx headers).
* Fix ATX headers and thematic breaks to allow tabs as well as spaces.
* Fix chunk_set_cstr with suffix of current string
* Export targets on installation
* Fix cmake warning about CMP0048
* commonmark renderer: Ensure we don't have a blank line before a code block when
	 it's the first thing in a list item.
* Change parsing of strong/emph in response to spec changes. process_emphasis now 
	gets better results in corner cases. The change is this: when considering
	matches between an interior delimiter run (one that can open and can close)
	and another delimiter run, we require that the sum of the lengths of the two
	delimiter runs mod 3 is not 0.
* Ported Robin Stocker's changes to link parsing in jgm/CommonMark#101. This uses
	a separate stack for brackets, instead of putting them on the delimiter stack.
	This avoids the need for looking through the delimiter stack for
	the next bracket.
* cmark_reference_lookup: Return NULL if reference is null string.
* Fix character type detection in commonmark.c
	+ Implement cmark_isalpha.
	+ Check for ASCII character before implicit cast to char.
	+ Use internal ctype functions in commonmark.c.
* Better documentation of memory-freeing responsibilities. in cmark.h and
	 its man page
* Use library functions to insert nodes in emphasis/link processing. Previously we
	 did this manually, which introduces many places where errors can creep in.
* Correctly handle list marker followed only by spaces. Previously when a list
	marker was followed only by spaces, cmark expected the following content to be
	indented by the same number of spaces. But in this case we should treat the
	line just like a blank line and set list padding accordingly.
* Fixed a number of issues relating to line wrapping.
	+ Extend CMARK_OPT_NOBREAKS to all renderers and add --nobreaks.
	+ Do not autowrap, regardless of width parameter, if CMARK_OPT_NOBREAKS is set.
	+ Fixed CMARK_OPT_HARDBREAKS for LaTeX and man renderers.
	+ Ensure that no auto-wrapping occurs if CMARK_OPT_NOBREAKS is enabled, or if
	  output is CommonMark and CMARK_OPT_HARDBREAKS is enabled.
* Set stdin to binary mode on Windows
* Add library option to render softbreaks as spaces. Note that the NOBREAKS option
	 is HTML-only
* renderer: no_linebreaks instead of no_wrap. We generally want this option to
	 prohibit any breaking in things like headers (not just wraps, but softbreaks).
* Coerce realurllen to int. This is an alternate solution for pull request, which 
	introduced a new warning on the comparison.
* Remove unused variable link_text.
* Improved safety checks in buffer.
* Add new interface allowing specification of custom memory allocator for nodes.
	 Added cmark_node_new_with_mem, cmark_parser_new_with_mem, cmark_mem to API.
* Reduce storage size for nodes by using bit flags instead of separate booleans.
* cmake: Global handler for OOM situations.
* Add tests for memory exhaustion.
* Document in man page and public header that one should use the same memory
	 allocator for every node in a tree.
* Fix ctypes in Python FFI calls (Nick Wellnhofer). This didn't cause problems
	so far because all types are 32-bit on 32-bit systems and arguments are passed
	in registers on x86-64. The wrong types could cause crashes on other
	platforms, though.
* Remove spurious failures in roundtrip tests. In the commonmark writer we separate
	lists, and lists and indented code, using a dummy HTML comment. 
	So in evaluating the round-trip tests, we now strip out these comments.
	We also normalize HTML to avoid issues having to do with line breaks.
* Added to_commonmark in test/cmark.py (for round-trip tests).
* spec_test.py - parameterize do_test with converter.
* spec_tests.py: exit code is now sum of failures and errors. This ensures that
	a failing exit code will be given when there are errors, not just with failures.
* Fixed round trip tests. Previously they actually ran cmark instead of
	the round-trip version, since there was a bug in setting the ROUNDTRIP variable.
* Added new roundtrip_tests.py. This replaces the old use of simple shell scripts.
	It is much faster, and more flexible. (We will be able to do custom
	normalization and skip certain tests.)
* Fix leak in api_test.
* Makefile: have leakcheck stop on first error instead of going through all
	the formats and options and probably getting the same output.
* Add regression tests.
