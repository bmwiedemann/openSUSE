  <title>A Program for Generating Patch Set Information from a CVS Repository</title>
  <description>CVSps is a program for generating 'patchset' information from a CVS
repository. In this case, a patchset is defined as a set of changes
made to a collection of files, all committed at the same time (using a
single 'cvs commit' command). This information is valuable for seeing
the big picture of the evolution of a CVS project. While CVS tracks
revision information, it is often difficult to see what changes were
'atomically' committed to the repository.</description>
