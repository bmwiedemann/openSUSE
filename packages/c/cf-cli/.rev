    <comment>- Require specific version for self-test; disable debug packages in test to prevent error about missing files
- update to version 6.40.1
  ### Bug Fixes
  - Updates the minimum version for the buildpacks-stacks association feature. In [CLI v6.39.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.39.0), when the feature was released, we incorrectly set the minimum to cc api version as`2.114`. The minimum cc api version is now correctly set to [`2.112`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.58.0).  [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161464797)
  - Fixes a bug with inspecting a service instance `cf service service-instance`, now the `documentation` url displays correctly for services which populate that field [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161251875)
- update to version 6.40.0
  ### Bug Fixes
  - Fix bug where trailing slash on cf api would break listing commands for older CC APIs story. For older versions of CC API, if the API URL had a trailing slash, some requests would fail with an &quot;Unknown request&quot; error. These requests are now handled properly.
- update to version 6.39.1
- update to version 6.39.0
  ### Enhancements
  - for users on cc api 3.27, cf start is enhanced to display the new cf app v3 output. For users on cc api 3.27 or lower, users will see the same v2 output. Note that if you use v3 commands to create and start your app, if you subsequently use cf stop and cf start, the routes property in cf app will not populate even though the route exists story
  - for users on cc api 3.27, cf restart is enhanced to display the new cf app v3 output. For users on cc api 3.27 or lower, users will see the same v2 output. story
  - for users on cc api 3.27, cf restage is enhanced to display the new cf app v3 output. For users on cc api 3.27 or lower, users will see the same v2 output. story
  - improved help text for -d domains for cf push to include examples of usage story
  - cf v3-scale displays additional app information story
  - if you've created an internal domain, and it is the first domain in cc, the CLI will now ignore the internal domain and instead choose the next non-internal domain when you push an app story
  ### Bug Fixes
  - Fix for users on macOS attempting to brew install cf-cli the CF CLI using the unreleased master branch of Homebrew story
  - Fixes an issue whereby, due to a recent cc api change, when you execute cf push and watch the cf app command, the app display returned a 400 error story
  - Fixes a bug whereby if you logged in using client credentials, cf auth user pass --client credentials you were unable to create an org; now create-org will assign the role to the user id specified in your manifest story
  - fixes an issue introduced when we refactored cf start and as part of that work, we stopped blocking on the initial connection with the logging backend; now the CLI blocks until the NOAA connection is made, or the default dial timeout of five seconds is reached story
- Change package self-test to _multibuild single-spec file approach for easier
  handling of package submissions
- update to version 6.38.0
  ### Enhancements
  - v3-ssh process type now defaults to web story

  ### Bugs
  - fix for `cf enable-service-access -p plan` whereby when we refactored the code in CLI `v6.41.0` it created service plan visibilities as part of a subsequent run of the command (the unrefactored code skipped creating the service plan visibilities); now the command will skip creating service plan visibilities as it did prior to the refactor [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/162747373)

    <comment>- update to version 6.48.0
  ### Enhancements
  - Improve Behavior of --random-route Flag. Increased the size of the namespace used for generating random route names from eight thousand to over five million. This reduces the odds of a name conflict.
  ### Bug Fixes
  - Fixes a bug where `cf delete app -r` did not delete routes if you had more than 50 routes associated with the app. [Story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/165714515)
  - Fixes a bug where `cf create-buildpack` would return a misleading error when the buildpack name had invalid characters. [Story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168183422)
