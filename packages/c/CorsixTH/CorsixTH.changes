  - Gameplay
    * Change: You can now build more than one desk in the ward. More nurses means a slightly faster throughput.
    * Change: Patients would previously queue outside toilets even though there were free loos since it was dependant on number of people in the room. Now, as soon as a loo becomes free another patient enters the room to use it, even if there is a long queue for the sink).

    * Added: Confirm dialog to the quit/exit button on the main menu.
    * Fix: The tooltip for the tutorial button was incorrect since the dialog has been visually changed.

  - User Interface
    * Added: Scrolling momentum when using the middle button.
    * Added: There is now a clock in the right corner of the menu bar that shows the real world time. It can be toggled between AM/PM and 24h in the configuration file.
