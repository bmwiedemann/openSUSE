Fri May 24 19:04:31 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.63
  * Game music now supports ogg, flac, wav, aiff, voc, and mod in
    addition to mp3 and mid/xmi tracks.
  * No more hunting for that machine that's always breaking down.
    Save your camera position with ALT+number, and restore with
    CTRL+number.
  * Announcements are now queued to play one after another instead
    of overlapping.
  * New man page for unix like operating systems.
  * Fax message improvements.
  * All hotkeys in the game are now configurable from within a
    new option in the settings menu.
  * Configure the scroll and zoom speed in game.
  * Improved mouse 'release' behaviour. Release mouse (CTRL+F10 by
    default) now always releases the mouse, so the game will not
    scroll when moving out of the window. Clicking in the game
    window causes the game to recognize the mouse again.
- Run spec-cleaner.
- Installation of Icon- and desktop files are now properly handled
  by the upstream buildsystem.

Thu Dec 28 17:20:16 UTC 2017 - mailaender@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.61
    - Mouse capture support. Now by default the mouse will be captured in its window. You can use CTRL-F10 to temporarily toggle the mouse capture state, or disable it in the config file.
    - Added multigesture movement and zoom for supported devices.
    - Fix for broken pathfinding involving the removal of side objects such as benches and radiators.
    - Allow objects to be built on top of litter and rat holes.
    - Fix for game error when handymen attempted to clean removed litter.
    - Can now click and hold to quickly change handyman priorities.
    - Significant map editor performance improvement when selecting multiple tiles.
    - If the config option to allow playing while paused is enabled, you can now make use of the bottom panel.
    - Fixed several bugs relating to the mood displays for staff and patients.
    - Rooms can now be built over top of trash.
    - Rat holes will now appear in dirty hospitals. Unfortunately the rats themselves are still hiding away.
    - Earthquakes now behave more like in Theme Hospital. A warning earthquake that does no damage will come first so that you can get ready for the big one. The damage calculations and visual effect have also been redone to be closer to the original game.
    - The game window can now be resized by dragging the edges.
    - We now avoid overlapping graph labels so all labels are readable.
    - Many many many bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 18 10:34:12 UTC 2016 - mailaender@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.60

  * Highlights from this release include:
    - User campaigns - It is now possible to create a series of levels that play together just like the original game.
    - In game map editor - A new map editor is available directly from the game menu.
    - Drug price impact - Patients will now react to the price you set for treatments. If treatments cost too much patients will opt to go home instead and this can affect your reputation.
    - Variable spawn rate - The spawn rate will now take into account your hospital's reputation (after a date set in the level file.)
    - Machine smoke is now visible when machines are close to worn out.
    - Right clicking the timer is now supported like in the original game for moving to affected patients - See issue #882 for details.
    - Numpad support - The number pad can now be used to move around the map when numlock is off, or to type numbers when numlock is on, without side effects.
    - The MP3 folder can now be unset from within the game. Previously after setting an mp3 folder it could only be removed by editing the config file by hand.
    - Uses the proper cursor for resizing rooms.
    - Bins can now be placed in the hallways.
    - Temperature impact has been tweaked. The initial grace period has been removed and the overall impact has been softened.
    - Custom maps can now be stored in a user directory separate from the levels shipped with the game.

  * Notable bug fixes:
    - Free build mode is now truly free - rooms used to cost money in this mode.
    - In game movies will now work correctly on more hardware.
    - Sound effects are no longer played when sound is disabled.
    - VIP rewards have been tweaked to closer match expectations when the impression is mediocre.
    - Crash when a patient is selected while they walk off the map is fixed.
    - A room built next to an unowned parcel no longer loses its wall when the parcel is bought.
    - Beta 1 regression that caused fired staff to continue to be paid has been patched.
    - Beta 1 regression that caused the last cured emergency patient not to count has been patched.
    - King complex patients only pay for their cure once.
    - Patients will notice when a room they are waiting for becomes available.
    - Properly load saves with more than one object on a tile.
    - Do not get stuck in an infinite loop when no disease is available to spawn.

- update to version 0.30
  - Gameplay
    * Change: You can now build more than one desk in the ward. More nurses means a slightly faster throughput.
    * Change: Patients would previously queue outside toilets even though there were free loos since it was dependant on number of people in the room. Now, as soon as a loo becomes free another patient enters the room to use it, even if there is a long queue for the sink).
