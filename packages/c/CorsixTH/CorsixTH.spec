%description
This project aims to reimplement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be
able to load the original game data files. This means that you will need a
purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order to use
CorsixTH. After most of the original engine has been reimplemented in open
source code, the project will serve as a base from which extensions and
improvements to the original game can be made.
