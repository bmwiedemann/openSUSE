- update to 0.7 (bsc#966695):
  Bug fixes
  * Separate locking files are no longer used which avoids deadlock in
    cases where the system is stopped in the small window where these
    files exist.
  * Files are now synced after writing for better Durability.
  * crudini no longer removes a blank line from the start of a file
    which has no sections, or options outside a section. [bug
    introduced in version 0.5]
  Bug fixes
  * Lock files are cleaned up robustly. Previously there was a race
    condition resulting in blocked subsequent edits, due to a
    lingering lock file.  
  * --del will ignore requests to delete a parameter in a non-existing
      section (unless --existing is used). Previously it failed citing
      the missing section.
  New features
  * The --existing option takes parameters to give more control over
    what needs to pre-exist. So you can specify for example that a
    file needs to exist, but any items within it are created as
    needed.
  * A new --verbose option was added to indicate on stderr wether the
    request resulted in a config change or not. This can be used to
    determine whether to restart programs etc.
  Changes in behavior
  * Files are created by default if missing, unless --existing is
    specified.
  Improvements
  * Protections against creating unparseable ini files were added.
  * stdin can be parsed just as with normal files.
  * File writes are avoided if there are no changes to the config.
