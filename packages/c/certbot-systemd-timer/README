# Automated renewal of certificates

This package includes an optional systemd timer to handle certbot certificate renewals.

This timer is set to run daily, with a random fudge factor of a 6 hours applied.

To enable the timer based renewals:

```
systemctl enable --now certbot-renew.timer
```

The timer makes use of /etc/sysconfig/certbot to customise the behaviour.

Unless there is a plugin that automates restarts (eg the apache plugin) it is
important to configure a command to restart anything that uses the certificates
