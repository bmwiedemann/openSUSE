-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  4 18:02:00 UTC 2018 - tabraham@suse.com

- Update to 4.3.0
  + disable -sL, should have been done at same time -sl was
 
- Changes from 4.2.0
  + Updated Plotfile docs to explain why you shouldn't leave off the -f
    when using -P [thanks Bayard]
  + added support for InfiniBand OPA V4 to read start from /sys instead of
    having to rely on perfquery for 64 bit counters. [thanks frederic]
  + removed previos bug introduced in V4.1.2 that was not properly calculating
    disk summaries. If you do have any raw files collected with this version
    you WILL be able to play them back properly or create and plot files with
    this version
  + although I'm stil leaving the lustre code in place because there is so much
    of it, I did remove cciss disk types from non-lustre code
  + finally removed col2tlviz from kit [thanks tom]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 29 09:03:54 UTC 2018 - glin@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  3 13:53:59 UTC 2017 - tabraham@suse.com

- Update to 4.1.2
  + incorrectly requiring a + with --rawdskfilt to be at beginning
  + when added support for 64bit IB counters it looks like I was only
    saving 3 of the 4 values (loop only went to 3 instead of 4)
    around line 4403. [thanks seb]

- Changes from 4.1.1
  + added packet loss and fast restransmissions to TCP Extended versbose
    output and renamed AkNoPy and PreAck to PurAck and HPAcks to be
    consistent with earlier versions [thanks Sophie]
  + add support for nvme disks [thanks fred]
  + it turns out some people re-enable lustre support for the sake of
    monitoring clients and to support that I had to add a check for
    the lustre-client module which is now in a differetn location than
    others [thanks fred] 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 11 22:30:47 UTC 2016 - tabraham@suse.com

  + allow lexpr to pass formatting information for strings and numbers

  + modify the way misc.ph reports uptime to thousandths of a day [thanks, seb] 
  + added OPA interface support for -sx reporting and cleaned up some very      
    old code, like quadrics support! [thanks fred] 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 14 15:49:11 UTC 2016 - tabraham@suse.com

- Update to 4.0.5
  + rawdskfilt has been enhanced to allow a preceding + which will              
    cause the following string to be appended to the default filter             
  + needed to initialized anonH for numa stats [thanks andy]                    
  + added 'hed' to known ethernet devices, used by HP Helion        

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  4 11:51:38 UTC 2016 - tabraham@suse.com

- Update to 4.0.4
  + if you try to playback a file with --stats and it has recorded              
    processes or slabs, ignore them be removing from $subsys 
  + playback of process data with -P was not skipping first interval and so     
    stats for first entry we not rates but rather raw numbers
  + change 'yikes' message to something more meaningful
  + fixed problem with -sZ -P printing all 0s for thread count
  + added /usr/lib/systemd/system/collectl.service, per sourceforge help        
    discussion on 2015-12-28                                   
  + added disk read/write wait timing for disk detail in terminal, plot         
    and lexpr format                                               
  + new switch dskremap allows one to change disk names on the fly because      
    in some cases such as etherd disks, the names are messy for use with        
    other tools like ganlia                                     
  + removed access to disk name remapping file                                  
  + the rawdskfilt has been enhanced to allow a preceding + which will          
    cause the following string to be appended to the default filter             
                                                                                
- Changes from 4.0.3
  + add AnonHuge memory to memory stats, both verbose and detailed as           
    well as lexpr                                                 
  + if lexpr called with --import, throw an error                               
  + tighten divide-by-zero test for -sM because it looks like in some cases 
    when misses >0 we're getting occasional errors.  could hits be somehow 
    negative?

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 28 18:34:49 UTC 2015 - tabraham@suse.com

- Update to 4.0.2
  * add /bin/bash to list of 'known shells' excluded from output with
    --procopt k
  * generalize ethernet network device name to include ALL names
    matching type 'p\dp' so we pick up p2p, p3p, p4p... [thanks Matt]
  * collect nr_shmem so we can track shared memory, apparently something
    I thought of but never acted on [thanks Christian]
  * do not include guest cpu metrics in totals since already accounted
    for in user time

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 20 13:42:38 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 4.0.0
  * for a complete list of changes see RELEASE-collectl

  See RELEASE-collectl for changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 12 23:17:15 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.6.9
  + Typo in network plot header loop resulted in infinite loop
  + remove $int/secs from numa hit rate calc AND add more precision
    to its output
- Changes from 3.6.8
  + new flag $exportComm must be set in gexpr/ganglia so that they won't
    generate an error if run without -f or -A
  + new switch: --intfilt allows filtering of interrupts
  + always log messages of type F/E to syslog in daemon mode even if
    -m is not set
  + wasn't dealing correctly with missing whitespace after network name in
    /proc/dev/net in initRecord()
  + updated init.d script for suse per the maintainer's instructions
  + extra spaces were being printed in plot mode for tpc stats
  + added entry to envrules.std to deal with intel Phi Co-Processor
  + debian init.d script now does 'exit 1' if status reports 'not running'
  + rawnetignore switch wasn't working correctly
  + found/fixed some subtle problems with --procanalyze as well as some cleanup
    - need to ignore first sample after initializing summary arrays
    - need to init summary hashes for thrutime and accumT because get uninit var
      in print routine is only a single process entry
    - found a typo in procAnalyze() to a $usecs which wasn't being used!
    - added error check to make sure --procanalyze with -P requires -s
  + added a little more debugging output for -d128
  + discovered dynamic disk/network detail names for interactive mode were not
    being reported correctly.  sounds a lot worse than it is because this is
    typically not done very often nor are disks/networks very dynamic except in
    large, virtualized environments such as clouds
  + add to list of devices to exlude from network summary data: tap, dp and nl,
    which are associated with openstack cinder.  remember you can always add
    more to that list with --netfilt
  + $lastHour was never referenced and dayInit() called every time a log was
    created so fix logic to update $lastHour correctly AND call initDay() one
    time and do it before newLog() called.
  + closed a couple of file handles that were left open and reportedly
    causing some defunct processes with -sx.
  + fixed bug in lustre stats recording
  + clarified --showsubopts text about disk and network filters in that they
    apply to both summary and detail data output
  + fixed problem with --import and --stats
  + --statsopt a didn't work because when changed some internal logic missed
    changing a test of $timestampFlag to $timestampCounter[$rawPFlag] and so
    now $timestampCount can be removed entirely
  + clear $firstpass after 1st pass during playback
  + make sure filename initialized before calling loadConfig so if there is
    an error logsys() doesn't get an undefined var warning
  + to be safe, remove any quotes on net/dsk filters in case included by
    mistake in DaemonCommands string
  + tightened up tests to see if daemonized collectl already running
  + if no hiRes::Time, fudge the value of $microInterval based on -i
  + new --procOpt k, removes known shells from process listing with -sZ,
    currently set to /bin.sh, /usr/bin/perl, /usr/bin/python and python
  + fixed varname in lexpr: $debug should have been $lexDebug
