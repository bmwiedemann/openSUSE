  <title>Swap endianess of a cram filesystem (cramfs)</title>
  <description>cramfs is a highly compressed and size optimized linux filesystem which is
mainly used for embedded applications. the problem with cramfs is that it
is endianess sensitive, meaning you can't mount a cramfs for a big endian
target on a little endian machine and vice versa. this is often especially
a problem in the development phase.

cramfsswap solves that problem by allowing you to swap to endianess of a
cramfs filesystem.
