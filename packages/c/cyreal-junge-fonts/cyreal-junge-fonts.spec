%description
Junge is an elegant and slim text typeface inspired by the calligraphy
of GÃ¼nther Junge. Thanks to a combination of features it performs
equally well in most ranges. At small sizes it builds the impression of
flittering strokes. In large headlines its refined detailing become
visible. It is not as strictly structured as a text typeface, and has
subtle irregularities reminiscent of its calligraphic origin.
