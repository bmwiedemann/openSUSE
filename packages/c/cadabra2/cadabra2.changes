    better.

    nested inside another.

    right-hand side of equations.
  * Fixed: sort_product does not always sort expressions.
  * Fixed: eliminate_metric only acts at top level of an
    expression, should have deep=True by default.
  * Fixed: a bug which would lead to a segfault when using
    deep=True. 
- Rebase cadabra2-cmake-error.patch for version update.
- Add %{name}-rpmlintrc file to suppress warnings about the
  presence of "__DATE__" and/or "__TIME__" in generated html files

  failures.
