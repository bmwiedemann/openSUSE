-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 11 12:04:47 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

  out a new tarball without changes to the versioning, making the
  source validator service complain about the mismatch.

  * Extended rename_dummies with capability to rename indices to
    different set.
  * Make vary work on powers of expressions with dummy indices.

    A+B=C in ex:=A+B+C+D).
  * Improved LaTeX export to make printed notebooks look much
    better.
  * Many improvements to the component engine, in particular for
    handling of derivatives and fractions involving tensors.

  * Smarter scroll-to-cell behaviour of the notebook.
  * Canonicalising expressions with component values for indices
    now works again.

    a library (see the c++lib directory).
  * Fixes for using a custom post_process defined as a function
    nested inside another.
  * Rudimentary timing logic, try server.totals();
  * Fixed: pasting text in the notebook sometimes double-pastes.
  * Fixed: split_index does not work properly on left- and
    right-hand side of equations.
  * Fixed: sort_product does not always sort expressions.
  * Fixed: eliminate_metric only acts at top level of an
    expression, should have deep=True by default.
  * Fixed: a bug which would lead to a segfault when using
    deep=True. 
- Rebase cadabra2-cmake-error.patch for version update.
- Add %{name}-rpmlintrc file to suppress warnings about the
  presence of "__DATE__" and/or "__TIME__" in generated html files

  failures.
