  <title>A computer algebra system for solving problems in field theory</title>
  <description>Cadabra2 is a computer algebra system (CAS) designed specifically for
the solution of problems encountered in field theory. It has extensive
functionality for tensor computer algebra, tensor polynomial
simplification including multi-term symmetries, fermions and
anti-commuting variables, Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations,
implicit coordinate dependence, multiple index types and many more.
The input format is a subset of TeX. Both a command-line and a
graphical interface are available.

Key features of Cadabra2:
- Input and output using TeX notation.
- Designed for field-theory problems, with handling of anti-commuting
  and non-commuting objects without special notations for their
  products, gamma matrix algebra, Fierz identities, Dirac conjugation,
  vielbeine, flat and curved, covariant and contravariant indices,
  implicit dependence of tensors on coordinates, partial and covariant
  derivatives...
- Powerful tensor simplification algorithms, not just for mono-term
  symmetries but also for multi-terms symmetries like the Bianchi
  identity, or dimensionally-dependent symmetries like the Schouten
  identity.
