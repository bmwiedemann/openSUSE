  <description>
    <p>Cadabra2 is a computer algebra system (CAS) designed specifically for
the solution of problems encountered in field theory.</p>
    <p>It has been designed specifically for the solution of problems encountered
in quantum and classical field theory. It has extensive functionality
for tensor computer algebra, tensor polynomial simplification
including multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting
variables, Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit
coordinate dependence, multiple index types and many more. The input
format is a subset of TeX.</p>
