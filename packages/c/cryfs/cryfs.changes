Fri Oct 14 06:39:06 UTC 2022 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Update to v0.11.3:
  * Fixed build issue on systems with libfmt 9.0
  * Fixed build issue on Apple Silicon Macs
  * Fixed build issue on systems that only have python3 but no
    python executable
- Use python3-base instead of python for building
- Use %autosetup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  1 18:27:13 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- add upstream signing key and verify source signature

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 22 07:15:07 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to v0.11.2:
  * Time to mount a file system was very long because the build
    didn't correctly use OpenMP. This is now fixed and file systems
    should open faster again.
  * Fix building of the range-v3 dependency. The conan remote URL
    for this dependency changed and we have to use the new URL.
  * Update to CryptoPP 8.6. This fixes a rare bug where
    CryptoPP 8.5 encrypts data wrongly.
  * cryfs-unmount correctly unmounts paths that contain spaces.
  * Updated to DokanY 1.2.2.1001.

- Update to upstream version 0.11.0
  * Backwards Compatibility:
    - Filesystems created with CryFS 0.10.x can be mounted without
      requiring a migration.
    - Filesystems created with CryFS 0.11.x can be mounted by CryFS
      0.10.x if you configure it to use a cipher supported by CryFS
      0.10.x, e.g. AES-256-GCM. The new default, XChaCha20-Poly1305,
      is not supported by CryFS 0.10.x.

  * Security:
    - Added the XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption cipher. For new
      filesystems, this will be the default, but you're still able
      to create a filesystem with the previous default of AES-256-GCM
      by saying "no" to the "use default settings?" question when
      creating the file system. Also, old filesystems will not be
      automatically converted and will keep using AES-256-GCM.
      XChaCha20-Poly1305 is significantly slower than AES-256-GCM
      on modern CPUs, but it is more secure for large filesystems
      (>64GB).
      For AES-256-GCM, it is recommended to encrypt at most 2^32
      blocks, which at the CryFS default block size of 16KB would
      be 64GB. The more the filesystem grows above that, the more
      likely it gets that a nonce gets reused and the two
      corresponding blocks become decryptable by an adversary.
      Other blocks would not be affected, but an adversary being
      able to access those two blocks (i.e. 64KB of the stored data)
      is bad enough. See Section 8.3 in 
      https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf
      XChaCha20-Poly1305 does not suffer from this constraint and
      stays secure even if the filesystem gets very large.

  * New platforms:
    - CryFS now works on devices with Apple M1 silicon

  * Build changes:
    - Switch to Conan package manager
    - Allow an easy way to modify how the dependencies are found.
      This is mostly helpful for package maintainers. See "Using
      local dependencies" in the README.
    - Build with macFUSE instead of osxfuse on OSX
    - Now requires CMake 3.10 or later, and GCC 7 or later,
      or Clang 7 or later
    - Fix a build issue on Gentoo systems
    - Fix a build issue when building with boost 1.77

  * Improvements:
    - Display the file system configuration when mounting a file system
    - Now shows a better error message when failing to load the config
      file that distinguishes between "wrong password" and "config file
      not found".

  * New features:
    - Add support for atime mount options (noatime, strictatime,
      relatime, atime, nodiratime).
    - The new default is now noatime (in 0.10.x is was relatime).
      Noatime reduces the amount of writes necessary and with that
      reduces the probability of synchronization conflicts, and the
      probability of corrupted file systems if a power outage
      happens while writing.
    - Add an --immediate flag to cryfs-unmount that tries to unmount
      immediately and doesn't wait for processes to release their
      locks on the file system.
    - Add a --create-missing-basedir and --create-missing-mountpoint
      flag to create the base directory and mount directory respectively, 
      if they don't exist, skipping the confirmation prompt.

  * Other:
    - Updated to spdlog 1.8.5
    - Updated to ranges-v3 0.11.0
    - Updated to boost 1.75
    - Updated to crypto++ 8.5

  * Clean up spec file

- Update to upstream version 0.10.0, selected changes are:
  * Integrity checks ensure you notice when someone modifies your file system.
  * File system nodes (files, directories, symlinks) store a parent 
    pointer to the directory that contains them. This information can 
    be used in later versions to resolve some synchronization conflicts.
  * Allow mounting using system mount tool and /etc/fstab
  * Performance improvements
  * Use relatime instead of strictatime (further performance improvement)
  * cryfs-unmount tool to unmount filesystems-
