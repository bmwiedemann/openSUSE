  <title>RGB Driver for Linux</title>
  <description>ckb-next is an open-source driver for Corsair keyboards and mice. It aims to bring
the features of their proprietary CUE software to the Linux operating system.
This project is currently a work in progress, but it already supports
much of the same functionality, including full RGB animations.
