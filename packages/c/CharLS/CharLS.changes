- Update to version 2.2.0:
  * Added
    - Added pkg-config charls.pc file to help in detect the CharLS
      library (see #76)
    - Added standard CMake variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS as an option
      to make it visible in the CMake GUI (see #66)
    - The PowerPC Little Endian (ppc64le) platform has been added
      as supported architecture
  * Fixed
    - Fixed #21, Building with UBSAN, will report runtime error:
      left shift of 4031 by 63 places cannot be represented in type
      'long int'
    - Fixed #25, CharLS fails to read LSE marker segment after
      first SOS segment
    - Fixed #26, CharLS should only use the valid bits from the
      passed input buffer
    - Fixed #36, CharLS should remain stable from bad input
      (several issues found by fuzzy testing)
    - Fixed #60, Visual Studio 2015 C++ compiler cannot compile
      certain constexpr constructions
    - Fixed #62, Missing includes in jpegls_error.cpp when using
      libc++ (and not libstdc++)
    - Fixed #70, The C and C++ sample don't swap the pixels from a
      .bmp file horizontal
    - Fixed #79, Wrong JPEG-LS encoding when stride is non-default
      (stride != 0), component count > 1 and interleave_mode is none
  * Changed
    - The API has been extended with additional annotations to
      assist the static analyzer in the MSVC and GCC/clang
      compilers
    - The size check for a Start Of Scan (SOS) segment is now exact
      for improved compatibility with fuzzy testing
    - The minimum support version of CMake is now 3.13 (was 3.9),
      3.13 is needed for add_link_options
    - The Windows static library and DLL are now compiled with the
      Control Flow Guard (/guard:cf) option enabled for enhanced
      security
    - The .NET adapter has been upgraded to .NET 5 and moved to its
      own repository This has been done to make it possible to have
      different release cycles.
  * Removed
    - The legacy methods JpegLsEncodeStream, JpegLsDecodeStream and
      JpegLsReadHeaderStream have been removed as exported methods.
      These methods were not part of the public API and only used
      by by the charlstest application
- Added pkgconfig build requires.

- Update to version 2.1.0. 
  * Added
    * Two new C++ classes (jpegls_encoder \ jpegls_decoder) have 
      been added to make it much easier to use CharLS from C++
    * A new C API (charls_xxx functions) was added to provide a 
      more stable ABI for future updates. The old API calls are 
      internally forwarded to the new API.
    * CharLS can now read and write JPEG-LS standard SPIFF headers
    * Support has been added to detect the unsupported JPEG-LS 
      extension (ISO/IEC 14495-2) SOF_57 marker and IDs in LSE 
      marker
    * Support has been added to encode\decode 4 component images 
      in all interleave modes
  * Deprecated
    * The legacy 1.x\2.0 C API has been marked as deprecated. This 
      legacy API will be maintained until the next major upgrade.
    * Future 2.x updates will start to mark the legacy types and 
      functions with the C++ [[deprecated]] attribute.
  * Changed
    * charls_error has been replaced by a C++11 compatible 
      jpegls_errc error code enum design
    * The included C and C++ sample have been updated to use the 
      new C\C++ API
    * Improved the validation of the JPEG-LS stream during 
      decoding
    * The referenced NuGet packages of the .NET wrapper assembly 
      are updated to their latest versions
  * Removed
    * Support to write JFIF headers during encoding has been 
      removed. JFIF headers were already skipped when present 
      during decoding.
    * SPIFF headers should be used when creating standalone .jls 
      files
    * Support for .NET Code Contracts has been removed as this 
      technology is being phased out by Microsoft
  * Fixed
    * Fixed #7, How to compile CharLS with Xcode has been 
      documented in the Wiki
    * Fixed #44, Only the API functions should be exported from a 
      Linux shared library
    * Fixes #35, Encoding will fail if the bit per sample is 
      greater than 8, and a custom RESET value is used
    * Fixes #51, The default threshold values are not corrected 
      computed for 6 bit images or less
    * Fixed the ASSERT in the ModuloRange function, which would 
      trigger false assertions in debug builds

Thu Jul  6 22:21:26 UTC 2017 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.0.0:
  Bug fixes
   * #10 - Fixed the problem that "output buffer to small" was not
     detected when writting encoded bytes to a fixed output buffer.
     This could cause memory corruption problems.
   * #11 - Update charlstest to return EXIT_SUCCESS/FAILURE
   * Fixed the issue that DecodeToPnm would set
     params.colorTransform = ColorTransformation::BigEndian but the
     library didnâ€™t support this option during decoding.
  Misc
   * Updated the source code to C++ v14.
   * Refactored several API's to make usage of the library easier.
- Removed unzip build requirement (not needed anymore).
- Require gcc >= 5.0 (for C++ v14).
- Removed the following patches (not needed anymore):
  charls_add_cmake_install_target.patch
  charls_add_sharedlib_soname.patch
  charls_fix_tests.patch
