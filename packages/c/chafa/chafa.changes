- Update to 1.2.0:
  * Added --dither, --dither-grain and --dither-intensity options.
    These allow for sub-cell dithering in quantized modes (none,
    2, 16, 240 and 256). Especially beneficial when used with
    -p off.
  * Added API for ordered and diffusion-based dithering in quantization.
  * Added API support for multiple 8bpc pixel modes: RGB, BGR, RGBA,
    BGRA, ARGB, ABGR with either premultiplied or unassociated alpha channels.
  * Smooth scaling is now done internally, meaning libchafa
    consumers no longer need to prescale images.
  * Implemented a machine learning tool that can generate custom
    fonts for efficient image reproduction from a provided dataset.
    This is left uninstalled since it's still experimental
  * Throughput improvements: 
    + GIF animations now start playing instantly.
    + GIF CPU overhead reduced by 75%, peak memory use down 95%-99% (!).
    + XWD common case CPU overhead down 60-70%, peak memory down 70%.
    + Additional halving of CPU overhead in 240- and 256-color modes.
    + Streamlined pixel pipeline for better parallelization.
  * Installation instructions:
    + New: Guix (Guy Fleury Iteriteka).
    + New: openSUSE (@jubalh).
  * Bug fixes: 
    + [unfiled] Certain SVGs had transparency replaced with a white background (nemo).
    + [unfiled] -lm dependency belongs in libchafa, not frontend.
