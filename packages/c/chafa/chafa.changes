  * Add NOCONFIGURE variable to autogen.sh to skip configure
  Bug fixes:
  * #50 SIGBUS while loading huge GIFs
  * #52 Produces small glitches in output with some images
  * #54 Haiku port fails on 32bit
  * [unfiled] Exclude RTL code points that could break the output.
  * [unfiled] Apple Terminal lacks truecolor support, so make it
    default to 256 colors
  * [unfiled] Fix typo affecting middle dot symbol.

- Update to 1.6.0:
  * Added support for fullwidth symbols that take up two character
    cells. These are common in East Asian scripts. Single-cell and
    double-cell symbols can be mixed, and -f symbols mode will use
    both if possible.
  * New symbol tags: alpha, digit, alnum, narrow, wide, ambiguous,
    ugly, bad. "Ambiguous" symbols have uncertain widths and may
    render poorly in some terminals. "Ugly" denotes symbols that
    are unsuitable for Chafa's cell-based graphics (multicolor
    emoji, ideographic descriptors, etc). "Bad" is a superset of
    these two categories. Bad symbols are always excluded unless
    explicitly enabled with e.g. CHAFA_SYMBOL_TAG_BAD (--symbols
    +bad in the frontend).
  * The font loader (--glyph-file option) now does a better job
    with proportional fonts.
  * Added options for controlling lossless optimization of output.
    Currently, attribute reuse and character repetition (REP
    sequence) are implemented.
  * Added -O option to the frontend. This controls the optimization
    level.
  * Added a simple abstraction layer for terminal control sequences
    (ChafaTermInfo and ChafaTermDb). This allows for improved
    terminal support.
  * FbTerm is now supported with TERM=fbterm in the environment.
  * Bug fixes:
    - #43 Fix signal handler.
    - [unfiled] Crash when invalid font paths were passed on command line.
    - [unfiled] Small typo in fontgen's READM).
    - [unfiled] Bad contrast adjustment in images with transparency.

Sun Apr 12 21:17:36 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.4.1:
  * Added configure option --disable-rpath. This allows packagers to
    prevent the hard-coded library search path from being embedded in
    the chafa command-line tool (Mo Zhou, #39).
  * Added defaults for the yaft terminal.
  Bug fixes:
  * #40 - Fails to build on hurd-i386 + other i386 (reported by Mo
    Zhou).
  * [unfiled] - Rare failed assert with mostly transparent sixel image
      (reported by Reddit user spryfigure).
  * [unfiled] - Minor typo in function docstring.

- Update to 1.4.0:
  * Added sixel graphics support. Chafa will automatically produce sixels
    if the connected terminal supports it. It can also be forced using the
    new -f or --format flag. This is a new implementation written from the
    ground up to maximize throughput.
  * Added the --glyph-file option, which loads glyph-symbol mappings from
    any file format supported by FreeType (TTF, PCF, etc). This allows for
    custom font support and improved symbol selection.
  * Added the --speed option specifying animation speed. It accepts a
    unitless multiplier, a specific number of frames per second, or max
    for maximum throughput.
  * There are now two ways to assign colors to symbol cells. Formerly,
    this was done based on the average color of the covered area. The new
    default is to use the median color, which produces sharper edges,
    but is slightly more prone to high-frequency noise. The new option
    --color-extractor selects the method to employ.
  * When displaying multiple files, the default delay between files has
    been changed from three seconds to zero. Animations will still play
    through once. This can be overridden on the chafa command line with -d
    or --duration.
  * Minor tweaks to built-in symbols.
  Performance improvements:
  * Halved pixel storage requirements from 64 bits to 32 bits,
    resulting in significant memory savings.
  * Now builds with -ffast-math, yielding a big speedup for DIN99d.

- Update to 1.2.2:
 * Fix #34 Cannot compile example

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 24 06:28:14 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update descriptions.
- Avoid double-shipping documentation, and make docs noarch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 20 07:23:02 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.2.1:
  * Detect kitty and mlterm virtual terminals and apply optimal
    defaults accordingly
  * Make Automake build more strict and fix a few compatibility nits
  * Fix #30 - Failed to build on hurd-i386
  * Fix crash on certain broken GIFs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  5 07:10:33 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.2.0:
  * Added --dither, --dither-grain and --dither-intensity options.
    These allow for sub-cell dithering in quantized modes (none,
    2, 16, 240 and 256). Especially beneficial when used with
    -p off.
  * Added API for ordered and diffusion-based dithering in quantization.
  * Added API support for multiple 8bpc pixel modes: RGB, BGR, RGBA,
    BGRA, ARGB, ABGR with either premultiplied or unassociated alpha channels.
  * Smooth scaling is now done internally, meaning libchafa
    consumers no longer need to prescale images.
  * Implemented a machine learning tool that can generate custom
    fonts for efficient image reproduction from a provided dataset.
    This is left uninstalled since it's still experimental
  * Throughput improvements: 
    + GIF animations now start playing instantly.
    + GIF CPU overhead reduced by 75%, peak memory use down 95%-99% (!).
    + XWD common case CPU overhead down 60-70%, peak memory down 70%.
    + Additional halving of CPU overhead in 240- and 256-color modes.
    + Streamlined pixel pipeline for better parallelization.
  * Installation instructions:
    + New: Guix (Guy Fleury Iteriteka).
    + New: openSUSE (@jubalh).
  * Bug fixes: 
    + [unfiled] Certain SVGs had transparency replaced with a white background (nemo).
    + [unfiled] -lm dependency belongs in libchafa, not frontend.
