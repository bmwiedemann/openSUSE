    <comment>- Update to 1.4.0:
  * Added sixel graphics support. Chafa will automatically produce sixels
    if the connected terminal supports it. It can also be forced using the
    new -f or --format flag. This is a new implementation written from the
    ground up to maximize throughput.
  * Added the --glyph-file option, which loads glyph-symbol mappings from
    any file format supported by FreeType (TTF, PCF, etc). This allows for
    custom font support and improved symbol selection.
  * Added the --speed option specifying animation speed. It accepts a
    unitless multiplier, a specific number of frames per second, or max
    for maximum throughput.
  * There are now two ways to assign colors to symbol cells. Formerly,
    this was done based on the average color of the covered area. The new
    default is to use the median color, which produces sharper edges,
    but is slightly more prone to high-frequency noise. The new option
    --color-extractor selects the method to employ.
  * When displaying multiple files, the default delay between files has
    been changed from three seconds to zero. Animations will still play
    through once. This can be overridden on the chafa command line with -d
    or --duration.
  * Minor tweaks to built-in symbols.
  Performance improvements:
  * Halved pixel storage requirements from 64 bits to 32 bits,
    resulting in significant memory savings.
  * Now builds with -ffast-math, yielding a big speedup for DIN99d.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.4.1:
  * Added configure option --disable-rpath. This allows packagers to
    prevent the hard-coded library search path from being embedded in
    the chafa command-line tool (Mo Zhou, #39).
  * Added defaults for the yaft terminal.
  Bug fixes:
  * #40 - Fails to build on hurd-i386 + other i386 (reported by Mo
    Zhou).
  * [unfiled] - Rare failed assert with mostly transparent sixel image
      (reported by Reddit user spryfigure).
  * [unfiled] - Minor typo in function docstring.</comment>

    <version>1.6.0</version>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.6.0:
  * Added support for fullwidth symbols that take up two character
    cells. These are common in East Asian scripts. Single-cell and
    double-cell symbols can be mixed, and -f symbols mode will use
    both if possible.
  * New symbol tags: alpha, digit, alnum, narrow, wide, ambiguous,
    ugly, bad. &quot;Ambiguous&quot; symbols have uncertain widths and may
    render poorly in some terminals. &quot;Ugly&quot; denotes symbols that
    are unsuitable for Chafa's cell-based graphics (multicolor
    emoji, ideographic descriptors, etc). &quot;Bad&quot; is a superset of
    these two categories. Bad symbols are always excluded unless
    explicitly enabled with e.g. CHAFA_SYMBOL_TAG_BAD (--symbols
    +bad in the frontend).
  * The font loader (--glyph-file option) now does a better job
    with proportional fonts.
  * Added options for controlling lossless optimization of output.
    Currently, attribute reuse and character repetition (REP
    sequence) are implemented.
  * Added -O option to the frontend. This controls the optimization
    level.
  * Added a simple abstraction layer for terminal control sequences
    (ChafaTermInfo and ChafaTermDb). This allows for improved
    terminal support.
  * FbTerm is now supported with TERM=fbterm in the environment.
  * Bug fixes:
    - #43 Fix signal handler.
    - [unfiled] Crash when invalid font paths were passed on command line.
    - [unfiled] Small typo in fontgen's READM).
    - [unfiled] Bad contrast adjustment in images with transparency.</comment>
