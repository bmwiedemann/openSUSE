- Update CCfits-cmake-install-pkgconfig.patch with patch received
  from upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 22 16:43:10 UTC 2025 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.7:
  * New function HDU::addKeyNull() for creating keywords with null
    values (ie. CFITSIO's fits_write_key_null() functionality).
    Existing keywords with null values can now also be modified.
- Build using cmake.
- Run tests in the %check section.
- Add CCfits-cmake-install-pkgconfig.patch: configure and install
  pkgconfig file when using cmake for build; patch emailed
  upstream since no proper upstream issue tracker exists.
- Drop patches no longer needed (due to switching to cmake):
  * CCfits-2.5-removerpath.patch
  * cfitsio-path.patch

- Update to version 2.6:
  See included CHANGES file for details.

Wed Jan 20 09:03:53 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Add cfitsio-path.patch: this patch fixes an import error that prevents
  a successfull compilation, because it's currently importing headers
  from a non-existing location
- Add CCfits-2.5-removerpath.patch: this patch removes rpath in the
  shared library compile instruction

- Update to version 2.5:
  * As part of an effort to allow tables to hold multiple columns
    with the same name (see "Enhancements" section), the Table
    class now stores Column objects in an internal multimap
    rather than a map. This affects the public interface in 2
    places: the ExtHDU::column() and Table::column() accessor
    functions. These used to return a std::map reference, but now
    return a std::multimap (using new typedef 'ColMap' defined in
    CCfits.h).
  * Removed the ImageExt<T>::image() accessor function from the
    public interface. This was only ever intended for internal use.
  * Enhancements:
    - Added scripts for building with the CMake system, primarily
      intended for builds on Windows platforms.
    - New functions: ExtHDU::copyColumn, HDU::readNextKey,
      HDU::resetImageRead, and a new Column::read overload for
      returning a single row into a std::vector.
    - Keyword reads can now convert numerical types into strings.
    - Added support for variable-width string columns (with new
      ValueType enum = VTstring).
    - Image write functions are now allowed to dynamically
      increase the size of the outer dimension as needed. The
      corresponding NAXIS keyword will be updated automatically.
    - Tables can now handle having multiple columns with the same
      column name. (Also see "Backwards Compatibility" section.)
    - Added support for read/write of LONGLONG types for images.
    - Added handling of 'D' exponent notation when reading keyword
      values with floating-point types.
  * Bug Fixes:
    - Improved memory caching when reading images, reducing the
      number of unnecessary disk reads.
    - Removed header inclusion of config.h due to potential
      conflicts with users' customized autotools config.h files.
    - HDU's '<<' output operator was not showing output for the
      highest numbered axis.
    - Removed unused NewColumn.h code file.
    - Fixed memory leak in internal Column::setLimits function.
    - Added #include statements to various files, the absence of
      which was causing compilation failures on recent Windows
      Visual Studio builds.
    - Added missing 'break' statement for Tlonglong case in
      internal FITSType2String function.
    - Replaced a valarray operation in ColumnVectorData.h file
      which caused a compiler glitch on certain Mac platforms.
      (This was previously released as a patch.)
    - Fix made to HDU's getHistory and getComments internal search
      algorithm.
    - Fix to FITS::addTable function for case where new table
      shares its name with a pre-existing HDU but has a different
      version number.
    - Fix to memory management for certain Column write
      operations.
