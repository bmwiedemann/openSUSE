- Update to release 0.4.2
  * When ECPP certificates are output to a file, a second file in
    Primo format is created automatically.
  * ECPP certificate creation uses class field towers
    unconditionally.
  * An optional primality test is carried out before starting ECPP.
  * For larger numbers, the BPSW primality test of GMP is replaced
    by a Miller-Rabin test to base 2.
  * New command line options make it possible to compute only the
    first or only the second phase.
  * Phase 2 results are stored in any order as they come in, which
    requires the file format to change. Checkpoint files ending in
    .cert2 from previous releases are not compatible.
  * Add an optional dependency on FLINT to speed up root finding
    in the second ECPP phase.

- Update to release 0.4.0
  * Add a decomposition of the class field into a tower of prime

    algorithm, complete with a version running over MPI.
