  <title>Boot server configurator</title>
  <description>Cobbler is a network install server.  Cobbler 
supports PXE, virtualized installs, and 
reinstalling existing Linux machines.  The last two 
modes use a helper tool, 'koan', that 
integrates with cobbler.  There is also a web interface
'cobbler-web'.  Cobbler's advanced features 
include importing distributions from DVDs and rsync 
mirrors, kickstart templating, integrated yum 
mirroring, and built-in DHCP/DNS Management.  Cobbler has 
a XMLRPC API for integration with other applications.</description>
