    includedir in suoders can be prefixed by "arroba"
    
    Since version 1.9.1, @includedir can be used in the sudoers files
    instead of #includedir:
    
    https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/releases/tag/SUDO_1_9_1
    
    This happens to be the default in SUSE Linux enterprise sudoer package,
    so cloudinit should take this into account.
    
    Otherwise, cloudinit was adding an extra #includedir, which was
    resulting on the files under /etc/sudoers.d being included twice, one by
    @includedir from the SUSE package, one by the @includedir from
    cloudinit. The consequence of this, was that if you were defining an
    Cmnd_Alias inside any of those files, this was being defined twice and
    creating an error when using sudo.
