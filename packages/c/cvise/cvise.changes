- Come up with initial version 1.0.0:

  This is an initial project release as announced here:
  http://www.flux.utah.edu/listarchives/creduce-dev/msg00475.html

  Features and limitations:

  1) C-Vise is a super-parallel implementation where all passes run their transform and test script
  phase in parallel; that resolves csmith-project/creduce#160; I've seen significant speed up on a 16-core Zen CPU
  2) the project contains native BinaryState object which can help with fast traversal of a state space
  3) Python is hopefully more popular language than Perl

  Minor improvements:

  --log-level option - one can print different level of messages
  --remove-pass - one can skip a pass in pass manager (csmith-project/creduce#200, csmith-project/creduce#202)
  --list-passes - listing of existing passes (csmith-project/creduce#150)
  project contains unit tests for some passes
  LLVM 9 and 10 support (csmith-project/creduce#193, csmith-project/creduce#204)
  --clang-delta-std option - workaround for csmith-project/creduce#210
  unifdef and delta subprojects are removed from the repository
  --timing-since-start - print timestamps since the start of a reduction
  Known limitations:

  configure & make build support is dropped
  FreeBSD and Windows port is not tested
  dependency on python-Pebble package
  a small issue observed in Pebble (noxdafox/pebble#58)
