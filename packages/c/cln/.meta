<package name="cln" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Class Library for Numbers (C++)</title>
  <description>CLN features a rich set of number classes: integer (unlimited
precision), rational, short float, single float, double float, long
float (unlimited precision), complex, modular integer, and univariate
polynomial.  It implements elementary, logical, and transcendental
functions.  C++ as the implementation language brings efficiency, type
safety, and algebraic syntax.  Memory efficiency: small integers and
short floats are immediate, not heap allocated. Automatic,
noninterruptive garbage collection.  Speed efficiency: assembly
language kernel for some CPUs, Karatsuba and Schoenhage-Strassen
multiplication.  Interoperability: garbage collection with no burden on
the main application, hooks for memory allocation and exceptions.

The following C++ features are used: classes, member functions,
overloading of functions and operators, constructors and destructors,
inline, const, multiple inheritance, templates, and namespaces.  The
following C++ features are not used: new, delete, virtual inheritance,
and exceptions.</description>
