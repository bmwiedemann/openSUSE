%description
Contains the command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel, a tunneling daemon that
proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins. This daemon sits
between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a webserver). Cloudflare
attracts client requests and sends them to you via this daemon, without
requiring you to poke holes on your firewall --- your origin can remain as
closed as possible. Extensive documentation can be found in the Cloudflare
Tunnel section of the Cloudflare Docs. All usages related with proxying to your
origins are available under cloudflared tunnel help.
