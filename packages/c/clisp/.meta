  <title>A Common Lisp Interpreter</title>
  <description>Common Lisp is a high-level, all-purpose programming language. CLISP is
an implementation of Common Lisp that closely follows the book &quot;Common
Lisp - The Language&quot; by Guy L. Steele Jr. This package includes an
interactive programming environment with an interpreter, a compiler,
and a debugger.  Start this environment with the command 'clisp'.

CLISP documentation is placed in the following directories:

/usr/share/doc/packages/clisp/

/usr/share/doc/packages/clisp/doc/

As well as the conventional CLISP, this package also includes CLX, an
extension of CLISP for the X Window System. The X Window System must be
installed before running the clx command. The description of this CLX
version (new-clx) is placed in

/usr/share/doc/packages/clisp/clx/

with the file README. The subdirectory

/usr/share/doc/packages/clisp/clx/demos/

contains two nice applications.</description>
