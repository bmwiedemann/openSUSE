  <title>Cargo Vendor with filter capabilities!</title>
  <description>The core cargo vendor tool is useful to save all dependencies. However, it doesn't offer any filtering; today cargo includes all platforms, but some projects only care about Linux for example.

This tool solves that by extending the core functionality of cargo vendor with filtering for platforms and more!</description>
