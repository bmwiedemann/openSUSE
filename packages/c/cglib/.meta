  <title>Code Generation Library</title>
  <description>cglib is a powerful, high performance and quality Code Generation
Library, It is used to extend JAVA classes and implements interfaces at
runtime.

NOTE: To use the Aspectwerks hook (net.sf.cglib.transform.hook.*), make
sure aspectwerks.jar is in the Classpath (from the 'aspectwerks' RPM)
NOTE: If you use the cglib.jar you may need to add asm.jar to your
ClassPath (from the 'asm' RPM).  The cglib-nodep.jar includes the ASM
classes already.</description>
