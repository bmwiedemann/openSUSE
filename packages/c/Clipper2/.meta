  <description>The Clipper2 library performs intersection, union, difference and XOR boolean
operations on both simple and complex polygons. It also performs polygon
offsetting. This is a major update of my original Clipper library that was
written over 10 years ago. That library I'm now calling Clipper1, and while it
still works very well, Clipper2 is better in just about every way.</description>
