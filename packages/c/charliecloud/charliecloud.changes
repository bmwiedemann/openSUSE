- Update to version 0.19. Two particularly notable changes:
  - ch-grow now supports multi-stage build (#768), which as always 
    is fully unprivileged. This represents a big step forward in 
    functionality.
  - ch-grow now has subcommands; what used to be plain ch-grow 
    is now ch-grow build, and ch-tug has become ch-grow pull.
  - miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements
  - Full changelog at https://groups.io/g/charliecloud/message/106
- Update patch
 * Replace-hardcode-path.patch

- Update to version 0.18
  - Fixes an important symlink handling bug in ch-tug and ch-grow.
    Prior to version 0.18, if a pulled image contained a symlink in one 
    layer and then a regular file at the same path in a subsequent layer, 
    the *target* of the symlink would be overwritten even if it was 
    not within the image; i.e., unpacking inappropriately followed 
    the symlink. This allows a crafted image to overwrite any file 
    writeable by the invoking user.
    Because Charliecloud is unprivileged, other files on the system, 
    e.g. system files, are unaffected.
  - ch-grow: --version and --help work w/o dependencies installed 
    new switch --list to list images
    now gives diagnostics for syntax errors and unsupported instructions
    WORKDIR now supports relative paths (#786)
    no longer crashes if input doesn’t end in newline (#474)
