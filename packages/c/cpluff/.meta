  <title>A plug-in framework for C</title>
  <description>C-Pluff is a plug-in framework for C programs. It has been strongly inspired by
the Java plug-in framework in Eclipse. C-Pluff focuses on providing core
services for plug-in interaction and plug-in management. It aims to be platform
neutral and supports dynamic changes to plug-in configuration without stopping
the whole application or framework.
