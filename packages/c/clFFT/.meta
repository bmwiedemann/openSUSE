  <title>OpenCL FFT library</title>
  <description>The clFFT library is an open source OpenCL library implementation of discrete
Fast Fourier Transforms, which:
  * Provides a fast and accurate platform for calculating discrete FFTs.
  * Works on CPU or GPU backends.
  * Supports in-place or out-of-place transforms.
  * Supports 1D, 2D, and 3D transforms with a batch size that can be greater
    than 1.
  * Supports planar (real and complex components in separate arrays) and
    interleaved (real and complex components as a pair contiguous in memory)
    formats.
  * Supports dimension lengths that can be any mix of powers of 2, 3, and 5.
  * Supports single and double precision floating point formats.
