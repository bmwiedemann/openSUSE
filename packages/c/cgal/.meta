  <title>Computational Geometry Algorithms Library</title>
  <description>Libraries for CGAL applications.
CGAL is a collaborative effort of several sites in Europe and
Israel. The goal is to make the most important of the solutions and
methods developed in computational geometry available to users in
industry and academia in a C++ library. The goal is to provide easy
access to useful, reliable geometric algorithms.
