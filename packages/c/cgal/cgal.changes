- Update to 5.5.1
  * bug fix release compared to 5.5.0
  * https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/pulls?q=label%3AMerged_in_5.4.3+-label%3AMerged_in_5.4.2
- Release 5.5.0
  * The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release
    5.5 of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.
  ## 3D Alpha Wrapping (new package)
  * This component takes a 3D triangle mesh, soup, or point set as
    input, and generates a valid (watertight, intersection-free,
    and combinatorially 2-manifold) surface triangle mesh that
    contains the input. The algorithm proceeds by shrink-wrapping
    and refining a 3D Delaunay triangulation, starting from a loose
    bounding box of the input. Two user-defined parameters, alpha
    and offset, offer control over the maximum size of cavities
    where the shrink-wrapping process can enter, and the tightness
    of the final surface mesh to the input, respectively. Once
    combined, these parameters provide a means to trade fidelity to
    the input for complexity of the output.
  * See also the announcement page.
    https://www.cgal.org/2022/05/18/alpha_wrap/
  ## 2D Straight Skeleton and Polygon Offsetting (breaking change)
  * Fix the output of the function
    CGAL::create_exterior_skeleton_and_offset_polygons_with_holes_2()
    to not take into account the offset of the outer frame.
  * Fix the computation of the exterior offset of a polygon with
    holes that was not computing the offset of the holes
  ## 3D Convex Hulls
  * Added an overload of the function CGAL::convex_hull_3(), which
    writes the result in an indexed triangle set.
  ## 2D Polygons
  * Add vertex, edge, and hole ranges.
  * The concept GeneralPolygonWithHoles_2 now requires the nested
    type Polygon_2 instead of General_polygon_2.
  ## 2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations
  * The concept GeneralPolygonSetTraits_2 now requires the nested
    type Construct_polygon_with_holes_2 instead of
    Construct_general_polygon_with_holes_2.
  ## Combinatorial Maps
  * Removed old code deprecated in CGAL 4.9 and 4.10 (global
    functions, and information associated with darts).
  ## 2D Arrangements
  * Fixed the intersect_2, compare_y_at_x_right, and
    compare_y_at_x_left function objects of the traits class
    template Arr_geodesic_arc_on_sphere_traits_2 that handles
    geodesic arcs on sphere and applied a small syntactical fix to
    the tracing traits.
  ## Tetrahedral Mesh Generation
  * Added the function remove_isolated_vertices() as a
    post-processing step for the tetrahedral mesh generation.
  ## Polygon Mesh Processing
  * Added the function
    CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::orient_triangle_soup_with_reference_triangle_soup(),
    which enables re-orienting the faces of a triangle soup based
    on the orientation of the nearest face in a   reference
    triangle soup.
  * Added the function
    CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::compatible_orientations(), which
    enables to retrieve the (in)compatibility of orientations of
    faces from different connected components.
  * Added the function
    CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::tangential_relaxation(), which
    applies an area-based tangential mesh smoothing to the vertices
    of a surface triangle mesh.
  * Added the named parameter visitor to the function
    triangulate_hole(), which enables to track progress with
    callbacks.
  * Added more functions in the visitor of the corefinement based
    methods to track progress.
  ## Surface Mesh Simplification
  * Introduced four variations of the Garland-Heckbert
    simplification algorithm based on the probabilistic approach of
    Trettner and Kobbelt (Fast and Robust QEF Minimization using
    Probabilistic Quadrics):   GarlandHeckbert_plane_policies,
    GarlandHeckbert_probabilistic_plane_policies,
    GarlandHeckbert_triangle_policies, and
    GarlandHeckbert_probabilistic_triangle_policies.
  * The class GarlandHeckbert_policies has been deprecated,
    GarlandHeckbert_plane_policies replaces it.
  ## Point Set Processing
  * A new optional named parameter, min_points_per_cell has been
    added to grid_simplify_point_set(). By adding a minimal number
    of points in a cell such that a point is retained, one can also
    filter out low   density areas and outliers: in the case of
    densely sampled point clouds, this yields better results than
    using grid simplification and then outlier removal, while being
    very vast. The default value is 1 to   keep the previous
    behavior as default.
  ## dD Spatial Searching
  * Added the member function write_graphviz() to the class Kd_tree
    that writes the tree in a stream in the Graphviz format.
  ## CGAL and the Boost Graph Library (BGL)
  * Added the function invert_selection() in the class
    Face_filtered_graph, which toggles the selected status of a
    graph: selected faces are deselected, and unselected faces are
    selected.

- Update to 5.4:
  See https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/tag/v5.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 18 14:40:52 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 5.3:
  General changes:
  * The support for the compiled version of CGAL is dropped.
    Only the header-only version is supported.
  Quadtrees, Octrees, and Orthtrees (new package):
  * This package implements a tree data structure in which each
    node encloses a hypercubic section of space and each non-leave
    node has hypercubic children whose edge lengths are half its
    edge length.  Such a data structure is known as a quadtree in 2D,
    an octree in 3D, and is generalized as an "orthtree" in higher dimensions.
  Triangulations on the Sphere (new package):
  * This package enables the construction and manipulation of Delaunay
    triangulations on the 2-sphere.  Triangulations are built incrementally
    and can be modified by insertion or removal of vertices.  Point location
    querying and primitives to build the dual Voronoi diagram are provided.
  File Input / Output:
  * Point set, polygon soup, and polygon mesh file I/O functions have been
    harmonized and documented:
  * Point set I/O functions can be found in the packages Point_set_processing_3,
    and Point_set_3.
  * Polygon mesh I/O functions can be found in the package BGL.
  * Polygon soup I/O can be found in the package Stream_support.
  * A comprehensive list of the supported file formats is available in the
    Stream_support package here; inversely, the following page can be used to
    find out which CGAL data structures can be used given a specific file format.
  2D and 3D Linear Geometry Kernel:
  * Added is_translation(), is_scaling(), is_reflection(), and is_rotation()
    to the classes Aff_transformation_2 and Aff_transformation_3, which enable
    determining if the transformations use a specialized representation internally.
  2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations:
  * Added documentation for the free functions oriented_side(const Point_2& p, ....)
    that accept a point and a polygon.
  * Documentation has been improved across the whole package.
  Polygon Mesh Processing:
  * Added the class CGAL::Polyhedral_envelope,
    providing a way to quickly check if a primitive (point, segment, or triangle)
    is within a polyhedral envelope around a set of triangles. It is based on the work of
    Bolun Wang, Teseo Schneider, Yixin Hu, Marco Attene, and Daniele Panozzo.
    "Exact and efficient polyhedral envelope containment check." (ACM Trans. Graph., 39-4, July 2020).
  * Added more functions in the visitor of the corefinement based methods
    to track all edge creations.
  Surface Mesh Topology:
  * Added the function CGAL::Surface_mesh_topology::Curves_on_surface_topology::
    is_homotopic_to_simple_cycle(), which can be used to determine whehter
    a closed path on a surface mesh can be continously
    transformed to a cycle without self intersection.
  Surface Mesh Simplification:
  * Added a filtering mechanism so that costly tests get only applied to the
    next candidate for the edge collapse.
  * Added the class Polyhedral_envelope_filter, which enables to perform
    mesh simplification inside a polyhedral envelope of the input mesh.
  2D Polyline Simplification:
  * When polylines have common subsequences of vertices, these subsequences
    may now be simplifified simultaneously.
  dD Triangulations:
  * Added the function insert_if_in_star() to the class
    CGAL::Regular_triangulation, which enables users to insert a point p
    in a regular triangulation on the condition that p appears post-insertion
    in the star of a user-specified, existing vertex.
  2D and 3D Alpha Shapes:
  * Breaking change: The following deprecated classes have been removed:
    Alpha_shape_euclidean_traits_2, Weighted_alpha_shape_euclidean_traits_2,
    Alpha_shape_euclidean_traits_3, and Weighted_alpha_shape_euclidean_traits_3.
    All CGAL kernel can be used directly as models of the concepts of the
    2D and 3D Alpha Shape packages.
  Classification:
  * Breaking change: the support for TensorFlow has been dropped; the
    classifier CGAL::TensorFlow::Neural_network_classifier has been removed.
