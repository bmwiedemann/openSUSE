    partitioning;
  - double-click as a way to edit a partition in the manual 
    partitioning view;
  - improved check for internet connection availability;
  - improved package manager handling, so a package operation which
    fails for a single package won’t block other packages;
  - various minor fixes.
  Upstream changes between Calamares 3.0.0 and 3.0.1:
  - fix for an issue in the users module, which could break login 
    if the chosen password had non-Latin1 characters;

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    private;

    not be written to GlobalStorage;
  - added support for building the partition module with both 
    KPMcore 2.2 and 3.0;
  - fixed a crash on startup in the webview module (if built with 
    QtWebEngine);

    cause the legacy bootloader to be installed on the wrong disk;
  - fixed an issue in the users module to correctly disable the 
    root password if configured to do so;

    firmware);
  - fixed operating system detection for automatic dual boot setup 
    in GRUB;
  - added Btrfs subvolumes setup for @ and @home in automated 
    install modes (note: manual partitioning still doesn’t support 
    Btrfs subvolumes, as this requires further work in both KPMcore
    and Calamares);
  - fixed a security issue which could happen when using manual 
    partitioning to set up a system with an encrypted root 
    partition, but with an unencrypted separate /boot partition.
