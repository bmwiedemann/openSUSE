  <title>A Backup and Archiving Utility</title>
  <description>GNU cpio is a program to manage archives of files. This package also
includes 'mt', a tape drive control program. Cpio copies files into or
out of a cpio or tar archive. An archive is a file that contains other
files plus information about them, such as their pathname, owner, time
stamps, and access permissions. The archive can be another file on the
disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe. This package normally includes the
program 'rmt', which provides remote tape drive control. Because there
is a compatible 'rmt' in the 'dump' package, 'rmt' is not included in
this package. If you are planning to use the remote tape features
provided by cpio, install the 'dump' package as well.</description>
