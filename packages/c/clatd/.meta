  <title>CLAT / SIIT-DC Edge Relay implementation for Linux</title>
  <description>clatd implements the CLAT component of the 464XLAT network architecture
specified in RFC 6877. It allows an IPv6-only host to have IPv4
connectivity that is translated to IPv6 before being routed to an upstream
PLAT (which is typically a Stateful NAT64 operated by the ISP) and there
translated back to IPv4 before being routed to the IPv4 internet.
