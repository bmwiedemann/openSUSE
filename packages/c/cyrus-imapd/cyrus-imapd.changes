  * Fixed Issue #3123: XFER now recognises 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 backends
  * Fixed: XFER now syslogs a warning when it doesn’t recognise the
    backend Cyrus version

- update to version 2.5.15
  * Fixed CVE-2019-19783: When creating a missing mailbox as part of
    a sieve ‘fileinto’ directive, lmtpd would create it as administrator,
    bypassing ACL checks. lmtpd creates missing mailboxes as part of
    a sieve ‘fileinto’ directive if:
    * (2.5+) the anysievefolder option is enabled (default: not), or
    * (3.0+) the sieve_extensions option has the ‘mailbox’ extension
      enabled (default: enabled) and the ‘fileinto’ directive contains
      the ”:create” argument
    Under these conditions, a user with the ability to upload a custom
    sieve script to their account could use it to create any valid
    mailbox on the server (with ACL inherited from the parent mailbox
    as usual). lmtpd no longer creates these mailboxes as administrator,
    so users may no longer use a ‘fileinto’ directive to create a mailbox
    they couldn’t create otherwise.

    maxlogins_per_user, and popminpoll limits are reached (thanks Sergey)

Tue Dec  1 21:30:16 UTC 2009 - rbos@opensuse.org

- Changed capitalization of perl-Cyrus-Imap into perl-Cyrus-IMAP
  as it used to be.  It changed in 1 of the previous updates, due
  to a typo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 30 08:11:12 UTC 2009 - rbos@opensuse.org

- Subpackages are now also renamed when cyrus is build with kolab
  support 
- Renamed _enable_kolab to with_kolab.  What seem to be more in line
  with the rpm conventions.  There are macros like %%{with } and
  %%{bcond_with }, but unfortenately they did not work for me.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 25 10:18:35 UTC 2009 - rhafer@novell.com

- updated patches to apply with fuzz=0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 08:48:12 UTC 2009 - rhafer@novell.com

  requirement for cyrus-imapd (bnc#538852)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 08:40:16 UTC 2009 - rhafer@novell.com

- fixed multiple buffer overflows in the SIEVE code, caused by
  unsafe usage of the sprintf function (bnc#539877, CVE-2009-3235)
- Added flex and bison to buildrequires as the above bugfix 
  requires the sieve parser code to be regenerated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 07:21:25 UTC 2009 - rhafer@novell.com

    newer servers that issue an auto-capability response after AUTH
    with a SASL security layer.
  * Fixed quota calculation to ignore files not mentioned in the
    index
  * Correct cache truncation after an aborted append (was leaving
    empty holes in the cache file)
  * Fixed ACLs copying when renaming users
  * Fixed TLS session reuse
  * Log more detail about changes done by a reconstruct
    (indicating that there were problems with the mailbox before 
    hand - mainly as a debugging aid)
  * Ensured that the longest possible named mailbox can still be
    deleted when delayed delete is enabled by increasing buffer
    sizes
  * Add configuration option mailbox_default_options allowing 
    (for example) modsequences to be turned on for all new
    mailboxes
  * Various Replication fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 15 15:06:26 CET 2009 - rhafer@suse.de

     rather than glob.c.  This avoids a potential crash due to
     conflicts between glibc and Heimdal implementations of glob().
  * Added support for fulldirhash to 'ctl_mboxlist -v'
  * Several skiplist transaction bugfixes.
  * cyr_expire no longer has a default of 0 (zero) for -X and -D.
     These options must be used explicitly in order to have the desired
     effect.
  * Added sieve_utf8fileinto option.
  * Added sieve_sasl_send_unsolicited_capability and
     sieve_sasl_expect_unsolicited_capability options.

- cleanups in %post scriptlet (bnc#357950, bnc#357946)
- Update to 2.3.11. From the changelog:
  * Fixed several skiplist bugs -- courtesy of Fastmail.fm.
  * Add robustness to skiplist recovery -- courtesy of Fastmail.fm.
  * Added support for modification sequences to replication protocol
    (for CONDSTORE) -- courtesy of David Carter.
  * Fixed delayed delete replication -- courtesy of Fastmail.fm.
  * Allow [un]deleting of user INBOXes (renaming to/from deleted
    hierarchy) to work when using delayed delete -- courtesy of Simon
    Matter.
  * Fixed interaction with removal of rights and implicitownerrights.
  * Fixed parsing of single FETCH item when using FETCH modifiers.
  * Prevented SSL_accept() from blocking indefinitely when using
    TLS/SSL. This should eliminate a lot of hung SSL-wrapped processes.
  * Allow STARTTLS to be used to externally preauth'd LMTP connections.
  * Allow a TLS client certificate to be sufficient authentication for
    LMTP.
  * timsieved now automatically sends CAPABILITY response after
    STARTTLS. This code was reintroduced after being mistakenly removed
    as part of bug #1338.
  * Fixed miscellaneous bugs and build issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 13:06:28 CET 2007 - rhafer@suse.de

- update to 2.3.10. Most imporant changes:
  * Added support for "delayed" delete, in which mailboxes are renamed
    to a special admin-only "deleted" hierarchy at the time of the
    DELETE (hiding them from the client), rather than immediately
    removing them from the filesystem. 
  * Fixed the special case of RENAMEing an Inbox, so that it doesn't
    keep the same mailbox uniqueid, thus allowing it to replicate
    properly (seen state is still preserved). 
  * Disabled Nagle's algorithm in sync_client and sync_server to
    increase the throughput of the replication protocol. -- courtesy of
    Wes Craig. 
  * Added support for a shared \Seen flag on messages (must be enabled
    on a per-mailbox basis with the /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/sharedseen
    mailbox annotation. 
  * Added -u and -U options to reconstruct -- courtesy of David Carter. 
  * Added SETUIDVALIDITY command to the replication protocol --
    courtesy of David Carter. 
  * Changed message GUIDs used by replication to be the SHA1 hash of
    the messages -- based on work of David Carter and Fastmail.fm. 
  * Improve the performance of commands that operate on sequence-sets.
    The sequence-set is now parsed only once, and the commands operate
    on a sorted list of seq-ranges. 
  * Added new cyr_synclog utility for adding events to the replication
    log -- courtesy of Fastmail.fm. 
  * Added support for disabling duplicate delivery suppression on a
    per-folder basis with the /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/duplicatedeliver
    mailbox annotation -- courtesy of Fastmail.fm.

  * Added support to place some/all mailbox metadata files (cyrus.*
    files) on a separate (probably high-speed) partition. See the new
    metapartition and metapartition_files options for details.
    Development sponsored by FastMail. 
  * Added support for accessing subfolders of INBOX via POP3. See the
    new popsubfolders option for details. Development sponsored by
    FastMail.
