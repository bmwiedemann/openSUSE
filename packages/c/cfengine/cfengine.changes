    (ENT-5309)
  - cf-check: Symlinked LMDB databases are now preserved in repair
    Performs diagnosis and repair on symlink target instead of symlink.
    Repaired files / copies are placed alongside symlink target.
    In some cases, the symlink target is deleted to repair a corrupt
    database, and the symlink is left as a broken symlink. This is
    handled gracefully by the agent, it will be recreated.
    Broken symlinks are now detected as an acceptable condition in diagnose,
    it won't try to repair them or delete them. (ENT-5162)
  - storage promises managing nfs mounts should now correctly mount
    after editing fstab entries

- drop 0001-Simplify-and-fix-parsing-of-etc-SuSE-release-fixes-i.patch,

Tue Jul 28 14:28:49 UTC 2020 - Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk@suse.com>

- Fix version format for suse_version (SuSEfirewall2 check)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 12 14:34:51 UTC 2020 - Klaus Kämpf <kkaempf@suse.com>

- update to 3.15.0
	- New policy function basename() added (CFE-3196)
	- Added read_module_protocol() policy function
	  This function reads module protocol from a file, and can be used
	  for caching the results of commands modules. (CFE-2973)
	- The @ character is now allowed in the key of classic arrays defined
	  by the module protocol (CFE-3099)
	- nth() policy function now supports negative indices (CFE-3194)
	- Fixed .xy floating point numbers parsing in eval() (CFE-2762)
	- Added inform constraint to commands promises, to allow suppression of
	  INFO log messages (CFE-2973)
	- Changed unless constraint to be more consistent with if
	  For any situation where if would NOT skip a promise, unless
	  will cause the promise to be skipped. When there are
	  unresolved variables / function calls, if will skip, unless
	  will NOT skip. (CFE-3160)
	- Default minimum allowed TLS version is now 1.1 (ENT-4616)
	- Network protocol version 2 is now called "tls"
	  "tls" or "2" can be used in places where you specify network
	  protocol. Log messages were altered, to show "tls" instead of
	  "latest". (ENT-4406)
	- Introduced protocol version 3 - "cookie"
	  This protocol is identical to version 2 ("tls"),
	  except it allows the enterprise reporting hub to send
	  the COOKIE command to enterprise hosts. This command is used for
	  detecting hosts using duplicate identities. Protocol version "latest"
	  now points to version 3. For community installations, it should not
	  make a difference, policy servers will not send this command. The only
	  visible difference is the new version number (in logs and policy).
	  (ENT-4406)
	- Package modules now hit network when package cache is first initialized
	  (CFE-3094)
	- Fixed promise skipping bug in unless (CFE-2689)
	- Fixed error message for unexpanded variables in function calls in unless
	  (CFE-2689)
	- Prevented buffer overflow when policy variable names are longer than
	  1024 bytes
	- Zero bytes in class guards no longer cause crashes (CFE-3028)
	- Fixed bug in ps parsing on OpenBSD / NetBSD causing bootstrap to fail
	- Fixed crash in policy/JSON parsing of numbers with too many decimal
	  points (CFE-3138)
	- copy_from without preserve now respects destination mode (ENT-4016)
	- Removed stime_range and ttime_range constraints from promise hash
	  (ENT-4921)
	- Fixed promise result when using process_stop in processes type promises
	  (ENT-4988)
	- cf-execd now sends SIGKILL to the agent process in case of
	  agent_expireafter, after attempting SIGINT and SIGTERM (CFE-2664)
	- cf-serverd now tries to accept connection multiple times (CFE-3066)
	- Fixed multiple measurements tracking growth of same file (ENT-4814)
	- Set create permissions of monitord files in state directory to 0600
	  0600 matches the permissions enforced by policy.
	  Affected files:
	   * state/cf_incoming.*
	   * state/cf_outgoing.*
	   * state/cf_users
	   * state/env_data
	  (ENT-4863)
	- Clarified descriptions of io_writtendata and io_readdata (ENT-5127)
	- Clarified log message about process_count and restart_class being used
	  concurrently (CFE-208)
	- Agent runs that hit abortclasses now record results (ENT-2471)
	- An ID of rhel in os-release file will now define both rhel and redhat
	  classes (CFE-3140)
	- Version specific distro classes are now collected by default in
	  Enterprise (ENT-4752)
	- redhat_8 and redhat_8_0 are now defined on RHEL 8 (CFE-3140)
	- Added derived-from-file tag to hard classes based on /etc/redhat-release
	  (CFE-3140)
	- Added sys.bootstrap_id policy variable containing the ID from
	  /var/cfengine/bootstrap_id.dat, if present (CFE-2977)
	- sys.interfaces now contains interfaces even when they only have
	  IPv6 addresses (ENT-4858)
	- IPv6-only interfaces added to sys.hardware_(addresses,mac) (CFE-3164)
	- IPv6 addresses are now added to policy variable sys.ip_addresses
	  (CFE-682)
	- IPv6 addresses now respect ignored_interfaces.rx (CFE-3156)
	- hostname now allowed in bindtoaddress (CFE-3190)
	- Fixed issue when removing comments from files in various policy functions
	  This also fixes many erroneous occurences of the error message
	  mentioning:

	     [...] because it legally matches nothing

	  (A warning can still appear if a comment regex actually matches nothing).
	  Also made this comment removing logic faster.
	  Affected functions include:
	  * readstringlist()
	  * readintlist()
	  * readreallist()
	  * peers()
	  * peerleader()
	  * peerleaders()
	  * data_readstringarray()
	  * data_readstringarrayidx()
	  * data_expand()
	  * readstringarray()
	  * readstringarrayidx()
	  * readintarray()
	  * readrealarray()
	  * parsestringarray()
	  * parsestringarrayidx()
	  * parseintarray()
	  * parserealarray()
	  (CFE-3188, ENT-5019)
	- Fixed memory leak in JSON / env file parsing (CFE-3210)
	- Fixed memory leak in handling of nfs / fstab (CFE-3210)
	- Fixed memory leak in string_replace() and regex_replace() (CFE-3210)
	- Fixed memory leak when using with constraint (CFE-3210)
	- Fixed minor memory leak in policy evaluation (CFE-3210)
	- Fixed small memory leak in SQL database promises (CFE-3210)
	- Received SIGBUS now triggers a repair of local DBs (CFE-3127)
	- Corrupted LMDB files are now automatically repaired (CFE-3127)
	- Keys in the lock database, cf_lock.lmdb, are now human-readable
	  (CFE-2596)
	- Local databases now use synchronous access on AIX and Solaris (ENT-4002)
	- Report corrupted local database with a critical log message (CFE-2469)
	- Local DB errors are now logged with the particular DB file path (CFE-2469)
	- cf-check: repair now preserves readable data in corrupted LMDB files
	  (CFE-3127)
	- cf-check: --dump option was added to the backup command
	- cf-check: Added --no-fork to diagnose command (CFE-3145)
	- cf-check: Added -M manpage option and other common options (CFE-3082)
	- cf-check: No DB files in state dir now causes errors
	- cf-check: dump command now dumps DB contents to JSON5 (CFE-3126)
	- cf-check: help command can now take a topic as argument

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  8 12:51:04 UTC 2019 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to 3.12.1 (LTS)
  - Added a new binary: cf-check
    + Corrupt local databases (LMDB) continues to be a problem.
    cf-check will be used to diagnose and remediate problems
    with corrupt databases. It is a standalone binary, which
    doesn't evaluate policy or use the local databases, thus
    it can be used in situations where the other binaries
    like cf-agent would hang.
    + cf-check replaces our lmdb database dumper, lmdump.
    + `cf-check lmdump` or symlinking / renaming it to lmdump
    will make cf-check have the exact same behavior as lmdump.
    cf-check will include much more functionality in the future
    and some of the code will be added to other binaries,
    for example to do health checks of databases on startup.
    Ticket: (ENT-4064)
  - Class names set by module protocol are automatically canonified
    (CFE-2877, CFE-2887)
  - Correct log level for data_readstringarray* (CFE-2922)
  - Eliminated error messages caused by attempting to kill expired processes
    (CFE-2824)
  - Fix cf-runalerts systemd unit conditions so the service will run
    (ENT-3929)
  - Fix the off-by-one error in cf-runagent background process spawning
    (CFE-2873)
  - Fixed a memory leak which occurred when reloading RSA keys from disk
  - Fixed a memory leak which occurred while loading augments files
    (CFE-2913)
  - Fixed an issue while parsing ps output on AIX (ENT-4295)
  - Fixed an issue with splay time in cf-execd (CFE-2931)
  - Fixed error handling and memory leak in cf-key (CFE-2918)
  - Fixed memory leak in lmdb cleanup (CFE-2918)
  - Fixed memory leaks in cf-agent during bootstrap (CFE-2918)
  - Fixed memory leaks in variablesmatching() and findfiles() (CFE-2918)
  - Fixed missing class with mustache templates in warn_only mode (CFE-2600)
  - Fixed small memory leak in cf-serverd (CFE-2918)
  - Fixed valgrind warning about lmdb writing uninitialized memory (CFE-2591)
  - Read mustache-rendered files in text mode when comparing digest (ENT-2526)
  - Reload persistent classes on config reload in cf-execd and cf-serverd
    (CFE-2857)

- Fix path to executables for sys variables (BOO #1099946) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  3 07:30:21 UTC 2018 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.12.0 (LTS)
  New Features:
  - Add a --key-type option to specify RSA key size to cf-key
  - New hash_to_int policy function (CFE-2733)
  - Issue a warning on ignored locking attributes (CFE-2748)
  - Add IPv6 hard classes with the "ipv6_" prefix (CFE-2310)
  - Introduce "missing_ok" attribute in body copy_from
    This allows to ignore missing sources in file copy operations
    (CFE-2365)
  - Enable Xen hypervisor detection on all x86 platforms (CFE-2203)
  - Add sys.policy_entry variables (CFE-2572)
  - Added inline_mustache template method (CFE-1846)
  - New component cf-net (cf-net is a CLI for the CFEngine network
    protocol, useful for debugging, testing etc) and accompanying
    policy variable sys.cf_net containing path to cf-net binary
  - Added --log-level option to all components
    This allows you to specify any log level (info, verbose, debug
    etc.).
    It is also less strict, allowing different spelling. As an example,
    --log-level i, --log-level INFO, --log-level inform are all the same.
  - Added special behavior for bundles named __main__
    If the bundle is defined in the entry policy it will be defined as
    main.
    If the bundle is defined elsewhere, it will be removed.
    This makes it easy to make importable library policy which can also
    be executed directly.

Wed Jun 15 12:21:10 UTC 2016 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.9.0
  Full changelog at https://github.com/cfengine/core/blob/3.9.0/ChangeLog
  New features:
  - Classes promise: allow classes without an expression to default to
    defined.
  - Add optional interface parameter to iprange() to match only one
    interface.
  - Allow '=' in symbolic modes (Redmine #7826)
  - Add: FreeBSD ports package module
  - New package module for FreeBSD pkg package manager.
  - Add support for adding/removing fifos in policy
  - Add Linux parsing of /proc/net/ data.
    - sys.inet
    - sys.inet6
    - sys.interface_data
    - Data is returned as a data container.
    - See documentation for more details. (Jira CFE-1991)
  - sys.ip2iface: new reverse mapping variable from IP to
    interface name
  - Namespaced classes can now be specified on the command line.
  - namespaces can now be passed to cf-runagent -D and --remote-bundles
    (Redmine #7856)
  - Add 'cf-full' and 'json-full' to cf-promises '-p' option.
    They generate output based on the entire policy. The existing 'cf'
    already behaved this way, and it has now been changed to generate
    output only for a single file, which the existing 'json' option
    already does.
  - New language functions: processexists() and findprocesses()
    (Redmine #7633)
  - Implement new regex_replace() function. (Redmine #7346)
  - Add log rotation policy for state/classes.jsonl log.
    (Redmine #7951)
  - Added collect_vars utility bundle to stdlib
  - Intoduce report_class_log attribute to body agent common.
    (Redmine #7951)
  - Add standard_services service_method allowing for explicit usage
  - cf-promises --show-vars can now show JSON variables.
  - Add json_pipe mode to mapdata(), which allows piping a
    JSON container to an external program for manipulation and receiving
    JSON back. The jq tool is a good example where this mode can be
    useful. A corresponding $(def.jq) variable has also been added with
    a default path to this tool. See documentation for mapdata() for
    more information and examples. (Jira CFE-2071)
  - behaviour change: "true" is always defined and "false" is never
    defined in a context expression.
  - Add: nimclient package module for AIX
    This module provides basic functionality for using nimclient as a means
    to ensure packages are either present or absent. It does not support
    listing package updates available or provide any special caching.
  - Add callstack_callers() and callstack_promisers() functions.
  - Log variable definitions in debug output. (Redmine #7137)
  - Add: Memory information to host info report (Jira CFE-1177)
  - In Mustache templates, one can now use {{#-top-}} and
    {{/-top-}} tags to iterate over the top level element in a
    container. (Redmine #6545)
  - Add network_connections() function that parses /proc/net
  - Provide new -w argument to override the workdir for testing
  - New feature: Emails sent by cf-execd can be filtered to get
    rid of emails for unwanted log messages. The attributes
    mailfilter_include and mailfilter_exclude in body executor
    control control what to include. See documentation for
    cf-execd for more information. (Jira CFE-2283)
  - Add: file_make_mustache bundle to render mustache templates
  - Add '-n' flag to cf-key to avoid host name lookups.
  - cf-agent, cf-execd, cf-promises, cf-runagent and cf-serverd honor
    multiple -D, -N and -s arguments (Redmine #7191)
  - Add "canonify" mode to mapdata().
  - Add: printfile bodies to stdlib
  - Add: New results classes body [] (Redmine #7418, #7481)
  - Implement cf-runagent --remote-bundles and cf-serverd "bundle" access
    promise. (Redmine #7581)
  - Add commands promise arglist attribute, augmenting args attribute.
  - It's now possible to reference variables in inline JSON,
    for example: mergedata('[ thing, { "mykey": otherthing[123] } ]').
    thing and otherthing[123] will be resolved as variables, since
    they are unquoted. See the documentation for more details.
    (Redmine #7871)
  - Allow inline JSON to be used in the following function calls:
    - data_expand()
    - difference()
    - every()
    - filter()
    - format()
    - getindices()
    - getvalues()
    - grep()
    - intersection()
    - join()
    - length()
    - makerule()
    - mapdata()
    - maplist()
    - mean()
    - mergedata()
    - none()
    - nth()
    - parsejson()
    - product()
    - regarray()
    - reglist()
    - reverse()
    - shuffle()
    - some()
    - sort()
    - storejson()
    - string_mustache()
    - sublist()

    See the documentation for more details. (Jira CFE-2253)
  - Add: edit_line contains_literal_string to stdlib
  - Add body agent control select_end_match_eof option. (Jira CFE-2390)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 15 07:00:50 UTC 2016 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.8.2
  Fixes:
  - Reduce verbosity of apt_get package module (Redmine #7485)
  - Reduce verbosity of yum package module (Redmine #7485)
  - The isvariable() function call now correctly accepts all
    array variables when specified inline. Previously it would not accept
    certain special characters, even though they could be specified
    indirectly by using a variable to hold it. (Redmine #7088)
  - Don't follow symbolic links when copying extended attributes.
  - Fix a bug which sometimes caused package promises to be
    skipped with "XX Another cf-agent seems to have done this
    since I started" messages in the log, most notably in long running cf-agent
    runs (longer than one minute). (Redmine #7933)
  - Fix bug which could render host unable to recover from a
    syntax error, even if failsafe.cf was utilized. This could
    happen if the file containing the syntax error was specified in the def.json
    special file. (Redmine #7961)
  - Change: Policy files specified in the "inputs" section of
    def.json will no longer be auto-loaded. One has to refer to the
    $(def.augments_inputs) variable in the policy (the standard
    masterfiles policies include this by default). This only affects
    installations which are not based on the standard masterfiles, and
    which are using the "inputs" field inside def.json. (Redmine #7961)
  - Fix file descriptor leak when there are network errors.
  - Fix cf-serverd error messages with classic protocol clients
    (Redmine #7818)
  - Installing packages containing version numbers using yum
    now works correctly. (Redmine #7825)
  - Fix ps options for FreeBSD to check processes only in
    current host and not in jails
  - fix build failure on FreeBSD 7.1 (Redmine #7415)
  - Show errors regarding failure to copy extended attributes
    when doing a local file copy. Errors could happen when copying
    across two different mount points where the support for extended
    attributes is different between the mount points.
  - Fix classes being set because of hash collision in the implementation.
    (Redmine #7912)
  - Allow def.json up to 5MB instead of 4K.
  - Fix a regression which would sometimes cause "Permission
    denied" errors on files inside directories with very restricted
    permissions. (Redmine #7808)
  - Change: Suppress standard services noise on SUSE (Redmine #6968)
      
  Changes:
  - Change: classesmatching(): order of classes changed

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Fix two cases where action_policy warn still produces errors
    (Redmine #7274)
  - Parse def.json vars, classes and inputs from the C code. This
    fixes a bug where certain entries in this file would be parsed
    too late to have any effect on the evaluation. (Redmine #7453, #7615)
  - Fix HP-UX specific bug that caused a lot of log output to disappear.
  - Check for empty server response in RemoteDirList after decryption
    (Redmine #7908)
  - getvalues() will now return a list also for data containers,
    and will descend recursively into the containers. (Redmine #7116)
  - Define (bootstrap|failsafe)_mode during update.cf when triggerd
    from failsafe.cf (Redmine #7861)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  7 13:10:16 UTC 2015 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.8.0
  New features/additions:
  - New feature: Bodies can now inherit attribute values from
    other bodies by specifying "inherit_from" with the name of the body to
    inherit from, plus any arguments it accepts. For example:
    body classes myclasses
    {
      inherit_from => classes_generic("myname");
    }
    (Redmine #4309)
  - Add url_get() function. (Redmine #6480)
  - Add @if feature() syntax
    @if feature work like @if minimum_version but allows distinguishing
    between features choosen at compile time.
  - Extend module protocol to create persistent classes.
    To use it, have the module print a line with "^persistence=<minutes>"
    before printing any class names. "persistence=0" goes back to non-
    persistent classes. (Redmine #7302)
  - Add: New results classes body (Redmine #7418)
  - Add: Debug reports in cfe_internal_cleanup_agent_reports
  - Add: Path to svcprop in stdlib
  - Add: masterfiles-stage script to contrib
  - Whitespace is now allowed in class expressions for
    readability, between class names and operators. (Redmine #7152)
  - Add: New results classes body [Redmine#7481] (Redmine #7418)
      
  Changes:
  - Change: Clarify bootstrap/failsafe reports
  - Change: Improve in-line docs for internal log maintenance
  - Change: Improve efficiency and debug reports (Redmine #7527)
  - Remove: 3.5 support from masterfiles policy framework
  - Long promiser strings with multiple lines are now
    abbreviated in logs. (Redmine #3964)
  - Change: Reunify Version based policy split
  - Change: Seperate binary details from policy update (Redmine #7662)
  - Remove /var/cfengine/cf3.<host>.runlog. (Redmine #6957)
  - Change: sys.libdir and sys.local_libdir to non version specific path
  - sys.libdir now resolves to $(sys.inputdir)/lib
  - sys.local_libdir now resolves to lib (Redmine #7559)
  - Moved the following files to /var/cfengine/log/:

Mon Jul 20 09:04:00 UTC 2015 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.7.0
  See https://github.com/cfengine/core/blob/3.7.x/ChangeLog for
  full changelog

  New features:
  - New package promise implementation.
    The syntax is much simpler, to try it out, check out the syntax:
      packages:
        "mypackage"
          policy => "absent/present",

          # Optional, default taken from common control
          package_module => apt_get,

          # Optional, will only match exact version. May be
          # "latest".
          version => "32.0",

          # Optional.
          architecture => "x86_64";

  - Full systemd support for all relevant platforms
  - New classes to determine whether certain features are enabled:
    * feature_yaml
    * feature_xml
    For the official CFEngine packages, these are always enabled, but
    packages from other sources may be built without the support.
  - New readdata() support for generic data input (CSV, YAML, JSON, or auto)
  - YAML support: new readyaml() function and in readdata()
  - CSV support: new readcsv() function and in readdata()
  - New string_mustache() function
  - New data_regextract() function
  - eval() can now be called with "class" as the "mode" argument, which
    will cause it to return true ("any") if the calculated result is
    non-zero, and false ("!any") if it is zero.
  - New list_ifelse() function
  - New mapjson() function as well as JSON support in maparray().
  - filestat() function now supports "xattr" argument for extended
    attributes.
  - "ifvarclass" now has "if" as an alias, and "unless" as an inverse
    alias.
  - Ability to expand JSON variables directory in Mustache templates:
    Prefix the name with '%' for multiline expansion, '$' for compact
    expansion.
  - Ability to expand the iteration *key* in Mustache templates with @
  - Canonical JSON output: JSON output has reliably sorted keys so the
    same data structure will produce the same JSON every time.
  - New "@if minimum_version(x.x)" syntax in order to hide future language
    improvements from versions that don't understand them.
  - compile time option (--with-statedir) to
    override the default state/ directory path.
  - Fix error messages/ handling in process signalling which no longer
    allowed any signals to fail silently
  - Also enable shortcut keyword for cf-serverd classic protocol, eg to
    simplify the bootstrap process for clients that have different
    sys.masterdir settings (Redmine #3697)
  - methods promises now accepts the bundle name in the promiser string,
    as long as it doesn't have any parameters.
  - In a services promise, if the service_method bundle is not specified,
    it defaults to the promiser string (canonified) with "service_" as a
    prefix. The bundle must be in the same namespace as the promise.
  - inline JSON in policy files: surrounding with parsejson() is now
    optional *when creating a new data container*.
  - New data_expand() function to interpolate variables in a data container.
  - Add configurable network bandwidth limit for all outgoing
    connections ("bwlimit" attribute in "body common control") . To
    enforce it in both directions, make sure the attribute is set on both
    sides of the connection.
  - Secure bootstrap has been facilitated by use of
    "cf-agent --boostrap HUB_ADDRESS --trust-server=no"
  - Implement new TLS-relevant options (Redmine #6883):
    - body common control: tls_min_version
    - body server control: allowtlsversion
    - body common control: tls_ciphers
    - body server control: allowciphers (preexisting)

 - fix input range definition for laterthan() function (Redmine #6530) 
 - don't add trailing delimiter when join()'ing lists ending with a 
   null-value (Redmine #6552) 
 - 9999999999 (ten 9s) or higher has been historically used as an upper 
   bound in CFEngine code and policy but because of overflow on 32-bit 
   platforms it caused problems with big numbers.
   Fixed in two ways: 
   first change all existing policy uses to 999999999 (nine 9s instead 
   of eleven 9s), second fix the C code to not wrap-around in case of 
   overflow, but use the LONG_MAX value (Redmine #6531). 
 - cf-serverd and other daemons no longer reload their configuration 
   every minute if CFEngine is built with an inputs directory outside 
   of the work directory (not the default). (Redmine #6551) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 16 12:13:30 UTC 2014 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.6.2-build5 pre-release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 28 15:12:10 UTC 2014 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.6.1
  New features:
  - Introduced Solaris and AIX support into the 3.6 series, with
    many associated build and bug fixes.

  Changes:
  - Short-circuit evaluation of classes promises if class is already
    set (Redmine #5241)
  - fix to assume all non-specified return codes are failed in
    commands promises (Redmine #5986)
  - cf-serverd logs reconfiguration message to NOTICE (was INFO)
    so that it's always logged in syslog

  Bug fixes:
  - File monitoring has been completely rewritten (changes attribute
    in files promise), which eliminates many bugs, particularly
    regarding files that are deleted. Upgrading will keep all
    monitoring data, but downgrading again will reinitialize the DB,
    so all files will be reported as if they were new. (Redmine #2917)
  - $(this.promiser) expands in files promises for 'transformer',
    'edit_template', 'copy_from.source', 'file_select.exec_program',
    'classes' and 'action' bodies (Redmine #1554, #1496, #3530, #1563)
  - 'body changes' notifies about disappeared files in file monitoring
     (Redmine #2917)
  - Set not-kept classes when files or commands promise should be
    repaired, but is warn-only (Redmine #2359)
  - Fixed CFEngine template producing a zero-sized file (Redmine #6088)
  - Add 0-9 A-Z _ to allowed context of module protocol (Redmine #6063)
  - Extend ps command column width on Solaris and filter on zone
    rather than adding it to the ps output.
  - Fixed strftime() function on Solaris when called with certain
    specifiers.
  - Fixed users promise bug regarding password hashes in a NIS/NSS setup.
  - Fixed $(sys.uptime), $(sys.systime) and $(sys.sysday) in AIX.
    (Redmine #5148, #5206)
  - Fixed processes_select complaining about "Unacceptable model
    uncertainty examining processes" (Redmine #6337)
  - ps command for linux has been changed to cope with big rss values
    (Redmine #6337)
  - Address ps -axo shift on FreeBSD 10 and later (Redmine #5667)
  - methods and services promises respect action_policy => "warn"
    (Redmine #5924)
  - LMDB should no longer deadlock if an agent is killed on the hub
    while holding the DB lock. Note that the change only affects
    binary packages shipped by CFEngine, since the upstream LMDB
    project has not yet integrated the change. (Redmine #6013)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 10 13:04:00 UTC 2013 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.5.3
  - Improved security checks of symlink ownership.
    A symlink created by a user pointing to resources owned by a
    different user will no longer be followed.
  - Changed the way package versions are compared in package promises.
    (Redmine #3314)
    In previous versions the comparison was inconsistent. This has
    been fixed, but may also lead to behavior changes in certain
    cases. In CFEngine 3.5.3, the comparison works as follows:
    <package-being-considered> <package_select> <package_version>
    For instance: apache-2.2.31 ">=" "2.2.0" will result in the
    package being installed.

  Bug fixes:

  - fix cf-monitord crash due to incorrect array initialization (Redmine
    #3180)
  - fix cf-serverd stat()'ing the file tree every second (Redmine #3479)
  - correctly populate sys.hardware_addresses variable (Redmine #2936)

  - fix body copy purging of empty directories (Redmine #3429)
  - make discovery and loading of avahi libraries more robust
  - compile and packaging fixes for HP-UX, AIX and Solaris
  - fix fatal error in lsdir() when directory doesn't exist (Redmine
    #3273)
  - fix epoch calculation for stime inrange calculation (Redmine #2921)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 11:30:59 UTC 2013 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.5.1
  Core Changes:
  - the CFEngine Standard Library in masterfiles/libraries is now
    split into promise-type specific policy files, and lives in a
    version-specific directory. This should have no impact on current
    code, but allows more granular include of needed stdlib
    elements (Redmine #3044)
  - file changes are logged with log level Notice, not Error

  Bug fixes:
  - fix recursive copying of files (Redmine #2965)
  - respect classes in templates (Redmine ##2928)
  - fix timestamps on Windows (Redmine #2933)
  - fix non-root cf-agent flooding syslog (Redmine #2980)
  - fix email flood from cf-execd due to timestamps in agent output
    (Redmine #3011)
  - Preserve security context when editing or copying local files
    (Redmine #2728)
  - fix path for sys.crontab on redhat systems (Redmine #2553)

    (Redmine #2820)
  - Fix symlinks being destroyed when editing them (Redmine #2363)
  - Fix missing "promise kept" status for the last line in a file
    (Redmine #2943)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:12:52 UTC 2013 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 3.5.0 - Alpha 2
  New features:
  - new built-in functions: classesmatching, strftime, filestat,
    ifelse, maparray
  - cf-promises flag --parse-tree is replaced by --policy-output-format=,
    requiring the user to specify the output format (none, cf, json)
  - cf-promises allows partial check of policy (without body common
    control) without integrity check;
    --full-check enforces integrity check
  - agent binaries support JSON input format (.json file as generated
    by cf-promises)
  - cf-key: new options --trust-key/-t and --print-digest/-p
  - Class "failsafe_fallback" is defined in failsafe.cf when main
    policy contains errors and failsafe is run because of this
  - add scope attribute for body classes (Redmine #2013) 

  Changes:
  - action_policy => "warn" causes not_kept classes to be set on
    promise needing repair.
  - command line option version (-V) now prints a shorter
    parsable version without graphic
  - implicit execution of server and common bundles taking
    arguments is skipped in cf-serverd.
  - WARNING: option --policy-server removed, require option to
    --bootstrap instead

          to select_xpath
  - edit_xml: make sure that text-modification functions don't
    overwrite child nodes
  - edit_xml: improve error logging

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 29 07:48:20 UTC 2012 - kkaempf@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  4 08:48:10 UTC 2012 - kkaempf@suse.com

- honor filesystem hierachy standard (FHS):
  - build with --enable-fhs

- honor documentation
  - install in /var/cfengine

- support systemd where applicable

- update to 3.4.0b2
  New features:
  - XML editing capabilities. See the documentation for edit_xml
    body. Note the new dependency: libxml2.
  - Implement inheritance of local classes by bundles called using
    "usebundle". By default classes are not inherited. See the
    examples/unit_inherit.cf for an example.
  - Moved from Nova/Enterprise:
    - POSIX ACL support,
    - "outputs" promise type,
    - remote syslog support.
  - packages_default_arch_command hook in packages promises, to
    specify default architecture of the packages on the system.
  - packages_version_less_command / packages_version_equal_command hooks
    in packages promises, to specify external command for native package
    manager versions comparison
  - Running in Solaris zone is now detected and classes "zone" and
    "zone_<name>" are created in this case.
  - VirtualBox support added to guest_environment promises.
  - guest_environment promises are supported under OS X.
  - The "depends_on" attribute is now active, for the partal ordering
    of promises. If a promise depends on another (referred by handle)
    it will only be considered if the depends_on list is either kept
    or repaired already.
          
  ** WARNING: When upgrading, make sure that any existing use
     of depends_on does not make some promises being
     unintentionally ignored.
     This can happen if you are currently refering to non-existant or
     never-run handles in depends_on attributes.
  - methods return values, initial implementation  
  - New format for cf-key -s, includes timestamp of last connection

  Changed functionality:
  - cf-execd -F switch no longer implies 'run once'. New -O/--once
    option is added to achieve this behaviour. This makes cf-execd
    easier to run from systemd, launchd and other supervision
    systems.
