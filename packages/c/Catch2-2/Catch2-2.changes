- Update to version 2.13.10:
  * Fixed issue with catch_discover_tests when there is multiple of
    256 tests (gh#catchorg/Catch2#2401, gh#catchorg/Catch2#2503).
  * Catch2-provided main and wmain are explicitly marked as __cdecl
    when compiled with MSVC (gh#catchorg/Catch2#2486,
    gh#catchorg/Catch2#2487).
  * Replaced deprecated std::aligned_storage
    (gh#catchorg/Catch2#2419, gh#catchorg/Catch2#2420).
- Minor rebase of fix-pragmas-old-gcc.patch to apply cleanly.
