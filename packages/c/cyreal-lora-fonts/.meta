  <title>Lora Fonts</title>
  <description>Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It
is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text.

A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its
brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic
voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an
art essay.
Technically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and works equally
well in print.
