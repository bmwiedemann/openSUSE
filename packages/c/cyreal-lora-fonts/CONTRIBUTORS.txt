# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to this repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, company employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because their company holds the copyright.
#
# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Name <email address>
