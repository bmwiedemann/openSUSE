- Update to 0.3.3:
  * Visual artifacts during solar eclipses where solar and lunar radii are nearly equal,
  * Wrong sampling points when computing eclipse double scattering,
  * SIGPIPE from broken X11 ICE connection that sometimes happened during calcmysky execution,
  * Off-by-one mistake in calculation of light pollution texture coordinates,

- Update to 0.3.2:
  * The pseudo-reflection of the sky used by Stellarium now
    doesn't have the solar aureole, which looked strange
    (the actual aureole in the sky is retained);
  * Added support for GLM 1.0.0, which requires a macro
    to be defined to use experimental features.

- Use better macro for selecting a newer GCC on Leap.

- Update to 0.3.1:
  * on GPUs that compute mip maps of non-power-of-two textures poorly,
    eclipsed atmosphere rendering now works as expected;
  * atmosphere model examples now don't include Rayleigh phase function
    in the texture, this change fixes a "round cap around zenith" artifact.

- Fix packaging issue.

- Update to 0.3.0:
  * Now it's possible to replace view direction shaders via ShowMySky API
    without re-creating the renderer. This lets Stellarium switch between
    projections while implementing them in fragment shaders for better image quality.
  * CMake configuration modules are now installed in paths like /usr/lib/cmake/ShowMySky-Qt6
    instead of /usr/lib/ShowMySky-Qt6/cmake.

- Update to 0.2.1:
  * ShowMySky library now has soname;
  * ShowMySky library name depends on major version of Qt,
    so that the versions for Qt5 and for Qt6 can be installed simultaneously;
  * The library can now be used via CMake's CPM without installing;
  * Fixed error handling on macOS (ShowMySky used to crash on any errors);
  * Various OpenGL state management fixes;
  * Rendering the Sun in zero order scattering now correctly takes
    custom Solar spectrum into account.
