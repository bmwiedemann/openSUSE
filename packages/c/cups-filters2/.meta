  <title>OpenPrinting CUPS filters 2.x for CUPS 2.x</title>
  <description>This package cups-filters2 contains backends, filters, and other software
that was once part of CUPS, but during the time when CUPS
was developed at Apple, Apple stopped maintaining these
parts as they were not needed by Mac OS.
In addition it contains more filters and software developed
independently of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric
printing workflow introduced by OpenPrinting.
Since CUPS 1.6.0 cups-filters is required for using printer
drivers (and also driverless printing) with CUPS under Linux.
This version 2.x of cups-filters is only for CUPS 2.2.2 or newer
(for older CUPS versions use cups-filters version 1.x).
This package cups-filters2 requires the new packages libcupsfilters and libppd.
Additionally Ghostscript and poppler are usually needed but not strictly required.
Because automated (driverless) printer setup is as generic security issue
(cf. https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_and_SANE_Firewall_settings)
we provide the driverless parts as separated sub-package cups-filters2-driverless
so users who do not need it can keep it away from their systems.
We do not specify &quot;Recommends: cups-filters2-driverless&quot;
because a recommended package gets automatically (and silently) installed
when it is available to be installed so software which is a generic security issue
would get automatically installed in most cases without an explicit user request.
