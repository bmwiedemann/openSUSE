  <title>Lossless Data Compressor based on LZMA</title>
  <description>Clzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very safe
integrity checking and a user interface similar to that of gzip or bzip2. Clzip
decompresses almost as fast as gzip and compresses better than bzip2, which
makes it well suited for software distribution and data archiving. Clzip uses
the lzip file format; the files produced by clzip are fully compatible with
lzip-1.4 or newer. Clzip is, in fact, a C language implementation of lzip,
intended for embedded devices or systems lacking a C++ compiler.
