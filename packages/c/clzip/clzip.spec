%description
Clzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with
very safe integrity checking and a user interface similar to that of
gzip or bzip2. Clzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and
compresses better than bzip2, which makes it well suited for software
distribution and data archiving. Clzip uses the lzip file format; the
files produced by clzip are fully compatible with lzip-1.4 or newer.
Clzip is, in fact, a C language implementation of lzip, intended for
embedded devices or systems lacking a C++ compiler.
