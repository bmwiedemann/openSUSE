%description
clknetsim is a tool designed to test programs which synchronize the system
clock, either over network or from a hardware reference clock. It simulates
a system or a number of systems connected to each other in a network and
the tested programs discipline the simulated system clocks. It can be used
to quickly test how well the programs control the system clocks in various
conditions or to test the network protocols.
