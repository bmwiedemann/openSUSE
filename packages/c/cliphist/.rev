Hello,
I want to introduce a new package to factory:

Cliphist is a wayland clipboard manager with support for multimedia
https://github.com/sentriz/cliphist

It is useful for wayland based window managers like hyprland and sway, where no clipboard manager is provided by default.
Therefore it would be important to have the package available in the main repos.</comment>
