  <title>C/C++ function declaration translator</title>
  <description>Turn English phrases to C or C++ declarations Cdecl is a program
which will turn English-like phrases such as &quot;declare foo as array 5
of pointer to function returning int&quot; into C declarations such as
&quot;int (*foo[5])()&quot;. It can also translate the C into the
pseudo-English. And it handles typecasts, too. Plus C++. And in this
version it has command line editing and history with the GNU readline
library.
