  <title>Cap'n Proto - Insanely Fast Data Serialization Format</title>
  <description>Cap'n Proto is an insanely fast data interchange format and capability-based
RPC system.  Think JSON, except binary.  Or think of Google's Protocol Buffers
(http://protobuf.googlecode.com), except faster.  In fact, in benchmarks,
Cap'n Proto is INFINITY TIMES faster than Protocol Buffers.
