- Added source services to update to 0.11.1.
- libcelt0-1 bumped to libcelt0-2 due to "current" increment.
- Upstream changes :
 *fixes two minor bugs with 0.11 that affect the bit-stream.
  The quality should improve (very) slightly, but not enough to be
  noticeable in most cases. Several Opus-related bugs have also
  been fixed.

- Update to version 0.7.1
- Patch celt-0.7.1-libceltsuffix.patch removes the suffix from
  libcelt to keep the build service happy.
  * improves the quality of the packet loss concealment (PLC),
    but does not change the rest of the codec. For this reason it
    is the first release not to break bit-stream compatibility with
    the previous release (0.7.0).
    The default name of the library was changed to libcelt0.so to
    make it easier to do the transition when the final 1.0 release
    comes out (with frozen bit-stream and API).
  * CELT 0.7.0 again improves the stereo quality, reduces artefacts
    at low bitrates (birdies and speech roughness) and fixes many
    bugs. In addition to the usual bitstream incompatibilities,
    the API has also changed in this release.

Wed Aug 12 11:31:22 CEST 2009 - sbrabec@suse.cz

- Updated to version 0.6.1:
  * Breaks bit-stream compatibility!
  * Improves the stereo quality, especially at lower bit-rates.
  * Many quality improvements, including better stereo coupling,
    better handling of transients, and better handling of highly
    tonal signals, packet loss robustness, larger dynamic range,
    suitable for encoding 24-bit audio, VBR implementation.
  * Pitch prediction improved and simplified.
  * New bit allocation algorithm.
  * VQ search has been improved, small CPU reduction.
  * Fixing some quality problems with low frequency tones.
  * Many bug fixes.
