  <title>48x48x1 Image Compression and Decompression</title>
  <description>The programs compface and uncompface convert 48x48x1 images to and from
a compressed format.  The purpose of the programs is to allow the
inclusion of face images within mail headers using the field name
&quot;X-face:&quot;.  They make use of a library that allows the compression and
decompression algorithms to be used in other programs, such as mail
dispatchers and mail notification daemons.</description>
