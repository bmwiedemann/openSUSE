%description
This CNI plugin sets up the use of dnsmasq on a given CNI network so that Pods
can resolve each other by name. When configured, the pod and its IP address are
added to a network specific hosts file that dnsmasq reads in. Similarly, when a
pod is removed from the network, it will remove the entry from the hosts file.
Each CNI network will have its own dnsmasq instance.

The dnsname plugin was specifically designed for the Podman container engine.
