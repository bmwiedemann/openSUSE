  cmake versions

- Although the pre-compiled mode has been introduced upstream, it is still not 
  able to build shared libs, so CLI11_PRECOMPILED is default to be disabled. 
  The package is then still header-only, and the build architecture is changed 
  to noarch.
- Tests are enabled during building.
- Upstream changes: update to version 2.3.0
  * Add CLI11_PRECOMPILED as an option. #762
  * Bugfix: Include <functional> in FormatterFwd #727
  * Bugfix: Add missing Macros.hpp to Error.hpp #755
  * Bugfix: Fix subcommand callback trigger #733
  * Bugfix: Variable rename to avoid warning #734
