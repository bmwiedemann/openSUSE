# CUPS client configuration file (optional).

# You may use /etc/cups/client.conf (system wide)
# or ~/.cups/client.conf (per user).
# For more information see "man 5 client.conf".

# The ServerName directive specifies the remote server
# that is to be used for all client operations. That is, it
# redirects all client requests directly to that remote server
# so that a local running cupsd is not used in this case.
# The default is to use the local server ("localhost") or domain socket.
# Only one ServerName directive may appear.
# If multiple names are present, only the last one is used.
# The default port number is 631 but can be overridden by adding
# a colon followed by the desired port number.
# The default IPP version is 2.0 but can be overridden by adding
# a slash followed by version=V where V is 1.0 or 1.1 or 2.0 or 2.1 or 2.2.
# IPP version 2.0 does do not work with CUPS 1.3 or older servers.
# If an CUPS 1.3 or older server is used, its older IPP version
# must be specified as .../version=1.1 or .../version=1.0.

# Examples:
# ServerName sever.example.com
# ServerName 192.0.2.10
# ServerName sever.example.com:8631
# ServerName older.server.example.com/version=1.1
# ServerName older.server.example.com:8631/version=1.1
