  0002-Save-work-on-Avahi-code.patch and
  0003-Avahi-fixes-for-cupsEnumDests.patch which is what upstream
  finally commited to cups 2.2 sources in response to
  https://github.com/apple/cups/pull/4989 in order to fix cupsEnumDests

- Version upgrade to 2.1.3:
  CUPS 2.1.3 fixes some issues in the scheduler, sample drivers,
  and user commands.
  A detailed list of changes can be found in the CHANGES.txt file.
  Changes include (excerpt):
  * The scheduler should not exit under memory pressure
    (<rdar://problem/23255001>)
  * Fixed some issues in ipptool for skipped tests

- Remove cups.sysconfig as it is not used with systemd based distros
- Purposely lose support for SLE11 as it doubles size of some of the
  sections and keep suppor for openSUSE+SLE12
  * even with the conditions we would have to go unencrypted only
    as needs newer gnutls, so don't bother with keeping the compat
- Use upstream service and socket files to allow more working tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 25 13:19:19 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.7.5:
  CUPS 1.7.5 addresses some minor issues and expands upon the
  symlink security protection. Changes include (excerpt):
  * Security: Addressed some more situations where symlinked
    files would be served by the web interface (CVE-2014-5029
    CVE-2014-5030 CVE-2014-5031 STR #4455 and bnc#887240).
  * The LPD backend did not work with some versions
    of glibc (STR #4452)
  * CGI scripts did not work (STR #4454)
- str4455-1.7.patch (see the previous entry below)
  is obsolete because it is fixed upstream since CUPS 1.7.5.
- Let fdupes only create symlinks in /usr/share/cups/templates/ to
  avoid a symlink /usr/share/cups/webcontent/images/cups-icon.png
  because since CUPS 1.7.4/1.7.5 the cupsd web server does
  no longer follow symlinks to avoid the security issues
  mentioned in the previous two entries below
  (fixes bnc#892587 a regression of bnc#887240).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 29 16:41:10 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- str4455-1.7.patch complements the incomplete fix for
  CVE-2014-3537 STR#445 in the CUPS 1.7.4 sources
  to fix the subsequent CVE-2014-5029 CVE-2014-5030
  CVE-2014-5031 STR#4455 (bnc#887240).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 15 11:13:14 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.7.4:
  CUPS 1.7.4 fixes several networking and build issues,
  and addresses a symlink security issue CVE-2014-3537.
  Changes since 1.7.3 include (excerpt):
  * Security: The web interface incorrectly served symlinked files
    and files that were not world-readable, potentially leading to
    a disclosure of information (CVE-2014-3537, STR #4450,
    and bnc#887240).
  * The "snmp" option did not work with the network backends
    (STR #4422).
  * The User directive in client.conf did not override the USER
    environment variable (STR #4426).
  * The web interface now properly shows a "Go" button for
    all text-based browsers (STR #4425).
  * The MaxJobTime directive now properly supports time
    values (STR #4434).
  * Fixed an "IPP read error" race condition issue (STR #4440).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  2 13:21:31 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.7.3:
  CUPS 1.7.3 includes a number of general bug fixes.
  Changes since 1.7.2 include (excerpt):
  * Fixed mapping of OutputBin values such as "Tray1".
  * Several ippGet* functions incorrectly returned -1
    instead of 0 on error.
  * Fixed an authentication race condition in
    cupsSendRequest (STR #4403).
  * The scheduler did not add the "job-hold-until-specified"
    reason when holding a job using the lp command (STR #4405).
  * Auto-typing of PWG Raster files did not work (STR #4417).
  * IPP queues using hardcoded credentials would ask
    for credentials (STR #4371).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 23 14:24:12 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.7.2:
  CUPS 1.7.2 addresses a web interface redirection security issue,
  some scheduler crashed on Linux, and other general bug fixes.
  Changes since 1.7.1 include (excerpt):
  * CVE-2014-2856: The scheduler now blocks URLs containing
    embedded HTML (STR #4356 and bnc#873899).
  * cupsDoIORequest could miss the server status, causing failed
    lpadmin and other administrative commands (STR #4386).
  * Fixed a D-BUS threading issue that caused the scheduler
    to crash (STR #4347).
  * The scheduler now automatically reconnects to Avahi
    as needed (STR #4370, STR #4373).
- str4351.patch that fixed STR #4351: cups-lpd hugh jobs (>2G) fail
  is obsolete because it is fixed upstream since CUPS 1.7.2.
- Removed the CUPS banner files in /usr/share/cups/banners/ and
  the CUPS testpage /usr/share/cups/data/testprint (which is also
  a CUPS banner file type) because they do no longer work
  since CUPS >= 1.6 (see http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4120)
  because there is no longer a filter for Linux that can convert
  the CUPS banner files. Since CUPS >= 1.6 only the banner files
  and testpage in the cups-filters package work via the
  cups-filters PDF workflow and the cups-filters package also
  provides the matching bannertopdf filter (bnc#873376).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 11 14:52:41 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- In case of systemd use --with-rundir=/run/cups
  instead of --with-rundir=/run (bnc#871640).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 27 12:49:42 CET 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- str4351.patch from CUPS upstream fixes
  https://www.cups.org/str.php?L4351
  "STR #4351 cups-lpd hugh jobs (>2G) fail"
  (bnc#864782).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 26 15:20:02 CET 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.7.1 (fate#314630):
  CUPS >= 1.6 has major incompatible changes compared to CUPS
  up to version 1.5.4 in particular when printing via network:
  * The IPP protocol default version increased form 1.1 to 2.0.
    Older IPP servers like CUPS 1.3.x (e.g. in SLE11)
    reject IPP 2.0 requests with "Bad Request" (STR #4231).
    By adding '/version=1.1' to ServerName in client.conf
    (e.g. ServerName older.server.example.com/version=1.1)
    or the CUPS_SERVER environment variable value or by
    adding it to the server name value of the '-h' opion
    (e.g. lpstat -h older.server.example.com/version=1.1 -p)
    the older IPP protocol version for older servers
    must be explicitly specified.
  * CUPS Browsing is dropped in CUPS but the new package
    cups-filters provides the cups-browsed that provides
    basic CUPS Browsing and Polling functionality.
    The native protocol in CUPS for automatic client discovery
    of printers is now DNS-SD.
  * Some printing filters and backends are dropped in CUPS
    but the new package cups-filters provides them so that
    cups-filters is usually needed (recommended by RPM)
    but cups-filters is not strictly required.
  * The cupsd configuration directives are split into two files
    cupsd.conf (can also be modified via HTTP PUT e.g. via cupsctl)
    and cups-files.conf (can only be modified manually by root)
    to have better default protection against misuse of privileges
    by normal users who have been specifically allowed
    by root to do cupsd configuration changes
    (STR #4223 CVE-2012-5519 bnc#789566).
  See the entries below for more information.
  For details see the openSUSE Bugzilla bnc#735404 issue.
  CUPS 1.7.1 improves network and USB printing, fixes some
  scheduler issues, and addresses a minor security issue
  in the lppasswd program.
  Changes since 1.7.0 include (excerpt):
  * Security: the lppasswd program incorrectly used settings
    from ~/.cups/client.conf (STR #4319)
  * ATTR messages could cause string pool memory corruption
    in the scheduler (<rdar://problem/15382819>)
  * Printing to a raw queue could result in corrupt output
    due to opportunistic compression (<rdar://problem/15008524>)
  * Japanese PPDs using with the Shift-JIS encoding
    did not work (<rdar://problem/15427759>)
  * The libusb-based USB backend incorrectly used write
    timeouts (<rdar://problem/15564888>)
  * The IPP backend did not wait for a busy printer
    to become available before attempting to print
    (<rdar://problem/15465667>)
  * Using "@IF(name)" in an Allow or Deny rule
    did not work (STR #4328)
  * The D-BUS notifier did not remove its lockfile (STR #4314)
  * CUPS incorrectly used the USER environment variable when
    the name did not match the user ID (STR #4327)
  For details see the CHANGES.txt file.
- cups-1.7-additional_policies.patch adds the 'allowallforanybody'
  policy to cupsd.conf (fate#303515) and replaces
  cups-1.6.2-adapt_cupsd.conf_defaults_for_SUSE.patch
- Clean up of systemd unit files (bnc#857372):
  Make it working again as simple and secure as it worked
  all the time in the past by providing only one single
  systemd unit file cups.service. In particular currently YaST
  cannot manage services with additional other systemd unit files.
  Furthermore systemd socket activation is currently insecure
  in case of IPv6 (CVE-2012-6094 bnc#795624).
- Clean up how cupsd is launched (via SysVinit or systemd)
  by maintaining strictly separated sections in cups.spec:
  Either for launching cupsd via systemd (if have_systemd is set)
  or for launching cupsd via SysVinit (if have_systemd is not set).
  SysVinit support cannot be removed because CUPS 1.7.1 still
  builds and can be used even for SLE11.
- The default group of users who are allowed to do cupsd
  configuration changes via requests to the running cupsd
  (i.e. the SystemGroup directive in cupsd.conf) is set
  to 'root' only (related to STR #4223 CVE-2012-5519 bnc#789566).
  In this context a general security advice:
  When root allows normal users to do system administration tasks
  (in particular when root allows normal users to administer
  system processes - i.e. processes that run as root), then
  this or that kind of privilege escalation will be possible.
  Only trustworthy users who do not misuse their privileges
  may get allowed to do specific system administration tasks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 30 10:25:24 CET 2013 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.7.0
  CUPS >= 1.6 has major incompatible changes compared to CUPS 1.5.
  See the entries below for more information.
  For details see the openSUSE Bugzilla bnc#735404 issue.
  Changes since 1.7rc1 include (excerpt):
  * The lpadmin command did not send the PPD name from
    the "-m" option (<rdar://problem/15264697>).
  * The scheduler did not respond using the hostname
    specified by the client (<rdar://problem/14583574>).
  * Fixed a couple memory leaks in ippfind that were
    reported by Clang.
  * Fixed a compile issue on 64-bit Linux with Clang - need
    to use the -pie option instead of -Wl,-pie now
    (<rdar://problem/14480938>).
  * The scheduler incorrectly did not pass a FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE
    environment variable to the filters or backend
    (<rdar://problem/14355011>).
  For details see the CHANGES.txt file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 16 16:40:56 CEST 2013 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.7rc1 only for testing purpose.
  CUPS >= 1.6 has major incompatible changes compared to CUPS 1.5.
  After a version upgrade to CUPS >= 1.6 printing in the network
  would no longer work as it did up to CUPS 1.5.
  For details regarding incompatible changes in CUPS >= 1.6 see
  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735404
  and follow the links therein.
  The 1.7 series is primarily a "polish" release with improved
  support for paid, PIN, and release printing, expanded support
  for IPP Everywhere, automatic support for data compression,
  and improved CUPS APIs.
  CUPS 1.7rc1 is the first release candidate for CUPS 1.7.0
  and includes the fixes from CUPS 1.6.3, adds a new
  ippfind utility, fixes some issues in the ipptool utility,
  and fixes some general printing bugs.
  For details what is new in CUPS 1.7 see the CHANGES.txt file.
  Excerpt:
  * Printer xxx-default values were not reported by
    Get-Printer-Attributes or lpoptions (<rdar://problem/14401795>)
  * Added a new ippfind tool for finding IPP printers and
    other Bonjour services (<rdar://problem/13876199>)
- Version upgrade to 1.6.3
  CUPS 1.6.3 fixes some compatibility issues with servers
  running CUPS 1.3.12 or older, fixes some general printing bugs,
  and fixes some minor security issues.
  For details what is new in CUPS 1.6 see the CHANGES-1.6.txt file.
  Excerpt:
  * The lp, lpq, lpr, and lpstat now display an error message
    advising the use of the /version=1.1 ServerName option
    (<rdar://problem/14290628>)
  * Added documentation about the /version=1.1 option to ServerName
    in client.conf (<rdar://problem/14216262>)
  * The lp, lpq, lpr, and lpstat commands incorrectly ignored
    the default printer set in the lpoptions file
    (<rdar://problem/14216472>)
  * Printing using "ipps" URIs was not encrypted.

- Version upgrade to 1.6.2.
  CUPS 1.6 has major incompatible changes compared to CUPS 1.5.
  For details regarding incompatible changes in CUPS 1.6 see
  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735404
  and follow the links therein.
  For details what is new in CUPS 1.6 see the CHANGES.txt file.
  Excerpt:
  * Security: All file, directory, user, and group settings
    are now stored in a separate cups-files.conf configuration
    file that cannot be set through the CUPS web interface
    or APIs (STR #4223).
  * The IPP backend could crash if the printer disconnects
    early (STR #4284).
  * cupsGetPPD did not work with statically-configured CUPS
    shared queues (STR #4178).
  * Bad IPP responses could crash ipptool (STR #4262).
  * Updated USB quirk rules for various printers
    (STR #4217, STR #4263, STR #4286).
  * Added USB blacklisting for printers that require a custom
    backend (STR #4218).
  * The CUPS library did not always detect a timed out connection
    to the server which could cause temporary loss of printing
    from applications (STR #4187).
  * The IPP backend now stops queues when the server configuration
    prevents successful job submission (STR #4125).
  * CUPS 1.6 clients using the ServerName directive in client.conf
    did not work with CUPS 1.3.x or older servers
    (STR #4231, STR #4291).
  * The scheduler could crash when using Avahi
    (STR #4183, STR #4192, STR #4200, STR #4213).
  * The IPP backend could get stuck in an endless loop on certain
    network errors (STR #4194).
  * The scheduler no longer allows job-name values that are
    not valid network Unicode strings (STR #4072).
  * The network backends now support disabling of SNMP supply
    level queries via the "snmp" URI option (STR #4106).
  * The IPP backend did not specify the compression used
    (STR #4181).
  * The scheduler did not recognize dnssd: or ipps: URIs as
    Bonjour shared queues (STR #4158).
  * Applications could not get the PPD file for
    statically-configured Bonjour-shared print queues (STR #4159).
  * Fixed a USB backend compatibility issue on systems using
    libusb (STR #4155, STR #4191).
  * Some Bonjour features were not available on systems
    with Avahi (STR #4156).
- cups-1.6.1-revertSTR3929_to_default_IPP_1.1_again.patch is
  obsolete because it is fixed upstream (STR #4231, STR #4291).
- cups-1.6.2-adapt_cupsd.conf_defaults_for_SUSE.patch
  replaces cups-1.6.1-adapt_cupsd.conf_defaults_for_SUSE.patch
- Adapted cups-client.conf template file for CUPS 1.6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 28 15:04:58 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- cups-1.6.1-adapt_cupsd.conf_defaults_for_SUSE.patch
  adapts the defaults in cupsd.conf for SUSE.
  It replaces cups-1.3.6-access_conf.patch that
  added 'Allow 127.0.0.2' to cupsd.conf to allow access
  for the loopback IP address 127.0.0.2 which is set for
  the hostname by SUSE in /etc/hosts at least up to
  SLE10 products.
  It also replaces cups-1.5-additional_policies.patch
  that added the 'allowallforanybody' policy to cupsd.conf
  see https://fate.novell.com/303515
  Furthermore it fixes some issues with the CUPS upstream
  defaults i.e. removal of no longer supported keywords
  BrowseOrder BrowseAllow DefaultAuthType (otherwise cupsd
  prints error messages of the form "Unknown directive
  BrowseOrder on line 22").
- cups-1.6.1-revertSTR3929_to_default_IPP_1.1_again.patch
  reverts the incompatible change in CUPS 1.6
  that makes IPP version 2.0 default
  (see https://www.cups.org/str.php?L3929)
  back to using IPP version 1.1 by default.
  Otherwise CUPS 1.6 on clients cannot talk to older CUPS
  servers in particular not to CUPS 1.3.9 on SLE11.
  E.g. on a CUPS 1.6 client "lpstat -h sle11.cups.server -p"
  would fail on the client with "lpstat: Bad Request" and
  the CUPS 1.3.9 server logs in /var/log/cups/error_log the
  lines "E ... cupsdReadClient: ... IPP Read Error!"
  and "D ... cupsdSendError: ... code=400 (Bad Request)".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 27 15:50:16 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Version upgrade to 1.6.1.
  CUPS 1.6 has major incompatible changes compared to CUPS 1.5.
  After a version upgrade to CUPS 1.6 printing in the network
  would no longer work as it did up to CUPS 1.5.
  For an overview about what is new in CUPS 1.6 see
  http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.6/whatsnew.html
  For details regarding incompatible changes in CUPS 1.6 see
  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735404
  and follow the links therein.
  For details what is new in CUPS 1.6 see the CHANGES.txt file.
  Excerpt:
  * CUPS now supports color management using colord (STR #3808).
  * CUPS now supports Bonjour using Avahi (STR #3066).
  * The "brightness", "columns", "fitplot", "gamma", "hue",
    "natural-scaling", "penwidth", "position", "ppi",
    "saturation", and "scaling" options are not longer
    supported (STR #4010).
  * Added new destination connection and enumeration functions
    via new dynamic destination APIs (STR #3924).
  * Added new option, localization, and job submission functions
    via new APIs that do not depend on PPD files (STR #3925).
  * The scheduler now supports a DefaultAuthType of "auto" to
    automatically choose between Basic (username/password)
    and Negotiate (Kerberos) authentication.
  * CUPS no longer supports automatic remote printers or
    implicit classes via the CUPS, LDAP, or SLP protocols
    (STR #3922, STR #3923).
  * The PPD APIs are now deprecated and will be removed
    in a future version of CUPS (STR #3927).
  * The default IPP version for requests is now 2.0 (STR #3929).
  * The IPP APIs no longer expose the ipp_t or ipp_attribute_t
    structures and instead provide accessor functions (STR #3928).
  * The scheduler will no longer run programs with group write
    permission.
  * The PHP module has been removed (STR #3932).
  * The bannertops, commandtoescpx, commandtopclx, imagetops,
    imagetoraster, pdftops, rastertoescpx, rastertopclx,
    and texttops filters have been removed (STR #3930).
  * The serial and parallel backends have been removed (STR #3935).
- Adapted cups-config-libs.patch for CUPS 1.6.1
  (IMGLIBS is no longer present in cups-config.in).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 18 12:07:09 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- buildrequire systemd through the pkgconfig provide to get
  systemd-mini in build environment (to break cycle)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 27 07:27:01 UTC 2012 - mmeister@suse.com

- Version upgrade to 1.5.4 (mainly a bugfix release) that fixes
  some IPP printing issues.
  Excerpt:
  * The IPP backend no longer tries to get the job status for
    printers that do not implement the required operation
    (STR #4083).
  * Sending a document in an unsupported format to an IPP printer
    now automatically cancels the job (STR #4093).
  * The IPP backend now treats the client-error-not-possible
    status code as a job history issue, allowing IPP printing to
    Windows to work(STR #4047).
  For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.
- revert_cups-ssl.m4_to_1.5.2.patch is now obsolete because of
  an upstream fix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  4 14:55:57 UTC 2012 - cfarrell@suse.com

- license update: SUSE-GPL-2.0-with-openssl-exception and LGPL-2.1
  Apple grant an openssl linking exception (and an exception for
  linking on Apple owned operating systems).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  1 11:32:13 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Save /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.default
  from becoming hardlinked via the fdupes run in cups.spec
  (see the 'Wed Aug 26 21:43:03 CEST 2009' entry below)
  by making their content different and at the same time
  fix the misleading comment (openSUSE Bugzilla bnc#773971).
- Minor clean-up in cups.spec (the "Remove unpackaged files"
  via "rm -rf <some_man-pages>") is no longer needed because
  those man pages are no longer installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 16 14:32:36 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.5.3 (mainly a bugfix release) that fixes
  a number of PostScript, SSL, authenticated printing,
  and networking issues.
  Excerpt:
  * The scheduler could crash if a PPD file contained
    an invalid paper size (STR #4049).
  * Missing localizations caused empty output (STR #4033).
  * Changed how timeouts are implemented in the LPD backend
    (STR #4013).
  * The default InputSlot setting was never used (STR #3957).
  * Fixed the IPP backend's handling of HTTP/1.0 compatibility
    (STR #3988).
  For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.
- revert_cups-ssl.m4_to_1.5.2.patch reverts cups-ssl.m4 to what
  it was in CUPS 1.5.2 so that autoconf produces a syntactically
  correct configure script otherwise "bash -n configure" fails
  with "syntax error: unexpected end of file",
  see http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4084

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 12 10:53:55 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- No longer require Ghostscript but only "Recommends: ghostscript"
  because the Ghostscript device "cups" is needed by several CUPS
  filters (in particular the "rasterto..." filters) but those
  filters are not used on all systems (e.g. on a print server
  with only "raw" queues) so that a weak Recommends fits better.
  Furthermore this avoids a build dependency cycle between the
  main-packages cups and ghostscript.
- No longer require /usr/bin/pdftops but only a "Recommends"
  because the CUPS filter /usr/lib/cups/filter/pdftops
  (which calls /usr/bin/pdftops) is not used on all systems
  (e.g. on a print server with only "raw" queues) so that
  a weak Recommends fits better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 16:25:24 CEST 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- In cups.spec only "Requires: ghostscript" but no longer require
  ghostscript-fonts-std in cups.spec because in ghostscript.spec
  there is already "Requires: ghostscript-fonts-std"
  (related to openSUSE Bugzilla bnc#735824).
- In cups.spec remove the Obsoletes/Provides cups-SUSE-ppds-dat
  because cups-SUSE-ppds-dat.rpm existed only up to SLE10
  but it does no longer exist since 11.1/SLE11
  and CUPS 1.5.x is not provided for SLE10.
- Use traditional bash scriptlets for post/postun with
  an explicite "exit 0" line at the end to be fail safe and
  therefore also "PreReq: /sbin/ldconfig" explicitly for the
  cups-libs sub-package, see the "Shared_libraries" section in
  http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_scriptlet_snippets

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 14:42:59 CET 2012 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.5.2 (mainly a bugfix release). This release
  fixes a number of printing, encryption, and ipptool issues.
  Excerpt:
  * The scheduler incorrectly used free() on a POSIX ACL value,
    which could cause a crash (STR #3970).
  * Encryption was broken with OpenSSL (probably STR #3933
    and bnc#739410 ).
  * Badly formed GIF files could cause the image filters
    to crash (STR #3914).
  For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 10 04:58:44 UTC 2012 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Use explicit buildrequires on the needed libraries.
  otherwise build will fail after libtiff-devel deps cleanup
- Cleanup requires of -devel package, which only needs glibc-devel
- cups-config-libs.patch fixes cups-config script,
  which with option --libs adds:
  LIBS="-lgssapi_krb5 -lkrb5 -lk5crypto -lcom_err -lssl -lcrypto
        -lz -lpthread -lm -lcrypt "
  IMGLIBS="-ltiff -ljpeg -lpng"
  This only makes sense when using static linking but we do not
  ship static libraries and it will only bloat dependant packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 17 18:19:14 UTC 2011 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update systemd patch, Bind to datagram socket as well in
  systemd cups.socket unit file, to prevent that port being
  stolen by another service (from RH).
- There is no need to use -fno-strict-aliasing
  in cflags any longer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  3 20:09:32 UTC 2011 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update systemd patch to a newer version that uses
  libsystemd-daemon instead of bundling sd-daemon wrappers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  3 19:11:36 UTC 2011 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- cups-0001-systemd-add-systemd-socket-activation-and-unit-files.patch
  adds complete systemd support, the hardware stuff is handled in
  builtin udev rules (see /lib/udev/rules.d/99-systemd.rules).
  See also http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation2.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  6 11:00:09 CEST 2011 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.5.0 (openSUSE Bugzilla bnc#722057)
  Backward incompatible changes:
  * The main header cups/cups.h no longer includes the PPD header
    cups/ppd.h which may require code changes to applications.
  * CUPS no longer supports the old ~/.cupsrc or ~/.lpoptions files
    from CUPS 1.1.x. The ~/.cups/client.conf and ~/.cups/lpoptions
    files that were introduced in CUPS 1.2 must now be used.
  * The scheduler now requires that filters and backends
    have group write permissions disabled (security).
  * The HP-GL/2 filter is no longer included (STR #3322).
  * The SCSI backend is no longer included (STR #3500).
  Other changes:
  * Updated the PostScript filter to support IncludeFeature
    in more circumstances (STR #3417).
  * The scheduler now sets the process group for child processes
    and manages the group (STR #2829).
  * The scheduler now more carefully creates and removes
    configuration, cache, and state files (STR #3715).
  * The lpadmin command now allows default option values
    to be deleted (STR #2959).
  * Restored support for GNU TLS and OpenSSL with threading
    enabled (STR #3605, STR #3461).
    Therefore cups-1.4.4-str3461-1.4.reverted.patch
    is no longer needed (openSUSE Bugzilla bnc#617026).
  * Increased the default RIPCache value to 128MB (STR #3535).
    Therefore cups-1.4.4-set_default_RIPCache_128m.patch
    is no longer needed (openSUSE Bugzilla bnc#628233).
  * Updated PDF filter to support Ghostscript ps2write (STR #3766).
  * Updated PDF filter to support Poppler option to preserve page
    sizes in PDF files when the user has not selected a particular
    media size (STR #3689).
  * Added new PWG Raster filter for IPP Everywhere printer support.
  * Added support for a new cupsFilter2 keyword in PPD files
    to allow for the propagation of the actual MIME media type
    produced by a filter.
  * Name resolution errors no longer no longer cause
    queues to stop (STR #3719, STR #3753). See also
    https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=337794#c16
  * Added a new cups-exec helper program that applies security
    profiles to filters, port monitors, backends, CGI programs,
    and mini-daemons.
  * The web interface can now be disabled using the WebInterface
    directive in cupsd.conf (STR #2625).
  * The ipptest tool is now a first-class user program (STR #3484).
  For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.
- cups-1.4.4-str3461-1.4.reverted.patch (bnc#617026) and
  cups-1.4.4-set_default_RIPCache_128m.patch (bnc#628233)
  are no longer needed because the issues are fixed upstream.
  cups-1.5-additional_policies.patch (fate#303515) replaces the
  cups-1.4-additional_policies.patch which does no longer apply.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 30 20:07:52 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.com

- add libtool as buildrequire to make the spec file more reliable

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 15:10:07 CEST 2011 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Reverted the change from meissner below dated
  "Fri Sep 23 09:54:39 CEST 2011" so that baselibs.conf again
  contains only one line "cups-libs" as before because the
  submitrequest 85423 Printing/cups -> openSUSE:Factory/cups
  was declined by coolo with the following reason:
  "cups-devel-32bit requires cups-32bit (default requires),
   which does not exist".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 11:51:21 CEST 2011 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.4.8
   * network backends could crash if a printer returned a value
     of 0 for the maximum capacity for a supply (STR #3875)
   * For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.
- Upgraded to CUPS 1.4.7
   * imageto* filters could crash with bad GIF files (STR #3867)
   * CUPS did not work with some printers that incorrectly
     implemented the HTTP/1.1 standard (STR #3778, STR #3791)
   * Fixed crash in scheduler when the application/octet-stream
     MIME type was not defined (STR #3690)
   * The web interface no longer tries to use multi-part delivery
     when adding printers (STR #3455) using Epiphany or IE
   * "lp" and "lpr" failed with Kerberos enabled (STR #3768)
   * Remote printer URIs with options did not work (STR #3717)
   * The scheduler now only looks up interface hostnames
     if HostNameLookups are enabled (STR #3737)
   * The scheduler could crash if a browsed printer times out
     while a job is printing (STR #3754)
   * For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 11:20:00 CEST 2011 - jsmeix@suse.de

- cups-1.4.4-set_default_RIPCache_128m.patch enlarges
  the CUPS upstream default RIPCache from 8m to 128m
  to avoid various kind of printout failures
  (STR #3535, and Novell/openSUSE Bugzilla bnc#628233).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 23 09:54:39 CEST 2011 - meissner@suse.de

- cups-devel baselibs package for Wine 32bit on 64bit building
  (added "cups-devel requires cups-libs..." to baselibs.conf).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 18 00:09:02 UTC 2011 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Remove redundant tags/sections from specfile
  (removed "norootforbuild" and the "clean" section).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 25 12:08:35 CEST 2011 - meissner@suse.de

- "no" locale is "nb" (norwegian bokmal) these days
  (move /usr/share/locale/no to /usr/share/locale/nb).
- "zh" is probably meant as "zh_CN", as "zh_TW" exists
  (move /usr/share/locale/zh to /usr/share/locale/zh_CN).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 10 11:51:56 CET 2011 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Cleaned up the RPM Requires:
  Removed the needless "Suggests: poppler-tools" because there
  is "Requires: /usr/bin/pdftops" which should be sufficient.
  Replaced the RPM Requires for foomatic-filters by Recommends
  because foomatic-rip is only needed by CUPS in a few cases
  and printer driver packages which need foomatic-rip require
  foomatic-filters on their own.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 14 14:25:39 CET 2011 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.4.6
  CUPS 1.4.6 fixes in particular a regression:
  * A change was made in CUPS 1.4.5's pstops filter
    that it did not support landscape printing
    of PostScript files (STR #3722)
  * For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 13:26:06 CET 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Fixed coolo's quick and ditry unconditioned
  "PreReq: sysvinit(syslog)" stuff from below because build fails
  everywhere except openSUSE:Factory (i.e. openSUSE 11.4)
  because sysvinit(syslog) is nowhere else provided.
  Now the PreReq is only if suse_version > 1130.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- prereq init script syslog

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 12 08:47:49 CET 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

-  Upgraded to CUPS 1.4.5
   CUPS 1.4.5 fixes several scheduler and printing bugs
   as well as a reported security bug, in particular:
   * Fixed a IPP parsing memory corruption bug
     (CVE-2010-2941, STR #3648, Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#649256)
   * Fixed a PPD loader bug that could crash the cupsd (STR #3680)
   * The scheduler restarts jobs while shutting down (STR #3679)
   * Did not initialize Kerberos in all cases (STR #3662)
   * The socket backend could go into an infinite loop
     with certain printers (STR #3622)
   * Moving a job via the web interface failed without
     asking for authentication (STR #3559)
   * The web interface did not allow a user to change
     the driver (STR #3537, STR #3601)
   * For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 15 15:03:20 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Fixed /etc/init.d/cups (cups.init source file) so that stopping
  the cupsd waits up to 10 seconds until the cupsd had actually
  finished (if not SIGKILL would be sent to it) to make sure
  that "rccups restart" and "rccups stop ; rccups start" work
  correctly (see Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#622058).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 25 11:28:41 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- cups-1.4.4-str3461-1.4.reverted.patch reverts changes
  by CUPS STR #3461 as band-aid workaround for now to avoid
  that Mozilla.org applications crash when they try to print
  (STR #3461, STR #3605, and Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#617026).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 18 09:11:02 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.4.4
  CUPS 1.4.4 fixes several security, scheduler, printing,
  and conformance issues, in particular:
  * The web interface now includes additional CSRF protection
    (CVE-2010-0540, STR #3498, STR #3593, and
     Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#601830)
  * The texttops filter did not check the results of allocations
    (CVE-2010-0542, STR #3516, Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#601352)
  * The web admin interface could disclose the contents of memory
    (CVE-2010-1748, STR #3577, Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#604271)
  * The fix for CVE-2009-3553 (STR #3200) was incomplete
    for systems that use kqueue or epoll (STR #3490)
  * CUPS could overwrite files as root in directories owned or
    writable by non-root users (STR #3510)
  * The OpenSSL interfaces have been made thread-safe and
    the GNU TLS interface is explicitly forbidden
    when threading is enabled (STR #3461)
  * The scheduler could crash on restart if classes
    were defined (STR #3524)
  * The socket backend no longer waits for back-channel data
    on platforms other than Mac OS X (STR #3495)
  * For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 14 14:47:29 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update cups-1.3.9-desktop_file.patch: add the Settings category
  (required since we use HardwareSettigns) and add NotShowIn=GNOME:
  in GNOME, the configuration tool we want to use is
  system-config-printer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  2 15:16:02 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Explicitly set configure option '--enable-debug' because
  otherwise the cups-debuginfo RPM would be empty.
- Removed no longer recognized configure option '--enable-pie'
  (it compiles and links with '-pie -fPIE -fPIC' by default).
- Disabled .SILENT in Makedefs.in so that make is verbose as usual.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 10 20:12:43 UTC 2010 - guido+opensuse.org@berhoerster.name

- In cups.spec removed '-r' from the suse_update_desktop_file call
  to not replace valid (and previously patched via
  cups-1.3.9-desktop_file.patch) categories of the desktop file
  so that it shows up in the right place (this is particularly
  an issue with the LXDE/XFCE menu).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  6 12:39:41 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- cups-1.4.3-default-webcontent-path.patch changes the default path
  whereto the web content is installed from /usr/share/doc/...
  to /usr/share/cups/webcontent because the files of the CUPS
  web content are no documentation (see CUPS STR #3578 and
  Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#546023 starting at comment#6).
- In cups.spec replaced usage of the RPM macro 'name' by the
  explicite value 'cups' (except for the BuildRoot) so that
  CUPS could be built as well with a different package name
  (e.g. when someone likes to provide a CUPS SVN revision
  as 'cupsSVN' or a specifically adapted CUPS as 'cups4me').

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 27 09:40:34 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- cups-krb5-config wrapper script for krb5-config is no longer
  needed because since April 2008 krb5-config works correctly
  (see Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#378270 and compare STR #3556).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 20 15:53:26 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- In cups.xinetd replaced '@LIB@' by '/usr/lib' and removed
  the perl substitute calls regarding '@LIB@' in cups.spec because
  since the upstream compliant CUPS 1.4 it is '/usr/lib/cups/'
  on all platforms (see Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#575544).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 31 12:52:02 CEST 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.4.3:
  * The scheduler could try responding on a closed client
    connection, leading to a crash
    (CVE-2009-3553, STR #3200, and bnc#554861).
  * The lppasswd program allowed the localization files
    to be overridden when running in setuid mode
    (CVE-2010-0393, STR #3482, and bnc#574336).
  * The scheduler would crash when an active printer was deleted.
  * The DBUS notifier did not build (STR #3447).
  * The scheduler did not reset the SIGPIPE handler
    of child processes (STR #3399).
  * For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.
- cups-1.3.9-CVE-2009-3553.patch has become
  obsolete because it is fixed in the source.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 27 14:43:37 CET 2010 - jsmeix@suse.de

- CUPS 1.3 -> 1.4 version upgrade and major cleanup:
  For the CUPS upstream changes see the CHANGES.txt file.
  Such a major version upgrade is the perfect chance
  to drop almost all our own patches to enforce a
  reset to almost 100% compliance with upstream.
  Here our openSUSE CUPS versions and their number of patches
  (i.e. the "Patch" entries in the cups.spec files):
    CUPS version 1.2.12 in openSUSE 10.3: 37
    CUPS version 1.3.7  in openSUSE 11.0: 29
    CUPS version 1.3.9  in openSUSE 11.1: 26
    CUPS version 1.3.11 in openSUSE 11.2: 17
  Of course this includes patches with backported bug fixes
  via our maintenance but nevertheless there were really
  too much openSUSE specific patches.
  Therefore I would like to provide CUPS 1.4 "as is" to the
  furthest possible extent (there are still 6 patches left).
  Then let's see if we get bug reports because of this.
  I did such a reset to 100% compliance with upstream
  already in the past for sane-backends and guess what:
  I got no single bug report at all because of this.
  I guess what they do at upstream is actually not so bad ;-)
- Added the explicite path to '--with-cachedir=/var/cache/cups'
  in cups.spec to avoid that the fallback value 'yes' results
  the cache directory '/etc/cups/yes/'.
- cups-1.3.11-CVE-2009-2820-regression-fix.patch and
  cups-1.3.11-CVE-2009-2820.patch have become
  obsolete because it is fixed in the source.
- cups-1.4-full_path_to_configure_with-pdftops.patch has become
  obsolete because it is fixed in the source.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 15 22:22:18 CET 2009 - jengelh@medozas.de

- add baselibs.conf as a source
- enable parallel building

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 15 13:58:13 CET 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Fixed the URL and MD5 sum comments for Source0 in cups.spec.
- cups-1.3.9-CVE-2009-3553.patch fixes a use-after-free bug
  in the scheduler which leads to remote denial of service,
  (CVE-2009-3553, CUPS STR #3200,
   and Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#554861)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 11 11:56:12 CET 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- cups-1.3.11-CVE-2009-2820-regression-fix.patch
  fixes a regression which was introduced by
  the previous cups-1.3.11-CVE-2009-2820.patch
  which lets adding a class via CUPS Web Interface fail
  with an 'Unknown operation "{op}"' error message
  (CUPS STR #3401 and
   Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#548317 starting at comment #24).
- cups-1.3.11-CVE-2009-2820.patch fixes CUPS Web Interface
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and CRLF injection in HTTP headers
  (CVE-2009-2820 and CUPS STR #3367 and
   Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#548317).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 19:09:12 UTC 2009 - coolo@novell.com

- updated patches to apply with fuzz=0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 26 21:43:03 CEST 2009 - meissner@suse.de

- Fixed as-needed issues when compiling additional tools
  by using the right ordering of source and linked library
  in 'gcc -opoll_ppd_base ... SOURCE1 -lcups'
  and 'gcc -olphelp ... SOURCE2 -lcups' which
  obsoletes the 'export SUSE_ASNEEDED=0' workaround,
  see the 'Fri Jul 10 12:34:54 CEST 2009' entry below.
- Run fdupes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 31 15:08:41 CEST 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- full_path_to_configure_with-pdftops.patch
  adds support to specify a full path in
  'configure --with-pdftops=/usr/bin/pdftops'
  to avoid 'BuildRequires: xpdf-tools' which would
  bloat the build system but would be only needed to
  satisfy 'AC_PATH_PROG(CUPS_PDFTOPS, pdftops)'
  in cups-pdf.m4 if only 'configure --with-pdftops=pdftops'
  was possible (Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#526847).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 10:08:12 CEST 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.3.11:
  * The scheduler and cupsfilter utility would crash with
  certain MIME .types rules (CUPS STR #3159).
  * cups-1.3.10-fix-DNS-rebinding-protection.patch
  (Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#516511 and CUPS STR #3238)
  is obsolete since CUPS 1.3.11 because it is fixed
  in the source (it is fixed via CUPS STR #3164).
  * For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 10 12:34:54 CEST 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Set 'export SUSE_ASNEEDED=0' in cups.spec because build fails
  with --as-needed so that this is for now simply disabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 26 12:50:22 CEST 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- cups-1.3.10-fix-DNS-rebinding-protection.patch fixes
  a regression of the CUPS 1.3.10 DNS rebinding protection which
  lets e.g. "lpoptions -h localhost -p <queue> -l" fail with
  "lpoptions: Unable to get PPD file for <queue>: Bad Request"
  and in /var/log/cups/error_log there is the warning
  W ... Request from "localhost" using invalid Host: field "::1"
  but "::1" is the IPv6 loopback IP address for "localhost"
  (Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#489624 comment#19 and bnc#516511).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 24 14:02:29 CEST 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Upgraded to CUPS 1.3.10:
  * Use a wrapper program filter/pdftops.c which only calls
  /usr/bin/pdftops (via configure --with-pdftops=/usr/bin/pdftops)
  instead of the CUPS fork of the Xpdf source code which was in
  the pdftops directory (CUPS STR #3129). Because of this
  cups-1.4svn-pdftops_as_filter.patch and
  cups-1.4svn-pdftops_dont_fail_on_cancel.patch are obsolete
  since CUPS 1.3.10 (the latter was fixed via CUPS STR #2808).
  * The scheduler now protects against DNS rebinding attacks
  (CUPS STR #3118 and Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#489624).
  * cups-1.3.9-cupstestppd.patch is obsolete since CUPS 1.3.10
  because it is fixed in the source (CUPS STR #2979).
  * cups-1.3.9-max_subscription.patch is obsolete
  since CUPS 1.3.10 because it is fixed in the source
  (no CUPS STR but mentioned in CHANGES.txt "The scheduler
  would crash if you exceeded the MaxSubscriptions limit").
  * cups-1.3.9-filter_png_overflow2.patch is obsolete
  since CUPS 1.3.10 because it is fixed in the source
  (CUPS STR #2974 and Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#448631).
  * cups-1.3.9-hpgltops2.patch is obsolete since CUPS 1.3.10
  because it is fixed in the source (CUPS STR #2966 which is the
  successor of CUPS STR #2911 and Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#430543).
  * cups-1.3.9-cupsImageReadTiff.patch is obsolete
  since CUPS 1.3.10 because it is fixed in the source
  (CUPS STR #3031 and Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#485895).
  * For a complete list see the CHANGES.txt file.
- cups-1.1.21rc2-preauth_security.patch and
  cups-1.1.21rc2-usermode.patch and
  cups-1.1.21-umlaut_printer.patch and
  cups-1.1.23-testpage.patch are finally removed
  since CUPS 1.3.10 because they were made for CUPS 1.1 and
  were no longer applied since CUPS 1.2 in Suse Linux 10.3.
  In particular cups-1.1.21rc2-usermode.patch can no longer
  apply since CUPS 1.2 because RunAsUser in cupsd.conf is
  no longer supported since CUPS 1.2, for more info see e.g. the
  "RunAsUser removed; reassurance wanted" mails on cups@easysw.com.
  Furthermore we neither got any Suse Linux/openSUSE user request
  nor any SLE11 beta-tester/customer request for them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  8 15:09:10 CEST 2009 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- Replaced "--enable-static" by "--disable-static" in configure
  so that the static libraries /usr/lib[64]/libcups.a and
  /usr/lib[64]/libcupsimage.a are no longer built and included
  in the cups-devel package to enforce detection of other software
  which might be built with static CUPS libraries so that those
  other software could be fixed to use the dynamic libraries
  (see also Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#509945).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  3 14:20:36 CEST 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Set BROADCAST="ipp" in cups.SuSEfirewall2 source file (which
  gets installed as /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2.d/services/cups)
  so that adding "cups" to allowed services in the firewall
  also allows CUPS Browsing information via UDP broadcasts
  (Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#498429).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 26 12:59:36 CET 2009 - jsmeix@suse.de

- cups-1.3.9-cupsImageReadTiff.patch fixes an integer overflow
  in the "_cupsImageReadTIFF()" function CVE-2009-0163
  (CUPS STR #3031 and Novell/Suse Bugzilla bnc#485895).

Tue Jul 25 19:21:19 CEST 2006 - kssingvo@suse.de

- upgrade to version 1.2.2, which fixes several build, platform,
  notification, and printing bugs. Changes include:
    * Documentation updates
    * CUPS didn't know about alternate character set names for
      Asian text
    * The lpoptions -o and -r options did not work unless you
      specified a printer.
    * The lpoptions command incorrectly allowed users to set
      printer attributes like printer-type
    * httpWait() did not flush the write buffer, causing
      "bad request" errors when communicating with CUPS 1.1.x
      servers
    * Polling did not sanitize the printer description, location,
      or make and model strings like broadcasts did.
    * Polled printers did not show the server's default job-sheets
      option value.
    * The Samba password prompt was not properly localized
    * Added a German translation
    * The scheduler now creates self-signed SSL certficates
      automatically when using OpenSSL and CDSA for encryption,
      just as for GNU TLS.
    * The SNMP backend sporatically reported some printers
      as "unknown"
    * The scheduler now forces BrowseTimeout to be at least twice
      the BrowseInterval value and non-zero to avoid common
      configuration errors.
    * The scheduler incorrectly returned printer URIs of the form
      "ipp://server/printers/classname" for classes
    * Updated Japanese localization
    * The scheduler's SSL certificate/key directory was not created
      on installation
    * Added a mailto.conf man page and help page
    * The parallel and USB backends no longer wait for the printer
      to go on-line - this caused problems with certain printers
      that don't follow with the IEEE-1284 standard
    * The scheduler could crash on a reload when implicit classes
      were present
    * The IPP backend incorrectly used the CUPS_ENCRYPTION
      environment variable to determine the default encryption
      mode when printing
    * USB printing did not work on Solaris
    * The scheduler sorted job priorities in the wrong order
    * The scheduler did not automatically restart notifiers
      that exited or crashed
    * IPv6 support did not work on NetBSD

      ServerName was set to an IP address
    * Fixed the log message for BrowseRelay
    * Fixes to allow CUPS to compile on MirBSD
    * The scheduler incorrectly set the FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE
      environment variable
    * The pdftops filter incorrectly embedded a "produced by"
      comment, causing PDF printing not to work on some
      operating systems
    * Sending raw jobs from a client system could cause the
      client's scheduler to eventually crash
    * The scheduler now checks that the notifier exists prior
      to accepting a new subscription request.
    * The scheduler now reports the supported notify-recipient
      schemes based on the contents of the ServerBin/notifier
      directory.
    * Event notifications did not include the
      notify-sequence-number or other required attributes
    * Allow/Deny addresses of the form "11.22.33.*" did not work
      on Linux
    * cupsGetPPD() did not work if the scheduler was only
      listening on a domain socket
    * The scheduler could crash advertising a class
    * The scheduler could crash if the default printer was deleted
    * Added a new default CUPS raster format (v3) which does not
      compress the raster stream in order to provide the same
      cupsRasterReadPixels() and cupsRasterWritePixels()
      performance as CUPS 1.1.x.
    * The cupsaddsmb man page listed the wrong files for
      the CUPS driver.
    * Some configure --with options did not work
    * "Allow @IF(name)" didn't work if "name" wasn't the first
      network interface
    * The lpstat command did not use the correct character set
      when reporting the date and time

      the Windows PPD files properly, resulting in corrupt PPD
      files for the Windows client to use
    * The cupsd.conf man page didn't describe the Listen domain
      socket syntax
    * The scheduler no longer tries to support more than
      FD_SETSIZE file descriptors.
    * CDSA (encryption) support fixes for MacOS X.
    * The lppasswd program needs to be setuid to root to create
      and update the /etc/cups/passwd.md5 file
    * 32/64-bit library installation was broken
    * The USB backend now reports a "no such device" error
      when using the old filename-based USB URIs instead of
      the "success" error.
    * Increased the HTTP and IPP read timeouts to 10 seconds,
      as 1 second was too short on congested networks
    * The SNMP backend now uses the device description over the
      printer-make-and-model attribute when the attribute
      contains a generic name
    * Fixed another file descriptor leak when printing raw files
    * Raw queues were not shared via LDAP
    * The pstops filter didn't always embed PageSetup commands
      from the PPD file
    * "make install" didn't work if you disabled all of the
      localizations.
    * The scheduler didn't always choose the least costly filter.
    * Fixed parsing of IPv6 addresses in Allow, Deny, BrowseAllow,
      BrowseDeny, and BrowseRelay directives
    * Printers that were shared via LDAP did not get added to
      the LDAP server properly
    * LDAP browsing would crash the scheduler if a required value
      was missing
    * Special cases for the "localhost" hostname did not work,
      causing printing to not work when the /etc/hosts file
      did not contain a localhost entry
    * Updated the Spanish translation
    * Reverse-order page output was broken when N-up or landscape
      orientations were used
    * The parallel, serial, socket, and USB backends needed print
      data before they would report back-channel data, causing
      problems with several new drivers
