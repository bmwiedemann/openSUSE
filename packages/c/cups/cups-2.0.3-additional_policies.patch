+# The policy below is added by SUSE during build of our cups package.
+# The policy 'allowallforanybody' is totally open and insecure and therefore
+# it can only be used within an internal network where only trused users exist
+# and where the cupsd is not accessible at all from any external host, see
+# http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_and_SANE_Firewall_settings
+# Have in mind that any user who is allowed to do printer admin tasks
+# can change the print queues as he likes - e.g. send copies of confidental
+# print jobs from an internal network to any external destination, see
+# http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_in_a_Nutshell
