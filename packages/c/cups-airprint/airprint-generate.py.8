.SH NAME
airprint-generate.py - create Avahi service files for shared CUPS printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B airprint-generate.py
.I [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script will connect to a CUPS server and, for each printer configured and
marked as shared, it will generate a .service file for Avahi that is compatible
with Apple's AirPrint announcements. Any printer that can be configured to work
with CUPS can be used. Printers should not be configured in CUPS as raw, unless
the printer can natively print PDF; that is, CUPS needs to already be
configured with a PDF filter.

.SH REMARKS
DNSSD has a limit of 255 characters for a given txt-record; because of this,
the list of accepted PDLs will be truncated to fit. If you're curious to see
which ones are trimmed out of the list, run the script with the verbose flag.

If
.I python-lxml
is installed, .service files will be generated in a human readble format (I
wasn't able to get minidom's version to work acceptably).
