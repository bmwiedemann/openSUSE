The material in this package has been assembled from various resources on the
internet.

Marco Mornati has written a couple of blog pages which provide a step-by-step
guide to set up Airprint for Ubuntu. The content of this package is basically
an adaptation of those instructions for openSUSE:

A crucial tool mentioned in those blog posts is the python script to generate
Avahi service files for CUPS printers:
