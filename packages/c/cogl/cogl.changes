Thu Aug 16 21:14:34 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.11.2:
  + Add cogl_framebuffer_{fill,stroke}_path APIs consistent with
    other Cogl drawing APIs that replace cogl_path_fill/stroke().
  + Switch from using glib types such as guint32/guint16/guint8 to
    using equivalent stdint.h types.
  + Add a micro-benchmark for the journal
  + Optimize the matrix stack so we can take immutable references
    of a matrix stack for logging into the journal more efficiently
    than having to copy large matrices for each journaled rectangle
  + Add COGL_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,MICRO} macros and
    COGL_VERSION_CHECK macros for applications to test what version
    of Cogl they are compiled against.
  + Allow creation of non power of two (npot) CoglTexture2D
    textures with only basic npot support, not including repeating
    or mipmap support.
  + Enable use of the GL_STREAM_DRAW buffer update hint on GLES 2.0
  + Fix building Cogl with --disable-gl
  + Add support for the WebOS version of SDL which supports access
    to GLES 1.1 and GLES 2.0
  + Add cogl_matrix_init_translation to provide a more efficient
    way to initialize a matrix representing a translation without
    need to multiply matrices.
  + Various documentation fixes for CoglQuaternion and CoglEular
  + Updates for the MSVC build
  + Add GPU architecture detection capabilities so we can
    differentiate drivers based on the hardware vendor, and the
    actual architecture of the GPU, such as deferred vs immediate
    mode.
  + Fix framebuffer initialization to ensure swaps are throttled by
    default.
  + Fix flushing of the depth state for some cases.
  + Ported test-atlas-migration to be a standalone Cogl test
  + Add GLES 2.0 API integration support so that existing GLES 2.0
    based code can easily be integrated within Cogl based
    applications. For example this is being used by webkit-clutter
    to add WebGL support.
  + Add an optional libcogl-gles2 sub-library that provides a full
    GLES 2.0 api api to really lower the barrier as much as possible
    for being able to integrate existing GLES 2.0 based code into
    Cogl applications.
  + Add a Cogl GLES 2.0 Gears example application to test the GLES
    2.0 integration support.
  + Fix a bug with disabling of Cogl's debugging features
  + Add api to directly convert a Eular to a Quaternion.
  + Improve the wireframe debug option to work when a vertex shader
    is  in use.
  + Add support for SDL2 which supports GLES 2.0
  + Support the original GLSL extensions which had some different
    function names.
  + Avoid using eglGetProcAddress for core symbols which isn't
    allowed by the EGL spec and causes problems on Android.
  + Add cogl_android_bitmap_new_from_asset() API to load images
    from Android assets.
  + Add support for resizable onscreen framebuffers.
  + Avoid implicitly including the EGL headers when including
    cogl.h
  + Add cogl.conf and environment variables to allow disabling the
    use of specific GL extensions; for example if the
    implementation is known to be buggy on a given system.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#660617, bgo#672533, bgo#673137, bgo#674208,
    bgo#675119, bgo#677078, bgo#678316, bgo#680124, bgo#681285

- Update to version 1.9.8:
  + Various Visual Studio build fixes
  + Correctly check for GL_EXT_packed_depth_stencil and support
    using GL_OES_packed_depth_stencil on GLES2
  + Correctly handle pre-multiplied alpha conversions when reading
    back texture data.
  + Added cogl_renderer_{get,set}_driver functions so the
    underlying driver can be chosen programmatically.
  + Revamped the conformance testing framework so that it
    automatically runs every test against GLES2 as well as GL and
    also against all of the pipeline backends and with npot
    textures disabled.
  + Add a conformance test for reading back an RGBA texture as
    alpha-only
  + Added support for converting between all of Cogl's supported
    pixel formats including pre-multiplied alpha conversions.
  + Added conformance tests for converting to and from all of the
    supported formats.
  + Added a public cogl_framebuffer_read_pixels_into_bitmap()
    function which will effective read into a CoglPixelBuffer.
  + CoglPixelBuffer was changed to no longer have associated width,
    height and format information and instead we will rely on
    CoglBitmap to track that informations.
  + Added public cogl_bitmap_get_{width,height,format,rowstride}
    API
  + Added a public accessor for the underlying pixel buffer of a
    CoglBitmap.

- Rename libcogl8 to libcogl9, following upstream soversion change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 22 08:16:48 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.9.6:
  + New conformance tests or tests ported from Clutter.
  + New public experimental functions.
  + Added cogl_kms_renderer_get_kms_fd to get the KMS file
    descriptor.
  + Bug fixed in the KMS support where it would crash on cleanup if
    it couldn't save the CRTC state.
  + Bug fixed in the Wayland compositor support where it would leak
    EGLImages when creating a texture from a buffer
  + The swap_buffer callback in GLX is now delayed until
    cogl_poll_dispatch is called so that apps can handle it more
    predictably.
  + Fixes for bugs with pipelines that are trying to use a layer
    with a NULL texture.
  + New cogl_framebuffer_* API for drawing directly to the
    framebuffer without having to push the framebuffer.
  + Most of the _EXP suffixes have been removed from the
    experimental API symbols in the hope that the gtk-doc unstable
    annotation will be enough to distinguish these.
  + Add a COGL_DEBUG=winsys option
  + CoglBuffer and CoglPrimitive now take an explicit CoglContext
    argument in their constructor.
  + Updates to the MSVC build support.
  + Add cogl_pipeline_set_layer_null_texture().
  + Fix some bugs where Cogl was assuming there is a direct mapping
    between the pipeline layer number and the GL texture unit
    number.
  + In snippets, there are now always builtin sampler uniforms for
    every layer of the pipeline.
  + The texture lookup snippet hook now gets passed the sampler for
    the unit.
  + Some public constants for CoglPixelFormat have been removed
    (COGL_UNPREMULT_MASK, COGL_UNORDERED_MASK and
    COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_{24,32}).
  + 30-bit pixel formats added.
  + COGL_DEBUG=wireframes now correctly renders primitives using
    vertex shader snippets.
  + cogl_framebuffer_swap_buffers and friends have been renamed to
    cogl_onscreen_swap_buffers.
  + If the experimental 2.0 API is requested, as far as possible
    the headers for the 1.0 API are no longer included. Define
    COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_API instead if you want to mix both
    APIs.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#660188, bgo#668385, bgo#668856, bgo#668913,
    bgo#669368, bgo#669785.
- Remove xz BuildRequires now that it comes for free in the build
  system.
- Rename libcogl7 to libcogl8, following upstream soversion change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 18 07:00:09 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Add Mesa-devel Requires to devel subpackage as cogl-defines.h has
  an include for GL/gl.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 17 07:24:07 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.9.4:
  + Visual Studio 2008/2010 project files have landed.
  + A basic KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) backend was added so we can
    run fullscreen Cogl applications without X11 on Linux.
  + EGL platforms can now be selected at runtime.
  + cogl_matrix_orthographic() was added as a replacement for
    cogl_matrix_ortho() since the OpenGL style of arguments for
    cogl_matrix_ortho() wasn't consistent with the rest of the Cogl
    API.
  + Experimental cogl_framebuffer apis were added for manipulating
    the per-framebuffer modelview matrix stack.
  + Experimental cogl_framebuffer apis were added for manipulating
    the per-framebuffer clip stacks.
  + The internal _cogl_framebuffer_flush_state() function was
    optimized to do a better job of bailing out when no framebuffer
    state has changed, and when state has changed the cost should
    now scale by the number of changes made instead of scaling by
    the total range of framebuffer state that Cogl tracks.
  + Internally we finally removed _cogl_enable() which won't mean
    much to most people but makes the maintainers happy.
  + We added an experimental CoglSnippets api aiming to greatly
    simplify how developers can incorporate snippets of GLSL code
    into the pipeline.
  + We've updated Cogl's client side Wayland support
  + We've updated Cogl's compositor side Wayland support, including
    updating the example cogland compositor.
  + We added an SDL window system backend for Cogl, which provides
    a simple, portable way to play with Cogl as a standalone
    graphics API with basic support for input events available from
    SDL.
  + We added mainloop integration support to Cogl.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#650020, bgo#665190, bgo#665604, bgo#665722,
    bgo#665723, bgo#667009.

  typelib-1_0-Cogl-1_0 and typelib-1_0-CoglPango-1_0.
- Add typelib-1_0-Cogl-1_0 and typelib-1_0-CoglPango-1_0 Requires
  to devel subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 22 18:35:40 UTC 2011 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.9.2:
  + Ported more conformance tests from Clutter to be standalone
    Cogl tests.
  + Adds experimental support for EXT_discard_framebuffer extension
    which is important for good performance on PowerVR graphics HW.
  + Adds experimental API to enable clipping to the silhouette of
    an arbitrary 2D CoglPrimitive.
  + Make the CoglTexture2DSliced API directly available as
    experimental API.
  + Various API Extensions and enhancements.
  + Ship a standalone cogl-xlib.h that must be included manually
    for any xlib specific api because the Xlib headers so many
    numerous badly namespaced symbols that it's not desireable to
    include them unless absolutely required.
  + Updated the Wayland support to work with the latest upstream
    interfaces.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#656755, bgo#658700, bgo#660184, bgo#660387,
    bgo#660617, bgo#660986, bgo#661019, bgo#661174, bgo#662184,
    bgo#662542, bgo#663578, bgo#663628.
  + Updated translations.
- Rename libcogl5 to libcogl6, following upstream soversion change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 17 20:39:07 CEST 2011 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8.2:
  + Fix a crash while generating ARBfp code with layers containing
    a NULL texture.
  + Improvements to the mingw-fetch-dependencies script to work
    without first needing to find a copy of config.guess.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#660184, bgo#660387, bgo#660986.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 21 17:27:20 UTC 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  + Started porting Cogl conformance tests from Clutter to be
    standalone Cogl tests including tests for depth-state and
    backface culling.
  + Added a new color mask conformance test
  + We no longer implicitly define COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_2_0_API
    in the cogl-2.0-experimental.pc file cflags because the way
    pkgconfig works makes it hard to then consume libraries
    depending on cogl-2.0-experimental.pc with Clutter.
  + Made progress re-factoring cogl-pipeline.c to be more
    maintainable by starting to split the code up into more
    manageable pieces.
  + We now bind the locale dir for the Cogl domain during init.
  + We now track backface culling state as part of CoglPipeline.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#656442, bgo#658092, bgo#658333, bgo#658700,
    bgo#659029, bgo#659360.
- Rename libcogl2 to libcogl5, following upstream soversion change.

Sat Sep 17 23:27:24 UTC 2011 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Remove redundant tags/sections from specfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  5 21:06:38 UTC 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.7.8:
  + Getters for the display and renderer associated with context
  + Getter for the number of supported texture units during
    fragment processing.
  + Optimizations for the GLSL codegen for fragment processing so
    we can ignore redundant layers - if for example the "REPLACE"
    function is used for layer N then computing anything for
    previous layers is redundant. Also if texture combining needs
    to sample the same texture multiple times we now re-use the
    same sample instead of repeating it.
  + Optimize texture uploads to a texture atlas on GLES by avoiding
    lots of redundant format conversions.
  + Relax the requirement to need braces around blend factors when
    using the CoglBlendString syntax. Braces are only needed for
    factors involving a subtraction like "(1 - SRC_COLOR[A])"
  + Adds API for querying the format of a CoglFramebuffer
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#656426, bgo#656441, bgo#656587, bgo#657347,
    bgo#657840, bgo#656809.

  + Fix using TEXTURE_n as the source for a layer combine
  + Some fixes for the WGL backend
  + Add experimental API to upload a texture subregion from a
    CoglBuffer
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#655026, bgo#655216, bgo#655228, bgo#655355,
    bog#655400, bgo#655412, bgo#655510, bgo#655556, bgo#655723,
    bgo#655724, bgo#656303, bgo#655792, bgo#655791.
- Add xz BuildRequires to be able to decompress the tar.xz source.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 27 15:51:21 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Add Mesa Requires to libcogl2: since the GL library is
  dynamically loaded now, there is no automatic Requires for it.
  Mesa provides all the libraries that can be used, so it's the
  right explicit Requires to add.
- Add baselibs.conf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 20 22:15:01 CEST 2011 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.7.4:
  + Optimize pipeline unparent operation using embedded lists
    instead of using GList API.
  + Remove the old matrix operation code we had before pulling in
    the mesa based code.
  + Expose cogl_framebuffer_get_red/green/blue/alpha bits to query
    the precision for a framebuffer's color channels.
  + Numerous reference manual updates
  + Fix some memory leaks in CoglPipeline.
  + Fix some EGL winsys issues that weren't captured in bugzilla.
  + Switch to dynamically loading libGL, libGLESv2 or
    libGLES[v1]_CM at runtime so it's possible to distribute a
    libcogl that can choose to work with any of these at runtime.
  + Clean up lots of inconsistencies with platform specific APIs.
  + Remove cogl_set_default_context from experimental 2.0 api,
    since we are aiming to remove the default context for 2.0
  + Ensure the experimental 2.0 reference manual gets a unique
    DOC_MODULE name so that distro's trying to package cogl don't
    end up installing the 1.x and 2.0 manuals to the same location.
  + Add a program cache for the GLSL backend.
  + Adds dither_enable getter and setter API for CoglFramebuffer so
    that Clutter doesn't need to use the GL API directly when
    picking.
  + Use MESA_pack_invert extension in cogl_read_pixels to avoid
    needing to manually flip pixel data read in bottom-up order to
    a top-down order.
  + Fix the hello example to actually clear the framebuffer at the
    start of the frame instead of unintentionally relying on the
    driver to have cleared the framebuffer.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#652514, bgo#654440, bgo#654718, bgo#654593.
- Rename libcogl1 to libcogl2, following to soname change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  2 09:01:18 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.7.2:
  + Add an example program to draw a 3D crate
  + Add experimental API to get and set the viewport on a
    framebuffer without going through the implicit context.
  + Add API to select the winsys backend without having to use an
    environment variable.
  + Various documentation fixes.
  + Add winsys-specific typesafe APIs to replace the old
    cogl_renderer_handle_native_event functions.
  + Rename platform-specific APIs so that we consistently have
    cogl_<platform>_symbol_name instead of
    cogl_symbol_name_<platform>.
  + Fixed building against GLES.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#652672, bgo#653615, bgo#653229, bgo#653231.
- Rename libcogl0 to libcogl1 after soversion bump.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 15 10:49:14 CEST 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- New package (version 1.7.0). Cogl got split out of the clutter
  source code.
