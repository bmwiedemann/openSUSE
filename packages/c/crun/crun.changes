Wed Mar  6 10:06:50 UTC 2024 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 1.14.4

* crun-1.14.4

- linux: fix mount of file with recursive flags.  Do not assume it is
  a directory, but check the source type.

* crun-1.14.3

- follow up for 1.14.2.  Drop the version check for each command.

* crun-1.14.2

- crun: drop check for OCI version.  A recent bump in the OCI runtime
  specs caused crun to fail with every config file.  Just drop the
  check since it doesn't add any value.

* crun-1.14.1

- there was recently a security vulnerability (CVE-2024-21626) in runc
  that allowed a malicious user to chdir(2) to a /proc/*/fd entry that is
  outside the container rootfs.  While crun is not affected directly,
  harden chdir by validating that we are still inside the container
  rootfs.
- container: attempt to close all the files before execv(2).
  if we leak any fd, it prevents execv to gain access to files outside
  the container rootfs through /proc/self/fd/$fd.
- fix a regression caused by 1.14 when installing the ebpf filter on a
  kernel older than 5.11.
- cgroup, systemd: fix segfault if the resources block is not specified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 27 16:21:04 UTC 2024 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 1.14:
  * build: drop dependency on libgcrypt. Use blake3 to compute the cache key.
  * cpuset: don't clobber parent cgroup value when writing the cpuset value.
  * linux: force umask(0). It ensures that the mknodat syscall is not affected by the umask of the calling process, 
    allowing file permissions to be set as specified in the OCI configuration.
  * ebpf: do not require MEMLOCK for eBPF programs. This requirement was relaxed in Linux 5.11.

- update to 1.13:
  * src: use O_CLOEXEC for all open/openat calls
  * cgroup v1: use "max" when pids limit < 0.
  * improve error message when idmap mount fails because the underlying file system has no support for it.
  * libcrun: fix compilation when building without libseccomp and libcap.
  * fix relative idmapped mount when using the custom annotation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 13:41:35 UTC 2023 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 1.12:

  * add new WebAssembly handler: spin.
  * systemd: fallback to system bus if session bus is not available.
  * configure the cpu rt and cpuset controllers before joining them to
    avoid running temporarily the workload on the wrong cpus.
  * preconfigure the cpuset with required resources instead of using the
    parent's set.  This prevents needless churn in the kernel as it
    tracks which CPUs have load balancing disabled.
  * try attr/<lsm>/* before the attr/* files.  Writes to the attr/*
    files may fail if apparmor is not the first "major" LSM in the list
    of loaded LSMs (e.g. lsm=apparmor,bpf vs lsm=bpf,apparmor).

- New upstream release 1.11.2:

  * fix a regression caused by 1.11.1 where the process crashes if there
    are no CPU limits configured on cgroup v1. (bsc#1217590)
  * fix error code check for the ptsname_r function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  6 10:19:58 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.11.1:
  * force a remount operation with bind mounts from the host to
    correctly set all the mount flags.
  * cgroup: honor cpu burst.
  * systemd: set CPUQuota and CPUPeriod on the scope cgroup.
  * linux: append tmpfs mode if missing for mounts.  This is the
    same behavior of runc.
  * cgroup: always use the user session for rootless.
  * support for Intel Resource Director Technology (RDT).
  * new mount option "copy-symlink".  When provided for a mount,
    if the source is a symlink, then it is copied in the container
    instead of attempting a mount.
  * linux: open mounts before setgroups if in a userns.  This
    solves a problem where a directory that was previously
    accessible to the user, become inaccessible after setgroups
    causing the bind mount to fail.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 12 08:02:18 UTC 2023 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 1.9.2:

  * cgroup: reset the inherited cpu affinity after moving to cgroup. Old kernels
    do that automatically, but new kernels remember the affinity that was set
    before the cgroup move, so we need to reset it in order to honor the cpuset
    configuration.

- New upstream release 1.9.1:

  * utils: ignore ENOTSUP when chmod a symlink. It fixes a problem on Linux 6.6
    that always refuses chmod on a symlink.
  * build: fix build on CentOS 7
  * linux: add new fallback when mount fails with EBUSY, so that there is not an
    additional tmpfs mount if not needed.
  * utils: improve error message when a directory cannot be created as a
    component of the path is already existing as a non directory.

- Only build with wasmedge on x86_64 & aarch64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 11 11:29:21 UTC 2023 - Alexandre Vicenzi <alexandre.vicenzi@suse.com>

- Add crun-wasm symlink for platform 'wasi/wasm'

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 13 06:04:30 UTC 2023 - Danish Prakash <danish.prakash@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9:
  * linux: support arbitrary idmapped mounts.
  * linux: add support for "ridmap" mount option to support recursive
    idmapped mounts.
  * crun delete: call systemd's reset-failed.
  * linux: fix check for oom_score_adj.
  * features: Support mountExtensions.
  * linux: correctly handle unknown signal string when it doesn't start with
    a digit.
  * linux: do not attempt to join again already joined namespace.
  * wasmer: use latest wasix API.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  5 11:41:14 UTC 2023 - Alexandre Vicenzi <alexandre.vicenzi@suse.com>

- Enable WasmEdge support to run Wasm compat containers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 14 12:55:14 UTC 2023 - Danish Prakash <danish.prakash@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8.6:
  * crun: new command "crun features".
  * linux: fix handling of idmapped mounts when the container joins an
    existing PID namespace.
  * linux: support io_priority from the OCI specs.
  * linux: handle correctly the case where the status file is not written
    yet for a container.
  * crun: fix segfault for "ps" when the container is not using cgroups.
  * cgroup: allow setting swap to 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 14 12:55:19 UTC 2023 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8.5:
  * scheduler: use definition from the OCI configuration file
    instead of the custom label that is now dropped and not
    supported anymore.
  * cgroup: fix creating cgroup under "domain threaded".
  * cgroup, systemd: set the memory limit on the system scope.
  * restore tty settings from the correct file descriptor.  It was
    previously restoring the settings from the wrong file
    descriptor causing the tty settings  to be changed on the
    calling terminal.
  * criu: check if the criu_join_ns_add function exists.
    Fix a segfault with new versions of CRIU.
  * linux: do not precreate devs with euid > 0.  Fix creating
    devices when running the OCI runtime as non root user.
  * linux: improve PID detection on systems that lack pidfd.
    While there is still a window of time that the PID could be
    recycled, now it is now reduced to a minimum.
  * criu: fix memory leak.
  * logging: improve error message when dlopen fails.

- Changes from 1.8.4:
  * drop custom annotation to set the time namespace and use
    the OCI specs instead.
  * cgroup: workaround cpu quota/period issue with v1.  Sometimes
    setting CPU quota period fails when a new period is lower,
    and a parent cgroup has CPU quota limit set.
  * cgroup: fix set quota to -1 on cgroup v1.
  * criu: drop loading unused functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 28 10:27:06 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.8.3:
  * update: initialize the rt limits only on cgroup v1.
  * lua bindings for libcrun.
  * wasmedge: add current directory to preopen paths.
  * linux: inherit parent mount flags when making a path masked.
  * libcrun: custom annotation to set the scheduler for the
    container process.
  * cgroup: fallback to blkio.bfq files if blkio is not available
    on cgroup v1.
  * cgroup: initialize rt limits when using systemd.
  * tty: chown the tty to the exec user instead of the user
    specified to create the container.
  * cgroup: fallback to create cgroupfs as sibling of the current
    cgroup if there is none specified and it cannot be created in
    the root cgroup.
- add keyring for GPG validation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 20:14:52 UTC 2023 - Niels Abspoel <aboe76@gmail.com>

- Update to 1.8.1
  * linux: idmapped mounts expect the same configuration as
    the user namespace mappings. Before they were expecting the inverted
    mapping. It is a breaking change, but the behavior was aligned
    to what runc will do as well.
  * krun: always allow /dev/kvm in the cgroup configuration.
  * handlers: disable exec for handlers that do not support it.
  * selinux: allow setting fscontext using a custom annotation.
  * cgroup: reset systemd unit if start fails.
  * cgroup: rmdir the entire systemd scope. It fixes a leak on cgroupv1.
  * cgroup: always delete the cgroup on errors.
    On some errors it could have been leaked before.

- changes from 1.8
  * linux: precreate devices on the host.
  * cgroup: support cpuset mounted with noprefix.
  * linux: mount the source cgroup if cgroupns=host.
  * libcrun: don't clone self from read-only mount.
  * build: fix build without dlfcn.h.
  * linux: set PR_SET_DUMPABLE.
  * utils: fix applying AppArmor profile.
  * linux: write setgroups=deny when mapping a single uid/gid.
  * cgroup: fix enter cgroupv1 mount on RHEL 7.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  7 09:24:19 UTC 2022 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to 1.7.2:
  * criu: hardcode library name to libcriu.so.2.
  * cgroup: always enable all controllers, even if the cgroup was
    already joined. Regression caused by crun-1.7.

  * container: with cgroupfs use clone3 to join directly the target
    cgroup.
  * linux: create parent directories for created devices with mode
    0755.
  * wasm: inherit environment variables in the WasmEdge handler.

- Update to 1.6
  * runc compatibility: -v now prints the version string.
  * build: fix build with glibc 2.36.
  * container: drop intermediate userns custom feature.
  * cgroup: change the delegate cgroup semantic so that the cgroup
    is created in the container payload after the cgroup namespace
    is created.
  * seccomp: use helper process to send file descriptor to the listener
    socket. It enables to be notified on every syscall without hanging
    the main process.
  * linux: add a fallback to using kill(2) if pidfd_send_signal(2)
    fails with ENOSYS.

    environment if there is no environment block specified in the
    OCI configuration.
  ° exec: fix double free when using --apparmor and
    --process-label.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 12 08:59:23 UTC 2022 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- It'd be nice to run the test suite with %check. It however, still
  does not work properly inside OBS workers. Add it commented and
