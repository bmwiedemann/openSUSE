- It'd be nice to run the test suite with %check. It however, still
  does not work properly inside OBS workers. Add it commented and
  explain it

- fix bsc#1197871, CVE-2022-27650 (as 1.4.4 contains the fixes itself)
- update and fixup dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  2 08:58:05 UTC 2021 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Add libprotobuf-c-devel as an explicit dependency, for fixing
  the build;
- Get rid of rpmlintrc, as it's no longer needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 23 15:22:18 UTC 2021 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- make libkrun support conditional, so we can have crun (without
  libkrun, of course) on all arches, which may help with
  bsc#1188914.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  6 13:37:49 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Drop libkrun-dlopen.patch and adapt to libkrun new package name,
  it is a plugin, not a regular shared library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  6 09:55:53 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Add libkrun-dlopen.patch: use soname when dlopening libkrun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - seccomp: drop SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG by default.
  - seccomp: report correct action in error message.
  - apply SELinux label to keyring.

  - close_range fallbacks to close on EPERM.
  - report error if the cgroup path was set and the cgroup could not be
    joined.
  - on exec, honor additional_gids from the process spec, not the
    container definition.
  - spec: add cgroup ns if on cgroup v2.
  - systemd: support array of strings for cgroup annotation.
  - join all the cgroup v1 controllers.
  - raise a warning when newuidmap/newgidmap fail.
  - handle eBPF access(dev_name, F_OK) call correctly.
  - fix some memory leaks on errors when libcrun is used by a long

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 19 02:18:44 UTC 2021 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Since we're building with libkrun support, let's enable only the
  arch-es for which we do have libkrun

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 13 01:12:19 UTC 2021 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Suppress the (false positive) rpmlint warning

-------------------------------------------------------------------
