  <title>Free Chinese-English Dictionary in EDICT Format</title>
  <description>This is a free Chinese-English dictionary that can be used, for
example, with Gjiten.

The objective of the CEDICT project is to create an online,
downloadable (as opposed to searchable-only) public-domain
Chinese-English dictionary. For the most part, the project is modelled
on Jim Breen's highly successful EDICT (Japanese-English dictionary)
project and is intended to be a collaborative effort with users
providing entries and corrections to the main file.</description>
