Subject: [PATCH] Use only half of detected free memory on systems without
 swap.

As tests shows, limiting used Argon2 memory to free memory on
systems without swap is still not enough.
Use just half of it, this should bring needed margin while
still use Argon2.

Note, for very-low memory constrained systems user should
avoid memory-hard PBKDF (IOW manually select PBKDF2), we
do not do this automatically.
