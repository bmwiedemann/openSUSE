Tue Dec 27 10:30:22 UTC 2022 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.com>

- Replace transitional %usrmerged macro with regular version check (boo#1206798)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 28 13:51:24 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- cryptsetup 2.6.0:
  * Introduce support for handling macOS FileVault2 devices (FVAULT2).
  * libcryptsetup: no longer use global memory locking through mlockall()
  * libcryptsetup: process priority is increased only for key derivation
    (PBKDF) calls.
  * Add new LUKS keyslot context handling functions and API.
  * The volume key may now be extracted using a passphrase, keyfile, or
    token. For LUKS devices, it also returns the volume key after
    a successful crypt_format call.
  * Fix --disable-luks2-reencryption configuration option.
  * cryptsetup: Print a better error message and warning if the format
    produces an image without space available for data.
  * Print error if anti-forensic LUKS2 hash setting is not available.
    If the specified hash was not available, activation quietly failed.
  * Fix internal crypt segment compare routine if the user
    specified cipher in kernel format (capi: prefix).
  * cryptsetup: Add token unassign action.
    This action allows removing token binding on specific keyslot.
  * veritysetup: add support for --use-tasklets option.
    This option sets try_verify_in_tasklet kernel dm-verity option
    (available since Linux kernel 6.0) to allow some performance
    improvement on specific systems.
  * Provide pkgconfig Require.private settings.
    While we do not completely provide static build on udev systems,
    it helps produce statically linked binaries in certain situations.
  * Always update automake library files if autogen.sh is run.
    For several releases, we distributed older automake scripts by mistake.
  * reencryption: Fix user defined moved segment size in LUKS2 decryption.
    The --hotzone-size argument was ignored in cases where the actual data
    size was less than the original LUKS2 data offset.
  * Delegate FIPS mode detection to configured crypto backend.
    System FIPS mode check no longer depends on /etc/system-fips file.
  * Update documentation, including FAQ and man pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 13 15:52:52 UTC 2022 - Luca Boccassi <luca.boccassi@gmail.com>

- Add virtual provides for 'integritysetup' and 'veritysetup' to match
  package names provided by Fedora/RHEL, to allow the same set of
  dependencies to be used across all RPM distributions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 22 08:38:16 UTC 2022 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- cryptsetup 2.5.0:
  * Split manual pages into per-action pages and use AsciiDoc format. 
  * Remove cryptsetup-reencrypt tool from the project and move reencryption
    to already existing "cryptsetup reencrypt" command.
    If you need to emulate the old cryptsetup-reencrypt binary, use simple
    wrappers script running "exec cryptsetup reencrypt $@".
  * LUKS2: implement --decryption option that allows LUKS removal.
  * Fix decryption operation with --active-name option and restrict
    it to be used only with LUKS2.
  * Do not refresh reencryption digest when not needed.
    This should speed up the reencryption resume process.
  * Store proper resilience data in LUKS2 reencrypt initialization.
    Resuming reencryption now does not require specification of resilience
    type parameters if these are the same as during initialization.
  * Properly wipe the unused area after reencryption with datashift in
    the forward direction.
  * Check datashift value against larger sector size.
    For example, it could cause an issue if misaligned 4K sector appears
    during decryption.
  * Do not allow sector size increase reencryption in offline mode.
  * Do not allow dangerous sector size change during reencryption.
  * Ask the user for confirmation before resuming reencryption.
  * Do not resume reencryption with conflicting parameters.
  * Add --force-offline-reencrypt option.
  * Do not allow nested encryption in LUKS reencrypt.
  * Support all options allowed with luksFormat with encrypt action.
  * Add resize action to integritysetup.
  * Remove obsolete dracut plugin reencryption example.
  * Fix possible keyslot area size overflow during conversion to LUKS2.
  * Allow use of --header option for cryptsetup close.
  * Fix activation of LUKS2 device with integrity and detached header.
  * Add ZEROOUT IOCTL support for crypt_wipe API call.
  * VERITY: set loopback sector size according to dm-verity block sizes.
  * veritysetup: dump device sizes.
  * LUKS2 token: prefer token PIN query before passphrase in some cases.
    When a user provides --token-type or specific --token-id, a token PIN
    query is preferred to a passphrase query.
  * LUKS2 token: allow tokens to be replaced with --token-replace option
    for cryptsetup token command.
  * LUKS2 token: do not continue operation when interrupted in PIN prompt.
  * Add --progress-json parameter to utilities.
  * Add support for --key-slot option in luksResume action.
- move man pages to separate subpackage
- drop backports handling

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 14 19:19:43 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- cryptsetup 2.4.3:
  * Fix possible attacks against data confidentiality through
    LUKS2 online reencryption extension crash recovery
    CVE-2021-4122, boo#1194469
  * Add configure option --disable-luks2-reencryption to completely
    disable LUKS2 reencryption code.
  * Improve internal metadata validation code for reencryption
    metadata
  * Add updated documentation for LUKS2 On-Disk Format
    Specification version 1.1.0
  * Fix support for bitlk (BitLocker compatible) startup key with
    new  metadata entry introduced in Windows 11
  * Fix space restriction for LUKS2 reencryption with data shift

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 18 20:15:22 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- cryptsetup 2.4.2:
  * Fix possible large memory allocation if LUKS2 header size is
    invalid.
  * Fix memory corruption in debug message printing LUKS2
    checksum.
  * veritysetup: remove link to the UUID library for the static
    build.
  * Remove link to pwquality library for integritysetup and
    veritysetup. These tools do not read passphrases.
  * OpenSSL3 backend: avoid remaining deprecated calls in API.
    Crypto backend no longer use API deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0
  * Check if kernel device-mapper create device failed in an early
    phase. This happens when a concurrent creation of device-mapper
    devices meets in the very early state.
  * Do not set compiler optimization flag for Argon2 KDF if the
    memory wipe is implemented in libc.
  * Do not attempt to unload LUKS2 tokens if external tokens are
    disabled. This allows building a static binary with
    --disable-external-tokens.
  * LUKS convert: also check sysfs for device activity.
    If udev symlink is missing, code fallbacks to sysfs scan to
    prevent data corruption for the active device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 15:23:52 UTC 2021 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  2 12:39:40 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Use LUKS2 as default format on Tumbleweed.
  It provides some additional features which other tools

  LUKS2 volumes meanwhile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  1 12:50:25 UTC 2021 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- cryptsetup 2.3.6:
  * integritysetup: Fix possible dm-integrity mapping table truncation.
  * cryptsetup: Backup header can be used to activate TCRYPT device.
    Use --header option to specify the header.
  * cryptsetup: Avoid LUKS2 decryption without detached header.
    This feature will be added later and is currently not supported.
  * Additional fixes and workarounds for common warnings produced
    by some static analysis tools (like gcc-11 analyzer) and additional
    code hardening.
  * Fix standalone libintl detection for compiled tests.
  * Add Blake2b and Blake2s hash support for crypto backends.
    Kernel and gcrypt crypto backend support all variants.
    OpenSSL supports only Blake2b-512 and Blake2s-256.
    Crypto backend supports kernel notation e.g. "blake2b-512".

- Update to 2.3.4:
  * Fix a possible out-of-bounds memory write while validating LUKS2 data
    segments metadata (CVE-2020-14382, boo#1176128).
  * Ignore reported optimal IO size if not aligned to minimal page size.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 28 18:43:29 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- Update to 2.3.3:
  * Fix BitLocker compatible device access that uses native 4kB
    sectors
  * Support large IV count (--iv-large-sectors) cryptsetup option
    for plain device mapping
  * Fix a memory leak in BitLocker compatible handling
  * Allow EBOIV (Initialization Vector algorithm) use
  * LUKS2: Require both keyslot cipher and key size option, do
    not fail silently
- includes changes from 2.3.2:
  * Add option to dump content of LUKS2 unbound keyslot
  * Add support for discards (TRIM) for standalone dm-integrity
    devices (Kernel 5.7) via --allow-discards, not for LUKS2
  * Fix cryptsetup-reencrypt to work on devices that do not allow
    direct-io device access.
  * Fix a crash in the BitLocker-compatible code error path
  * Fix Veracrypt compatible support for longer (>64 bytes)
    passphrases

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  2 14:27:18 UTC 2020 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- Split translations to -lang package
- New version to 2.3.1
  * Support VeraCrypt 128 bytes passwords.
    VeraCrypt now allows passwords of maximal length 128 bytes
    (compared to legacy TrueCrypt where it was limited by 64 bytes).
  * Strip extra newline from BitLocker recovery keys
    There might be a trailing newline added by the text editor when
    the recovery passphrase was passed using the --key-file option.
  * Detect separate libiconv library.
    It should fix compilation issues on distributions with iconv
    implemented in a separate library.
  * Various fixes and workarounds to build on old Linux distributions.
  * Split lines with hexadecimal digest printing for large key-sizes.
  * Do not wipe the device with no integrity profile.
    With --integrity none we performed useless full device wipe.
  * Workaround for dm-integrity kernel table bug.
    Some kernels show an invalid dm-integrity mapping table
    if superblock contains the "recalculate" bit. This causes
    integritysetup to not recognize the dm-integrity device.
    Integritysetup now specifies kernel options such a way that
    even on unpatched kernels mapping table is correct.
  * Print error message if LUKS1 keyslot cannot be processed.
    If the crypto backend is missing support for hash algorithms
    used in PBKDF2, the error message was not visible.
  * Properly align LUKS2 keyslots area on conversion.
    If the LUKS1 payload offset (data offset) is not aligned
    to 4 KiB boundary, new LUKS2 keyslots area in now aligned properly.
  * Validate LUKS2 earlier on conversion to not corrupt the device
    if binary keyslots areas metadata are not correct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  4 07:59:24 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 2.3.0 (include release notes for 2.2.0)
  * BITLK (Windows BitLocker compatible) device access
  * Veritysetup now supports activation with additional PKCS7 signature
    of root hash through --root-hash-signature option.
  * Integritysetup now calculates hash integrity size according to algorithm
    instead of requiring an explicit tag size.
  * Integritysetup now supports fixed padding for dm-integrity devices.
  * A lot of fixes to online LUKS2 reecryption.
  * Add crypt_resume_by_volume_key() function to libcryptsetup.
    If a user has a volume key available, the LUKS device can be resumed
    directly using the provided volume key.
    No keyslot derivation is needed, only the key digest is checked.
  * Implement active device suspend info.
    Add CRYPT_ACTIVATE_SUSPENDED bit to crypt_get_active_device() flags
    that informs the caller that device is suspended (luksSuspend).
  * Allow --test-passphrase for a detached header.
    Before this fix, we required a data device specified on the command
    line even though it was not necessary for the passphrase check.
  * Allow --key-file option in legacy offline encryption.
    The option was ignored for LUKS1 encryption initialization.
  * Export memory safe functions.
    To make developing of some extensions simpler, we now export
    functions to handle memory with proper wipe on deallocation.
  * Fail crypt_keyslot_get_pbkdf for inactive LUKS1 keyslot.
  * Add optional global serialization lock for memory hard PBKDF.
  * Abort conversion to LUKS1 with incompatible sector size that is
    not supported in LUKS1.
  * Report error (-ENOENT) if no LUKS keyslots are available. User can now
    distinguish between a wrong passphrase and no keyslot available.
  * Fix a possible segfault in detached header handling (double free).
  * Add integritysetup support for bitmap mode introduced in Linux kernel 5.2.
  * The libcryptsetup now keeps all file descriptors to underlying device
    open during the whole lifetime of crypt device context to avoid excessive
    scanning in udev (udev run scan on every descriptor close).
  * The luksDump command now prints more info for reencryption keyslot
    (when a device is in-reencryption).
  * New --device-size parameter is supported for LUKS2 reencryption.
  * New --resume-only parameter is supported for LUKS2 reencryption.
  * The repair command now tries LUKS2 reencryption recovery if needed.
  * If reencryption device is a file image, an interactive dialog now
    asks if reencryption should be run safely in offline mode
    (if autodetection of active devices failed).
  * Fix activation through a token where dm-crypt volume key was not
    set through keyring (but using old device-mapper table parameter mode).
  * Online reencryption can now retain all keyslots (if all passphrases
    are provided). Note that keyslot numbers will change in this case.
  * Allow volume key file to be used if no LUKS2 keyslots are present.
  * Print a warning if online reencrypt is called over LUKS1 (not supported).
  * Fix TCRYPT KDF failure in FIPS mode.
  * Remove FIPS mode restriction for crypt_volume_key_get.
  * Reduce keyslots area size in luksFormat when the header device is too small.
  * Make resize action accept --device-size parameter (supports units suffix).

- Create a weak dependency cycle between libcryptsetup and
  libcryptsetup-hmac to make sure they are installed together
  (bsc#1090768)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 15 15:01:18 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Use noun phrase in summary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 15 09:41:52 UTC 2019 - lnussel@suse.de

- New version 2.1.0
  * The default size of the LUKS2 header is increased to 16 MB.
    It includes metadata and the area used for binary keyslots;
    it means that LUKS header backup is now 16MB in size.
  * Cryptsetup now doubles LUKS default key size if XTS mode is used
    (XTS mode uses two internal keys). This does not apply if key size
    is explicitly specified on the command line and it does not apply
    for the plain mode.
    This fixes a confusion with AES and 256bit key in XTS mode where
    code used AES128 and not AES256 as often expected.
  * Default cryptographic backend used for LUKS header processing is now
    OpenSSL. For years, OpenSSL provided better performance for PBKDF.

  * The Python bindings are no longer supported and the code was removed
    from cryptsetup distribution. Please use the libblockdev project
    that already covers most of the libcryptsetup functionality
    including LUKS2.
  * Cryptsetup now allows using --offset option also for luksFormat.
  * Cryptsetup now supports new refresh action (that is the alias for
    "open --refresh").
  * Integritysetup now supports mode with detached data device through
    new --data-device option.
- 2.1.0 would use LUKS2 as default, we stay with LUKS1 for now until
  someone has time to evaluate the fallout from switching to LUKS2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 10:10:35 UTC 2018 - lnussel@suse.de

- Suggest hmac package (boo#1090768)
- remove old upgrade hack for upgrades from 12.1
- New version 2.0.5

  Changes since version 2.0.4
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Wipe full header areas (including unused) during LUKS format.

    Since this version, the whole area up to the data offset is zeroed,
    and subsequently, all keyslots areas are wiped with random data.
    This ensures that no remaining old data remains in the LUKS header
    areas, but it could slow down format operation on some devices.
    Previously only first 4k (or 32k for LUKS2) and the used keyslot
    was overwritten in the format operation.

  * Several fixes to error messages that were unintentionally replaced
    in previous versions with a silent exit code.
    More descriptive error messages were added, including error
    messages if
     - a device is unusable (not a block device, no access, etc.),
     - a LUKS device is not detected,
     - LUKS header load code detects unsupported version,
     - a keyslot decryption fails (also happens in the cipher check),
     - converting an inactive keyslot.

  * Device activation fails if data area overlaps with LUKS header.

  * Code now uses explicit_bzero to wipe memory if available
    (instead of own implementation).

  * Additional VeraCrypt modes are now supported, including Camellia
    and Kuznyechik symmetric ciphers (and cipher chains) and Streebog
    hash function. These were introduced in a recent VeraCrypt upstream.

    Note that Kuznyechik requires out-of-tree kernel module and
    Streebog hash function is available only with the gcrypt cryptographic
    backend for now.

  * Fixes static build for integritysetup if the pwquality library is used.

  * Allows passphrase change for unbound keyslots.

  * Fixes removed keyslot number in verbose message for luksKillSlot,
    luksRemoveKey and erase command.

  * Adds blkid scan when attempting to open a plain device and warn the user
    about existing device signatures in a ciphertext device.

  * Remove LUKS header signature if luksFormat fails to add the first keyslot.

  * Remove O_SYNC from device open and use fsync() to speed up
    wipe operation considerably.

  * Create --master-key-file in luksDump and fail if the file already exists.

  * Fixes a bug when LUKS2 authenticated encryption with a detached header
    wiped the header device instead of dm-integrity data device area (causing
    unnecessary LUKS2 header auto recovery).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 09:55:50 UTC 2018 - lnussel@suse.de

- make parallell installable version for SLE12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 21 07:40:54 UTC 2018 - lnussel@suse.de

- New version 2.0.4

  Changes since version 2.0.3
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Use the libblkid (blockid) library to detect foreign signatures
    on a device before LUKS format and LUKS2 auto-recovery.
    This change fixes an unexpected recovery using the secondary
    LUKS2 header after a device was already overwritten with
    another format (filesystem or LVM physical volume).
    LUKS2 will not recreate a primary header if it detects a valid
    foreign signature. In this situation, a user must always
    use cryptsetup repair command for the recovery.
    Note that libcryptsetup and utilities are now linked to libblkid
    as a new dependence.
    To compile code without blockid support (strongly discouraged),
    use --disable-blkid configure switch.
  * Add prompt for format and repair actions in cryptsetup and
    integritysetup if foreign signatures are detected on the device
    through the blockid library.
    After the confirmation, all known signatures are then wiped as
    part of the format or repair procedure.
  * Print consistent verbose message about keyslot and token numbers.
    For keyslot actions: Key slot <number> unlocked/created/removed.
    For token actions: Token <number> created/removed.
  * Print error, if a non-existent token is tried to be removed.
  * Add support for LUKS2 token definition export and import.
    The token command now can export/import customized token JSON file
    directly from command line. See the man page for more details.
  * Add support for new dm-integrity superblock version 2.
  * Add an error message when nothing was read from a key file.
  * Update cryptsetup man pages, including --type option usage.
  * Add a snapshot of LUKS2 format specification to documentation
    and accordingly fix supported secondary header offsets.
  * Add bundled optimized Argon2 SSE (X86_64 platform) code.
    If the bundled Argon2 code is used and the new configure switch
    --enable-internal-sse-argon2 option is present, and compiler flags
    support required optimization, the code will try to use optimized
    and faster variant.
    Always use the shared library (--enable-libargon2) if possible.
    This option was added because an enterprise distribution
    rejected to support the shared Argon2 library and native support
    in generic cryptographic libraries is not ready yet.
  * Fix compilation with crypto backend for LibreSSL >= 2.7.0.
    LibreSSL introduced OpenSSL 1.1.x API functions, so compatibility
    wrapper must be commented out.
  * Fix on-disk header size calculation for LUKS2 format if a specific
    data alignment is requested. Until now, the code used default size
    that could be wrong for converted devices.

  Changes since version 2.0.2
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Expose interface to unbound LUKS2 keyslots.
    Unbound LUKS2 keyslot allows storing a key material that is independent
    of master volume key (it is not bound to encrypted data segment).
  * New API extensions for unbound keyslots (LUKS2 only)
    crypt_keyslot_get_key_size() and crypt_volume_key_get()
    These functions allow to get key and key size for unbound keyslots.
  * New enum value CRYPT_SLOT_UNBOUND for keyslot status (LUKS2 only).
  * Add --unbound keyslot option to the cryptsetup luksAddKey command.
  * Add crypt_get_active_integrity_failures() call to get integrity
    failure count for dm-integrity devices.
  * Add crypt_get_pbkdf_default() function to get per-type PBKDF default
    setting.
  * Add new flag to crypt_keyslot_add_by_key() to force update device
    volume key. This call is mainly intended for a wrapped key change.
  * Allow volume key store in a file with cryptsetup.
    The --dump-master-key together with --master-key-file allows cryptsetup
    to store the binary volume key to a file instead of standard output.
  * Add support detached header for cryptsetup-reencrypt command.
  * Fix VeraCrypt PIM handling - use proper iterations count formula
    for PBKDF2-SHA512 and PBKDF2-Whirlpool used in system volumes.
  * Fix cryptsetup tcryptDump for VeraCrypt PIM (support --veracrypt-pim).
  * Add --with-default-luks-format configure time option.
    (Option to override default LUKS format version.)
  * Fix LUKS version conversion for detached (and trimmed) LUKS headers.
  * Add luksConvertKey cryptsetup command that converts specific keyslot
    from one PBKDF to another.
  * Do not allow conversion to LUKS2 if LUKSMETA (external tool metadata)
    header is detected.
  * More cleanup and hardening of LUKS2 keyslot specific validation options.
    Add more checks for cipher validity before writing metadata on-disk.
  * Do not allow LUKS1 version downconversion if the header contains tokens.
  * Add "paes" family ciphers (AES wrapped key scheme for mainframes)
    to allowed ciphers.
    Specific wrapped ley configuration logic must be done by 3rd party tool,
    LUKS2 stores only keyslot material and allow activation of the device.
  * Add support for --check-at-most-once option (kernel 4.17) to veritysetup.
    This flag can be dangerous; if you can control underlying device
    (you can change its content after it was verified) it will no longer
    prevent reading tampered data and also it does not prevent silent
    data corruptions that appear after the block was once read.
  * Fix return code (EPERM instead of EINVAL) and retry count for bad
    passphrase on non-tty input.
  * Enable support for FEC decoding in veritysetup to check dm-verity devices
    with additional Reed-Solomon code in userspace (verify command).

  Changes since version 2.0.1
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Fix a regression in early detection of inactive keyslot for luksKillSlot.
    It tried to ask for passphrase even for already erased keyslot.
  * Fix a regression in loopaesOpen processing for keyfile on standard input.
    Use of "-" argument was not working properly.
  * Add LUKS2 specific options for cryptsetup-reencrypt.
    Tokens and persistent flags are now transferred during reencryption;
    change of PBKDF keyslot parameters is now supported and allows
    to set precalculated values (no benchmarks).
  * Do not allow LUKS2 --persistent and --test-passphrase cryptsetup flags
    combination. Persistent flags are now stored only if the device was
    successfully activated with the specified flags.
  * Fix integritysetup format after recent Linux kernel changes that
    requires to setup key for HMAC in all cases.
    Previously integritysetup allowed HMAC with zero key that behaves
    like a plain hash.
  * Fix VeraCrypt PIM handling that modified internal iteration counts
    even for subsequent activations. The PIM count is no longer printed
    in debug log as it is sensitive information.
    Also, the code now skips legacy TrueCrypt algorithms if a PIM
    is specified (they cannot be used with PIM anyway).
  * PBKDF values cannot be set (even with force parameters) below
    hardcoded minimums. For PBKDF2 is it 1000 iterations, for Argon2
    it is 4 iterations and 32 KiB of memory cost.
  * Introduce new crypt_token_is_assigned() API function for reporting
    the binding between token and keyslots.
  * Allow crypt_token_json_set() API function to create internal token types.
    Do not allow unknown fields in internal token objects.
  * Print message in cryptsetup that about was aborted if a user did not
    answer YES in a query.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 30 12:26:48 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.0.1:
  * To store volume key into kernel keyring, kernel 4.15 with
    dm-crypt 1.18.1 is required
  * Increase maximum allowed PBKDF memory-cost limit to 4 GiB
  * Use /run/cryptsetup as default for cryptsetup locking dir
  * Introduce new 64-bit byte-offset *keyfile_device_offset functions.
  * New set of fucntions that allows 64-bit offsets even on 32bit systems
    are now availeble:
     - crypt_resume_by_keyfile_device_offset
     - crypt_keyslot_add_by_keyfile_device_offset
     - crypt_activate_by_keyfile_device_offset
     - crypt_keyfile_device_read
    The new functions have added the _device_ in name.
    Old functions are just internal wrappers around these.
  * Also cryptsetup --keyfile-offset and --new-keyfile-offset now
    allows 64-bit offsets as parameters.
  * Add error hint for wrongly formatted cipher strings in LUKS1 and
    properly fail in luksFormat if cipher format is missing required IV.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 25 15:15:15 UTC 2016 - alexander_naumov@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.7.2:

  * Update LUKS documentation format.
    Clarify fixed sector size and keyslots alignment.

  * Support activation options for error handling modes in
    Linux kernel dm-verity module:
      --ignore-corruption - dm-verity just logs detected corruption

      --restart-on-corruption - dm-verity restarts the kernel if
        corruption is detected
      If the options above are not specified, default behavior for
      dm-verity remains. Default is that I/O operation fails with
      I/O error if corrupted block is detected.

      --ignore-zero-blocks - Instructs dm-verity to not verify
      blocks that are expected to contain zeroes and always
      return zeroes directly instead.
      NOTE that these options could have security or functional
      impacts, do not use them without assessing the risks!

  * Fix help text for cipher benchmark specification
    (mention --cipher option).

  * Fix off-by-one error in maximum keyfile size.
    Allow keyfiles up to compiled-in default and not that value
    minus one.

  * Support resume of interrupted decryption in cryptsetup-reencrypt
    utility. To resume decryption, LUKS device UUID (--uuid option)
    option must be used.

  * Do not use direct-io for LUKS header with unaligned keyslots.
    Such headers were used only by the first cryptsetup-luks-1.0.0
    release (2005).
  * Fix device block size detection to properly work on particular

    file-based containers over underlying devices with 4k sectors.

- Update to version 1.7.1:

  * Code now uses kernel crypto API backend according to new
    changes introduced in mainline kernel
    While mainline kernel should contain backward compatible
    changes, some stable series kernels do not contain fully
    backported compatibility patches.
    Without these patches  most of cryptsetup operations
    (like unlocking device) fail.
    This change in cryptsetup ensures that all operations using
    kernel crypto API works even on these kernels.

  * The cryptsetup-reencrypt utility now properly detects removal
    of underlying link to block device and does not remove
    ongoing re-encryption log.
    This allows proper recovery (resume) of reencrypt operation later.
    NOTE: Never use /dev/disk/by-uuid/ path for reencryption utility,
    this link disappears once the device metadata is temporarily
    removed from device.

  * Cryptsetup now allows special "-" (standard input) keyfile handling
    even for TCRYPT (TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt compatible) devices.

  * Cryptsetup now fails if there are more keyfiles specified
    for non-TCRYPT device.

  * The luksKillSlot command now does not suppress provided password
    in batch mode (if password is wrong slot is not destroyed).
    Note that not providing password in batch mode means that keyslot
    is destroyed unconditionally.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  9 12:12:06 UTC 2016 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to 1.7.0:
  * The cryptsetup 1.7 release changes defaults for LUKS,
    there are no API changes.
  * Default hash function is now SHA256 (used in key derivation
    function and anti-forensic splitter).
  * Default iteration time for PBKDF2 is now 2 seconds.
  * Fix PBKDF2 iteration benchmark for longer key sizes.
  * Remove experimental warning for reencrypt tool.
  * Add optional libpasswdqc support for new LUKS passwords.
  * Update FAQ document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 10 16:05:57 CET 2015 - tiwai@suse.de

- Fix missing dependency on coreutils for initrd macros (boo#958562)
- Call missing initrd macro at postun (boo#958562)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 20:19:34 UTC 2015 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to 1.6.8
  * If the null cipher (no encryption) is used, allow only empty
    password for LUKS. (Previously cryptsetup accepted any password
    in this case.)
    The null cipher can be used only for testing and it is used
    temporarily during offline encrypting not yet encrypted device
    (cryptsetup-reencrypt tool).
    Accepting only empty password prevents situation when someone
    adds another LUKS device using the same UUID (UUID of existing
    LUKS device) with faked header containing null cipher.
    This could force user to use different LUKS device (with no
    encryption) without noticing.
    (IOW it prevents situation when attacker intentionally forces
    user to boot into different system just by LUKS header
    manipulation.)
    Properly configured systems should have an additional integrity
    protection in place here (LUKS here provides only
    confidentiality) but it is better to not allow this situation
    in the first place.
    (For more info see QubesOS Security Bulletin QSB-019-2015.)
  * Properly support stdin "-" handling for luksAddKey for both new
    and old keyfile parameters.
  * If encrypted device is file-backed (it uses underlying loop
    device), cryptsetup resize will try to resize underlying loop
    device as well. (It can be used to grow up file-backed device
    in one step.)
  * Cryptsetup now allows to use empty password through stdin pipe.
    (Intended only for testing in scripts.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  2 12:05:47 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.6.7
  * Cryptsetup TCRYPT mode now supports VeraCrypt devices 
    (TrueCrypt extension)
  * Support keyfile-offset and keyfile-size options even for plain 
    volumes.
  * Support keyfile option for luksAddKey if the master key is 
    specified.
  * For historic reasons, hashing in the plain mode is not used if 
    keyfile is specified (with exception of --key-file=-). Print 
    a warning if these parameters are ignored.
  * Support permanent device decryption for cryptsetup-reencrypt. 
    To remove LUKS encryption from a device, you can now use 
    --decrypt option.
  * Allow to use --header option in all LUKS commands. The 
    --header always takes precedence over positional device argument.
  * Allow luksSuspend without need to specify a detached header.
  * Detect if O_DIRECT is usable on a device allocation. There are 
    some strange storage stack configurations which wrongly allows 
    to open devices with direct-io but fails on all IO operations later.
  * Add low-level performance options tuning for dmcrypt (for 
    Linux 4.0 and later).
  * Get rid of libfipscheck library.
    (Note that this option was used only for Red Hat and derived 
    distributions.) With recent FIPS changes we do not need to 
    link to this FIPS monster anymore. Also drop some no longer 
    needed FIPS mode checks.
  * Many fixes and clarifications to man pages.
  * Prevent compiler to optimize-out zeroing of buffers for on-stack 
    variables.
  * Fix a crash if non-GNU strerror_r is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 14 21:50:33 UTC 2014 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- version 1.6.6
  * LUKS: Fix keyslot device access for devices which
    do not support direct IO operations. (Regression in 1.6.5.)
  * LUKS: Fallback to old temporary keyslot device mapping method
    if hash (for ESSIV) is not supported by userspace crypto
    library. (Regression in 1.6.5.)
  * Properly activate device with discard (TRIM for SSDs)
    if requested even if dm_crypt module is not yet loaded.
    Only if discard is not supported by the old kernel then
    the discard option is ignored.
  * Fix some static analysis build warnings (scan-build).
  * Report crypto lib version only once (and always add kernel
    version) in debug output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 22 12:02:56 UTC 2014 - meissner@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 12 16:34:04 UTC 2014 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- version 1.6.5
  * Allow LUKS header operation handling without requiring root privilege.
    It means that you can manipulate with keyslots as a regular user, only
    write access to device (or image) is required.
  * Fix internal PBKDF2 key derivation function implementation for alternative
    crypto backends (kernel, NSS) which do not support PBKDF2 directly and have
    issues with longer HMAC keys.
  * Support for Python3 for simple Python binding.
    Python >= 2.6 is now required. You can set Python compiled version by setting
    --with-python_version configure option (together with --enable-python).
  * Use internal PBKDF2 in Nettle library for Nettle crypto backend.
    Cryptsetup compilation requires Nettle >= 2.6 (if using Nettle crypto backend).
  * Allow simple status of crypt device without providing metadata header.
    The command "cryptsetup status" will print basic info, even if you
    do not provide detached header argument.
  * Allow to specify ECB mode in cryptsetup benchmark.
  * Add some LUKS images for regression testing.
    Note that if image with Whirlpool fails, the most probable cause is that
    you have old gcrypt library with flawed whirlpool hash.
    Read FAQ section 8.3 for more info.
- Removed e2fsprogs-devel and libtool build requirements (not needed).
- Added libpwquality-devel and libuuid-devel build requirements.

  * Add --keep-key to cryptsetup-reencrypt.
  * By default verify new passphrase in luksChangeKey and luksAddKey
    commands (if input is from terminal).
  * Fix memory leak in Nettle crypto backend.
  * Support --tries option even for TCRYPT devices in cryptsetup.
  * Support --allow-discards option even for TCRYPT devices.
    (Note that this could destroy hidden volume and it is not suggested
    by original TrueCrypt security model.)
  * Link against -lrt for clock_gettime to fix undefined reference
    to clock_gettime error (introduced in 1.6.2).
  * Fix misleading error message when some algorithms are not available.

  * also fix exit code in boot.crypto.functions (bnc#671822)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 15:32:57 UTC 2011 - lnussel@suse.de

- boot.crypto:
  * don't fail if loop module is not loaded
  * adapt to new crypsetup exit codes (bnc#667931)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 20 13:01:54 UTC 2010 - lnussel@suse.de

- new version 1.2.0
  * Add selection of random/urandom number generator for luksFormat
 (option --use-random and --use-urandom).

 * Fix luksRemoveKey to not ask for remaining keyslot passphrase,
 only for removed one.

 * No longer support luksDelKey (replaced with luksKillSlot).
  * if you want to remove particular passphrase, use luksKeyRemove
  * if you want to remove particular keyslot, use luksKillSlot

 Note that in batch mode luksKillSlot allows removing of any keyslot
 without question, in normal mode requires passphrase or keyfile from
 other keyslot.

 * Default alignment for device (if not overridden by topology info)
 is now (multiple of) *1MiB*.
 This reflects trends in storage technologies and aligns to the same
 defaults for partitions and volume management.

 * Allow explicit UUID setting in luksFormat and allow change it later
 in luksUUID (--uuid parameter).

 * All commands using key file now allows limited read from keyfile using
 --keyfile-size and --new-keyfile-size parameters (in bytes).

 This change also disallows overloading of --key-size parameter which
 is now exclusively used for key size specification (in bits.)

 * luksFormat using pre-generated master key now properly allows
 using key file (only passphrase was allowed prior to this update).

 * Add --dump-master-key option for luksDump to perform volume (master)
 key dump. Note that printed information allows accessing device without
 passphrase so it must be stored encrypted.

 This operation is useful for simple Key Escrow function (volume key and
 encryption parameters printed on paper on safe place).

 This operation requires passphrase or key file.

 * The reload command is no longer supported.
 (Use dmsetup reload instead if needed. There is no real use for this
 function except explicit data corruption:-)

 * Cryptsetup now properly checks if underlying device is in use and
 disallows *luksFormat*, luksOpen and create commands on open
 (e.g. already mapped or mounted) device.

 * Option --non-exclusive (already deprecated) is removed.

Libcryptsetup API additions:

 * new functions
  * crypt_get_type() - explicit query to crypt device context type
  * crypt_resize() - new resize command using context
  * crypt_keyslot_max() - helper to get number of supported keyslots
  * crypt_get_active_device() - get active device info
  * crypt_set/get_rng_type() - random/urandom RNG setting
  * crypt_set_uuid() - explicit UUID change of existing device
  * crypt_get_device_name() - get underlying device name

 * Fix optional password callback handling.

 * Allow to activate by internally cached volume key immediately after
 crypt_format() without active slot (for temporary devices with
 on-disk metadata)

 * libcryptsetup is binary compatible with 1.1.x release and still
 supports legacy API calls

 * cryptsetup binary now uses only new API calls.

 * Static compilation of both library (--enable-static) and cryptsetup
 binary (--enable-static-cryptsetup) is now properly implemented by common
 libtool logic.

 Prior to this it produced miscompiled dynamic cryptsetup binary with
 statically linked libcryptsetup.

 The static binary is compiled as src/cryptsetup.static in parallel
 with dynamic build if requested.

    documented. (To enable check of passphrase/keyfile using
    libcryptsetup without activating the device.)

  * Allow no hash specification in plain device constructor - user can provide volume key directly.
  * Try to use pkgconfig for device mapper library in configuration script.
  * Add some compatibility checks and disable LUKS suspend/resume if not supported.
  * Rearrange tests, "make check" now run all available test for package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 18 12:18:32 UTC 2010 - lnussel@suse.de

- cryptsetup 1.1.0:

 * IMPORTANT: the default compiled-in cipher parameters changed
	plain mode: aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 (default is backward incompatible!).
	LUKS mode: aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 (only key size increased)
	In both modes is now default key size 256bits.

	 * Default compiled-in parameters are now configurable through configure options:
	   --with-plain-* / --with-luks1-* (see configure --help)

	 * If you need backward compatible defaults for distribution use
	   configure --with-plain-mode=cbc-plain --with-luks1-keybits=128

	 Default compiled-in modes are printed in "cryptsetup --help" output.

 * Change in iterations count (LUKS):
	The slot and key digest iteration minimum count is now 1000.
	The key digest iteration count is calculated from iteration time (approx 1/8 of req. time).
	For more info about above items see discussion here: http://tinyurl.com/yaug97y

 * New libcryptsetup API (documented in libcryptsetup.h).

	The old API (using crypt_options struct) is still available but will remain
	frozen and not used for new functions.
	Soname of library changed to libcryptsetup.so.1.0.0.
	(But only recompilation should be needed for old programs.)

	The new API provides much more flexible operation over LUKS device for
	applications, it is preferred that new applications will use libcryptsetup
	and not wrapper around cryptsetup binary.

 * New luksHeaderBackup and luksHeaderRestore commands.

	These commands allows binary backup of LUKS header.
	Please read man page about possible security issues with backup files.

 * New luksSuspend (freeze device and wipe key) and luksResume (with provided passphrase).

	luksSuspend wipe encryption key in kernel memory and set device to suspend
	(blocking all IO) state. This option can be used for situations when you need
	temporary wipe encryption key (like suspend to RAM etc.)
	Please read man page for more information.

 * New --master-key-file option for luksFormat and luksAddKey.

	User can now specify pre-generated master key in file, which allows regenerating
	LUKS header or add key with only master key knowledge.

 * Uses libgcrypt and enables all gcrypt hash algorithms for LUKS through -h luksFormat option.

	Please note that using different hash for LUKS header make device incompatible with
	old cryptsetup releases.

 * Introduces --debug parameter.

	Use when reporting bugs (just run cryptsetup with --debug and attach output
	to issue report.) Sensitive data are never printed to this log.

 * Moves command successful messages to verbose level.

 * Requires device-mapper library and libgcrypt to build.

 * Uses dm-uuid for all crypt devices, contains device type and name now.

 * Removes support for dangerous non-exclusive option
	(it is ignored now, LUKS device must be always opened exclusive)

- boot.crypto:
  * don't use dirty prompt override hack anymore
  * wait for volume groups if resume volume is on lvm (bnc#556895)

Tue Oct 16 10:38:35 CEST 2007 - lnussel@suse.de

- upgrade to svn revision 31
  * Rename luksDelKey into luksKillSlot
  * Add luksRemoveKey that queries a given key before removal
  * Fix segfault in luksOpen.
  * Add LUKS_device_ready check for most LUKS calls, so that
    cryptsetup dies before password querying in case a blockdev is
    unavailable
  * For LUKS key material access require exclusive access to the
    underlying device. This will prevent multiple mappings onto a
    single LUKS device. dm*crypt doesn't feature any syncing
    capabilities, hence there is no real application for this as it
    will likely lead to disk corruption.
  * Add signal handler to keyencryption to free the temporary
    mapping in case the user hits ctrl-c.
