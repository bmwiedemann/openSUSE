- Update to 2.0.24
  This is a minor release issued correct an error found in the
  association operation with the PegasusAdapter and an error introduced
  in 2.0.22 in genmod. The genmod error would be evidenced by a users in
  inability to register providers with regmod to OpenPegasus. It is
  recommended that vesion 2.0.22 users upgrade to this verison of
  SimpleWbem. Note that version 2.0.22 introduced a new configuration
  parameter that allows users to control use of the macros that generate
  log entries

- Update to 2.0.22
  This is a minor release issued to extend error handling of the log
  file and provide diagnostic information if the provider has problems
  configuring and creating logs. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  5 15:14:25 UTC 2012 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Update to 2.0.17
  This is a minor release primarily to fix some issues with adapters and
  implement extensions to the logging functions. This minor version
  added functionality to allow better control of logging and to
  implement APIs so that the provider can dynamically control some
  configuration capabilities (class CimpleConfig). This logging
  extension was at user request since the CIMPLE users want to utilize
  the logging capability in production as well as development. NOTE:
  Please consider CimpleConfig experimental for this release since this
  the first time it will be used generally. We will freeze in the next
  release. Notable changes:

  * Added capability to limit size of log files and backup logs files
  * Added conditional trace for adapters. Implemented for Pegasus adapter
  * Added compile config parameter to control adapter trace
    (--enable-adapter-trace)
  * Added compile config parameter to disable logging (--disable_log_macros)
  * Added runtime config parameter to set max log file
    size(MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZE=(integer)
  * Added runtime config parameter to set max number of backup log
    files(MAX_LOG_BACKUP_FILES=(integer)
  * Added runtime config parameter to disable all
    logging(ENABLE_LOGGING=false)
  * Fixed issues with Pegasus adapter and possible excess memory use
  * Extended unit and test provider tests
  * Added general option to all gen... utilities (-F) to get classlist
    from file
  * Minor performance enhancements
  * Continued improvement of documentation with changes to header files,
    additional readme files and more examples in test providers(/li>
