# Generating the KIWI file

The `.kiwi` file is generated from the `csi-provisioner-image.xsl`
base template and the `*.xml` documents for each distribution.

After making changes to any of the xsl or xml files, the kiwi
file can be regenerated by running `sh ./pre-checkin.sh TARGET`,
where TARGET corresponds to the distribution flavor in use.

## Requirements
