  <title>Curses debugger</title>
  <description>CGDB is a curses (terminal-based) interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB). Its goal
is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered with unnecessary features.

The primary feature of CGDB is the constant presence of a source display,
updated as the program executes, to help keep you focused while debugging. The
interface is inspired by the classic Unix text editor, vi. Those familiar with
vi (or vim) should feel right at home using CGDB.</description>
