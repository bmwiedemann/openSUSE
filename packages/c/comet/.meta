  <title>Open Source implementation of GOG Galaxy Communication Service</title>
  <description>Open Source implementation of GOG Galaxy Communication Service for SDK bundled with GOG games.
This project aims to implement calls made by game through SDK.
Note: that means it can't and won't replace Communication Service in official client

This will provide minimal and platform-agnostic SDK. For use in game launchers like Heroic or Lutris
Project is continuation of Yepoleb's work https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet/ but in Python now in Rust</description>
