%description
LimitCPU is a program to throttle the CPU cycles used by other applications.
LimitCPU will monitor a process and make sure its CPU usage stays at or
below a given percentage. This can be used to make sure your system
has plenty of CPU cycles available for other tasks. It can also be used
to keep laptops cool in the face of CPU-hungry processes and for limiting
virtual machines.

LimitCPU is the direct child of CPUlimit, a creation of Angelo Marletta,
which can be found at http://cpulimit.sourceforge.net
