Mon May 20 13:10:29 UTC 2024 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- update to 3.1:
  * The new version fixes an issue with monitoring a target process which 
    has multiple children and a low CPU limit throttle. In some cases this 
    situation could lead to LimitCPU crashing. This has been fixed and the
    monitoring of children processes has been made slightly more efficient.

- Use %autosetup macro. Allows to eliminate the usage of deprecated
  %patchN.

Sun May 14 17:50:51 UTC 2023 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to 3.0:
  * Fix an important bug in LimitCPU when the program is
    monitoring both a program and its child processes via the "-m"
    flag. In the past, it was possible LimitCPU would fail to spawn
    new instances to monitor child processes if LimitCPU was not in
    the user's default path. In other words, if we were launched
    from /usr/local/bin and this directory was not in the default
    path, then child processes might not be monitored. And the
    failure would happen silently.
  * Now LimitCPU will try to do a better job of launching new
    monitors for child processes and it will print a warning
    about any errors when run in verbose mode.

Thu Apr 27 22:28:50 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.9:
  * When counting CPU cycles (jiffies) we now use
    a "long" type instead of "int" to avoid running
    out of space when tracking on-running processes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 29 22:56:56 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.8:
  * Made exit message when child signal is caught only show up
  when in verbose mode.
  * Adjusted the way the VERSION value is assigned in the Makefile.
  CFLAGS was being overwritten by Debian's build process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 20 22:44:03 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.7:
  * Fixed compiler warnings regarding string lengths.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 25 21:26:56 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.6:
  * Fixed indentation to avoid compiler warnings. No functional change.
  * Updated manual page to warn against using -m on a script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 08:34:12 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- new upstream version 2.5
  * Added some protection against causing a fork bomb when the
    throttled process is a parent to LimitCPU.
- includes 2.4
  * Introduced ability to watch children of the target process. This
    means forks of the process we are throttling can also be
    throttled, using the "-m" or "--monitor-forks" flags.
- includes 2.3
  * Applied patch to man page which fixes -s description.
  * Added --foreground, -f flag for launching target programs in the
    foreground. LimitCPU then waits for the target process to exit.
    Should be useful in scripts.
- rebase cpulimit-2.2-do_not_forget_version.patch
- cleanup with spec-cleaner

Fri Dec 26 09:11:15 UTC 2014 - andrea@opensuse.org

- new upstream version 2.2
  + Escaped double-dashed in manual page to avoid
  warnings from Debian check tool.
  + Added -s --signal flag. This flag allows the user to
  specify an alternative signal to send a watched process
  when cpulimit terminates. By default we send SIGCONT.
  The -s flag can accept a number (1-35) or a written
  value such as SIGCONT, SIGSTOP, SIGINT, SIGTERM.

- from version 2.1
  + Added the --quiet (-q) flag to make 
  limitcpu run silently
  + Make sure error messages are printed to stderr.
  + Placed source code in Subversion (svn) repository.
  Accessable using the SVN checkout command. For
  details, please see the README file.

- from version 2.0
  + Added the -- flag to make sure child processes
  run with command line flags would not confuse
  cpulimit.
  + Corrected output of child process name in verbose mode.

- added cpulimit-2.2-do_not_forget_version.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 24 00:34:45 UTC 2013 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Updated to version 1.9:
  + Added --kill (-k) and --restore (-r) flags to allow target
    processes to be killed and restored rather than simply
    throttled.
- Updates from version 1.8:
  + When displaying verbose output, cpulimit now redisplays the
    column headers every 20 lines.
  + Fixed limiting CPU usage on multicore machines when the desired
    usage limit is great than 100%.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 24 20:10:09 UTC 2012 - devel.openSUSE.org@gmail.com

- Upstream update to version 1.7:
  * Minor code cleanup.
  * Make sure we do not try to throttle our own process.
  * Added "tarball" option to the Makefile to assist
    in packaging. Moved version number to the makefile.
  * Added version information to CPUlimit's help screen.
  * Detect the number of CPU cores on the machine and
    cap the % we can limit. 1 CPU means we can
    limit processes 1-100%, 2 means 1-200%, 4 means 1-400%.
  * Removed extra priority changes. We now only bump
    our priority once, if we have access to do so.
    Also simplified priority increases so it's flexible
    rather than "all or nothing".
  * Since we now attempt to detect the number of CPUs
    available, we also give the user the ability to
    override our guess. The -c and --cpu flags have
    been added for this purpose.
  * Commands can be launched and throttled by appending
    commands to the end of CPUlimit's argument list. For
    example:
    cpulimit -l 25 firefox
