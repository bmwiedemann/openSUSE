%description
This emulator is designed to provide emulation of actual smart cards to a
virtual card reader running in a guest virtual machine. The emulated smart
cards can be representations of real smart cards, where the necessary functions
such as signing, card removal/insertion, etc. are mapped to real, physical
cards which are shared with the client machine the emulator is running on, or
the cards could be pure software constructs.
