- Update to v2.6.0
* provides implementation of GSC-IS 2.1 (aka CAC version 2) to improve
  interoperability with guest software using the emulated or shared
  smart cards. The previously implemented CACv1 specification is no

  and any application depending on this old standard will not work
  anymore.
* vscclient is no longer installed, as it is not an end-user supported
  solution
