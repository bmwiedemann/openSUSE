  <title>Basic data structures in C (libstdc++ wrapper)</title>
  <description>Small library that offers basic data structures (list, set, map, ..)
in a pure C API for user-space applications.

Key features:
 - Easy to use, portable
 - No &quot;magic&quot; MACROs, and no need to modify your data structures
   (except, perhaps, for __attribute__((packed)))
 - Uses C++ standard library as the backend for most data structures
 - Reasonable performance
