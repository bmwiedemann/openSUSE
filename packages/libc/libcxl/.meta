  <title>libcxl  coherent accelerator library</title>
  <description>The coherent accelerator interface is designed to allow the coherent
connection of accelerators (FPGAs and other devices) to a POWER system.
Coherent in this context means that the accelerator and CPUs can both access
system memory directly and with the same effective addresses. IBM refers to
this as the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI). In the Linux
world it is referred to by the name CXL to avoid confusion with the ISDN
CAPI subsystem.
 The Linux kernel interacts with the device POWER Service Layer (PSL).
Userland interacts with the device Accelerator Function Unit (AFU). See the
Linux kernel source file Documentation/powerpc/cxl.txt for a detailed
description of the coherent accelerator interface.
 The CXL library provides a userland API to coherently attached devices. CXL
devices can be enumerated. Their capabilities can be queried. AFUs can be
opened, attached to the current process, and started. Jobs, described by AFU
specific Work Element Descriptors (WEDs), can be submitted and executed by
AFUs. AFU MMIO space can be mapped into the current process memory, and AFUs
can be configured and controlled via MMIO reads and writes.
