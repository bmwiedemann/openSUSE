Subject: [PATCH] libcomps: Support builds with CMake 4+

- Bump minimum required version to 3.10, the lowest one CMake 4+ don't complain
  about. It's also possible to use 3.5, but that results in a deprecation
  warning. The 'cmake_minimum_required()' invocation has been moved before the
  initial 'project()' call as CMake complained about the wrong order.

- Set policy CMP0148 [0] to OLD to unblock build without additional changes.
  Eventually, the usage of the 'PythonInterp' and 'PythonLibs' find modules will
  be need to be updated to use 'Python3' instead.

- Set policy CMP0175 [1] to NEW and fix warnings.

- Fix the 'No TARGET ... has been created in this directory' error in
  'src/python'.

- Fix 'Utility target <foo> must not be used as the target of a
  target_link_libraries call' errors (see [2]).

- Mark the 'check' library as required when tests are enabled to prevent test
  targets from linking a non-existing library in case it's not installed.
