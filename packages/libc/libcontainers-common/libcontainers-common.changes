- Update to libpod v1.4.4

    entire root configuration if no rootless configuration was
    present for the user, breaking rootless Podman for new

    displayed and removed by Podman
  - Fixed a bug where locks were not properly freed on failure to
    create a container or pod
  - Podman now has greatly improved support for containers using
    multiple OCI runtimes. Containers now remember if they were

    libpod.conf
  - For backwards compatability, setting --log-driver=json-file in
    podman run is now supported as an alias for
    --log-driver=k8s-file. This is considered deprecated, and
    json-file will be moved to a new implementation in the future
    ([#3363](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/3363))
  - Podman's default libpod.conf file now allows the crun OCI
    runtime to be used if it is installed

    available

    based on whether the container does not exist, and the command
    in the container does not exist

    JSON that matches that of docker inspect, only including
    user-specified volumes and differentiating bind mounts and
    named volumes

    container's OCI spec with the OCIConfigPath key (only included
    when the container is initialized or running)
  - The podman run --mount command now supports the
    bind-nonrecursive option for bind mounts (#3314)
  - Fixed a bug where podman play kube would fail to create
    containers due to an unspecified log driver
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to build with musl libc
    (#3284)
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman using slirp4netns networking
    in an environment with no nameservers on the host other than
    localhost would result in nonfunctional networking (#3277)
  - Fixed a bug where podman import would not properly set
    environment variables, discarding their values and retaining
    only keys
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to run when built with
    Apparmor support but run on systems without the Apparmor kernel
    module loaded (#3331)
  - Remote Podman will now default the username it uses to log in
    to remote systems to the username of the current user

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 27 08:48:16 UTC 2018 - vrothberg@suse.com

- Consolidate libcontainers-{common,image,storage} into one package,
  libcontainers-common. That's the way upstream intended all libraries from
  github.com/containers to be packaged. It facilitates updating and maintaining
  the package, as all configs and manpages come from a central source.

  Note that the `storage` binary that previously has been provided by the
