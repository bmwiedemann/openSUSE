- Update podman to 3.3.1

3.3.1:

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where unit files created by `podman generate systemd` could not cleanup shut down containers when stopped by `systemctl stop` ([#11304](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11304)).
- Fixed a bug where `podman machine` commands would not properly locate the `gvproxy` binary in some circumstances.
- Fixed a bug where containers created as part of a pod using the `--pod-id-file` option would not join the pod's network namespace ([#11303](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11303)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman, when using the systemd cgroups driver, could sometimes leak dbus sessions.
- Fixed a bug where the `until` filter to `podman logs` and `podman events` was improperly handled, requiring input to be negated ([#11158](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11158)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers using CNI networking run on systems using `systemd-resolved` for DNS would fail to start if resolved symlinked `/etc/resolv.conf` to an absolute path ([#11358](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11358)).

### API
- A large number of potential file descriptor leaks from improperly closing client connections have been fixed.


3.3.0:

### Features
- Containers inside VMs created by `podman machine` will now automatically handle port forwarding - containers in `podman machine` VMs that publish ports via `--publish` or `--publish-all` will have these ports not just forwarded on the VM, but also on the host system.
- The `podman play kube` command's `--network` option now accepts advanced network options (e.g. `--network slirp4netns:port_handler=slirp4netns`) ([#10807](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10807)).
- The `podman play kube` commmand now supports Kubernetes liveness probes, which will be created as Podman healthchecks.
- Podman now provides a systemd unit, `podman-restart.service`, which, when enabled, will restart all containers that were started with `--restart=always` after the system reboots.
- Rootless Podman can now be configured to use CNI networking by default by using the `rootless_networking` option in `containers.conf`.
- Images can now be pulled using `image:tag@digest` syntax (e.g. `podman pull fedora:34@sha256:1b0d4ddd99b1a8c8a80e885aafe6034c95f266da44ead992aab388e6aa91611a`) ([#6721](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6721)).
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands can now be used to checkpoint containers that are in pods, and restore those containers into pods.
- The `podman container restore` command now features a new option, `--publish`, to change the ports that are forwarded to a container that is being restored from an exported checkpoint.
- The `podman container checkpoint` command now features a new option, `--compress`, to specify the compression algorithm that will be used on the generated checkpoint.
- The `podman pull` command can now pull multiple images at once (e.g. `podman pull fedora:34 ubi8:latest` will pull both specified images).
- THe `podman cp` command can now copy files from one container into another directly (e.g. `podman cp containera:/etc/hosts containerb:/etc/`) ([#7370](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7370)).
- The `podman cp` command now supports a new option, `--archive`, which controls whether copied files will be chown'd to the UID and GID of the user of the destination container.
- The `podman stats` command now provides two additional metrics: Average CPU, and CPU time.
- The `podman pod create` command supports a new flag, `--pid`, to specify the PID namespace of the pod. If specified, containers that join the pod will automatically share its PID namespace.
- The `podman pod create` command supports a new flag, `--infra-name`, which allows the name of the pod's infra container to be set ([#10794](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10794)).
- The `podman auto-update` command has had its output reformatted - it is now much clearer what images were pulled and what containers were updated.
- The `podman auto-update` command now supports a new option, `--dry-run`, which reports what would be updated but does not actually perform the update ([#9949](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9949)).
- The `podman build` command now supports a new option, `--secret`, to mount secrets into build containers.
- The `podman manifest remove` command now has a new alias, `podman manifest rm`.
- The `podman login` command now supports a new option, `--verbose`, to print detailed information about where the credentials entered were stored.
- The `podman events` command now supports a new event, `exec_died`, which is produced when an exec session exits, and includes the exit code of the exec session.
- The `podman system connection add` command now supports adding connections that connect using the `tcp://` and `unix://` URL schemes.
- The `podman system connection list` command now supports a new flag, `--format`, to determine how the output is printed.
- The `podman volume prune` and `podman volume ls` commands' `--filter` option now support a new filter, `until`, that matches volumes created before a certain time ([#10579](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10579)).
- The `podman ps --filter` option's `network` filter now accepts a new value: `container:`, which matches containers that share a network namespace with a specific container ([#10361](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10361)).
- The `podman diff` command can now accept two arguments, allowing two images or two containers to be specified; the diff between the two will be printed ([#10649](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10649)).
- Podman can now optionally copy-up content from containers into volumes mounted into those containers earlier (at creation time, instead of at runtime) via the `prepare_on_create` option in `containers.conf` ([#10262](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10262)).
- A new option, `--gpus`, has been added to `podman create` and `podman run` as a no-op for better compatibility with Docker. If the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed, GPUs should be automatically added to containers without using the flag.
- If an invalid subcommand is provided, similar commands to try will now be suggested in the error message.

### Changes
- The `podman system reset` command now removes non-Podman (e.g. Buildah and CRI-O) containers as well.
- The new port forwarding offered by `podman machine` requires [gvproxy](https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock) in order to function.
- Podman will now automatically create the default CNI network if it does not exist, for both root and rootless users. This will only be done once per user - if the network is subsequently removed, it will not be recreated.
- The `install.cni` makefile option has been removed. It is no longer required to distribute the default `87-podman.conflist` CNI configuration file, as Podman will now automatically create it.
- The `--root` option to Podman will not automatically clear all default storage options when set. Storage options can be set manually using `--storage-opt` ([#10393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10393)).
- The output of `podman system connection list` is now deterministic, with connections being sorted alpabetically by their name.
- The auto-update service (`podman-auto-update.service`) has had its default timer adjusted so it now starts at a random time up to 15 minutes after midnight, to help prevent system congestion from numerous daily services run at once.
- Systemd unit files generated by `podman generate systemd` now depend on `network-online.target` by default ([#10655](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10655)).
- Systemd unit files generated by `podman generate systemd` now use `Type=notify` by default, instead of using PID files.
- The `podman info` command's logic for detecting package versions on Gentoo has been improved, and should be significantly faster.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command did not perform SELinux relabelling of volumes specified with a `mountPath` that included the `:z` or `:Z` options ([#9371](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9371)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command would ignore the `USER` and `EXPOSE` directives in images ([#9609](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9609)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command would only accept lowercase pull policies.
- Fixed a bug where named volumes mounted into containers with the `:z` or `:Z` options were not appropriately relabelled for access from the container ([#10273](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10273)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs -f` command, with the `journald` log driver, could sometimes fail to pick up the last line of output from a container ([#10323](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10323)).
- Fixed a bug where running `podman rm` on a container created with the `--rm` option would occasionally emit an error message saying the container failed to be removed, when it was successfully removed.
- Fixed a bug where starting a Podman container would segfault if the `LISTEN_PID` and `LISTEN_FDS` environment variables were set, but `LISTEN_FDNAMES` was not ([#10435](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10435)).
- Fixed a bug where exec sessions in containers were sometimes not cleaned up when run without `-d` and when the associated `podman exec` process was killed before completion.
- Fixed a bug where `podman system service` could, when run in a systemd unit file with sdnotify in use, drop some connections when it was starting up.
- Fixed a bug where containers run using the REST API using the `slirp4netns` network mode would leave zombie processes that were not cleaned up until `podman system service` exited ([#9777](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9777)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command would leave zombie processes after its initial launch that were not cleaned up until it exited ([#10575](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10575)).
- Fixed a bug where VMs created by `podman machine` could not be started after the host system restarted ([#10824](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10824)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod ps` command would not show headers for optional information (e.g. container names when the `--ctr-names` option was given).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman create` and `podman run` commands would ignore timezone configuration from the server's `containers.conf` file ([#11124](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11124)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would only respect `.containerignore` and not `.dockerignore` files (when both are present, `.containerignore` will be preferred) ([#10907](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10907)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would fail to send the Dockerfile being built to the server when it was excluded by the `.dockerignore` file, resulting in an error ([#9867](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9867)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command could unexpectedly stop streaming the output of the build ([#10154](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10154)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would fail to build when run on Windows ([#11259](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11259)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest create` command accepted at most two arguments (an arbitrary number of images are allowed as arguments, which will be added to the manifest).
- Fixed a bug where named volumes would not be properly chowned to the UID and GID of the directory they were mounted over when first mounted into a container ([#10776](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10776)).
- Fixed a bug where named volumes created using a volume plugin would be removed from Podman, even if the plugin reported a failure to remove the volume ([#11214](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11214)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman exec -i` command would hang when input was provided via shell redirection (e.g. `podman --remote exec -i foo cat <<<"hello"`) ([#7360](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7360)).
- Fixed a bug where containers created with `--rm` were not immediately removed after being started by `podman start` if they failed to start ([#10935](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10935)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--storage-opt` flag to `podman create` and `podman run` was nonfunctional ([#10264](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10264)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--device-cgroup-rule` option to `podman create` and `podman run` was nonfunctional ([#10302](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10302)).

- Fixed a bug where operations that pruned images (`podman image prune` and `podman system prune`) would prune untagged images with children ([#10832](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10832)).
- Fixed a bug where dual-stack networks created by `podman network create` did not properly auto-assign an IPv4 subnet when one was not explicitly specified ([#11032](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11032)).
- Fixed a bug where port forwarding using the `rootlessport` port forwarder would break when a network was disconnected and then reconnected ([#10052](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10052)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would ignore user-specified SELinux policies for containers using the Kata OCI runtime, or containers using systemd as PID 1 ([#11100](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11100)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman containers created using `--net=host` would add an entry to `/etc/hosts` for the container's hostname pointing to `127.0.1.1` ([#10319](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10319)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman unpause --all` command would throw an error for every container that was not paused ([#11098](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11098)).

- The `podman build` command now supports a new option, `--secret`, to mount secrets into build containers.
- The `podman manifest remove` command now has a new alias, `podman manifest rm`.
- The `podman login` command now supports a new option, `--verbose`, to print detailed information about where the credentials entered were stored.
- The `podman events` command now supports a new event, `exec_died`, which is produced when an exec session exits, and includes the exit code of the exec session.
- The `podman system connection add` command now supports adding connections that connect using the `tcp://` and `unix://` URL schemes.
- The `podman system connection list` command now supports a new flag, `--format`, to determine how the output is printed.
- The `podman volume prune` and `podman volume ls` commands' `--filter` option now support a new filter, `until`, that matches volumes created before a certain time ([#10579](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10579)).
- The `podman ps --filter` option's `network` filter now accepts a new value: `container:`, which matches containers that share a network namespace with a specific container ([#10361](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10361)).
- The `podman diff` command can now accept two arguments, allowing two images or two containers to be specified; the diff between the two will be printed ([#10649](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10649)).
- Podman can now optionally copy-up content from containers into volumes mounted into those containers earlier (at creation time, instead of at runtime) via the `prepare_on_create` option in `containers.conf` ([#10262](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10262)).
- A new option, `--gpus`, has been added to `podman create` and `podman run` as a no-op for better compatibility with Docker. If the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed, GPUs should be automatically added to containers without using the flag.
- If an invalid subcommand is provided, similar commands to try will now be suggested in the error message.

### Changes
- The `podman system reset` command now removes non-Podman (e.g. Buildah and CRI-O) containers as well.
- The new port forwarding offered by `podman machine` requires [gvproxy](https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock) in order to function.
- Podman will now automatically create the default CNI network if it does not exist, for both root and rootless users. This will only be done once per user - if the network is subsequently removed, it will not be recreated.
- The `install.cni` makefile option has been removed. It is no longer required to distribute the default `87-podman.conflist` CNI configuration file, as Podman will now automatically create it.
- The `--root` option to Podman will not automatically clear all default storage options when set. Storage options can be set manually using `--storage-opt` ([#10393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10393)).
- The output of `podman system connection list` is now deterministic, with connections being sorted alpabetically by their name.
- The auto-update service (`podman-auto-update.service`) has had its default timer adjusted so it now starts at a random time up to 15 minutes after midnight, to help prevent system congestion from numerous daily services run at once.
- Systemd unit files generated by `podman generate systemd` now depend on `network-online.target` by default ([#10655](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10655)).
- The `podman info` command's logic for detecting package versions on Gentoo has been improved, and should be significantly faster.

3.3.0-RC2:

### Features
- Containers inside VMs created by `podman machine` will now automatically handle port forwarding - containers in `podman machine` VMs that publish ports via `--publish` or `--publish-all` will have these ports not just forwarded on the VM, but also on the host system.
- The `podman play kube` command's `--network` option now accepts advanced network options (e.g. `--network slirp4netns:port_handler=slirp4netns`) ([#10807](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10807)).
- The `podman play kube` commmand now supports Kubernetes liveness probes, which will be created as Podman healthchecks.

- Rootless Podman can now be configured to use CNI networking by default by using the `rootless_networking` option in `containers.conf`.
- Images can now be pulled using `image:tag@digest` syntax (e.g. `podman pull fedora:34@sha256:1b0d4ddd99b1a8c8a80e885aafe6034c95f266da44ead992aab388e6aa91611a`) ([#6721](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6721)).
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands can now be used to checkpoint containers that are in pods, and restore those containers into pods.
- The `podman container restore` command now features a new option, `--publish`, to change the ports that are forwarded to a container that is being restored from an exported checkpoint.
- The `podman container checkpoint` command now features a new option, `--compress`, to specify the compression algorithm that will be used on the generated checkpoint.

- THe `podman cp` command can now copy files from one container into another directly (e.g. `podman cp containera:/etc/hosts containerb:/etc/`) ([#7370](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7370)).
- The `podman cp` command now supports a new option, `--archive`, which controls whether copied files will be chown'd to the UID and GID of the user of the destination container.
- The `podman stats` command now provides two additional metrics: Average CPU, and CPU time.
- The `podman pod create` command supports a new flag, `--pid`, to specify the PID namespace of the pod. If specified, containers that join the pod will automatically share its PID namespace.

- The `podman ps --filter` option's `network` filter now accepts a new value: `container:`, which matches containers that share a network namespace with a specific container ([#10361](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10361)).
- The `podman diff` command can now accept two arguments, allowing two images or two containers to be specified; the diff between the two will be printed ([#10649](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10649)).
- Podman can now optionally copy-up content from containers into volumes mounted into those containers earlier (at creation time, instead of at runtime) via the `prepare_on_create` option in `containers.conf` ([#10262](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10262)).

- Update podman to 3.2.3

3.2.3:

### Security
- This release addresses CVE-2021-3602, an issue with the `podman build` command with the `--isolation chroot` flag that results in environment variables from the host leaking into build containers.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where events related to images could occur before the relevant operation had completed (e.g. an image pull event could be written before the pull was finished) ([#10812](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10812)).
- Fixed a bug where `podman save` would refuse to save images with an architecture different from that of the host ([#10835](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10835)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman import` command did not correctly handle images without tags ([#10854](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10854)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman's journald events backend would fail and prevent Podman from running when run on a host with systemd as PID1 but in an environment (e.g. a container) without systemd ([#10863](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10863)).
- Fixed a bug where containers using rootless CNI networking would fail to start when the `dnsname` CNI plugin was in use and the host system's `/etc/resolv.conf` was a symlink ([#10855](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10855) and [#10929](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10929)).
- Fixed a bug where containers using rootless CNI networking could fail to start due to a race in rootless CNI initialization ([#10930](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10930)).

### Misc
- Updated Buildah to v1.21.3
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.38.16

1.32.6:

    Fix runtime panic for opening lockfile if parent dir got removed

- Update podman to 3.2.2

3.2.2:

### Changes
- Podman's handling of the Architecture field of images has been relaxed. Since 3.2.0, Podman required that the architecture of the image match the architecture of the system to run containers based on an image, but images often incorrectly report architecture, causing Podman to reject valid images ([#10648](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10648) and [#10682](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10682)).
- Podman no longer uses inotify to monitor for changes to CNI configurations. This removes potential issues where Podman cannot be run because a user has exhausted their available inotify sessions ([#10686](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10686)).

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` would, when given a directory as its source and a target that existed and was a file, copy the contents of the directory into the parent directory of the file; this now results in an error.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs` command would, when following a running container's logs, not include the last line of output from the container when it exited when the `k8s-file` driver was in use ([#10675](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10675)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to run containers if `systemd-resolved` was incorrectly detected as the system's DNS server ([#10733](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10733)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman exec -t` command would only resize the exec session's TTY after the session started, leading to a race condition where the terminal would initially not have a size set ([#10560](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10560)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman containers using the `slirp4netns` network mode would add an incorrect entry to `/etc/hosts` pointing the container's hostname to the wrong IP address.
- Fixed a bug where Podman would create volumes specified by images with incorrect permissions ([#10188](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10188) and [#10606](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10606)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not respect the `uid` and `gid` options to `podman volume create -o` ([#10620](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10620)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` command could panic when parsing the system's cgroup configuration ([#10666](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10666)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build -f - ...` command did not read a Containerfile from STDIN ([#10621](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10621)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman container restore --import` command would fail to restore checkpoints created from privileged containers ([#10615](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10615)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman was not respecting the `TMPDIR` environment variable when pulling images ([#10698](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10698)).
- Fixed a bug where a number of Podman commands did not properly support using Go templates as an argument to the `--format` option.

### API
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Containers did not include information on container healthchecks ([#10457](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10457)).
- Fixed a bug where the Libpod and Compat Build endpoints for Images did not properly handle the `devices` query parameter ([#10614](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10614)).

### Misc
- Fixed a bug where the Makefile's `make podman-remote-static` target to build a statically-linked `podman-remote` binary was instead producing dynamic binaries ([#10656](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10656)).
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.38.11


3.2.1:

### Changes
- Podman now allows corrupt images (e.g. from restarting the system during an image pull) to be replaced by a `podman pull` of the same image (instead of requiring they be removed first, then re-pulled).

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to start containers if a Seccomp profile was not available at `/usr/share/containers/seccomp.json` ([#10556](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10556)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command failed on OS X machines with the AMD64 architecture and certain QEMU versions ([#10555](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10555)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would always use the slow path for joining the rootless user namespace.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command would fail on Cgroups v1 systems when run on a container running systemd ([#10602](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10602)).
- Fixed a bug where pre-checkpoint support for `podman container checkpoint` did not function correctly.
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command did not properly handle the `-f` option ([#9871](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9871)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman run` command would sometimes not resize the container's terminal before execution began ([#9859](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9859)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--filter` option to the `podman image prune` command was nonfunctional.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs -f` command would exit before all output for a container was printed when the `k8s-file` log driver was in use ([#10596](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10596)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not correctly detect that systemd-resolved was in use on the host and adjust DNS servers in the container appropriately under some circumstances ([#10570](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10570)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands acted improperly when containers were in the Created state, marking the changes as done but not actually performing them.

### API
- Fixed a bug where the Compat and Libpod Prune endpoints for Networks returned null, instead of an empty array, when nothing was pruned.
- Fixed a bug where the Create API for Images would continue to pull images even if a client closed the connection mid-pull ([#7558](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7558)).
- Fixed a bug where the Events API did not include some information (including labels) when sending events.
- Fixed a bug where the Events API would, when streaming was not requested, send at most one event ([#10529](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10529)).

### Misc
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.38.9


3.2.0:

### Features
- Docker Compose is now supported with rootless Podman ([#9169](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9169)).
- The `podman network connect`, `podman network disconnect`, and `podman network reload` commands have been enabled for rootless Podman.
- An experimental new set of commands, `podman machine`, was added to assist in managing virtual machines containing a Podman server. These are intended for easing the use of Podman on OS X by handling the creation of a Linux VM for running Podman.
- The `podman generate kube` command can now be run on Podman named volumes (generating `PersistentVolumeClaim` YAML), in addition to pods and containers.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports two new options, `--ip` and `--mac`, to set static IPs and MAC addresses for created pods ([#8442](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8442) and [#9731](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9731)).
- The `podman play kube` command's support for `PersistentVolumeClaim` YAML has been greatly improved.
- The `podman generate kube` command now preserves the label used by `podman auto-update` to identify containers to update as a Kubernetes annotation, and the `podman play kube` command will convert this annotation back into a label. This allows `podman auto-update` to be used with containers created by `podman play kube`.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes `secretRef` YAML (using the secrets support from `podman secret`) for environment variables.
- Secrets can now be added to containers as environment variables using the `type=env` option to the `--secret` flag to `podman create` and `podman run`.
- The `podman start` command now supports the `--all` option, allowing all containers to be started simultaneously with a single command. The `--filter` option has also been added to filter which containers to start when `--all` is used.
- Filtering containers with the `--filter` option to `podman ps` and `podman start` now supports a new filter, `restart-policy`, to filter containers based on their restart policy.
- The `--group-add` option to rootless `podman run` and `podman create` now accepts a new value, `keep-groups`, which instructs Podman to retain the supplemental groups of the user running Podman in the created container. This is only supported with the `crun` OCI runtime.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--timeout`. This sets a maximum time the container is allowed to run, after which it is killed ([#6412](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6412)).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--pidfile`. This will create a file when the container is started containing the PID of the first process in the container.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--requires`. The `--requires` option adds dependency containers - containers that must be running before the current container. Commands like `podman start` will automatically start the requirements of a container before starting the container itself.
- Auto-updating containers can now be done with locally-built images, not just images hosted on a registry, by creating containers with the `io.containers.autoupdate` label set to `local`.
- Podman now supports the [Container Device Interface](https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface) (CDI) standard.
- Podman now adds an entry to `/etc/hosts`, `host.containers.internal`, pointing to the current gateway (which, for root containers, is usually a bridge interface on the host system) ([#5651](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/5651)).
- The `podman ps`, `podman pod ps`, `podman network list`, `podman secret list`, and `podman volume list` commands now support a `--noheading` option, which will cause Podman to omit the heading line including column names.
- The `podman unshare` command now supports a new flag, `--rootless-cni`, to join the rootless network namespace. This allows commands to be run in the same network environment as rootless containers with CNI networking.
- The `--security-opt unmask=` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports glob operations to unmask a group of paths at once (e.g. `podman run --security-opt unmask=/proc/* ...` will unmask all paths in `/proc` in the container).
- The `podman network prune` command now supports a `--filter` option to filter which networks will be pruned.

### Changes
- The change in Podman 3.1.2 where the `:z` and `:Z` mount options for volumes were ignored for privileged containers has been reverted after discussion in [#10209](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10209).
- Podman's rootless CNI functionality no longer requires a sidecar container! The removal of the requirement for the `rootless-cni-infra` container means that rootless CNI is now usable on all architectures, not just AMD64, and no longer requires pulling an image ([#8709](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8709)).
- The Image handling code used by Podman has seen a major rewrite to improve code sharing with our other projects, Buildah and CRI-O. This should result in fewer bugs and performance gains in the long term. Work on this is still ongoing.
- The `podman auto-update` command now prunes previous versions of images after updating if they are unused, to prevent disk exhaustion after repeated updates ([#10190](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10190)).
- The `podman play kube` now treats environment variables configured as references to a `ConfigMap` as mandatory unless the `optional` parameter was set; this better matches the behavior of Kubernetes.
- Podman now supports the `--context=default` flag from Docker as a no-op for compatibility purposes.
- When Podman is run as root, but without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` being available, it will run in a user namespace using the same code as rootless Podman (instead of failing outright).
- The `podman info` command now includes the path of the Seccomp profile Podman is using, available cgroup controllers, and whether Podman is connected to a remote service or running containers locally.
- Containers created with the `--rm` option now automatically use the `volatile` storage flag when available for their root filesystems, causing them not to write changes to disk as often as they will be removed at completion anyways. This should result in improved performance.
- The `podman generate systemd --new` command will now include environment variables referenced by the container in generated unit files if the value would be looked up from the system environment.
- Podman now requires that Conmon v2.0.24 be available.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where the `--filter ancestor=` option to `podman ps` did not require an exact match of the image name/ID to include a container in its results.
- Fixed a bug where the `--filter until=` option to `podman image prune` would prune images created after the specified time (instead of before).
- Fixed a bug where setting a custom Seccomp profile via the `seccomp_profile` option in `containers.conf` had no effect, and the default profile was used instead.
- Fixed a bug where the `--cgroup-parent` option to `podman create` and `podman run` was ignored in rootless Podman on cgroups v2 systems with the `cgroupfs` cgroup manager ([#10173](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10173)).
- Fixed a bug where the `IMAGE` and `NAME` variables in `podman container runlabel` were not being correctly substituted ([#10192](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10192)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman could freeze when creating containers with a specific combination of volumes and working directory ([#10216](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10216)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman containers restarted by restart policy (e.g. containers created with `--restart=always`) would lose networking after being restarted ([#8047](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8047)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` command could not copy files into containers created with the `--pid=host` flag ([#9985](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9985)).
- Fixed a bug where filters to the `podman events` command could not be specified twice (if a filter is specified more than once, it will match if any of the given values match - logical or) ([#10507](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10507)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would include IPv6 nameservers in `resolv.conf` in containers without IPv6 connectivity ([#10158](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10158)).
- Fixed a bug where containers could not be created with static IP addresses when connecting to a network using the `macvlan` driver ([#10283](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10283)).

- Fixed a bug where the Compat Wait endpoint for Containers could miss containers exiting if they were immediately restarted.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Volumes required that the user provide a name for the new volume ([#9803](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9803)).
- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Info handler would sometimes not return the correct path to the Podman API socket.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Events handler used the wrong name for container exited events (`died` instead of `die`) ([#10168](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10168)).

3.2.0-RC3:

This is the third release candidate for Podman v3.2.0. We expect it will be the final RC.

Preliminary release notes follow:

### Features
- Docker Compose is now supported with rootless Podman ([#9169](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9169)).

- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command ignored the `--rm=false` option ([#9869](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9869)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate extra `--iidfile` arguments if the container was already created with one.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command produced incorrect YAML for containers which bind-mounted both `/` and `/root` from the host system into the container ([#9764](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9764)).
- Fixed a bug where pods created by `podman play kube` from YAML that specified `ShareProcessNamespace` would only share the PID namespace (and not also the UTS, Network, and IPC namespaces) ([#9128](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9128)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman network reload` command could generate spurious error messages when `iptables-nft` was in use.
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to attach to containers when the user running Podman had a large UID.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman ps` command could fail with a `no such container` error due to a race condition with container removal ([#10120](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10120)).
- Fixed a bug where containers using the `slirp4netns` network mode and setting a custom `slirp4netns` subnet while using the `rootlesskit` port forwarder would not be able to forward ports ([#9828](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9828)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--filter ancestor=` option to `podman ps` did not require an exact match of the image name/ID to include a container in its results.
- Fixed a bug where the `--filter until=` option to `podman image prune` would prune images created after the specified time (instead of before).
- Fixed a bug where setting a custom Seccomp profile via the `seccomp_profile` option in `containers.conf` had no effect, and the default profile was used instead.
- Fixed a bug where the `--cgroup-parent` option to `podman create` and `podman run` was ignored in rootless Podman on cgroups v2 systems with the `cgroupfs` cgroup manager ([#10173](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10173)).
- Fixed a bug where the `IMAGE` and `NAME` variables in `podman container runlabel` were not being correctly substituted ([#10192](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10192)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build --iidfile` command could include extra output (in addition to just the image ID) in the image ID file written ([#10233](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10233)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman could freeze when creating containers with a specific combination of volumes and working directory ([#10216](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10216)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman containers restarted by restart policy (e.g. containers created with `--restart=always`) would lose networking after being restarted ([#8047](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8047)).

### API
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not allow advanced network options to be set ([#10110](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10110)).
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers ignored static IP information provided in the `IPAMConfig` block ([#10245](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10245)).
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Containers returned null (instead of an empty list) for Networks when the container was not joined to a CNI network ([#9837](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9837)).
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Wait endpoint for Containers could miss containers exiting if they were immediately restarted.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Volumes required that the user provide a name for the new volume ([#9803](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9803)).
- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Info handler would sometimes not return the correct path to the Podman API socket.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Events handler used the wrong name for container exited events (`died` instead of `die`) ([#10168](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10168)).

- Update podman to 3.1.1

3.1.1:

### Changes
- Podman now recognizes `trace` as a valid argument to the `--log-level` command. Trace logging is now the most verbose level of logging available.
- The `:z` and `:Z` options for volume mounts are now ignored when the container is privileged or is run with SELinux isolation disabled (`--security-opt label=disable`). This matches better matches Docker's behavior in this case.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where pruning images with the `podman image prune` or `podman system prune` commands could cause Podman to panic.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman save` command did not properly error when the `--compress` flag was used with incompatible format types.
- Fixed a bug where the `--security-opt` and `--ulimit` options to the remote Podman client's `podman build` command were nonfunctional.
- Fixed a bug where the `--log-rusage` option to the remote Podman client's `podman build` command was nonfunctional ([#9489](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9889)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman build` command could, in some circumstances, use the wrong OCI runtime ([#9459](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9459)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command could return 0 despite failing ([#10029](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10029)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman container runlabel` command did not properly expand the `IMAGE` and `NAME` variables in the label ([#9405](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9405)).
- Fixed a bug where poststop OCI hooks would be executed twice on containers started with the `--rm` argument ([#9983](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9983)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to launch containers on cgroups v2 systems when the `cgroupfs` cgroup manager was in use.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command could error when statistics tracked exceeded the maximum size of a 32-bit signed integer ([#9979](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9979)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman containers run with `--userns=keepid` (without a `--user` flag in addition) would grant exec sessions run in them too many capabilities ([#9919](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9919)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--authfile` option to `podman build` did not validate that the path given existed ([#9572](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9572)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--storage-opt` option to Podman was appending to, instead of overriding (as is documented), the default storage options.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` connection did not function properly when run in a socket-activated systemd unit file as a non-root user.
- Fixed a bug where the `--network` option to the `podman play kube` command of the remote Podman client was being ignored ([#9698](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9698)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--log-driver` option to the `podman play kube` command was nonfunctional ([#10015](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10015)).

### API
- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Create endpoint for Manifests did not properly validate the image the manifest was being created with.
- Fixed a bug where the Libpod DF endpoint could, in error cases, append an extra null to the JSON response, causing decode errors.
- Fixed a bug where the Libpod and Compat Top endpoint for Containers would return process names that included extra whitespace.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Prune endpoint for Containers accepted too many types of filter.

### Misc

- Update podman to 3.1.0

3.1.0:

### Features
- A set of new commands has been added to manage secrets! The `podman secret create`, `podman secret inspect`, `podman secret ls` and `podman secret rm` commands have been added to handle secrets, along with the `--secret` option to `podman run` and `podman create` to add secrets to containers. The initial driver for secrets does not support encryption - this will be added in a future release.
- A new command to prune networks, `podman network prune`, has been added ([#8673](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8673)).
- The `-v` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new volume option, `:U`, to chown the volume's source directory on the host to match the UID and GID of the container and prevent permissions issues ([#7778](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7778)).
- Three new commands, `podman network exists`, `podman volume exists`, and `podman manifest exists`, have been added to check for the existence of networks, volumes, and manifest lists.
- The `podman cp` command can now copy files into directories mounted as `tmpfs` in a running container.
- The `podman volume prune` command will now list volumes that will be pruned when prompting the user whether to continue and perform the prune ([#8913](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8913)).
- The Podman remote client's `podman build` command now supports the `--disable-compression`, `--excludes`, and `--jobs` options.
- The Podman remote client's `podman push` command now supports the `--format` option.
- The Podman remote client's `podman rm` command now supports the `--all` and `--ignore` options.
- The Podman remote client's `podman search` command now supports the `--no-trunc` and `--list-tags` options.
- The `podman play kube` command can now read in Kubernetes YAML from `STDIN` when `-` is specified as file name (`podman play kube -`), allowing input to be piped into the command for scripting ([#8996](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8996)).
- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a `--no-header` option, which disables creation of the header comment automatically added by Podman to generated unit files.
- The `podman generate kube` command can now generate `PersistentVolumeClaim` YAML for Podman named volumes ([#5788](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/5788)).
- The `podman generate kube` command can now generate YAML files containing multiple resources (pods or deployments) ([#9129](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9129)).

### Security
- This release resolves CVE-2021-20291, a deadlock vulnerability in the storage library caused by pulling a specially-crafted container image.

### Changes
- The Podman remote client's `podman build` command no longer allows the `-v` flag to be used. Volumes are not yet supported with remote Podman when the client and service are on different machines.
- The `podman kill` and `podman stop` commands now print the name given by the user for each container, instead of the full ID.
- When the `--security-opt unmask=ALL` or `--security-opt unmask=/sys/fs/cgroup` options to `podman create` or `podman run` are given, Podman will mount cgroups into the container as read-write, instead of read-only ([#8441](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8441)).
- The `podman rmi` command has been changed to better handle cases where an image is incomplete or corrupted, which can be caused by interrupted image pulls.
- The `podman rename` command has been improved to be more atomic, eliminating many race conditions that could potentially render a renamed container unusable.
- Detection of which OCI runtimes run using virtual machines and thus require custom SELinux labelling has been improved ([#9582](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9582)).
- The hidden `--trace` option to `podman` has been turned into a no-op. It was used in very early versions for performance tracing, but has not been supported for some time.
- The `podman generate systemd` command now generates `RequiresMountsFor` lines to ensure necessary storage directories are mounted before systemd starts Podman.
- Podman will now emit a warning when `--tty` and `--interactive` are both passed, but `STDIN` is not a TTY. This will be made into an error in the next major Podman release some time next year.

### Misc
- Updated Buildah to v1.20.0
- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.28.1
- Updated the containers/image library to v5.10.5
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.35.4


3.1.0-RC2:

This is the second release candidate for Podman v3.1.0

Preliminary release notes are below. Please note that these are subject to change until the final release.

### Features
- A set of new commands has been added to manage secrets! The `podman secret create`, `podman secret inspect`, `podman secret ls` and `podman secret rm` commands have been added to handle secrets, along with the `--secret` option to `podman run` and `podman create` to add secrets to containers. The initial driver for secrets does not support encryption - this will be added in a future release.
- A new command to prune networks, `podman network prune`, has been added ([#8673](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8673)).
- The `-v` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new volume option, `:U`, to chown the volume's source directory on the host to match the UID and GID of the container and prevent permissions issues ([#7778](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7778)).
- Three new commands, `podman network exists`, `podman volume exists`, and `podman manifest exists`, have been added to check for the existence of networks, volumes, and manifest lists.
- The `podman cp` command can now copy files into directories mounted as `tmpfs` in a running container.
- The `podman volume prune` command will now list volumes that will be pruned when prompting the user whether to continue and perform the prune ([#8913](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8913)).
- The Podman remote client's `podman build` command now supports the `--disable-compression`, `--excludes`, and `--jobs` options.
- The Podman remote client's `podman push` command now supports the `--format` option.
- The Podman remote client's `podman rm` command now supports the `--all` and `--ignore` options.
- The Podman remote client's `podman search` command now supports the `--no-trunc` and `--list-tags` options.
- The `podman play kube` command can now read in Kubernetes YAML from `STDIN` when `-` is specified as file name (`podman play kube -`), allowing input to be piped into the command for scripting ([#8996](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8996)).
- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a `--no-header` option, which disables creation of the header comment automatically added by Podman to generated unit files.

### Changes
- The Podman remote client's `podman build` command no longer allows the `-v` flag to be used. Volumes are not yet supported with remote Podman when the client and service are on different machines.
- The `podman kill` and `podman stop` commands now print the name given by the user for each container, instead of the full ID.
- When the `--security-opt unmask=ALL` or `--security-opt unmask=/sys/fs/cgroup` options to `podman create` or `podman run` are given, Podman will mount cgroups into the container as read-write, instead of read-only ([#8441](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8441)).
- The `podman rmi` command has been changed to better handle cases where an image is incomplete or corrupted, which can be caused by interrupted image pulls.
- The `podman rename` command has been improved to be more atomic, eliminating many race conditions that could potentially render a renamed container unusable.
- Detection of which OCI runtimes run using virtual machines and thus require custom SELinux labelling has been improved ([#9582](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9582)).
- The hidden `--trace` option to `podman` has been turned into a no-op. It was used in very early versions for performance tracing, but has not been supported for some time.

- Update podmanver to 3.0.1

3.0.1:

### Changes
- Several frequently-occurring `WARN` level log messages have been downgraded to `INFO` or `DEBUG` to not clutter terminal output.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `Created` field of `podman ps --format=json` was formatted as a string instead of an Unix timestamp (integer) ([#9315](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9315)).
- Fixed a bug where failing lookups of individual layers during the `podman images` command would cause the whole command to fail without printing output.
- Fixed a bug where `--cgroups=split` did not function properly on cgroups v1 systems.
- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over an directory in the container that existed, but was empty, could fail ([#9393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9393)).
- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over a directory in the container that existed could copy the entirety of the container's rootfs, instead of just the directory mounted over, into the volume ([#9415](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/9415)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would treat the `--entrypoint=[""]` option to `podman run` and `podman create` as a literal empty string in the entrypoint, when instead it should have been ignored ([#9377](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9377)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would set the `HOME` environment variable to `""` when the container ran as a user without an assigned home directory ([#9378](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9378)).
- Fixed a bug where specifying a pod infra image that had no tags (by using its ID) would cause `podman pod create` to panic ([#9374](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9374)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--runtime` option was not properly handled by the `podman build` command ([#9365](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9365)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would incorrectly print an error message related to the remote API when the remote API was not in use and starting Podman failed.
- Fixed a bug where Podman would change ownership of a container's working directory, even if it already existed ([#9387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9387)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command would incorrectly escape `%t` when generating the path for the PID file ([#9373](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9373)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman could, when run inside a Podman container with the host's containers/storage directory mounted into the container, erroneously detect a reboot and reset container state if the temporary directory was not also mounted in ([#9191](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9191)).
- Fixed a bug where some options of the `podman build` command (including but not limited to `--jobs`) were nonfunctional ([#9247](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9247)).

### API
- Fixed a breaking change to the Libpod Wait API for Containers where the Conditions parameter changed type in Podman v3.0 ([#9351](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9351)).
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle forwarded ports that did not specify a host port.
- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Wait endpoint for Containers could write duplicate headers after an error occurred.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Images would not pull images that already had a matching tag present locally, even if a more recent version was available at the registry ([#9232](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9232)).
- The Compat Create endpoint for Images has had its compatibility with Docker improved, allowing its use with the `docker-java` library.

### Misc
- Updated Buildah to v1.19.4
- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.6


3.0.0:

### Features
- Podman now features initial support for Docker Compose.
- Added the `podman rename` command, which allows containers to be renamed after they are created ([#1925](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/1925)).
- The Podman remote client now supports the `podman copy` command.
- A new command, `podman network reload`, has been added. This command will re-configure the network of all running containers, and can be used to recreate firewall rules lost when the system firewall was reloaded (e.g. via `firewall-cmd --reload`).
- Podman networks now have IDs. They can be seen in `podman network ls` and can be used when removing and inspecting networks. Existing networks receive IDs automatically.
- Podman networks now also support labels. They can be added via the `--label` option to `network create`, and `podman network ls` can filter labels based on them.
- The `podman network create` command now supports setting bridge MTU and VLAN through the `--opt` option ([#8454](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8454)).
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands can now checkpoint and restore containers that include volumes.
- The `podman container checkpoint` command now supports the `--with-previous` and `--pre-checkpoint` options, and the `podman container restore` command now support the `--import-previous` option. These add support for two-step checkpointing with lowered dump times.
- The `podman push` command can now push manifest lists. Podman will first attempt to push as an image, then fall back to pushing as a manifest list if that fails.
- The `podman generate kube` command can now be run on multiple containers at once, and will generate a single pod containing all of them.
- The `podman generate kube` and `podman play kube` commands now support Kubernetes DNS configuration, and will preserve custom DNS configuration when exporting or importing YAML ([#9132](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9132)).
- The `podman generate kube` command now properly supports generating YAML for containers and pods creating using host networking (`--net=host`) ([#9077](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9077)).
- The `podman kill` command now supports a `--cidfile` option to kill containers given a file containing the container's ID ([#8443](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8443)).
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--net=none` option ([#9165](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9165)).
- The `podman volume create` command can now specify volume UID and GID as options with the `UID` and `GID` fields passed to the the `--opt` option.
- Initial support has been added for Docker Volume Plugins. Podman can now define available plugins in `containers.conf` and use them to create volumes with `podman volume create --driver`.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--platform`, to specify the platform of the image to be used when creating the container.
- The `--security-opt` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports the `systempaths=unconfined` option to unrestrict access to all paths in the container, as well as `mask` and `unmask` options to allow more granular restriction of container paths.
- The `podman stats --format` command now supports a new format specified, `MemUsageBytes`, which prints the raw bytes of memory consumed by a container without human-readable formatting [#8945](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8945).
- The `podman ps` command can now filter containers based on what pod they are joined to via the `pod` filter ([#8512](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8512)).
- The `podman pod ps` command can now filter pods based on what networks they are joined to via the `network` filter.
- The `podman pod ps` command can now print information on what networks a pod is joined to via the `.Networks` specifier to the `--format` option.
- The `podman system prune` command now supports filtering what containers, pods, images, and volumes will be pruned.
- The `podman volume prune` commands now supports filtering what volumes will be pruned.
- The `podman system prune` command now includes information on space reclaimed ([#8658](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8658)).
- The `podman info` command will now properly print information about packages in use on Gentoo and Arch systems.
- The `containers.conf` file now contains an option for disabling creation of a new kernel keyring on container creation ([#8384](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8384)).
- The `podman image sign` command can now sign multi-arch images by producing a signature for each image in a given manifest list.
- The `podman image sign` command, when run as rootless, now supports per-user registry configuration files in `$HOME/.config/containers/registries.d`.
- Configuration options for `slirp4netns` can now be set system-wide via the `NetworkCmdOptions` configuration option in `containers.conf`.
- The MTU of `slirp4netns` can now be configured via the `mtu=` network command option (e.g. `podman run --net slirp4netns:mtu=9000`).

### Security
- A fix for CVE-2021-20199 is included. Podman between v1.8.0 and v2.2.1 used `127.0.0.1` as the source address for all traffic forwarded into rootless containers by a forwarded port; this has been changed to address the issue.

### Changes
- Shortname aliasing support has now been turned on by default. All Podman commands that must pull an image will, if a TTY is available, prompt the user about what image to pull.
- The `podman load` command no longer accepts a `NAME[:TAG]` argument. The presence of this argument broke CLI compatibility with Docker by making `docker load` commands unusable with Podman ([#7387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7387)).
- The Go bindings for the HTTP API have been rewritten with a focus on limiting dependency footprint and improving extensibility. Read more [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/v3.0/pkg/bindings/README.md).
- The legacy Varlink API has been completely removed from Podman.
- The default log level for Podman has been changed from Error to Warn.
- The `podman network create` command can now create `macvlan` networks using the `--driver macvlan` option for Docker compatibility. The existing `--macvlan` flag has been deprecated and will be removed in Podman 4.0 some time next year.
- The `podman inspect` command has had the `LogPath` and `LogTag` fields moved into the `LogConfig` structure (from the root of the Inspect structure). The maximum size of the log file is also included.
- The `podman generate systemd` command no longer generates unit files using the deprecated `KillMode=none` option ([#8615](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8615)).
- The `podman stop` command now releases the container lock while waiting for it to stop - as such, commands like `podman ps` will no longer block until `podman stop` completes ([#8501](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8501)).
- Networks created with `podman network create --internal` no longer use the `dnsname` plugin. This configuration never functioned as expected.
- Error messages for the remote Podman client have been improved when it cannot connect to a Podman service.
- Error messages for `podman run` when an invalid SELinux is specified have been improved.
- Rootless Podman features improved support for containers with a single user mapped into the rootless user namespace.
- Pod infra containers now respect default sysctls specified in `containers.conf` allowing for advanced configuration of the namespaces they will share.
- SSH public key handling for remote Podman has been improved.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman history --no-trunc` command would truncate the `Created By` field ([#9120](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9120)).
- Fixed a bug where root containers that did not explicitly specify a CNI network to join did not generate an entry for the network in use in the `Networks` field of the output of `podman inspect` ([#6618](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6618)).
- Fixed a bug where, under some circumstances, container working directories specified by the image (via the `WORKDIR` instruction) but not present in the image, would not be created ([#9040](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9040)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd` command would generate invalid unit files if the container was creating using a command line that included doubled braces (`{{` and `}}`), e.g. `--log-opt-tag={{.Name}}` ([#9034](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9034)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate unit files including invalid Podman commands if the container was created using merged short options (e.g. `podman run -dt`) ([#8847](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8847)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate unit files that did not handle Podman commands including some special characters (e.g. `$`) ([#9176](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9176)
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers joining CNI networks could not set a static IP address ([#7842](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7842)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers joining CNI networks could not set network aliases ([#8567](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8567)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote client could, under some circumstances, not include the `Containerfile` when sending build context to the server ([#8374](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8374)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman did not mount `/sys` as a new `sysfs` in some circumstances where it was acceptable.
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers that both joined a user namespace and a CNI networks would cause a segfault. These options are incompatible and now return an error.

- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command errored when `hostNetwork` was used ([#8790](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8790)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command would always pull images when the `:latest` tag was specified, even if the image was available locally ([#7838](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7838)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command did not properly handle SELinux configuration, rending YAML with custom SELinux configuration unusable ([#8710](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8710)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command incorrectly populated the `args` and `command` fields of generated YAML ([#9211](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9211)).
- Fixed a bug where containers in a pod would create a duplicate entry in the pod's shared `/etc/hosts` file every time the container restarted ([#8921](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8921)).

- Fixed a bug where Podman would not build on the MIPS architecture ([#8782](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8782)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to properly configure user namespaces for rootless containers when the user specified a `--uidmap` option that included a mapping beginning with UID `0`.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs` command using the `k8s-file` backend did not properly handle partial log lines with a length of 1 ([#8879](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8879)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs` command with the `--follow` option did not properly handle log rotation ([#8733](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8733)).
- Fixed a bug where user-specified `HOSTNAME` environment variables were overwritten by Podman ([#8886](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8886)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would applied default sysctls from `containers.conf` in too many situations (e.g. applying network sysctls when the container shared its network with a pod).
- Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly handle cases where a secondary image store was in use and an image was present in both the secondary and primary stores ([#8176](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8176)).
- Fixed a bug where systemd-managed rootless Podman containers where the user in the container was not root could fail as the container's PID file was not accessible to systemd on the host ([#8506](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8506)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--privileged` option to `podman run` and `podman create` would, under some circumstances, not disable Seccomp ([#8849](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8849)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman exec` command did not properly add capabilities when the container or exec session were run with `--privileged`.
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would use the `--enable-sandbox` option to `slirp4netns` unconditionally, even when `pivot_root` was disabled, rendering `slirp4netns` unusable when `pivot_root` was disabled ([#8846](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8846)).
- Fixed a bug where `podman build --logfile` did not actually write the build's log to the logfile.

- The `podman generate kube` and `podman play kube` commands now support Kubernetes DNS configuration, and will preserve custom DNS configuration when exporting or importing YAML ([#9132](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9132)).
- The `podman generate kube` command now properly supports generating YAML for containers and pods creating using host networking (`--net=host`) ([#9077](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9077)).
- The `podman kill` command now supports a `--cidfile` option to kill containers given a file containing the container's ID ([#8443](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8443)).
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--net=none` option ([#9165](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9165)).
- The `podman volume create` command can now specify volume UID and GID as options with the `UID` and `GID` fields passed to the the `--opt` option.
- Initial support has been added for Docker Volume Plugins. Podman can now define available plugins in `containers.conf` and use them to create volumes with `podman volume create --driver`.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--platform`, to specify the platform of the image to be used when creating the container.
- The `--security-opt` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports the `systempaths=unconfined` option to unrestrict access to all paths in the container, as well as `mask` and `unmask` options to allow more granular restriction of container paths.
- The `podman stats --format` command now supports a new format specified, `MemUsageBytes`, which prints the raw bytes of memory consumed by a container without human-readable formatting [#8945](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8945).
- The `podman ps` command can now filter containers based on what pod they are joined to via the `pod` filter ([#8512](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8512)).

- The `podman pod ps` command can now print information on what networks a pod is joined to via the `.Networks` specifier to the `--format` option.
- The `podman system prune` command now supports filtering what containers, pods, images, and volumes will be pruned.
- The `podman volume prune` commands now supports filtering what volumes will be pruned.
- The `podman system prune` command now includes information on space reclaimed ([#8658](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8658)).
- The `podman info` command will now properly print information about packages in use on Gentoo and Arch systems.
- The `containers.conf` file now contains an option for disabling creation of a new kernel keyring on container creation ([#8384](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8384)).
- The `podman image sign` command can now sign multi-arch images by producing a signature for each image in a given manifest list.
- The `podman image sign` command, when run as rootless, now supports per-user registry configuration files in `$HOME/.config/containers/registries.d`.
- Configuration options for `slirp4netns` can now be set system-wide via the `NetworkCmdOptions` configuration option in `containers.conf`.
- The MTU of `slirp4netns` can now be configured via the `mtu=` network command option (e.g. `podman run --net slirp4netns:mtu=9000`).

### Security
- A fix for CVE-2021-20199 is included. Podman between v1.8.0 and v2.2.1 used `127.0.0.1` as the source address for all traffic forwarded into rootless containers by a forwarded port; this has been changed to address the issue.

### Changes
- Shortname aliasing support has now been turned on by default. All Podman commands that must pull an image will, if a TTY is available, prompt the user about what image to pull.
- The `podman load` command no longer accepts a `NAME[:TAG]` argument. The presence of this argument broke CLI compatibility with Docker by making `docker load` commands unusable with Podman ([#7387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7387)).
- The Go bindings for the HTTP API have been rewritten with a focus on limiting dependency footprint and improving extensibility. Read more [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/v3.0/pkg/bindings/README.md).
- The legacy Varlink API has been completely removed from Podman.
- The default log level for Podman has been changed from Error to Warn.
- The `podman network create` command can now create `macvlan` networks using the `--driver macvlan` option for Docker compatibility. The existing `--macvlan` flag has been deprecated and will be removed in Podman 4.0 some time next year.
- The `podman inspect` command has had the `LogPath` and `LogTag` fields moved into the `LogConfig` structure (from the root of the Inspect structure). The maximum size of the log file is also included.
- The `podman generate systemd` command no longer generates unit files using the deprecated `KillMode=none` option ([#8615](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8615)).
- The `podman stop` command now releases the container lock while waiting for it to stop - as such, commands like `podman ps` will no longer block until `podman stop` completes ([#8501](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8501)).
- Networks created with `podman network create --internal` no longer use the `dnsname` plugin. This configuration never functioned as expected.
- Error messages for the remote Podman client have been improved when it cannot connect to a Podman service.
- Error messages for `podman run` when an invalid SELinux is specified have been improved.
- Rootless Podman features improved support for containers with a single user mapped into the rootless user namespace.
- Pod infra containers now respect default sysctls specified in `containers.conf` allowing for advanced configuration of the namespaces they will share.
- SSH public key handling for remote Podman has been improved.

- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate unit files including invalid Podman commands if the container was created using merged short options (e.g. `podman run -dt`) ([#8847](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8847)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate unit files that did not handle Podman commands including some special characters (e.g. `$`) ([#9176](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9176)
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers joining CNI networks could not set a static IP address ([#7842](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7842)).

- Update podman to 2.2.1

v2.2.1

### Changes
- Due to a conflict with a previously-removed field, we were forced to modify the way image volumes (mounting images into containers using `--mount type=image`) were handled in the database. As a result, containers created in Podman 2.2.0 with image volumes will not have them in v2.2.1, and these containers will need to be re-created.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would, on systems without the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable defined, use an incorrect path for the PID file of the Podman pause process, causing Podman to fail to start ([#8539](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8539)).
- Fixed a bug where containers created using Podman v1.7 and earlier were unusable in Podman due to JSON decode errors ([#8613](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8613)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman could retrieve invalid cgroup paths, instead of erroring, for containers that were not running.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system reset` command would print a warning about a duplicate shutdown handler being registered.
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to mount `sysfs` in circumstances where it was not allowed; some OCI runtimes (notably `crun`) would fall back to alternatives and not fail, but others (notably `runc`) would fail to run containers.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` and `podman create` commands would fail to create containers from untagged images ([#8558](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8558)).
- Fixed a bug where remote Podman would prompt for a password even when the server did not support password authentication ([#8498](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8498)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman exec` command did not move the Conmon process for the exec session into the correct cgroup.
- Fixed a bug where shell completion for the `ancestor` option to `podman ps --filter` did not work correctly.
- Fixed a bug where detached containers would not properly clean themselves up (or remove themselves if `--rm` was set) if the Podman command that created them was invoked with `--log-level=debug`.

### API
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle the `Binds` and `Mounts` parameters in `HostConfig`.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers ignored the `Name` query parameter.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle the "default" value for `NetworkMode` (this value is used extensively by `docker-compose`) ([#8544](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8544)).
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Build endpoint for Images would sometimes incorrectly use the `target` query parameter as the image's tag.

### Misc
- Podman v2.2.0 vendored a non-released, custom version of the `github.com/spf13/cobra` package; this has been reverted to the latest upstream release to aid in packaging.
- Updated the containers/image library to v5.9.0

v2.2.0

### Features
- Experimental support for shortname aliasing has been added. This is not enabled by default, but can be turned on by setting the environment variable `CONTAINERS_SHORT_NAME_ALIASING` to `on`. Documentation is [available here](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md#short-name-aliasing) and [here](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-image-short-names).
- Initial support has been added for the `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands, which allow existing containers to modify what networks they are connected to. At present, these commands can only be used on running containers that did not specify `--network=none` when they were created.
- The `podman run` command now supports the `--network-alias` option to set network aliases (additional names the container can be accessed at from other containers via DNS if the `dnsname` CNI plugin is in use). Aliases can also be added and removed using the new `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands. Please note that this requires a new release (v1.1.0) of the `dnsname` plugin, and will only work on newly-created CNI networks.
- The `podman generate kube` command now features support for exporting container's memory and CPU limits ([#7855](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7855)).
- The `podman play kube` command now features support for setting CPU and Memory limits for containers ([#7742](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7742)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports persistent volumes claims using Podman named volumes.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes configmaps via the `--configmap` option ([#7567](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7567)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a `--log-driver` option to set the log driver for created containers.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a `--start` option, enabled by default, to start the pod after creating it. This allows for `podman play kube` to be more easily used in systemd unitfiles.
- The `podman network create` command now supports the `--ipv6` option to enable dual-stack IPv6 networking for created networks ([#7302](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7302)).
- The `podman inspect` command can now inspect pods, networks, and volumes, in addition to containers and images ([#6757](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6757)).
- The `--mount` option for `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new type, `image`, to mount the contents of an image into the container at a given location.
- The Bash and ZSH completions have been completely reworked and have received significant enhancements! Additionally, support for Fish completions and completions for the `podman-remote` executable have been added.
- The `--log-opt` option for `podman create` and `podman run` now supports the `max-size` option to set the maximum size for a container's logs ([#7434](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7434)).
- The `--network` option to the `podman pod create` command now allows pods to be configured to use `slirp4netns` networking, even when run as root ([#6097](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6097)).
- The `podman pod stop`, `podman pod pause`, `podman pod unpause`, and `podman pod kill` commands now work on multiple containers in parallel and should be significantly faster.
- The `podman search` command now supports a `--list-tags` option to list all available tags for a single image in a single repository.
- The `podman search` command can now output JSON using the `--format=json` option.
- The `podman diff` and `podman mount` commands now work with all containers in the storage library, including those not created by Podman. This allows them to be used with Buildah and CRI-O containers.
- The `podman container exists` command now features a `--external` option to check if a container exists not just in Podman, but also in the storage library. This will allow Podman to identify Buildah and CRI-O containers.
- The `--tls-verify` and `--authfile` options have been enabled for use with remote Podman.
- The `/etc/hosts` file now includes the container's name and hostname (both pointing to localhost) when the container is run with `--net=none` ([#8095](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8095)).
- The `podman events` command now supports filtering events based on the labels of the container they occurred on using the `--filter label=key=value` option.
- The `podman volume ls` command now supports filtering volumes based on their labels using the `--filter label=key=value` option.
- The `--volume` and `--mount` options to `podman run` and `podman create` now support two new mount propagation options, `unbindable` and `runbindable`.
- The `name` and `id` filters for `podman pod ps` now match based on a regular expression, instead of requiring an exact match.
- The `podman pod ps` command now supports a new filter `status`, that matches pods in a certain state.

### Changes
- The `podman network rm --force` command will now also remove pods that are using the network ([#7791](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7791)).
- The `podman volume rm`, `podman network rm`, and `podman pod rm` commands now return exit code 1 if the object specified for removal does not exist, and exit code 2 if the object is in use and the `--force` option was not given.
- If `/dev/fuse` is passed into Podman containers as a device, Podman will open it before starting the container to ensure that the kernel module is loaded on the host and the device is usable in the container.
- Global Podman options that were not supported with remote operation have been removed from `podman-remote` (e.g. `--cgroup-manager`, `--storage-driver`).
- Many errors have been changed to remove repetition and be more clear as to what has gone wrong.
- The `--storage` option to `podman rm` is now enabled by default, with slightly changed semantics. If the given container does not exist in Podman but does exist in the storage library, it will be removed even without the `--storage` option. If the container exists in Podman it will be removed normally. The `--storage` option for `podman rm` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- The `--storage` option to `podman ps` has been renamed to `--external`. An alias has been added so the old form of the option will continue to work.
- Podman now delays the SIGTERM and SIGINT signals during container creation to ensure that Podman is not stopped midway through creating a container resulting in potential resource leakage ([#7941](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7941)).
- The `podman save` command now strips signatures from images it is exporting, as the formats we export to do not support signatures ([#7659](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7659)).
- A new `Degraded` state has been added to pods. Pods that have some, but not all, of their containers running are now considered to be `Degraded` instead of `Running`.
- Podman will now print a warning when conflicting network options related to port forwarding (e.g. `--publish` and `--net=host`) are specified when creating a container.
- The `--restart on-failure` and `--rm` options for containers no longer conflict. When both are specified, the container will be restarted if it exits with a non-zero error code, and removed if it exits cleanly ([#7906](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7906)).
- Remote Podman will no longer use settings from the client's `containers.conf`; defaults will instead be provided by the server's `containers.conf` ([#7657](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7657)).
- The `podman network rm` command now has a new alias, `podman network remove` ([#8402](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8402)).

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where `podman load` on the remote client did not error when attempting to load a directory, which is not yet supported for remote use.
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could hang when the `newuidmap` binary was not installed ([#7776](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7776)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--pull` option to `podman run`, `podman create`,  and `podman build` did not match Docker's behavior.
- Fixed a bug where sysctl settings from the `containers.conf` configuration file were applied, even if the container did not join the namespace associated with a sysctl.
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not return the text of errors encounted when trying to run a healthcheck for a container.
- Fixed a bug where Podman was accidentally setting the `containers` environment variable in addition to the expected `container` environment variable.
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman using CNI networking did not properly clean up DNS entries for removed containers ([#7789](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7789)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman untag --all` command was not supported with remote Podman.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command could time out even if active attach connections were present ([#7826](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7826)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command would sometimes never time out despite no active connections being present.
- Fixed a bug where Podman's handling of capabilities, specifically inheritable, did not match Docker's.
- Fixed a bug where `podman run` would fail if the image specified was a manifest list and had already been pulled ([#7798](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/7798)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman did not take search registries into account when looking up images locally ([#6381](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6381)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest inspect` command would fail for images that had already been pulled ([#7726](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7726)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add supplemental GIDs to containers when when a user, but not a group, was set via the `--user` option to `podman create` and `podman run` and sufficient GIDs were available to add the groups ([#7782](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7782)).
- Fixed a bug where remote Podman commands did not properly handle cases where the user gave a name that could also be a short ID for a pod or container ([#7837](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7837)).
- Fixed a bug where `podman image prune` could leave images ready to be pruned after `podman image prune` was run ([#7872](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7872)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs` command with the `journald` log driver would not read all available logs ([#7476](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7476)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--rm` and `--restart` options to `podman create` and `podman run` did not conflict when a restart policy that is not `on-failure` was chosen ([#7878](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7878)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--format "table {{ .Field }}"` option to numerous Podman commands ceased to function on Podman v2.0 and up.
- Fixed a bug where pods did not properly share an SELinux label between their containers, resulting in containers being unable to see the processes of other containers when the pod shared a PID namespace ([#7886](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7886)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--namespace` option to `podman ps` did not work with the remote client ([#7903](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7903)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman incorrectly calculated the number of UIDs available in the container if multiple different ranges of UIDs were specified.

v2.2.0-RC1

This is the first release candidate for Podman v2.2.0. Preliminary release notes are below:

## 2.2.0
### Features
- Experimental support for shortname aliasing has been added. This is not enabled by default, but can be turned on by setting the environment variable `CONTAINERS_SHORT_NAME_ALIASING` to `on`. Documentation is [available here](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md#short-name-aliasing).
- The `podman generate kube` command now features support for exporting container's memory and CPU limits ([#7855](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7855)).
- The `podman play kube` command now features support for setting CPU and Memory limits for containers ([#7742](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7742)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes configmaps via the `--configmap` option ([#7567](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7567)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a `--log-driver` option to set the log driver for created containers.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a `--start` option, enabled by default, to start the pod after creating it. This allows for `podman play kube` to be more easily used in systemd unitfiles.
- The `podman run` command now supports the `--network-alias` option to set network aliases (additional names the container can be accessed at from other containers via DNS if the `dnsname` CNI plugin is in use). Please note that this requires a new release (v1.1.0) of the `dnsname` plugin, and will only work on newly-created CNI networks.
- The `podman network create` command now supports the `--ipv6` option to enable dual-stack IPv6 networking for created networks ([#7302](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7302)).
- The `podman inspect` command can now inspect pods, networks, and volumes, in addition to containers and images ([#6757](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6757)).
- The `--mount` option for `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new type, `image`, to mount the contents of an image into the container at a given location.
- The Bash and ZSH completions have been completely reworked and have received significant enhancements! Additionally, support for Fish completions and completions for the `podman-remote` executable have been added.
- The `--log-opt` option for `podman create` and `podman run` now supports the `max-size` option to set the maximum size for a container's logs ([#7434](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7434)).
- The `--network` option to the `podman pod create` command now allows pods to be configured to use `slirp4netns` networking, even when run as root ([#6097](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6097)).
- The `podman pod stop`, `podman pod pause`, `podman pod unpause`, and `podman pod kill` commands now work on multiple containers in parallel and should be significantly faster.
- The `podman search` command now supports a `--list-tags` option to list all available tags for a single image in a single repository.
- The `podman search` command can now output JSON using the `--format=json` option.
- The `podman diff` and `podman mount` commands now work with all containers in the storage library, including those not created by Podman. This allows them to be used with Buildah and CRI-O containers.
- The `podman container exists` command now features a `--external` option to check if a container exists not just in Podman, but also in the storage library. This will allow Podman to identify Buildah and CRI-O containers.
- The `--tls-verify` and `--authfile` options have been enabled for use with remote Podman.
- The `/etc/hosts` file now includes the container's name and hostname (both pointing to localhost) when the container is run with `--net=none` ([#8095](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8095)).
- The `podman events` command now supports filtering events based on the labels of the container they occurred on using the `--filter label=key=value` option.
- The `podman volume ls` command now supports filtering volumes based on their labels using the `--filter label=key=value` option.
- The `--volume` and `--mount` options to `podman run` and `podman create` now support two new mount propagation options, `unbindable` and `runbindable`.
- The `name` filter for `podman pod ps` now matches based on a regular expression, instead of requiring an exact match.

### Changes
- The `podman network rm --force` command will now also remove pods that are using the network ([#7791](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7791)).
- The `podman volume rm`, `podman network rm`, and `podman pod rm` commands now return exit code 1 if the object specified for removal does not exist, and exit code 2 if the object is in use and the `--force` option was not given.
- If `/dev/fuse` is passed into Podman containers as a device, Podman will open it before starting the container to ensure that the kernel module is loaded on the host and the device is usable in the container.
- Global Podman options that were not supported with remote operation have been removed from `podman-remote` (e.g. `--cgroup-manager`, `--storage-driver`).
- Many errors have been changed to remove repetition and be more clear as to what has gone wrong.
- The `--storage` option to `podman rm` is now enabled by default, with slightly changed semantics. If the given container does not exist in Podman but does exist in the storage library, it will be removed even without the `--storage` option. If the container exists in Podman it will be removed normally. The `--storage` option for `podman rm` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- The `--storage` option to `podman ps` has been renamed to `--external`. An alias has been added so the old form of the option will continue to work.
- Podman now delays the SIGTERM and SIGINT signals during container creation to ensure that Podman is not stopped midway through creating a container resulting in potential resource leakage ([#7941](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7941)).
- The `podman save` command now strips signatures from images it is exporting, as the formats we export to do not support signatures ([#7659](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7659)).
- A new `Degraded` state has been added to pods. Pods that have some, but not all, of their containers running are now considered to be `Degraded` instead of `Running`.

v2.1.0

### Features
- A new command, `podman image mount`, has been added. This allows for an image to be mounted, read-only, to inspect its contents without creating a container from it ([#1433](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/1433)).
- The `podman save` and `podman load` commands can now create and load archives containing multiple images ([#2669](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/2669)).
- Rootless Podman now supports all `podman network` commands, and rootless containers can now be joined to networks.
- The performance of `podman build` on `ADD` and `COPY` instructions has been greatly improved, especially when a `.dockerignore` is present.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new mode for the `--cgroups` option, `--cgroups=split`. Podman will create two cgroups under the cgroup it was launched in, one for the container and one for Conmon. This mode is useful for running Podman in a systemd unit, as it ensures that all processes are retained in systemd's cgroup hierarchy ([#6400](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6400)).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now specify options to slirp4netns by using the `--network` option as follows:  `--net slirp4netns:opt1,opt2`. This allows for, among other things, switching the port forwarder used by slirp4netns away from rootlessport.
- The `podman ps` command now features a new option, `--storage`, to show containers from Buildah, CRI-O and other applications.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a `--sdnotify` option to control the behavior of systemd's sdnotify with containers, enabling improved support for Podman in `Type=notify` units.
- The `podman run` command now features a `--preserve-fds` opton to pass file descriptors from the host into the container ([#6458](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6458)).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now create overlay volume mounts, by adding the `:O` option to a bind mount (e.g. `-v /test:/test:O`). Overlay volume mounts will mount a directory into a container from the host and allow changes to it, but not write those changes back to the directory on the host.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports the Socket HostPath type ([#7112](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7112)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports read-only mounts.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports setting labels on pods from Kubernetes metadata labels.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports setting container restart policy ([#7656](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7656)).
- The `podman play kube` command now properly handles `HostAlias` entries.
- The `podman generate kube` command now adds entries to `/etc/hosts` from `--host-add` generated YAML as `HostAlias` entries.
- The `podman play kube` and `podman generate kube` commands now properly support `shareProcessNamespace` to share the PID namespace in pods.
- The `podman volume ls` command now supports the `dangling` filter to identify volumes that are dangling (not attached to any container).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a `--umask` option to set the umask of the created container.
- The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now feature a `--tz` option to set the timezone within the container ([#5128](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/5128)).
- Environment variables for Podman can now be added in the `containers.conf` configuration file.
- The `--mount` option of `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new mount type, `type=devpts`, to add a `devpts` mount to the container. This is useful for containers that want to mount `/dev/` from the host into the container, but still create a terminal.
- The `--security-opt` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new option, `proc-opts`, to specify options for the container's `/proc` filesystem.
- Podman with the `crun` OCI runtime now supports a new option to `podman run` and `podman create`, `--cgroup-conf`, which allows for advanced configuration of cgroups on cgroups v2 systems.
- The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now support a `--override-variant` option, to override the architecture variant of the image that will be pulled and ran.
- A new global option has been added to Podman, `--runtime-flags`, which allows for setting flags to use when the OCI runtime is called.
- The `podman manifest add` command now supports the `--cert-dir`, `--auth-file`, `--creds`, and `--tls-verify` options.

### Security
- This release resolves CVE-2020-14370, in which environment variables could be leaked between containers created using the Varlink API.

### Changes
- Podman will now retry pulling an image 3 times if a pull fails due to network errors.
- The `podman exec` command would previously print error messages (e.g. `exec session exited with non-zero exit code -1`) when the command run exited with a non-0 exit code. It no longer does this. The `podman exec` command will still exit with the same exit code as the command run in the container did.
- Error messages when creating a container or pod with a name that is already in use have been improved.
- For read-only containers running systemd init, Podman creates a tmpfs filesystem at `/run`. This was previously limited to 65k in size and mounted `noexec`, but is now unlimited size and mounted `exec`.
- The `podman system reset` command no longer removes configuration files for rootless Podman.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not add an entry to `/etc/hosts` for a container if it joined another container's network namespace ([#66782](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6678)).

### Misc
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.14.10

v2.0.6-rc1

This is the first release candidate for Podman v2.0.6. It includes several small bugfixes for issues identified with v2.0.5.
v2.0.5

### Features

### Changes
- Podman's automatic systemd integration (activated by the `--systemd=true` flag, set by default) will now activate for containers using `/usr/local/sbin/init` as their command, instead of just `/usr/sbin/init` and `/sbin/init` (and any path ending in `systemd`).
- Seccomp profiles specified by the `--security-opt seccomp=...` flag to `podman create` and `podman run` will now be honored even if the container was created using `--privileged`.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where the `podman load` command with remote Podman would did not honor user-specified tags ([#7124](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7124)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command, when run as a non-root user by Systemd, did not properly handle the Podman pause process and would not restart properly as a result ([#7180](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7180)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--publish` flag to `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman pod create` did not properly handle a host IP of 0.0.0.0 (attempting to bind to literal 0.0.0.0, instead of all IPs on the system) ([#7104](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7014)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman start --attach` command would not print the container's exit code when the command exited due to the container exiting.

- Fixed a bug where pod infra containers were not properly unmounted after exiting.
- Fixed a bug where networks created with `podman network create` with an IPv6 subnet did not properly set an IPv6 default route.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman save` command would not work properly when its output was piped to another command ([#7017](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7017)).
- Fixed a bug where containers using a systemd init on a cgroups v1 system could leak mounts under `/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd` to the host.

- Fixed a bug where the `podman version` command did not properly include build time and Git commit.
- Fixed a bug where running systemd in a Podman container on a system that did not use the `systemd` cgroup manager would fail ([#6734](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6734)).
- Fixed a bug where capabilities from `--cap-add` were not properly added when a container was started as a non-root user via `--user`.
- Fixed a bug where Pod infra containers were not properly cleaned up when they stopped, causing networking issues ([#7103](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7103)).

### API

- Fixed a bug where containers started through a systemd-managed instance of the REST API would be shut down when `podman system service` shut down due to its idle timeout ([#7294](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7294)).
- Added stronger parameter verification for the libpod Network Create endpoint to ensure subnet mask is a valid value.

Mon Jul  8 13:18:20 UTC 2019 - Sascha Grunert <sgrunert@suse.com>

- Update to libpod v1.4.4
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to use the
    entire root configuration if no rootless configuration was
    present for the user, breaking rootless Podman for new
    installations
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman's pause process would block
    SIGTERM, preventing graceful system shutdown and hanging until
    the system's init send SIGKILL
  - Fixed a bug where running Podman as root with sudo -E would not
    work after running rootless Podman at least once
  - Fixed a bug where options for tmpfs volumes added with the
    --tmpfs flag were being ignored
  - Fixed a bug where images with no layers could not properly be
    displayed and removed by Podman
  - Fixed a bug where locks were not properly freed on failure to
    create a container or pod
  - Podman now has greatly improved support for containers using
    multiple OCI runtimes. Containers now remember if they were
    created with a different runtime using --runtime and will
    always use that runtime
  - The cached and delegated options for volume mounts are now
    allowed for Docker compatability (#3340)
  - The podman diff command now supports the --latest flag
  - Fixed a bug where podman cp on a single file would create a
    directory at the target and place the file in it (#3384)
  - Fixed a bug where podman inspect --format '{{.Mounts}}' would
    print a hexadecimal address instead of a container's mounts
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add an entry to
    container's /etc/hosts files for their own hostname (#3405)
  - Fixed a bug where podman ps --sync would segfault (#3411)
  - Fixed a bug where podman generate kube would produce an invalid
    ports configuration (#3408)
  - Podman now performs much better on systems with heavy I/O load
  - The --cgroup-manager flag to podman now shows the correct
    default setting in help if the default was overridden by
    libpod.conf
  - For backwards compatability, setting --log-driver=json-file in
    podman run is now supported as an alias for
    --log-driver=k8s-file. This is considered deprecated, and
    json-file will be moved to a new implementation in the future
    ([#3363](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/3363))
  - Podman's default libpod.conf file now allows the crun OCI
    runtime to be used if it is installed

    older version of Systemd as init (#3295)
  - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.9.0 to resolve a critical bug
    with Dockerfile RUN instructions
  - The error message for running podman kill on containers that
    are not running has been improved
  - The Podman remote client can now log to a file if syslog is not
    available
  - The MacOS dmg file is experimental, use at your own risk.
  - The podman exec command now sets its error code differently
    based on whether the container does not exist, and the command
    in the container does not exist
  - The podman inspect command on containers now outputs Mounts
    JSON that matches that of docker inspect, only including
    user-specified volumes and differentiating bind mounts and
    named volumes
  - The podman inspect command now reports the path to a
    container's OCI spec with the OCIConfigPath key (only included
    when the container is initialized or running)
  - The podman run --mount command now supports the
    bind-nonrecursive option for bind mounts (#3314)
  - Fixed a bug where podman play kube would fail to create
    containers due to an unspecified log driver
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to build with musl libc
    (#3284)
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman using slirp4netns networking
    in an environment with no nameservers on the host other than
    localhost would result in nonfunctional networking (#3277)
  - Fixed a bug where podman import would not properly set
    environment variables, discarding their values and retaining
    only keys
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to run when built with
    Apparmor support but run on systems without the Apparmor kernel
    module loaded (#3331)
  - Remote Podman will now default the username it uses to log in
    to remote systems to the username of the current user
  - Podman now uses JSON logging with OCI runtimes that support it,
    allowing for better error reporting
  - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.8.4
  - Updated vendored containers/image to v2.0
- Update to image v2.0.0

Mon Aug 27 14:24:51 UTC 2018 - vrothberg@suse.com

- storage.conf: comment out options that are not supported by btrfs.
  This simplifies switching the driver as it avoids the whack-a-mole
  of commenting out "unsupported" options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 27 08:48:16 UTC 2018 - vrothberg@suse.com

- Consolidate libcontainers-{common,image,storage} into one package,
  libcontainers-common. That's the way upstream intended all libraries from
  github.com/containers to be packaged. It facilitates updating and maintaining
  the package, as all configs and manpages come from a central source.

  Note that the `storage` binary that previously has been provided by the
  libcontainers-storage package is not provided anymore as, despite the claims
  in the manpages, it is not intended for production use.

- Configuration files should generally be tagged as %config(noreplace) in order
  to keep the modified config files and to avoid losing data when the package
  is being updated.
