# Enabling MTS in libcdata means data structures are protected by
# libcdata itself, with an implicit rwlock. Every downstream use
# (e.g. by libpff) suffers, even if libpff already made sure that any
# one libcdata object is not used concurrently. Therefore, we disable
# MTS. - https://github.com/libyal/libcdata/issues/6
