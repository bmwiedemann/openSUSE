- version 10.2+2.0.0 (2019-01-26)
  * Now works with audio CD's that start on a track greater than 1.
  * typos in manual page and README
  * Do not attempt to call a NULL callback from mskamp
- version 10.2+0.94+2 (2017-08-22)
  * Add --force-overread
    Force overreading into the lead-out portion of the disc. This option
    is only applicable when using the "-O" option with a positive sample
    offset value. Many drives are not capable of reading into this
    portion of the disc and attempting to do so on those drives will
    produce read errors and possibly hard lockups
- version 10.2+0.94+1 (2017-03-25)
  * Fix problem where end of span seems to default to last track.
  * Fix NULL pointer dereference that occurs when byte swapping is needed.
  * Re-silence recently added gcc -Wunused-result warnings
  * Use @LIBS@ figured out by autoconf when linking (for -lrt on Linux).
  * Incorrect track was getting used in matching.
- Added sig file along with keyring for source verification
- Make use of %license macro
- Adopted for change of README to README.md
