- The doc fails to build with an assert in sphinx in 15sp6 also.

Tue Apr  2 14:35:56 UTC 2024 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 0.11.0
  * Updated documentation to refer to RFC 8949
  * Improvements to cbor_describe
        Bytestring data will now be printed as well by akallabeth
        Formatting consistency and clarity improvements
  * Fix cbor_string_set_handle not setting the codepoint count
  * BREAKING: cbor_load will no longer fail on input strings that are
        well-formed but not valid UTF-8
        If you were relying on the validation, please check the result
        using cbor_string_codepoint_count instead
  * BREAKING: All decoders like cbor_load and cbor_stream_decode will
        accept all well-formed tag values (bug discovered by dskern-github)
        Previously, decoding of certain values would fail with
        CBOR_ERR_MALFORMATED or CBOR_DECODER_ERROR
        This also makes decoding symmetrical with serialization, which
        already accepts all values

  python-pyOpenSSL <-> python-cryptography

      input buffer is empty
  * Fix cbor_stream_decode to set cbor_decoder_result.required to
    the minimum number of input bytes necessary to receive the next
    callback (as long as at least one byte was passed)
