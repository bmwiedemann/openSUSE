  <title>Library of utility functions for CMPI providers</title>
  <description>Libcmpiutil is a library of utility functions for CMPI providers.  The
goal is to reduce the amount of repetitive work done in most CMPI
providers by encapsulating common procedures with more &quot;normal&quot; APIs. 
This extends from operations like getting typed instance properties to
standardizing method dispatch and argument checking.</description>
