- Update to version 0.4.0:
	* A backwards-incompatible change, since the sizeof
    cpu_raw_data_t and cpu_id_t are now different.
	* Better detection of AMD clock multiplier with msrinfo.
	* Support for Intel SGX detection
- Some packaging cleanups
  * Use url as source
  * Split binary from devel package

- Update from 0.1.0 to 0.3.0:
  * Added intel_fn11 fields to cpu_raw_data_t to handle
    new processor topology enumeration required on Core i7
  * Support for Intel Nehalem architecture CPUs (Core i7, Xeon i7)
  * Added support for greater more accurate CPU clock measurements
    with cpu_clock_by_ic()
  * Support for AMD Bulldozer CPUs, 128-bit SSE unit size checking.
    A backwards-incompatible change, since the sizeof cpu_id_t is
    now different.
  * Support for Ivy Bridge, and detecting the presence of the
    RdRand instruction.
  * Support for newer processors up to Haswell and Vishera
  * Fix clock detection in cpu_clock_by_ic() for Bulldozer
  * Support for detection of AVX/AVX2/BMI1/BMI2
  * More entries supported in cpu_msrinfo()
  * Rename of some CPU codenames, made more consistent
  * *BSD and Solaris support (unofficial)
  * A backwards-incompatible change, since the sizeof
    cpu_raw_data_t and cpu_id_t are now different.
  * Support for processors up to Skylake.
  * Fix clock detection in cpu_clock_by_ic() for Skylake.
  * Support up to 8 subleaf entries for CPUID leaf 04 and detection
    of L4 cache.
  * MSR functions supported on FreeBSD.
  * INFO_VOLTAGE request supported by cpu_msrinfo().
