- Update to release 0.5.0
  * The abi-compliance-checker reports there are both ABI and API
    changes in this release.
  * Substantially less than the previous release, and ultimately
    quite minor but unfortunately there nonetheless and so the
    SONAME is updated to 0.5 accordingly. I do not anticipate
    anything there that cannot be solved for applications without
    just a recompile.
  * This release brings in 201 commits with a huge list of fixes
    and code clean up which I'm very happy to see, including
    interesting fixes to the AGC and AWB handling in libipa.
  * In regards to new features, libcamera-0.5 has aptly now got
    the core Raspberry Pi 5 support merged!. There are still
    patches that are currently maintained by Raspberry Pi for
    additional features, and while the transition to upstream API's
    continue, but I think we're all happy to see this support
    getting in directly, and Raspberry Pi continue to lead the way
    in upstream camera development. I look forward to the kernel
    API's for streams being fully utilised by the PiSP platform for
    upstream camera metadata handling. This upcoming work is also
    supported by the CameraSensor factory and CameraSensorRaw
    support that is now also merged in this release.
  * Further more in the platform support, the software_isp
    continues to be developed and is now able to measure colour
    temperature, which will bring in improvements for AWB, and a
    CCM can be applied while peforming debayering (at a CPU cost)
    which will allow us to finally apply color tuning for sensors
    on devices that need to fall back to the software ISP.
  * New sensor support seems fairly short in this release, with the
    IMX415 being the prominent addition.
  * In libipa, and algorithm developments, along with many fixes
    and improvements there is a substantial new feature that the
    Baysian AWB algorithm from Raspberry Pi can now also be used on
    all libipa supported IPA modules, and has shown good impovements
    for the RkISP1 supported devices.
  * There is minimal changes to the application support side, but
    it is notable that now the Y444 format has been mapped to be
    usable by the gstreamer src element. lc-compliance has seen
    some progress which I hope will bring this to being a more
    central part of the test infrastructure.

- Update to release 0.4.0
  * The abi-compliance-checker reports that there is both ABI and
    API breakage in this release.
  * The majority of the ABI breakages are around the public API for
    Control handling and definitions, which have caused underlying
    identifiers to be changed, and the reuqired storage for
    controls has increased.
  * This release brings in 253 commits, with substantial
    development on image control and tuning features for IPA and
    Pipeline handlers supporting libipa, as well as integrating
    libipa support for IPA handling on the ARM Mali-C55 ISP.
  * A new 'Virtual Pipeline Handler' has been introduced to support
    more testing in CI and virtual environments.
  * Gstreamer has had some interesting development to rework
    expressing the full control set from libcamera using auto
    generation from the full control descriptors.
  * A key and notable change in this release too is that the
    softISP is now moving towards utilising the libipa
    implementaitons which will enable future tuning and image
    control capabilities, and should also support future
    development on a GPU-ISP implementation for GPU-accelerated
    handling. I do believe this work may have introduced an
    oscillation regression in the AEGC which will need to be
    investigated and fixed in the near future, but I don't want to
    hold up progressing the ABI updates at this stage.
  * The i.MX8MP can now make full use of the DW100 Dewarp Engine
    for full rotation and digital zoom capabilities.
  * Raspberry Pi systems now have improved support for the OV7251,
    IMX462, and IMX327 Sensors, and libipa platforms can now make
    use of the GalaxyCore gc05a2 and gc08a3 Image sensors.

  * The i.MX8MP ISP is now officially supported through the
    existing RKISP1 pipeline handler, and the Simple Pipeline
    handler now supports the MediaTek MT8365 platform.
  * Three additional camera sensors, IMX283, IMX335, and IMX415
    are also now supported.

    handler and the Onsemi AR0144 is now supported by libipa. A
