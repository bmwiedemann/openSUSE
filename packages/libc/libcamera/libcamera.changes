Tue Dec 16 14:24:09 UTC 2025 - Antonio Teixeira <antonio.teixeira@suse.com>

- Update to release 0.6.0
  * Improved the public facing API.
  * New global configuration file system which will replace or
    extend the current use of environment variables to configure
    runtime behaviours.
  * The core V4L2 classes can now support the V4L2 Request API which
    in turn has brought in huge developments for the i.MX8MP Dewarper
    support allowing full resize, scale, rotate and crop capabilities
    on top of also performing lens dewarping.
  * SoftISP: IPU7 has been added as a supported configuration to
    the pipeline.
  * New tuning files have been added for Raspberry Pi platforms,
    improving support for the Sony IMX335, IMX415, IMX462, and ST
    VD55G1 image sensors, and Decompand support has been added for
    the Raspberry Pi 5.
  * Various improvements have been made for thread handling,
    improving synchronisation and event dispatch, as well as fixing
    the serialisation operations for isolated IPA modules.
  * In the applications components, there are fixes to cam adding
    more output formats and qcam now behaves more consistently when
    no camera is selected. The Python bindings have received fixes
    for paths from meson, and the FrameBuffer::planes wrapper.
  * doc: theme refresh and clearer separation between the internal
    and public API, and fixes to the contributing guidelines.
  * For a full list of changes, please see:
    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/camera/libcamera/-/releases/v0.6.0
- Update meson build requirement to 1.0.1 according to the upstream
  changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  9 12:42:46 UTC 2025 - pgajdos@suse.com

- Update to release 0.5.2
  * This release substantial development on gstreamer.
  * In core we can see development that cleans up ProcessManager
    in a drive to reduce singleton patterns throughout libcamera.
  * Pipelines are now able to limit the number of requests queued
    into the pipeline handler which helps prevent issues when
    applications desire to use a larger request queue.
  * It's now possible to check if controls exist with new macros
    defined for every control to help codebases compile against
    multiple versions.

Tue Apr  8 06:57:18 UTC 2025 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to release 0.5.0
  * The abi-compliance-checker reports there are both ABI and API
    changes in this release.
  * Substantially less than the previous release, and ultimately
    quite minor but unfortunately there nonetheless and so the
    SONAME is updated to 0.5 accordingly. I do not anticipate
    anything there that cannot be solved for applications without
    just a recompile.
  * This release brings in 201 commits with a huge list of fixes
    and code clean up which I'm very happy to see, including
    interesting fixes to the AGC and AWB handling in libipa.
  * In regards to new features, libcamera-0.5 has aptly now got
    the core Raspberry Pi 5 support merged!. There are still
    patches that are currently maintained by Raspberry Pi for
    additional features, and while the transition to upstream API's
    continue, but I think we're all happy to see this support
    getting in directly, and Raspberry Pi continue to lead the way
    in upstream camera development. I look forward to the kernel
    API's for streams being fully utilised by the PiSP platform for
    upstream camera metadata handling. This upcoming work is also
    supported by the CameraSensor factory and CameraSensorRaw
    support that is now also merged in this release.
  * Further more in the platform support, the software_isp
    continues to be developed and is now able to measure colour
    temperature, which will bring in improvements for AWB, and a
    CCM can be applied while peforming debayering (at a CPU cost)
    which will allow us to finally apply color tuning for sensors
    on devices that need to fall back to the software ISP.
  * New sensor support seems fairly short in this release, with the
    IMX415 being the prominent addition.
  * In libipa, and algorithm developments, along with many fixes
    and improvements there is a substantial new feature that the
    Baysian AWB algorithm from Raspberry Pi can now also be used on
    all libipa supported IPA modules, and has shown good impovements
    for the RkISP1 supported devices.
  * There is minimal changes to the application support side, but
    it is notable that now the Y444 format has been mapped to be
    usable by the gstreamer src element. lc-compliance has seen
    some progress which I hope will bring this to being a more
    central part of the test infrastructure.
  * For a full list of changes, please see:

Mon Dec 23 21:51:19 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to release 0.4.0
  * The abi-compliance-checker reports that there is both ABI and
    API breakage in this release.
  * The majority of the ABI breakages are around the public API for
    Control handling and definitions, which have caused underlying
    identifiers to be changed, and the reuqired storage for
    controls has increased.
  * This release brings in 253 commits, with substantial
    development on image control and tuning features for IPA and
    Pipeline handlers supporting libipa, as well as integrating
    libipa support for IPA handling on the ARM Mali-C55 ISP.
  * A new 'Virtual Pipeline Handler' has been introduced to support
    more testing in CI and virtual environments.
  * Gstreamer has had some interesting development to rework
    expressing the full control set from libcamera using auto
    generation from the full control descriptors.
  * A key and notable change in this release too is that the
    softISP is now moving towards utilising the libipa
    implementaitons which will enable future tuning and image
    control capabilities, and should also support future
    development on a GPU-ISP implementation for GPU-accelerated
    handling. I do believe this work may have introduced an
    oscillation regression in the AEGC which will need to be
    investigated and fixed in the near future, but I don't want to
    hold up progressing the ABI updates at this stage.
  * The i.MX8MP can now make full use of the DW100 Dewarp Engine
    for full rotation and digital zoom capabilities.
  * Raspberry Pi systems now have improved support for the OV7251,
    IMX462, and IMX327 Sensors, and libipa platforms can now make
    use of the GalaxyCore gc05a2 and gc08a3 Image sensors.
  * For a full list of changes, please see:

  * The i.MX8MP ISP is now officially supported through the
    existing RKISP1 pipeline handler, and the Simple Pipeline
    handler now supports the MediaTek MT8365 platform.
  * Three additional camera sensors, IMX283, IMX335, and IMX415
    are also now supported.

    handler and the Onsemi AR0144 is now supported by libipa. A
