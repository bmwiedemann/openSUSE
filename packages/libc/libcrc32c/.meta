  <title>CRC32C implementation with support for CPU-specific acceleration instructions</title>
  <description>This project collects a few CRC32C implementations under an umbrella 
that dispatches to a suitable implementation based on the host computer's 
hardware capabilities.

CRC32C is specified as the CRC that uses the iSCSI polynomial in RFC 3720. 
The polynomial was introduced by G. Castagnoli, S. Braeuer and M. Herrmann.</description>
