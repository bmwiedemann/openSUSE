Subject: pam_cgroup: Revert broken cache usage

This reverts the following upstream commit:

	commit ac6173f74922b7dbc46e87370b9bc42cd0fa892d
	Author: Peter Schiffer <pschiffe@redhat.com>
	Date: Tue Jun 25 06:37:41 2013 +0200
	Subject: Use cache when reading /etc/passwd file

The cache that is to be used is not initialized and therefore remains empty,
hence pam_cgroup doesn't really do anything.

Thanks, Reco, for the report!
