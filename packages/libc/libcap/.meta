  <title>Library for Capabilities (linux-privs) Support</title>
  <description>Capabilities are a measure to limit the omnipotence of the superuser.
Currently a program started by root or setuid root has the power to do
anything. Capabilities (Linux-Privs) provide a more fine-grained access
control. Without kernel patches, you can use this library to drop
capabilities within setuid binaries. If you use patches, this can be
done automatically by the kernel.</description>
