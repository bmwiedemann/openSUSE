  <title>Library for creating and verifying Usenet cancel locks</title>
  <description>Cancel locks are used by Usenet article posters to authenticate their
authorship of an article. It may then by used by servers to prevent
cancel and supersede abuse. The use of this feature remains the
newsmaster's decision.

This library may be used for both the generation and the verification
of cancel locks.
