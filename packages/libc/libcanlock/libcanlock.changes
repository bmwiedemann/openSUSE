- Update to version 3.3.1
  * Bugfix: Add path "$PREFIX/include" to pkg-config files. The
     former "$PREFIX/include/libcanlock-3" is still present for
     compatibility to existing code. The "libcanlock-3" directory
     should be part of preprocessor directives (as documented)
  * Bugfix: Replace license name "MIT-like" with "ICU". Note that
     the license terms are unchanged (only the name was fixed).
  * Add machine readable SPDX license identifiers.

- Update to version 3.3.0
  * Bugfixes:
    + canlock-mhp utility no longer hangs if field name was not
      found.
    + Potential NULL-pointer dereference fixed in canlock utility.
    + Two memory leaks fixed in canlock-hfp utility.j
    + Multiple bugs in test suite fixed, where return values from
    + library functions were not handled correctly.
    + Two memory leaks fixed in test suite for legacy API
    + NAME sections of cl_clear_secret(), cl_get_lock(), cl_split()
      and cl_verify() man pages fixed.
  * Separate library libcanlock-hp added to execute the header
    parsers (for operating systems with POSIX API).
  * New libcanlock-hp API function to unfold header fields added
  * Test suite extended for the new library. Tests for parser.
    functions are skipped by default (because they require the
    installed parser utilities).
  * New libcanlock API function cl_verify_multi() added to check
    multiple keys against multiple locks.
  * Library API and ABI are backward compatible
  * Test suite extended: It now tests cl_verify_multi() too
  * canlock utility now supports the option "-m" to check multiple
    keys against multiple locks.
  * Option "-m" added to SYNOPSIS section of canlock man page.
  * Example programs added to the "examples" and "hp/examples"
    subdirectories.

- Update to version 3.2.2
  * Bugfix: Header field name is not found by canlock-mhp if there
    is another header field for which only the prefix differs (and
    that other field is processed first)
  * Test suite for canlock-mhp parser extended: It now tests headers
    larger than 4 KiByte and for the field prefix bug fixed in this
    version
  * Test suite for canlock-hfp parser extended to test comments harder
  * Namespace clash of internal library functions with libc on NetBSD
    + Changed internal API function names hmac* to RFC2104Hmac*
    + Changed internal API function names hkdf* to RFC5869Hkdf*
    + Library API and ABI are fully compatible if no undocumented
      functions are used
  * libcanlock-3.pc: Changed protocol in URL from http to https
