  <title>OpenPrinting libcupsfilters provides CUPS filters as library functions</title>
  <description>This package libcupsfilters provides the libcupsfilters library,
which in its 2.x version contains all the code
of the filters of the former cups-filters package
as library functions, the so-called filter functions.
The package libcupsfilters2 provides the actual
libcupsfilters 2.x version library.
Both libcupsfilters and libcupsfilters2 are required by cups-filters2.
The sub-package libcupsfilters-devel provides
development files for libcupsfilters.
