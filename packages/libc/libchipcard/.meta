  <title>Library That Allows Easy Access to Smart Cards (Chipcards)</title>
  <description>Libchipcard allows easy access to smart cards. It provides basic access
to memory and processor cards and has special support for German
medical cards, German &quot;Geldkarten,&quot; and HBCI (home banking) cards (both
type 0 and type 1). It accesses the readers via CTAPI or PC/SC
interfaces and has successfully been tested with Towitoko, Kobil, and
Reiner-SCT readers.</description>
