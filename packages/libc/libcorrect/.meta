  <title>C library for Convolutional codes and Reed-Solomon</title>
  <description>libcorrect is a library for Forward Error Correction. By using libcorrect, you can encode extra redundancy into a packet of data and then send it across a lossy channel. When the packet is received, it can be decoded to recover the original, pre-encoded data.

libcorrect accomplishes this task with two algorithms, Convolutional codes and Reed-Solomon. Convolutional codes are robust to a constant background noise, while Reed-Solomon error correction is effective at dealing with noise that occurs in bursts. These algorithms have played an important role in telecommunications. libcorrect uses a Viterbi algorithm decoder to decode convolutional codes.
