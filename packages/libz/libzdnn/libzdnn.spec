%description
IBM Z Deep Neural Network Library (zDNN) provides an interface for
applications making use of Neural Network Processing Assist
Facility (NNPA).

This IBM-provided C library provides a set of functions that handle
the data transformation requirements of the AIU and provide wrapper
functions for the NNPA instruction primitives.
