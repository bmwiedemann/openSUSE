Mon Jun 10 11:18:11 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 6
  * Dropped support for draft standards 4.x.
  * Compliance to the final ZBC/ZAC standards is improved and now
    includes support for such ZAC-2/ZBC-2 features as support for
    DH-SMR (XMR) devices and support for zone counts > 1 in zone
    operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 16 06:04:20 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.14
  * Fix zbc_report_zones() to have the backend drivers handle
    command buffer allocation. This simplification avoids rare
    issues with report zones command failing due to an invalid
    command size.
  * Do not set the IMMED bit in the SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command
    issued by zbc_flush() function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  2 10:55:20 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.13
  * Improve the detection of ATA devices with the scsi backend
    driver
  * Add the -scsi and -ata option to all command line tools to
    respectively force the use of the SCSI or ATA backend
    drivers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 17 06:58:54 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.12.0
  * No changes; maintainers are still experimenting with libtool
    options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 28 11:27:35 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.11.1
  * New versioning scheme and SONAME

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 28 07:22:17 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.11
  * Increase of the default command timeout from 20s to 30s to be
    in-line with the kernel default settings. Similarly to the
    kernel, the timeout for device write cache flush commands is
    also double the default value (60s).
  * Improved handling of timeout errors. These errors are now
    notified using the ETIMEDOUT error code instead of the generic
    EIO.
  * SCSI backend driver fixes and improvements: optimized SAT
    correctness detection for ZAC devices and faster device
    capacity detection.
  * Block backend driver improvements: retreive the maximum
    number of open zones from the device sysfs attributes if the
    kernel exposes it.
  * Improvement of the zbc_report_zones() function that avoids
    multiple buffer allocation/free operations for large reports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 22 10:50:43 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.10
  * Fix the block backend driver to always issue a reset zone ioctl
  * Fix the fake backend driver zbc_fake_set_write_pointer() function
  * Fix the tools command line parsing and error messages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 30 15:53:24 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  9 12:49:33 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.8.5
  * Fix potential IO error for large IO requests with a buffer
    not page aligned.
  * Modifications to the block backens driver to support the new
    ioctl() commands introduced in kernel 5.5 (zone open, close
    and finish ioctls).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 25 08:32:56 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.8.4
  * zbc_device_is_zoned() does not use a device real path as
    given by zbc_realpath(), causing problems with symbolic
    links.
  * Better handling of sense data reporting feature on ATA
    drives: some drives do not accept setting this feature
    causing zbc_open(). to fail. Fix this by testing first if the
    feature is already enabled instead of blindly setting it.
  * Fix zbc_write_zone tool not writing any data to a zone due to
    a loop control error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 12 17:10:38 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.8.3
  * This release fixes a bug in gzviewer and compilation
    warnings. It also adds the --disable-gui configuration option
    to allow manually disabling the compilation of GUI tools
    (gzbc and gzviewer).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 08:10:22 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new release 5.8.2
  * Fix SG IO header dxfer_len field to avoid failures of
    vectored IOs with more than a single vector.
  * Change error code returned by zbc_preadv() and zbc_pwritev()
    from -EINVAL to -EIO in the case of an an unaligned IO
    request. This change matches the kernel returned error value.
  * New gzviewer tool to graphically display a device zone state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 28 07:10:57 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 5.8.0
  * This new release adds the new functions zbc_preadv() and
    zbc_pwritev() to support vectored read and write. The
    zbc_read_zone and zbc_write_zone tools are also updated to
    allow using these new functions with the new -vio option.
    Various bug fixes are also included.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 20 07:41:24 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 5.7.1
  * Improved handling of non-SCSI zoned block devices.
  * Change the behavior of zbc_open() to return an error when
    trying to open a regular block device that was not
    initialized for the emulation mode using the zbc_set_zones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 18 21:47:12 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 5.5.0
  * Fixed various problems with the fake backend driver
    (emulation mode), in particular when using a 4K sector disk
    as backend storage.
  * Properly set up direct I/O operation with the SG_IO interface
    (SCSI and ATA backend drivers).
  * Properly handle the maximum and optimal number of open zones
    for drives with no limit and drives not reporting any limit.
  * Skip open zone resource tests for drives with no limit or an
    unreported limit on the maximum/optimal number of open zones.
  * Add a new test to verify that a drive returns the correct
    ASC/ASCQ sense error codes when writing to a full zone (HM
    drives only).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  8 11:18:07 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 5.3.1
  * A rewrite of libzbc introducing significant changes to the
    API. Support for draft standards 4.x is dropped. Compliance
    to the final ZBC/ZAC standards is improved.
  * All functions now operate using 512B sector units, regardless
    of the device actual logical block size. This is in line with
    Linux block device management and can simplify application
    implementation by unifying the addressing unit used when
    devices with different logical block sizes (512B or 4096B)
    are being used. Applications must however still comply with
    write request alignment to the device physical block size,
    which may be different from the 512B sector size unit used.
  * Improved read and write functions (zbc_pread and zbc_pwrite)
    to not limit the request size to the device maximum request
    data transfer size (calls are internally split into multiple
    requests).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 29 10:31:02 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.3.3
  * block backend driver: support latest "official" kernel
    interface queued up for kernel 4.10 release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 12:59:55 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.3.0
* Properly handle detection of zoned block devices using sysfs
* Fixed handling of list view so that an operation on a zone does
  not reset the current selection and view whenever possible.
* Improved handling of the list view using a filter model.
* Added support for direct I/Os (O_DIRECT). Note: this does not
  work with SG node device files.
* Added maximum read/write command size in the device info
  structure.
* Initialize maximum device read/write I/O size for each backend
  driver.
* Check read/write command size against the maximum allowed for
  the device.
* Fixed get capacity: the code is now common for ATA and SCSI.
  This fixes problems in SCSI backend when RC_BASIS is 0 (report
  zones was being executed without the max logical sectors being
  set), and also adds RC_BASIS handling for ATA drives (this was
  missing entirely).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  1 08:22:20 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.1.1
* This release implements support for ZBC and ZAC revision 4 and
  above draft standards.
* Fixed the fake backend driver to pass all tests even if the
  device specified is very small (i.e. it has only a few sequential
  zones).
* Display SG_IO ioctl error message only when the log level is set
  to debug/verbose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to new git snapshot 2.0.0.g32
* Support for ZBC and ZAC r04
* Added block device backend driver for use with kernels providing
  SMR support and exposing host-managed disks as block devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 19:13:31 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new git snapshot 2.0.0~git113

* Added flags in zbc_device_info structure and stored URSWRZ flag in it.
* Added forced ata read/write flag to read/write using pass through command.
* Supported ZBC sense key, ASC/ASCQ handling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
