%description
The IBM Z Protected-key Crypto library libzpc is a library targeting
the 64-bit Linux on IBM Z (s390x) platform. It provides interfaces for
cryptographic primitives. The underlying implementations make use of
z/Architecture's performance-boosting hardware support and its
protected-key feature which ensures that key material is never present
in main memory at any time.
