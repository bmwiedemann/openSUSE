%description
libzip is a C library for reading, creating, and modifying zip
archives. Files can be added from data buffers, files, or compressed. This
package contains a set of small utilities built using libzip
 * zipmerge - merge source zip archives into the target one
 * zipcmp - compares the zip archives and check if they contains same files

pages.
