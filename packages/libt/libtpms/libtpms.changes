Sun Apr 10 12:43:58 UTC 2022 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.3:
  * build-sys: Add probing for -fstack-protector
  * tpm2: Do not call EVP_PKEY_CTX_set0_rsa_oaep_label() for label of size
  * (OSSL 3)
  * tpm2: When writing state initialize s_ContextSlotMask if not set 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 19:57:51 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 0.9.1
  * Downgrade to previous versions is not possible, as the size of
    the context gap has been adjusted to 0xffff from 0xff.
  * Enabled Camellia symmetric key encryption algorithm
  * tpm2: Update to TPM 2 spec rev 164
  * tpm2: Added a cache for private exponent D and prime Q
  * tpm2: bug fixes
- Drop upstream fixed libtpms-CVE-2021-3746.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 16:36:31 UTC 2021 - pgajdos@suse.com

- security update
- added patches
  fix CVE-2021-3746 [bsc#1189935], out-of-bounds access via specially crafted TPM 2 command packets
  + libtpms-CVE-2021-3746.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  7 15:00:32 UTC 2021 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.8.4:
  * Reset too large size indicators in TPM2B to avoid access
    beyond buffer
  * Restore original value in buffer if unmarshalled one was
    illegal

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 19 07:18:37 UTC 2021 - Gary Ching-Pang Lin <glin@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.8.2
  * NOTE: Downgrade to 0.7.x or below is not possible.
    Due to fixes in the TPM 2 prime number generation code in
    rev155 it is not possible to downgrade from libtpms version
    0.8.0 to some previous version. The seeds are now associated
    with an age so that older seeds use the old TPM 2 prime number
    generation code while newer seed use the newer code.
  * tpm2: rev155: Add new RsaAdjustPrimeCandidate code but do
    not use (bsc#1184939 CVE-2021-3505)
  * tpm2: Activate SEED_COMPAT_LEVEL_RSA_PRIME_ADJUST_FIX
    (bsc#1184939 CVE-2021-3505)
  * Update to TPM 2 code release 159
    - X509 support is enabled
       + SM2 signing of ceritificates is NOT supported
    - Authenticated timers are disabled
  * Update to TPM 2 code relase 162
    - ECC encryption / decryption is disabled
  * Fix support for elliptic curve due to missing unmarshalling
    code
  * Runtime filter supported elliptic curves supported by OpenSSL
  * Fix output buffer parameter and size for RSA decryption that
    could cause stack corruption under certain circumstances
  * Set the RSA PSS salt length to the digest length rather than
    max
  * Fixes to symmetric decryption related to input size check,
    defer padding to the user [EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding(ctx, 0)]
    and to always use a temporary malloc'ed buffer for decryption
  * Fixed the set of PCRs belonging to the TCB group. This affects
    the pcrUpdateCounter in TPM2_Pcrread() responses, thus needs
    latest swtpm for test cases to succeed there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 19 02:03:20 UTC 2021 - Gary Ching-Pang Lin <glin@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.7.7
  * CryptSym: fix AES output IV (bsc#1183729, CVE-2021-3446)
  * tpm2: Fix public key context save due to ANY_OBJECT_Marshal usage
  * tpm2: Address some Coverity issues (false positives)
  * tpm1.2: Backported ASAN/UBSAN related fixes
  * tpm2: Return properly sized array for b parameter for NIST P521
    (HLK)
  * tpm2: Addressed issues detected by UBSAN
  * tpm2: Addressed issues detected by cppcheck (false positives)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 23 03:31:28 UTC 2020 - Gary Ching-Pang Lin <glin@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.7.4
  * Addressed potential constant-time related issues in TPM 1.2 and
    TPM 2 code
    TPM 1.2: RSA decryption
    TPM 2: EcSchnorr and EcSM2 signatures; Ecsda is handled by OpenSSL
  * Fixed some compilation issues

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 23 05:01:12 UTC 2020 - Kai Liu <kai.liu@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.7.3
  * Fixed the set of PCRs belonging to the TCB group. This affects
    the pcrUpdateCounter in TPM2_Pcrread() responses, thus needs
    latest `swtpm` (master, stable branches) for test cases to
    succeed there.

- Changes since version 0.7.2
  * Fix output buffer parameter and size for RSA decryption that
    could cause stack corruption under certain circumstances
  * Set the RSA PSS salt length to the digest length rathern than
    max. possible
  * Fixes to symmetric decrytion related to input size check, defer
    padding to the user [EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding(ctx, 0)] and to
    always use a temporary malloc'ed buffer for decryption

- Changes since version 0.7.1
  * tpm2: Fix TDES key creation by adding missing un-/marshalling
    functions
  * tpm2: Fix a bug in CheckAuthSession
  * compilation fixes for TPM 1.2 & TPM 2 and various architectures
    and gcc versions
  * Fix support for NIST curves P{192,224,521} and SM2 P256 and
    BNP648 that would not work;
  * Runtime filter elliptic curves (that OpenSSL does not support)
    and do not advertise those curves as capabilities
  * Removed unnecessary space in MANUFACTURER "IBM " -> "IBM"
