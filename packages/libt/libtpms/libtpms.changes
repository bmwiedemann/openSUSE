- Update to version 0.7.3
  * Fixed the set of PCRs belonging to the TCB group. This affects
    the pcrUpdateCounter in TPM2_Pcrread() responses, thus needs
    latest `swtpm` (master, stable branches) for test cases to
    succeed there.

- Changes since version 0.7.2
  * Fix output buffer parameter and size for RSA decryption that
    could cause stack corruption under certain circumstances
  * Set the RSA PSS salt length to the digest length rathern than
    max. possible
  * Fixes to symmetric decrytion related to input size check, defer
    padding to the user [EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding(ctx, 0)] and to
    always use a temporary malloc'ed buffer for decryption

- Changes since version 0.7.1
  * tpm2: Fix TDES key creation by adding missing un-/marshalling
    functions
  * tpm2: Fix a bug in CheckAuthSession
  * compilation fixes for TPM 1.2 & TPM 2 and various architectures
    and gcc versions
  * Fix support for NIST curves P{192,224,521} and SM2 P256 and
    BNP648 that would not work;
  * Runtime filter elliptic curves (that OpenSSL does not support)
    and do not advertise those curves as capabilities
  * Removed unnecessary space in MANUFACTURER "IBM " -> "IBM"
