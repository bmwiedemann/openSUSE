  <title>Routines For a Integer Based Number Theoretic Applications</title>
  <description> LibTomMath provides highly optimized and portable routines for a vast
majority of integer based number theoretic applications (including public
key cryptography). LibTomMath is not a cryptographic toolkit itself but it
can be used to write one [Used in LibTomCrypt for RSA, DH and ECC public key
routines].
