- update to 1.5.2
 * Allow recorder to handle a "max buffer size" when communicating
   with an agent
 * Show function return value in function graph if supported
   (new feature in the Linux kernel starting in v6.5)
 * Fix split code that failed if the optional section "cmdline" was
   not present
 * Fix tracecmd_start_recording() to not fail if there's no data in
   polling mode
 * Fix stack trace printing logic within filtering
 * Optimize tracecmd_iterate_events() when limited to a set of CPUs
 * Fix some memory leaks
 * Call dlclose() after errors in loading plugins
 * Fix memory corruption issues
 * Clean up of some code
 * Fix python module

Mon Jan 29 22:07:19 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.5.1:
  * Fix free_zpage() offset accounting. The read_zpage() subtracted
    the offset from the file start to find where to get the
    compressed data, but the free_zpage() did not, and would fail to
    find and free the passed in zpage.
  * Have function_graph plugin break apart functions that migrate
    between CPUs from entry to exit even if there is no event in
    between.
  * Fix iterators for when there's CPUs with no data. It was using
    the total number of CPUs to iterate the cpu_data[] array, that
    only contains CPUs with content.
  * Fix iterator with respect to function_graph handle that may do
    a peek of the next event to know if it should merge the entry
    and exit events of a function.
  * Some other small fixes and clean ups
  * tracecmd_iterate_events_reverse(): Will iterate events in the
    trace.dat file from the last event to the first.
  * tracecmd_iterate_reset(): Reset the iterator to restart from the
    beginning.
  * Fix meson build
  * Have callbacks exit out of iterator as the man page for
    tracecmd_iterate_events() says it should.
  * Have tracecmd_iterate_events() start where it left off
  * Speed up freeing the zpages by using an rbtree instead of a flat
    link

  Split libtracecmd from trace-cmd into a separate package because
  libracecmd has a different release cycle and doesn't allign with
  trace-cmd.
