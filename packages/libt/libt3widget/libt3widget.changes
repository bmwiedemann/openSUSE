Mon Aug 29 09:52:30 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.2.2
  * Fix incorrect computation of the number of endchars in a
    text_line when the end of the line truncated a double-width
    character. This would cause a segmentation fault in the
    t3window library.
  * This release fixes a bug which makes Tilde crash on start up,
    due to a typo in a copy-assignment operator signature which
    causes an infinite recursion.

- Update to release 1.2.0
  * This release provides several new features and bug fixes,
    among which:
  * Pressing ctrl+backspace will delete the previous word,
  * Extra navigation keys (+/- and arrows) for expander widgets.
  * Checkboxes can now have a third, indeterminate, state.
  * Frame resizing correctly redraws the frame.
  * This release changes the selection of binary attributes to
    make the distinction between explicitly unset and fallback
    from base attribute

- Update to new upstream release 1.0.6
  * This release makes the indent_selection and
    unindent_selection functions on edit_window_t behave exactly
    as pressing tab or shift-tab. This resolves a segmentation
    fault when calling these functions without a selected text.

Mon Jan  7 15:42:03 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.0.3
  * Fixed: The indicator in list panes would disappear of screen
    when scrolling beyond the first page.
  * Fixed: The cursor position after undoing an unindent
    operation was set incorrectly.
  * Fixed: Bracketed paste mode was not handled correctly due to
    inadvertent setting of the EKEY_PROTECT bit.
  * The API has been overhauled to use more of the features of
    the C++11 standard.
  * Fixed: Unsplitting caused segmentation faults.
  * The connection to GPM remained open during suspend, making
    GPM useless for the duration of the suspend.
  * Prevent the mouse cursor from moving beyond the top of the
    screen while holding down the mouse button in GPM mode.
  * Ensure that the mouse cursor is visible when the holding down
    the mouse button in GPM mode.
  * Allow searching for empty strings using regular expressions.

  the cursor with the mouse; a crash when clicking beyond the text
  in wrap mode; sanitization of directory names.

- Update to new upstream release 0.4.4
