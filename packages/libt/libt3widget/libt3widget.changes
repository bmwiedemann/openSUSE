- Update to new upstream release 1.0.6
  * This release makes the indent_selection and
    unindent_selection functions on edit_window_t behave exactly
    as pressing tab or shift-tab. This resolves a segmentation
    fault when calling these functions without a selected text.

- Update to new upstream release 1.0.3
  * Fixed: The indicator in list panes would disappear of screen
    when scrolling beyond the first page.
  * Fixed: The cursor position after undoing an unindent
    operation was set incorrectly.
  * Fixed: Bracketed paste mode was not handled correctly due to
    inadvertent setting of the EKEY_PROTECT bit.
  * The API has been overhauled to use more of the features of
    the C++11 standard.
  * Fixed: Unsplitting caused segmentation faults.
  * The connection to GPM remained open during suspend, making
    GPM useless for the duration of the suspend.
  * Prevent the mouse cursor from moving beyond the top of the
    screen while holding down the mouse button in GPM mode.
  * Ensure that the mouse cursor is visible when the holding down
    the mouse button in GPM mode.
  * Allow searching for empty strings using regular expressions.
