-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 29 13:46:49 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add handle-Werror-return-type.patch
- disable lto, breaks libtool as seen in testsuite 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 20 20:47:49 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.4.7:
  - Libtool script now supports (configure-time and runtime) ARFLAGS
    variable, which obsoletes AR_FLAGS.  This is due to naming conventions
    among other *FLAGS and to be consistent with Automake's ARFLAGS.
  - Gnulib testsuite is enabled and run during 'make check'.
  - Support the Windows version of the Intel C Compiler (icl) in
    libtool script.
  - Pass '-fsanitize=*' flags for GCC and LLVM, and '-specs=*' for GCC
    to linker.
  - Pass '-Xassembler=*' and '-Wa,*' flag to compilers and linkers.
  - The variable 'FILECMD' with default value of '/usr/bin/file' was used to
    replace existing hard coded references to '/usr/bin/file'.
  - Add MidnightBSD support.
  - Libtool changed ARFLAGS/AR_FLAGS default from 'cru' to 'cr'.
  - Do not pass '-pthread' to Solaris linker.
  - 'libtool' and 'libtoolize' scripts now use '#! /usr/bin/env sh' shebang.
    Previously '#! /bin/sh' was used, which presents challenges for
    containerized environments.
  - Fix significant slowdown of libtoolize for certain projects (regression
    introduced in 2.4.3 release) caused by infinite m4 macro recursion.
  - Mitigate the slowdown of libtool script (introduced in v2.4.3) caused by
    increased number of calls to '$SED $sed_quote_subst' (bug#20006).
  - Properly parse and export TLS symbols on AIX.
  - Various bug fixes surrounding use of 'sed'.
  - Darwin systems set proper "allow undefined" flag on OSX 11, and
    PowerPC 10.5.
  - Removed some deprecated tests related to 'Makefile.inc' files. 
- merge in testsuite, disable for now, isn't building for a while

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  to make package build reproducible (boo#1084909)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 14:16:43 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Drop libtool-no_host_name.patch for now: since we are upgrading
  to automake 1.16, we can't have any patch that would require us
  to bootstrap libtool, as this is not exactly trivial.
- Remove the line containing 'uname -m' from the libtool.m4 package
  after installation: this has the same effect as the patch above
  had.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 15:29:34 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.4.6:
  Noteworthy changes in release 2.4.6 (2015-02-15) [stable]

  * New features:

   - LT_SYS_LIBRARY_PATH can be set in config.site, or at configure time
     and persists correctly in the generated libtool script.

  * Bug fixes:

   - Fix a race condition in ltdl dryrun test that would cause spurious
     random failures of that test.

   - LT_SYS_DLSEARCH_PATH is munged correctly.

- Add tarball signature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  9 12:45:26 CET 2015 - pth@suse.de

- Add libtool-no_host_name.patch to remove the host name from
  generated scripts (bnc#916268).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 22 23:26:38 UTC 2015 - foss@grueninger.de

- Update to libtool 2.4.5
  New features:

  - Libtoolize searches for the best available M4 on the user PATH at
    runtime, rather than settling for the first one found.

  - Support munging sys_lib_dlsearch_path_spec with LT_SYS_LIBRARY_PATH
    environment variable.

  Bug fixes:

  - Bail out at configure time if the installed M4 is not sufficient
    for the purposes of libtoolize.

  - freebsd-elf library versioning was upgraded incorrectly in 2.4.4,
    but now works properly again.

  - Fix a 2.4.4 regression so that libltdl subprojects do not warn
    about missing libltdl/libltdl directory as in prior releases.

  - When using Sun C++ on Solaris or GNU/Linux we used to set libtool's
    postdeps permanently, based on the contents of $CXX and $CXXFLAGS at
    configure time, which was brittle and error-prone.  Now, we no
    longer check for a SunCC ABI at configure time, but augment the
    postdeps at libtool time based on the current invocation flags on
    each call.

  Changes in supported systems or compilers:

  - /usr/local prefixed rpaths are now added to the link-line on
    ia64-hp-hpux*, because the default system runtime loader path does
    not contain them.

  - Previously, when using Sun C++ on Solaris or GNU/Linux, `-Cstd -Crun`
    flags were added to $postdeps unless CXX or CXXFLAGS contained
    `-library=stlport4`.  Newer releases have added other compiler flags
    that are also incompatible with `-Cstd -Crun`, so now we don't add
    them if any of `-std=c++[0-9][0-9]`, `-library=stdcxx4` or
    `-compat=g` were found in CXX or CXXFLAGS when the Sun C++ compiler
    is detected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  6 21:11:04 UTC 2014 - foss@grueninger.de

- Require M4 as libtool's libtoolize requires it since 2.4.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 29 19:48:44 UTC 2014 - foss@grueninger.de

- Drop patch libtool-dont_delete_gnulib_files.patch which is
  included in 2.4.4

- Update to libtool 2.4.4
** New features:

  - Libltdl maintains its own fork of argz, with macros and files in
    the LT_ and lt__ namespaces (resp.) where they cannot clash with
    client projects' use of gnulib argz.

** Bug fixes:

  - Installation of 'libtoolize' once again obeys '--program-prefix',
    '--program-suffix' and '--program-transform-name' configure options.

  - `libtoolize` doesn't remove any files that it can't reinstall,
    including old versions of the snippet directory, and gnulib's
    version of the argz module and supporting files.

  - LT_FUNC_DLYSM_USCORE now works correctly on systems that don't
    support self dlopen()ing.

** Important incompatible changes:

  - LT_LIB_DLLOAD no longer prepends -ldl or -ldld to LIBS, causing
    duplicate occurrences in libltdl link lines.  If you need to
    add a library for dlopen() or shl_load() in your Makefile, then
    use $(LIBADD_DLOPEN) or $(LIBADD_SHL_LOAD) respectively.  If you
    are using libltdl, this all happens automatically, and the only
    difference you'll see is no more duplicated library names in the
    verbose link line.

** Changes in supported systems or compilers:

  - Preliminary support for tcc on linux*.  Although it already worked
    sometimes in previous releases, making sure to set LD correctly now
    avoids mis-matching GNU ld with tcc:

       ./configure CC=tcc LD=tcc

  - Added -os2dllname option to work around 8 character base name
    limit on OS/2.  The option has no effect on other systems.

  - Support for DLL versioning, -export-symbols and -export-symbols-regex
    on OS/2.

  - Support filename-based shared library versioning on AIX. See manual
    for details.

- 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 21 11:00:57 CET 2014 - pth@suse.de

- Add libtool-dont_delete_gnulib_files.patch that prevents deletion
  of files from gnulib to be deleted by libtoolize.
- BuildRequire help2man.
- Remove unneeded clean section.
- Use rpm macros where possible.
- Pass V=1 to make to make compilation verbose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  3 22:35:18 UTC 2014 - foss@grueninger.de

- Drop patch config-guess-sub-update.patch for libltdl/config as the
  folder no longer exists.
- Drop patch libtool-ppc64le.patch for ppc handling as it is already
  part of v2.4.3

- Update to libtool 2.4.3
** New features:

 - Moved to gnulib release infrastructure.

 - M4 is now used for scanning the M4 macros in your configure.ac that
  'libtoolize' looks at to determine what files you want, and where you
   would like them installed.  This means that you can compose your
   version number or any other argument that Libtoolize needs to know at
   M4 time using git-version-gen from gnulib, for example.

 - Invoking 'libtoolize --ltdl' no longer maintains a separate autoconf
   macro directory in the libltdl tree, but automatically adjusts the
   installed libltdl configuration files to share whatever macro
   directory is declared by the parent project. (Note: if you were
   already sharing a macro directory with AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR(ltdl/m4)
   or similar, that still works as does any other directory choice).

 - Invoking 'libtoolize --ltdl' no longer maintains a separate auxiliary
   scripts directory in the libltdl tree, but automatically adjusts the
   installed libltdl configuration files to share whatever auxiliary
   scripts directory is declared by the parent project. (Note: if you
   were already sharing an auxiliary directory with subproject libltdl
   using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(ltdl/config) or similar, that still works as
   does any other directory choice).

 - The legacy tests have all been migrated to the Autotest harness.

 - The Autotest testsuite can be run without the especially time consuming
   tests with:

       make check-local TESTSUITEFLAGS='-k "!expensive"'

** Bug fixes:

 - Fix a long-standing latent bug in autom4te include path for autotests
   with VPATH builds.
 - Fix a long-standing latent bug in libtoolize that could delete lines
   from libltdl/Makefile.am in recursive mode due to underquoting in a
   sed script.
 - Fix a long-standing bug in libtoolize, by outputting the 'putting
   auxiliary files in' header with 'libtoolize --ltdl --subproject'.
 - Fix a long-standing bug in libtoolize subproject installation, by not
   installing a set of autoconf macro files into the parent project if
   there is no configure.ac present to use them.
 - The libtoolize subproject mode selector is now named '--subproject'
   and is equivalent to the implied '--subproject' mode when no other
   mode is selected; '--standalone' never worked, and is no longer
   accepted.
 - Libtool and libtoolize no longer choke on paths with a comma in them.
 - In the case where $SHELL does not have the same enhanced features
   (e.g. the ability to parse 'var+=append') as $CONFIG_SHELL, libtool
   will now correctly fallback to using only vanilla shell features
   instead of failing with a parse at startup.
 - Correctly recognize import libraries when Microsoft dumpbin is used
   as the name lister and extend the dumpbin wrapper to find symbols
   in import libraries using the -headers option of dumpbin. Also fix a
   bug in the dumpbin wrapper that could lead to broken symbol listings
   in some corner cases.
 - Use the improved Microsoft dumpbin support to mend preloading of
   import libraries for Microsoft Visual C/C++.
 - No longer mangle module-definition (.def) files when feeding them to
   the Microsoft Visual C/C++ linker via the -export-symbols argument to
   the libtool script, thus matching how .def files are handled when
   using GNU tools.
 - Recognize more variants (e.g. those starting with a LIBRARY statement)
   of module-definitions (.def) files when using them instead of a raw
   list of symbols to export.
 - Fix a long-standing bug when using libtoolize without automake; we
   no longer remove install-sh with --force, since it's not a file
   libtoolize will reinstall without --install..

** Important incompatible changes:

 - GNU M4 is required to run libtoolize in a directory with a
   'configure.ac' (or 'configure.in') that needs tracing to determine
   what modes and directories have been specified.

 - The use of the idiosyncratically named 'Makefile.inc' in nonrecursive
   libltdl builds is deprecated, although it will be supported for one
   more year or until the next release, whichever takes longer.  Please
   upgrade to the more standard naming of 'ltdl.mk' in keeping with other
   GNU projects.

 - libtoolize now behaves consistenty in respect of multiple directory
   arguments to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS and multiple invocations of AC_CONFIG-
   _MACRO_DIRS, where the first directory is always selected.  Previous
   releases took the first ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS argument, but the last
   invocation of AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS.

 - The libtoolize program now advises use of the new Autoconf
   AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS declaration.  If you follow that advice, all
   your developers will need at least autoconf-2.70 and automake-1.13
   to rebootstrap your probject.  If you still need to support
   bootstrap with older Autotools, then you should add the following
   to your configure.ac file:

       m4_ifndef([AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS],
           [m4_define([AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS],
               m4_defn([AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR]))])

 - Overhead of probing for a non-backslash crippled echo equivalent
   during initialization of every script has been removed in favor of
   trusting that "printf %s\n" works out of the box on all non-museum
   host architectures.  Manually setting ECHO appropriately in the
   build environment will be necessary on some ancient architectures.

** Changes in supported systems or compilers:

 - Support for bitrig (*-*-bitrig*).

 - Solaris 7 and earlier requires ECHO=/usr/ucb/echo in the build
   environment, to build and use libtool.

    from ./bootstrap is fixed.
  - Improved support for the Cuda Compiler Driver (nvcc) on Darwin.

Wed Mar  9 14:07:54 UTC 2011 - giecrilj@stegny.2a.pl

- update to 2.4, which has quite some new stuff. Limiting here to
  incompatible changes:

 - The fix_srcfile_path variable has been replaced by a more thorough
    mechanism triggered by the to_tool_file_cmd variable.
 - The wrapper command line option support described above introduces the
    following incompatibility: the wrapper will remove any command line
    options that begin with '--lt-*' from the argument list before launching
    (uninstalled) programs. Any '--lt-*' option on the command line not
    recognized by the wrapper will result in an error.
 - The type of the symbol lists variables (lt_*_LTX_preloaded_symbols) has
    been fixed in the manual and in a couple of tests to match the actual
    implementation.

  * Fix libltdl to no longer attempt to dlopen() the old_library
    listed in the .la file. Now will use only the preopen loader to
    attempt to load it. This may be a security issue, all users are
    advised to upgrade.
