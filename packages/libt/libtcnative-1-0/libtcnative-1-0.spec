%description
The Apache Tomcat Native Library is an optional component for use
with Apache Tomcat that allows Tomcat to use certain native
resources for performance, compatibility, etc.

Specifically, the Apache Tomcat Native Library gives Tomcat access
to the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library's network connection
(socket) implementation and random-number generator. See the Apache
Tomcat documentation for more information on how to configure Tomcat
to use the APR connector.

Features of the APR connector:

* Non-blocking I/O for Keep-Alive requests (between requests)
* Uses OpenSSL for TLS/SSL capabilities (if supported by linked APR
  library)
* FIPS 140-2 support for TLS/SSL (if supported by linked OpenSSL
  library)
* Support for IPv4, IPv6 and Unix Domain Sockets
