- Update to version 21.07:
  * The sorting order of files in archives was slightly changed to be more
    consistent for cases where the name of some directory is the same as the
    prefix part of the name of another directory or file.
  * TAR archives created by 7-Zip now are more consistent with archives
    created by GNU TAR program.
- Remove unneeded pach remove-rar-handler.patch
- Use the tarball in place of the 7zip archive as Source

- update to version 21.06
  * Bug in LZMA encoder in file LzmaEnc.c was fixed:
    - LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() and LzmaCompress() could work
      incorrectly, if size value for output buffer is smaller than size
      required for all compressed data.
    - LzmaEnc_Encode() could work incorrectly, if callback
      ISeqOutStream::Write() doesn't write all compressed data.
    - NCompress::NLzma::CEncoder::Code() could work incorrectly,
      if callback ISequentialOutStream::Write() returns error code.
  * Bug in versions 21.00-21.05 was fixed:
    7-Zip didn't set attributes of directories during archive extracting.

- update to version 21.04
  * 7-Zip now reduces the number of working CPU threads for compression,
    if RAM size is not enough for compression with big LZMA2 dictionary.
  * 7-Zip now can create and check "file.sha256" and "file.sha1" text
    files that contain the list of file names and SHA-1 / SHA-256
    checksums in format compatible with sha1sum/sha256sum programs.

- update to version 21.03
  * The maximum dictionary size for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased
    to 4 GB (3840 MiB).
  * Minor speed optimizations in LZMA/LZMA2 compressing.
