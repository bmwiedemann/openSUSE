Wed Mar  6 12:46:58 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use autosetup -c instead of manually extracting the tarball and
  applying patches: allows us to eliminate the usage of deprecated
  %patchN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 23 11:32:54 UTC 2024 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Fix build on SLE-15-SP6
  * fix-avx-sle.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 20:37:25 UTC 2024 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

Tue Jul 18 02:01:41 UTC 2023 - Linnaea Lavia <linnaea@lavia.moe>

- Enable ARM64 ASM introduced in 23.01

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 10:15:05 UTC 2023 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Update to version 23.01:
  * 7-Zip now can use new ARM64 filter for compression to 7z and xz archives.
    ARM64 filter can increase compression ratio for data containing executable files
    compiled for ARM64 (AArch64) architecture.
  * Default section size for BCJ2 filter was changed from 64 MiB to 240 MiB. It
    can increase compression ratio for executable files larger than 64 MiB.
  * UDF: support was improved.
  * cpio: support for hard links.
  * Some changes and optimizations in WIM creation code.
  * When new 7-Zip creates multivolume archive, 7-Zip keeps in open state only
    volumes that still can be changed. Previous versions kept all volumes in open
    state until the end of the archive creation.
  * 7-Zip now can reduce the number of simultaneously open files, when
    7-Zip opens, extracts or creates multivolume archive. It allows to avoid the
    failures for cases with big number of volumes, bacause there is a limitation for
    number of open files allowed for a single program in Linux.
  * The bugs were fixed:
    * ZIP archives: if multithreaded zip compression was performed with
      more than one file to stdout stream (-so switch), 7-zip didn't write "data
      descriptor" for some files.
    * ext4 archives: 7-Zip couldn't correctly extract symbolic link to directory from ext4 archives.
    * HFS and APFS archives: 7-Zip incorrectly decoded uncompressed blocks (64 KiB) in compressed forks.
    * Some another bugs were fixed.

  bsc#1202197

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 22 21:16:09 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 22.01:
  * UDF support was improved to UDF version 2.60.
  * HFS and APFS support was improved. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  3 21:01:22 UTC 2022 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 22.00: 
  * 7-Zip now can extract APFS (Apple File System) images that can be used in DMG files.
  * 7-Zip now can create TAR archives in POSIX (pax) tar format with the switches
    -ttar -mm=pax or -ttar -mm=posix
  * 7-Zip now can store additional file timestamps with high precision (1 ns in Linux) 
    in tar/pax archives with the following switches:
    -ttar -mm=pax -mtp=3 -mtc -mta
  * New switches for Linux version for TAR archives:
    -snoi : store owner/group ids in archive or set owner/group ids from archive to extracted files. 
    -snon : store owner/group names in archive
  * New -snz switch to propagate Zone.Identifier stream to extracted files (Windows).
  * New option "Propagate Zone.Id stream" in Tools/Options/7-Zip menu.
  * New "Options" window in "Add to archive" allows to select what metadata must be 
    included to archive. Also it allows to select new option 
    "Do not change source files last access time".
  * Some bugs were fixed.

Mon Jan  3 11:31:10 UTC 2022 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to version 21.07:
  * The sorting order of files in archives was slightly changed to be more
    consistent for cases where the name of some directory is the same as the
    prefix part of the name of another directory or file.
  * TAR archives created by 7-Zip now are more consistent with archives
    created by GNU TAR program.

- update to version 21.06
  * Bug in LZMA encoder in file LzmaEnc.c was fixed:
    - LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() and LzmaCompress() could work
      incorrectly, if size value for output buffer is smaller than size
      required for all compressed data.
    - LzmaEnc_Encode() could work incorrectly, if callback
      ISeqOutStream::Write() doesn't write all compressed data.
    - NCompress::NLzma::CEncoder::Code() could work incorrectly,
      if callback ISequentialOutStream::Write() returns error code.
  * Bug in versions 21.00-21.05 was fixed:
    7-Zip didn't set attributes of directories during archive extracting.

- update to version 21.04
  * 7-Zip now reduces the number of working CPU threads for compression,
    if RAM size is not enough for compression with big LZMA2 dictionary.
  * 7-Zip now can create and check "file.sha256" and "file.sha1" text
    files that contain the list of file names and SHA-1 / SHA-256
    checksums in format compatible with sha1sum/sha256sum programs.

- update to version 21.03
  * The maximum dictionary size for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased
    to 4 GB (3840 MiB).
  * Minor speed optimizations in LZMA/LZMA2 compressing.
