Sun Jul  6 10:28:04 UTC 2025 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0
  * Fixed the work on big endian processors.
  * Fixed ARM64 build on some platforms.
  * Improved support of the EA-MUS files.
  * Fixed crash on attempt to change the volume of a blank note.
  * Added an ability to supply the custom list of embedded banks
    using -DGENADLDATA_CUSTOM_BANKLIST=/path/to/ini/file.ini
    argument
  * Improved support of the CMF files: added support for previously
    missing transpose, depth control, and song marker controllers.
  * Added ESFMu emulator for the future ESFM support (Currently
    used as one another OPL3 emulator and without panned stereo
    support yet).
  * Added YMFM emulator support (OPL3 and OPL2).
  * Added support for OPL2 mode when some emulators enabled.
  * Added Nuked OPL2 and OPL3 Low-Level emulators (Kept disabled
    by default because they are too heavy for ordinary processors).
  * Fixed a dead loop that might happen when final tone gets lower
    than zero.
  * Added possibility to play the same note multiple times at the
    same MIDI channel (Resolved playback of some music, like
    Heretic's E1M6).
  * Dual-voice 2-op instruments will be squashed to single 2-op
    voice when available chip channels are overflow (The stability
    of DMX-oriented music has been improved).

Mon Oct 31 08:50:23 UTC 2022 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.5.1
  * Added an ability to disable the automatical arpeggio.
  * Added an ability to set the count of loops (how many times to
    play the song).
  * Added an ability to disable/enable the playing of selected
    MIDI channels.
  * Fixed memory damages and crashes while playing XMI files.
  * Added bank-specific MT32 defaults (to don't confuse XMI
    playback between different games, works for AIL and IBK only,
    and for WOPL if set at the header).
  * Added the chip channels allocation mode option.
  * Fixed the playback of multi-song XMI files.
  * Added an ability to switch the XMI song on the fly.

Mon May  3 15:17:19 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 1.5.0.1.1
  * Fixed an incorrect timer processing when using a real-time
    interface

Mon Sep 28 17:18:29 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.5.0
  * Drum note length expanding is now supported in real-time mode.
  * Channels manager has been improved.
  * Nuked OPL3 1.8 emulator got some optimizations ported from 1.7
   where they are was applied previously.
  * Reworked rhythm-mode percussions system, WOPL banks with
    rhythm-mode percussions
  * Added Public Domain Opal OPL3 emulator made by Reality (a team
    who originally made the Reality Adlib Tracker).
  * Added LGPL licensed JavaOPL3 emulator made by Robson Cozendey
    in Java and later rewritten into C++ for GZDoom.
  * Fully rewritten an embedded bank database format, embedded
    banks now supports a wider set (more than 127:127 instruments
    in one bank).
  * Improved accuracy of the DMX volume model, include the buggy
    AM interpretation.
  * Improved accuracy of Apogee volume model, include the bug of
    AM instruments.
  * Improved accuracy of the Win9X volume model.
  * Removed C++ extras. C++-bounded instruments tester is useless
    since a real-time MIDI API can completely replace it.
  * Added AIL volume model.
  * Added Generic FM variant of Win9X volume model.
  * Fixed an incorrect work of CC-121.
  * Added HMI volume model.
  * Added frequency models, assigned to every volume model: AIL,
    HMI, DMX, Apogee, 9X, and the Generic formula.
- Drop patch:
  * libadlmidi-fix-arm.patch (not longer needed)
