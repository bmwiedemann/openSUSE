  <title>Linux-Native Asynchronous I/O Access Library</title>
  <description>The Linux-native asynchronous I/O facility (&quot;async I/O&quot;, or &quot;aio&quot;) has
a richer API and capability set than the simple POSIX async I/O
facility. This library provides the Linux-native API for async I/O. The
POSIX async I/O facility requires this library to provide
kernel-accelerated async I/O capabilities, as do applications that
require the Linux-native async I/O API.</description>
