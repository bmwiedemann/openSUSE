Sun Feb 13 23:37:46 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.0
  * New symbol table reader component.
  * Correctness of type canonicalization.
  * Support for DWARF 5.
  * abidw now emits ABIXML files in a new format, dubbed version
    2.0.
  * abipkgdiff should now properly show binary files that were
    either added to or removed from packages. It also stops
    erasing the working directory used for binary comparison
    before it's done using their content.
  * abidiff: Data members are no longer qualified in diff
    reports. The --dump-diff-tree option now works in the leaf
    reporting mode.
