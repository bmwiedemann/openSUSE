ABIGAIL constructs, manipulates, (de-)serializes ABI-relevant
artifacts, such as types, variable, fonctions and declarations
(collectively, the ABI corpus) of a given library or program. The
library provides a way to compare two ABI corpuses, provide detailed
information about their differences, and help build tools to infer
interesting conclusions about these differences.
