  <title>Adaptive Entropy Coding library</title>
  <description>Libaec provides lossless compression of signed or unsigned integers
(samples) of sizes 1 to 32 bits wide. The library achieves best
results for low entropy data as often encountered in space imaging
instrument data or numerical model output from weather or climate
simulations.

Libaec implements Golomb Rice coding as defined in the Space Data
System Standard documents 121.0-B-2 and 120.0-G-2.

Libaec includes a drop-in replacement for the SZIP
library (http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP).</description>
