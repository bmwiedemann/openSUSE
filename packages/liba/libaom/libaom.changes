- Update to version 3.1.0 (bsc#1185843):
  https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/refs/tags/v3.1.0

  This release adds an "all intra" mode to the encoder, which significantly
  speeds up the encoding of AVIF still images at speed 6.

  - Upgrading:
    All intra mode for encoding AVIF still images and AV1 all intra videos:
    AOM_USAGE_ALL_INTRA (2) can be passed as the 'usage' argument to
    aom_codec_enc_config_default().

    New encoder control IDs added:
      - AV1E_SET_ENABLE_DIAGONAL_INTRA: Enable diagonal (D45 to D203) intra
        prediction modes (0: false, 1: true (default)). Also available as
        "enable-diagonal-intra" for the aom_codec_set_option() function.

    New aom_tune_metric enum value: AOM_TUNE_BUTTERAUGLI. The new aomenc option
    --tune=butteraugli was added to optimize the encoder’s perceptual quality by
    optimizing the Butteraugli metric. Install libjxl (JPEG XL) and then pass
    -DCONFIG_TUNE_BUTTERAUGLI=1 to the cmake command to enable it.


- Includes 3.0
  https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/refs/tags/v3.0.0
This release includes compression efficiency improvement, speed improvement
for realtime mode, as well as some new APIs.

  - Upgrading:

    Support for PSNR calculation based on stream bit-depth.

    New encoder control IDs added:
      - AV1E_SET_ENABLE_RECT_TX
      - AV1E_SET_VBR_CORPUS_COMPLEXITY_LAP
      - AV1E_GET_BASELINE_GF_INTERVAL
      - AV1E_SET_ENABLE_DNL_DENOISING

    New decoder control IDs added:
      - AOMD_GET_FWD_KF_PRESENT
      - AOMD_GET_FRAME_FLAGS
      - AOMD_GET_ALTREF_PRESENT
      - AOMD_GET_TILE_INFO
      - AOMD_GET_SCREEN_CONTENT_TOOLS_INFO
      - AOMD_GET_STILL_PICTURE
      - AOMD_GET_SB_SIZE
      - AOMD_GET_SHOW_EXISTING_FRAME_FLAG
      - AOMD_GET_S_FRAME_INFO

    New aom_tune_content enum value: AOM_CONTENT_FILM

    New aom_tune_metric enum value: AOM_TUNE_VMAF_NEG_MAX_GAIN

    Coefficient and mode update can be turned off via
    AV1E_SET_{COEFF/MODE}_COST_UPD_FREQ.

    New key & value API added, available with aom_codec_set_option() function.
    Scaling API expanded to include 1/4, 3/4 and 1/8.

  - Enhancements:

    Better multithreading performance with realtime mode.
    New speed 9 setting for faster realtime encoding.
    Smaller binary size with low bitdepth and realtime only build.
    Temporal denoiser and its optimizations on x86 and Neon.
    Optimizations for scaling.
    Faster encoding with speed settings 2 to 6 for good encoding mode.
    Improved documentation throughout the library, with function level
    documentation, tree view and support for the dot tool.

  - Bug fixes:
    Aside from those mentioned in v2.0.1 and v2.0.2, this release includes the
    following bug fixes:

    Issue 2940: Segfault when encoding with --use-16bit-internal and --limit > 1
    Issue 2941: Decoder mismatch with --rt --bit-depth=10 and --cpu-used=8
    Issue 2895: mingw-w64 i686 gcc fails to build
    Issue 2874: Separate ssse3 functions from sse2 file.

Tue May 19 12:32:12 UTC 2020 - daniel.molkentin@suse.com

- Update to version 2.0.0 "Applejack":
  
  This is the first official release of libaom. It has real-time
  mode and SVC support, as well as substantial documentation
  improvement and clean-ups.

  Important changes:
  * Decouple library version and so version.
  * Move functions into a header file
  * Remove av1_ prefix from static functions
  * Remove aom_ prefix from static functions
  * Remove aom_ prefix for static functions
  * Remove av1_ prefix for a static function
- Drop libaom-0002-link-threading-lib-with-shared-library.patch and
  libaom-0003-update-CHANGELOG.patch

- Enable CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH. Makes 8-bit decoding faster. The only
  reason this confusingly-named option is not enabled by default
  is that its behavior might not match the 16-bit reference code
  path, and that hardware vendors want to be able to validate
  their designs against it. No actual mismatches have been found.
