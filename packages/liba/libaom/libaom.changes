- Enable CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH. Makes 8-bit decoding faster. The only
  reason this confusingly-named option is not enabled by default
  is that its behavior might not match the 16-bit reference code
  path, and that hardware vendors want to be able to validate
  their designs against it. No actual mismatches have been found.
