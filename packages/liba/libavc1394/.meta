  <title>Libavc1394--Programming Interface to the AV/C Specification</title>
  <description>Libavc1394 is a programming interface to the AV/C specification from
the 1394 Trade Association. AV/C stands for Audio/Video Control.
Currently, applications use the library to control the tape transport
mechanism on DV camcorders. However, there are many devices and device
functions that can be controlled via AV/C. Eventually, the library will
be expanded to implement more of the specification and to provide a
high level interface to various devices.</description>
