- Update to version 0.15.0
  * Fix backwards/VSFilter-incompatible font sizes with FreeType
    2.10+
  * Improve speed via better caching
  * Require HarfBuzz unconditionally to ensure good shaping for
    complex scripts
  * ass_set_use_margins(true) now simply places text on the whole

    margins are used to implement pan & scan in a video player
  * Add ass_track_set_feature() & catch-all
    ASS_FEATURE_INCOMPATIBLE_EXTENSIONS
  * Add ASS_FEATURE_BIDI_BRACKETS to enable Unicode 6.3+ bracket
    matching when applying the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
    (incompatible with VSFilter; requires libass built with
    FriBidi 1.0+)
  * Fix stack overflow on deeply nested \t tags
  * Fix positioning of events with leading line breaks
  * Fix small but nonzero \bord becoming \bord0 (regression in
    0.14.0)
  * Measure BorderStyle=4 box padding from glyph border, not
    from glyph fill
  * Scale everything from script resolution if storage size is
    not set (including borders and shadows regardless of
    ScaledBorderAndShadow)
  * Fix the default aspect ratio calculation when neither
    ass_set_pixel_aspect() nor ass_set_aspect_ratio() is called
  * Multiple fixes for karaoke override tags
  * Handle memory allocation failures better:
    avoid some crashes and produce images closer to truth
  * Avoid some integer overflows
  * Add internal infrastructure for regression testing
  * Improve VSFilter compatibility:
    + Treat invalid nested \t tags like VSFilter
    + Make \t(T,T,...) at time exactly T use the post-transition
      values
    + Make lines stack more like they do in VSFilter
    + Default ScaledBorderAndShadow to 0 (like VSFilter),
      except for subtitles that were produced by old FFmpeg/Libav
    + Make shadow positioning with 3D transforms match VSFilter's
    + Cut out glyphs from border & shadow in all the same cases
      as VSFilter
    + Match VSFilter on animated color tags with negative
      acceleration

      didn't by ignoring leading whitespace in each line of an
      ASS file or CodecPrivate
    + Improve font selection with CoreText
    + Stop faux-bolding fonts that are too bold to get faux bold
      in VSFilter
    + Ignore leading/trailing spaces when calculating height of
      nonblank lines
    + Match VSFilter on \fade with large alpha value arguments
    + Stop splitting bitmaps on font substitution

  * Remove option to use the FreeType rasterizer
  * Fix spots of missing border around self-intersecting shapes
  * Switch from Yasm to NASM for building hand-written assembler
    code

  * Add Justify style override that changes text justification

    breaks ABI compatibility with prior releases.

    including composite bitmap cache.
  * Number parsing fixes
    + Fix illegal read when parsing some numbers in scientific

      with \t tags.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  5 08:22:48 UTC 2016 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Update 0.13.4:

    CVE-2016-7972

Thu Feb 25 16:22:23 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 0.13.2
  * Add ass_set_check_readorder() API function to disable use of 
    the ReadOrder field for duplicate checking in 
    ass_process_chunk().
  * ass_step_sub(track, now, 0) now finds the start of the subtitle 
    at now.
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fix an issue with the new duplicate checking, which could 
      lead to missing subtitles after seeking.
    + Fix a crash with Core Text under specific circumstances.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 17 11:42:06 UTC 2015 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 0.13.1
  * Much faster duplicate event check in ass_process_chunk. 
  * Interpret negative timestamp components as actual negative numbers.
  * Look up fonts that contain PostScript outlines by their PostScript
    name instead of their full names. Family names continue to be used for all fonts.
  * Keep spaces in font names
  * Drop support for Fontconfig < 2.10.92 to ensure correct font matching
  * Fix some small memory leaks, potential crashes and bad data uses

- Update summary/description

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  7 20:26:25 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update RPM groups

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 22 22:00:00 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 0.13.0
  * Add native font selection backends for OSX (CoreText) and 
		Windows (DirectWrite). You can now run libass without 
		fontconfig on these platforms. This fixes problems with 
		fontconfig behaving badly on these platforms (it could take 
		minutes to scan all system fonts). Even on Linux, this speeds 
		up loading of embedded fonts (such as provided by 
		ass_add_font()). The DirectWrite backend only works on Windows 
		Vista and later. On XP, fontconfig is still needed. libass can 
		be compiled with both DirectWrite and fontconfig, and then it 
		will fallback to fontconfig automatically if DirectWrite is not 
		available at runtime.
	* Add ass_get_available_font_providers() API function.
	* Change the 4th parameter of ass_set_fonts(). This now selects 
		the font provider. This is somewhat backwards compatible with 
		the old behavior, but if you ever passed values other than 0 
		or 1, your application might break with this libass release.
	* The ass_fonts_update() function now does nothing. It's kept 
		for backward compatibility only.
	* Much faster gaussian blur. This can bring a large speedup with 
		big blurred signs and such.
	* Drop ENCA support
	* Bug fixes
		+ Fix compilation of the freetype rasterizer (disabled by 
			default)
		+ Fix rendering with some cases of consecutive line breaks 
			(\N\N).
		+ Fix some memory allocation failure checks
		+ Avoid system locale dependent behavior by reinventing some 
			standard C functions
		+ Fix rendering errors with strikes (GH #193)
		+ MSVC compilation fixes
- Enable harfbuzz and yasm build requires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
