Wed Dec  7 16:34:47 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.17.0:
  * This release’s major feature is the addition of a new ASS ScriptInfo
    header pair: LayoutResX and LayoutResY. The introduction has been
    coordinated with active VSFilters and will soon be available in xy-
    VSFilter and XySubFilter as well.
  * Since the beginning, many features in ASS scale relative to or are
    otherwise affected by the storage resolution of the video file the subs
    are bundled with. Adjusting subs for different video resolutions
    traditionally took non-trivial effort. Of course this behavior must be
    kept by default to preserve compatibility with existing files. But now,
    setting both of the new headers to a positive, non-zero value will
    replace the video storage resolution with the specified resolution for
    the whole file, allowing easy reuse across all encodes of the same
    display aspect ratio. This includes PAR effects, so reuse across
    anamorphic and non-anamorphic releases is possible too.
  * Detailed Changes:
  * Fix various parts relating to automatic linebreaking
  * Fix rendering when hinting was enabled and fontsizes or scales are zero
  * Switch build to a non-recursive setup for improved parallelism
  * Improve quality of SSA Effects movement
  * Further documentation improvements
  * Completely invalid Events are now discarded during parsing
  * Introduction of LayoutRes{X,Y} script headers
  * New AlphaLevel style override to set all alpha values while keeping the
    color
  * Add ASS_FEATURE_WRAP_UNICODE to allow automatic linebreaks in accordance
    with the Unicode line breaking algorithm instead of ASS' much stricter
    breaking rules. For the feature to be available at runtime, libass must
    be linked against the new optional dependency libunibreak.
  * Improve VSFilter compatibility:

  * Fix premature truncation of animated alphas (was a 0.15.0 regression)
  * Fix handling of small delay parameters for legacy SSA Effects
  * Fix x-scaling with PlayResX
  * Fix x-scaling for anamorphic video (except for \be whose scaling remains
    buggy in general)
  * Support SSA's AlphaLevel style field
  * Support the \kt override tag from VSFilter's v4++ set
  * Parse ScriptType headers
  * Parse integer header, style and event field values like VSFilter
  * Ignore trailing whitespace in an event's text

Wed May 18 15:21:57 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.16.0:
  + Fix crashes with fonts missing Postscript names and without one
    being synthesised by the font provider.
  + Fix crashes on negative fontsizes and some overflows.
  + Fix a rare memory leak introduced in 0.13.0.
  + x86: Fix potential buffer over-read by 16 bytes with AVX2
    assembly when large tiles are not enabled (the default).
  + x86: Fix PIC flags not being interpreted by the assembler,
    breaking the asm-enabled build setup on NetBSD and OpenBSD. On
    32-bit x86, if the toolchain requires PIC objects and relies on
    compiler defaults to get PIC implicitly, you need to pass
    --with-pic to configure to ensure NASM always produces PIC
    objects.
  + x86: Fix AVX support not being detected on non-Intel CPUs and
    some VMs.
  + x86: Fix CPUID being used on CPUs not supporting the
    instruction (<= i486) and the way it is used for CPUs with less
    than 7 CPUID-leafs which could lead to crashes due to illegal
    instructions.

  * Add ass_track_set_feature() & catch-all
    ASS_FEATURE_INCOMPATIBLE_EXTENSIONS
  * Add ASS_FEATURE_BIDI_BRACKETS to enable Unicode 6.3+ bracket
    matching when applying the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm

    FriBidi 1.0+)
  * Fix stack overflow on deeply nested \t tags
  * Fix positioning of events with leading line breaks
  * Fix small but nonzero \bord becoming \bord0 (regression in
    0.14.0)

    + Improve font selection with CoreText
    + Stop faux-bolding fonts that are too bold to get faux bold
      in VSFilter
    + Ignore leading/trailing spaces when calculating height of
      nonblank lines
    + Match VSFilter on \fade with large alpha value arguments
    + Stop splitting bitmaps on font substitution
    + Multiple fixes for Banner and Scroll effects
    + Multiple fixes for karaoke override tags

    at now.

    + Fix an issue with the new duplicate checking, which could 
      lead to missing subtitles after seeking.
    + Fix a crash with Core Text under specific circumstances.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 17 11:42:06 UTC 2015 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 0.13.1
  * Much faster duplicate event check in ass_process_chunk. 
  * Interpret negative timestamp components as actual negative numbers.

  * Fix some small memory leaks, potential crashes and bad data uses

- Update RPM groups

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 22 22:00:00 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 0.13.0
  * Add native font selection backends for OSX (CoreText) and 
		Windows (DirectWrite). You can now run libass without 
		fontconfig on these platforms. This fixes problems with 
		fontconfig behaving badly on these platforms (it could take 
		minutes to scan all system fonts). Even on Linux, this speeds 
		up loading of embedded fonts (such as provided by 
		ass_add_font()). The DirectWrite backend only works on Windows 
		Vista and later. On XP, fontconfig is still needed. libass can 
		be compiled with both DirectWrite and fontconfig, and then it 
		will fallback to fontconfig automatically if DirectWrite is not 
		available at runtime.
	* Add ass_get_available_font_providers() API function.
	* Change the 4th parameter of ass_set_fonts(). This now selects 
		the font provider. This is somewhat backwards compatible with 
		the old behavior, but if you ever passed values other than 0 
		or 1, your application might break with this libass release.
	* The ass_fonts_update() function now does nothing. It's kept 
		for backward compatibility only.
	* Much faster gaussian blur. This can bring a large speedup with 
		big blurred signs and such.
	* Drop ENCA support
	* Bug fixes
		+ Fix compilation of the freetype rasterizer (disabled by 
			default)
		+ Fix rendering with some cases of consecutive line breaks 
			(\N\N).
		+ Fix some memory allocation failure checks
		+ Avoid system locale dependent behavior by reinventing some 
			standard C functions
		+ Fix rendering errors with strikes (GH #193)
		+ MSVC compilation fixes
- Enable harfbuzz and yasm build requires
