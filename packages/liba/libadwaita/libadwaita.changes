- Update to version 1.0.0~alpha.3:
  + Depend on GTK 4.4.0.
  + Add a GtkInspector extension for simulating different system
    appearance settings.
  + Introduce AdwStyleManager for managing color schemes
    (light/dark) and high contrast mode.
  + Introduce AdwApplication to handle automatic initialization and
    style loading.
  + Avatar:
    - Replace adw_avatar_draw_to_pixbuf() with
      adw_avatar_draw_to_texture() that returns a GdkTexture
      instead.
    - Remove the size parameter, use the avatar's current size
      instead.
  + Carousel: Allow to shrink carousel if children are expanded.
  + Clamp: Fix measuring with for_size = -1.
  + Combo Row: Have a .combo style class.
  + Leaflet:
    - Remove hhomogeneous-folded, hhomogeneous-unfolded,
      vhomogeneous-folded and vhomogeneous-unfolded properties.
      Assume non-homogeneous layout when unfolded and homogeneous
      when folded.
    - Add a single homogeneous property that corresponds to folded
      state and opposite orientation.
    - Remove interpolate-size, assume it's set to true.
    - Set the fold threshold policy to MINIMUM by default.
  + Preferences Group:
    - Fix default visibility of the internal list box.
    - Allow markup on title and description.
  + Squeezer
    - Fix the child switch threshold in vertical orientation.
    - Add switch-threshold-policy, matching AdwFlap and AdwLeaflet.
    - Add allow-none property, allowing to hide the last child as
      well.
  + Status Page: Make icon optional.
  + Tab View: Fix model updates when page selection changes.
  + View Switchers:
    - Remove AdwViewSwitcher:narrow-ellipsize.
    - Remove the policy property from AdwViewSwitcherBar and
      AdwViewSwitcherTitle.
    - Remove the auto policy, applications can use two view
      switchers and an AdwSqueezer instead.
    - Switch to narrow layouts earlier.
  + Window and Application Window: Rename the child property to
    content to avoid the name clash with GtkWindow:child.
  + Stylesheet:
    - New style classes:
      . headerbar.flat to remove headerbar's background and border.
      . separator.spacer to create spacing in toolbars or header
        bars.
      . button.pill for prominent standalone buttons, for example
        on status pages.
      . statuspage.compact to make AdwStatusPage suitable for
        contexts such as sidebars.
      . .numeric as an easy way to enable tabular figures in a
        label.
  + Use flat buttons by default in header bars and action bars,
    matching existing .toolbar.
  + Use stripes for header bars in .devel windows instead of cogs
    to make it work better with split header bars and flat header
    bars.
  + Updated translations.
- Pass -Dinspector=false to meson: do not build the GTK Inspector
  right now.
