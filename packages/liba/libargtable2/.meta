  <title>ANSI C command line parser</title>
  <description>Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line options with a
minimum of fuss. It enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in the
source code as an array of argtable structs. The command line is then parsed
according to that specification and the resulting values are returned in those same
structs where they are accessible to the main program. Both tagged (-v, --verbose,
--foo=bar) and untagged arguments are supported, as are multiple instances of each 
argument. Syntax error handling is automatic and the library also provides the means
for generating a textual description of the command line syntax.
