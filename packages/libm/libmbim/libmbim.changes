      transaction id currently being used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 19 12:23:25 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Upate to version 1.24.2:
  + libmbim-glib:
    - Fixed several issues in the logic that merges the service
      subscribe list.
    - Improved message reading logic to skip malformed MBIM
      messages (e.g. AT URCs emitted wrongly in the MBIM port by
      some Cinterion modules).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 19 08:50:16 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

      . Support to detect already open MBIM channels on the Sierra

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 11 20:03:00 UTC 2016 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to version 1.14.0:
  + New support for the 'QMI over MBIM' service, so that clients
    can use libqmi to build messages and libmbim to transport them.
  + The GUDev library, which we use to read the max message size
    from the USB descriptor, is now optional. When configuring, it
    will be used by default only if it's found. It can also be
    explicitly disabled using the new configure  switch
    '--without-udev' or explicitly enabled using '--with-udev'.
    If GUDev isn't used, libmbim-glib will rely on sysfs directly.
  + libmbim-glib updates: Added support for building messages of
    custom services.
  + mbim-network updates:
    - Added support for loading profiles from different paths using
      the new '--profile' option. This makes it possible to use
      mbim-network with multiple devices running in the same
      system.
    - Added support to allow specifying APN user (APN_USER),
      password (APN_PASS) and authentication type (APN_AUTH) in the
      profile.
    - Added support to allow using the mbim-proxy setup by
      configuring it in the profile file (PROXY=yes).
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
  + The following features which were backported to 1.12.x releases
    are also present in libmbim 1.14.0:
    - mbimcli updates:
      . Updated '--connect' arguments to allow specifying
        "key=value" pairs. The old legacy
        "[(APN),(PAP|CHAP|MSCHAPV2),(Username),(Password)]" format
        is kept as valid for backwards compatibility, although it
        should be assumed deprecated.
      . Longer timeouts for connect/register operations.
      . Report IP configuration when connected.
      . Allow specifying session ids.
  + libmbim-glib updates: Probing retry interval increased to 5s.
 - Split out mbimcli-bash-completion package, requiring and
   supplementing bash-completion.
- Pass --with-udev to configure: new config parameter, but keeping
  the old behavior (it was non-optional before).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 15 02:09:53 CEST 2016 - hpj@suse.com

- Update to GNOME 3.20 -- Fate#318572.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 15:03:56 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.12.4:
  + Updated '--connect' arguments to allow specifying "key=value"
    pairs. The old legacy "[(APN), (PAP|CHAP|MSCHAPV2), (Username),
    (Password)]" format is kept as valid for backwards
    compatibility, although it should be assumed deprecated.
  + mbimcli:
    - Longer timeouts for connect/register operations.
    - Report IP configuration when connected.
    - Allow specifying session ids.
  + libmbim-glib: probing retry interval increased to 5s.
  + Some other minor fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  1 09:10:57 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.12.2:
  + Fix assertion triggered by a bug in the removal of unreleased
    transactions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 28 15:46:04 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.12.0:
  + New `--enable-mbim-username' option during configure, which
    allows specifying which will be the user owning the
    /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all MBIM modems (udev rules
    are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
    used, the mbim-proxy will only allow connections from processes
    running by the specified user or by the root user.
  + Function error messages can now be returned by the MbimDevice
    as responses to `Command', `Open' or `Close' messages. Users of
    the library should not assume the type of message returned to
    the previous actions.
  + The MbimProxy will monitor for 'NotOpened' errors, and when one
    detected it will directly close the internal MbimDevice. Any
    subsequent request sent by clients to that specific device will
    be aborted with a proxy-generated 'NotOpened' error. Clients
    will need to explicitly reopen the ports in that case.
  + The API now has a new mbim_message_response_get_result() method
    which allows getting a GError from a message which may be of a
    specific type (e.g. a `Command Done' message in response to a
    `Command' request) or instead the generic `Function Error'
    message type. Users of the library can use this new method to
    avoid assuming the type of message returned.
  + Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
    - Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
    - Fix bashisms in the mbim-network script.
- Drop libmbim-1.10.0-fix-bashisms.patch: fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 27 01:00:00 UTC 2014 - Led <ledest@gmail.com>

- Add libmbim-1.10.0-fix-bashisms.patch: fix bashisms in
  mbim-network script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 20 12:09:00 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.10.0:
  + API break: Flag values in 'MbimRegistrationFlag' were updated
    to match the ones in the MBIM documentation.
  + Implemented a new 'mbim-proxy', which allows sharing a single
    MBIM control port among different processes. The usage of the
    proxy is optional, and can be requested by specifying the
    MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_PROXY flag in the new
    mbim_device_open_full() method. The 'mbimcli' command line tool
    was also extended with a new '--device-open-proxy,-p' option,
    to allow requesting the use of the proxy process.
  + New 'removed' signal added to the MbimDevice, to notify when
    the underlying connection to the device is lost (e.g. lost
    connection to the mbim-proxy, or lost access to the MBIM
    control port).
  + Added support for registering and using custom services.
  + Added additional GMM cause codes to MbimNwError.
  + Transactions are now matched not only by ID but also by type.
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
- Changes from version 1.8.0:
  + Added support for additional MBIM messages:
    - MBIM_CID_MS_FIRMWARE_ID_GET
    - MBIM_CID_MS_HOST_SHUTDOWN_NOTIFY

    - --ms-query-firmware-id
    - --ms-notify-host-shutdown
    - --dss-connect
    - --dss-disconnect
  + Several enums and functions were renamed, and marked as
    deprecated. A small layer is given to provide backwards
    compatibility.
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
- Rename libmbim-glib0 subpackage to libmbim-glib4, following
  upstreams soname change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  2 14:41:50 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

    --phonebook-delete-all.
  + Added generation of man pages for mbimcli and mbim-network.
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
