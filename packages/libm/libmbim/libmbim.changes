Sat Apr  8 21:05:44 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.28.4:
  + libmbim-glib:
    - Fixed context type conversions to consider all possible APN
      types.
    - Duplicate UTF-16 strings during processing to avoid alignment
      issues.
- Changes from version 1.28.2:
  + libmbim-glib: fixed validation of complete fragments to avoid
    reading out of bounds.
  + mbim-proxy: added --verbose-full flag to allow printing logs
    with personal info included.
- Changes from version 1.28:
  + This version includes support for most operations in MBIM
    Extensions v2 (for 5G NSA) and v3 (for 5G SA). The enabling of
    the updated extensions requires the user of the library to
    explicitly request what version wants to be used, via the new
    'MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_MS_MBIMEX_V2' or
    'MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_MS_MBIMEX_V3' flags in the device open
    request. Please note that if one process enables the v2 or v3
    support, it will apply to operations done by other processes as
    well. When using the proxy, the current version support is
    propagated to all clients of the proxy automatically.
  + The verbose message logging will now by default hide all fields
    that are considered personal information. Extended message
    logging including all field contents should be explicitly
    requested.
  + Build:
    - The GNU autotools (autoconf/automake/libtool) support has
      been fully removed, this release requires the use of the
      meson build system.
    - The 'instrospection' meson option is now a boolean.
    - New boolean 'man' meson option to allow disabling the man
      page generation.
  + Extended the Basic Connect service, including the following
    operations:
    - MBIM_CID_BASIC_CONNECT_REGISTER_STATE (MBIMEx v2.0)

      will not be done if those macros are disabled during build.
    - New MBIM_DEVICE_CONSECUTIVE_TIMEOUTS signal in the MbimDevice
      to report the number of consecutive MBIM request timeouts
      detected.
    - New mbim_device_[get|set|check]_ms_mbimex_version() methods

Mon Jul 11 20:03:00 UTC 2016 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to version 1.14.0:
  + New support for the 'QMI over MBIM' service, so that clients
    can use libqmi to build messages and libmbim to transport them.
  + The GUDev library, which we use to read the max message size
    from the USB descriptor, is now optional. When configuring, it
    will be used by default only if it's found. It can also be
    explicitly disabled using the new configure  switch
    '--without-udev' or explicitly enabled using '--with-udev'.
    If GUDev isn't used, libmbim-glib will rely on sysfs directly.
  + libmbim-glib updates: Added support for building messages of
    custom services.
  + mbim-network updates:
    - Added support for loading profiles from different paths using
      the new '--profile' option. This makes it possible to use
      mbim-network with multiple devices running in the same
      system.
    - Added support to allow specifying APN user (APN_USER),
      password (APN_PASS) and authentication type (APN_AUTH) in the
      profile.
    - Added support to allow using the mbim-proxy setup by
      configuring it in the profile file (PROXY=yes).
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
  + The following features which were backported to 1.12.x releases
    are also present in libmbim 1.14.0:
    - mbimcli updates:
      . Updated '--connect' arguments to allow specifying
        "key=value" pairs. The old legacy
        "[(APN),(PAP|CHAP|MSCHAPV2),(Username),(Password)]" format
        is kept as valid for backwards compatibility, although it
        should be assumed deprecated.
      . Longer timeouts for connect/register operations.
      . Report IP configuration when connected.
      . Allow specifying session ids.
  + libmbim-glib updates: Probing retry interval increased to 5s.
 - Split out mbimcli-bash-completion package, requiring and
   supplementing bash-completion.
- Pass --with-udev to configure: new config parameter, but keeping
  the old behavior (it was non-optional before).

  + New `--enable-mbim-username' option during configure, which
    allows specifying which will be the user owning the
    /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all MBIM modems (udev rules
    are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
    used, the mbim-proxy will only allow connections from processes
    running by the specified user or by the root user.
  + Function error messages can now be returned by the MbimDevice
    as responses to `Command', `Open' or `Close' messages. Users of
    the library should not assume the type of message returned to
    the previous actions.
  + The MbimProxy will monitor for 'NotOpened' errors, and when one
    detected it will directly close the internal MbimDevice. Any
    subsequent request sent by clients to that specific device will
    be aborted with a proxy-generated 'NotOpened' error. Clients
    will need to explicitly reopen the ports in that case.
  + The API now has a new mbim_message_response_get_result() method
    which allows getting a GError from a message which may be of a
    specific type (e.g. a `Command Done' message in response to a
    `Command' request) or instead the generic `Function Error'
    message type. Users of the library can use this new method to
    avoid assuming the type of message returned.
  + Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
    - Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
    - Fix bashisms in the mbim-network script.
- Drop libmbim-1.10.0-fix-bashisms.patch: fixed upstream.

- Update to version 1.10.0:
  + API break: Flag values in 'MbimRegistrationFlag' were updated
    to match the ones in the MBIM documentation.
  + Implemented a new 'mbim-proxy', which allows sharing a single
    MBIM control port among different processes. The usage of the
    proxy is optional, and can be requested by specifying the
    MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_PROXY flag in the new
    mbim_device_open_full() method. The 'mbimcli' command line tool
    was also extended with a new '--device-open-proxy,-p' option,
    to allow requesting the use of the proxy process.
  + New 'removed' signal added to the MbimDevice, to notify when
    the underlying connection to the device is lost (e.g. lost
    connection to the mbim-proxy, or lost access to the MBIM
    control port).
  + Added support for registering and using custom services.
  + Added additional GMM cause codes to MbimNwError.
  + Transactions are now matched not only by ID but also by type.
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
- Changes from version 1.8.0:
  + Added support for additional MBIM messages:

    - --ms-query-firmware-id
    - --ms-notify-host-shutdown
    - --dss-connect
    - --dss-disconnect
  + Several enums and functions were renamed, and marked as
    deprecated. A small layer is given to provide backwards
    compatibility.
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
