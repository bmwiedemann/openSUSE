- update to 1.4.2:
  * negative array index for MMDB_*get_value specifies the last element
  * Fix a memory leak when using custom databases without languages
    defined in the metadata
  * mmdblookup now displays the prefix length for the record when
    using the verbose flag

- Update to version 1.3.2
  * Allocate memory for MMDB_entry_data_list_s structs in separate chunks
    rather than one large chunk. This simplifies accessing memory in
    MMDB_get_entry_data_list() and increases performance. It builds on the
    changes in 1.3.0 and 1.3.1.
  * We no longer export data_pool_* symbols. These are internal functions
    but we were previously exporting them. Pull request by Faidon Liambotis.
    gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#162.
  * Build with POSIX.1-2008 by default if the system supports it. This allows
    use of open() with O_CLOEXEC. We retain support for systems that
    provide only POSIX.1-2001.
    Open the database with the O_CLOEXEC flag if the system provides it.
  * This avoids cases where we could leak fds when called in multi-threaded
    programs that fork() and exec(). Original report and PR by Brandon L
    Black.
  * Added a test to ensure we export only intended symbols (e.g. MMDB_*).

- Update to version 1.3.1
  * Fix build problems related to rpl_malloc(). Pull request by Rainer
    Gerhards. gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb
  * Fix a race to set and read data in a field on the MMDB_s struct
    (ipv4_start_node). gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#153.
  * Fix cases of invalid memory access when using
    MMDB_get_entry_data_list(). This was introduced in 1.3.0 and occurred
    when performing large lookups. gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#153.

- Update to version 1.3.0
  * Perform fewer memory allocations in MMDB_get_entry_data_list(). This
    significantly improves its performance. gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#147.
  * Fix mmdblookup's build epoch reporting on some systems. Big endian
    systems with a 32-bit time_t no longer show a database build date of
    1970-01-01 00:00:00. Pull request by Rainer Jung. gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#143.

- Update to version 1.2.1
  * Use autoconf to check the system's endianness rather than trying to do this
    with compiler-defined macros like __BYTE_ORDER__. Apparently this didn't
    work properly on a Sparc system. gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#120.
  * Several compiler warnings on Visual C++ were fixed. Pull request by Marcel
    Raad. gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#130.
  * Fix segmentation faults found in MMDB_open() using afl-fuzz. This
    occurred on corrupt databases that had a data pointer large enough to
    cause an integer overflow when doing bound checking. Reported by Ryan
    Whitworth. gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#140.
  * Add --disable-tests option to configure. Pull request by Fabrice
    Fontaine. gh#maxmind/libmaxminddb#136.

- Update to version 1.2.0
  * Four additional fields were added to the end of the 
    MMDB_search_node_s struct returned by MMDB_read_node. These 
    fields allow the user to iterate through the search tree without
    making undocumented assumptions about how this library works 
    internally and without knowing the specific details of the database 
    format. GitHub #110 (https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/issues/110)
- Changes from version 1.1.5
  * Previously, reading a database with a pointer in the metadata would 
    cause an MMDB_INVALID_METADATA_ERROR to be returned. This was due to 
    an invalid offset being used when calculating the pointer. The 
    data_section and metadata_section fields now both point to the 
    beginning of the data section. Previously, data_section pointed 
    to the beginning of the data separator. This will not affect 
    anyone using only documented fields from MMDB_s.
  * MMDB_lookup_sockaddr will set mmdb_error to 
    MMDB_IPV6_LOOKUP_IN_IPV4_DATABASE_ERROR if an IPv6 sockaddr is 
    looked up in an IPv4-only database. Previously only 
    MMDB_lookup_string would set this error code.
  * When resolving an address, this library now relies on getaddrinfo 
    to determine the address family rather than trying to guess it itself.
- Changes from version 1.1.4
  * Packaging fixes. The 1.1.3 tarball release contained a lot of extra 
    junk in the t/ directory.
- Changes from version 1.1.3
  * Added several additional checks to make sure that we don't attempt to read
    past the end of the databases's data section. GitHub #103 
    (https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/pull/103).
  * When searching for the database metadata, there was a bug that caused 
    the code to think it had found valid metadata when none existed. In 
    addition, this could lead to an attempt to read past the end of the
    database entirely. Finally, if there are multiple metadata markers 
    in the database, we treat the final one as the start of the metdata, 
    instead of the first. GitHub #102 (https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/pull/102)
  * Don't attempt to mmap a file that is too large to be mmapped on the system. 
    GitHub #101 (https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/pull/101).
  * Added a missing out of memory check when reading a file's metadata. 
    GitHub #101 (https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/pull/101).
  * Added several additional checks to make sure that we never attempt 
    to malloc more than SIZE_MAX memory, which would lead to integer 
    overflow. This could only happen with pathological databases. 
    GitHub #101 (https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/pull/101).

- Update to version 1.1.2
  * IMPORTANT: This release includes a number of important security
    fixes. Among these fixes is improved validation of the database 
    metadata. Unfortunately, MaxMind GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases 
    created earlier than January 28, 2014, had an invalid data type 
    for the record_size in the metadata. Previously these databases 
    worked on little endian machines with libmaxminddb but did not 
    work on big endian machines. Due to increased safety checks when 
    reading the file, these databases will no longer work on any 
    platform. If you are using one of these databases, we recommend 
    that you upgrade to the latest GeoLite2 or GeoIP2 database
  * Added pkg-config support.
  * Several segmentation faults found with afl-fuzz were fixed. These
    were caused by missing bounds checking and missing verification 
    of data type.
    MMDB_get_entry_data_list will now fail on data structures with a 
    depth greater than 512 and data structures that are cyclic. This 
    should not affect any known MaxMind DB in production. All databases
    produced by MaxMind have a depth of less than five.
- Add a build dependency to pkg-config

Sun Jul 26 13:48:17 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.1.1
  * Added `maxminddb-compat-util.h` as a source file to dist.
- Changes from version 1.1.0
  * Previously, when there was an error in `MMDB_open()`, `errno` would
    generally be overwritten during cleanup, preventing a useful value from
    being returned to the caller. This was changed so that the `errno` value
    from the function call that caused the error is restored before returning to
    the caller. In particular, this is important for `MMDB_IO_ERROR` errors as
    checking `errno` is often the only way to determine what actually failed.
  * If `mmap()` fails due to running out of memory space, an
    `MMDB_OUT_OF_MEMORY_ERROR` is now returned from `MMDB_open` rather than an
    `MMDB_IO_ERROR`.
  * On Windows, the `CreateFileMappingA()` handle was not properly closed if
    opening the database succeeded. Fixed by Bly Hostetler. GitHub #75 & #76.
  * On Windows, we were not checking the return value of `CreateFileMappingA()`
    properly for errors. Fixed by Bly Hotetler. GitHub #78.
  * Several warnings from Clang's scan-build were fixed. GitHub #86.
  * All headers are now installed in `$(includedir)`. GitHub #89.
  * We no longer install `maxminddb-compat-util.h`. This header was intended for
    internal use only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 21 14:03:32 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.0.4
  * If you used a non-integer string as an array index when doing a
    lookup with MMDB_get_value, MMDB_vget_value, or MMDB_aget_value,
    the first element of the array would be returned rather than an 
    error. A MMDB_LOOKUP_PATH_DOES_NOT_MATCH_DATA_ERROR error will 
    now be returned. GitHub #61.
  * If a number larger than LONG_MAX was used in the same functions,
    LONG_MAX would have been used in the lookup. Now a
    MMDB_INVALID_LOOKUP_PATH_ERROR error will be returned.
  * Visual Studio build files were added for unit tests and some 
    compatibility issues with the tests were fixed.
  * Visual Studio project was updated to use property pages. GitHub #69.
  * A test failure in t/compile_c++_t.pl on new installs was fixed.
