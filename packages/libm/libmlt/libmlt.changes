Mon Jul 25 11:28:39 UTC 2016 - olaf@aepfle.de

- Build with ffmpeg unconditional

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 21 10:15:52 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 6.2.0:
  + There are no framework changes in this release. The major
    announcement is the introduction of support for libavfilter!
    This is still a work-in-progress. It is limited to FFmpeg 2.3
    and up, and there are a number of filters that are black-listed
    because they are known to not integrate with MLT, which is not
    a full libav* environment or simple wrapper for it. There are
    likey avfilters that are not yet black-listed but might not
    work because they have not been completely tested. Also, they
    do not support MLT's keyframable property animation nor its
    frame-threaded parallelism due to architectural or integration
    limitations. However, some avfilters are slice-threaded
    (internal parallelism), and that works. Finally, libavfilter
    filtergraph syntax is not supported either.
    All of the supported libavfilters are exposed as MLT filters
    beginning with the prefix "avfilter." All of the avfilter
    parameters are exposed as MLT properties with the "av." prefix
    to prevent clashes with MLT properties. You can run `melt
    -query filters` to see the new avfilters, and `melt -query
    filter=avfilter.rotate`, for example, to view generated
    documentation for an individual filter.
  + Notable fixes and enhancements in this release:
    - Added support for libavfilter to avformat module.
    - Added auto-rotate support to avformat producer.
    - Added animated GIF preset for avformat consumer.
    - Prevent serializing and deserializing mlt_type property to
      xml module.
    - Fixed relative paths for WebVfx "plain:" resources in xml
      module.
    - Updated libebur128 to v1.1.0 in plus module.
    - Added dynamic_loudness filter to plus module.
    - Added loudness_meter filter to plus module.
    - Qt 5 fixes for kdenlivetitle producer.
    - Added gradients and text shadows to kdenlivetitle producer.
    - Added support for building rtaudio against external build of
      lib.
    - Upgraded bundled RtAudio to v4.1.2.
    - Added status parameters to ladspa producer and filters.
    - dded 5.1 surround to stereo downmix to audiochannels filter
      in core module.
    - Fixed compiling SWIG bindings for Ruby 2.0.
- Changes from version 6.0.0:
  + This is a bugfix and minor enhancement release. Note that our
    release versioning scheme has changed. We were approaching 1.0
    but decided to synchronize release version with the C library
    ABI version, which is currently at v6. Here are some of the
