Mon Feb 24 06:49:00 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.5.1:
  * mypaint-brush.c:count_dabs_to calculation changed to be
    consistent with v1.3.0 / 1.4.0 when called via the old stroke
    interface, and generally fixed so that there's no need for an
    additional initial mypaint_brush_stroke_to call to produce a
    visible stroke.
  * mypaint-brush.c: estimation of dabs per pixel reverted to the
    old calculation when called via the old stroke interface.
  * Fixes incorrect versions for the requirements in the
    libmypaint-gegl pkg-config file (for both gegl and libmypaint)
  * The openmp flags are now actually used when building with
    --enable-openmp
  * Translation updates.
- Drop libmypaint-gegl-pkgconfig.patch: incorporated upstream.
- Compile with openmp support by passing `--enable-openmp` to
  configure.
- Build introspection bindings:
  * Add BuildRequires pkgconfig(gobject-introspection-1.0) and
    pkgconfig(glib-2.0).
  * Split out new packages for introspection bindings:
    typelib-1_0-MyPaint-1_5 and typelib-1_0-MyPaintGegl-1_5.

  * view zoom & view rotation.
  * spectral color blending (pigment mode).
  * new smudge settings: length multiplier, buckets, transparency.
  * new symmetry modes: vertical, vertical+horizontal, rotational,
    snowflake.
  * adjustable angle for symmetry modes.
  * optional multiple output rectangles (only relevant w. new
    symmetry modes).
  * Directional offsets are clamped to a maximum distance of 3 *
    1080 pixels.
- Drop libmypaint-gegl-0.4.14.patch: fixed upstream.
- Drop libmypaint-gegl-shlib-version.patch: incorporated upstream.
- Drop libmypaint-bump-gegl-version.patch: only applicable hunk
  moved to libmypaint-gegl-pkgconfig.patch; rest incorporated
  upstream.
- Add libmypaint-gegl-pkgconfig.patch: In libmypaint-gegl.pc,
  change Name to libmypaint-gegl to avoid conflict with
  libmypaint.pc and Requires to depend on the correct version of
  gegl and on libmypaint - not
  libmypaint-@LIBMYPAINT_API_PLATFORM_VERSION@.
- No longer needed to run autoreconf/autogen.sh before configure
  since patches that modified build files are dropped; also drop
  libtool BuildRequires required only for autoreconf.
- Use autosetup to apply existing patch.
- Bump so version in keeping with upstream (1_5-1).
- Move libmypaint-gegl.pc file to libmypaint-gegl-devel package.
