- Update to version 1.5.1:
  * mypaint-brush.c:count_dabs_to calculation changed to be
    consistent with v1.3.0 / 1.4.0 when called via the old stroke
    interface, and generally fixed so that there's no need for an
    additional initial mypaint_brush_stroke_to call to produce a
    visible stroke.
  * mypaint-brush.c: estimation of dabs per pixel reverted to the
    old calculation when called via the old stroke interface.
  * Fixes incorrect versions for the requirements in the
    libmypaint-gegl pkg-config file (for both gegl and libmypaint)
  * The openmp flags are now actually used when building with
    --enable-openmp
  * Translation updates.
- Drop libmypaint-gegl-pkgconfig.patch: incorporated upstream.
- Compile with openmp support by passing `--enable-openmp` to
  configure.
- Build introspection bindings:
  * Add BuildRequires pkgconfig(gobject-introspection-1.0) and
    pkgconfig(glib-2.0).
  * Split out new packages for introspection bindings:
    typelib-1_0-MyPaint-1_5 and typelib-1_0-MyPaintGegl-1_5.

  change Name to libmypaint-gegl to avoid conflict with

  gegl and on libmypaint - not
  libmypaint-@LIBMYPAINT_API_PLATFORM_VERSION@.
- No longer needed to run autoreconf/autogen.sh before configure
  since patches that modified build files are dropped; also drop
  libtool BuildRequires required only for autoreconf.
