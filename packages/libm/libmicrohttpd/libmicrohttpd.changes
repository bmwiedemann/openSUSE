Mon Dec 20 19:41:33 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- libmicrohttpd 0.9.74:
  * new experimental implementation of WebSockets disabled by default
  * improved compliance with the RFC HTTP specifications
  * new implementation of reply header forming
  * new implementation of request chunked encoding parsing
  * new automatic error replies
  * Keep-alive header is omitted by default for HTTP/1.1 connections.
    Use of header can be enforced by response flag.
  * Chunked encoding is used for HTTP/1.1 non-keep-alive connections
    for responses with unknown size. Previously MHD used "indication
    of the end of the response by closing connection" in such cases,
    however it is not correct for HTTP/1.1 connections as per HTTP
    RFC.
  * As required by HTTP RFC, use HTTP/1.1 version instead of HTTP/1.0
    in reply headers when client is HTTP/1.0 . HTTP/1.0 version can
    be enforced by response flag.
  * User response headers are used in replies in the same order as
    was added by application.
  * Allowed tab characters in response header values.
  * All custom "Connection:" response headers are automatically
    combined into single "Connection:" header.
  * "keep-alive" token silently dropped from custom "Connection:"
    response header. "Keep-alive" cannot be enforced and used
    automatically if possible.
  * Allow tab character in custom response header value.
  * Disallow space character in custom response header value.
  * Do not allow responses with 1xx codes for HTTP/1.0 requests.
  * Detected and reported incorrect "Upgrade" responses.

- Update to versin 0.9.65:
  * Many fixes and improvements for connection-specific memory pool
  * Better handled connection's memory shortage situations:
    + error response could be sent to client even if all buffer
      space was used;
    + if buffer space become low when receiving, do not allocate
      last buffer space and use small receive blocks instead.

		with 2000 connections instead of 64.
  * Better handled redefenition of FD_SETSIZE on all platforms.
  * Close sockets more aggressively in multi-threaded mode 
		(possibly relevant for idle servers).

		improved support for old clang and new GCC. -EG
  * Return correct header kind in MHD_get_connection_values()
    even if a bitmask is used for the "kind" argument. -FC/CG
  * Fixing transient resource leak affecting long-lived
    connections with many keep-alives and HTTP request
    pipelining under certain circumstances (which reduced
    the receive window).

    Fixed many compiler warning (mostly for VC compiler). -EG
  * Fix failure to properly clean up timed out connections
    if running in external select mode without listen socket,
    which caused busy waiting until new connections arrived.
    (Fixes #3924, thanks to slimp for reporting and testcase). -CG
  * Ignore close() errors on sockets except for EBADF,
    fixes #3926. -CG
  * Make sure to decrement connection counter before
    calling connection notifier so that
    MHD_DAEMON_INFO_CURRENT_CONNECTIONS does not
    present stale information (relevant if this is
    used for termination detection of a daemon
    stopped via MHD_quiesce_daemon()). Thanks to
    Markus Doppelbauer for reporting. -CG

    Testcase added as well. -CG

  - Update HTTPS testcases to avoid SSLv3, as SSLv3 is dead.

  - Do not enforce FD_SETSIZE-limit on worker control
    pipe when using MHD_USE_EPOLL_LINUX_ONLY (#3751). -MH/CG

  - Adding MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_CONNECTION,
    MHD_CONNECTION_NOTIFY_STARTED,
    MHD_CONNECTION_NOTIFY_CLOSED and
    MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_SOCKET_CONTEXT to allow
    applications to trigger operations when TCP
    connections start or end, instead of just
    exposing HTTP requests starting and ending. -RG/CG

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 21 06:44:06 UTC 2014 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version bump to 0.9.34:
  * Drop tls patch seems to build fine
  * Remove code for other distros we build against 13.1+ anywhere
    within obs and it just clutters the spec.
  * Explicitely name switches in configure to make sure things go
    the desired way.
  * Fix install of libmicrohttpspdy pc file.
  + Added support for TCP FASTOPEN.
  + Removed dependency on plibc for simpler compilation for W32.
  + Added configure option "--disable-pipes" to use socketpairs
    instead of pipes for signalling to child threads. Pipes are
    always disabled on W32.
  + Corrected some uses of 'int' vs. 'size_t'.
  + MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK in libmicrohttpd currently just *inhibits
    setting* the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option, but per Microsoft's
    documentation the default on Windows is that this is enabled, thus
    MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK will not work (since it leaves the
    default). libmicrohttpd should probably just unconditionally set
    IPV6_V6ONLY to the desired value when the option is available.
  + Allow Keep-Alive with HTTP 1.0 (if explicitly requested),
    and automatically set "Connection: Keep-Alive" in response
    in this case as well.
  + Adding explicit annotations to hide symbols that are not for
    export in the C code (gcc 4.0 or higher only).
  + Adding a few lines to avoid warnings from picky compilers.

- Added patches:
  * libmicrohttpd-0.9.34-spdy-pc.patch
- Dropped patches:
  * libmicrohttpd-drop-test_tls_options.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- refresh libmicrohttpd-drop-test_tls_options.patch
  - add there also ignoring test_https_sni
- Update to 0.9.33 bsc#854443 CVE-2013-7038 CVE-2013-7039
  + Fixed an issue with a missing argument in the postexample.
  + Fixed issue with bogus offset increment involving sendfile on
    GNU/Linux.  Adding support for SNI.
  + Fix for per-worker daemon pipes enabled with
    MHD_USE_SUSPEND_RESUME that were not closed in MHD_stop_daemon.
  + Fixing warnings and build issue if --disable-https is given to
    configure.
  +
  0.9.32:
  + Security fix: do not read past 0-terminator when unescaping
    strings (thanks to Florian Weimer for reporting).
  + Signaling n times for shutdown works, but for resume we need to
    wake up the correct daemon. Even if we signal n times in
    that case also, there's no guarantee that some daemon can't
    run through its select loop more than once before the
    daemon we want to wake up gets a chance to read.  Thus we
    need a signal pipe per thread in the thread pool IF
    MHD_suspend_connection is used.  This introduces a new flag
    MHD_USE_SUSPEND_RESUME to add those additional pipes and
    only allow MHD_suspend_connection to be used in conjunction
    with this flag.

    Also, as MHD_resume_connection() will be called on a
    non-daemon thread, but none of the queue insert/delete
    calls are thread safe, we need to be concerned about (a)
    corrupting the queue, and (b) having to add mutex
    protection around every access to the queues, including
    loops through timer queues, etc. This wasn't a problem
    before adding resume; even suspend should be safe since it
    happens in a callback from the daemon.

    I think it's easier to (a) have MHD_suspend_connection() move
    the connection to a suspended queue, (b) have
    MHD_resume_connection() mark the connection as resuming,
    and then (c) do all the actual queue manipulations in
    MHD_select (poll, epoll, etc.) to move the resumed
    connections back to their normal queues, in response to the
    wake up. The changes are simpler & cleaner. There is a cost
    to the basic select loop that is avoided by making
    suspend/resume a startup option. The per-worker pipes can
    then also be enabled only with that option set.
  + Eliminating theoretical stack overflow by limiting length
    of URIs in authentication headers to 32k (only applicable
    if the application explicitly raised the memroy limits,
    and only applies to MHD_digest_auth_check). Issue was
    reported by Florian Weimer.
  + Fix race on shutdown signal with thread pool on non-Linux
    systems by signalling n times for n threads.
  + Introduce state to mark connections in suspended state (with
    epoll); add missing locking operations in MHD_suspend_connection.
  + Fix definition of MHD_TLS_CONNECTION_INIT.
  + Fixing issue in PostProcessor when getting partial boundary
    at the beginning, expanding test suite.
  + Implementing faster processing of upload data in multipart
    encoding (thanks to performance analysis by Adam Homolya).
  + Adding support for connection flow control via
    MHD_suspend_connection and MHD_resume_connection.
  0.9.31:
  + Fixing build issues on OS X with CLOCK_MONOTONIC not being
    implemented on OS X.
  + Make libmicrohttpd play nicely with upcoming libgcrypt 1.6.0.
  + Improved configure checks for cURL.
  + Signal connection termination as OK (and not as ERROR) if the
    stream was terminated by the callback returning
    MHD_CONTENT_READER_END_OF_STREAM. Also, release response
    mutex before calling the termination callback, to avoid
    possible deadlock if the client destroys the response in
    the termination callback (due to non-recursiveness of the
    lock).
  + Adding #define MHD_HTTP_HEADER_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN.
  + Also pass MHD connection handle in URI log callback.
  + Improved check for proper OpenSSL version for
    libmicrospdy.
  + Set IPV6_V6ONLY socket option correctly when IPv6 is
    enabled (MHD_USE_IPv6) but not dual stack
    (MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK)

Thu Oct  3 12:59:19 UTC 2013 - mvyskocil@suse.com

- Update to 0.9.30
  + implements the "SHOULD" clause of RFC 2616 section 8.1.4, which
    may reduce bandwidth consumption when clients cancel requests.
  + fixes build errors with various combinations of operating systems,
    libc versions, and configure flags.
  + fixes a use-after-free crash when using epoll() in combination with
     read errors
  0.9.29:
  + epoll can now also be used with SSL connections
  + following recent HTTP/1.1 clarfications, MHD no longer send
    a "Content-length" header in CONNECT responses.
  + the "MHD_add_connection" call now consistently sets an "errno"
    value to indicate the cause of errors.
    Connections added this way are now always processed immediately.
  + fixes a recently-introduced bug which prevented HTTP pipelining
    from working properly in some cases and a build error in
    conjunction with the "--disable-messages" configure option.
- Enable build of (experimental) SPDY support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 24 10:18:44 UTC 2013 - mvyskocil@suse.com

- Update to 0.9.28
  + support for epoll-based event loops (Linux-only)
  + various new options:
    - MHD_USE_DUAL_STACK for binding to IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time
    - MHD_USE_PIPE_FOR_SHUTDOWN to cleanly support MHD_quiesce_daemon on
      non-Linux systems
    - MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CONNECTION_FD to allow COMET applications to
      disable TCP Nagle
    - MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_INCREMENT for better control over
      buffer size allocations
  + and fixes various minor bugs

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 16 07:42:59 UTC 2013 - mvyskocil@suse.com

- Update to 0.9.27
  + performance improvements for POST processing
  + new API call to reduce the number of select calls (if in "external"
    select mode)
  + new function to allow applications to stop MHD from processing new
    incoming connections while finishing ongoing requests
  + fixes an initialization problem on some platforms
  + fixes bug in the postprocessor's URL parser.
  + SSL connections are no longer dropped if the system uptime is less
    than the connection timeout
  + allows creating responses with zero bytes using
    MHD_create_response_from_callback.
  + few "const" statements have been added to allow keeping more static
    strings in ROM.
  + post processor now tolerates uploads which don't contain "\r\n" and
    also returns keys which don't have a matching value
  + fixes the loss of a parameter in processing POST data from IE8 and
    Chrome. It automatically sets a "Connection: close" header if the
    client requests the connection to be closed. Finally, given both
    'chunked' encoding and 'content-length', MHD now ignores the
    'content-length' header as per the RFC
  + adds support for building libmicrohttpd for Android
  + fixes an issue with data in TLS buffers sometimes not being completely
    drained if there was no activity on the socket.
