This subpacke provides useful programs that make use of libmspack.
 * cabd_memory - An implementation of the mspack_system interface using
                 only memory
 * cabrip      - Extracts any CAB files embedded in another file.
 * chmextract  - Extracts all files in a CHM file to disk.
 * msexpand    - Expands an SZDD or KWAJ file.
 * multifh     - An implementation of the mspack_system interface which
                 can access many things: regular disk files, already
                 opened stdio FILE*  file pointers, open file
                 descriptors, blocks of memory
 * oabextract  - Extracts an Exchange Offline Address Book (.LZX) file.
