    <comment>- Trim filler wording from descriptions. Set proper RPM groups,
  and noarch status for doc subpackage.
- Drop silly glibc PreReq.
- Upgrade to libmaa-1.4.2:
  * Fix build failure on SunOS-5.11 (alloca)
  * License has been changed from LGPL to MIT, permitted by Rik
    Faith, original author of this library.
  * Build system changed from autotools to mk-configure.
  * Library version/soname was bumped from 3 to 4. I cannot
    guarantee that mk-configure and libtool build shared library
    the same way.
  * Tests were added for stk_*, mem_* and prm_* functions.
  * stk_isempty function was added.
  * stk_* and other was reimplemented without obstack functions
    (glibc extension).
- Add 02-Spelling-typos.patch and 03-Fix-gcc-8-ftbfs.patch from Debian
  package.
- initial package
