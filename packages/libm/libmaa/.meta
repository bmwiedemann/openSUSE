  <title>Library providing many low-level data structures</title>
  <description>The libmaa library provides many low-level data structures which are helpful for writing compilers, including hash tables, sets, lists, debugging support, and memory management. Although libmaa was designed and implemented as a foundation for the kheperalong, the data structures are generally applicable to a wide range of programming problems.

The memory management routines are especially helpful for improving the performance of memory-intensive applications.</description>
