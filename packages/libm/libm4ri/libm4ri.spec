M4RI is a library for arithmetic with dense matrices over the
Galois Field GF(2).

This subpackage contains libraries and header files for developing
applications that want to make use of libm4ri.

#
# 1. Need to disable SSE for %%ix86. Since --disable-sse2 translates to the
# absence of -msse rather than the inclusion of -mno-sse, we do not need
# to guard it with %%if(n)arch.
#
# 2. Set cache size manually, because, otherwise, it will pick whatever the
# build host had, which is dumb. 32K:128K matches AMD T-Bred, and is also
# fitting within Core i7-2600. Let's hope that's ok.
