  0.7.79 --> 0.7.80
  * Visual Basic binding: StreamKind.Visual changed to 
    StreamKind.Video for more coherency with other bindings 
    (StreamKind.Visual is still available but it is deprecated)

    field

  * MXF: writing library and writing application fields are 
    cleaned up, you may face some incompatibility or different 
    values
  * AVC and HEVC: Level x.0 are replaced by Level x, because 
    specs have no .0
  0.7.71 --> 0.7.72
  * EBUCore 1.5 output is slighly modified, check the 
    compatibility with your workflow

    quantization bits not same as stored bit depth, Stored bit 
    depth has moved from "BitDepth" to "BitDepth_Stored". 
    "BitDepth is the quantization bits value.
