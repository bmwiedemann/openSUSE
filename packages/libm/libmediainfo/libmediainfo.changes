  * URL: "URLEncode" option for saying if the input should be 
    URL encoded or not (default is guess = no change except if 
    it contains spaces)
  * MediaTrace: for bitstreams (not bytestreams), bit offset 
    was wrong
  * HLS: duration was sometimes wrong, reading only the first 
    TS file duration. Now full duration is displayed
  * MPEG-TS: if stream is encrypted or invalid, level was 
    sometimes not the expected one for AVC (e.g. "BaseLine@3.0" 
    instead of "Baseline@3")
  * Matroska: FFV1 stream width/height was not initialized 
    when Matroska track header width/height is after CodecID
  * FFV1: fix potential crash with some buggy slice headers
  * Matroska: crash in case of big attachment and CRC32 present

- Update to version 0.7.92.1
  * Fix a performance regression in the matroska parser
  version 0.7.92
  New features:
  * #F507, MXF: detection of HLG Transfer Characteristic
  * #F508, HEVC: support of preferred_transfer_characteristics 
    SEI (from HEVC/H.265 draft, preferred method for HLG in DVB)
  * MXF: parsing of AVC descriptors and crosscheck with the 
    essence content
  * MP4: more AppleStoreCountry values mapped to countries, 
    show the country number if unknown
  * File extension: test if the file extension correspond to 
    the container format
  * AVI/WAV: test of truncated file
  * MIXML output: Format_Profile divided in Format_Profile, 
    Format_Level, Format_Tier
  * ID3v2: TCAP tag is mapped to new field "PodcastCategory"
  Bug fixes:
  * MIXML output: some *_Original values were missing
  * MXF/Teletext: was not correctly detecting non subtitle 
    streams
  * ID3v2: TP2 tag was incorrectly mapped to "Accompaniment", 
    now mapped to "Album_Performer"
  * ID3v2: TSO2 tag was incorrectly mapped to 
    "Performer_Sort", now mapped to "Album_Performer_Sort"
  * ID3v2: TCMP tag was displayed twice (2 "Compilation" lines)
  version 0.7.91
  New features:
  * IMF and PTX: more languages detected from file names (but 
    the full list of common languages tags still need to be 
    added)
  * IMF and PTX: support of non-standard but common "LAS" = 
    "Spanish (Latin America)" language code
  * MXF: Support of color primaries, transfer characteristic, 
    coding equations defined in SMPTE ST 2067-21:2016 e.g. xvYCC 
    or BT.2020
  * Minor performance optimizations and cleanup (Thanks to 
    Pavel Pimenov)
  * MediaTrace optimization for Matroska
  Bug fixes:
  * Fixed parsing of FFV1 v0/v1
  * PTX: fix crash due to bad parsing of some file names while 
    looking for track language
  version 0.7.90
  New features:
  * #M94, WAV: support of file with a buggy RIFF header
  * Matroska: detection of segment size of zero (compatibility 
    risks e.g. Windows 10 Media Player does not play such file)
  * MXF: detection of some incoherences between header and 
    footer
  * MXF: display of Locked information
  * N19/STL: support of 48/50/60 fps content
  * N19/STL: display of time code of first frame
  * AC-3: bit depth
  * MPEG Video: CBR bitrate mode information based on vbv_delay
  * DXW: support of fake time code attribute
  Bug fixes:
  * Teletext in MPEG-TS: CodecID, format (classic teletext or 
    subtitle), video delay were sometimes not displayed
  * PDF: fixed crash with some files with full analysis set
  * #B485, BMP height is negative
  * Several minor fixes

- Converted libmediainfo.changes to unix format

- Set correct license

Thu Oct  6 18:34:28 UTC 2016 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 0.7.89
  * I changed some elements in the interface.
    No break in binary compatibily (no crash), but some 
    details.
  0.7.79 --> 0.7.80
  * Visual Basic binding: StreamKind.Visual changed to 
    StreamKind.Video for more coherency with other bindings 
    (StreamKind.Visual is still available but it is deprecated)
  0.7.73 --> 0.7.74
  * EBUCore: Source/Material moved from timecodeStart to 
  timecodeTrack
  * AES3: generic term AES3 replaced by more precise SMPTE 
    ST numbers (302, 331, 337)
  0.7.72 --> 0.7.73
  * Clean aperture size is move from width/height to its own 
    field
  * HEVC: format_Profile field changed from Profile@Level to 
    Profile@Level@Tier
  * MXF: writing library and writing application fields are 
    cleaned up, you may face some incompatibility or different 
    values
  * AVC and HEVC: Level x.0 are replaced by Level x, because 
    specs have no .0
  0.7.71 --> 0.7.72
  * EBUCore 1.5 output is slighly modified, check the 
    compatibility with your workflow
  * PBCore2: codecid changed
  0.7.70 --> 0.7.71
  * Time code striped/not striped information is moved from 
    "Format_Settings" to "TimeCode_Striped"
  0.7.69 --> 0.7.70
  * BitDepth: for very rare MXF containing PCM having 
    quantization bits not same as stored bit depth, Stored bit 
    depth has moved from "BitDepth" to "BitDepth_Stored". 
    "BitDepth is the quantization bits value.

- Spec cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 27 20:28:17 UTC 2014 - i@margueirte.su

  * "Intermediate Codec" is renamed to "AIC" (Apple Intermediate Codec)
  * MPEG-TS: Menu stream, KLVA_PID and SCTE35_PID removed and formats are in "Format" field
  * DTS: moved DTS endianess and word size

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  4 00:17:53 UTC 2012 - i@marguerite.su

- update to 0.7.60
  * MPEG-TS/PS: improved detection of buggy time stamps
  * DPX: color primaries and transfer characteristics

  * MPEG-TS: Name of some scrambling algorithms
  * MPEG-TS: detection of CBR/VBR at container level
  * MPEG Video: better detection of variable GOP
  * MPEG-TS: average, minimum, maximum PCR distance (hidden by default and you must parse the whole file with --ParseSpeed=1 option)
  * Matroska: some streams were wrongly detected sa VFR
  * #3538378, XML output: invalid characters, now if there is an invalid character, data is transported in base64
  * LXF: wrong video bit rate with some files
  * AC-3/E-AC-3: hang up with some Little Endian streams
  * AAC: wrong min and max bit rate in case of partial (default) parsing, disabling it
