[xine-devel] Library for mms protocol support
From: Mathrick <mnews2@wp...> - 2003-12-26 21:04
This was already sent once, but got swallowed waiting for moderator's approval:

(CC'ing gstreamer-devel)

Hi guys,
I want to propose development of library for mms protocol support. Right
now, each and every project that wants to support mms is required to
implement all of SDP specs itself, due to lack of common library for
that. To remedy that, I'd like to start project aimed at providing such
a library. The benefits are as usual from using lib:

- no code duplication
- larger userbase, more extensive testing
- possible larger developer base
- better feature parity between projects
- single fix benefits all users
etc.

Availability of such library would also benefit other projects, that may
want to support mms, but cannot currently afford developing yet another
proprietary implementation, like GStreamer or GnomeVFS, and possibly
others.
Technically, such a lib would be required to have been LGPL'd, because
both GStreamer and Gnome projects are LGPL.
It would be the coolest to turn existing xine implementation into
library, as it is pretty good one, and also largely independent from
xine itself, but I'm aware of your code being GPL, and that you may not
want or be able to relicense it as LGPL. Thus, just your cooperation and
support will be of great value.
I'd like to discuss available possibilities for few days, and then open
SF project in about a week or two. Unfortunately, I have finals coming
in late January, that may severly limit amount of my free time, but I'll
do my best. I look forward to your comments.

Cheers,
Maciej

Sounds like a good idea to me.

I guess you would have to write all people who committed changes to
input_mms.c and ask for their permission. Fortunately, these are not
too many.

OK, but copyright info contains "xine project" only. Will webcvs be
enough to get all the contributors?

Heh, is there any way to contact him? He seems to be some sort of
nameless hero, and that may complicate matters.

I will send mails asking about relicensing to everyone found on CVS log,
and also to the list, in case they don't read their sf mail accounts :).
