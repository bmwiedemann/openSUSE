  <title>Make binary data human-readable</title>
  <description>'Data::Hexdumper' provides a simple way to format arbitrary binary data
into a nice human-readable format, somewhat similar to the Unix 'hexdump'
utility.

It gives the programmer a considerable degree of flexibility in how the
data is formatted, with sensible defaults. It is envisaged that it will
primarily be of use for those wrestling alligators in the swamp of binary
file formats, which is why it was written in the first place.</description>
