# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the
# best way is to create a file "/etc/systemd/system/pgagent-10.service",
# containing
#	.include /lib/systemd/system/pgagent-10.service
#	...make your changes here...

# configuration as well.
