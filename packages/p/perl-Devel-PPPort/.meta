  <title>Perl/Pollution/Portability</title>
  <description>Perl's API has changed over time, gaining new features, new functions,
increasing its flexibility, and reducing the impact on the C namespace
environment (reduced pollution). The header file written by this module,
typically ppport.h, attempts to bring some of the newer Perl API features to
older versions of Perl, so that you can worry less about keeping track of old
releases, but users can still reap the benefit.

Devel::PPPort contains a single function, called WriteFile. Its only purpose is
to write the ppport.h C header file. This file contains a series of macros and,
if explicitly requested, functions that allow XS modules to be built using
older versions of Perl. Currently, Perl versions from 5.003 to 5.10.0 are
supported.

This module is used by h2xs to write the file ppport.h.
