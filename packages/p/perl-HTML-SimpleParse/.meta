  <title>a bare-bones HTML parser</title>
  <description>This is the HTML::SimpleParse module.  It is a bare-bones HTML parser,
similar to HTML::Parser, but with a couple important distinctions:

First, HTML::Parser knows which tags can contain other tags, which
start tags have corresponding end tags, which tags can exist only in
the &lt;HEAD&gt; portion of the document, and so forth.  HTML::SimpleParse
does not know any of these things.  It just finds tags and text in the
HTML you give it, it does not care about the specific content of these
tags (though it does distiguish between different _types_ of tags, such
as comments, starting tags like &lt;b&gt;, ending tags like &lt;/b&gt;, and so on).

Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML
content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any
attention to balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which
pairs of tags are inside other pairs of tags.

Because of these characteristics, you can make a very effective HTML
filter by sub-classing HTML::SimpleParse.</description>
