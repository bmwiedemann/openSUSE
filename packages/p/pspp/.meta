  <description>PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. It
is a free replacement for the proprietary program SPSS.
 
PSPP development is ongoing. It already supports a large subset of
SPSS's syntax. Its statistical procedure support is currently
limited, but growing. At your option, PSPP will produce statistical
reports in ASCII, PostScript, PDF, HTML, SVG, or OpenDocument formats.</description>
