-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 22 08:41:49 UTC 2023 - Klaus Kämpf <kkaempf@suse.com>

- Update to 1.6.2
  * Previously, numeric variables defaulted to "scale" measurement
    level.  Now, the default is "unknown", with a better guess chosen
    based on heuristics the first time the data is read.

  * Bug fixes.

- Update to 1.6.1
  * The SET command now supports LEADZERO for controlling output of a
    leading zero in F, COMMA, and DOT format.

  * Bug fixes and translation updates.

- Update to 1.6.0
  * In the Kruskal-Wallis test, a misleading result could occur
    if the lower bound specified by the user was in fact higher
    than the upper bound specified.  This has been fixed.

  * The DEFINE, MATRIX, MCONVERT, and MATRIX DATA commands are now
    implemented.

  * An error in the displayed signficance of oneway anova
    contrasts tests has been corrected.

  * Added Drag-N-Drop in output view.

  * The Explore GUI dialog supports the "Plots" subdialog. Boxplots,
    Q-Q Plots and Spreadlevel plots are now also available via the GUI.

  * The graphical user interface for importing spreadsheets has been
    improved.
    The new interface provides the user with a preview of the data to
    be imported and interactive methods to select the desired ranges.

  * The user manual, in its Info and HTML versions, now includes
    graphical output examples and screenshots.

  * New command SHOW SYSTEM to easily print system information useful
    in bug reports.

  * Output improvements:
    - New drivers for output to TeX source files and to PNG files.
    - Table output styles may now be set with the new option
      --table-look and the new SET TLOOK command.
    - New driver option "trim" to remove empty space from PDF,
      PostScript, SVG, and PNG output files.
    - The PDF output driver now adds an outline to allow PDF viewers
      to display as a "table of contents" for the file.
    - The HTML output driver has a new option "bare".

  * New features in pspp-output:
    - New --table-look and --nth-commands options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  6 10:27:00 UTC 2020 - opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com

- Update to PSPP 1.4.1:
  * Bug fixes.
  * Translation updates.
  * HTML output is now HTML5 instead of HTML4.0 Transitional.

- Split -lang package.
- Add documentation packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 20 19:31:33 UTC 2020 - opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com

- Update to PSPP 1.4.0:
  * The file pspp-mode.el (the pspp-mode for Emacs) is no longer 
    distributed with PSPP.  Instead, it can be installed directly 
    in emacs and is available from 
    https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/pspp-mode.html
  * The Find dialog box, when searching for numeric values, will 
    match only to the precision of the variable's print format.  
    This avoids behaviour which is suprising to some users.
  * PSPP now supports the SPSS viewer (.spv) format that SPSS 16 and
    later use to save the contents of its output editor:
      - PSPP and PSPPIRE can write output to .spv files.
      - The new utility pspp-output can convert .spv files to other
        formats.
      - The pspp-convert utility can now decrypt encrypted .spv files.
        The encrypted viewer file format is unacceptably insecure, so
        to discourage its use PSPP and PSPPIRE do not directly read or
        write this format.
  * A bug where the Data|Select Cases|Random Sample menu would 
    generate invalid syntax has been fixed.
  * FREQUENCIES will emit a warning if one or more weight values are missing.
  * Plain text output is no longer divided into pages, since it is
    now rarely printed on paper.
  * pspp-convert improvements:
      - New "-a", "-l", "--password-list" options to search for an 
        encrypted file's password.
      - New "--keep" and "--drop" options to output only selected
        variables.
      - New "--recode", "--no-var-name", "--labels", "--print-formats", 
        "--decimal", "--delimiter", and "--qualifier" options to 
        control CSV output.
  * Improvements to SAVE DATA COLLECTION support for MDD files.
  * Bug fix for CVE-2018-20230.
  * The /RENAME subcommand in SAVE TRANSLATE et al. has been extended 
    to support the syntax also accepted by other software.
  * The EXAMINE command will now perform the Shapiro-Wilk test when 
    one or more plots are requested.
  * The REGRESSION command now supports the /STATISTICS=TOL option which
    outputs tolerance and variance inflation factor metrics for the data.
  * The QUICK CLUSTER command now supports the /SAVE option which 
    can be used to save the cases' cluster membership and/or their 
    distance from the cluster centre to the active file.
  * The MEANS command has been re-implemented.
  * The GUI now has a sub-dialog for post-hoc tests of the oneway anova test.
  * GRAPH: Categorical barcharts displaying percentages now show 
    the sub-category as a percentage of the primary category 
    instead of the total.
  * The Syntax Window now has a Find function to perform simple text searching.
  * AUTORECODE:
        The PRINT subcommand is now implemented.
        Many bug fixes.
  * drop avoid_old_Texinfo_4.13.patch
  * drop CVE-2018-20230.patch
  * drop CVE-2019-9211.patch

- Port to ncurses6 (instead of using the deprecated mcurses5):
  + export NCURSES_CONFIG=%{_bindir}/ncurses6-config if the binary

    ncurses8-config.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  3 05:45:21 UTC 2016 - opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com

- Update to 0.10.2:
 * CROSSTABS implements a new COUNT subcommand to round case or cell
   weights.
 * Help will be opened as HTML in default browser if yelp
   is not available.
 * When plotting scatterplots with only one dataset (the simple case)
   the colour used for the dataset is now black. The previous default
   from the Tango palette was too faint to see easily.
 * The varible info dialog could previously only paste a single variable.
   Now it can paste multiple variables.
 * Bug fixes, including the following:
   - T-test with independent samples GUI crashed with string
     type variable as group variable.
   - The variable info dialog showed the previous selected variable
     superimposed with the currently selected one.
   - The GLM command did not properly deal with missing values. This
     has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  3 15:57:10 UTC 2016 - opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com
- Update to 0.10:
 * The QUICK CLUSTER command has a  /PRINT subcommand which shows
   the initial cluster centres and the final cluster membership of
   each case.  The clustering algorithm has also been updated, so
   as to produce better separated clusters.
 * If the DECIMAL character is set to COMMA then the ',' character
   will not be treated as a separator by DATA LIST.
 * The graphical user interface (psppire) has been changed as follows:
   - It now uses Gtk+ version 3 instead of version 2.
   - There is now a Graphs menu to access the GRAPH command.
   - The status of dialog box widgets are now preserved between calls
     to the same dialog box for the same dataset.
   - The dialog box for the Logistic Regression command will now
     infer that string variables or any varible with a "measure"
     of Nominal or Ordinal are to be treated as categorical variables
     and will generate syntax accordingly.
 * The pspp-convert utility can now decrypt encrypted syntax files.
   The encrypted syntax file format is unacceptably insecure, so to
   discourage its use PSPP and PSPPIRE do not directly read or write
   this format.
 * New commands:
   - SORT VARIABLES.
 * The following functions for transformation expressions are new:
   - REPLACE, for search-and-replace of one string with another.
   - STRUNC, to truncate a string and trim trailing spaces.
   - MEDIAN, to compute the median of its arguments.
   - The TRUNC function in expressions now supports additional arguments
     for truncating to values other than integers and to indicate a level
     of rounding fuzz.  The default rounding fuzz may now be controlled
     and displayed with SET FUZZBITS and SHOW FUZZBITS, respectively.
 * Various bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 18 17:40:52 UTC 2015 - opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com

  * The FREQUENCIES and CROSSTABS commands can now generate barcharts.
  * The FACTOR command can now perform PROMAX rotations.
  * SPSS/PC+ system files are now supported on GET and other commands
    that read SPSS system files.  The pspp-convert program can now read
    SPSS/PC+ system files.  Writing the obsolete SPSS/PC+ system file
    format is not supported.
  * SYSFILE INFO can now read SPSS/PC+ system files and SPSS portable
    files.
  * FREQUENCIES: A bug was fixed where an assertion failure occured
    when an empty dataset was presented.
  * The GRAPH command is now available.  Initially it supports
    scatterplots and histograms.
  * The RND operator in expressions now supports additional operands
    for rounding to values other than integers and to indicate a level
    of rounding fuzz.  The default rounding fuzz may now be controlled
    and displayed with SET FUZZBITS and SHOW FUZZBITS, respectively.

- Update to 0.8.3:
 * Independent T-Tests displayed the standard error of the difference
   and the confidence interval for the unequal variances case, where
   the equal variances case should have been.  This has been fixed.
 * REGRESSION now recognises /STATISTICS=CI(x) which causes confidence
   intervals for the coefficients to be printed.
 * When DESCRIPTIVES calculates Z scores, it now omits cases filtered
   by the current FILTER settings.
 * PSPPIRE graphical user interface improvements.
 * System file related improvements.
