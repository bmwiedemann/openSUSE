- Port to ncurses6 (instead of using the deprecated mcurses5):
  + export NCURSES_CONFIG=%{_bindir}/ncurses6-config if the binary
    exists. In case it does not, the default search algorithm of
    configure is being used, meaning ncurses5-config, followed by
    ncurses8-config.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  3 05:45:21 UTC 2016 - opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com

- Update to 0.10.2:
 * CROSSTABS implements a new COUNT subcommand to round case or cell
   weights.
 * Help will be opened as HTML in default browser if yelp
   is not available.
 * When plotting scatterplots with only one dataset (the simple case)
   the colour used for the dataset is now black. The previous default
   from the Tango palette was too faint to see easily.
 * The varible info dialog could previously only paste a single variable.
   Now it can paste multiple variables.
 * Bug fixes, including the following:
   - T-test with independent samples GUI crashed with string
     type variable as group variable.
   - The variable info dialog showed the previous selected variable
     superimposed with the currently selected one.
   - The GLM command did not properly deal with missing values. This
     has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  3 15:57:10 UTC 2016 - opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com
- Update to 0.10:
 * The QUICK CLUSTER command has a  /PRINT subcommand which shows
   the initial cluster centres and the final cluster membership of
   each case.  The clustering algorithm has also been updated, so
   as to produce better separated clusters.
 * If the DECIMAL character is set to COMMA then the ',' character
   will not be treated as a separator by DATA LIST.
 * The graphical user interface (psppire) has been changed as follows:
   - It now uses Gtk+ version 3 instead of version 2.
   - There is now a Graphs menu to access the GRAPH command.
   - The status of dialog box widgets are now preserved between calls
     to the same dialog box for the same dataset.
   - The dialog box for the Logistic Regression command will now
     infer that string variables or any varible with a "measure"
     of Nominal or Ordinal are to be treated as categorical variables
     and will generate syntax accordingly.
 * The pspp-convert utility can now decrypt encrypted syntax files.
   The encrypted syntax file format is unacceptably insecure, so to
   discourage its use PSPP and PSPPIRE do not directly read or write
   this format.
 * New commands:
   - SORT VARIABLES.
 * The following functions for transformation expressions are new:
   - REPLACE, for search-and-replace of one string with another.
   - STRUNC, to truncate a string and trim trailing spaces.
   - MEDIAN, to compute the median of its arguments.
   - The TRUNC function in expressions now supports additional arguments
     for truncating to values other than integers and to indicate a level
     of rounding fuzz.  The default rounding fuzz may now be controlled
     and displayed with SET FUZZBITS and SHOW FUZZBITS, respectively.
 * Various bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 18 17:40:52 UTC 2015 - opensuse.lietuviu.kalba@gmail.com
- Update to 0.8.5:
  * The FREQUENCIES and CROSSTABS commands can now generate barcharts.
  * The FACTOR command can now perform PROMAX rotations.
  * SPSS/PC+ system files are now supported on GET and other commands
    that read SPSS system files.  The pspp-convert program can now read
    SPSS/PC+ system files.  Writing the obsolete SPSS/PC+ system file
    format is not supported.
  * SYSFILE INFO can now read SPSS/PC+ system files and SPSS portable
    files.
  * FREQUENCIES: A bug was fixed where an assertion failure occured
    when an empty dataset was presented.
  * The GRAPH command is now available.  Initially it supports
    scatterplots and histograms.
  * The RND operator in expressions now supports additional operands
    for rounding to values other than integers and to indicate a level
    of rounding fuzz.  The default rounding fuzz may now be controlled
    and displayed with SET FUZZBITS and SHOW FUZZBITS, respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 26 16:42:09 EEST 2014 - embar@super.lt
- Update to 0.8.3:
 * Independent T-Tests displayed the standard error of the difference
   and the confidence interval for the unequal variances case, where
   the equal variances case should have been.  This has been fixed.
 * REGRESSION now recognises /STATISTICS=CI(x) which causes confidence
   intervals for the coefficients to be printed.
 * When DESCRIPTIVES calculates Z scores, it now omits cases filtered
   by the current FILTER settings.
 * PSPPIRE graphical user interface improvements.
 * System file related improvements.
