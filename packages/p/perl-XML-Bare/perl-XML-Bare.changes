- add fix-pointers.diff to fix build on factory

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 27 11:58:24 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.53
   - Remove executable permissions from files that shouldn't have them.
   - Added shebang to main Bare.pm file ( apparently some people want this )
   - Correct line endings to unix style on parser.c
   - Improved simplify function that works properly with trees instead of just a single level
   - Added hash2xml to quickly convert recursing hashes into XML
   - Added proper binmode setting when outputting XML to address deficiences on Win32 ( such as failing Strawberry perl due to line endings )
   - Added evil OS check in file writing code to address differences in how files must be opened to write utf8 on win32 versus linux/cygwin.
   - Added note regarding using utf8 flag instead of using encoding(utf8)
   - Altered UTF8 test to also write XML containing UTF8 to a file.
   - New 'unsafe' parsing mode, giving a 30% speed increase with some downfalls
   - New 'read_more' function, allowing more data to be read in before parsing into a tree
   - Fixed some memory leaks
   - Added 'Controversy' section to documentation
   - Updated speed comparisons for feed2.xml, adding a comparison against XML::Fast as well
     as a comparison of running in 'unsafe' mode.
   - Spelling correction
   - "Modernized" file handling using my variables
   - Remove debugging print statements that were left in
   - Include the new test cases in the distribution
   - Fixes to find_by_perl
     Can now be accessed in an object or namespace flexibly.
     Now ignores case of keys.
     Keys with underscores can be used.
     Will work properly when passed a single node instead of an array reference of nodes.
   - Fixes to xget
     Method of deferencing has been changed to be compatible with newer versions of perl ( 5.10.2+ )
   - Fixed handling of nodes named 'value'; they will no longer crash the XS code
   - Added a new function similar to new called 'simple', that works in the same way but automatically uses the 'simple' parser
   - Altered handling of node values in simple mode, so that it stores values when mixed with nodes or atttributes under 'content' ( like XML::Simple )
     This feature was requested by users so it has been added. Note that it only does this when the value is not composed of just spaces and carriage returns.
   - Revert code back to 0.45 version
     Changes lost in the process:
       Content is not stored in the 'content' key any more; it is stored as the node itself when the node contains nothing else. As God intended.
       Memory leak fixes
       Quote handling
   - Code copyright returned fully to David Helkowski; any changes by other parties have been discarded. Any code ported in from other open source projects removed.
     This has been done intentionally so as to make it possible to relicense the software commerically.
   - XS code modofied to work in a multi-threaded environment
   - Reverting Makefile.PL back to original wierd hackish fixes. They are there for specific reasons.

Fri Feb 10 02:34:00 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 0.47
  - Preping release unchanged from trial release.
    The 0.45 release and previous set particular compile options for several different
    platforms.  My release refactoring stripped the Makefile.PL customisations, however
    it appears these are not needed by any of the smoker CPANTS systems, so am releasing
    with really basic compilation driver - see how it goes...
  - Bug #49906 Simple mode reports content of empty node as integer 1
  - Bug #52762 XML::Simple compatibility mode doesn't support CDATA with attributes
  - Bug #52832 Several memory leaks
  - XML quote decoding on XML read
