%description
You don't need to load this module yourself in most cases. Business::ISBN
will load it when it loads. You must use Business::ISBN 3.005 or later
because the data structure changed slightly to fix a bug with ISBN13
prefixes.

These data are generated from the _RangeMessage.xml_ file provided by the
ISBN Agency. The distributed version matches the date in the version for
this module. You can retrieve this yourself at
https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation. This file is
included as part of the distribution and should be installed at
_~lib/Business/ISBN/Data/RangeMessage.xml_.

If you want to use a different _RangeMessage.xml_ file, you can set the
'ISBN_RANGE_MESSAGE' environment variable to the alternate location before
you load 'Business::ISBN'. This way, you can use the latest (or even
earlier) data without having to install something new or wait for an update
to this module.

If the default _RangeMessage.xml_ or your alternate one is not available,
the module falls back to data included in _Data.pm_. However, that data are
likely to be older. If it does not find that file, it looks for
_RangeMessage.xml_ in the current directory.

The data are in '%Business::ISBN::country_data' (although the "country"
part is historical). If you want to see where the data are from, check
'$Business::ISBN::country_data{_source}'.
