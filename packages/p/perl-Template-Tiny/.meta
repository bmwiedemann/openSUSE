  <title>Template Toolkit reimplemented in as little code as possible</title>
  <description>Template::Tiny is a reimplementation of a partial subset of the Template Toolkit in as few lines of code as possible.

It is intended for use in light-usage, low-memory, or low-cpu templating situations, where you may need to upgrade to the full feature set in the future, or if you want the familiarity of TT-style templates.

It is intended to have fully-compatible template and stash usage, with a limited by similar Perl API.

Unlike Template Toolkit, Template::Tiny will process templates without a compile phase (but despite this is still quicker, owing to heavy use of the Perl regular expression engine.</description>
