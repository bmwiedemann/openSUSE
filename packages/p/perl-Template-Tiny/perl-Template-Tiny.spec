%description
*Template::Tiny* is a reimplementation of a subset of the functionality
from Template Toolkit in as few lines of code as possible.

It is intended for use in light-usage, low-memory, or low-cpu templating
situations, where you may need to upgrade to the full feature set in the
future, or if you want the retain the familiarity of TT-style templates.

For the subset of functionality it implements, it has fully-compatible
template and stash API. All templates used with *Template::Tiny* should be
able to be transparently upgraded to full Template Toolkit.

Unlike Template Toolkit, *Template::Tiny* will process templates without a
compile phase (but despite this is still quicker, owing to heavy use of the
Perl regular expression engine.
