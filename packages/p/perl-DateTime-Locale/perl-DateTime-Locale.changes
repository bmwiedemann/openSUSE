  1.43     2024-07-27

  - Fixed the prefers_24_hour_time method. This was incorrectly returning false when the locale's
    time_format_short method contained a quote string with "h" or "K" in it. For example, the fr-CA
    locale's time_format_short is `HH 'h' mm`. The quoted 'h' caused this method to return
    false. Fixed by Jacques Deguest (@jackdeguest). PR #39.

  - Fixed parsing of the 'el-polyton' locale code. This had the same issue as
    'be-tarask', which was fixed in 1.36. This is now fixed in such a way that
    similar language+variant codes will be parsed correctly in the
    future. Reported by @yvanzo. GH #37.

  1.36     2022-08-20

  - Fixed misparsing of the `be-tarask` locale code. This is a locale with just
    a language name and a variant. The locale parsing code assumed that all
    two-part locale codes had either a script or territory, not a variant. This
    caused the catalog to show the name of this locale as "Belarusian", the same
    as the `be` code. Reported by yvanzo. Fixes GH #32.

  1.35     2022-04-23

  - The code passed to DateTime::Locale->load is now validated and untainted
    before using it to load and eval data from the filesystem. I don't think
    there were any security issues without this, as the load method would only
    attempt to load data from disk if the code was already known. This means
    that attempting to pass in any sort of arbitrary path to the load method
    would simply result in an error that the code was invalid, and there would
    be no attempt to read from disk. Based on GH #30. Implemented by James
    Raspass.

    notable data changes in CLDR 40.0.0.
  - Data change: The root locale is now named "und", not "root".
  - Data change: The "en-US-POSIX" locale has been removed from CLDR. If you
    load this locale you will now get the "en-US" locale.

  - Move a test that was added in 1.27 to xt. This test is a sensitive to small
    variations in error message text, and testing it locally and in CI is
    sufficient. Reported by Kent Fredric. GH #27.
  1.27     2020-08-28
  - The $locale->locale_data method now returns a deep clone of the locale's
    data. This allows you to safely modify any elements of the returned hash
    without breaking the original locale. Implemented by Alexander Pankoff. GH
    #26.
  - We now support loading locale data from relative directories in
    @INC. Implemented by Alexander Pankoff. GH #25.
  - When loading locale data, we now check $! for read errors, as well as
    checking for an error eval'ing the file's contents in $@. Fixed by Alexander
    Pankoff. GH #24.

  1.15     2017-03-15 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Most data is now stored in a share dir and only loaded as needed. This
    should reduce the memory usage from just loading DateTime::Locale by about
    4mb. Based on a PR by sergey. GH #14.
  
  
  1.14     2017-03-05
  
  - Codes with just a language and script code were not parsed correctly,
    leading to bugs in their data, so that they did not report a script_code,
    nor did their name reflect the script. So for example "bs-Latn" was just
    "Bosnian" instead of "Bosnian Latin".

  - Instead of using the DATA handle to get at as-yet-unloaded locale data in
    DateTime::Locale::Data, we now read the raw data into memory once, and use
    eval to turn it into Perl data structures as a particular locale is
    requested. This may fix a problem where reading from the DATA handle somehow
    returned the wrong chunk of data (or overlapped multiple locales). The
    downside is that loading DateTime::Locale now uses an additional 4MB of
    memory on my system, regardless of how many individual locales are
    instantiated. Reported by Greg Oschwald. GitHub #3.

  1.00     2015-11-07
  
  * All of these changes were originally released in previous trial releases,
    but I'm repeating them here for clarity.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  - This release uses the locale data from CLDR version 28. The last major
    update of the locale data used CLDR 1.7.1, released in 2009, so this is a
    big change. Many things have changed in terms of locale data.
  
  - Some locales are no longer available because they are not in the CLDR data.
  
  - The CLDR data no longer includes default date and time format lengths. This
    is now "medium" for every locale, simply to provide some level of backwards
    compatibility.
  
  - Loading DateTime::Locale itself is now quite a bit faster. The whole locale
    registration system has been removed entirely, except for custom
    locales. This fixes RT #78794. Requested by Michael Conrad.
  
  - A long-standing issue with the Austrian locale not using the Austrian name
    for January has been fixed. RT #52337. Reported by Thomas Klausner.
  
  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]
  
  - This is a big new release, and includes a number of backwards-incompatible
    changes. However, most users should be unaffected by this change. If you
    only use this module via DateTime.pm, you are unlikely to notice any changes
    other than changes to the locale data.
  
  - The old API deprecated since 0.40 has been removed (almost) entirely.
  
  - We now refer to things as "code" in the docs and method names where we used
    to call them ids. This includes locale, language, script, territory, and
    variant codes. This is more in line with the various ISO standards and the
    CLDR packages.
  
  - All the $locale->*_id methods (including $locale->id) are deprecated. Use
    the relevant $locale->*_code method instead.
  
  - The canonical form of the locale codes now uses dashes (-) instead of
    underscores (_). Loading a locale with an underscore in the name
    (e.g. en_US) still works.
  
  - The way that locale data is packaged has changed quite a bit. We no longer
    package each locale in its own class. Instead, all locale data is in a
    single module (mostly in a __DATA__ section) and loaded into memory as
    needed. If you have any code that checks $locale->isa, that code may
    break.
  
  - Locales are no longer subclasses of DateTime::Locale::Base. This module is
    still included in the distribution in case someone has a custom locale that
    inherits from this module. However, this module will go away in a future
    release.
  z
  - The "ii-*" aliases for the "he-*" locales have been removed.
  
  - The "no-*" aliases for the "nn-*" locales have been removed.
  
  - The value of $locale->code no longer reflects the value passed to
    DateTime::Locale->load. This only affects aliases and non-canonical forms of
    the code. For example, if you load "en_US" then $locale->code will return
    "en-US". If you load "C" or "POSIX" the returned code will be "en-US-POSIX".
  
  - All of the documentation related to creating aliases and registering custom
    locales has been removed. All of these methods still work, but I don't think
    this system got much use, so I don't want to emphasize it in the docs. (But
    let me know if you are using this and want to see these docs restored).
  
  
  0.96     2015-10-04 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Locale data with characters in the 0x80-0xFF range was not marked as UTF-8
    by Perl. This could cause all sorts of weirdness and was generally bad.
  
  
  0.95     2015-09-30 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Added .pod files for each locale that document the data for that locale.
  
  
  0.94     2015-09-30 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Restored the datetime_format method to individual locale objects for
    backwards compatibility.
  
  
  0.93     2015-09-28 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Really release a trial release this time. I'm not kidding. See 0.90 for the
    interesting changes.

  - I accidentally released 0.90 as a non-trial release. This release is the

    DateTime.pm tests.

  - Fixed handling of C locales like "C.UTF-8". Passing these to
    DateTime::Locale->load would cause a warning followed by an exception, ubt
    all "C" locales should be special-cased as an alias of en-US-POSIX. Reported
    by David Wheeler. RT #104574.

- update to 0.45
  - Installing this release will cause older versions of
    DateTime::Format::Strptime to warn like crazy. Please update
    DateTime::Format::Strptime if you install this release.
  - This is an interim release still based on CLDR 1.7.1 pending the release of
    Locale::CLDR, which will happen real soon now, for some definition of soon.
  - Removed dependency on Class::ISA and just copied what we need from said
    module directly. Class::ISA warns as deprecated if used with Perl 5.11.0,
    even though it works just fine (doh). RT #53940.
  - All methods deprecated in the last release now warn when called.
  - Added methods to return per-locale strftime formats from the glibc
    data. These methods are not yet documented. They are just there for now to
    allow me to update DateTime::Format::Strptime.
- 0.44   2009-09-12
  - All methods which return strftime-style patterns are officially deprecated
    (and have been a little broken for some time, regardless). This includes all
    date and time format methods ending in "_format".
  - Other deprecated methods include:
    date_parts_order, date_before_time
    era, eras
    month_name, month_abbreviation, month_narrow
    month_names, month_abbreviations, month_narrows
    day_name, day_abbreviation, day_narrow
    day_names, day_abbreviations, day_narrows
    quarter_name, quarter_abbreviation, quarter_narrow
    quarter_names, quarter_abbreviations
    am_pm, am_pms
    era_name, era_abbreviation
    era_narrow, era_names, era_abbreviations
  - All of these deprecated methods will eventually be removed. If you are using
    them directly, please change your code.
  - Converted data files in tools/t/test-data to Unix line endings. This works
    around a bug in Module::Signature. Reported by Zefram. RT #49085.
  - Require Params::Validate 0.91, since 0.89 caused test failures for
    someone. Reported by Jeremy Hetzler. RT #41365.
  - Moved code to my hg repo at http://hg.urth.org/hg/DateTime-Locale.
- 0.43   2009-06-30
  - Based on CLDR 1.7.1, which includes support for several new
    languages, as well as lots of changes.
