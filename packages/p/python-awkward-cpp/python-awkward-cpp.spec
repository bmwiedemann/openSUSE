%description
Awkward Array is a library for nested, variable-sized data, including
arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using
NumPy-like idioms.

Arrays are dynamically typed, but operations on them are compiled and fast.
Their behavior coincides with NumPy when array dimensions are regular and
generalizes when they're not.

awkward-cpp provides precompiled routines for the awkward package.
It is not useful on its own, only as a dependency for awkward.
