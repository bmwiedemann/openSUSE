  <title>Dynamically load C libraries into Perl code</title>
  <description>This module defines a standard simplified interface to the dynamic linking
mechanisms available on many platforms. Its primary purpose is to implement
cheap automatic dynamic loading of Perl modules.

For a more complicated interface, see DynaLoader. Many (most) features of
DynaLoader are not implemented in XSLoader, like for example the dl_load_flags,
not honored by XSLoader.
