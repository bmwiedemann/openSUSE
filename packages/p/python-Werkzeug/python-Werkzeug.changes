Wed Jan  3 23:07:03 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 0.14.1:
  * Resolved a regression with status code handling in the integrated
    development server.

- changes from version 0.14:
  * HTTP exceptions are now automatically caught by
    Request.application.
  * Added support for edge as browser.
  * Added support for platforms that lack SpooledTemporaryFile.
  * Add support for etag handling through if-match
  * Added support for the SameSite cookie attribute.
  * Added werkzeug.wsgi.ProxyMiddleware
  * Implemented has for NullCache
  * get_multi on cache clients now returns lists all the time.
  * Improved the watchdog observer shutdown for the reloader to not
    crash on exit on older Python versions.
  * Added support for filename* filename attributes according to RFC
    2231
  * Resolved an issue where machine ID for the reloader PIN was not
    read accurately on windows.
  * Added a workaround for syntax errors in init files in the
    reloader.
  * Added support for using the reloader with console scripts on
    windows.
  * The built-in HTTP server will no longer close a connection in
    cases where no HTTP body is expected (204, 204, HEAD requests
    etc.)
  * The EnvironHeaders object now skips over empty content type and
    lengths if they are set to falsy values.
  * Werkzeug will no longer send the content-length header on 1xx or
    204/304 responses.
  * Cookie values are now also permitted to include slashes and equal
    signs without quoting.
  * Relaxed the regex for the routing converter arguments.
  * If cookies are sent without values they are now assumed to have an
    empty value and the parser accepts this. Previously this could
    have corrupted cookies that followed the value.
  * The test Client and EnvironBuilder now support mimetypes like the
    request object does.
  * Added support for static weights in URL rules.
  * Better handle some more complex reloader scenarios where sys.path
    contained non directory paths.
  * EnvironHeaders no longer raises weird errors if non string keys
    are passed to it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  8 18:07:40 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * added CHANGES.rst and README.rst to %doc section

- update to version 0.13:
  * Deprecate support for Python 2.6 and 3.3. CI tests will not run
    for these versions, and support will be dropped completely in the
    next version. (pallets/meta#24)
  * Raise TypeError when port is not an integer. (#1088)
  * Fully deprecate werkzeug.script. Use Click instead. (#1090)
  * response.age is parsed as a timedelta. Previously, it was
    incorrectly treated as a datetime. The header value is an integer
    number of seconds, not a date string. (#414)
  * Fix a bug in TypeConversionDict where errors are not propagated
    when using the converter. (#1102)
  * Authorization.qop is a string instead of a set, to comply with RFC
    2617. (#984)
  * An exception is raised when an encoded cookie is larger than, by
    default, 4093 bytes. Browsers may silently ignore cookies larger
    than this. BaseResponse has a new attribute max_cookie_size and
    dump_cookie has a new argument max_size to configure this. (#780,
    #1109)
  * Fix a TypeError in
    werkzeug.contrib.lint.GuardedIterator.close. (#1116)
  * BaseResponse.calculate_content_length now correctly works for
    Unicode responses on Python 3. It first encodes using
    iter_encoded. (#705)
  * Secure cookie contrib works with string secret key on Python
    3. (#1205)
  * Shared data middleware accepts a list instead of a dict of static
    locations to preserve lookup order. (#1197)
  * HTTP header values without encoding can contain single
    quotes. (#1208)
  * The built-in dev server supports receiving requests with chunked
    transfer encoding. (#1198)

    ones, see pull request ``#753``.
  * Add support for encoding in options header parsing, see pull request
    ``#933``.

    pull request ``#879``.
  * When `HTTPException` is raised, it now prints the description, for easier
    debugging.
  * Werkzeug's dict-like datastructures now have ``view``-methods under Python 2,
    see pull request ``#968``.
  * Fix a bug in ``MultiPartParser`` when no ``stream_factory`` was provided
    during initialization, see pull request ``#973``.

Thu Sep 15 23:08:05 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- update to version 0.11.11:
  * Fix JSONRequestMixin for Python3. See #731
  * Fix broken string handling in test client when passing
    integers. See #852
  * Fix a bug in "parse_options_header" where an invalid content type
    starting with comma or semi-colon would result in an invalid
    return value, see issue "#995".
  * Fix a bug in multidicts when passing empty lists as values, see
    issue "#979".
  * Fix a security issue that allows XSS on the Werkzeug debugger. See
    "#1001".
- update to version 0.11.10:
  * Fixed a bug that occurs when running on Python 2.6 and using a
    broken locale.  See pull request #912.
  * Fixed a crash when running the debugger on Google App Engine. See
    issue #925.
  * Fixed an issue with multipart parsing that could cause memory
    exhaustion.
- Update to 0.11.9
  - Corrected an issue that caused the debugger not to use the
    machine GUID on POSIX systems.
  - Corrected an Unicode error on Python 3 for the debugger's
    PIN usage.
  - Corrected the timestamp verification in the pin debug code.
    Without this fix the pin was remebered until too long.
- update to version 0.11.8:
  * fixed a problem with the machine GUID detection code on OS X on
    Python 3.
- changes from version 0.11.7:
  * fixed a regression on Python 3 for the debugger.
- changes from version 0.11.6:
  * werkzeug.serving: Still show the client address on bad requests.
  * improved the PIN based protection for the debugger to make it
    harder to brute force via trying cookies.  Please keep in mind
    that the debugger *is not intended for running on production
    environments*
  * increased the pin timeout to a week to make it less annoying for
    people which should decrease the change that users disable the pin
    check entirely.
  * werkzeug.serving: Fix broken HTTP_HOST when path starts with
    double slash.
- update to version 0.11.5:
  * werkzeug.serving: Fix crash when attempting SSL connection to HTTP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 13:01:58 UTC 2016 - aplanas@suse.com

- Add 0001_create_a_thread_to_reap_death_process.patch
  Fixes bsc#954591

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 12:35:28 UTC 2016 - aplanas@suse.com

- update to 0.11.3:
  - Added reloader_paths option to run_simple and other functions in
    werkzeug.serving. This allows the user to completely override the
    Python module watching of Werkzeug with custom paths.
  - Many custom cached properties of Werkzeug’s classes are now
    subclasses of Python’s property type (issue #616).
  - bind_to_environ now doesn’t differentiate between implicit and
    explicit default port numbers in HTTP_HOST (pull request #204).
  - BuildErrors are now more informative. They come with a complete
    sentence as error message, and also provide suggestions (pull
    request #691).
  - Fix a bug in the user agent parser where Safari’s build number
    instead of version would be extracted (pull request #703).
  - Fixed issue where RedisCache set_many was broken for twemproxy,
    which doesn’t support the default MULTI command (pull request
    #702).
  - mimetype parameters on request and response classes are now always
    converted to lowercase.
  - Changed cache so that cache never expires if timeout is 0. This
    also fixes an issue with redis setex (issue #550)
  - Werkzeug now assumes UTF-8 as filesystem encoding on Unix if
    Python detected it as ASCII.
  - New optional has method on caches.
  - Fixed various bugs in parse_options_header (pull request #643).
  - If the reloader is enabled the server will now open the socket in
    the parent process if this is possible. This means that when the
    reloader kicks in the connection from client will wait instead of
    tearing down. This does not work on all Python versions.
  - Implemented PIN based authentication for the debugger. This can
    optionally be disabled but is discouraged. This change was
    necessary as it has been discovered that too many people run the
    debugger in production.
  - Devserver no longer requires SSL module to be installed.
  - Reloader: Correctly detect file changes made by moving temporary
    files over the original, which is e.g. the case with PyCharm (pull
    request #722).
  - Fix bool behavior of werkzeug.datastructures.ETags under Python 3
    (issue #744).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 22 14:22:45 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 0.10.4:
  - Re-release of 0.10.3 with packaging artifacts manually removed.
  - Re-release of 0.10.2 without packaging artifacts.
  - Fixed issue where ``empty`` could break third-party libraries that relied on
    keyword arguments (pull request ``#675``)
  - Improved ``Rule.empty`` by providing a ```get_empty_kwargs`` to allow setting
    custom kwargs without having to override entire ``empty`` method. (pull
    request ``#675``)
   - Fixed ```extra_files``` parameter for reloader to not cause startup
     to crash when included in server params
   - Using `MultiDict` when building URLs is now not supported again. The behavior
     introduced several regressions.
   - Fix performance problems with stat-reloader (pull request ``#715``).
   - Fixed regression with multiple query values for URLs (pull request ``#667``).
   - Fix issues with eventlet's monkeypatching and the builtin server (pull
     request ``#663``).
   - Changed the error handling of and improved testsuite for the caches in
     ``contrib.cache``.
   - Fixed a bug on Python 3 when creating adhoc ssl contexts, due to `sys.maxint`
     not being defined.
   - Fixed a bug on Python 3, that caused
     :func:`~werkzeug.serving.make_ssl_devcert` to fail with an exception.
   - Added exceptions for 504 and 505.
   - Added support for ChromeOS detection.
   - Added UUID converter to the routing system.
   - Added message that explains how to quit the server.
   - Fixed a bug on Python 2, that caused ``len`` for
     :class:`werkzeug.datastructures.CombinedMultiDict` to crash.
   - Added support for stdlib pbkdf2 hmac if a compatible digest
     is found.
   - Ported testsuite to use ``py.test``.
   - Minor optimizations to various middlewares (pull requests ``#496`` and
     ``#571``).
   - Use stdlib ``ssl`` module instead of ``OpenSSL`` for the builtin server
     (issue ``#434``). This means that OpenSSL contexts are not supported anymore,
     but instead ``ssl.SSLContext`` from the stdlib.
   - Allow protocol-relative URLs when building external URLs.
   - Fixed Atom syndication to print time zone offset for tz-aware datetime
     objects (pull request ``#254``).
   - Improved reloader to track added files and to recover from broken
     sys.modules setups with syntax errors in packages.
   - ``cache.RedisCache`` now supports arbitrary ``**kwargs`` for the redis
     object.
   - ``werkzeug.test.Client`` now uses the original request method when resolving
     307 redirects (pull request ``#556``).
   - ``werkzeug.datastructures.MIMEAccept`` now properly deals with mimetype
     parameters (pull request ``#205``).
   - ``werkzeug.datastructures.Accept`` now handles a quality of ``0`` as
     intolerable, as per RFC 2616 (pull request ``#536``).
   - ``werkzeug.urls.url_fix`` now properly encodes hostnames with ``idna``
     encoding (issue ``#559``). It also doesn't crash on malformed URLs anymore
     (issue ``#582``).
   - ``werkzeug.routing.MapAdapter.match`` now recognizes the difference between
     the path ``/`` and an empty one (issue ``#360``).
   - The interactive debugger now tries to decode non-ascii filenames (issue
     ``#469``).
   - Increased default key size of generated SSL certificates to 1024 bits (issue
     ``#611``).
   - Added support for specifying a ``Response`` subclass to use when calling
     :func:`~werkzeug.utils.redirect`\ .
   - ``werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder`` now doesn't use the request method anymore
     to guess the content type, and purely relies on the ``form``, ``files`` and
   ``input_stream`` properties (issue ``#620``).
   - Added Symbian to the user agent platform list.
   - Fixed make_conditional to respect automatically_set_content_length
   - Unset ``Content-Length`` when writing to response.stream (issue ``#451``)
   - ``wrappers.Request.method`` is now always uppercase, eliminating
     inconsistencies of the WSGI environment (issue ``647``).
   - ``routing.Rule.empty`` now works correctly with subclasses of ``Rule`` (pull
     request ``#645``).
   - Made map updating safe in light of concurrent updates.
   - Allow multiple values for the same field for url building (issue ``#658``).
   - Fix unicode problems in ``werkzeug.debug.tbtools``.
   - Fix Python 3-compatibility problems in ``werkzeug.posixemulation``.
   - Backport fix of fatal typo for ``ImmutableList`` (issue ``#492``).
   - Make creation of the cache dir for ``FileSystemCache`` atomic (issue
     ``#468``).
   - Use native strings for memcached keys to work with Python 3 client (issue
     ``#539``).
   - Fix charset detection for ``werkzeug.debug.tbtools.Frame`` objects (issues
     ``#547`` and ``#532``).
   - Fix ``AttributeError`` masking in ``werkzeug.utils.import_string`` (issue
     ``#182``).
   - Explicitly shut down server (issue ``#519``).
   - Fix timeouts greater than 2592000 being misinterpreted as UNIX timestamps in
     ``werkzeug.contrib.cache.MemcachedCache`` (issue ``#533``).
   - Fix bug where ``werkzeug.exceptions.abort`` would raise an arbitrary subclass
     of the expected class (issue ``#422``).
   - Fix broken ``jsrouting`` (due to removal of ``werkzeug.templates``)
   - ``werkzeug.urls.url_fix`` now doesn't crash on malformed URLs anymore, but
     returns them unmodified. This is a cheap workaround for ``#582``, the proper
     fix is included in version 0.10.
   - The repr of ``werkzeug.wrappers.Request`` doesn't crash on non-ASCII-values
     anymore (pull request ``#466``).
   - Fix bug in ``cache.RedisCache`` when combined with ``redis.StrictRedis``
     object (pull request ``#583``).
   - The ``qop`` parameter for ``WWW-Authenticate`` headers is now always quoted,
     as required by RFC 2617 (issue ``#633``).
   - Fix bug in ``werkzeug.contrib.cache.SimpleCache`` with Python 3 where add/set 
     may throw an exception when pruning old entries from the cache (pull request
     ``#651``).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 18 15:06:30 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 0.9.6
  - Added a safe conversion for IRI to URI conversion and use that
    internally to work around issues with spec violations for
    protocols such as ``itms-service``.
- Update to 0.9.5
  - Forward charset argument from request objects to the environ
    builder.
  - Fixed error handling for missing boundaries in multipart data.
  - Fixed session creation on systems without ``os.urandom()``.
  - Fixed pluses in dictionary keys not being properly URL encoded.
  - Fixed a problem with deepcopy not working for multi dicts.
  - Fixed a double quoting issue on redirects.
  - Fixed a problem with unicode keys appearing in headers on 2.x.
  - Fixed a bug with unicode strings in the test builder.
  - Fixed a unicode bug on Python 3 in the WSGI profiler.
  - Fixed an issue with the safe string compare function on
    Python 2.7.7 and Python 3.4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 24 11:17:13 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Require python-setuptools instead of distribute (upstreams merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  3 08:12:07 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.9.4:
  - Fixed an issue with Python 3.3 and an edge case in cookie parsing.
  - Fixed decoding errors not handled properly through the WSGI
    decoding dance.
  - Fixed URI to IRI conversion incorrectly decoding percent signs.
  - Restored beahvior of the ``data`` descriptor of the request class to pre 0.9
    behavior.  This now also means that ``.data`` and ``.get_data()`` have
    different behavior.  New code should use ``.get_data()`` always.

    In addition to that there is now a flag for the ``.get_data()`` method that
    controls what should happen with form data parsing and the form parser will
    honor cached data.  This makes dealing with custom form data more consistent.
  - Added `unsafe` parameter to :func:`~werkzeug.urls.url_quote`.
  - Fixed an issue with :func:`~werkzeug.urls.url_quote_plus` not quoting
    `'+'` correctly.
  - Ported remaining parts of :class:`~werkzeug.contrib.RedisCache` to
    Python 3.3.
  - Ported remaining parts of :class:`~werkzeug.contrib.MemcachedCache` to
    Python 3.3
  - Fixed a deprecation warning in the contrib atom module.
  - Fixed a regression with setting of content types through the
    headers dictionary instead with the content type parameter.
  - Use correct name for stdlib secure string comparision function.
  - Fixed a wrong reference in the docstring of
    :func:`~werkzeug.local.release_local`.
  - Fixed an `AttributeError` that sometimes occurred when accessing the
    :attr:`werkzeug.wrappers.BaseResponse.is_streamed` attribute.
  - Fixed an issue with integers no longer being accepted in certain
    parts of the routing system or URL quoting functions.
  - Fixed an issue with `url_quote` not producing the right escape
    codes for single digit codepoints.
  - Fixed an issue with :class:`~werkzeug.wsgi.SharedDataMiddleware` not
    reading the path correctly and breaking on etag generation in some
    cases.
  - Properly handle `Expect: 100-continue` in the development server
    to resolve issues with curl.
  - Automatically exhaust the input stream on request close.  This should
    fix issues where not touching request files results in a timeout.
  - Fixed exhausting of streams not doing anything if a non-limited
    stream was passed into the multipart parser.
  - Raised the buffer sizes for the multipart parser.
  - Added support for :meth:`~werkzeug.wsgi.LimitedStream.tell`
    on the limited stream.
  - :class:`~werkzeug.datastructures.ETags` now is nonzero if it
    contains at least one etag of any kind, including weak ones.
  - Added a workaround for a bug in the stdlib for SSL servers.
  - Improved SSL interface of the devserver so that it can generate
    certificates easily and load them from files.
  - Refactored test client to invoke the open method on the class
    for redirects.  This makes subclassing more powerful.
  - :func:`werkzeug.wsgi.make_chunk_iter` and
    :func:`werkzeug.wsgi.make_line_iter` now support processing of
    iterators and streams.
  - URL generation by the routing system now no longer quotes
    ``+``.
  - URL fixing now no longer quotes certain reserved characters.
  - The :func:`werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash` and
    check functions now support any of the hashlib algorithms.
  - `wsgi.get_current_url` is now ascii safe for browsers sending
    non-ascii data in query strings.
  - improved parsing behavior for :func:`werkzeug.http.parse_options_header`
  - added more operators to local proxies.
  - added a hook to override the default converter in the routing
    system.
  - The description field of HTTP exceptions is now always escaped.
    Use markup objects to disable that.
  - Added number of proxy argument to the proxy fix to make it more
    secure out of the box on common proxy setups.  It will by default
    no longer trust the x-forwarded-for header as much as it did
    before.
  - Added support for fragment handling in URI/IRI functions.
  - Added custom class support for :func:`werkzeug.http.parse_dict_header`.
  - Renamed `LighttpdCGIRootFix` to `CGIRootFix`.
  - Always treat `+` as safe when fixing URLs as people love misusing them.
  - Added support to profiling into directories in the contrib profiler.
  - The escape function now by default escapes quotes.
  - Changed repr of exceptions to be less magical.
  - Simplified exception interface to no longer require environmnts
    to be passed to recieve the response object.
  - Added sentinel argument to IterIO objects.
  - Added pbkdf2 support for the security module.
  - Added a plain request type that disables all form parsing to only
    leave the stream behind.
  - Removed support for deprecated `fix_headers`.
  - Removed support for deprecated `header_list`.
  - Removed support for deprecated parameter for `iter_encoded`.
  - Removed support for deprecated non-silent usage of the limited
    stream object.
  - Removed support for previous dummy `writable` parameter on
    the cached property.
  - Added support for explicitly closing request objects to close
    associated resources.
  - Conditional request handling or access to the data property on responses no
    longer ignores direct passthrough mode.
  - Removed werkzeug.templates and werkzeug.contrib.kickstart.
  - Changed host lookup logic for forwarded hosts to allow lists of
    hosts in which case only the first one is picked up.
  - Added `wsgi.get_query_string`, `wsgi.get_path_info` and
    `wsgi.get_script_name` and made the `wsgi.pop_path_info` and
    `wsgi.peek_path_info` functions perform unicode decoding.  This
    was necessary to avoid having to expose the WSGI encoding dance
    on Python 3.
  - Added `content_encoding` and `content_md5` to the request object's
    common request descriptor mixin.
  - added `options` and `trace` to the test client.
  - Overhauled the utilization of the input stream to be easier to use
    and better to extend.  The detection of content payload on the input
    side is now more compliant with HTTP by detecting off the content
    type header instead of the request method.  This also now means that
    the stream property on the request class is always available instead
    of just when the parsing fails.
  - Added support for using :class:`werkzeug.wrappers.BaseResponse` in a with
    statement.
  - Changed `get_app_iter` to fetch the response early so that it does not
    fail when wrapping a response iterable.  This makes filtering easier.
  - Introduced `get_data` and `set_data` methods for responses.
  - Introduced `get_data` for requests.
  - Soft deprecated the `data` descriptors for request and response objects.
  - Added `as_bytes` operations to some of the headers to simplify working
    with things like cookies.
  - Made the debugger paste tracebacks into github's gist service as
    private pastes.

Mon Mar 12 21:35:29 UTC 2012 - saschpe@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.8.3:
  - Fixed another issue with :func:`werkzeug.wsgi.make_line_iter`
    where lines longer than the buffer size were not handled
    properly.
  - Restore stdout after debug console finished executing so
    that the debugger can be used on GAE better.
  - Fixed a bug with the redis cache for int subclasses
    (affects bool caching).
  - Fixed an XSS problem with redirect targets coming from
    untrusted sources.
- Changes from version 0.8.2:
  - Fixed a problem with request handling of the builtin server
    not repsonding to socket errors properly.
  - The routing request redirect exception's code attribute is now
    used properly.
  - Fixed a bug with shutdowns on Windows.
  - Fixed a few unicode issues with non-ascii characters being
    hardcoded in URL rules.
  - Fixed two property docstrings being assigned to fdel instead
    of ``__doc__``.
  - Fixed an issue where CRLF line endings could be split into two
    by the line iter function, causing problems with multipart file
    uploads.

Thu Nov 10 11:07:11 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 0.8.1:
  * Fixed an issue with the memcache not working properly.
  * Fixed an issue for Python 2.7.1 and higher that broke
    copying of multidicts with :func:`copy.copy`.
  * Changed hashing methodology of immutable ordered multi dicts
    for a potential problem with alternative Python implementations.
- Changes from version 0.8:
  * Removed data structure specific KeyErrors for a general
    purpose :exc:`~werkzeug.exceptions.BadRequestKeyError`.
  * Documented :meth:`werkzeug.wrappers.BaseRequest._load_form_data`.
  * The routing system now also accepts strings instead of
    dictionaries for the `query_args` parameter since we're only
    passing them through for redirects.
  * Werkzeug now automatically sets the content length immediately when
    the :attr:`~werkzeug.wrappers.BaseResponse.data` attribute is set
    for efficiency and simplicity reasons.
  * The routing system will now normalize server names to lowercase.
  * The routing system will no longer raise ValueErrors in case the
    configuration for the server name was incorrect.  This should make
    deployment much easier because you can ignore that factor now.
  * Fixed a bug with parsing HTTP digest headers.  It rejected headers
    with missing nc and nonce params.
  * Proxy fix now also updates wsgi.url_scheme based on X-Forwarded-Proto.
  * Added support for key prefixes to the redis cache.
  * Added the ability to supress some auto corrections in the wrappers
    that are now controlled via `autocorrect_location_header` and
    `automatically_set_content_length` on the response objects.
  * Werkzeug now uses a new method to check that the length of incoming
    data is complete and will raise IO errors by itself if the server
    fails to do so.
  * :func:`~werkzeug.wsgi.make_line_iter` now requires a limit that is
    not higher than the length the stream can provide.
  * Refactored form parsing into a form parser class that makes it possible
    to hook into individual parts of the parsing process for debugging and
    extending.
  * For conditional responses the content length is no longer set when it
    is already there and added if missing.
  * Immutable datastructures are hashable now.
  * Headers datastructure no longer allows newlines in values to avoid
    header injection attacks.
  * Made it possible through subclassing to select a different remote
    addr in the proxy fix.
  * Added stream based URL decoding.  This reduces memory usage on large
    transmitted form data that is URL decoded since Werkzeug will no longer
    load all the unparsed data into memory.
  * Memcache client now no longer uses the buggy cmemcache module and
    supports pylibmc.  GAE is not tried automatically and the dedicated
    class is no longer necessary.
  * Redis cache now properly serializes data.
  * Removed support for Python 2.4
- Changes from version 0.7.2:
  * Fixed a CSRF problem with the debugger.
  * The debugger is now generating private pastes on lodgeit.
  * If URL maps are now bound to environments the query arguments
    are properly decoded from it for redirects.

Tue Sep 27 09:31:46 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Package renamed to python-Werkzeug
- Update to version 0.7.1:
  * Fixed a problem with newer versions of IPython
  * Disabled pyinotify based reloader which does not work reliably.
- Changes from version 0.7.0:
  * Add support for python-libmemcached to the Werkzeug cache abstraction
    layer.
  * improved url_decode and url_encode performance.
  * fixed an issue where the SharedDataMiddleware could cause an
    internal server error on weird paths when loading via pkg_resources.
  * fixed an URL generation bug that caused URLs to be invalid if a
    generated component contains a colon.
  * werkzeug.import_string now works with partially set up
    packages properly.
  * disabled automatic socket swiching for IPv6 on the development
    server due to problems it caused.
  * Werkzeug no longer overrides the Date header when creating a
    conditional HTTP response.
  * The routing system provides a method to retrieve the matching
    methods for a given path.
  * The routing system now accepts a parameter to change the encoding
    error behaviour.
  * The local manager can now accept custom ident functions in the
    constructor that are forwarded to the wrapped local objects.
  * url_unquote_plus now accepts unicode strings again.
  * fixed an issues with the filesystem session support's prune
    function and concurrent usage.
  * fixed a problem with external URL generation discarding the port.
  * added support for pylibmc to the Werkzeug cache abstraction layer.
  * fixed an issue with the new multipart parser that happened when
    a linkebreak happend to be on the chunk limit.
  * cookies are now set properly if ports are in use.  A runtime error
    is raised if one tries to set a cookie for a domain without a dot.
  * fixed an issue with Template.from_file not working for file
    descriptors.
  * reloader can now use inotify to track reloads.  This requires the
    pyinotify library to be installed.
  * See more in file CHANGES...
