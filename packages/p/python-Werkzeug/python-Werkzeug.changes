Tue May  7 06:01:38 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.3:
  * Only allow ``localhost``, ``.localhost``, ``127.0.0.1``, or the
    specified hostname when running the dev server, to make debugger
    requests. Additional hosts can be added by using the debugger
    middleware directly. The debugger UI makes requests using the
    full URL rather than only the path.  :ghsa:`2g68-c3qc-8985`
    (CVE-2024-34069, bsc#1223979)
  * Make reloader more robust when ``""`` is in ``sys.path``.
    :pr:`2823`
  * Better TLS cert format with ``adhoc`` dev certs. :pr:`2891`
  * Inform Python < 3.12 how to handle ``itms-services`` URIs
    correctly, rather than using an overly-broad workaround in
    Werkzeug that caused some redirect URIs to be passed on without
    encoding. :issue:`2828`
  * Type annotation for ``Rule.endpoint`` and other uses of
    ``endpoint`` is ``Any``. :issue:`2836`
- Update to 3.0.2:
  * Ensure setting ``merge_slashes`` to ``False`` results in
    ``NotFound`` for repeated-slash requests against single slash
    routes. :issue:`2834`
  * Fix handling of ``TypeError`` in ``TypeConversionDict.get()`` to
    match ``ValueError``. :issue:`2843`
  * Fix ``response_wrapper`` type check in test client. :issue:`2831`
  * Make the return type of ``MultiPartParser.parse`` more precise.
    :issue:`2840`
  * Raise an error if converter arguments cannot be parsed.
    :issue:`2822`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 27 03:06:50 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.1:
  * Fix slow multipart parsing for large parts potentially enabling DoS
    attacks. (CVE-2023-46136, bsc#1216581)
  * Remove previously deprecated code.
  * Deprecate the ``__version__`` attribute. Use feature detection, or
    ``importlib.metadata.version("werkzeug")``, instead.
  * ``generate_password_hash`` uses scrypt by default.
  * Add the ``"werkzeug.profiler"`` item to the  WSGI ``environ`` dictionary
    passed to `ProfilerMiddleware`'s `filename_format` function. It contains
    the ``elapsed`` and ``time`` values for the profiled request.
  * Explicitly marked the PathConverter as non path isolating.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 25 02:04:19 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.3.7:
  * Use ``flit_core`` instead of ``setuptools`` as build backend.
  * Fix parsing of multipart bodies.
    Adjust index of last newline in data start.
  * ``_plain_int`` and ``_plain_float`` strip whitespace before type
    enforcement.
  * Fix empty file streaming when testing.
  * Clearer error message when URL rule does not start with slash.
  * ``Accept`` ``q`` value can be a float without a decimal part.
- Drop captialisation again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 19 06:24:50 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 2.3.6:
  * FileStorage.content_length does not fail if the form data did not provide
    a value.
- Update to 2.3.5:
  * Python 3.12 compatibility.
  * Fix handling of invalid base64 values in Authorization.from_header.
  * The debugger escapes the exception message in the page title.
  * When binding routing.Map, a long IDNA server_name with a port does not
    fail encoding.
  * iri_to_uri shows a deprecation warning instead of an error when passing
    bytes.
  * When parsing numbers in HTTP request headers such as Content-Length, only
    ASCII digits are accepted rather than any format that Python’s int and
    float accept.
- Update to 2.3.4:
  * Authorization.from_header and WWWAuthenticate.from_header detects tokens
    that end with base64 padding (=).
  * Remove usage of warnings.catch_warnings.
  * Remove max_form_parts restriction from standard form data parsing and only
    use if for multipart content.
  * Response will avoid converting the Location header in some cases to
    preserve invalid URL schemes like itms-services.
- Update to 2.3.3:
  * Fix parsing of large multipart bodies. Remove invalid leading newline, and
    restore parsing speed.
  * The cookie Path attribute is set to / by default again, to prevent clients
    from falling back to RFC 6265’s default-path behavior.
- Update to 2.3.2:
  * Parse the cookie Expires attribute correctly in the test client.
  * max_content_length can only be enforced on streaming requests if the
    server sets wsgi.input_terminated.
- Update to 2.3.1:
  * Percent-encode plus (+) when building URLs and in test requests.
  * Cookie values don’t quote characters defined in RFC 6265.
  * Include pyi files for datastructures type annotations.
  * Authorization and WWWAuthenticate objects can be compared for equality.
- Update to 2.3.0:
  * Drop support for Python 3.7.
  * Remove previously deprecated code.
  * Passing bytes where strings are expected is deprecated, as well as the
    charset and errors parameters in many places. Anywhere that was annotated,
    documented, or tested to accept bytes shows a warning. Removing this
    artifact of the transition from Python 2 to 3 removes a significant amount
    of overhead in instance checks and encoding cycles. In general, always
    work with UTF-8, the modern HTML, URL, and HTTP standards all strongly
    recommend this.
  * Deprecate the werkzeug.urls module, except for the uri_to_iri and
    iri_to_uri functions. Use the urllib.parse library instead.
  * Update which characters are considered safe when using percent encoding
    in URLs, based on the WhatWG URL Standard.
  * Update which characters are considered safe when using percent encoding
    for Unicode filenames in downloads.
  * Deprecate the safe_conversion parameter of iri_to_uri. The Location header
    is converted to IRI using the same process as everywhere else.
  * Deprecate werkzeug.wsgi.make_line_iter and make_chunk_iter.
  * Use modern packaging metadata with pyproject.toml instead of setup.cfg.
  * Request.get_json() will raise a 415 Unsupported Media Type error if the
    Content-Type header is not application/json, instead of a generic 400.
  * A URL converter’s part_isolating defaults to False if its regex contains
    a /.
  * A custom converter’s regex can have capturing groups without breaking
    the router.
  * The reloader can pick up arguments to python like -X dev, and does not
    require heuristics to determine how to reload the command. Only available
    on Python >= 3.10.
  * The Watchdog reloader ignores file opened events. Bump the minimum version
    of Watchdog to 2.3.0.
  * When using a Unix socket for the development server, the path can start
    with a dot.
  * Increase default work factor for PBKDF2 to 600,000 iterations.
  * parse_options_header is 2-3 times faster. It conforms to RFC 9110, some
    invalid parts that were previously accepted are now ignored.
  * The is_filename parameter to unquote_header_value is deprecated.
  * Deprecate the extra_chars parameter and passing bytes to
    quote_header_value, the allow_token parameter to dump_header, and the cls
    parameter and passing bytes to parse_dict_header.
  * Improve parse_accept_header implementation. Parse according to RFC 9110.
    Discard items with invalid q values.
  * quote_header_value quotes the empty string.
  * dump_options_header skips None values rather than using a bare key.
  * dump_header and dump_options_header will not quote a value if the key ends
    with an asterisk *.
  * parse_dict_header will decode values with charsets.
  * Refactor the Authorization and WWWAuthenticate header data structures.
    + Both classes have type, parameters, and token attributes. The token
      attribute supports auth schemes that use a single opaque token rather
      than key=value parameters, such as Bearer.
    + Neither class is a dict anymore, although they still implement getting,
      setting, and deleting auth[key] and auth.key syntax, as well as
      auth.get(key) and key in auth.
    + Both classes have a from_header class method. parse_authorization_header
      and parse_www_authenticate_header are deprecated.
    + The methods WWWAuthenticate.set_basic and set_digest are deprecated.
      Instead, an instance should be created and assigned to
      response.www_authenticate.
    + A list of instances can be assigned to response.www_authenticate to set
      multiple header values. However, accessing the property only returns the
      first instance.
  * Refactor parse_cookie and dump_cookie.
    + parse_cookie is up to 40% faster, dump_cookie is up to 60% faster.
    + Passing bytes to parse_cookie and dump_cookie is deprecated. The
      dump_cookie charset parameter is deprecated.
    + dump_cookie allows domain values that do not include a dot ., and strips
      off a leading dot.
    + dump_cookie does not set path="/" unnecessarily by default.
  * Refactor the test client cookie implementation.
    + The cookie_jar attribute is deprecated. http.cookiejar is no longer used
      for storage.
    + Domain and path matching is used when sending cookies in requests. The
      domain and path parameters default to localhost and /.
    + Added a get_cookie method to inspect cookies.
    + Cookies have decoded_key and decoded_value attributes to match what the
      app sees rather than the encoded values a client would see.
    + The first positional server_name parameter to set_cookie and
      delete_cookie is deprecated. Use the domain parameter instead.
    + Other parameters to delete_cookie besides domain, path, and value are
      deprecated.
  * If request.max_content_length is set, it is checked immediately when
    accessing the stream, and while reading from the stream in general, rather
    than only during form parsing.
  * The development server, which must not be used in production, will exhaust
    the request stream up to 10GB or 1000 reads. This allows clients to see a
    413 error if max_content_length is exceeded, instead of a “connection
    reset” failure.
  * The development server discards header keys that contain underscores _, as
    they are ambiguous with dashes - in WSGI.
  * secure_filename looks for more Windows reserved file names.
  * Update type annotation for best_match to make default parameter clearer.
  * Multipart parser handles empty fields correctly.
  * The Map charset parameter and Request.url_charset property are deprecated.
    Percent encoding in URLs must always represent UTF-8 bytes. Invalid bytes
    are left percent encoded rather than replaced.
  * The Request.charset, Request.encoding_errors, Response.charset, and
    Client.charset attributes are deprecated. Request and response data must
    always use UTF-8.
  * Header values that have charset information only allow ASCII, UTF-8, and
    ISO-8859-1.
  * Update type annotation for ProfilerMiddleware stream parameter.
  * Use postponed evaluation of annotations.
  * The development server escapes ASCII control characters in decoded URLs
    before logging the request to the terminal.
  * The FormDataParser parse_functions attribute and get_parse_func method,
    and the invalid application/x-url-encoded content type, are deprecated.
  * generate_password_hash supports scrypt. Plain hash methods are deprecated,
    only scrypt and pbkdf2 are supported.

- update to 2.2.3 (bsc#1208283, CVE-2023-25577):
  * drops 0001-limit-the-maximum-number-of-multipart-form-parts.patch 
    in older dists
  * Ensure that URL rules using path converters will redirect
    with strict slashes when the trailing slash is missing.
  * Type signature for ``get_json`` specifies that return type
    is not optional when ``silent=False``.
  * ``parse_content_range_header`` returns ``None`` for a value
    like ``bytes */-1`` where the length is invalid, instead of
    raising an ``AssertionError``.
  * Address remaining ``ResourceWarning`` related to the socket
    used by ``run_simple``.
  * Remove ``prepare_socket``, which now happens when
    creating the server.
  * Update pre-existing headers for ``multipart/form-data``
    requests with the test client.
  * Fix handling of header extended parameters such that they
    are no longer quoted.
  * ``LimitedStream.read`` works correctly when wrapping a
    stream that may not return the requested size in one 
    ``read`` call.
  * A cookie header that starts with ``=`` is treated as an
    empty key and discarded, rather than stripping the leading ``==``.
  * Specify a maximum number of multipart parts, default 1000,
    after which a ``RequestEntityTooLarge`` exception is
    raised on parsing.  This mitigates a DoS attack where a
    larger number of form/file parts would result in disproportionate
    resource use.

Fri Sep  9 15:52:29 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to 2.2.2:
  * Fix router to restore the 2.1 strict_slashes == False behaviour whereby leaf-requests match branch rules and vice versa. #2489
  * Fix router to identify invalid rules rather than hang parsing them, and to correctly parse / within converter arguments. #2489
  * Update subpackage imports in werkzeug.routing to use the import as syntax for explicitly re-exporting public attributes. #2493
  * Parsing of some invalid header characters is more robust. #2494
  * When starting the development server, a warning not to use it in a production deployment is always shown. #2480
  * LocalProxy.__wrapped__ is always set to the wrapped object when the proxy is unbound, fixing an issue in doctest that would cause it to fail. #2485
  * Address one ResourceWarning related to the socket used by run_simple. #2421

- Update to Version 2.2.1:
  * Fix router so that /path/ will match a rule /path if strict slashes mode is disabled for the rule. #2467

  * Fix router static part weighting, so that simpler routes are matched before more complex ones. #2471
  * Restore ValidationError to be importable from werkzeug.routing. #2465

- Update to Version 2.2.0
  * Deprecated get_script_name, get_query_string, peek_path_info, pop_path_info, and extract_path_info. #2461
  * Remove previously deprecated code. #2461
  * Add MarkupSafe as a dependency and use it to escape values when rendering HTML. #2419
  * Added the werkzeug.debug.preserve_context mechanism for restoring context-local data for a request when running code in the debug console. #2439
  * Fix compatibility with Python 3.11 by ensuring that end_lineno and end_col_offset are present on AST nodes. #2425
  * Add a new faster matching router based on a state machine. #2433
  * Fix branch leaf path masking branch paths when strict-slashes is disabled. #1074

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 19 18:54:06 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 2.1.1:
  - ResponseCacheControl.s_maxage converts its value to an int,
    like max_age.
  - Drop support for Python 3.6.
  - Using gevent or eventlet requires greenlet>=1.0 or
    PyPy>=7.3.7. werkzeug.locals and contextvars will not work
    correctly with older versions.
  - Remove previously deprecated code.
     - Remove the non-standard shutdown function from the WSGI
       environ when running the development server. See the docs
       for alternatives.
     - Request and response mixins have all been merged into the
       Request and Response classes.
     - The user agent parser and the useragents module is
       removed. The user_agent module provides an interface that
       can be subclassed to add a parser, such as ua-parser. By
       default it only stores the whole string.
     - The test client returns TestResponse instances and can no
       longer be treated as a tuple. All data is available as
       properties on the response.
     - Remove locals.get_ident and related thread-local code from
       locals, it no longer makes sense when moving to
       a contextvars-based implementation.
     - Remove the python -m werkzeug.serving CLI.
     - The has_key method on some mapping datastructures; use key
       in data instead.
     - Request.disable_data_descriptor is removed, pass
       shallow=True instead.
     - Remove the no_etag parameter from Response.freeze().
     - Remove the HTTPException.wrap class method.
     - Remove the cookie_date function. Use http_date instead.
     - Remove the pbkdf2_hex, pbkdf2_bin, and safe_str_cmp
       functions. Use equivalents in hashlib and hmac modules
       instead.
     - Remove the Href class.
     - Remove the HTMLBuilder class.
     - Remove the invalidate_cached_property function. Use del
       obj.attr instead.
     - Remove bind_arguments and validate_arguments. Use
       Signature.bind() and inspect.signature() instead.
     - Remove detect_utf_encoding, it’s built-in to json.loads.
     - Remove format_string, use string.Template instead.
     - Remove escape and unescape. Use MarkupSafe instead.
    - The multiple parameter of parse_options_header is
      deprecated.
    - Rely on PEP 538 and PEP 540 to handle decoding file names
      with the correct filesystem encoding. The filesystem module
      is removed.
    - Default values passed to Headers are validated the same way
      values added later are.
    - Setting CacheControl int properties, such as max_age, will
      convert the value to an int.
    - Always use socket.fromfd when restarting the dev server.
    - When passing a dict of URL values to Map.build, list values
      do not filter out None or collapse to a single value.
      Passing a MultiDict does collapse single items. This undoes
      a previous change that made it difficult to pass a list, or
      None values in a list, to custom URL converters.
    - run_simple shows instructions for dealing with “address
      already in use” errors, including extra instructions for
      macOS.
    - Extend list of characters considered always safe in URLs
      based on RFC 3986.
    - Optimize the stat reloader to avoid watching unnecessary
      files in more cases. The watchdog reloader is still
      recommended for performance and accuracy.
    - The development server uses Transfer-Encoding: chunked for
      streaming responses when it is configured for HTTP/1.1.
    - The development server uses HTTP/1.1, which enables
      keep-alive connections and chunked streaming responses,
      when threaded or processes is enabled.
    - cached_property works for classes with __slots__ if
      a corresponding _cache_{name} slot is added.
    - Refactor the debugger traceback formatter to use Python’s
      built-in traceback module as much as possible.
    - The TestResponse.text property is a shortcut for
      r.get_data(as_text=True), for convenient testing against
      text instead of bytes.
    - safe_join ensures that the path remains relative if the
      trusted directory is the empty string.
    - Percent-encoded newlines (%0a), which are decoded by WSGI
      servers, are considered when routing instead of terminating
      the match early.
    - The test client doesn’t set duplicate headers for
      CONTENT_LENGTH and CONTENT_TYPE.
    - append_slash_redirect handles PATH_INFO with internal
      slashes.
    - The default status code for append_slash_redirect is 308
      instead of 301. This preserves the request body, and
      matches a previous change to strict_slashes in routing.
    - Fix ValueError: I/O operation on closed file. with the test
      client when following more than one redirect.
    - Response.autocorrect_location_header is disabled by
      default. The Location header URL will remain relative, and
      exclude the scheme and domain, by default.
    - Request.get_json() will raise a 400 BadRequest error if the
      Content-Type header is not application/json. This makes
      a very common source of confusion more visible.
- Add no-network-testing.patch to mark all tests requiring
  network access (so they can be skipped by pytest test runner,
  gh#pallets/werkzeug#2393).

    ``rules`` parameter. :issue:`2183`
  * Add missing type annotation for ``FileStorage.__getattr__``
  * The debugger pin cookie is set with ``SameSite`` set to ``Strict``
    instead of ``None`` to be compatible with modern browser security.
  * Type annotations use ``IO[bytes]`` and ``IO[str]`` instead of
    ``BinaryIO`` and ``TextIO`` for wider type compatibility.
  * Ad-hoc TLS certs are generated with SAN matching CN. :issue:`2158`
  * Fix memory usage for locals when using Python 3.6 or pre 0.4.17

  * Fix setting CSP header options on the response. :pr:`2237`
  * Fix an issue with with the interactive debugger where lines would
    not expand on click for very long tracebacks. :pr:`2239`

    - Fix multipart parsing bug when boundary contains special regex 
      characters. #2125
    - Type checking understands that calling headers.get with a string 
      default will always return a string. #2128
    - If HTTPException.description is not a string, get_description will 
      convert it to a string. #2115
  * Version 2.0.0
    - Drop support for Python 2 and 3.5. #1693
    - Deprecate utils.format_string(), use string.Template instead. #1756
    - Deprecate utils.bind_arguments() and utils.validate_arguments(),
      use Signature.bind() and inspect.signature() instead. #1757
    - Deprecate utils.HTMLBuilder. #1761
    - Deprecate utils.escape() and utils.unescape(), use MarkupSafe instead. #1758
    - Deprecate the undocumented python -m werkzeug.serving CLI. #1834
    - Deprecate the environ["werkzeug.server.shutdown"] function that is 
      available when running the development server. #1752
    - Deprecate the useragents module and the built-in user agent parser. Use 
      a dedicated parser library instead by subclassing user_agent.UserAgent 
      and setting Request.user_agent_class. #2078
    - Remove the unused, internal posixemulation module. #1759
    - All datetime values are timezone-aware with tzinfo=timezone.utc. This 
      applies to anything using http.parse_date: Request.date, 
      .if_modified_since, .if_unmodified_since; Response.date, .expires, 
      .last_modified, .retry_after; parse_if_range_header, and IfRange.date. 
      When comparing values, the other values must also be aware, or these 
      values must be made naive. When passing parameters or setting 
      attributes, naive values are still assumed to be in UTC. #2040
    - Merge all request and response wrapper mixin code into single Request 
      and Response classes. Using the mixin classes is no longer necessary 
      and will show a deprecation warning. Checking isinstance or issubclass 
      against BaseRequest and BaseResponse will show a deprecation warning 
      and check against Request or Response instead. #1963
    - JSON support no longer uses simplejson if it’s installed. To use 
      another JSON module, override Request.json_module and 
      Response.json_module. #1766
    - Response.get_json() no longer caches the result, and the cache 
      parameter is removed. #1698
    - Response.freeze() generates an ETag header if one is not set. The 
      no_etag parameter (which usually wasn’t visible anyway) is no longer 
      used. #1963
    - Add a url_scheme argument to build() to override the bound scheme. #1721
    - Passing an empty list as a query string parameter to build() won’t 
      append an unnecessary ?. Also drop any number of None items in a list. 
      #1992
    - When passing a Headers object to a test client method or 
      EnvironBuilder, multiple values for a key are joined into one comma 
      separated value. This matches the HTTP spec on multi-value headers. 
      #1655
    - Setting Response.status and status_code uses identical parsing and 
      error checking. #1658, #1728
    - MethodNotAllowed and RequestedRangeNotSatisfiable take a response 
      kwarg, consistent with other HTTP errors. #1748
    - The response generated by Unauthorized produces one WWW-Authenticate 
      header per value in www_authenticate, rather than joining them into a 
      single value, to improve interoperability with browsers and other 
      clients. #1755
    - If parse_authorization_header can’t decode the header value, it returns 
      None instead of raising a UnicodeDecodeError. #1816
    - The debugger no longer uses jQuery. #1807
    - The test client includes the query string in REQUEST_URI and RAW_URI. #1781
    - Switch the parameter order of default_stream_factory to match the order 
      used when calling it. #1085
    - Add send_file function to generate a response that serves a file. 
      Adapted from Flask’s implementation. #265, #1850
    - Add send_from_directory function to safely serve an untrusted path 
      within a trusted directory. Adapted from Flask’s implementation. #1880
    - send_file takes download_name, which is passed even if 
      as_attachment=False by using Content-Disposition: inline. download_name 
      replaces Flask’s attachment_filename. #1869
    - send_file sets conditional=True and max_age=None by default. 
      Cache-Control is set to no-cache if max_age is not set, otherwise 
      public. This tells browsers to validate conditional requests instead of 
      using a timed cache. max_age=None replaces Flask’s cache_timeout=43200. 
      #1882
    - send_file can be called with etag="string" to set a custom ETag instead 
      of generating one. etag replaces Flask’s add_etags. #1868
    - send_file sets the Content-Encoding header if an encoding is returned 
      when guessing mimetype from download_name. #3896
    - Update the defaults used by generate_password_hash. Increase PBKDF2 
      iterations to 260000 from 150000. Increase salt length to 16 from 8. 
      Use secrets module to generate salt. #1935
    - The reloader doesn’t crash if sys.stdin is somehow None. #1915
    - Add arguments to delete_cookie to match set_cookie and the attributes 
      modern browsers expect. #1889
    - utils.cookie_date is deprecated, use utils.http_date instead. The value 
      for Set-Cookie expires is no longer “-” delimited. #2040
    - Use request.headers instead of request.environ to look up header attributes. #1808
    - The test Client request methods (client.get, etc.) always return an 
      instance of TestResponse. In addition to the normal behavior of 
      Response, this class provides request with the request that produced 
      the response, and history to track intermediate responses when 
      follow_redirects is used. #763, #1894
    - The test Client request methods takes an auth parameter to add an 
      Authorization header. It can be an Authorization object or a (username, 
      password) tuple for Basic auth. #1809
    - Calling response.close() on a response from the test Client will close 
      the request input stream. This matches file behavior and can prevent a 
      ResourceWarning in some cases. #1785
    - EnvironBuilder.from_environ decodes values encoded for WSGI, to avoid 
      double encoding the new values. #1959
    - The default stat reloader will watch Python files under 
      non-system/virtualenv sys.path entries, which should contain most user 
      code. It will also watch all Python files under directories given in 
      extra_files. #1945
    - The reloader ignores __pycache__ directories again. #1945
    - run_simple takes exclude_patterns a list of fnmatch patterns that will 
      not be scanned by the reloader. #1333
    - Cookie names are no longer unquoted. This was against RFC 6265 and 
      potentially allowed setting __Secure prefixed cookies. #1965
    - Fix some word matches for user agent platform when the word can be a substring. #1923
    - The development server logs ignored SSL errors. #1967
    - Temporary files for form data are opened in rb+ instead of wb+ mode for 
      better compatibility with some libraries. #1961
    - Use SHA-1 instead of MD5 for generating ETags and the debugger pin, and 
      in some tests. MD5 is not available in some environments, such as FIPS 
      140. This may invalidate some caches since the ETag will be different. 
      #1897
    - Add Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy and Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy 
      response header properties. #2008
    - run_simple tries to show a valid IP address when binding to all 
      addresses, instead of 0.0.0.0 or ::. It also warns about not running 
      the development server in production in this case. #1964
    - Colors in the development server log are displayed if Colorama is 
      installed on Windows. For all platforms, style support no longer 
      requires Click. #1832
    - A range request for an empty file (or other data with length 0) will 
      return a 200 response with the empty file instead of a 416 error. #1937
    - New sans-IO base classes for Request and Response have been extracted 
      to contain all the behavior that is not WSGI or IO dependent. These are 
      not a public API, they are part of an ongoing refactor to let ASGI 
      frameworks use Werkzeug. #2005
    - Parsing multipart/form-data has been refactored to use sans-io 
      patterns. This should also make parsing forms with large binary file 
      uploads significantly faster. #1788, #875
    - LocalProxy matches the current Python data model special methods, 
      including all r-ops, in-place ops, and async. __class__ is proxied, so 
      the proxy will look like the object in more cases, including 
      isinstance. Use issubclass(type(obj), LocalProxy) to check if an object 
      is actually a proxy. #1754
    - Local uses ContextVar on Python 3.7+ instead of threading.local. #1778
    - request.values does not include form for GET requests (even though GET 
      bodies are undefined). This prevents bad caching proxies from caching 
      form data instead of query strings. #2037
    - The development server adds the underlying socket to environ as 
      werkzeug.socket. This is non-standard and specific to the dev server, 
      other servers may expose this under their own key. It is useful for 
      handling a WebSocket upgrade request. #2052
    - URL matching assumes websocket=True mode for WebSocket upgrade requests. #2052
    - Updated UserAgentParser to handle more cases. #1971
    - werzeug.DechunkedInput.readinto will not read beyond the size of the buffer. #2021
    - Fix connection reset when exceeding max content size. #2051
    - pbkdf2_hex, pbkdf2_bin, and safe_str_cmp are deprecated. hashlib and 
      hmac provide equivalents. #2083
    - invalidate_cached_property is deprecated. Use del obj.name instead. #2084
    - Href is deprecated. Use werkzeug.routing instead. #2085
    - Request.disable_data_descriptor is deprecated. Create the request with 
      shallow=True instead. #2085
    - HTTPException.wrap is deprecated. Create a subclass manually instead. #2085

Thu Mar 12 06:49:08 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.0:
  * Drop support for Python 3.4. (#1478)
  * Remove code that issued deprecation warnings in version 0.15. (#1477)
  * Remove most top-level attributes provided by the werkzeug module in favor of direct imports. For example, instead of import werkzeug; werkzeug.url_quote, do from werkzeug.urls import url_quote. Install version 0.16 first to see deprecation warnings while upgrading. #2, #1640
  * Added utils.invalidate_cached_property() to invalidate cached properties. (#1474)
  * Directive keys for the Set-Cookie response header are not ignored when parsing the Cookie request header. This allows cookies with names such as “expires” and “version”. (#1495)
  * Request cookies are parsed into a MultiDict to capture all values for cookies with the same key. cookies[key] returns the first value rather than the last. Use cookies.getlist(key) to get all values. parse_cookie also defaults to a MultiDict. #1562, #1458
  * Add charset=utf-8 to an HTTP exception response’s CONTENT_TYPE header. (#1526)
  * The interactive debugger handles outer variables in nested scopes such as lambdas and comprehensions. #913, #1037, #1532
  * The user agent for Opera 60 on Mac is correctly reported as “opera” instead of “chrome”. #1556
  * The platform for Crosswalk on Android is correctly reported as “android” instead of “chromeos”. (#1572)
  * Issue a warning when the current server name does not match the configured server name. #760
  * A configured server name with the default port for a scheme will match the current server name without the port if the current scheme matches. #1584
  * InternalServerError has a original_exception attribute that frameworks can use to track the original cause of the error. #1590
  * Headers are tested for equality independent of the header key case, such that X-Foo is the same as x-foo. #1605
  * http.dump_cookie() accepts 'None' as a value for samesite. #1549
  * set_cookie() accepts a samesite argument. #1705
  * Support the Content Security Policy header through the Response.content_security_policy data structure. #1617
  * LanguageAccept will fall back to matching “en” for “en-US” or “en-US” for “en” to better support clients or translations that only match at the primary language tag. #450, #1507
  * MIMEAccept uses MIME parameters for specificity when matching. #458, #1574
  * If the development server is started with an SSLContext configured to verify client certificates, the certificate in PEM format will be available as environ["SSL_CLIENT_CERT"]. #1469
  * is_resource_modified will run for methods other than GET and HEAD, rather than always returning False. #409
  * SharedDataMiddleware returns 404 rather than 500 when trying to access a directory instead of a file with the package loader. The dependency on setuptools and pkg_resources is removed. #1599
  * Add a response.cache_control.immutable flag. Keep in mind that browser support for this Cache-Control header option is still experimental and may not be implemented. #1185
  * Optional request log highlighting with the development server is handled by Click instead of termcolor. #1235
  * Optional ad-hoc TLS support for the development server is handled by cryptography instead of pyOpenSSL. #1555
  * FileStorage.save() supports pathlib and PEP 519 PathLike objects. #1653
  * The debugger security pin is unique in containers managed by Podman. #1661
  * Building a URL when host_matching is enabled takes into account the current host when there are duplicate endpoints with different hosts. #488
  * The 429 TooManyRequests and 503 ServiceUnavailable HTTP exceptions takes a retry_after parameter to set the Retry-After header. #1657
  * Map and Rule have a merge_slashes option to collapse multiple slashes into one, similar to how many HTTP servers behave. This is enabled by default. #1286, #1694
  * Add HTTP 103, 208, 306, 425, 506, 508, and 511 to the list of status codes. #1678
  * Add update, setlist, and setlistdefault methods to the Headers data structure. extend method can take MultiDict and kwargs. #1687, #1697
  * The development server accepts paths that start with two slashes, rather than stripping off the first path segment. #491
  * Add access control (Cross Origin Request Sharing, CORS) header properties to the Request and Response wrappers. #1699
  * Accept values are no longer ordered alphabetically for equal quality tags. Instead the initial order is preserved. #1686
  * Added Map.lock_class attribute for alternative implementations. #1702
  * Support matching and building WebSocket rules in the routing system, for use by async frameworks. #1709
  * Range requests that span an entire file respond with 206 instead of 200, to be more compliant with RFC 7233. This may help serving media to older browsers. #410, #1704
  * The SharedDataMiddleware default fallback_mimetype is application/octet-stream. If a filename looks like a text mimetype, the utf-8 charset is added to it. This matches the behavior of BaseResponse and Flask’s send_file(). #1689

Wed Jan  3 23:07:03 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 0.14.1:
  * Resolved a regression with status code handling in the integrated
    development server.

- changes from version 0.14:
  * HTTP exceptions are now automatically caught by
    Request.application.
  * Added support for edge as browser.
  * Added support for platforms that lack SpooledTemporaryFile.
  * Add support for etag handling through if-match
  * Added support for the SameSite cookie attribute.
  * Added werkzeug.wsgi.ProxyMiddleware
  * Implemented has for NullCache
  * get_multi on cache clients now returns lists all the time.
  * Improved the watchdog observer shutdown for the reloader to not
    crash on exit on older Python versions.
  * Added support for filename* filename attributes according to RFC
    2231
  * Resolved an issue where machine ID for the reloader PIN was not
    read accurately on windows.
  * Added a workaround for syntax errors in init files in the
    reloader.
  * Added support for using the reloader with console scripts on
    windows.
  * The built-in HTTP server will no longer close a connection in
    cases where no HTTP body is expected (204, 204, HEAD requests
    etc.)
  * The EnvironHeaders object now skips over empty content type and
    lengths if they are set to falsy values.
  * Werkzeug will no longer send the content-length header on 1xx or
    204/304 responses.
  * Cookie values are now also permitted to include slashes and equal
    signs without quoting.
  * Relaxed the regex for the routing converter arguments.
  * If cookies are sent without values they are now assumed to have an
    empty value and the parser accepts this. Previously this could
    have corrupted cookies that followed the value.
  * The test Client and EnvironBuilder now support mimetypes like the
    request object does.
  * Added support for static weights in URL rules.
  * Better handle some more complex reloader scenarios where sys.path
    contained non directory paths.
  * EnvironHeaders no longer raises weird errors if non string keys
    are passed to it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  8 18:07:40 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * added CHANGES.rst and README.rst to %doc section

- update to version 0.13:
  * Deprecate support for Python 2.6 and 3.3. CI tests will not run
    for these versions, and support will be dropped completely in the
    next version. (pallets/meta#24)
  * Raise TypeError when port is not an integer. (#1088)
  * Fully deprecate werkzeug.script. Use Click instead. (#1090)
  * response.age is parsed as a timedelta. Previously, it was
    incorrectly treated as a datetime. The header value is an integer
    number of seconds, not a date string. (#414)
  * Fix a bug in TypeConversionDict where errors are not propagated
    when using the converter. (#1102)
  * Authorization.qop is a string instead of a set, to comply with RFC
    2617. (#984)
  * An exception is raised when an encoded cookie is larger than, by
    default, 4093 bytes. Browsers may silently ignore cookies larger
    than this. BaseResponse has a new attribute max_cookie_size and
    dump_cookie has a new argument max_size to configure this. (#780,
    #1109)
  * Fix a TypeError in
    werkzeug.contrib.lint.GuardedIterator.close. (#1116)
  * BaseResponse.calculate_content_length now correctly works for
    Unicode responses on Python 3. It first encodes using
    iter_encoded. (#705)
  * Secure cookie contrib works with string secret key on Python
    3. (#1205)
  * Shared data middleware accepts a list instead of a dict of static
    locations to preserve lookup order. (#1197)
  * HTTP header values without encoding can contain single
    quotes. (#1208)
  * The built-in dev server supports receiving requests with chunked
    transfer encoding. (#1198)

Thu Sep 15 23:08:05 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- update to version 0.11.11:
  * Fix JSONRequestMixin for Python3. See #731
  * Fix broken string handling in test client when passing
    integers. See #852
  * Fix a bug in "parse_options_header" where an invalid content type
    starting with comma or semi-colon would result in an invalid
    return value, see issue "#995".
  * Fix a bug in multidicts when passing empty lists as values, see
    issue "#979".
  * Fix a security issue that allows XSS on the Werkzeug debugger. See
    "#1001".
- update to version 0.11.10:
  * Fixed a bug that occurs when running on Python 2.6 and using a
    broken locale.  See pull request #912.
  * Fixed a crash when running the debugger on Google App Engine. See
    issue #925.
  * Fixed an issue with multipart parsing that could cause memory
    exhaustion.
- Update to 0.11.9
  - Corrected an issue that caused the debugger not to use the
    machine GUID on POSIX systems.
  - Corrected an Unicode error on Python 3 for the debugger's
    PIN usage.
  - Corrected the timestamp verification in the pin debug code.
    Without this fix the pin was remebered until too long.
- update to version 0.11.8:
  * fixed a problem with the machine GUID detection code on OS X on
    Python 3.
- changes from version 0.11.7:
  * fixed a regression on Python 3 for the debugger.
- changes from version 0.11.6:
  * werkzeug.serving: Still show the client address on bad requests.

    harder to brute force via trying cookies.  Please keep in mind
    that the debugger *is not intended for running on production
    environments*
  * increased the pin timeout to a week to make it less annoying for
    people which should decrease the change that users disable the pin
    check entirely.
  * werkzeug.serving: Fix broken HTTP_HOST when path starts with
    double slash.
- update to version 0.11.5:
  * werkzeug.serving: Fix crash when attempting SSL connection to HTTP
    server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 13:01:58 UTC 2016 - aplanas@suse.com

- Add 0001_create_a_thread_to_reap_death_process.patch
  Fixes bsc#954591

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 12:35:28 UTC 2016 - aplanas@suse.com

- update to 0.11.3:
  - Added reloader_paths option to run_simple and other functions in
    werkzeug.serving. This allows the user to completely override the
    Python module watching of Werkzeug with custom paths.
  - Many custom cached properties of Werkzeug’s classes are now
    subclasses of Python’s property type (issue #616).
  - bind_to_environ now doesn’t differentiate between implicit and
    explicit default port numbers in HTTP_HOST (pull request #204).
  - BuildErrors are now more informative. They come with a complete
    sentence as error message, and also provide suggestions (pull
    request #691).
  - Fix a bug in the user agent parser where Safari’s build number
    instead of version would be extracted (pull request #703).
  - Fixed issue where RedisCache set_many was broken for twemproxy,
    which doesn’t support the default MULTI command (pull request
    #702).
  - mimetype parameters on request and response classes are now always
    converted to lowercase.
  - Changed cache so that cache never expires if timeout is 0. This
    also fixes an issue with redis setex (issue #550)
  - Werkzeug now assumes UTF-8 as filesystem encoding on Unix if
    Python detected it as ASCII.
  - New optional has method on caches.
  - Fixed various bugs in parse_options_header (pull request #643).
  - If the reloader is enabled the server will now open the socket in
    the parent process if this is possible. This means that when the
    reloader kicks in the connection from client will wait instead of
    tearing down. This does not work on all Python versions.
  - Implemented PIN based authentication for the debugger. This can
    optionally be disabled but is discouraged. This change was
    necessary as it has been discovered that too many people run the
    debugger in production.
  - Devserver no longer requires SSL module to be installed.
  - Reloader: Correctly detect file changes made by moving temporary
    files over the original, which is e.g. the case with PyCharm (pull
    request #722).
  - Fix bool behavior of werkzeug.datastructures.ETags under Python 3
    (issue #744).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 22 14:22:45 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 0.10.4:
  - Re-release of 0.10.3 with packaging artifacts manually removed.
  - Re-release of 0.10.2 without packaging artifacts.
  - Fixed issue where ``empty`` could break third-party libraries that relied on
    keyword arguments (pull request ``#675``)
  - Improved ``Rule.empty`` by providing a ```get_empty_kwargs`` to allow setting
    custom kwargs without having to override entire ``empty`` method. (pull
    request ``#675``)
   - Fixed ```extra_files``` parameter for reloader to not cause startup
     to crash when included in server params
   - Using `MultiDict` when building URLs is now not supported again. The behavior
     introduced several regressions.
   - Fix performance problems with stat-reloader (pull request ``#715``).
   - Fixed regression with multiple query values for URLs (pull request ``#667``).
   - Fix issues with eventlet's monkeypatching and the builtin server (pull
     request ``#663``).
   - Changed the error handling of and improved testsuite for the caches in
     ``contrib.cache``.
   - Fixed a bug on Python 3 when creating adhoc ssl contexts, due to `sys.maxint`
     not being defined.
   - Fixed a bug on Python 3, that caused
     :func:`~werkzeug.serving.make_ssl_devcert` to fail with an exception.
   - Added exceptions for 504 and 505.
   - Added support for ChromeOS detection.
   - Added UUID converter to the routing system.
   - Added message that explains how to quit the server.
   - Fixed a bug on Python 2, that caused ``len`` for
     :class:`werkzeug.datastructures.CombinedMultiDict` to crash.
   - Added support for stdlib pbkdf2 hmac if a compatible digest
     is found.
   - Ported testsuite to use ``py.test``.
   - Minor optimizations to various middlewares (pull requests ``#496`` and
     ``#571``).
   - Use stdlib ``ssl`` module instead of ``OpenSSL`` for the builtin server
     (issue ``#434``). This means that OpenSSL contexts are not supported anymore,
     but instead ``ssl.SSLContext`` from the stdlib.
   - Allow protocol-relative URLs when building external URLs.
   - Fixed Atom syndication to print time zone offset for tz-aware datetime
     objects (pull request ``#254``).
   - Improved reloader to track added files and to recover from broken
     sys.modules setups with syntax errors in packages.
   - ``cache.RedisCache`` now supports arbitrary ``**kwargs`` for the redis
     object.
   - ``werkzeug.test.Client`` now uses the original request method when resolving
     307 redirects (pull request ``#556``).
   - ``werkzeug.datastructures.MIMEAccept`` now properly deals with mimetype
     parameters (pull request ``#205``).
   - ``werkzeug.datastructures.Accept`` now handles a quality of ``0`` as
     intolerable, as per RFC 2616 (pull request ``#536``).
   - ``werkzeug.urls.url_fix`` now properly encodes hostnames with ``idna``
     encoding (issue ``#559``). It also doesn't crash on malformed URLs anymore
     (issue ``#582``).
   - ``werkzeug.routing.MapAdapter.match`` now recognizes the difference between
     the path ``/`` and an empty one (issue ``#360``).
   - The interactive debugger now tries to decode non-ascii filenames (issue
     ``#469``).
   - Increased default key size of generated SSL certificates to 1024 bits (issue
     ``#611``).
   - Added support for specifying a ``Response`` subclass to use when calling
     :func:`~werkzeug.utils.redirect`\ .
   - ``werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder`` now doesn't use the request method anymore
     to guess the content type, and purely relies on the ``form``, ``files`` and
   ``input_stream`` properties (issue ``#620``).
   - Added Symbian to the user agent platform list.
   - Fixed make_conditional to respect automatically_set_content_length
   - Unset ``Content-Length`` when writing to response.stream (issue ``#451``)
   - ``wrappers.Request.method`` is now always uppercase, eliminating
     inconsistencies of the WSGI environment (issue ``647``).
   - ``routing.Rule.empty`` now works correctly with subclasses of ``Rule`` (pull
     request ``#645``).
   - Made map updating safe in light of concurrent updates.
   - Allow multiple values for the same field for url building (issue ``#658``).
   - Fix unicode problems in ``werkzeug.debug.tbtools``.
   - Fix Python 3-compatibility problems in ``werkzeug.posixemulation``.
   - Backport fix of fatal typo for ``ImmutableList`` (issue ``#492``).
   - Make creation of the cache dir for ``FileSystemCache`` atomic (issue
     ``#468``).
   - Use native strings for memcached keys to work with Python 3 client (issue
     ``#539``).
   - Fix charset detection for ``werkzeug.debug.tbtools.Frame`` objects (issues
     ``#547`` and ``#532``).
   - Fix ``AttributeError`` masking in ``werkzeug.utils.import_string`` (issue
     ``#182``).
   - Explicitly shut down server (issue ``#519``).
   - Fix timeouts greater than 2592000 being misinterpreted as UNIX timestamps in
     ``werkzeug.contrib.cache.MemcachedCache`` (issue ``#533``).
   - Fix bug where ``werkzeug.exceptions.abort`` would raise an arbitrary subclass
     of the expected class (issue ``#422``).
   - Fix broken ``jsrouting`` (due to removal of ``werkzeug.templates``)
   - ``werkzeug.urls.url_fix`` now doesn't crash on malformed URLs anymore, but
     returns them unmodified. This is a cheap workaround for ``#582``, the proper
     fix is included in version 0.10.
   - The repr of ``werkzeug.wrappers.Request`` doesn't crash on non-ASCII-values
     anymore (pull request ``#466``).
   - Fix bug in ``cache.RedisCache`` when combined with ``redis.StrictRedis``
     object (pull request ``#583``).
   - The ``qop`` parameter for ``WWW-Authenticate`` headers is now always quoted,
     as required by RFC 2617 (issue ``#633``).
   - Fix bug in ``werkzeug.contrib.cache.SimpleCache`` with Python 3 where add/set 
     may throw an exception when pruning old entries from the cache (pull request
     ``#651``).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 18 15:06:30 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 0.9.6
  - Added a safe conversion for IRI to URI conversion and use that
    internally to work around issues with spec violations for
    protocols such as ``itms-service``.
- Update to 0.9.5
  - Forward charset argument from request objects to the environ
    builder.
  - Fixed error handling for missing boundaries in multipart data.
  - Fixed session creation on systems without ``os.urandom()``.
  - Fixed pluses in dictionary keys not being properly URL encoded.
  - Fixed a problem with deepcopy not working for multi dicts.
  - Fixed a double quoting issue on redirects.
  - Fixed a problem with unicode keys appearing in headers on 2.x.
  - Fixed a bug with unicode strings in the test builder.
  - Fixed a unicode bug on Python 3 in the WSGI profiler.
  - Fixed an issue with the safe string compare function on
    Python 2.7.7 and Python 3.4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 24 11:17:13 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Require python-setuptools instead of distribute (upstreams merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  3 08:12:07 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.9.4:
  - Fixed an issue with Python 3.3 and an edge case in cookie parsing.
  - Fixed decoding errors not handled properly through the WSGI
    decoding dance.
  - Fixed URI to IRI conversion incorrectly decoding percent signs.
  - Restored beahvior of the ``data`` descriptor of the request class to pre 0.9
    behavior.  This now also means that ``.data`` and ``.get_data()`` have
    different behavior.  New code should use ``.get_data()`` always.

    In addition to that there is now a flag for the ``.get_data()`` method that
    controls what should happen with form data parsing and the form parser will
    honor cached data.  This makes dealing with custom form data more consistent.
  - Added `unsafe` parameter to :func:`~werkzeug.urls.url_quote`.
  - Fixed an issue with :func:`~werkzeug.urls.url_quote_plus` not quoting
    `'+'` correctly.
  - Ported remaining parts of :class:`~werkzeug.contrib.RedisCache` to
    Python 3.3.
  - Ported remaining parts of :class:`~werkzeug.contrib.MemcachedCache` to
    Python 3.3
  - Fixed a deprecation warning in the contrib atom module.
  - Fixed a regression with setting of content types through the
    headers dictionary instead with the content type parameter.
  - Use correct name for stdlib secure string comparision function.
  - Fixed a wrong reference in the docstring of
    :func:`~werkzeug.local.release_local`.
  - Fixed an `AttributeError` that sometimes occurred when accessing the
    :attr:`werkzeug.wrappers.BaseResponse.is_streamed` attribute.
  - Fixed an issue with integers no longer being accepted in certain
    parts of the routing system or URL quoting functions.
  - Fixed an issue with `url_quote` not producing the right escape
    codes for single digit codepoints.
  - Fixed an issue with :class:`~werkzeug.wsgi.SharedDataMiddleware` not
    reading the path correctly and breaking on etag generation in some
    cases.
  - Properly handle `Expect: 100-continue` in the development server
    to resolve issues with curl.
  - Automatically exhaust the input stream on request close.  This should
    fix issues where not touching request files results in a timeout.
  - Fixed exhausting of streams not doing anything if a non-limited
    stream was passed into the multipart parser.
  - Raised the buffer sizes for the multipart parser.
  - Added support for :meth:`~werkzeug.wsgi.LimitedStream.tell`
    on the limited stream.
  - :class:`~werkzeug.datastructures.ETags` now is nonzero if it
    contains at least one etag of any kind, including weak ones.
  - Added a workaround for a bug in the stdlib for SSL servers.
  - Improved SSL interface of the devserver so that it can generate
    certificates easily and load them from files.
  - Refactored test client to invoke the open method on the class
    for redirects.  This makes subclassing more powerful.
  - :func:`werkzeug.wsgi.make_chunk_iter` and
    :func:`werkzeug.wsgi.make_line_iter` now support processing of
    iterators and streams.
  - URL generation by the routing system now no longer quotes
    ``+``.
  - URL fixing now no longer quotes certain reserved characters.
  - The :func:`werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash` and
    check functions now support any of the hashlib algorithms.
  - `wsgi.get_current_url` is now ascii safe for browsers sending
    non-ascii data in query strings.
  - improved parsing behavior for :func:`werkzeug.http.parse_options_header`
  - added more operators to local proxies.
  - added a hook to override the default converter in the routing
    system.
  - The description field of HTTP exceptions is now always escaped.
    Use markup objects to disable that.
  - Added number of proxy argument to the proxy fix to make it more
    secure out of the box on common proxy setups.  It will by default
    no longer trust the x-forwarded-for header as much as it did
    before.
  - Added support for fragment handling in URI/IRI functions.
  - Added custom class support for :func:`werkzeug.http.parse_dict_header`.
  - Renamed `LighttpdCGIRootFix` to `CGIRootFix`.
  - Always treat `+` as safe when fixing URLs as people love misusing them.
  - Added support to profiling into directories in the contrib profiler.
  - The escape function now by default escapes quotes.
  - Changed repr of exceptions to be less magical.
  - Simplified exception interface to no longer require environmnts
    to be passed to recieve the response object.
  - Added sentinel argument to IterIO objects.
  - Added pbkdf2 support for the security module.
  - Added a plain request type that disables all form parsing to only
    leave the stream behind.
  - Removed support for deprecated `fix_headers`.
  - Removed support for deprecated `header_list`.
  - Removed support for deprecated parameter for `iter_encoded`.
  - Removed support for deprecated non-silent usage of the limited
    stream object.
  - Removed support for previous dummy `writable` parameter on
    the cached property.
  - Added support for explicitly closing request objects to close
    associated resources.
  - Conditional request handling or access to the data property on responses no
    longer ignores direct passthrough mode.
  - Removed werkzeug.templates and werkzeug.contrib.kickstart.
  - Changed host lookup logic for forwarded hosts to allow lists of
    hosts in which case only the first one is picked up.
  - Added `wsgi.get_query_string`, `wsgi.get_path_info` and
    `wsgi.get_script_name` and made the `wsgi.pop_path_info` and
    `wsgi.peek_path_info` functions perform unicode decoding.  This
    was necessary to avoid having to expose the WSGI encoding dance
    on Python 3.
  - Added `content_encoding` and `content_md5` to the request object's
    common request descriptor mixin.
  - added `options` and `trace` to the test client.
  - Overhauled the utilization of the input stream to be easier to use
    and better to extend.  The detection of content payload on the input
    side is now more compliant with HTTP by detecting off the content
    type header instead of the request method.  This also now means that
    the stream property on the request class is always available instead
    of just when the parsing fails.
  - Added support for using :class:`werkzeug.wrappers.BaseResponse` in a with
    statement.
  - Changed `get_app_iter` to fetch the response early so that it does not
    fail when wrapping a response iterable.  This makes filtering easier.
  - Introduced `get_data` and `set_data` methods for responses.
  - Introduced `get_data` for requests.
  - Soft deprecated the `data` descriptors for request and response objects.
  - Added `as_bytes` operations to some of the headers to simplify working
    with things like cookies.
  - Made the debugger paste tracebacks into github's gist service as
    private pastes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 12 21:35:29 UTC 2012 - saschpe@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.8.3:
  - Fixed another issue with :func:`werkzeug.wsgi.make_line_iter`
    where lines longer than the buffer size were not handled
    properly.
  - Restore stdout after debug console finished executing so
    that the debugger can be used on GAE better.
  - Fixed a bug with the redis cache for int subclasses
    (affects bool caching).
  - Fixed an XSS problem with redirect targets coming from
    untrusted sources.
- Changes from version 0.8.2:
  - Fixed a problem with request handling of the builtin server
    not repsonding to socket errors properly.
  - The routing request redirect exception's code attribute is now
    used properly.
  - Fixed a bug with shutdowns on Windows.
  - Fixed a few unicode issues with non-ascii characters being
    hardcoded in URL rules.
  - Fixed two property docstrings being assigned to fdel instead
    of ``__doc__``.
  - Fixed an issue where CRLF line endings could be split into two
    by the line iter function, causing problems with multipart file
    uploads.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 10 11:07:11 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 0.8.1:
  * Fixed an issue with the memcache not working properly.
  * Fixed an issue for Python 2.7.1 and higher that broke
    copying of multidicts with :func:`copy.copy`.
  * Changed hashing methodology of immutable ordered multi dicts
    for a potential problem with alternative Python implementations.
- Changes from version 0.8:
  * Removed data structure specific KeyErrors for a general
    purpose :exc:`~werkzeug.exceptions.BadRequestKeyError`.
  * Documented :meth:`werkzeug.wrappers.BaseRequest._load_form_data`.
  * The routing system now also accepts strings instead of
    dictionaries for the `query_args` parameter since we're only
    passing them through for redirects.
  * Werkzeug now automatically sets the content length immediately when
    the :attr:`~werkzeug.wrappers.BaseResponse.data` attribute is set
    for efficiency and simplicity reasons.
  * The routing system will now normalize server names to lowercase.
  * The routing system will no longer raise ValueErrors in case the
    configuration for the server name was incorrect.  This should make
    deployment much easier because you can ignore that factor now.
  * Fixed a bug with parsing HTTP digest headers.  It rejected headers
    with missing nc and nonce params.
  * Proxy fix now also updates wsgi.url_scheme based on X-Forwarded-Proto.
  * Added support for key prefixes to the redis cache.
  * Added the ability to supress some auto corrections in the wrappers
    that are now controlled via `autocorrect_location_header` and
    `automatically_set_content_length` on the response objects.
  * Werkzeug now uses a new method to check that the length of incoming
    data is complete and will raise IO errors by itself if the server
    fails to do so.
  * :func:`~werkzeug.wsgi.make_line_iter` now requires a limit that is
    not higher than the length the stream can provide.
  * Refactored form parsing into a form parser class that makes it possible
    to hook into individual parts of the parsing process for debugging and
    extending.
  * For conditional responses the content length is no longer set when it
    is already there and added if missing.
  * Immutable datastructures are hashable now.
  * Headers datastructure no longer allows newlines in values to avoid
    header injection attacks.
  * Made it possible through subclassing to select a different remote
    addr in the proxy fix.
  * Added stream based URL decoding.  This reduces memory usage on large
    transmitted form data that is URL decoded since Werkzeug will no longer
    load all the unparsed data into memory.
  * Memcache client now no longer uses the buggy cmemcache module and
    supports pylibmc.  GAE is not tried automatically and the dedicated
    class is no longer necessary.
  * Redis cache now properly serializes data.
  * Removed support for Python 2.4
- Changes from version 0.7.2:
  * Fixed a CSRF problem with the debugger.
  * The debugger is now generating private pastes on lodgeit.
  * If URL maps are now bound to environments the query arguments
    are properly decoded from it for redirects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 27 09:31:46 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

    internal server error on weird paths when loading via pkg_resources.
  * fixed an URL generation bug that caused URLs to be invalid if a
    generated component contains a colon.

    packages properly.
  * disabled automatic socket swiching for IPv6 on the development
    server due to problems it caused.
  * Werkzeug no longer overrides the Date header when creating a
    conditional HTTP response.

    methods for a given path.
  * The routing system now accepts a parameter to change the encoding
    error behaviour.
  * The local manager can now accept custom ident functions in the
    constructor that are forwarded to the wrapped local objects.
  * url_unquote_plus now accepts unicode strings again.
  * fixed an issues with the filesystem session support's prune
    function and concurrent usage.
  * fixed a problem with external URL generation discarding the port.
  * added support for pylibmc to the Werkzeug cache abstraction layer.
  * fixed an issue with the new multipart parser that happened when
    a linkebreak happend to be on the chunk limit.
  * cookies are now set properly if ports are in use.  A runtime error
    is raised if one tries to set a cookie for a domain without a dot.
  * fixed an issue with Template.from_file not working for file
    descriptors.
  * reloader can now use inotify to track reloads.  This requires the
    pyinotify library to be installed.
