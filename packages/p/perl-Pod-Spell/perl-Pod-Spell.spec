%description
Pod::Spell is a Pod formatter whose output is good for spellchecking.
Pod::Spell is rather like Pod::Text, except that it doesn't put much effort
into actual formatting, and it suppresses things that look like Perl
symbols or Perl jargon (so that your spellchecking program won't complain
about mystery words like "'$thing'" or "'Foo::Bar'" or "hashref").

This class works by filtering out words that look like Perl or any form of
computerese (like "'$thing'" or "'N>7'" or "'@{$foo}{'bar','baz'}'",
anything in C<...> or F<...> codes, anything in verbatim paragraphs (code
blocks), and anything in the stopword list. The default stopword list for a
document starts out from the stopword list defined by Pod::Wordlist, and
can be supplemented (on a per-document basis) by having '"=for stopwords"'
/ '"=for :stopwords"' region(s) in a document.
