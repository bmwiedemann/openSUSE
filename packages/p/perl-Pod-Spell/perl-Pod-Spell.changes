- updated to 1.20
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Pod-Spell/Changes

  1.20      2016-04-22
  	- Stable release, made in Rugby, UK during Perl QA Hackathon 2016
  
  1.19_91   2016-04-21
  	- Drop use of File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir (GitHub #26). Thanks Kent
  	  Fredric!
  	- Allow stop words with '.' (GitHub #28). Thanks Paulo Custodio!
  
  1.19_90   2016-02-20
  	- Hide internals: the POD parser is moved to a private package and
  	  the Pod::Spell package now only exposes the public interface.
  	  This is a first step towards rewriting the parser using Pod::Simple
  	  (planned for Pod-Spell-2.0).
  	- 'parse_from_file' and 'parse_from_filehandle' are now explicitely
  	  documented (by copying doc from Pod::Parser).

Fri Oct  4 09:12:10 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.10
        [FEATURES]
        - added 'no_wide_chars' option to strip words with such characters
          from the output.  This may help spellcheckers that can't cope
          with UTF-8
        [CHANGED]
        - improved punctuation stripping algorithm for better word
          isolation (example C<< "hello". >> now is found as "hello")
        - strips all word that do not have at least one \w character
          as a spellchecker isn't likely to do anything useful with them
        [DOCUMENTED]
        - added recommendations for dealing with character encoding
 
 1.09      2013-09-25
        [FIXED]
        - stopwords with 's are learned without 's to match how they are
          checked
        [CHANGED]
        - leading and trailing punctuation is entirely stripped since the
          spellchecker won't care anyway.  Trailing periods are *not*
          stripped as they might be abbreviations ("Ph.D."), but such words
          are checked against the stoplist both with and without
          trailing periods to account for abbreviations and words at the
          end of a sentence.
 
 1.08      2013-09-24
        [FIXED]
        - hyphenated word parts are also checked against the stoplist
          and stripped (dagolden) GH #9
        [DOCUMENTED]
        - noted that stopwords must be added before words appear in Pod
 
 1.07      2013-09-14
        - add many words
        [FEATURES]
        - Pod::Wordlist is an Object ( dagolden )
        - Lingua::EN::Inflect is used to reduce requiring plurals in the list
          ( dagolden )
        - the wordlist is now a sharedir file
        [DEPRECATED]
        - accessing %Pod::Wordlist::Wordlist directly
 
 1.06      2013-09-08
        - import stopwords from Pod::Wordlist::hanekomu except names
