%description
JSON-RPC 2.0 and JSON-RPC 1.0 transport specification implementation.

This implementation does not have any transport functionality
realization, only protocol. Any client or server implementation is
easy based on current code, but requires transport libraries, such as
requests, gevent or zmq.
