  <title>A perl-specific System for writing Asynchronous web Apps</title>
  <description>CGI::Ajax is an object-oriented module that provides a unique mechanism for
using perl code asynchronously from javascript- enhanced HTML pages.
CGI::Ajax unburdens the user from having to write extensive javascript,
except for associating an exported method with a document-defined event
(such as onClick, onKeyUp, etc). CGI::Ajax also mixes well with HTML
containing more complex javascript.

CGI::Ajax supports methods that return single results or multiple results
to the web page, and supports returning values to multiple DIV elements on
the HTML page.

Using CGI::Ajax, the URL for the HTTP GET/POST request is automatically
generated based on HTML layout and events, and the page is then dynamically
updated with the output from the perl function. Additionally, CGI::Ajax
supports mapping URL's to a CGI::Ajax function name, so you can separate
your code processing over multiple scripts.

Other than using the Class::Accessor module to generate CGI::Ajax' accessor
methods, CGI::Ajax is completely self-contained - it does not require you
to install a larger package or a full Content Management System, etc.

We have added _support_ for other CGI handler/decoder modules, like the
CGI::Simple manpage or the CGI::Minimal manpage, but we can't test these
since we run mod_perl2 only here. CGI::Ajax checks to see if a header()
method is available to the CGI object, and then uses it. If method() isn't
available, it creates it's own minimal header.

A primary goal of CGI::Ajax is to keep the module streamlined and maximally
flexible. We are trying to keep the generated javascript code to a minimum,
but still provide users with a variety of methods for deploying CGI::Ajax.
And VERY little user javascript.</description>
