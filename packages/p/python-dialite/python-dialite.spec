%description
Dialite is a pure Python package to show dialogs. It provides a
handful of functions, each a verb, that can be used to inform(),
warn() or fail() the user, or to ask_ok(), ask_retry() or
ask_yesno().

Dialite can show graphical dialogs, and falls back to a terminal
interface if dialogs are unavailable (e.g. if not supported by the
platform, or for SSH connections).
