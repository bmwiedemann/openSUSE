-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 22 16:06:25 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Drop deprecated setup.py installmethod, bootstrap PEP517 with
  built-in pip instead
- python3XX-pip-wheel can now be a regular subpackage
- Drop obsolete python2 directives in specfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 18 14:18:45 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 23.3.2:
  * Fix a bug in extras handling for link requirements (`#12372
  * Fix mercurial revision "parse error": use ``--rev={ref}``
    instead of ``-r={ref}`` (`#12373

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 21 10:38:00 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 23.3.1:
  - Bug Fixes
    - Handle a timezone indicator of Z when parsing dates in the
      self check. (#12338)
    - Fix bug where installing the same package at the same time
      with multiple pip processes could fail. (#12361)
- Update to 23.3:
  - Process
    - Added reference to vulnerability reporting guidelines to
      pip's security policy.
  - Features
    - Improve extras resolution for multiple constraints on same
      base package. (#11924)
    - Improve use of datastructures to make candidate selection
      1.6x faster. (#12204)
    - Allow pip install --dry-run to use platform and ABI
      overriding options. (#12215)
    - Add is_yanked boolean entry to the installation report
      (--report) to indicate whether the requirement was yanked
      from the index, but was still selected by pip conform to
      PEP 592. (#12224)
  - Bug Fixes
    - Ignore errors in temporary directory cleanup (show a
      warning instead). (#11394)
    - Normalize extras according to PEP 685 from package metadata
      in the resolver for comparison. This ensures extras are
      correctly compared and merged as long as the package
      providing the extra(s) is built with values normalized
      according to the standard. Note, however, that this
      does not solve cases where the package itself contains
      unnormalized extra values in the metadata. (#11649)
    - Prevent downloading sdists twice when PEP 658 metadata is
      present. (#11847)
    - Include all requested extras in the install report
      (--report). (#11924)
    - Removed uses of datetime.datetime.utcnow from non-vendored
      code. (#12005)
    - Consistently report whether a dependency comes from an
      extra. (#12095)
    - Fix completion script for zsh (#12166)
    - Fix improper handling of the new onexc argument of
      shutil.rmtree() in Python 3.12. (#12187)
    - Filter out yanked links from the available versions
      error message: "(from versions: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)" will
      not contain yanked versions conform PEP 592. The yanked
      versions (if any) will be mentioned in a separate error
      message. (#12225)
    - Fix crash when the git version number contains something
      else than digits and dots. (#12280)
    - Use -r=... instead of -r ... to specify references with
      Mercurial. (#12306, CVE-2023-5752, bsc#1217353)
    - Redact password from URLs in some additional
      places. (#12350)
    - pip uses less memory when caching large packages. As a
      result, there is a new on-disk cache format stored in a new
      directory ($PIP_CACHE_DIR/http-v2). (#2984)
  - Vendored Libraries
    - Upgrade certifi to 2023.7.22
    - Add truststore 0.8.0
    - Upgrade urllib3 to 1.26.17
  - Improved Documentation
    - Document that pip search support has been removed from PyPI
      (#12059)
    - Clarify --prefer-binary in CLI and docs (#12122)
    - Document that using OS-provided Python can cause pip's test
      suite to report false failures. (#12334)
- Adjust pip-shipped-requests-cabundle.patch.

Mon Aug 28 03:30:09 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Finally drop csv23, it has been removed upstream since 2021.
- Shift around sle15_python_module_pythons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  7 22:01:39 UTC 2023 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 23.2.1
  * Bug fixes
    - Disable PEP 658 metadata fetching with the legacy resolver.

- Upgrade to 23.2
  * Process
    - Deprecate support for eggs for Python 3.11 or later, when the
      new importlib.metadata backend is used to load distribution
      metadata. This only affects the egg distribution format (with
      the .egg extension); distributions using the .egg-info metadata
      format (but are not actually eggs) are not affected. For more
      information about eggs, see relevant section in the setuptools
      documentation.
  * Deprecations and Removals
    - Deprecate legacy version and version specifiers that don’t
      conform to PEP 440
    - freeze no longer excludes the setuptools, distribute, and wheel
      from the output when running on Python 3.12 or later, where they
      are not included in a virtual environment by default. Use
      --exclude if you wish to exclude any of these packages.
  * Features
    - make rejection messages slightly different between 1 and 8, so
      the user can make the difference.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fix pip completion --zsh.
    - Prevent downloading files twice when PEP 658 metadata is present
    - Add permission check before configuration
    - Fix deprecation warnings in Python 3.12 for usage of
      shutil.rmtree
    - Ignore invalid or unreadable origin.json files in the cache of
      locally built wheels.
    - Fix installation of packages with PEP658 metadata using
      non-canonicalized names
    - Correctly parse dist-info-metadata values from JSON-format index
      data.
    - Fail with an error if the --python option is specified after the
      subcommand name.
    - Fix slowness when using importlib.metadata (the default way for
      pip to read metadata in Python 3.11+) and there is a large
      overlap between already installed and to-be-installed packages.
    - Pass the -r flag to mercurial to be explicit that a revision is
      passed and protect against hg options injection as part of VCS
      URLs. Users that do not have control on VCS URLs passed to pip
      are advised to upgrade.
  * Vendored Libraries
    - Upgrade certifi to 2023.5.7
    - Upgrade platformdirs to 3.8.1
    - Upgrade pygments to 2.15.1
    - Upgrade pyparsing to 3.1.0
    - Upgrade Requests to 2.31.0
    - Upgrade rich to 13.4.2
    - Upgrade setuptools to 68.0.0
    - Updated typing_extensions to 4.6.0
    - Upgrade typing_extensions to 4.7.1
    - Upgrade urllib3 to 1.26.16

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 12 10:50:56 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Remove .exe files from package (bsc#1212015)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  2 10:12:33 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 23.1.2
  - Upgrade setuptools to 67.7.2
- 23.1.1:
  - Revert #11487, as it causes issues with virtualenvs created by the
    Windows Store distribution of Python. (#11987)
  - Revert pkg_resources (via setuptools) back to 65.6.3
  - Update documentation to reflect the new behavior of using the
    cache of locally built wheels in hash-checking mode. (#11967)
- 23.1:
  - Remove support for the deprecated --install-options. (#11358)
  - --no-binary does not imply setup.py install anymore. Instead a
    wheel will be built locally and installed. (#11451)
  - --no-binary does not disable the cache of locally built wheels
    anymore. It only means "don't download wheels". (#11453)
  - Deprecate --build-option and --global-option. Users are invited to
    switch to --config-settings. (#11859)
  - Using --config-settings with projects that don't have a
    pyproject.toml now prints a deprecation warning. In the future the
    presence of config settings will automatically enable the default
    build backend for legacy projects and pass the setttings to it.
    (#11915)
  - Remove setup.py install fallback when building a wheel failed for
    projects without pyproject.toml. (#8368)
  - When the wheel package is not installed, pip now uses the default
    build backend instead of setup.py install and setup.py develop for
    project without pyproject.toml. (#8559)
  - Specify egg-link location in assertion message when it does not
    match installed location to provide better error message for
    debugging. (#10476)
  - Present conflict information during installation after each choice
    that is rejected (pass -vv to pip install to show it) (#10937)
  - Display dependency chain on each Collecting/Processing log line.
    (#11169)
  - Support a per-requirement --config-settings option in requirements
    files. (#11325)
  - The --config-settings/-C option now supports using the same key
    multiple times. When the same key is specified multiple times, all
    values are passed to the build backend as a list, as opposed to
    the previous behavior, where pip would only pass the last value if
    the same key was used multiple times. (#11681)
  - Add -C as a short version of the --config-settings option.
    (#11786)
  - Reduce the number of resolver rounds, since backjumping makes the
    resolver more efficient in finding solutions. This also makes
    pathological cases fail quicker. (#11908)
  - Warn if --hash is used on a line without requirement in a
    requirements file. (#11935)
  - Stop propagating CLI --config-settings to the build dependencies.
    They already did not propagate to requirements provided in
    requirement files. To pass the same config settings to several
    requirements, users should provide the requirements as CLI
    arguments. (#11941)
  - Support wheel cache when using --require-hashes. (#5037)
  - Add --keyring-provider flag. See the Authentication page in the
    documentation for more info. (#8719)
  - In the case of virtual environments, configuration files are now
    also included from the base installation. (#9752)
  - Fix grammar by changing "A new release of pip available:" to "A
    new release of pip is available:" in the notice used for
    indicating that. (#11529)
  - Normalize paths before checking if installed scripts are on PATH.
    (#11719)
  - Correct the way to decide if keyring is available. (#11774)
  - More consistent resolution backtracking by removing legacy hack
    related to setuptools resolution (#11837)
  - Include AUTHORS.txt in pip's wheels. (#11882)
  - The uninstall and install --force-reinstall commands no longer
    call normalize_path() repeatedly on the same paths. Instead, these
    results are cached for the duration of an uninstall operation,
    resulting in improved performance, particularly on Windows.
    (#11889)
  - Fix and improve the parsing of hashes embedded in URL fragments.
    (#11936)
  - When package A depends on package B provided as a direct URL
    dependency including a hash embedded in the link, the
    --require-hashes option did not warn when user supplied hashes
    were missing for package B. (#11938)
  - Correctly report requested_extras in the installation report when
    extras are specified for a local directory installation. (#11946)
  - When installing an archive from a direct URL or local file,
    populate download_info.info.hashes in the installation report, in
    addition to the legacy download_info.info.hash key. (#11948)
- 23.0.1:
  - Change the hashes in the installation report to be a mapping. Emit
    the archive_info.hashes dictionary in direct_url.json. (#11312)
  - Implement logic to read the EXTERNALLY-MANAGED file as specified
    in PEP 668. This allows a downstream Python distributor to prevent
    users from using pip to modify the externally managed environment.
    (#11381)
  - Enable the use of keyring found on PATH. This allows keyring
    installed using pipx to be used by pip. (#11589)
  - The inspect and installation report formats are now declared
    stable, and their version has been bumped from 0 to 1. (#11757)
  - Wheel cache behavior is restored to match previous versions,
    allowing the cache to find existing entries. (#11527)
  - Use the "venv" scheme if available to obtain prefixed lib paths.
    (#11598)
  - Deprecated a historical ambiguity in how egg fragments in
    URL-style requirements are formatted and handled. egg fragments
    that do not look like PEP 508 names now produce a deprecation
    warning. (#11617)
  - Fix scripts path in isolated build environment on Debian. (#11623)
  - Make pip show show the editable location if package is editable
    (#11638)
  - Stop checking that wheel is present when build-system.requires is
    provided without build-system.build-backend as setuptools (which
    we still check for) will inject it anyway. (#11673)
  - Fix an issue when an already existing in-memory distribution would
    cause exceptions in pip install (#11704)

- Update to 22.3.1: (bsc#1205478)
  * Deprecations and Removals
    + Deprecate installation with setup.py install when no-binary is enabled
      for source distributions without pyproject.toml. (#11452)
    + Deprecate installation with setup.py install when the wheel package is
      absent for source distributions without pyproject.toml. (#8559)
    + Drop --use-deprecated=out-of-tree-build. (#11001)
  * Features
    + Use the data-dist-info-metadata attribute from PEP 658 to resolve
      distribution metadata without downloading the dist yet. (#11111)
    + Add --dry-run option to pip install, to let it print what it would
     install but not actually make changes in the target environment. (#11096)
    + Add pip inspect command to obtain the list of installed distributions
     and other information about the Python environment, in JSON. (#11245)
    + Add option to install and uninstall commands to opt-out from
      running-as-root warning. (#10556)
    + Add a user interface for supplying config settings to build backends.
      (#11059)
    + Explains why specified version cannot be retrieved when Requires-Python
      is not satisfied. (#9615)
    + Validate build dependencies when using --no-build-isolation. (#9794)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix entry point generation of pip.X, pipX.Y, and easy_install-X.Y to
      correctly account for multi-digit Python version segments. (#11547)
    + Fix --no-index when --index-url or --extra-index-url is specified
      inside a requirements file. (#11276)
    + Ignore distributions with invalid Name in metadata instead of crashing,
      when using the importlib.metadata backend. (#11352)
    + Raise RequirementsFileParseError when parsing malformed requirements
      options that can’t be sucessfully parsed by shlex. (#11491)
    + Show pip deprecation warnings by default. (#11330)
    + Send the pip upgrade prompt to stderr. (#11282)
    + Ensure that things work correctly in environments where
      setuptools-injected distutils is available by default. (#11298)
    + pip config now normalizes names by converting underscores into
      dashes. (#9330)
    + Fallback to pyproject.toml-based builds if setup.py is present in a
      project, but setuptools cannot be imported. (#10717)
    + When checking for conflicts in the build environment, correctly skip
      requirements containing markers that do not match the current
      environment. (#10883)
    + Fix pip install issues using a proxy due to an inconsistency in how
      Requests is currently handling variable precedence in session. (#9691)
- Refresh all patches.
- Stop skipping a lot of tests, no longer required.
- Add installer to BuildRequires for the test flavor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 10 10:33:35 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

Thu Jun 23 20:08:32 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add distutils-reproducible-compile.patch to make installed

Sat Mar 19 17:14:58 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Avoid cycle: BuildRequire ca-certificates only in tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 09:32:29 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update requirements: v22 is not compatible with Python 3.6 and
  thus not suitable for SLE/Leap 15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 17 10:28:24 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 22.0.4:
  - Drop the doctype check, that presented a warning for index
    pages that use non-compliant HTML 5.
- Update to 22.0.3:
  - Print the exception via rich.traceback, when running with
    --debug.
  - Only calculate topological installation order, for packages
    that are going to be installed/upgraded.
  - This fixes an AssertionError that occured when determining
    installation order, for a very specific combination of
    upgrading-already-installed-package + change of dependencies
    + fetching some packages from a package index. This
    combination was especially common in Read the Docs'
    builds.
  - Use html.parser by default, instead of falling back
    to html5lib when --use-deprecated=html5lib is not
    passed.
  - Clarify that using per-requirement overrides disables the
    usage of wheels.
- Update to 22.0.2:
  - Instead of failing on index pages that use non-compliant
    HTML 5, print a deprecation warning and fall back to
    html5lib-based parsing for now. This simplifies the migration
    for non-compliant index pages, by letting such indexes
    function with a warning.
- Update to 22.0.1:
  - Accept lowercase <!doctype html> on index pages.
  - Properly handle links parsed by html5lib, when using
    --use-deprecated=html5lib.
- Update to 22.0:
  - Completely replace :pypi:`tox` in our development workflow,
    with :pypi:`nox`.
  - Deprecate alternative progress bar styles, leaving only on
    and off as available choices.
  - Drop support for Python 3.6.
  - Disable location mismatch warnings on Python versions prior
    to 3.10.
  - These warnings were helping identify potential issues as part
    of the sysconfig -> distutils transition, and we no longer
    need to rely on reports from older Python versions for
    information on the transition.
  - Changed PackageFinder to parse HTML documents using the
    stdlib :class:`html.parser.HTMLParser` class instead of the
    html5lib package.
  - For now, the deprecated html5lib code remains and can be used
    with the --use-deprecated=html5lib command line option.
    However, it will be removed in a future pip release.
  - Utilise rich for presenting pip's default download progress
    bar.
  - Present a better error message when an invalid wheel file is
    encountered, providing more context where the invalid wheel
    file is.
  - Documents the --require-virtualenv flag for pip install.
  - pip install <tab> autocompletes paths.
  - Allow Python distributors to opt-out from or opt-in to the
    sysconfig installation scheme backend by setting
    sysconfig._PIP_USE_SYSCONFIG to True or False.
  - Make it possible to deselect tests requiring cryptography
    package on systems where it cannot be installed.
  - Start using Rich for presenting error messages in
    a consistent format.
  - Improve presentation of errors from subprocesses.
  - Forward pip's verbosity configuration to VCS tools to control
    their output accordingly.
  - Optimize installation order calculation to improve
    performance when installing requirements that form a complex
    dependency graph with a large amount of edges.
  - When a package is requested by the user for upgrade,
    correctly identify that the extra-ed variant of that same
    package depended by another user-requested package is
    requesting the same package, and upgrade it accordingly.
  - Prevent pip from installing yanked releases unless explicitly
    pinned via the == or === operators.
  - Stop backtracking on build failures, by instead surfacing
    them to the user and aborting immediately. This behaviour
    provides more immediate feedback when a package cannot be
    built due to missing build dependencies or platform
    incompatibility.
  - Silence Value for <location> does not match warning caused by
    an erroneous patch in Slackware-distributed Python 3.9.
  - Fix an issue where pip did not consider dependencies with and
    without extras to be equal

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  7 17:07:30 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 21.3.1:
  * Always refuse installing or building projects that have no ``pyproject.toml`` nor
    ``setup.py``.
  * Tweak running-as-root detection, to check ``os.getuid`` if it exists, on
    Unix-y and non-Linux/non-MacOS machines.
  * When installing projects with a ``pyproject.toml`` in editable mode, and the build
    backend does not support :pep:`660`, prepare metadata using
    ``prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel`` instead of ``setup.py egg_info``. Also, refuse
    installing projects that only have a ``setup.cfg`` and no ``setup.py`` nor
    ``pyproject.toml``. These restore the pre-21.3 behaviour.
  * Restore compatibility of where configuration files are loaded from on MacOS
  * Upgrade pep517 to 0.12.0
  * Improve deprecation warning regarding the copying of source trees when
    installing from a local directory.
  * Suppress location mismatch warnings when pip is invoked from a Python source
    tree, so ``ensurepip`` does not emit warnings on CPython ``make install``.
  * On Python 3.10 or later, the installation scheme backend has been changed to use
    ``sysconfig``. This is to anticipate the deprecation of ``distutils`` in Python
    3.10, and its scheduled removal in 3.12. For compatibility considerations, pip
    installations running on Python 3.9 or lower will continue to use ``distutils``.
  * Remove the ``--build-dir`` option and aliases, one last time.
  * In-tree builds are now the default. ``--use-feature=in-tree-build`` is now
    ignored. ``--use-deprecated=out-of-tree-build`` may be used temporarily to ease
    the transition.
  * Un-deprecate source distribution re-installation behaviour.
  * Replace vendored appdirs with platformdirs.
  * Support `PEP 610 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0610/>`_ to detect
    editable installs in ``pip freeze`` and  ``pip list``. The ``pip list`` column output
    has a new ``Editable project location`` column, and the JSON output has a new
    ``editable_project_location`` field.
  * ``pip freeze`` will now always fallback to reporting the editable project
    location when it encounters a VCS error while analyzing an editable
    requirement. Before, it sometimes reported the requirement as non-editable.
  * ``pip show`` now sorts ``Requires`` and ``Required-By`` alphabetically.
  * Do not raise error when there are no files to remove with ``pip cache purge/remove``.
    Instead log a warning and continue (to log that we removed 0 files).
  * When backtracking during dependency resolution, prefer the dependencies
    which are involved in the most recent conflict. This can significantly
    reduce the amount of backtracking required.
  * Cache requirement objects, to improve performance reducing reparses of requirement strings.
  * Support editable installs for projects that have a ``pyproject.toml`` and use a
    build backend that supports :pep:`660`.
  * When a revision is specified in a Git URL, use git's partial clone feature
    to speed up source retrieval.
  * Add a ``--debug`` flag, to enable a mode that doesn't log errors and
    propagates them to the top level instead. This is primarily to aid with
    debugging pip's crashes.
  * If a host is explicitly specified as trusted by the user (via the
    --trusted-host option), cache HTTP responses from it in addition to HTTPS
    ones.
  * Present a better error message, when a ``file:`` URL is not found.
  * Fix the auth credential cache to allow for the case in which
    the index url contains the username, but the password comes
    from an external source, such as keyring.
  * Fix double unescape of HTML ``data-requires-python`` and ``data-yanked`` attributes.
  * New resolver: Fixes depth ordering of packages during resolution, e.g. a
    dependency 2 levels deep will be ordered before a dependecy 3 levels deep.

    * Document that Python versions are generally supported until
      PyPI usage falls below 5%
  Features
    * New resolver: Avoid accessing indexes when the installed
      candidate is preferred and considered good enough
    * Improve error message friendliness when an environment
      has packages with corrupted metadata
    * Cache package listings on index packages so they are guarenteed
      to stay stable during a pip command session. This also improves
      performance when a index page is accessed multiple times during
      the command session
    * New resolver: Tweak resolution logic to improve user experience
      when user-supplied requirements conflict
  Bug Fixes
    * New resolver: Correctly respect ``Requires-Python`` metadata
      to reject incompatible packages in ``--no-deps`` mode
    * New resolver: Pick up hash declarations in constraints files
      and use them to filter available distributions
    * New resolver: If a package appears multiple times in user
      specification with different ``--hash`` options, only hashes
      that present in all specifications should be allowed

Sun Oct 11 13:08:15 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 20.2.3
  Deprecations and Removals
  * Deprecate support for Python 3.5 (#8181)
  Features
  * Make the setup.py install deprecation warning less
    noisy. We warn only when setup.py install succeeded and
    setup.py bdist_wheel failed, as situations where both
    fails are most probably irrelevant to this deprecation.
    (#8752)
- 20.2.2
  Bug Fixes
  * Only attempt to use the keyring once and if it fails, don’t try
    again. This prevents spamming users with several keyring unlock
    prompts when they cannot unlock or don’t want to do so. (#8090)
  * Fix regression that distributions in system site-packages are
    not correctly found when a virtual environment is configured
    with system-site-packages on. (#8695)
  * Disable caching for range requests, which causes corrupted
    wheels when pip tries to obtain metadata using the feature
    fast-deps. (#8701, #8716)
  * Always use UTF-8 to read pyvenv.cfg to match the built-in venv.
    (#8717)
  * 2020 Resolver: Correctly handle marker evaluation in
    constraints and exclude them if their markers do not match the
    current environment. (#8724)
- 20.2.1
  Features
  * Ignore require-virtualenv in pip list (#8603)
  Bug Fixes
  * Correctly find already-installed distributions with dot (.) in
    the name and uninstall them when needed. (#8645)
  * Trace a better error message on installation failure due to
    invalid .data files in wheels. (#8654)
  * Fix SVN version detection for alternative SVN distributions.
    (#8665)
  * New resolver: Correctly include the base package when specified
    with extras in --no-deps mode. (#8677)
  * Use UTF-8 to handle ZIP archive entries on Python 2 according
    to PEP 427, so non-ASCII paths can be resolved as expected.
    (#8684)
  Improved Documentation
  * Add details on old resolver deprecation and removal to
    migration documentation. (#8371)
  * Fix feature flag name in docs. (#8660)
- 20.2 (2020-07-29)
  Deprecations and Removals
  * Deprecate setup.py-based builds that do not generate an .egg-
    info directory. (#6998, #8617)
  * Disallow passing install-location-related arguments in --
    install-options. (#7309)
  * Add deprecation warning for invalid requirements format
    “base>=1.0[extra]” (#8288)
  * Deprecate legacy setup.py install when building a wheel failed
    for source distributions without pyproject.toml (#8368)
  * Deprecate -b/--build/--build-dir/--build-directory. Its current
    behaviour is confusing and breaks in case different versions of
    the same distribution need to be built during the resolution
    process. Using the TMPDIR/TEMP/TMP environment variable,
    possibly combined with --no-clean covers known use cases.
    (#8372)
  * Remove undocumented and deprecated option --always-unzip
    (#8408)
  Features
  * Log debugging information about pip, in pip install --verbose.
    (#3166)
  * Refine error messages to avoid showing Python tracebacks when
    an HTTP error occurs. (#5380)
  * Install wheel files directly instead of extracting them to a
    temp directory. (#6030)
  * Add a beta version of pip’s next-generation dependency
    resolver.
  * Move pip’s new resolver into beta, remove the --unstable-
    feature=resolver flag, and enable the --use-feature=2020-
    resolver flag. The new resolver is significantly stricter and
    more consistent when it receives incompatible instructions, and
    reduces support for certain kinds of Constraints Files, so some
    workarounds and workflows may break. More details about how to
    test and migrate, and how to report issues, at Changes to the
    pip dependency resolver in 20.2 (2020) . Maintainers are
    preparing to release pip 20.3, with the new resolver on by
    default, in October. (#6536)
  * Introduce a new ResolutionImpossible error, raised when pip
    encounters un-satisfiable dependency conflicts (#8546, #8377)
  * Add a subcommand debug to pip config to list available
    configuration sources and the key-value pairs defined in them.
    (#6741)
  * Warn if index pages have unexpected content-type (#6754)
  * Allow specifying --prefer-binary option in a requirements file (#7693)
  * Generate PEP 376 REQUESTED metadata for user supplied
    requirements installed by pip. (#7811)
  * Warn if package url is a vcs or an archive url with invalid
    scheme (#8128)
  * Parallelize network operations in pip list. (#8504)
  * Allow the new resolver to obtain dependency information through
    wheels lazily downloaded using HTTP range requests. To enable
    this feature, invoke pip with --use-feature=fast-deps. (#8588)
  * Support --use-feature in requirements files (#8601)
  * Bug Fixes
  * Use canonical package names while looking up already installed
    packages. (#5021)
  * Fix normalizing path on Windows when installing package on
    another logical disk. (#7625)
  * The VCS commands run by pip as subprocesses don’t merge stdout
    and stderr anymore, improving the output parsing by subsequent
    commands. (#7968)
  * Correctly treat non-ASCII entry point declarations in wheels so
    they can be installed on Windows. (#8342)
  * Update author email in config and tests to reflect
    decommissioning of pypa-dev list. (#8454)
  * Headers provided by wheels in .data directories are now
    correctly installed into the user-provided locations, such as
    --prefix, instead of the virtual environment pip is running in.
    (#8521)

    and only populate names in AUTHORS.txt at time of release
    (#5979)
  * Remove deprecated --skip-requirements-regex option. (#7297)

Thu Mar 19 09:42:10 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Skip virtualenv tests that are pinned to old virtualenv 16

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  5 10:19:17 UTC 2020 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 20.0.2
- add setuptools-45.1.0-py3-none-any.whl for testsuite
- drop pytest5.patch
 * Fix a regression in generation of compatibility tags
 * Rename an internal module, to avoid ImportErrors due to improper uninstallation
 * Switch to a dedicated CLI tool for vendoring dependencies.
 * Remove wheel tag calculation from pip and use packaging.tags. This should provide more tags ordered better than in prior releases.
 *  Deprecate setup.py-based builds that do not generate an .egg-info directory.
 *  The pip>=20 wheel cache is not retro-compatible with previous versions. Until pip 21.0, pip will continue to take advantage of existing legacy cache entries.
 *  Deprecate undocumented --skip-requirements-regex option.
 *  Deprecate passing install-location-related options via --install-option.
 *  Use literal "abi3" for wheel tag on CPython 3.x, to align with PEP 384 which only defines it for this platform.
 *  Remove interpreter-specific major version tag e.g. cp3-none-any from consideration. This behavior was not documented strictly, and this tag in particular is not useful. Anyone with a use case can create an issue with pypa/packaging.
 *  Wheel processing no longer permits wheels containing more than one top-level .dist-info directory.
 *  Support for the git+git@ form of VCS requirement is being deprecated and will be removed in pip 21.0. Switch to git+https:// or git+ssh://. git+git:// also works but its use is discouraged as it is insecure.
 *  Default to doing a user install (as if --user was passed) when the main site-packages directory is not writeable and user site-packages are enabled.
 *  Warn if a path in PATH starts with tilde during pip install.
 *  Cache wheels built from Git requirements that are considered immutable, because they point to a commit hash.
 *  Add option --no-python-version-warning to silence warnings related to deprecation of Python versions.
 *  Cache wheels that pip wheel built locally, matching what pip install does. This particularly helps performance in workflows where pip wheel is used for building before installing. Users desiring the original behavior can use pip wheel --no-cache-dir
 *  Display CA information in pip debug.
 *  Show only the filename (instead of full URL), when downloading from PyPI.
 *  Suggest a more robust command to upgrade pip itself to avoid confusion when the current pip command is not available as pip.
 *  Define all old pip console script entrypoints to prevent import issues in stale wrapper scripts.
 *  The build step of pip wheel now builds all wheels to a cache first, then copies them to the wheel directory all at once. Before, it built them to a temporary directory and moved them to the wheel directory one by one.
 *  Expand ~ prefix to user directory in path options, configs, and environment variables. Values that may be either URL or path are not currently supported, to avoid ambiguity:
   --find-links
   --constraint, -c
   --requirement, -r
   --editable, -e
 *  Correctly handle system site-packages, in virtual environments created with venv (PEP 405).
 *  Fix case sensitive comparison of pip freeze when used with -r option.
 *  Enforce PEP 508 requirement format in pyproject.toml build-system.requires.
 *  Make ensure_dir() also ignore ENOTEMPTY as seen on Windows.
 *  Fix building packages which specify backend-path in pyproject.toml.
 *  Do not attempt to run setup.py clean after a pep517 build error, since a setup.py may not exist in that case.
 *  Fix passwords being visible in the index-url in "Downloading <url>" message.
 *  Change method from shutil.remove to shutil.rmtree in noxfile.py.
 *  Skip running tests which require subversion, when svn isn't installed
 *  Fix not sending client certificates when using --trusted-host.
 *  Make sure pip wheel never outputs pure python wheels with a python implementation tag. Better fix/workaround for #3025 by using a per-implementation wheel cache instead of caching pure python wheels with an implementation tag in their name.
 *  Include subdirectory URL fragments in cache keys.
 *  Fix typo in warning message when any of --build-option, --global-option and --install-option is used in requirements.txt
 *  Fix the logging of cached HTTP response shown as downloading.
 *  Effectively disable the wheel cache when it is not writable, as is the case with the http cache.
 *  Correctly handle relative cache directory provided via --cache-dir.
 *
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Remove the deprecated --venv option from pip config.
  * Make pip show warn about packages not found.
  * Abort installation if any archive contains a file which would be placed outside the extraction location.
  * pip's CLI completion code no longer prints a Traceback if it is interrupted.
  * Ignore errors copying socket files for local source installs (in Python 3).
  * Skip copying .tox and .nox directories to temporary build directories
  * Ignore "require_virtualenv" in pip config

  * Credentials will now be loaded using keyring when installed
  * Fully support using --trusted-host inside requirements files
  * Update timestamps in pip's --log file to include milliseconds

  * When choosing candidates to install, prefer candidates with a hash matching one of the user-provided hashes
  * Improve the error message when METADATA or PKG-INFO is None when accessing metadata
  * Add a new command pip debug that can display e.g. the list of compatible tags for the current Python
  * Display hint on installing with --pre when search results include pre-release versions
  * Report to Warehouse that pip is running under CI if the PIP_IS_CI environment variable is set
  * Allow --python-version to be passed as a dotted version string (e.g. 3.7 or 3.7.3)
  * Log the final filename and SHA256 of a .whl file when done building a wheel
  * Include the wheel's tags in the log message explanation when a candidate wheel link is found incompatible
  * Add a --path argument to pip freeze to support --target installations
  * Add a --path argument to pip list to support --target installations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 10 23:17:02 CEST 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 19.1.1:
  - Restore pyproject.toml handling to how it was with pip 19.0.3
    to prevent the need to add --no-use-pep517 when installing in
    editable mode. (#6434)
  - Fix a regression that caused @ to be quoted in pypiserver
    links. This interfered with parsing the revision string from
    VCS urls. (#6440)
  - Configuration files may now also be stored under sys.prefix
    (#5060)
  - Avoid creating an unnecessary local clone of a Bazaar branch
    when exporting. (#5443)
  - Include in pip's User-Agent string whether it looks like pip
    is running under CI. (#5499)
  - A custom (JSON-encoded) string can now be added to pip's
    User-Agent using the PIP_USER_AGENT_USER_DATA environment
    variable. (#5549)
  - For consistency, passing --no-cache-dir no longer affects
    whether wheels will be built. In this case, a temporary
    directory is used. (#5749)
  - Command arguments in subprocess log messages are now quoted
    using shlex.quote(). (#6290)
  - Prefix warning and error messages in log output with WARNING
    and ERROR. (#6298)
  - Using --build-options in a PEP 517 build now fails with an
    error, rather than silently ignoring the option. (#6305)
  - Error out with an informative message if one tries to install
    a pyproject.toml-style (PEP 517) source tree using --editable
    mode. (#6314)
  - When downloading a package, the ETA and average speed now
    only update once per second for better legibility. (#6319)
  - The stdout and stderr from VCS commands run by pip as
    subprocesses (e.g. git, hg, etc.) no longer pollute pip's
    stdout. (#1219)
  - Fix handling of requests exceptions when dependencies are
    debundled. (#4195)
  - Make pip's self version check avoid recommending upgrades to
    prereleases if the currently-installed version is stable.
    (#5175)
  - Fixed crash when installing a requirement from a URL that
    comes from a dependency without a URL. (#5889)
  - Improve handling of file URIs: correctly handle
    file://localhost/... and don't try to use UNC paths on Unix.
    (#5892)
  - Fix utils.encoding.auto_decode() LookupError with invalid
    encodings. utils.encoding.auto_decode() was broken when
    decoding Big Endian BOM byte-strings on Little Endian or vice
    versa. (#6054)
  - Fix incorrect URL quoting of IPv6 addresses. (#6285)
  - Redact the password from the extra index URL when using pip
    -v. (#6295)
  - The spinner no longer displays a completion message after
    subprocess calls not needing a spinner. It also no longer
    incorrectly reports an error after certain subprocess calls
    to Git that succeeded. (#6312)
  - Fix the handling of editable mode during installs when
    pyproject.toml is present but PEP 517 doesn't require the
    source tree to be treated as pyproject.toml-style. (#6370)
  - Fix NameError when handling an invalid requirement. (#6419)
  - Make dashes render correctly when displaying long options
    like --find-links in the text. (#6422)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 10 16:35:47 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 19.0.3:
  * Fix an IndexError crash when a legacy build of a wheel
    fails. (#6252)
  * Fix a regression introduced in 19.0.2 where the filename in a
    RECORD file of an installed file would not be updated when
    installing a wheel. (#6266)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 10:06:06 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Avoid name repetition in summary. Summary should not be a
  sentence (let alone three).

Mon Feb 11 13:54:34 UTC 2019 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to 19.0.2 (2019-02-09):
  + Bug Fixes
    * Fix a crash where PEP 517-based builds using --no-cache-dir
      would fail in some circumstances with an AssertionError due
      to not finalizing a build directory internally. (#6197)
    * Provide a better error message if attempting an editable
      install of a directory with a pyproject.toml but no setup.py.
      (#6170)
    * The implicit default backend used for projects that provide a
      pyproject.toml file without explicitly specifying build-
      backend now behaves more like direct execution of setup.py,
      and hence should restore compatibility with projects that
      were unable to be installed with pip 19.0. This raised the
      minimum required version of setuptools for such builds to
      40.8.0. (#6163)
    * Allow RECORD lines with more than three elements, and display
      a warning. (#6165)
    * AdjacentTempDirectory fails on unwritable directory instead
      of locking up the uninstall command. (#6169)
    * Make failed uninstalls roll back more reliably and better at
      avoiding naming conflicts. (#6194)
    * Ensure the correct wheel file is copied when building PEP 517
      distribution is built. (#6196)
    * The Python 2 end of life warning now only shows on CPython,
      which is the implementation that has announced end of life
      plans. (#6207)
  + Improved Documentation
    * Re-write README and documentation index (#5815)

- Update to 19.0.1 (2019-01-23):
  + Bug Fixes
    * Fix a crash when using –no-cache-dir with PEP 517
      distributions (#6158, #6171)

- Update to 19.0 (2019-01-22):
  + Deprecations and Removals
    * Deprecate support for Python 3.4 (#6106)
    * Start printing a warning for Python 2.7 to warn of impending
      Python 2.7 End-of-life and prompt users to start migrating to
      Python 3. (#6148)
    * Remove the deprecated --process-dependency-links option.
      (#6060)
    * Remove the deprecated SVN editable detection based on
      dependency links during freeze. (#5866)
  + Features
    * Implement PEP 517 (allow projects to specify a build backend
      via pyproject.toml). (#5743)
    * Implement manylinux2010 platform tag support. manylinux2010
      is the successor to manylinux1. It allows carefully compiled
      binary wheels to be installed on compatible Linux platforms.
      (#5008)
    * Improve build isolation: handle .pth files, so namespace
      packages are correctly supported under Python 3.2 and
      earlier. (#5656)
    * Include the package name in a freeze warning if the package
      is not installed. (#5943)
    * Warn when dropping an --[extra-]index-url value that points
      to an existing local directory. (#5827)
    * Prefix pip’s --log file lines with their timestamp. (#6141)
  + Bug Fixes
    * Avoid creating excessively long temporary paths when
      uninstalling packages. (#3055)
    * Redact the password from the URL in various log messages.
      (#4746, #6124)
    * Avoid creating excessively long temporary paths when
      uninstalling packages. (#3055)
    * Avoid printing a stack trace when given an invalid
      requirement. (#5147)
    * Present 401 warning if username/password do not work for URL
      (#4833)
    * Handle requests.exceptions.RetryError raised in PackageFinder
      that was causing pip to fail silently when some indexes were
      unreachable. (#5270, #5483)
    * Handle a broken stdout pipe more gracefully (e.g. when
      running pip list | head). (#4170)
    * Fix crash from setting PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=yes. (#5385)
    * Fix crash from unparseable requirements when checking
      installed packages. (#5839)
    * Fix content type detection if a directory named like an
      archive is used as a package source. (#5838)
    * Fix listing of outdated packages that are not dependencies of
      installed packages in pip list --outdated --not-required
      (#5737)
    * Fix sorting TypeError in move_wheel_files() when installing
      some packages. (#5868)
    * Fix support for invoking pip using python src/pip ....
      (#5841)
    * Greatly reduce memory usage when installing wheels containing
      large files. (#5848)
    * Editable non-VCS installs now freeze as editable. (#5031)
    * Editable Git installs without a remote now freeze as
      editable. (#4759)
    * Canonicalize sdist file names so they can be matched to a
      canonicalized package name passed to pip install. (#5870)
    * Properly decode special characters in SVN URL credentials.
      (#5968)
    * Make PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR disable the cache also for truthy
      values like "true", "yes", "1", etc. (#5735)
  + Vendored Libraries
    * Include license text of vendored 3rd party libraries. (#5213)
    * Update certifi to 2018.11.29
    * Update colorama to 0.4.1
    * Update distlib to 0.2.8
    * Update idna to 2.8

Sat Oct 20 15:36:00 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * remove devel from noarch

- update to version 18.1:
  * Features
    + Allow PEP 508 URL requirements to be used as dependencies.
    + As a security measure, pip will raise an exception when
      installing packages from PyPI if those packages depend on
      packages not also hosted on PyPI. In the future, PyPI will block
      uploading packages with such external URL dependencies
      directly. (#4187)
    + Upgrade pyparsing to 2.2.1. (#5013)
    + Allows dist options (–abi, –python-version, –platform,
      –implementation) when installing with –target (#5355)
    + Support passing svn+ssh URLs with a username to pip install
      -e. (#5375)
    + pip now ensures that the RECORD file is sorted when installing
      from a wheel file. (#5525)
    + Add support for Python 3.7. (#5561)
    + Malformed configuration files now show helpful error messages,
      instead of tracebacks. (#5798)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Checkout the correct branch when doing an editable Git
      install. (#2037)
    + Run self-version-check only on commands that may access the
      index, instead of trying on every run and failing to do so due
      to missing options. (#5433)
    + Allow a Git ref to be installed over an existing
      installation. (#5624)
    + Show a better error message when a configuration option has an
      invalid value. (#5644)
    + Always revalidate cached simple API pages instead of blindly
      caching them for up to 10 minutes. (#5670)
    + Avoid caching self-version-check information when cache is
      disabled. (#5679)
    + Avoid traceback printing on autocomplete after flags in the
      CLI. (#5751)
    + Fix incorrect parsing of egg names if pip needs to guess the
      package name. (#5819)
  * Vendored Libraries
    + Upgrade certifi to 2018.8.24
    + Upgrade packaging to 18.0
    + Add pep517 version 0.2
    + Upgrade pytoml to 0.1.19
    + Upgrade pkg_resources to 40.4.3 (via setuptools)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  8 14:53:21 UTC 2017 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to version 9.0.1:
  * Correct the deprecation message when not specifying a --format so
    that it uses the correct setting name ("format") rather than the
    incorrect one ("list_format") (:issue:`4058`).
  * Fix "pip check" to check all available distributions and not just
    the local ones (:issue:`4083`).
  * Fix a crash on non ASCII characters from `lsb_release`
    (:issue:`4062`).
  * Fix an SyntaxError in an an used module of a vendored dependency
    (:issue:`4059`).
  * Fix UNC paths on Windows (:issue:`4064`).

- update to version 9.0.0:
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the attempted autodetection of
    requirement names from URLs, URLs must include a name via
    "#egg=".
  * **DEPRECATION** "pip install --egg" have been deprecated and will
    be removed in the future. This "feature" has a long list of
    drawbacks which break nearly all of pip's other features in
    subtle and hard-to-diagnose ways.
  * **DEPRECATION** "--default-vcs" option (:issue:`4052`).
  * **WARNING** pip 9 cache can break forward compatibility with
    previous pip versions if your package repository allows chunked
    responses (:issue:`4078`).
  * Add a "pip check" command to check installed packages dependencies
    (:pull:`3750`).
  * Add option allowing user to abort pip operation if file/directory
    exists
  * Add Appveyor CI
  * Uninstall existing packages when performing an editable
    installation of the same packages (:issue:`1548`).
  * "pip show" is less verbose by default. "--verbose" prints
    multiline fields.  (:pull:`3858`).
  * Add optional column formatting to "pip list" (:issue:`3651`).
  * Add "--not-required" option to "pip list", which lists packages
    that are not dependencies of other packages.
  * Fix builds on systems with symlinked "/tmp" directory for custom
    builds such as numpy (:pull:`3701`).
  * Fix regression in "pip freeze": when there is more than one git
    remote, priority is given to the remote named "origin"
    (:pull:`3708`, :issue:`3616`).
  * Fix crash when calling "pip freeze" with invalid requirement
    installed (:pull:`3704`, :issue:`3681`).
  * Allow multiple "--requirement" files in "pip freeze"
    (:pull:`3703`).
  * Implementation of pep-503 "data-requires-python". When this field
    is present for a release link, pip will ignore the download when
    installing to a Python version that doesn't satisfy the
    requirement.
  * "pip wheel" now works on editable packages too (it was only
    working on editable dependencies before); this allows running "pip
    wheel" on the result of "pip freeze" in presence of editable
    requirements (:pull:`3695`, :issue:`3291`).
  * Load credentials from ".netrc" files (:pull:`3715`,
    :issue:`3569`).
  * Add "--platform", "--python-version", "--implementation" and
    "--abi" parameters to "pip download". These allow utilities and
    advanced users to gather distributions for interpreters other than
    the one pip is being run on.  (:pull:`3760`)
  * Skip scanning virtual environments, even when venv/bin/python is a
    dangling symlink.
  * Added "pip completion" support for the "fish" shell.
  * Fix problems on Windows on Python 2 when username or hostname
    contains non-ASCII characters (:issue:`3463`, :pull:`3970`,
    :pull:`4000`).
  * Use "git fetch --tags" to fetch tags in addition to everything
    else that is normally fetched; this is necessary in case a git
    requirement url points to a tag or commit that is not on a branch
    (:pull:`3791`)
  * Normalize package names before using in "pip show" (:issue:`3976`)
  * Raise when Requires-Python do not match the running version and
    add "--ignore-requires-python" option as escape hatch
    (:pull:`3846`).
  * Report the correct installed version when performing an upgrade in
    some corner cases (:issue:`2382`)
  * Add "-i" shorthand for "--index" flag in "pip search"
  * Do not optionally load C dependencies in requests (:issue:`1840`,
    :issue:`2930`, :issue:`3024`)
  * Strip authentication from SVN url prior to passing it to "svn"
    (:pull:`3697`, :issue:`3209`).
  * Also install in platlib with "--target" option (:pull:`3694`,
    :issue:`3682`).
  * Restore the ability to use inline comments in requirements files
    passed to "pip freeze" (:issue:`3680`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 30 06:33:26 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- Use pypi.io as Source url.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 14 16:05:24 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 8.1.2:
  * Fix a regression on systems with uninitialized locale (:issue:`3575`).
  * Use environment markers to filter packages before determining if a
    required wheel is supported. Solves (:issue:`3254`).
  * Make glibc parsing for `manylinux1` support more robust for the variety of
    glibc versions found in the wild (:issue:`3588`).
  * Update environment marker support to fully support PEP 508 and legacy
    environment markers (:issue:`3624`).
  * Always use debug logging to the ``--log`` file (:issue:`3351`).
  * Don't attempt to wrap search results for extremely narrow terminal windows
    (:issue:`3655`).
  * Fix regression with non-ascii requirement files on Python 2 and add support
    for encoding headers in requirement files (:issue:`3548`, :pull:`3547`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  9 09:46:20 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 8.1.0:
  * Implement PEP 513, which adds support for the manylinux1 platform tag,
    allowing carefully compiled binary wheels to be installed on compatible Linux
    platforms.
  * Allow wheels which are not specific to a particular Python interpreter but
    which are specific to a particular platform (:issue:`3202`).
  * Fixed an issue where ``call_subprocess`` would crash trying to print debug
    data on child process failure (:issue:`3521`, :pull:`3522`).
  * Exclude the wheel package from the `pip freeze` output (like pip and setuptools).
    :issue:`2989`.
  * Allow installing modules from a subdirectory of a vcs repository
    in non-editable mode (:issue:`3217`, :pull:`3466`).
  * Make pip wheel and pip download work with vcs urls with subdirectory option
    (:pull:`3466`).
  * Show classifiers in ``pip show``.
  * Show PEP376 Installer in ``pip show`` (:issue:`3517`).
  * Unhide completion command (:pull:`1810`).
  * Show latest version number in ``pip search`` results (:pull:`1415`).
  * Decode requirement files according to their BOM if present (:pull:`3485`,
    :issue:`2865`).
  * Fix and deprecate package name detection from url path (:issue:`3523` and
    :pull:`3495`).
  * Correct the behavior where interpreter specific tags (such as cp34) were
    being used on later versions of the same interprter instead of only for that
    specific interpreter (:issue:`3472`).
  * Fix an issue where pip would erroneously install a 64 bit wheel on a 32 bit
    Python running on a 64 bit OS X machine.
  * Do not assume that all git repositories have an origin remote.
  * Correctly display the line to add to a requirements.txt for an URL based
    dependency when ``--require-hashes`` is enabled.
  * Make ``install --quiet`` really quiet. See :issue:`3418`.
  * Fix a bug when removing packages in python 3: disable INI-style parsing of the
    entry_point.txt file to allow entry point names with colons (:pull:`3434`)
  * Normalize generated script files path in RECORD files. (:pull:`3448`)
  * Fix bug introduced in 8.0.0 where subcommand output was not shown,
    even when the user specified ``-v`` / ``--verbose``. :issue:`3486`.
  * Enable python -W with respect to PipDeprecationWarning. (:pull:`3455`)
  * Upgrade distlib to 0.2.2 (fix :issue:`3467`):
    * Improved support for Jython when quoting executables in output scripts.
  * Add a `--all` option to `pip freeze` to include usually skipped package
    (like pip, setuptools and wheel) to the freeze output. :issue:`1610`.
  * Stop attempting to trust the system CA trust store because it's extremely
    common for them to be broken, often in incompatible ways. See :pull:`3416`.
  * Detect CAPaths in addition to CAFiles on platforms that provide them.
  * Installing argparse or wsgiref will no longer warn or error - pip will allow
    the installation even though it may be useless (since the installed thing
    will be shadowed by the standard library).
  * Upgrading a distutils installed item that is installed outside of a virtual
    environment, while inside of a virtual environment will no longer warn or
    error.
  * Fix a bug where pre-releases were showing up in ``pip list --outdated``
    without the ``--pre`` flag.
  * Switch the SOABI emulation from using RuntimeWarnings to debug logging.
  * Rollback the removal of the ability to uninstall distutils installed items
    until a future date.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 20 10:34:10 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 0.8.0
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Drop support for Python 3.2.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Remove the ability to find any files other than the
    ones directly linked from the index or find-links pages.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Remove the ``--download-cache`` which had been
    deprecated and no-op'd in 6.0.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Remove the ``--log-explicit-levels`` which had been
    deprecated in 6.0.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Change pip wheel --wheel-dir default path from
    <cwd>/wheelhouse to <cwd>.
  * Deprecate and no-op the ``--allow-external``, ``--allow-all-external``, and
    ``--allow-unverified`` functionality that was added as part of PEP 438. With
    changes made to the repository protocol made in PEP 470, these options are no
    longer functional.
  * Allow ``--trusted-host`` within a requirements file. :issue:`2822`.
  * Allow ``--process-dependency-links`` within a requirements file. :issue:`1274`.
  * Allow ``--pre`` within a requirements file. :issue:`1273`.
  * Allow repository URLs with secure transports to count as trusted. (E.g.,
    "git+ssh" is okay.) :issue:`2811`.
  * Implement a top-level ``pip download`` command and deprecate
    ``pip install --download``.
  * Fixed :issue:`3141`, when uninstalling, look for the case of paths containing
    symlinked directories (:pull:`3154`)
  * When installing, if building a wheel fails, clear up the build directory
    before falling back to a source install. :issue:`3047`.
  * Fix user directory expansion when ``HOME=/``. Workaround for Python bug
    http://bugs.python.org/issue14768, reported in :issue:`2996`.
  * Fixed :issue:`3009`, correct reporting of requirements file line numbers
    (:pull:`3125`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1062`, Exception(IOError) for ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list``
    commands with subversion >= 1.7. (:pull:`3346`)
  * Provide a spinner showing that progress is happening when installing or
    building a package via ``setup.py``. This will alleviate concerns that
    projects with unusually long build times have with pip appearing to stall.
  * Include the functionality of ``peep`` into pip, allowing hashes to be baked
    into a requirements file and ensuring that the packages being downloaded
    match one of those hashes. This is an additional, opt-in security measure
    that, when used, removes the need to trust the repository.
  * Fix a bug causing pip to not select a wheel compiled against an OSX SDK later
    than what Python itself was compiled against when running on a newer version
    of OSX.
  * Add a new ``--prefix`` option for ``pip install`` that supports wheels and
    sdists. (:pull:`3252`)
  * Fixed :issue:`2042` regarding wheel building with setup.py using a different
    encoding than the system.
  * Drop PasteScript specific egg_info hack. (:pull:`3270`)
  * Allow combination of pip list options --editable with --outdated/--updtodate.
    (:issue:`933`)
  * Gives VCS implementations control over saying whether a project
    is under their control (:pull:`3258`)
  * Git detection now works when ``setup.py`` is not at the Git repo root
    and when ``package_dir`` is used, so ``pip freeze`` works in more
    cases (:pull:`3258`)
  * Correctly freeze Git develop packages in presence of the &subdirectory
    option (:pull:`3258`)
  * The detection of editable packages now relies on the presence of ``.egg-link``
    instead of looking for a VCS, so ``pip list -e`` is more reliable
    (:pull:`3258`)
  * Add the ``--prefix`` flag to ``pip install`` which allows specifying a root
    prefix to use instead of ``sys.prefix`` (:pull:`3252`).
  * Allow duplicate specifications in the case that only the extras differ, and
    union all specified extras together (:pull:`3198`).
  * Fix the detection of the user's current platform on OSX when determining the
    OSX SDK version (:pull:`3232`).
  * Prevent the automatically built wheels from mistakenly being used across
    multiple versions of Python when they may not be correctly configured for
    that by making the wheel specific to a specific version of Python and
    specific interpreter (:pull:`3225`).
  * Emulate the SOABI support in wheels from Python 2.x on Python 2.x as closely
    as we can with the information available within the interpreter
    (:pull:`3075`).
  * Don't roundtrip to the network when git is pinned to a specific commit hash
    and that hash already exists locally (:pull:`3066`).
  * Prefer wheels built against a newer SDK to wheels built against an older SDK
    on OSX (:pull:`3163`).
  * Show entry points for projects installed via wheel (:pull:`3122`).
  * Improve message when an unexisting path is passed to --find-links option
    (:issue:`2968`).
  * pip freeze does not add the VCS branch/tag name in the #egg=... fragment anymore
    (:pull:`3312`).
  * Warn on installation of editable if the provided #egg=name part does not
    match the metadata produced by `setup.py egg_info`. :issue:`3143`.
  * Add support for .xz files for python versions supporting them (>= 3.3).

- update to 7.1.2:
  * Don't raise an error if pip is not installed when checking for the latest pip
    version.
  * Check that the wheel cache directory is writable before we attempt to write
    cached files to them.
  * Move the pip version check until *after* any installs have been performed,
    thus removing the extraenous warning when upgrading pip.
  * Added debug logging when using a cached wheel.
  * Respect platlib by default on platforms that have it separated from purlib.
  * Upgrade packaging to 15.3.
    * Normalize post-release spellings for rev/r prefixes.
  * Upgrade distlib to 0.2.1.
    * Updated launchers to decode shebangs using UTF-8. This allows non-ASCII
      pathnames to be correctly handled.
    * Ensured that the executable written to shebangs is normcased.
    * Changed ScriptMaker to work better under Jython.
  * Upgrade ipaddress to 1.0.13.
  * Allow constraining versions globally without having to know exactly what will
    be installed by the pip command. :issue:`2731`.
  * Accept --no-binary and --only-binary via pip.conf. :issue:`2867`.
  * Allow ``--allow-all-external`` within a requirements file.
  * Fixed an issue where ``--user`` could not be used when ``--prefix`` was used
    in a distutils configuration file.
  * Fixed an issue where the SOABI tags were not correctly being generated on
    Python 3.5.
  * Fixed an issue where we were advising windows users to upgrade by directly
    executing pip, when that would always fail on Windows.
  * Allow ``~`` to be expanded within a cache directory in all situations.
  * Fixed a regression where ``--no-cache-dir`` would raise an exception, fixes
    :issue:`2855`.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Revert the change (released in v7.0.0) that
    required quoting in requirements files around specifiers containing
    environment markers. (:pull:`2841`)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Revert the accidental introduction of support for
    options interleaved with requirements, version specifiers etc in
    ``requirements`` files. (:pull:`2841`)
  * Expand ``~`` in the cache directory when caching wheels, fixes :issue:`2816`.
  * Use ``python -m pip`` instead of ``pip`` when recommending an upgrade command
    to Windows users.
  * Don't build and cache wheels for non-editable installations from VCSs.
  * Allow ``--allow-all-external`` inside of a requirements.txt file, fixing a
    regression in 7.0.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``--mirror``,
    ``--use-mirrors``, and ``-M`` options.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``zip`` and ``unzip``
    commands.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``--no-install`` and
    ``--no-download`` options.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** No longer implicitly support an insecure origin
    origin, and instead require insecure origins be explicitly trusted with the
    ``--trusted-host`` option.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated link scraping that attempted
    to parse HTML comments for a specially formatted comment.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Requirements in requirements files containing
    markers must now be quoted due to parser changes from (:pull:`2697`) and
    (:pull:`2725`).  For example, use ``"SomeProject; python_version < '2.7'"``,
    not simply ``SomeProject; python_version < '2.7'``
  * Ignores bz2 archives if Python wasn't compiled with bz2 support.
    Fixes :issue:`497`
  * Support ``--install-option`` and ``--global-option`` per requirement in
    requirement files (:pull:`2537`)
  * Build Wheels prior to installing from sdist, caching them in the pip cache
    directory to speed up subsequent installs. (:pull:`2618`)
  * Allow fine grained control over the use of wheels and source builds.
    (:pull:`2699`)
  * ``--no-use-wheel`` and ``--use-wheel`` are deprecated in favour of new
    options ``--no-binary`` and ``--only-binary``. The equivalent of
    ``--no-use-wheel`` is ``--no-binary=:all:``. (:pull:`2699`)
  * The use of ``--install-option``, ``--global-option`` or ``--build-option``
    disable the use of wheels, and the autobuilding of wheels. (:pull:`2711`)
    Fixes :issue:`2677`
  * Improve logging when a requirement marker doesn't match your environment
    (:pull:`2735`)
  * Removed the temporary modifications (that began in pip v1.4 when distribute
    and setuptools merged) that allowed distribute to be considered a conflict to
    setuptools. ``pip install -U setuptools`` will no longer upgrade "distribute"
    to "setuptools".  Instead, use ``pip install -U distribute`` (:pull:`2767`).
  * Only display a warning to upgrade pip when the newest version is a final
    release and it is not a post release of the version we already have
    installed (:pull:`2766`).
  * Display a warning when attempting to access a repository that uses HTTPS when
    we don't have Python compiled with SSL support (:pull:`2761`).
  * Allowing using extras when installing from a file path without requiring the
    use of an editable (:pull:`2785`).
  * Fix an infinite loop when the cache directory is stored on a file system
    which does not support hard links (:pull:`2796`).
  * Remove the implicit debug log that was written on every invocation, instead
    users will need to use ``--log`` if they wish to have one (:pull:`2798`).
  * No longer ignore dependencies which have been added to the standard library,
    instead continue to install them.
  * Fixes :issue:`2502`. Upgrades were failing when no potential links were found
    for dependencies other than the current installation. (:pull:`2538`)
  * Use a smoother progress bar when the terminal is capable of handling it,
    otherwise fallback to the original ASCII based progress bar.
  * Display much less output when `pip install` succeeds, because on success,
    users probably don't care about all the nitty gritty details of compiling and
    installing. When `pip install` fails, display the failed install output once
    instead of twice, because once is enough. (:pull:`2487`)
  * Upgrade the bundled copy of requests to 2.6.0, fixing CVE-2015-2296.
  * Display format of latest package when using ``pip list --outdated``.
    (:pull:`2475`)
  * Don't use pywin32 as ctypes should always be available on Windows, using
    pywin32 prevented uninstallation of pywin32 on Windows. (:pull:`2467`)
  * Normalize the ``--wheel-dir`` option, expanding out constructs such as ``~``
    when used (:pull:`2441`).
  * Display a warning when an undefined extra has been requested. (:pull:`2142`)
  * Speed up installing a directory in certain cases by creating a sdist instead
    of copying the entire directory. (:pull:`2535`)
  * Don't follow symlinks when uninstalling files (:pull:`2552`)
  * Upgrade the bundled copy of cachecontrol from 0.11.1 to 0.11.2.
    Fixes :issue:`2481` (:pull:`2595`)
  * Attempt to more smartly choose the order of installation to try and install
    dependencies before the projects that depend on them. (:pull:`2616`)
  * Skip trying to install libraries which are part of the standard library.
    (:pull:`2636`, :pull:`2602`)
  * Support arch specific wheels that are not tied to a specific Python ABI.
    (:pull:`2561`)
  * Output warnings and errors to stderr instead of stdout. (:pull:`2543`)
  * Adjust the cache dir file checks to only check ownership if the effective
    user is root. (:pull:`2396`)
  * Install headers into a per project name directory instead of all of them into
    the root directory when inside of a virtual environment. (:pull:`2421`)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 18 17:30:07 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 6.0.8:
  * Fix an issue where the ``--download`` flag would cause pip to no longer use
    randomized build directories.
  * Fix an issue where pip did not properly unquote quoted URLs which contain
    characters like PEP 440's epoch separator (``!``).
  * Fix an issue where distutils installed projects were not actually uninstalled
    and deprecate attempting to uninstall them altogether.
  * Retry deleting directories incase a process like an antivirus is holding the
    directory open temporarily.
  * Fix an issue where pip would hide the cursor on Windows but would not reshow
    it.
  * Fix a regression where Numpy requires a build path without symlinks to
    properly build.
  * Fix a broken log message when running ``pip wheel`` without a requirement.
  * Don't mask network errors while downloading the file as a hash failure.
  * Properly create the state file for the pip version check so it only happens
    once a week.
  * Fix an issue where switching between Python 3 and Python 2 would evict cached
    items.
  * Fix a regression where pip would be unable to successfully uninstall a
    project without a normalized version.
  * Continue the regression fix from 6.0.5 which was not a complete fix.
  * Fix a regression with 6.0.4 under Windows where most commands would raise an
    exception due to Windows not having the ``os.geteuid()`` function.
  * Fix an issue where ANSI escape codes would be used on Windows even though the
    Windows shell does not support them, causing odd characters to appear with
    the progress bar.
  * Fix an issue where using -v would cause an exception saying
    ``TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting``.
  * Fix an issue where using -v with dependency links would cause an exception
    saying ``TypeError: 'InstallationCandidate' object is not iterable``.
  * Fix an issue where upgrading distribute would cause an exception saying
    ``TypeError: expected string or buffer``.
  * Show a warning and disable the use of the cache directory when the cache
    directory is not owned by the current use, commonly caused by using ``sudo``
    without the ``-H`` flag.
  * Update PEP 440 support to handle the latest changes to PEP 440, particularly
    the changes to ``>V`` and ``<V`` so that they no longer imply ``!=V.*``.
  * Document the default cache directories for each operating system.
  * Create the cache directory when the pip version check needs to save to it
    instead of silently logging an error.
  * Fix a regression where the ``-q`` flag would not properly suppress the
    display of the progress bars.
  * Fix an issue where the implicit version check new in pip 6.0 could cause pip
    to block for up to 75 seconds if PyPI was not accessible.
  * Make ``--no-index`` imply ``--disable-pip-version-check``.
  * Fix an issue where the output saying that a package was installed would
    report the old version instead of the new version during an upgrade.
  * Fix left over merge conflict markers in the documentation.
  * Document the backwards incompatible PEP 440 change in the 6.0.0 changelog.
  * Fix executable file permissions for Wheel files when using the distutils
    scripts option.
  * Fix a confusing error message when an exceptions was raised at certain
    points in pip's execution.
  * Fix the missing list of versions when a version cannot be found that matches
    the specifiers.
  * Add a warning about the possibly problematic use of > when the given
    specifier doesn't match anything.
  * Fix an issue where installing from a directory would not copy over certain
    directories which were being excluded, however some build systems rely on
    them.
  * **PROCESS** Version numbers are now simply ``X.Y`` where the leading ``1``
    has been dropped.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Dropped support for Python 3.1.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the bundle support which was deprecated in
    1.4. (:pull:`1806`)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** File lists generated by `pip show -f` are now
    rooted at the location reported by show, rather than one (unstated)
    directory lower. (:pull:`1933`)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** The ability to install files over the FTP protocol
    was accidently lost in pip 1.5 and it has now been decided to not restore
    that ability.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** PEP 440 is now fully implemented, this means that
    in some cases versions will sort differently or version specifiers will be
    interpreted differently than previously. The common cases should all function
    similarly to before.
  * **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --download-cache`` and
    ``pip wheel --download-cache`` command line flags have been deprecated and
    the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses
    it's internal HTTP cache which supplants the ``--download-cache`` the
    existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted
    until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see
    https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#caching
  * **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --build`` and ``pip install --no-clean`` are now
    *NOT* deprecated.  This reverses the deprecation that occurred in v1.5.3. See
    :issue:`906` for discussion.
  * **DEPRECATION** Implicitly accessing URLs which point to an origin which is
    not a secure origin, instead requiring an opt-in for each host using the new
    ``--trusted-host`` flag (``pip install --trusted-host example.com foo``).
  * Allow the new ``--trusted-host`` flag to also disable TLS verification for
    a particular hostname.
  * Added a ``--user`` flag to ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list`` to check the
    user site directory only.
  * Fixed :issue:`1873`. Silence byte compile errors when installation succeed.
  * Added a virtualenv-specific configuration file. (:pull:`1364`)
  * Added site-wide configuation files. (:pull:`1978`)
  * Added an automatic check to warn if there is an updated version of pip
    available (:pull:`2049`).
  * `wsgiref` and `argparse` (for >py26) are now excluded from `pip list` and `pip
    freeze` (:pull:`1606`, :pull:`1369`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1424`. Add ``--client-cert`` option for SSL client certificates.
  * Fixed :issue:`1484`. `pip show --files` was broken for wheel installs. (:pull:`35`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1641`. install_lib should take precedence when reading distutils nfig.
    (:pull:`1642`)
  * Send `Accept-Encoding: identity` when downloading files in an attempt to
    convince some servers who double compress the downloaded file to stop doing
    so. (:pull:`1688`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1559`. Stop breaking when given pip commands in uppercase (:pull:725`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1618`. Pip no longer adds duplicate logging consumers, so it
    won't create duplicate output when being called multiple times. (:pull:`1723`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1769`. `pip wheel` now returns an error code if any wheels
    fail to build.
  * Fixed :issue:`1775`. `pip wheel` wasn't building wheels for dependencies of
    editable requirements.
  * Allow the use of ``--no-use-wheel`` within a requirements file. (:pull:`1859`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1680`. Attempt to locate system TLS certificates to use instead
    of the included CA Bundle if possible. (:pull:`1866`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1319`. Allow use of Zip64 extension in Wheels and other zip
    files. (:pull:`1868`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1101`. Properly handle an index or --find-links target which
    has a <base> without a href attribute. (:pull:`1869`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1885`. Properly handle extras when a project is installed
    via Wheel. (:pull:`1896`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1180`. Added support to respect proxies in ``pip search``. It
    also fixes :issue:`932` and :issue:`1104`. (:pull:`1902`)
  * Fixed :issue:`798` and :issue:`1060`. `pip install --download` works with vcs lks.
    (:pull:`1926`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1456`. Disabled warning about insecure index host when using locaost.
    Based off of Guy Rozendorn's work in :pull:`1718`. (:pull:`1967`)
  * Allow the use of OS standard user configuration files instead of ones simply
    based around ``$HOME``. (:pull:`2021`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1825`. When installing directly from wheel paths or urls,
    previous versions were not uninstalled. This also fixes :issue:`804`
    specifically for the case of wheel archives. (:pull:`1838`)
  * Fixed :issue:`2075`, detect the location of the ``.egg-info`` directory by
    looking for any file located inside of it instead of relying on the record
    file listing a directory. (:pull:`2076`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1964`, :issue:`1935`, :issue:`676`, Use a randomized and secure
    default build directory when possible. (:pull:`2122`, CVE-2014-8991)

  * Correct deprecation warning for ``pip install --build`` to only notify when
    the `--build` value is different than the default.
  * **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --build`` and ``pip install --no-clean`` are now
    deprecated.  See :issue:`906` for discussion.

    downloads did occur using requirement specifiers, dependencies weren't
    downloaded (:pull:`1527`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1320`. ``pip wheel`` was not downloading wheels that already exisd (PR
    :issue:`1524`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1111`. ``pip install --download`` was failing using local
    ``--find-links`` (:pull:`1524`)
  * Workaround for Python bug http://bugs.python.org/issue20053 (:pull:`1544`)
  * Don't pass a unicode __file__ to setup.py on Python 2.x (:pull:`1583`)

- Update to version 1.5:
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer supports the --use-mirrors,
    -M, and --mirrors flags. The mirroring support has been removed. In
    order to use a mirror specify it as the primary index with -i or
    --index-url, or as an additional index with --extra-index-url. (Pull #1098, CVE-2013-5123)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer will scrape insecure external urls by
    default nor will it install externally hosted files by default. Users may opt
    into installing externally hosted or insecure files or urls using
    --allow-external PROJECT and --allow-unverified PROJECT. (Pull #1055)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer respects dependency links by default.
    Users may opt into respecting them again using --process-dependency-links.
  * **DEPRECATION** pip install --no-install and pip install
    --no-download are now formally deprecated.  See Issue #906 for discussion on
    possible alternatives, or lack thereof, in future releases.
  * **DEPRECATION** pip zip and pip unzip are now formally deprecated.
  * pip will now install Mac OSX platform wheels from PyPI. (Pull #1278)
  * pip now generates the appropriate platform-specific console scripts when
    installing wheels. (Pull #1251)
  * Pip now confirms a wheel is supported when installing directly from a path or
    url. (Pull #1315)
  * Fixed #1097, --ignore-installed now behaves again as designed, after it was
    unintentionally broke in v0.8.3 when fixing Issue #14 (Pull #1352).
  * Fixed a bug where global scripts were being removed when uninstalling --user
    installed packages (Pull #1353).
  * Fixed #1163, --user wasn't being respected when installing scripts from wheels (Pull #1176).
  * Fixed #1150, we now assume '_' means '-' in versions from wheel filenames (Pull #1158).
  * Fixed #219, error when using --log with a failed install (Pull #1205).
  * Fixed #1131, logging was buffered and choppy in Python 3.
  * Fixed #70,  --timeout was being ignored (Pull #1202).
  * Fixed #772, error when setting PIP_EXISTS_ACTION (Pull #1201).
  * Added colors to the logging output in order to draw attention to important
    warnings and errors. (Pull #1109)
  * Added warnings when using an insecure index, find-link, or dependency link. (Pull #1121)
  * Added support for installing packages from a subdirectory using the subdirectory
    editable option. ( Pull #1082 )
  * Fixed #1192. "TypeError: bad operand type for unary" in some cases when
    installing wheels using --find-links (Pull #1218).
  * Fixed #1133 and #317. Archive contents are now written based on system
    defaults and umask (i.e. permissions are not preserved), except that regular
    files with any execute permissions have the equivalent of "chmod +x" applied
    after being written (Pull #1146).
  * PreviousBuildDirError now returns a non-zero exit code and prevents the
    previous build dir from being cleaned in all cases (Pull #1162).
  * Renamed --allow-insecure to --allow-unverified, however the old name will
    continue to work for a period of time (Pull #1257).
  * Fixed #1006, error when installing local projects with symlinks in
    Python 3. (Pull #1311)
  * The previously hidden --log-file otion, is now shown as a general option.
    (Pull #1316)

Mon Jul 29 14:49:27 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 1.4:
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip now only installs stable versions by default,
    and offers a new --pre option to also find pre-release and development
    versions. (Pull #834)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Dropped support for Python 2.5. The minimum
    supported Python version for pip 1.4 is Python 2.6.
  * Added support for installing and building wheel archives.
    Thanks Daniel Holth, Marcus Smith, Paul Moore, and Michele Lacchia
    (Pull #845)
  * Applied security patch to pip's ssl support related to certificate DNS
    wildcard matching (http://bugs.python.org/issue17980).
  * To satisfy pip's setuptools requirement, pip now recommends setuptools>=0.8,
    not distribute. setuptools and distribute are now merged into one project
    called 'setuptools'. (Pull #1003)
  * pip will now warn when installing a file that is either hosted externally to
    the index or cannot be verified with a hash. In the future pip will default
    to not installing them and will require the flags --allow-external NAME, and
    --allow-insecure NAME respectively. (Pull #985)
  * If an already-downloaded or cached file has a bad hash, re-download it rather
    than erroring out. (Issue #963).
  * pip bundle and support for installing from pybundle files is now
    considered deprecated and will be removed in pip v1.5.
  * Fixed a number of issues (#413, #709, #634, #602, and #939) related to
    cleaning up and not reusing build directories. (Pull #865, #948)
  * Added a User Agent so that pip is identifiable in logs. (Pull #901)

    Thanks Georgi Valkov. (Pull #744; Pull #721 contains preceding
    refactor)

    archive name. Thanks Marc Abramowitz (Pull #687)
  * Fix to prevent unnecessary PyPI redirects. Thanks Alex
    Gronholm (Pull #695)

    (Issue #253 / Pull #693)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  8 22:31:31 UTC 2012 - os-dev@jacraig.com

  * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.2 about raising an exception when

  * **Dropped support for Python 2.4** The minimum supported Python version is
    now Python 2.5.
  * Fixed issue #605 - pypi mirror support broken on some DNS responses.

  * Fixed issues #493, #494, #440, and #573 related to improving support for
    the user installation scheme.
  * Write failure log to temp file if default location is not writable.
  * Pull in submodules for git editable checkouts. Fixes #289 and #421.

  * Added --egg flag to request egg-style rather than flat installation.
    Refs issue #3.
  * Fixed issue #510 - prevent e.g. gmpy2-2.0.tar.gz from matching a
    request to pip install gmpy; sdist filename must begin with full
    project name followed by a dash.
  * Fixed issue #504 - allow package URLS to have querystrings.
  * Fixed issue #58 - pip freeze now falls back to non-editable format rather
    than blowing up if it can't determine the origin repository of an editable.

    that support it.
  * Fixed issue #487 - upgrade from VCS url of project that does exist on

    found or accessed.

    Python default instead.

    This re-enables using ==dev in requirements files.
  * Moved tests to be run on Travis CI: http://travis-ci.org/pypa/pip
  * Added a better help formatter.
- Remove %check section: there is no test directory so it won't get executed.

  * Added support for authentication with Subversion repositories.
  * Fixed issue #315 - --download now downloads dependencies as well.

  * Fixed issue #369 - compatibility with Subversion 1.7.

    installs.

    in sdist filenames.

  * Fixed issue #288 - handle symlinks properly.
  * Fixed issue #49 - pip install -U no longer reinstalls the same versions
    of packages.
  * Removed -E option and PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV; both use a restart-in-venv
    mechanism that's broken, and neither one is useful since every virtualenv
    now has pip inside it.
  * Fixed issue #366 - pip throws IndexError when it calls scraped_rel_links
  * Fixed issue #22 - pip search should set and return a userful shell
    status code
  * Fixed issue #351 and #365 - added global --exists-action command line
    option to easier script file exists conflicts, e.g. from editable
    requirements from VCS that have a changed repo URL.
