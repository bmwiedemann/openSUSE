Fri May 10 23:17:02 CEST 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 19.1.1:
  - Restore pyproject.toml handling to how it was with pip 19.0.3
    to prevent the need to add --no-use-pep517 when installing in
    editable mode. (#6434)
  - Fix a regression that caused @ to be quoted in pypiserver
    links. This interfered with parsing the revision string from
    VCS urls. (#6440)
  - Configuration files may now also be stored under sys.prefix
    (#5060)
  - Avoid creating an unnecessary local clone of a Bazaar branch
    when exporting. (#5443)
  - Include in pip's User-Agent string whether it looks like pip
    is running under CI. (#5499)
  - A custom (JSON-encoded) string can now be added to pip's
    User-Agent using the PIP_USER_AGENT_USER_DATA environment
    variable. (#5549)
  - For consistency, passing --no-cache-dir no longer affects
    whether wheels will be built. In this case, a temporary
    directory is used. (#5749)
  - Command arguments in subprocess log messages are now quoted
    using shlex.quote(). (#6290)
  - Prefix warning and error messages in log output with WARNING
    and ERROR. (#6298)
  - Using --build-options in a PEP 517 build now fails with an
    error, rather than silently ignoring the option. (#6305)
  - Error out with an informative message if one tries to install
    a pyproject.toml-style (PEP 517) source tree using --editable
    mode. (#6314)
  - When downloading a package, the ETA and average speed now
    only update once per second for better legibility. (#6319)
  - The stdout and stderr from VCS commands run by pip as
    subprocesses (e.g. git, hg, etc.) no longer pollute pip's
    stdout. (#1219)
  - Fix handling of requests exceptions when dependencies are
    debundled. (#4195)
  - Make pip's self version check avoid recommending upgrades to
    prereleases if the currently-installed version is stable.
    (#5175)
  - Fixed crash when installing a requirement from a URL that
    comes from a dependency without a URL. (#5889)
  - Improve handling of file URIs: correctly handle
    file://localhost/... and don't try to use UNC paths on Unix.
    (#5892)
  - Fix utils.encoding.auto_decode() LookupError with invalid
    encodings. utils.encoding.auto_decode() was broken when
    decoding Big Endian BOM byte-strings on Little Endian or vice
    versa. (#6054)
  - Fix incorrect URL quoting of IPv6 addresses. (#6285)
  - Redact the password from the extra index URL when using pip
    -v. (#6295)
  - The spinner no longer displays a completion message after
    subprocess calls not needing a spinner. It also no longer
    incorrectly reports an error after certain subprocess calls
    to Git that succeeded. (#6312)
  - Fix the handling of editable mode during installs when
    pyproject.toml is present but PEP 517 doesn't require the
    source tree to be treated as pyproject.toml-style. (#6370)
  - Fix NameError when handling an invalid requirement. (#6419)
  - Make dashes render correctly when displaying long options
    like --find-links in the text. (#6422)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 10 16:35:47 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 19.0.3:
  * Fix an IndexError crash when a legacy build of a wheel
    fails. (#6252)
  * Fix a regression introduced in 19.0.2 where the filename in a
    RECORD file of an installed file would not be updated when
    installing a wheel. (#6266)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 10:06:06 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Avoid name repetition in summary. Summary should not be a
  sentence (let alone three).

Mon Feb 11 13:54:34 UTC 2019 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to 19.0.2 (2019-02-09):
  + Bug Fixes
    * Fix a crash where PEP 517-based builds using --no-cache-dir
      would fail in some circumstances with an AssertionError due
      to not finalizing a build directory internally. (#6197)
    * Provide a better error message if attempting an editable
      install of a directory with a pyproject.toml but no setup.py.
      (#6170)
    * The implicit default backend used for projects that provide a
      pyproject.toml file without explicitly specifying build-
      backend now behaves more like direct execution of setup.py,
      and hence should restore compatibility with projects that
      were unable to be installed with pip 19.0. This raised the
      minimum required version of setuptools for such builds to
      40.8.0. (#6163)
    * Allow RECORD lines with more than three elements, and display
      a warning. (#6165)
    * AdjacentTempDirectory fails on unwritable directory instead
      of locking up the uninstall command. (#6169)
    * Make failed uninstalls roll back more reliably and better at
      avoiding naming conflicts. (#6194)
    * Ensure the correct wheel file is copied when building PEP 517
      distribution is built. (#6196)
    * The Python 2 end of life warning now only shows on CPython,
      which is the implementation that has announced end of life
      plans. (#6207)
  + Improved Documentation
    * Re-write README and documentation index (#5815)

- Update to 19.0.1 (2019-01-23):

      Python 2.7 End-of-life and prompt users to start migrating to
      Python 3. (#6148)
    * Remove the deprecated --process-dependency-links option.
      (#6060)
    * Remove the deprecated SVN editable detection based on
      dependency links during freeze. (#5866)
  + Features
    * Implement PEP 517 (allow projects to specify a build backend
      via pyproject.toml). (#5743)
    * Implement manylinux2010 platform tag support. manylinux2010
      is the successor to manylinux1. It allows carefully compiled
      binary wheels to be installed on compatible Linux platforms.
      (#5008)
    * Improve build isolation: handle .pth files, so namespace
      packages are correctly supported under Python 3.2 and
      earlier. (#5656)
    * Include the package name in a freeze warning if the package
      is not installed. (#5943)
    * Warn when dropping an --[extra-]index-url value that points
      to an existing local directory. (#5827)
    * Prefix pip’s --log file lines with their timestamp. (#6141)
  + Bug Fixes
    * Avoid creating excessively long temporary paths when
      uninstalling packages. (#3055)
    * Redact the password from the URL in various log messages.
      (#4746, #6124)
    * Avoid creating excessively long temporary paths when
      uninstalling packages. (#3055)
    * Avoid printing a stack trace when given an invalid
      requirement. (#5147)
    * Present 401 warning if username/password do not work for URL
      (#4833)
    * Handle requests.exceptions.RetryError raised in PackageFinder
      that was causing pip to fail silently when some indexes were
      unreachable. (#5270, #5483)
    * Handle a broken stdout pipe more gracefully (e.g. when
      running pip list | head). (#4170)
    * Fix crash from setting PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=yes. (#5385)
    * Fix crash from unparseable requirements when checking
      installed packages. (#5839)
    * Fix content type detection if a directory named like an
      archive is used as a package source. (#5838)
    * Fix listing of outdated packages that are not dependencies of
      installed packages in pip list --outdated --not-required
      (#5737)
    * Fix sorting TypeError in move_wheel_files() when installing
      some packages. (#5868)
    * Fix support for invoking pip using python src/pip ....
      (#5841)
    * Greatly reduce memory usage when installing wheels containing
      large files. (#5848)
    * Editable non-VCS installs now freeze as editable. (#5031)
    * Editable Git installs without a remote now freeze as
      editable. (#4759)
    * Canonicalize sdist file names so they can be matched to a
      canonicalized package name passed to pip install. (#5870)
    * Properly decode special characters in SVN URL credentials.
      (#5968)
    * Make PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR disable the cache also for truthy
      values like "true", "yes", "1", etc. (#5735)
  + Vendored Libraries
    * Include license text of vendored 3rd party libraries. (#5213)

- specfile:
  * remove devel from noarch

- update to version 18.1:
  * Features
    + Allow PEP 508 URL requirements to be used as dependencies.
    + As a security measure, pip will raise an exception when
      installing packages from PyPI if those packages depend on
      packages not also hosted on PyPI. In the future, PyPI will block
      uploading packages with such external URL dependencies
      directly. (#4187)
    + Upgrade pyparsing to 2.2.1. (#5013)
    + Allows dist options (–abi, –python-version, –platform,
      –implementation) when installing with –target (#5355)
    + Support passing svn+ssh URLs with a username to pip install
      -e. (#5375)
    + pip now ensures that the RECORD file is sorted when installing
      from a wheel file. (#5525)
    + Add support for Python 3.7. (#5561)
    + Malformed configuration files now show helpful error messages,
      instead of tracebacks. (#5798)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Checkout the correct branch when doing an editable Git
      install. (#2037)
    + Run self-version-check only on commands that may access the
      index, instead of trying on every run and failing to do so due
      to missing options. (#5433)
    + Allow a Git ref to be installed over an existing
      installation. (#5624)
    + Show a better error message when a configuration option has an
      invalid value. (#5644)
    + Always revalidate cached simple API pages instead of blindly
      caching them for up to 10 minutes. (#5670)
    + Avoid caching self-version-check information when cache is
      disabled. (#5679)
    + Avoid traceback printing on autocomplete after flags in the
      CLI. (#5751)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  8 14:53:21 UTC 2017 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to version 9.0.1:
  * Correct the deprecation message when not specifying a --format so
    that it uses the correct setting name ("format") rather than the
    incorrect one ("list_format") (:issue:`4058`).
  * Fix "pip check" to check all available distributions and not just
    the local ones (:issue:`4083`).
  * Fix a crash on non ASCII characters from `lsb_release`
    (:issue:`4062`).
  * Fix an SyntaxError in an an used module of a vendored dependency
    (:issue:`4059`).
  * Fix UNC paths on Windows (:issue:`4064`).

- update to version 9.0.0:
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the attempted autodetection of
    requirement names from URLs, URLs must include a name via
    "#egg=".
  * **DEPRECATION** "pip install --egg" have been deprecated and will
    be removed in the future. This "feature" has a long list of
    drawbacks which break nearly all of pip's other features in
    subtle and hard-to-diagnose ways.
  * **DEPRECATION** "--default-vcs" option (:issue:`4052`).
  * **WARNING** pip 9 cache can break forward compatibility with
    previous pip versions if your package repository allows chunked
    responses (:issue:`4078`).
  * Add a "pip check" command to check installed packages dependencies
    (:pull:`3750`).
  * Add option allowing user to abort pip operation if file/directory
    exists
  * Add Appveyor CI
  * Uninstall existing packages when performing an editable
    installation of the same packages (:issue:`1548`).
  * "pip show" is less verbose by default. "--verbose" prints
    multiline fields.  (:pull:`3858`).
  * Add optional column formatting to "pip list" (:issue:`3651`).
  * Add "--not-required" option to "pip list", which lists packages
    that are not dependencies of other packages.
  * Fix builds on systems with symlinked "/tmp" directory for custom
    builds such as numpy (:pull:`3701`).
  * Fix regression in "pip freeze": when there is more than one git
    remote, priority is given to the remote named "origin"
    (:pull:`3708`, :issue:`3616`).
  * Fix crash when calling "pip freeze" with invalid requirement
    installed (:pull:`3704`, :issue:`3681`).
  * Allow multiple "--requirement" files in "pip freeze"
    (:pull:`3703`).
  * Implementation of pep-503 "data-requires-python". When this field
    is present for a release link, pip will ignore the download when
    installing to a Python version that doesn't satisfy the
    requirement.
  * "pip wheel" now works on editable packages too (it was only
    working on editable dependencies before); this allows running "pip
    wheel" on the result of "pip freeze" in presence of editable
    requirements (:pull:`3695`, :issue:`3291`).
  * Load credentials from ".netrc" files (:pull:`3715`,
    :issue:`3569`).
  * Add "--platform", "--python-version", "--implementation" and
    "--abi" parameters to "pip download". These allow utilities and
    advanced users to gather distributions for interpreters other than
    the one pip is being run on.  (:pull:`3760`)
  * Skip scanning virtual environments, even when venv/bin/python is a
    dangling symlink.
  * Added "pip completion" support for the "fish" shell.
  * Fix problems on Windows on Python 2 when username or hostname
    contains non-ASCII characters (:issue:`3463`, :pull:`3970`,
    :pull:`4000`).
  * Use "git fetch --tags" to fetch tags in addition to everything
    else that is normally fetched; this is necessary in case a git
    requirement url points to a tag or commit that is not on a branch
    (:pull:`3791`)
  * Normalize package names before using in "pip show" (:issue:`3976`)
  * Raise when Requires-Python do not match the running version and
    add "--ignore-requires-python" option as escape hatch
    (:pull:`3846`).
  * Report the correct installed version when performing an upgrade in
    some corner cases (:issue:`2382`)
  * Add "-i" shorthand for "--index" flag in "pip search"
  * Do not optionally load C dependencies in requests (:issue:`1840`,
    :issue:`2930`, :issue:`3024`)
  * Strip authentication from SVN url prior to passing it to "svn"
    (:pull:`3697`, :issue:`3209`).
  * Also install in platlib with "--target" option (:pull:`3694`,
    :issue:`3682`).
  * Restore the ability to use inline comments in requirements files
    passed to "pip freeze" (:issue:`3680`).

    required wheel is supported. Solves (:issue:`3254`).
  * Make glibc parsing for `manylinux1` support more robust for the variety of
    glibc versions found in the wild (:issue:`3588`).
  * Update environment marker support to fully support PEP 508 and legacy
    environment markers (:issue:`3624`).
  * Always use debug logging to the ``--log`` file (:issue:`3351`).
  * Don't attempt to wrap search results for extremely narrow terminal windows
    (:issue:`3655`).
  * Fix regression with non-ascii requirement files on Python 2 and add support
    for encoding headers in requirement files (:issue:`3548`, :pull:`3547`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  9 09:46:20 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 8.1.0:
  * Implement PEP 513, which adds support for the manylinux1 platform tag,
    allowing carefully compiled binary wheels to be installed on compatible Linux
    platforms.
  * Allow wheels which are not specific to a particular Python interpreter but
    which are specific to a particular platform (:issue:`3202`).
  * Fixed an issue where ``call_subprocess`` would crash trying to print debug
    data on child process failure (:issue:`3521`, :pull:`3522`).
  * Exclude the wheel package from the `pip freeze` output (like pip and setuptools).
    :issue:`2989`.
  * Allow installing modules from a subdirectory of a vcs repository
    in non-editable mode (:issue:`3217`, :pull:`3466`).
  * Make pip wheel and pip download work with vcs urls with subdirectory option
    (:pull:`3466`).
  * Show classifiers in ``pip show``.
  * Show PEP376 Installer in ``pip show`` (:issue:`3517`).

  * Decode requirement files according to their BOM if present (:pull:`3485`,
    :issue:`2865`).
  * Fix and deprecate package name detection from url path (:issue:`3523` and
    :pull:`3495`).
  * Correct the behavior where interpreter specific tags (such as cp34) were
    being used on later versions of the same interprter instead of only for that
    specific interpreter (:issue:`3472`).
  * Fix an issue where pip would erroneously install a 64 bit wheel on a 32 bit
    Python running on a 64 bit OS X machine.
  * Do not assume that all git repositories have an origin remote.
  * Correctly display the line to add to a requirements.txt for an URL based
    dependency when ``--require-hashes`` is enabled.
  * Make ``install --quiet`` really quiet. See :issue:`3418`.
  * Fix a bug when removing packages in python 3: disable INI-style parsing of the
    entry_point.txt file to allow entry point names with colons (:pull:`3434`)
  * Normalize generated script files path in RECORD files. (:pull:`3448`)
  * Fix bug introduced in 8.0.0 where subcommand output was not shown,
    even when the user specified ``-v`` / ``--verbose``. :issue:`3486`.
  * Enable python -W with respect to PipDeprecationWarning. (:pull:`3455`)
  * Upgrade distlib to 0.2.2 (fix :issue:`3467`):
    * Improved support for Jython when quoting executables in output scripts.
  * Add a `--all` option to `pip freeze` to include usually skipped package
    (like pip, setuptools and wheel) to the freeze output. :issue:`1610`.
  * Stop attempting to trust the system CA trust store because it's extremely
    common for them to be broken, often in incompatible ways. See :pull:`3416`.
  * Detect CAPaths in addition to CAFiles on platforms that provide them.
  * Installing argparse or wsgiref will no longer warn or error - pip will allow
    the installation even though it may be useless (since the installed thing
    will be shadowed by the standard library).
  * Upgrading a distutils installed item that is installed outside of a virtual
    environment, while inside of a virtual environment will no longer warn or
    error.
  * Fix a bug where pre-releases were showing up in ``pip list --outdated``
    without the ``--pre`` flag.
  * Switch the SOABI emulation from using RuntimeWarnings to debug logging.
  * Rollback the removal of the ability to uninstall distutils installed items
    until a future date.

- Update to 0.8.0
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Drop support for Python 3.2.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Remove the ability to find any files other than the
    ones directly linked from the index or find-links pages.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Remove the ``--download-cache`` which had been
    deprecated and no-op'd in 6.0.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Remove the ``--log-explicit-levels`` which had been
    deprecated in 6.0.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE Change pip wheel --wheel-dir default path from
    <cwd>/wheelhouse to <cwd>.
  * Deprecate and no-op the ``--allow-external``, ``--allow-all-external``, and
    ``--allow-unverified`` functionality that was added as part of PEP 438. With
    changes made to the repository protocol made in PEP 470, these options are no
    longer functional.
  * Allow ``--trusted-host`` within a requirements file. :issue:`2822`.
  * Allow ``--process-dependency-links`` within a requirements file. :issue:`1274`.
  * Allow ``--pre`` within a requirements file. :issue:`1273`.
  * Allow repository URLs with secure transports to count as trusted. (E.g.,
    "git+ssh" is okay.) :issue:`2811`.
  * Implement a top-level ``pip download`` command and deprecate
    ``pip install --download``.
  * Fixed :issue:`3141`, when uninstalling, look for the case of paths containing
    symlinked directories (:pull:`3154`)
  * When installing, if building a wheel fails, clear up the build directory
    before falling back to a source install. :issue:`3047`.
  * Fix user directory expansion when ``HOME=/``. Workaround for Python bug
    http://bugs.python.org/issue14768, reported in :issue:`2996`.
  * Fixed :issue:`3009`, correct reporting of requirements file line numbers
    (:pull:`3125`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1062`, Exception(IOError) for ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list``
    commands with subversion >= 1.7. (:pull:`3346`)
  * Provide a spinner showing that progress is happening when installing or
    building a package via ``setup.py``. This will alleviate concerns that
    projects with unusually long build times have with pip appearing to stall.
  * Include the functionality of ``peep`` into pip, allowing hashes to be baked
    into a requirements file and ensuring that the packages being downloaded
    match one of those hashes. This is an additional, opt-in security measure
    that, when used, removes the need to trust the repository.
  * Fix a bug causing pip to not select a wheel compiled against an OSX SDK later
    than what Python itself was compiled against when running on a newer version
    of OSX.
  * Add a new ``--prefix`` option for ``pip install`` that supports wheels and
    sdists. (:pull:`3252`)
  * Fixed :issue:`2042` regarding wheel building with setup.py using a different
    encoding than the system.
  * Drop PasteScript specific egg_info hack. (:pull:`3270`)
  * Allow combination of pip list options --editable with --outdated/--updtodate.
    (:issue:`933`)
  * Gives VCS implementations control over saying whether a project
    is under their control (:pull:`3258`)
  * Git detection now works when ``setup.py`` is not at the Git repo root
    and when ``package_dir`` is used, so ``pip freeze`` works in more
    cases (:pull:`3258`)
  * Correctly freeze Git develop packages in presence of the &subdirectory
    option (:pull:`3258`)
  * The detection of editable packages now relies on the presence of ``.egg-link``
    instead of looking for a VCS, so ``pip list -e`` is more reliable
    (:pull:`3258`)
  * Add the ``--prefix`` flag to ``pip install`` which allows specifying a root
    prefix to use instead of ``sys.prefix`` (:pull:`3252`).
  * Allow duplicate specifications in the case that only the extras differ, and
    union all specified extras together (:pull:`3198`).
  * Fix the detection of the user's current platform on OSX when determining the
    OSX SDK version (:pull:`3232`).
  * Prevent the automatically built wheels from mistakenly being used across
    multiple versions of Python when they may not be correctly configured for
    that by making the wheel specific to a specific version of Python and
    specific interpreter (:pull:`3225`).
  * Emulate the SOABI support in wheels from Python 2.x on Python 2.x as closely
    as we can with the information available within the interpreter
    (:pull:`3075`).
  * Don't roundtrip to the network when git is pinned to a specific commit hash
    and that hash already exists locally (:pull:`3066`).
  * Prefer wheels built against a newer SDK to wheels built against an older SDK
    on OSX (:pull:`3163`).
  * Show entry points for projects installed via wheel (:pull:`3122`).
  * Improve message when an unexisting path is passed to --find-links option
    (:issue:`2968`).
  * pip freeze does not add the VCS branch/tag name in the #egg=... fragment anymore
    (:pull:`3312`).
  * Warn on installation of editable if the provided #egg=name part does not
    match the metadata produced by `setup.py egg_info`. :issue:`3143`.
  * Add support for .xz files for python versions supporting them (>= 3.3).
    :issue:`722`.

Fri Sep 25 08:16:40 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 7.1.2:
  * Don't raise an error if pip is not installed when checking for the latest pip
    version.
  * Check that the wheel cache directory is writable before we attempt to write
    cached files to them.
  * Move the pip version check until *after* any installs have been performed,
    thus removing the extraenous warning when upgrading pip.
  * Added debug logging when using a cached wheel.
  * Respect platlib by default on platforms that have it separated from purlib.
  * Upgrade packaging to 15.3.
    * Normalize post-release spellings for rev/r prefixes.
  * Upgrade distlib to 0.2.1.
    * Updated launchers to decode shebangs using UTF-8. This allows non-ASCII
      pathnames to be correctly handled.
    * Ensured that the executable written to shebangs is normcased.
    * Changed ScriptMaker to work better under Jython.
  * Upgrade ipaddress to 1.0.13.
  * Allow constraining versions globally without having to know exactly what will
    be installed by the pip command. :issue:`2731`.
  * Accept --no-binary and --only-binary via pip.conf. :issue:`2867`.
  * Allow ``--allow-all-external`` within a requirements file.
  * Fixed an issue where ``--user`` could not be used when ``--prefix`` was used
    in a distutils configuration file.
  * Fixed an issue where the SOABI tags were not correctly being generated on
    Python 3.5.
  * Fixed an issue where we were advising windows users to upgrade by directly
    executing pip, when that would always fail on Windows.
  * Allow ``~`` to be expanded within a cache directory in all situations.
  * Fixed a regression where ``--no-cache-dir`` would raise an exception, fixes
    :issue:`2855`.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Revert the change (released in v7.0.0) that
    required quoting in requirements files around specifiers containing
    environment markers. (:pull:`2841`)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Revert the accidental introduction of support for
    options interleaved with requirements, version specifiers etc in
    ``requirements`` files. (:pull:`2841`)
  * Expand ``~`` in the cache directory when caching wheels, fixes :issue:`2816`.
  * Use ``python -m pip`` instead of ``pip`` when recommending an upgrade command
    to Windows users.
  * Don't build and cache wheels for non-editable installations from VCSs.
  * Allow ``--allow-all-external`` inside of a requirements.txt file, fixing a
    regression in 7.0.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``--mirror``,
    ``--use-mirrors``, and ``-M`` options.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``zip`` and ``unzip``
    commands.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``--no-install`` and
    ``--no-download`` options.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** No longer implicitly support an insecure origin
    origin, and instead require insecure origins be explicitly trusted with the
    ``--trusted-host`` option.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated link scraping that attempted
    to parse HTML comments for a specially formatted comment.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Requirements in requirements files containing
    markers must now be quoted due to parser changes from (:pull:`2697`) and
    (:pull:`2725`).  For example, use ``"SomeProject; python_version < '2.7'"``,
    not simply ``SomeProject; python_version < '2.7'``
  * Ignores bz2 archives if Python wasn't compiled with bz2 support.
    Fixes :issue:`497`
  * Support ``--install-option`` and ``--global-option`` per requirement in
    requirement files (:pull:`2537`)
  * Build Wheels prior to installing from sdist, caching them in the pip cache
    directory to speed up subsequent installs. (:pull:`2618`)
  * Allow fine grained control over the use of wheels and source builds.
    (:pull:`2699`)
  * ``--no-use-wheel`` and ``--use-wheel`` are deprecated in favour of new
    options ``--no-binary`` and ``--only-binary``. The equivalent of
    ``--no-use-wheel`` is ``--no-binary=:all:``. (:pull:`2699`)
  * The use of ``--install-option``, ``--global-option`` or ``--build-option``
    disable the use of wheels, and the autobuilding of wheels. (:pull:`2711`)
    Fixes :issue:`2677`
  * Improve logging when a requirement marker doesn't match your environment
    (:pull:`2735`)
  * Removed the temporary modifications (that began in pip v1.4 when distribute
    and setuptools merged) that allowed distribute to be considered a conflict to
    setuptools. ``pip install -U setuptools`` will no longer upgrade "distribute"
    to "setuptools".  Instead, use ``pip install -U distribute`` (:pull:`2767`).
  * Only display a warning to upgrade pip when the newest version is a final
    release and it is not a post release of the version we already have
    installed (:pull:`2766`).
  * Display a warning when attempting to access a repository that uses HTTPS when
    we don't have Python compiled with SSL support (:pull:`2761`).
  * Allowing using extras when installing from a file path without requiring the
    use of an editable (:pull:`2785`).
  * Fix an infinite loop when the cache directory is stored on a file system
    which does not support hard links (:pull:`2796`).
  * Remove the implicit debug log that was written on every invocation, instead
    users will need to use ``--log`` if they wish to have one (:pull:`2798`).
  * No longer ignore dependencies which have been added to the standard library,
    instead continue to install them.
  * Fixes :issue:`2502`. Upgrades were failing when no potential links were found
    for dependencies other than the current installation. (:pull:`2538`)
  * Use a smoother progress bar when the terminal is capable of handling it,
    otherwise fallback to the original ASCII based progress bar.
  * Display much less output when `pip install` succeeds, because on success,
    users probably don't care about all the nitty gritty details of compiling and
    installing. When `pip install` fails, display the failed install output once
    instead of twice, because once is enough. (:pull:`2487`)
  * Upgrade the bundled copy of requests to 2.6.0, fixing CVE-2015-2296.
  * Display format of latest package when using ``pip list --outdated``.
    (:pull:`2475`)
  * Don't use pywin32 as ctypes should always be available on Windows, using
    pywin32 prevented uninstallation of pywin32 on Windows. (:pull:`2467`)
  * Normalize the ``--wheel-dir`` option, expanding out constructs such as ``~``
    when used (:pull:`2441`).
  * Display a warning when an undefined extra has been requested. (:pull:`2142`)
  * Speed up installing a directory in certain cases by creating a sdist instead
    of copying the entire directory. (:pull:`2535`)
  * Don't follow symlinks when uninstalling files (:pull:`2552`)
  * Upgrade the bundled copy of cachecontrol from 0.11.1 to 0.11.2.
    Fixes :issue:`2481` (:pull:`2595`)
  * Attempt to more smartly choose the order of installation to try and install
    dependencies before the projects that depend on them. (:pull:`2616`)
  * Skip trying to install libraries which are part of the standard library.
    (:pull:`2636`, :pull:`2602`)
  * Support arch specific wheels that are not tied to a specific Python ABI.
    (:pull:`2561`)
  * Output warnings and errors to stderr instead of stdout. (:pull:`2543`)
  * Adjust the cache dir file checks to only check ownership if the effective
    user is root. (:pull:`2396`)
  * Install headers into a per project name directory instead of all of them into
    the root directory when inside of a virtual environment. (:pull:`2421`)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 18 17:30:07 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 6.0.8:
  * Fix an issue where the ``--download`` flag would cause pip to no longer use
    randomized build directories.
  * Fix an issue where pip did not properly unquote quoted URLs which contain
    characters like PEP 440's epoch separator (``!``).
  * Fix an issue where distutils installed projects were not actually uninstalled
    and deprecate attempting to uninstall them altogether.
  * Retry deleting directories incase a process like an antivirus is holding the
    directory open temporarily.
  * Fix an issue where pip would hide the cursor on Windows but would not reshow
    it.
  * Fix a regression where Numpy requires a build path without symlinks to
    properly build.
  * Fix a broken log message when running ``pip wheel`` without a requirement.
  * Don't mask network errors while downloading the file as a hash failure.
  * Properly create the state file for the pip version check so it only happens
    once a week.
  * Fix an issue where switching between Python 3 and Python 2 would evict cached
    items.
  * Fix a regression where pip would be unable to successfully uninstall a
    project without a normalized version.
  * Continue the regression fix from 6.0.5 which was not a complete fix.
  * Fix a regression with 6.0.4 under Windows where most commands would raise an
    exception due to Windows not having the ``os.geteuid()`` function.
  * Fix an issue where ANSI escape codes would be used on Windows even though the
    Windows shell does not support them, causing odd characters to appear with
    the progress bar.
  * Fix an issue where using -v would cause an exception saying
    ``TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting``.
  * Fix an issue where using -v with dependency links would cause an exception
    saying ``TypeError: 'InstallationCandidate' object is not iterable``.
  * Fix an issue where upgrading distribute would cause an exception saying
    ``TypeError: expected string or buffer``.
  * Show a warning and disable the use of the cache directory when the cache
    directory is not owned by the current use, commonly caused by using ``sudo``
    without the ``-H`` flag.
  * Update PEP 440 support to handle the latest changes to PEP 440, particularly
    the changes to ``>V`` and ``<V`` so that they no longer imply ``!=V.*``.
  * Document the default cache directories for each operating system.
  * Create the cache directory when the pip version check needs to save to it
    instead of silently logging an error.
  * Fix a regression where the ``-q`` flag would not properly suppress the
    display of the progress bars.
  * Fix an issue where the implicit version check new in pip 6.0 could cause pip
    to block for up to 75 seconds if PyPI was not accessible.
  * Make ``--no-index`` imply ``--disable-pip-version-check``.
  * Fix an issue where the output saying that a package was installed would
    report the old version instead of the new version during an upgrade.
  * Fix left over merge conflict markers in the documentation.
  * Document the backwards incompatible PEP 440 change in the 6.0.0 changelog.
  * Fix executable file permissions for Wheel files when using the distutils
    scripts option.
  * Fix a confusing error message when an exceptions was raised at certain
    points in pip's execution.
  * Fix the missing list of versions when a version cannot be found that matches
    the specifiers.
  * Add a warning about the possibly problematic use of > when the given
    specifier doesn't match anything.
  * Fix an issue where installing from a directory would not copy over certain
    directories which were being excluded, however some build systems rely on
    them.
  * **PROCESS** Version numbers are now simply ``X.Y`` where the leading ``1``
    has been dropped.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Dropped support for Python 3.1.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the bundle support which was deprecated in
    1.4. (:pull:`1806`)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** File lists generated by `pip show -f` are now
    rooted at the location reported by show, rather than one (unstated)
    directory lower. (:pull:`1933`)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** The ability to install files over the FTP protocol
    was accidently lost in pip 1.5 and it has now been decided to not restore
    that ability.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** PEP 440 is now fully implemented, this means that
    in some cases versions will sort differently or version specifiers will be
    interpreted differently than previously. The common cases should all function
    similarly to before.
  * **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --download-cache`` and
    ``pip wheel --download-cache`` command line flags have been deprecated and
    the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses
    it's internal HTTP cache which supplants the ``--download-cache`` the
    existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted
    until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see
    https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#caching
  * **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --build`` and ``pip install --no-clean`` are now
    *NOT* deprecated.  This reverses the deprecation that occurred in v1.5.3. See
    :issue:`906` for discussion.
  * **DEPRECATION** Implicitly accessing URLs which point to an origin which is
    not a secure origin, instead requiring an opt-in for each host using the new
    ``--trusted-host`` flag (``pip install --trusted-host example.com foo``).
  * Allow the new ``--trusted-host`` flag to also disable TLS verification for
    a particular hostname.
  * Added a ``--user`` flag to ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list`` to check the
    user site directory only.
  * Fixed :issue:`1873`. Silence byte compile errors when installation succeed.
  * Added a virtualenv-specific configuration file. (:pull:`1364`)
  * Added site-wide configuation files. (:pull:`1978`)
  * Added an automatic check to warn if there is an updated version of pip
    available (:pull:`2049`).
  * `wsgiref` and `argparse` (for >py26) are now excluded from `pip list` and `pip
    freeze` (:pull:`1606`, :pull:`1369`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1424`. Add ``--client-cert`` option for SSL client certificates.
  * Fixed :issue:`1484`. `pip show --files` was broken for wheel installs. (:pull:`35`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1641`. install_lib should take precedence when reading distutils nfig.
    (:pull:`1642`)
  * Send `Accept-Encoding: identity` when downloading files in an attempt to
    convince some servers who double compress the downloaded file to stop doing
    so. (:pull:`1688`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1559`. Stop breaking when given pip commands in uppercase (:pull:725`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1618`. Pip no longer adds duplicate logging consumers, so it
    won't create duplicate output when being called multiple times. (:pull:`1723`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1769`. `pip wheel` now returns an error code if any wheels
    fail to build.
  * Fixed :issue:`1775`. `pip wheel` wasn't building wheels for dependencies of
    editable requirements.
  * Allow the use of ``--no-use-wheel`` within a requirements file. (:pull:`1859`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1680`. Attempt to locate system TLS certificates to use instead
    of the included CA Bundle if possible. (:pull:`1866`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1319`. Allow use of Zip64 extension in Wheels and other zip
    files. (:pull:`1868`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1101`. Properly handle an index or --find-links target which
    has a <base> without a href attribute. (:pull:`1869`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1885`. Properly handle extras when a project is installed
    via Wheel. (:pull:`1896`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1180`. Added support to respect proxies in ``pip search``. It
    also fixes :issue:`932` and :issue:`1104`. (:pull:`1902`)
  * Fixed :issue:`798` and :issue:`1060`. `pip install --download` works with vcs lks.
    (:pull:`1926`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1456`. Disabled warning about insecure index host when using locaost.
    Based off of Guy Rozendorn's work in :pull:`1718`. (:pull:`1967`)
  * Allow the use of OS standard user configuration files instead of ones simply
    based around ``$HOME``. (:pull:`2021`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1825`. When installing directly from wheel paths or urls,
    previous versions were not uninstalled. This also fixes :issue:`804`
    specifically for the case of wheel archives. (:pull:`1838`)
  * Fixed :issue:`2075`, detect the location of the ``.egg-info`` directory by
    looking for any file located inside of it instead of relying on the record
    file listing a directory. (:pull:`2076`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1964`, :issue:`1935`, :issue:`676`, Use a randomized and secure
    default build directory when possible. (:pull:`2122`, CVE-2014-8991)
  * Fixed :issue:`1433`. Support environment markers in requirements.txt files.
    (pull:`2134`)

    similar to how browsers handle it. (:pull:`1874`)
  * Reduce the verbosity of the pip command by default. (:pull:`2175`,
    :pull:`2177`, :pull:`2178`)
  * Fixed :issue:`2031` - Respect sys.executable on OSX when installing from
    Wheels.
  * Display the entire URL of the file that is being downloaded when downloading
    from a non PyPI repository (:pull:`2183`).

    bootstrapping pip.
  * Update docs to point to https://pip.pypa.io/
  * Upgrade the bundled projects (distlib==0.1.8, html5lib==1.0b3, six==1.6.1,
    colorama==0.3.1, setuptools==3.4.4).
  * Correct deprecation warning for ``pip install --build`` to only notify when
    the `--build` value is different than the default.
  * **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --build`` and ``pip install --no-clean`` are now
    deprecated.  See :issue:`906` for discussion.
  * Fixed :issue:`1112`. Couldn't download directly from wheel paths/urls, and whenheel
    downloads did occur using requirement specifiers, dependencies weren't
    downloaded (:pull:`1527`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1320`. ``pip wheel`` was not downloading wheels that already exisd (PR
    :issue:`1524`)
  * Fixed :issue:`1111`. ``pip install --download`` was failing using local
    ``--find-links`` (:pull:`1524`)
  * Workaround for Python bug http://bugs.python.org/issue20053 (:pull:`1544`)
  * Don't pass a unicode __file__ to setup.py on Python 2.x (:pull:`1583`)

  * `get-pip.py` now installs setuptools, when it's not already installed
    (:pull:`1475`)

- Update to version 1.5:
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer supports the --use-mirrors,
    -M, and --mirrors flags. The mirroring support has been removed. In
    order to use a mirror specify it as the primary index with -i or
    --index-url, or as an additional index with --extra-index-url. (Pull #1098, CVE-2013-5123)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer will scrape insecure external urls by
    default nor will it install externally hosted files by default. Users may opt
    into installing externally hosted or insecure files or urls using
    --allow-external PROJECT and --allow-unverified PROJECT. (Pull #1055)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer respects dependency links by default.
    Users may opt into respecting them again using --process-dependency-links.
  * **DEPRECATION** pip install --no-install and pip install
    --no-download are now formally deprecated.  See Issue #906 for discussion on
    possible alternatives, or lack thereof, in future releases.
  * **DEPRECATION** pip zip and pip unzip are now formally deprecated.
  * pip will now install Mac OSX platform wheels from PyPI. (Pull #1278)
  * pip now generates the appropriate platform-specific console scripts when
    installing wheels. (Pull #1251)
  * Pip now confirms a wheel is supported when installing directly from a path or
    url. (Pull #1315)
  * Fixed #1097, --ignore-installed now behaves again as designed, after it was
    unintentionally broke in v0.8.3 when fixing Issue #14 (Pull #1352).
  * Fixed a bug where global scripts were being removed when uninstalling --user
    installed packages (Pull #1353).
  * Fixed #1163, --user wasn't being respected when installing scripts from wheels (Pull #1176).
  * Fixed #1150, we now assume '_' means '-' in versions from wheel filenames (Pull #1158).
  * Fixed #219, error when using --log with a failed install (Pull #1205).
  * Fixed #1131, logging was buffered and choppy in Python 3.
  * Fixed #70,  --timeout was being ignored (Pull #1202).
  * Fixed #772, error when setting PIP_EXISTS_ACTION (Pull #1201).
  * Added colors to the logging output in order to draw attention to important
    warnings and errors. (Pull #1109)
  * Added warnings when using an insecure index, find-link, or dependency link. (Pull #1121)
  * Added support for installing packages from a subdirectory using the subdirectory
    editable option. ( Pull #1082 )
  * Fixed #1192. "TypeError: bad operand type for unary" in some cases when
    installing wheels using --find-links (Pull #1218).
  * Fixed #1133 and #317. Archive contents are now written based on system
    defaults and umask (i.e. permissions are not preserved), except that regular
    files with any execute permissions have the equivalent of "chmod +x" applied
    after being written (Pull #1146).
  * PreviousBuildDirError now returns a non-zero exit code and prevents the
    previous build dir from being cleaned in all cases (Pull #1162).
  * Renamed --allow-insecure to --allow-unverified, however the old name will
    continue to work for a period of time (Pull #1257).
  * Fixed #1006, error when installing local projects with symlinks in
    Python 3. (Pull #1311)
  * The previously hidden --log-file otion, is now shown as a general option.
    (Pull #1316)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 14:49:27 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 1.4:
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip now only installs stable versions by default,
    and offers a new --pre option to also find pre-release and development
    versions. (Pull #834)
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Dropped support for Python 2.5. The minimum
    supported Python version for pip 1.4 is Python 2.6.
  * Added support for installing and building wheel archives.
    Thanks Daniel Holth, Marcus Smith, Paul Moore, and Michele Lacchia
    (Pull #845)
  * Applied security patch to pip's ssl support related to certificate DNS
    wildcard matching (http://bugs.python.org/issue17980).
  * To satisfy pip's setuptools requirement, pip now recommends setuptools>=0.8,
    not distribute. setuptools and distribute are now merged into one project
    called 'setuptools'. (Pull #1003)
  * pip will now warn when installing a file that is either hosted externally to
    the index or cannot be verified with a hash. In the future pip will default
    to not installing them and will require the flags --allow-external NAME, and
    --allow-insecure NAME respectively. (Pull #985)
  * If an already-downloaded or cached file has a bad hash, re-download it rather
    than erroring out. (Issue #963).
  * pip bundle and support for installing from pybundle files is now
    considered deprecated and will be removed in pip v1.5.
  * Fixed a number of issues (#413, #709, #634, #602, and #939) related to
    cleaning up and not reusing build directories. (Pull #865, #948)
  * Added a User Agent so that pip is identifiable in logs. (Pull #901)
  * Added ssl and --user support to get-pip.py. Thanks Gabriel de Perthuis.
    (Pull #895)
  * Fixed the proxy support, which was broken in pip 1.3.x (Pull #840)
  * Fixed issue #32 - pip fails when server does not send content-type header.
    Thanks Hugo Lopes Tavares and Kelsey Hightower (Pull #872).
  * "Vendorized" distlib as pip.vendor.distlib (https://distlib.readthedocs.org/).
  * Fixed git VCS backend with git 1.8.3. (Pull #967)
- Require setuptools instead of distribute again (merged upstream)
- Use update-alternatives for parallel-installability with Python3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  8 13:12:37 UTC 2013 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.3.1:
  * Fixed a major backward incompatible change of parsing URLs to
    externally hosted packages that got accidentily included in 1.3.

  * SSL Cert Verification; Make https the default for PyPI access.
    Thanks James Cleveland, Giovanni Bajo, Marcus Smith and many
    others (Pull #789).

    version available. Thanks Rafael Caricio, Miguel Araujo, Dmitry
    Gladkov (Pull #752)

    Thanks David (d1b) and Thomas Guttler. (Pull #780)
  * Improvements to sphinx docs and cli help. (Pull #773)

    causing global NumPy installs to fail. (Pull #768)
  * Split help output into general vs command-specific option groups.
    Thanks Georgi Valkov. (Pull #744; Pull #721 contains preceding
    refactor)
  * Fixed dependency resolution when installing from archives with
    uppercase project names. (Pull #724)
  * Fixed problem where re-installs always occurred when using
    file:// find-links. (Pulls #683/#702)
  * "pip install -v" now shows the full download url, not just the
    archive name. Thanks Marc Abramowitz (Pull #687)
  * Fix to prevent unnecessary PyPI redirects. Thanks Alex
    Gronholm (Pull #695)
  * Fixed issue #670 - install failure under Python 3 when the same
    version of a package is found under 2 different URLs. Thanks
    Paul Moore (Pull #671)
  * Fix git submodule recursive updates.  Thanks Roey Berman.
    (Pulls #674)
  * Explicitly ignore rel='download' links while looking for html
    pages. Thanks Maxime R. (Pull #677)
  * --user/--upgrade install options now work together. Thanks
    'eevee' for discovering the problem. (Pull #705)
  * Added check in install --download to prevent re-downloading
    if the target file already exists. Thanks Andrey Bulgakov.
    (Pull #669)
  * Added support for bare paths (including relative paths) as
    argument to --find-links. Thanks Paul Moore for draft patch.
  * Added support for --no-index in requirements files.
  * Added "pip show" command to get information about an installed
    package. Fixes #131. Thanks Kelsey Hightower and Rafael Caricio.
  * Added --root option for "pip install" to specify root
    directory. Behaves like the same option in distutils but also
    plays nice with pip's egg-info. Thanks Przemek Wrzos.
    (Issue #253 / Pull #693)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  8 22:31:31 UTC 2012 - os-dev@jacraig.com

    Refs issue #3.

    request to pip install gmpy; sdist filename must begin with full
    project name followed by a dash.

  * Fixed issue #58 - pip freeze now falls back to non-editable format rather
    than blowing up if it can't determine the origin repository of an editable.

  * Fixed issue #49 - pip install -U no longer reinstalls the same versions
    of packages.
  * Removed -E option and PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV; both use a restart-in-venv
    mechanism that's broken, and neither one is useful since every virtualenv
    now has pip inside it.
  * Fixed issue #366 - pip throws IndexError when it calls scraped_rel_links
  * Fixed issue #22 - pip search should set and return a userful shell
    status code
  * Fixed issue #351 and #365 - added global --exists-action command line
    option to easier script file exists conflicts, e.g. from editable
    requirements from VCS that have a changed repo URL.
