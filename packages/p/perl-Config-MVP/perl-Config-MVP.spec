%description
MVP is a mechanism for loading configuration (or other information) for
libraries. It doesn't read a file or a database. It's a helper for things
that do.

The idea is that you end up with a Config::MVP::Sequence object, and that
you can use that object to fully configure your library or application. The
sequence will contain a bunch of Config::MVP::Section objects, each of
which is meant to provide configuration for a part of your program. Most of
these sections will be directly related to a Perl library that you'll use
as a plugin or helper. Each section will have a name, and every name in the
sequence will be unique.

This is a pretty abstract set of behaviors, so we'll provide some more
concrete examples that should help explain how things work.
