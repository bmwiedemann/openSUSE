  <title>Mro::* interface compatibility for Perls &lt; 5.9.5</title>
  <description>The &quot;mro&quot; namespace provides several utilities for dealing with method
resolution order and method caching in general in Perl 5.9.5 and higher.
This module provides those interfaces for earlier versions of Perl (back to
5.6.0 anyways).

It is a harmless no-op to use this module on 5.9.5+. That is to say, code
which properly uses MRO::Compat will work unmodified on both older Perls and
5.9.5+.

If you're writing a piece of software that would like to use the parts of
5.9.5+'s mro:: interfaces that are supported here, and you want compatibility
with older Perls, this is the module for you.

Some parts of this code will work better and/or faster with Class::C3::XS
installed (which is an optional prereq of Class::C3, which is in turn a prereq
of this package), but it's not a requirement.

This module never exports any functions. All calls must be fully qualified
with the mro:: prefix.

The interface documentation here serves only as a quick reference of what the
function basically does, and what differences between MRO::Compat and 5.9.5+
One should look out for. The main docs in 5.9.5's mro are the real interface
docs, and contain a lot of other useful information.</description>
