  <title>a module to read Mozilla URL history files</title>
  <description>This is a module that can read the Mozilla URL history file -- normally
$HOME/.mozilla/default/*.slt/history.dat -- and extract the id, url, name,
hostname, first visted dat, last visited date and visit count.

To find your history file it might be worth using *Mozilla::Backup* which
has some platform-independent code for finding the profiles of various
Mozilla-isms (including Firefox, Camino, K-Meleon, etc.).</description>
