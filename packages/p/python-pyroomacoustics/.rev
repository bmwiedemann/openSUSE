    <comment>- Update to version 0.7.3
  * Fixes issue #293 due to the C++ method Room::next_wall_hit not handling 2D
    shoebox rooms, which cause a seg fault
- 0.7.2 - 2022-11-15
  * Appveyor builds for compiled wheels for win32/win64 x86
  * Fixes missing import statement in room.plot for 3D rooms (PR #286)
  * On win64, bss.fastmnmf would fail due to some singular matrix. 1) protect
    solve with try/except and switch to pseudo-inverse if necessary, 2) change
    eps 1e-7 -&gt; 1e-6
- 0.7.1 - 2022-11-11
  * Fixed pypi upload for windows wheels
- 0.7.0 - 2022-11-10
  * Added the AnechoicRoom class.
  * Added FastMNMF2 (Fast Multichannel Nonnegative Matrix Factorization 2) to
    bss subpackage.
  * Randomized image source method for removing sweeping echoes in shoebox
    rooms.
  * Adds the cart2spher method in pyroomacoustics.doa.utils to convert from
    cartesian to spherical coordinates.
  * Example room_complex_wall_materials.py
  * CI for python 3.10
  * Cleans up the plot_rir function in Room so that the labels are neater. It
    also adds an extra option kind that can take values &quot;ir&quot;, &quot;tf&quot;, or &quot;spec&quot;
    to plot the impulse responses, transfer functions, or spectrograms of the
    RIR.
  * Refactored the implementation of FastMNMF.
  * Modified the document of __init__.py in doa subpackage.
  * End of Python 3.6 support.
  * Removed the deprecated realtime sub-module.
  * Removed the deprecated functions pyroomacoustics.transform.analysis,
    pyroomacoustics.transform.synthesis,
    pyroomacoustics.transform.compute_synthesis_window. They are replaced by
    the equivalent functions in pyroomacoustics.transform.stft sub-module.
  * The minimum required version of numpy was changed to 1.13.0 (use of
    np.linalg.multi_dot in doa sub-package see #271)
  * Fixed most warnings in the tests
  * Fixed bug in examples/adaptive_filter_stft_domain.py
- 0.6.0 - 2021-11-29
  * New DOA method: MUSIC with pseudo-spectra normalization. Thanks @4bian!
    Normalizes MUSIC pseudo spectra before averaging across frequency axis.
  * Issue 235: fails when set_ray_tracing is called, but no mic_array is set
  * Issue 236: general ISM produces the wrong transmission coefficients
  * Removes an unncessery warning for some rooms when ray tracing is not needed
  * Unify code format by using Black
  * Add code linting in continuous integration
  * Drop CI support for python 3.5
- 0.5.0 - 2021-09-06
  * Adds tracking of reflection order with respect to x/y/z axis in the shoebox
    image source model engine. The orders are available in source.orders_xyz
    after running the image source model
  * Support for microphone and source directivites for image source model.
    Source directivities just for shoebox room. Available directivities are
    frequency-independent (cardioid patterns), although the infrastructure is
    there for frequency-dependent directivities: frequency-dependent usage in
    Room.compute_rir and abstract Directivity class.
  * Examples scripts and notebook for directivities.
  * Fix wrong bracketing for negative values in is_inside (ShoeBox)
- 0.4.3 - 2021-02-18
  * Support for Python 3.8 and 3.9
  * Fixes typo in a docstring
  * Update docs to better reflect actual function parameters
  * Fixes the computation of the cost function of SRP-PHAT doa algorithm (bug
    reported in #PR197)
  * Improve the computation of the auxiliary variables in AuxIVA and ILRMA.
    Unnecessary division operations are reduced.

    <comment>- update to 0.7.4:
  * New implementation of fast RIR builder function in the
    libroom C++ extension to replace the current cython code.
    Advantages are: 1) only one compiled extension, 2)
    multithreading support
  * New global parameter sinc_lut_granularity that controls the
    number of points used in the look-up table for the sinc
    interpolation. Accessible via parameters.constants.get.
  * New global parameter  num_threads that controls the number of
    threads used in multi-threaded code (rir builder only at the
    moment). The number of threads can also be controlled via the
    environement variable PRA_NUM_THREADS
  * Adds package build support for Python 3.11 and 3.12. - Adds
    package build for new Apple M1 architecture
  * Removed the broken get_rir method of the class SoundSource
  * Removes package build support for Python 3.7 (EOL)
  * Fixes a bug when using randomized image source model with a
    2D room (#315) by @hrosseel
  * Fixes a bug when setting the air absorption coefficients to
    custom values (#191), adds a test, and more details in the
    doc
  * Fixes a bug in the utilities.angle_function in the
    calculation of the colatitude (#329) by @fabiodimarco
  * Replaces the crossing-based point-in-polygon algorithm in the
    C++ code with the more robust winding number algorithm
  * Fixes usage of deprecated hann window with new version of
    scipy in metrics.py (#344) by @mattpitkin
  * Fixes issue #293 due to the C++ method Room::next_wall_hit
    not handling 2D shoebox rooms, which cause a seg fault
  * Appveyor builds for compiled wheels for win32/win64 x86</comment>
