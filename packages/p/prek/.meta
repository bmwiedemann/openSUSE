  <title>Better pre-commit, re-engineered in Rust </title>
  <description>*prek* is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust.
It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it,
while also providing some additional long-requested features.

## Features

- A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- [Faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and uses only half the disk space.
- Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- Built-in support for monorepos (i.e. [workspace mode](https://prek.j178.dev/workspace/)).
- Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- [Built-in](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/) Rust-native implementation of some common hooks.</description>
