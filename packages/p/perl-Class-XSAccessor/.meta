  <title>Generate fast XS accessors without runtime compilation</title>
  <description>Class::XSAccessor implements fast read, write and read/write accessors in
XS. Additionally, it can provide predicates such as &quot;has_foo()&quot; for
testing whether the attribute &quot;foo&quot; is defined in the object. It only
works with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
Class::XSAccessor::Array implements the same interface for objects that
use arrays for their internal representation.</description>
