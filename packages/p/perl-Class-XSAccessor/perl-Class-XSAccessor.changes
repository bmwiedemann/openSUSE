- updated to 1.19
  - Remove the OP tree munging optimization since it wasn't in the
    end really speeding things up. (chocolateboy)
  - Require Time::HiRes explicitly because CentOS cripples the base
    perl install.

- updated to 1.18
  - Revert fixes for implicitly-lvalue getters for now since that
    actually breaks user code. It seems it's not just because the
    users are naughty, so more investigation required.
  - For Hashes: Implement predicates that check definedness and
    existance explicitly. The traditional "predicates" check
    definedness. It's conceivable to also want a bool-check
    type predicate. File a ticket if you need that.
  - Fix bug regarding getters being implicitly lvalue by
    returning the internal SV*. Instead, we now use TARG.

- updated to 1.16
   - Drop erroneous MYMETA files from distribution.
 
   - Support for hash keys with NUL (\0) characters. Previously,
     these were truncated.
 
   - Skip some failing tests on old debugging perls. Guys, please
     upgrade your perl!

Mon Feb 27 08:47:13 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.13
  - Removes the cached read-only and read-write accessors
    for the time being. (These were only available from another
    development releasse.
  - Much more brutal thread-safety testing.
  - Fixed thread-safety problem with the global hashkey storage.
  - Lots of refactoring in the C code.
  - Instead of storing an index in the CV, we store a pointer to
    the hashkey struct.
  - Implements cached read-only and read-write accessors.
    Details on what that means are in the documentation.
