  <title>Log to files that archive/rotate themselves</title>
  <description>This module provides a simple object for logging to files under the
Log::Dispatch::* system, and automatically rotating them according to
different constraints. This is basically a Log::Dispatch::File wrapper
with additions. To that end the arguments

        name, min_level, filename and  mode

behave the same as Log::Dispatch::File. So see its man page (perldoc
Log::Dispatch::File)</description>
