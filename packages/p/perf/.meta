  <title>Performance Monitoring Tools for Linux</title>
  <description>This package provides a userspace tool 'perf', which monitors performance for
either unmodified binaries or the entire system. It requires a Linux kernel
which includes the Performance Counters for Linux (PCL) subsystem (&gt;= 2.6.31).
This subsystem utilizes the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) / hardware
counters of the underlying cpu architecture (if supported).</description>
