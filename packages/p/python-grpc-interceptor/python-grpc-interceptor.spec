%description
Simplified Python gRPC interceptors.

The Python `grpc` package provides service interceptors, but they're a bit hard to
use because of their flexibility. The `grpc` interceptors don't have direct access
to the request and response objects, or the service context. Access to these are often
desired, to be able to log data in the request or response, or set status codes on the
context.
