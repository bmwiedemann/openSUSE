  <title>Lookup the username on the remote end of a TCP/IP connection</title>
  <description>You can either use the simple interface, which does one ident lookup at a
time, or use the asynchronous interface to perform (possibly) many
simultaneous lookups, or simply continue serving other things while the
lookup is proceeding.</description>
