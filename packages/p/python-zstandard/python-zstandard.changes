- Update to 0.19.0
Bug fixes
  * The C backend implementation of
    ZstdDecompressionObj.decompress() could have raised an
    assertion in cases where the function was called multiple times
    on an instance. In non-debug builds, calls to this method could
    have leaked memory.
Changes
  * PyPy 3.6 support dropped; Pypy 3.8 and 3.9 support added.
  * Anaconda 3.6 support dropped.
  * Official support for Python 3.11. This did not require
    meaningful code changes and previous release(s) likely worked
    with 3.11 without any changes. CFFI's build system now respects
    distutils's compiler.preprocessor if it is set.
    gh#indygreg/python-zstandard#179
  * The internal logic of ZstdDecompressionObj.decompress() was
    refactored. This may have fixed unconfirmed issues where
    unused_data was set prematurely. The new logic will also avoid
    an extra call to ZSTD_decompressStream() in some scenarios,
    possibly improving performance.
  * ZstdDecompressor.decompress() how has a read_across_frames
    keyword argument. It defaults to False. True is not yet
    implemented and will raise an exception if used. The new
    argument will default to True in a future release and is
    provided now so callers can start passing
    read_across_frames=False to preserve the existing functionality
    during a future upgrade.
  * ZstdDecompressor.decompress() now has an allow_extra_data
    keyword argument to control whether an exception is raised if
    input contains extra data. It defaults to True, preserving
    existing behavior of ignoring extra data. It will likely
    default to False in a future release. Callers desiring the
    current behavior are encouraged to explicitly pass
    allow_extra_data=True so behavior won't change during a future
    upgrade.

Sun Jan 30 21:20:18 UTC 2022 - Sarah Kriesch <sarah.kriesch@opensuse.org>

- update to 0.17.0
 * Python 3.9 wheels are now provided.
 * Support for Python 3.5 has been dropped. 
 * Python 3.6 is now the minimum required Python version.
 * Bundled zstandard library upgraded from 1.4.5 to 1.5.1.
 * The bundled zstandard library is now using the single C source 
   file distribution. The 2 main header files are still present, 
   as these are needed by CFFI to generate the CFFI bindings.
 * PyBuffer instances are no longer checked to be C contiguous and 
   have a single dimension. The former was redundant with what 
   PyArg_ParseTuple() already did and the latter is not necessary 
   in practice because very few extension modules create buffers 
   with more than 1 dimension. (#124)
 * Added Python typing stub file for the zstandard module. (#120)
 * The make_cffi.py script should now respect the CC environment 
   variable for locating the compiler. (#103)
 * CI now properly uses the cffi backend when running all tests.
 * train_dictionary() has been rewritten to use the fastcover APIs 
   and to consistently call ZDICT_optimizeTrainFromBuffer_fastCover() 
   instead of different C APIs depending on what arguments were passed. 
   The function also now accepts arguments f, split_point, and accel, 
   which are parameters unique to fastcover.
 * CI now tests and builds wheels for Python 3.9.
 * zstd.c file renamed to c-ext/backend_c.c.
 * All built/installed Python modules are now in the zstandard package. 
   Previously, there were modules in other packages. (#115)
 * C source code is now automatically formatted with clang-format.
 * ZstdCompressor.stream_writer(), ZstdCompressor.stream_reader(), 
   ZstdDecompressor.stream_writer(), and ZstdDecompressor.stream_reader() 
   now accept a closed argument to control whether the underlying stream 
   should be closed when the ZstdCompressionWriter, ZstdCompressReader, 
   ZstdDecompressionWriter, or ZstdDecompressionReader is closed. (#76)
 * There is now a zstandard.open() function for returning a file object 
   with zstd (de)compression. (#64)
 * The zstandard module now exposes a backend_features attribute 
   containing a set of strings denoting optional features present in that 
   backend. This can be used to sniff feature support by performing a 
   string lookup instead of sniffing for API presence or behavior.
 * Python docstrings have been moved from the C backend to the CFFI backend. 
   Sphinx docs have been updated to generate API documentation via the CFFI 
   backend. Documentation for Python APIs is now fully defined via Python 
   docstrings instead of spread across Sphinx ReST files and source code.
 * ZstdCompressionParameters now exposes a strategy property.
 * There are now compress() and decompress() convenience functions on the 
   zstandard module. These are simply wrappers around the corresponding APIs 
   on ZstdCompressor and ZstdDecompressor.
 * The deprecated CompressionParameters type alias to ZstdCompressionParamaters 
   has been removed. Use ZstdCompressionParameters.
 * setup.py now recognizes a ZSTD_EXTRA_COMPILER_ARGS environment variable to 
   specify additional compiler arguments to use when compiling the C backend.
 * PyPy build and test coverage has been added to CI.
 * Added CI jobs for building against external zstd library.
 * Wheels supporting macOS ARM/M1 devices are now being produced.
 * References to Python 2 have been removed from the in-repo Debian packaging code.
 * Significant work has been made on a Rust backend. It is currently feature 
   complete but not yet optimized. We are not yet shipping the backend as part 
   of the distributed wheels until it is more mature.
 * ZstdCompressor.multi_compress_to_buffer() and ZstdDecompressor.multi_decompress_to_buffer() 
   are no longer available when linking against a system zstd library. 
   These experimental features are only available when building against the 
   bundled single file zstd C source file distribution. (#106)
 * The .pyi type annotations file has replaced various default argument 
   values with ....
 * manylinux2014_aarch64 wheels are now being produced for CPython 3.6+. (#145).
 * Wheels are now being produced for CPython 3.10.
 * Arguments to ZstdCompressor() and ZstdDecompressor() are now all optional in 
   the C backend and an explicit None value is accepted. Before, the C backend 
   wouldn’t accept an explicit None value (but the CFFI backend would). 
   The new behavior should be consistent between the backends. (#153)
 * The C backend now exposes the symbols ZstdCompressionReader, ZstdCompressionWriter, 
   ZstdDecompressionReader, and ZstdDecompressionWriter. This should match the behavior 
   of the CFFI backend. (#165)
 * ZstdCompressionWriter and ZstdDecompressionWriter now 
   implement __iter__ and __next__, which always raise io.UnsupportedOperation.
 * Documentation on thread safety has been updated to note that derived objects like 
   ZstdCompressionWriter have the same thread unsafety as the contexts they were 
   derived from. (#166)
 * The HASHLOG3_MAX constant has been removed since it is no longer defined in zstd 1.5.1.

Tue Jul 21 08:39:31 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 0.14.0
  * This will likely be the final version supporting Python 2.7. Future
    releases will likely only work on Python 3.5+. See #109 for more
    context.
  * There is a significant possibility that future versions will use
    Rust - instead of C - for compiled code. See #110 for more context.
  * Some internal fields of C structs are now explicitly initialized.
    (Possible fix for #105.)
  * The ``make_cffi.py`` script used to build the CFFI bindings now
    calls ``distutils.sysconfig.customize_compiler()`` so compiler
    customizations (such as honoring the ``CC`` environment variable)
    are performed. Patch by @Arfrever. (#103)
  * The ``make_cffi.py`` script now sets ``LC_ALL=C`` when invoking
    the preprocessor in an attempt to normalize output to ASCII. (#95)

    instead of a mix of ``manylinux2010`` and ``manylinux1``.

  * Bundled zstandard library upgraded from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4.
  * Python code has been reformatted with black.
