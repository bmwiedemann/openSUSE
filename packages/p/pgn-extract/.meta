  <title>A CLI program for manipulating PGN files</title>
  <description>This is a command-line program for manipulating chess games recorded 
in the Portable Game Notation (PGN).
Extracted games may be written out either including or excluding 
comments, NAGs, variations, move numbers, tags and/or results. 
Games may be given ECO classifications derived from the accompanying 
file eco.pgn, or a customised version provided by the user.
