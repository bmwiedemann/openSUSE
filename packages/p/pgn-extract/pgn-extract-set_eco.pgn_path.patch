 others, to whom appropriate thanks is due.  The -e flag requests
 pgn-extract to add/replace ECO classifications in the games it outputs.
 This is done by firstly reading a file of ECO lines in PGN format
-(eco.pgn in the current directory, by default) and building a table of
+(/usr/share/pgn-extract/eco.pgn, by default) and building a table of
 resulting positions. As the games are then read they are looked up in
 the table to find a classification. The deepest match is found.
 A match is allowed within six half moves of the length of the ECO line.
