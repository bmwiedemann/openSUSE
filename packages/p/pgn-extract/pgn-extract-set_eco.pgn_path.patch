 pgn-extract to add/replace ECO classifications in the games it outputs.
 This is done by firstly reading a file of ECO lines in PGN format

 resulting positions. As the games are then read they are looked up in
 the table to find a classification. The deepest match is found.
 A match is allowed within six half moves of the length of the ECO line.
