%description
This is a command-line program for manipulating chess games recorded
in the Portable Game Notation (PGN).
Extracted games may be written out either including or excluding
comments, NAGs, variations, move numbers, tags and/or results.
Games may be given ECO classifications derived from the accompanying
file %{_datadir}/%{name}/eco.pgn, or a customised version provided
by the user.

For a full description of pgn-extract's functionality see
%{_docdir}/%{name}/help.html.
