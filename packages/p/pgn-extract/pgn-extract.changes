Sun Mar 29 16:15:33 UTC 2020 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Update to 19.04:
  * Improved --repetition so that it does not give false
    positives when castling rights or who is to move are
    different.
  * Retain next move number rather than resetting to 1
    with --dropply and --dropbefore.
  * Fixed a memory error in v18-10
  * Added --xroster to suppress tags that are not required with -R.
  * Missing SetUp tags no longer elicit an error message as this

    to be retained at the end of the game.
