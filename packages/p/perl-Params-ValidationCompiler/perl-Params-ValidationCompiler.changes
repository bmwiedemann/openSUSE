  - Require Class::XSAccessor 1.17+ when trying to load it. Earlier versions
    cause test failures. Reported by David Cantrell. GH #27.

  - Tweaked the POD formatting so that the table of contents generated by
    MetaCPAN is more useful.
  
  
  0.29     2018-07-31
  
  - Make Class::XSAccessor a recommended dep, not a required one.
  
  
  0.28     2018-07-31
  
  - Added a new option for named params, "return_object". This causes the
    validation sub to return an object with methods for each param rather than a
    hashref. This is a great way to avoid typos in hash keys. This idea (and
    some of the implementation) was shamelessly stolen from Toby Inkster's
    Type::Params module.

  - Fixed a bug with inlining Moose types. If a type's parent needed environment
    variables those would not get closed over. Reported by Mark Fowler. GH #22.
  
  - Added a debug option to dump the source of the subroutine before it is
    eval'd.

  - The exceptions.t test would fail if Sub::Util was not installed. Reported by
    Paul Howarth. GH #19.
  
  - Fix test failures on Windows. GH #20.

  - All exceptions now include a stack trace by default when treated as a
    string. This makes finding where validation failed a lot easier. Fixes GH
    #18.
  
  - The name for a subroutine is now used in some exception messages, even if
    Sub::Util cannot be installed.

  - The source_for() exported by Params::ValidationCompiler did not work at
    all. Reported by Diab Jerius. GH #16.
  
  
  0.23     2017-01-23
  
  - Trying to create a validator for positional parameters where a required
    param came after one with a default did not throw an exception.
  
  - A positional params validator with a slurpy type which had coercions did not
    return the coerced values. It returned the original values instead.
