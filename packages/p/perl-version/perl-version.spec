%description
Version objects were added to Perl in 5.10. This module implements version
objects for older version of Perl and provides the version object API for
all versions of Perl. All previous releases before 0.74 are deprecated and
should not be used due to incompatible API changes. Version 0.77 introduces
the new 'parse' and 'declare' methods to standardize usage. You are
strongly urged to set 0.77 as a minimum in your code, e.g.

  use version 0.77; # even for Perl v.5.10.0
