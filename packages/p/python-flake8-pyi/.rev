    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Remove LICENSE source, it's now in the release
- Remove python_module macro definition
- Update to 22.10.0:
  # Bugfixes:
  - Do not emit Y020 for empty strings. Y020 concerns &quot;quoted annotations&quot;,
  - but an empty string can never be a quoted annotation.
  - Add special-casing so that Y020 is not emitted for __slots__ definitions
  - inside class blocks.
  - Expand Y035 to cover __slots__ definitions as well as __match_args__ and
  - __all__ definitions.
  - Expand Y015 so that errors are emitted for assignments to negative numbers.
  # Other changes:
  - Since v22.8.1, flake8-pyi has emitted a FutureWarning if run with flake8&lt;5,
    warning that the plugin would soon become incompatible with flake8&lt;5. Due
    to some issues that mean that some users are unable to upgrade to
    flake8&gt;=5, however, flake8-pyi no longer intends to remove support for
    running the plugin with flake8&lt;5 before Python 3.7 has reached end-of-life.
    As such, the FutureWarning is no longer emitted.
- 22.8.2:
  # New error codes:
  - Y047: Detect unused TypeAlias declarations.
  - Y049: Detect unused TypedDict definitions.
  - Y050: Prefer typing_extensions.Never for argument annotations over
    typing.NoReturn.
  - Y051: Detect redundant unions between Literal types and builtin supertypes
    (e.g. Literal[&quot;foo&quot;] | str, or Literal[5] | int).
  # Other enhancements:
  - Support mypy_extensions.TypedDict.
- 22.8.1:
  - Add support for flake8 &gt;= 5.0.0.
- 22.8.0:
  # New error codes:
  - Y046: Detect unused Protocols.
  - Y048: Function bodies should contain exactly one statement.
  # Bugfixes:
  - Improve error message for the case where a function body contains a
    docstring and a ... or pass statement.
  # Other changes:
  - Pin required flake8 version to &lt;5.0.0 (flake8-pyi is not currently
    compatible with flake8 5.0.0).
- 22.7.0
  # New error codes:
  - Introduce Y041: Ban redundant numeric unions (int | float, int | complex,
    float | complex).
  - Introduce Y042: Type alias names should use CamelCase rather than
    snake_case
  - Introduce Y043: Ban type aliases from having names ending with an uppercase
    &quot;T&quot;.
  - Introduce Y044: Discourage unnecessary from __future__ import annotations
    import. Contributed by Torsten Wörtwein.
  - Introduce Y045: Ban returning (Async)Iterable from __(a)iter__ methods.
  # Other enhancements and behaviour changes:
  - Improve error message for Y026 check.
  - Expand Y026 check. Since version 22.4.0, this has only emitted an error for
    assignments to typing.Literal, typing.Union, and PEP 604 unions. It now
    also emits an error for any subscription on the right-hand side of a simple
    assignment, as well as for assignments to typing.Any and None.
  - Support typing_extensions.overload and typing_extensions.NamedTuple.
  - Slightly expand Y034 to cover the case where a class inheriting from
    (Async)Iterator returns (Async)Iterable from __(a)iter__. These classes
    should nearly always return Self from these methods.
  - Support Python 3.11.
- 22.5.1:
  # Behaviour changes:
  - Relax Y020 check slightly, enabling the idiom __all__ += [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;] to
    be used in a stub file.
- 22.5.0:
  # Features:
  - Introduce Y039: Use str instead of typing.Text for Python 3 stubs.
  - Teach the Y036 check that builtins.object (as well as the unqualified
    object) is acceptable as an annotation for an __(a)exit__ method argument.
  - Teach the Y029 check to emit errors for __repr__ and __str__ methods that
    return builtins.str (as opposed to the unqualified str).
  - Introduce Y040: Never explicitly inherit from object in Python 3 stubs.
- 22.4.1:
  # Features:
  - Expand Y027 check to prohibit importing any objects from the typing module
    that are aliases for objects living collections.abc (except for
    typing.AbstractSet, which is special-cased).
  - Introduce Y038: Use from collections.abc import Set as AbstractSet instead
    of from typing import AbstractSet.
  # Bugfixes:
  - Improve inaccurate error messages for Y036.
- 22.4.0:
  # Features:
  - Introduce Y036 (check for badly defined __exit__ and __aexit__ methods).
  - Introduce Y037 (Use PEP 604 syntax instead of typing.Union and
    typing.Optional). Contributed by Oleg Höfling.
  # Behaviour changes:
  - Expand Y035 to cover __match_args__ inside class definitions, as well as
    __all__ in the global scope.
  # Bugfixes:
  - Improve Y026 check (regarding typing.TypeAlias) to reduce false-positive
    errors emitted when the plugin encountered variable aliases in a stub file.
- 22.3.0:
  # Bugfixes:
  - fix bug where incorrect quoted annotations were not detected within if
    blocks
  # Behaviour changes:
  - Add special-casing so that string literals are allowed in the context of
    __match_args__ assignments inside a class definition.
  - Add special-casing so that arbitrary values can be assigned to a variable
    in a stub file if the variable is annotated with Final.
- 22.2.0:
  # Bugfixes:
  - fix bugs in several error codes so that e.g. _T = typing.TypeVar(&quot;_T&quot;) is
    recognised as a TypeVar definition (previously only _T = TypeVar(&quot;_T&quot;) was
    recognised).
  - fix bug where foo = False at the module level did not trigger a Y015 error.
  - fix bug where TypeVars were erroneously flagged as unused if they were only
    used in a typing.Union subscript.
  - improve unclear error messages for Y022, Y023 and Y027 error codes.
  # Features:
  - introduce Y032 (prefer object to Any for the second argument in __eq__ and
    __ne__ methods).
  - introduce Y033 (always use annotations in stubs, rather than type
    comments).
  - introduce Y034 (detect common errors where return types are hardcoded, but
    they should use TypeVars instead).
  - introduce Y035 (__all__ in a stub has the same semantics as at runtime).
- 22.1.0:
  - extend Y001 to cover ParamSpec and TypeVarTuple in addition to TypeVar
  - detect usage of non-integer indices in sys.version_info checks
  - extend Y010 to check async functions in addition to normal functions
  - extend Y010 to cover what was previously included in Y090 (disallow
    assignments in __init__ methods) and Y091 (disallow raise statements). The
    previous checks were disabled by default.
  - introduce Y016 (duplicate union member)
  - introduce Y017 (disallows assignments with multiple targets or non-name
    targets)
  - introduce Y018 (detect unused TypeVars)
  - introduce Y019 (detect TypeVars that should be _typeshed.Self, but aren't)
  - introduce Y020 (never use quoted annotations in stubs)
  - introduce Y021 (docstrings should not be included in stubs)
  - introduce Y022 (prefer stdlib classes over typing aliases)
  - introduce Y023 (prefer typing over typing_extensions)
  - introduce Y024 (prefer typing.NamedTuple to collections.namedtuple)
  - introduce Y026 (require using TypeAlias for type aliases)
  - introduce Y025 (always alias collections.abc.Set)
  - introduce Y027 (Python 2-incompatible extension of Y022)
  - introduce Y028 (Use class-based syntax for NamedTuples)
  - introduce Y029 (never define __repr__ or __str__)
  - introduce Y030 (use Literal['foo', 'bar'] instead of Literal['foo'] |
    Literal['bar'])
  - introduce Y031 (use class-based syntax for TypedDicts where possible)
  - all errors are now enabled by default
  - remove Y092 (top-level attribute must not have a default value)
  - attrs is no longer a dependency
  - ast_decompiler has been added as a dependency on Python 3.8 and 3.7
  - support Python 3.10
  - discontinue support for Python 3.6

    <comment>Forwarded request #1040478 from yarunachalam

- Update to version 22.11.0: 
    * Bugfixes:
      Specify encoding when opening files. Prevents UnicodeDecodeError on Windows when the file contains non-CP1252 characters. Contributed by Avasam.
      Significant changes have been made to the Y041 check. Previously, Y041 flagged &quot;redundant numeric unions&quot;
      (e.g. float | int, complex | float or complex | int) in all contexts outside of type aliases. This was incorrect.
      PEP 484 only specifies that type checkers should treat int as an implicit subtype of float in the specific context of parameter annotations
      for functions and methods. Y041 has therefore been revised to only emit errors on &quot;redundant numeric unions&quot; in the context of parameter annotations.
    * Other changes:
      Support running with flake8 v6.</comment>

    <version>23.1.2</version>
    <time>1678125419</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Add set-tests-python-path.patch to fix tests inside osc build
  environment, running the flake8 process with shell=True and forcing
  the PYTHONPATH.
- Update to 23.1.2:
  * Y011/Y014/Y015: Increase the maximum character length of literal
    numbers in default values from 7 to 10, allowing hexadecimal
    representation of 32-bit integers. Contributed by Avasam.
- 23.1.1
New error codes:
  * Y052: Disallow default values in global or class namespaces where
    the assignment does not have a type annotation. Stubs should be
    explicit about the type of all variables in the stub; without type
    annotations, the type checker is forced to make inferences, which
    may have unpredictable consequences. Enum members are excluded
    from this check, as are various special assignments such as
    __all__ and __match_args__.
Other changes:
  * Disallow numeric default values where len(str(default)) &gt; 7. If a
    function has a default value where the string representation is
    greater than 7 characters, it is likely to be an implementation
    detail or a constant that varies depending on the system you're
    running on, such as sys.maxsize.
  * Disallow str or bytes defaults where the default is &gt;50 characters
    long, for similar reasons.
  * Allow ast.Attribute nodes as default values for a small number of
    special cases, such as sys.maxsize and sys.executable.
  * Fewer Y020 false positives are now emitted when encountering
    default values in stub files.
- 23.1.0
Bugfixes:
  * Do not emit Y020 (quoted annotations) for strings in parameter defaults.
  * Fix checking of defaults for functions with positional-only parameters.
Other changes:
  * Modify Y036 so that _typeshed.Unused is allowed as an annotation
    for parameters in __(a)exit__ methods. Contributed by Avasam
  * Several changes have been made to error codes relating to imports:
    - The Y027 error code has been removed.
    - All errors that used to result in Y027 being emitted now result
      in Y022 being emitted instead.
    - Some errors that used to result in Y023 being emitted now result
      in Y022 being emitted instead.
    - typing.Match and typing.Pattern have been added to the list of
      imports banned by Y022. Use re.Match and re.Pattern instead.
  * flake8-pyi no longer supports stub files that aim to support
    Python 2. If your stubs need to support Python 2, pin flake8-pyi
    to 22.11.0 or lower.
  * Y011, Y014 and Y015 have all been significantly relaxed. None,
    bools, ints, floats, complex numbers, strings and bytes are all
    now allowed as default values for parameter annotations or
    assignments.
  * Hatchling is now used as the build backend. This should have
    minimal, if any, user-facing impact.

    <comment>- update to 23.11.0:
  * Y058: Use `Iterator` rather than `Generator` as the return
    value for simple `__iter__` methods, and `AsyncIterator` rather
    than `AsyncGenerator` as the return value for simple `__aiter__`
    methods.
  * Y059: `Generic[]` should always be the last base class, if it
    is present in the bases of a class.
  * Y060, which flags redundant inheritance from `Generic[]`.
  * Y061: Do not use `None` inside a `Literal[]` slice.
  * For example, use `Literal[&quot;foo&quot;] | None` instead of
    `Literal[&quot;foo&quot;, None]`.
  * Y022 and Y037 now flag more imports from `typing_extensions`.
  * Y034 now attempts to avoid flagging methods inside classes
    that inherit from `builtins.type`, `abc.ABCMeta` and/or
    `enum.EnumMeta`.  Classes that have one or more of these as
    bases are metaclasses, and PEP 673 forbids the use of
    `typing(_extensions).Self` for metaclasses.
  * Attempting to import `typing_extensions.Text` now causes Y039
    to be emitted rather than Y023.
  * Y053 will no longer be emitted for the argument to
    `@typing_extensions.deprecated`.
  * Introduce Y090, which warns if you have an annotation such as
    `tuple[int]` or `Tuple[int]`. These mean &quot;a tuple of length 1,
    in which the sole element is of type `int`&quot;. This is sometimes
    what you want, but more usually you'll want `tuple[int, ...]`,
    which means &quot;a tuple of arbitrary (possibly 0) length, in
    which all elements are of type `int`&quot;.
  * Y011 now ignores `sentinel` and `_typeshed.sentinel` in
    default values.</comment>

  * Y061 is no longer emitted in situations where Y062 would also
    be emitted.
  * Improve error message for Y060.
  * Y023 now bans more imports from `typing_extensions` now that
    typeshed has dropped support for Python 3.7.
  * Y016: Fix false positive if a method had positional-only
    parameters (using PEP 570 syntax and the first
    positional-or-keyword parameter following the positional-only
    parameters used a custom TypeVar (see #455).
  * Y046: Fix false negative where an unused protocol would not
    be detected if the protocol was generic.</comment>
