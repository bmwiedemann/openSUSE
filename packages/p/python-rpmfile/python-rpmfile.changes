  * Unpack integer header data values as unsigned
  * Fixing incorrect parsing of first headers block (a.k.a.
    "signature headers")
  * added new tags
- update to 2.0.0:
  * Store only one version of i18n strings
  * Fix rpmfile fails to load localized RPM headers
- update to 1.1.0:
  * bz2 support, thank you @OneMoreByte!
- update to 1.0.8:
  * If a CPIO archive contained an entry for a directory we
    attempted to identify it via nlinks. Since it should have at
    least two nlinks if it's a directory.
    However, We stumbled across a case where this is not true. By
    using the mode bits we should be able to correctly identify
    directories without relying on nlinks.
    We're now using mode bits.
- update to 1.0.7:
  * Use setup.cfg and setuptools_scm for version
- update to 1.0.6:
  * For the command line interface, only print file paths when
    extracting if `-v/--verbose` is given
- update to 1.0.5:
  * Extract rpm files from the command line
