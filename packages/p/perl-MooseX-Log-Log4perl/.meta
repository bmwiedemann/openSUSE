  <title>A Logging Role for Moose based on Log::Log4perl</title>
  <description>A logging role building a very lightweight wrapper to the Log::Log4perl
manpage for use with your the Moose manpage classes. The initialization of
the Log4perl instance must be performed prior to logging the first log
message. Otherwise the default initialization will happen, probably not
doing the things you expect.

For compatibility the 'logger' attribute can be accessed to use a common
interface for application logging.

For simple logging needs use the MooseX::Log::Log4perl::Easy manpage to
directly add log_&lt;level&gt; methods to your class instance.
