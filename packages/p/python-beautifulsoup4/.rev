    <comment>- Update upstream URL

- update to 4.2.1:
 * The default XML formatter will now replace ampersands even if they
   appear to be part of entities. That is, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; will become
   &quot;&amp;amp;lt;&quot;. The old code was left over from Beautiful Soup 3, which
   didn't always turn entities into Unicode characters.
 
   If you really want the old behavior (maybe because you add new
   strings to the tree, those strings include entities, and you want
   the formatter to leave them alone on output), it can be found in
   EntitySubstitution.substitute_xml_containing_entities(). [bug=1182183]
 
 * Gave new_string() the ability to create subclasses of
   NavigableString. [bug=1181986]
 
 * Fixed another bug by which the html5lib tree builder could create a
   disconnected tree. [bug=1182089]
 
 * The .previous_element of a BeautifulSoup object is now always None,
   not the last element to be parsed. [bug=1182089]
 
 * Fixed test failures when lxml is not installed. [bug=1181589]
 
 * html5lib now supports Python 3. Fixed some Python 2-specific
   code in the html5lib test suite. [bug=1181624]
 
 * The html.parser treebuilder can now handle numeric attributes in
   text when the hexidecimal name of the attribute starts with a
   capital X. Patch by Tim Shirley. [bug=1186242]</comment>

    <comment>- Do not generate doc for py2 and py3 variant they are the same
  so keep just one around
- Update to 4.7.1:
  * Fixed a significant performance problem introduced in 4.7.0. [bug=1810617]
  * Fixed an incorrectly raised exception when inserting a tag before or
    after an identical tag. [bug=1810692]
  * Beautiful Soup will no longer try to keep track of namespaces that
    are not defined with a prefix; this can confuse soupselect. [bug=1810680]
  * Tried even harder to avoid the deprecation warning originally fixed in
     4.6.1. [bug=1778909]
  * Beautiful Soup's CSS Selector implementation has been replaced by a
    dependency on Isaac Muse's SoupSieve project (the soupsieve package
    on PyPI). The good news is that SoupSieve has a much more robust and
    complete implementation of CSS selectors, resolving a large number
    of longstanding issues. The bad news is that from this point onward,
    SoupSieve must be installed if you want to use the select() method.
  * Added the PageElement.extend() method, which works like list.append().
     [bug=1514970]
  * PageElement.insert_before() and insert_after() now take a variable
     number of arguments. [bug=1514970]
  * Fix a number of problems with the tree builder that caused
    trees that were superficially okay, but which fell apart when bits
    were extracted. Patch by Isaac Muse. [bug=1782928,1809910]
  * Fixed a problem with the tree builder in which elements that
    contained no content (such as empty comments and all-whitespace
    elements) were not being treated as part of the tree. Patch by Isaac
    Muse. [bug=1798699]
  * Fixed a problem with multi-valued attributes where the value
    contained whitespace. Thanks to Jens Svalgaard for the
    fix. [bug=1787453]</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 4.8.1:
  * When the html.parser or html5lib parsers are in use, Beautiful Soup
    will, by default, record the position in the original document where
    each tag was encountered.
  * Fixed the definition of the default XML namespace when using
    lxml 4.4.
  * Avoid a crash when unpickling certain parse trees generated
    using html5lib on Python 3.
  * Avoid a crash when trying to detect the declared encoding of a
    Unicode document.
- Drop patch beautifulsoup4-lxml-fixes.patch as it seems not needed
- Replace %fdupes -s with plain %fdupes; hardlinks are better.

    <comment>- update to 4.9.1:
  * Added a keyword argument 'on_duplicate_attribute' to the
    BeautifulSoupHTMLParser constructor (used by the html.parser tree
    builder) which lets you customize the handling of markup that
    contains the same attribute more than once, as in:
    &lt;a href=&quot;url1&quot; href=&quot;url2&quot;&gt; [bug=1878209]
  * Added a distinct subclass, GuessedAtParserWarning, for the warning
    issued when BeautifulSoup is instantiated without a parser being
    specified. [bug=1873787]
  * Added a distinct subclass, MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning, for the
    warning issued when BeautifulSoup is instantiated with 'markup' that
    actually seems to be a URL or the path to a file on
    disk. [bug=1873787]
  * The new NavigableString subclasses (Stylesheet, Script, and
    TemplateString) can now be imported directly from the bs4 package.
  * If you encode a document with a Python-specific encoding like
    'unicode_escape', that encoding is no longer mentioned in the final
    XML or HTML document. Instead, encoding information is omitted or
    left blank. [bug=1874955]
  * Fixed test failures when run against soupselect 2.0. Patch by Tomáš
    Chvátal. [bug=1872279]

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 4.10.0:
  * This is the first release of Beautiful Soup to only support Python 3.
  * The behavior of methods like .get_text() and .strings now differs
    depending on the type of tag.
  * NavigableString and its subclasses now implement the get_text()
    method, as well as the properties .strings and
    .stripped_strings.
  * The 'html5' formatter now treats attributes whose values are the
    empty string as HTML boolean attributes.
  * The 'replace_with()' method now takes a variable number of arguments,
    and can be used to replace a single element with a sequence of elements.
  * Corrected output when the namespace prefix associated with a
    namespaced attribute is the empty string, as opposed to
    None.
  * Performance improvement when processing tags that speeds up overall
    tree construction by 2%. Patch by Morotti. [bug=1899358]
  * Corrected the use of special string container classes in cases when a
    single tag may contain strings with different containers; such as
    the &lt;template&gt; tag, which may contain both TemplateString objects
    and Comment objects.
  * The html.parser tree builder can now handle named entities
    found in the HTML5 spec in much the same way that the html5lib
    tree builder does.
  * Added a second way to pass specify encodings to UnicodeDammit and
    EncodingDetector, based on the order of precedence defined in the
    HTML5 spec.
  * Improve the warning issued when a directory name (as opposed to
    the name of a regular file) is passed as markup into the BeautifulSoup
    constructor.

    <comment>- Update to 4.12.2:
  * Fixed an unhandled exception in BeautifulSoup.decode_contents
    and methods that call it. [bug=2015545]
- 4.12.1:
  * This version of Beautiful Soup replaces setup.py and setup.cfg
    with pyproject.toml. Beautiful Soup now uses tox as its test backend
    and hatch to do builds.
  * The main functional improvement in this version is a nonrecursive technique
    for regenerating a tree. This technique is used to avoid situations where,
    in previous versions, doing something to a very deeply nested tree
    would overflow the Python interpreter stack:
    1. Outputting a tree as a string, e.g. with
       BeautifulSoup.encode() [bug=1471755]
    2. Making copies of trees (copy.copy() and
       copy.deepcopy() from the Python standard library). [bug=1709837]
    3. Pickling a BeautifulSoup object. (Note that pickling a Tag
       object can still cause an overflow.)
  * Making a copy of a BeautifulSoup object no longer parses the
    document again, which should improve performance significantly.
  * When a BeautifulSoup object is unpickled, Beautiful Soup now
    tries to associate an appropriate TreeBuilder object with it.
  * Tag.prettify() will now consistently end prettified markup with
    a newline.
  * Added unit tests for fuzz test cases created by third
    parties. Some of these tests are skipped since they point
    to problems outside of Beautiful Soup, but this change
    puts them all in one convenient place.
  * PageElement now implements the known_xml attribute. (This was technically
    a bug, but it shouldn't be an issue in normal use.) [bug=2007895]
  * The demonstrate_parser_differences.py script was still written in
    Python 2. I've converted it to Python 3, but since no one has
    mentioned this over the years, it's a sign that no one uses this
    script and it's not serving its purpose.
- 4.12.0:
  * Introduced the .css property, which centralizes all access to
    the Soup Sieve API. This allows Beautiful Soup to give direct
    access to as much of Soup Sieve that makes sense, without cluttering
    the BeautifulSoup and Tag classes with a lot of new methods.
    This does mean one addition to the BeautifulSoup and Tag classes
    (the .css property itself), so this might be a breaking change if you
    happen to use Beautiful Soup to parse XML that includes a tag called
    &lt;css&gt;. In particular, code like this will stop working in 4.12.0:
      soup.css['id']
    Code like this will work just as before:
      soup.find_one('css')['id']
    The Soup Sieve methods supported through the .css property are
    select(), select_one(), iselect(), closest(), match(), filter(),
    escape(), and compile(). The BeautifulSoup and Tag classes still
    support the select() and select_one() methods; they have not been
    deprecated, but they have been demoted to convenience methods.
    [bug=2003677]
  * When the html.parser parser decides it can't parse a document, Beautiful
    Soup now consistently propagates this fact by raising a
    ParserRejectedMarkup error. [bug=2007343]
  * Removed some error checking code from diagnose(), which is redundant with
    similar (but more Pythonic) code in the BeautifulSoup constructor.
    [bug=2007344]
  * Added intersphinx references to the documentation so that other
    projects have a target to point to when they reference Beautiful
    Soup classes. [bug=1453370]
- 4.11.2:
  * Fixed test failures caused by nondeterministic behavior of
    UnicodeDammit's character detection, depending on the platform setup.
    [bug=1973072]
  * Fixed another crash when overriding multi_valued_attributes and using the
    html5lib parser. [bug=1948488]
  * The HTMLFormatter and XMLFormatter constructors no longer return a
    value. [bug=1992693]
  * Tag.interesting_string_types is now propagated when a tag is
    copied. [bug=1990400]
  * Warnings now do their best to provide an appropriate stacklevel,
    improving the usefulness of the message. [bug=1978744]
  * Passing a Tag's .contents into PageElement.extend() now works the
    same way as passing the Tag itself.
  * Soup Sieve tests will be skipped if the library is not installed.
- 4.11.1:
  This release was done to ensure that the unit tests are packaged along
  with the released source. There are no functionality changes in this
  release, but there are a few other packaging changes:
  * The Japanese and Korean translations of the documentation are included.
  * The changelog is now packaged as CHANGELOG, and the license file is
    packaged as LICENSE. NEWS.txt and COPYING.txt are still present,
    but may be removed in the future.
  * TODO.txt is no longer packaged, since a TODO is not relevant for released
    code.
- 4.11.0:
  * Ported unit tests to use pytest.
  * Added special string classes, RubyParenthesisString and RubyTextString,
    to make it possible to treat ruby text specially in get_text() calls.
    [bug=1941980]
  * It's now possible to customize the way output is indented by
    providing a value for the 'indent' argument to the Formatter
    constructor. The 'indent' argument works very similarly to the
    argument of the same name in the Python standard library's
    json.dump() function. [bug=1955497]
  * If the charset-normalizer Python module
    (https://pypi.org/project/charset-normalizer/) is installed, Beautiful
    Soup will use it to detect the character sets of incoming documents.
    This is also the module used by newer versions of the Requests library.
    For the sake of backwards compatibility, chardet and cchardet both take
    precedence if installed. [bug=1955346]
  * Added a workaround for an lxml bug
    (https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1948551) that causes
    problems when parsing a Unicode string beginning with BYTE ORDER MARK.
    [bug=1947768]
  * Issue a warning when an HTML parser is used to parse a document that
    looks like XML but not XHTML. [bug=1939121]
  * Do a better job of keeping track of namespaces as an XML document is
    parsed, so that CSS selectors that use namespaces will do the right
    thing more often. [bug=1946243]
  * Some time ago, the misleadingly named &quot;text&quot; argument to find-type
    methods was renamed to the more accurate &quot;string.&quot; But this supposed
    &quot;renaming&quot; didn't make it into important places like the method
    signatures or the docstrings. That's corrected in this
    version. &quot;text&quot; still works, but will give a DeprecationWarning.
    [bug=1947038]
  * Fixed a crash when pickling a BeautifulSoup object that has no
    tree builder. [bug=1934003]
  * Fixed a crash when overriding multi_valued_attributes and using the
    html5lib parser. [bug=1948488]
  * Standardized the wording of the MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning
    warnings to omit untrusted input and make the warnings less
    judgmental about what you ought to be doing. [bug=1955450]
  * Removed support for the iconv_codec library, which doesn't seem
    to exist anymore and was never put up on PyPI. (The closest
    replacement on PyPI, iconv_codecs, is GPL-licensed, so we can't use
    it--it's also quite old.)

    <comment>- update to 4.12.3:
  * Fixed a regression such that if you set .hidden on a tag, the
    tag becomes invisible but its contents are still visible. User
    manipulation of .hidden is not a documented or supported
    feature, so don't do this, but it wasn't too difficult to
    keep the old behavior
    working.
  * Fixed a case found by Mengyuhan where html.parser giving up
    on markup would result in an AssertionError instead of a
    ParserRejectedMarkup exception.
  * Added the correct stacklevel to instances of the
    XMLParsedAsHTMLWarning.
  * Corrected the syntax of the license definition in
    pyproject.toml.
  * Corrected a typo in a test that was causing test failures
    when run against libxml2 2.12.1.

- Require cchardet explicitly to avoid charset-normalizer braindamage.
- disable tests on SLE_11, fail due to too old python-lxml
- remove lxml support (fails unit test)
- Use recommended lxml parser instead of native one</comment>
