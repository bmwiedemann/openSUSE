Mon Dec 29 09:58:48 UTC 2025 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to 4.14.3
  * When using one of the lxml tree builders, you can pass in
    huge_tree=True to disable lxml's security restrictions and process
    files that include huge text nodes. ("huge" means more than
    10,000,000 bytes of text in a single node). Without this, lxml may
    silently stop processing the file after encountering a huge text
    node.
  * The html.parser tree builder processes numeric character entities
    using the algorithm described in the HTML spec. If this means
    replacing some other character with REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, it will
    set BeautifulSoup.contains_replacement_characters.
  * Added a general test of the html.parser tree builder's ability to
    turn any parsing exception from html.parser into a
    ParserRejectedMarkup exception. This makes it possible to remove
    version-dependent tests that depended on the existence of specific
    bugs in html.parser.
- Add htmlparser.patch to fix behaviour with cpython interpreters

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 13 09:11:52 UTC 2025 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.14.2:
  * Making ResultSet inherit from MutableSequence still resulted
    in too many breaking changes in users of the library,
    so I reverted the ResultSet code back to where it was in 4.13.5
    and added tests of all known breaking behavior. [bug=2125906]
  * Made ResultSet inherit from MutableSequence instead of
    Sequence, since lots of existing code treats ResultSet as a
    mutable list.
  * This version adds function overloading to the find_* methods
    to make it easier to write type-safe Python.
  * The typing for find_parent() and find_parents() was improved
    without any overloading. Casts should never be necessary,
    since those methods only ever return Tag and ResultSet[Tag],
    respectively.
  * ResultSet now inherits from Sequence. This should make it
    easier to incorporate ResultSet objects into your type system
    without needing to handle ResultSet specially.
  * Fixed an unhandled exception when creating the string
    representation of a decomposed element.
  * The default value for the 'attrs' attribute in find* methods
    is now None, not the empty dictionary. This should have no visible
    effect on anything.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 10 07:16:20 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 4.13.5
  * Fixed an unhandled exception when parsing invalid markup that contains the { character
    when using lxml==6.0.0. [bug=2116306]
  * Fixed a regression when matching a multi-valued attribute against the
    empty string. [bug=2115352]
  * Unit tests and test case data are no longer packaged with the wheel. [bug=2107495]
  * Fixed a bug that gave the wrong result when parsing the empty bytestring. [bug=2110492]
  * Brought the Spanish translation of the documentation up to date with
    4.13.4. Courtesy of Carlos Romero.
  * For Python 3.13 and above, disabled tests that verify Beautiful Soup's handling of htmlparser's
    exceptions when given very bad markup. The bug in htmlparser that caused
    this behavior has been fixed. Patch courtesy of Stefano Rivera.
  * Used overloading to improve type hints for prettify().
  * Updated the SoupStrainer documentation to clarify that during initial
    parsing, attribute values are always passed into the SoupStrainer as raw strings. [bug=2111651]
  * Fixed all type checking errors issued by pyright. (Previously only mypy
    was used for type checking.)
  * Improved the type hints for PageElement.replace_with. [bug=2114746]
  * Improved the type hint for the arguments of the lambda function that can
    be used to match a tag's attribute. [bug=2110401]
  * Modified some of the lxml tests to accommodate behavioral changes in libxml2
    2.14.3. Specifically:

    1. XML declarations and processing instructions in HTML documents
    are rewritten as comments. Note that this means XHTML documents will
    now turn into regular HTML documents if run through the 'lxml'
    parser. The 'xml' parser is unaffected.

    2. Out-of-range numeric entities are replaced with REPLACEMENT
    CHARACTER rather than omitted entirely. [bug=2112242]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 13 14:04:39 UTC 2025 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 4.13.4
  * If you pass a function as the first argument to a find* method,
    the function will only ever be called once per tag, with the
    Tag object as the argument. Starting in 4.13.0, there were
    cases where the function would be called with a Tag object and
    then called again with the name of the tag. [bug=2106435]
  * Added a passthrough implementation for
    NavigableString.__getitem__ which gives a more helpful
    exception if the user tries to treat it as a Tag and access its
    HTML attributes.
  * Fixed a bug that caused an exception when unpickling the result
    of parsing certain invalid markup with lxml as the tree
    builder. [bug=2103126]
  * Converted the AUTHORS file to UTF-8 for PEP8 compliance.
    [bug=2107405]
- Release 4.13.3 (20250204)
  * Modified the 4.13.2 change slightly to restore backwards
    compatibility. Specifically, calling a find_* method with no
    arguments should return the first Tag out of the iterator, not
    the first PageElement. [bug=2097333]
- Release 4.13.2 (20250204)
  * Gave ElementFilter the ability to explicitly say that it
    excludes every item in the parse tree. This is used internally
    in situations where the provided filters are logically
    inconsistent or match a value against the null set.

    Without this, it's not always possible to distinguish between a
    SoupStrainer that excludes everything and one that excludes
    nothing.

    This fixes a bug where calls to find_* methods with no
    arguments returned None, instead of the first item out of the
    iterator. [bug=2097333]

    Things added to the API to support this:

    - The ElementFilter.includes_everything property
    - The MatchRule.exclude_everything member
    - The _known_rules argument to ElementFilter.match. This is an
      optional argument used internally to indicate that an
      optimization is safe.
- Release 4.13.1 (20250203)
  * Updated pyproject.toml to require Python 3.7 or above.
    [bug=2097263]
  * Pinned the typing-extensions dependency to a minimum version of
    4.0.0. [bug=2097262]
  * Restored the English documentation to the source distribution.
    [bug=2097237]
  * Fixed a regression where HTMLFormatter and XMLFormatter were
    not propagating the indent parameter to the superconstructor.
    [bug=2097272]
- Release 4.13.0 (20250202)
  * This release introduces Python type hints to all public classes
    and methods in Beautiful Soup. The addition of these type hints
    exposed a large number of very small inconsistencies in the
    code, which I've fixed, but the result is a larger-than-usual
    number of deprecations and changes that may break backwards
    compatibility.

    Chris Papademetrious deserves a special thanks for his work on
    this release through its long beta process.
  ## Deprecation notices
  * These things now give DeprecationWarnings when you try to use
    them, and are scheduled to be removed in Beautiful Soup 4.15.0.
  * Every deprecated method, attribute and class from the 3.0 and
    2.0 major versions of Beautiful Soup. These have been
    deprecated for a very long time, but they didn't issue
    DeprecationWarning when you tried to use them. Now they do, and
    they're all going away soon.

    This mainly refers to methods and attributes with camelCase
    names, for example: renderContents, replaceWith,
    replaceWithChildren, findAll, findAllNext, findAllPrevious,
    findNext, findNextSibling, findNextSiblings, findParent,
    findParents, findPrevious, findPreviousSibling,
    findPreviousSiblings, getText, nextSibling, previousSibling,
    isSelfClosing, fetchNextSiblings, fetchPreviousSiblings,
    fetchPrevious, fetchPreviousSiblings, fetchParents, findChild,
    findChildren, childGenerator, nextGenerator,
    nextSiblingGenerator, previousGenerator,
    previousSiblingGenerator, recursiveChildGenerator, and
    parentGenerator.

    This also includes the BeautifulStoneSoup class.
  * The SAXTreeBuilder class, which was never officially supported
    or tested.
  * The private class method BeautifulSoup._decode_markup(), which
    has not been used inside Beautiful Soup for many years.
  * The first argument to BeautifulSoup.decode has been changed
    from pretty_print:bool to indent_level:int, to match the
    signature of Tag.decode. Using a bool will still work but will
    give you a DeprecationWarning.
  * SoupStrainer.text and SoupStrainer.string are both deprecated,
    since a single item can't capture all the possibilities of a
    SoupStrainer designed to match strings.
  * SoupStrainer.search_tag(). It was never a documented method,
    but if you use it, you should start using
    SoupStrainer.allow_tag_creation() instead.
  * The soup:BeautifulSoup argument to the TreeBuilderForHtml5lib
    constructor is now required, not optional. It's unclear why it
    was optional in the first place, so if you discover you need
    this, contact me for possible un-deprecation.
  ## Compatibility notices
  * This version drops support for Python 3.6. The minimum
    supported major Python version for Beautiful Soup is now Python
    3.7.
  * Deprecation warnings have been added for all deprecated methods
    and attributes (see above). Going forward, deprecated names
    will be removed two feature releases or one major release after
    the deprecation warning is added.
  * The storage for a tag's attribute values now modifies incoming
    values to be consistent with the HTML or XML spec. This means
    that if you set an attribute value to a number, it will be
    converted to a string immediately, rather than being converted
    when you output the document. [bug=2065525]

    More importantly for backwards compatibility, setting an HTML
    attribute value to True will set the attribute's value to the
    appropriate string per the HTML spec. Setting an attribute
    value to False or None will remove the attribute value from the
    tag altogether, rather than (effectively, as before) setting
    the value to the string "False" or the string "None".

    This means that some programs that modify documents will
    generate different output than they would in earlier versions
    of Beautiful Soup, but the new documents are more likely to
    represent the intent behind the modifications.

    To give a specific example, if you have code that looks
    something like this:

  	checkbox1['checked'] = True checkbox2['checked'] = False

    Then a document that used to look like this (with most browsers
    treating both boxes as checked):

  	<input type="checkbox" checked="True"/> <input type="checkbox"
          checked="False"/>

    Will now look like this (with browsers treating only the first
    box as checked):

  	<input type="checkbox" checked="checked"/> <input
  	type="checkbox"/>

    You can get the old behavior back by instantiating a
    TreeBuilder with `attribute_dict_class=dict`, or you can
    customize how Beautiful Soup treates attribute values by
    passing in a custom subclass of dict.
  * If Tag.get_attribute_list() is used to access an attribute
    that's not set, the return value is now an empty list rather
    than [None].
  * If you pass an empty list as the attribute value when searching
    the tree, you will now find all tags which have that attribute
    set to a value in the empty list--that is, you will find
    nothing. This is consistent with other situations where a list
    of acceptable values is provided. Previously, an empty list was
    treated the same as None and False, and you would have found
    the tags which did not have that attribute set at all.
    [bug=2045469]
  * For similar reasons, if you pass in limit=0 to a find() method,
    you will now get zero results. Previously, you would get all
    matching results.
  * When using one of the find() methods or creating a
    SoupStrainer, if you specify the same attribute value in
    ``attrs`` and the keyword arguments, you'll end up with two
    different ways to match that attribute. Previously the value in
    keyword arguments would override the value in ``attrs``.
  * All exceptions were moved to the bs4.exceptions module, and all
    warnings to the bs4._warnings module (named so as not to shadow
    Python's built-in warnings module). All warnings and exceptions
    are exported from the bs4 module, which is probably the safest
    place to import them from in your own code.
  * As a side effect of this, the string constant
    BeautifulSoup.NO_PARSER_SPECIFIED_WARNING was moved to
    GuessedAtParserWarning.MESSAGE.
  * The 'html5' formatter is now much less aggressive about
    escaping ampersands, escaping only the ampersands considered
    "ambiguous" by the HTML5 spec (which is almost none of them).
    This is the sort of change that might break your unit test
    suite, but the resulting markup will be much more readable and
    more HTML5-ish.

    To quickly get the old behavior back, change code like this:

      tag.encode(formatter='html5')

    to this:

      tag.encode(formatter='html5-4.12')

    In the future, the 'html5' formatter may be become the default
    HTML formatter, which will change Beautiful Soup's default
    output. This will break a lot of test suites so it's not going
    to happen for a while. [bug=1902431]
  * Tag.sourceline and Tag.sourcepos now always have a consistent
    data type: Optional[int]. Previously these values were
    sometimes an Optional[int], and sometimes they were
    Optional[Tag], the result of searching for a child tag called
    <sourceline> or <sourcepos>. [bug=2065904]

    If your code does search for a tag called <sourceline> or
    <sourcepos>, it may stop finding that tag when you upgrade to
    Beautiful Soup 4.13. If this happens, you'll need to replace
    code that treats "sourceline" or "sourcepos" as tag names:

       tag.sourceline

    with code that explicitly calls the find() method:

       tag.find("sourceline").name

    Making the behavior of sourceline and sourcepos consistent has
    the side effect of fixing a major performance problem when a
    Tag is copied.

    With this change, the store_line_numbers argument to the
    BeautifulSoup constructor becomes much less useful, and its use
    is now discouraged, thought I'm not deprecating it yet. Please
    contact me if you have a performance or security rationale for
    setting store_line_numbers=False.
  * append(), extend(), insert(), and unwrap() were moved from
    PageElement to Tag. Those methods manipulate the 'contents'
    collection, so they would only have ever worked on Tag objects.
  * The BeautifulSoupHTMLParser constructor now requires a
    BeautifulSoup object as its first argument. This almost
    certainly does not affect you, since you probably use
    HTMLParserTreeBuilder, not BeautifulSoupHTMLParser directly.
  * The TreeBuilderForHtml5lib methods fragmentClass(),
    getFragment(), and testSerializer() now raise
    NotImplementedError. These methods are called only by
    html5lib's test suite, and Beautiful Soup isn't integrated into
    that test suite, so this code was long since unused and
    untested.

    These methods are _not_ deprecated, since they are methods
    defined by html5lib. They may one day have real
    implementations, as part of a future effort to integrate
    Beautiful Soup into html5lib's test suite.
  * AttributeValueWithCharsetSubstitution.encode() is renamed to
    substitute_encoding, to avoid confusion with the much different
    str.encode()
  * Using PageElement.replace_with() to replace an element with
    itself returns the element instead of None.
  * All TreeBuilder constructors now take the empty_element_tags
    argument. The sets of tags found in
    HTMLTreeBuilder.empty_element_tags and
    HTMLTreeBuilder.block_elements are now in
    HTMLTreeBuilder.DEFAULT_EMPTY_ELEMENT_TAGS and
    HTMLTreeBuilder.DEFAULT_BLOCK_ELEMENTS, to avoid confusing them
    with instance variables.
  * The unused constant LXMLTreeBuilderForXML.DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASS
    has been removed.
  * Some of the arguments in the methods of LXMLTreeBuilderForXML
    have been renamed for consistency with the names lxml uses for
    those arguments in the superclass. This won't affect you unless
    you were calling methods like LXMLTreeBuilderForXML.start()
    directly.
  * In particular, the arguments to
    LXMLTreeBuilderForXML.prepare_markup have been changed to match
    the arguments to the superclass, TreeBuilder.prepare_markup.
    Specifically, document_declared_encoding now appears before
    exclude_encodings, not after. If you were calling this method
    yourself, I recommend switching to using keyword arguments
    instead.
  ## New features
  * The new ElementFilter class encapsulates Beautiful Soup's rules
    about matching elements and deciding which parts of a document
    to parse. It's easy to override those rules with subclassing or
    function composition. The SoupStrainer class, which contains
    all the matching logic you're familiar with from the find_*
    methods, is now a subclass of ElementFilter.
  * The new PageElement.filter() method provides a fully general
    way of finding elements in a Beautiful Soup parse tree. You can
    specify a function to iterate over the tree and an
    ElementFilter to determine what matches.
  * The new_tag() method now takes a 'string' argument. This allows
    you to set the string contents of a Tag when creating it. Patch
    by Chris Papademetrious. [bug=2044599]
  * Defined a number of new iterators which are the same as
    existing iterators, but which yield the element itself before
    beginning to traverse the tree. [bug=2052936] [bug=2067634]

    - PageElement.self_and_parents
    - PageElement.self_and_descendants
    - PageElement.self_and_next_elements
    - PageElement.self_and_next_siblings
    - PageElement.self_and_previous_elements
    - PageElement.self_and_previous_siblings

    self_and_parents yields the element you call it on and then all
    of its parents. self_and_next_element yields the element you
    call it on and then every element parsed afterwards; and so on.
  * The NavigableString class now has a .string property which
    returns the string itself. This makes it easier to iterate over
    a mixed list of Tag and NavigableString objects. [bug=2044794]
  * Defined a new method, Tag.copy_self(), which creates a copy of
    a Tag with the same attributes but no contents. [bug=2065120]

    Note that this method used to be a private method named
    _clone(). The _clone() method has been removed, so if you were
    using it, change your code to call copy_self() instead.
  * The PageElement.append() method now returns the element that
    was appended; it used to have no return value. [bug=2093025]
  * The methods PageElement.insert(), PageElement.extend(),
    PageElement.insert_before(), and PageElement.insert_after() now
    return a list of the items inserted. These methods used to have
    no return value. [bug=2093025]
  * The PageElement.insert() method now takes a variable number of
    arguments and returns a list of all elements inserted, to match
    insert_before() and insert_after(). (Even if I hadn't made the
    variable-argument change, an edge case around inserting one
    Beautiful Soup object into another means that insert()'s return
    value needs to be a list.) [bug=2093025]
  * Defined a new warning class, UnusualUsageWarning, which is a
    superclass for all of the warnings issued when Beautiful Soup
    notices something unusual but not guaranteed to be wrong, like
    markup that looks like a URL (MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning) or
    XML being run through an HTML parser (XMLParsedAsHTMLWarning).

    The text of these warnings has been revamped to explain in more
    detail what is going on, how to check if you've made a mistake,
    and how to make the warning go away if you are acting
    deliberately.

    If these warnings are interfering with your workflow, or simply
    annoying you, you can filter all of them by filtering
    UnusualUsageWarning, without worrying about losing the warnings
    Beautiful Soup issues when there *definitely* is a problem you
    need to correct.
  * It's now possible to modify the behavior of the list used to
    store the values of multi-valued attributes such as HTML
    'class', by passing in whatever class you want instantiated
    (instead of a normal Python list) to the TreeBuilder
    constructor as attribute_value_list_class. [bug=2052943]
  ## Improvements
  * decompose() was moved from Tag to its superclass PageElement,
    since there's no reason it won't also work on NavigableString
    objects.
  * Emit an UnusualUsageWarning if the user tries to search for an
    attribute called _class; they probably mean "class_".
    [bug=2025089]
  * The MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning issued when the markup
    resembles a filename is now issued less often, due to
    improvements in detecting markup that's unlikely to be a
    filename. [bug=2052988]
  * Emit a warning if a document is parsed using a SoupStrainer
    that's set up to filter everything. In these cases, filtering
    everything is the most consistent thing to do, but there was no
    indication that this was happening, so the behavior may have
    seemed mysterious.
  * When using one of the find() methods or creating a
    SoupStrainer, you can pass a list of any accepted object
    (strings, regular expressions, etc.) for any of the objects.
    Previously you could only pass in a list of strings.
  * A SoupStrainer can now filter tag creation based on a tag's
    namespaced name. Previously only the unqualified name could be
    used.
  * Added the correct stacklevel to another instance of the
    XMLParsedAsHTMLWarning. [bug=2034451]
  * Improved the wording of the TypeError raised when you pass
    something other than markup into the BeautifulSoup constructor.
    [bug=2071530]
  * Optimized the case where you use Tag.insert() to "insert" a
    PageElement into its current location. [bug=2077020]
  * Changes to make tests work whether tests are run under
    soupsieve 2.6 or an earlier version. Based on a patch by
    Stefano Rivera.
  * Removed the strip_cdata argument to lxml's HTMLParser
    constructor, which never did anything and is deprecated as of
    lxml 5.3.0. Patch by Stefano Rivera. [bug=2076897]
  ## Bug fixes
  * Copying a tag with a multi-valued attribute now makes a copy of
    the list of values, eliminating a bug where both the old and
    new copy shared the same list. [bug=2067412]
  * The lxml TreeBuilder, like the other TreeBuilders, now filters
    a document's initial DOCTYPE if you've set up a SoupStrainer
    that eliminates it. [bug=2062000]
  * A lot of things can go wrong if you modify the parse tree while
    iterating over it, especially if you are removing or replacing
    elements. Most of those things fall under the category of
    unexpected behavior (which is why I don't recommend doing
    this), but there are a few ways that caused unhandled
    exceptions. The list comprehensions used by Beautiful Soup
    (e.g. .descendants, which powers the find* methods) should now
    work correctly in those cases, or at least not raise
    exceptions.

    As part of this work, I changed when the list comprehension
    determines the next element. Previously it was done after the
    yield statement; now it's done before the yield statement. This
    lets you remove the yielded element in calling code, or modify
    it in a way that would break this calculation, without causing
    an exception.

    So if your code relies on modifying the tree in a way that
    'steers' a list comprehension, rather than using the list
    comprension to decide which bits of the tree to modify, it will
    probably stop working at this point. [bug=2091118]
  * Fixed an error in the lookup table used when converting
    ISO-Latin-1 to ASCII, which no one should do anyway.
  * Corrected the markup that's output in the unlikely event that
    you encode a document to a Python internal encoding (like
    "palmos") that's not recognized by the HTML or XML standard.
  * UnicodeDammit.markup is now always a bytestring representing
    the *original* markup (sans BOM), and
    UnicodeDammit.unicode_markup is always the converted Unicode
    equivalent of the original markup. Previously,
    UnicodeDammit.markup was treated inconsistently and would often
    end up containing Unicode. UnicodeDammit.markup was not a
    documented attribute, but if you were using it, you probably
    want to switch to using .unicode_markup instead.

- update to 4.12.3:
  * Fixed a regression such that if you set .hidden on a tag, the
    tag becomes invisible but its contents are still visible. User
    manipulation of .hidden is not a documented or supported
    feature, so don't do this, but it wasn't too difficult to
    keep the old behavior
    working.
  * Fixed a case found by Mengyuhan where html.parser giving up
    on markup would result in an AssertionError instead of a
    ParserRejectedMarkup exception.
  * Added the correct stacklevel to instances of the
    XMLParsedAsHTMLWarning.

    and methods that call it. [bug=2015545]
- 4.12.1:
  * This version of Beautiful Soup replaces setup.py and setup.cfg
    with pyproject.toml. Beautiful Soup now uses tox as its test backend
    and hatch to do builds.
  * The main functional improvement in this version is a nonrecursive technique
    for regenerating a tree. This technique is used to avoid situations where,
    in previous versions, doing something to a very deeply nested tree
    would overflow the Python interpreter stack:
    1. Outputting a tree as a string, e.g. with
       BeautifulSoup.encode() [bug=1471755]
    2. Making copies of trees (copy.copy() and
       copy.deepcopy() from the Python standard library). [bug=1709837]
    3. Pickling a BeautifulSoup object. (Note that pickling a Tag
       object can still cause an overflow.)
  * Making a copy of a BeautifulSoup object no longer parses the
    document again, which should improve performance significantly.
  * When a BeautifulSoup object is unpickled, Beautiful Soup now
    tries to associate an appropriate TreeBuilder object with it.
  * Tag.prettify() will now consistently end prettified markup with
    a newline.
  * Added unit tests for fuzz test cases created by third
    parties. Some of these tests are skipped since they point
    to problems outside of Beautiful Soup, but this change
    puts them all in one convenient place.
  * PageElement now implements the known_xml attribute. (This was technically
    a bug, but it shouldn't be an issue in normal use.) [bug=2007895]
  * The demonstrate_parser_differences.py script was still written in
    Python 2. I've converted it to Python 3, but since no one has
    mentioned this over the years, it's a sign that no one uses this
    script and it's not serving its purpose.
- 4.12.0:
  * Introduced the .css property, which centralizes all access to
    the Soup Sieve API. This allows Beautiful Soup to give direct
    access to as much of Soup Sieve that makes sense, without cluttering
    the BeautifulSoup and Tag classes with a lot of new methods.
    This does mean one addition to the BeautifulSoup and Tag classes
    (the .css property itself), so this might be a breaking change if you
    happen to use Beautiful Soup to parse XML that includes a tag called
    <css>. In particular, code like this will stop working in 4.12.0:

      soup.css['id']

    Code like this will work just as before:

      soup.find_one('css')['id']

    The Soup Sieve methods supported through the .css property are
    select(), select_one(), iselect(), closest(), match(), filter(),
    escape(), and compile(). The BeautifulSoup and Tag classes still
    support the select() and select_one() methods; they have not been
    deprecated, but they have been demoted to convenience methods.

    [bug=2003677]

  * When the html.parser parser decides it can't parse a document, Beautiful
    Soup now consistently propagates this fact by raising a
    ParserRejectedMarkup error. [bug=2007343]
  * Removed some error checking code from diagnose(), which is redundant with
    similar (but more Pythonic) code in the BeautifulSoup constructor.
    [bug=2007344]
  * Added intersphinx references to the documentation so that other
    projects have a target to point to when they reference Beautiful
    Soup classes. [bug=1453370]
- 4.11.2:
  * Fixed test failures caused by nondeterministic behavior of
    UnicodeDammit's character detection, depending on the platform setup.
    [bug=1973072]
  * Fixed another crash when overriding multi_valued_attributes and using the
    html5lib parser. [bug=1948488]
  * The HTMLFormatter and XMLFormatter constructors no longer return a
    value. [bug=1992693]
  * Tag.interesting_string_types is now propagated when a tag is
    copied. [bug=1990400]
  * Warnings now do their best to provide an appropriate stacklevel,
    improving the usefulness of the message. [bug=1978744]
  * Passing a Tag's .contents into PageElement.extend() now works the
    same way as passing the Tag itself.
  * Soup Sieve tests will be skipped if the library is not installed.
- 4.11.1:
  This release was done to ensure that the unit tests are packaged along
  with the released source. There are no functionality changes in this
  release, but there are a few other packaging changes:
  * The Japanese and Korean translations of the documentation are included.
  * The changelog is now packaged as CHANGELOG, and the license file is
    packaged as LICENSE. NEWS.txt and COPYING.txt are still present,
    but may be removed in the future.
  * TODO.txt is no longer packaged, since a TODO is not relevant for released
    code.
- 4.11.0:
  * Ported unit tests to use pytest.
  * Added special string classes, RubyParenthesisString and RubyTextString,
    to make it possible to treat ruby text specially in get_text() calls.
    [bug=1941980]
  * It's now possible to customize the way output is indented by
    providing a value for the 'indent' argument to the Formatter
    constructor. The 'indent' argument works very similarly to the
    argument of the same name in the Python standard library's
    json.dump() function. [bug=1955497]
  * If the charset-normalizer Python module
    (https://pypi.org/project/charset-normalizer/) is installed, Beautiful
    Soup will use it to detect the character sets of incoming documents.
    This is also the module used by newer versions of the Requests library.
    For the sake of backwards compatibility, chardet and cchardet both take
    precedence if installed. [bug=1955346]
  * Added a workaround for an lxml bug
    (https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1948551) that causes
    problems when parsing a Unicode string beginning with BYTE ORDER MARK.
    [bug=1947768]
  * Issue a warning when an HTML parser is used to parse a document that
    looks like XML but not XHTML. [bug=1939121]
  * Do a better job of keeping track of namespaces as an XML document is
    parsed, so that CSS selectors that use namespaces will do the right
    thing more often. [bug=1946243]
  * Some time ago, the misleadingly named "text" argument to find-type
    methods was renamed to the more accurate "string." But this supposed
    "renaming" didn't make it into important places like the method
    signatures or the docstrings. That's corrected in this
    version. "text" still works, but will give a DeprecationWarning.
    [bug=1947038]
  * Fixed a crash when pickling a BeautifulSoup object that has no
    tree builder. [bug=1934003]
  * Fixed a crash when overriding multi_valued_attributes and using the
    html5lib parser. [bug=1948488]
  * Standardized the wording of the MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning
    warnings to omit untrusted input and make the warnings less
    judgmental about what you ought to be doing. [bug=1955450]
  * Removed support for the iconv_codec library, which doesn't seem
    to exist anymore and was never put up on PyPI. (The closest
    replacement on PyPI, iconv_codecs, is GPL-licensed, so we can't use
    it--it's also quite old.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  9 10:14:27 UTC 2022 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 4.10.0:
  * This is the first release of Beautiful Soup to only support Python 3.
  * The behavior of methods like .get_text() and .strings now differs
    depending on the type of tag.
  * NavigableString and its subclasses now implement the get_text()
    method, as well as the properties .strings and
    .stripped_strings.
  * The 'html5' formatter now treats attributes whose values are the
    empty string as HTML boolean attributes.
  * The 'replace_with()' method now takes a variable number of arguments,
    and can be used to replace a single element with a sequence of elements.
  * Corrected output when the namespace prefix associated with a
    namespaced attribute is the empty string, as opposed to
    None.
  * Performance improvement when processing tags that speeds up overall
    tree construction by 2%. Patch by Morotti. [bug=1899358]
  * Corrected the use of special string container classes in cases when a
    single tag may contain strings with different containers; such as
    the <template> tag, which may contain both TemplateString objects
    and Comment objects.
  * The html.parser tree builder can now handle named entities
    found in the HTML5 spec in much the same way that the html5lib
    tree builder does.
  * Added a second way to pass specify encodings to UnicodeDammit and
    EncodingDetector, based on the order of precedence defined in the
    HTML5 spec.
  * Improve the warning issued when a directory name (as opposed to
    the name of a regular file) is passed as markup into the BeautifulSoup
    constructor.
- Do not pass the directory to pytest.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 10 18:34:16 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.9.3:
  * Implemented a significant performance optimization to the process
    of searching the parse tree. Patch by Morotti. [bug=1898212]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 11:41:27 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.9.2:
  * Fixed a bug that caused too many tags to be popped from the tag
    stack during tree building, when encountering a closing tag that had
    no matching opening tag. [bug=1880420]

  * Fixed a bug that inconsistently moved elements over when passing
    a Tag, rather than a list, into Tag.extend(). [bug=1885710]

  * Specify the soupsieve dependency in a way that complies with
    PEP 508. Patch by Mike Nerone. [bug=1893696]

  * Change the signatures for BeautifulSoup.insert_before and insert_after
    (which are not implemented) to match PageElement.insert_before and
    insert_after, quieting warnings in some IDEs. [bug=1897120]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  3 11:10:03 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.9.1:
  * Added a keyword argument 'on_duplicate_attribute' to the
    BeautifulSoupHTMLParser constructor (used by the html.parser tree
    builder) which lets you customize the handling of markup that
    contains the same attribute more than once, as in:
    <a href="url1" href="url2"> [bug=1878209]
  * Added a distinct subclass, GuessedAtParserWarning, for the warning
    issued when BeautifulSoup is instantiated without a parser being
    specified. [bug=1873787]
  * Added a distinct subclass, MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning, for the
    warning issued when BeautifulSoup is instantiated with 'markup' that
    actually seems to be a URL or the path to a file on
    disk. [bug=1873787]
  * The new NavigableString subclasses (Stylesheet, Script, and
    TemplateString) can now be imported directly from the bs4 package.
  * If you encode a document with a Python-specific encoding like
    'unicode_escape', that encoding is no longer mentioned in the final
    XML or HTML document. Instead, encoding information is omitted or
    left blank. [bug=1874955]
  * Fixed test failures when run against soupselect 2.0. Patch by Tomáš
    Chvátal. [bug=1872279]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  1 08:52:41 UTC 2020 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to 4.8.2
  * Added Python docstrings to all public methods of the most commonly
    used classes.
  * Fixed two deprecation warnings. Patches by Colin
    Watson and Nicholas Neumann. [bug=1847592] [bug=1855301]
  * The html.parser tree builder now correctly handles DOCTYPEs that are
    not uppercase. [bug=1848401]
  * PageElement.select() now returns a ResultSet rather than a regular
    list, making it consistent with methods like find_all().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  1 08:59:57 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 4.8.1:
  * When the html.parser or html5lib parsers are in use, Beautiful Soup
    will, by default, record the position in the original document where
    each tag was encountered.
  * Fixed the definition of the default XML namespace when using
    lxml 4.4.
  * Avoid a crash when unpickling certain parse trees generated
    using html5lib on Python 3.
  * Avoid a crash when trying to detect the declared encoding of a
    Unicode document.
- Drop patch beautifulsoup4-lxml-fixes.patch as it seems not needed

Mon Oct 14 11:41:52 UTC 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Replace %fdupes -s with plain %fdupes; hardlinks are better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 22 16:18:23 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.8.0
  * It's now possible to customize the TreeBuilder object by passing
    keyword arguments into the BeautifulSoup constructor. The main
    reason to do this right now is to change how which attributes are
    treated as multi-valued attributes (the way 'class' is treated by
    default). You can do this with the `multi_valued_attributes` argument.
  * The role of Formatter objects has been greatly expanded. The Formatter
    class now controls the following:
    > The function to call to perform entity substitution. (This was
      previously Formatter's only job.)
    > Which tags should be treated as containing CDATA and have their
      contents exempt from entity substitution.
    > The order in which a tag's attributes are output.
    > Whether or not to put a '/' inside a void element, e.g. '<br/>' vs '<br>'
    All preexisting code should work as before.
  * Added a new method to the API, Tag.smooth(), which consolidates
    multiple adjacent NavigableString elements.
  * &apos; (which is valid in XML, XHTML, and HTML 5, but not HTML 4) is now
    recognized as a named entity and converted to a single quote.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 11:23:21 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Do not generate doc for py2 and py3 variant they are the same
  so keep just one around
- Update to 4.7.1:
  * Fixed a significant performance problem introduced in 4.7.0. [bug=1810617]
  * Fixed an incorrectly raised exception when inserting a tag before or
    after an identical tag. [bug=1810692]
  * Beautiful Soup will no longer try to keep track of namespaces that
    are not defined with a prefix; this can confuse soupselect. [bug=1810680]
  * Tried even harder to avoid the deprecation warning originally fixed in
     4.6.1. [bug=1778909]
  * Beautiful Soup's CSS Selector implementation has been replaced by a
    dependency on Isaac Muse's SoupSieve project (the soupsieve package
    on PyPI). The good news is that SoupSieve has a much more robust and
    complete implementation of CSS selectors, resolving a large number
    of longstanding issues. The bad news is that from this point onward,
    SoupSieve must be installed if you want to use the select() method.
  * Added the PageElement.extend() method, which works like list.append().
     [bug=1514970]
  * PageElement.insert_before() and insert_after() now take a variable
     number of arguments. [bug=1514970]
  * Fix a number of problems with the tree builder that caused
    trees that were superficially okay, but which fell apart when bits
    were extracted. Patch by Isaac Muse. [bug=1782928,1809910]
  * Fixed a problem with the tree builder in which elements that
    contained no content (such as empty comments and all-whitespace
    elements) were not being treated as part of the tree. Patch by Isaac
    Muse. [bug=1798699]
  * Fixed a problem with multi-valued attributes where the value
    contained whitespace. Thanks to Jens Svalgaard for the
    fix. [bug=1787453]
  * Clarified ambiguous license statements in the source code. Beautiful
    Soup is released under the MIT license, and has been since 4.4.0.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  6 14:47:30 UTC 2018 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 4.6.3
 * Fix an exception when a custom formatter was asked to format
     a void element

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  5 11:02:25 UTC 2018 - adrian@suse.de

- update to 4.6.1:
  * Stop data loss when encountering an empty numeric entity, and
    possibly in other cases.  Thanks to tos.kamiya for the fix. [bug=1698503]

  * Preserve XML namespaces introduced inside an XML document, not just
     the ones introduced at the top level. [bug=1718787]

  * Added a new formatter, "html5", which represents void elements
     as "<element>" rather than "<element/>".  [bug=1716272]

  * Fixed a problem where the html.parser tree builder interpreted
    a string like "&foo " as the character entity "&foo;"  [bug=1728706]

  * Correctly handle invalid HTML numeric character entities like &#147;
    which reference code points that are not Unicode code points. Note
    that this is only fixed when Beautiful Soup is used with the
    html.parser parser -- html5lib already worked and I couldn't fix it
    with lxml.  [bug=1782933]

  * Improved the warning given when no parser is specified. [bug=1780571]

  * When markup contains duplicate elements, a select() call that
    includes multiple match clauses will match all relevant
    elements. [bug=1770596]

  * Fixed code that was causing deprecation warnings in recent Python 3
    versions. Includes a patch from Ville Skyttä. [bug=1778909] [bug=1689496]

  * Fixed a Windows crash in diagnose() when checking whether a long
    markup string is a filename. [bug=1737121]

  * Stopped HTMLParser from raising an exception in very rare cases of
    bad markup. [bug=1708831]

  * Fixed a bug where find_all() was not working when asked to find a
    tag with a namespaced name in an XML document that was parsed as
    HTML. [bug=1723783]

  * You can get finer control over formatting by subclassing
    bs4.element.Formatter and passing a Formatter instance into (e.g.)
    encode(). [bug=1716272]

  * You can pass a dictionary of `attrs` into
    BeautifulSoup.new_tag. This makes it possible to create a tag with
    an attribute like 'name' that would otherwise be masked by another
    argument of new_tag. [bug=1779276]

  * Clarified the deprecation warning when accessing tag.fooTag, to cover
    the possibility that you might really have been looking for a tag
    called 'fooTag'.

Wed Jul  5 06:28:31 UTC 2017 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 4.6.0:
  * Added the `Tag.get_attribute_list` method, which acts like `Tag.get` for
    getting the value of an attribute, but which always returns a list,
    whether or not the attribute is a multi-value attribute. [bug=1678589]
  * Improved the handling of empty-element tags like <br> when using the
    html.parser parser. [bug=1676935]
  * HTML parsers treat all HTML4 and HTML5 empty element tags (aka void
    element tags) correctly. [bug=1656909]
  * Namespace prefix is preserved when an XML tag is copied. Thanks
    to Vikas for a patch and test. [bug=1685172]

  * Fixed foster parenting when html5lib is the tree builder. Thanks
    to Geoffrey Sneddon for a patch and test.
  * Fixed yet another problem that caused the html5lib tree builder to
    create a disconnected parse tree. [bug=1629825]
  changes from version 4.5.2:
  * Apart from the version number, this release is identical to
    4.5.3. Due to user error, it could not be completely uploaded to
    PyPI. Use 4.5.3 instead.

- Relax BuildRequires for python-Sphinx

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  1 10:26:24 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 4.5.1:
  * Fixed a crash when passing Unicode markup that contained a
    processing instruction into the lxml HTML parser on Python
    3. [bug=1608048]
  * Beautiful Soup is no longer compatible with Python 2.6. This
    actually happened a few releases ago, but it's now official.
  * Beautiful Soup will now work with versions of html5lib greater than
    0.99999999. [bug=1603299]
  * If a search against each individual value of a multi-valued
    attribute fails, the search will be run one final time against the
    complete attribute value considered as a single string. That is, if
    a tag has class="foo bar" and neither "foo" nor "bar" matches, but
    "foo bar" does, the tag is now considered a match.
    This happened in previous versions, but only when the value being
    searched for was a string. Now it also works when that value is
    a regular expression, a list of strings, etc. [bug=1476868]
  * Fixed a bug that deranged the tree when a whitespace element was
    reparented into a tag that contained an identical whitespace
    element. [bug=1505351]
  * Added support for CSS selector values that contain quoted spaces,
    such as tag[style="display: foo"]. [bug=1540588]
  * Corrected handling of XML processing instructions. [bug=1504393]
  * Corrected an encoding error that happened when a BeautifulSoup
    object was copied. [bug=1554439]
  * The contents of <textarea> tags will no longer be modified when the
    tree is prettified. [bug=1555829]
  * When a BeautifulSoup object is pickled but its tree builder cannot
    be pickled, its .builder attribute is set to None instead of being
    destroyed. This avoids a performance problem once the object is
    unpickled. [bug=1523629]
  * Specify the file and line number when warning about a
    BeautifulSoup object being instantiated without a parser being
    specified. [bug=1574647]
  * The `limit` argument to `select()` now works correctly, though it's
    not implemented very efficiently. [bug=1520530]
  * Fixed a Python 3 ByteWarning when a URL was passed in as though it
    were markup. Thanks to James Salter for a patch and
    test. [bug=1533762]
  * We don't run the check for a filename passed in as markup if the
    'filename' contains a less-than character; the less-than character
    indicates it's most likely a very small document. [bug=1577864]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 15 16:31:46 UTC 2015 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.4.1
  * Fixed a bug that deranged the tree when part of it was
    removed. Thanks to Eric Weiser for the patch and John Wiseman for a
    test. lp#1481520
  * Fixed a parse bug with the html5lib tree-builder. Thanks to Roel
    Kramer for the patch. lp#1483781
  * Improved the implementation of CSS selector grouping. Thanks to
    Orangain for the patch. lp#1484543
  * Fixed the test_detect_utf8 test so that it works when chardet is
    installed. lp#1471359

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 27 18:54:20 UTC 2015 - aloisio@gmx.com

- update to 4.4.0
  Especially important changes:
  * Added a warning when you instantiate a BeautifulSoup object without
    explicitly naming a parser. [bug=1398866]
  * __repr__ now returns an ASCII bytestring in Python 2, and a Unicode
    string in Python 3, instead of a UTF8-encoded bytestring in both
    versions. In Python 3, __str__ now returns a Unicode string instead
    of a bytestring. [bug=1420131]
  * The `text` argument to the find_* methods is now called `string`,
    which is more accurate. `text` still works, but `string` is the
    argument described in the documentation. `text` may eventually
    change its meaning, but not for a very long time. [bug=1366856]
  * Changed the way soup objects work under copy.copy(). Copying a
    NavigableString or a Tag will give you a new NavigableString that's
    equal to the old one but not connected to the parse tree. Patch by
    Martijn Peters. [bug=1307490]
  * Started using a standard MIT license. [bug=1294662]
  * Added a Chinese translation of the documentation by Delong .w.
  New features:
  * Introduced the select_one() method, which uses a CSS selector but
    only returns the first match, instead of a list of
    matches. [bug=1349367]
  * You can now create a Tag object without specifying a
    TreeBuilder. Patch by Martijn Pieters. [bug=1307471]
  * You can now create a NavigableString or a subclass just by invoking
    the constructor. [bug=1294315]
  * Added an `exclude_encodings` argument to UnicodeDammit and to the
    Beautiful Soup constructor, which lets you prohibit the detection of
    an encoding that you know is wrong. [bug=1469408]
  * The select() method now supports selector grouping. Patch by
    Francisco Canas [bug=1191917]
  Bug fixes:
  * Fixed yet another problem that caused the html5lib tree builder to
    create a disconnected parse tree. [bug=1237763]
  * Force object_was_parsed() to keep the tree intact even when an element
    from later in the document is moved into place. [bug=1430633]
  * Fixed yet another bug that caused a disconnected tree when html5lib
    copied an element from one part of the tree to another. [bug=1270611]
  * Fixed a bug where Element.extract() could create an infinite loop in
    the remaining tree.
  * The select() method can now find tags whose names contain
    dashes. Patch by Francisco Canas. [bug=1276211]
  * The select() method can now find tags with attributes whose names
    contain dashes. Patch by Marek Kapolka. [bug=1304007]
  * Improved the lxml tree builder's handling of processing
    instructions. [bug=1294645]
  * Restored the helpful syntax error that happens when you try to
    import the Python 2 edition of Beautiful Soup under Python 3.
    [bug=1213387]
  * In Python 3.4 and above, set the new convert_charrefs argument to
    the html.parser constructor to avoid a warning and future
    failures. Patch by Stefano Revera. [bug=1375721]
  * The warning when you pass in a filename or URL as markup will now be
    displayed correctly even if the filename or URL is a Unicode
    string. [bug=1268888]
  * If the initial <html> tag contains a CDATA list attribute such as
    'class', the html5lib tree builder will now turn its value into a
    list, as it would with any other tag. [bug=1296481]
  * Fixed an import error in Python 3.5 caused by the removal of the
    HTMLParseError class. [bug=1420063]
  * Improved docstring for encode_contents() and
    decode_contents(). [bug=1441543]
  * Fixed a crash in Unicode, Dammit's encoding detector when the name
    of the encoding itself contained invalid bytes. [bug=1360913]
  * Improved the exception raised when you call .unwrap() or
    .replace_with() on an element that's not attached to a tree.
  * Raise a NotImplementedError whenever an unsupported CSS pseudoclass
    is used in select(). Previously some cases did not result in a
    NotImplementedError.
  * It's now possible to pickle a BeautifulSoup object no matter which
    tree builder was used to create it. However, the only tree builder
    that survives the pickling process is the HTMLParserTreeBuilder
    ('html.parser'). If you unpickle a BeautifulSoup object created with
    some other tree builder, soup.builder will be None. [bug=1231545]

- update to 4.3.2
  * Fixed a bug in which short Unicode input was improperly encoded to
    ASCII when checking whether or not it was the name of a file on
    disk. [bug=1227016]
  * Fixed a crash when a short input contains data not valid in
    filenames. [bug=1232604]
  * Fixed a bug that caused Unicode data put into UnicodeDammit to
    return None instead of the original data. [bug=1214983]
  * Combined two tests to stop a spurious test failure when tests are
    run by nosetests. [bug=1212445]
- update to 4.3.1
  * Fixed yet another problem with the html5lib tree builder, caused by
    html5lib's tendency to rearrange the tree during
    parsing. [bug=1189267]
  * Fixed a bug that caused the optimized version of find_all() to
    return nothing. [bug=1212655]
- update to 4.3.0
  * Instead of converting incoming data to Unicode and feeding it to the
    lxml tree builder in chunks, Beautiful Soup now makes successive
    guesses at the encoding of the incoming data, and tells lxml to
    parse the data as that encoding. Giving lxml more control over the
    parsing process improves performance and avoids a number of bugs and
    issues with the lxml parser which had previously required elaborate
    workarounds:
    - An issue in which lxml refuses to parse Unicode strings on some
      systems. [bug=1180527]
    - A returning bug that truncated documents longer than a (very
      small) size. [bug=963880]
    - A returning bug in which extra spaces were added to a document if
      the document defined a charset other than UTF-8. [bug=972466]
    This required a major overhaul of the tree builder architecture. If
    you wrote your own tree builder and didn't tell me, you'll need to
    modify your prepare_markup() method.
  * The UnicodeDammit code that makes guesses at encodings has been
    split into its own class, EncodingDetector. A lot of apparently
    redundant code has been removed from Unicode, Dammit, and some
    undocumented features have also been removed.
  * Beautiful Soup will issue a warning if instead of markup you pass it
    a URL or the name of a file on disk (a common beginner's mistake).
  * A number of optimizations improve the performance of the lxml tree
    builder by about 33%, the html.parser tree builder by about 20%, and
    the html5lib tree builder by about 15%.
  * All find_all calls should now return a ResultSet object. Patch by
    Aaron DeVore. [bug=1194034]

- Update upstream URL

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 11:52:34 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 4.2.1:
 * The default XML formatter will now replace ampersands even if they
   appear to be part of entities. That is, "&lt;" will become
   "&amp;lt;". The old code was left over from Beautiful Soup 3, which
   didn't always turn entities into Unicode characters.

   If you really want the old behavior (maybe because you add new
   strings to the tree, those strings include entities, and you want
   the formatter to leave them alone on output), it can be found in
   EntitySubstitution.substitute_xml_containing_entities(). [bug=1182183]

 * Gave new_string() the ability to create subclasses of
   NavigableString. [bug=1181986]

 * Fixed another bug by which the html5lib tree builder could create a
   disconnected tree. [bug=1182089]

 * The .previous_element of a BeautifulSoup object is now always None,
   not the last element to be parsed. [bug=1182089]

 * Fixed test failures when lxml is not installed. [bug=1181589]

 * html5lib now supports Python 3. Fixed some Python 2-specific
   code in the html5lib test suite. [bug=1181624]

 * The html.parser treebuilder can now handle numeric attributes in
   text when the hexidecimal name of the attribute starts with a
   capital X. Patch by Tim Shirley. [bug=1186242]

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- disable tests on SLE_11, fail due to too old python-lxml

Sat May 18 13:30:00 UTC 2013 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to  4.2.0
    * The Tag.select() method now supports a much wider variety of CSS
      selectors.
        - Added support for the adjacent sibling combinator (+) and the
          general sibling combinator (~). Tests by "liquider". [bug=1082144]
        - The combinators (>, +, and ~) can now combine with any supported
          selector, not just one that selects based on tag name.
        - Added limited support for the "nth-of-type" pseudo-class. Code
          by Sven Slootweg. [bug=1109952]
    * The BeautifulSoup class is now aliased to "_s" and "_soup", making
      it quicker to type the import statement in an interactive session
      The alias may change in the future, so don't use this in code you're
      going to run more than once.
    * Added the 'diagnose' submodule, which includes several useful
      functions for reporting problems and doing tech support.
        - diagnose(data) tries the given markup on every installed parser,
          reporting exceptions and displaying successes. If a parser is not
          installed, diagnose() mentions this fact.
        - lxml_trace(data, html=True) runs the given markup through lxml's
          XML parser or HTML parser, and prints out the parser events as
          they happen. This helps you quickly determine whether a given
          problem occurs in lxml code or Beautiful Soup code.
        - htmlparser_trace(data) is the same thing, but for Python's
          built-in HTMLParser class.
    * In an HTML document, the contents of a <script> or <style> tag will
      no longer undergo entity substitution by default. XML documents work
      the same way they did before. [bug=1085953]
    * Methods like get_text() and properties like .strings now only give
      you strings that are visible in the document--no comments or
      processing commands. [bug=1050164]
    * The prettify() method now leaves the contents of <pre> tags
      alone. [bug=1095654]
    * Fix a bug in the html5lib treebuilder which sometimes created
      disconnected trees. [bug=1039527]
    * Fix a bug in the lxml treebuilder which crashed when a tag included
      an attribute from the predefined "xml:" namespace. [bug=1065617]
    * Fix a bug by which keyword arguments to find_parent() were not
      being passed on. [bug=1126734]
    * Stop a crash when unwisely messing with a tag that's been
      decomposed. [bug=1097699]
    * Now that lxml's segfault on invalid doctype has been fixed, fixed a
      corresponding problem on the Beautiful Soup end that was previously
      invisible. [bug=984936]
    * Fixed an exception when an overspecified CSS selector didn't match
      anything. Code by Stefaan Lippens. [bug=1168167]
