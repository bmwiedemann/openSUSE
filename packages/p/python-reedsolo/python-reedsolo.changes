- update to 1.7.0:
  * Drop cythonization by default, to avoid installation issues
    for users with Cython installed but no C++ compiler.
    Cythonization needs to be requested explictly now, using `pip
    install --upgrade reedsolo --install-option="--cythonize"
    --verbose`.
  * Clarify license to ensure Public Domain-like rights are
    granted to users, via the Unlicense or MIT-0 License at the
    user's preference (big thanks to @musicinmybrain Ben
    Beasley).
