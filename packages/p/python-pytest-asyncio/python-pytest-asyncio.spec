%description
pytest-asyncio is a Python library used for testing asyncio code with pytest.

asyncio code is usually written in the form of coroutines, which makes it
slightly more difficult to test using normal testing tools. pytest-asyncio
provides useful fixtures and markers to make testing easier.
