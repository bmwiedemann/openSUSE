- Limit numpy to < 2 due to dask-array. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 14 10:10:54 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- skip python 3.9 due to missing ipython

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 21 09:36:30 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.12.3:
  * Variance included by Boris
  * Visualizer updated to include variance  by Boris
  * Visualizer updated to make it flexible by Gerd
  * Tests updated by Boris
  * get_spectrum_dims is renamed to get spectral_dims
- update to 0.12.1:
  * updates to some of the visualizers (spectrum visualizer for
    example)
  * bug fix to Sidpy Fitter class that was preventing proper
    scaling with multiple workers
  * changes on the backend regarding getting and setting
    dimensions
  * additional tests
- update to 0.12.0:
  * New version of sidpy has been released. The major change is
    that previous operations that would have resulted in return
    of numpy or dask arrays are now programmed to return sidpy
    dataset objects. This is particularly useful for instance
    when wishing to crop, slice, and perform standard arithmetic
    operations on sidpy datasets. The sidpy.fitter class has been
    updated to allow for complex datasets. An example notebook is
    provided here

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 27 16:09:40 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

  python3.11 yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  8 12:27:54 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 0.11.2
  * compatibility to numpy >1.24
- 0.11.1
  * Minor release. Small fixes to image windowing, four dimensional visualizer,
    and adding of a structure attribute to the sidpy.dataset object.
- 0.11
  * Added CHANNEL dimension type for sidpy dimensions (for example of usage see
    this link) . This is useful for multi-channel spectral datasets, which can
    now be plotted using the intrinsic .plot() method
  * Added updated capability on spectral visualizer to enable plotting of
    multi-channel spectra
  * Small changes with set_dimension() method to be more robust
  * Minor bug fixes
  * Updates to various tests
- 0.10
  * This release adds a few 'under the hood' changes to the sidpy dataset
    object, with respect to chunking and folding/unfolding. Some minor edits to
    some visualization functions were also made. A new method
    visualize_fit_results() to the SidFitter class was added to aid in
    visualization of functional fits.
- 0.0.9
  * Added fitter class and improved tests.
