Tue Apr  2 18:54:36 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.4.0:
  * Added support for Python interpreters statically linked
    against libc or linked against alternative implementations
    of libc like musl
  * Added support for Pyodide
  * Extended FlexiBLAS support to be able to switch backend at
    runtime.
  * Added support for FlexiBLAS
  * Fixed a bug where an unsupported library would be detected
    because it shares a common prefix with one of the supported
    libraries. Now the symbols are also checked to
    identify the supported libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  8 16:25:46 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.2.0:
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6 and 3.7.
  * Added support for custom library controllers. Custom
    controllers must inherit from the `threadpoolctl.LibController`
    class and be registered to threadpoolctl using the
    `threadpoolctl.register` function.

Sat Jun 10 17:41:18 UTC 2023 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Add %{?sle15_python_module_pythons}

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  3 04:34:43 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Add missing BuildRequires on numpy.
- Remove unneeded BuildRequires on pep517.
- Stop using python_sitelib/*.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 24 08:40:55 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.1.0:
  * Fixed a detection issue of the BLAS libraires packaged by conda-forge on Windows.
    https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/112
  * `threadpool_limits` and `ThreadpoolController.limit` now accept the string
    "sequential_blas_under_openmp" for the `limits` parameter. It should only be used for
    the specific case when one wants to have sequential BLAS calls within an OpenMP
    parallel region. It takes into account the unexpected behavior of OpenBLAS with the
    OpenMP threading layer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 16 22:16:06 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.0.0:
  - New object `threadpooctl.ThreadpoolController` which holds controllers for all the
    supported native libraries. The states of these libraries is accessible through the
    `info` method (equivalent to `threadpoolctl.threadpool_info()`) and their number of
    threads can be limited with the `limit` method which can be used as a context
    manager (equivalent to `threadpoolctl.threadpool_limits()`).
  - Added support for OpenBLAS built for 64bit integers in Fortran.
  - Added the possibility to use `threadpoolctl.threadpool_limits` and
    `threadpooctl.ThreadpoolController` as decorators through their `wrap` method.
  - Fixed an attribute error when using old versions of OpenBLAS or BLIS that are
    missing version query functions.
  - Fixed an attribute error when python is run with -OO.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 19 06:27:59 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.2.0:
  - Report the architecture of the CPU cores detected by OpenBLAS
    (`openblas_get_corename`) in `threadpool_info()` and BLIS
    (`bli_arch_query_id` and `bli_arch_string`).
  - Fixed a bug when the version of MKL was not found. The
    "version" field is now set to None in that case.
    https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/82
- drop python_executable.patch (upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 24 11:21:21 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.0
  * New commandline interface: 'python -m threadpoolctl -i numpy'
    will try to import the `numpy` package and then return the output of
    `threadpoolctl.threadpool_info()` on STDOUT formatted using the JSON
    syntax. This makes it easier to quickly introspect a Python environment.
- Add patch python_executable.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 13:02:43 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- initial version 2.0.0, required by python-joblib
