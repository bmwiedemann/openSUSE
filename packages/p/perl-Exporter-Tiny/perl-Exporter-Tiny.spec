%description
Exporter::Tiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing features
including renaming imported functions with the '-as', '-prefix' and
'-suffix' options; explicit destinations with the 'into' option; and
alternative installers with the 'installer' option. But it's written in
only about 40% as many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.

Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration
done through the '@EXPORT', '@EXPORT_OK' and '%EXPORT_TAGS' package
variables.
