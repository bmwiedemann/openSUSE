   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - If exporting non-CODE items which happen to have the same name as
     exported CODE items, their export was being quietly blocked. These
     exports should now work.
     Diab Jerius++
     <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-exporter-tiny/issues/9>
   - Using ! with a tag now works; it was previously documented as working
     but not implemented.

   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Bug in handling regexps in import lists; Exporter::Tiny allowed regexps
     like /foo/i but not /foo/. Having trailing flags is now optional!
     Tomohiro Hosaka++
     <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-exporter-tiny/issues/6>
   - Tests would fail if `PERL5OPT=-Mfeature=:5.18` environment variable was
     set. This is because bareword `-default` was being interpreted as the
     Perl `default` keyword.
