    the time)
  * Code: art The program has been rewritten to ease the
    readability and maintainability. (+Using static typing)
  * Tests: heavy_check_mark New workflows are now in place to

    trying to infer it using the encoding name/alphabets used.
  * Removal: fire Removed support for these languages: Catalan,

    only for Python 3.5 due to constraint. Dropping for every
    other interpreter version.

    to the sub-match factoring process.
