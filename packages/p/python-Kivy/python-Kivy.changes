 * New Widgets!
  + ActionBar: Mimics Android’s own ActionBar appearance and
    mechanisms
  + Behaviors: ButtonBehavior, ToggleButtonBehavior, DragBehavior,
    just subclass a behavior to an existing widgets, and you get the
    behavior! (eg. class ImageButton(ButtonBehavior, Image))
  + PageLayout: A simple multi-page layout allowing flipping through
    pages using borders
  + SandBox (experimental): Runs itself and its children in an
    exception-catching sandbox
