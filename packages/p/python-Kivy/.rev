    <comment>- Trim redundancies from descriptions.
- Update to version 1.10.1 (see https://kivy.org/#changelog)
- Converted to single-spec
- Put documentation and examples into -doc subpackage
- Dropped python-Kivy-rpmlintrc
- Edited %files to explicitly package %{_docdir}/%{name} to clear
  unpackaged files builderror in openSUSE:Factory
- drop recommendation for obsolete GStreamer 0.10 (not necessary)
  and pycairo (not used at all)
- updated to latest release 1.9.1
  + a lot of changes VERY SMALL cherry picked list follows
    - move to SDL2
    - implement Window.show_cursor for pygame and sdl2
    - Adds kivy namespaces.
    - audio_sdl2: support sequenced formats
    - Initial support for rendering of SVG
    - hid input: default is inverted now,
      also the invertion function was wrong
    - add error logging for opengl
    - core/audio: new pure-python/pyobjus AVFoundation audio player
- Added rpmlintrc file to filter out fsf address and python abi noise
- removed patch python-Kivy-Cython-0.21.patch as it is in package  
- Replace python-imaging BuildRequires and Requires with
  python-Pillow: The code actually does 'from PIL import image', so
  pythom-imaging would not even work.
- Add python-Kivy-Cython-0.21.patch: Fix build with Cython 0.21.
- Update to version 1.8.0 
 * Python 3.3 support: It's finally here, using the same codebase! And
   we deliver also 3 portables for Windows, one that package Python 2.7
   and another with Python 3.3!
 * New media player named GstPlayer, based on Gstreamer 1.0. This
   player is currently used as a implementation for Audio and Video
   core provider. This allow us to not only use the latest Gstreamer
   and all the improvements done by them, but also have a common player
   for both Python 2.7 and 3.3 on desktop platforms.
 * Scrollview has been slightly enhanced to support smoother scrolling
   utilizing Matrix transformation by default. It also now supports
   scrolling through bars or content or both.
 * Widgets now can be disabled simply by using `disabled` property.
 * Textinput now has support for selection handles.
 * New Widgets!
  + ActionBar: Mimics Android’s own ActionBar appearance and
    mechanisms
  + Behaviors: ButtonBehavior, ToggleButtonBehavior, DragBehavior,
    just subclass a behavior to an existing widgets, and you get the
    behavior! (eg. class ImageButton(ButtonBehavior, Image))
  + PageLayout: A simple multi-page layout allowing flipping through
    pages using borders
  + SandBox (experimental): Runs itself and its children in an
    exception-catching sandbox
 * see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kivy-users/PePoXLXDYBk
