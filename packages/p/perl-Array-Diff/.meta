  <title>Find the differences between two arrays</title>
  <description>This module compares two *pre-sorted* arrays and returns the added or deleted elements in two separate arrays. It's a simple wrapper around Algorithm::Diff.

*Note*: the arrays must be sorted before you call 'diff'.

And if you need more complex array tools, check Array::Compare.</description>
