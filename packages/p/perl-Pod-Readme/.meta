  <title>Convert POD to README file</title>
  <description>This module is a subclass of L&lt;Pod::PlainText&gt; which provides additional
POD markup for generating F&lt;README&gt; files.

Why should one bother with this? One can simply use

  pod2text Module.pm &gt; README

A problem with doing that is that the default L&lt;pod2text&gt; converter will
add text to links, so that &quot;LZ&lt;&gt;&lt;Module&gt;&quot; is translated to &quot;the Module
manpage&quot;.

Another problem is that the F&lt;README&gt; includes the entirety of the module
documentation! Most people browsing the F&lt;README&gt; file do not need all of
this information.

Likewise, including installation and requirement information in the module
documentation is not necessary either, since the module is already
installed.

This module allows authors to mark portions of the POD to be included only
in, or to be excluded from the F&lt;README&gt; file. It also allows you to
include portions of another file (such as a separate F&lt;ChangeLog&gt;).</description>
