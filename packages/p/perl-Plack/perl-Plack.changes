  1.0040  2016-04-01 09:57:06 PDT
      [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
          - Fixes a mistake in the value of %D and %T in Accesslog::Timed middleware.
            This is due to a bug in Apache::LogFormat::Compiler that sets a wrong value
            for these fields. This bug has been fixed and now it emits what the documentation
            has always said, in the same way as how Apache's log format works.
  
            However, this is a BREAKING CHANGE if you are using '%D' or '%T' in your log
            formats, and you'll likely need to swap them if you need the same values as
            previously. Read https://github.com/plack/Plack/issues/549 for more details.

          - Fix log4perl tests to pass when running in parallel (rsimoes) #545

- updated to 1.0031
     [SECURITY]
         - Plack::App::File would previously strip trailing slashes off
           provided paths. This in combination with the common pattern
           of serving files with Plack::Middleware::Static could allow
           an attacker to bypass a whitelist of generated files (avar) #446

  [NEW FEATURES]
      - Plack::Test now has a simpler object-oriented interface that doesn't
        take multiple callbacks. #420

      - bump dependencies for Test::TCP and HTTP::Tiny
      - Set no_proxy for HTTP::Tiny in tests (kazeburo)

- updated to 1.0028

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  9 05:38:38 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- update to 1.0028
    [IMPROVEMENTS]
        - Skip cgi related tests for Win32 (chorny) #413
        - Skip tests that could potentially write empty bytes, which could cause
          issues on some servers on local sockets with HTTP::Tiny
        - Skip tests that require HTTP::Cookies, if not available #414
        - Not a dev release, including XS free version of Plack::Test*
        - Fix cgibin tests that often fail on Win32 #375

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
        - use HTTP::Tiny in Plack::Test::Suite and Plack::Test::Server rather than skipping it.
        - No XS! Eliminates dependency to LWP::UserAgent by making it completely optional for
          testing. If you run Plack::Test with Server implemenetation or run Plack::Test::Suite
          (for PSGI handlers) without LWP installed, the tests will automatically be skipped.
          This removes the eventual sub-dependency to HTML::Parser, which is the only XS dependency
          in Plack. #408

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
        - Fixed the warning in OO usage of Plack::Builder (doy) #407
        - Shotgun loader now dies if used in Win32 since it leaks memory #320, #400

        - Some Metadata cleanup and Travis CI
        - Use Apache::LogFormat::Compiler in AccessLog (kazeburo)

    [BUG FIXES]
        - Fixed a major bug in 1.0020-1.0021 where posix_default prevents arbitrary arguments
          for plackup-compat (e.g. starman) to handle them (Thanks to justnoxx) Starman#66

        - Fixed test warnings (Keedi Kim)
