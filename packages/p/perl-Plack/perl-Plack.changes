  1.0040  2016-04-01 09:57:06 PDT
      [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
          - Fixes a mistake in the value of %D and %T in Accesslog::Timed middleware.
            This is due to a bug in Apache::LogFormat::Compiler that sets a wrong value
            for these fields. This bug has been fixed and now it emits what the documentation
            has always said, in the same way as how Apache's log format works.
  
            However, this is a BREAKING CHANGE if you are using '%D' or '%T' in your log
            formats, and you'll likely need to swap them if you need the same values as
            previously. Read https://github.com/plack/Plack/issues/549 for more details.

         - Plack::App::File would previously strip trailing slashes off
           provided paths. This in combination with the common pattern

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
        - Skip cgi related tests for Win32 (chorny) #413
        - Skip tests that could potentially write empty bytes, which could cause
          issues on some servers on local sockets with HTTP::Tiny
        - Skip tests that require HTTP::Cookies, if not available #414
        - Not a dev release, including XS free version of Plack::Test*
        - Fix cgibin tests that often fail on Win32 #375

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
        - use HTTP::Tiny in Plack::Test::Suite and Plack::Test::Server rather than skipping it.
        - No XS! Eliminates dependency to LWP::UserAgent by making it completely optional for
          testing. If you run Plack::Test with Server implemenetation or run Plack::Test::Suite
          (for PSGI handlers) without LWP installed, the tests will automatically be skipped.
          This removes the eventual sub-dependency to HTML::Parser, which is the only XS dependency
          in Plack. #408

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
