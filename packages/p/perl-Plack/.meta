  <title>Perl Superglue for Web frameworks and Web Servers (PSGI toolkit)</title>
  <description>Plack is a set of tools for using the PSGI stack. It contains middleware
components, a reference server and utilities for Web application
frameworks. Plack is like Ruby's Rack or Python's Paste for WSGI.

See the PSGI manpage for the PSGI specification and the PSGI::FAQ manpage
to know what PSGI and Plack are and why we need them.
