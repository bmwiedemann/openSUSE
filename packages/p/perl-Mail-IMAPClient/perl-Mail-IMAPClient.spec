%description
This module provides methods implementing the IMAP protocol to support
interacting with IMAP message stores.

The module is used by constructing or instantiating a new IMAPClient object
via the new constructor method. Once the object has been instantiated, the
connect method is either implicitly or explicitly called. At that point
methods are available that implement the IMAP client commands as specified
in *RFC3501*. When processing is complete, the logout object method should
be called.

This documentation is not meant to be a replacement for RFC3501 nor any
other IMAP related RFCs.

Note that this documentation uses the term _folder_ in place of RFC3501's
use of _mailbox_. This documentation reserves the use of the term _mailbox_
to refer to the set of folders owned by a specific IMAP id.
