    <comment>This is a new package that was split out of python-typer following upstream's split of the source distribution.

This SR will be followed with SRs for the equally split out python-typer-cli, and finally an updated python-typer that will depend on this and python-typer-cli.

I tested the upgrade path and this will not break anybody relying on the package.</comment>
