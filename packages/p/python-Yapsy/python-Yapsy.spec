%description
Yapsy is a small library implementing the core mechanisms needed to
build a plugin system into a wider application.

The main purpose is to depend only on Python's standard libraries (at
least version 2.3) and to implement only the basic functionalities
needed to detect, load and keep track of several plugins.
