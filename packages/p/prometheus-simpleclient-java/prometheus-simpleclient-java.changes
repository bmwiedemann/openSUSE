- Update to upstream version 0.16.0
  * Bugfixes:
    + Don't throw NPE if .help() wasn't called
    + Don't wrap a RuntimeException in another RuntimeException.
    + Make pushgateway module compile on Java 11
    + Make sure GZIPOutputStream is always closed for httpserver
    + Specify the charset of HTTPServer response for systems not
      using utf-8 by default
    + Use <packaging>bundle</packaging> everywhere so that
      client_java works with OSGI again.
    + use the correct name for the metric type gaugehistogram in
      OpenMetrics (previously this was wrongly named
      gauge_histogram)
    + Correct handling of HEAD requests.
    + Apply ServletConfig during Servlet initialization in
      simpleclient_servlet and simpleclient_servlet_jakarta
    + HTTPServer: Don't send a Content-Length header when
      Transfer-Encoding is chunked.
    + simpleclient_log4j set the log4j dependency scope as provided
      so that users don't accidentally pull the log4j version used
      in client_java.
      Note: This module is for monitoring log4j version 1,
      in simpleclient_log4j2 the dependency is already provided.
    + simpleclient_dropwizard set the Dropwizard dependency scope as
      provided so that users don't accidentally pull the Dropwizard
      version used in client_java.
    + Fix missing Dropwizard metrics in Vertx.
    + Fix incorrect buffer size in the Servlet exporter.
    + Fix sample name filter for the JMX metric
      jvm_memory_bytes_committed.
  * Enhancements:
    + Bump caffeine dependency to 2.7.0 to support AsyncCache.
    + Added health check api to simpleclient_httpserver.
    + Remove dependency on sun.misc.Unsafe, allowing building on
      JDK11
    + Wrap PrintWriter with BufferedWriter, making servlet
      exposition about 2x faster
    + Handle empty label values for the pushgateway
    + Add Bill of Materials
    + Count HTTP statuses returned for servlet filter
    + Introduce TestContainers integration test, for example for
      testing different Java versions. This means you need Docker
      installed to run ./mvnw verify.
    + HTTPServer: Set request/response timeouts.
    + HTTPServer: Make HTTPMetricHandler public so that it can be
      used in a custom HTTPServer.
    + New JVM memory metrics: jvm_memory_pool_collection_used_bytes,
      jvm_memory_pool_collection_committed_bytes,
      jvm_memory_pool_collection_max_bytes,
      jvm_memory_pool_collection_init_bytes,
      jvm_memory_objects_pending_finalization.
    + Version bumps (junit, jetty, maven plugins)
    + add support for Jakarta Servlet, implemented in the new
      simpleclient_servlet_jakarta module.
    + provide a way for filtering metrics by name / name prefix.
      This can be configured either in the HTTPServer, or in the
      Servlet exporter (both javax and Jakarta). For example, if
      some JMX metrics cause performance issues, this can be used
      for excluding these metrics.
    + for the Servlet filter (both javax and Jakarta): Add a
      parameter to strip the deployment path from the path label.
    + Add HTTP Authentication to the HTTPServer #682.
    + Allow passing a custom registry to the logback
      InstrumentedAppender.
    + Lots of more integration tests and tests with different Java
      versions.
    + Make HTTPMetricHandler public so that users can use them in
      their own HttpServers.
    + Make Base64 encoding in the HTTP authentication for the
      PushGateway work with all Java versions.
    + The HTTPServer can now be configured to use SSL.
    + Lots of dependency version bumps.
    + Environment variable PROMETHEUS_DISABLE_CREATED_SERIES=true
      for disabling _created metrics.
    + Support for OpenTelemetry trace sampling: Only traces that are
      sampled will be used as exemplars.
    + Handle thread IDs <= 0. Apparently Apache Zookeeper generates
      negative thread IDs, which causes issues in jmx_exporter.
    + Mark opentelemetry-api as optional to make it an optional
      dependency in OSGi.
    + Move servlet adapters to an internal package to avoid
      duplicating classes when building OSGi bundles.
    + Extend the API of the HTTPServer.Builder to allow custom
      ExecutorService instances.
    + Reduce the number of core threads in HTTPServer from 5 to 1.
      The HTTPServer will still start up to 5 threads on demand if
      there are parallel requests, but it will use only 1 thread as
      long as requests are sequential.
    + Optimize metric name sanitization: Replace the regular
      expression with a hard-coded optimized algorithm to improve
      performance.
    + Lots of dependency version bumps.
  * Changes:
    + Switch data model to OpenMetrics. Primarily this means that
      _total if present is stripped from the metric name of
      counters, and _total is now always a suffix on the sample
      value. This means that all Counter samples now have a _total
      suffix
    + The io.prometheus.client.Collector.Type enum's value UNTYPED
      renamed to UNKNOWN
  * Features:
    + Add Info and Enumeration metric types for direct
      instrumentation
    + Counter, Summary, and Histogram metrics now expose a _created
      sample with when their child was created
    + Add support for units
    + Add gauge histograms, info, stateset for custom collectors
    + Support negotiating and exposing OpenMetrics for all HTTP
      server exposition
    + Add ability to filter metrics in DropwizardExports
    + Exemplars: API for adding OpenMetrics Exemplars and
      out-of-the-box integration with OpenTelemetry tracing.
- Added patch:
  * remove_opentelemetry_tracer.patch
    + remove dependency on opentelemetry
