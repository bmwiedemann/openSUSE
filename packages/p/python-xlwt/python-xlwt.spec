%description
xlwt is a library for generating spreadsheet files that are compatible
with Excel 97/2000/XP/2003, OpenOffice.org Calc, and Gnumeric. xlwt has
full support for Unicode. Excel spreadsheets can be generated on any
platform without needing Excel or a COM server. The only requirement is
Python 2.3 to 2.6. xlwt is a fork of pyExcelerator.
