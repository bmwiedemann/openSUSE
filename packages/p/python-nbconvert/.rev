    <version>6.0.7</version>
    <time>1614373191</time>

    <comment>- Update to 6.0.7:
  - 6.0.7
    - Primarly a release addressing template extensions issues reported
      since 6.0 launched.
  - 6.0.6
    - A range of bug fixes for webpdf exports
  - 6.0.5
    - Revert networkidle2 change which caused custom cdn-fetched widgets
      in webpdf
  - 6.0.4
    - Bugfixes only
  - 6.0.3
    - Execute preprocessor no longer add illegal execution counts to
      markdown cells :ghpull:`1396`:
  - 6.0.2
    - A patch for a few minor issues raised out of the 6.0 release.
  - 6.0.1
    - A quick patch to fix an issue with get_exporter :ghpull:`1367`:
  - 6.0
    - Nbconvert 6.0 is a major release of nbconvert which includes many
      significant changes.
      - Python 2 support was dropped. Currently Python 3.6-3.8 is
        supported and tested by nbconvert. However, nbconvert 6.0
        provides limited support for Python 3.6. nbconvert 6.1 will drop
        support for Python 3.6. Limited support means we will test and
        run CI on Python 3.6.12 or higher. Issues that are found only
        affecting Python 3.6 are not guaranteed to be fixed. We
        recommend all users of nbconvert use Python 3.7 and higher.
      - Unlike previous versions, nbconvert 6.0 relies on the nbclient
        package for the execute preprocessor, which allows for
        asynchronous kernel requests.
      - template_path has become template_paths. If referring to a 5.x
        style .tpl template use the full path with the template_file
        argument to the file. On the command line the pattern is
        --template-file=&lt;path/to/file.tpl&gt;.
      - Nbconvert 6.0 includes a new &quot;webpdf&quot; exporter, which renders
        notebooks in pdf format through a headless web browser, so that
        complex outputs such as HTML tables, or even widgets are
        rendered in the same way as with the HTML exporter and a web
        browser.
      - The default template applied when exporting to HTML now produces
        the same DOM structure as JupyterLab, and is styled using
        JupyterLab's CSS. The pygments theme in use mimics JupyterLab's
        codemirror mode with the same CSS variables, so that custom
        JupyterLab themes could be applied. The classic notebook styling
        can still be enabled with
      - jupyter nbconvert --to html --template classic
      - Nbconvert 6.0 includes a new system for creating custom
        templates, which can now be installed as packages. A custom
        &quot;foobar&quot; template is installed in Jupyter's data directory under
        nbconvert/templates and has the form of a directory containing
        all resources. Templates specify their base template as well as
        other configuration parameters in a conf.json at the root of the
        template directory.
      - The &quot;slideshow&quot; template now makes use of RevealJS version 4. It
        can now be used with the HTML exporter with
      - jupyter nbconvert --to html --template reveal
      - The --to slides exporter is still supported for convenience.
      - Inkscape 1.0 is now supported, which had some breaking changes
        that prevented 5.x versions of nbconvert from converting
        documents on some systems that updated.
- Add skip_network_tests.patch to skip tests requiring network
  access (gh#jupyter/nbconvert#1526).
