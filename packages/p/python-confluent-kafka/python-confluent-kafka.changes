- update to 1.1.0:
  * confluent-kafka-python is based on librdkafka v1.1.0, see the librdkafka v1.1.0 release notes for a complete list of changes, enhancements, fixes and upgrade considerations.

  * ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=https (off by default) to validate the broker hostname matches the certificate. Requires OpenSSL >= 1.0.2(included with Wheel installations))
  * Improved GSSAPI/Kerberos ticket refresh
  * Confluent monitoring interceptor package bumped to v0.11.1 (#634)

  New configuration properties:

  * ssl.key.pem - client's private key as a string in PEM format
  * ssl.certificate.pem - client's public key as a string in PEM format
  * enable.ssl.certificate.verification - enable(default)/disable OpenSSL's builtin broker certificate verification.
  * enable.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm - to verify the broker's hostname with its certificate (disabled by default).
  * Add new rd_kafka_conf_set_ssl_cert() to pass PKCS#12, DER or PEM certs in (binary) memory form to the configuration object.
  * The private key data is now securely cleared from memory after last use.

  * SASL GSSAPI/Kerberos: Don't run kinit refresh for each broker, just per client instance.
  * SASL GSSAPI/Kerberos: Changed sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd to first attempt ticket refresh, then acquire.
  * SASL: Proper locking on broker name acquisition.
  * Consumer: max.poll.interval.ms now correctly handles blocking poll calls, allowing a longer poll timeout than the max poll interval.
  * configure: Fix libzstd static lib detection
