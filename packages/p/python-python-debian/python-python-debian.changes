- Update to 0.1.47 
  Following is the changelog for deb822 before it was merged into python-debian.
  * deb822.py:
    - Allow Deb822 objects to be initialized with a dict containing the initial
      key-value pairs.
    - _multivalued class:
      + Make all the multivalued dicts Deb822Dict objects, so the keys are
        case-preserving, but case-insensitive
    - Add a Release class, which knows about Release-file multivalued fields.
      Thanks to Alexandre Fayolle.  (Closes: 428540)
    - Deb822Dict no longer directly subclasses dict.  All of the important
      methods were already implemented with userdict.DictMixin; the dict
      subclass was so that Python would see a Deb822Dict instance as a dict
      instance.  Unfortunately, this causes confusion if you do something like
        d = dict(Deb822Dict({'foo': 'bar'})
      The "Pythonic" way to check for a dictionary interface is to check for
      the 'items' attribute.
  * test_deb822.py:
    - Add a test case for deriving a Python dict from a Deb822Dict.
  * debian/control:
    - Add a XS-Vcs-Bzr field
