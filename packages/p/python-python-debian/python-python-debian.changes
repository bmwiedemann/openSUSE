Tue Sep 30 07:56:53 UTC 2025 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

  * The 1.0.0 release of python-debian :)
  * Upload to unstable (and release to pypi).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 06:03:59 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.1.52:
  * Add build-dependency on gpgv.
  * Tweaks to match changes in Python-land tooling:
    - Fix some stylistic things that the newly uploaded pylint 2.16 complains
      about.
    - Fix testing with wine to adapt to changes in wine packaging.
    - Fix tests to work with recent changes to pip that prevent installation
      outside of a venv.
    - Change version generation to be PEP440 compatible to satisfy new
      requirements from setuptools, python-packaging etc. This change is
      needed for any uploads outside of Debian sid (derivatives, Debian
      backports, Debian security/stable-updates, etc).
  * Fix file extraction from DebFile for cases where the .deb is generated
    from control or data tarballs without the optional entry for "." and the
    "./" prefix on all members; this isn't needed for dpkg-generated packages,
    but is needed for other tools such as 'cargo deb' (Closes: #1031674).
  * Demote Recommends to Suggests; it is up to the calling code to know what
    optional features of python-debian it is using rather than dragging in an
    ever-increasing list of optional extra packages (Closes: #1029727).
  * Drop shims for pre-PEP8 API after 14 years of deprecation.
  * Replace setup.py and config for pylint, mypy, pytest with pyproject.toml.
  * Switch package build system to use pyproject.toml.
  * Relocate tests and test data out of module; they are no longer included
    in the binary package or in the wheel.
  * Relocate module source from 'lib' to 'src' in line with current practice.
  * Change handling of package version to use setuptools_scm during
    development (but not at run time).
  * Update code to build pypi uploads (sdist and wheel).
  * Update copyright statements throughout.
  * Tweak pytest configuration for pytest 8.1.1 changes.
  * Fix test suite harness that runs tests under wine.
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.7.0 (no changes required).
  * Fix handling of whitespace-separated file lists in Copyright files with
    thanks to Lasse Collin for the suggested fix (Closes: #1062437).
  * Parse source field to extract source version in .deb packages from
    binNMUs (Closes: #1082838).
  * Switch to from chardet to charset-normalizer and make it in the code
    (demoted to Suggests), with thanks to Michal Čihař for the initial work.
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.7.0 (no changes required).
  * Make 'Package-List' a multiline field for Dsc objects, thanks to Philipp
    Hahn for the patch (Closes: #1052154).
  * Use valid SPDX identified in python package metadata.
  * Fix version number to be PEP440 compliant.
  * Drop debian_bundle and top-level deb822 modules after 13 years of
    deprecation.
  * Fix typing errors from newer mypy in deb822.PkgRelation.
  * Changelog parsing speed improvements.
  * Add support for file location finding (line, col) in Deb822 files.
  * Change some type annotations from Python 2 to Python 3 format.
  * Clean up some old Python 2 methods.
  * Fixes for pylint 3.1.
- Switch to salsa tarball to run the testsuite.
- No more greedy globs in %files.

  * Make python-debian (more) portable (Closes: #1011937)
    - Tweak tests to be portable to other platforms
    - Adapt tests so that skipping optional tests can be prevented if needed
    - Add other platforms to CI to test portability
  * Switch tests to use more pytest features.
  * Updates for newer mypy and pylint.
  * Add Debian 14 'forky' to the list of known releases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 28 20:31:05 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to 0.1.48
  * Fix version bound for subscripting abc.Iterator, abc.MutableMapping
  * Don't raise AmbiguousDeb822FieldKeyError in __contains__.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  6 22:19:00 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to 0.1.47
  Following is the changelog for deb822 before it was merged into python-debian.
  * deb822.py:
    - Allow Deb822 objects to be initialized with a dict containing the initial
      key-value pairs.
    - _multivalued class:
      + Make all the multivalued dicts Deb822Dict objects, so the keys are
        case-preserving, but case-insensitive
    - Add a Release class, which knows about Release-file multivalued fields.
      Thanks to Alexandre Fayolle.  (Closes: 428540)
    - Deb822Dict no longer directly subclasses dict.  All of the important
      methods were already implemented with userdict.DictMixin; the dict
      subclass was so that Python would see a Deb822Dict instance as a dict
      instance.  Unfortunately, this causes confusion if you do something like
        d = dict(Deb822Dict({'foo': 'bar'})
      The "Pythonic" way to check for a dictionary interface is to check for
      the 'items' attribute.
  * test_deb822.py:
    - Add a test case for deriving a Python dict from a Deb822Dict.
  * debian/control:
    - Add a XS-Vcs-Bzr field
