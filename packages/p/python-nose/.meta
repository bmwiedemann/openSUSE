  <title>A unittest extension offering automatic test suite discovery</title>
  <description>nose provides an alternate test discovery and running process for unittest, one
that is intended to mimic the behavior of py.test as much as is reasonably
possible without resorting to magic. By default, nose will run tests in files
or directories under the current working directory whose names include &quot;test&quot;.

nose also supports doctest tests and may optionally provide a test coverage
report.</description>
