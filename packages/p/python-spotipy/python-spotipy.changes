-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 19 10:06:31 UTC 2022 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.19.0
  ## [2.19.0] - 2021-08-12
  ### Added
  * Added `MemoryCacheHandler`, a cache handler that simply stores the token info in memory as an instance attribute of this class.
  * If a network request returns an error status code but the response body cannot be decoded into JSON, then fall back on decoding the body into a string.
  * Added `DjangoSessionCacheHandler`, a cache handler that stores the token in the session framework provided by Django. Web apps using spotipy with Django can directly use this for cache handling.
  ### Fixed
  * Fixed a bug in `CacheFileHandler.__init__`: The documentation says that the username will be retrieved from the environment, but it wasn't.
  * Fixed a bug in the initializers for the auth managers that produced a spurious warning message if you provide a cache handler and you set a value for the "SPOTIPY_CLIENT_USERNAME" environment variable.
  * Use generated MIT license and fix license type in `pip show`
  ## [2.18.0] - 2021-04-13
  ### Added
  - Enabled using both short and long IDs for playlist_change_details
  - Added a cache handler to `SpotifyClientCredentials`
  - Added the following endpoints
      * `Spotify.current_user_saved_episodes`
      * `Spotify.current_user_saved_episodes_add`
      * `Spotify.current_user_saved_episodes_delete`
      * `Spotify.current_user_saved_episodes_contains`
      * `Spotify.available_markets`
  ### Changed
  - Add support for a list of scopes rather than just a comma separated string of scopes
  ### Fixed
  * Fixed the bugs in `SpotifyOAuth.refresh_access_token` and `SpotifyPKCE.refresh_access_token` which raised the incorrect exception upon receiving an error response from the server. This addresses #645.
  * Fixed a bug in `RequestHandler.do_GET` in which the non-existent `state` attribute of  `SpotifyOauthError` is accessed. This bug occurs when the user clicks "cancel" in the permissions dialog that opens in the browser.
  * Cleaned up the documentation for `SpotifyClientCredentials.__init__`, `SpotifyOAuth.__init__`, and `SpotifyPKCE.__init__`.
  ## [2.17.0] - 2021-02-28
  ### Changed
  - moved os.remove(session_cache_path()) inside try block to avoid TypeError on app.py example file
  - A warning will no longer be emitted when the cache file does not exist at the specified path
  - The docs for the `auth` parameter of `Spotify.init` use the term "access token" instead of "authorization token"
  - Changed docs for `search` to mention that you can provide multiple types to search for
  - The query parameters of requests are now logged
  - Deprecate specifing `cache_path` or `username` directly to `SpotifyOAuth`, `SpotifyPKCE`, and `SpotifyImplicitGrant` constructors, instead directing users to use the `CacheFileHandler` cache handler
  - Removed requirement for examples/app.py to specify port multiple times (only SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI needs to contain the port)
  ### Added
  - Added log messages for when the access and refresh tokens are retrieved and when they are refreshed
  - Support `market` optional parameter in `track`
  - Added CacheHandler abstraction to allow users to cache tokens in any way they see fit
  ### Fixed
  - Fixed Spotify.user_playlist_reorder_tracks calling Spotify.playlist_reorder_tracks with an incorrect parameter order
  - Fixed deprecated Urllib3 `Retry(method_whitelist=...)` in favor of `Retry(allowed_methods=...)`
- python-mock is not required for build

Tue Jul  7 06:56:38 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.13.0:
  * Added
   + Added `SpotifyImplicitGrant` as an auth manager option. It provides
     user authentication without a client secret but sacrifices the ability
     to refresh the token without user input. (However, read the class
     docstring for security advisory.)
   + Added built-in verification of the `state` query parameter
   + Added two new attributes: error and error_description to `SpotifyOauthError` exception class to show
   + authorization/authentication web api errors details.
   + Added `SpotifyStateError` subclass of `SpotifyOauthError`
   + Allow extending `SpotifyClientCredentials` and `SpotifyOAuth`
   + Added the market paramter to `album_tracks`
   + Added a method to update the auth token.
   + Support for shows/podcasts and episodes
   + Added CONTRIBUTING.md
  * Deprecated
   + Deprecated `util.prompt_for_user_token` in favor of `spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth())`
  * Fixed
   + Logging regression due to the addition of `logging.basicConfig()` which was unneeded.
   + Issue where using `http://localhost` as redirect_uri would cause the authorization process to hang.
   + Fixed miscellaneous issues with parsing of callback URL
   + Close session when Spotipy object is unloaded
   + Propagate refresh token error
  * Changed
   + Updated the documentation to give more details on the authorization
   + process and reflect 2020 Spotify Application jargon and practices.
   + The local webserver is only started for localhost redirect_uri which specify a port,
   + i.e. it is started for `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, not for `http://localhost`.
   + Client retry logic has changed as it now uses urllib3's `Retry` in conjunction with requests `Session`
   + The session is customizable as it allows for:
      - status_forcelist
      - retries
      - status_retries
      - backoff_factor
   + Spin up a local webserver to auto-fill authentication URL
   + Use session in SpotifyAuthBase
   + Logging used instead of print statements
- Skip one test that requires external internet access

  * Both `SpotifyClientCredentials` and `SpotifyOAuth` inherit from a common `SpotifyAuthBase` which handles common parameters and logics.
