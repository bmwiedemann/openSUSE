Tue Jul  7 06:56:38 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.13.0:
  * Added
   + Added `SpotifyImplicitGrant` as an auth manager option. It provides
     user authentication without a client secret but sacrifices the ability
     to refresh the token without user input. (However, read the class
     docstring for security advisory.)
   + Added built-in verification of the `state` query parameter
   + Added two new attributes: error and error_description to `SpotifyOauthError` exception class to show
   + authorization/authentication web api errors details.
   + Added `SpotifyStateError` subclass of `SpotifyOauthError`
   + Allow extending `SpotifyClientCredentials` and `SpotifyOAuth`
   + Added the market paramter to `album_tracks`
   + Added a method to update the auth token.
   + Support for shows/podcasts and episodes
   + Added CONTRIBUTING.md
  * Deprecated
   + Deprecated `util.prompt_for_user_token` in favor of `spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth())`
  * Fixed
   + Logging regression due to the addition of `logging.basicConfig()` which was unneeded.
   + Issue where using `http://localhost` as redirect_uri would cause the authorization process to hang.
   + Fixed miscellaneous issues with parsing of callback URL
   + Close session when Spotipy object is unloaded
   + Propagate refresh token error
  * Changed
   + Updated the documentation to give more details on the authorization
   + process and reflect 2020 Spotify Application jargon and practices.
   + The local webserver is only started for localhost redirect_uri which specify a port,
   + i.e. it is started for `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, not for `http://localhost`.
   + Client retry logic has changed as it now uses urllib3's `Retry` in conjunction with requests `Session`
   + The session is customizable as it allows for:
      - status_forcelist
      - retries
      - status_retries
      - backoff_factor
   + Spin up a local webserver to auto-fill authentication URL
   + Use session in SpotifyAuthBase
   + Logging used instead of print statements
- Skip one test that requires external internet access
