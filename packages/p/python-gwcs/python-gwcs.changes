Thu Feb 11 10:24:44 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Actually do the update to 0.16.1 m-)
- Skip schema tests not tolerating any deprecation warnings from
  numpy 1.20 -- Already fixed upstream, but patch is too
  unspecific gh#spacetelescope/gwcs#353

    reference point (crpix) of the FITS WCS. [#337]

    to_fits_sip. [#339]

    coordinates maps back to the domain of definition of the 
    forward transformation. [#322]

    a (frame, transform) tuple. Use WCS.pipeline.transform and 
    WCS.pipeline.frame to access them. [#319]
  * Fix a bug in polygon fill for zero-width bounding boxes. 
    [#293]

- Update to 0.12.0
  + New Features
    * ``gwcs.WCS`` now supports the ``world_axis_object_components`` and
      ``world_axis_object_classes`` methods of the low level WCS API as specified by
      APE 14.
    * Removed astropy-helpers from package.
    * Added a method ``fix_inputs`` which rturns an unique WCS from a compound
      WCS by fixing inputs.
    * Added two new transforms - ``ToDirectionCosines`` and ``FromDirectionCosines``.
    * Added new transforms ``WavelengthFromGratingEquation``, ``AnglesFromGratingEquation3D``.
    * ``gwcs.WCS`` now supports the new ``world_axis_names`` and
      ``pixel_axis_names`` properties on ``LowLevelWCS`` objects.
    * Update the ``StokesFrame`` to work for arrays of coordinates and integrate
      with APE 14.
    * Added ``Snell3D``, ``SellmeierGlass`` and ``SellmeierZemax`` transforms.
  + API Changes
    * Changed the initialization of ``TemporalFrame`` to be consistent with other
       coordinate frames.
  + Bug Fixes
    * Ensure that ``world_to_pixel_values`` and ``pixel_to_world_values`` always
      accept and return floats, even if the underlying transform uses units.
- Drop python2 subpackage due to dependencies dropping python2.
