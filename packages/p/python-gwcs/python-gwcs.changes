- Update to 0.24.0
  * Coordinate frames now have a "native" order and then are sorted
    based on axes_order. [#457]
  * WCS.numerical_inverse no longer accepts high level objects
    (with_units= is not supported) use WCS.inverse. [#457]
  * CoordinateFrame.coordinates has been replaced by
    CoordinateFrame.to_high_level_coordinates [#457]
  * CoordinateFrame.to_quantity has been replaced by
    CoordinateFrame.from_high_level_coordinates. [#457]

    in lon, lat order and will re sorted based on axes_order=.
    [#457]
  * Implement code linting and automatic formatting. [#544]
  * Refactor WCS to use a Pipeline base class which adds basic
    checks to ensure that the pipeline is valid. These include
    checking for duplicate frame names and that the last transform
    is None. [#545]
  * Bugfix for WCS.invert and WCS.to_fits that prevented evaluation
    when the attached bounding box happened to have units on its
    values. [#554]
- No release 0.23.0 (skipped)
  * This was skipped to avoid issues with an ongoing JWST release.
- Release 0.22.0
  *  Replace usages of copy_arrays with memmap [#503]

     box entries. [#519]
  *  Add gwcs.examples module, based on the examples located in the
     testing conftest.py. [#521]
  *  Force bounding_box to always be returned as a F ordered box.
     [#522]
  *  Move the bounding box attachment to the forward transform
     property. [#532]
  *  Adjust world_to_array_index_values to round to integer
     coordinates as specified by APE 14. [#525]
  *  Add warning filter to asdf extension to prevent the
     bounding_box order warning for gwcs objects originating from a
     file. [#526]
  *  Fixed a bug where evaluating the inverse transform did not
     respect the bounding box. [#498]
  *  Improved reliability of inside/outside footprint computations
     when evaluating inverse transform with bounding box. [#536]
