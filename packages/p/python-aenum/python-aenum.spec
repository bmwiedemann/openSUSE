Advanced Enumerations (compatible with Python's stdlib Enum),
NamedTuples, and NamedConstants

AEnum includes a Python stdlib Enum-compatible data type, as well as
a metaclass-based NamedTuple implementation and a NamedConstant
class.

An Enum is a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique,
constant values. Within an enumeration, the members can be compared
by identity, and the enumeration itself can be iterated over.  If
using Python 3 there is built-in support for unique values, multiple
values, auto-numbering, and suspension of aliasing (members with the
same value are not identical), plus the ability to have values
automatically bound to attributes.

A NamedTuple is a class-based, fixed-length tuple with a name for
each possible position accessible using attribute-access notation as
well as the standard index notation.

A NamedConstant is a class whose members cannot be rebound; it lacks
all other Enum capabilities, however; consequently, it can have
duplicate values.
