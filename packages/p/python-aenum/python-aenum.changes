- Update to 3.0.0:
  * The more esoteric method of creating Enums have been modified or removed
  * Member creation has been redone to match Python 3.10's methods.
  * enum_property() has been renamed to property() (old name still available,
    but deprecated).
  * bin() replacement shows negative integers in twos-complement
  * call __init_subclass__ after members have been added, and in Pythons < 3.6
  * call __set_name__ in Pythons < 3.6
  * do not convert/disallow private names
  * add iteration/len support to NamedConstant
  * add support to Constant to retrieve members by value
  * add pickle/deepcopy support to Constant
  * add support for Constant to use other Constant values
  * AutoNumber and auto() now work together 
- Update URL now that bitbucket is dead.

- Update to 2.2.3:
  * Various minor fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 14:51:06 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.2.1
  2.2.1
  =====
  . allow Enums to be called without a value
  . allow Enum name use while constructing Enum (Python 3.4+ only)
  2.2.0
  =====
  BREAKING CHANGE
  ---------------
  . In Python 3+ classes defined inside an Enum no longer become members by
    default; in Python 2 they still become members, but see below.
    For cross-compatibility and full control two decorators are provided:
    - @member  --> forces item to become a member
    - @nonmember  --> excludes item from becoming a member
        dark = 3
  2.1.4
  =====
  EnumMeta:
  - change __member_new__ to __new_member__ (as the stdlib enum does)
  - assign member name to enum() instances (an Enum helper for defining members)
  - handle empty iterables when using functional API
  - make auto() work with previous enum members
  - keep searching mixins until base class is found
  Enum:
  - fix bug in Flag checks (ensure it is a Flag before checking the name)
  - add multiple mixin support
  - do not allow blank names (functional API)
  - raise TypeError if _missing_* returns wrong type
  - fix __format__ to honor custom __str__
  extend_enum:
  - support stdlib Enums
  - use _generate_next_value_ if value not provided
  general:
  - standardize exception formatting
  - use getfullargspec() in Python 3 (avoids deprecation warnings)
