  <title>Python3 module to easily build and dissect network protocols</title>
  <description>Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network
protocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level
programmatic access to the packets and for some protocols (e.g.
SMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself.
Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from
raw data, and the object oriented API makes it simple to work with
deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools
as examples of what can be done within the context of this library.
