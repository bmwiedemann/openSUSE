Wed Nov 26 01:59:50 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.0.1:
  ## New Features
  * Added __all__ attribute to wrapt module to expose the public API.
  * The wrapt.PartialCallableObjectProxy class can now be accessed via the
    alias wrapt.partial, which is a convenience for users who are used to
    using functools.partial and want to use the wrapt version of it.
  * Type hints have been added to the wrapt module.
  * Added wrapt.BaseObjectProxy class which is the base class for all object
    proxy classes.
  * Added wrapt.AutoObjectProxy class which is a pure Python subclass of
    BaseObjectProxy which overrides the __new__() method to dynamically
    generate a custom subclass which includes methods for callable,
    descriptor and iterator protocols, as well as other select special
    methods.
  * Added wrapt.LazyObjectProxy class which is a variant of AutoObjectProxy
    which takes a callable which returns the object to be wrapped. The
    callable is only invoked the first time an attribute of the wrapped
    object is accessed.
  * Added wrapt.lazy_import() function which takes a module name and returns
    a LazyObjectProxy which will import the module when it is first needed.
  ## Features Changed
  * Code related to Python 2.X and workarounds for older Python 3.X versions
    has been removed.
  * Dependency at runtime on setuptools for calculating package entry points
    has been removed. Instead the importlib.metadata module is now used for
    this purpose.
  * For reasons to do with backward/forward compatibility the wrapt module
    included references to getcallargs() and formatargspec() functions which
    were part of the inspect module at one time or another. These were
    provided as convenience for users of the wrapt module, but were not
    actually part of the public API. They have now been removed from the
    wrapt module and are no longer available.
  * The enabled, adapter and proxy arguments to the @decorator decorator had
    to be keyword parameters, and the initial wrapped argument had to be
    positional only. Because though Python 2.X was still being supported it
    was not possible to use appropriate syntax to mark them as such. These
    arguments are now marked as positional and keyword only parameters in the
    function signature as appropriate.
  * The object proxy classes now raise a WrapperNotInitializedError exception
    rather than Python builtin ValueError exception when an attempt is made
    to access an attribute of the wrapped object before the wrapper has been
    initialized.
  ## Bugs Fixed
  * The wrapt.lazy_import() function wasn't included in the __all__ attribute
    of the wrapt module.
  * When using wrapt.lazy_import() to lazily import a function of a module,
    the resulting proxy object wasn't marked as callable until something
    triggered the import of the module via the proxy. This meant a callable()
    check on the proxy would return False until the module was actually
    imported.
  * Reference count was not being incremented on type object for C
    implementation of the partial callable object proxy when module was
    initialized. If wrapt was being used in Python sub interpreters which
    were deleted it could lead to the process crashing.
  * Wasn't chaining __mro_entries__() calls when the wrapped object was not a
    type (class) and itself had a __mro_entries__() method. This meant that
    if using the object proxy as a base class for a generic class, the
    generic parameters were being ignored.
  * When an object proxy wrapped an immutable type, such as an integer, and
    the object proxy had been assigned to a second variable, the result of an
    in-place operation on the second variable was also affecting the first
    variable, when instead the lifetime of the two variables should have been
    independent to reflect what occurs for normal immutable types.

Thu Oct 16 14:09:34 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.17.3
  * Added universal binary wheels for macOS. That is, contains
    both x86_64 and arm64 architectures in the same wheel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 13 02:42:47 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Switch to pyproject macros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 28 08:57:55 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.17.2
  * Added universal binary wheels for macOS. That is, contains
    both x86_64 and arm64 architectures in the same wheel.
- from version 1.17.1
  * Due to GitHub actions changes, binary wheels were missing
    for macOS Intel.
  * Not implemented error for __reduce__() on ObjectProxy was
    incorrectly displaying the error as being on __reduce_ex__().
- from version 1.17.0
  * Add __format__() method to ObjectProxy class to allow formatting
    of wrapped object.
  * Added C extension internal flag to indicate that wrapt should be
    safe for Python 3.13 free threading mode. Releases will include
    free threading variants of Python wheels. Note that as free
    threading is new, one should be cautious about using it in
    production until it has been more widely tested.
  * When a normal function or builtin function which had wrapt.decorator
    or a function wrapper applied, was assigned as a class attribute,
    and the function attribute called via the class or an instance of
    the class, an additional argument was being passed, inserted as the
    first argument, which was the class or instance. This was not the
    correct behaviour and the class or instance should not have been
    passed as the first argument.
  * When an instance of a callable class object was wrapped which didn’t
    not have a __get__() method for binding, and it was called in context
    where binding would be attempted, it would fail with error that __get__()
    did not exist when instead it should have been called directly, ignoring
    that binding was not possible.
  * The __round__ hook for the object proxy didn’t accept ndigits argument.
- Drop py313-classmethods.patch, merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 28 11:56:13 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add py313-classmethods.patch to fix test failures with py313

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 27 20:31:38 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.16.0:
  * Note that version 1.16.0 drops support for Python 2.7 and
    3.5. Python version 3.6 or later is required.
  * The ``patch_function_wrapper()`` decorator now accepts an
    ``enabled`` argument, which can be a literal boolean value,
    object that evaluates as boolean, or a callable object which
    returns a boolean. In the case of a callable, determination
    of whether the wrapper is invoked will be left until
    the point of the call. In the other cases, the wrapper will
    not be applied if the value evaluates false at the point of
    applying the wrapper.
  * The import hook loader and finder objects are now implemented
    as transparent object proxies so they properly proxy pass
    access to attributes/functions of the wrapped loader or finder.
  * Code files in the implementation have been reorganized such
    that the pure Python version of the ``ObjectProxy`` class
    is directly available even if the C extension variant is
    being used. This is to allow the pure Python variant to
    be used in exceptional cases where the C extension variant is
    not fully compatible with the pure Python implementation and the
    behaviour of the pure Python variant is what is required.
  * It was not possible to update the ``__class__`` attribute
    through the transparent object proxy when relying on the C
    implementation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 20:43:27 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.15.0:
  * When the C extension for wrapt was being used, and a property
    was used on an object proxy wrapping another object to intercept
    access to an attribute of the same name on the wrapped object,
    if the function implementing the property
    raised an exception, then the exception was ignored and not
    propagated back to the caller.
  * Address issue where the post import hook mechanism of wrapt
    wasn't transparent and left the __loader__ and __spec__.loader
    attributes of a module as the wrapt import hook loader and
    not the original loader.
  * Address issues where a thread deadlock could occur within the
    wrapt module import handler, when code executed from a post
    import hook created a new thread and code executed in the
    context of the new thread itself tried to register a post
    import hook, or imported a new module.
  * When using ``CallableObjectProxy`` as a wrapper for a type or
    function and calling the wrapped object, it was not possible
    to pass a keyword argument named ``self``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 21 12:38:55 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add sle15_python_module_pythons (jsc#PED-68)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 22:45:59 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Make calling of %{sle15modernpython} optional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  1 14:04:50 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.14.1:
  * When the post import hooks mechanism was being used, and a Python package with
    its own custom module importer was used, importing modules could fail if the
    custom module importer didn't use the latest Python import hook finder/loader
    APIs and instead used the deprecated API. This was actually occurring with the
    `zipimporter` in Python itself, which was not updated to use the newer Python
    APIs until Python 3.10.
  **Bugs Fixed**
  * Python 3.11 dropped ``inspect.formatargspec()`` which was used in creating
    signature changing decorators. Now bundling a version of this function
    which uses ``Parameter`` and ``Signature`` from ``inspect`` module when
    available. The replacement function is exposed as ``wrapt.formatargspec()``
    if need it for your own code.
  * When using a decorator on a class, ``isinstance()`` checks wouldn't previously
    work as expected and you had to manually use ``Type.__wrapped__`` to access
    the real type when doing instance checks. The ``__instancecheck__`` hook is
    now implemented such that you don't have to use ``Type.__wrapped__`` instead
    of ``Type`` as last argument to ``isinstance()``.
  * Eliminated deprecation warnings related to Python module import system, which
    would have turned into broken code in Python 3.12. This was used by the post
    import hook mechanism.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  6 18:18:03 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.13.3:
  * Adds wheels for Python 3.10 on PyPi and where possible also now
   generating binary wheels for ``musllinux``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 26 21:13:04 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.13.2:
  * Note that the next signficant release of `wrapt` will drop support for
    Python 2.7 and Python 3.5.
  * Fix Python version constraint so PyPi classifier for ``pip`` requires
    Python 2.7 or Python 3.5+.
  * When a reference to a class method was taken out of a class, and then
    wrapped in a function wrapper, and called, the class type was not being
    passed as the instance argument, but as the first argument in args,
    with the instance being ``None``. The class type should have been passed
    as the instance argument.
  * If supplying an adapter function for a signature changing decorator
    using input in the form of a function argument specification, name lookup
    exceptions would occur where the adaptor function had annotations which
    referenced non builtin Python types. Although the issues have been
    addressed where using input data in the format usually returned by
    ``inspect.getfullargspec()`` to pass the function argument specification,
    you can still have problems when supplying a function signature as
    string. In the latter case only Python builtin types can be referenced
    in annotations.
  * When a decorator was applied on top of a data/non-data descriptor in a
    class definition, the call to the special method ``__set_name__()`` to
    notify the descriptor of the variable name was not being propogated. Note
    that this issue has been addressed in the ``FunctionWrapper`` used by
    ``@wrapt.decorator`` but has not been applied to the generic
    ``ObjectProxy`` class. If using ``ObjectProxy`` directly to construct a
    custom wrapper which is applied to a descriptor, you will need to
    propogate the ``__set_name__()`` call yourself if required.
  * The ``issubclass()`` builtin method would give incorrect results when used
    with a class which had a decorator applied to it. Note that this has only
    been able to be fixed for Python 3.7+. Also, due to what is arguably a
    bug (https://bugs.python.org/issue44847) in the Python standard library,
    you will still have problems when the class heirarchy uses a base class
    which has the ``abc.ABCMeta`` metaclass. In this later case an exception
    will be raised of ``TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class``.

Mon Mar 16 11:01:55 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.12.1:
  * Applying a function wrapper to a static method of a class using the
  ``wrap_function_wrapper()`` function, or wrapper for the same, wasn't
  being done correctly when the static method was the immediate child of
  the target object. It was working when the name path had multiple name
  components. A failure would subsequently occur when the static method
  was called via an instance of the class, rather than the class.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  9 16:25:43 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.12.0:
  * Provided that you only want to support Python 3.7, when deriving from
    a base class which has a decorator applied to it, you no longer need
    to access the true type of the base class using ``__wrapped__`` in
    the inherited class list of the derived class.
  * When using the ``synchronized`` decorator on instance methods of a
    class, if the class declared special methods to override the result for
    when the class instance was tested as a boolean so that it returned
    ``False`` all the time, the synchronized method would fail when called.
  * When using an adapter function to change the signature of the decorated
    function, ``inspect.signature()`` was returning the wrong signature
    when an instance method was inspected by accessing the method via the
    class type.
