  <title>Test your SYNOPSIS code</title>
  <description>Test::Synopsis is an (author) test module to find .pm or .pod files under
your _lib_ directory and then make sure the example snippet code in your
_SYNOPSIS_ section passes the perl compile check.

Note that this module only checks the perl syntax (by wrapping the code
with 'sub') and doesn't actually run the code.

Suppose you have the following POD in your module.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Awesome::Template - My awesome template
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
    use Awesome::Template;
    
    my $template = Awesome::Template-&gt;new;
    $tempalte-&gt;render(&quot;template.at&quot;);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION

An user of your module would try copy-paste this synopsis code and find
that this code doesn't compile because there's a typo in your variable name
_$tempalte_. Test::Synopsis will catch that error before you ship it.</description>
