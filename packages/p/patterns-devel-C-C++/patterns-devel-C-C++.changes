- Add gcc-c++ as a hard requirement to not rely only on the
  devel_basis Pattern where it only recommends gcc-c++. This is to
  ensure that users that disable recommended package installation
  in Zypper's configuration file or pass the --no-recommended
  option flag to the Zypper command won't ironically end up without
  a C++ compiler.
- Add libstdc++-devel as a hard requirement for the same reason as
  gcc-c++ above, to ensure it gets installed.
- Drop no longer needed BuildRoot tag due to its deprecation.
- Replace $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/share/doc/packages with %{buildroot}\
  %{_defaultdocdir}, in the files section, following our best
  practices.
- Build package as a "noarch" since it doesn't contain anything
  architecture-specific.

- Remove ddd as it didn't have release in last 10 years and thus
