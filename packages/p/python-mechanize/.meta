  <title>Stateful programmatic web browsing</title>
  <description>Stateful programmatic web browsing, after Andy Lester's Perl module
WWW::Mechanize.

The library is layered: mechanize.Browser (stateful web browser),
mechanize.UserAgent (configurable URL opener), plus urllib2 handlers.

Features include: ftp:, http: and file: URL schemes, browser history,
high-level hyperlink and HTML form support, HTTP cookies, HTTP-EQUIV and
Refresh, Referer [sic] header, robots.txt, redirections, proxies, and Basic and
Digest HTTP authentication. mechanize's response objects are (lazily-)
.seek()able and still work after .close().

Much of the code originally derived from Perl code by Gisle Aas (libwww-perl),
Johnny Lee (MSIE Cookie support) and last but not least Andy Lester
(WWW::Mechanize). urllib2 was written by Jeremy Hylton.</description>
