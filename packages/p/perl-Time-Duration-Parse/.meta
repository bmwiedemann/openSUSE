  <title>Parse string that represents time duration</title>
  <description>Time::Duration::Parse is a module to parse human readable duration strings
like _2 minutes and 3 seconds_ to seconds.

It does the opposite of _duration_exact_ function in Time::Duration and is
roundtrip safe. So, the following is always true.

  use Time::Duration::Parse;
  use Time::Duration;

  my $seconds = int rand 100000;
  is( parse_duration(duration_exact($seconds)), $seconds );</description>
