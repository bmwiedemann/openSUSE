  <title>Reusable tests for POE::Loop authors</title>
  <description>
    POE::Test::Loops contains one function, generate(), which will generate all
    the loop tests for one or more POE::Loop subclasses.

    The &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; example is a version of poe-gen-tests, which is a
    stand-alone utility to generate the actual tests. poe-gen-tests also
    documents the POE::Test::Loops system in more detail.
