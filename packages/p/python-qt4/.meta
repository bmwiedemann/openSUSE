  <title>PyQt - python bindings for Qt 4</title>
  <description>PyQt is a set of Python bindings for Trolltech's Qt application
framework and runs on all platforms supported by Qt including Windows,
MacOS/X and Linux. There are two sets of bindings: PyQt v4 supports Qt
v4; and the older PyQt v3 supports Qt v3 and earlier. The bindings are
implemented as a set of Python modules and contain over 300 classes and
nearly 6,000 functions and methods.</description>
