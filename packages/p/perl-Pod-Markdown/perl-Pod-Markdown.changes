    - Allow local_module_url_prefix to be '' [rt-129865].
    - URI Escape the module name in external pod links
      (introduces dependency on URI::Escape).

  3.003     2015-09-28T00:29:45Z
  
    - Bump Pod::Simple prereq to fix bugs that were causing test failures.
    - Use Pod::Simple's nbsp_for_S(1) by default instead of handling S<> sequences internally.
      This means the feature can now also be disabled if desired.
    - Portability improvements for non-ascii platforms.

    - Add attribution to changelog.
  
  3.001     2015-08-21T03:17:57Z
  
    - Increase Pod::Simple requirement to 3.26 for detected_encoding().
      Thanks to Lee J for reporting! (gh-15).
  
  3.000     2015-08-16T21:55:14Z
  
    [Bug Fixes]
    - Literal ampersands and left angle brackets are encoded as html entities
      when necessary to avoid interpretation as html.
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28496298/escape-angle-brackets-using-podmarkdown
  
    [API Changes]
    - Make accessors read/write (instead of read-only)
      for consistency with Pod::Simple classes.
    - Passing unknown arguments to the constructor now produces a warning
      and in the future may throw an error.
    - For consistency with the other html-entity changes, NBSP characters (U+00A0)
      are now used literally for S<> sequences.
      This also fixes a bug with code spans nested inside of S<> sequences.
  
    [New Attributes]
    - Add `html_encode_chars` attribute to allow customizing what characters
      should be html entity encoded.
    - Add `match_encoding` attribute to use the same encoding as the input pod
      when writing to the output handle.
    - Add `output_encoding` attribute to specify the desired encoding
      to apply to the output handle.
  
    [pod2markdown script]
    - Add command line options corresponding to new module attributes.
    - The script now defaults to UTF-8 encoding if no encoding options are specified.
      Previous versions did not produce consistent output and would sometimes emit warnings.
      Closes gh-14 and rt-101536.
  
    [Documentation]
    - Remove documentation for deprecated API
      (parse_from_file(), parse_from_filehandle(), and as_markdown())
      to further discourage use.
  
    [New Packages]
    - Added Pod::Perldoc::ToMarkdown to enable `perldoc -o Markdown ...`
      Pod::Markdown maintains a backward compatible interface that is incompatible
      with perldoc's `-o` so this module has been added to enable the functionality.
      Thanks to Alberto Simões for investigating (gh-12) and providing some code to fix it (gh-13).

  2.002     2014-07-05T15:20:40Z
  
    - Docs: Add example of command line usage to Synopsis.
      Thanks, Cindy Wang!
  
  2.001     2014-04-20T02:40:11Z
  
    - Use double-asterisk instead of double-underscore for bold Markdown.
      This allows bold and italic to be nested without confusing parsers.
      Thanks to Mike Covington for the great pull request (gh-9)!
  
  2.000     2014-02-01T14:38:27Z
  
    - Releasing previous (1.99[01]) as stable
      (now uses Pod::Simple instead of Pod::Parser).
      See below for changes.
  
  1.991-TRIAL 2014-01-03T04:07:49Z
  
    [Test Fixes]
    - Ignore worthless testing of empty links that fail with Pod::Simple 3.16.
  
  1.990-TRIAL 2014-01-02T14:13:40Z
  
    [Enhancements]
    - Change backend from Pod::Parser to Pod::Simple.
      Previous documented API has been ported
      however the Pod::Simple API should be preferred for new code.
    - Improve escaping of markdown characters.
    - Accept for/begin 'markdown' and 'html' regions by default.
    - Represent over/back regions without items as blockquotes.
  
    [Backward Incompatible Changes]
    - E<> codes used to produce equivalent html entities (&foo;).
      These now simply print the corresponding unicode character as utf-8.
      If you desire alternate behavior please report a bug.
    - Tabs are now expanded.
  
  1.500     2013-11-22T15:05:31Z
  
      - Format url fragments (in links to perldoc sections)
        according to the destination site (perldoc_url_prefix).
        This makes links to sections work where they probably never did before.
        They are also customizable.
  
      - Use multiple backticks to delimit code spans
        that contain literal backticks.
  
  1.401     2013-11-06T05:30:55Z
  
      - Require Pod::Parser 1.51 for bug fixes.
  
  1.400     2013-11-05T14:18:19Z
  
      [Output Changes]
      - Change perldoc urls to point to metacpan.
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      - Recognize numbered pod items that do not have a period.
        Thanks to Yasutaka ATARASHI for the pull request (gh-4).
      - Remove extraneous blank line between verbatim paragraphs.
        Thanks to Graham Ollis for the pull request (gh-5).
      - Do not escape markdown characters inside links (or file paths).
        Thanks to Taiki Kawakami for the pull request (gh-6).
  
  1.322     2012-11-17T15:51:36Z
  
      - Fix incorrect escaping of characters
        that are inside inline code blocks in headers.
        Thanks to Peter Vereshagin for the pull req (gh-3).
  
  1.321     2012-10-27T01:23:56Z
  
      - Improved list handling including support for ordered (numbered)
        and nested lists.
        Thanks to Yasutaka ATARASHI for the pull req (gh-2).
  
  1.320     2012-04-30T23:30:11Z
  
      - End markdown output with a newline to be more consistent with...
        everything.  If this causes a problem for you please report it.
  
      - Enable pod2markdown to accept file paths as arguments
        (for both input and output (defaulting to STDIN/STDOUT)).
        Thanks to Mike Doherty for the suggestion [rt-76726].
  
  1.301     2012-04-25T03:56:11Z
  
      - Fix double-interpolation of list headings
        which caused escaping of the markdown characters.
        Thanks to motemen for the pull request (gh-1).
  
      - Add TODO tests for improving list handling.
  
  1.300000  2012-04-08T00:08:25Z
  
      - Document that characters in varbatim paragraphs and code sections
        are not escaped.
      - Bump release number to demonstrate major formatting difference
        of last change (backslash-escaped characters).
        (Forgot to do it last time.)
  
  1.200001  2012-04-07T23:16:23Z
  
      - Escape characters that are special to Markdown
        (but normal in Pod) with backslashes.
        Thanks to Florian (fschlich at zedat dot fu-berlin dot de)
        for the initial patch (rt-75620).
  
  1.200000  2011-11-28T17:57:01Z
      [Enhancements]
      - Handle POD formatting codes embedded in links
      - Render Z<> and X<> as blank strings
      - Handle numeric (hex, octal, and decimal) E<> escapes
      - Convert spaces in S<> to &nbsp;
  
      [Format Changes]
      - S<> no longer produces backticks (code sections).
        This is consistent with perlpod and perlpodspec.
        Use something like S<C<$x + $y>> if you intend it to be treated as code.
      - Author meta tag with no title meta tag does not produce a leading newline.
        This was considered a bug.
  
      [Tests]
      - More tests, increased coverage
  
  1.120001  2011-11-27T04:07:30Z
      [Prereqs]
      - Require version 1.10 of Pod::ParseLink (core in perl 5.12)
        to handle alt text with schemes/absolute URLs.
        This can be changed from "requires" to "recommends" if it poses a problem.
  
      [Test Fix]
      - Skip tests (rather than fail) for alt text with absolute url
        if Pod::ParseLink < 1.10
  
  1.120000  2011-11-19T05:44:51Z
      [Enhancements]
      - Use Pod::ParseLink to dramatically improve (and simplify) link parsing
        (including sections, alternate text, and man pages).
  
      [Format Change]
      - NOTE: L</foo> now becomes ["foo"](#foo) instead of [foo](#pod_foo).
        This is consistent with perldoc, perlpodspec, and Pod::Simple::(X)HTML
        which is used for metacpan.org and search.cpan.org.
        No '#pod_' id/name attributes were ever generated so the links
        probably weren't very useful (and probably still aren't).
        If this change presents a problem please report it.
  
  1.110732  2011-11-18T04:06:06Z
      - Change /\h/ to /[ 	]/ for compatibility with older perls.
        Thanks to David Golden for reporting [rt-71961]
  
  1.110731  2011-11-18T03:28:34Z
      - Ensure verbatim pod becomes verbatim markdown
        by increasing indentation if necessary [rt-72414]
      - Co-maintainership granted to RWSTAUNER
