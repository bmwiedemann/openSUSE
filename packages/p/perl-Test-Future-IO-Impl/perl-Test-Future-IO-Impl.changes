  0.17    2026-01-18
          [CHANGES]
           * Added tests for `poll` method

          [BUGFIXES]
           * Account for the fact that read or write IO operations may have
             already happened before they are cancelled
           * Clear the EAGAIN error from `$wr` filehandle in EAGAIN write test
             to stop perl writing annoying warnings during test

  0.16    2026-01-07
          [BUGFIXES]
           * Be less sensitive to `->send` failure in peer-closed case, as OS
             behaviour differs here
           * sleep() unconditionally after closing listening server in connect
             test, as most OSes need it. 100msec is sufficient
