%description
The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Tools gvm-tools are a collection
of tools that help with remote controlling a Greenbone Security Manager
(GSM) appliance and its underlying Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM).
The tools aid in accessing the communication protocols GMP (Greenbone
Management Protocol) and OSP (Open Scanner Protocol).

This module is comprised of interactive and non-interactive clients.
The programming language Python is supported directly for interactive
scripting. But it is also possible to issue remote GMP/OSP commands
without programming in Python.
