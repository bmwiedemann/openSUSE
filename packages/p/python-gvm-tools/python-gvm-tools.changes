- Update to version 20.10.1
  Changed
  * Fixed send-schedule.gmp.py script, because <timezone_abbrev>
    has been removed from Schedules, using instead.
  * Fixed send-targets.gmp.py script, because alive_test needs to
    be from AliveTest enum in create_target function.
  * Added gmpv20.08 support to the scan-new-system.gmp.py script,
    as create_target requires an argument port_range or
    port_list_id now.
  * Using the --log argument is not casesensitive anymore. Use the
    lower-case or upper-case loglevel as the argument now.
  Fixed
  * Fixed the check-gmp.gmp.py script, as it was not compatible to
    Python 3.5 anymore.
  * Fixed the check-gmp.gmp.py script: results have not been
    loaded with -F host -T task --status and probably some other
    cases. Added details=True to the command that requests the
    report.
  * Fixed the pdf-report.gmp.py script. Joining the Content of the
    tag was not the correct way here ... we needed the tail of the
    <report_format> tag ...
  Removed
  * Removed gvm.version module in favor of using pontos.version
- Temporary disable source verification (upstream messed it up)
