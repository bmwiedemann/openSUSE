      [Possible breakage]
      Removed Perl::Critic::Utils::DataConversion. Any add-on policies that used

      ProhibitCascadingIfElse no longer suggests using given/when.
      [Internals]
      We no longer require Test::Deep for testing.
      Test::Kwalitee is now only recommended, not required.
      Random microoptimizations, like using hashes for array contents checking,
      and using any() instead of calling grep as a boolean.

      postfix dereference syntax and does not report a policy violation.
      Thanks to Ilya Rassadin (GH #578)
      Added Test::Class::Moose and MooseX::MethodAttributes::Role to the
      list of modules that are equivalent to "use strict".  (GH #808, GH #886)

      Thanks, James Raspass. (GH #905)
      RequireArgUnpacking now allows a closure to be recognized as a way that
      subroutine arguments can be unpacked.  This is specified with an optional
      allow_closures configuration option.  Thanks, Tom Wyant. (GH #737)
      ProhibitTwoArgOpen now disallows one-arg opens as well. Also, it
      no longer allows two-arg opening of STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR.  Thanks,
      Dan Book. (GH #652, #653)

      RequireCheckingReturnValueOfEval didn't count returning the result of an

      [New Features]
      Added the ability to specify a regex to tell what unused private
      subroutines are OK in Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines.
      This is handy for Moose classes where there could be many false
      positives on _build_xxxx() subroutines.

      [Bug Fixes]
      * PPI misparsing a module caused an incorrect "Must end with a

        1.224. (GH #696, GH #607)
      * A test would fail under the upcoming Perl 5.26 that omits the current

      [Dependencies]
      Perl::Critic now requires PPI 1.224.  PPI is the underlying Perl parser

      * Fixes for dot-in-@INC.
      * Parse left side of => as bareword even if it looks like a keyword or op.
      * $::x now works.
      * Higher accuracy when deciding whether certain characters are operators or
        variable type casts (*&% etc.).
      * Subroutine attributes parsed correctly.
  
      [Performance Enhancements]
      * Sped up BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitUselessTopic ~7%.  Thanks, James
        Raspass. (GH #656)

        use particular modules with 'skip_when_using' option allows of, for
        example, skipping the policy for roles.  Thanks to Mark Fowler.
  
      * The RequireUseStrict and RequireUseWarnings policies now regard Moose,
        Moo, Mouse, Dancer, Mojolicious, and several other modules as equivalent
        to the strict and warnings pragma.
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      * The RequireChecked* family of policies has been fixed to accommodate
        version numbers when use-ing the autodie pragma. GH #612. Thanks citrin.
  
  1.123 2014-11-11
  
      [Dependencies]
      * Now requires PPI-1.220 which has numerous bug fixes. This may 
        eliminate the need for some "## no critic" markers you inserted to
        work around those bugs. The "ProhibitUselessNoCritic" policy should
        help you find them.
  
      [Miscellanea]
      * Fixed a typo in the Variables::ProhibitPerl4PackageNames message.

     [Dependencies]
     * Now requires PPI-1.218 which has numerous enahncements and bug fixes.
       Also now requires Readonly-2.00, which obviates the need for Readonly::XS
       to get fast constants.
 
     * File::HomeDir, File::Which, and Term::ANSIColor are all required now
       instead of being optional or recommended. This simplifies our test code
       and ensures consistent optimal behavior for all users.
 
     [New Policies]
     * Added two new policies: BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitUselessTopic and
       RegularExpressions::ProhibitUselessTopic.
 
     [Miscellanea]

  * ControlStructures::ProhibitMutatingListFunctions now understands that
    '//=', '<<=', and '>>=' are assignment operators. RT #70901.
  * ErrorHandling::RequireCheckingReturnValueOfEval now allows things
    like grep { eval $_ }. RT #69489.
  * Modules::RequireExplicitPackage now has configuraion option
    allow_import_of, to allow the import of specified modules before
    the package statement. RT #72660.
  * RegularExpressions::ProhibitEnumeratedClasses no longer thinks
    that [A-Za-z_] matches \w. RT #69322.
  * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCaptures now skips the first
    block of an 'if' or 'elsif' if the regular expression is bound to
    its operand with the '!~' operator. RT #69867.
  * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCaptures now looks into lists
    and blocks in the replacement portion of the regular expression if
    /e is asserted. RT #72086.
  * RegularExpressions::RequireDotMatchAnything,
    RegularExpressions::RequireExtendedFormatting and
    RegularExpressions::RequireLineBoundaryMatching now honor defaults
    set with 'use re "/modifiers"'. RT #72151.
  * Subroutines::ProhibitManyArgs now recognizes '+' as a prototype
    character.
  * Variables::ProhibitPunctuationVars now recognizes bracketed
    variables embedded in interpolated strings (e.g. "${$}"). For the
    purpose of the 'allow' configuration, these are considered
    equivalent to the unbracketed form. RT #72910.
  Other Changes:
  * Corrected POD in Perl::Critic::PPI::Utils. RT #68898.
  * Perl::Critic::Violation source() method now returns the line
    containing the violation (not the first line) when the statement
    containing the violation spans multiple lines.

Mon Dec 19 15:03:28 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.de

- update to 1.116
    Policy Changes:
    * BuiltInFunctions::ProhibitLvalueSubstr does not report violations
      if the document contains an explicit 'use n.nnn;' where the
      version is before 5.005.  RT #59112
    * Documentation::RequirePodSections no longer blows up on code
      having POD but no =head1. This problem was introduced with RT
      #59268. RT #67231
    * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture should more reliably
      find things like s/(a)/${1}2/.  RT #67273.
    * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers and
      Module::RequireVersionVar now treat versions passed as the second
      argument of a 'package' statement the same as versions declared as
      'our $VERSION ...'.  RT #67159
    * Variables::RequireLexicalLoopIterators does not report violations
      if the document contains an explicit 'use n.nnn;' where the
      version is before 5.004.  RT #67760

- update to 1.115
   * Fatal error in RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture here
     document check.  RT #67116.
   * Internal POD error in Documentation::RequirePodLinksIncludeText.  Patch
     by Salvatore Bonaccorso.  RT #67012

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 31 18:26:47 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- update to 1.114
    Policy Changes:
    * Documentation::RequirePodLinksIncludeText now handles nested POD
      formatting. RT #65569
    * Clarified relation of severity numbers to names in Perl::Critic
      POD. RT #66017
    * Removed caveats from Variables::RequireLocalizedPunctuationVars,
      no longer necessary with PPI 1.208. RT #65514
    * Have InputOutput::RequireBriefOpen attempt to expand scope as
      necessary to deal with the case where the open() and the
      corresponding close() are not in the same scope. RT #64437
    * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture now looks inside
      double-quotish things. RT #38942.
    * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture now takes logical
      alternation into account, so that (e.g.)
          if ( /(a)/ || /(b)/ ) {
              say $1;
          }
      is not a violation. RT #38942.
    * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitCommaSeparatedStatements now
      recognizes 'return { foo => 1, bar => 2 }' as containing a hash
      constructor, not a block. This was fixed by PPI 1.215. RT #61301.
    * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitCommaSeparatedStatements now
      recognizes 'bless { foo => 1, bar => 2 }' as containing a hash
      constructor, not a block. This was fixed by PPI 1.215. RT #64132.
