  1.144 Mon Dec  5 09:44:04 PM CST 2022
      Perl::Critic now requires Perl 5.10.1.
      [New features]
      The ProhibitAugmentedAssignmentInDeclaration policy now allows augmented
      assignments to "our" variables, if the allow_our option is enabled.
      Thanks, Graham Knop. (GH #993)
      ProhibitExplicitISA now recommends "use parent" instead of "use base".
      (GH #987)
      RequireUseWarnings now recognizes that "use v5.36" implies warnings.
      Thanks, Andrew Grechkin. (GH #984)
      Subroutines::ProhibitNestedSubs now allows lexical subroutines can
      now be inside of other subroutines. Thanks, TOYAMA Nao. (GH #946,
      #971, #972)
      RequireUseStrict now knows that Test::Spec enables it. (GH #906)
      ProhibitUnusedCapture now understands @{^CAPTURE} and %{^CAPTURE_ALL} that
      were added in Perl 5.26.0. Thanks, Tom Wyant. (GH #778)
      Allow numeric operators on special number strings 'NaN' and 'inf'. Thanks,
      Omer Gazit. (GH #803)
      [Fixes]
      Miscellanea::ProhibitUselessNoCritic no longer filters out errors about
      itself, just as Miscellanea::ProhibitUnrestrictedNoCritic cannot. Thanks,
      Bernhard Schmalhofer. (GH #939)
      Fixed GH #878: bareword filehandle dies on `open(CHECK, '/foo');`. Thanks,
      Tom Wyant.
      [Internals]
      Updated to using Perl 5.10.1. Starting migrating to Perl 5.10-isms like
      defined-or. Thanks, James Raspass.
      [Documentation]
      Updated some outdated docs in Perl::Critic::Utils. Thanks, Slaven Rezić.
      (GH #951)
  1.142 Mon Nov 28 08:12:14 PM CST 2022
      This is the last version of Perl::Critic that will run on Perl 5.6.1.  The
      next release will require Perl 5.10.1.
      [New Features]
      Add new policy InputOutput::ProhibitBarewordDirHandles, comparable to
      ProhibitBarewordFilehanles.  Thanks, raf. (GH #912)
      References::ProhibitDoubleSigils policy now allows for Perl's
      postfix dereference syntax and does not report a policy violation.
      Thanks to Ilya Rassadin (GH #578)
      Added Test::Class::Moose and MooseX::MethodAttributes::Role to the
      list of modules that are equivalent to "use strict".  (GH #808, GH #886)
      Subroutines::RequireArgUnpacking now detects anonymous subroutines with
      attributes, prototypes or signatures.  Thanks, Tom Wyant. (GH #684)
      ProhibitVoidMap and ProhibitVoidGrep now detect void context inside subs,
      such as:
          sub { map { foo($_) } @list; return }
      Thanks, James Raspass. (GH #905)
      RequireArgUnpacking now allows a closure to be recognized as a way that
      subroutine arguments can be unpacked.  This is specified with an optional
      allow_closures configuration option.  Thanks, Tom Wyant. (GH #737)
      ProhibitTwoArgOpen now disallows one-arg opens as well. Also, it
      no longer allows two-arg opening of STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR.  Thanks,
      Dan Book. (GH #652, #653)
      [Fixes]
      ProhibitLeadingZeros would not handle sysopen and lexical variables
      correctly. This has been fixed. Thanks, Tom Wyant. (GH #789)
      [Documentation]
      We note that the any() function is available in both List::MoreUtils and
      List::SomeUtils.
      Added instructions to perlcritic on how to integrate with Visual Studio
      Code.  Thanks, sigzero.
      [Internals]
      Switch to using List::SomeUtils instead of List::MoreUtils.

Thu Oct  6 05:42:24 UTC 2022 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

- Add 3 more Pod::* requires to make it build (and reverse dependencies).
  Not sure where they were hidden before, but now they are required

  1.140 Tue Mar 23 21:42:19 CDT 2021
      [New Features]
      Subroutines::RequireFinalReturn now lets you specify a
      terminal_methods parameter to specify methods that should been as
      terminal.  This is like the terminal_funcs parameter, but for methods.
      Thanks, Robin Smidsrød and Mike Bruins. (GH #920)
  1.139_01 Tue Sep  1 23:52:18 CDT 2020
      [Fixes]
      Removed an extra /x in RequireInterpolationOfMetachars.pm that caused
      deprecation warnings in Perl 5.22 and higher.  (GH #822)
      Documentation::RequirePackageMatchesPodName now recognizes the package
      name if it's in C<< I<> >> or C<< B<> >> markup.  Thanks, Renée Bäcker.

  1.137_01 Thu Jan 23 16:44:57 CST 2020
  
      [Fixes]
      RequireCheckingReturnValueOfEval didn't count returning the result of an
      eval as checking it.  Now it does.  However, it's only if you "return eval
      { ... }".  It still doesn't handle the case of "return ( eval {} )".
      Thanks, Tom Wyant. (GH #324)
  
      ProhibitPunctuationVars would get confused and think that the expression
      qr/SOME$/ was using the $/ special variable.  Thanks, Tom Wyan. (GH #843)

  1.32    Thu May 31 21:48:48 CDT 2018
      [New Features]
      Added the ability to specify a regex to tell what unused private
      subroutines are OK in Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines.
      This is handy for Moose classes where there could be many false
      positives on _build_xxxx() subroutines.
      Thanks, Dave Cross.  (GH #811, #812)
  
      [Dependencies]
      Perl::Critic now no longer relies on the deprecated Email::Address.

  1.131_02 Tue Feb 20 17:18:03 CST 2018
      [New Features]
      Perl::Critic now assumes that .psgi files are Perl, too.  Thanks, Tom
      Hukins. (GH#805)
  
      Variables::ProhibitUnusedVariables no longer gives a false positive for
      variables used in interpolation.  Thanks, Omer Gazit. (GH#801)
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      Added missing requirement for Fatal.pm.
  
  
  1.131_01 Tue Nov 21 17:28:06 CST 2017
      [New Features]
      In the ProhibitLeadingZeros policy, added an exception for mkfifo.
      Thanks, Evan Zacks. (GH#786)
  
      Add color support for Windows platforms.  Thanks, Roy Ivy III. (GH#700)
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      Recode Perl::Critic::Utils::all_perl_files() to use File::Find instead
      of opendir/readdir.  This solves endless directory traversals if
      the directories contain circular symbolic references.  Thanks, Tom Wyant.
  
      [Documentation]
      Added CONTRIBUTING.md.  Thanks, Jonas B. Nielsen.

      * Policies which ensure that system calls are checked such as
        RequireCheckedSystemCalls now have an "autodie_modules" setting which
        allows you to tell the policy about other modules which export
        autodie. Fixes #699. PR #747. Thanks to Dave Rolsky.

  Developer release leading up to 1.128.
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      * PPI misparsing a module caused an incorrect "Must end with a
        recognizable true value."  This is fixed by upgrading to PPI
        1.224. (GH #696, GH #607)
      * A test would fail under the upcoming Perl 5.26 that omits the current
        directory from @INC.  Thanks, Kent Fredric.
      * Fixed an invalid test in the RequireBarewordsIncludes test.  Thanks,
        Christian Walde. (GH #751)
      * If an element contained blank lines then the source "%r" displayed
        for a violation was wrong. Thanks, Sawyer X. (GH #702, #734)
  
      [Dependencies]
      Perl::Critic now requires PPI 1.224.  PPI is the underlying Perl parser
      on which Perl::Critic is built, and 1.224 introduces many parsing fixes
      such as:
      * Fixes for dot-in-@INC.
      * Parse left side of => as bareword even if it looks like a keyword or op.
      * $::x now works.
      * Higher accuracy when deciding whether certain characters are operators or
        variable type casts (*&% etc.).
      * Subroutine attributes parsed correctly.
  
      [Performance Enhancements]
      * Sped up BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitUselessTopic ~7%.  Thanks, James
        Raspass. (GH #656)
  
      [Documentation]
      * Fixed incorrect explanation of capture variables in
        ProhibitCaptureWithoutTest.  Thanks, Felipe Gasper.
      * Fixed incorrect links. Thanks, Glenn Fowler.

      * Fixed invalid POD.  Thanks, Jakub Wilk. (GH #735)
      * Updated docs on ProhibitYadaOperator.  Thanks, Stuart A Johnston. (GH #662)
      * Removed all the references to the old mailing list and code repository
        at tigris.org.  (GH #757)

      [Bug Fixes]
      * Fixed problems arising from having -b in your .perltidyrc file. Thanks
        @hjkatz.
      * Removed extra newline from policy names returned by P::C::Config->policies.
        Thanks @ratsbane.
      * `fc` and `say` are now covered by ProhibitUselessTopic. Thanks @JRaspass.

      * Revised and updated documentation.
  
  1.124 2015-02-27
  
      [Policy Changes]
      * The ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines policy can now ignore files that
        use particular modules with 'skip_when_using' option allows of, for
        example, skipping the policy for roles.  Thanks to Mark Fowler.
  
      * The RequireUseStrict and RequireUseWarnings policies now regard Moose,
        Moo, Mouse, Dancer, Mojolicious, and several other modules as equivalent
        to the strict and warnings pragma.
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      * The RequireChecked* family of policies has been fixed to accommodate
        version numbers when use-ing the autodie pragma. GH #612. Thanks citrin.
  
  1.123 2014-11-11
  
      [Dependencies]
      * Now requires PPI-1.220 which has numerous bug fixes. This may 
        eliminate the need for some "## no critic" markers you inserted to
        work around those bugs. The "ProhibitUselessNoCritic" policy should
        help you find them.
  
      [Miscellanea]
      * Fixed a typo in the Variables::ProhibitPerl4PackageNames message.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 15 15:15:20 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.122
 
     [Dependencies]
     * Now requires PPI-1.218 which has numerous enahncements and bug fixes.
       Also now requires Readonly-2.00, which obviates the need for Readonly::XS
       to get fast constants.
 
     * File::HomeDir, File::Which, and Term::ANSIColor are all required now
       instead of being optional or recommended. This simplifies our test code
       and ensures consistent optimal behavior for all users.
 
     [New Policies]
     * Added two new policies: BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitUselessTopic and
       RegularExpressions::ProhibitUselessTopic.
 
     [Miscellanea]
     * Updated the perlcritic.el script to use modern Emacs hooks.
       Thanks to @intrigeri and the Debian team for the patch.  Fixes GH #556.
 
     * Removed all the internal RCS keyword boilerplate blocks that were never
       getting expanded.

    * Miscellanea::RequireRcsKeywords has been moved to the Perl-Critic-More
      distribution,  RT #69546

    Other Changes:

    block of an 'if' or 'elsif' if the regular expression is bound to
    its operand with the '!~' operator. RT #69867.
  * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCaptures now looks into lists
    and blocks in the replacement portion of the regular expression if
    /e is asserted. RT #72086.

      necessary to deal with the case where the open() and the
      corresponding close() are not in the same scope. RT #64437
    * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture now looks inside
      double-quotish things. RT #38942.
    * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture now takes logical
      alternation into account, so that (e.g.)
          if ( /(a)/ || /(b)/ ) {
              say $1;
          }
      is not a violation. RT #38942.
    * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitCommaSeparatedStatements now
