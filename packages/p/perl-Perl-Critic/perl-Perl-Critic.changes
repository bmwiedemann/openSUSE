  1.32    Thu May 31 21:48:48 CDT 2018
      [New Features]
      Added the ability to specify a regex to tell what unused private
      subroutines are OK in Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines.
      This is handy for Moose classes where there could be many false
      positives on _build_xxxx() subroutines.
      Thanks, Dave Cross.  (GH #811, #812)
  
      [Dependencies]
      Perl::Critic now no longer relies on the deprecated Email::Address.
      (GH #816)
  
  1.131_02 Tue Feb 20 17:18:03 CST 2018
      [New Features]
      Perl::Critic now assumes that .psgi files are Perl, too.  Thanks, Tom
      Hukins. (GH#805)
  
      Variables::ProhibitUnusedVariables no longer gives a false positive for
      variables used in interpolation.  Thanks, Omer Gazit. (GH#801)
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      Added missing requirement for Fatal.pm.
  
  
  1.131_01 Tue Nov 21 17:28:06 CST 2017
      [New Features]
      In the ProhibitLeadingZeros policy, added an exception for mkfifo.
      Thanks, Evan Zacks. (GH#786)
  
      Add color support for Windows platforms.  Thanks, Roy Ivy III. (GH#700)
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      Recode Perl::Critic::Utils::all_perl_files() to use File::Find instead
      of opendir/readdir.  This solves endless directory traversals if
      the directories contain circular symbolic references.  Thanks, Tom Wyant.
  
      [Documentation]
      Added CONTRIBUTING.md.  Thanks, Jonas B. Nielsen.

  1.130   Thu Jul 20 23:16:34 CDT 2017
      [New Features]
      * Policies which ensure that system calls are checked such as
        RequireCheckedSystemCalls now have an "autodie_modules" setting which
        allows you to tell the policy about other modules which export
        autodie. Fixes #699. PR #747. Thanks to Dave Rolsky.

      Official release.  No changes since 1.127_02.
  
  1.127_02 Tue May 23 18:31:59 CDT 2017
  
  Developer release leading up to 1.128.
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      * PPI misparsing a module caused an incorrect "Must end with a
        recognizable true value."  This is fixed by upgrading to PPI
        1.224. (GH #696, GH #607)
      * A test would fail under the upcoming Perl 5.26 that omits the current
        directory from @INC.  Thanks, Kent Fredric.
      * Fixed an invalid test in the RequireBarewordsIncludes test.  Thanks,
        Christian Walde. (GH #751)
      * If an element contained blank lines then the source "%r" displayed
        for a violation was wrong. Thanks, Sawyer X. (GH #702, #734)
  
      [Dependencies]
      Perl::Critic now requires PPI 1.224.  PPI is the underlying Perl parser
      on which Perl::Critic is built, and 1.224 introduces many parsing fixes
      such as:
      * Fixes for dot-in-@INC.
      * Parse left side of => as bareword even if it looks like a keyword or op.
      * $::x now works.
      * Higher accuracy when deciding whether certain characters are operators or
        variable type casts (*&% etc.).
      * Subroutine attributes parsed correctly.
  
      [Performance Enhancements]
      * Sped up BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitUselessTopic ~7%.  Thanks, James
        Raspass. (GH #656)
  
      [Documentation]
      * Fixed incorrect explanation of capture variables in
        ProhibitCaptureWithoutTest.  Thanks, Felipe Gasper.
      * Fixed incorrect links. Thanks, Glenn Fowler.
      * Fixed incorrect example for returning a sorted list.  Thanks, @daviding58.
      * Fixed invalid POD.  Thanks, Jakub Wilk. (GH #735)
      * Updated docs on ProhibitYadaOperator.  Thanks, Stuart A Johnston. (GH #662)
      * Removed all the references to the old mailing list and code repository
        at tigris.org.  (GH #757)
  
  
  1.127_01 Sun May 21 21:57:16 CDT 2017
  
      Removed from CPAN because it did not get indexed correctly.

  1.126 2015-08-10
  
      [New Policies]
      * Added a policy: ControlStructures::ProhibitYadaOperator - Never use ...
        in production code.
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      * Fixed problems arising from having -b in your .perltidyrc file. Thanks
        @hjkatz.
      * Removed extra newline from policy names returned by P::C::Config->policies.
        Thanks @ratsbane.
      * `fc` and `say` are now covered by ProhibitUselessTopic. Thanks @JRaspass.
  
      [Miscellanea]
      * Add more strict/warnings importer modules. Thanks @oalders.
      * Path::Tiny is now recommended over File::Slurp
      * Micro-optimize by calling ->content() directly instead of going
        through the overloads. Thanks @JRaspass.
      * Square brackets are now allowed around your `## no critic` policy
        list. Thanks @zdm.

- updated to 1.125
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Critic/Changes

  1.125 2015-03-02
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      * Corrected dependency on List::Util::any() to List::MoreUtils::any()
  
      [Miscellanea]
      * Revised and updated documentation.
  
  1.124 2015-02-27
  
      [Policy Changes]
      * The ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines policy can now ignore files that
        use particular modules with 'skip_when_using' option allows of, for
        example, skipping the policy for roles.  Thanks to Mark Fowler.
  
      * The RequireUseStrict and RequireUseWarnings policies now regard Moose,
        Moo, Mouse, Dancer, Mojolicious, and several other modules as equivalent
        to the strict and warnings pragma.
  
      [Bug Fixes]
      * The RequireChecked* family of policies has been fixed to accommodate
        version numbers when use-ing the autodie pragma. GH #612. Thanks citrin.
  
  1.123 2014-11-11
  
      [Dependencies]
      * Now requires PPI-1.220 which has numerous bug fixes. This may 
        eliminate the need for some "## no critic" markers you inserted to
        work around those bugs. The "ProhibitUselessNoCritic" policy should
        help you find them.
  
      [Miscellanea]
      * Fixed a typo in the Variables::ProhibitPerl4PackageNames message.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 15 15:15:20 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.122
 
     [Dependencies]
     * Now requires PPI-1.218 which has numerous enahncements and bug fixes.
       Also now requires Readonly-2.00, which obviates the need for Readonly::XS
       to get fast constants.
 
     * File::HomeDir, File::Which, and Term::ANSIColor are all required now
       instead of being optional or recommended. This simplifies our test code
       and ensures consistent optimal behavior for all users.
 
     [New Policies]
     * Added two new policies: BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitUselessTopic and
       RegularExpressions::ProhibitUselessTopic.
 
     [Miscellanea]
     * Updated the perlcritic.el script to use modern Emacs hooks.
       Thanks to @intrigeri and the Debian team for the patch.  Fixes GH #556.
 
     * Removed all the internal RCS keyword boilerplate blocks that were never
       getting expanded.

- updated to 1.119
     Bug Fixes:
     * Tests were failing with Config::Tiny 2.17 or later, due to a
       change in the error messages produced by that module. 
       This fixes #16 on Github,  #88679 & #88889 on RT.


     Policy Changes:
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitVoidGrep and ::ProhibitVoidMap: grep
       and map called as functions are now allowed in slice operations.
       RT #79289
       Thanks to Wade at Anomaly dot org for the patch.
     * Subroutines::RequireArgUnpacking: Most tests of the size of @_
       are now allowed.  RT #79138

     Other Changes:
     * Modernized our usage of Exporter.  See RT #75300.  
       Thanks to Olivier MenguÃ© for the patch.

- updated to 1.118
  Policy Changes:
    * CodeLayout::RequireTidyCode: Revise to work with incompatible
      changes in Perl::Tidy 20120619. RT #77977.
    * TestingAndDebugging::ProhibitNoWarnings: Correct the parse of the
      'no warnings' statement, so that 'no warnings "qw"' is recognized
      as supressing just 'qw' warnings. RT #74647.
    * Miscellanea::RequireRcsKeywords has been moved to the Perl-Critic-More
      distribution,  RT #69546

    Other Changes:
    * Make all unescaped literal "{" characters in regexps into
      character classes. These are deprecated, and became noisy with

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 14 07:59:28 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

  New Policies:
  * Variables::ProhibitAugmentedAssignmentInDeclaration reports
    constructs like 'my $x += 1'. Contributed by Mike O'Regan
  Policy Changes:
  * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitLvalueSubstr: Add explicit 'use version'.
    RT #68498.
  * CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs: Add 'pbp' to the default_themes list.
    RT #71093.
  * ControlStructures::ProhibitMutatingListFunctions now understands that
    tr///r (introduced in 5.13.7) does not change its operand.
  * ControlStructures::ProhibitMutatingListFunctions now understands that
    '//=', '<<=', and '>>=' are assignment operators. RT #70901.
  * ErrorHandling::RequireCheckingReturnValueOfEval now allows things
    like grep { eval $_ }. RT #69489.
  * Modules::RequireExplicitPackage now has configuraion option
    allow_import_of, to allow the import of specified modules before
    the package statement. RT #72660.
  * RegularExpressions::ProhibitEnumeratedClasses no longer thinks
    that [A-Za-z_] matches \w. RT #69322.
  * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCaptures now skips the first
    block of an 'if' or 'elsif' if the regular expression is bound to
    its operand with the '!~' operator. RT #69867.
  * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCaptures now looks into lists
    and blocks in the replacement portion of the regular expression if
    /e is asserted. RT #72086.
  * RegularExpressions::RequireDotMatchAnything,
    RegularExpressions::RequireExtendedFormatting and
    RegularExpressions::RequireLineBoundaryMatching now honor defaults
    set with 'use re "/modifiers"'. RT #72151.
  * Subroutines::ProhibitManyArgs now recognizes '+' as a prototype
    character.
  * Variables::ProhibitPunctuationVars now recognizes bracketed
    variables embedded in interpolated strings (e.g. "${$}"). For the
    purpose of the 'allow' configuration, these are considered
    equivalent to the unbracketed form. RT #72910.
  Other Changes:
  * Corrected POD in Perl::Critic::PPI::Utils. RT #68898.
  * Perl::Critic::Violation source() method now returns the line
    containing the violation (not the first line) when the statement
    containing the violation spans multiple lines.

      version is before 5.005.  RT #59112
    * Documentation::RequirePodSections no longer blows up on code
      having POD but no =head1. This problem was introduced with RT
      #59268. RT #67231
    * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture should more reliably
      find things like s/(a)/${1}2/.  RT #67273.
    * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers and
      Module::RequireVersionVar now treat versions passed as the second
      argument of a 'package' statement the same as versions declared as
      'our $VERSION ...'.  RT #67159
    * Variables::RequireLexicalLoopIterators does not report violations
      if the document contains an explicit 'use n.nnn;' where the

    * Documentation::RequirePodLinksIncludeText now handles nested POD
      formatting. RT #65569
    * Clarified relation of severity numbers to names in Perl::Critic
      POD. RT #66017
    * Removed caveats from Variables::RequireLocalizedPunctuationVars,
      no longer necessary with PPI 1.208. RT #65514
    * Have InputOutput::RequireBriefOpen attempt to expand scope as
      necessary to deal with the case where the open() and the
      corresponding close() are not in the same scope. RT #64437
    * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture now looks inside
      double-quotish things. RT #38942.
    * RegularExpressions::ProhibitUnusedCapture now takes logical
      alternation into account, so that (e.g.)
          if ( /(a)/ || /(b)/ ) {
              say $1;
          }
      is not a violation. RT #38942.
    * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitCommaSeparatedStatements now
      recognizes 'return { foo => 1, bar => 2 }' as containing a hash
      constructor, not a block. This was fixed by PPI 1.215. RT #61301.
    * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitCommaSeparatedStatements now
      recognizes 'bless { foo => 1, bar => 2 }' as containing a hash
      constructor, not a block. This was fixed by PPI 1.215. RT #64132.
