- version update to 2021.1024
  - Add/document support for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
    Thank you James Quilty for this contribution [github/issue/9][gh_i9]
    [github/pull/10][gh_i10] :heart:.
  - Fix [github #11][gh_i11]: MessagesHandlerMixIn has been removed in pylint 2.12
  - Breaking: Drop support for `Python<3.7`
  - Breaking: Drop support for `pylint<2.4`
  
    Due to internal API changes in pylint, older versions of pylint
    are no longer supported. If you need to use an older version of
    pylint, you will have to pin `pylint-ignore==2021.1021`.
