  <description>The Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display various debug information about the current request/response and when clicked, display more details about the panel's content.

Currently, the following panels have been written and are working:
    - Django version;
    - Request timer;
    - A list of settings in settings.py;
    - Common HTTP headers;
    - GET/POST/cookie/session variable display;
    - Templates and context used, and their template paths;
    - SQL queries including time to execute and links to EXPLAIN each query;
    - Logging output via Python's built-in logging module.</description>
