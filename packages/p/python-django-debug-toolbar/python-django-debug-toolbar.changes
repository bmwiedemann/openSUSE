Fri Feb  9 08:34:56 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 4.3
  4.3.0 (2024-02-01)
  * Dropped support for Django 4.0.
  * Added Python 3.12 to test matrix.
  * Removed outdated third-party panels from the list.
  * Avoided the unnecessary work of recursively quoting SQL parameters.
  * Postponed context process in templates panel to include lazy evaluated
    content.
  * Fixed template panel to avoid evaluating ``LazyObject`` when not already
    evaluated.
  * Added support for Django 5.0.
  * Refactor the ``utils.get_name_from_obj`` to simulate the behavior of
    ``django.contrib.admindocs.utils.get_view_name``.
  * Switched from black to the `ruff formatter
    <https://astral.sh/blog/the-ruff-formatter>`__.
  * Changed the default position of the toolbar from top to the upper top
    position.
  * Added the setting, ``UPDATE_ON_FETCH`` to control whether the
    toolbar automatically updates to the latest AJAX request or not.
    It defaults to ``False``.
  4.2.0 (2023-08-10)
  * Adjusted app directories system check to allow for nested template loaders.
  * Switched from flake8, isort and pyupgrade to `ruff
    <https://beta.ruff.rs/>`__.
  * Converted cookie keys to lowercase. Fixed the ``samesite`` argument to
    ``djdt.cookie.set``.
  * Converted ``StaticFilesPanel`` to no longer use a thread collector. Instead,
    it collects the used static files in a ``ContextVar``.
  * Added check ``debug_toolbar.W007`` to warn when JavaScript files are
    resolving to the wrong content type.
  * Fixed SQL statement recording under PostgreSQL for queries encoded as byte
    strings.
  * Patch the ``CursorWrapper`` class with a mixin class to support multiple
    base wrapper classes.
  4.1.0 (2023-05-15)
  * Improved SQL statement formatting performance.  Additionally, fixed the
    indentation of ``CASE`` statements and stopped simplifying ``.count()``
    queries.
  * Added support for the new STORAGES setting in Django 4.2 for static files.
  * Added support for theme overrides.
  * Reworked the cache panel instrumentation code to no longer attempt to undo
    monkey patching of cache methods, as that turned out to be fragile in the
    presence of other code which also monkey patches those methods.
  * Update all timing code that used :py:func:`time.time()` to use
    :py:func:`time.perf_counter()` instead.
  * Made the check on ``request.META["wsgi.multiprocess"]`` optional, but
    defaults to forcing the toolbar to render the panels on each request. This
    is because it's likely an ASGI application that's serving the responses
    and that's more likely to be an incompatible setup. If you find that this
    is incorrect for you in particular, you can use the ``RENDER_PANELS``
    setting to forcibly control this logic.
  4.0.0 (2023-04-03)
  * Added Django 4.2 to the CI.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.7.
  * Fixed PostgreSQL raw query with a tuple parameter during on explain.
  * Use ``TOOLBAR_LANGUAGE`` setting when rendering individual panels
    that are loaded via AJAX.
  * Add decorator for rendering toolbar views with ``TOOLBAR_LANGUAGE``.
  * Removed the logging panel. The panel's implementation was too complex, caused
    memory leaks and sometimes very verbose and hard to silence output in some
    environments (but not others). The maintainers judged that time and effort is
    better invested elsewhere.
  * Added support for psycopg3.
  * When ``ENABLE_STACKTRACE_LOCALS`` is ``True``, the stack frames' locals dicts
    will be converted to strings when the stack trace is captured rather when it
    is rendered, so that the correct values will be displayed in the rendered
    stack trace, as they may have changed between the time the stack trace was
    captured and when it is rendered.
  3.8.1 (2022-12-03)
  * Fixed release process by re-adding twine to release dependencies. No
    functional change.
  3.8.0 (2022-12-03)
  * Added protection against division by 0 in timer.js
  * Auto-update History panel for JavaScript ``fetch`` requests.
  * Support `HTMX boosting <https://htmx.org/docs/#boosting>`__ and
    `Turbo <https://turbo.hotwired.dev/>`__ pages.
  * Simplify logic for ``Panel.enabled`` property by checking cookies earlier.
  * Include panel scripts in content when ``RENDER_PANELS`` is set to True.
  * Create one-time mouseup listener for each mousedown when dragging the
    handle.
  * Update package metadata to use Hatchling.
  * Fix highlighting on history panel so odd rows are highlighted when
    selected.
  * Formalize support for Python 3.11.
  * Added ``TOOLBAR_LANGUAGE`` setting.
  3.7.0 (2022-09-25)
  * Added Profiling panel setting ``PROFILER_THRESHOLD_RATIO`` to give users
    better control over how many function calls are included. A higher value
    will include more data, but increase render time.
  * Update Profiling panel to include try to always include user code. This
    code is more important to developers than dependency code.
  * Highlight the project function calls in the profiling panel.
  * Added Profiling panel setting ``PROFILER_CAPTURE_PROJECT_CODE`` to allow
    users to disable the inclusion of all project code. This will be useful
    to project setups that have dependencies installed under
    ``settings.BASE_DIR``.
  * The toolbar's font stack now prefers system UI fonts. Tweaked paddings,
    margins and alignments a bit in the CSS code.
  * Only sort the session dictionary when the keys are all strings. Fixes a
    bug that causes the toolbar to crash when non-strings are used as keys.
