%description
This module provides a basic framework for creating and maintaining RDF
Site Summary (RSS) files. This distribution also contains many examples
that allow you to generate HTML from an RSS, convert between 0.9, 0.91,
1.0, and 2.0 version, and other nifty things. This might be helpful if you
want to include news feeds on your Web site from sources like Slashdot and
Freshmeat or if you want to syndicate your own content.

XML::RSS currently supports versions at http://www.rssboard.org/rss-0-9-0,
at http://www.rssboard.org/rss-0-9-1, at http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/,
and at http://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0 of RSS.

RSS was originally developed by Netscape as the format for Netscape
Netcenter channels, however, many Web sites have since adopted it as a
simple syndication format. With the advent of RSS 1.0, users are now able
to syndication many different kinds of content including news headlines,
threaded messages, products catalogs, etc.

*Note:* In order to parse and generate dates (such as 'pubDate' and
'dc:date') it is recommended to use DateTime::Format::Mail and
DateTime::Format::W3CDTF , which is what XML::RSS uses internally and
requires. It should also be possible to pass DateTime objects which will be
formatted accordingly. E.g:

    use DateTime ();

    my $dt = DateTime->from_epoch(epoch => 1_500_000_000);

    $rss->channel(
        pubDate => $dt,
        .
        .
        .
    );
