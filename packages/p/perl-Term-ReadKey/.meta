  <title>Module for Simple Terminal Control</title>
  <description>This module, ReadKey, provides ioctl control for terminals and Win32 consoles
so the input modes can be changed (thus allowing reads of a single character at
a time), and also provides non-blocking reads of stdin, as well as several
other terminal related features, including retrieval/modification of the screen
size, and retrieval/modification of the control characters.
