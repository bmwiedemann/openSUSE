%description
HeapDict implements the MutableMapping ABC, meaning it works pretty
much like a regular Python dict.  It's designed to be used as a
priority queue.

Unlike the Python standard library's heapq module, the HeapDict
supports efficiently changing the priority of an existing object
(often called "decrease-key" in textbooks).  Altering the priority is
important for many algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*.
