Main:            This page lists all optional PARI/GP packages made available by
  PARI/GP?       the PARI group. These packages use up a nonnegligible amount of
  Download       disk space and will be useless for most users, hence they are
  Packages       distributed separately and maintained independently. They are
  Search         rarely upgraded so most of them will only be downloaded once.

Support:         All packages are © the PARI group, distributed under the terms

  Links          Note: some browsers will silently gunzip the downloaded files,

Guidelines
  Latest         Simply extract the archive in same folder as gp.exe (this will
Changes          create a 'data' subfolder).
  Bugs
  Buildlogs      To install a package from a source distribution.

Statistics:      Extract the archive in the toplevel pari directory before
  Benchmarks     running ./Configure. Then run make install as usual.
  WWW Stats
                 To install a package into an existing PARI/GP installation.

                 This is in particular the only method available to users of the
                 Windows self-extracting binary.

                 Extract the archive anywhere you like, which will create a
                 'data' folder. Open 'data' and move the folder it contains
                 (e.g. elldata) to the directory where the installer placed
                 architecture independent files. The default destinations are

                   /usr/local/share/pari              (Unix)
                   C:\Program Files\PARI              (Win32)

                 You may delete the now empty 'data' folder.

                     smaller version that should be suitable for primes up to
                     350 bits. These polynomials were extracted from the ECHIDNA

                     Repackaging of the historical megrez number field tables
                     (errors fixed, 1/10th the size, easier to use). This
                     package requires no installation: extract it where desired
                     and look at the [README].
