 - Fixed a runtime error in a vendored dependency (toml).
- update to version 5.0.0:
 - Breaking changes:
  - isort now requires Python 3.6+ to run but continues to support formatting on ALL versions of python including Python 2 code.
  - isort deprecates official support for Python 3.4, removing modules only in this release from known_standard_library:
  -     user
  - Config files are no longer composed on-top of each-other. Instead the first config file found is used.
  -     Since there is no longer composition negative form settings (such as --dont-skip) are no longer required and have been removed.
  - Two-letter shortened setting names (like ac for atomic) now require two dashes to avoid ambiguity: --ac.
  - For consistency with other tools -v now is shorthand for verbose and -V is shorthand for version. See Issue: #1067.
  - length_sort_{section_name} config usage has been deprecated. Instead length_sort_sections list can be used to specify a list of sections that need to be length sorted.
  - safety_excludes and unsafe have been deprecated
  - Config now includes as default full set of safety directories defined by safety excludes.
  - --recursive option has been removed. Directories passed in are now automatically sorted recursive.
  - --apply option has been removed as it is the default behaviour.
  - isort now does nothing, beyond giving instructions and exiting status code 0, when ran with no arguments.
  -     a new --interactive flag has been added to enable the old style behaviour.
  - isort now works on contiguous sections of imports, instead of one whole file at a time.
  - isort now formats all nested "as" imports in the "from" form. import x.y as a becomes from x import y as a.
  - keep_direct_and_as_imports option now defaults to True.
  - appdirs is no longer supported. Unless manually specified, config should be project config only.
  - toml is now installed as a vendorized module, meaning pyproject.toml based config is always supported.
  - Completely new Python API, old version is removed and no longer accessible.
  - New module placement logic and module fully replaces old finders. Old approach is still available via --old-finders.
 - Internal:
  - isort now utilizes mypy and typing to filter out typing related issues before deployment.
  - isort now utilizes black internally to ensure more consistent formatting.
  - profile support for common project types (black, django, google, etc)
  - Much much more. There is some difficulty in fully capturing the extent of changes in this release - just because of how all encompassing the release is. See: Github Issues for more.

Thu Feb 28 06:07:17 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Drop add-editorconfig.patch made redundant by new sdist
- Add fdupes
- Update to v4.3.9
  * Fixed a bug that led to an incompatibility with black: #831
- from 4.3.8
  * Fixed a bug that led to the recursive option not always been available
    from the command line.
- from 4.3.7
  * Expands the finder failsafe to occur on the creation of the finder objects.
- from 4.3.6
  * Fixes a fatal error that occurs if a single finder throws an exception.
    Important as we add more finders that utilize third party libraries.
- from 4.3.5
  + Potentially Interface Breaking:
    * The `-r` option for removing imports has been renamed `-rm` to avoid
      accidental deletions and confusion with the `-rc` recursive option.
    * `__init__.py` has been removed from the default ignore list. The default
      ignore list is now empty - with all items needing to be explicitly ignored.
    * Isort will now by default ignore .tox / venv folders in an effort to be "safe".
      You can disable this behaviour by setting the "--unsafe" flag, this is
      separate from any skip or not skip rules you may have in place.
    * Isort now allows for files missing closing newlines in whitespace check
    * `distutils` support has been removed to simplify setup.py
  + New:
    * Official Python 3.7 Compatibility.
    * Support for using requirements files to auto determine third-paty
      section if pipreqs & requirementslib are installed.
    * Added support for using pyproject.toml if toml is installed.
    * Added support for XDG_HOME if appdirs is installed.
    * An option has been added to enable ignoring trailing comments
      ('ignore_comments') defaulting to False.
    * Added support to enable line length sorting for only specific sections
    * Added a `correctly_sorted` property on the SortsImport to enable more
      intuitive programmatic checking.
  + Fixes:
    * Improved black compatibility.
    * Isort will no detect files in the CWD as first-party.
    * Fixed several cases where '-ns' or 'not_skip' was being incorrectly
      ignored.
    * Fixed sorting of relative path imports ('.', '..', '...', etc).
    * Fixed bugs caused by a failure to maintain order when loading iterables
      from config files.
    * Correctly handle CPython compiled imports and others that need EXT_SUFFIX
      to correctly identify.
    * Fixed handling of Symbolic Links to follow them when walking the path.
    * Fixed handling of relative known_paths.
    * Fixed lack of access to all wrap modes from the CLI.
    * Fixed handling of FIFO files.
    * Fixed a bug that could result in multiple imports being inserted on the
      same line.
