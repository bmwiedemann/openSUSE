- Update to 2.0.0
  * Breaking Change: PyOpenSSL has been fully removed. - Dropped objects:
    - josepy.util.ComparableX509
      - Functions now expect cryptography.x509 objects: josepy.json_util.encode_cert josepy.json_util.encode_csr josepy.jws.Header.x5c.encoder
      - Functions now return cryptography.x509 objects: josepy.json_util.decode_cert josepy.json_util.decode_csr josepy.jws.Header.x5c.decoder
  * Dropped support for Python 3.8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  5 08:59:30 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.15.0
  * Added a deprecation warning about future backwards incompatible changes. The
    text of that warning is "The next major version of josepy will remove
    josepy.util.ComparableX509 and all uses of it as part of removing our
    dependency on PyOpenSSL. This includes modifying any functions with
    ComparableX509 parameters or return values. This will be a breaking change.
    To avoid breakage, we recommend pinning josepy < 2.0.0 until josepy 2.0.0 is
    out and you've had time to update your code."
  * Added support for Python 3.13.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.7.
  * Support for Python 3.8 has been deprecated and will be removed in the next
    scheduled release.

Tue Oct  5 19:12:28 UTC 2021 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.10.0
  * josepy is now compliant with PEP-561: type checkers will fetch
    types from the inline types annotations when josepy is
    installed as a dependency in a Python project.
  * Added a field function to assist in adding type annotations for
    Fields in classes. If the field function is used to define a
    Field in a JSONObjectWithFields based class without a type
    annotation, an error will be raised.
  * josepy's tests can no longer be imported under the name josepy,
    however, they are still included in the package and you can run
    them by installing josepy with "tests" extras and running
    python -m pytest.

- Changes from 1.9.0
  * Removed pytest-cache testing dependency.
  * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused incorrect padding to be used
    when serializing Elliptic Curve keys as JSON Web Keys.
