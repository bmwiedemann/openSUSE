Mon Jan 26 08:28:32 UTC 2026 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.2.3:
  * Add support for pytest 9.0.
  * Moved the README.rst/CHANGELOG.rst concatenation from
    setup.py to pyproject.toml.
  * Fixed auto-disable to work with newer xdist (pytest-benchmark
    auto disables benchmarks if xdist is enabled by design).
    Contributed by Thomas B. Brunner in #294.
  * Add markers so pytest doesn't try to assert-rewrite the
    plugin internals (fixes those
    pytest.PytestAssertRewriteWarning: Module already imported so
    cannot be rewritten; pytest_benchmark warnings).
  * Added support for a per-round teardown function to pedantic
    mode. Contributed Patrick Winter by #264.
  * Added --benchmark-time-unit option. Contributed by Tony Kuo
    in #281.
  * Fixed deprecated hook examples in docstrings. Contributed by
    Ali-Akber Saifee in #284.
  * Changed --benchmark-compare-fail to accept percentages higher
    than 100%. Contributed by Ben Avrahami in #280.
  * Added minimal typing support. Contributed by Sorin Sbarnea in
    #290.
  * Fixed support for Python 3.9. Contributed by Enno Gotthold in
    #291.
  * Replaced the complicated and broken code of
    pytest_benchmark.utils.clonefunc with a simple return of the
    input. That function was supposed to allow benchmarking with
    the cost of PyPy JIT included but it's a hassle to maintain.
  * Moved the instrumentation pause outside the round loops (in
    addition to tracing, profiling is paused too). Pedantic mode
    will keep doing this per round (as the user manually controls
    the round count). This is necessary because in some scenarios
    setting and unsetting the tracer too much will overflow an
    internal counter (found to cause "OverflowError: events set
    too many times" at least on Python 3.13).
  * Fixed broken hooks handling on pytest 8.1 or later (the
    TypeError: import_path() missing 1 required keyword-only
    argument: 'consider_namespace_packages' issue). Unfortunately
    this sets the minimum supported pytest version to 8.1.
  * Fixed bad fixture check that broke down then nbmake was
    enabled.
  * Dropped support for now EOL Python 3.8. Also moved tests
    suite to only test the latest pytest versions (8.3.x).
  * Fix generate parametrize tests benchmark csv report errors
    (issue #268). Contributed by Johnny Huang in #269.
  * Added the --benchmark-time-unit cli option for overriding the
    measurement unit used for display. Contributed by Tony Kuo in
    #257.
  * Fixes spelling in some help texts. Contributed by Eugeniy in
    #267.
  * Added new cprofile options: --benchmark-cprofile-loops=LOOPS
    - previously profiling only ran the function once, this allow
    customization. --benchmark-cprofile-top=COUNT - allows
    showing more rows. --benchmark-cprofile-dump=[FILENAME-
    PREFIX] - allows saving to a file (that you can load in
    snakeviz, RunSnakeRun or other tools).
  * --benchmark-cprofile-loops=LOOPS - previously profiling only
    ran the function once, this allow customization.
  * --benchmark-cprofile-top=COUNT - allows showing more rows.
  * --benchmark-cprofile-dump=[FILENAME-PREFIX] - allows saving
    to a file (that you can load in snakeviz, RunSnakeRun or
    other tools).
  * Removed hidden dependency on py.path (replaced with pathlib).
  * Dropped support for legacy Pythons (2.7, 3.6 or older).
  * Switched CI to GitHub Actions.
  * Removed dependency on the py library (that was not properly
    specified as a dependency anyway).
  * Fix skipping test in test_utils.py if appropriate VCS not
    available. Also fix typo. Contributed by Sam James in #211.
  * Added support for pytest 7.2.0 by using pytest.hookimpl and
    pytest.hookspec to configure hooks. Contributed by Florian
    Bruhin in #224.
  * Now no save is attempted if --benchmark-disable is used.
    Fixes #205. Contributed by Friedrich Delgado in #207.
  * Republished with updated changelog. I intended to publish a
    3.3.0 release but I messed it up because bumpversion doesn't
    work well with pre-commit apparently... thus 3.4.0 was set in
    by accident.
  * Disable progress indication unless --benchmark-verbose is
    used. Contributed by Dimitris Rozakis in #149.
  * Added Python 3.9, dropped Python 3.5. Contributed by Miroslav
    Šedivý in #189.
  * Changed the "cpu" data in the json output to include
    everything that cpuinfo outputs, for better or worse as
    cpuinfo 6.0 changed some fields. Users should now ensure they
    are an adequate cpuinfo package installed. MAY BE BACKWARDS
    INCOMPATIBLE
  * Changed behavior of --benchmark-skip and --benchmark-only to
    apply early in the collection phase. This means skipped tests
    won't make pytest run fixtures for said tests unnecessarily,
    but unfortunately this also means the skipping behavior will
    be applied to any tests that requires a "benchmark" fixture,
    regardless if it would come from pytest-benchmark or not. MAY
    BE BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE
  * Added --benchmark-quiet - option to disable reporting and
    other information output.
  * Squelched unnecessary warning when --benchmark-disable and
    save options are used. Fixes #199.
  * PerformanceRegression exception no longer inherits
    pytest.UsageError (apparently a final class).
  * Fixed "already-imported" pytest warning. Contributed by
    Jonathan Simon Prates in #151.
  * Fixed breakage that occurs when benchmark is disabled while
    using cprofile feature (by disabling cprofile too).
  * Dropped Python 3.4 from the test suite and updated test deps.
  * Fixed pytest_benchmark.utils.clonefunc to work on Python 3.8.
  * Added support for pytest items without funcargs. Fixes
    interoperability with other pytest plugins like pytest-
    flake8.
  * Updated changelog entries for 3.2.0. I made the release for
    pytest-cov on the same day and thought I updated the
    changelogs for both plugins. Alas, I only updated pytest-cov.
  * Added missing version constraint change. Now pytest >= 3.8 is
    required (due to pytest 4.1 support).
  * Fixed couple CI/test issues.
  * Fixed broken pytest_benchmark.__version__.
  * Added support for simple trial x-axis histogram label.
    Contributed by Ken Crowell in #95).
  * Added support for Pytest 3.3+, Contributed by Julien
    Nicoulaud in #103.
  * Added support for Pytest 4.0. Contributed by Pablo Aguiar in
    #129 and #130.
  * Added support for Pytest 4.1.
  * Various formatting, spelling and documentation fixes.
    Contributed by Ken Crowell, Ofek Lev, Matthew Feickert, Jose
    Eduardo, Anton Lodder, Alexander Duryagin and Grygorii
    Iermolenko in #97, #105, #110, #111, #115, #123, #131 and
    #140.
  * Fixed broken pytest_benchmark_update_machine_info hook.
    Contributed by Alex Ford in #109.
  * Fixed bogus xdist warning when using --benchmark-disable.
    Contributed by Francesco Ballarin in #113.
  * Added support for pathlib2. Contributed by Lincoln de Sousa
    in #114.
  * Changed handling so you can use --benchmark-skip and
    --benchmark-only, with the later having priority. Contributed
    by Ofek Lev in #116.
  * Fixed various CI/testing issues. Contributed by Stanislav
    Levin in #134, #136 and #138.
  * Fixed loading data from old json files (missing ops field,
    see #81).
  * Fixed regression on broken SCM (see #82).
  * Added "operations per second" (ops field in Stats) metric --
    shows the call rate of code being tested. Contributed by
    Alexey Popravka in #78.
  * Added a time field in commit_info. Contributed by "varac" in
    #71.
  * Added a author_time field in commit_info. Contributed by
    "varac" in #75.
  * Fixed the leaking of credentials by masking the URL printed
    when storing data to elasticsearch.
  * Added a --benchmark-netrc option to use credentials from a
    netrc file when storing data to elasticsearch. Both
    contributed by Andre Bianchi in #73.
  * Fixed docs on hooks. Contributed by Andre Bianchi in #74.
  * Remove git and hg as system dependencies when guessing the
    project name.
  * machine_info now contains more detailed information about the
    CPU, in particular the exact model. Contributed by Antonio
    Cuni in #61.
  * Added benchmark.extra_info, which you can use to save
    arbitrary stuff in the JSON. Contributed by Antonio Cuni in
    the same PR as above.
  * Fix support for latest PyGal version (histograms).
    Contributed by Swen Kooij in #68.
  * Added support for getting commit_info when not running in the
    root of the repository. Contributed by Vara Canero in #69.
  * Added short form for --storage/--verbose options in CLI.
  * Added an alternate pytest-benchmark CLI bin (in addition to
    py.test-benchmark) to match the madness in pytest.
  * Fix some issues with --help in CLI.
  * Improved git remote parsing (for commit_info in JSON
    outputs).
  * Fixed default value for --benchmark-columns.
  * Fixed comparison mode (loading was done too late).
  * Remove the project name from the autosave name. This will get
    the old brief naming from 3.0 back.
  * Added --benchmark-columns command line option. It selects
    what columns are displayed in the result table. Contributed
    by Antonio Cuni in #34.
  * Added support for grouping by specific test parametrization
    (--benchmark-group-by=param:NAME where NAME is your param
    name). Contributed by Antonio Cuni in #37.
  * Added support for name or fullname in --benchmark-sort.
    Contributed by Antonio Cuni in #37.
  * Changed signature for pytest_benchmark_generate_json hook to
    take 2 new arguments: machine_info and commit_info.
  * Changed --benchmark-histogram to plot groups instead of name-
    matching runs.
  * Changed --benchmark-histogram to plot exactly what you
    compared against. Now it's 1:1 with the compare feature.
  * Changed --benchmark-compare to allow globs. You can compare
    against all the previous runs now.
  * Changed --benchmark-group-by to allow multiple values
    separated by comma. Example: --benchmark-group-
    by=param:foo,param:bar
  * Added a command line tool to compare previous data: py.test-
    benchmark. It has two commands: list - Lists all the
    available files. compare - Displays result tables. Takes
    options: --sort=COL --group-by=LABEL --columns=LABELS
    --histogram=[FILENAME-PREFIX]
  * list - Lists all the available files.
  * compare - Displays result tables. Takes options: --sort=COL
    --group-by=LABEL --columns=LABELS --histogram=[FILENAME-
    PREFIX]
  * --sort=COL
  * --group-by=LABEL
  * --columns=LABELS
  * --histogram=[FILENAME-PREFIX]
  * Added --benchmark-cprofile that profiles last run of
    benchmarked function.  Contributed by Petr Šebek.
  * Changed --benchmark-storage so it now allows elasticsearch
    storage. It allows to store data to elasticsearch instead to
    json files. Contributed by Petr Šebek in #58.
  * Improved --help text for --benchmark-histogram, --benchmark-
    save and --benchmark-autosave.
  * Benchmarks that raised exceptions during test now have
    special highlighting in result table (red background).
  * Benchmarks that raised exceptions are not included in the
    saved data anymore (you can still get the old behavior back
    by implementing pytest_benchmark_generate_json in your
    conftest.py).
  * The plugin will use pytest's warning system for warnings.
    There are 2 categories: WBENCHMARK-C (compare mode issues)
    and WBENCHMARK-U (usage issues).
  * The red warnings are only shown if --benchmark-verbose is
    used. They still will be always be shown in the pytest-
    warnings section.
  * Using the benchmark fixture more than one time is disallowed
    (will raise exception).
  * Not using the benchmark fixture (but requiring it) will issue
    a warning (WBENCHMARK-U1).
  * Changed --benchmark-warmup to take optional value and
    automatically activate on PyPy (default value is auto). MAY
    BE BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE
  * Removed the version check in compare mode (previously there
    was a warning if current version is lower than what's in the
    file).
  * Changed how comparison is displayed in the result table. Now
    previous runs are shown as normal runs and names get a
    special suffix indicating the origin. Eg: "test_foobar (NOW)"
    or "test_foobar (0123)".
  * Fixed sorting in the result table. Now rows are sorted by the
    sort column, and then by name.
  * Show the plugin version in the header section.
  * Moved the display of default options in the header section.
  * Add a --benchmark-disable option. It's automatically
    activated when xdist is on
  * When xdist is on or statistics can't be imported then
    --benchmark-disable is automatically activated (instead of
    --benchmark-skip). BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE
  * Replace the deprecated __multicall__ with the new hookwrapper
    system.
  * Improved description for --benchmark-max-time.
  * Tests are sorted alphabetically in the results table.
  * Failing to import statistics doesn't create hard failures
    anymore. Benchmarks are automatically skipped if import
    failure occurs. This would happen on Python 3.2 (or earlier
    Python 3).
  * Changed how failures to get commit info are handled: now they
    are soft failures. Previously it made the whole test suite
    fail, just because you didn't have git/hg installed.
  * Added progress indication when computing stats.
  * Fixed accidental output capturing caused by capturemanager
    misuse.
  * Added JSON report saving (the --benchmark-json command line
    arguments). Based on initial work from Dave Collins in #8.
  * Added benchmark data storage(the --benchmark-save and
    --benchmark-autosave command line arguments).
  * Added comparison to previous runs (the --benchmark-compare
    command line argument).
  * Added performance regression checks (the --benchmark-compare-
    fail command line argument).
  * Added possibility to group by various parts of test name (the
    --benchmark-compare-group-by command line argument).
  * Added historical plotting (the --benchmark-histogram command
    line argument).
  * Added option to fine tune the calibration (the --benchmark-
    calibration-precision command line argument and
    calibration_precision marker option).
  * Changed benchmark_weave to no longer be a context manager.
    Cleanup is performed automatically. BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE
  * Added benchmark.weave method (alternative to benchmark_weave
    fixture).
  * Added new hooks to allow customization:
    pytest_benchmark_generate_machine_info(config)
    pytest_benchmark_update_machine_info(config, info)
    pytest_benchmark_generate_commit_info(config)
    pytest_benchmark_update_commit_info(config, info)
    pytest_benchmark_group_stats(config, benchmarks, group_by)
    pytest_benchmark_generate_json(config, benchmarks,
    include_data) pytest_benchmark_update_json(config,
    benchmarks, output_json)
    pytest_benchmark_compare_machine_info(config,
    benchmarksession, machine_info, compared_benchmark)
  * pytest_benchmark_generate_machine_info(config)
  * pytest_benchmark_update_machine_info(config, info)
  * pytest_benchmark_generate_commit_info(config)
  * pytest_benchmark_update_commit_info(config, info)
  * pytest_benchmark_group_stats(config, benchmarks, group_by)
  * pytest_benchmark_generate_json(config, benchmarks,
    include_data)
  * pytest_benchmark_update_json(config, benchmarks, output_json)
  * pytest_benchmark_compare_machine_info(config,
    benchmarksession, machine_info, compared_benchmark)
  * Changed the timing code to: Tracers are automatically
    disabled when running the test function (like coverage
    tracers). Fixed an issue with calibration code getting stuck.
  * Tracers are automatically disabled when running the test
    function (like coverage tracers).
  * Fixed an issue with calibration code getting stuck.
  * Added pedantic mode via benchmark.pedantic(). This mode
    disables calibration and allows a setup function.
  * Improved test suite a bit (not using cram anymore).
  * Improved help text on the --benchmark-warmup option.
  * Made warmup_iterations available as a marker argument (eg:
    @pytest.mark.benchmark(warmup_iterations=1234)).
  * Fixed --benchmark-verbose's printouts to work properly with
    output capturing.
  * Changed how warmup iterations are computed (now number of
    total iterations is used, instead of just the rounds).
  * Fixed a bug where calibration would run forever.
  * Disabled red/green coloring (it was kinda random) when
    there's a single test in the results table.
  * Fix regression, plugin was raising ValueError: no option
    named 'dist' when xdist wasn't installed.
  * Add a benchmark_weave experimental fixture.
  * Fix internal failures when xdist plugin is active.
  * Automatically disable benchmarks if xdist is active.
  * Moved the warmup in the calibration phase. Solves issues with
    benchmarking on PyPy. Added a --benchmark-warmup-iterations
    option to fine-tune that.
  * Make the default rounds smaller (so that variance is more
    accurate).
  * Show the defaults in the --help section.
  * Simplify the calibration code so that the round is smaller.
  * Add diagnostic output for calibration code (--benchmark-
    verbose).
  * Replace the context-manager based API with a simple callback
    interface. BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE
  * Implement timer calibration for precise measurements.
  * Use a precise default timer for PyPy.
  * README and styling fixes. Contributed by Marc Abramowitz in
    #4.
  * Lots of wild changes and too many irrelevant releases to
    include.

- update to 5.1.0:
  * Fixed broken hooks handling on pytest 8.1 or later (the
    TypeError: import_path() missing 1 required keyword-only
    argument: 'consider_namespace_packages' issue). Unfortunately
    this sets the minimum supported pytest version to 8.1.
  * Fixed bad fixture check that broke down then nbmake was
    enabled.
  * Dropped support for now EOL Python 3.8. Also moved tests
    suite to only test the latest pytest versions (8.3.x).
  * Fix generate parametrize tests benchmark csv report errors
    (issue #268). Contributed by Johnny Huang in #269.
  * Added the --benchmark-time-unit cli option for overriding the
    measurement unit used for display. Contributed by Tony Kuo in
    #257.
  * Fixes spelling in some help texts. Contributed by Eugeniy in
    #267.
  * Added new cprofile options: --benchmark-cprofile-loops=LOOPS
    - previously profiling only ran the function once, this allow
    customization. --benchmark-cprofile-top=COUNT - allows
    showing more rows. --benchmark-cprofile-dump=[FILENAME-
    PREFIX] - allows saving to a file (that you can load in
    snakeviz, RunSnakeRun or other tools).
