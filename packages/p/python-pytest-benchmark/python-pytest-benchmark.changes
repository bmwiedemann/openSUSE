Wed Nov 30 07:44:51 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 4.0.0:
  * Dropped support for legacy Pythons (2.7, 3.6 or older).
  * Switched CI to GitHub Actions.
  * Removed dependency on the py library (that was not properly specified as a
    dependency anyway).
  * Fix skipping test in test_utils.py if appropriate VCS not available. Also
    fix typo. Contributed by Sam James in #211.
  * Added support for pytest 7.2.0 by using pytest.hookimpl and pytest.hookspec
    to configure hooks. Contributed by Florian Bruhin in #224.
  * Now no save is attempted if --benchmark-disable is used. Fixes #205.
    Contributed by Friedrich Delgado in #207.

Mon Mar 28 21:07:02 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 3.4.1
  * Disable progress indication unless --benchmark-verbose is used.
    Contributed by Dimitris Rozakis in #149.
  * Added Python 3.9, dropped Python 3.5. Contributed by Miroslav
    Šedivý in #189.
  * Changed the "cpu" data in the json output to include everything
    that cpuinfo outputs, for better or worse as cpuinfo 6.0
    changed some fields. Users should now ensure they are an
    adequate cpuinfo package installed. MAY BE BACKWARDS
    INCOMPATIBLE
  * Changed behavior of --benchmark-skip and --benchmark-only to
    apply early in the collection phase. This means skipped tests
    won't make pytest run fixtures for said tests unnecessarily,
    but unfortunately this also means the skipping behavior will be
    applied to any tests that requires a "benchmark" fixture,
    regardless if it would come from pytest-benchmark or not. MAY
    BE BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE
  * Added --benchmark-quiet - option to disable reporting and other
    information output.
  * Squelched unnecessary warning when --benchmark-disable and save
    options are used. Fixes #199.
  * PerformanceRegression exception no longer inherits
    pytest.UsageError (apparently a final class).

Mon Jan 13 14:13:23 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

  * Fixed pytest_benchmark.utils.clonefunc to work on Python 3.8.

Mon Jul 22 08:30:20 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Disable tests for now, the output from pytest changed quite a
  bit and upstream needs to adapt it for pytest5. The plugin
  actually works, it just fails its own testsuite...
