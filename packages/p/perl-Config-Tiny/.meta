  <title>Read/Write .ini style files with as little code as possible</title>
  <description>'Config::Tiny' is a perl class to read and write .ini style configuration
files with as little code as possible, reducing load time and memory
overhead. Most of the time it is accepted that Perl applications use a lot
of memory and modules. The '::Tiny' family of modules is specifically
intended to provide an ultralight alternative to the standard modules.

This module is primarily for reading human written files, and anything we
write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If you need something
with more power move up to the Config::Simple manpage, the Config::General
manpage or one of the many other 'Config::' modules. To rephrase, the
Config::Tiny manpage does *not* preserve your comments, whitespace, or the
order of your config file.
