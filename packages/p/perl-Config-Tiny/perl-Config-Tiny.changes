Thu Aug  1 08:37:37 UTC 2019 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

- Update to 0.24
  - Delete from caveats in documentation where it used to say:
          'Config::Tiny will only recognize the first time an option is set in a config file.'
          'Any further attempts to set the same option later in the config file are ignored.'
          In reality the code uses the 2nd and subsequent values to overwrite earlier values.
  - Make this topic a new FAQ.
  - Add corresponding test t/06.repeat.key.t.
  - Update POD to clarify trailing comment options.
  - Add corresponding test t/07.trailing.comment.t.
  - Romanize Gregory Kidrenko's name so Config::IniFiles does not get 'Wide char in print'.
  - Move xt/pod.t to xt/author/pod.t.
  - Adopt new repo structure. See
          http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
  - Move require 5.008001 from Tiny.pm into Makefile.PL.

  Comments= <<EOT
  - Add the utf8 BOM to this file. Let's hope the CPAN toolchain can cope. If it can't, another
  version of the code will have to be released.
  - Fix read() and write() so they work on files called '0' (zero). See RT#107754.
  Many thanx to Григорий Кудренко for the report and patch.
  - Add t/05.zero.t and t/0 to test the new code.
  - Reformat the source slightly.
  EOT

Sat Mar 21 21:09:44 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 2.22
  * Fix licence info in Makefile.PL to say Perl.
- Changes for 2.21
  * Patch Makefile.PL to refer to the current repo, which is on 
    github, and not the original one, which is on Adam's web site. 
    See RT#102125.
  * Remove Build.PL because Karen Etheridge tells me Module::Build 
    is no longer in core. See RT#102126.
  * Edit line lengths in this file to a max of 100 chars.
  * Edit line lengths in the docs the same way.
  * Expand the See Also section of the docs.

Tue Nov 26 07:31:49 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.20
  - Relax pre-req version requirements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  4 09:11:29 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.19
        - Change VERSION => $VERSION in Makefile.PL to VERSION_FROM => 'lib/Config/Tiny.pm'.
                Reported by Jean-Louis Morel. See RT#88670.
 
 2.18  Sat Sep 14 10:03:00 2013
        - Remove obsolete and wrong version # from Makefile.PL.
                Reported by Jean-Louis Morel. See RT#88658.
        - Implement Kevin Ryde's suggestion to test if read() will return undef.
                If so, set an error message and (still) return undef.
 
 2.17  Fri Sep 13 12:41:00 2013
        - Remove the file tests -efr during calls to read(). The open() tests for any error.
                Also, the -f test was reporting /dev/null as a directory, not a file.
                Thanx to Kevin Ryde for pushing me to implement this. See RT#36974.
        - Clean up some error messages slightly.
 
 2.16  Fri Sep  6 11:54:00 2013
        - Replace Path::Tiny with File::Spec, because the former's list of dependencies is soooo long :-(.
                Changed files: t/02.main.t, t/04.utf8.t, Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
                See: RT#88435 (for Tree::DAG_Node) for an explanation.
 
 2.15  Sun Aug  4 14:59:00 2013
        - Clean up the shambolic dates in this file.
        - Add a note under Caveats about setting options more that once. Only the first case is respected.
                Thanx to Kimmel K. See RT#69795.
        - Add a $encoding parameter to read_file() and write_file(). See docs for details.
                Add t/04.utf8.t and t/04.utf8.txt.
                Thanx to Mark Lawrence and Wolfgang Husmann. See RT#71029 and RT#85571.
        - For BSD-based systems, when writing a file during tests, use:
                my($temp_dir) = File::Temp -> newdir('temp.XXXX', CLEANUP => 1, EXLOCK => 0, TMPDIR => 1);
        - Rename t/*.t files. I use '.' rather than '_' in file names because the latter is a shift char.
        - Add MANIFEST.SKIP, Changelog.ini, Build.PL, META.json.
        - Add an FAQ to the docs.
        - Clean up the docs.
