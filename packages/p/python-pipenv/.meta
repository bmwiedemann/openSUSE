  <description>Pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds
(bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world.

It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects,
as well as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall
packages. It also generates the everâ€“important Pipfile.lock, which is
used to produce deterministic builds.
