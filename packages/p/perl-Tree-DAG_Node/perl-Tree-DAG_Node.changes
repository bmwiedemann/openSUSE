  - Replace the discouraged File::Slurp::Tiny with File::Slurper.
  Thanx to Marcel Telka for the report.
  But why not use File::Slurp? Because...

 1.31  2018-02-14T09:08:00
      - Clarify licence issue by changing the reference in the
        DAG_Node.pm file from Artistic V 2 to Perl, so it now
        matches what I preemptively put in Makefile.PL and the
        LICENSE file.
      - Sean Burke has kindly agreed to this change.
        $thanx x $many to Gregor Herrmann (Debian Perl Group) for
        reporting this via github.

Fri Mar 14 06:09:54 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.22
        - t/read.tree.t was still using File::Slurp :-(.
 
 1.21  Thu Feb 13 11:14:00 2014
        - Switch from File::Slurp to File::Slurp::Tiny, on the advice of Karen Etheridge. See RT#92976.
 
 1.20  Fri Jan 31 09:46:00 2014
        - After a private email from Paul Howarth (yea!) I see I need File::Temp V 0.19 because that's
                the version which introduced the newdir() method, as used in the test suite. Sorry for the churn.
 
 1.19  Thu Jan 30 09:24:00 2014
        - Set pre-req File::Temp version # to 0 (back from 0.2301). See D A Golden's blog entry:
                http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2293/why-installing-distzilla-is-slow-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/.

Fri Oct  4 09:12:08 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.18
        - No changes, code or otherwise, except for the version # in the *.pm, this file, and Changelog.ini.
        - Somehow a corrupted version got uploaded to search.cpan.org, so I've just changed the version #.
                The file on MetaCPAN was fine.
        - Thanx to Rob (Sisyphus) for reporting this.
 
 1.17  Mon Sep 16 15:24:00 2013
        - Write test temp files in :raw mode as well as utf-8, for MS Windows users.
        - Take the opportunity to change all utf8 to utf-8, as per the docs for Encode,
                except for 'use warnings  qw(FATAL utf8);', which doesn't accept utf-8 :-(.
 
 1.16  Mon Sep  9 09;26:00 2013
        - Accept a patch (slightly modified by me) from Tom Molesworth (see RT#88501):
                Remove 'use open qw(:std :utf8);' because of its global effect.
                Replace Perl6::Slurp with File::Slurp, using the latter's binmode option for the encoding.
                Fix docs where I'd erroneously said File::Slurp didn't support utf8.
 
 1.15  Fri Sep  6 11:10:00 2013
        - Replace Path::Tiny with File::Spec, because the former's list of dependencies is soooo long :-(.
                Changed files: t/read.tree.t, Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
                See: RT#88435 for an explanation.
        - Move t/pod.t to xt/author/pod.t.
 
 1.14  Wed Sep  4 13:44:00 2013
        - Document the copy() method.
        - Patch the copy() method so it respects the {no_attribute_copy => 1} option.
        - Add method read_tree(), for text files. It uses Perl6::Slurp (which supports utf8).
        - Add methods read_attributes() and string2hashref($s) for use by read_tree().
        - Add t/read.tree.t to test read_tree().
        - Add t/tree.utf8.attrbiutes.txt, in utf8, for use by t/read.tree.t.
        - Add t/tree.with.attributes.txt and t/tree.without.attributes.txt for use by t/read.tree.t.
        - Make Perl V 5.8.1 a pre-req so we have access to the utf8 pragma.
 
 1.13  Mon Aug 12 17:16:00 2013
        - Change the values accepted for the no_attributes option from undef and 1 to 0 and 1.
                If undef is used, it becomes 0, so pre-existing code will not change behaviour.
                This makes it easier to pass 0 or 1 from the command line, since there is no default value available.

Sat Jul 27 11:58:09 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.12
      - Change text in README referring to licence to match text in body of source, since it was in conflict
              with the Artistic Licence V 2.0.
              This was requested by Petr Pisar who packages stuff for Red Hat.
      - Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::SPEC.
      - Various spelling fixes in the docs, as kindly reported by dsteinbrunner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  4 15:24:17 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.11
       - Correct the date (2012 -> 2013) in this file used for V 1.10.
       - Correct the text at L<Tree::DAG_Node/AUTHOR> so it refers to Artistic License 2.0,
               which now matches what it says in Build.PL and Makefile.PL. Resolves RT#83088.

       - Change t/pod.t to look for Test::Pod 1.45, but comment out Test::Pod in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
               This means Test::Pod is not used at all if it is not installed. As per RT#83077.

       - For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
               Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.

       - New maintainer: Ron Savage
       - Pre-emptive apologies for any changes which are not back-compat. No such problems are expected, but the
               introduction of new methods may disconcert some viewers.
       - Fix RT#78858, reported by Gene Boggs. Audit code for similar problems.
       - Fix RT#79506. reported by Ron Savage.
       - Rename ChangeLog to CHANGES, and add Changelog.ini.
       - Replace all uses of cyclicity_fault() and Carp::croak with die.
       - Remove unused methods: decommission_root(), cyclicity_allowed(), cyclicity_fault(), inaugurate_root(),
               no_cyclicity() and _update_links(). OK - cyclicity_fault() was called once. It just died.
       - Add methods: format_node(), hashref2string(), is_root(), node2string(), tree2string().
               tree2string($opts, $node) - unlike draw_ascii_tree() - can optionally print the tree starting at any node.
               Override format_node(), hashref2string(), and node2string() if desired.
       - Reformat the POD big-time.
       - Add Build.PL.
       - Re-write Makefile.PL.
       - Remove use vars(@ISA $Debug $VERSION). Replace latter 2 with 'our ...'.
       - Rename t/00_about_verbose.t to t/about.perl.t.
       - Add scripts/cut.and.paste.subtrees.pl. Warning: Some trees get into an infinite loop.
       - Add t/cut.and.paste.subtrees.t.        Warning: Some trees get into an infinite loop.
       - Document the options (discouraged by Sean) supported in the call to new($hashref).
