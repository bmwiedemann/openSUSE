%description
MCE spawns a pool of workers and therefore does not fork a new process per
each element of data. Instead, MCE follows a bank queuing model. Imagine
the line being the data and bank-tellers the parallel workers. MCE enhances
that model by adding the ability to chunk the next n elements from the
input stream to the next available worker.
