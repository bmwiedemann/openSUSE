  1.863 Sun Nov 26 20:00:00 EST 2019
  
    * On Cygwin, silently use Mutex in MCE::Channel when Threads is specified
      for better performance.
  
    * New defer capability in MCE::Signal. This applies to MCE::Shared 1.863.
      See POD section labled "DEFER SIGNAL" in MCE::Signal.
  
    * Reverted $child->exit back to sending the SIGQUIT signal in MCE::Child
      now that MCE::Shared::Server 1.863 defers signal during IPC.
  
    * Improved reliability for spawning MCE and MCE::Child inside threads
      including nested parallelization, made possible using a global lock
      $MCE::_GMUTEX.
  
    * Updated signal handling in mce-examples/framebuffer on GitHub.

  1.844 Wed Aug 14 21:30:00 EST 2019
  
    * Resolved MCE stalling when specifying max_retries with init_relay.
      Ditto for loop_timeout with init_relay on UNIX platforms.
      Thank you, Chris Denley.
  
    * Enhanced loop_timeout to handle workers dieing uncontrollably from
      any user_tasks (i.e. task_id >= 0). Previously, only task_id == 0.
  
    * Improved IPC on the Windows platform for edge case when a worker is
      awaiting input while the manager process is restarting a worker.
  
    * MCE, MCE::Child workers exit immediately upon receiving a SIGSEGV signal.
      This safeguards IPC from stalling inside the manager process.
  
    * Enhanced the _wait_one private function in MCE::Child.
  
    * Removed Prima from the list for auto-enabling the posix_exit option.
      Prima (since 1.52) is parallel safe during global cleanup.
  
    * Reached 100% Pod coverage.

  1.841 Sun Jul 07 23:30:00 EST 2019
  
    * Disabled t/04_channel_threads testing on Unix platforms for Perl less than
      5.10.1. Basically, the MCE::Channel::Threads implementation is not supported
      on older Perls unless the OS vendor applied upstream patches (i.e. works on
      RedHat/CentOS 5.x running Perl 5.8.x).
  
    * Added LIMITATIONS section to MCE::Channel::Threads.
  
  1.840 Sun Jul 07 05:00:00 EST 2019
  
    * Update MCE::Channel POD documentation.
  
  1.839 Sun Jul 07 04:30:00 EST 2019
  
    [NEW FEATURES]
  
    * Added MCE::Mutex::Channel2 providing two locks using a single channel.
      The secondary lock is accessible by calling methods with the '2' suffix.
      E.g. primary mutex ->lock, ->unlock; secondary mutex ->lock2, ->unlock2
  
    * Added MCE::Channel providing queue-like and two-way communication
      supporting threads and processes.
  
    * Added MCE::Child and compatibility with Perl 5.8. MCE::Child is based on
      MCE::Hobo, but using MCE::Channel for data retrieval without involving
      a shared-manager process.
  
    * Added MCE::Channel examples { channel1.pl and channel2.pl } using
      threads and MCE::Child respectively.
      https://github.com/marioroy/mce-examples/tree/master/chameneos
  
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
    * IPC update; removed unnecessary overhead including private methods
      _sysseek and _syswrite from MCE::Util (no longer needed).
  
    * Improved MCE->do, now callable by workers and the manager process.
  
    * Updated MCE::{ Flow, Grep, Loop, Map, Step, and Stream } documentation
      on passing an array reference versus a list for deeply input data.
  
    * Updated and re-organized the top-level MCE documentation, particularly
      improved clarity for the 'MCE Models' section.
  
    * Removed MANIFEST.SKIP.

    * Seeds the Math::Random::MT::Auto generator automatically when present
      for non-threads, similarly to Math::Random and Math::Prime::Util, to
      avoid child processes sharing the same seed value as the parent and
      each other. The new seed is computed using the current seed.

    * Improved running MCE with PDL.
  
    * Refactored logic for MCE->do, bi-directional callback feature.
    * Preserve lexical type for numbers during IPC: MCE->do and MCE::Queue.
  
    * No longer loads threads on the Windows platform in MCE::Signal.
      This enables MCE::Hobo 1.827 to spin faster, including lesser
      memory consumption. Threads isn't required to run MCE::Hobo.

  1.826 Sun Apr 02 23:00:00 EST 2017
  
    * Is now safe running MCE with the Wx GUI toolkit (wxWidgets).
  
  1.825 Sun Apr 02 07:00:00 EST 2017
  
    * Updated MCE::Queue. The following provides a comparison for the
      enhancements made regarding IPC during 1.822 through 1.825, in order
      to run on machines having "many" cores. I ran with 12, 96, and 192
      workers on an 8 core box.
  
      A. MCE queue, dequeue 100k items.
  
         my $Q = MCE::Queue->new();
  
         $Q->enqueue( 1 .. 100000 );
         $Q->end();    MCE 1.608 $Q->enqueue((undef) x 12, 96, or 192);
  
         MCE->new(
             max_workers => 12, 96, or 192,
             user_func   => sub {
                 while ( defined ( my $item = $Q->dequeue ) ) {
                     ;
                 }
             }
         )->run();
  
         MCE 1.608:  12 ~ 1.799 secs  96 ~ 8.702 secs  192 ~ 18.083 secs
         MCE 1.821:     ~ 1.450 secs     ~ 5.231 secs      ~  8.102 secs
         MCE 1.825:     ~ 0.976 secs     ~ 1.067 secs      ~  1.509 secs
  
      B. Input file containing 250k lines ( 300 MiB ).
  
         MCE->new(
             input_data  => "/dev/shm/file_250k.txt",
             max_workers => 12, 96, or 192,
             chunk_size  => 1,
             use_slurpio => 1,
             user_func   => sub { }
         )->run();
  
         MCE 1.608:  12 ~ 3.605 secs  96 ~ 8.074 secs  192 ~ 8.465 secs
         MCE 1.821:     ~ 3.613 secs     ~ 8.058 secs      ~ 8.607 secs
         MCE 1.825:     ~ 3.567 secs     ~ 2.601 secs      ~ 3.199 secs
  
      C. Sequence of numbers from 1 to 200k.
  
         MCE->new(
             sequence    => [ 1, 200000 ],
             max_workers => 12, 96, or 192,
             chunk_size  => 1,
             user_func   => sub { }
         )->run();
  
         MCE 1.608:  12 ~ 1.236 secs  96 ~ 2.922 secs  192 ~ 3.113 secs
         MCE 1.821:     ~ 1.227 secs     ~ 2.915 secs      ~ 3.106 secs
         MCE 1.825:     ~ 1.250 secs     ~ 1.203 secs      ~ 1.581 secs
  
    * Results were captured on a fast 8 core system running CentOS Linux 7.
      The thing to take from this is that running many workers "no longer"
      results in up to 5.6x penalty regarding IPC.
  
  1.824 Sat Apr 01 01:00:00 EST 2017
  
    * Completed validation for running MCE on a box having 100+ cores.
  
    * Tuned the number of data-channels for IPC. Set upper limit in
      MCE::Core::Input::{ Handle and Sequence } to not impact the
      OS kernel. The result is better performance, yet graceful.

      Thank you, Charles Hendry for raising the issue.
  
  1.818 Wed Mar 01 22:00:00 EST 2017
  
    * Updated bin/mce_grep for determining chunk level. Ditto for chunk size.
      Fixed an issue for not seeing STDERR output with '--chunk-level=file'.
      Added support for zgrep, zegrep, and zfgrep. Thank you, Jeff Rouse.
  
    * Changed Sereal to Sereal::Decoder and Sereal::Encoder in recommends
      section inside Makefile and META files.

    * Improved bin/mce_grep. When -r is specified and zero paths are given,
      start recursively in the current directory versus await data from STDIN.
      Set chunk-level accordingly to list mode.

    * Refactored code for the interval option by moving the code to the manager
      process. This allows the manager process to accomodate the next available
      worker and ready to run. Previoulsy, a worker taking a long time resulted
      in empty time slots. Thank you, Philippe Baumgart for your patience.
  
    * Revised the description on posix_exit in MCE::Core.pod.
