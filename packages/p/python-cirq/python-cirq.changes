- Update to 1.1.0
  * This Cirq release focuses on tracking and improving performance
    of key workflows like circuit construction, parameter
    resolution etc. The release also adds a new transformers
    framework for qubit routing and provides an efficient
    implementation of the qubit routing algorithm described in
    arXiv:1902.08091 [quant-ph]
  ## Backwards Incompatible Changes
  * 7892143 Print multi-qubit circuit with asymmetric depolarizing
    noise correctly (#5931) by Paige
  * af1267d Allow repeated measurements in deferred transformer
    (#5857) by Dax Fohl
  ## What's New
  * New top level objects in cirq-core:
    - RoutingSwapTag
    - AbstractInitialMapper
    - HardCodedInitialMapper
    - LineInitialMapper
    - MappingManager
    - RouteCQC
    - routed_circuit_with_mapping
- Add subpackage for cirq_core[contrib]
- Enable -rigetti package: pyquil and all its dependants are
  available (gh#quantumlib/Cirq#5681)
- Drop fix-tests.patch
- Add cirq-pr5991-np1.24.patch -- gh#quantumlib/Cirq#5991

- Update to 1.0.0:

    Cirq has officially left alpha and is v1.0. With this release comes new
    policies on API stability as well as functionality gaurantees for the long
    term. Along with some minor bug fixes and tweaks, this release focuses on
    stabilizing the APIs within cirq-core. With cirq-core we intend to follow
    along with semver and only make breaking changes with moves to new major
    versions. For the vendor packages we plan to continue to allow developers
    to iterate at speed and will do best effort on ensuring any API changes
    come with as little friction as possible. For all the details on this
    policy please see: release.md.

  * Full changelog from v0.13.1 can be found in github:
    https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/releases

- Add patch fix-tests.patch based on upstream PR: gh#quantumlib/Cirq#5911
- Delete 4636.patch not needed anymore
- Delete 4873.patch not needed anymore
- Disable test_version because the version is not updated in the current
  release tests

Mon Feb 21 04:26:32 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v0.13.1
  * Big Changelog since v0.9:
    https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/releases
  * Breaking API and usability changes
  * New modular structure: main metapackage with standalone
    subpackages as dependencies
- cirq-rigetti disabled for now: not all dependencies are available
- add 4873.patch gh#quantumlib/Cirq#4873 -- pandas compatibility

- Skip python36: There are NEP 29 packages in the dependencies.
- Don't try to build this noarch package in i586, because quimb is
  not available for that

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 19 15:42:41 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Initail package release.
- Ignore test dev_tools/bash_scripts_test.py because it cannot be
  reproduce and has no effect on package validity.
