- Update to 1.0.0:

    Cirq has officially left alpha and is v1.0. With this release comes new
    policies on API stability as well as functionality gaurantees for the long
    term. Along with some minor bug fixes and tweaks, this release focuses on
    stabilizing the APIs within cirq-core. With cirq-core we intend to follow
    along with semver and only make breaking changes with moves to new major
    versions. For the vendor packages we plan to continue to allow developers
    to iterate at speed and will do best effort on ensuring any API changes
    come with as little friction as possible. For all the details on this
    policy please see: release.md.
