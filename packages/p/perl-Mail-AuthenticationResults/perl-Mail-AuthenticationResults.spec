%description
Object Oriented Authentication-Results email headers.

This parser copes with most styles of Authentication-Results header seen in
the wild, but is not yet fully RFC7601 compliant

Differences from RFC7601

key/value pairs are parsed when present in the authserv-id section, this is
against RFC but has been seen in headers added by Yahoo!.

Comments added between key/value pairs will be added after them in the data
structures and when stringified.

It is a work in progress..
