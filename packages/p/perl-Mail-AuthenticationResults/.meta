  <title>perl-Mail-AuthenticationResults: Object Oriented Authentication-Results Headers</title>
  <description>This parser copes with most styles of Authentication-Results header seen in the wild, but is not yet fully RFC7601 compliant

Differences from RFC7601

key/value pairs are parsed when present in the authserv-id section, this is against RFC but has been seen in headers added by Yahoo!.

Comments added between key/value pairs will be added after them in the data structures and when stringified.
