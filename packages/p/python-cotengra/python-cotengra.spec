%description
A python library for contracting tensor networks or einsum expressions involving large numbers of tensors.
Some of the key feautures of cotengra include:
 * drop-in einsum replacement
 * an explicit contraction tree object that can be flexibly built, modified and visualized
 * a 'hyper optimizer' that samples trees while tuning the generating meta-paremeters
 * dynamic slicing for massive memory savings and parallelism
 * support for hyper edge tensor networks and thus arbitrary einsum equations
 * paths that can be supplied to numpy.einsum, opt_einsum, quimb among others
 * performing contractions with tensors from many libraries via cotengra, even if they don't provide einsum
   or tensordot but do have (batch) matrix multiplication
