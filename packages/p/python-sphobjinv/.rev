    <comment>- update to 2.3.1:
  * The printout of the inferred `intersphinx_mapping` item for
    inventories retrieved by URL (`--url`) in the 'suggest' CLI
    mode is now relocated to fall immediately below the
    inventory-search output.
  * The 'suggest' CLI mode output now includes dividers for
    improved readability.
  * `MANIFEST.in` was revised in order to provide a testable
    (`pytest --nonloc`)
  * sdist, in order to streamline packaging of `sphobjinv` for
    conda-forge.
  * The version constraint for `pytest-check` was raised to
    `&gt;=1.1.2`.
  * The CLI now prints the project name and version for the
    `objects.inv` as  part of the 'suggest' mode output.
  * The CLI now prints an inferred `intersphinx_mapping` entry
    for a remote docset as part of the 'suggest' mode output,
    where such inference is possible. The output from this mapping
    inference was added to the relevant tests, and a couple of
    unit tests on some basic pieces of functionality were
    written.
  * The CLI now provides considerably more information about what
    is happening with the URLs it checks when trying to retrieve a
    remote inventory.
  * CLI 'suggest' results output now displays more information
    about the total number of objects in the inventory, the search
    score threshold, and the number of results falling at/above
    that threshold.
  * A new CLI option, `-p`/`--paginate`, enables paging of the
    results from the `suggest` feature. (#70)</comment>
