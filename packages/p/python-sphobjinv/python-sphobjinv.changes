- Update to version 2.2.2
  * CLI 'suggest' results output now displays more information
    about the total number of objects in the inventory, the search
    score threshold, and the number of results falling at/above
    that threshold.
  * UnicodeDecodeErrors are ignored within the vendored fuzzywuzzy
    package during suggest operations, using the errors=replace
    mode within bytes.decode().
  * This misbehavior emerged after vendoring fuzzywuzzy, suggesting
    that it was a bug fixed later on in that project's development,
    after the point from which it was vendored.
  * This change may alter suggest behavior for those inventory
    objects with pathological characters. But, given their rarity,
    user experience is not expected to be noticeably affected.
- Release 2.2
  * Acceleration of the suggest functionality via use of
    python-Levenshtein is no longer possible due to the vendoring
    of an early, MIT-licensed version of fuzzywuzzy, as noted
    below. The speedup install extra is now obsolete, and has been
    removed.
  * The fuzzywuzzy string matcher was vendored into the project
    from a point in its development history before the
    python-Levenshtein dependency, and its corresponding GPL
    encumbrance, was introduced.
  * Active support for Python 3.11 added.
- Release 2.1
  * Python 3.10 support was officially added.
  * The User-Agent header sent by Inventory when making an HTTP(S)
    request now identifies sphobjinv and its version (anticipate no
    API or behavior change).
  * An extraneous newline was removed before tables printed in the
    'suggest' CLI mode (cosmetic change).
  * Previously, sphobjinv.Inventory would ignore entries in
    objects.inv that contained spaces within name (see #181); this
    is now fixed.
  * Python 3.5 is no longer supported.
  * The relaxation of the integer constraint on the priority field
    introduced in v2.1b1 has been reverted, as objects.inv data
    lines with such non-integer priority values are skipped by
    Sphinx.
  * Equality tests on Inventory and DataObjStr/DataObjBytes
    instances now work correctly.
  * Non-integer and non-numeric values for priority are now
    accepted during Inventory instantiation, consistent with what
    is allowed by DataObjStr and DataObjBytes instantiation.
  * When an inventory is retrieved via CLI from a remote URL with
    -u, the resolved location of the inventory is included in
    generated JSON at json_dict.metadata.url.
  * CLI logging messages are now emitted to stderr instead of
    stdout.
  * A hyphen can now be passed as the CLI input and/or output file
    name to instruct sphobjinv to use stdin and/or stdout,
    respectively.
  * The fileops and inventory APIs are now tested to work with both
    strings and pathlib.Path objects, where they interact with the
    filesystem.
