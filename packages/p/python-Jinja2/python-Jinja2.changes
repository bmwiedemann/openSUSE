- update to 2.11.3  
  * Improve the speed of the urlize filter by reducing regex backtracking. 
    Email matching requires a word character at the start of the domain part
    and only word characters in the TLD (CVE-2020-28493 bsc#1181944).  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  4 09:35:51 UTC 2020 - Johannes Grassler <johannes.grassler@suse.com>

- update to 2.11.2
  * Fix a bug that caused callable objects with __getattr__, like
    :class:~unittest.mock.Mock to be treated as a
    :func:contextfunction. :issue:1145
  * Update wordcount filter to trigger :class:Undefined methods
    by wrapping the input in :func:soft_unicode. :pr:1160
  * Fix a hang when displaying tracebacks on Python 32-bit.
    :issue:1162
  * Showing an undefined error for an object that raises
    AttributeError on access doesn't cause a recursion error.
    :issue:1177
  * Revert changes to :class:~loaders.PackageLoader from 2.10 which
    removed the dependency on setuptools and pkg_resources, and added
    limited support for namespace packages. The changes caused issues
    when using Pytest. Due to the difficulty in supporting Python 2 and
    :pep:451 simultaneously, the changes are reverted until 3.0.
    :pr:1182
  * Fix line numbers in error messages when newlines are stripped.
    :pr:1178
  * The special namespace() assignment object in templates works in
    async environments. :issue:1180
  * Fix whitespace being removed before tags in the middle of lines when
    lstrip_blocks is enabled. :issue:1138
  * :class:~nativetypes.NativeEnvironment doesn't evaluate
    intermediate strings during rendering. This prevents early
    evaluation which could change the value of an expression.
    :issue:1186

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 18 17:26:13 UTC 2020 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>
 
- update to 2.11.1
 * Fix a bug that prevented looking up a key after an attribute
   ({{ data.items[1:] }}) in an async template
 * Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.3, and 3.4. This will be the last version
   to support Python 2.7 and 3.5.
 * Added a new ChainableUndefined class to support getitem and getattr
   on an undefined object.
 * Allow {%+ syntax (with NOP behavior) when lstrip_blocks is disabled.
 * Added a default parameter for the map filter.
 * Exclude environment globals from meta.find_undeclared_variables().
 * Float literals can be written with scientific notation, like 2.56e-3.
 * Int and float literals can be written with the ‘_’ separator
   for legibility, like 12_345.
 * Fix a bug causing deadlocks in LRUCache.setdefault
 * The trim filter takes an optional string of characters to trim.
 * A new jinja2.ext.debug extension adds a {% debug %} tag to quickly dump
   the current context and available filters and tests.
 * Lexing templates with large amounts of whitespace is much faster.
 * Parentheses around comparisons are preserved, so {{ 2 * (3 < 5) }} outputs
   “2” instead of “False”.
 * Add new boolean, false, true, integer and float tests.
 * The environment’s finalize function is only applied to the output of expressions
   (constant or not), not static template data.
 * When providing multiple paths to FileSystemLoader, a template can have
   the same name as a directory.
 * Always return Undefined when omitting the else clause in a {{ 'foo' if bar }}
   expression, regardless of the environment’s undefined class. Omitting
   the else clause is a valid shortcut and should not raise an error when using
   StrictUndefined.
 * Fix behavior of loop control variables such as length and revindex0 when
   looping over a generator.
 * Async support is only loaded the first time an environment enables it,
   in order to avoid a slow initial import.
 * In async environments, the |map filter will await the filter call if needed.
 * In for loops that access loop attributes, the iterator is not advanced ahead
   of the current iteration unless length, revindex, nextitem, or last are accessed.
   This makes it less likely to break groupby results.
 * In async environments, the loop attributes length and revindex work for async iterators.
 * In async environments, values from attribute/property access will be awaited if needed.
 * PackageLoader doesn’t depend on setuptools or pkg_resources.
 * PackageLoader has limited support for PEP 420 namespace packages.
 * Support os.PathLike objects in FileSystemLoader and ModuleLoader
 * NativeTemplate correctly handles quotes between expressions. "'{{ a }}', '{{ b }}'"
   renders as the tuple ('1', '2') rather than the string '1, 2'.
 * Creating a NativeTemplate directly creates a NativeEnvironment instead
   of a default Environment.
 * After calling LRUCache.copy(), the copy’s queue methods point to the correct queue.
 * Compiling templates always writes UTF-8 instead of defaulting to the system encoding.
 * |wordwrap filter treats existing newlines as separate paragraphs to be wrapped
   individually, rather than creating short intermediate lines.
 * Add break_on_hyphens parameter to |wordwrap filter.
 * Cython compiled functions decorated as context functions will be passed the context.
 * When chained comparisons of constants are evaluated at compile time,
   the result follows Python’s behavior of returning False if any comparison
   returns False, rather than only the last one
 * Tracebacks for exceptions in templates show the correct line numbers
   and source for Python >= 3.7.
 * Tracebacks for template syntax errors in Python 3 no longer show
   internal compiler frames
 * Add a DerivedContextReference node that can be used by extensions to get
   the current context and local variables such as loop
 * Constant folding during compilation is applied to some node types
   that were previously overlooked
 * TemplateSyntaxError.source is not empty when raised from an included template.
 * Passing an Undefined value to get_template (such as through extends, import,
   or include), raises an UndefinedError consistently. select_template will show
   the undefined message in the list of attempts rather than the empty string.
 * TemplateSyntaxError can be pickled.

  * "SandboxedEnvironment" securely handles "str.format_map" in order
    to prevent code execution through untrusted format strings.  The
    sandbox already handled "str.format".

- specfile:
  * CHANGES -> CHANGES.rst
  * added README.rst to %doc section

- update to version 2.10:
  * Added a new extension node called "OverlayScope" which can be used
    to create an unoptimized scope that will look up all variables
    from a derived context.
  * Added an "in" test that works like the in operator.  This can be
    used in combination with "reject" and "select".
  * Added "previtem" and "nextitem" to loop contexts, providing access
    to the previous/next item in the loop. If such an item does not
    exist, the value is undefined.
  * Added "changed(*values)" to loop contexts, providing an easy way
    of checking whether a value has changed since the last iteration
    (or rather since the last call of the method)
  * Added a "namespace" function that creates a special object which
    allows attribute assignment using the "set" tag.  This can be used
    to carry data across scopes, e.g. from a loop body to code that
    comes after the loop.
  * Added a "trimmed" modifier to "{% trans %}" to strip linebreaks
    and surrounding whitespace. Also added a new policy to enable this
    for all "trans" blocks.
  * The "random" filter is no longer incorrectly constant folded and
    will produce a new random choice each time the template is
    rendered. (`#478`_)
  * Added a "unique" filter. (`#469`_)
  * Added "min" and "max" filters. (`#475`_)
  * Added tests for all comparison operators: "eq", "ne", "lt", "le",
    "gt", "ge". (`#665`_)
  * "import" statement cannot end with a trailing comma. (`#617`_,
    `#618`_)
  * "indent" filter will not indent blank lines by default. (`#685`_)
  * Add "reverse" argument for "dictsort" filter. (`#692`_)
  * Add a "NativeEnvironment" that renders templates to native Python
    types instead of strings. (`#708`_)
  * Added filter support to the block "set" tag. (`#489`_)
  * "tojson" filter marks output as safe to match documented behavior.
    (`#718`_)
  * Resolved a bug where getting debug locals for tracebacks could
    modify template context.
  * Fixed a bug where having many "{% elif ... %}" blocks resulted in
    a "too many levels of indentation" error.  These blocks now
    compile to native "elif ..:" instead of "else: if ..:" (`#759`_)

- Update to 2.9.5 (bsc#1132174, CVE-2016-10745)
  (see the changes in /usr/share/doc/packages/python-Jinja2/CHANGES)
- updated source URL

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 19 13:18:12 UTC 2015 - aplanas@suse.com

- Update to 2.8
  - Added `target` parameter to urlize function.
  - Added support for `followsymlinks` to the file system loader.
  - The truncate filter now counts the length.
  - Added equalto filter that helps with select filters.
  - Changed cache keys to use absolute file names if available
    instead of load names.
  - Fixed loop length calculation for some iterators.
  - Changed how Jinja2 enforces strings to be native strings in
    Python 2 to work when people break their default encoding.
  - Added :func:`make_logging_undefined` which returns an undefined
    object that logs failures into a logger.
  - If unmarshalling of cached data fails the template will be
    reloaded now.
  - Implemented a block ``set`` tag.
  - Default cache size was incrased to 400 from a low 50.
  - Fixed ``is number`` test to accept long integers in all Python versions.
  - Changed ``is number`` to accept Decimal as a number.
  - Added a check for default arguments followed by non-default arguments. This
    change makes ``{% macro m(x, y=1, z) %}...{% endmacro %}`` a syntax error. The
    previous behavior for this code was broken anyway (resulting in the default
    value being applied to `y`).
  - Add ability to use custom subclasses of ``jinja2.compiler.CodeGenerator`` and
    ``jinja2.runtime.Context`` by adding two new attributes to the environment
    (`code_generator_class` and `context_class`) (pull request ``#404``).
  - added support for context/environment/evalctx decorator functions on
    the finalize callback of the environment.
  - escape query strings for urlencode properly.  Previously slashes were not
    escaped in that place.
  - Add 'base' parameter to 'int' filter.
- Tests are removed from the package (not distributed in the tar.gz)

- update to 2.7.1:
 - Fixed a bug with ``call_filter`` not working properly on environment
   and context filters.
 - Fixed lack of Python 3 support for bytecode caches.
 - Reverted support for defining blocks in included templates as this
   broke existing templates for users.
 - Fixed some warnings with hashing of undefineds and nodes if Python
   is run with warnings for Python 3.
 - Added support for properly hashing undefined objects.
 - Fixed a bug with the title filter not working on already uppercase
   strings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 14:37:06 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 2.7:
  - Choice and prefix loaders now dispatch source and template lookup
    separately in order to work in combination with module loaders as
    advertised.
  - Fixed filesizeformat.
  - Added a non-silent option for babel extraction.
  - Added `urlencode` filter that automatically quotes values for
    URL safe usage with utf-8 as only supported encoding.  If applications
    want to change this encoding they can override the filter.
  - Added `keep-trailing-newline` configuration to environments and
    templates to optionally preserve the final trailing newline.
  - Accessing `last` on the loop context no longer causes the iterator
    to be consumed into a list.
  - Python requirement changed: 2.6, 2.7 or >= 3.3 are required now,
    supported by same source code, using the "six" compatibility library.
  - Allow `contextfunction` and other decorators to be applied to `__call__`.
  - Added support for changing from newline to different signs in the `wordwrap`
    filter.
  - Added support for ignoring memcache errors silently.
  - Added support for keeping the trailing newline in templates.
  - Added finer grained support for stripping whitespace on the left side
    of blocks.
  - Added `map`, `select`, `reject`, `selectattr` and `rejectattr`
    filters.
  - Added support for `loop.depth` to figure out how deep inside a recursive
    loop the code is.
  - Disabled py_compile for pypy and python 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 20 12:57:24 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 2.6:
  * internal attributes now raise an internal attribute error now instead
    of returning an undefined.  This fixes problems when passing undefined
    objects to Python semantics expecting APIs.
  * traceback support now works properly for PyPy.  (Tested with 1.4)
  * implemented operator intercepting for sandboxed environments.  This
    allows application developers to disable builtin operators for better
    security.  (For instance limit the mathematical operators to actual
    integers instead of longs)
  * groupby filter now supports dotted notation for grouping by attributes
    of attributes.
  * scoped blocks not properly treat toplevel assignments and imports.
    Previously an import suddenly "disappeared" in a scoped block.
  * automatically detect newer Python interpreter versions before loading code
    from bytecode caches to prevent segfaults on invalid opcodes.  The segfault
    in earlier Jinja2 versions here was not a Jinja2 bug but a limitation in
    the underlying Python interpreter.  If you notice Jinja2 segfaulting in
    earlier versions after an upgrade of the Python interpreter you don't have
    to upgrade, it's enough to flush the bytecode cache.  This just no longer
    makes this necessary, Jinja2 will automatically detect these cases now.
  * the sum filter can now sum up values by attribute.  This is a backwards
    incompatible change.  The argument to the filter previously was the
    optional starting index which defaultes to zero.  This now became the
    second argument to the function because it's rarely used.
  * like sum, sort now also makes it possible to order items by attribute.
  * like sum and sort, join now also is able to join attributes of objects
    as string.
  * the internal eval context now has a reference to the environment.
  * added a mapping test to see if an object is a dict or an object with
    a similar interface.
