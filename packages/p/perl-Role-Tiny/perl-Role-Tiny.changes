- updated to 2.002004
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Role-Tiny/Changes

  2.002004 - 2021-01-24
    - restore requiring base class when using create_class_with_roles, which was
      accidentally lost in 2.002_000 (RT#134075)

Tue Jan 12 03:09:13 UTC 2021 - Tina Müller <timueller+perl@suse.de>

- updated to 2.002003
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Role-Tiny/Changes

  2.002003 - 2021-01-11
    - set dynamic_config to 0 and x_static_install to 1
    - fixed filenames in dependents author test to not use colons
    - removed MRO::Compat from prereqs as it is no longer used
    - marked Class::Method::Modifiers as a hard developer dependency rather than
      a recommended developer dependency
    - rewrote test for namespace cleaning to not require namespace::clean, and
      moved it from an author test to a normal test
    - removed namespace::autoclean from developer prereqs
  2.002_002 - 2021-01-03
    - refactored some internals for subclasses to use
    - methods_provided_by will ensure the module is loaded before checking for
      methods
  2.002_001 - 2020-12-27
    - fix tests when Class::Method::Modifiers is not installed
  2.002_000 - 2020-12-23
    - Refactored create_class_with_roles to not use "composable packages". This
      was an optimization for when a role is used in many different uses of
      create_class_with_roles, but required an entirely separate implementation,
      which did not have fully compatible behavior. It would also result in
      methods using modifiers being slower.
    - Add documentation for what methods will be composed from a role
      (RT#133363)
    - Fix backwards compatibility with older versions of Moo when interacting
      with Moose.
    - Treat modifiers as required methods during create_class_with_roles.
    - Fixed methods being no longer composed after they participated in an
      allowed conflict.
    - Dropped use of MRO::Compat.
    - Test cleanups for checking requires during create_class_with_roles.
    - Additional tests to confirm internal role application steps can be fully
      qualified.
    - Fix Pod links to Class::Method::Modifiers
    - Tweaks to author tests
    - Additional tests for working with older Moo versions
    - Additional tests for module loading
    - Allow method modifiers to be specified with an array reference of method
      names, rather than a list. This now matches how the corresponding
      Class::Method::Modifiers subs can be called.
