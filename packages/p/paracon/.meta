  <title>Packet radio terminal using the AGWPE protocol</title>
  <description>Paracon is a packet radio terminal. It is focused on simplicity and ease of
use, and incorporates the core functionality that most packet users need
without trying to include all of the bells and whistles that few would use.

It talks to the TNC using AGWPE and works well with the direwolf software TNC.
If you have a classic KISS or 6PACK TNC you can use the classic Linux native
AX.25 stack with ldsped on top to be able to speak AGWPE.</description>
