      damping factor is applied to bins with an amplitude above the threshold.
    * Added a `callback` argument to PyoObject.set() method. The given callback
      will be executed at the end of the ramp.
    * Added ctrl() method (and some missing setter) to midi objects.

      object and interpolates to fill in gaps if its writing pointer moves faster
      than the sampling rate.
    * Added a reset() method to various delay line-based objects (AllpassWG,
      Chorus, Freeverb, Harmonizer, STRev, WGVerb, Waveguide).
