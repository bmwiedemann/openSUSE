  <title>Collection of C++ functions emulating Python's string class methods</title>
  <description>Pystring is a collection of C++ functions which match the interface and
behavior of Python's string class methods using std::string. Implemented in
C++, it does not require or make use of a Python interpreter. It provides
convenience and familiarity for common string operations not included in the
standard C++ library. It's also useful in environments where both C++ and
Python are used.
	
Overlapping functionality (such as index and slice/substr) of std::string is
included to match Python interfaces.
