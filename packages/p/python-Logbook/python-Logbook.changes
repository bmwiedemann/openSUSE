Fri Jan  6 20:55:50 UTC 2017 - boris@steki.net

- Added support for timezones for log timestamp formatting (thanks Mattijs Ugen)
- Logbook has been a 0.x long enough to earn its 1.0.0 bump!
- Logbook now uses SemVer for its versioning scheme
- Various improvements to MailHandler and the usage of TLS/SMTP SSL (thanks Frazer McLean)
- Fix log colorizing on Windows (thanks Frazer McLean)
- Coverage reports using coveralls.io
- Dropped compatibility for Python 3.2. At this point we did not actually
  remove any code that supports it, but the continuous integration tests
  no longer check against it, and we will no longer fix compatibility issues with 3.2.
- Better coverage and tests on Windows (thanks Frazer McLean)
- Added enable() and disable() methods for loggers (thanks Frazer McLean)
- Many cleanups and overall project improvements (thanks Frazer McLean)

- Added logbook.utils.deprecated to automatically emit warnings when
  certain functions are called (Thanks Ayala Shachar)
- Added logbook.utils.suppressed_deprecations context to temporarily
  suppress deprecations (Thanks Ayala Shachar)
- Added logbook.utils.logged_if_slow to emit logs when certain operations
  exceed a time threshold (Thanks Ayala Shachar)
- Many PEP8 fixes and code cleanups (thanks Taranjeet Singh and Frazer McLean)
- TestHandler constructor now receives an optional force_heavy_init=True,
  forcing all records to heavy-initialize
- Windows-specific fixes and CI configuration (Thanks Frazer McLean)
- Several Unicode-specific fixes (Thanks Frazer McLean)
- Documentation cleanups
- Fix importing issue with SQLAlchemy ticketing handler
- Added TRACE log level for enabling logs below DEBUG
- Improved SQLAlchemy session management (thanks @fintan)
- Removed the bubble argument from NullHandler, preventing many future confusions
- Small bugfix supporting exc_info=False without breaking formatting
- Removed the global handler which was installed by default so far.
  The rationale is to ease adoption for 3rd party libraries who don’t want
  output to go to stderr by default. The old behavior can still be restored
  by setting the LOGBOOK_INSTALL_DEFAULT_HANDLER environment variable
- Added frame correction option, to properly mark log record origins (Thanks Roey Darwish)
- Fixed MailHandler infinite recursion bug (Thanks Tal Yalon)
- Fix support for gevent, along with various other fixes (Thanks Tal Yalon)
- Added Pushover handler (thanks @owo)
- Default logging format now includes seconds and microseconds (#110)
- Several fixes regarding possible deadlocks in log formatting (thanks Guy Rozendorn)
- Fixed packaging so that the speedups module now gets packaged by default (#122)
- ThreadedWrapperHandler now supports maxsize (#121) (thanks Ken Jung)
- Fixes in rotating handlers (thanks zhangliyong)
- Added Pushover handler (thanks Ossama W. Obeid)
- RedisHandler now supports lpush as an option (thanks Bruno Rocha)
- Restored Python 3.2 support (thanks @rnortman)
- NullHandlers now respect filters - allows to only drop/mute certain records (#73)
- redirect_logging now sets the legacy root logger’s level
  to DEBUG by default. This can be changed by specifying set_root_logger_level=False (#96)
- Added Redis handler (Thanks a lot @guillermo-carrasco for this PR)
- Fixed email encoding bug (Thanks Raphaël Vinot)
- Drop 2.5, 3.2 support, code cleanup
- The exc_info argument now accepts True, like in the standard logging modul
- Fixed Python 3.x compatibility, including speedups
- Dropped Python 2.4 support. Python 2.4 support caused a lot of
  hacks in the code and introduced duplication to the test code.
  In addition, it is impossible to cover 2.4-3.x with a single
  tox installation, which may introduce unwitting code breakage.
  Travis also does not support Python 2.4 so the chances of
  accidentally breaking this support were very high as it was...
