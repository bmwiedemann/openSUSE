%description
This modules provides a file handle that hides the beginning of a file.
After opening, the file is positioned at the offset location. 'seek()' and
'tell()' calls are modified to preserve the offset.

For example, 'tell($fh)' will return 0, though the actual file position is
at the offset. Likewise, 'seek($fh,80,0)' will seek to 80 bytes from the
offset instead of 80 bytes from the actual start of the file.
