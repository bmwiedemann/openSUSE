  <title>Powerful command-line bookmark manager. Your mini web!</title>
  <description>buku is a powerful bookmark management utility written in Python3 and SQLite3. When I started writing it, I couldn't find a flexible cmdline solution with a private, portable, merge-able database along with browser integration. Hence, buku (after my son's nickname).

With tagging and multiple options to search bookmarks, including regex and a deep scan mode (particularly for URLs), finding a bookmark is very easy. Multiple search results can be opened in the browser at once.

Though a terminal utility, it's possible to add bookmarks to buku without touching the terminal! Refer to the section on GUI integration. If you prefer the terminal, thanks to the shell completion scripts, you don't need to memorize any of the options. There's an Easter egg to revisit random forgotten bookmarks too.
