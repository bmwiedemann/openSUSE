  <title>Perl Interface to Git Repositories</title>
  <description>Git::Repository is a Perl interface to Git, allowing scripted interactions with
one or more repositories. It's a low-level interface, allowing to call any Git
command, either porcelain  or plumbing, including bidirectional commands such
as git commit-tree.

Since it is a low-level interface, it doesn't provide any fancy way to call Git
commands. It is up to the programmer to setup any environment variables that
the underlying Git command may need and use.
