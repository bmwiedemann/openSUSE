%description
Git::Repository is a Perl interface to Git, for scripted interactions with
repositories. It's a low-level interface that allows calling any Git
command, whether _porcelain_ or _plumbing_, including bidirectional
commands such as 'git commit-tree'.

A Git::Repository object simply provides context to the git commands being
run. It is possible to call the 'command()' and 'run()' methods against the
class itself, and the context (typically _current working directory_) will
be obtained from the options and environment.

As a low-level interface, it provides no sugar for particular Git commands.
Specifically, it will not prepare environment variables that individual Git
commands may need or use.

However, the 'GIT_DIR' and 'GIT_WORK_TREE' environment variables are
special: if the command is run in the context of a Git::Repository object,
they will be overridden by the object's 'git_dir' and 'work_tree'
attributes, respectively. It is still possible to override them if
necessary, using the 'env' option.

Git::Repository requires at least Git 1.5.0, and is expected to support any
later version.

See Git::Repository::Tutorial for more code examples.
