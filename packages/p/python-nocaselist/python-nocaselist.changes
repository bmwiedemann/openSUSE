Fri Dec  1 17:04:19 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.0.0:
  * typing hints
  * Fixed coveralls issues with KeyError and HTTP 422
    Unprocessable Entity.
  * Added support for passing slices to '__setitem__()' and
    '__delitem__()'. Expanded the testcases accordingly.
  * Fixed incorrect error handling when passing objects of
    unsupported types to the right hand operand of the rich
    comparison methods of NocaseList. This previously caused
    AttributeError "'list' object has no attribute 'lower'" and
    TypeError "'int' object is not iterable" to be raised which was
    confusing. This is now handled by returning 'NotImplemented'
    from these methods as recommended by Python, causing TypeError
    with a proper message to be raised by Python.#
  * Resurrected support for byte strings as list values in the
    default implementation of the casefold method. The list can now
    contains unicode strings and byte strings.
  * Added type hints and type checking with MyPy (issue #96).

- update to 1.0.4:
  * Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This required changes
    in several areas including dependent packages used for testing and
    coverage. This did not cause any changes on dependent packages used for the
    installation of the package.
