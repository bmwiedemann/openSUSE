%description
Suds is a lightweight SOAP-based web service client for Python.

Although the original suds package stopped releasing versions after
0.4, many (but not all) other open source projects moved to a
maintained fork known as "suds-jurko". This is a community fork of
that fork that is releasing packages under the main suds package name
(and suds-community for consistency until version 2.x of this
package).
