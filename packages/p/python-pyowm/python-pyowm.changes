- Update to version 2.7.1:
  * New features:
    * introduced support for Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitric Dioxide
      (NO2): new methods owm25.no2index_around_coords and
      owm25.so2index_around_coords
    * implemented wind speed units specification (imperial/metric)

    * updated weather history endpoint (was broken)
    * fix bug about data parsing at station_at_coords and weather_at_station
      methods
    * now the deg attribute is correctly parsed from 16 day forecast
      weather data items
    * fix bug on printing Unicode upon library exceptions
    * fix handling of Weather objects parsing (it was failing whenever
      some data wasn't provided by OWM)

  * Enhancements:
    * shrinked city ID files size by 60% (via compression)
    * reported in the Wiki a list of known projects that use PyOWM
    * integrated the Say Thanks! hook

  * Breaking changes:
    * OWM decided to change the syntax of API endpoint for fetching UV data
      and its format in a non-retrocompatible manner. This results into
      UVIndex object entity fields changing, as well as the corresponding
      OWM25 method signature (owm25.uvindex_around_coords).
