<package name="perl-Data-Hexify" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Perl extension for hexdumping arbitrary data</title>
  <description>This module exports one subroutine: 'Hexify'.

'Hexify' formats arbitrary (possible binary) data into a format suitable
for hex dumps in the style of 'xd' or 'hexl'.

The first, or only, argument to 'Hexify' contains the data, or a reference
to the data, to be hexified. Hexify will return a string that prints as
follows:

  0000: 70 61 63 6b 61 67 65 20 44 61 74 61 3a 3a 48 65  package Data::He
  0010: 78 69 66 79 3b 0a 0a 75 73 65 20 35 2e 30 30 36  xify;..use 5.006

and so on. At the left is the (hexadecimal) index of the data, then a
number of hex bytes, followed by the chunk of data with unprintables
replaced by periods.

The optional second argument to 'Hexify' must be a hash or a hash
reference, containing values for any of the following parameters:

* first

  The first byte of the data to be processed. Default is to start from the
  beginning of the data.

* length

  The number of bytes to be processed. Default is to proceed all data.

* chunk

  The number of bytes to be processed per line of output. Default is 16.

* group

  The number of bytes to be grouped together. Default is 1 (no grouping).
  If used, it must be a divisor of the chunk size.

* duplicates

  When set, duplicate lines of output are suppressed and replaced by a
  single line reading '**SAME**'.

  Duplicate suppression is enabled by default.

* showdata

  A reference to a subroutine that is used to produce a printable string
  from a chunk of data. By default, a subroutine is used that replaces
  unwanted bytes by periods.

  The subroutine gets the chunk of data passed as argument, and should
  return a printable string of at most 'chunksize' characters.

* align

  Align the result to 'chunksize' bytes. This is relevant only when
  processing data not from the beginning. For example, when 'first' is 10,
  the result would become:

    0000:                ...    74 61 3a 3a 48 65            ta::He
    0010: 78 69 66 79 3b ... 65 20 35 2e 30 30 36  xify;..use 5.006
    ... and so on ...

  Alignment is on by default. Without alignment, the result would be:

    000a: 74 61 3a 3a 48 ... 79 3b 0a 0a 75 73 65  ta::Hexify;..use
    001a: 20 35 2e 30 30 ... 73 65 20 73 74 72 69   5.006;.use stri
    ... and so on ...

* start

  Pretend that the data started at this byte (while in reality it starts at
  byte 'first'). The above example, with 'start =&gt; 0', becomes:

    0000: 74 61 3a 3a 48 ... 79 3b 0a 0a 75 73 65  ta::Hexify;..use
    0010: 20 35 2e 30 30 ... 73 65 20 73 74 72 69   5.006;.use stri
    ... and so on ...</description>
