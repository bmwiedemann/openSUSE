  <title>Basic Clients and Utilities for PostgreSQL</title>
  <description>PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, and user-defined
types and functions.

This package contains the basic utility and client programs necessary
to maintain and work with local or remote PostgreSQL databases as well
as manual pages for the SQL commands that PostgreSQL supports. Full
HTML documentation for PostgreSQL can be found in the postgresql-docs
package.
