  <title>Use shorter versions of class names</title>
  <description>aliased is simple in concept but is a rather handy module. It loads the class
you specify and exports into your namespace a subroutine that returns the class
name. You can explicitly alias the class to another name or, if you prefer, you
can do so implicitly. In the latter case, the name of the subroutine is the
last part of the class name.

This module is useful if you prefer a shorter name for a class. It's also handy
if a class has been renamed.
