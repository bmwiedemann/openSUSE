    <comment>- My ad-hoc patch failed_test_use_command.patch replaced by the
  upstream mark-tests-path.patch (from
  gh#pdm-project/pdm#commit/23f1cf62a302 and gh#pdm-project/pdm#865).
- By downgrading python-installer to 0.3 we have eliminated
  number of failed tests.
- Replacing mark-network-tests.patch with the upstream PR
  (gh#pdm-project/pdm#864), which unfortunately leaves a lot of
  tests still failing.
- Add mark-network-tests.patch for skipping network-requiring
  tests (gh#pdm-project/pdm#858). This is a very shotgun
  approach, just mark everything which fails.
- Add sys-exec-failures.patch to fix problems with the version
  number of Python 3.10 (gh#pdm-project/pdm#865).
- Initial packaging effort for pdm 1.12.6</comment>

    <version>2.3.3</version>
    <time>1671635193</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Add missing dependency python-pyproject-hooks
- update to 2.3.3:
  * Allow relative paths in `build-system.requires`, since `build` and
    `hatch` both support it. Be aware it is not allowed in the standard.
  * Strip the local part when building a specifier for comparison with the
    package version. This is not permitted by PEP 508 as implemented by
    `packaging 22.0`.
  * Update the version for check_update after self update
  * Fix the matching problem of packages in the lockfile.
  * Exclude `package==22.0` from the dependencies to avoid some breakages to
    the end users. #1568
  * Fix an installation failure when the RECORD file contains commas in the
    file path. #1010
  * Fallback to `pdm.pep517` as the metadata transformer for unknown custom
    build backends. #1546
  * Fix a bug that Ctrl + C kills the python interactive session instead of
    clearing the current line. #1547
  * Fix a bug with egg segment for local dependency #1552
  * Update `installer` to `0.6.0`. #1550
  * Update minimum version of `unearth` to `0.6.3` and test against
    `packaging==22.0`. #1555
  * Fix a resolution loop issue when the current project depends on itself
    and it uses the dynamic version from SCM. #1541
  * Don't give duplicate results when specifying a relative path for `pdm
    use`. #1542
  * Beautify the error message of build errors. Default to showing the last
    10 lines of the build output. #1491
  * Rename the `tool.pdm.overrides` table to
    `tool.pdm.resolution.overrides`. The old name is deprecated at the same
    time. #1503
  * Add backend selection and `--backend` option to `pdm init` command,
    users can choose a favorite backend from `setuptools`, `flit`,
    `hatchling` and `pdm-pep517`(default), since they all support PEP 621
    standards. #1504
  * Allows specifying the insertion position of user provided arguments in
    scripts with the `{args[:default]}` placeholder. #1507
  * The local package is now treated specially during installation and
    locking. This means it will no longer be included in the lockfile, and
    should never be installed twice even when using nested extras. This will
    ensure the lockdown stays relevant when the version changes. #1481
  * Fix the version diff algorithm of installed packages to consider local
    versions as compatible. #1497
  * Fix the confusing message when detecting a Python interpreter under
    `python.use_venv=False` #1508
  * Fix the test failure with the latest `findpython` installed. #1516
  * Fix the module missing error of pywin32 in a virtualenv with
    `install.cache` set to `true` and caching method is `pth`. #863
  * Drop the dependency `pdm-pep517`. #1504
  * Replace `pep517` with `pyproject-hooks` because of the rename. #1528
  * Remove the support for exporting the project file to a `setup.py`
    format, users are encouraged to migrate to the PEP 621 metadata. #1504
- drop findpython-022.patch (upstream)
