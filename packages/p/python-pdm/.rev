    <comment>- My ad-hoc patch failed_test_use_command.patch replaced by the
  upstream mark-tests-path.patch (from
  gh#pdm-project/pdm#commit/23f1cf62a302 and gh#pdm-project/pdm#865).
- By downgrading python-installer to 0.3 we have eliminated
  number of failed tests.
- Replacing mark-network-tests.patch with the upstream PR
  (gh#pdm-project/pdm#864), which unfortunately leaves a lot of
  tests still failing.
- Add mark-network-tests.patch for skipping network-requiring
  tests (gh#pdm-project/pdm#858). This is a very shotgun
  approach, just mark everything which fails.
- Add sys-exec-failures.patch to fix problems with the version
  number of Python 3.10 (gh#pdm-project/pdm#865).
- Initial packaging effort for pdm 1.12.6</comment>
