Mon Dec 19 11:43:13 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.3.3:
  * Allow relative paths in `build-system.requires`, since `build` and
    `hatch` both support it. Be aware it is not allowed in the standard.
  * Strip the local part when building a specifier for comparison with the
    package version. This is not permitted by PEP 508 as implemented by
    `packaging 22.0`.
  * Update the version for check_update after self update

  * Exclude `package==22.0` from the dependencies to avoid some breakages to

    `packaging==22.0`. #1555

    and it uses the dynamic version from SCM. #1541

    use`. #1542
  * Beautify the error message of build errors. Default to showing the last
    10 lines of the build output. #1491
  * Rename the `tool.pdm.overrides` table to
    `tool.pdm.resolution.overrides`. The old name is deprecated at the same
    time. #1503
  * Add backend selection and `--backend` option to `pdm init` command,
    users can choose a favorite backend from `setuptools`, `flit`,
    `hatchling` and `pdm-pep517`(default), since they all support PEP 621
    standards. #1504
  * Allows specifying the insertion position of user provided arguments in
    scripts with the `{args[:default]}` placeholder. #1507
  * The local package is now treated specially during installation and
    locking. This means it will no longer be included in the lockfile, and
    should never be installed twice even when using nested extras. This will
    ensure the lockdown stays relevant when the version changes. #1481

  * Replace `pep517` with `pyproject-hooks` because of the rename. #1528
  * Remove the support for exporting the project file to a `setup.py`
    format, users are encouraged to migrate to the PEP 621 metadata. #1504

Mon Jan 24 09:37:39 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- My ad-hoc patch failed_test_use_command.patch replaced by the
  upstream mark-tests-path.patch (from
  gh#pdm-project/pdm#commit/23f1cf62a302 and gh#pdm-project/pdm#865).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 23 20:56:10 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- By downgrading python-installer to 0.3 we have eliminated
  number of failed tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 23 00:55:41 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Replacing mark-network-tests.patch with the upstream PR
  (gh#pdm-project/pdm#864), which unfortunately leaves a lot of
  tests still failing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 21 01:35:33 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add mark-network-tests.patch for skipping network-requiring
  tests (gh#pdm-project/pdm#858). This is a very shotgun
  approach, just mark everything which fails.
- Add sys-exec-failures.patch to fix problems with the version
  number of Python 3.10 (gh#pdm-project/pdm#865).
