%description
Vulture finds unused code in Python programs. This is useful for
cleaning up and finding errors in code bases. Running Vulture
on both the library and test suite, untested code can be found.

Due to Python's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like Vulture are
likely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only called implicitly
may be reported as unused.

Features:

* static code analysis
* only one module
* tests itself and has complete test coverage
* complements pyflakes and has the same output syntax
* sorts unused classes and functions by size with ``--sort-by-size``
* supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.x
