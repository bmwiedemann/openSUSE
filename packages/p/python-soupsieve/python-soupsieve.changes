Fri Sep 26 08:45:00 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 2.8
  * Drop support for Python 3.8.
  * Add support for Python 3.14.
  * Deploy with PyPI's "Trusted Publisher".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 14 10:39:01 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 2.7
  * Add :open pseudo selector.
  * Add :muted pseudo selector.
  * Recognize the following pseudo selectors: :autofill, :buffering,
    :fullscreen, :picture-in-picture, :popover-open, :seeking, :stalled,
    and :volume-locked. These selectors, while recognized, will not
    match any element as they require a live environment to check
    element states and browser states. This just prevents Soup Sieve
    from failing when any of these selectors are specified.
  * A number of existing pseudo-classes are no longer noted as experimental.
  * Typing fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 30 19:49:47 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.6:
  * Add official support for Python 3.13.
  * Add support for `&` as scoping root per the CSS
    Nesting Module, Level 1. When `&` is used outside the
  * context of nesting, it is treated as the scoping root
  * Improve error message when an unrecognized pseudo-
    class is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 15 09:49:23 UTC 2024 - Michal Suchanek <msuchanek@suse.com>

- Fix rpmlint warnings on SLE/Leap (jsc#PED-7572)
  * provide description longer than summary
  * Add back group

Tue Oct 10 11:23:48 UTC 2023 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 2.5
 * support Python 3.12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 20:07:18 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.4.1:
  * Attribute syntax for case insensitive flag
    optionally allows a space, it does not require one.
  * Update to support changes related to `:lang()` in
    the official CSS spec. `:lang("")` should match unspecified
  * languages, e.g. `lang=""`, but not `lang=und`.
  * Only `:is()` and `:where()` should allow forgiving
    selector lists according to latest CSS (as far as Soup
  * Sieve supports "forgiving" which is limited to empty
    selectors).
  * Formally drop Python 3.6.
  * Formally declare support for Python 3.11.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 21 12:34:24 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add sle15_python_module_pythons (jsc#PED-68)

  Fix Documentation for installation from source is outdated.
  Fix some typos in error messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 13 20:46:12 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

  * `:has()`, `:is()`, and `:where()` now use use a forgiving selector list.
  * Add support to output a pretty print format of a compiled `SelectorList` for debug purposes.
  * Some small corner cases discovered with static typing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  9 17:07:24 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- udpate to 2.2.1:
  - **FIX**: Fix an issue with namespaces when one of the keys is `self`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  2 00:26:16 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.2.0:
  - **NEW**: `:link` and `:any-link` no longer include `#!html <link>` due to a
    change in the level 4 selector specification. This actually yields more
    sane results.
  - **FIX**: BeautifulSoup, when using `find`, is quite forgiving of odd types
    that a user may place in an element's attribute value. Soup Sieve will also
    now be more forgiving and attempt to match these unexpected values in a sane
    manner by normalizing them before compare. (#212)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 28 23:17:10 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.0:
  - **NEW**: Officially support Python 3.9.
  - **NEW**: Drop official support for Python 3.5.
  - **NEW**: In order to avoid conflicts with future CSS specification changes,
    non-standard pseudo classes will now start with the `:-soup-` prefix. As a
    consequence, `:contains()` will now be known as `:-soup-contains()`, though
    for a time the deprecated form of `:contains()` will still be allowed with
    a warning that users should migrate over to
    `:-soup-contains()`.
   - **NEW**: Added new non-standard pseudo class `:-soup-contains-own()` which
     operates similar to `:-soup-contains()` except that it only looks at text
     nodes directly associated with the currently scoped element and not its
     descendants.
   - **FIX**: Import `bs4` globally instead of in local functions as it appears
     there are no adverse affects due to circular imports as `bs4` does not
     immediately reference `soupsieve` functions and `soupsieve` does not
     immediately reference `bs4` functions. This should give a performance
     boost to functions that had previously included `bs4` locally.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 14 09:12:49 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.0.1:
  - **FIX**: Remove unused code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 17 14:02:24 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.0
  - **NEW**: `SelectorSyntaxError` is derived from `Exception` not `SyntaxError`.
  - **NEW**: Remove deprecated `comments` and `icomments` from the API.
  - **NEW**: Drop support for EOL Python versions (Python 2 and Python < 3.5).
  - **FIX**: Corner case with splitting namespace and tag name that that have an escaped `|`.
  - **FIX**: `:placeholder-shown` should not match if the element has content that overrides the placeholder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 13 13:02:59 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Fix build without python2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 20 18:49:34 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.9.5:
  * **FIX**: `:placeholder-shown` should not match if the element has content
  that overrides the pl aceholder.
  * **FIX**: `:checked` rule was too strict with `option` elements. The
  specification for `:checked ` does not require an `option` element to be under
  a `select` element.
  * **FIX**: Fix level 4 `:lang()` wildcard match handling with singletons.
  Implicit wildcard match ing should not match any singleton. Explicit wildcard
  matching (`*` in the language range: `*-US`) is allowed to match singletons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 10 10:11:45 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.2:
  * FIX: [attr!=value] pattern was mistakenly using :not([attr|=value]) logic instead of :not([attr=value]).
  * FIX: Remove undocumented _QUIRKS mode flag

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 22 12:54:14 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.2:
  * FIX: Shortcut last descendant calculation if possible for performance.
  * FIX: Fix issue where Doctype strings can be mistaken for a normal text node in some cases.
  * FIX: A top level tag is not a :root tag if it has sibling text nodes or tag nodes. This is an issue that mostly manifests when using html.parser as the parser will allow multiple root nodes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 20 08:57:36 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.9.1
  - FIX: `:root`, `:contains()`, `:default`, `:indeterminate`,
    `:lang()`, and `:dir()` will properly account for HTML
    `iframe` elements in their logic when selecting or matching
     an element. Their logic will be restricted to the document
     for which the element under consideration applies.
  - FIX: HTML pseudo-classes will check that all key elements
    checked are in the XHTML namespace (HTML parsers that do
    not provide namespaces will assume the XHTML namespace).
  - FIX: Ensure that all pseudo-class names are case
    insensitive and allow CSS escapes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  5 08:26:37 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.9
  * NEW: Allow :contains() to accept a list of text to search
    for. (#115)
  * NEW: Add new escape function for escaping CSS identifiers. (#125)
  * NEW: Deprecate comments and icomments functions in the API to ensure
    Soup Sieve focuses only in CSS selectors. comments and icomments
    will most likely be removed in 2.0. (#130)
  * NEW: Add Python 3.8 support. (#133)
  * FIX: Don't install test files when installing the soupsieve
    package. (#111)
  * FIX: Improve efficiency of :contains() comparison.
  * FIX: Null characters should translate to the Unicode REPLACEMENT
    CHARACTER (U+FFFD) according to the specification. This applies
    to CSS escaped NULL characters as well. (#124)
  * FIX: Escaped EOF should translate to U+FFFD outside of CSS strings.
    In a string, they should just be ignored, but as there is no case
    where we could resolve such a string and still have a valid selector,
    string handling remains the same. (#128)
