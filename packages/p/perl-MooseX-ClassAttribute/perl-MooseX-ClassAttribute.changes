  - The latest Moose release (2.08) broke this module. This release fixes
    MooseX::ClassAttribute to work with both new and old Mooses. Reported by
    Jonathan Stowe. RT #84263.

- update to 0.26
  - The default() method for class attributes always returned a value, even if
   the default was a subroutine ref, which isn't how the method works for
   regular attributes. This broke inlining with Moose HEAD.

  - Class attributes now have a definition context set, which means that errors
   thrown from generated methods associated with these attributes say something
   like "X at accessor MyClass::ClassAttribute (defined at path/to/file line
   42)" rather than "generated method (unknown origin)".
