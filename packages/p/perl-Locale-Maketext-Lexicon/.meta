  <title>Use other catalog formats in Maketext</title>
  <description>This module provides lexicon-handling modules to read from other
localization formats, such as _Gettext_, _Msgcat_, and so on.

If you are unfamiliar with the concept of lexicon modules, please consult
the Locale::Maketext manpage and the 'webl10n' HTML files in the 'docs/'
directory of this module.

A command-line utility the xgettext.pl manpage is also installed with this
module, for extracting translatable strings from source files.</description>
