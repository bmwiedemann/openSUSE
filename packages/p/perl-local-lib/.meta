  <title>Create and Use a local Library Directory for Perl Modules</title>
  <description>This module provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a user-local Perl
module library located within the user's home directory. It also constructs and
prints out for the user the list of environment variables using the syntax
appropriate for the user's current shell (as specified by the SHELL environment
variable), suitable for directly adding to one's shell configuration file.

More generally, local::lib allows for the bootstrapping and usage of a
directory containing Perl modules outside of Perl's @INC. This makes it easier
to ship an application with an app-specific copy of a Perl module, or
collection of modules. Useful in cases like when an upstream maintainer hasn't
applied a patch to a module of theirs that you need for your application.
