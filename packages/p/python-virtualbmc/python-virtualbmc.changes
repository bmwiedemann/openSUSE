- update to version 1.4.0:
  * Changes the design of the VirtualBMC tool. Instead of forking the vbmc
    command-line tool to become a daemon and serve a single libvirt domain,
    the vbmcd master process and vbmc command-line client have been introduced.
    These client-server tools communicate over the ZeroMQ queue. The vbmcd
    process is responsible for herding its children, each child still serves
    a single libvirt domain.
  * The vbmc start command now supports multiple domains.
