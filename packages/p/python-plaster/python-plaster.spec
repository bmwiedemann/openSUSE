%description
Plaster is a loader interface around multiple config file formats.
It exists to define a common API for applications to use when they
wish to load a configuration. The library itself does not aim to
handle anything except a basic API that applications may use to find
and load configuration settings. Any specific constraints should be
implemented in a pluggable loader which can be registered via an
entrypoint.
