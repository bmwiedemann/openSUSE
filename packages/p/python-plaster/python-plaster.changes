- Update to version 1.1.2

  Now a LoaderNotFound exception will be raised instead of a bad unpacking of tuples.

- Update to version 1.1.1
  * Add support for Python 3.11.
  * Fix an bug introduced in 1.1 on some systems where plaster.exceptions.MultipleLoadersFound would be raised due to lib and lib64 being symlinked
    to each other and both added to the sys.path. See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/27

- Update to version 1.1
  * Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6.
  * Add support for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.
