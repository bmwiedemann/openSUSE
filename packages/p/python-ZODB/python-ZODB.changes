Tue May 13 12:06:18 UTC 2025 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 6.0.1
  * repozo: fix restoring on stdout.
  * repozo: prevent an incorrect "option ignored" warning when running
    backup or verify.
  * FileStorage: fix restore regression introduced in ZODB 6.0 in #395:
    when restoring data records with undo the restore was no longer
    emitting backpointers and was emitting duplicate data copies instead.
    #409 fixes restore back to emit data records with backpointers for
    undo again.
- Add conflict with fstail, since ZODB has a binary with the same name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 26 10:16:02 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 5.4.0:
  * Dropped support for py3.3 and added support for new ones
  * ZODB now uses pickle protocol 3 for both Python 2 and Python 3.
  * The zodbpickle package provides a zodbpickle.binary string type that should be used in Python 2 to cause binary strings to be saved in a pickle binary format, so they can be loaded correctly in Python 3. Pickle protocol 3 is needed for this to work correctly.
  * Object identifiers in persistent references are saved as zodbpickle.binary strings in Python 2, so that they are loaded correctly in Python 3.
  * If an object is missing from the index while packing a FileStorage, report its full oid.
  * Storage imports are a bit faster.
  * Storages can be important from non-seekable sources, like file-wrapped pipes.

- update to version 4.1.0:
  * Fix registration of custom logging level names ("BLATHER",
    "TRACE). We have been registering them in the wrong order since
    2004. Before Python 3.4, the stdlib logging module masked the
    error by registering them in both directions.
  * Add support for Python 3.4.
- additional changes from version 4.0.1:
  * Fix POSKeyError during transaction.commit when after
    savepoint.rollback. see #16
  * Ensure that the pickler used in PyPy always has a persistent_id
    attribute (inst_persistent_id is not present on the pure-Python
    pickler). (PR #17)
  * Provide better error reporting when trying to load an object on
    a closed connection.
- drop fix-for-upstream-test.patch: fixed upstream
- delete backup files in sources

    Also, avoid shadowing the 'file' builtin / alias with locals.
  * Bend over backward to avoid ResourceWarnings.
  * Use os.pathsep when constructing $PYTHONPATH (fix test failure on Windows).
  * Update to latest 2.2.0 bootstrap.py
