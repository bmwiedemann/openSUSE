    Make ``fsdump` callable via Python's -m command line option.
  * Fix UnboundLocalError when running fsoids.py script. See issue 285.

Mon Mar  4 14:15:53 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 5.5.1:
  * Add support for Python 3.7.
  * Bump the dependency on zodbpickle to at least 1.0.1. This is required to avoid a memory leak on Python 2.7. See issue 203.
  * Bump the dependency on persistent to at least 4.4.0.
  * Make the internal support functions for dealing with OIDs (p64 and u64) somewhat faster and raise more informative exceptions on certain types of bad input. See issue 216.
  * Remove support for python setup.py test. It hadn't been working for some time. See issue #218.
  * Make the tests run faster by avoiding calls to time.sleep().
- Drop no longer needed python-ZODB-testsuite.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 26 10:43:46 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Disable tests for now as 16 of them fail

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * python-ZODB-testsuite.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 26 10:16:02 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 5.4.0:
  * Dropped support for py3.3 and added support for new ones
  * ZODB now uses pickle protocol 3 for both Python 2 and Python 3.
  * The zodbpickle package provides a zodbpickle.binary string type that should be used in Python 2 to cause binary strings to be saved in a pickle binary format, so they can be loaded correctly in Python 3. Pickle protocol 3 is needed for this to work correctly.
  * Object identifiers in persistent references are saved as zodbpickle.binary strings in Python 2, so that they are loaded correctly in Python 3.
  * If an object is missing from the index while packing a FileStorage, report its full oid.
  * Storage imports are a bit faster.
  * Storages can be important from non-seekable sources, like file-wrapped pipes.

Fri May 15 10:52:45 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 4.1.0:
  * Fix registration of custom logging level names ("BLATHER",
    "TRACE). We have been registering them in the wrong order since
    2004. Before Python 3.4, the stdlib logging module masked the
    error by registering them in both directions.
  * Add support for Python 3.4.
- additional changes from version 4.0.1:
  * Fix POSKeyError during transaction.commit when after
    savepoint.rollback. see #16
  * Ensure that the pickler used in PyPy always has a persistent_id
    attribute (inst_persistent_id is not present on the pure-Python
    pickler). (PR #17)
  * Provide better error reporting when trying to load an object on
    a closed connection.
- drop fix-for-upstream-test.patch: fixed upstream
- delete backup files in sources
- remove unwanted shebang in python file
- do not set the executable bit of python files
- pass -q to the test to avoid spamming the build log

- Add patch to fix test during build.  This is fixed upstream for next release.
- Update old package URL.
- Update to 4.0.0 (minor changes from git commit log):
  * Try invoking parent close() via super(), hoping to squash ResourceWarning.
    Also, avoid shadowing the 'file' builtin / alias with locals.
  * Bend over backward to avoid ResourceWarnings.
  * Use os.pathsep when constructing $PYTHONPATH (fix test failure on Windows).
  * Update to latest 2.2.0 bootstrap.py
  * Correctly quote Windows pathnames
