- Add missing dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 23:56:08 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- fix and reenable tests 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 18 22:01:01 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.19.0:

  - Add "shell" password fetch strategy to pass command string to
    a shell.
  - Add "description" and "order" as metadata.
    These fetch the CalDAV: calendar-description,
    ``CardDAV:addressbook-description`` and
    ``apple-ns:calendar-order`` properties respectively.
  - Add a new ``showconfig`` status. This prints *some*
    configuration values as JSON. This is intended to be used by
    external tools and helpers that interact with ``vdirsyncer``,
    and considered experimental.
  - Update TLS-related tests that were failing due to weak MDs.
  - ``pytest-httpserver`` and ``trustme`` are now required for
    tests.
  - ``pytest-localserver`` is no longer required for tests.
  - Multithreaded support has been dropped. The
    ``"--max-workers`` has been removed.
  - A new ``asyncio`` backend is now used. So far, this shows
    substantial speed improvements in ``discovery`` and
    ``metasync``, but little change in `sync`. This will likely
    continue improving over time. :gh:`906`
  - The ``google`` storage types no longer
    require ``requests-oauthlib``, but require
    ``python-aiohttp-oauthlib`` instead.
  - Vdirsyncer no longer includes experimental support for
    `EteSync <https://www.etesync.com/>`_. The existing
    integration had not been supported for a long time and
    no longer worked. Support for external storages may be
    added if anyone is interested in maintaining an EteSync
    plugin. EteSync users should consider using `etesync-dav`_.
  - The ``plist`` for macOS has been dropped. It was broken and
    homebrew generates their own based on package metadata. macOS
    users are encouraged to use that as a reference.
  - Changes to SSL configuration:
    - Support for ``md5`` and ``sha1`` certificate fingerprints
      has been dropped. If you're validating certificate
      fingerprints, use ``sha256`` instead.
    - When using a custom ``verify_fingerprint``, CA validation
      is always disabled.
    - If ``verify_fingerprint`` is unset, CA verification is
      always active. Disabling both features is insecure and no
      longer supported.
    - The ``verify`` parameter no longer takes boolean values, it
      is now optional and only takes a string to a custom CA for
      verification.
    - The ``verify`` and ``verify_fingerprint`` will likely be
      merged into a single parameter in future.

Sat Jul 10 11:56:11 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.18.0:
  This release is a maintenance-focused one and mostly addresses
  compatibility with newer Python versions and newer dependencies.

  Note: Version 0.17 has some alpha releases but ultimately was never finalised.
  0.18 actually continues where 0.16 left off.

  - Support for Python 3.5 and 3.6 has been dropped. This release mostly focuses
    on keeping vdirsyncer compatible with newer environments.
  - Python 3.9 is now supported.
  - click 8 and click-threading 0.5.0 are now required.
  - For those using `pipsi`, we now recommend using `pipx`, it's successor.
  - Our Debian/Ubuntu build scripts have been updated. New versions should be
    pushed to those repositories soon.
- Remove obsolete patches:
  - python-vdirsyncer-shift-deadline.patch
  - deprecated_getiterator.patch
- Temporarily switch off tests (gh#pimutils/vdirsyncer#654).

- fix vdirsyncer.timer service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  4 06:23:48 UTC 2018 - dmacvicar@suse.de

- Add systemd unit and timer from upstream git
- Make package python3 only
- Update to version 0.16.6
  * Documentation building no longer needs a working installation
    of vdirsyncer.
- Changes from version 0.16.5
  * click-log 0.3 is required.
  * All output will now happen on stderr (because of the upgrade of ``click-log``).
- Changes from version 0.16.4
  * Fix tests for new Hypothesis version. (Literally no other change included)
- Changes from version 0.16.3
  * First version with custom Debian and Ubuntu packages. See :gh:`663`.
  * Remove invalid ASCII control characters from server responses. See :gh:`626`.
  * Python 3.3 is no longer supported. See :ghpr:`674`.
- Changes from version 0.16.2
  * Fix crash when using daterange or item_type filters in
    :storage:`google_calendar`, see :gh:`657`.
  * Fixes for new version ``0.2.0`` of ``click-log``. The version
    requirements for the dependency ``click-log`` changed.
- Changes from version 0.16.1
  * Removed remoteStorage support, see :gh:`647`.
  * Fixed test failures caused by latest requests version, see :gh:`660`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  4 12:30:14 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 0.16.0
  * Strip METHOD:PUBLISH added by some calendar providers, see
    :gh:`502`.
  * Fix crash of Google storages when saving token file.
  * Make DAV discovery more RFC-conformant, see :ghpr:`585`.
  * Vdirsyncer is now tested against Xandikos, see :ghpr:`601`.
  * Subfolders with a leading dot are now ignored during
    discover for filesystem storage. This makes it easier to combine
    it with version control.
  * Statuses are now stored in a sqlite database. Old data is
    automatically migrated. Users with really large datasets should
    encounter performance improvements. This means that sqlite3 is
    now a dependency of vdirsyncer.
  * Vdirsyncer is now licensed under the 3-clause BSD license,
    see :gh:`610`.
  * Vdirsyncer now includes experimental support for EteSync,
    see :ghpr:`614`.
  * Vdirsyncer now uses more filesystem metadata for determining
    whether an item changed. You will notice a possibly heavy CPU/IO
    spike on the first sync after upgrading.
  * Packagers: Reference systemd.service and systemd.timer unit
    files are provided. It is recommended to install these as
    documentation if your distribution is systemd-based.
