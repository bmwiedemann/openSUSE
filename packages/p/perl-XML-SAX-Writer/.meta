  <description>Why yet another XML Writer ?

A new XML Writer was needed to match the SAX2 effort because quite naturally no
existing writer understood SAX2. My first intention had been to start patching
XML::Handler::YAWriter as it had previously been my favourite writer in the SAX1 world.

However the more I patched it the more I realised that what I thought was going to be
a simple patch (mostly adding a few event handlers and changing the attribute syntax)
was turning out to be a rewrite due to various ideas I`d been collecting along the way.
Besides, I couldn`t find a way to elegantly make it work with SAX2 without breaking
the SAX1 compatibility which people are probably still using. There are of course
ways to do that, but most require user interaction which is something I wanted to avoid.

So in the end there was a new writer. I think it`s in fact better this way as it
helps keep SAX1 and SAX2 separated.
