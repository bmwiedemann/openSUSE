Mon Jul 25 07:38:06 UTC 2016 - tboerger@suse.com

- Updated fix-requirements.patch for new code base
- Update to version 1.7.1
  * 1.7.1
    + Fixed a bug where the output of docker-compose config for v1 files would
      be an invalid configuration file.
    + Fixed a bug where docker-compose config would not check the validity of
      links.
    + Fixed an issue where docker-compose help would not output a list of
      available commands and generic options as expected.
    + Fixed an issue where filtering by service when using docker-compose logs
      would not apply for newly created services.
    + Fixed a bug where unchanged services would sometimes be recreated in in
      the up phase when using Compose with Python 3.
    + Fixed an issue where API errors encountered during the up phase would not
      be recognized as a failure state by Compose.
    + Fixed a bug where Compose would raise a NameError because of an undefined
      exception name on non-Windows platforms.
    + Fixed a bug where the wrong version of docker-py would sometimes be
      installed alongside Compose.
    + Fixed a bug where the host value output by docker-machine config default
      would not be recognized as valid options by the docker-compose command line.
    + Fixed an issue where Compose would sometimes exit unexpectedly while
      reading events broadcasted by a Swarm cluster.
    + Corrected a statement in the docs about the location of the .env file,
      which is indeed read from the current directory, instead of in the same location as the Compose file.
  * 1.7.0
    + docker-compose logs no longer follows log output by default. It now
      matches the behaviour of docker logs and exits after the current logs are
      printed. Use -f to get the old default behaviour.
    + Booleans are no longer allows as values for mappings in the Compose file
      (for keys environment, labels and extra_hosts). Previously this was a
      warning. Boolean values should be quoted so they become string values.
    + Compose now looks for a .env file in the directory where it's run and
      reads any environment variables defined inside, if they're not already set
      in the shell environment. This lets you easily set defaults for variables
      used in the Compose file, or for any of the COMPOSE_* or DOCKER_*
      variables.
    + Added a --remove-orphans flag to both docker-compose up and docker-compose
      down to remove containers for services that were removed from the Compose
      file.
    + Added a --all flag to docker-compose rm to include containers created by
      docker-compose run. This will become the default behavior in the next
      version of Compose.
    + Added support for all the same TLS configuration flags used by the docker
      client: --tls, --tlscert, --tlskey, etc.
    + Compose files now support the tmpfs and shm_size options.
    + Added the --workdir flag to docker-compose run
    + docker-compose logs now shows logs for new containers that are created
      after it starts.
    + The COMPOSE_FILE environment variable can now contain multiple files,
      separated by the host system's standard path separator (: on Mac/Linux, ;
      on Windows).
    + You can now specify a static IP address when connecting a service to a
      network with the ipv4_address and ipv6_address options.
    + Added --follow, --timestamp, and --tail flags to the docker-compose logs
      command.
    + docker-compose up, and docker-compose start will now start containers in
      parallel where possible.
    + docker-compose stop now stops containers in reverse dependency order
      instead of all at once.
    + Added the --build flag to docker-compose up to force it to build a new
      image. It now shows a warning if an image is automatically built when the
      flag is not used.
    + Added the docker-compose exec command for executing a process in a running
      container.
    + docker-compose down now removes containers created by docker-compose run.
    + A more appropriate error is shown when a timeout is hit during up when
      using a tty.
    + Fixed a bug in docker-compose down where it would abort if some resources
      had already been removed.
    + Fixed a bug where changes to network aliases would not trigger a service
      to be recreated.
    + Fix a bug where a log message was printed about creating a new volume when
      it already existed.
    + Fixed a bug where interrupting up would not always shut down containers.
    + Fixed a bug where log_opt and log_driver were not properly carried over
      when extending services in the v1 Compose file format.
    + Fixed a bug where empty values for build args would cause file validation
      to fail.
