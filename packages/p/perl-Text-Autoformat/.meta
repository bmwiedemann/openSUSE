  <title>Automatic text wrapping and reformatting</title>
  <description>Text::Autoformat provides intelligent formatting of
plaintext without the need for any kind of embedded mark-up. The
module recognizes Internet quoting conventions, a wide range of
bulleting and number schemes, centred text, and block quotations,
and reformats each appropriately. Other options allow the user to
adjust inter-word and inter-paragraph spacing, justify text, and
impose various capitalization schemes.

The module also supplies a re-entrant, highly configurable
replacement for the built-in Perl format() mechanism.
