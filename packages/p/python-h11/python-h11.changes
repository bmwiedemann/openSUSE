- update to 0.13.0:
  * Clarify that the Headers class is a Sequence and inherit from the
    collections Sequence abstract base class to also indicate this (and
    gain the mixin methods).
  * Switch event classes to dataclasses for easier typing and slightly
    improved performance.
  * Shorten traceback of protocol errors for easier readability
  * Add typing including a PEP 561 marker for usage by type checkers
  * Expand the allowed status codes to [0, 999] from [0, 600]
  * Ensure request method is a valid token

Tue Nov 10 08:02:09 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.11.0:
  * h11 now stores and makes available the raw header name as
  received. In addition h11 will write out header names with the same
  casing as passed to it. This allows compatibility with systems that
  expect titlecased header names. See `#31
  * Multiple content length headers are now merged into a single header
  if all the values are equal, if any are unequal a LocalProtocol
  error is raised (as before). See `#92

Tue Dec  4 21:14:53 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 0.8.1
  Bug fixes:
  * Always return headers as ``bytes`` objects (`#60
    <https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/issues/60>`__)
  Other changes:
  * Added proper license notices to the Javascript used in our
    documentation (`#61
    <https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/issues/60>`__)
  version 0.8.0
  Backwards **in**\compatible changes:
  * h11 now performs stricter validation on outgoing header
    names and header values: illegal characters are now rejected
    (example: you can't put a newline into an HTTP header), and
    header values with leading/trailing whitespace are also
    rejected (previously h11 would silently discard the
    whitespace). All these checks were already performed on
    incoming headers; this just extends that to outgoing
    headers.
  New features:
  * New method :meth:`Connection.send_failed`, to notify a
    :class:`Connection` object when data returned from
    :meth:`Connection.send` was *not* sent.
  Bug fixes:
  * Make sure that when computing the framing headers for HEAD
    responses, we produce the same results as we would for the
    corresponding GET.
  * Error out if a request has multiple Host: headers.
  * Send the Host: header first, as recommended by RFC 7230.
  * The Expect: header `is case-insensitive
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.1.1>`__, so
    use case-insensitive matching when looking for 100-continue.
  Other changes:
  * Better error messages in several cases.
  * Provide correct ``error_status_hint`` in exception raised
    when encountering an invalid ``Transfer-Encoding`` header.
  * For better compatibility with broken servers, h11 now
    tolerates responses where the reason phrase is missing (not
    just empty).
  * Various optimizations and documentation improvements.
