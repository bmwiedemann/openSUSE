- Update to version 0.8.1
  Bug fixes:
  * Always return headers as ``bytes`` objects (`#60
    <https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/issues/60>`__)
  Other changes:
  * Added proper license notices to the Javascript used in our
    documentation (`#61
    <https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/issues/60>`__)
  version 0.8.0
  Backwards **in**\compatible changes:
  * h11 now performs stricter validation on outgoing header
    names and header values: illegal characters are now rejected
    (example: you can't put a newline into an HTTP header), and
    header values with leading/trailing whitespace are also
    rejected (previously h11 would silently discard the
    whitespace). All these checks were already performed on
    incoming headers; this just extends that to outgoing
    headers.
  New features:
  * New method :meth:`Connection.send_failed`, to notify a
    :class:`Connection` object when data returned from
    :meth:`Connection.send` was *not* sent.
  Bug fixes:
  * Make sure that when computing the framing headers for HEAD
    responses, we produce the same results as we would for the
    corresponding GET.
  * Error out if a request has multiple Host: headers.
  * Send the Host: header first, as recommended by RFC 7230.
  * The Expect: header `is case-insensitive
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.1.1>`__, so
    use case-insensitive matching when looking for 100-continue.
  Other changes:
  * Better error messages in several cases.
  * Provide correct ``error_status_hint`` in exception raised
    when encountering an invalid ``Transfer-Encoding`` header.
  * For better compatibility with broken servers, h11 now
    tolerates responses where the reason phrase is missing (not
    just empty).
  * Various optimizations and documentation improvements.
