  <title>PAM Authentication Module for Using Cryptographic Tokens</title>
  <description>Pam_p11 is a pluggable authentication module (pam) package for using
cryptographic tokens, such as smart cards and usb crypto tokens, for
authentication.

Pam_p11 uses libp11 to access any PKCS#11 module. It should be
compatible with any implementation, but it is primarily developed using
OpenSC.

Pam_p11 implements two authentication modules:

* pam_p11_openssh authenticates the user using openssh
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

* pam_p11_opensc authenticates the user using certificates found in
   ~/.eid/authorized_certificates. It is compatible with the older
   opensc &quot;pam_opensc&quot; authentication module (eid mode).

Pam_p11 is very simple. It has no configuration file, no other options
than the PKCS#11 module file, and does not know about certificate
chains, certificate authorities, revocation lists, or OCSP. It is
perfect for the small installation with no frills.</description>
