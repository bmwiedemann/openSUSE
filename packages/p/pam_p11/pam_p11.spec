%description
Pam_p11 is a pluggable authentication module (pam) package for using
cryptographic tokens, such as smart cards and usb crypto tokens, for
authentication.

Pam_p11 has limited functionality since it simply compares public
keys to sign some random data and verifies the signature with the
public key. This works fine for small installations but may have
security implications, see README.SUSE.
