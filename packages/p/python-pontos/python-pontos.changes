  * Add possibility to execute version script via poetry run
    version
  * Add CHANGELOG.md handling (updating unreleased, get unreleased
    information)
  * Add release command to make a release
  * Add prepare release command
  * __main__ checks if there is CMakeLists.txt or pyproject.toml 
    in path.
  * Based on that it decide which version command it will execute.
- Kill dephell dependency by using the PyPI sdist setup.py
- Switch to plain python unittest because pytest finds some broken
  functions in test_changelog_changelog.py
- package for Python3.6 with dataclasses backport  despite upstream
  not supporting it
