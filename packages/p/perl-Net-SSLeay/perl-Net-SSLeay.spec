%description
Net::SSLeay module contains perl bindings to openssl (http://www.openssl.org) library.
Net::SSLeay module basically comprise of:
    High level functions for accessing web servers (by using HTTP/HTTPS)
    Low level API (mostly mapped 1:1 to openssl's C functions)
    Convenience functions (related to low level API but with more perl friendly interface)
