- updated to 1.94
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Net-SSLeay/Changes

  1.94 2024-01-08
  	- New stable release incorporating all changes from developer releases 1.93_01
  	  to 1.93_05.
  	- Summary of major changes since version 1.92:
  	  - Net::SSLeay now officially supports all stable releases of OpenSSL 3.1 and
  	    3.2, and LibreSSL 3.5 - 3.8.
  	  - Many noisy compiler warnings have been silenced - if SSLeay.xs fails to
  	    compile, it should now be much easier to identify the cause.
  	  - libcrypto's OPENSSL_init_crypto() function and libssl's OPENSSL_init_ssl()
  	    function are now exposed, enabling fine-grained control over the
  	    initialisation and configuration of both libraries.
  	  - libssl functions implementing TLS 1.3 PSK authentication are now exposed,
  	    in particular SSL_CTX_set_psk_find_session_callback() (on the server side)
  	    and SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback() (on the client side).
  	  - libssl functions implementing server-side TLS 1.2 PSK authentication are
  	    now exposed, in particular SSL_CTX_set_psk_server_callback().
  	  - libssl's SSL_CTX_set_client_hello_cb() function is now exposed, allowing a
  	    TLS server to set a callback function that is executed when the server
  	    processes a ClientHello message.
  	  - Many more libcrypto/libssl constants and functions are now exposed; see the
  	    release notes for the 1.93 developer releases for a full list.
  1.93_05 2024-01-06
  	- Remove support for automatic detection of libssl/libcrypto via pkg-config
  	  with ExtUtils::PkgConfig if it is installed, due to the compiler and linker
  	  options provided by pkg-config being used unconditionally (which is
  	  incompatible with the OPENSSL_PREFIX detection method). The implementation of
  	  this was merged in time for developer release 1.93_03 and therefore hasn't
  	  been included in a stable release yet, so this doesn't represent a breaking
  	  change to the way in which libssl/libcrypto are detected by Makefile.PL. This
  	  is, however, a very useful feature, and we intend to bring it back in time
  	  for Net-SSLeay 1.96 after ironing out the remaining bugs.
  1.93_04 2024-01-05
  	- Use -DOPENSSL_API_COMPAT=908 when compiling SSLeay.xs to
  	  suppress OpenSSL deprecation warnings.
  	- Expose a number of functions that were added in recent
  	  LibreSSL releases or were not otherwise exposed before:
  	  - SSL(_CTX)_get/set_security_level in LibreSSL 3.6.0
  	  - SSL(_CTX)_get/set_num_tickets in LibreSSL 3.5.0
  	  - SSL(_CTX)_set_ciphersuites in LibreSSL 3.4.0
  	  - EVP_PKEY_security_bits in LibreSSL 3.6.0
  	  - SSL_CTX_set_keylog_callback in LibreSSL 3.5.0
  	  - SSL_is_dtls in LibreSSL 3.3.2
  	- Remove Tuure Vartiainen as an active contributor. Tuure's contributions were
  	  instrumental in the transition from ad hoc testing to CI-based testing, which
  	  has greatly improved Net-SSLeay's stability, reliability and compatibility.
  	  Thanks for your contributions, Tuure!
  1.93_03 2024-01-02
  	- Pass RAND_seed()'s sole argument to the underlying RAND_seed() function in
  	  libcrypto, rather than passing the value of a non-existent second argument.
  	  Fixes GH-427. Thanks to cgf1 for the report.
  	- Avoid explicit and implicit use of weak hash algorithms,
  	  such as MD5 and SHA-1, in test suite. This allows tests
  	  44_sess.t and 45_exporter.t to correctly work on systems
  	  where crypto policies prohibit their direct use and TLS
  	  versions that require them. An example of such a system is
  	  Rocky Linux 9.2. Any Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and derived
  	  system is likely to have similar behaviour.  Thanks to Paul
  	  Howarth for the investigation and patches.
  	- LibreSSL 3.8.0 release notes state: The POLICY_TREE and its
  	  related structures and API were removed. The affected
  	  Net::SSLeay functions are:
  	  - X509_policy_level_get0_node
  	  - X509_policy_level_node_count
  	  - X509_policy_node_get0_parent
  	  - X509_policy_node_get0_policy
  	  - X509_policy_node_get0_qualifiers
  	  - X509_policy_tree_free
  	  - X509_policy_tree_get0_level
  	  - X509_policy_tree_get0_policies
  	  - X509_policy_tree_get0_user_policies
  	  - X509_policy_tree_level_count
  	  Patch by GitHub user orbea.
  	- Add OpenSSL 3.1 and LibreSSL 3.7 minor releases to GitHub CI testing.
  	  Update the previous minor releases to their latest versions. Add
  	  NetBSD to BSDs job and update the other BSDs and Alpine Linux jobs to
  	  cover additional and latest releases. Use the latest MacOS runners.
  	- Expose SSL_CTX_set_client_hello_cb for setting a callback
  	  the server calls when it processes a ClientHello. Expose the
  	  following functions that can be called only from the
  	  callback. None of these are available with LibreSSL.
  	  - SSL_client_hello_isv2
  	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_legacy_version
  	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_random
  	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_session_id
  	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_ciphers
  	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_compression_methods
  	  - SSL_client_hello_get1_extensions_present
  	  - SSL_client_hello_get_extension_order
  	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_ext
  	- Expose constants used by SSL_CTX_set_client_hello_cb related
  	  functions.
  	  - AD_ prefixed constants naming TLS alert codes for
  	    returning from a ClientHello callback or where alert types
  	    are used
  	  - CLIENT_HELLO_ERROR, CLIENT_HELLO_RETRY and
  	    CLIENT_HELLO_SUCCESS for returning from a ClientHello
  	    callback
  	  - TLSEXT_TYPE_ prefixed contants for naming TLS extension
  	    types
  	- Expose functions for setting up TLS PSK on the server
  	  side. Only SSL_CIPHER_find is available with LibreSSL.
  	  - SSL_use_psk_identity_hint
  	  - SSL_CTX_use_psk_identity_hint
  	  - SSL_set_psk_server_callback
  	  - SSL_CTX_set_psk_server_callback
  	  - SSL_set_psk_find_session_callback
  	  - SSL_CTX_set_psk_find_session_callback
  	  - SSL_SESSION_set1_master_key
  	  - SSL_SESSION_set_cipher
  	  - SSL_SESSION_set_protocol_version
  	  - SSL_CIPHER_find
  	- Expose NID_shake128, NID_shake256 and the rest of NID_sha* constants.
  	- Expose functions for setting up TLS 1.3 PSK authentication
  	  on the client side. Only SSL_SESSION_get0_cipher is
  	  available with LibreSSL.
  	  - SSL_set_psk_use_session_callback
  	  - SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback
  	  - SSL_CIPHER_get_handshake_digest
  	  - SSL_SESSION_get0_cipher
  	  - EVP_MD_get0_description
  	  - EVP_MD_get0_name
  	  - EVP_MD_get_type
  	- Major documentation cleanup. Thanks to John Jetmore.
  	- Add constants for specifying version field for certificates,
  	  certificate requests and CRLs. Available in OpenSSL 3.0:
  	  - X509_VERSION_1, X509_VERSION_2 and X509_VERSION_3
  	  - X509_REQ_VERSION_1, X509_REQ_VERSION_2 and X509_REQ_VERSION_3
  	  - X509_CRL_VERSION_1 and X509_CRL_VERSION_2
  	- Remove conditional compilation checks from SSLeay.xs and
  	  compatilibty notes from SSLeay.pod for OpenSSL versions
  	  earlier than 0.9.8. This includes all 0.9.7 and earlier
  	  releases down to 0.9.3a. Update tests respectively.
  	- Add OpenSSL 3.2 and LibreSSL 3.8 minor releases to GitHub CI
  	  testing. Update existing OpenSSL releases to 1.1.1w, 3.0.12
  	  and 3.1.4.
  	- Support compiling SSLeay.xs with a C++ compiler. Thanks to
  	  James E Keenan and GitHub user twata1 for suggesting this,
  	  testing and providing detailed test reports. Tested with GCC
  	  13 g++, Clang 17 clang++ and Visual Studio Community 2022
  	  C++ compilers. Discussion in GH-425 and GH-438.
  	- Add constants for OPENSSL_init_crypto and related functions:
  	  - CONF_MFLAGS_DEFAULT_SECTION
  	  - CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_ERRORS
  	  - CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_MISSING_FILE
  	  - CONF_MFLAGS_IGNORE_RETURN_CODES
  	  - CONF_MFLAGS_NO_DSO
  	  - CONF_MFLAGS_SILENT
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ADD_ALL_CIPHERS
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ADD_ALL_DIGESTS
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ASYNC
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ENGINE_AFALG
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ENGINE_CAPI
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ENGINE_CRYPTODEV
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ENGINE_DYNAMIC
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ENGINE_OPENSSL
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ENGINE_PADLOCK
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_ENGINE_RDRAND
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_LOAD_CONFIG
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_LOAD_CRYPTO_STRINGS
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_LOAD_SSL_STRINGS
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ADD_ALL_CIPHERS
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ADD_ALL_DIGESTS
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ATEXIT
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_NO_LOAD_CONFIG
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_NO_LOAD_CRYPTO_STRINGS
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_NO_LOAD_SSL_STRINGS
  	- Expose functions for OpenSSL libcrypto and libssl
  	  initialisation, configuration and deinitialisation.
  	  These are available in OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later:
  	  - OPENSSL_init_ssl and OPENSSL_init_crypto
  	  - OPENSSL_cleanup, also in LibreSSL 3.6.0
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_new and OPENSSL_INIT_free
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_set_config_filename
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_set_config_appname
  	  - OPENSSL_INIT_set_config_file_flags
  	- Add new test file 23_openssl_init.t for OPENSSL_init_ssl and
  	  related functions.
  	- Support finding OpenSSL libraries using
  	  ExtUtils::PkgConfig. Thanks to Paul Howarth for the patch.
  	- Fix a number of cases where variables were declared after
  	  code triggering Gcc and Clang warning
  	  -Wdeclaration-after-statement. This is supported by C
  	  language version C99 and used by Perl 5.35.5 and
  	  later. SSLeay.xs is likely compiled with compilers that do
  	  not support this, therefore such constructs are avoided in
  	  SSLeay.xs. Thanks to GitHub user bulk88 for the patch.
  	- Fix _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE warning on Windows. Fix OpenSSL
  	  library file path detection loop in Makefile.PL. Both thanks
  	  to bulk88.
  	- Update Shining Light OpenSSL detection to work with OpenSSL
  	  1.1.1w, 3.0.12, 3.1.4 and 3.2.0 installers. Caveats: when
  	  both 32bit and 64bit versions are installed, OpenSSL library
  	  path detection may pick the wrong version. Static
  	  compilation needs seems not to work with the these
  	  versions. Thanks to bulk88 for the initial updates.
  	- Tone down Makefile.PL and README warning against mixing
  	  compilers and flags when compiling OpenSSL, Perl and
  	  Net::SSLeay. This may still be a requirement on some
  	  platforms, but, for example, with Linux and macOS mixing
  	  clang and gcc appears to work.
  	- Add general installation instructions in README. Thanks to
  	  GitHub user viviparous. Update README and README.OSX.
  1.93_02 2023-02-22
  	- Update ppport.h to version 3.68. This eliminates thousands of
  	  compound-token-split-by-macro compiler warnings when building Net-SSLeay with
  	  Clang 12 or greater. Partially fixes GH-383.
  	- Silence compound-token-split-by-macro warnings when building Net-SSLeay with
  	  Clang 12 or greater. Fixes the remainder of GH-383.
  	- When building Net-SSLeay, search for the openssl binary in the same directory
  	  in which Perl is installed (i.e. $Config{prefix}/bin/). Thanks to Henrik
  	  Grimler for the patch.
  	- Expose EVP_PKEY_security_bits. Thanks to Felipe Gasper.
  	- Major update to Gihub Actions configuration. Thanks to Felipe Gasper.
  	  New testing targets are:
  	    - OpenSSL and LibreSSL on Alpine Linux on i386, x390x, arm32v6,
  	      ar32v7 and arm64v8 architectures.
  	    - OpenSSL and LibreSSL on Ubuntu on i386, x390x, ar32v7 and arm64v8
  	      architectures.
  	    - OpenSSL on FreeBSD 13.0, not enabled yet because of GH #272 and #394
  	    - LibreSSL on FreeBSD 13.0
  	    - LibreSSL on OpenBSD 6.9
  	    - LibreSSL on OpenBSD 7.1
  	    - Cygwin on x86_64
  	- Fix compilation failure using cl. Microsoft cl compiler do
  	  not like when preprocessor directives are inside a
  	  macro. Fixes GH-403. Thanks to Jean-Damien Durand.
  	- Update CTX_use_PKCS12_file() and CTX_use_PKCS12_file() to
  	  use BIO functions for avoiding "no OPENSSL_Applink" runtime
  	  errors. Fixes GH-281 and RT#101638. Thanks to Jean-Damien
  	  Durand.
  	- Add to README.Win32 more information about OPENSSL_Applink
  	  and how it may be needed with FILE pointers and POSIX/Unix
  	  fds. Recommended method is to avoid them and use OpenSSL BIO
  	  functions instead. Update SSLeay.pod with alternatives to
  	  Net::SSLeay::SESSION_print_fp(). Closes GH-411.
  	- Refactor variable declarations in RSA_generate_key to allow SSLeay.xs to
  	  compile under -Werror=declaration-after-statement. Fixes GH-407. Thanks to
  	  dharanlinux for the report.
  	- Fix memory leaks after calls to X509_get_ext_d2i. Thanks to Anton Borowka.
  	- Documentation fix: Correct CRL revocation reasons in
  	  P_X509_CRL_add_revoked_serial_hex(). Closes GH-397. Reported
  	  by Marc Reisner.
  	- Support stable releases of LibreSSL 3.5 and 3.6.
  	- Update callback set by SSL_set_session_secret_cb to adjust
  	  master secret's length. This is needed with OpenSSL 1.1.1
  	  and later that provide buffer that is now longer than 48
  	  octets. Fix Net::SSLeay::get_keyblock_size() size
  	  calculation with AEAD ciphers. These functions were
  	  originally added to OpenSSL and Net::SSLeay for
  	  EAP-FAST. These changes allow EAP-FAST to work with AEAD
  	  ciphers and with OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and later.
  	- Remove code guarded by obsolete
  	  SSL_F_SSL_SET_HELLO_EXTENSION #ifdef. This was used by the
  	  initial EAP-FAST related OpenSSL patch which was never part
  	  of the OpenSSL distribution.
  	- PEM_get_string_PrivateKey() currently uses DES-CBC as its
  	  default encryption algorithm. Test 33_x509_create_cert.t now
  	  skips testing the default algorithm on systems that support
  	  providers but don't have the legacy provider available. One
  	  such system is FreeBSD 13.0 with OpenSSL which was added as
  	  disabled in GitHub actions by PR GH-402 but can now be
  	  enabled. Long term fix is to replace DES-CBC with a modern
  	  cipher. Allows closing GH-394.
  1.93_01 2022-03-20
  	- LibreSSL 3.5.0 has removed access to internal data
  	  structures: Use X509_get0_tbs_sigalg() and
  	  OCSP_SINGLERESP_get0_id() like in OpenSSL 1.1. Also use
  	  RSA_get0... with RSA_get_key_parameters(). Thanks to
  	  Alexander Bluhm.
  	- Expose SSL_CTX_get_min_proto_version(),
  	  SSL_CTX_get_max_proto_version(), SSL_get_min_proto_version()
  	  and SSL_get_max_proto_version() with LibresSSL 3.4.0 and
  	  later. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
  	- Update tests 07_sslecho.t and 44_sess.t to work around
  	  failures seen on Windows with Perls earlier than 5.20. For
  	  the details, see GH-356 and look for CloseHandle() in Perl
  	  5.20.0 changelog. Thanks to GitHub user twata1 for the
  	  report and additional help.
  	- Alexander's recent work with RSA_get_key_parameters(),
  	  allows to make it available with all OpenSSL versions. It
  	  was already available with versions earlier than 1.1.0.
  	- Expose BN_dup(), BN_clear(), BN_clear_free() and BN_free().
  	- Use PTR2IV instead of direct cast to IV to fix compilation
  	  warning with SSLeay.xs internal function bn2sv().
  	- Expose X509_CRL_get0_lastUpdate(),
  	  X509_CRL_get0_nextUpdate(), X509_CRL_set1_lastUpdate() and
  	  X509_CRL_set1_nextUpdate() that became available with
  	  OpenSSL 1.1.0 and LibreSSL 2.7.0. These, and the respective
  	  deprecated _get/set_ aliases, are available with all OpenSSL
  	  and LibreSSL versions. Fixes part of RT#124371.
  	- Note in documentation that the X509_CRL_get* functions
  	  return a pointer to time structure that should be considered
  	  read-only.
  	- Use ASN1_STRING_get0_data() instead of ASN1_STRING_data() to
  	  avoid compile time deprecation warnings. Partly fixes
  	  RT#124371.
  	- Add the following constants from Current OpenSSL master branch:
  	  - SSL_ASYNC_PAUSED
  	  - SSL_ASYNC_NO_JOBS
  	  - SSL_CLIENT_HELLO_CB
  	  - SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC
  	  - SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC_JOB
  	  - SSL_ERROR_WANT_CLIENT_HELLO_CB
  	  - SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY
  	  - SSL_MODE_ASYNC
  	  - SSL_MODE_NO_AUTO_CHAIN
  	  - SSL_OP_ALLOW_CLIENT_RENEGOTIATION
  	  - SSL_OP_CLEANSE_PLAINTEXT
  	  - SSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES
  	  - SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS
  	  - SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF
  	  - SSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET
  	  - SSL_RETRY_VERIFY
  	  - SSL_SESS_CACHE_UPDATE_TIME
  	  - X509_TRUST_DEFAULT
  	  - X509_V_ERR_AUTHORITY_KEY_IDENTIFIER_CRITICAL
  	  - X509_V_ERR_CA_BCONS_NOT_CRITICAL
  	  - X509_V_ERR_CA_CERT_MISSING_KEY_USAGE
  	  - X509_V_ERR_EC_KEY_EXPLICIT_PARAMS
  	  - X509_V_ERR_EMPTY_SUBJECT_ALT_NAME
  	  - X509_V_ERR_EMPTY_SUBJECT_SAN_NOT_CRITICAL
  	  - X509_V_ERR_EXTENSIONS_REQUIRE_VERSION_3
  	  - X509_V_ERR_ISSUER_NAME_EMPTY
  	  - X509_V_ERR_KU_KEY_CERT_SIGN_INVALID_FOR_NON_CA
  	  - X509_V_ERR_MISSING_AUTHORITY_KEY_IDENTIFIER
  	  - X509_V_ERR_MISSING_SUBJECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER
  	  - X509_V_ERR_NO_ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY
  	  - X509_V_ERR_PATHLEN_INVALID_FOR_NON_CA
  	  - X509_V_ERR_PATHLEN_WITHOUT_KU_KEY_CERT_SIGN
  	  - X509_V_ERR_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM_INCONSISTENCY
  	  - X509_V_ERR_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM_MISMATCH
  	  - X509_V_ERR_SUBJECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER_CRITICAL
  	  - X509_V_ERR_SUBJECT_NAME_EMPTY
  	  - X509_V_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM
  	- Expose X509_get0_notBefore(), X509_getm_notBefore()
  	  X509_get0_nextAfter() and X509_getm_nextAfter() that became
  	  available with OpenSSL 1.1.0 and LibreSSL 2.7.0. These, and
  	  the deprecated _get functions, are available, as aliases
  	  when needed, with all OpenSSL and LibreSSL versions. Fixes
  	  GH-367.
  	- Only export the TLSv1*_method() functions when support for the respective TLS
  	  version is available in the underlying libssl library. This allows
  	  Net::SSLeay to be built against libssl libraries that were compiled without
  	  support for old TLS versions.

Thu Dec 14 13:47:04 UTC 2023 - Otto Hollmann <otto.hollmann@suse.com>

- Use constants X509_VERSION_3 and X509_REQ_VERSION_1 when available (#GH-449)
  * Add Use-constants-X509_VERSION_3-and-X509_REQ_VERSION_1-when-available.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 14 03:07:28 UTC 2022 - Tina Müller <timueller+perl@suse.de>

- updated to 1.92
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Net-SSLeay/Changes

  1.92 2022-01-12
  	- New stable release incorporating all changes from developer releases 1.91_01
  	  to 1.91_03.
  	- Summary of major changes since version 1.90:
  	  - Net::SSLeay now supports stable releases of OpenSSL 3.0.
  	    - OpenSSL 3.0.0 introduces the concept of "providers", which contain
  	      cryptographic algorithm implementations. Many outdated, deprecated and/or
  	      insecure algorithms have been moved to the "legacy" provider, which may
  	      need to be loaded explicitly in order to use them with Net::SSLeay. See
  	      "Low level API: OSSL_LIB_CTX and OSSL_PROVIDER related functions" in the
  	      Net::SSLeay module documentation for details.
  	    - Net::SSLeay's built-in PEM_get_string_PrivateKey() function depends on
  	      algorithms that have moved to the legacy provider described above; if
  	      OpenSSL has been compiled without the legacy provider, the tests
  	      t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t and t/local/63_ec_key_generate_key.t will
  	      fail when the test suite is run.
  	    - TLS 1.1 and below may only be used at security level 0 as of OpenSSL
  	      3.0.0; if a minimum required security level is imposed (e.g. in an
  	      OpenSSL configuration file managed by the operating system), the tests
  	      t/local/44_sess.t and t/local/45_exporter.t will fail when the test suite
  	      is run.
  	  - Net::SSLeay now supports stable releases of LibreSSL from the 3.2 - 3.4
  	    series (with the exception of 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 - see "COMPATIBILITY" in the
  	    Net::SSLeay module documentation for details).
  	    - The TLS 1.3 implementation in LibreSSL 3.1 - 3.3, parts of which are
  	      enabled by default, is not fully compatible with the libssl API and may
  	      not function as expected with Net::SSLeay; see "KNOWN BUGS AND CAVEATS"
  	      in the Net::SSLeay module documentation for details.
  	  - A number of new libcrypto/libssl constants and functions are now exposed,
  	    including SSL_CTX_set_keylog_callback() and SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback(),
  	    which are helpful when debugging TLS handshakes. See the release notes for
  	    the 1.91 developer releases below for a full list of newly-exposed
  	    constants and functions.
  1.91_03 2022-01-10
  	- Avoid misclassifying Clang as GCC in Test::Net::SSLeay's can_thread()
  	  function. This fixes test failures in 61_threads-cb-crash.t and
  	  62_threads-ctx_new-deadlock.t on OpenBSD and FreeBSD (and possibly other OSes
  	  too). Fixes GH-350.
  	- Add the following constants for OpenSSL_version():
  	  - OPENSSL_CPU_INFO
  	  - OPENSSL_FULL_VERSION_STRING
  	  - OPENSSL_MODULES_DIR
  	  - OPENSSL_VERSION_STRING
  	  These constants are new in OpenSSL 3.0.0 release.
  	- Update test 03_use.t to print information returned by the new constants.
  	- Add more information to 03_use.t print output, including printing
  	  OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER as a 32bit hex number.
  	- Add the following constants for OPENSSL_info() added in OpenSSL 3.0.0.
  	  - OPENSSL_INFO_CONFIG_DIR
  	  - OPENSSL_INFO_CPU_SETTINGS
  	  - OPENSSL_INFO_DIR_FILENAME_SEPARATOR
  	  - OPENSSL_INFO_DSO_EXTENSION
  	  - OPENSSL_INFO_ENGINES_DIR
  	  - OPENSSL_INFO_LIST_SEPARATOR
  	  - OPENSSL_INFO_MODULES_DIR
  	  - OPENSSL_INFO_SEED_SOURCE
  	- Expose OPENSSL_info(), OPENSSL_version_major(),
  	  OPENSSL_version_minor(), OPENSSL_version_patch(),
  	  OPENSSL_version_pre_release() and
  	  OPENSSL_version_build_metadata() added in OpenSSL
  	  3.0.0. Update 03_use.t diagnostics and 04_basic.t tests to
  	  use these functions.
  	- Clarify documentation of OpenSSL_version_num(), SSLeay(),
  	  SSLeay_version() and OpenSSL_version().
  	- Add notes to OpenSSL_version_num() and SSLeay() on how to
  	  determine if the library is OpenSSL or LibreSSL and how to
  	  interpret the version number these functions return.
  	- Add constants OPENSSL_VERSION_MAJOR, OPENSSL_VERSION_MINOR
  	  and OPENSSL_VERSION_PATCH. Update
  	  OPENSSL_version_major/minor/patch documentation to describe
  	  how these library functions relate to Net-SSLeay compile
  	  time constants. Add tests to verify the constants and
  	  functions return equal values.
  1.91_02 2021-12-29
  	- On OpenVMS, detect vendor SSL111 product based on OpenSSL 1.1.x.
  	- Cast the return value of OCSP_SINGLERESP_get0_id to fix a
  	  const/non-const mismatch warning that broke the build on OpenVMS.
  	- Create SSL_CTXs with Test::Net::SSLeay's new_ctx() function for tests that
  	  are broken with LibreSSL 3.2. Partially fixes GH-232.
  	- In 36_verify.t, account for the presence of the X509_V_FLAG_LEGACY_VERIFY
  	  flag (signalling the use of the legacy X.509 verifier) in LibreSSL 3.2
  	  versions from 3.2.4 onwards. Fixes the remainder of GH-232.
  	- Note in the Net::SSLeay documentation that the TLS 1.3 implementation in
  	  LibreSSL 3.1 - 3.3, parts of which are enabled by default, is not
  	  libssl-compatible. See the "KNOWN BUGS AND CAVEATS" section of
  	  lib/Net/SSLeay.pod for details.
  	- Add constants for, but not limited to,
  	  SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback and SSL_set_msg_callback functions:
  	  SSL3_RT_* for record content types, SSL3_MT_* for Handshake
  	  and ChangeCipherSpec message types, SSL2_VERSION to
  	  complement the list of existing SSL and TLS version
  	  constants and SSL2_MT_* for SSLv2 Handshake messages.
  	- Expose SSL_CTX_set_keylog_callback and
  	  SSL_CTX_get_keylog_callback available with OpenSSL 1.1.1pre1
  	  and later.
  	- Enhance 10_rand.t RAND_file_name tests: tests are no longer
  	  affected by the runtime environment variables, HOME and
  	  RANDFILE. These variables are insted controlled by the tests
  	  with local %ENV. Problems related to RAND_file_name were
  	  discussed in Github issue GH-152, and there might still be
  	  cases when, for example, setuid is used because of OpenSSL's
  	  use of glibc secure_getenv() and related functions. Address
  	  RAND_file_name differences between OpenSSL versions. Note in
  	  SSLeay.pod that RAND_file_name() can return undef with
  	  LibreSSL and recent OpenSSL versions.
  	- Removed the following exportable symbols from SSLeay.pm:
  	  - SESSION, clear_error and err have never been defined.
  	  - add_session, flush_sessions and remove_session were
  	    removed in Net::SSLeay 1.04
  	  - Undocumented X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags() was removed in
  	    Net::SSLeay 1.37 when X509_VERIFY_PARAM_* functions were
  	    added. These are preferred over directly setting the flags.
  	- Clarified Changes entry for release 1.75 to state that
  	  CTX_v2_new is not removed from Net::SSLeay. SSLv2 is
  	  completely removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
  	- Beginning with OpenSSL 3.0.0-alpha17, SSL_CTX_get_options()
  	  and related functions return uint64_t instead of long. For
  	  this reason constant() in constant.c and Net::SSLeay must
  	  also be able to return 64bit constants. Add uint64_t
  	  definitions to typemap file and update constant() and
  	  options functions to use uint64_t with OpenSSL 3.0.0 and
  	  later when Perl is compiled with 64bit integers. With 32bit
  	  integers, the functions remain as they are: constant()
  	  functions return double and options functions return
  	  long. This partially fixes GH-315, 32bit integer Perls need
  	  to be handled separately.
  	- Work around macOS Monterey build failure during 'perl
  	  Makefile.PL' that causes perl to exit with 'WARNING:
  	  .../perl is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way' or similar
  	  message. This fixes GH-329. Thanks to Daniel J. Luke for the
  	  report and John Napiorkowski for additional help.
  1.91_01 2021-10-24
  	- Correct X509_STORE_CTX_init() return value to integer. Previous
  	  versions of Net::SSLeay return nothing.
  	- Update tests to call close() to avoid problems seen with
  	  test 44_sess.t, and possibly other tests, running on older
  	  Windows Perl versions. Also add some missing calls in tests
  	  to shutdown and free ssl structures.
  	- Fix multiple formatting errors in the documentation for Net::SSLeay.
  	  Thanks to John Jetmore.
  	- Check for presence of libssl headers in Makefile.PL, and exit with an
  	  error instead of generating an invalid Makefile if they cannot be found.
  	  Fixes RT#105189. Thanks to James E Keenan for the report.
  	- Added support for SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback/SSL_set_msg_callback
  	  Thanks to Tim Aerts.
  	- Adjust time in ASN1_TIME_timet based on current offset to GMT to
  	  address GH-148. Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.
  	- Multiple updates to tests to match OpenSSL 3.0 behaviour.
  	  Thanks to Michal Josef Špaček.
  	- OpenSSL 3.0 related changes in tests include:
  	  - TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 require security level 0 starting with 3.0 alpha 5.
  	  - SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites() and SSL_set_ciphersuites() ignore
  	    unknown ciphersuites starting with 3.0 alpha 11.
  	  - Error code and error string packing and formatting changes.
  	  - PEM_get_string_PrivateKey default algorithm requires legacy provider.
  	- See OpenSSL manual page migration_guide(7) for more information about
  	  changes in OpenSSL 3.0.
  	- Automatically detect OpenSSL installed via Homebrew on ARM-based macOS
  	  systems. Thanks to Graham Knop for the patch.
  	- Account for the divergence in TLSv1.3 ciphersuite names between OpenSSL and
  	  LibreSSL, which was causing failures of some TLSv1.3 tests with LibreSSL.
  	- In 36_verify.t, account for the presence of the X509_V_FLAG_LEGACY_VERIFY
  	  flag (signalling the use of the legacy X.509 verifier) in LibreSSL 3.3.2 and
  	  above.
  	- In 43_misc_functions.t, account for the fact that LibreSSL 3.2.0 and above
  	  implement TLSv1.3 without exposing a TLS1_3_VERSION constant.
  	- Expose OpenSSL 3.0 functions
  	  OSSL_LIB_CTX_get0_global_default, OSSL_PROVIDER_load,
  	  OSSL_PROVIDER_try_load, OSSL_PROVIDER_unload,
  	  OSSL_PROVIDER_available, OSSL_PROVIDER_do_all
  	  OSSL_PROVIDER_get0_name and OSSL_PROVIDER_self_test.
  	  Add test files 22_provider.t, 22_provider_try_load.t and
  	  22_provider_try_load_zero_retain.t.
  	- With OpenSSL 3.0 and later, the legacy provider is loaded in
  	  33_x509_create_cert.t to allow PEM_get_string_PrivateKey to
  	  continue working until its default encryption method is
  	  updated. Fixes GH-272 and closes GH-273.
  	- Remove the test suite's optional dependency on the non-core modules
  	  Test::Exception, Test::NoWarnings and Test::Warn. Tests that verify
  	  Net::SSLeay's behaviour when errors occur are now executed regardless of the
  	  availability of these modules.
  	- Fully automate the process of changing the list of constants exported by
  	  Net::SSLeay. Fixes GH-313.
  	- Perform function autoloading tests in the test suite. Fixes GH-311.
  	- In 36_verify.t, account for the fact that the X509_V_FLAG_LEGACY_VERIFY flag
  	  (signalling the use of the legacy X.509 verifier) is no longer exposed as of
  	  LibreSSL 3.4.1. Fixes GH-324.

Wed Jan 27 08:02:17 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.90:
  - New stable release incorporating all changes from developer releases
      1.89_01 to 1.89_05.
  - Summary of major changes since version 1.88:
      - Formalised libssl version support policy: all stable versions of OpenSSL
	in the 0.9.8 - 1.1.1 branches (with the exception of 0.9.8 - 0.9.8b) and
	all stable releases of LibreSSL in the 2.0 - 3.1 series are supported.
	The LibreSSL 3.2 series is not yet fully supported because its TLSv1.3
	implementation is not currently libssl-compatible.
      - Added support for LibreSSL on Windows when built with Visual C++.
      - Exposed P_X509_CRL_add_extensions, several SSL_CIPHER functions, and
	several stack functions.
      - Fixed crashes in the callback functions CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb and
	CTX_set_alpn_select_cb.
      - The test suite is now compatible with OpenSSL 1.1.1e onwards, as well as
	OpenSSL security level 2 (the default on many Linux distributions).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 27 11:29:57 UTC 2019 - Pedro Monreal Gonzalez <pmonrealgonzalez@suse.com>

- Update to 1.88
  1.88 2019-05-10
        - New stable release incorporating all changes from developer
          releases 1.86_01 to 1.86_11.
        - From this release, Net-SSLeay is switching to an "odd/even"
          developer/stable release version numbering system, like that of
          many core modules (e.g. ExtUtils::MakeMaker): developer releases
          will have an odd minor version number (and the usual "_xx" suffix),
          and stable releases will have an even minor version number. This
          means there is no Net-SSLeay 1.87.
        - Summary of major changes since version 1.85:
          - Mike McCauley has stepped down as maintainer. The new maintainers
            are Chris Novakovic, Heikki Vatiainen and Tuure Vartiainen.
          - The source code has moved from the now-defunct Debian Subversion
            server (alioth.debian.org) to GitHub
            (https://github.com/radiator-software/p5-net-ssleay).
          - Net-SSLeay is provided under the terms of the Artistic License
            2.0 - this has been the case since version 1.66, but references
            to other licenses remained in the source code, causing ambiguity.
          - Perl 5.8.1 or newer is now required to use Net-SSLeay. This has
            already been the case for some time in practice, as the test
            suite hasn't fully passed on Perl 5.6 for several years.
          - Much-improved compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.1, and improved
            support for TLS 1.3.
          - Fixed a long-standing bug in cb_data_advanced_put() that caused
            memory leaks when callbacks were frequently added and removed.
          - Support in the test suite for "hardened" OpenSSL configurations
            that set a default security level of 2 or higher (e.g., in the
            OpenSSL packages that ship with recent versions of Debian, Fedora
            and Ubuntu).

  1.86_11 2019-05-08
        - Clarified Net-SSLeay's licensing terms: the module distribution has
          been released under the terms of the Artistic License 2.0 since
          version 1.66; references to other licenses have been removed. Fixes
          RT#106314. Thanks to Kent Fredric for pointing out the ambiguity.
        - Replace the HTTPS hosts in the external tests (some of which were
          no longer online) with more resilient ones. Closes issue #26.

  1.86_10 2019-05-04
        - Use locally-generated certificate chain in local tests rather
          than the Twitter one, which changes regularly and breaks the
          test suite unnecessarily. Fixes RT#129201. Thanks to Petr Písař
          for the report and patch, and Steffen Ullrich for an alternative
          patch suggestion.
        - In t/local/09_ctx_new.t, rather than checking that the functions
          (CTX_)get_min_proto_version and (CTX_)get_max_proto_version return
          0x0000 (indicating the lowest and highest versions supported by
          libssl respectively, which is not the case if a run-time
          configuration is enforcing a different minimum or maximum), just
          check whether the returned value is one of those mentioned on the
          SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version(3) man page. Partially fixes
          RT#128025. Thanks to Slaven Rezić and Dmytro Zagashev for the
          downstream reports.
        - Move from 1024-bit keys/certificates to 2048-bit keys/certificates
          across the entire test suite. This removes the need to manually
          set the security level to 1 in tests that used the old keys, and
          fixes large numbers of test failures on modern Linux distributions
          that set the minimum OpenSSL security level to 2. Fixes RT#126270
          and the remainder of RT#128025. Thanks to Petr Písař and Slaven
          Rezić for the downstream reports.
        - In t/local/06_tcpecho.t and t/local/07_sslecho.t, connect to
          127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. This fixes these tests when
          executed inside a network sandbox that disrupts the behaviour of
          gethostbyname(). Fixes RT#128207. Thanks to Kent Fredric for the
          downstream report.

  1.86_09 2019-03-12
        - Add missing files to MANIFEST that prevented tests from passing
          when installing from the 1.86_08 release tarball.

  1.86_08 2019-03-12
        - Add and fix functions needed to properly implement client
          side session reuse for TLS 1.3 with using
          CTX_sess_set_new_cb. Newly exposed functions:
          SSL_SESSION_dup and SSL_SESSION_up_ref.
          Fixed functions: i2d_SSL_SESSION and d2i_SSL_SESSION.
          Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.
        - Add functions functions to allow reading multiple pems from
          file and creating untrusted chain: These functions allow you
          to:
          - Read in a PEM file with multiple certificates as a
            STACK_OF(X509_INFO)
          - Determine the size of the STACK_OF(X509_INFO) and value at
            an index, which allows you to loop over the stack.
          - Retrieve the X509 structure from each X509_INFO structure
            in the stack.
          Then you can create a new STACK_OF(X509) and push the X509
          structures onto the new stack. You can then pass this
          STACK_OF(X509) to X509_STORE_CTX_init which will allow you
          to add additional untrusted certificates to the chain for
          verification. Exposed functions are:
          PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio
          sk_X509_INFO_num
          sk_X509_INFO_value
          sk_X509_INFO_free
          sk_X509_new_null
          sk_X509_free
          sk_X509_push
          New function implemented by Net::SSLeay:
          P_X509_INFO_get_x509
          Thanks to Marc Reisner.
        - Add functions and constants that are necessary to verify a
          certificate using a hash directory outside of an SSL/TLS
          connection. Newly exposed functions:
          X509_STORE_CTX_init
          X509_STORE_CTX_free
          X509_STORE_new
          X509_STORE_free
          X509_STORE_add_lookup
          X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir
          X509_LOOKUP_add_dir
          Newly exposed constants:
          X509_FILETYPE_ASN1
          X509_FILETYPE_DEFAULT
          X509_FILETYPE_PEM
          Thanks to Marc Reisner.
        - Declare n_a in ssleay_set_psk_client_callback_invoke and
          ssleay_ctx_set_psk_client_callback_invoke to avoid a compilation
          error with Perl versions below 5.8.8. Fixes RT#128030. Thanks to
          Graham Ollis for the report.
        - Add X509_get0_serialNumber. Thanks to Marc Reisner.
        - Enable Travis CI for LibreSSL 2.2.1, 2.7.5, 2.8.3 and 2.9.0
          on Perl 5.20 and more recent.
        - Expose the following functions for curve and group selection:
          - CTX_set_ecdh_auto, set_ecdh_auto
          - CTX_set1_curves_list, set1_curves_list
          - CTX_set1_groups_list, set1_groups_list
          Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  5 14:04:18 UTC 2019 - Pedro Monreal Gonzalez <pmonrealgonzalez@suse.com>

- Update to 1.86_07
  1.86_07 2018-12-13
        - Net::SSLeay::RSA_generate_key() now prefers using
          RSA_generate_key_ex. This avois deprecated RSA_generate_key
          and allows removing the only Android specific code in
          SSLeay.xs. Fixes RT#127593. Thanks to Rouven Weiler.
        - SSL_CTX_get0_param, SSL_CTX_get0_param,
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add1_host,
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_hostflags,
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get0_peername,
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_email, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip and
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip_asc added in 1.83 for OpenSSL
          1.0.2 and later are now available with LibreSSL 2.7.0 and
          later.
        - get_keyblock_size() now gets the MAC secret size from the
          cipher on LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later, rather than reaching
          into libssl internals. This effectively takes the OpenSSL
          1.1 code path for LibreSSL 2.7.0 instead of the OpenSSL 1.0
          code path.  Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
        - get_client_random and get_server_random now use API
          functions supported by LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later. Thanks to
          Alexander Bluhm.
        - Add X509_check_host(), X509_check_email(), X509_check_ip(),
          and X509_check_ip_asc() for LibreSSL 2.5.0 and later. Thanks
          to Alexander Bluhm.
        - OpenSSL_version() and OpenSSL_version_num() are available
          with LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
        - Use OPENSSL_cleanse() instead of memset(). Fixes
          RT#116599. Thanks to A. Sinan Unur.

  1.86_06 2018-09-29
        - Net::SSLeay::read() and SSL_peek() now check SSL_get_error()
          for SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN for return values <= 0 to make
          Net::SSLeay::read() behave more like underlying OpenSSL
          function SSL_read().
          Convenience function ssl_read_all() now does an automatic
          retry when ERROR_WANT_READ or ERROR_WANT_WRITE is returned
          with Net::SSLeay::read().
          Convenience function ssl_read_until() now uses
          Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_all() instead of
          Net::SSLeay::read(). Tests 07_sslecho.t and 36_verify.t were
          also updated to use ssl_read_all() and ssl_write_all(). The
          tests now also disable TLSv1.3 session tickets and ignore
          SIGPIPE to avoid this signal when the client has finished
          before server has sent session tickets and called
          Net::SSLeay::accept().
          Thanks to Petr Pisar and Sebastian Andrzej Siewior for the
          patches (in #RT125218).
        - Fix a memory leak in cb_data_advanced_put. Fixes
          RT#127131. Noticed, investigated and patched by Paul
          Evans. Thanks!
        - Enable OpenSSL 1.1.1-pre9 with Travis CI.
        - Add SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets, SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets,
          SSL_set_num_ticket and SSL_get_num_tickets for controlling
          the number of TLSv1.3 session tickets that are issued.  Add
          tests in 44_sess.t. Parts taken from a larger patch by Petr
          Pisar of RedHat.
        - Add SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites and SSL_set_ciphersuites for
          configuring the available TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Add tests in
          43_misc_functions.t and clarify SSL_client_version tests.
        - Add SSL_CTX_set_security_level, SSL_CTX_get_security_level,
          SSL_set_security_level and SSL_get_security_level.
          Add new test file 65_security_level.t.
          All courtesy of Damyan Ivanov of Debian project.
        - Fix export_keying_material return value check and context
          handling. SSL_export_keying_material use_context is now
          correctly set to non-zero value when context is an empty
          string. This affects values exported with TLSv1.2 and earlier.
          Update documentation in NetSSLeay.pod and add tests
          in t/local/45_export.t.
        - Add RAND_priv_bytes. Add new test file t/local/10_rand.t for
          RAND_bytes, RAND_pseudo_bytes, RAND_priv_bytes, RAND_status,
          RAND_poll, RAND_file_name and RAND_load_file.
        - Update documentation for RAND_*bytes return values and
          RAND_file_name behaviour with LibreSSL.
        - Add SSL_SESSION_is_resumable. Add and update tests in 44_sess.t.
        - Set OpenSSL security level to 1 in tests that use the test suite's
          (1024-bit) RSA keys, which allows the test suite to pass when
          Net-SSLeay is built against an OpenSSL with a higher default
          security level. Fixes RT#126987. Thanks to Petr Pisar (in
          RT#126270) and Damyan Ivanov (in RT#126987) for the reports and
          patches, and to Damyan Ivanov for the preferred patch.
        - Add SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb and SSL_CTX_sess_set_remove_cb.
          Add new test file 44_sess.t for these and future session
          related tests for which no specific test file is needed.
        - Add SSL_get_version, SSL_client_version and SSL_is_dtls.
        - Add SSL_peek_ex, SSL_read_ex, SSL_write_ex and SSL_has_pending.
          Add tests in t/local/11_read.t
        - Add SSL_CTX_set_post_handshake_auth contributed by Paul
          Howarth. Add SSL_set_post_handshake_auth,
          SSL_verify_client_post_handshake and constant
          SSL_VERIFY_POST_HANDSHAKE.
        - Applied a patch to set_cert_and_key() from Damyan Ivanov,
          Debian Perl Group. This function now returns errors from
          library's error stack only when an underlying routine
          fails. Unrelated errors are now skipped. Fixes RT#126988.
        - Add support for TLSv1.3 via $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version.
        - Enhance t/local/43_misc_functions.t get_keyblock_size test
          to work better with AEAD ciphers.
        - Add constants SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT and
          SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY for TLSv1.3
        - Fix compile time DEFINE=-DSHOW_XS_DEBUG to work with
          non-threaded Perls. Fixes RT#127027. Thanks to SREZIC for
          the report. Also fix other minor compile warnings.

  1.86_05 2018-08-22
        - Net-SSLeay now requires at least Perl 5.8.1. This is a
          formalisation of what has been the de facto case for some time,
          as the distribution hasn't compiled and passed its tests on Perl
          5.005 for several years.
        - Increment Net::SSLeay::Handle's version number to keep it in sync
          with Net::SSLeay's, thus satisfying Kwalitee's consistent_version
          metric.
        - Re-enable the d2i_X509_bio() test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t
          for LibreSSL. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
        - Automatically detect new library names on Windows for OpenSSL
          1.1.0 onwards (libcrypto, libssl). Fixes part of RT#121084. Thanks
          to Jean-Damien Durand.
        - Fix a typo preventing OpenSSL libraries built with the VC compiler
          (i.e. ones with a ".lib" suffix) from being automatically detected
          on Windows. Fixes part of RT#121084. Thanks to Jean-Damien Durand.
        - Add missing call to va_end() following va_start() in TRACE().
          Fixes RT#126028. Thanks to Jitka Plesnikova.
        - Added SSL_in_init() and the related functions for all
          libraries and their versions. All return 0 or 1 as
          documented by OpenSSL 1.1.1. Use of these functions is
          recommended over using constants returned by get_state() and
          state(). New constants TLS_ST_*, used by OpenSSL 1.1.0 and
          later, will not be made available by Net::SSLeay.

  1.86_04 2018-07-30
        - Re-add SSLv3_method() for OpenSSL 1.0.2 and above. Fixes
          RT#101484.
        - Don't expose ENGINE-related functions when building against
          OpenSSL builds without ENGINE support. Fixes RT#121538. Thanks to
          Paul Green.
        - Automatically detect OpenSSL 1.0.x on VMS, and update VMS
          installation instructions to reflect removal of Module::Install
          from the build system. Fixes RT#124388. Thanks to Craig A. Berry.
        - Prevent memory leak in OCSP_cert2ids() and OCSP_response_verify().
          Fixes RT#125273. Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.

  1.86_03 2018-07-19
        - Convert packaging to ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Thanks to mohawk2.
        - Module::Install is no longer a prerequisite when building
          from the reposistory.
        - Re-apply patch from ETJ permitting configure and build in
          places with a space in the name.

  1.86_02 2018-07-06
        - Removed inc/ from repository. Module::Install is now a
          prerequisite when building from the repository. This allowed
          also removing "." from Makefile.PL lib path which was added
          in version 1.81. These updates require no changes when
          building from release packages. They also help AppVeyor
          builds to work better with old Perls.
        - Added CONTRIBUTING.md, reformatted the previous Changes
          entry to use CPAN::Changes::Spec guidelines and removed
          unused version control tags from comments.

  1.86_01 2018-07-04
        [Version control system change]
        - Chris Novakovic did a full conversion from the old Debian
          hosted SVN repository to git.
        - Fixes to commit metadata, branches and tags that git-svn
          couldn't handle or had no way of handling, were done
          manually or semi-automatically afterwards. For instance, the
          "git-svn-id:" lines that git-svn appends to commit messages
          were kept because Mike used SVN revision numbers in RT
          replies to indicate when bugs had been fixed/patches applied
          (which may be useful for future reference).
        - All commits were replayed onto a single master branch rather
          than having separate dead-end branches for the old SVN
          version tags (as this seems more "git-like").
        - New lightweight tags were created for each public release
          going back as far as the start of the SVN repository using
          data from MetaCPAN (cross-referencing with the changelog
          when it wasn't clear when a release was cut from the SVN
          repo).
        - Florian's and Mike's email addresses were mapped to git
          author/committer IDs
        [Continuous integration]
        - Travis CI configuration was added for automated testing on
           Linux using 64 bit Ubuntu Trusty. Build matrix dimensions
           are: Perl 5.8 - 5.26 x OpenSSL 0.9.8zh - 1.1.0h. Only the
           currently latest version for each major Perl and OpenSSL
           release is chosen.
        - AppVeyor configuration was added for automated testing on
          Windows. Build matrix dimensions are: Perl 5.8 - 5.26 x
          32bit and 64bit Perl environment x Windows Server 2012R2 and
          Windows Server 2016. The Perl environment is Strawberry Perl
          and its OpenSSL is used with builds. Only the latest major
          versions are used, similarly to Travis CI. Net-SSLeay PPM
          and PPD files are made available as artifacts.
        - Added README.md with link to master branch build and test
          status. Did minor updates to README and other misc files.
        [Release packaging]
        - Files t/local/43_misc_functions.t and
          t/local/65_ticket_sharing_2.t were missing from MANIFEST.
        - Updated inc/ directory with Module::Install 1.19. Updated
          Makefile.PL author and resource information. Synced
          SSLeay.pm under ext/ with the latest changes under
          inc/. Reordered use imports so that META.yml gets correctly
          regenerated. More Module::Install related changes will
          follow.
        [Repository amd maintainer change]
        - Net::SSLeay functionality was not changed in this
          release. Work was done to switch version contorol systems,
          add automated testing, update module packaging and change
          the primary maintainer. This coincided with the decommission
          of previous code repository service on alioth.debian.org.
        - The module is now primarily maintained by Tuure Vartiainen
          and Heikki Vatiainen of Radiator Software. The new
          repository location is
          https://github.com/radiator-software/p5-net-ssleay

- updated to 1.68
      Fixed a problem on OSX when macports openssl 1.x is installed: headers from
      macport were found but older OSX openssl libraries were linked, resulting
      in "Symbol not found: _EVP_MD_do_all_sorted".
      Added notes about runtime error "no OPENSSL_Applink", when calling
      Net::SSLeay::P_PKCS12_load_file.
 
 
 1.67 2015-01-17
      Improvements to inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm to handle the
      case whe there are muliple OPENSSLs installed. Patch from HBRAND
      Fixed a documentation error in get_peer_cert_chain, reported by tejas.
      Fixed a problem with building on Windows that prevented correct OpenSSL
      directory detection with version 1.0.1j as delivered with Shining Light OpenSSL.
      Fixed a problem with building on Windows that prevented finding MT or MD
      versions of SSL libraries.
      Updated doc in README.Win32 to build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express.
      Added Windows crypt32 library to Windows linking as some compilers/platforms seem to
      require it and it is innocuous otherwise. For Steve Hay.
      Fixed a failure in t/external/20_cert_chain.t where some platforms do not
      have HTTPS in /etc/services. Reported and patched by Gisle Aas.
      Recent 1.0.2 betas have dropped the SSLv3_method function. 
      This patch leaves out the function on newer versions, much the same as
      the SSLv2 deprecation is handled. Patch from Tom Molesworth.
      Fix the ALPN test, which was incorrectly failing on OpenSSL due to the
      LibreSSL check (earlier versions bailed out before that line).Patch from
      Tom Molesworth. 
 
 1.66 2014-08-21
      Fixed compile problem with perl prior to 5.8.8, similar to
      RT#76267. Reported by Graham Knop.
      Fixed a problem with Socket::IPPROTO_TCP on early perls.
      After discussions with the community and the original author Sampo
      Kellomaki, the license conditions have been changed to "Perl Artisitic
      License 2.0".
 
 
 1.65  2014-07-14
      Added note to doc to make it clear that X509_get_subjectAltNames returns a
      packed binary IP address for type 7 - GEN_IPADD.
      Improvements to SSL_OCSP_response_verify to compile under non c99
      compilers. Requested by MERIJNB.
      Port to Android, contributed by Brian Fraser. Includes Android specific
      version of RSA_generate_key.
      Added LibreSSL support, patch provided by Alexander Bluhm. Thanks!
      Patch that fixes the support for SSL_set_info_callback and adds
      SSL_CTX_set_info_callback and SSL_set_state. Support for these functions is
      necessary to either detect renegotiation or to enforce
      renegotiation. Contributed by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
      Fixed a problem with SSL_set_state not available on some early OpenSSLs,
      patched by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
      Removed arbitrary size limits from calls to tcp_read_all in tcpcat() and
      http_cat().
      Removed unnecessary Debian_SPANTS.txt from MANIFEST. Again.

- updated to 1.64

  Fixes for test ocsp.t. Test now does not fail if HTTP::Tiny is not
  installed.
  Fixed repository in META.yml.
  Fixed a problem with SSL_get_peer_cert_chain: if the SSL handshake
  results in an anonymous authentication, like ADH-DES-CBC3-SHA,
  get_peer_cert_chain will not return an empty list, but instead return the
  SSL object. Reported and fixed by Steffen
  Ullrich. Thanks.
  Fixed a problem where patch
  https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=3009244da47b989c4cc59ba02cf81a4e9d8f8431

 1.63 2014-05-19
      Fixed error in version number in META.yml

 1.62 2014-05-19
      Improvements to OCSP support: It turns out that some CA (like Verisign)
      sign the OCSP response with the CA we have in the trust store and don't
      attach this certifcate in the response.  But OpenSSL by itself only
      considers the certificates included in the response and
      SSL_OCSP_response_verify added the certificates in the chain too.
      Now, we also add the trusted CA from the store which
      signed the lowest chain certificate, at least if we could not verify the
      OCSP response without doing it. Patch from Steffen
      Ullrich. Thanks.
      Fixed some compiler warnings.

 1.61 2014-05-12
      Changes calloc to Newx and free to Safefree, otherwise there might be
      problems because calloc is done from a different memory pool than free (depends
      on the build options for perl, but seen on Windows). Patch from Steffen
      Ullrich. Thanks.


 1.60 2014-05-10
      Fixed a typo in an error message. Patch from gregor herrmann. Thanks.
      Fixed a problem with building with openssl that does not support
      OCSP. Also fixed some newly introduced warnings
      if compiled with -Wall. Patch from Steffen Ullrich. Thanks.
      fix build-failure on most Debian architectures:
      SSLeay.xs: In function 'XS_Net__SSLeay_OCSP_response_results':
      SSLeay.xs:5602:3: error: format not a string literal and no format
      arguments. Patch from  gregor herrmann.


 1.59 2014-05-10
      Fixed local/30_error.t, so that tests do not fail if diagnostics are
      enabled.
      Fixed error messages about undefined strings used with length or
      split. Reported and patched by Peter Heuchert.
      Improvements to configuration of OPTIMIZE flags, to prevent overriding
      of perls expected optimization flags. Caution: HPUX aCC optimize options are special.
      SSL_peek() now returns openssl error code as second item when called in
      array context, same as SSL_read. Patch from Andreas Mohr.
      Fixed some warnings.
      Added support for tlsv1.1 tlsv1.2 via $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version. Patch
      from Andreas Mohr.
      Improve examples in 'Using other perl modules based on
      Net::SSLeay'. Patched by Andreas Mohr.
      Added support for OCSP. Patched by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
      Added missing t/external/ocsp.t

- updated to 1.58
      Always use size_t for strlen() return value, requested by Alexander Bluhm.
      t/external/20_cert_chain.t was missing from dist.
      Version number in META.yml was incorrect
      Improvements to test t/external/20_cert_chain.t to provoke following bug:
      Fixed crash due to SSL_get_peer_cert_chain incorrectly free'ing the chain
      after use.
      Fixed a problem when compiling against openssl where OPENSSL_NO_EC is set.

 1.57 2014-01-09
      Fixed remaining problems with test suite: pod coverage and kwalitee tests
      are only enabled with RELEASE_TESTING=1

 1.56 2014-01-08
      Fixed a typo in documentation of BEAST Attack, patched by gregor
      herrmann.
      Added LICENSE file copied form OpenSSL distribution to prevent complaints
      from various versions of kwalitee.
      Adjusted license: in META.yml to be 'openssl'
      Adds support for the basic operations necessary to support ECDH for PFS,
      e.g. EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name, EC_KEY_free and SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh.
      Improvements to t/handle/external/50_external.t to handle the case when a
      test connection was not possible. Patched by Alexandr Ciornii.
      Added support for ALPN TLS extension. Patch from Lubomir Rintel. Tested
      with openssl-1.0.2-stable-SNAP-20131205.
      Fix an use-after-free error. Patch from Lubomir Rintel.
      Fixed a problem with  Invalid comparison on OBJ_cmp result in
      t/local/36_verify.t. Contributed by paul.
      Added support for get_peer_cert_chain(). Patch by Markus Benning.
      Fixed a bug that could cause stack faults: mixed up PUTBACK with SPAGAIN in ssleay_RSA_generate_key_cb_invoke()
      a final PUTBACK is needed here. A second issue is also fixed:
      cb->data defaults to &PL_sv_undef but throught the code you do not check
      against &PL_sv_undef, just NULL.
      To avoid passing the 3rd optional arg at all, do not create it. This fixes all the
      cb->data checks and wrong refcounts on &PL_sv_undef. Patched by Reini Urban.
      Deleted support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname: it is not included in
      OpenSSL git master.

    TLSv1_2_method(), where available in the underlying openssl.
  * Added CRL support functions X509_CRL_get_ext(),
    X509_CRL_get_ext_by_NID(), X509_CRL_get_ext_count(). Patch from
    Franck Youssef.
  * Added support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname() required for DANE
    support in openssl*1.0.2 and later. SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname()
    was added to OpenSSL with the financial assistance of .SE.
  * Added X509_NAME_new and X509_NAME_hash, patched by Franck Youssef.
  * Added support for SSL_export_keying_material where present
  * Net::SSLeay::ASN1_INTEGER_get, since it works differntly on 32 and
    64 bit platforms. Updated author and distribution location details
    to airspayce.com
  * Fixed a few compiler warnings in SSLeay.xs.  Most of them are just
    signed/unsigned pointer mismatches but there is one that actually
    fixes returning what would be an arbitrary value off the stack
    from get_my_thread_id if it happened to be called in a
    non*threaded build.
  * Added SSL_set_tlsext_host_name, SSL_get_servername,
    SSL_get_servername_type, SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback
    for server side Server Name Indication (SNI) support. Patched by
    kmx.
  * Improvements to Net::SSLeay::read to make it easier to use with
    non*blocking IO Added documentation about how to mitigatxe various
    SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.
  * initializes the SSL library at most once.
  * Patch from kmx to protect SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms from multiple
    loads and reentrancy in multi*threaded perls.
- remove perl-Net-SSLeay-1.36.diff: no obvious nor documented justification
- remove perl-Net-SSLeay-1.36-undefined.diff: no longer applies
