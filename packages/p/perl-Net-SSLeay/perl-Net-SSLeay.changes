- Update to 1.88
  1.88 2019-05-10
        - New stable release incorporating all changes from developer
          releases 1.86_01 to 1.86_11.
        - From this release, Net-SSLeay is switching to an "odd/even"
          developer/stable release version numbering system, like that of
          many core modules (e.g. ExtUtils::MakeMaker): developer releases
          will have an odd minor version number (and the usual "_xx" suffix),
          and stable releases will have an even minor version number. This
          means there is no Net-SSLeay 1.87.
        - Summary of major changes since version 1.85:
          - Mike McCauley has stepped down as maintainer. The new maintainers
            are Chris Novakovic, Heikki Vatiainen and Tuure Vartiainen.
          - The source code has moved from the now-defunct Debian Subversion
            server (alioth.debian.org) to GitHub
            (https://github.com/radiator-software/p5-net-ssleay).
          - Net-SSLeay is provided under the terms of the Artistic License
            2.0 - this has been the case since version 1.66, but references
            to other licenses remained in the source code, causing ambiguity.
          - Perl 5.8.1 or newer is now required to use Net-SSLeay. This has
            already been the case for some time in practice, as the test
            suite hasn't fully passed on Perl 5.6 for several years.
          - Much-improved compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.1, and improved
            support for TLS 1.3.
          - Fixed a long-standing bug in cb_data_advanced_put() that caused
            memory leaks when callbacks were frequently added and removed.
          - Support in the test suite for "hardened" OpenSSL configurations
            that set a default security level of 2 or higher (e.g., in the
            OpenSSL packages that ship with recent versions of Debian, Fedora
            and Ubuntu).

  1.86_11 2019-05-08
        - Clarified Net-SSLeay's licensing terms: the module distribution has
          been released under the terms of the Artistic License 2.0 since
          version 1.66; references to other licenses have been removed. Fixes
          RT#106314. Thanks to Kent Fredric for pointing out the ambiguity.
        - Replace the HTTPS hosts in the external tests (some of which were
          no longer online) with more resilient ones. Closes issue #26.

  1.86_10 2019-05-04
        - Use locally-generated certificate chain in local tests rather
          than the Twitter one, which changes regularly and breaks the
          test suite unnecessarily. Fixes RT#129201. Thanks to Petr Písař
          for the report and patch, and Steffen Ullrich for an alternative
          patch suggestion.
        - In t/local/09_ctx_new.t, rather than checking that the functions
          (CTX_)get_min_proto_version and (CTX_)get_max_proto_version return
          0x0000 (indicating the lowest and highest versions supported by
          libssl respectively, which is not the case if a run-time
          configuration is enforcing a different minimum or maximum), just
          check whether the returned value is one of those mentioned on the
          SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version(3) man page. Partially fixes
          RT#128025. Thanks to Slaven Rezić and Dmytro Zagashev for the
          downstream reports.
        - Move from 1024-bit keys/certificates to 2048-bit keys/certificates
          across the entire test suite. This removes the need to manually
          set the security level to 1 in tests that used the old keys, and
          fixes large numbers of test failures on modern Linux distributions
          that set the minimum OpenSSL security level to 2. Fixes RT#126270
          and the remainder of RT#128025. Thanks to Petr Písař and Slaven
          Rezić for the downstream reports.
        - In t/local/06_tcpecho.t and t/local/07_sslecho.t, connect to
          127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. This fixes these tests when
          executed inside a network sandbox that disrupts the behaviour of
          gethostbyname(). Fixes RT#128207. Thanks to Kent Fredric for the
          downstream report.

  1.86_09 2019-03-12
        - Add missing files to MANIFEST that prevented tests from passing
          when installing from the 1.86_08 release tarball.

  1.86_08 2019-03-12
        - Add and fix functions needed to properly implement client
          side session reuse for TLS 1.3 with using
          CTX_sess_set_new_cb. Newly exposed functions:
          SSL_SESSION_dup and SSL_SESSION_up_ref.
          Fixed functions: i2d_SSL_SESSION and d2i_SSL_SESSION.
          Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.
        - Add functions functions to allow reading multiple pems from
          file and creating untrusted chain: These functions allow you
          to:
          - Read in a PEM file with multiple certificates as a
            STACK_OF(X509_INFO)
          - Determine the size of the STACK_OF(X509_INFO) and value at
            an index, which allows you to loop over the stack.
          - Retrieve the X509 structure from each X509_INFO structure
            in the stack.
          Then you can create a new STACK_OF(X509) and push the X509
          structures onto the new stack. You can then pass this
          STACK_OF(X509) to X509_STORE_CTX_init which will allow you
          to add additional untrusted certificates to the chain for
          verification. Exposed functions are:
          PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio
          sk_X509_INFO_num
          sk_X509_INFO_value
          sk_X509_INFO_free
          sk_X509_new_null
          sk_X509_free
          sk_X509_push
          New function implemented by Net::SSLeay:
          P_X509_INFO_get_x509
          Thanks to Marc Reisner.
        - Add functions and constants that are necessary to verify a
          certificate using a hash directory outside of an SSL/TLS
          connection. Newly exposed functions:
          X509_STORE_CTX_init
          X509_STORE_CTX_free
          X509_STORE_new
          X509_STORE_free
          X509_STORE_add_lookup
          X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir
          X509_LOOKUP_add_dir
          Newly exposed constants:
          X509_FILETYPE_ASN1
          X509_FILETYPE_DEFAULT
          X509_FILETYPE_PEM
          Thanks to Marc Reisner.
        - Declare n_a in ssleay_set_psk_client_callback_invoke and
          ssleay_ctx_set_psk_client_callback_invoke to avoid a compilation
          error with Perl versions below 5.8.8. Fixes RT#128030. Thanks to
          Graham Ollis for the report.
        - Add X509_get0_serialNumber. Thanks to Marc Reisner.
        - Enable Travis CI for LibreSSL 2.2.1, 2.7.5, 2.8.3 and 2.9.0
          on Perl 5.20 and more recent.
        - Expose the following functions for curve and group selection:
          - CTX_set_ecdh_auto, set_ecdh_auto
          - CTX_set1_curves_list, set1_curves_list
          - CTX_set1_groups_list, set1_groups_list
          Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  5 14:04:18 UTC 2019 - Pedro Monreal Gonzalez <pmonrealgonzalez@suse.com>

- Update to 1.86_07
  1.86_07 2018-12-13
        - Net::SSLeay::RSA_generate_key() now prefers using
          RSA_generate_key_ex. This avois deprecated RSA_generate_key
          and allows removing the only Android specific code in
          SSLeay.xs. Fixes RT#127593. Thanks to Rouven Weiler.
        - SSL_CTX_get0_param, SSL_CTX_get0_param,
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add1_host,
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_hostflags,
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get0_peername,
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_email, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip and
          X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip_asc added in 1.83 for OpenSSL
          1.0.2 and later are now available with LibreSSL 2.7.0 and
          later.
        - get_keyblock_size() now gets the MAC secret size from the
          cipher on LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later, rather than reaching
          into libssl internals. This effectively takes the OpenSSL
          1.1 code path for LibreSSL 2.7.0 instead of the OpenSSL 1.0
          code path.  Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
        - get_client_random and get_server_random now use API
          functions supported by LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later. Thanks to
          Alexander Bluhm.
        - Add X509_check_host(), X509_check_email(), X509_check_ip(),
          and X509_check_ip_asc() for LibreSSL 2.5.0 and later. Thanks
          to Alexander Bluhm.
        - OpenSSL_version() and OpenSSL_version_num() are available
          with LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
        - Use OPENSSL_cleanse() instead of memset(). Fixes
          RT#116599. Thanks to A. Sinan Unur.

  1.86_06 2018-09-29
        - Net::SSLeay::read() and SSL_peek() now check SSL_get_error()
          for SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN for return values <= 0 to make
          Net::SSLeay::read() behave more like underlying OpenSSL
          function SSL_read().
          Convenience function ssl_read_all() now does an automatic
          retry when ERROR_WANT_READ or ERROR_WANT_WRITE is returned
          with Net::SSLeay::read().
          Convenience function ssl_read_until() now uses
          Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_all() instead of
          Net::SSLeay::read(). Tests 07_sslecho.t and 36_verify.t were
          also updated to use ssl_read_all() and ssl_write_all(). The
          tests now also disable TLSv1.3 session tickets and ignore
          SIGPIPE to avoid this signal when the client has finished
          before server has sent session tickets and called
          Net::SSLeay::accept().
          Thanks to Petr Pisar and Sebastian Andrzej Siewior for the
          patches (in #RT125218).
        - Fix a memory leak in cb_data_advanced_put. Fixes
          RT#127131. Noticed, investigated and patched by Paul
          Evans. Thanks!
        - Enable OpenSSL 1.1.1-pre9 with Travis CI.
        - Add SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets, SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets,
          SSL_set_num_ticket and SSL_get_num_tickets for controlling
          the number of TLSv1.3 session tickets that are issued.  Add
          tests in 44_sess.t. Parts taken from a larger patch by Petr
          Pisar of RedHat.
        - Add SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites and SSL_set_ciphersuites for
          configuring the available TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Add tests in
          43_misc_functions.t and clarify SSL_client_version tests.
        - Add SSL_CTX_set_security_level, SSL_CTX_get_security_level,
          SSL_set_security_level and SSL_get_security_level.
          Add new test file 65_security_level.t.
          All courtesy of Damyan Ivanov of Debian project.
        - Fix export_keying_material return value check and context
          handling. SSL_export_keying_material use_context is now
          correctly set to non-zero value when context is an empty
          string. This affects values exported with TLSv1.2 and earlier.
          Update documentation in NetSSLeay.pod and add tests
          in t/local/45_export.t.
        - Add RAND_priv_bytes. Add new test file t/local/10_rand.t for
          RAND_bytes, RAND_pseudo_bytes, RAND_priv_bytes, RAND_status,
          RAND_poll, RAND_file_name and RAND_load_file.
        - Update documentation for RAND_*bytes return values and
          RAND_file_name behaviour with LibreSSL.
        - Add SSL_SESSION_is_resumable. Add and update tests in 44_sess.t.
        - Set OpenSSL security level to 1 in tests that use the test suite's
          (1024-bit) RSA keys, which allows the test suite to pass when
          Net-SSLeay is built against an OpenSSL with a higher default
          security level. Fixes RT#126987. Thanks to Petr Pisar (in
          RT#126270) and Damyan Ivanov (in RT#126987) for the reports and
          patches, and to Damyan Ivanov for the preferred patch.
        - Add SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb and SSL_CTX_sess_set_remove_cb.
          Add new test file 44_sess.t for these and future session
          related tests for which no specific test file is needed.
        - Add SSL_get_version, SSL_client_version and SSL_is_dtls.
        - Add SSL_peek_ex, SSL_read_ex, SSL_write_ex and SSL_has_pending.
          Add tests in t/local/11_read.t
        - Add SSL_CTX_set_post_handshake_auth contributed by Paul
          Howarth. Add SSL_set_post_handshake_auth,
          SSL_verify_client_post_handshake and constant
          SSL_VERIFY_POST_HANDSHAKE.
        - Applied a patch to set_cert_and_key() from Damyan Ivanov,
          Debian Perl Group. This function now returns errors from
          library's error stack only when an underlying routine
          fails. Unrelated errors are now skipped. Fixes RT#126988.
        - Add support for TLSv1.3 via $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version.
        - Enhance t/local/43_misc_functions.t get_keyblock_size test
          to work better with AEAD ciphers.
        - Add constants SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT and
          SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY for TLSv1.3
        - Fix compile time DEFINE=-DSHOW_XS_DEBUG to work with
          non-threaded Perls. Fixes RT#127027. Thanks to SREZIC for
          the report. Also fix other minor compile warnings.

  1.86_05 2018-08-22
        - Net-SSLeay now requires at least Perl 5.8.1. This is a
          formalisation of what has been the de facto case for some time,
          as the distribution hasn't compiled and passed its tests on Perl
          5.005 for several years.
        - Increment Net::SSLeay::Handle's version number to keep it in sync
          with Net::SSLeay's, thus satisfying Kwalitee's consistent_version
          metric.
        - Re-enable the d2i_X509_bio() test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t
          for LibreSSL. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
        - Automatically detect new library names on Windows for OpenSSL
          1.1.0 onwards (libcrypto, libssl). Fixes part of RT#121084. Thanks
          to Jean-Damien Durand.
        - Fix a typo preventing OpenSSL libraries built with the VC compiler
          (i.e. ones with a ".lib" suffix) from being automatically detected
          on Windows. Fixes part of RT#121084. Thanks to Jean-Damien Durand.
        - Add missing call to va_end() following va_start() in TRACE().
          Fixes RT#126028. Thanks to Jitka Plesnikova.
        - Added SSL_in_init() and the related functions for all
          libraries and their versions. All return 0 or 1 as
          documented by OpenSSL 1.1.1. Use of these functions is
          recommended over using constants returned by get_state() and
          state(). New constants TLS_ST_*, used by OpenSSL 1.1.0 and
          later, will not be made available by Net::SSLeay.

  1.86_04 2018-07-30
        - Re-add SSLv3_method() for OpenSSL 1.0.2 and above. Fixes
          RT#101484.
        - Don't expose ENGINE-related functions when building against
          OpenSSL builds without ENGINE support. Fixes RT#121538. Thanks to
          Paul Green.
        - Automatically detect OpenSSL 1.0.x on VMS, and update VMS
          installation instructions to reflect removal of Module::Install
          from the build system. Fixes RT#124388. Thanks to Craig A. Berry.
        - Prevent memory leak in OCSP_cert2ids() and OCSP_response_verify().
          Fixes RT#125273. Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.

  1.86_03 2018-07-19
        - Convert packaging to ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Thanks to mohawk2.
        - Module::Install is no longer a prerequisite when building
          from the reposistory.
        - Re-apply patch from ETJ permitting configure and build in
          places with a space in the name.

  1.86_02 2018-07-06
        - Removed inc/ from repository. Module::Install is now a
          prerequisite when building from the repository. This allowed
          also removing "." from Makefile.PL lib path which was added
          in version 1.81. These updates require no changes when
          building from release packages. They also help AppVeyor
          builds to work better with old Perls.
        - Added CONTRIBUTING.md, reformatted the previous Changes
          entry to use CPAN::Changes::Spec guidelines and removed
          unused version control tags from comments.

  1.86_01 2018-07-04
        [Version control system change]
        - Chris Novakovic did a full conversion from the old Debian
          hosted SVN repository to git.
        - Fixes to commit metadata, branches and tags that git-svn
          couldn't handle or had no way of handling, were done
          manually or semi-automatically afterwards. For instance, the
          "git-svn-id:" lines that git-svn appends to commit messages
          were kept because Mike used SVN revision numbers in RT
          replies to indicate when bugs had been fixed/patches applied
          (which may be useful for future reference).
        - All commits were replayed onto a single master branch rather
          than having separate dead-end branches for the old SVN
          version tags (as this seems more "git-like").
        - New lightweight tags were created for each public release
          going back as far as the start of the SVN repository using
          data from MetaCPAN (cross-referencing with the changelog
          when it wasn't clear when a release was cut from the SVN
          repo).
        - Florian's and Mike's email addresses were mapped to git
          author/committer IDs
        [Continuous integration]
        - Travis CI configuration was added for automated testing on
           Linux using 64 bit Ubuntu Trusty. Build matrix dimensions
           are: Perl 5.8 - 5.26 x OpenSSL 0.9.8zh - 1.1.0h. Only the
           currently latest version for each major Perl and OpenSSL
           release is chosen.
        - AppVeyor configuration was added for automated testing on
          Windows. Build matrix dimensions are: Perl 5.8 - 5.26 x
          32bit and 64bit Perl environment x Windows Server 2012R2 and
          Windows Server 2016. The Perl environment is Strawberry Perl
          and its OpenSSL is used with builds. Only the latest major
          versions are used, similarly to Travis CI. Net-SSLeay PPM
          and PPD files are made available as artifacts.
        - Added README.md with link to master branch build and test
          status. Did minor updates to README and other misc files.
        [Release packaging]
        - Files t/local/43_misc_functions.t and
          t/local/65_ticket_sharing_2.t were missing from MANIFEST.
        - Updated inc/ directory with Module::Install 1.19. Updated
          Makefile.PL author and resource information. Synced
          SSLeay.pm under ext/ with the latest changes under
          inc/. Reordered use imports so that META.yml gets correctly
          regenerated. More Module::Install related changes will
          follow.
        [Repository amd maintainer change]
        - Net::SSLeay functionality was not changed in this
          release. Work was done to switch version contorol systems,
          add automated testing, update module packaging and change
          the primary maintainer. This coincided with the decommission

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  6 13:13:05 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.68
      Fixed a problem on OSX when macports openssl 1.x is installed: headers from
      macport were found but older OSX openssl libraries were linked, resulting
      in "Symbol not found: _EVP_MD_do_all_sorted".
      Added notes about runtime error "no OPENSSL_Applink", when calling
      Net::SSLeay::P_PKCS12_load_file.
 
 
 1.67 2015-01-17
      Improvements to inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm to handle the
      case whe there are muliple OPENSSLs installed. Patch from HBRAND
      Fixed a documentation error in get_peer_cert_chain, reported by tejas.
      Fixed a problem with building on Windows that prevented correct OpenSSL
      directory detection with version 1.0.1j as delivered with Shining Light OpenSSL.
      Fixed a problem with building on Windows that prevented finding MT or MD
      versions of SSL libraries.
      Updated doc in README.Win32 to build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express.
      Added Windows crypt32 library to Windows linking as some compilers/platforms seem to
      require it and it is innocuous otherwise. For Steve Hay.
      Fixed a failure in t/external/20_cert_chain.t where some platforms do not
      have HTTPS in /etc/services. Reported and patched by Gisle Aas.
      Recent 1.0.2 betas have dropped the SSLv3_method function. 
      This patch leaves out the function on newer versions, much the same as
      the SSLv2 deprecation is handled. Patch from Tom Molesworth.
      Fix the ALPN test, which was incorrectly failing on OpenSSL due to the
      LibreSSL check (earlier versions bailed out before that line).Patch from
      Tom Molesworth. 
 
 1.66 2014-08-21
      Fixed compile problem with perl prior to 5.8.8, similar to
      RT#76267. Reported by Graham Knop.
      Fixed a problem with Socket::IPPROTO_TCP on early perls.
      After discussions with the community and the original author Sampo
      Kellomaki, the license conditions have been changed to "Perl Artisitic
      License 2.0".
 
 
 1.65  2014-07-14
      Added note to doc to make it clear that X509_get_subjectAltNames returns a
      packed binary IP address for type 7 - GEN_IPADD.
      Improvements to SSL_OCSP_response_verify to compile under non c99
      compilers. Requested by MERIJNB.
      Port to Android, contributed by Brian Fraser. Includes Android specific
      version of RSA_generate_key.
      Added LibreSSL support, patch provided by Alexander Bluhm. Thanks!
      Patch that fixes the support for SSL_set_info_callback and adds
      SSL_CTX_set_info_callback and SSL_set_state. Support for these functions is
      necessary to either detect renegotiation or to enforce
      renegotiation. Contributed by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
      Fixed a problem with SSL_set_state not available on some early OpenSSLs,
      patched by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
      Removed arbitrary size limits from calls to tcp_read_all in tcpcat() and
      http_cat().
      Removed unnecessary Debian_SPANTS.txt from MANIFEST. Again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 12 14:38:14 UTC 2014 - meissner@suse.com

- updated to 1.64

  Fixes for test ocsp.t. Test now does not fail if HTTP::Tiny is not
  installed.
  Fixed repository in META.yml.
  Fixed a problem with SSL_get_peer_cert_chain: if the SSL handshake
  results in an anonymous authentication, like ADH-DES-CBC3-SHA,
  get_peer_cert_chain will not return an empty list, but instead return the
  SSL object. Reported and fixed by Steffen
  Ullrich. Thanks.
  Fixed a problem where patch
  https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=3009244da47b989c4cc59ba02cf81a4e9d8f8431
  caused a failed test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t.

- updated to 1.63
 1.63 2014-05-19
      Fixed error in version number in META.yml

 1.62 2014-05-19
      Improvements to OCSP support: It turns out that some CA (like Verisign)
      sign the OCSP response with the CA we have in the trust store and don't
      attach this certifcate in the response.  But OpenSSL by itself only
      considers the certificates included in the response and
      SSL_OCSP_response_verify added the certificates in the chain too.
      Now, we also add the trusted CA from the store which
      signed the lowest chain certificate, at least if we could not verify the
      OCSP response without doing it. Patch from Steffen
      Ullrich. Thanks.
      Fixed some compiler warnings.

 1.61 2014-05-12
      Changes calloc to Newx and free to Safefree, otherwise there might be
      problems because calloc is done from a different memory pool than free (depends
      on the build options for perl, but seen on Windows). Patch from Steffen
      Ullrich. Thanks.


 1.60 2014-05-10
      Fixed a typo in an error message. Patch from gregor herrmann. Thanks.
      Fixed a problem with building with openssl that does not support
      OCSP. Also fixed some newly introduced warnings
      if compiled with -Wall. Patch from Steffen Ullrich. Thanks.
      fix build-failure on most Debian architectures:
      SSLeay.xs: In function 'XS_Net__SSLeay_OCSP_response_results':
      SSLeay.xs:5602:3: error: format not a string literal and no format
      arguments. Patch from  gregor herrmann.


 1.59 2014-05-10
      Fixed local/30_error.t, so that tests do not fail if diagnostics are
      enabled.
      Fixed error messages about undefined strings used with length or
      split. Reported and patched by Peter Heuchert.
      Improvements to configuration of OPTIMIZE flags, to prevent overriding
      of perls expected optimization flags. Caution: HPUX aCC optimize options are special.
      SSL_peek() now returns openssl error code as second item when called in
      array context, same as SSL_read. Patch from Andreas Mohr.
      Fixed some warnings.
      Added support for tlsv1.1 tlsv1.2 via $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version. Patch
      from Andreas Mohr.
      Improve examples in 'Using other perl modules based on
      Net::SSLeay'. Patched by Andreas Mohr.
      Added support for OCSP. Patched by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
      Added missing t/external/ocsp.t

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  9 13:34:34 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.58
      Always use size_t for strlen() return value, requested by Alexander Bluhm.
      t/external/20_cert_chain.t was missing from dist.
      Version number in META.yml was incorrect
      Improvements to test t/external/20_cert_chain.t to provoke following bug:
      Fixed crash due to SSL_get_peer_cert_chain incorrectly free'ing the chain
      after use.
      Fixed a problem when compiling against openssl where OPENSSL_NO_EC is set.

 1.57 2014-01-09
      Fixed remaining problems with test suite: pod coverage and kwalitee tests
      are only enabled with RELEASE_TESTING=1

 1.56 2014-01-08
      Fixed a typo in documentation of BEAST Attack, patched by gregor
      herrmann.
      Added LICENSE file copied form OpenSSL distribution to prevent complaints
      from various versions of kwalitee.
      Adjusted license: in META.yml to be 'openssl'
      Adds support for the basic operations necessary to support ECDH for PFS,
      e.g. EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name, EC_KEY_free and SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh.
      Improvements to t/handle/external/50_external.t to handle the case when a
      test connection was not possible. Patched by Alexandr Ciornii.
      Added support for ALPN TLS extension. Patch from Lubomir Rintel. Tested
      with openssl-1.0.2-stable-SNAP-20131205.
      Fix an use-after-free error. Patch from Lubomir Rintel.
      Fixed a problem with  Invalid comparison on OBJ_cmp result in
      t/local/36_verify.t. Contributed by paul.
      Added support for get_peer_cert_chain(). Patch by Markus Benning.
      Fixed a bug that could cause stack faults: mixed up PUTBACK with SPAGAIN in ssleay_RSA_generate_key_cb_invoke()
      a final PUTBACK is needed here. A second issue is also fixed:
      cb->data defaults to &PL_sv_undef but throught the code you do not check
      against &PL_sv_undef, just NULL.
      To avoid passing the 3rd optional arg at all, do not create it. This fixes all the
      cb->data checks and wrong refcounts on &PL_sv_undef. Patched by Reini Urban.
      Deleted support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname: it is not included in
      OpenSSL git master.

- new version 1.55
  * Added support for TLSV1_1 and TLSV1_2 methods with
    SSL_CTX_tlsv1_1_new(), SSL_CTX_tlsv1_2_new(), TLSv1_1_method() and
    TLSv1_2_method(), where available in the underlying openssl.
  * Added CRL support functions X509_CRL_get_ext(),
    X509_CRL_get_ext_by_NID(), X509_CRL_get_ext_count(). Patch from
    Franck Youssef.
  * Added support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname() required for DANE
    support in openssl*1.0.2 and later. SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname()
    was added to OpenSSL with the financial assistance of .SE.
  * Added X509_NAME_new and X509_NAME_hash, patched by Franck Youssef.
  * Added support for SSL_export_keying_material where present
  * Net::SSLeay::ASN1_INTEGER_get, since it works differntly on 32 and
    64 bit platforms. Updated author and distribution location details
    to airspayce.com
  * Fixed a few compiler warnings in SSLeay.xs.  Most of them are just
    signed/unsigned pointer mismatches but there is one that actually
    fixes returning what would be an arbitrary value off the stack
    from get_my_thread_id if it happened to be called in a
    non*threaded build.
  * Added SSL_set_tlsext_host_name, SSL_get_servername,
    SSL_get_servername_type, SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback
    for server side Server Name Indication (SNI) support. Patched by
    kmx.
  * Improvements to Net::SSLeay::read to make it easier to use with
    non*blocking IO Added documentation about how to mitigatxe various
    SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.
  * initializes the SSL library at most once.
  * Patch from kmx to protect SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms from multiple
    loads and reentrancy in multi*threaded perls.
