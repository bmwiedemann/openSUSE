  <description>This is a client for the OpenStack Keystone API. There's a Python API (the keystoneclient module), and a command-line script (keystone). The Keystone 2.0 API is still a moving target, so this module will remain in &quot;Beta&quot; status until the API is finalized and fully implemented.</description>
