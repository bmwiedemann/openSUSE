                Optional PARI/GP packages

                This page lists all optional PARI/GP packages made available by
                the PARI group. These packages use up a nonnegligible amount of
                disk space and will be useless for most users, hence they are
                distributed separately and maintained independently. They are
                rarely upgraded so most of them will only be downloaded once.
                All packages are © the PARI group, distributed under the terms
                of the GNU General Public License (GPL version 2 or any later
                version).

                Installation

                A. To use a package with the daily Windows GP binary

                Extract the archive in same folder as gp.exe (this will create
                a 'data' subfolder).

                B. To install a package from a source distribution.

                Extract the archive in the toplevel pari directory before
                running ./Configure. Then run make install as usual. To test
                the distribution before installing, you can follow the
                following three-step procedure

                 1. make install-data, which will only install the packages
                    extracted in the toplevel pari directory as above, and
                    nothing else.
                 2. make test-all will fully test the distribution, including
                    the newly installed packages.
                 3. make install to fully install the new distribution.

                Of course, if the needed packages are already installed on this
                particular machine, you can omit the first step. If some
                packages are in fact missing, the second step will output
                warnings of the form

                    Needed by ellap for large primes.
                    Require PARI/GP 2.4.3 and up. These polynomials were
                    extracted from the ECHIDNA databases and computed by David
                    R. Kohel. This covers finite fields of cardinality q up to
                    750 bits. PARI/GP 2.9 contains fallback code to go on when
                    all modular polynomials in the database have been exhausted
                    and can handle larger fields (with an important slowdown).
                    Other versions:
                      □ seadata-small.tgz (655 KB), Jun 18 2009

                        The second one is a much smaller version that should be
                        suitable for fields up to 350 bits.
                      □ seadata-big.tar (98.7 MB), Apr 18 2017

                        signature: seadata-big.tar.asc
                        The third one is huge and contains extra modular
                        polynomials of level between 500 and 800. This is
                        suitable for fields up to 1100 bits.

                    Repackaging of the historical megrez number field tables
                    (errors fixed, 1/10th the size, easier to use). This
                    package requires no installation: extract it where desired
                    and look at the [README]. Individual tables from the
                    package are available separately.
                    Require PARI/GP 2.2.11 and up (need readvec).
                  • galdata.tgz (52 KB), Apr 11 2008

                    Needed by polgalois to compute Galois group in degrees 8
                    through 11.
                    Require PARI/GP 2.2.7 and up.

                    md5sum: 227029dc39aea52bbf7909fb47583798
                    Needed by nflist to list fields of small discriminant
                    (currently needed by the single Galois groups A5 and A5(6))
                    or to list regular extensions of Q(T) in degree 7 to 15.
                    Require PARI/GP 2.14.0.
