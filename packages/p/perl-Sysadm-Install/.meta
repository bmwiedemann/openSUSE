  <title>Typical installation tasks for system administrators</title>
  <description>Have you ever wished for your installation shell scripts to run
reproducably, without much programming fuzz, and even with optional logging
enabled? Then give up shell programming, use Perl.

'Sysadm::Install' executes shell-like commands performing typical
installation tasks: Copying files, extracting tarballs, calling 'make'. It
has a 'fail once and die' policy, meticulously checking the result of every
operation and calling 'die()' immeditatly if anything fails.

'Sysadm::Install' also supports a _dry_run_ mode, in which it logs
everything, but suppresses any write actions. Dry run mode is enabled by
calling 'Sysadm::Install::dry_run(1)'. To switch back to normal, call
'Sysadm::Install::dry_run(0)'.

As of version 0.17, 'Sysadm::Install' supports a _confirm_ mode, in which
it interactively asks the user before running any of its functions (just
like 'rm -i'). _confirm_ mode is enabled by calling
'Sysadm::Install::confirm(1)'. To switch back to normal, call
'Sysadm::Install::confirm(0)'.

'Sysadm::Install' is fully Log4perl-enabled. To start logging, just
initialize 'Log::Log4perl'. 'Sysadm::Install' acts as a wrapper class,
meaning that file names and line numbers are reported from the calling
program's point of view.</description>
