  <description>The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful collection
of Perl code. It has several indices of the files that it hosts, including
a file named &quot;02packages.details.txt.gz&quot; in the &quot;modules&quot; directory. This
file contains lots of useful information and this module provides a simple
interface to the data contained within.

In a future release the Parse::CPAN::Packages::Package manpage and the
Parse::CPAN::Packages::Distribution manpage might have more information.</description>
