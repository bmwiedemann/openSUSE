  <title>HTML parser class</title>
  <description>Objects of the HTML::Parser class will recognize markup and separate it
from plain text (alias data content) in HTML documents. As different
kinds of markup and text are recognized, the corresponding event handlers
are invoked.

HTML::Parser is not a generic SGML parser. We have tried to make it able to
deal with the HTML that is actually &quot;out there&quot;, and it normally parses as
closely as possible to the way the popular web browsers do it instead of
strictly following one of the many HTML specifications from W3C. Where
there is disagreement, there is often an option that you can enable to
get the official behaviour.

The document to be parsed may be supplied in arbitrary chunks. This makes
on-the-fly parsing as documents are received from the network possible.

If event driven parsing does not feel right for your application, you might
want to use HTML::PullParser. This is an HTML::Parser subclass that allows
a more conventional program structure.</description>
