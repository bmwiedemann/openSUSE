  <title>Perl Module to interpolate Script Options from Files into @ARGV</title>
  <description>This module simply interpolates option file hints in @ARGV by the contents of
the pointed files. This enables option reading from files instead of or
additional to the usual reading from the command line.

Alternatively, you can process any array instead of @ARGV which is used by
default and mentioned mostly in this manual.

The interpolated @ARGV could be subsequently processed by the usual option
handling, e.g. by a Getopt::xxx module. Getopt::ArgvFile does not perform any
option handling itself, it only prepares the array @ARGV.
