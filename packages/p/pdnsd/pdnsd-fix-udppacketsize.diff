Subject: fix invalid UDP packet in case of truncation

The UDP response packet pdnsd sends is invalid in case of a truncated packet:
The header fields ANCOUNT and NSCOUNT stil contains the "intended" number of
records, but the payload is actually truncated to udpmaxrespsize.
This might have worked if only additionals would overflow the packet size,
but fails definitely when regular records already exceed it.
Fix by always checking for space in the packet before actually adding any
record, be it regular or additional.
