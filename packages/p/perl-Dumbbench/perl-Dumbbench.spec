%description
This module attempts to implement reasonably robust benchmarking with
little extra effort and expertise required from the user. That is to say,
benchmarking using this module is likely an improvement over

  time some-command --to --benchmark

or

  use Benchmark qw/timethis/;
  timethis(1000, 'system("some-command", ...)');

The module currently works similar to the former command line, except (in
layman terms) it will run the command many times, estimate the uncertainty
of the result and keep iterating until a certain user-defined precision has
been reached. Then, it calculates the resulting uncertainty and goes
through some pain to discard bad runs and subtract overhead from the
timings. The reported timing includes an uncertainty, so that multiple
benchmarks can more easily be compared.

Please note that 'Dumbbench' works entirely with wallclock time as reported
by 'Time::HiRes'' 'time()' function.
