  <title>A Moose role for processing command line options</title>
  <description>This is a role which provides an alternate constructor for creating objects
using parameters passed in from the command line.

This module attempts to DWIM as much as possible with the command line
params by introspecting your class's attributes. It will use the name of
your attribute as the command line option, and if there is a type
constraint defined, it will configure Getopt::Long to handle the option
accordingly.

You can use the trait the MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::Trait manpage or
the attribute metaclass the MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute manpage to get
non-default commandline option names and aliases.

You can use the trait the MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::Trait::NoGetopt
manpage or the attribute metaclass the
MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::NoGetopt manpage to have 'MooseX::Getopt'
ignore your attribute in the commandline options.

By default, attributes which start with an underscore are not given
commandline argument support, unless the attribute's metaclass is set to
the MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute manpage. If you don't want your
accessors to have the leading underscore in their name, you can do this:

  # for read/write attributes
  has '_foo' =&gt; (accessor =&gt; 'foo', ...);

  # or for read-only attributes
  has '_bar' =&gt; (reader =&gt; 'bar', ...);

This will mean that Getopt will not handle a --foo param, but your code can
still call the 'foo' method.

If your class also uses a configfile-loading role based on the
MooseX::ConfigFromFile manpage, such as the MooseX::SimpleConfig manpage,
the MooseX::Getopt manpage's 'new_with_options' will load the configfile
specified by the '--configfile' option (or the default you've given for the
configfile attribute) for you.

Options specified in multiple places follow the following precendence
order: commandline overrides configfile, which overrides explicit
new_with_options parameters.</description>
