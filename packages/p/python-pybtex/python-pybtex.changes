- Update to version 0.21:
  * BibTeX writer now uses latexcodec to encode characters that are
    not directly supported by the output encoding. Thanks, Hong Xu!
  * HTML backend: {braced stings} are now wrapped with
    <span class="bibtex-protected"> to enable custom CSS styling.
  * unsrt.py: DOI, PubMed and Arxiv links now use HTTPS instead of
    HTTP.
  * unsrt.py: URLs with percent characters are now formatted
    correctly.
  * unsrt.py: short page / volume / chapter numbers are now joined
    with a non-breaking space, like in BibTeX.
  * unsrt.py: inbook now uses the editor field if the author field
    is missing, like in BibTeX.
  * unsrt.py: the words “volume” and “pages” in the beginning of
    the sentence are now capitalized, like in BibTeX.
  * unsrt.py: removed unnecessary period between the book title and
    the comma in inbook.
  * LaTeX backend: fix encoding tilde ("~") characters with newer
    versions of latexcodec.
  * Fix splitting names with escaped space ("\ ") characters.
- Convert to singlespec

Tue Aug 26 07:06:45 UTC 2014 - gber@opensuse.org

- update to version 0.18
  - Pybtex is now fully case-insensitive (like BibTeX). As a
    consequence, IEEEtran styles now work corretly.
  - Added ``--preserve-case`` optoin to ``pybtex-convert`` (by
    default all identifiers are converted to lower case).
  - An erorr is reported if two citations have the same key but
    different case, like in BibTeX. (Example: ddt1999 and DDT1999).
  - Fixed parsing unused bibliography entries with strings
    containing @ characters.
  - ``entry.max$`` constant is now set to 250, ``global.max$`` is
    set to 20000, like in BibTeX.
  - Added ``--strict`` option to ``pybtex-convert`` and
    ``pybtex-format`` (turns warning to errors).
  - Strict mode is now enabled by default when using pybtex as a
    library (exceptions are raised on all errors instead of just
    printing warnings to stderr).
    Non-strict error handling is still enabled when using pybtex
    from the command line, for compatibility with BibTeX. Use
    ``--strict`` option if you don't like this.
  - Added missing pybtex-format manpage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 26 15:17:17 UTC 2014 - gber@opensuse.org

- update to version 0.17
  - Added pybtex-format utility for formatting bibliography files
    as HTML, LaTeX, and other supported human-readable formats.
  - Added --strict command line option (all warnings become
    errors).
  - Added alpha label style, and alpha and unsrtalpha formatting
    styles.
  - Added support for url, eprint, doi, and pubmed fields in unsrt
    style.
  - Names with hyphens are now abbreviated correctly
    ("Jean-Baptiste" becomes "J.-B.").
  - width$ now uses cmr10 font metrics, like in BibTeX. Non-latin
    characters are also supported.
  - Pythonic style engine now supports @preamble commands.
  - Warning on missing fields are now more human-readable.
  - When writing BibTeX files, put entry key on the same line with
    entry type. Fixes warnings in Jabref.
  - When using multiple .bib files, macros defined in earlier files
    are available in subsequent ones (like in BibTeX).
  - Fixed parsing .bst files with lines consisting of a single %
    character.
  - Fixed sorting entries without author in author_year_title
    sorting style.
  - Fixed broken CaseInsensitiveDict.get().
  - CaseInsensitiveDict is now pickleable.
  - Added support for registering plugins at runtime with
    pybtex.plugin.register_plugin() - useful for using pybtex as a
    library.
