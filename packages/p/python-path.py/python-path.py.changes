- Update to version 10.3.1
  * #124: Fixed ``rmdir_p`` raising ``FileNotFoundError`` when
    directory does not exist on Windows.
  10.3:
  * #115: Added a new performance-optimized implementation
    for listdir operations, optimizing ``listdir``, ``walk``,
    ``walkfiles``, ``walkdirs``, and ``fnmatch``, presented
    as the ``FastPath`` class.
    Please direct feedback on this implementation to the ticket,
    especially if the performance benefits justify it replacing
    the default ``Path`` class.
  10.2:
  * Symlink no longer requires the ``newlink`` parameter
    and will default to the basename of the target in the
    current working directory.
  10.1:
  * #123: Implement ``Path.__fspath__`` per PEP 519.
  10.0:
  * Once again as in 8.0 remove deprecated ``path.path``.
  9.1:
  * #121: Removed workaround for #61 added in 5.2. ``path.py``
    now only supports file system paths that can be effectively
    decoded to text. It is the responsibility of the system
    implementer to ensure that filenames on the system are
    decodeable by ``sys.getfilesystemencoding()``.
  9.0:
  * Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2 as integration
    dependencies (pip) no longer support these versions.
  8.3:
  * Merge with latest skeleton, adding badges and test runs by
    default under tox instead of pytest-runner.
  * Documentation is no longer hosted with PyPI.
  8.2.1:
  * #112: Update Travis CI usage to only deploy on Python 3.5.
  8.2:
  * Refreshed project metadata based on `jaraco's project
    skeleton <https://github.com/jaraco/skeleton/tree/spaces>_.
  * Releases are now automatically published via Travis-CI.
  * #111: More aggressively trap errors when importing
    ``pkg_resources``.
  8.1.2:
  * #105: By using unicode literals, avoid errors rendering the
    backslash in __get_owner_windows.

- Converted to single-spec

- Update to version 10.3.1 (see CHANGES.rst)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 15:02:34 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.1.1
  * Restored path.path with a DeprecationWarning.
  * Removed path.path. Clients must now refer to the canonical 
    name, path.Path as introduced in 6.2.
  * Added support for resolving certain directories on a system to 
    platform-friendly locations using the appdirs library.
  * In order to support "multipath" results, where multiple paths 
    are returned in a single, os.pathsep-separated string, a new
    class MultiPath now represents those special results. This
    functionality is experimental and may change. Feedback is
    invited.

- Update to version 7.6
  - Pull Request #100: Add ``merge_tree`` method for merging
    two existing directory trees.
  - Uses `setuptools_scm <https://github.org/pypa/setuptools_scm>`_
    for version management.
- Update to version 7.5
  - #97: ``__rdiv__`` and ``__rtruediv__`` are now defined.
- Update to version 7.4
  - #93: chown now appears in docs and raises NotImplementedError if
    ``os.chown`` isn't present.
  - #92: Added compatibility support for ``.samefile`` on platforms without
    ``os.samefile``.
- Update to version 7.3
  - #91: Releases now include a universal wheel.
- Update to version 7.2
  - In chmod, added support for multiple symbolic masks (separated by commas).
  - In chmod, fixed issue in setting of symbolic mask with '=' where
    unreferenced permissions were cleared.
- Update to version 7.1
  - #23: Added support for symbolic masks to ``.chmod``.
- Update to version 7.0
  - The ``open`` method now uses ``io.open`` and supports all of the
    parameters to that function. ``open`` will always raise an ``OSError``
    on failure, even on Python 2.
  - Updated ``write_text`` to support additional newline patterns.
  - The ``text`` method now always returns text (never bytes), and thus
    requires an encoding parameter be supplied if the default encoding is not
    sufficient to decode the content of the file.
- Update to version 6.2
  - ``path`` class renamed to ``Path``. The ``path`` name remains as an alias
   for compatibility.
- Update to version 6.1
  - ``chown`` now accepts names in addition to numeric IDs.
- Update to version 6.0
  - Drop support for Python 2.5. Python 2.6 or later required.
  - Installation now requires setuptools.
- Update to version 5.3
  - Allow arbitrary callables to be passed to path.walk ``errors`` parameter.
    Enables workaround for issues such as #73 and #56.
- Update to version 5.2
  - #61: path.listdir now decodes filenames from os.listdir when loading
    characters from a file. On Python 3, the behavior is unchanged. On Python
    2, the behavior will now mimick that of Python 3, attempting to decode
    all filenames and paths using the encoding indicated by
    ``sys.getfilesystemencoding()``, and escaping any undecodable characters
    using the 'surrogateescape' handler.
- Update to version 5.1
  - #53: Added ``path.in_place`` for editing files in place.
- Update to version 5.0
  - ``path.fnmatch`` now takes an optional parameter ``normcase`` and this
    parameter defaults to self.module.normcase (using case normalization most
    pertinent to the path object itself). Note that this change means that
    any paths using a custom ntpath module on non-Windows systems will have
    different fnmatch behavior.
  - Issue #50: Methods that accept patterns (``listdir``, ``files``, ``dirs``,
    ``walk``, ``walkdirs``, ``walkfiles``, and ``fnmatch``) will now use a
    ``normcase`` attribute if it is present on the ``pattern`` parameter. The
    path module now provides a ``CaseInsensitivePattern`` wrapper for strings
    suitable for creating case-insensitive patterns for those methods.
- Update to version 4.4
  - Issue #44: _hash method would open files in text mode, producing
    invalid results on Windows. Now files are opened in binary mode, producing
    consistent results.
  - Issue #47: Documentation is dramatically improved with Intersphinx links
    to the Python os.path functions and documentation for all methods and
    properties.
- Update to version 4.3
  - Issue #32: Add ``chdir`` and ``cd`` methods.
- Update to version 4.2
  - ``open()`` now passes all positional and keyword arguments through to the
    underlying ``builtins.open`` call.
- Update to version 4.1
  - Native Python 2 and Python 3 support without using 2to3 during the build
    process.
- Update to version 4.0
  - Added a ``chunks()`` method to a allow quick iteration over pieces of a
    file at a given path.
  - Issue #28: Fix missing argument to ``samefile``.
  - Initializer no longer enforces `isinstance basestring` for the source
    object. Now any object that supplies ``__unicode__`` can be used by a
    ``path`` (except None). Clients that depend on a ValueError being raised
    for ``int`` and other non-string objects should trap these types
    internally.
  - Issue #30: ``chown`` no longer requires both uid and gid to be provided
    and will not mutate the ownership if nothing is provided.
- Update to version 3.2
  - Issue #22: ``__enter__`` now returns self.
- Update to version 3.1
  - Issue #20: `relpath` now supports a "start" parameter to match the
    signature of `os.path.relpath`.
- Update to version 3.0
  - Minimum Python version is now 2.5.
- Update to version 2.6
  - Issue #5: Implemented `path.tempdir`, which returns a path object which is
    a temporary directory and context manager for cleaning up the directory.
  - Issue #12: One can now construct path objects from a list of strings by
    simply using path.joinpath.
- Update to version 2.5
  - Issue #7: Add the ability to do chaining of operations that formerly only
    returned None.
  - Issue #4: Raise a TypeError when constructed from None.
- Update to version 2.4
  - No upstream changelog
