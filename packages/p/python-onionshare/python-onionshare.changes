  * Major feature: a new 'Quickstart' screen, which enables toggling on or
    off an animated automatic connection to Tor. This allows configuring

    upstream Tor API to try to automatically obtain bridges depending on the
    user's location.

    Tor API rather than hardcode them in each release of OnionShare.
  * New feature: keyboard shortcuts to access various modes and menus, and
    accessibility hints

    broken on Windows
  * Packaging: Packaging is more automated, and Linux Snapcraft releases are
    available for amd64, arm64, and armhf
