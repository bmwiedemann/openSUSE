  <description>line_profiler will profile the time individual lines of code take to execute.
The profiler is implemented in C via Cython in order to reduce the overhead of
profiling.
 
Also included is the script kernprof.py which can be used to conveniently
profile Python applications and scripts either with line_profiler or with the
function-level profiling tools in the Python standard library.</description>
