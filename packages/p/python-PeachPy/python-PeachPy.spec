Portable Efficient Assembly Code-generator in Higher-level Python (PEACH-Py)
PEACH-Py is a Python framework for writing high-performance assembly kernels.
PEACH-Py is developed to simplify writing optimized assembly kernels while
preserving all optimization opportunities of traditional assembly. Some
PEACH-Py features:
  - Automatic register allocation
  - Stack frame management, including re-aligning of stack frame as needed
  - Generating versions of a function for different calling conventions from
    the same source (e.g. functions for Microsoft x64 ABI and System V x86-64
    ABI can be generated from the same source)
  - Allows to define constants in the place where they are used (just like in
    high-level languages)
  - Tracking of instruction extensions used in the function.
  - Multiplexing of multiple instruction streams (helpful for software
    pipelining)
