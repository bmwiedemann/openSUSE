  <title>Geometric-style sans serif</title>
  <description>From http://andrewpaglinawan.com/category/typefaces/#quicksand:
Quicksand is a sans serif type family of three weights plus matching obliques and a dash version for display and headings. Influenced by the geometric-style sans serif faces that were popular during the 1920s and 30s, the fonts are based on geometric forms that have been optically corrected for better legibility.

Designers: Andrew Paglinawan
