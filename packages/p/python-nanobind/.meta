  <title>Tiny and Efficient C++/Python Bindings</title>
  <description>nanobind is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa.  It is reminiscent of Boost.Python and pybind11 and uses near-identical syntax.  In contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is more efficient: bindings compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and have better runtime performance.</description>
