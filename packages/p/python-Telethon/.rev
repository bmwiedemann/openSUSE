    <time>1603283959</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.17.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    + Message.from_id is now a :tl:`Peer`, not int! If you want the marked sender ID (much like old behaviour), replace all uses of .from_id with .sender_id. This will mostly work, but of course in old and new versions you have to account for the fact that this sender may no longer be a user.
    + You can no longer assign to Message.reply_to_msg_id &lt;telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.reply_to_msg_id&gt; and Message.to_id &lt;telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.to_id&gt; because these are now properties that offer a &quot;view&quot; to the real value from a different field.
    + Answering inline queries with a photo or document will now send the photo or document used in the resulting message by default. Not sending the media was technically a bug, but some people may be relying on this old behaviour. You can use the old behaviour with include_media=False.
  * Additions
    + New raise_last_call_error parameter in the client constructor to raise the same error produced by the last failing call, rather than a generic ValueError.
    + New formatting_entities parameter in client.send_message() &lt;telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message&gt;, and client.send_file() &lt;telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file&gt; to bypass the parse mode and manually specify the formatting entities.
    + New client.get_permissions() &lt;telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.get_permissions&gt; method to query a participant's permissions in a group or channel. This request is slightly expensive in small group chats because it has to fetch the entire chat to check just a user, so use of a cache is advised.
    + Message.click() &lt;telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.click&gt; now works on normal polls!
    + New local_addr parameter in the client constructor to use a specific local network address when connecting to Telegram.
    + client.inline_query() &lt;telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query&gt; now lets you specify the chat where the query is being made from, which some bots need to provide certain functionality.
    + You can now get comments in a channel post with the reply_to parameter in client.iter_messages() &lt;telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages&gt;. Comments are messages that &quot;reply to&quot; a specific channel message, hence the name (which is consistent with how Telegram's API calls it).
  * Enhancements
    + Updated documentation and list of known errors.
    + If hachoir is available, the file metadata can now be extracted from streams and in-memory bytes.
    + The default parameters used to initialize a connection now match the format of those used by Telegram Desktop.
    + Specifying 0 retries will no longer cause the library to attempt to reconnect.
    + The library should now be able to reliably download very large files.
    + Global search should work more reliably now.
    + Old usernames are evicted from cache, so getting entities by cached username should now be more reliable.
    + Slightly less noisy logs.
    + Stability regarding transport-level errors (transport flood, authorization key not found) should be improved. In particular, you should no longer be getting unnecessarily logged out.
    + Reconnection should no longer occur if the client gets logged out (for example, another client revokes the session).
    + Bug fixes
    + In some cases, there were issues when using events.Album &lt;telethon.events.album.Album&gt; together with events.Raw &lt;telethon.events.raw.Raw&gt;.
    + For some channels, one of their channel photos would not show up in client.iter_profile_photos() &lt;telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_profile_photos&gt;.
    + In some cases, a request that failed to be sent would be forgotten, causing the original caller to be &quot;locked&quot; forever for a response that would never arrive. Failing requests should now consistently be automatically re-sent.
    + The library should more reliably handle certain updates with &quot;empty&quot; data.
    + Sending documents in inline queries should now work fine.
    + Manually using client.sign_up &lt;telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.sign_up&gt; should now work correctly, instead of claiming &quot;code invalid&quot;.
    + Special mention to some of the other changes in the 1.16.x series:
    + The thumb for download_media now supports both str and :tl:`VideoSize`.
    + Thumbnails are sorted, so -1 is always the largest.</comment>

    <version>1.21.1</version>
    <time>1623705082</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.21.1:
  - New schema and QoL improvements (v1.21)
  - Scheme layer used: 125
  - View new and changed raw API methods.
  - Not many changes in this release, mostly the layer
    change. Lately quite a few people have been reporting
    TypeNotFoundError, which occurs when the server sends types
    that it shouldn’t. This can happen when Telegram decides
    to add a new, incomplete layer, and then they change the
    layer without bumping the layer number (so some constructor
    IDs no longer match and the error occurs). This layer
    change should fix it.
  - Additions
      - Message.click() now supports a password parameter,
        needed when doing things like changing the owner of a
        bot via @BotFather.
  - Enhancements
      - tgcrypto will now be used for encryption when
        installed.
  - Bug fixes
      - Message.edit wasn’t working in your own chat on
        events other than NewMessage.
      - client.delete_dialog() was not working on chats.
      - events.UserUpdate should now handle channels’ typing
        status.
      - InputNotifyPeer auto-cast should now work on other
        TLObject.
      - For some objects, False was not correctly serialized.
  - New schema and QoL improvements (v1.20)
  - Scheme layer used: 124
  - View new and changed raw API methods.
  - A bit late to the party, but Telethon now offers a
    convenient way to comment on channel posts. It works very
    similar to reply_to:
    client.send_message(channel, 'Great update!', comment_to=1134)
  - This code will leave a comment to the channel post with ID
    1134 in channel.
  - In addition, the library now logs warning or error
    messages to stderr by default! You no longer should be
    left wondering “why isn’t my event handler working”
    if you forgot to configure logging. It took so long for
    this change to arrive because nobody noticed that Telethon
    was using a logging.NullHandler when it really shouldn’t
    have.
  - If you want the old behaviour of no messages being logged,
    you can configure logging to CRITICAL severity:
        
        import logging
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL)
    This is not considered a breaking change because stderr
    should only be used for logging purposes, not to emit
    information others may consume (use stdout for that).
  - Additions
      - New comment_to parameter in client.send_message(), and
        client.send_file() to comment on channel posts.
  - Enhancements
      - utils.resolve_invite_link handles the newer link
        format.
      - Downloading files now retries once on TimeoutError,
        which has been happening recently. It is not guaranteed
        to work, but it should help.
      - Sending albums of photo URLs is now supported.
      - EXIF metadata is respected when automatically resizing
        photos, so the orientation information should no longer
        be lost.
      - Downloading a thumbnail by index should now use the
        correct size ordering.
  - Bug fixes
      - Fixed a KeyError on certain cases with Conversation.
      - Thumbnails should properly render on more
        clients. Installing hachoir may help.
      - Message search was broken when using a certain
        combination of parameters.
      - utils.resolve_id was misbehaving with some identifiers.
      - Fix TypeNotFoundError was not being propagated, causing
        deadlocks.
      - Invoking multiple requests at once with ordered=True
        was deadlocking.
  - New raw API call methods (v1.19)
  - Scheme layer used: 122
  - Telegram has had group calls for some weeks now. This new
    version contains the raw API methods needed to initiate and
    manage these group calls, however, the library will likely
    not offer ways to stream audio directly.
  - Telethon’s focus is being an asyncio-based, pure-Python
    implementation to interact with Telegram’s API. Streaming
    audio is beyond the current scope of the project and would
    be a big undertaking.
  - However, that doesn’t mean calls are not possible with
    Telethon. If you want to help design a Python library to
    perform audio calls, which can then be used with Telethon
    (so you can use Telethon + that new library to perform
    calls with Telethon), please refer to @pytgcallschat
    and join the relevant chat to discuss and help with the
    implementation!
  - The above message was also posted in the official Telegram
    group, if you wish to discuss it further.
  - With that out of the way, let’s list the additions and
    bug fixes in this release:
  - Additions
      - New has_left property for user permissions on
        client.get_permissions().
  - Enhancements
      - Updated documentation and list of known RPC errors.
      - The library now treats a lack of ping responses as a
        network error.
      - client.kick_participant() now returns the service
        message about the user being kicked, so you can delete
        it.
  - Bug fixes
      - When editing inline messages, the text parameter is
        preferred if provided.
      - Additional senders are unconditionally disconnected
        when disconnecting the main client, which should reduce
        the amount of asyncio warnings.
      - Automatic reconnection with no retries was failing.
      - PhotoPathSize is now ignored when determining a
        download size, since this “size” is not a JPEG
        thumbnail unlike the rest.
      - events.ChatAction should misbehave less.
  - New layer and QoL improvements (v1.18)
  - Scheme layer used: 120
  - Mostly fixes, and added some new things that can be done in
    this new layer.
  - For proxy users, a pull request was merged that will
    use the python-socks library when available for proxy
    support. This library natively supports asyncio, so it
    should work better than the old pysocks. pysocks will still
    be used if the new library is not available, and both will
    be handled transparently by Telethon so you don’t need to
    worry about it.
  - Additions
      - New client.set_proxy() method which lets you change
        the proxy without recreating the client. You will need
        to reconnect for it to take effect, but you won’t
        need to recreate the client. This is also an external
        contribution.
      - New method to unpin messages client.unpin_message().
  - Enhancements
      - Empty peers are excluded from the list of dialogs.
      - If the python-socks library is installed (new optional
        requirement), it will be used instead of pysocks for
        proxy support. This should fix some issues with proxy
        timeouts, because the new library natively supports
        asyncio.
      - client.send_file() will now group any media
        type, instead of sending non-image documents
        separatedly. This lets you create music albums, for
        example.
      - You can now search messages with a from_user that’s
        not a user. This is a Telegram feature, we know the
        name isn’t great, but backwards-compatibility has to
        be kept.
  - Bug fixes
      - Fixes related to conversation timeouts.
      - Large dates (over year 2038) now wrap around a 32-bit
        integer, which is the only way we can represent them
        to Telegram. Even if “wrong”, it makes things not
        crash, and it’s the best we can do with 32-bit dates.
      - The library was accidentally using a deprecated
        argument in one of its friendly methods, producing a
        warning.
      - Improvements to the way marked IDs are parsed.
      - SlowModeWaitError floods are no longer cached.
      - Getting the buttons for a message could fail sometimes.
      - Getting the display name for “forbidden” chats now works.
      - Better handling of errors in some internal methods.
