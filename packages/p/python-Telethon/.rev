    <comment>- Update to 1.17.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    + Message.from_id is now a :tl:`Peer`, not int! If you want the marked sender ID (much like old behaviour), replace all uses of .from_id with .sender_id. This will mostly work, but of course in old and new versions you have to account for the fact that this sender may no longer be a user.
    + You can no longer assign to Message.reply_to_msg_id &lt;telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.reply_to_msg_id&gt; and Message.to_id &lt;telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.to_id&gt; because these are now properties that offer a &quot;view&quot; to the real value from a different field.
    + Answering inline queries with a photo or document will now send the photo or document used in the resulting message by default. Not sending the media was technically a bug, but some people may be relying on this old behaviour. You can use the old behaviour with include_media=False.
  * Additions
    + New raise_last_call_error parameter in the client constructor to raise the same error produced by the last failing call, rather than a generic ValueError.
    + New formatting_entities parameter in client.send_message() &lt;telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message&gt;, and client.send_file() &lt;telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file&gt; to bypass the parse mode and manually specify the formatting entities.
    + New client.get_permissions() &lt;telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.get_permissions&gt; method to query a participant's permissions in a group or channel. This request is slightly expensive in small group chats because it has to fetch the entire chat to check just a user, so use of a cache is advised.
    + Message.click() &lt;telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.click&gt; now works on normal polls!
    + New local_addr parameter in the client constructor to use a specific local network address when connecting to Telegram.
    + client.inline_query() &lt;telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query&gt; now lets you specify the chat where the query is being made from, which some bots need to provide certain functionality.
    + You can now get comments in a channel post with the reply_to parameter in client.iter_messages() &lt;telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages&gt;. Comments are messages that &quot;reply to&quot; a specific channel message, hence the name (which is consistent with how Telegram's API calls it).
  * Enhancements
    + Updated documentation and list of known errors.
    + If hachoir is available, the file metadata can now be extracted from streams and in-memory bytes.
    + The default parameters used to initialize a connection now match the format of those used by Telegram Desktop.
    + Specifying 0 retries will no longer cause the library to attempt to reconnect.
    + The library should now be able to reliably download very large files.
    + Global search should work more reliably now.
    + Old usernames are evicted from cache, so getting entities by cached username should now be more reliable.
    + Slightly less noisy logs.
    + Stability regarding transport-level errors (transport flood, authorization key not found) should be improved. In particular, you should no longer be getting unnecessarily logged out.
    + Reconnection should no longer occur if the client gets logged out (for example, another client revokes the session).
    + Bug fixes
    + In some cases, there were issues when using events.Album &lt;telethon.events.album.Album&gt; together with events.Raw &lt;telethon.events.raw.Raw&gt;.
    + For some channels, one of their channel photos would not show up in client.iter_profile_photos() &lt;telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_profile_photos&gt;.
    + In some cases, a request that failed to be sent would be forgotten, causing the original caller to be &quot;locked&quot; forever for a response that would never arrive. Failing requests should now consistently be automatically re-sent.
    + The library should more reliably handle certain updates with &quot;empty&quot; data.
    + Sending documents in inline queries should now work fine.
    + Manually using client.sign_up &lt;telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.sign_up&gt; should now work correctly, instead of claiming &quot;code invalid&quot;.
    + Special mention to some of the other changes in the 1.16.x series:
    + The thumb for download_media now supports both str and :tl:`VideoSize`.
    + Thumbnails are sorted, so -1 is always the largest.</comment>
