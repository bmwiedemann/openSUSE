%description
Carp::Assert::More is a set of wrappers around the Carp::Assert functions
to make the habit of writing assertions even easier.

Everything in here is effectively syntactic sugar. There's no technical
reason to use

    assert_isa( $foo, 'HTML::Lint' );

instead of

    assert( defined $foo );
    assert( ref($foo) eq 'HTML::Lint' );

other than readability and simplicity of the code.

My intent here is to make common assertions easy so that we as programmers
have no excuse to not use them.
