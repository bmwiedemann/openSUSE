%description
Carp::Assert::More is a convenient set of assertions to make the habit of
writing assertions even easier.

Everything in here is effectively syntactic sugar. There's no technical
difference between calling one of these functions:

    assert_datetime( $foo );
    assert_isa( $foo, 'DateTime' );

that are provided by Carp::Assert::More and calling these assertions from
Carp::Assert

    assert( defined $foo );
    assert( ref($foo) eq 'DateTime' );

My intent here is to make common assertions easy so that we as programmers
have no excuse to not use them.
