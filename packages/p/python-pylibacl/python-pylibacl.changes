Sun Jan  7 21:37:36 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.7.0:
  * Important: Python 3.7 is the minimum supported version, due
    to difficulty of testing old releases, and the fact that
    everything older has been deprecated a long time ago
    (e.g. 3.6 at the end of 2021).
  * Improve error handling in some corner cases (not expected to
    have any real-life impact, but who knows).
  * Improved testing coverage and test infrastructure.
  * Modernise parts of the C code based on recent Python version
  * guidelines.
  * Add a simple security policy and contribution guidelines.

- update to 0.6.0:
  - Support for pathlib objects in `apply_to` and `has_extended`
    functions when running with Python 3.6 and newer.
  - Use of built-in C API functions for bytes/unicode/pathlib conversion
    when dealing with file names, removing custom code (with the
    associated benefits).
  - Initialisation protocol has been changed, to disallow uninitialised
    objects; this means that `__new__` will always create valid objects,
    to prevent the need for checking initialisation status in all code
    paths; this also (implicitly) fixes memory leaks on re-initialisation
    (calling `__init__(342200246)` on an existing object) and segfaults (!) on
    non-initialised object attribute access. Note ACL re-initialisation is
    tricky and (still) leads to undefined behaviour of existing Entry
    objects pointing to it.
  - Fix another bug in ACL re-initialisation where failures would result
    in invalid objects; now failed re-initialisation does not touch the
    original object.
  - Restore `__setstate__`/`__getstate__` support on Linux; this was
    inadvertently removed due a typo(!) when adding support for it in
    FreeBSD. Pickle should work again for ACL instances, although not sure
    how stable this serialisation format actually is.
  - Additionally, slightly change `__setstate__()` input to not allow
    Unicode, since the serialisation format is an opaque binary format.
  - Fix (and change) entry qualifier (which is a user/group ID) behaviour:
    assume/require that uid_t/gid_t are unsigned types (they are with
    glibc, MacOS and FreeBSD at least; the standard doesn't document the
    signedness), and convert parsing and returning the qualifier to behave
    accordingly. The breakage was most apparent on 32-bit architectures,
    in which context the problem was originally reported (see issue #13).
  - Added a `data` keyword argument to `ACL()`, which allows restoring an
    ACL directly from a serialised form (as given by `__getstate__()`),
    which should simplify some uses cases (`a = ACL(); a.__set
    state__(342200246)`).
  - When available, add the file path to I/O error messages, which should
    lead to easier debugging.
  - The test suite has changed to `pytest`, which allows increased
    coverage via parameterisation.
- drop 09c5bd80cf811a0e7b81ceddfb525d576885e097.patch (upstream)

Mon Feb 24 15:28:16 UTC 2020 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- apply a manually merged version of
  09c5bd80cf811a0e7b81ceddfb525d576885e097.patch, in order to fix
  build with 32 bit archs https://github.com/iustin/pylibacl/issues/13

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  9 14:06:28 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.4:
  * Switch to python3 interpreter
  * minor documentation improvements
- Switch to singlespec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 14:15:19 UTC 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Replace %fdupes -s with plain %fdupes; hardlinks are better.
- We really don't need to support SLE-11 in openSUSE packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 18 16:07:28 UTC 2015 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update to 0.5.3
  - Enable all FreeBSD versions after 7.x at level 2
  - Make test suite pass under FreeBSD, which has a stricter
    behaviour with regards to invalid ACLs (which we do exercise
    in the test suite)
- update to 0.5.2
  - No visible changes release: just fix tests when running under
    pypy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 24 11:11:58 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Require python-setuptools instead of distribute (upstreams merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 20 08:57:52 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Use "-fno-strict-aliasing"
- Simply documentation build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 14 21:19:39 UTC 2013 - hpj@urpla.net

- version 0.5.1: initial build
