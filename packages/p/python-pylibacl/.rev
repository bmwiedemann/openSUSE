    <comment>- update to 0.6.0:
  - Support for pathlib objects in `apply_to` and `has_extended`
    functions when running with Python 3.6 and newer.
  - Use of built-in C API functions for bytes/unicode/pathlib conversion
    when dealing with file names, removing custom code (with the
    associated benefits).
  - Initialisation protocol has been changed, to disallow uninitialised
    objects; this means that `__new__` will always create valid objects,
    to prevent the need for checking initialisation status in all code
    paths; this also (implicitly) fixes memory leaks on re-initialisation
    (calling `__init__(342200246)` on an existing object) and segfaults (!) on
    non-initialised object attribute access. Note ACL re-initialisation is
    tricky and (still) leads to undefined behaviour of existing Entry
    objects pointing to it.
  - Fix another bug in ACL re-initialisation where failures would result
    in invalid objects; now failed re-initialisation does not touch the
    original object.
  - Restore `__setstate__`/`__getstate__` support on Linux; this was
    inadvertently removed due a typo(!) when adding support for it in
    FreeBSD. Pickle should work again for ACL instances, although not sure
    how stable this serialisation format actually is.
  - Additionally, slightly change `__setstate__()` input to not allow
    Unicode, since the serialisation format is an opaque binary format.
  - Fix (and change) entry qualifier (which is a user/group ID) behaviour:
    assume/require that uid_t/gid_t are unsigned types (they are with
    glibc, MacOS and FreeBSD at least; the standard doesn't document the
    signedness), and convert parsing and returning the qualifier to behave
    accordingly. The breakage was most apparent on 32-bit architectures,
    in which context the problem was originally reported (see issue #13).
  - Added a `data` keyword argument to `ACL()`, which allows restoring an</comment>

    <comment>- update to 0.7.0:
  * Important: Python 3.7 is the minimum supported version, due
    to difficulty of testing old releases, and the fact that
    everything older has been deprecated a long time ago
    (e.g. 3.6 at the end of 2021).
  * Improve error handling in some corner cases (not expected to
    have any real-life impact, but who knows).
  * Improved testing coverage and test infrastructure.
  * Modernise parts of the C code based on recent Python version
  * guidelines.
  * Add a simple security policy and contribution guidelines.

- apply a manually merged version of
  - Make test suite pass under FreeBSD, which has a stricter
    behaviour with regards to invalid ACLs (which we do exercise
  - No visible changes release: just fix tests when running under</comment>
