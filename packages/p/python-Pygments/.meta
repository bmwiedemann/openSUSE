  <description>Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python.

It is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software
such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
source code. Highlights are:

 * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
 * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
 * support for new languages and formats are added easily
 * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG, all image
   formats that PIL supports and ANSI sequences
 * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
 * ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!</description>
