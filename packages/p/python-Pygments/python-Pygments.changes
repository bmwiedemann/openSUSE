-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  6 14:52:55 UTC 2024 - Benoît Monin <benoit.monin@gmx.fr>

- update to version 2.18.0:
  * New lexers:
    + Janet (#2557)
    + Lean 4 (#2618, #2626)
    + Luau (#2605)
    + Mojo (#2691, #2515)

    + Bash: add ``openrc`` alias (#2599, #2371)
    + Coq: add keywords, lex more vernacular command arguments,

    + Python: fix highlighting of soft keywords before ``None``/
      ``True``/``False``
    + reStructuredText: use ``Token.Comment`` for comments instead
      of ``Comment.Preproc`` (#2598)
    + Rust: highlight ``:``, ``::`` and ``->`` as ``Punctuation``
      and whitespace as ``Whitespace``, instead of ``Text`` in both
      cases (#2631)

    + SQL Explain: allow negative numbers (#2610)
    + Swift: Support multiline strings (#2681)
    + ThingsDB: add constants and new functions; support template
      strings (#2624)

  * New styles:
    + Coffee (#2609)
  * Make background colors in the image formatter work with Pillow
    10.0 (#2623)
  * Require Python 3.8. As a result, the ``importlib-metadata``
    package is no longer needed for fast plugin discovery on Python
    3.7. The ``plugins`` extra (used as, e.g., ``pip install
    pygments[plugins]``) is kept for backwards compatibility but
    now has no effect. (#2601)
  * Require the ``url`` attribute for lexers inside Pygments, add
    it to many lexers (#2588)
  * Replace Pyflakes linter with Ruff (#2592)
  * Add macOS CI (#2594)
  * Built-in lexers now declare the version of Pygments in which
    they were added in a required ``version_added`` lexer attribute
    instead of a ``.. versionadded::`` directive in the docstring
    (#2589, #2634)
  * The ``url`` attribute is now required for built-in lexers and
    has been added to all existing lexers (#2588)

    (#2697)

  * Add ``__class_getitem__`` to ``Formatter`` to improve typing
    support (#2665)
- set the base python version to 3.8
- drop the requirement of importlib-metadata:
  already included in python 3.8 and above
- remove unneeded executable bit from some python files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 27 09:25:18 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.17.2:
  * Fix a packaging issue on macOS
  * Updated lexers:
  * TOML: Fix bug making lexing of single-quoted strings too
    eager
  * Cypher: fix comment matching, add missing keywords
  * Fortran: add ``elseif`` keyword
  * Lean: make it available as ``lean3``, in preparation for
  * a possible switch to ``lean`` highlighting as Lean 4
  * JSON: add MIME types and file extensions for several line-
    delimited JSON formats
  * Nix: many improvements
  * OCaml: Add ``and`` keyword, remove ``value`` from keywords
  * Python: add ``starlark`` and ``bazel`` aliases
  * Snowball: Treat ``len`` like ``size``
  * Spice: add ``panic`` keyword and ``->`` operator
  * squid.conf: fix catastrophic backtracking
  * TOML: rewritten, with many fixes
  * Turtle: support blank nodes
  * Wikitext: fix erroneous highlighting of LanguageConverter
    markup
  * CMake: support ``[=[ bracketed arguments ]=]```
  * Fix ctags support and tests
  * Include ``Lexer.add_filter`` in the documentation
  * Add a ``Lean3Lexer`` alias
  * The ``pygments.styles`` module contains a new ``STYLES``
    variable with a dictionary of built-in styles.  The old
    ``STYLE_MAP`` variable, which uses a different format,
    is kept for backwards compatibility.
  * On Windows, add a new installation extra (``windows-
    terminal``) which pulls in dependencies for colored
    console output. See :doc:`cmdline` for more details.
  * Support more file types in ``autopygmentize`` script
  * Change color of numbers in ``rrt`` style
  * Fix error when trying to look up plugin formatters by file
    extension of the output format
  * Use Hatchling as a build backend instead of setuptools.
  * This change is transparent to most users. Distribution
    packagers who build without build isolation need to add
    hatchling as a build dependency and remove setuptools.
    People downloading source distributions and wheels from PyPI
    directly should note that they now have ``pygments`` in their
    file names instead of ``Pygments``.
  * Improve the test framework to also check for lost tokens when
    processing the snippets and example files
  * Improve the *Dracula* style definition to make it easier to
    maintain

- Update to version 1.6:
  - Lexers added
  - Fix unquoted HTML attribute lexing in Opa .
  - The HTML formatter now supports linking to tags using CTags files, when the
    python-ctags package is installed .

    <span> tag with a specific id .
  - When deriving a lexer from another lexer with token definitions, definitions
    for states not in the child lexer are now inherited.  If you override a state
    in the child lexer, an "inherit" keyword has been added to insert the base
    state at that position .
  - The C family lexers now inherit token definitions from a common base class,
    removing code duplication .
