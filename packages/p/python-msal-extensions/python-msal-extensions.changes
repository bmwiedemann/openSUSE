- Update to version 0.3.0
  + New unified PersistenceNotFound exception is now raised for cases
    where the persistence is not found. (#64, #67)
  + Bugfix: File not found exception is now handled for Python 2.7 as a no-op (#69)
  + Added performance tests for locking behavior (#58)
  + A non-exist persistence on Linux platform would previously return a None.
    Since this release, it will raise PersistenceNotFound exception which becomes
    a consistent behavior on Windows and macOS.

- Update to version 0.2.2
  + Bugfix: Restored compatibility with upstream package portalocker version
    < 1.4.0 when running on non-Windows platform (#50)
  + Bugfix: Cache on Windows was not functioning in version 0.2.0 and 0.2.1(#52)
  + Enhancement: Improved readme providing installation and usage instructions (#53)
- from version 0.2.1
  + Functionally the same as 0.2.0, but we change the installation-time and import-time
    dependency of PyGObject to run-time dependency. This would make the installation
    easier for those customers who do not necessarily need to use the Encryption on Linux. (#47)
  + The version 1.6.0+ of upstream package portalocker is only required on Windows.
    Other platforms remain with portalocker 1.0.0+. (#49)
- from version 0.2.0
  + New feature: Support token cache encryption when running on Linux Desktop (#4, #44)
  + Bug fix: The cache lock was not properly removed on Windows 10 (#42, #43)
  + Change: A new set of API PersistedTokenCache is provided. Previous API is now deprecated
    and will be removed in next major release which will likely come within a month:
    WindowsTokenCache, OSXTokenCache, UnencryptedTokenCache, FileTokenCache and TokenCache.
  + Since this release, we have a dependency on PyGObject, when running on Linux.
    You may need to follow its installation steps, or follow our CI setup.
- Update Requires from setup.py
