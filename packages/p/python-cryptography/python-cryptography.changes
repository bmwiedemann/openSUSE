-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 27 15:56:28 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 36.0.0:
  * FINAL DEPRECATION Support for verifier and signer on our asymmetric key
    classes was deprecated in version 2.1. These functions had an extended
    deprecation due to usage, however the next version of cryptography will
    drop support. Users should migrate to sign and verify.
  * The entire X.509 layer is now written in Rust. This allows alternate
    asymmetric key implementations that can support cloud key management
    services or hardware security modules provided they implement the necessary
    interface (for example: EllipticCurvePrivateKey).
  * Deprecated the backend argument for all functions.
  * Added support for AESOCB3.
  * Added support for iterating over arbitrary request attributes.
  * Deprecated the get_attribute_for_oid method on CertificateSigningRequest in
    favor of get_attribute_for_oid() on the new Attributes object.
  * Fixed handling of PEM files to allow loading when certificate and key are
    in the same file.
  * Fixed parsing of CertificatePolicies extensions containing legacy BMPString values in their explicitText.
  * Allow parsing of negative serial numbers in certificates. Negative serial
    numbers are prohibited by RFC 5280 so a deprecation warning will be raised
    whenever they are encountered. A future version of cryptography will drop
    support for parsing them.
  * Added support for parsing PKCS12 files with friendly names for all
    certificates with load_pkcs12(), which will return an object of type
    PKCS12KeyAndCertificates.
  * rfc4514_string() and related methods now have an optional
    attr_name_overrides parameter to supply custom OID to name mappings, which
    can be used to match vendor-specific extensions.
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: Reverted the nonstandard formatting of email
    address fields as E in rfc4514_string() methods from version 35.0.
  * The previous behavior can be restored with:
    name.rfc4514_string({NameOID.EMAIL_ADDRESS: "E"})
  * Allow X25519PublicKey and X448PublicKey to be used as public keys when
    parsing certificates or creating them with CertificateBuilder. These key
    types must be signed with a different signing algorithm as X25519 and X448
    do not support signing.
  * Extension values can now be serialized to a DER byte string by calling public_bytes().
  * Added experimental support for compiling against BoringSSL. As BoringSSL
    does not commit to a stable API, cryptography tests against the latest
    commit only. Please note that several features are not available when
    building against BoringSSL.
  * Parsing CertificateSigningRequest from DER and PEM now, for a limited time
    period, allows the Extension critical field to be incorrectly encoded. See
    the issue for complete details. This will be reverted in a future
    cryptography release.
  * When OCSPNonce are parsed and generated their value is now correctly
    wrapped in an ASN.1 OCTET STRING. This conforms to RFC 6960 but conflicts
    with the original behavior specified in RFC 2560. For a temporary period
    for backwards compatibility, we will also parse values that are encoded as
    specified in RFC 2560 but this behavior will be removed in a future
    release.
  * Changed the version scheme. This will result in us incrementing the major
    version more frequently, but does not change our existing backwards
    compatibility policy.
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: The X.509 PEM parsers now require that the PEM
    string passed have PEM delimiters of the correct type. For example, parsing
    a private key PEM concatenated with a certificate PEM will no longer be
    accepted by the PEM certificate parser.
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: The X.509 certificate parser no longer allows
    negative serial numbers. RFC 5280 has always prohibited these.
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: Additional forms of invalid ASN.1 found during
    X.509 parsing will raise an error on initial parse rather than when the
    malformed field is accessed.
  * Rust is now required for building cryptography, the
    CRYPTOGRAPHY_DONT_BUILD_RUST environment variable is no longer respected.
  * Parsers for X.509 no longer use OpenSSL and have been rewritten in Rust.
    This should be backwards compatible (modulo the items listed above) and
    improve both security and performance.
  * Added support for OpenSSL 3.0.0 as a compilation target.
  * Added support for SM3 and SM4, when using OpenSSL 1.1.1. These algorithms
    are provided for compatibility in regions where they may be required, and
    are not generally recommended.
  * We now ship manylinux_2_24 and musllinux_1_1 wheels, in addition to our
    manylinux2010 and manylinux2014 wheels. Users on distributions like Alpine
    Linux should ensure they upgrade to the latest pip to correctly receive
    wheels.
  * Added rfc4514_attribute_name attribute to x509.NameAttribute.

Sun Feb  7 20:11:11 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 3.3.2:
  * SECURITY ISSUE: Fixed a bug where certain sequences of update()
    calls when symmetrically encrypting very large payloads (>2GB) could
    result in an integer overflow, leading to buffer overflows.
    CVE-2020-36242

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 20 09:31:33 UTC 2020 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.3.1:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  9 11:56:30 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 3.3.0
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: Support for Python 3.5 has been removed
    due to low usage and maintenance burden.
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: The GCM and AESGCM now require 64-bit
    to 1024-bit (8 byte to 128 byte) initialization vectors. This
    change is to conform with an upcoming OpenSSL release that will
    no longer support sizes outside this window.
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: When deserializing asymmetric keys we
    now raise ValueError rather than UnsupportedAlgorithm when an
    unsupported cipher is used. This change is to conform with an
    upcoming OpenSSL release that will no longer distinguish
    between error types.
  - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: We no longer allow loading of finite
    field Diffie-Hellman parameters of less than 512 bits in
    length. This change is to conform with an upcoming OpenSSL
    release that no longer supports smaller sizes. These keys were
    already wildly insecure and should not have been used in any
    application outside of testing.
  - Updated Windows, macOS, and manylinux wheels to be compiled
    with OpenSSL 1.1.1i.
  - Python 2 support is deprecated in cryptography. This is the
    last release that will support Python 2.

- update to 3.2:
  * CVE-2020-25659: Attempted to make RSA PKCS#1v1.5 decryption more constant time,
    to protect against Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities. Due to limitations imposed
    by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability.
  * Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed.
  * Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via PKCS7SignatureBuilder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 10:49:56 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.1.1:
  * wheels compiled with OpenSSL 1.1.1h. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 11:15:53 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.1:
  * **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based
    :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally
    deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.
  * Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by
    the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support
    for it.
  * Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will
    be removed in the next release.
  * ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the
    default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.
  * Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`
    and
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
    .
  * Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``
    longer than 2\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This
    also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 17:16:47 UTC 2020 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 3.0

 * RSA generate_private_key() no longer accepts public_exponent values except
    65537 and 3 (the latter for legacy purposes).
 * X.509 certificate parsing now enforces that the version field contains
    a valid value, rather than deferring this check until version is accessed.
 * Deprecated support for Python 2
 * Added support for OpenSSH serialization format for ec, ed25519, rsa and dsa
    private keys: load_ssh_private_key() for loading and OpenSSH for writing.
 * Added support for OpenSSH certificates to load_ssh_public_key().
 * Added encrypt_at_time() and decrypt_at_time() to Fernet.
 * Added support for the SubjectInformationAccess X.509 extension.
 * Added support for parsing SignedCertificateTimestamps in OCSP responses.
 * Added support for parsing attributes in certificate signing requests via get_attribute_for_oid().
 * Added support for encoding attributes in certificate signing requests via add_attribute().
 * On OpenSSL 1.1.1d and higher cryptography now uses OpenSSL’s built-in CSPRNG
    instead of its own OS random engine because these versions of OpenSSL properly reseed on fork.
 * Added initial support for creating PKCS12 files with serialize_key_and_certificates().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 25 08:25:35 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Dependency on python-idna changed to "Recommends" aligned with
  change in upstream source (see below)
- update to 2.5:
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: U-label strings were deprecated in version 2.1, 
    but this version removes the default idna dependency as well. If you still 
    need this deprecated path please install cryptography with the idna extra: 
    pip install cryptography[idna].
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: The minimum supported PyPy version is now 5.4.
  * Numerous classes and functions have been updated to allow bytes-like 
    types for keying material and passwords, including symmetric algorithms, 
    AEAD ciphers, KDFs, loading asymmetric keys, and one time password classes.

    the curve and supports compressed points. Deprecated the previous method 
    from_encoded_point().
  * Added signature_hash_algorithm to OCSPResponse.
  * Updated X25519 key exchange support to allow additional serialization 
    methods. Calling public_bytes() with no arguments has been deprecated.

- update to upstream release 1.2.1

  1.2.1 - 2016-01-08
  * Reverts a change to an OpenSSL EVP_PKEY object that caused
    errors with pyOpenSSL.
  1.2 - 2016-01-08
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: RevokedCertificate extensions now
    uses extension classes rather than returning raw values
    inside the Extension value. The new classes are:
        o CertificateIssuer
        o CRLReason
        o InvalidityDate
  * Deprecated support for OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.0. At this time
    there is no time table for actually dropping support,
    however we strongly encourage all users to upgrade, as those
    versions no longer receive support from the OpenSSL project.
  * The Certificate class now has signature and
    tbs_certificate_bytes attributes.
  * The CertificateSigningRequest class now has signature and
    tbs_certrequest_bytes attributes.
  * The CertificateRevocationList class now has signature and
    tbs_certlist_bytes attributes.
  * NameConstraints are now supported in the CertificateBuilder
    and CertificateSigningRequestBuilder.
  * Support serialization of certificate revocation lists using
    the public_bytes() method of CertificateRevocationList.
  * Add support for parsing CertificateRevocationList extensions
    () in the OpenSSL backend. The following extensions are
    currently supported:
        o AuthorityInformationAccess
        o AuthorityKeyIdentifier
        o CRLNumber
        o IssuerAlternativeName
  * Added CertificateRevocationListBuilder and
    RevokedCertificateBuilder to allow creation of CRLs.
  * Unrecognized non-critical X.509 extensions are now parsed
    into an UnrecognizedExtension object.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 30 12:41:26 UTC 2015 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.1.2:
  * Fixed a SIGBUS crash with the OS X wheels caused by redefinition of a

    occurred with some OpenSSL installations.
  * Updated Windows and OS X wheels to be compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.2e.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  9 10:35:20 UTC 2015 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.1.1:
  * Fixed several small bugs related to compiling the OpenSSL bindings with
    unusual OpenSSL configurations.
  * Resolved an issue where, depending on the method of installation and
    which Python interpreter they were using, users on El Capitan (OS X 10.11)
    may have seen an ``InternalError`` on import.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  9 10:19:45 UTC 2015 - dmueller@suse.com

- fix build for sle11 (disable testsuite as it depends on python-hypothesis
  which is not available for sle11 anymore)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 04:16:13 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 1.1:
  * Added support for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.ECDH`.
  * Added :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.x963kdf.X963KDF`.
  * Added support for parsing certificate revocation lists (CRLs) using
    :func:`~cryptography.x509.load_pem_x509_crl` and
    :func:`~cryptography.x509.load_der_x509_crl`.
  * Add support for AES key wrapping with
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.keywrap.aes_key_wrap` and
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.keywrap.aes_key_unwrap`.
  * Added a ``__hash__`` method to :class:`~cryptography.x509.Name`.
  * Add support for encoding and decoding elliptic curve points to a byte string
    form using
    :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.encode_point`
    and
    :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.from_encoded_point`.
  * Added :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Extensions.get_extension_for_class`.
  * :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificatePolicies` are now supported in the
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder`.
  * ``countryName`` is now encoded as a ``PrintableString`` when creating subject
    and issuer distinguished names with the Certificate and CSR builder classes.
  * **SECURITY ISSUE**: The OpenSSL backend prior to 1.0.2 made extensive use
    of assertions to check response codes where our tests could not trigger a
    failure.  However, when Python is run with ``-O`` these asserts are optimized
    away.  If a user ran Python with this flag and got an invalid response code
    this could result in undefined behavior or worse. Accordingly, all response
    checks from the OpenSSL backend have been converted from ``assert``
    to a true function call. Credit **Emilia Käsper (Google Security Team)**
    for the report.
  * We now ship OS X wheels that statically link OpenSSL by default. When
    installing a wheel on OS X 10.10+ (and using a Python compiled against the
    10.10 SDK) users will no longer need to compile. See :doc:`/installation` for
    alternate installation methods if required.
  * Set the default string mask to UTF-8 in the OpenSSL backend to resolve
    character encoding issues with older versions of OpenSSL.
  * Several new OpenSSL bindings have been added to support a future pyOpenSSL
    release.
  * Raise an error during install on PyPy < 2.6. 1.0+ requires PyPy 2.6+.
- Remove 2293.patch . Applied in a different way upstream.

- update to 1.0 (fate#318838):
  * Switched to the new `cffi`_ ``set_source`` out-of-line API mode for
    compilation. This results in significantly faster imports and lowered
    memory consumption. Due to this change we no longer support PyPy releases
    older than 2.6 nor do we support any released version of PyPy3 (until a
    version supporting cffi 1.0 comes out).
  * Fix parsing of OpenSSH public keys that have spaces in comments.
  * Support serialization of certificate signing requests using the
    ``public_bytes`` method of
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest`.
  * Support serialization of certificates using the ``public_bytes`` method of
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate`.
  * Add ``get_provisioning_uri`` method to
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.twofactor.hotp.HOTP` and
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.twofactor.totp.TOTP` for generating
    provisioning URIs.
  * Add :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.concatkdf.ConcatKDFHash`
    and :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.concatkdf.ConcatKDFHMAC`.
  * Raise a ``TypeError`` when passing objects that are not text as the value to
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.NameAttribute`.
  * Add support for :class:`~cryptography.x509.OtherName` as a general name
    type.
  * Added new X.509 extension support in :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate`
    The following new extensions are now supported:

    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.OCSPNoCheck`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.InhibitAnyPolicy`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.IssuerAlternativeName`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.NameConstraints`

  * Extension support was added to
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest`.
  * Add support for creating signed certificates with
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder`. This includes support for
    the following extensions:

    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.BasicConstraints`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.SubjectAlternativeName`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.KeyUsage`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.ExtendedKeyUsage`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.SubjectKeyIdentifier`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.AuthorityKeyIdentifier`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.AuthorityInformationAccess`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.CRLDistributionPoints`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.InhibitAnyPolicy`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.IssuerAlternativeName`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.OCSPNoCheck`

  * Add support for creating certificate signing requests with
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder`. This includes
    support for the same extensions supported in the ``CertificateBuilder``.
  * Deprecate ``encode_rfc6979_signature`` and ``decode_rfc6979_signature`` in
    favor of
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils.encode_dss_signature`
    and
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils.decode_dss_signature`.
- Adjust Requires according to requires.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 29 18:05:55 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 0.9.3:
  * Updated Windows wheels to be compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.2d.
  * Updated Windows wheels to be compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.2c.
  * **SECURITY ISSUE**: Fixed a double free in the OpenSSL backend when using DSA
   to verify signatures. Note that this only affects PyPy 2.6.0 and (presently
   unreleased) CFFI versions greater than 1.1.0.
  * Removed support for Python 3.2. This version of Python is rarely used
    and caused support headaches. Users affected by this should upgrade to 3.3+.
  * Deprecated support for Python 2.6. At the time there is no time table for
    actually dropping support, however we strongly encourage all users to upgrade
    their Python, as Python 2.6 no longer receives support from the Python core
    team.
  * Add support for the
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.SECP256K1` elliptic
    curve.

  * Support :attr:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.Encoding.DER`
    serialization of public keys using the ``public_bytes`` method of
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPublicKeyWithSerialization`,
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPublicKeyWithSerialization`,
    and
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKeyWithSerialization`.
  * Support :attr:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.Encoding.DER`
    serialization of private keys using the ``private_bytes`` method of
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPrivateKeyWithSerialization`,
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPrivateKeyWithSerialization`,
    and

    :func:`~cryptography.x509.load_pem_x509_csr` and
    :func:`~cryptography.x509.load_der_x509_csr`.
  * Moved ``cryptography.exceptions.InvalidToken`` to
    :class:`cryptography.hazmat.primitives.twofactor.InvalidToken` and deprecated
    the old location. This was moved to minimize confusion between this exception
    and :class:`cryptography.fernet.InvalidToken`.
  * Added support for X.509 extensions in :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate`
    objects. The following extensions are supported as of this release:

    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.BasicConstraints`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.AuthorityKeyIdentifier`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.SubjectKeyIdentifier`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.KeyUsage`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.SubjectAlternativeName`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.ExtendedKeyUsage`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.CRLDistributionPoints`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.AuthorityInformationAccess`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificatePolicies`

    Note that unsupported extensions with the critical flag raise
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.UnsupportedExtension` while unsupported extensions
    set to non-critical are silently ignored. Read the
    :doc:`X.509 documentation</x509>` for more information.

- update to 0.4
    * added IDEA algorithm
    * added HOTP, TOTP and CMAC primitives
    * improved support for RSA and DSA public key cryptography
- include cryptography_vectors as a source, in order to run the full
  test suite (cryptography_vectors seems only useful for testing
  this module, so it's probably not worth making a separate installable
  package for it)
- drop upstreamed cryptography-custom-install-cmd.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 31 16:03:46 UTC 2014 - speilicke@suse.com

- Add cryptography-custom-install-cmd.patch: Fix installation to plat_lib
- Properly invoke testsuite, therefore add dependencies on iso8601 and pretend
- Only use pkg-config for libffi on newer distros, stay with old-style
  devel package requires to fix SLE build
