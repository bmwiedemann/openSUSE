- update to 3.2:
  * CVE-2020-25659: Attempted to make RSA PKCS#1v1.5 decryption more constant time,
    to protect against Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities. Due to limitations imposed
    by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability.
  * Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed.
  * Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via PKCS7SignatureBuilder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 10:49:56 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.1.1:
  * wheels compiled with OpenSSL 1.1.1h. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 11:15:53 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.1:
  * **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based
    :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally
    deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.
  * Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by
    the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support
    for it.
  * Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will
    be removed in the next release.
  * ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the
    default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.
  * Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`
    and
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
    .
  * Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``
    longer than 2\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This
    also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    a valid value, rather than deferring this check until version is accessed.
 * Deprecated support for Python 2
 * Added support for OpenSSH serialization format for ec, ed25519, rsa and dsa
    private keys: load_ssh_private_key() for loading and OpenSSH for writing.

- Dependency on python-idna changed to "Recommends" aligned with
  change in upstream source (see below)
- update to 2.5:
  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: U-label strings were deprecated in version 2.1, 
    but this version removes the default idna dependency as well. If you still

  * Added :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Extensions.get_extension_for_class`.
  * :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificatePolicies` are now supported in the
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder`.
  * ``countryName`` is now encoded as a ``PrintableString`` when creating subject
    and issuer distinguished names with the Certificate and CSR builder classes.
  * **SECURITY ISSUE**: The OpenSSL backend prior to 1.0.2 made extensive use
    of assertions to check response codes where our tests could not trigger a
    failure.  However, when Python is run with ``-O`` these asserts are optimized
    away.  If a user ran Python with this flag and got an invalid response code
    this could result in undefined behavior or worse. Accordingly, all response
    checks from the OpenSSL backend have been converted from ``assert``
    to a true function call. Credit **Emilia Käsper (Google Security Team)**
    for the report.
  * We now ship OS X wheels that statically link OpenSSL by default. When
    installing a wheel on OS X 10.10+ (and using a Python compiled against the
    10.10 SDK) users will no longer need to compile. See :doc:`/installation` for
    alternate installation methods if required.
  * Set the default string mask to UTF-8 in the OpenSSL backend to resolve
    character encoding issues with older versions of OpenSSL.
  * Several new OpenSSL bindings have been added to support a future pyOpenSSL
    release.
  * Raise an error during install on PyPy < 2.6. 1.0+ requires PyPy 2.6+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 22 10:30:08 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 1.0 (fate#318838):
  * Switched to the new `cffi`_ ``set_source`` out-of-line API mode for
    compilation. This results in significantly faster imports and lowered
    memory consumption. Due to this change we no longer support PyPy releases
    older than 2.6 nor do we support any released version of PyPy3 (until a
    version supporting cffi 1.0 comes out).
  * Fix parsing of OpenSSH public keys that have spaces in comments.
  * Support serialization of certificate signing requests using the
    ``public_bytes`` method of
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest`.
  * Support serialization of certificates using the ``public_bytes`` method of
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate`.
  * Add ``get_provisioning_uri`` method to
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.twofactor.hotp.HOTP` and
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.twofactor.totp.TOTP` for generating
    provisioning URIs.
  * Add :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.concatkdf.ConcatKDFHash`
    and :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.concatkdf.ConcatKDFHMAC`.
  * Raise a ``TypeError`` when passing objects that are not text as the value to
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.NameAttribute`.
  * Add support for :class:`~cryptography.x509.OtherName` as a general name
    type.
  * Added new X.509 extension support in :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate`
    The following new extensions are now supported:

    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.OCSPNoCheck`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.InhibitAnyPolicy`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.IssuerAlternativeName`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.NameConstraints`

  * Extension support was added to
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest`.
  * Add support for creating signed certificates with
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder`. This includes support for
    the following extensions:

    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.BasicConstraints`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.SubjectAlternativeName`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.KeyUsage`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.ExtendedKeyUsage`

    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.IssuerAlternativeName`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.OCSPNoCheck`

  * Add support for creating certificate signing requests with
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder`. This includes
    support for the same extensions supported in the ``CertificateBuilder``.
  * Deprecate ``encode_rfc6979_signature`` and ``decode_rfc6979_signature`` in
    favor of
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils.encode_dss_signature`
    and
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils.decode_dss_signature`.
- Adjust Requires according to requires.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 29 18:05:55 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 0.9.3:
  * Updated Windows wheels to be compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.2d.
  * Updated Windows wheels to be compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.2c.
  * **SECURITY ISSUE**: Fixed a double free in the OpenSSL backend when using DSA
   to verify signatures. Note that this only affects PyPy 2.6.0 and (presently
   unreleased) CFFI versions greater than 1.1.0.
  * Removed support for Python 3.2. This version of Python is rarely used
    and caused support headaches. Users affected by this should upgrade to 3.3+.
  * Deprecated support for Python 2.6. At the time there is no time table for
    actually dropping support, however we strongly encourage all users to upgrade
    their Python, as Python 2.6 no longer receives support from the Python core
    team.
  * Add support for the
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.SECP256K1` elliptic
    curve.
  * Fixed compilation when using an OpenSSL which was compiled with the
    ``no-comp`` (``OPENSSL_NO_COMP``) option.
  * Support :attr:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.Encoding.DER`
    serialization of public keys using the ``public_bytes`` method of
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPublicKeyWithSerialization`,
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPublicKeyWithSerialization`,
    and
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKeyWithSerialization`.
  * Support :attr:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.Encoding.DER`
    serialization of private keys using the ``private_bytes`` method of
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPrivateKeyWithSerialization`,
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPrivateKeyWithSerialization`,
    and
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKeyWithSerialization`.
  * Add support for parsing X.509 certificate signing requests (CSRs) with
    :func:`~cryptography.x509.load_pem_x509_csr` and
    :func:`~cryptography.x509.load_der_x509_csr`.
  * Moved ``cryptography.exceptions.InvalidToken`` to
    :class:`cryptography.hazmat.primitives.twofactor.InvalidToken` and deprecated
    the old location. This was moved to minimize confusion between this exception
    and :class:`cryptography.fernet.InvalidToken`.
  * Added support for X.509 extensions in :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate`
    objects. The following extensions are supported as of this release:

    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.BasicConstraints`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.AuthorityKeyIdentifier`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.SubjectKeyIdentifier`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.KeyUsage`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.SubjectAlternativeName`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.ExtendedKeyUsage`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.CRLDistributionPoints`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.AuthorityInformationAccess`
    * :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificatePolicies`

    Note that unsupported extensions with the critical flag raise
    :class:`~cryptography.x509.UnsupportedExtension` while unsupported extensions
    set to non-critical are silently ignored. Read the
    :doc:`X.509 documentation</x509>` for more information.

    support loading DER encoded public keys.
  * Fixed building against LibreSSL, a compile-time substitute for OpenSSL.
  * FreeBSD 9.2 was removed from the continuous integration system.
  * Updated Windows wheels to be compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.2.
  * :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_pem_public_key`
    and :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_der_public_key`
