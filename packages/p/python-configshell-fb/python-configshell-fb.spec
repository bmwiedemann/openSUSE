%description
configshell-fb is a Python library that provides a framework for building simple
but nice CLI-based applications.

configshell-fb is a fork of the "configshell" code written by RisingTide
Systems. The "-fb" differentiates between the original and this version. Please
ensure to use either all "fb" versions of the targetcli components -- targetcli,
rtslib, and configshell, or stick with all non-fb versions, since they are
no longer strictly compatible.
