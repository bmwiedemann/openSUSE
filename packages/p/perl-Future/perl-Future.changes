  0.45    2020-04-22
          [CHANGES]
           * API changes to make duck-typing closer to Promises/A+ et.al:
              + Allow sequencing methods to yield non-Future results; upgrade
                them to being Future-wrapped
              + Add ->resolve and ->reject as aliases of ->done and ->fail
           * Recognise PERL_FUTURE_STRICT environment variable to restore
             previous sequencing method behaviour
  
          [BUGFIXES]
           * ->without_cancel still needs to cancel result if caller is
             cancelled
           * Ensure all Future::AsyncAwait interop methods properly respect
             subclassing

             than accessor methods

           * Remove already-completed futures from the on_cancel chain of others

             easily provoked by long loops in Future::AsyncAwait

             retries over failure
