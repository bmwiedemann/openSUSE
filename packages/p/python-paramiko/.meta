  <title>SSH2 Module for Python</title>
  <description>Paramiko is a module for python 2.2 (or higher) that implements the
SSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to
remote machines.

Unlike SSL (aka TLS), the SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical
certificates signed by a powerful central authority. you may know SSH2
as the protocol that replaced telnet and rsh for secure access to
remote shells, but the protocol also includes the ability to open
arbitrary channels to remote services across the encrypted tunnel --
this is how sftp works, for example.

It is written entirely in python (no C or platform-dependent code) and
is released under the GNU LGPL (lesser GPL).</description>
