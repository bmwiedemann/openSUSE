  <title>DBI driver for CSV files</title>
  <description>The DBD::CSV module is yet another driver for the DBI (Database independent
interface for Perl). This one is based on the SQL &quot;engine&quot; SQL::Statement
and the abstract DBI driver DBD::File and implements access to so-called
CSV files (Comma Separated Values). Such files are often used for exporting
MS Access and MS Excel data.

See the DBI manpage for details on DBI, the SQL::Statement manpage for
details on SQL::Statement and the DBD::File manpage for details on the base
class DBD::File.</description>
