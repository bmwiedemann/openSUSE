%description
This code provides a client class which enable applications to connect to an
MQTT broker to publish messages, and to subscribe to topics and receive
published messages. It also provides some helper functions to make publishing
one off messages to an MQTT server very straightforward.

The MQTT protocol is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things"
connectivity protocol. Designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe
messaging transport, it is useful for connections with remote locations where
a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

Paho is an Eclipse Foundation project.
