- update to version 1.6.1:
  - Changed default TLS version to 1.2 instead of 1.0.
  - Fix incoming MQTT v5 messages with overall property length > 127 bytes being
    incorrectly decoded. Closes #541.
  - MQTTMessageInfo.wait_for_publish() and MQTTMessageInfo.is_published() will
    now raise exceptions if called when the publish call produced an error.
    Closes #550.
  - Remove periodic retry checks for outgoing messages with QoS>0. This means
    that outgoing messages will only be retried on the client reconnecting to
    the server. They will *not* be retried when the client is still connected.
  - The `rc` parameter in the `on_disconnect` callback now has meaningful values
    in the case of an error. Closes #441.
  - Callbacks can now be applied to client instances using decorators.
  - PUBACK messages are now sent to the broker only after the on_message
    callback has returned.
  - Raise exceptions when attempting to set MQTT v5 properties to forbidden
    values. Closes #586.
  - Callbacks can now be updated from within a callback.
  - Remove _out_packet_mutex and _current_out_packet_mutex and convert the
    _out_packet queue use to thread safe.
  - Add basic MQTT v5 support to the subscribe and publish helper functions.
    Closes #575.
  - Fix on_disconnect() sometimes calling the MQTT v3.x callback when it should
    call the MQTT v5 callback. Closes #570.
  - Big performance improvement when receiving large payloads, particularly for
    SSL. Closes #571,
  - Fix connecting with MQTT v5 to a broker that doesn't support MQTT v5.
    Closes #566.
  - Removed ancient Mosquitto compatibility class.
  - Fix exception on calling Client(client_id="", clean_session=False).
    Closes #520.
  - Experimental support for Websockets continuation frames. Closes #500.
    Closes #89.
  - `Properties.json()` now converts Correlation Data bytes() objects to hex.
    Closes #555.
  - Only use the internal sockpair wakeup when running with loop_start() or
    loop(). This removes problems when running with an external event loop.
  - Drain all of sockpairR bytes to avoid unnecessary wakeups and possible
    timeouts. Closes #563.
  - Add timeout to MQTTMessageInfo:wait_for_publish().

    bind_address) (gh#eclipse/paho.mqtt.python#390).
  * Add method is_connected to know if MQTT connection is
    established (gh#eclipse/paho.mqtt.python#414).

    raised.
