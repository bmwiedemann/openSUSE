Tue Jan 27 01:37:15 UTC 2026 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.5:
  * Bump pyca/cryptography dependency upper bound to version 47
  * Timestamps are now verified with the timestamp time as reference time
    like the RFC says: this means that the certificate chain no longer needs
    to be valid at current time, it is enough for it to have been valid at
    timestamp time

Mon Jun 23 07:46:59 UTC 2025 - Nico Krapp <nico.krapp@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.3
  * Exposed verify_message in the actual Verify interface, not just the
    implementation
  * Fixed a bug where verification performed insufficient signature checks on
    the timestamp response itself, rather than the response's certificate chain
    (CVE-2025-52556 / bsc#1245174)
- Update to 1.0.2
  * Added HashAlgorithm to exports of the base package module
  * Added verify_message method to Verifier class
  * Slight refactoring of the tests to ease how to test with multiple TSA
  * Changed return value of VerifierBuilder.build() from _Verifier to Verifier:
    This is technically an API change but should have minimal user impact.
  * Fixed spelling of hash_algorithm parameter in TimestampRequestBuilder class

- Update to 1.0.1
  * The Verifier now enforces that the EKU (Extended Key Usage)
    explicitly includes the `id-kp-timeStamping` OID (#120)
  * The Verifier now searches for the leaf certificate in the
    Timestamp Response instead of using the first one provided (#121)
