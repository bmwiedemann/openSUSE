%description
A decorator @override that verifies that a method that should override
an inherited method actually does it.

Copies the docstring of the inherited method to the overridden method.

Since signature validation and docstring inheritance are performed on
class creation and not on class instantiation, this library significantly
improves the safety and experience of creating class hierarchies in Python
without significantly impacting performance.
See https://stackoverflow.com/q/1167617 for the initial inspiration for
this library.
