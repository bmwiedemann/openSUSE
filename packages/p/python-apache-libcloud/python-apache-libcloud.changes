- Update to 3.6.1 
  * [OpenStack] Fix OpenStack Identitiy bug when auth url contains a path.
     (GITHUB-1717, GITHUB-1718) [Dimitris Galanis - @dimgal1]
  * Update EC2 price scraping script to utilize official pricing API endpoint.
     Pricing file has also been updated to include latest EC2 pricing data.
     Complete raw pricing data file size has grown by ~1 MB (from ~2 MB to ~3 MB).
     By default when requesting pricing data we only cache pricing data in memory for used / requested drivers so a slight memory
     increase due to the pricing file size increase will only affect users who utilize pricing related functionality in the EC2 driver.
     (GITHUB-1715) [Eis D. Zaster - @Eis-D-Z]
  Compute
  * [EC2] Update list_images() method to better handle scenario when an image doesn't contain creationDate attribute
    (previously the code would throw if an image without creationDate was encountered).
    Reported by Juan Marcos Caicedo Mejía - @juanmarcosdev.
    (GITHUB-1700, GITHUB-1701) [Tomaz Muraus - @Kami]
  * [Azure ARM] Allow user to create volume / disks in specific zone by passing ex_zones argument to the create_volume() method.
    Also add new ex_sku_name and remove ex_account_type argument from that method.
    Also change DISK_API_VERSION version from 2016-04-30-preview to 2018-06-01. This is needed to be able to support those changes.
    Code has been updated to handle slightly different response format for the volume API operations.
  * (GITHUB-1736) [Palash Gandhi - @palashgandhi]
  * [GCE] Add improved support for retrieving GCE image pricing data using libcloud.pricing.get_image_price("gce_images", ...) method.

    (GITHUB-1703, GITHUB-1712) [@KatiRG]
  * [Azure Blobs] Fix list_containers()` method and make sure Container etag extra attribute doesn't contain unncessary double quotes
    around the value ("0x8CFBAB7B5B82D8E" -> 0x8CFBAB7B5B82D8E).
    (GITHUB-1712) [Tomaz Muraus - @Kami]
  * [OVH] Add new driver for OVH Storage based on the S3 compatible storage endpoints.
  * (GITHUB-1732) [Olivier Picquenot - @pcqnt]

Wed Sep  7 02:58:46 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- update to 3.6.0
  Compute
  * [OpenStack] Fix error attaching/detaching a Floating IP to an OpenStack node when
    ex_force_microversion is set with 2.44 or newer microversion.
  * (GITHUB-1674) [Miguel Caballer - @micafer]
  * [OpenStack] Error in volume api calls if microversion is set in OpenStack. In previous
    version if ex_force_microversion is set, it is assumed to set it to the compute service.
    Now if only a version is set 2.67, compute service is assumed but it can be also set the service name volume 3.21.
  * (GITHUB-1675) [Miguel Caballer - @micafer]
  * [OpenStack] Fix error creating and getting node in OpenStack when ex_force_microversion is set to a version newer than 2.47.
  * (GITHUB-1672) [Miguel Caballer - @micafer]
  * [EC2] Add support for new af-south-1 region. (GITHUB-1688) [Balazs Baranyi - @balazsbaranyi]
  * [SSH] Update deploy node and ParamikoSSHClient related code so it works with paramiko >= 2.9.0
    and older OpenSSH server versions which doesn't support SHA-2 variants of RSA key verification algorithm.
  * paramiko v2.9.0 introduced a change to prefer SHA-2 variants of RSA key verification algorithm.
    With this version paramiko would fail to connect to older OpenSSH servers which don't support this
    algorithm (e.g. default setup on Ubuntu 14.04) and throw authentication error.
  * The code has been updated to be backward compatible. It first tries to connect to the server
    using default preferred algorithm values and in case this fails, it will fall back to the old approach
    with SHA-2 variants disabled.
  * This functionality can be disabled by setting LIBCLOUD_PARAMIKO_SHA2_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY``environment
    variable to ``false.
  * For security reasons (to prevent possible downgrade attacks and similar) you are encouraged to do that
    in case you know you won't be connecting to any old OpenSSH servers. [Tomaz Muraus]
  Storage
  * [Google Storage] Fix public objects retrieval. In some scenarios, Google doesn't return etag header in the
    response (e.g. for gzip content encoding). The code has been updated to take this into account and not
    throw if the header is not present.
  * (GITHUB-1682, GITHUB-1683) [Veith Röthlingshöfer - @RunOrVeith]
  * [Azure Blobs] Add support for authenticating with Azure AD by passing auth_type="azureAd" argument to the driver constructor.
  * (GITHUB-1663) [Brooke White - @brookewhite9]
  DNS
  * [GoDaddy] Fix list_zones() method so it doesn't throw if an item is missing expires attribute. (GITHUB-1681) [Dave Grenier - @livegrenier]
  Container
  * [Kubernetes] Various improvements in the driver - implement list methods for nodes, services, deployments,
    node/pod metrics, add more fields to Pods and Containers, rename clusters to namespaces, add type annotations.
  * (GITHUB-1667) [Dimitris Galanis - @dimgal1]
  Other
  * Test code has been updated to utilize stdlib unittest.mock module instead of 3rd party PyPi mock package.
  * (GITHUG-1684) Reported by @pgajdos.

- Update to 3.3.1:

  * Compute
    + [EC2] Fix a regression introduced in v3.3.0 which would break EC2 driver for some regions because the driver would incorrectly try to use signature version 2 for all the regions whereas some newer regions require signature version 4 to be used.

      If you are unable to upgrade, you can use the following workaround, as long as you only use code which supports / works with authentication signature algorithm version 4:

      import libcloud.common.aws
      libcloud.common.aws.DEFAULT_SIGNATURE_VERSION = "4"

      # Instantiate affected driver here...

      Reported by @olegrtecno. (GITHUB-1545, GITHUB-1546)

    + [EC2] Allow user to override which signature algorithm version is used for authentication by passing signature_version keyword argument to the EC2 driver constructor. (GITHUB-1546)

  * Storage
    + [Google Cloud Storage] Fix a bug and make sure we also correctly handle scenario in get_object() method when the object size is returned in x-goog-stored-content-length and not content-length header. @RunOrVeith. (GITHUB-1544, GITHUB-1547)
    + [Google Cloud Storage] Update get_object() method and ensure object.size attribute is an integer and not a string. This way it’s consistent with list_objects() method. (GITHUB-1547)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    + Optimize various code imports (remove unnecessary imports, make some lazy, etc.), so now importing most of the modules is around ~20-40% faster (~70 vs ~140 ms) and in some cases such as EC2 driver even more.
    + Now majority of the import time is spent in importing requests library. (GITHUB-1519) [Tomaz Muraus]

- updated to 0.12.1
- Changes with Apache Libcloud 0.12.1:
    - Deprecate LazyList method of iteration over large paginated collections
      and use a new, more efficient generator based approach which doesn't
      require the iterator to be pre-exhausted and buffering all of the values
      in memory.

      Existing list_* methods which previously used LazyList class are
      preserving the old behavior and new iterate_* methods which use a new
      generator based approach have been added. (LIBCLOUD-254)
      [Mahendra M]

    - Replace old ENUM style provider constants and replace them with a string
      version.
      This change allows users to dynamically register new drivers using a new
      set_driver method. (LIBCLOUD-255)
      [Mahendra M]

    - Allow user to explicitly specify which CA file is used for verifying
      the server certificate by setting 'SSL_CERT_FILE' environment variable.

      Note: When this variable is specified, the specified path is the only
      CA file which is used to verifying the server certificate. (LIBCLOUD-283)
      [Tomaz Muraus, Erinn Looney-Triggs]

    - Add a common module (libcloud.common.xmlrpc) for handling XML-RPC
      requests using Libcloud http layer.

      Also refactor existing drivers which use xmlrpclib directly (VCL, Gandi,
      Softlayer) to use this module.

      This change allows drivers to support LIBCLOUD_DEBUG and SSL certificate
      validation functionality. Previously they have bypassed Libcloud http
      layer so this functionality was not available. (LIBCLOUD-288)
      [John Carr]

    - Fix string interpolation bug in __repr__ methods in the IBM SCE driver.
      (LIBCLOUD-242)
      [Tomaz Muraus]

      - changes in xmlrpc module
      (LIBCLOUD-245)
      [Tomaz Muraus]

    - Improvements and additions in vCloud driver:
      - Expose generic query method (ex_query)
      - Provide functionality to get and set control access for vApps. This way
        created vApps can be shared between users/groups or everyone.
