- update to 1.58:
  *  Fixing a performance regression in v1.54 in Python 2, using cPickle again.

  *  Pin Six version to >= 1.4
  *  setup.py build process pulls version from memcached.py
  *  delete() and delete_multi() now default the "time" argument to None,

- Update to 1.54:
   *  Numerous patches to attempt to get Python 3 working, but
      tests are still failing under Python 3, so this code is not ready
      yet.
   *  MemcachedKeyCharacterError better describes key problem.
      Suggested by Roy Smith
   *  Added touch(), patch by erankor on github.
   *  Allow empty server list, patch by zewt on github.
   *  If unknown flags in get request, raises a value error rather than the
      code bombing out.
   *  Setting the SERVER_MAX_* values after import did not work, despite
      being documented to.  Reported by alexf101 on github.

- update to 1.53:
  *  Fixing set_multi() so that if the server closes the connection
     it will no longer raise AttributeError.  Issue found and resolution
     reviewed by Ben Hoyt.
  *  readline() now will mark the connection dead if the read fails.
     It was just closing it before.  This is related to the set_multi()
     change but worth noting separately.  Thanks to Ben Hoyt.
  *  Changing check_keys to use re.match() instead of str.translate(),
     because re.match() works with Python < 2.6.
     Found by Giovanni Di Milia.

Mon May 27 10:30:36 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.51:
  *  Add a MANIFEST.in file, patch by Daniel Widerin.
  *  Client() now takes a "check_keys" option, which defaults to True.
     If False, it disables the checking of keys to ensure they have
     acceptable size and are composed of non-control characters.
     Suggested by Ben Hoyt.
  *  Converting control character checking of keys based on performance
     testing of alternatives by Ben Hoyt.
  *  Converted unicode tests from using u'', patch from Eren Güve.
  *  Included license file (pull request by "Philippe" pombredanne).
  *  Doing a "set" after server goes away, raised AttributeError:
     'NoneType' object has no attribute 'sendall'.  Patch by Ken Lalonde
  *  incr/decr return None instead of 0 on server connection failure.
     Suggested by Ivan Virabyan
  *  Supports IPv6 connections using: "inet6:[fd00::32:19f7]:11000".

- python-memcached 1.47
  * Bug #680359: useOldServerHashFunction() is broken. It now 
    correctly switches back to the old memcache hash function.

- python-memcached 1.46
  * Bug #471727: Changed the delete() code to explicitly check for
    both NOT_FOUND and DELETED as the responses and return
    successful for both. It also logs an error if one of these two
    responses is not found. Also added a test to ensure that
    delete() works.
  * When using set_multi and one value is too big, traceback
    TypeError: 'int' object is unsubscriptable.
    Patch by Orjan Persson
  * Fixing Bug #529855: Server host can now be bare host without
    ":<port>". Fix proposed by Roger Binns.
  * Fixing Bug #491164: Typo fix, "compession" -> "compRession".
  * Fixing Bug #509712: "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is
    unsubscriptable" Also fixed some other similar code to not have
    issues with that.
  * Also related to 509712 and 628339: readline() now returns ''
    instead of None when a server dies. This should be safer.
    Patch suggested by Denis Otkidach.
  * Fixing Bug #628339: Read from server sometimes fails.
    Patch by Jeremy Cowles.
  * Fixing Bug #633553: Add stat arguments support to get_stats().
    Patch by Ryan Lane.
  * Changing the license to the PSF License.
  * Removing Evan's e-mail address at his request, changing
    authorship to Sean.
