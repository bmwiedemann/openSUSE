- update to version 1.11.5
  * CVE-2017-12794: Possible XSS in traceback section of technical 500 debug page
  * Fixed GEOS version parsing if the version has a commit hash at the end (new
    in GEOS 3.6.2) (:ticket:`28441`).
  * Added compatibility for ``cx_Oracle`` 6 (:ticket:`28498`).
  * Fixed select widget rendering when option values are tuples (:ticket:`28502`).
  * Django 1.11 inadvertently changed the sequence and trigger naming scheme on
    Oracle. This causes errors on INSERTs for some tables if
    ``'use_returning_into': False`` is in the ``OPTIONS`` part of ``DATABASES``.
    The pre-1.11 naming scheme is now restored. Unfortunately, it necessarily
    requires an update to Oracle tables created with Django 1.11.[1-4]. Use the
    upgrade script in :ticket:`28451` comment 8 to update sequence and trigger
    names to use the pre-1.11 naming scheme.
  * Added POST request support to ``LogoutView``, for equivalence with the
    function-based ``logout()`` view (:ticket:`28513`).
  * Omitted ``pages_per_range`` from ``BrinIndex.deconstruct()`` if it's ``None``
    (:ticket:`25809`).
  * Fixed a regression where ``SelectDateWidget`` localized the years in the
    select box (:ticket:`28530`).
  * Fixed a regression in 1.11.4 where ``runserver`` crashed with non-Unicode
    system encodings on Python 2 + Windows (:ticket:`28487`).
  * Fixed a regression in Django 1.10 where changes to a ``ManyToManyField``
    weren't logged in the admin change history (:ticket:`27998`) and prevented
    ``ManyToManyField`` initial data in model forms from being affected by
    subsequent model changes (:ticket:`28543`).
  * Fixed non-deterministic results or an ``AssertionError`` crash in some
    queries with multiple joins (:ticket:`26522`).
  * Fixed a regression in ``contrib.auth``'s ``login()`` and ``logout()`` views
    where they ignored positional arguments (:ticket:`28550`).

    If-None-Match checks to always return HTTP 200 (#26024).
  * Fixed a regression that caused the &quot;user-tools&quot; items to display
    on the admin's logout page (#26035).
  * Fixed a crash in the translations system when the current language
    has no translations (#26046).
  * Fixed a regression that caused the incorrect day to be selected
    when opening the admin calendar widget for timezones from GMT+0100
    to GMT+1200 (#24980).
  * Fixed a regression in the admin's edit related model popup that
    caused an escaped value to be displayed in the select dropdown of

  * Fixed a regression in 1.8.8 causing incorrect index handling in
    migrations on PostgreSQL when adding db_index=True or unique=True
    to a CharField or TextField that already had the other specified,
    or when removing one of them from a field that had both, or when
    adding unique=True to a field already listed in unique_together
    (#26034).
  * Fixed a regression where defining a relation on an abstract
    model's field using a string model name without an app_label no
    longer resolved that reference to the abstract model's app if
    using that model in another application (#25858).
  * Fixed a crash when destroying an existing test database on MySQL
    or PostgreSQL (#26096).
  * Fixed CSRF cookie check on POST requests when
    USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT=True (#26094).
  * Fixed a QuerySet.order_by() crash when ordering by a relational
    field of a ManyToManyField through model (#26092).
  * Fixed a regression that caused an exception when making database
    queries on SQLite with more than 2000 parameters when DEBUG is
    True on distributions that increase the SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER
    compile-time limit to over 2000, such as Debian (#26063).
  * Fixed a crash when using a reverse OneToOneField in

    migrations disabled using the MIGRATION_MODULES setting (#26135).
  * Restored the ability for testing and debugging tools to determine
    the template from which a node came from, even during template
    inheritance or inclusion. Prior to Django 1.9, debugging tools
    could access the template origin from the node via
    Node.token.source[0]. This was an undocumented, private API. The
    origin is now available directly on each node using the
    Node.origin attribute (#25848).
  * Fixed a regression in Django 1.8.5 that broke copying a
    SimpleLazyObject with copy.copy() (#26122).

    TextField respectively when using AlterField on PostgreSQL
    (#25412).
  * Fixed admin’s delete confirmation page’s summary counts of related
    objects (#25883).
  * Added from __future__ import unicode_literals to the default
    apps.py created by startapp on Python 2 (#25909). Add this line to
    your own apps.py files created using Django 1.9 if you want your
    migrations to work on both Python 2 and Python 3.
  * Prevented QuerySet.delete() from crashing on MySQL when querying
    across relations.
  * Fixed evaluation of zero-length slices of QuerySet.values()
    (#25894).

  Security issues:
  * Denial-of-service possibility with strip_tags()
  * Mitigated possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs
  Bugfixes:
  * Fixed renaming of classes in migrations where renaming a subclass would
    cause incorrect state to be recorded for objects that referenced the
    superclass (#24354).
  * Stopped writing migration files in dry run mode when merging migration
    conflicts. When makemigrations --merge is called with verbosity=3 the
    migration file is written to stdout (:ticket: 24427).
- Update to Djano 1.7.6:
  Bugfixes
  * Mitigated an XSS attack via properties in
    &quot;ModelAdmin.readonly_fields&quot;
  * Fixed crash when coercing &quot;ManyRelatedManager&quot; to a string
    (#24352).
  * Fixed a bug that prevented migrations from adding a foreign key
    constraint when converting an existing field to a foreign key
    (#24447).
- Update to Django 1.7.5:
  Bugfixes
  * Reverted a fix that prevented a migration crash when unapplying
    contrib.contenttypes's or contrib.auth's first migration (#24075)
    due to severe impact on the test performance (#24251) and problems
    in multi-database setups (#24298).
  * Fixed a regression that prevented custom fields inheriting from
    ManyToManyField from being recognized in migrations (#24236).
  * Fixed crash in contrib.sites migrations when a default database
    isn't used (#24332).
  * Added the ability to set the isolation level on PostgreSQL with
    psycopg2 &gt;= 2.4.2 (#24318). It was advertised as a new feature in
    Django 1.6 but it didn't work in practice.
  * Formats for the Azerbaijani locale (az) have been added.
- Update to Django 1.7.4:
  Bugfixes
  * Fixed a migration crash when unapplying ``contrib.contenttypes``’s
    or ``contrib.auth``’s first migration (:ticket:`24075`).
  * Made the migration's ``RenameModel`` operation rename
    ``ManyToManyField`` tables (:ticket:`24135`).
  * Fixed a migration crash on MySQL when migrating from a
    ``OneToOneField`` to a ``ForeignKey`` (:ticket:`24163`).
  * Prevented the ``static.serve`` view from producing
    ``ResourceWarning``\s in certain circumstances (security fix
    regression, :ticket:`24193`).
  * Fixed schema check for ManyToManyField to look for internal type
    instead of checking class instance, so you can write custom
    m2m-like fields with the same behavior. (:ticket:`24104`).
- Update to Django 1.7.3:
  Security fixes:
  * WSGI header spoofing via underscore/dash conflation.
  * Mitigated possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs.
  * Denial-of-service attack against django.views.static.serve.
  * Database denial-of-service with ModelMultipleChoiceField.
  Bug fixes:
  * The default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher has been
    increased by 25%. This part of the normal major release process was
    inadvertently omitted in 1.7. This backwards compatible change will not
    affect users who have subclassed
    django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher to change the default
    value.
  * Fixed a crash in the CSRF middleware when handling non-ASCII referer 
    header (#23815).
  * Fixed a crash in the django.contrib.auth.redirect_to_login view when 
    passing a reverse_lazy() result on Python 3 (#24097).
  * Added correct formats for Greek (el) (#23967).
  * Fixed a migration crash when unapplying a migration where multiple 
    operations interact with the same model (#24110).
- South has been merged in main Django; provide and obsolete it
- Update to Django 1.7.2:
  * Fixed migration’s renaming of auto-created many-to-many tables
    when changing Meta.db_table (#23630).
  * Fixed a migration crash when adding an explicit id field to a
    model on SQLite (#23702).
  * Added a warning for duplicate models when a module is
    reloaded. Previously a RuntimeError was raised every time two
    models clashed in the app registry. (#23621).
  * Prevented flush from loading initial data for migrated apps
    (#23699).
  * Fixed a makemessages regression in 1.7.1 when STATIC_ROOT has the
    default None value (#23717).
  * Added GeoDjango compatibility with mysqlclient database driver.
  * Fixed MySQL 5.6+ crash with GeometryFields in migrations (#23719).
  * Fixed a migration crash when removing a field that is referenced
    in AlterIndexTogether or AlterUniqueTogether (#23614).
  * Updated the first day of the week in the Ukrainian locale to
    Monday.
  * Added support for transactional spatial metadata initialization on
    SpatiaLite 4.1+ (#23152).
  * Fixed a migration crash that prevented changing a nullable field
    with a default to non-nullable with the same default (#23738).
  * Fixed a migration crash when adding GeometryFields with blank=True
    on PostGIS (#23731).
  * Allowed usage of DateTimeField() as Transform.output_field
    (#23420).
  * Fixed a migration serializing bug involving float(&quot;nan&quot;) and
    float(&quot;inf&quot;) (#23770).
  * Fixed a regression where custom form fields having a queryset
    attribute but no limit_choices_to could not be used in a ModelForm
    (#23795).
  * Fixed a custom field type validation error with MySQL backend when
    db_type returned None (#23761).
  * Fixed a migration crash when a field is renamed that is part of an
    index_together (#23859).
  * Fixed squashmigrations to respect the --no-optimize parameter
    (#23799).
  * Made RenameModel reversible (#22248)
  * Avoided unnecessary rollbacks of migrations from other apps when
    migrating backwards (#23410).
  * Fixed a rare query error when using deeply nested subqueries
    (#23605).
  * Fixed a crash in migrations when deleting a field that is part of
    a index/unique_together constraint (#23794).
  * Fixed django.core.files.File.__repr__() when the file’s name
    contains Unicode characters (#23888).
  * Added missing context to the admin’s delete_selected view that
    prevented custom site header, etc. from appearing (#23898).
  * Fixed a regression with dynamically generated inlines and allowed
    field references in the admin (#23754).
  * Fixed an infinite loop bug for certain cyclic migration
    dependencies, and made the error message for cyclic dependencies
    much more helpful.
  * Added missing index_together handling for SQLite (#23880).
  * Fixed a crash when RunSQL SQL content was collected by the schema
    editor, typically when using sqlmigrate (#23909).
  * Fixed a regression in contrib.admin add/change views which caused
    some ModelAdmin methods to receive the incorrect obj value
    (#23934).
  * Fixed runserver crash when socket error message contained Unicode
    characters (#23946).
  * Fixed serialization of type when adding a deconstruct() method
    (#23950).
  * Prevented the SessionAuthenticationMiddleware from setting a
    &quot;Vary: Cookie&quot; header on all responses (#23939).
  * Fixed a crash when adding blank=True to TextField() on MySQL
    (#23920).
  * Fixed index creation by the migration infrastructure, particularly
    when dealing with PostgreSQL specific {text|varchar}_pattern_ops
    indexes (#23954).
  * Fixed bug in makemigrations that created broken migration files
    when dealing with multiple table inheritance and inheriting from
    more than one model (#23956).
  * Fixed a crash when a MultiValueField has invalid data (#23674).
  * Fixed a crash in the admin when using “Save as new” and also
    deleting a related inline (#23857).
  * Always converted related_name to text (unicode), since that is
    required on Python 3 for interpolation. Removed conversion of
    related_name to text in migration deconstruction (#23455 and
    #23982).
  * Enlarged the sizes of tablespaces which are created by default for
    testing on Oracle (the main tablespace was increased from 200M to
    300M and the temporary tablespace from 100M to 150M). This was
    required to accommodate growth in Django’s own test suite
    (#23969).
  * Fixed timesince filter translations in Korean (#23989).
  * Fixed the SQLite SchemaEditor to properly add defaults in the
    absence of a user specified default. For example, a CharField with
    blank=True didn’t set existing rows to an empty string which
    resulted in a crash when adding the NOT NULL constraint (#23987).
  * makemigrations no longer prompts for a default value when adding
    TextField() or CharField() without a default (#23405).
  * Fixed a migration crash when adding order_with_respect_to to a
    table with existing rows (#23983).
  * Restored the pre_migrate signal if all apps have migrations
    (#23975).
  * Made admin system checks run for custom AdminSites (#23497).
  * Ensured the app registry is fully populated when unpickling
    models. When an external script (like a queueing infrastructure)
    reloads pickled models, it could crash with an AppRegistryNotReady
    exception (#24007).
  * Added quoting to field indexes in the SQL generated by migrations
    to prevent a crash when the index name requires it (##24015).
  * Added datetime.time support to migrations questioner (#23998).
  * Fixed admindocs crash on apps installed as eggs (#23525).
  * Changed migrations autodetector to generate an AlterModelOptions
    operation instead of DeleteModel and CreateModel operations when
    changing Meta.managed. This prevents data loss when changing
    managed from False to True and vice versa (#24037).
  * Enabled the sqlsequencereset command on apps with migrations
    (#24054).
  * Added tablespace SQL to apps with migrations (#24051).
  * Corrected contrib.sites default site creation in a multiple
    database setup (#24000).
  * Restored support for objects that aren’t str or bytes in
    mark_for_escaping() on Python 3.
  * Supported strings escaped by third-party libraries with the
    __html__ convention in the template engine (#23831).
  * Prevented extraneous DROP DEFAULT SQL in migrations (#23581).
  * Restored the ability to use more than five levels of subqueries
    (#23758).
  * Fixed crash when ValidationError is initialized with a
    ValidationError that is initialized with a dictionary (#24008).
  * Prevented a crash on apps without migrations when running migrate
    --list (#23366).
- Update to Django 1.7.1
  * Allowed related many-to-many fields to be referenced in the admin
    (#23604).
  * Added a more helpful error message if you try to migrate an app
    without first creating the contenttypes table (#22411).
  * Modified migrations dependency algorithm to avoid possible
    infinite recursion.
  * Fixed a UnicodeDecodeError when the flush error message contained
    Unicode characters (#22882).
  * Reinstated missing CHECK SQL clauses which were omitted on some
    backends when not using migrations (#23416).
  * Fixed serialization of type objects in migrations (#22951).
  * Allowed inline and hidden references to admin fields (#23431).
  * The @deconstructible decorator now fails with a ValueError if the
    decorated object cannot automatically be imported (#23418).
  * Fixed a typo in an inlineformset_factory() error message that
    caused a crash (#23451).
  * Restored the ability to use ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES with the
    'auth.User' model (#11775). As a side effect, the setting now adds
    a get_absolute_url() method to any model that appears in
    ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES but doesn’t define get_absolute_url().
  * Avoided masking some ImportError exceptions during application
    loading (#22920).
  * Empty index_together or unique_together model options no longer
    results in infinite migrations (#23452).
  * Fixed crash in contrib.sitemaps if lastmod returned a date rather
    than a datetime (#23403).
  * Allowed migrations to work with app_labels that have the same last
    part (e.g. django.contrib.auth and vendor.auth) (#23483).
  * Restored the ability to deepcopy F objects (#23492).
  * Formats for Welsh (cy) and several Chinese locales (zh_CN,
    zh_Hans, zh_Hant and zh_TW) have been added. Formats for
    Macedonian have been fixed (trailing dot removed, #23532).
  * Added quoting of constraint names in the SQL generated by
    migrations to prevent crash with uppercase characters in the name
    (#23065).
  * Fixed renaming of models with a self-referential many-to-many
    field (ManyToManyField('self')) (#23503).
  * Added the get_extra(), get_max_num(), and get_min_num() hooks to
    GenericInlineModelAdmin (#23539).
  * Made migrations.RunSQL no longer require percent sign
    escaping. This is now consistent with cursor.execute() (#23426).
  * Made the SERIALIZE entry in the TEST dictionary usable (#23421).
  * Fixed bug in migrations that prevented foreign key constraints to
    unmanaged models with a custom primary key (#23415).
  * Added SchemaEditor for MySQL GIS backend so that spatial indexes
    will be created for apps with migrations (#23538).
  * Added SchemaEditor for Oracle GIS backend so that spatial metadata
    and indexes will be created for apps with migrations (#23537).
  * Coerced the related_name model field option to unicode during
    migration generation to generate migrations that work with both
    Python 2 and 3 (#23455).
  * Fixed MigrationWriter to handle builtin types without imports
    (#23560).
  * Fixed deepcopy on ErrorList (#23594).
  * Made the admindocs view to browse view details check if the view
    specified in the URL exists in the URLconf. Previously it was
    possible to import arbitrary packages from the Python path. This
    was not considered a security issue because admindocs is only
    accessible to staff users (#23601).
  * Fixed UnicodeDecodeError crash in AdminEmailHandler with non-ASCII
    characters in the request (#23593).
  * Fixed missing get_or_create and update_or_create on related
    managers causing IntegrityError (#23611).
  * Made urlsafe_base64_decode() return the proper type (byte string)
    on Python 3 (#23333).
  * makemigrations can now serialize timezone-aware values (#23365).
  * Added a prompt to the migrations questioner when removing the null
    constraint from a field to prevent an IntegrityError on existing
    NULL rows (#23609).
  * Fixed generic relations in ModelAdmin.list_filter (#23616).
  * Restored RFC compliance for the SMTP backend on Python 3 (#23063).
  * Fixed a crash while parsing cookies containing invalid content
    (#23638).
  * The system check framework now raises error models.E020 when the
    class method Model.check() is unreachable (#23615).
  * Made the Oracle test database creation drop the test user in the
    event of an unclean exit of a previous test run (#23649).
  * Fixed makemigrations to detect changes to Meta.db_table (#23629).
  * Fixed a regression when feeding the Django test client with an
    empty data string (#21740).
  * Fixed a regression in makemessages where static files were
    unexpectedly ignored (#23583).
- Update to Django 1.7
  * A new built-in database migration system. Notes on upgrading from
    South (a popular third*party application providing migration
    functionality) are also available.
  * A refactored concept of Django applications. Django applications
    are no longer tied to the existence of a models files, and can now
    specify both configuration data and code to be executed as Django
    starts up.
  * Improvements to the model Field API to support migrations and, in
    the future, to enable easy addition of composite-key support to
    Django's ORM.
  * Improvements for custom Manager and QuerySet classes, allowing
    reverse relationship traversal to specify the Manager to use, and
    creation of a Manager from a custom QuerySet class.
  * An extensible system check framework which can assist developers
    in detecting and diagnosing errors.
  Please refer to the release notes for all details and migration
  instructions:
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/releases/1.7/
- Added python-setuptools as a BuildRequires.
- Fixed Source URL from Django Project site.
- Reordered sources.
- Fixed deduplication to avoid wrong mtimes in pyc files.
- Rename rpmlintrc to %{name}-rpmlintrc.
  Follow the packaging guidelines.
- Update to version 1.6.5, sercurity and important changes:
  + Unexpected code execution using reverse()
  + Caching of anonymous pages could reveal CSRF token
  + MySQL typecasting
  + select_for_update() requires a transaction
  + Issue: Caches may incorrectly be allowed to store and serve private data
  + Issue: Malformed redirect URLs from user input not correctly validated
