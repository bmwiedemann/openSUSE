      - Fix for RT#128243, where touching a file in close succession wouldn't
        register the second one for make & other purposes, on systems that
        have finer granularity than seconds. Thanks to Slaven Rezic for
        the suggested fix.
      - Improved opening paragraphs of the DESCRIPTION, including a suggestion
        to always require 0.12 or higher.

      - Time::HiRes doesn't provide utime() on Windows, so now we try and
        load Time::HiRes in a BEGIN block, and only enforce the min version
        if it loaded ok.
  0.11_02 2021-03-18 NEILB
      - Looks like I should have specified a min version of
        Time::HiRes. Was getting some fails from CPAN Testers,
        about utime() not being available.

      - Try Slaven's suggested fix for RT#128243
