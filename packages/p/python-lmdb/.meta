  <title>Universal Python binding for the LMDB 'Lightning' Database</title>
  <description>This is a universal Python binding for the LMDB 'Lightning' Database.

LMDB is a tiny database with the following properties:
  * Ordered map interface (keys are always lexicographically sorted).
  * Reader/writer transactions: readers don’t block writers, writers don’t block readers. Each environment supports one concurrent write transaction.
  * Cheap read transactions.
  * Environments may be opened by multiple processes on the same host.
  * Multiple named databases may be created with transactions covering all named databases.
  * Memory mapped, allowing for zero copy lookup and iteration. This is optionally exposed to Python using the buffer() interface.
  * Maintenance requires no external process or background threads.
  * No application-level caching is required: LMDB uses the operating system’s buffer cache.</description>
