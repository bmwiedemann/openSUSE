  <title>Python bindings to FreeDesktoporg Secret Service API</title>
  <description>This module provides a way for securely storing passwords and other secrets.

It uses D-Bus `Secret Service`_ API that is supported by GNOME Keyring
(since version 2.30) and KSecretsService.

The main classes provided are ``secretstorage.Item``, representing a secret
item (that has a *label*, a *secret* and some *attributes*) and
``secretstorage.Collection``, a place items are stored in.

SecretStorage supports most of the functions provided by Secret Service,
including creating and deleting items and collections, editing items,
locking and unlocking collections (asynchronous unlocking is also supported).

The documentation can be found on `pythonhosted.org`_.
