    <comment>- Update to 10.4:
  https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1851/
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/release-10-4.html
  A dump/restore is not required for those running 10.X.
  However, if you use the adminpack extension, you should update
  it as per the first changelog entry below.
  Also, if the function marking mistakes mentioned in the second
  and third changelog entries below affect you, you will want to
  take steps to correct your database catalogs.
  * CVE-2018-1115, bsc#1091610: Remove public execute privilege
    from contrib/adminpack's pg_logfile_rotate() function
    pg_logfile_rotate() is a deprecated wrapper for the core
    function pg_rotate_logfile(). When that function was changed
    to rely on SQL privileges for access control rather than a
    hard-coded superuser check, pg_logfile_rotate() should have
    been updated as well, but the need for this was missed. Hence,
    if adminpack is installed, any user could request a logfile
    rotation, creating a minor security issue.
    After installing this update, administrators should update
    adminpack by performing ALTER EXTENSION adminpack UPDATE in
    each database in which adminpack is installed.
  * Fix incorrect volatility markings on a few built-in functions
  * Fix incorrect parallel-safety markings on a few built-in
    functions.</comment>

- bsc#1091412: server prerequires server-noarch to make sure that
  the postgresql user and group exist.
- Update to 10.3
  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/release-10-3.html
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 10.X.
    However, if you run an installation in which not all users are
    mutually trusting, or if you maintain an application or
    extension that is intended for use in arbitrary situations, it
    is strongly recommended that you read the documentation changes
    described in the first changelog entry in the link above, and
    take suitable steps to ensure that your installation or code is
    secure.
    Also, the changes described in the second changelog entry in
    the link above may cause functions used in index expressions or
    materialized views to fail during auto-analyze, or when
    reloading from a dump. After upgrading, monitor the server logs
    for such problems, and fix affected functions.
  * CVE-2018-1058 bsc#1081925 Uncontrolled search path element in
    pg_dump and other client applications
- Update to PostgreSQL 10.2
  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10-2.html
  * CVE-2018-1052, bsc#1080253: Fix processing of partition keys
    containing multiple expressions.
  * CVE-2018-1053, bsc#1077983: Ensure that all temporary files
    made by pg_upgrade are non-world-readable.
  * bsc#1079757: Rename pg_rewind's copy_file_range function to
    avoid conflict with new Linux system call of that name.
- Use Python 3 for building PL/Python (boo#1067699).
- Don't %config the symlinks to /etc/alternatives to avoid rpmlint
  warnings.
- also package %define pgcontribdir %pgdatadir/contrib
- enable support for ICU (new BR: libicu-devel)
- enable support for selinux (new BR: libselinux-devel)
- enable support for systemd (new BR: pkgconfig(libsystemd))
- make sure that also the server gets at least its own version of
  libpq5
- also change all libpq requires to &gt;= %version instead of just
  %pgmajor
- port /usr/share/postgresql/install-alternatives usage to the new
  scheme
- update to 10.1
  * Security Issues
    - CVE-2017-15098: Memory disclosure in JSON functions
    - CVE-2017-15099: INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE fails to
      enforce SELECT privileges
      Prior to this release, the &quot;INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE&quot;
      would not check to see if the executing user had permission
      to perform a &quot;SELECT&quot; on the index performing the conflicting
      check. Additionally, in a table with row-level security
      enabled, the &quot;INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE&quot; would not
      check the SELECT policies for that table before performing
      the update.
      This fix ensures that &quot;INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE&quot;
      checks against table permissions and RLS policies before
      executing.
  * Bug Fixes and Improvements
    This update also fixes a number of bugs reported in the last
    few months. Some of these issues affect only version 10, but
    many affect all supported versions:
    - Fix a race condition in BRIN indexing that could cause some
      rows to not be included in the indexing.
    - Fix crash when logical decoding is invoked from a PL language
      function.
    - Several fixes for logical replication.
    - Restored behavior for CTEs attached to INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
      statements to pre-version 10.
    - Prevent low-probability crash in processing of nested trigger
      firings.
    - Do not evaluate an aggregate function's argument expressions
      when the conditions in the FILTER clause evaluate to FALSE.
      This complies with SQL-standard behavior.
    - Fix incorrect query results when multiple GROUPING SETS
      columns contain the same simple variable.
    - Fix memory leak over the lifespan of a query when evaluating
      a set-returning function from the target list in a SELECT.
    - Several fixes for parallel query execution, including fixing
      a crash in the parallel execution of certain queries that
      contain a certain type of bitmap scan.
    - Fix json_build_array(), json_build_object(),
      jsonb_build_array(), and jsonb_build_object() to handle
      explicit VARIADIC arguments correctly.
    - Prevent infinite float values from being casted to the
      numeric type.
    - Fix autovacuum's “work item” logic to prevent possible
      crashes and silent loss of work items.
    - Several fixes for VIEWs around adding columns to the end of a
      view.
    - Fix for hashability detection of range data types that are
      created by a user.
    - Improvements on using extended statistics on columns for the
      purposes of query planning.
    - Prevent idle_in_transaction_session_timeout from being
      ignored when a statement_timeout occurred earlier.
    - Fix low-probability loss of NOTIFY messages due more than 2
      billion transactions processing before any queries are
      executed in the session.
    - Several file system interaction fixes.
    - Correctly restore the umask setting when file creation fails
      in COPY or lo_export().
    - Fix pg_dump to ensure that it emits GRANT commands in a valid
      order.
    - Fix pg_basebackup's matching of tablespace paths to
      canonicalize both paths before comparing to help improve
      Windows compatibility.
    - Fix libpq to not require user's home directory to exist when
      trying to read the &quot;~/.pgpass&quot; file.
    - Several fixes for ecpg.
    - This update also contains tzdata release 2017c, with updates
      for Fiji, Namibia, Northern Cyprus, Sudan, Tonga, and Turks &amp;
      Caicos Islands, plus historical corrections for Alaska,
      Apia, Burma, Calcutta, Detroit, Ireland, Namibia, and Pago
      Pago.
  For more details see:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/release-10-1.html
- Use /usr/share/postgresql/install-alternatives in the respective
  scriptlets.
- Fix the logic around restart on upgrade and stop on removal.
  We bring the binaries, but we don't own the unit file.
- Update to the final 10.0 release. Major enhancements include:
  * Logical replication using publish/subscribe
  * Declarative table partitioning
  * Improved query parallelism
  * Significant general performance improvements
  * Stronger password authentication based on SCRAM-SHA-256
  * Improved monitoring and control
  A dump/restore using pg_dumpall, or use of pg_upgrade, is
  required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous
  release.
  Version 10 contains a number of changes that may affect
  compatibility with previous releases.
  See the release notes for details:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10.html
- Reduce the number of version-related macros in the spec file.
- Break a build dependency loop in the server packages that led to
  bootstrap problems.
- Update to 10rc1
  PostgreSQL 10 RC 1 requires an upgrade from beta 4, or earlier
  either using pg_dump / pg_restore or pg_upgrade.
  Changes since beta4 include:
  * Add psql variables showing server version and psql version.
  * Several fixes for partitioning
  * Several fixes for logical replication
  * Several fixes for transition tables
  * Fix for query that could end up in an uninterruptible state
- Adjust dependencies to the new packaging schema.
- update to 10beta4
  PostgreSQL 10 beta 4 requires an upgrade from beta 3, or earlier
  either using pg_dump / pg_restore or pg_upgrade.
  Any bugfixes applied to 9.6 or earlier that also affected 10 are
  included in beta 4. Our users and contributors also reported bugs
  against 10 beta 3, and many of them have been fixed in this
  release. We urge our community to re-test to ensure that these
  bugs are actually fixed, including:
  - Show foreign tables in information_schema.table_privileges
    view. This fix applies to new databases, see the release notes
    for the procedure to apply the fix to an existing database.
  - Clean up handling of a fatal exit (e.g., due to receipt of
    SIGTERM) that occurs while trying to execute a ROLLBACK of a
    failed transaction
  - Remove assertion that could trigger during a fatal exit
  - Correctly identify columns that are of a range type or domain
    type over a composite type or domain type being searched for
  - Prevent crash when passing fixed-length pass-by-reference data
    types to parallel worker processes
  - Fix crash in pg_restore when using parallel mode and using a
    list file to select a subset of items to restore
  - Change ecpg’s parser to allow RETURNING clauses without
    attached C variables
  - Change ecpg’s parser to recognize backslash continuation of C
    preprocessor command lines
  - Improve selection of compiler flags for PL/Perl on Windows
  - Fix make check to behave correctly when invoked via a non-GNU
    make program
  Note that some known issues remain unfixed. Before reporting a
  bug in the beta, please check the Open Items page.

    <comment>- update to 10.14:
  * CVE-2020-14349, bsc#1175193: Set a secure search_path in
    logical replication walsenders and apply workers
  * CVE-2020-14350, bsc#1175194: Make contrib modules' installation
    scripts more secure.
  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10-14.html
- Remove postgresql-regress.patch, it does not apply anymore and
  it does not seem to be needed anymore.
- Pack the /usr/lib/postgresql symlink only into the main package.

- Let postgresqlXX conflict with postgresql-noarch &lt; 12.0.1 to get
  a clean and complete cutover to the new packaging schema.

- Move from the &quot;libs&quot; build flavour to a &quot;mini&quot; package that will
  only be used inside the build service and not get shipped, to
  avoid confusion with the debuginfo packages (bsc#1148643).</comment>

    ensure that all non-overridden parameters from a previous
    connection string are re-used.
