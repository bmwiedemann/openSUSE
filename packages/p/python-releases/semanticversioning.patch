Subject: [PATCH] Fix usage of semanticversion to intended API.

The recent versions of python-semanticversion made changes to private
APIs, removing the interaction between `Version(x, partial=True)` and
`Spec()` (`partial=True` was designed for implementing the `Spec` class
only)

The code used these classes to exclude ranges of version whose major
component didn't match a bugfix/issue range; the code went akin to:

    Version('1', partial=True) in Spec('>=1.0')

This no longer works; this patch changes that behaviour to exclude
families where no actual release matches the bugfix/issue range - this
should be more accurate.

The patch also uses `Version.coerce`, the intended API to manage
non semver-compliant version strings.

The patch has been tested with both python-semanticversion==2.6.0 and
python-semanticversion==2.8.1; it can be included to an upgraded version
of `releases` even if users haven't yet upgraded python-semanticversion.
