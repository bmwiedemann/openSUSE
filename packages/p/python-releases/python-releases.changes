- Update to 1.5.0
  * Allow multiple changelog files -- releases_document_name
    may now optionally be a list of strings instead of a single string.
- Update to 1.4.2
  * We never pulled our README into our setup.py metadata,
    resulting in a rather sparse PyPI page! This has been fixed.
- Update to 1.4.1
  * Sphinx 1.7.x changed some semi-public APIs; given this is the
    second minor release in a row to do so, we're explicitly bracketing our
    ``setup.py`` dependencies to Sphinx >= 1.3 and < 1.7. We expect to bump this
    up one minor release at a time as we add compatibility back in.
- Update to 1.4.0
  * Drop Python 2.6 and 3.3 support, to correspond with earlier
    changes in Sphinx and most other public Python projects.
  * Identified a handful of issues with our Sphinx pin &
    subsequently, internal changes in Sphinx 1.6 which broke (and/or appear to
    break, such as noisy warnings) our own behavior. These have (hopefully) all
    been fixed.
- Update to 1.3.2
  * Update packaging requirements to allow for
    sphinx>=1.3,<2.
