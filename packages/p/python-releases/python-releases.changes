- Delete migrate-to-pytest.patch
- Delete remove-mock.patch
- Add remove-icecream.patch
- Update to 2.1.1:
  * [Bug]: Fix up an internal utility which monkeypatches a
    Sphinx/docutils internal, so that it accepts arbitrary args/kwargs
    instead of exploding on newer Sphinxes.
- 2.0.1:
  * [Bug]: Fix up an internal utility which monkeypatches a
    Sphinx/docutils internal, so that it accepts arbitrary args/kwargs
    instead of exploding on newer Sphinxes.
- 2.1.0:
  * [Feature]: Allow controlling the name of your development branch
    for source code links (eg “Next 1.x feature release” section
    headers) via the new releases_development_branch config option.
  * [Feature]: Add a new configuration setting,
    releases_supported_versions, allowing you to limit how many “Next
    1.x feature release” (or bugfix, etc) sections appear at the top
    of your changelog.
- 2.0.0:
  * [Bug]: Don’t make tmpdirs in releases.util.make_app when being
    given explicit directory args.
  * [Bug]: Changelog transformation sometimes failed to occur when
    running under a ‘single HTML file’ Sphinx builder (eg singlehtml),
    which resulted in ‘unknown node’ errors. This has been fixed.
  * [Support]: Migrated the test suite to use pytest-relaxed (and thus
    pytest) instead of spec.
  * [Support]: Dropped support for Sphinx <4. We tried to support
    1.8+, but too many transitive dependencies have clearly “moved on”
    and cause various cells in the test matrix to fail hard.
  * [Support]: Dropped support for Python 2.7, Python 3.4, and Python
    3.5, to align slightly better with upstream (and ecosystem) EOLs.
  * [Support]: The releases_release_uri/releases_issue_uri settings
    now allow modern (.format/f-strings) string formatting, in
    addition to the old %s-based interpolation.
  * [Support]: Administrivia overhaul: enhanced README, packaging
    metadata cleaned up/expanded, CI moved to Circle-CI, renamed dev
    branch to main, and more besides.

- remove color printout in tests

Wed Mar 18 09:08:49 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.6.3:
  - :support:`87 backported` (via :issue:`88`) Our upper Sphinx version limit was
    mostly defensive and at this point is just too old to even build on
    ReadTheDocs successfully. Removed it for the time being. Thanks to José
    Sánchez-Gallego for the nudge and the patch.
  - :support:`84 backported` Pin us to ``semantic-version<2.7`` as they changed
    their APIs (...) in that version in a way that breaks us. We do not need
    anything they've added recently, so the conservative response is to just pin
    until we truly need to upgrade. Thanks to everyone who reported and submitted
    workarounds for this.
- Drop merged patch semanticversioning.patch

- Update to 1.6.1:
  * Support sphinx 1.7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 18 14:29:58 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.5.0
  * Allow multiple changelog files -- releases_document_name
    may now optionally be a list of strings instead of a single string.
- Update to 1.4.2
  * We never pulled our README into our setup.py metadata,
    resulting in a rather sparse PyPI page! This has been fixed.
- Update to 1.4.1
  * Sphinx 1.7.x changed some semi-public APIs; given this is the
    second minor release in a row to do so, we're explicitly bracketing our
    ``setup.py`` dependencies to Sphinx >= 1.3 and < 1.7. We expect to bump this
    up one minor release at a time as we add compatibility back in.
- Update to 1.4.0
  * Drop Python 2.6 and 3.3 support, to correspond with earlier
    changes in Sphinx and most other public Python projects.
  * Identified a handful of issues with our Sphinx pin &
    subsequently, internal changes in Sphinx 1.6 which broke (and/or appear to
    break, such as noisy warnings) our own behavior. These have (hopefully) all
    been fixed.
- Update to 1.3.2
  * Update packaging requirements to allow for
    sphinx>=1.3,<2.
