- Restore semanticversioning.patch to allow semantic_version >= 2.7 
  gh#bitprophet/releases#84
  gh#bitprophet/releases#86
- remove color printout in tests

- Update to 1.6.3:
  - :support:`87 backported` (via :issue:`88`) Our upper Sphinx version limit was
    mostly defensive and at this point is just too old to even build on
    ReadTheDocs successfully. Removed it for the time being. Thanks to José
    Sánchez-Gallego for the nudge and the patch.
  - :support:`84 backported` Pin us to ``semantic-version<2.7`` as they changed
    their APIs (...) in that version in a way that breaks us. We do not need
    anything they've added recently, so the conservative response is to just pin
    until we truly need to upgrade. Thanks to everyone who reported and submitted
    workarounds for this.
- Drop merged patch semanticversioning.patch

- Update to 1.6.1:
  * Support sphinx 1.7

- Update to 1.5.0
  * Allow multiple changelog files -- releases_document_name
    may now optionally be a list of strings instead of a single string.
- Update to 1.4.2
  * We never pulled our README into our setup.py metadata,
    resulting in a rather sparse PyPI page! This has been fixed.
- Update to 1.4.1
  * Sphinx 1.7.x changed some semi-public APIs; given this is the
    second minor release in a row to do so, we're explicitly bracketing our
    ``setup.py`` dependencies to Sphinx >= 1.3 and < 1.7. We expect to bump this
    up one minor release at a time as we add compatibility back in.
- Update to 1.4.0
  * Drop Python 2.6 and 3.3 support, to correspond with earlier
    changes in Sphinx and most other public Python projects.
  * Identified a handful of issues with our Sphinx pin &
    subsequently, internal changes in Sphinx 1.6 which broke (and/or appear to
    break, such as noisy warnings) our own behavior. These have (hopefully) all
    been fixed.
- Update to 1.3.2
  * Update packaging requirements to allow for
    sphinx>=1.3,<2.
