    indicate the type and the field whose constraint failed.
- update licence to GPL-3.0-or-later

Thu May 13 08:30:21 UTC 2021 - Wang Jun <jgwang@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.2
  * User visible changes
    - The .file dot-command now supports a /c flag for creating new,
      empty files.
    - A new compiler built-in `ioflags' is available, that returns
      the flags of some given IO space.
    - Certain operations now raise a E_perm exception, instead of the
      more generic E_io.
    - A new kind of IO device is now supported: the `zero' IOD.
      Opening "<zero>" will result in an IO space covering the full
      64-bit byte range, that always returns zero on reads and that
      ignores writes.
    - Function values (closures) can now be compared at language-level.
      They are compared by pointer.
    - The compiler now rejects casts from `any' to function types
      instead of ICEing.
    - The `dump' command now doesn't try to print anything if the
      current IOS is not readable.
    - The `dump' command now prints ?? for "unknown" bytes, i.e. for bytes
      in addresses that are not readable in the underlying IO space.
    - The standard function `ltos' now gets an additional optional
      argument `base', that defaults to 10.
    - The `big' and `little' annotations can now be used in any struct
      type field, regardless of its type.
  * Bug fixes
    - A very nasty performance bottleneck in pvm_array_insert has been
      fixed.
    - Fix the opening mode of write-only files when the user doesn't
      specify explicit flags in `open'.
    - Avoid spurious EOF exceptions when writing weird integers past
      the end of an IOS.
    - Fix method `value' in leb128.pk
    - Fix ICE while compiling for-statements with several declarations.
    - Properly print > 2^32 addresses in `dump'
    - Other minor fixes.
  * Other changes
    - The JSON MI machinery has been rewriten and much improved.
    - More tests in several areas.

Tue Mar 23 16:06:33 UTC 2021 - Anton Smorodskyi <asmorodskyi@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.1
   * User visible changes
    - The IOS_F_TRUNCATE `open' flag has been removed.
    - Constraint expressions and initializers can be now
      used together in struct fields.
  * Bug fixes
    - The infamous bug preventing poke work on 32-bit systems is now
      fixed.
    - Better handling of open modes in the file IOD.
    - Improve some translatable strings.
    - poke won't raise an exception when starting if HOME
    is not defined in the environment.
    - The compiler now emits an error if it sees un-map-able
      fields in a struct type.
    - Properly handle the absence of current IOS in the map command.
    - Install Emacs modes.
    - Portability fixes for:
