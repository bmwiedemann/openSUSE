Sat Jul  6 17:25:03 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 4.2:
  * Handle `strdup' error correctly in mmap IO device.
  * developer visible fixes
  * Diagnostics for invalid casts has been improved.
  * Improve diagnostics of `.ios' command.
  * `diff_structured' function in `diff' pickle has been fixed to
    detect "simple types" correctly (types that have value
    semantics instead of reference semantics).
 * Documentation updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 31 21:15:09 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 4.1:
  * Execution speed of `pk-jojopatch' has been improved by
    disabling auto-remap feature
  * Fixes for invalid memory accesses and crashes
  * jitter submodule updated

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  2 19:38:05 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 4.0
  * Multiple updates to the user interface 
  * now acknowledges the POKE_LOAD_PATH environment variable whose
    value, if defined, gets prepended to the load_path when poke
    starts.
  * Use UID-specific socket to allow multiple instances running in
    the system
  * New utility pokefmt: simple template system
  * Support customizing the poke prompt
  * Multiple updates to the poke language
  * New pickles:
    + srec: Motorola SREC files
    + orc: ORC data - stack unwinding format in Linux
    + gcov: GCOV data (.gcda) and notes (.gcno) files
    + base64: RFC 4648
    + iscan, iscan-string: Icon-like scanning
    + gpt: GUID partition tables
    + jojodiff: JojoDiff binary patches

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 21 16:24:48 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 3.3:
  * Mapping in non-strict mode now assures that constraint
    expressions are executed, even if their result is discarded.
    This is important because very often constraint expressions
    have side effects (such as setting the current endianness) on
    which further mapping relies.
  * Bug in array promotion has been fixed.
  * A bug impacting array bounders in struct constructors has been
    fixed.
  * The return type of the builtin `iolist' has been fixed.
  * A bug impacting the re-definition of struct types at the
    top-level has been fixed.
  * Error locations were not very xprecise in a couple of
    circumstances due to a bison limitation
  * Setting values of mapped structs in strict mode now really
    check for integrity, erroing whenever necessary.
  * A bug flushing stream IO devices has been fixed.
  * The .sub dot-command now does the right thing when no name is
    specified, instead of crashing poke.
  * Pickles: The BTF pickle has been updated to support
    BTF_KIND_ENUM64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 14 11:51:52 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <Andreas.Stieger@gmx.de>

- Update to 3.2:
  * Fix value returned by the libpoke function pk_load
  * Fix a very annoying regression that resulted in a segfault when
    doing l-value maps of struct values having anonymous fields

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 17 16:53:57 UTC 2023 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.1:
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fix recognition of token 0[bB] in the lexer.
    + Do not validate and check _print* functions within struct types
      as if they were methods.  As functions, they can have any
      signature as they are no special in any way.
    + Do not emit an empty table for computed fiels in the output of
      .info type if the type has no computed fields.
    + Use tar-ustar in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.  The usage older algorithms in
      tar was causing problems when creating poke tarballs with long
      path names.
    + std.pk now provides utility functions to parse and compare poke
      versions. This is for example to be used by poke pickles in
      order to require a particular minimum version of the program.
    + poked now recognizes the short option -S.
    + poked now creates its socket with umask 0077, and it uses a more
      suitable default socket path that includes the PID of the process
      running the daemon.
    + The Poke compiler now emits proper parse errors when problems are
      found in asm templates.
    + poke will no longer abort execution in case it finds a fatal
      error in the lexer, such as memory exhaustion.
    + Casts from arrays to arrays now use the right bounder.
    + Constant folding of offset multiplication by an offset with zero
      unit is now fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 25 20:52:34 UTC 2023 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.0:
  * User interface updates
    + A screen pager has been added to the poke application.
    + A tracer has been added to libpoke and the poke application.
    + A new command sdiff (for "structured diff") has been added to the
      poke application, that provides a way to generate patchable diffs
      of mapped structured Poke values.
    + When no name is passed to the .mem command, an unique name for the
      memory IOS with the form *N* will be used automatically, where N
      is a positive integer.
    + auto-completion of 'attributes is now available in the poke
      application.
    + Constraint errors now contain details on the location (which
      field) where the constraint error happens, along with the
      particular expression that failed.
    + Inline assembler expressions and statements are now supported.
    + Both =printf= and =format= now support printing values of type
      =any=.
    + Both =printf= and =format= now support printing integral values
      interpreted as floating-point values encoded in IEEE 754.
    + Pre-conditional optional fields are added to complement the
      currently supported post-conditional optional fields.
    + A new option =.set autoremap no= can be used in order to tell poke
      to not remap mapped values automatically.
    + The :to argument to the =extract= command is now optional, and
      defaults to the empty string.
    + ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config} is now preferred to
      XDG_CONFIG_DIRS.
  * Poke Language updates
    + Array and struct constructors are now primaries in the Poke
      syntax.
    + Bit-concatenation is now supported in l-values.
    + Arrays can now be indented by size, by specifying an offset as an
      index.
    + Union types can now be declared as "integral".
    + Support for "computed fields" has been added to struct and union
      types.
    + This version introduces three new Poke attributes that work on
      values of type =any=.
    + Two new operators have been introduced to facilitate operating
      Poke array as stacks in an efficient way: apush and apop.
    + Poke programs can now hook in the IO subsystem by installing
      functions that will be invoked when certain operations on IO
      spaces are being performed.
    + The 'length attribute is now valid in values of type =any=.
    + Poke declarations can now be annotated as =immutable=.
    + A new compiler built-in =iolist= has been introduced, that returns
      an array with the IO space identifiers of currently open IOS.
    + We have changed the logic of the EXCOND operator ?!.  It now
      evaluates to 1 (true) if the execution of the first operand raises
      the specified exception, and to 0 (false) otherwise.
    + The containing struct or union value can now be refered as SELF in
      the body of methods.  SELF is of type =any=.
    + Integer literal suffixes (B, H, U, etc) are case-insensitive.
    + Casting to union types now raise a compile-time error.
    + If no explicit message is specified in calls to =assert=, a
      default one showing the source code of the failing condition is
      constructed and used instead.
    + An operator =remap= has been used in order to force a re-map of
      some mapped Poke value.
    + Signed integral types of one bit are not allowed.
    + The built-in function get_time has been renamed to gettime, to
      follow the usual naming of the corresponding standard C function.
  * Standard Poke Library updates
    + New standard functions.
    + libpoke updates
      - New API function pk_struct_ref_set_field_value.
      - New API function pk_type_name.
  * Pickles updates
    + New pickles.
    + The ELF pickle now provides functions implementing ELF hashing.
  * Build system updates
    + It is now supported to configure the poke sources with
      --disable-hserver.
  * Documentation updates
    + Documentation for the =format= language construction has been
      added to the poke manual.
  * Other updates
    + A new program poked, for "poke daemon", has been contributed to
      the poke distribution. poked links with libpoke and uses Unix
      sockets to act as a broker to communicate with an instance of a
      Poke incremental compiler.
    + The machine-interface subsystem has been removed from poke, in
      favor of the poked approach.
    + The example GUI that was intended to be a test tool for the
      machine interface has been removed from the poke distribution.
    + Many bugs have been fixed.

Thu May 13 08:30:21 UTC 2021 - Wang Jun <jgwang@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.2
  * User visible changes
    - The .file dot-command now supports a /c flag for creating new,
      empty files.
    - A new compiler built-in `ioflags' is available, that returns
      the flags of some given IO space.
    - Certain operations now raise a E_perm exception, instead of the
      more generic E_io.
    - A new kind of IO device is now supported: the `zero' IOD.
      Opening "<zero>" will result in an IO space covering the full
      64-bit byte range, that always returns zero on reads and that
      ignores writes.
    - Function values (closures) can now be compared at language-level.
      They are compared by pointer.
    - The compiler now rejects casts from `any' to function types
      instead of ICEing.
    - The `dump' command now doesn't try to print anything if the
      current IOS is not readable.
    - The `dump' command now prints ?? for "unknown" bytes, i.e. for bytes
      in addresses that are not readable in the underlying IO space.
    - The standard function `ltos' now gets an additional optional
      argument `base', that defaults to 10.
    - The `big' and `little' annotations can now be used in any struct
      type field, regardless of its type.
  * Bug fixes
    - A very nasty performance bottleneck in pvm_array_insert has been
      fixed.
    - Fix the opening mode of write-only files when the user doesn't
      specify explicit flags in `open'.
    - Avoid spurious EOF exceptions when writing weird integers past
      the end of an IOS.
    - Fix method `value' in leb128.pk
    - Fix ICE while compiling for-statements with several declarations.
    - Properly print > 2^32 addresses in `dump'
    - Other minor fixes.
  * Other changes
    - The JSON MI machinery has been rewriten and much improved.
    - More tests in several areas.
