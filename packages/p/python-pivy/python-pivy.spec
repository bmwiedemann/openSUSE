%description
Pivy is a Coin binding for Python. Coin is a high-level 3D graphics library
with a C++ Application Programming Interface. Coin uses scene-graph data
structures to render real-time graphics suitable for mostly all kinds of
scientific and engineering visualization applications.

Pivy allows:

- Development of Coin applications and extensions in Python
- Interactive modification of Coin programs from within the Python interpreter
  at runtime
- Incorporation of Scripting Nodes into the scene graph which are capable of
  executing Python code and callbacks
