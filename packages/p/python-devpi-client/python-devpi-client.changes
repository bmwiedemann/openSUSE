    environment variable for ``devpi use``.
  * Fix relative DEVPI_INDEX environment variable with user and
    index causing an invalid URL in some cases.
  * Fix persistence of username when DEVPI_INDEX environment
    variable is used with ``devpi login``.
  * Fix precedence of ``--sdist`` and ``--wheel`` over
    ``formats`` setting from setup.cfg ``[devpi:upload]``
    section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 10 09:35:55 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 6.0.3:
  * Fix #919: Retry 3 times and wait a moment on PermissionError
    during file removal to fix race condition after running tox.
  * Restore ability to build docs if project uses separate build and
    source directories for documentation.
  * Fix for changes in pypitoken 6.x.
- 6.0.2 (2022-09-28)
  * Better error message when trying to use ``devpi index`` which
    requires authentication (devpi-lockdown).
- 6.0.1 (2022-08-16)
  * fix #913: ``main.Hub.workdir`` cleanup (exit) can now handle
    read-only files (like those created by git).
  * Print info when ``DEVPI_INDEX`` environment variable is in use and
    allow relative index specification for it.
- 6.0.0 (2022-07-19)
  * Removed support for ``--detox`` option.
  * When uploading we no longer "register" the package first. That
    requirement was removed from PyPI and devpi-server for some time.
  * Use ``sphinx-build`` command instead of ``setup.py build_sphinx``
    when building documentation.
  * Removed tox dependency, instead ``devpi test`` looks for the
    ``tox`` binary in the path.
  * The ``--venv`` option will abort when no virtualenv exists at the
    location, it will not create a virtualenv anymore.
  * Fix #218: use new pip.conf location by default and warn if the
    legacy location exists.
  * Fix #38: add ``--user``/``-u`` option to ``use`` command to limit
    index listing to a specific user.
  * Fix #437: when the ``DEVPI_INDEX`` environment variable is set, it
    temporarily overwrites the current index.
  * Fix #691: allow anonymous uploads if the server has
    ``acl_upload=:ANONYMOUS:`` set on index.
  * Fix #863: allow ``--only-docs`` upload for files containing
    ``.docs.`` instead of ``.doc.`` and support gzipped tar files.
  * The ``--user/-u`` option for ``devpi use`` can be used to switch
    the current user and the authentication data of previous logins is
    preserved.
  * Use `build <https://pypi.org/project/build/>`_ package when
    possible and fall back to ``setup.py`` only for deprecated release
    types.
  * When the ``DEVPI_USER`` environment variable is set, it
    temporarily overwrites the current user name.
  * Support query strings on ``path`` for ``getjson`` command. This
    enables using ``?no_projects=``.
  * The ``devpi index -l [username]`` command now actually lists
    indexes of other users and works without login.
  * Fix #443 and #444: pass authentication info to pip via environment
    variable for ``devpi install`` and ``devpi test``.
  * When pushing to an external index with ``pypi:...``, a PyPI token
    is detected and ``pypitoken`` is installed a new unique time
    limited token is derived for the upload.
  * With ``devpi use --local`` a local configuration is created in the
    currently active virtualenv and automatically used as long as the
    virtualenv is activated.
  * Warn if the server changes the scheme, host or port during ``devpi
    use``.
  * Using ``--list`` or ``--urls`` with ``use`` command and a URL
    won't change the current index anymore.
  * Existing authentication data is validated on ``devpi use`` and
    removed if expired.
  * Fix #562: encode username and url in devpiclient_get_password with
    sys.stdout.encoding.
  * Fix #627: support ``--index`` option when no index is currently
    selected.
  * Fix #808: Use mkdtemp from Python tempfile module to prevent
    permission and locking errors during ``devpi test`` and ``devpi
    upload``.
  * Fix #831: only download matching wheels if ``--select`` is in use.
  * Give helpful error message when specified/configured virtualenv is
    missing.
  * When there is no json error message only the HTML error code and
    reason is printed now, to get the full HTML output use the
    ``--debug`` flag.
