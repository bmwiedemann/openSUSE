- Initial package:
  * Only packaged for Python 3 as this primarily provides the
    executable ntfy.
  * Source is taken from Github as the source distribution on PyPI
    lacks the tests.
  * The package suggests a couple Python packages which are
    currently not packaged for openSUSE. Given the strict naming
    convention for packaged Python packages this should be safe,
    though and magically work once those packages are made
    available.
