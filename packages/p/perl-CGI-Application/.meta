  <title>Framework for building reusable web-applications</title>
  <description>CGI::Application is intended to make it easier to create sophisticated,
reusable web-based applications.

This module implements a methodology which, if followed, will make your
web software easier to design, easier to document, easier to write, and
easier to evolve.

CGI::Application builds on standard, non-proprietary technologies and
techniques, such as the Common Gateway Interface and Lincoln D. Stein's
excellent CGI.pm module. CGI::Application judiciously avoids employing
technologies and techniques which would bind a developer to any one set
of tools, operating system or web server.</description>
