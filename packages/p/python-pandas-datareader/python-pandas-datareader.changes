- specfile:
  * remove devel from noarch
  * be more specific in %files section

- update to version 0.7.0:
  * Highlights include:
    + Immediate deprecation of Google finance and Morningstar for
      historical price data, as these API endpoints are no longer
      supported by their respective providers. Alternate methods are
      welcome via pull requests, as PDR would like to restore these
      features.
    + Removal of EDGAR, which was deprecated in v0.6.0.
  * Enhancements
    + A new data connector for data provided by `Alpha Vantage
      <https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation>`__ was introduced to
      obtain Foreign Exchange (FX) data.  (:issue:`389`)
    + A new data connector for data provided by `Alpha Vantage
      <https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation>`__ was introduced to
      obtain historical time series data.  (:issue:`389`)
    + A new data connector for data provided by `Alpha Vantage
      <https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation>`__ was introduced to
      obtain sector performance data, accessed through the top-level
      function "get_sector_performance_av".  (:issue:`389`)
    + A new data connector for data provided by `Alpha Vantage
      <https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation>`__ was introduced to
      obtain real-time Batch Stock Quotes through the top-level
      function "get_quote_av".  (:issue:`389`)
    + MOEX data connector now supports multiple symbols in
      constructor.  (:issue:`562`)
  * Backwards incompatible API changes
    + Deprecation of Google finance daily reader.  Google retired the
      remaining financial data end point in June 2018.  It is not
      possible to reliably retrieve historical price data without this
      endpoint. The Google daily reader will raise an
      `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.
    + Deprecation of Morningstar daily reader. Morningstar ended
      support for the historical price data endpoint in July 2018. It
      is not possible to retrieve historical price data without this
      endpoint. The Morningstar daily reader will raise an
      `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.
    + When requesting multiple symbols from a DailyReader (ex: google,
      yahoo, IEX) a MultiIndex DataFrame is now returned.  Previously
      Panel or dict of DataFrames were returned. (:issue:`297`).
  * Bug Fixes
    + Added support for passing the API KEY to QuandlReader either
      directly or by setting the environmental variable QUANDL_API_KEY
      (:issue:`485`).
    + Added support for optionally passing a custom base_url to the
      EnigmaReader (:issue:`499`).
    + Fix Yahoo! price data (:issue:`498`).
    + Added back support for Yahoo! price, dividends, and splits data
      for stocks and currency pairs (:issue:`487`).
    + Add `is_list_like` to compatibility layer to avoid failure on
      pandas >= 0.23 (:issue:`520`).
    + Fixed Yahoo! time offset (:issue:`487`).
    + Fix Yahoo! quote reader (:issue: `540`).
    + Remove import of deprecated `tm.get_data_path` (:issue: `566`)
    + Allow full usage of stooq url parameters.
    + Removed unused requests-file and requests-ftp dependencies.
    + Fix Yahoo! actions issue where the default reporting adjusts
      dividends. The unadjusted dividends may lack precision due to
      accumulated numerical error when converting adjustedto the
      original dividend amount. (:issue: `495`)

    + Immediate deprecation of Yahoo!, Google Options and Quotes and
      EDGAR. The end points behind these APIs have radically changed

      like to restore these features, and pull requests are welcome.
    + A new connector for Tiingo was introduced.  Tiingo provides

      <https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/>`__ was introduced
      (:issue:`465`).

      `Morningstar <http://www.morningstar.com>`__ was
      introduced. (:issue:`467`)

  * Backwards incompatible API changes
    + Deprecation of Yahoo readers.  Yahoo! retired the financial data
      end points in late 2017.  It is not possible to reliably
      retrieve data from Yahoo! without these endpoints. The Yahoo!
      readers have been immediately deprecated and will raise an
      `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.
    + Deprecation of EDGAR readers. EDGAR substantially altered their
      API. The EDGAR readers have been immediately deprecated and will
      raise an `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.
    + Google finance data will raise an `UnstableAPIWarning` when
      first called.  Google has also altered their API in a way that
      makes reading data unreliable.  It many call it works.  However
      it also regularly fails, especially when used for bulk
      downloading. Google may be removed in the future.
  * Bug Fixes
    + `freq` parameter was added to the WorldBank connector to address
      a limitation (:issue:`198`, :issue:`449`).
