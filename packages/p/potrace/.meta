  <title>Utility for Tracing a Bitmap to Scalable Outline Image</title>
  <description>Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a
bitmap into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM,
PPM, or BMP), and the default output is one of several vector file
formats.  A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such
as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting
image is not &quot;jaggy&quot; like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered
at any resolution.</description>
