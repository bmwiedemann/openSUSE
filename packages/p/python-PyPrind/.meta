  <title>Python progress bar and percent indicator utility</title>
  <description>The PyPrind (Python Progress Indicator) module provides a progress
bar and a percentage indicator object that let track the progress
of a loop structure or other iterative computation.
A typical application is the processing of large data sets for
which to provide an intuitive estimate at runtime about the
computation progress.
