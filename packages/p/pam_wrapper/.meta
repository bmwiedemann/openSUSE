<package name="pam_wrapper" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>A tool to test PAM applications and PAM modules</title>
  <description>This component of cwrap allows you to either test your PAM (Linux-PAM
and OpenPAM) application or module.

For testing PAM applications, simple PAM module called pam_matrix is
included. If you plan to test a PAM module you can use the pamtest library,
which simplifies testing of modules. You can combine it with the cmocka
unit testing framework or you can use the provided Python bindings to
write tests for your module in Python.

This package doesn't have a devel package because this project is for
development/testing.
