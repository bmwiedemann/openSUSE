  <title>Base class for creating POD filters and translators</title>
  <description>*Pod::Parser* is a base class for creating POD filters and translators. It
handles most of the effort involved with parsing the POD sections from an
input stream, leaving subclasses free to be concerned only with performing
the actual translation of text.

*Pod::Parser* parses PODs, and makes method calls to handle the various
components of the POD. Subclasses of *Pod::Parser* override these methods
to translate the POD into whatever output format they desire.
