  <title>Builds trie-ized regexp</title>
  <description>This module is a faster but simpler version of Regexp::Assemble or Regexp::Optimizer. It builds a trie-ized regexp as above.

This module is faster than Regexp::Assemble but you can only add literals. 'a+b' is treated as 'a\+b', not &quot;more than one a's followed by b&quot;.</description>
