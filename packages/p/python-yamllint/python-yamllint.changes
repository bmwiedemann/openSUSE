- Update to version 1.26.3:
 - Restore setuptools requirement for Python < 3.8
   This reverts commit 8f68248 "Remove runtime dep 'setuptools' for Python
   < 3.8". It looks like removing setuptools induces problems on some
   systems, see for example the linked discussion.
   Fixes https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/issues/380.
- Update to version 1.26.2:
 - setup: update python_requires to comply with PEP 345/440
   According to PEP 345 Requires-Python
   (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0345/#requires-python), the value
   of this field must be a valid Version Specifier
   (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0345/#version-specifiers). Which
   in turn expects this to comply with PEP 440
   (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/).
   While not an issue for those that directly use `pip`, this will cause
   issues for `poetry` users in the next release (if their current stance
   is maintained). Discussion of the issue and there stance can be found
   here: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4095.
- Update to version 1.26.1:
 - line_length: skip all hash signs starting comment
 - Remove runtime dep 'setuptools' for Python < 3.8
   > In recent versions of setuptools and Python, console-script entry
   points are using stdlib importlib by default, thus setuptools is no
   longer needed as a runtime dependency.
   https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/2197
   https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/CHANGES.rst#v4730
   https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html
- Update to version 1.26.0:
 - quoted-strings: Fix explicit octal recognition
   PyYAML implements YAML spec version 1.1, not 1.2. Hence, values starting
   with `0o` are not considered as numbers: they are just strings, so they
   need quotes when `quoted-strings: {required: true}`.
   >>> import yaml
   >>> yaml.resolver.Resolver().resolve(yaml.nodes.ScalarNode, '100', (True, False))
   'tag:yaml.org,2002:int'
   >>> yaml.resolver.Resolver().resolve(yaml.nodes.ScalarNode, '0100', (True, False))
   'tag:yaml.org,2002:int'
   >>> yaml.resolver.Resolver().resolve(yaml.nodes.ScalarNode, '0o100', (True, False))
   'tag:yaml.org,2002:str'
   Let's try to prevent that.
   Fixes https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/issues/351.
 - End support for Python 2
   As planned and advertized, yamllint drops support for Python 2 on 2021.
 - Allow only non-empty brackets/braces
   We'd like to disallow brackets and braces in our YAML, but there's a
   catch: the only way to describe an empty array or hash in YAML is to
   supply an empty one (`[]` or `{}`). Otherwise, the value will be null.
   This commit adds a `non-empty` option to `forbid` for brackets and
   braces. When it is set, all flow and sequence mappings will cause errors
   _except_ for empty ones.
 - Add support for Python 3.9, drop Python 3.4
   Add support for Python 3.9 since it was officially released in October
   and drop support for Python 3.4 since it is end-of-life (EOL).
 - docs: Add configuration for integration with Arcanist
- Update to version 1.25.0:
 - gitignore: Add /.eggs
   Quick PR to ignore the `/.eggs` folder, which appears to be generated every
   time the `python setup.py test` command is run.
   The content of the `./.eggs/README.txt` file:
   > This directory contains eggs that were downloaded by setuptools to build,
   > test, and run plug-ins.
   > 
   > This directory caches those eggs to prevent repeated downloads.
   > 
   > However, it is safe to delete this directory.
 - directives: Fix DOS lines messing with rule IDs
   Fixes #325
   The linter allows a directive to contain trailing whitespace characters like
   
, but does not trim them before iterating on the rules. As a result, the last
   rule in the list contains the trailing whitespace characters and never matches
   any existing rule.
   I added the necessary trimming, as well as a test with 2 checks to go along
   with it.
 - Auto-change output format if GitHub Actions detected
 - Add support for GitHub Annotations output format
   Support the format used by GitHub Actions to annotate pull
   requests with linter failures
 - fix: add runtime dependency to setuptools
   yamllint depends on pkg_resources.load_entry_point from setuptools to
   make its command working, so this runtime dependency to setuptools is
   necessary to be listed.
 - Add 'forbid' configurations to the braces and brackets rules
   Add 'forbid' configuration parameters to the braces and brackets rules
   to allow users to forbid the use of flow style collections, flow
   mappings and flow sequences.
 - quoted-strings: Fix detecting strings with hashtag as requiring quotes
 - octal-values: Prevent detection of 8 and 9 as octal values
 - docs: Make 'yaml-file' config documentation clearer
   Related to https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/issues/311.
 - enhancement: add some metadata to provide extra info in its PyPI page
   Add some metadata (project_urls) to provide extra info in its PyPI page.
