- release precision for i586 test
  gh#skyfielders/python-skyfield#411 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 22 14:13:46 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to Version 1.24
  * Added methods :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.from_datetime()`
    and :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.from_datetimes()` to 
    the :class:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale` class, to 
    better advertise the ability to build a Skyfield time 
    from a Python datetime — an ability that was previously 
    overloaded into the year parameter of the 
    :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.utc()` method (where 
    it is still supported for backwards compatibility, but 
    no longer documented).
  * Fix: improved the accuracy with which velocity is 
    converted between the Earth-fixed ITRF frame that rotates 
    with the Earth and the inertial GCRS frame that does not. 
    In particular, this should make Earth satellite 
    velocities more accurate.
- rebase patches skyfield-pr404-comparefloat.patch
  and skyfield-pr405-replace-assay-by-pytest.patch

- mention python-skyfield-rpmlintrc to specfile: don't warn about
  matplotlib and html5lib in Requires 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 10 14:51:52 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to Version 1.23     
  * Added `kepler-orbits` support for generating the positions of comets and 
    asteroids from Minor Planet Center data files.   
  * Added `skyfield.positionlib.ICRF.is_behind_earth()` to determine whether a 
    celestial object is blocked from an Earth satellite’s view by the Earth 
    itself.    
  * Replaced the awkward and hard-to-explain rough_period search parameter with 
    the conceptually simpler step_days parameter, and updated the instructions 
    in `searches` to match.    
  * Made the `skyfield.iokit.Loader.load.tle_file()` import method less strict 
    about Earth satellite names: any text on the line before two lines of TLE 
    data is now saved as the satellite name. A parameter skip_names=True turns 
    this off if, for particular TLE files, this leads to unwanted text being 
    saved
