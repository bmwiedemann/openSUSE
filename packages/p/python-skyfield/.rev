    <comment>- release precision for i586 test
  gh#skyfielders/python-skyfield#411 

- Update to Version 1.24
  * Added methods :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.from_datetime()`
    and :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.from_datetimes()` to 
    the :class:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale` class, to 
    better advertise the ability to build a Skyfield time 
    from a Python datetime — an ability that was previously 
    overloaded into the year parameter of the 
    :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.utc()` method (where 
    it is still supported for backwards compatibility, but 
    no longer documented).
  * Fix: improved the accuracy with which velocity is 
    converted between the Earth-fixed ITRF frame that rotates 
    with the Earth and the inertial GCRS frame that does not. 
    In particular, this should make Earth satellite 
    velocities more accurate.

    <comment>- Update to version 1.27
  * The printed appearance of both vectors and of vector 
    functions like Earth locations and Earth satellites 
    have been rewritten to be more informative and 
    consistent.
  * Added compute_calendar_date() which lets the caller 
    choose the Julian calendar for ancient dates instead of 
    always using the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This 
    should be particularly useful for historians.
  * Added J() that builds a time array from an array of 
    floating point years. #436
  * Added four new strftime methods for the non-UTC 
    timescales (#443). All four of them support %f for 
    microseconds, and provide a reasonable default format 
    string for callers who don’t wish to concoct their own:
      tai_strftime()
      tt_strftime()
      tdb_strftime()
      ut1_strftime() 
  * Thanks to several fixes, comets and asteroids with 
    parabolic and hyperbolic orbits should now raise fewer 
    errors.
 *  The prototype planetary_magnitude() can now return 
    magnitudes for Uranus without raising an exception. The 
    routine does not yet take into account whether the 
    observer is facing the equator or poles of Uranus, so 
    the magnitude predicted for the planet will only be 
    accurate to within about 0.1 magnitudes.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.29
  * Fix: the new Julian calendar feature was raising an 
    exception in the calendar methods like 
    `skyfield.timelib.Time.tt_calendar()` if the time 
    object was in fact an array of times. #450
  * Fix: trying to iterate over a time object would raise an 
    exception if the time was created through 
    `~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.ut1()`.
- Version 1.28
  * Broken URL: Because the VizieR archive apparently decided 
    to uncompress their copy of the hip_main.dat.gz Hipparcos 
    catalog file, the old URL now returns a 404 error. As an 
    emergency fix, this version of Skyfield switches to their 
    uncompressed hip_main.dat. Hopefully they don’t compress 
    it again and break the new URL! A more permanent solution 
    is discussed at: #454
  * To unblock this release, removed a few deprecated pre-1.0 
    experiments from April 2015 in skyfield.hipparcos and 
    skyfield.named_stars that broke because the Hipparcos 
    catalog is no longer compressed; hopefully no one was 
    using them.
  * In a sweeping internal change, the 
    `~skyfield.timelib.Timescale` and 
    `~skyfield.timelib.Time` objects now offer support 
    for the Julian calendar that’s used by historians for 
    dates preceding the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 
    1582. See choice of calendars if you want to turn on 
    Julian dates in your application. #450</comment>
