    <comment>- release precision for i586 test
  gh#skyfielders/python-skyfield#411 

- Update to Version 1.24
  * Added methods :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.from_datetime()`
    and :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.from_datetimes()` to 
    the :class:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale` class, to 
    better advertise the ability to build a Skyfield time 
    from a Python datetime — an ability that was previously 
    overloaded into the year parameter of the 
    :meth:`~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.utc()` method (where 
    it is still supported for backwards compatibility, but 
    no longer documented).
  * Fix: improved the accuracy with which velocity is 
    converted between the Earth-fixed ITRF frame that rotates 
    with the Earth and the inertial GCRS frame that does not. 
    In particular, this should make Earth satellite 
    velocities more accurate.

    <comment>- Update to version 1.27
  * The printed appearance of both vectors and of vector 
    functions like Earth locations and Earth satellites 
    have been rewritten to be more informative and 
    consistent.
  * Added compute_calendar_date() which lets the caller 
    choose the Julian calendar for ancient dates instead of 
    always using the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This 
    should be particularly useful for historians.
  * Added J() that builds a time array from an array of 
    floating point years. #436
  * Added four new strftime methods for the non-UTC 
    timescales (#443). All four of them support %f for 
    microseconds, and provide a reasonable default format 
    string for callers who don’t wish to concoct their own:
      tai_strftime()
      tt_strftime()
      tdb_strftime()
      ut1_strftime() 
  * Thanks to several fixes, comets and asteroids with 
    parabolic and hyperbolic orbits should now raise fewer 
    errors.
 *  The prototype planetary_magnitude() can now return 
    magnitudes for Uranus without raising an exception. The 
    routine does not yet take into account whether the 
    observer is facing the equator or poles of Uranus, so 
    the magnitude predicted for the planet will only be 
    accurate to within about 0.1 magnitudes.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.29
  * Fix: the new Julian calendar feature was raising an 
    exception in the calendar methods like 
    `skyfield.timelib.Time.tt_calendar()` if the time 
    object was in fact an array of times. #450
  * Fix: trying to iterate over a time object would raise an 
    exception if the time was created through 
    `~skyfield.timelib.Timescale.ut1()`.
- Version 1.28
  * Broken URL: Because the VizieR archive apparently decided 
    to uncompress their copy of the hip_main.dat.gz Hipparcos 
    catalog file, the old URL now returns a 404 error. As an 
    emergency fix, this version of Skyfield switches to their 
    uncompressed hip_main.dat. Hopefully they don’t compress 
    it again and break the new URL! A more permanent solution 
    is discussed at: #454
  * To unblock this release, removed a few deprecated pre-1.0 
    experiments from April 2015 in skyfield.hipparcos and 
    skyfield.named_stars that broke because the Hipparcos 
    catalog is no longer compressed; hopefully no one was 
    using them.
  * In a sweeping internal change, the 
    `~skyfield.timelib.Timescale` and 
    `~skyfield.timelib.Time` objects now offer support 
    for the Julian calendar that’s used by historians for 
    dates preceding the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 
    1582. See choice of calendars if you want to turn on 
    Julian dates in your application. #450</comment>

    <comment>- Update to v1.34
  * The position classes have gained methods frame_xyz(), 
    frame_xyz_and_velocity(), frame_latlon(), and 
    from_time_and_frame_vectors() that work with a new 
    library skyfield.framelib to offer a number of familiar 
    reference frames. These replace the existing ad-hoc 
    position methods for ecliptic and galactic coordinates, 
    which are now deprecated (but will continue to be 
    supported). See Coordinates in other reference frames.
  * Added support for IERS Polar Motion 𝑥 and 𝑦.
  * Added a method lst_hours_at() that computes Local 
    Sidereal Time.
  * A new almanac routine moon_phase() returns the Moon 
    phase as an angle where 0° is New Moon, 90° is First 
    Quarter, 180° is Full, and 270° is Last Quarter. #282
  * Almanac search routines that previously returned a 
    Boolean true/false array now return an integer 0/1 
    array instead, to work around a new deprecation warning 
    in NumPy which, for example, would have outlawed using 
    the Boolean array from moon_nodes() to index into the 
    MOON_NODES list that provides a name for each node. #486
  * The undocumented columns magnitude_H and magnitude_G 
    in the Minor Planet Center comets dataframe have been 
    renamed magnitude_g and magnitude_k following further 
    research on the file format (which does not itself 
    document which magnitude model is intended). #416
- add finals2000A.all to testdata
- Define skip_python36 for TW, because current astropy needs
  Python &gt;=3.7

    <comment>- Update to 1.39
  * The Angle.dstr() and Angle.hstr() methods now accept a
    format= argument that lets callers override Skyfield’s default
    angle formatting and supply their own; see Formatting angles.
    #513
  * The prototype planetary_magnitude() function now works not
    only when given a single position, but when given a vector of
    several positions.
- Release 1.38
  * Replaced the old historic ∆T table from the United States
    Naval Observatory with up-to-date splines from the 2020 release
    of the extensive research by Morrison, Stephenson, Hohenkerk,
    and Zawilski and also adjusted the slope of Skyfield’s
    near-future ∆T estimates to make the slope of ∆T much less
    abrupt over the coming century.
  * Added a full reference frame object for the TEME reference
    frame used by SGP4 Earth satellite elements.
- Release 1.37
  * Added a frame_latlon_and_rates() method that can compute the
    rates at which angles like altitude and azimuth, or right
    ascension and declination, are changing.
  * Accepted a contributor’s helpful fix for a rounding error that
    had slightly shifted a few constellation boundaries. #548
  * The Time tuple utc and method utc_strftime() are now backed by
    the same math, so they always advance to the next calendar day
    at the same moment. This makes it safe to mix values returned
    by one of them with values returned by the other. #542
  * Vector subtraction now returns the position subclass specific
    to the resulting vector’s center. #549
- Release 1.36</comment>
