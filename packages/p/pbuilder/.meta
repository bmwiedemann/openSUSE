  <title>Personal package builder for .deb packages</title>
  <description>pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the
chroot. It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast
connection to a Debian/Ubuntu mirror is ideal, but not necessary.

&quot;pbuilder create&quot; uses debootstrap to create a chroot image.

&quot;pbuilder update&quot; updates the image to the current state of
testing/unstable/whatever

&quot;pbuilder build&quot; takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot
image.

pdebuild is a wrapper for developers, to allow running pbuilder
just like &quot;debuild&quot;, as a normal user.
