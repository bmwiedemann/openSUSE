  <title>A Lightweight, Fast, and Secure FTP Server</title>
  <description>Pure-FTPd is a fast, production-quality, and standard-conforming FTP
server, based-on Troll-FTPd. Unlike other popular FTP servers, it has
no known security flaws, is trivial to set up, and is especially
designed for modern Linux kernels (setfsuid and sendfile capabilities)
. Features include: PAM support, IPv6, chroot()ed home directories,
virtual domains, built-in LS, anti-warez system, bandwidth throttling,
FXP, bounded ports for passive downloads, upload and download ratios,
Apache log files, and more.</description>
