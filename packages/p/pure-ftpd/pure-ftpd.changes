- removal of version checks for outdated distributions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 25 13:14:55 UTC 2019 - matthias.gerstner@suse.com

- removal of SuSEfirewall2 service, since SuSEfirewall2 has been replaced by
  firewalld, see [1].

Tue Jun 18 15:04:39 UTC 2019 - Peter Simons <psimons@suse.com>

- Add missing run-time dependency on system-user-ftp to ensure that
  user exits. [boo#1136997]

- Processed the spec file with spec-cleaner version 1.1.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  9 06:52:55 UTC 2019 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Add the missing build dependency for Tumbleweed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 17:09:05 UTC 2019 - psimons@suse.com

- Apply "pure-ftpd-malloc-limit.patch" to add a configuration
  option that sets the process memory limit used by "ls" for
  globbing. The value can be specified as optional third argument
  to "-L" (or LimitRecursion in config file). Because it's
  optional, the old configuration files will still work without
  change with new binaries and update will be smooth. This change
  allows sites that store an extremely large set of files inside a
  single directory to tune their installation so that the "ls"
  command in that directory will succeed without exceeding the ftpd
  process memory limit. [bsc#1119187]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 05:45:16 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Version update to 1.0.47:
  * If TLS was only enabled on the control channel (-Y 1), the STAT
    command would send its output as other directory listing
    commands, breaking the TLS stream. This has been fixed.
  * The system user “_ftp” can be used as an alternative to “ftp”
    for anonymous sessions.
  * Compatibility with libsodium > 1.0.12 was added (including
    minimal mode).
  * The prefix for Argon2-hashed passwords in LDAP has been changed
    to “{argon2}” (from “{argon2i}”). Ditto for MySQL and
    PostgreSQL: the authentication method is now called “argon2”
    instead of “argon2i”, and includes both Argon2i and Argon2id.
- use https for main site and source download
- switch to bz2 tarball (smaller)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 15 08:40:15 UTC 2017 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 1.0.46:
  * Fix build with openssl-1.1
  * The Perl and Python wrappers are gone
  * TLS v1.0 sessions are now refused
  * Unmaintained contributions have been removed
  * File globbing could take up to `GLOB_TIMEOUT` seconds
    (17 seconds by default) when matching some patterns, no matter what the
    configured recursion level was.
- Refresh patches:
  * pure-ftpd-1.0.20_config.patch
  * pure-ftpd-1.0.20_doc.patch
- Drop patch pure-ftpd-1.0.32-portrange.patch
  * The upstream no longer provide pure-config.pl/py scripts for launching
  * This also means the initscript and service were tweaked to reflect this
- Disable xinetd on systemd having versions where we can stick to socket
  based services instead
  * By default it does not make sense to have this service socket activated
    tho so leave it to user to provide this

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 14 11:32:59 UTC 2017 - psimons@suse.com

- Fix broken pure-ftpd.init script. We cannot use startproc to run
  /usr/sbin/pure-config.pl, because the utility assumes that the
  name of that executable matches the name of the started process,
  which it does not in our case. Furthermore, the start script will
  write a status message to stdout, so we don't have to do it in
  the init script. [bsc#1042690]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 27 12:12:01 UTC 2017 - psimons@suse.com

- Fix build on SUSE:SLE-11, which doesn't define the RPM variable
  %{_initddir}, so we have to use %{_sysconfdir}/init.d instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 19 13:32:57 UTC 2017 - psimons@suse.com

- pure-ftpd-apparmor.patch: Add an AppArmor profile (based on the
  one from SLE11).

- The Factory version of pure-ftp will replace the older package in
  SLE-11 as per fate#321125. That update brings the following
  changes:

  * These patches have been updated and renamed in the process:
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-default_tcp_sedrcv_buffer_size.patch is now
      in pure-ftpd-1.0.32-default_tcp_sedrcv_buffer_size.patch.
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.21-portrange.patch is now in
      pure-ftpd-1.0.32-portrange.patch.
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.32-cap-audit-write.patch is now in
      pure-ftpd-1.0.36-cap-audit-control.patch.

  * These patches are obsolete now and have been removed:
    * 0001-Act-like-a-server-even-in-TLS-mode-when-in-active-mo.patch
    * 0002-Init-a-TLS-data-session-after-having-sent-the-go-ahe.patch
    * 0003-add-opt_a-to-donlist.patch
    * 0004-support-stat-over-tls.patch
    * 0005-speedup-TLS-listing.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.20_config_minuid.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-fix-listing-if-directory-has-white-space-in-it.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-flush-cmd-after-tls.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-oes-bugfix-1.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-oes-bugfix-2.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-oes-bugfix.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-oes-disable-ascii.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-oes_remote_server.patch
    * pure-ftpd-1.0.22-wait-on-tls-handshake.patch
    * pure-ftpd-allow-crypto-settings.patch
    * pure-ftpd-remove-gpl-code.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 11:32:12 UTC 2016 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Kill omc xml file useless nowdays
- Version update to 1.0.43:
  * -J switch has been fixed
  * openBSD compat changes
  * Passwords are now hashed using Argon2i, default for puredb accounts now

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 10 21:36:36 UTC 2016 - wr@rosenauer.org

- Add gpg signature

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  8 10:58:04 UTC 2016 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 1.0.42:
  - Compilation fix for OpenBSD and Bitrig when Pure-FTPd is not
    compiled with libsodium.
  - The connection is now dropped if HTTP commands are received.
  - LDAP force_default_gid and force_default_uid now work as documented.
  - The ONLY_ACCEPT_REUSED_SSL_SESSIONS switch (introduced in Pure-FTPd
    1.0.22 circa 2009, but disabled back then due to client compatibility
    concerns) is now on by default, except in broken clients compatibility mode.
  - libmariadb is looked for in addition to libmysqlclient
  - MySQL: my_make_scrambled_password() is not always an exported
    symbol any more, so pure-ftpd now ships a reimplementation.
  - openssl/ec.h is not available on some Linux distributions that
    disable EC in OpenSSL. This is being tested by autoconf.
  - New command-line switch: -2/--certfile= to set the path to the
    certificate file when using TLS.
  - Support for TCP_FASTOPEN added on Linux
  - The LDAP configuration file didn't allow a default gid without also
    defining a default uid. This is no longer the case.
  - OpenBSD's glob() left the glob_t structure uninitialized if the
    pattern was larger than PATH_MAX, causing globfree() to free() an
    unwanted pointer. The bug was introduced in Pure-FTPd 1.0.34.
- Refresh patch:
  * pure-ftpd-1.0.20_config.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  5 08:38:25 UTC 2015 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Reenable sle11 builds I need for testing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  5 07:51:32 UTC 2015 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Remove gpg/keyring, not provided now by upstream
- Cleanup with spec-cleaner
- Update to latest upstream 1.0.39:
  * Explicitly include openssl/ec.h for OpenSSL 0.9.8 (CentOS 5)
  * Retry if SSL_shutdown() returns -1 and SSL_ERROR_WANT_(READ|WRITE)
  * The default cipher suite is now
    ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES:CAMELLIA:DES-CBC3-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!aECDH:!EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:!KRB5-DES-CBC3-SH
  * TLS forward secrecy support was added. DH parameters are loaded from
    TLS_DHPARAMS_FILE, if present. ECDH is also supported - Default curve
    is prime256v1 (TLS_DEFAULT_ECDH_CURVE). The best curve is automatically
    selected when using LibreSSL.
  * scrypt hashed passwords can be used in the MySQL, PostgreSQL and
    LDAP backends.
  * The -C: prefix can be added to the cipher suite in order to make valid
    client certificates mandatory. This is no longer a compile-time option.
  * The Clear Command Channel (CCC) command is now supported.
  * pure-config.py is compatible with Python 3.
  * SSL (v2, v3) is refused by default.
  * The PureDB backend supports the scrypt function in order to hash
    passwords. This is the preferred algorithm, but requires the presence
    of libsodium.
  * DES-hashed passwords are not supported any more.
  * LDAP uid and gid values can over overridden in the LDAP configuration file.
  * RC4 was killed.
- Refreshed patches:
  * pure-ftpd-1.0.20_config.patch
  * pure-ftpd-1.0.20_doc.patch
  * pure-ftpd-1.0.20_ftpwho_path.patch

- spec file: fixed pure-ftpd.service file installation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 11:39:50 UTC 2012 - mvyskocil@suse.cz

- update to 1.0.36 :
 - Sync built-in glob(3) code with OpenBSD-current, and remove code we
don't use instead of ifdef'ing it.
 - Repair checkproc() on Linux when support for capabitilies is
compiled in. Reported by Eric Gouyer.
 - Don't read /dev/*random every time we need a value. Just use
arc4random() everywhere and seed it before we possibly chroot().
 - Add support for MFMT, with the same code as SITE UTIME.
 - Support 2-arguments SITE UTIME.
 - LDAP: Add LDAPDefaultHomeDirectory, suggested by Landry Breuil.
 - Add SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 to SSL options if the list of ciphers is
prefixed by -S: , needed by Brad.
 - Use more paranoid compiler options whenever possible, and preliminary
uncluttering of the autoconf script.
 - Try to cache locale-related data at startup after tzset(), rather
than during a session.
 - Fix quota computation after rename() overwrites an existing file.
Reported by Hiramoto Koujo, thanks!
 - Improved autoconf detection of -fstack-protector and -fPIE
 - If 10 digits are not enough to print the size of a file in an
ls-like output, bump the max number of digits to 18. This adds support for
files up to 1 exabyte.
 - Don't display dot files (except . and ..) if dot_read_ok is 0 in
donlist() - but not in sglob() yet. This change is purely cosmetic. There are
many ways to figure out if a file exists.

- document bnc#756306: pure-ftpd umask setting not working properly
  * /etc/pure-ftpd/pure-ftpd.conf contains a note about a side-effect of pam_umask

- add native pure-ftpd.service for systemd-powered systems

- use the same way how to start the daemon in sysvinit script and put
  $remote_fs dependency
  usr/sbin/pure-config.pl /etc/pure-ftpd/pure-ftpd.conf --daemonize

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 08:31:38 UTC 2011 - mvyskocil@suse.cz

- fix bnc#700611 - pure-ftpd fails with pam
  * pure-ftpd-1.0.32-cap-audit-write.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 22:23:06 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.0.32:
  - Support SHA1 password hashing in MySQL and PostgreSQL backends
  - Support for braces expansion in directory listings has been
    disabled - Cf. CVE-2011-0418
- Aditional changes FROM 1.0.31:
  - Introduce --tlsciphersuite (-J) to set the list of allowed ciphers,
    thanks to Todd Rinaldo.
  - The -F switch has been documented in the built-in help.
  - Shell-like escaping is now partially handled when emulating the "ls"
    command.
  - Use my_make_scrambled_password() instead of make_scrambled_password().
    Suggested by Arkadiusz Miskiewicz.
- Refresh and fix patch for [bnc#407363]:
  - old: patch pure-ftpd-1.0.22-default_tcp_sedrcv_buffer_size.patch
  - new: patch pure-ftpd-1.0.32-default_tcp_sedrcv_buffer_size.patch
- Refresh PassivePortRange patch:

  - new: pure-ftpd-1.0.32-portrange.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 11 11:56:20 UTC 2011 - mvyskocil@suse.cz

- update to 1.0.30
  * pure-quotacheck can now work with a large number of files.
  * OPTS UTF-8 is now an alias to OPTS UTF8.
  * Fix a STARTTLS flaw similar to Postfix’s CVE-2011-0411. If you’re using
    TLS, upgrading is recommended.
  * Provide ANSI-compliant MySQL configuration example.
  * Fix some issues with man pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- $remote_fs --> network-remotefs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 14 18:34:37 UTC 2010 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Added "--with-virtualchroot" option;
- Spec file cleaned with spec-cleaner;
- updated to version 1.0.29:
  - max_dlmap_size was size_t instead off_t, causing misalignment while
    downloading > 4 Gb files on a 32-bits arch.
  - pread() vs lseek()+read() was a useless optimization, since pread()
    doesn't change the file position and further reads weren't going through
    plain read() calls.
  - iconv_fd_* should be initialized by (iconv_t) -1 as we test them upon
    exit. Fixes segfaults on glibc.
  - pure-uploadscript tries to reach the pipe during 30 seconds instead of 10.
- changes in version 1.0.28:
  - FTPD_PAM_SERVICE_NAME can be defined in order to change the PAM service
    name.
  - When an upload gets renamed (--autorename), send the new name to the
    uploadscript instead of the original one.
  - The ALLO command now checks for the actual disk space in addition to the
    virtal quota.
  - Work around OSX broken poll()
  - After an atomic resumed upload, don't append the previous file size to the
    quota.
  - Always accept OPTS UTF8 ON, but refuse OPTS UTF8 OFF if client_charset is
    UTF8.
  - Fix AUTHD_ENCRYPTED
  - Reset the CWD failures counter after a successful directory has been
    created. It avoids spurious disconnections with ncftp.
  - Support for iPhone has been moved to another branch.
  - Fix crash with PostgreSQL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 15:27:50 UTC 2010 - mseben@novell.com

- updated to version 1.0.27:
 - Have pureftpd_shutdown() shut the server down even if a client is
   connected on iPhone.
 - Allow users with no quota to delete .pureftpd-upload-* files.
 - Unbreak ipv6 support, reported by Brad Smith.
 - Disable SSLv3 renegotiation if an old SSL library is used. If you really
   want to re-enable SSLv3 renegotiation, even with a recent library, you can
   always define ACCEPT_SSL_RENEGOTIATION.
- changes in version 1.0.26:
 - Fix incompatibilities with Cyberduck when TLS is enabled.
 - Don't TLS_accept() immediately after accept(). Reply on the connection
   socket first, so that clients don't have to wait before knowing that they
   can actually use TLS. It avoids lags with LFTP and hangs with Cyberduck.
 - Properly change the process name on Linux when the -S option is used, by
   Margus Kaidja.
 - Unbreak authentication of non-chrooted users. Thanks to Juergen Daubert
   for the bug report.
- changes in version 1.0.25:
 - Show symlinks as symlinks in MLSD, except when the broken client
   compatibility mode is turned on and links are not dangling (just like the
   old LIST and NLIST commands). Reported by Mime Cuvalo.
 - More gcc 2 compatibility, thanks to Todd Rinaldo.
 - Properly handle custom paths in man pages. Thanks to Scott Haneda and
   Mathieu Parisot.
 - Have $localstatedir default to /var as it used to be unless
   --localstatedir=... is explicitely passed to ./configure
 - Use @VERSION@ in man pages.
 - --without-pam disables PAM on OSX and iPhone.
 - Allow cross-compilation.
 - Experimental iPhone target.
 - Change the way it links, building a library first.
 - Don't use mmap() any more for downloads. It's too slow.
 - Don't use hard-coded paths in order to find MySQL and PostgreSQL
   libraries and header files. Use mysql_config and pg_config instead.
   Suggested by John Alberts.
 - Log the DELE command similar to the RETR and STOR commands. Suggested by
   Martin Fuxa.
 - The primary group gets cached so that it's always displayed in directory
   listings.
 - Avoid a client process to burn CPU in an infinite loop if the command
   channel gets disconnected before the data channel. Reported by Thomas Min
   and Margus Kaidja.
 - Restore the traditional behavior of a download restarting at the end of a
   file. For some weird reasons, some clients still insist on doing that. Don't
   send a 55x return code, just let them download... nothing.
 - Documentation updates.
- changes in version 1.0.24:
 - Refuse empty passwords in LDAP bind mode. Reported by Henning Brauer.
 - The package can now be compiled with gcc 2.
- changes in version 1.0.23:
 - LDAP: accept "enabled" as a correct value for FTPStatus as it used to be.
 - More useful error logging for OpenSSL errors.
 - Don't read certificates twice.
 - Fix compilation on Solaris with privsep, thanks to Ritesh Patel.
 - Don't replace : (as in IPv6 addresses) in host names. Thanks to Tero Pelander.
 - Add SUP top AUXILIARY to LDAP schema, suggested by Zhang Huangbin.
 - Don't ignore dot files even if -D is not supplied with the MLSD command.
 - Deinline code
 - Throttling more reliable
 - STAT is now working over TLS
 - DH keys for ephemeral key exchange are now handled
 - Fix libiconv checking
 - The column was missing in the PassivePortRange comment (thanks to Igor Alexadrov)
 - LDAP authentication through binding is now possible in addition to
   passwords. This allows for the FTP server to run with an unprivileged LDAP
   account. It also adds a warning if auth method password is used and doesn't find
   a userPassword attribute. This usually indicates that the LDAP bind DN
   cannot read the attributes, because it doesn't have sufficient privileges.
   Contributed by Wilco Baan Hofman.
 - Perform charset conversions on directory names. Issue spotted by Xianghu Zhao.
 - Almost a complete rewrite of the upload, download and TLS code for more
   reliability
 - Seemlessly handle ABOR without any SIGURG
 - Try to immediately handle any kind of disconnection
 - Use poll() rather than select() as much as possible
 - Distinguish aborted (even the hard way) and completed download and upload
   operations in log files
 - Minor corrections to he French messages
 - Don't use atomic uploads unless --notruncate or --autorename have been
   enabled
 - Take care of removing .pureftpd-upload-* files in every possible case
 - List up to 10000 files per directory per default instead of 2000
 - Don't mess with TCP_NOPUSH, as it interferes with OpenSSL
 - New compile-time option: --with-implicittls in order to build a FTPS-only
   server
 - ./configure --localstatedir can now be used in order to avoid storing the
   scoreboard and other dynamic files in /var/run/
 - Quota handling reworked (easier, and way more reliable)
 - RNTO support even when quota are enabled.
 - A bunch of return codes were fixed to be more RFC-conformant.
 - ALLO command is now actually checking if an upload can occur without
   blowing the quota.
 - Don't change the TCP window size. Admins should do this as part of their
   system configuration.
 - Privsep is now enabled by default. Use --without-privsep to disable.
 - --without-banner is gone. If you have a cookie file (-F), the default
   banner won't be displayed.
 - Compile with PAM by default on OSX.
 - Switch the privsep process to _pure-ftpd or pure-ftpd when no privileged
   call is actually necessary. Since only the effective uid chances, it's not
   brutally useful yet, but it paves the way for forthcoming changes.
 - Install man pages with local paths instead of hard-coded ones.

- Update to version 1.0.22
 - New catalan translation
 - TLS support for LDAP
 - Fix usage of MySQL 5 stored procedures
 - Compatibility with newer OpenLDAP versions
 - Don't hang up during uploads if we get any other command than QUIT and
   ABORT.
 - SITE UTIME reads UTC time
 - A space is needed for inline content in response to the MLST command.
 - Time zone issues should be fixed for good. We have to redefine TZ,
   tzset() is not enough on Linux when we are in a chroot environment.
 - Correctly respond to FEAT without removing extra features when passive
   mode is disabled. Thanks to upb.
 - Better process name change setup for Linux.
 - Auto-created home directories are now created with mode 0777 (and
   directory umask is applied), per common request. It's very important to
   double check your umask.
 - Extend gid / uid to 10 digits in ls output. Extend file size as well.
 - Brazilian portuguese translation was updated.
 - Fix SecureFX compatibility.
 - Use PQescapeStringConn() for PostgreSQL instead of hand-made escaping.
