- Update to 2024.3.0
  ## New Features
  * Partial writes to existing chunks with region or append_dim
    will now raise an error (unless safe_chunks=False); previously
    an error would only be raised on new variables. (PR8459,
    GH8371, GH8882) By Maximilian Roos.
  * Grouped and resampling quantile calculations now use the
    vectorized algorithm in flox>=0.9.4 if present. By Deepak
    Cherian.
  * Do not broadcast in arithmetic operations when global option
    arithmetic_broadcast=False (GH6806, PR8784). By Etienne Schalk
    and Deepak Cherian.
  * Add the .oindex property to Explicitly Indexed Arrays for
    orthogonal indexing functionality. (GH8238, PR8750) By Anderson
    Banihirwe.
  * Add the .vindex property to Explicitly Indexed Arrays for
    vectorized indexing functionality. (GH8238, PR8780) By Anderson
    Banihirwe.
  * Expand use of .oindex and .vindex properties. (:pull: 8790) By
    Anderson Banihirwe and Deepak Cherian.
  * Allow creating xr.Coordinates objects with no indexes (PR8711)
    By Benoit Bovy and Tom Nicholas.
  * Enable plotting of datetime.dates. (GH8866, PR8873) By Sascha
    Hofmann.
  ## Breaking changes
  * Don’t allow overwriting index variables with to_zarr region
    writes. (GH8589, PR8876). By Deepak Cherian.
  ## Bug fixes
  * The default freq parameter in xr.date_range() and
    xr.cftime_range() is set to 'D' only if periods, start, or end
    are None (GH8770, PR8774). By Roberto Chang.
  * Ensure that non-nanosecond precision numpy.datetime64 and
    numpy.timedelta64 values are cast to nanosecond precision
    values when used in DataArray.expand_dims() and
    :Dataset.expand_dims() (PR8781). By Spencer Clark.
  * CF conform handling of _FillValue/missing_value and dtype in
    CFMaskCoder/CFScaleOffsetCoder (GH2304, GH5597, GH7691, PR8713,
    see also discussion in PR7654). By Kai Mühlbauer.
  * Do not cast _FillValue/missing_value in CFMaskCoder if
    _Unsigned is provided (GH8844, PR8852).
  * Adapt handling of copy keyword argument for numpy >= 2.0dev
    (GH8844, PR8851, PR8865). By Kai Mühlbauer.
  * Import trapz/trapezoid depending on numpy version (GH8844,
    PR8865). By Kai Mühlbauer.

Tue Feb 27 10:56:32 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2024.2.0
  * This release brings size information to the text repr, changes
    to the accepted frequency strings, and various bug fixes.
  ## New Features
  * Added a simple nbytes representation in DataArrays and Dataset
    repr. (GH8690, PR8702). By Etienne Schalk.
  * Allow negative frequency strings (e.g. "-1YE"). These strings
    are for example used in date_range(), and cftime_range()
    (PR8651). By Mathias Hauser.
  * Add NamedArray.expand_dims(), NamedArray.permute_dims() and
    NamedArray.broadcast_to() (PR8380) By Anderson Banihirwe.
  * Xarray now defers to flox’s heuristics to set the default
    method for groupby problems. This only applies to flox>=0.9. By
    Deepak Cherian.
  * All quantile methods (e.g. DataArray.quantile()) now use
    numbagg for the calculation of nanquantiles (i.e., skipna=True)
    if it is installed. This is currently limited to the linear
    interpolation method (method=’linear’). (GH7377, PR8684) By
    Marco Wolsza.
  ## Breaking changes
  * infer_freq() always returns the frequency strings as defined in
    pandas 2.2 (GH8612, PR8627). By Mathias Hauser.
  * Deprecations
  * The dt.weekday_name parameter wasn’t functional on modern
    pandas versions and has been removed. (GH8610, PR8664) By Sam
    Coleman.
  ## Bug fixes
  * Fixed a regression that prevented multi-index level coordinates
    being serialized after resetting or dropping the multi-index
    (GH8628, PR8672). By Benoit Bovy.
  * Fix bug with broadcasting when wrapping array API-compliant
    classes. (GH8665, PR8669) By Tom Nicholas.
  * Ensure DataArray.unstack() works when wrapping array
    API-compliant classes. (GH8666, PR8668) By Tom Nicholas.
  * Fix negative slicing of Zarr arrays without dask installed.
    (GH8252) By Deepak Cherian.
  * Preserve chunks when writing time-like variables to zarr by
    enabling lazy CF encoding of time-like variables (GH7132,
    GH8230, GH8432, PR8575). By Spencer Clark and Mattia Almansi.
  * Preserve chunks when writing time-like variables to zarr by
    enabling their lazy encoding (GH7132, GH8230, GH8432, PR8253,
    PR8575; see also discussion in PR8253). By Spencer Clark and
    Mattia Almansi.
  * Raise an informative error if dtype encoding of time-like
    variables would lead to integer overflow or unsafe conversion
    from floating point to integer values (GH8542, PR8575). By
    Spencer Clark.
  * Raise an error when unstacking a MultiIndex that has duplicates
    as this would lead to silent data loss (GH7104, PR8737). By
    Mathias Hauser.
- Release 2024.1.1
  ## Breaking changes
  * Following pandas, infer_freq() will return "YE", instead of "Y"
    (formerly "A"). This is to be consistent with the deprecation
    of the latter frequency string in pandas 2.2. This is a follow
    up to PR8415 (GH8612, PR8642). By Mathias Hauser.
  ## Deprecations
  * Following pandas, the frequency string "Y" (formerly "A") is
    deprecated in favor of "YE". These strings are used, for
    example, in date_range(), cftime_range(), DataArray.resample(),
    and Dataset.resample() among others (GH8612, PR8629). By
    Mathias Hauser.
- Release 2024.1.0
  * This release brings support for weights in correlation and
    covariance functions, a new DataArray.cumulative aggregation,
    improvements to xr.map_blocks, an update to our minimum
    dependencies, and various bugfixes.
  ## New Features
  * xr.cov() and xr.corr() now support using weights (GH8527,
    PR7392). By Llorenç Lledó.
  * Accept the compression arguments new in netCDF 1.6.0 in the
    netCDF4 backend. See netCDF4 documentation for details. Note
    that some new compression filters needs plugins to be installed
    which may not be available in all netCDF distributions. By
    Markel García-Díez. (GH6929, PR7551)
  * Add DataArray.cumulative() & Dataset.cumulative() to compute
    cumulative aggregations, such as sum, along a dimension — for
    example da.cumulative('time').sum(). This is similar to pandas’
    .expanding, and mostly equivalent to .cumsum methods, or to
    DataArray.rolling() with a window length equal to the dimension
    size. By Maximilian Roos. (PR8512)
  * Decode/Encode netCDF4 enums and store the enum definition in
    dataarrays’ dtype metadata. If multiple variables share the
    same enum in netCDF4, each dataarray will have its own enum
    definition in their respective dtype metadata. By Abel Aoun.
    (GH8144, PR8147)
  ## Deprecations
  * The squeeze kwarg to GroupBy is now deprecated. (GH2157,
    PR8507) By Deepak Cherian.
  ## Bug fixes
  * Support non-string hashable dimensions in xarray.DataArray
    (GH8546, PR8559). By Michael Niklas.
  * Reverse index output of bottleneck’s rolling
    move_argmax/move_argmin functions (GH8541, PR8552). By Kai
    Mühlbauer.
  * Vendor SerializableLock from dask and use as default lock for
    netcdf4 backends (GH8442, PR8571). By Kai Mühlbauer.
  * Add tests and fixes for empty CFTimeIndex, including broken
    html repr (GH7298, PR8600). By Mathias Hauser.

Wed Dec 13 17:02:28 UTC 2023 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 2023.12.0:
 - This release brings new `hypothesis <https://hypothesis.works/>`_ strategies for testing, significantly faster rolling aggregations as well as:
``ffill`` and ``bfill`` with ``numbagg``, a new :py:meth:`Dataset.eval` method, and improvements to
 - reading and writing Zarr arrays (including a new ``"a-"`` mode).:
 - Thanks to our 16 contributors:
 - Anderson Banihirwe, Ben Mares, Carl Andersson, Deepak Cherian, Doug Latornell, Gregorio L. Trevisan, Illviljan, Jens Hedegaard Nielsen, Justus Magin, Mathias Hauser, Max Jones, Maximilian Roos, Michael Niklas, Patrick Hoefler, Ryan Abernathey, Tom Nicholas:
 - New Features:
  - Added hypothesis strategies for generating :py:class:`xarray.Variable` objects containing arbitrary data, useful for parametrizing downstream tests.
    Accessible under :py:mod:`testing.strategies`, and documented in a new page on testing in the User Guide.
    (:issue:`6911`, :pull:`8404`)
    By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
  - :py:meth:`rolling` uses `numbagg <https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg>`_ for
    most of its computations by default. Numbagg is up to 5x faster than bottleneck
    where parallelization is possible. Where parallelization isn't possible — for
    example a 1D array — it's about the same speed as bottleneck, and 2-5x faster
    than pandas' default functions. (:pull:`8493`). numbagg is an optional
    dependency, so requires installing separately.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Use a concise format when plotting datetime arrays. (:pull:`8449`).
    By `Jimmy Westling <https://github.com/illviljan>`_.
  - Avoid overwriting unchanged existing coordinate variables when appending with :py:meth:`Dataset.to_zarr` by setting ``mode='a-'``.
    By `Ryan Abernathey <https://github.com/rabernat>`_ and `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.rank` now operates on dask-backed arrays, assuming
    the core dim has exactly one chunk. (:pull:`8475`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Add a :py:meth:`Dataset.eval` method, similar to the pandas' method of the
    same name. (:pull:`7163`). This is currently marked as experimental and
    doesn't yet support the ``numexpr`` engine.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.drop_vars` & :py:meth:`DataArray.drop_vars` allow passing a
    callable, similar to :py:meth:`Dataset.where` & :py:meth:`Dataset.sortby` & others.
    (:pull:`8511`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
 - Breaking changes:
  - Explicitly warn when creating xarray objects with repeated dimension names.
    Such objects will also now raise when :py:meth:`DataArray.get_axis_num` is called,
    which means many functions will raise.
    This latter change is technically a breaking change, but whilst allowed,
    this behaviour was never actually supported! (:issue:`3731`, :pull:`8491`)
    By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
 - Deprecations:
  - As part of an effort to standardize the API, we're renaming the ``dims``
    keyword arg to ``dim`` for the minority of functions which current use
    ``dims``. This started with :py:func:`xarray.dot` & :py:meth:`DataArray.dot`
    and we'll gradually roll this out across all functions. The warnings are
    currently ``PendingDeprecationWarning``, which are silenced by default. We'll
    convert these to ``DeprecationWarning`` in a future release.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Raise a ``FutureWarning`` warning that the type of :py:meth:`Dataset.dims` will be changed
    from a mapping of dimension names to lengths to a set of dimension names.
    This is to increase consistency with :py:meth:`DataArray.dims`.
    To access a mapping of dimension names to lengths please use :py:meth:`Dataset.sizes`.
    The same change also applies to `DatasetGroupBy.dims`.
    (:issue:`8496`, :pull:`8500`)
    By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.drop` & :py:meth:`DataArray.drop` are now deprecated, since pending deprecation for
    several years. :py:meth:`DataArray.drop_sel` & :py:meth:`DataArray.drop_var`
    replace them for labels & variables respectively. (:pull:`8497`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Fix dtype inference for ``pd.CategoricalIndex`` when categories are backed by a ``pd.ExtensionDtype`` (:pull:`8481`)
  - Fix writing a variable that requires transposing when not writing to a region (:pull:`8484`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Static typing of ``p0`` and ``bounds`` arguments of :py:func:`xarray.DataArray.curvefit` and :py:func:`xarray.Dataset.curvefit`
    was changed to ``Mapping`` (:pull:`8502`).
    By `Michael Niklas <https://github.com/headtr1ck>`_.
  - Fix typing of :py:func:`xarray.DataArray.to_netcdf` and :py:func:`xarray.Dataset.to_netcdf`
    when ``compute`` is evaluated to bool instead of a Literal (:pull:`8268`).
    By `Jens Hedegaard Nielsen <https://github.com/jenshnielsen>`_.
 - Documentation:
  - Added illustration of updating the time coordinate values of a resampled dataset using
    time offset arithmetic.
    This is the recommended technique to replace the use of the deprecated ``loffset`` parameter
    in ``resample`` (:pull:`8479`).
    By `Doug Latornell <https://github.com/douglatornell>`_.
  - Improved error message when attempting to get a variable which doesn't exist from a Dataset.
    (:pull:`8474`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Fix default value of ``combine_attrs`` in :py:func:`xarray.combine_by_coords` (:pull:`8471`)
    By `Gregorio L. Trevisan <https://github.com/gtrevisan>`_.
 - Internal Changes:
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.bfill` & :py:meth:`DataArray.ffill` now use numbagg <https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg>`_ by
    default, which is up to 5x faster where parallelization is possible. (:pull:`8339`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Update mypy version to 1.7 (:issue:`8448`, :pull:`8501`).
    By `Michael Niklas <https://github.com/headtr1ck>`_.
- update to version 2023.11.0:
       `This is our 10th year anniversary release! <https://github.com/pydata/xarray/discussions/8462>`_ Thank you for your love and support.
 - This release brings the ability to use ``opt_einsum`` for :py:func:`xarray.dot` by default,:
 - support for auto-detecting ``region`` when writing partial datasets to Zarr, and the use of h5py:
 - drivers with ``h5netcdf``.:
 - Thanks to the 19 contributors to this release:
 - Aman Bagrecha, Anderson Banihirwe, Ben Mares, Deepak Cherian, Dimitri Papadopoulos Orfanos, Ezequiel Cimadevilla Alvarez,:
 - Illviljan, Justus Magin, Katelyn FitzGerald, Kai Muehlbauer, Martin Durant, Maximilian Roos, Metamess, Sam Levang, Spencer Clark, Tom Nicholas, mgunyho, templiert:
 - New Features:
  - Use `opt_einsum <https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for :py:func:`xarray.dot` by default if installed.
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_. (:issue:`7764`, :pull:`8373`).
  - Add ``DataArray.dt.total_seconds()`` method to match the Pandas API. (:pull:`8435`).
    By `Ben Mares <https://github.com/maresb>`_.
  - Allow passing ``region="auto"`` in  :py:meth:`Dataset.to_zarr` to automatically infer the
    region to write in the original store. Also implement automatic transpose when dimension
    order does not match the original store. (:issue:`7702`, :issue:`8421`, :pull:`8434`).
    By `Sam Levang <https://github.com/slevang>`_.
  - Allow the usage of h5py drivers (eg: ros3) via h5netcdf (:pull:`8360`).
    By `Ezequiel Cimadevilla <https://github.com/zequihg50>`_.
  - Enable VLEN string fill_values, preserve VLEN string dtypes (:issue:`1647`, :issue:`7652`, :issue:`7868`, :pull:`7869`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.
 - Breaking changes:
  - drop support for `cdms2 <https://github.com/CDAT/cdms>`_. Please use
    `xcdat <https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat>`_ instead (:pull:`8441`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Following pandas, :py:meth:`infer_freq` will return ``"Y"``, ``"YS"``,
    ``"QE"``, ``"ME"``, ``"h"``, ``"min"``, ``"s"``, ``"ms"``, ``"us"``, or
    ``"ns"`` instead of ``"A"``, ``"AS"``, ``"Q"``, ``"M"``, ``"H"``, ``"T"``,
    ``"S"``, ``"L"``, ``"U"``, or ``"N"``.  This is to be consistent with the
    deprecation of the latter frequency strings (:issue:`8394`, :pull:`8415`). By
    `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - Bump minimum tested pint version to ``>=0.22``. By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Minimum supported versions for the following packages have changed: ``h5py >=3.7``, ``h5netcdf>=1.1``.
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.
 - Deprecations:
  - The PseudoNetCDF backend has been removed. By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Supplying dimension-ordered sequences to :py:meth:`DataArray.chunk` &
    :py:meth:`Dataset.chunk` is deprecated in favor of supplying a dictionary of
    dimensions, or a single ``int`` or ``"auto"`` argument covering all
    dimensions. Xarray favors using dimensions names rather than positions, and
    this was one place in the API where dimension positions were used.
    (:pull:`8341`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Following pandas, the frequency strings ``"A"``, ``"AS"``, ``"Q"``, ``"M"``,
    ``"H"``, ``"T"``, ``"S"``, ``"L"``, ``"U"``, and ``"N"`` are deprecated in
    favor of ``"Y"``, ``"YS"``, ``"QE"``, ``"ME"``, ``"h"``, ``"min"``, ``"s"``,
    ``"ms"``, ``"us"``, and ``"ns"``, respectively.  These strings are used, for
    example, in :py:func:`date_range`, :py:func:`cftime_range`,
    :py:meth:`DataArray.resample`, and :py:meth:`Dataset.resample` among others
    (:issue:`8394`, :pull:`8415`).  By `Spencer Clark
    <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - Rename :py:meth:`Dataset.to_array` to  :py:meth:`Dataset.to_dataarray` for
    consistency with :py:meth:`DataArray.to_dataset` &
    :py:func:`open_dataarray` functions. This is a "soft" deprecation — the
    existing methods work and don't raise any warnings, given the relatively small
    benefits of the change.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Finally remove ``keep_attrs`` kwarg from :py:meth:`DataArray.resample` and
    :py:meth:`Dataset.resample`. These were deprecated a long time ago.
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Port `bug fix from pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/55283>`_
    to eliminate the adjustment of resample bin edges in the case that the
    resampling frequency has units of days and is greater than one day
    (e.g. ``"2D"``, ``"3D"`` etc.) and the ``closed`` argument is set to
    ``"right"`` to xarray's implementation of resample for data indexed by a
    :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` (:pull:`8393`).
    By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - Fix to once again support date offset strings as input to the loffset
    parameter of resample and test this functionality (:pull:`8422`, :issue:`8399`).

 - This release updates our minimum numpy version in ``pyproject.toml`` to 1.22,:
 - consistent with our documentation below.:
- update to version 2023.10.0:
 - This release brings performance enhancements to reading Zarr datasets, the ability to use `numbagg <https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg>`_ for reductions,:
 - an expansion in API for ``rolling_exp``, fixes two regressions with datetime decoding,:
 - and many other bugfixes and improvements. Groupby reductions will also use ``numbagg`` if ``flox>=0.8.1`` and ``numbagg`` are both installed.:
 - Thanks to our 13 contributors:
 - Anderson Banihirwe, Bart Schilperoort, Deepak Cherian, Illviljan, Kai Mühlbauer, Mathias Hauser, Maximilian Roos, Michael Niklas, Pieter Eendebak, Simon Høxbro Hansen, Spencer Clark, Tom White, olimcc:
 - New Features:
  - Support high-performance reductions with `numbagg <https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg>`_.
    This is enabled by default if ``numbagg`` is installed.
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_. (:pull:`8316`)
  - Add ``corr``, ``cov``, ``std`` & ``var`` to ``.rolling_exp``.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_. (:pull:`8307`)
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.where` & :py:meth:`Dataset.where` accept a callable for
    the ``other`` parameter, passing the object as the only argument. Previously,
    this was only valid for the ``cond`` parameter. (:issue:`8255`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - ``.rolling_exp`` functions can now take a ``min_weight`` parameter, to only
    output values when there are sufficient recent non-nan values.
    ``numbagg>=0.3.1`` is required. (:pull:`8285`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.sortby` & :py:meth:`Dataset.sortby` accept a callable for
    the ``variables`` parameter, passing the object as the only argument.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - ``.rolling_exp`` functions can now operate on dask-backed arrays, assuming the
    core dim has exactly one chunk. (:pull:`8284`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
 - Breaking changes:
  - Made more arguments keyword-only (e.g. ``keep_attrs``, ``skipna``) for many :py:class:`xarray.DataArray` and
    :py:class:`xarray.Dataset` methods (:pull:`6403`). By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.to_zarr` & :py:meth:`DataArray.to_zarr` require keyword
    arguments after the initial 7 positional arguments.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
 - Deprecations:
  - Rename :py:meth:`Dataset.reset_encoding` & :py:meth:`DataArray.reset_encoding`
    to :py:meth:`Dataset.drop_encoding` & :py:meth:`DataArray.drop_encoding` for
    consistency with other ``drop`` & ``reset`` methods — ``drop`` generally
    removes something, while ``reset`` generally resets to some default or
    standard value. (:pull:`8287`, :issue:`8259`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.rename` & :py:meth:`Dataset.rename` would emit a warning
    when the operation was a no-op. (:issue:`8266`)
    By `Simon Hansen <https://github.com/hoxbro>`_.
  - Fixed a regression introduced in the previous release checking time-like units
    when encoding/decoding masked data (:issue:`8269`, :pull:`8277`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.
  - Fix datetime encoding precision loss regression introduced in the previous
    release for datetimes encoded with units requiring floating point values, and
    a reference date not equal to the first value of the datetime array
    (:issue:`8271`, :pull:`8272`). By `Spencer Clark
    <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - Fix excess metadata requests when using a Zarr store. Prior to this, metadata
    was re-read every time data was retrieved from the array, now metadata is retrieved only once
    when they array is initialized.
    (:issue:`8290`, :pull:`8297`).
    By `Oliver McCormack <https://github.com/olimcc>`_.
  - Fix to_zarr ending in a ReadOnlyError when consolidated metadata was used and the
    write_empty_chunks was provided.
    (:issue:`8323`, :pull:`8326`)
    By `Matthijs Amesz <https://github.com/Metamess>`_.
 - Documentation:
  - Added page on the interoperability of xarray objects.
    (:pull:`7992`) By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
  - Added xarray-regrid to the list of xarray related projects (:pull:`8272`).

    by using duck array ops in more places in the codebase. (:pull:`8267`)
    By `Tom White <https://github.com/tomwhite>`_.
- update to version 2023.09.0:
 - This release continues work on the new :py:class:`xarray.Coordinates` object, allows to provide `preferred_chunks` when:
 - reading from netcdf files, enables :py:func:`xarray.apply_ufunc` to handle missing core dimensions and fixes several bugs.:
 - Thanks to the 24 contributors to this release: Alexander Fischer, Amrest Chinkamol, Benoit Bovy, Darsh Ranjan, Deepak Cherian,:
 - Gianfranco Costamagna, Gregorio L. Trevisan, Illviljan, Joe Hamman, JR, Justus Magin, Kai Mühlbauer, Kian-Meng Ang, Kyle Sunden,:
 - Martin Raspaud, Mathias Hauser, Mattia Almansi, Maximilian Roos, András Gunyhó, Michael Niklas, Richard Kleijn, Riulinchen,:
 - Tom Nicholas and Wiktor Kraśnicki.:
 - We welcome the following new contributors to Xarray!: Alexander Fischer, Amrest Chinkamol, Darsh Ranjan, Gianfranco Costamagna, Gregorio L. Trevisan,:
 - Kian-Meng Ang, Riulinchen and Wiktor Kraśnicki.:
 - New Features:
  - Added the :py:meth:`Coordinates.assign` method that can be used to combine
    different collections of coordinates prior to assign them to a Dataset or
    DataArray (:pull:`8102`) at once.
    By `Benoît Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.
  - Provide `preferred_chunks` for data read from netcdf files (:issue:`1440`, :pull:`7948`).
    By `Martin Raspaud <https://github.com/mraspaud>`_.
  - Added `on_missing_core_dims` to :py:meth:`apply_ufunc` to allow for copying or
    dropping a :py:class:`Dataset`'s variables with missing core dimensions (:pull:`8138`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
 - Breaking changes:
  - The :py:class:`Coordinates` constructor now creates a (pandas) index by
    default for each dimension coordinate. To keep the previous behavior (no index
    created), pass an empty dictionary to ``indexes``. The constructor now also
    extracts and add the indexes from another :py:class:`Coordinates` object
    passed via ``coords`` (:pull:`8107`).
    By `Benoît Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.
  - Static typing of ``xlim`` and ``ylim`` arguments in plotting functions now must
    be ``tuple[float, float]`` to align with matplotlib requirements. (:issue:`7802`, :pull:`8030`).
    By `Michael Niklas <https://github.com/headtr1ck>`_.
 - Deprecations:
  - Deprecate passing a :py:class:`pandas.MultiIndex` object directly to the
    :py:class:`Dataset` and :py:class:`DataArray` constructors as well as to
    :py:meth:`Dataset.assign` and :py:meth:`Dataset.assign_coords`.
    A new Xarray :py:class:`Coordinates` object has to be created first using
    :py:meth:`Coordinates.from_pandas_multiindex` (:pull:`8094`).
    By `Benoît Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Improved static typing of reduction methods (:pull:`6746`).
    By `Richard Kleijn <https://github.com/rhkleijn>`_.
  - Fix bug where empty attrs would generate inconsistent tokens (:issue:`6970`, :pull:`8101`).
    By `Mattia Almansi <https://github.com/malmans2>`_.
  - Improved handling of multi-coordinate indexes when updating coordinates, including bug fixes
    (and improved warnings for deprecated features) for pandas multi-indexes (:pull:`8094`).
    By `Benoît Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.
  - Fixed a bug in :py:func:`merge` with ``compat='minimal'`` where the coordinate
    names were not updated properly internally (:issue:`7405`, :issue:`7588`,
    :pull:`8104`).
    By `Benoît Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.
  - Fix bug where :py:class:`DataArray` instances on the right-hand side
    of :py:meth:`DataArray.__setitem__` lose dimension names (:issue:`7030`, :pull:`8067`).
    By `Darsh Ranjan <https://github.com/dranjan>`_.
  - Return ``float64`` in presence of ``NaT`` in :py:class:`~core.accessor_dt.DatetimeAccessor` and
    special case ``NaT`` handling in :py:meth:`~core.accessor_dt.DatetimeAccessor.isocalendar`
    (:issue:`7928`, :pull:`8084`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.
  - Fix :py:meth:`~core.rolling.DatasetRolling.construct` with stride on Datasets without indexes.
    (:issue:`7021`, :pull:`7578`).
    By `Amrest Chinkamol <https://github.com/p4perf4ce>`_ and `Michael Niklas <https://github.com/headtr1ck>`_.
  - Calling plot with kwargs ``col``, ``row`` or ``hue`` no longer squeezes dimensions passed via these arguments
    (:issue:`7552`, :pull:`8174`).
    By `Wiktor Kraśnicki <https://github.com/wkrasnicki>`_.
  - Fixed a bug where casting from ``float`` to ``int64`` (undefined for ``NaN``) led to varying issues (:issue:`7817`, :issue:`7942`, :issue:`7790`, :issue:`6191`, :issue:`7096`,
    :issue:`1064`, :pull:`7827`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.
  - Fixed a bug where inaccurate ``coordinates`` silently failed to decode variable (:issue:`1809`, :pull:`8195`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_
  - ``.rolling_exp`` functions no longer mistakenly lose non-dimensioned coords
    (:issue:`6528`, :pull:`8114`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - In the event that user-provided datetime64/timedelta64 units and integer dtype encoding parameters conflict with each other, override the units to preserve an integer dtype for most faithful serialization to disk (:issue:`1064`, :pull:`8201`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.
  - Static typing of dunder ops methods (like :py:meth:`DataArray.__eq__`) has been fixed.
    Remaining issues are upstream problems (:issue:`7780`, :pull:`8204`).
    By `Michael Niklas <https://github.com/headtr1ck>`_.
  - Fix type annotation for ``center`` argument of plotting methods (like :py:meth:`xarray.plot.dataarray_plot.pcolormesh`) (:pull:`8261`).

    By `Riulinchen <https://github.com/Riulinchen>`_.
 - Internal Changes:
  - Many error messages related to invalid dimensions or coordinates now always show the list of valid dims/coords (:pull:`8079`).
    By `András Gunyhó <https://github.com/mgunyho>`_.
  - Refactor of encoding and decoding times/timedeltas to preserve nanosecond resolution in arrays that contain missing values (:pull:`7827`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.
  - Transition ``.rolling_exp`` functions to use `.apply_ufunc` internally rather
    than `.reduce`, as the start of a broader effort to move non-reducing
    functions away from ```.reduce``, (:pull:`8114`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Test range of fill_value's in test_interpolate_pd_compat (:issue:`8146`, :pull:`8189`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.

 - Deprecations:
  - Following pandas, the `closed` parameters of :py:func:`cftime_range` and
    :py:func:`date_range` are deprecated in favor of the `inclusive` parameters,
    and will be removed in a future version of xarray (:issue:`6985`:,
    :pull:`7373`).

    see just a sample of the data. (GH6722, PR7203). By Jimmy
    Westling.
  * Many arguments of plotmethods have been made keyword-only.
  * xarray.plot.plot module renamed to xarray.plot.dataarray_plot
    to prevent shadowing of the plot method. (GH6949, PR7052). By
    Michael Niklas.
  ## Deprecations
  * Positional arguments for all plot methods have been deprecated
    (GH6949, PR7052). By Michael Niklas.
  * xarray.plot.FacetGrid.axes has been renamed to
    xarray.plot.FacetGrid.axs because it’s not clear if axes refers
    to single or multiple Axes instances. This aligns with
    matplotlib.pyplot.subplots. (PR7194) By Jimmy Westling.
  ## Bug fixes
  * Explicitly opening a file multiple times (e.g., after modifying
    it on disk) now reopens the file from scratch for h5netcdf and
    scipy netCDF backends, rather than reusing a cached version
    (GH4240, GH4862). By Stephan Hoyer.
  * Fixed bug where Dataset.coarsen.construct() would demote
    non-dimension coordinates to variables. (PR7233) By Tom
    Nicholas.
  * Raise a TypeError when trying to plot empty data (GH7156,
    PR7228). By Michael Niklas.
  ## Internal Changes
  * Doctests fail on any warnings (PR7166) By Maximilian Roos.
  * Improve import time by lazy loading dask.distributed (:pull:
    7172).
  * Explicitly specify longdouble=False in cftime.date2num() when
    encoding times to preserve existing behavior and prevent future
    errors when it is eventually set to True by default in cftime
    (PR7171). By Spencer Clark.
  * Improved import time by lazily importing backend modules,
    matplotlib, dask.array and flox. (GH6726, PR7179) By Michael
    Niklas.
  * Emit a warning under the development version of pandas when we
    convert non-nanosecond precision datetime or timedelta values
    to nanosecond precision. This was required in the past, because
    pandas previously was not compatible with non-nanosecond
    precision values. However pandas is currently working towards
    removing this restriction. When things stabilize in pandas we
    will likely consider relaxing this behavior in xarray as well
    (GH7175, PR7201). By Spencer Clark.

    + Accommodate newly raised OutOfBoundsTimedelta error in the
      development version of pandas when decoding times outside the
      range that can be represented with nanosecond-precision values
      (GH6716, PR6717). By Spencer Clark.
    + open_dataset() with dask and ~ in the path now resolves the home
      directory instead of raising an error. (GH6707, PR6710) By
      Michael Niklas.
    + DataArrayRolling.__iter__() with center=True now works
      correctly. (GH6739, PR6744) By Michael Niklas.
  * Internal Changes
    + xarray.core.groupby, xarray.core.rolling,
      xarray.core.rolling_exp, xarray.core.weighted and

      DataArrayWeighted (PR6059). By Christian Jauvin and David Huard.
    + Add a create_index=True parameter to Dataset.stack() and
      DataArray.stack() so that the creation of multi-indexes is
      optional (PR5692). By Benoît Bovy.
    + Multi-index levels are now accessible through their own, regular
      coordinates instead of virtual coordinates (PR5692). By Benoît
      Bovy.
    + Add a display_values_threshold option to control the total
      number of array elements which trigger summarization rather than
      full repr in (numpy) array detailed views of the html repr
      (PR6400). By Benoît Bovy.
    + Allow passing chunks in kwargs form to Dataset.chunk(),
      DataArray.chunk(), and Variable.chunk(). (PR6471) By Tom
      Nicholas.
    + Add core.groupby.DatasetGroupBy.cumsum() and
      core.groupby.DataArrayGroupBy.cumsum(). By Vladislav Skripniuk
      and Deepak Cherian. (PR3147, PR6525, GH3141)
    + Expose inline_array kwarg from dask.array.from_array in

    + Many arguments like keep_attrs, axis, and skipna are now keyword
      only for all reduction operations like .mean. By Deepak Cherian,
      Jimmy Westling.
    + Xarray’s ufuncs have been removed, now that they can be replaced
      by numpy’s ufuncs in all supported versions of numpy. By
      Maximilian Roos.
    + xr.polyval() now uses the coord argument directly instead of its
      index coordinate. (PR6548) By Michael Niklas.
  * Bug fixes
    + Dataset.to_zarr() now allows to write all attribute types
      supported by zarr-python. By Mattia Almansi.
    + Set skipna=None for all quantile methods
      (e.g. Dataset.quantile()) and ensure it skips missing values for
      float dtypes (consistent with other methods). This should not
      change the behavior (PR6303). By Mathias Hauser.

      to multi-index (virtual) coordinates. See the corresponding
      pull-request on GitHub for more details. (PR5692). By Benoît
      Bovy.

      disk when the underlying array is empty (e.g., because of an
      empty dimension) (GH6401). By Joseph K Aicher.
    + Fixed the poor html repr performance on large multi-indexes
      (PR6400). By Benoît Bovy.
    + Allow fancy indexing of duck dask arrays along multiple
      dimensions. (PR6414) By Justus Magin.
    + In the API for backends, support dimensions that express their
      preferred chunk sizes as a tuple of integers. (GH6333, PR6334)
      By Stan West.
    + Fix bug in where() when passing non-xarray objects with
      keep_attrs=True. (GH6444, PR6461) By Sam Levang.
    + Allow passing both other and drop=True arguments to
      DataArray.where() and Dataset.where() (PR6466, PR6467). By
      Michael Delgado.
    + Ensure dtype encoding attributes are not added or modified on

      syntax and replace lists with tuples in the examples. (GH6333,
      PR6334) By Stan West.
    + Mention that DataArray.rename() can rename coordinates. (GH5458,
      PR6665) By Michael Niklas.
    + Added examples to Dataset.thin() and DataArray.thin() By Emma
      Marshall.
  * Performance
    + GroupBy binary operations are now vectorized. Previously this
      involved looping over all groups. (GH5804, PR6160) By Deepak
      Cherian.
    + Substantially improved GroupBy operations using flox. This is
      auto-enabled when flox is installed. Use
      xr.set_options(use_flox=False) to use the old
      algorithm. (GH4473, GH4498, GH659, GH2237, PR271). By Deepak
      Cherian, Anderson Banihirwe, Jimmy Westling.

 - Julius Busecke, keewis, Mathias Hauser, Matthias Göbel, Mattia Almansi, Maximilian Roos, Peter Andreas Entschev,:
 - Ray Bell, Sander, Santiago Soler, Sebastian, Spencer Clark, Stephan Hoyer, Thomas Hirtz, Thomas Nicholas.:
 - New Features:
  - Allow passing argument ``missing_dims`` to :py:meth:`Variable.transpose` and :py:meth:`Dataset.transpose`
    (:issue:`5550`, :pull:`5586`)
    By `Giacomo Caria <https://github.com/gcaria>`_.
  - Allow passing a dictionary as coords to a :py:class:`DataArray` (:issue:`5527`,
    reverts :pull:`1539`, which had deprecated this due to python's inconsistent ordering in earlier versions).
    By `Sander van Rijn <https://github.com/sjvrijn>`_.
  - Added :py:meth:`Dataset.coarsen.construct`, :py:meth:`DataArray.coarsen.construct` (:issue:`5454`, :pull:`5475`).
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Xarray now uses consolidated metadata by default when writing and reading Zarr
    stores (:issue:`5251`).
    By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.
  - New top-level function :py:func:`unify_chunks`.
    By `Mattia Almansi <https://github.com/malmans2>`_.
  - Allow assigning values to a subset of a dataset using positional or label-based
    indexing (:issue:`3015`, :pull:`5362`).
    By `Matthias Göbel <https://github.com/matzegoebel>`_.
  - Attempting to reduce a weighted object over missing dimensions now raises an error (:pull:`5362`).
    By `Mattia Almansi <https://github.com/malmans2>`_.
  - Add ``.sum`` to :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.rolling_exp` and
    :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.rolling_exp` for exponentially weighted rolling
    sums. These require numbagg 0.2.1;
    (:pull:`5178`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - :py:func:`xarray.cov` and :py:func:`xarray.corr` now lazily check for missing
    values if inputs are dask arrays (:issue:`4804`, :pull:`5284`).
    By `Andrew Williams <https://github.com/AndrewWilliams3142>`_.
  - Attempting to ``concat`` list of elements that are not all ``Dataset`` or all ``DataArray`` now raises an error (:issue:`5051`, :pull:`5425`).
    By `Thomas Hirtz <https://github.com/thomashirtz>`_.
  - allow passing a function to ``combine_attrs`` (:pull:`4896`).

  - Units in plot labels are now automatically inferred from wrapped :py:meth:`pint.Quantity` arrays. (:pull:`5561`).
    By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
 - Breaking changes:
  - The default ``mode`` for :py:meth:`Dataset.to_zarr` when ``region`` is set
    has changed to the new ``mode="r+"``, which only allows for overriding
    pre-existing array values. This is a safer default than the prior ``mode="a"``,
    and allows for higher performance writes (:pull:`5252`).
    By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.
  - The main parameter to :py:func:`combine_by_coords` is renamed to `data_objects` instead
    of `datasets` so anyone calling this method using a named parameter will need to update
    the name accordingly (:issue:`3248`, :pull:`4696`).

 - Deprecations:
  - Removed the deprecated ``dim`` kwarg to :py:func:`DataArray.integrate` (:pull:`5630`)
  - Removed the deprecated ``keep_attrs`` kwarg to :py:func:`DataArray.rolling` (:pull:`5630`)
  - Removed the deprecated ``keep_attrs`` kwarg to :py:func:`DataArray.coarsen` (:pull:`5630`)
  - Completed deprecation of passing an ``xarray.DataArray`` to :py:func:`Variable` - will now raise a ``TypeError`` (:pull:`5630`)
 - Bug fixes:
  - Fix a minor incompatibility between partial datetime string indexing with a
    :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` and upcoming pandas version 1.3.0 (:issue:`5356`,
    :pull:`5359`).
    By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - Fix 1-level multi-index incorrectly converted to single index (:issue:`5384`,
    :pull:`5385`).
    By `Benoit Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.
  - Don't cast a duck array in a coordinate to :py:class:`numpy.ndarray` in
    :py:meth:`DataArray.differentiate` (:pull:`5408`)
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Fix the ``repr`` of :py:class:`Variable` objects with ``display_expand_data=True``
    (:pull:`5406`)
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Plotting a pcolormesh with ``xscale="log"`` and/or ``yscale="log"`` works as
    expected after improving the way the interval breaks are generated (:issue:`5333`).
    By `Santiago Soler <https://github.com/santisoler>`_
  - :py:func:`combine_by_coords` can now handle combining a list of unnamed
    ``DataArray`` as input (:issue:`3248`, :pull:`4696`).
    By `Augustus Ijams <https://github.com/aijams>`_.
 - Internal Changes:
  - Run CI on the first & last python versions supported only; currently 3.7 & 3.9.
    (:pull:`5433`)

    (:pull:`5537`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Explicit indexes refactor: add a ``xarray.Index.query()`` method in which
    one may eventually provide a custom implementation of label-based data
    selection (not ready yet for public use). Also refactor the internal,
    pandas-specific implementation into ``PandasIndex.query()`` and
    ``PandasMultiIndex.query()`` (:pull:`5322`).
    By `Benoit Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.

 - a plugin API to add backend engines, a new theme for the documentation,:
 - curve fitting methods, and several new plotting functions.:
 - Many thanks to the 38 contributors to this release: Aaron Spring, Alessandro Amici,:
 - Alex Marandon, Alistair Miles, Ana Paula Krelling, Anderson Banihirwe, Aureliana Barghini,:
 - Baudouin Raoult, Benoit Bovy, Blair Bonnett, David Trémouilles, Deepak Cherian,:
 - Gabriel Medeiros Abrahão, Giacomo Caria, Hauke Schulz, Illviljan, Mathias Hauser, Matthias Bussonnier,:
 - Mattia Almansi, Maximilian Roos, Ray Bell, Richard Kleijn, Ryan Abernathey, Sam Levang, Spencer Clark,:
 - Spencer Jones, Tammas Loughran, Tobias Kölling, Todd, Tom Nicholas, Tom White, Victor Negîrneac,:
 - Xianxiang Li, Zeb Nicholls, crusaderky, dschwoerer, johnomotani, keewis:
 - New Features:
  - apply ``combine_attrs`` on data variables and coordinate variables when concatenating
    and merging datasets and dataarrays (:pull:`4902`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Add :py:meth:`Dataset.to_pandas` (:pull:`5247`)
    By `Giacomo Caria <https://github.com/gcaria>`_.
  - Add :py:meth:`DataArray.plot.surface` which wraps matplotlib's `plot_surface` to make
    surface plots (:issue:`2235` :issue:`5084` :pull:`5101`).
    By `John Omotani <https://github.com/johnomotani>`_.
  - Allow passing multiple arrays to :py:meth:`Dataset.__setitem__` (:pull:`5216`).
    By `Giacomo Caria <https://github.com/gcaria>`_.
  - Add 'cumulative' option to :py:meth:`Dataset.integrate` and
    :py:meth:`DataArray.integrate` so that result is a cumulative integral, like
    :py:func:`scipy.integrate.cumulative_trapezoidal` (:pull:`5153`).
    By `John Omotani <https://github.com/johnomotani>`_.
  - Add ``safe_chunks`` option to :py:meth:`Dataset.to_zarr` which allows overriding
    checks made to ensure Dask and Zarr chunk compatibility (:issue:`5056`).
    By `Ryan Abernathey <https://github.com/rabernat>`_
  - Add :py:meth:`Dataset.query` and :py:meth:`DataArray.query` which enable indexing
    of datasets and data arrays by evaluating query expressions against the values of the
    data variables (:pull:`4984`).
    By `Alistair Miles <https://github.com/alimanfoo>`_.
  - Allow passing ``combine_attrs`` to :py:meth:`Dataset.merge` (:pull:`4895`).

    variables (:pull:`5003`).
    By `John Omotani <https://github.com/johnomotani>`_.
  - Many of the arguments for the :py:attr:`DataArray.str` methods now support
    providing an array-like input. In this case, the array provided to the
    arguments is broadcast against the original array and applied elementwise.
  - :py:attr:`DataArray.str` now supports ``+``, ``*``, and ``%`` operators. These
    behave the same as they do for :py:class:`str`, except that they follow
    array broadcasting rules.
  - A large number of new :py:attr:`DataArray.str` methods were implemented,
    :py:meth:`DataArray.str.casefold`, :py:meth:`DataArray.str.cat`,
    :py:meth:`DataArray.str.extract`, :py:meth:`DataArray.str.extractall`,
    :py:meth:`DataArray.str.findall`, :py:meth:`DataArray.str.format`,
    :py:meth:`DataArray.str.get_dummies`, :py:meth:`DataArray.str.islower`,

    :py:meth:`DataArray.str.partition`, :py:meth:`DataArray.str.rpartition`,
    :py:meth:`DataArray.str.rsplit`, and  :py:meth:`DataArray.str.split`.
    A number of these methods allow for splitting or joining the strings in an
    array. (:issue:`4622`)
    By `Todd Jennings <https://github.com/toddrjen>`_
  - Thanks to the new pluggable backend infrastructure external packages may now
    use the ``xarray.backends`` entry point to register additional engines to be used in
    :py:func:`open_dataset`, see the documentation in :ref:`add_a_backend`
    (:issue:`4309`, :issue:`4803`, :pull:`4989`, :pull:`4810` and many others).
    The backend refactor has been sponsored with the "Essential Open Source Software for Science"
    grant from the `Chan Zuckerberg Initiative <https://chanzuckerberg.com>`_ and
    developed by `B-Open <https://www.bopen.eu>`_.
    By `Aureliana Barghini <https://github.com/aurghs>`_ and `Alessandro Amici <https://github.com/alexamici>`_.

    :py:class:`~core.groupby.DataArrayGroupBy`, inspired by pandas'
    :py:meth:`~pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.get_group`.
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Switch the tutorial functions to use `pooch <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch>`_
    (which is now a optional dependency) and add :py:func:`tutorial.open_rasterio` as a
    way to open example rasterio files (:issue:`3986`, :pull:`4102`, :pull:`5074`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Add typing information to unary and binary arithmetic operators operating on
    :py:class:`Dataset`, :py:class:`DataArray`, :py:class:`Variable`,
    :py:class:`~core.groupby.DatasetGroupBy` or
    :py:class:`~core.groupby.DataArrayGroupBy` (:pull:`4904`).
    By `Richard Kleijn <https://github.com/rhkleijn>`_.
  - Add a ``combine_attrs`` parameter to :py:func:`open_mfdataset` (:pull:`4971`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Enable passing arrays with a subset of dimensions to
    :py:meth:`DataArray.clip` & :py:meth:`Dataset.clip`; these methods now use
    :py:func:`xarray.apply_ufunc`; (:pull:`5184`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Disable the `cfgrib` backend if the `eccodes` library is not installed (:pull:`5083`).
    By `Baudouin Raoult <https://github.com/b8raoult>`_.
  - Added :py:meth:`DataArray.curvefit` and :py:meth:`Dataset.curvefit` for general curve fitting applications. (:issue:`4300`, :pull:`4849`)
    By `Sam Levang <https://github.com/slevang>`_.
  - Add options to control expand/collapse of sections in display of Dataset and
    DataArray. The function :py:func:`set_options` now takes keyword aguments
    ``display_expand_attrs``, ``display_expand_coords``, ``display_expand_data``,
    ``display_expand_data_vars``, all of which can be one of ``True`` to always
    expand, ``False`` to always collapse, or ``default`` to expand unless over a
    pre-defined limit (:pull:`5126`).
    By `Tom White <https://github.com/tomwhite>`_.
  - Significant speedups in :py:meth:`Dataset.interp` and :py:meth:`DataArray.interp`.
    (:issue:`4739`, :pull:`4740`).
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Prevent passing `concat_dim` to :py:func:`xarray.open_mfdataset` when
    `combine='by_coords'` is specified, which should never have been possible (as
    :py:func:`xarray.combine_by_coords` has no `concat_dim` argument to pass to).
    Also removes unneeded internal reordering of datasets in
    :py:func:`xarray.open_mfdataset` when `combine='by_coords'` is specified.
    Fixes (:issue:`5230`).
    By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
  - Implement ``__setitem__`` for ``xarray.core.indexing.DaskIndexingAdapter`` if
    dask version supports item assignment. (:issue:`5171`, :pull:`5174`)
    By `Tammas Loughran <https://github.com/tammasloughran>`_.
 - Breaking changes:
  - The minimum versions of some dependencies were changed:
    ============ ====== ====
    Package      Old    New
    ============ ====== ====
    boto3        1.12   1.13
    cftime       1.0    1.1
    dask         2.11   2.15
    distributed  2.11   2.15
    matplotlib   3.1    3.2
    numba        0.48   0.49
    ============ ====== ====
  - :py:func:`open_dataset` and :py:func:`open_dataarray` now accept only the first argument
    as positional, all others need to be passed are keyword arguments. This is part of the
    refactor to support external backends (:issue:`4309`, :pull:`4989`).
    By `Alessandro Amici <https://github.com/alexamici>`_.
  - Functions that are identities for 0d data return the unchanged data
    if axis is empty. This ensures that Datasets where some variables do
    not have the averaged dimensions are not accidentially changed
    (:issue:`4885`, :pull:`5207`).
    By `David Schwörer <https://github.com/dschwoerer>`_.
  - :py:attr:`DataArray.coarsen` and :py:attr:`Dataset.coarsen` no longer support passing ``keep_attrs``
    via its constructor. Pass ``keep_attrs`` via the applied function, i.e. use
    ``ds.coarsen(...).mean(keep_attrs=False)`` instead of ``ds.coarsen(..., keep_attrs=False).mean()``.
    Further, coarsen now keeps attributes per default (:pull:`5227`).
    By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
  - switch the default of the :py:func:`merge` ``combine_attrs`` parameter to
    ``"override"``. This will keep the current behavior for merging the ``attrs`` of
    variables but stop dropping the ``attrs`` of the main objects (:pull:`4902`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
 - Deprecations:
  - Warn when passing `concat_dim` to :py:func:`xarray.open_mfdataset` when
    `combine='by_coords'` is specified, which should never have been possible (as
    :py:func:`xarray.combine_by_coords` has no `concat_dim` argument to pass to).
    Also removes unneeded internal reordering of datasets in
    :py:func:`xarray.open_mfdataset` when `combine='by_coords'` is specified.
    Fixes (:issue:`5230`), via (:pull:`5231`, :pull:`5255`).
    By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
  - The `lock` keyword argument to :py:func:`open_dataset` and :py:func:`open_dataarray` is now
    a backend specific option. It will give a warning if passed to a backend that doesn't support it
    instead of being silently ignored. From the next version it will raise an error.
    This is part of the refactor to support external backends (:issue:`5073`).
    By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_ and `Alessandro Amici <https://github.com/alexamici>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Properly support :py:meth:`DataArray.ffill`, :py:meth:`DataArray.bfill`, :py:meth:`Dataset.ffill`, :py:meth:`Dataset.bfill` along chunked dimensions.
    (:issue:`2699`).
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Fix 2d plot failure for certain combinations of dimensions when `x` is 1d and `y` is
    2d (:issue:`5097`, :pull:`5099`).
    By `John Omotani <https://github.com/johnomotani>`_.
  - Ensure standard calendar times encoded with large values (i.e. greater than
    approximately 292 years), can be decoded correctly without silently overflowing
    (:pull:`5050`).  This was a regression in xarray 0.17.0.
    By `Zeb Nicholls <https://github.com/znicholls>`_.
  - Added support for `numpy.bool_` attributes in roundtrips using `h5netcdf` engine with `invalid_netcdf=True` [which casts `bool`s to `numpy.bool_`] (:issue:`4981`, :pull:`4986`).
    By `Victor Negîrneac <https://github.com/caenrigen>`_.
  - Don't allow passing ``axis`` to :py:meth:`Dataset.reduce` methods (:issue:`3510`, :pull:`4940`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Decode values as signed if attribute `_Unsigned = "false"` (:issue:`4954`)
    By `Tobias Kölling <https://github.com/d70-t>`_.
  - Keep coords attributes when interpolating when the indexer is not a Variable. (:issue:`4239`, :issue:`4839` :pull:`5031`)
    By `Jimmy Westling <https://github.com/illviljan>`_.
  - Ensure standard calendar dates encoded with a calendar attribute with some or
    all uppercase letters can be decoded or encoded to or from
    ``np.datetime64[ns]`` dates with or without ``cftime`` installed
    (:issue:`5093`, :pull:`5180`).  By `Spencer Clark
    <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - Warn on passing ``keep_attrs`` to ``resample`` and ``rolling_exp`` as they are ignored, pass ``keep_attrs``
    to the applied function instead (:pull:`5265`).  By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
    (:issue:`5093`, :pull:`5180`).
    By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
 - Documentation:
  - New section on :ref:`add_a_backend` in the "Internals" chapter aimed to backend developers
    (:issue:`4803`, :pull:`4810`).
    By `Aureliana Barghini <https://github.com/aurghs>`_.
  - Add :py:meth:`Dataset.polyfit` and :py:meth:`DataArray.polyfit` under "See also" in
    the docstrings of :py:meth:`Dataset.polyfit` and :py:meth:`DataArray.polyfit`
    (:issue:`5016`, :pull:`5020`).

Sat Feb 27 14:38:41 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 0.17.0:
 - This release brings a few important performance improvements, a wide range of:
 - usability upgrades, lots of bug fixes, and some new features. These include:
 - better ``cftime`` support, a new quiver plot, better ``unstack`` performance,:
 - more efficient memory use in rolling operations, and some python packaging:
 - improvements. We also have a few documentation improvements (and more planned!).:
 - Many thanks to the 36 contributors to this release: Alessandro Amici, Anderson:
 - Banihirwe, Aureliana Barghini, Ayrton Bourn, Benjamin Bean, Blair Bonnett, Chun:
 - Ho Chow, DWesl, Daniel Mesejo-León, Deepak Cherian, Eric Keenan, Illviljan, Jens:
 - Hedegaard Nielsen, Jody Klymak, Julien Seguinot, Julius Busecke, Kai Mühlbauer,:
 - Leif Denby, Martin Durant, Mathias Hauser, Maximilian Roos, Michael Mann, Ray:
 - Bell, RichardScottOZ, Spencer Clark, Tim Gates, Tom Nicholas, Yunus Sevinchan,:
 - alexamici, aurghs, crusaderky, dcherian, ghislainp, keewis, rhkleijn:
 - Breaking changes:
  - xarray no longer supports python 3.6
    The minimum version policy was changed to also apply to projects with irregular
    releases. As a result, the minimum versions of some dependencies have changed:
    ============ ====== ====
    Package      Old    New
    ============ ====== ====
    Python       3.6    3.7
    setuptools   38.4   40.4
    numpy        1.15   1.17
    pandas       0.25   1.0
    dask         2.9    2.11
    distributed  2.9    2.11
    bottleneck   1.2    1.3
    h5netcdf     0.7    0.8
    iris         2.2    2.4
    netcdf4      1.4    1.5
    pseudonetcdf 3.0    3.1
    rasterio     1.0    1.1
    scipy        1.3    1.4
    seaborn      0.9    0.10
    zarr         2.3    2.4
    ============ ====== ====
    (:issue:`4688`, :pull:`4720`, :pull:`4907`, :pull:`4942`)
  - As a result of :pull:`4684` the default units encoding for
    datetime-like values (``np.datetime64[ns]`` or ``cftime.datetime``) will now
    always be set such that ``int64`` values can be used.  In the past, no units
    finer than "seconds" were chosen, which would sometimes mean that ``float64``
    values were required, which would lead to inaccurate I/O round-trips.
  - Variables referred to in attributes like ``bounds`` and ``grid_mapping``
    can be set as coordinate variables. These attributes are moved to
    :py:attr:`DataArray.encoding` from :py:attr:`DataArray.attrs`. This behaviour
    is controlled by the ``decode_coords`` kwarg to :py:func:`open_dataset` and
    :py:func:`open_mfdataset`.  The full list of decoded attributes is in
    :ref:`weather-climate` (:pull:`2844`, :issue:`3689`)
  - As a result of :pull:`4911` the output from calling :py:meth:`DataArray.sum`
    or :py:meth:`DataArray.prod` on an integer array with ``skipna=True`` and a
    non-None value for ``min_count`` will now be a float array rather than an
    integer array.
 - Deprecations:
  - ``dim`` argument to :py:meth:`DataArray.integrate` is being deprecated in
    favour of a ``coord`` argument, for consistency with :py:meth:`Dataset.integrate`.
    For now using ``dim`` issues a ``FutureWarning``. It will be removed in
    version 0.19.0 (:pull:`3993`).
    By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
  - Deprecated ``autoclose`` kwargs from :py:func:`open_dataset` are removed (:pull:`4725`).
    By `Aureliana Barghini <https://github.com/aurghs>`_.
  - the return value of :py:meth:`Dataset.update` is being deprecated to make it work more
    like :py:meth:`dict.update`. It will be removed in version 0.19.0 (:pull:`4932`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
 - New Features:
  - :py:meth:`~xarray.cftime_range` and :py:meth:`DataArray.resample` now support
    millisecond (``"L"`` or ``"ms"``) and microsecond (``"U"`` or ``"us"``) frequencies
    for ``cftime.datetime`` coordinates (:issue:`4097`, :pull:`4758`).
    By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - Significantly higher ``unstack`` performance on numpy-backed arrays which
    contain missing values; 8x faster than previous versions in our benchmark, and
    now 2x faster than pandas (:pull:`4746`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Add :py:meth:`Dataset.plot.quiver` for quiver plots with :py:class:`Dataset` variables.
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Add ``"drop_conflicts"`` to the strategies supported by the ``combine_attrs`` kwarg
    (:issue:`4749`, :pull:`4827`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Allow installing from git archives (:pull:`4897`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - :py:class:`DataArrayCoarsen` and :py:class:`DatasetCoarsen` now implement a
    ``reduce`` method, enabling coarsening operations with custom reduction
    functions (:issue:`3741`, :pull:`4939`).  By `Spencer Clark
    <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - Most rolling operations use significantly less memory. (:issue:`4325`).
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Add :py:meth:`Dataset.drop_isel` and :py:meth:`DataArray.drop_isel`
    (:issue:`4658`, :pull:`4819`).
    By `Daniel Mesejo <https://github.com/mesejo>`_.
  - Xarray now leverages updates as of cftime version 1.4.1, which enable exact I/O
    roundtripping of ``cftime.datetime`` objects (:pull:`4758`).
    By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - :py:func:`open_dataset` and :py:func:`open_mfdataset` now accept ``fsspec`` URLs
    (including globs for the latter) for ``engine="zarr"``, and so allow reading from
    many remote and other file systems (:pull:`4461`)
    By `Martin Durant <https://github.com/martindurant>`_
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.swap_dims` & :py:meth:`Dataset.swap_dims` now accept dims
    in the form of kwargs as well as a dict, like most similar methods.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Use specific type checks in
    :py:func:`~xarray.core.variable.as_compatible_data` instead of blanket
    access to ``values`` attribute (:issue:`2097`)
    By `Yunus Sevinchan <https://github.com/blsqr>`_.
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.resample` and :py:meth:`Dataset.resample` do not trigger
    computations anymore if :py:meth:`Dataset.weighted` or
    :py:meth:`DataArray.weighted` are applied (:issue:`4625`, :pull:`4668`). By
    `Julius Busecke <https://github.com/jbusecke>`_.
  - :py:func:`merge` with ``combine_attrs='override'`` makes a copy of the attrs
    (:issue:`4627`).
  - By default, when possible, xarray will now always use values of
    type ``int64`` when encoding and decoding ``numpy.datetime64[ns]`` datetimes.  This
    ensures that maximum precision and accuracy are maintained in the round-tripping
    process (:issue:`4045`, :pull:`4684`). It also enables encoding and decoding standard
    calendar dates with time units of nanoseconds (:pull:`4400`).
    By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_ and `Mark Harfouche
    <http://github.com/hmaarrfk>`_.
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.astype`, :py:meth:`Dataset.astype` and :py:meth:`Variable.astype` support
    the ``order`` and ``subok`` parameters again. This fixes a regression introduced in version 0.16.1
    (:issue:`4644`, :pull:`4683`).
    By `Richard Kleijn <https://github.com/rhkleijn>`_ .
  - Remove dictionary unpacking when using ``.loc`` to avoid collision with ``.sel`` parameters (:pull:`4695`).
    By `Anderson Banihirwe <https://github.com/andersy005>`_.

    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Fix a crash in orthogonal indexing on geographic coordinates with ``engine='cfgrib'``
    (:issue:`4733` :pull:`4737`).
    By `Alessandro Amici <https://github.com/alexamici>`_.
  - Coordinates with dtype ``str`` or ``bytes`` now retain their dtype on many operations,
    e.g. ``reindex``, ``align``, ``concat``, ``assign``, previously they were cast to an object dtype
    (:issue:`2658` and :issue:`4543`).
    By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
  - Limit number of data rows when printing large datasets. (:issue:`4736`, :pull:`4750`).
    By `Jimmy Westling <https://github.com/illviljan>`_.
  - Add ``missing_dims`` parameter to transpose (:issue:`4647`, :pull:`4767`).
    By `Daniel Mesejo <https://github.com/mesejo>`_.
  - Resolve intervals before appending other metadata to labels when plotting (:issue:`4322`, :pull:`4794`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Fix regression when decoding a variable with a ``scale_factor`` and ``add_offset`` given
    as a list of length one (:issue:`4631`) by `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
  - Expand user directory paths (e.g. ``~/``) in :py:func:`open_mfdataset` and
    :py:meth:`Dataset.to_zarr` (:issue:`4783`, :pull:`4795`).
    By `Julien Seguinot <https://github.com/juseg>`_.
  - Raise DeprecationWarning when trying to typecast a tuple containing a :py:class:`DataArray`.
    User now prompted to first call `.data` on it (:issue:`4483`).
    By `Chun Ho Chow <https://github.com/chunhochow>`_.

Sun Dec 20 16:09:14 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 0.16.2:
 - This release brings the ability to write to limited regions of ``zarr`` files, open zarr files with :py:func:`open_dataset` and :py:func:`open_mfdataset`, increased support for propagating ``attrs`` using the ``keep_attrs`` flag, as well as numerous bugfixes and documentation improvements.:
 - Deprecations:
  - :py:attr:`~core.accessor_dt.DatetimeAccessor.weekofyear` and :py:attr:`~core.accessor_dt.DatetimeAccessor.week`
    have been deprecated. Use ``DataArray.dt.isocalendar().week``
    instead (:pull:`4534`). By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_,
    `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_, and `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - :py:attr:`DataArray.rolling` and :py:attr:`Dataset.rolling` no longer support passing ``keep_attrs``
    via its constructor. Pass ``keep_attrs`` via the applied function, i.e. use
    ``ds.rolling(...).mean(keep_attrs=False)`` instead of ``ds.rolling(..., keep_attrs=False).mean()``
    Rolling operations now keep their attributes per default (:pull:`4510`).
    By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
 - New Features:
  - :py:func:`open_dataset` and :py:func:`open_mfdataset`
    now works with ``engine="zarr"`` (:issue:`3668`, :pull:`4003`, :pull:`4187`).
    By `Miguel Jimenez <https://github.com/Mikejmnez>`_ and `Wei Ji Leong <https://github.com/weiji14>`_.
  - Unary & binary operations follow the ``keep_attrs`` flag (:issue:`3490`, :issue:`4065`, :issue:`3433`, :issue:`3595`, :pull:`4195`).
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Added :py:meth:`~core.accessor_dt.DatetimeAccessor.isocalendar()` that returns a Dataset
    with year, week, and weekday calculated according to the ISO 8601 calendar. Requires
    pandas version 1.1.0 or greater (:pull:`4534`). By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_,
    `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_, and `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.to_zarr` now supports a ``region`` keyword for writing to
    limited regions of existing Zarr stores (:pull:`4035`).
    See :ref:`io.zarr.appending` for full details.
    By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.
  - Added typehints in :py:func:`align` to reflect that the same type received in ``objects`` arg will be returned (:pull:`4522`).
    By `Michal Baumgartner <https://github.com/m1so>`_.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.weighted` and :py:meth:`DataArray.weighted` are now executing value checks lazily if weights are provided as dask arrays (:issue:`4541`, :pull:`4559`).
    By `Julius Busecke <https://github.com/jbusecke>`_.
  - Added the ``keep_attrs`` keyword to ``rolling_exp.mean()``; it now keeps attributes
    per default. By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_ (:pull:`4592`).
  - Added ``freq`` as property to :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` and into the
    ``CFTimeIndex.repr``. (:issue:`2416`, :pull:`4597`)
    By `Aaron Spring <https://github.com/aaronspring>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Fix bug where reference times without padded years (e.g. ``since 1-1-1``) would lose their units when
    being passed by :py:func:`encode_cf_datetime` (:issue:`4422`, :pull:`4506`). Such units are ambiguous
    about which digit represents the years (is it YMD or DMY?). Now, if such formatting is encountered,
    it is assumed that the first digit is the years, they are padded appropriately (to e.g. ``since 0001-1-1``)
    and a warning that this assumption is being made is issued. Previously, without ``cftime``, such times
    would be silently parsed incorrectly (at least based on the CF conventions) e.g. "since 1-1-1" would
    be parsed (via ``pandas`` and ``dateutil``) to ``since 2001-1-1``.
    By `Zeb Nicholls <https://github.com/znicholls>`_.
  - Fix :py:meth:`DataArray.plot.step`. By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Fix bug where reading a scalar value from a NetCDF file opened with the ``h5netcdf`` backend would raise a ``ValueError`` when ``decode_cf=True`` (:issue:`4471`, :pull:`4485`).
    By `Gerrit Holl <https://github.com/gerritholl>`_.
  - Fix bug where datetime64 times are silently changed to incorrect values if they are outside the valid date range for ns precision when provided in some other units (:issue:`4427`, :pull:`4454`).
    By `Andrew Pauling <https://github.com/andrewpauling>`_
  - Fix silently overwriting the ``engine`` key when passing :py:func:`open_dataset` a file object
    to an incompatible netCDF (:issue:`4457`). Now incompatible combinations of files and engines raise
    an exception instead. By `Alessandro Amici <https://github.com/alexamici>`_.
  - The ``min_count`` argument to :py:meth:`DataArray.sum()` and :py:meth:`DataArray.prod()`
    is now ignored when not applicable, i.e. when ``skipna=False`` or when ``skipna=None``
    and the dtype does not have a missing value (:issue:`4352`).
    By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
  - :py:func:`combine_by_coords` now raises an informative error when passing coordinates
    with differing calendars (:issue:`4495`). By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
  - :py:attr:`DataArray.rolling` and :py:attr:`Dataset.rolling` now also keep the attributes and names of of (wrapped)
    ``DataArray`` objects, previously only the global attributes were retained (:issue:`4497`, :pull:`4510`).
    By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
  - Improve performance where reading small slices from huge dimensions was slower than necessary (:pull:`4560`). By `Dion Häfner <https://github.com/dionhaefner>`_.

    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Mention the possibility to pass functions to :py:meth:`Dataset.where` or
    :py:meth:`DataArray.where` in the parameter documentation (:issue:`4223`, :pull:`4613`).
    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
  - Update the docstring of :py:class:`DataArray` and :py:class:`Dataset`.
    (:pull:`4532`);
    By `Jimmy Westling <https://github.com/illviljan>`_.
  - Raise a more informative error when :py:meth:`DataArray.to_dataframe` is
    is called on a scalar, (:issue:`4228`);
    By `Pieter Gijsbers <https://github.com/pgijsbers>`_.
  - Fix grammar and typos in the :doc:`contributing` guide (:pull:`4545`).
    By `Sahid Velji <https://github.com/sahidvelji>`_.

    By `Justus Magin <https://github.com/keewis>`_.
 - Internal Changes:
  - Optional dependencies can be installed along with xarray by specifying
    extras as ``pip install "xarray[extra]"`` where ``extra`` can be one of ``io``,
    ``accel``, ``parallel``, ``viz`` and ``complete``. See docs for updated
    :ref:`installation instructions <installation-instructions>`.
    (:issue:`2888`, :pull:`4480`).

- Package is py3 only -> drop py2 dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 28 16:43:47 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 0.15.1:
  * Breaking changes
    + Raise an error when assigning to the .values or .data attribute
      of dimension coordinates i.e. IndexVariable objects. This has
      been broken since v0.12.0. Please use DataArray.assign_coords()
      or Dataset.assign_coords() instead. (GH3470, PR3862) By Deepak
      Cherian
  * New Features
    + Weighted array reductions are now supported via the new
      DataArray.weighted() and Dataset.weighted() methods. See
      Weighted array reductions. (GH422, PR2922). By Mathias Hauser
    + The new jupyter notebook repr (Dataset._repr_html_ and
      DataArray._repr_html_) (introduced in 0.14.1) is now on by
      default. To disable, use
      xarray.set_options(display_style="text"). By Julia Signell.
    + Added support for pandas.DatetimeIndex-style rounding of
      cftime.datetime objects directly via a CFTimeIndex or via the
      DatetimeAccessor. By Spencer Clark
    + Support new h5netcdf backend keyword phony_dims (available from
      h5netcdf v0.8.0 for H5NetCDFStore. By Kai Mühlbauer.
    + Add partial support for unit aware arrays with pint. (PR3706,
      PR3611) By Justus Magin.
    + Dataset.groupby() and DataArray.groupby() now raise a TypeError
      on multiple string arguments. Receiving multiple string
      arguments often means a user is attempting to pass multiple
      dimensions as separate arguments and should instead pass a
      single list of dimensions. (PR3802) By Maximilian Roos
    + map_blocks() can now apply functions that add new unindexed
      dimensions. By Deepak Cherian
    + An ellipsis (...) is now supported in the dims argument of
      Dataset.stack() and DataArray.stack(), meaning all unlisted
      dimensions, similar to its meaning in
      DataArray.transpose(). (PR3826) By Maximilian Roos
    + Dataset.where() and DataArray.where() accept a lambda as a first
      argument, which is then called on the input; replicating pandas’
      behavior. By Maximilian Roos.
    + skipna is available in Dataset.quantile(), DataArray.quantile(),
      core.groupby.DatasetGroupBy.quantile(),
      core.groupby.DataArrayGroupBy.quantile() (GH3843, PR3844) By
      Aaron Spring.
  * Bug fixes
    + Fix Dataset.interp() when indexing array shares coordinates with
      the indexed variable (GH3252). By David Huard.
    + Fix recombination of groups in Dataset.groupby() and
      DataArray.groupby() when performing an operation that changes
      the size of the groups along the grouped dimension. By Eric
      Jansen.
    + Fix use of multi-index with categorical values (GH3674). By
      Matthieu Ancellin.
    + Fix alignment with join="override" when some dimensions are
      unindexed. (GH3681). By Deepak Cherian.
    + Fix Dataset.swap_dims() and DataArray.swap_dims() producing
      index with name reflecting the previous dimension name instead
      of the new one (GH3748, PR3752). By Joseph K Aicher.
    + Use dask_array_type instead of dask_array.Array for type
      checking. (GH3779, PR3787) By Justus Magin.
    + concat() can now handle coordinate variables only present in one
      of the objects to be concatenated when coords="different". By
      Deepak Cherian.
    + xarray now respects the over, under and bad colors if set on a
      provided colormap. (GH3590, PR3601) By johnomotani.
    + coarsen() now respects xr.set_options(keep_attrs=True) to
      preserve attributes. Dataset.coarsen() accepts a keyword
      argument keep_attrs to change this setting. (GH3376, PR3801) By
      Andrew Thomas.
    + Delete associated indexes when deleting coordinate
      variables. (GH3746). By Deepak Cherian.
    + Fix xarray.core.dataset.Dataset.to_zarr() when using append_dim
      and group simultaneously. (GH3170). By Matthias Meyer.
    + Fix html repr on Dataset with non-string keys (PR3807). By
      Maximilian Roos.
  * Documentation
    + Fix documentation of DataArray removing the deprecated mention
      that when omitted, dims are inferred from a
      coords-dict. (PR3821) By Sander van Rijn.
    + Improve the where() docstring. By Maximilian Roos
    + Update the installation instructions: only explicitly list
      recommended dependencies (GH3756). By Mathias Hauser.
  * Internal Changes
    + Remove the internal import_seaborn function which handled the
      deprecation of the seaborn.apionly entry point (GH3747). By
      Mathias Hauser.
    + Don’t test pint integration in combination with datetime
      objects. (GH3778, PR3788) By Justus Magin.
    + Change test_open_mfdataset_list_attr to only run with dask
      installed (GH3777, PR3780). By Bruno Pagani.
    + Preserve the ability to index with method="nearest" with a
      CFTimeIndex with pandas versions greater than 1.0.1 (GH3751). By
      Spencer Clark.
    + Greater flexibility and improved test coverage of subtracting
      various types of objects from a CFTimeIndex. By Spencer Clark.
    + Update Azure CI MacOS image, given pending removal. By
      Maximilian Roos
    + Remove xfails for scipy 1.0.1 for tests that append to netCDF
      files (PR3805). By Mathias Hauser.
    + Remove conversion to pandas.Panel, given its removal in pandas
      in favor of xarray’s objects. By Maximilian Roos
- Add packages to the test suite so that more of the package is
  tested instead of skipping the tests.

Sat Feb  1 15:02:10 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 0.15.0:
 - This release brings many improvements to xarray's documentation: our examples are now binderized notebooks (`click here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/master?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/weather-data.ipynb>`_):
 - and we have new example notebooks from our SciPy 2019 sprint (many thanks to our contributors!).:
 - This release also features many API improvements such as a new:
:py:class:`~core.accessor_dt.TimedeltaAccessor` and support for :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` in
:py:meth:`~DataArray.interpolate_na`); as well as many bug fixes.
 - Breaking changes:
  - Bumped minimum tested versions for dependencies:
    - numpy 1.15
    - pandas 0.25
    - dask 2.2
    - distributed 2.2
    - scipy 1.3
  - Remove ``compat`` and ``encoding`` kwargs from ``DataArray``, which
    have been deprecated since 0.12. (:pull:`3650`).
    Instead, specify the ``encoding`` kwarg when writing to disk or set
    the :py:attr:`DataArray.encoding` attribute directly.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - :py:func:`xarray.dot`, :py:meth:`DataArray.dot`, and the ``@`` operator now

    :py:class:`~xarray.Dataset` from a h5netcdf ``File`` that has been opened
    using other means (:issue:`3618`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer <https://github.com/kmuehlbauer>`_.
  - Implement ``median`` and ``nanmedian`` for dask arrays. This works by rechunking
    to a single chunk along all reduction axes. (:issue:`2999`).
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - :py:func:`~xarray.concat` now preserves attributes from the first Variable.
    (:issue:`2575`, :issue:`2060`, :issue:`1614`)
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.quantile`, :py:meth:`DataArray.quantile` and ``GroupBy.quantile``
    now work with dask Variables.
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.

    and :py:class:`~core.rolling.DataArrayCoarsen` objects. (:pull:`3500`)
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_
  - Add ``meta`` kwarg to :py:func:`~xarray.apply_ufunc`;
    this is passed on to :py:func:`dask.array.blockwise`. (:pull:`3660`)

Fri Nov 22 06:11:38 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 0.14.1:
  * Breaking changes
    + Broken compatibility with cftime < 1.0.3 . By Deepak Cherian.
      Warning:
      cftime version 1.0.4 is broken (cftime/126); please use version
      1.0.4.2 instead.
    + All leftover support for dates from non-standard calendars
      through netcdftime, the module included in versions of netCDF4
      prior to 1.4 that eventually became the cftime package, has been
      removed in favor of relying solely on the standalone cftime
      package (PR3450). By Spencer Clark.
  * New Features
    + Added the sparse option to unstack(), unstack(), reindex(),
      reindex() (GH3518). By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Added the fill_value option to DataArray.unstack() and
      Dataset.unstack() (GH3518, PR3541). By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Added the max_gap kwarg to interpolate_na() and
      interpolate_na(). This controls the maximum size of the data gap
      that will be filled by interpolation. By Deepak Cherian.
    + Added Dataset.drop_sel() & DataArray.drop_sel() for dropping
      labels. Dataset.drop_vars() & DataArray.drop_vars() have been
      added for dropping variables (including coordinates). The
      existing Dataset.drop() & DataArray.drop() methods remain as a
      backward compatible option for dropping either labels or
      variables, but using the more specific methods is
      encouraged. (PR3475) By Maximilian Roos
    + Added Dataset.map() & GroupBy.map() & Resample.map() for mapping
      / applying a function over each item in the collection,
      reflecting the widely used and least surprising name for this
      operation. The existing apply methods remain for backward
      compatibility, though using the map methods is
      encouraged. (PR3459) By Maximilian Roos
    + Dataset.transpose() and DataArray.transpose() now support an
      ellipsis (...) to represent all ‘other’ dimensions. For example,
      to move one dimension to the front, use .transpose('x',
      ...). (PR3421) By Maximilian Roos
    + Changed xr.ALL_DIMS to equal python’s Ellipsis (...), and
      changed internal usages to use ... directly. As before, you can
      use this to instruct a groupby operation to reduce over all
      dimensions. While we have no plans to remove xr.ALL_DIMS, we
      suggest using .... (PR3418) By Maximilian Roos
    + xarray.dot(), and DataArray.dot() now support the
      dims=... option to sum over the union of dimensions of all input
      arrays (GH3423) by Mathias Hauser.
    + Added new Dataset._repr_html_() and DataArray._repr_html_() to
      improve representation of objects in Jupyter. By default this
      feature is turned off for now. Enable it with
      xarray.set_options(display_style="html"). (PR3425) by Benoit
      Bovy and Julia Signell.
    + Implement dask deterministic hashing for xarray objects. Note
      that xarray objects with a dask.array backend already used
      deterministic hashing in previous releases; this change
      implements it when whole xarray objects are embedded in a dask
      graph, e.g. when DataArray.map() is invoked. (GH3378, PR3446,
      PR3515) By Deepak Cherian and Guido Imperiale.
    + Add the documented-but-missing
      DatasetGroupBy.quantile(). (GH3525, PR3527). By Justus Magin.
  * Bug fixes
    + Ensure an index of type CFTimeIndex is not converted to a
      DatetimeIndex when calling Dataset.rename(),
      Dataset.rename_dims() and Dataset.rename_vars(). By Mathias
      Hauser. (GH3522).
    + Fix a bug in DataArray.set_index() in case that an existing
      dimension becomes a level variable of MultiIndex. (PR3520). By
      Keisuke Fujii.
    + Harmonize _FillValue, missing_value during encoding and decoding
      steps. (PR3502) By Anderson Banihirwe.
    + Fix regression introduced in v0.14.0 that would cause a crash if
      dask is installed but cloudpickle isn’t (GH3401) by Rhys Doyle
    + Fix grouping over variables with NaNs. (GH2383, PR3406). By
      Deepak Cherian.
    + Make alignment and concatenation significantly more efficient by
      using dask names to compare dask objects prior to comparing
      values after computation. This change makes it more convenient
      to carry around large non-dimensional coordinate variables
      backed by dask arrays. Existing workarounds involving
      reset_coords(drop=True) should now be unnecessary in most
      cases. (GH3068, GH3311, GH3454, PR3453). By Deepak Cherian.
    + Add support for cftime>=1.0.4. By Anderson Banihirwe.
    + Rolling reduction operations no longer compute dask arrays by
      default. (GH3161). In addition, the allow_lazy kwarg to reduce
      is deprecated. By Deepak Cherian.
    + Fix GroupBy.reduce() when reducing over multiple
      dimensions. (GH3402). By Deepak Cherian
    + Allow appending datetime and bool data variables to zarr
      stores. (GH3480). By Akihiro Matsukawa.
    + Add support for numpy >=1.18 (); bugfix mean() on datetime64
      arrays on dask backend (GH3409, PR3537). By Guido Imperiale.
    + Add support for pandas >=0.26 (GH3440). By Deepak Cherian.
    + Add support for pseudonetcdf >=3.1 (PR3485). By Barron
      Henderson.
  * Documentation
    + Fix leap year condition in monthly means example. By Mickaël
      Lalande.
    + Fix the documentation of DataArray.resample() and
      Dataset.resample(), explicitly stating that a datetime-like
      dimension is required. (PR3400) By Justus Magin.
    + Update the Terminology page to address multidimensional
      coordinates. (PR3410) By Jon Thielen.
    + Fix the documentation of Dataset.integrate() and
      DataArray.integrate() and add an example to
      Dataset.integrate(). (PR3469) By Justus Magin.
  * Internal Changes
    + Added integration tests against pint. (PR3238, PR3447, PR3493,
      PR3508) by Justus Magin.
      Note:
      At the moment of writing, these tests as well as the ability to
      use pint in general require a highly experimental version of
      pint (install with pip install
      git+https://github.com/andrewgsavage/pint.git@refs/pull/6/head). Even
      with it, interaction with non-numpy array libraries, e.g. dask
      or sparse, is broken.
    + Use Python 3.6 idioms throughout the codebase. (PR3419) By
      Maximilian Roos
    + Run basic CI tests on Python 3.8. (PR3477) By Maximilian Roos
    + Enable type checking on default sentinel values (PR3472) By
      Maximilian Roos
    + Add Variable._replace() for simpler replacing of a subset of
      attributes (PR3472) By Maximilian Roos

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 24 19:52:12 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- update to version 0.14.0
  + Breaking changes
    * Dropped the `drop=False` optional parameter from Variable.isel.
      It was unused and doesn't make sense for a Variable.
  + New functions/methods
    * Added xarray.map_blocks, modeled after dask.array.map_blocks.
      Also added Dataset.unify_chunks, DataArray.unify_chunks and
      testing.assert_chunks_equal
  + Enhancements
    * xarray.core.GroupBy enhancements.
      > Added a repr
      > Added a ``GroupBy.dims`` property that mirrors the dimensions
        of each group.
    * Speed up Dataset.isel up to 33% and DataArray.isel up to 25% for small
      arrays
  + Bug fixes
    * Reintroduce support for weakref (broken in v0.13.0). Support has been
      reinstated for DataArray and Dataset objects only. Internal xarray
      objects remain unaddressable by weakref in order to save memory
    * Line plots with the x or y argument set to a 1D non-dimensional coord
      now plot the correct data for 2D DataArrays
    * Make xarray.concat more robust when merging variables present in some datasets but
      not others.
    * The default behaviour of reducing across all dimensions for
      xarray.core.groupby.DataArrayGroupBy objects has now been properly removed
      as was done for xarray.core.groupby.DatasetGroupBy in 0.13.0.
      Use xarray.ALL_DIMS if you need to replicate previous behaviour.
      Also raise nicer error message when no groups are created.
    * Fix error in concatenating unlabeled dimensions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 21 19:53:35 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 0.13.0:
  * Breaking changes
    + This release increases the minimum required Python version from
      3.5.0 to 3.5.3 (GH3089). By Guido Imperiale.
    + The isel_points and sel_points methods are removed, having been
      deprecated since v0.10.0. These are redundant with the isel /
      sel methods. See Vectorized Indexing for the details By
      Maximilian Roos
    + The inplace kwarg for public methods now raises an error, having
      been deprecated since v0.11.0. By Maximilian Roos
    + concat() now requires the dim argument. Its indexers, mode and
      concat_over kwargs have now been removed. By Deepak Cherian
    + Passing a list of colors in cmap will now raise an error, having
      been deprecated since v0.6.1.
    + Most xarray objects now define __slots__. This reduces overall
      RAM usage by ~22% (not counting the underlying numpy buffers);
      on CPython 3.7/x64, a trivial DataArray has gone down from 1.9kB
      to 1.5kB.
      Caveats:
      o Pickle streams produced by older versions of xarray can’t be
        loaded using this release, and vice versa.
      o Any user code that was accessing the __dict__ attribute of
        xarray objects will break. The best practice to attach custom
        metadata to xarray objects is to use the attrs dictionary.
      o Any user code that defines custom subclasses of xarray classes
        must now explicitly define __slots__ itself. Subclasses that
        don’t add any attributes must state so by defining __slots__ =
        () right after the class header. Omitting __slots__ will now
        cause a FutureWarning to be logged, and will raise an error in a
        later release.
      (GH3250) by Guido Imperiale.
    + The default dimension for Dataset.groupby(), Dataset.resample(),
      DataArray.groupby() and DataArray.resample() reductions is now
      the grouping or resampling dimension.
    + DataArray.to_dataset() requires name to be passed as a kwarg
      (previously ambiguous positional arguments were deprecated)
    + Reindexing with variables of a different dimension now raise an
      error (previously deprecated)
    + broadcast_array() is removed (previously deprecated in favor of
      broadcast())
    + Variable.expand_dims() is removed (previously deprecated in
      favor of Variable.set_dims())
  * New functions/methods
    + xarray can now wrap around any NEP18 compliant numpy-like
      library (important: read notes about
      NUMPY_EXPERIMENTAL_ARRAY_FUNCTION in the above link). Added
      explicit test coverage for sparse. (GH3117, GH3202). This
      requires sparse>=0.8.0. By Nezar Abdennur and Guido Imperiale.
    + from_dataframe() and from_series() now support sparse=True for
      converting pandas objects into xarray objects wrapping sparse
      arrays. This is particularly useful with sparsely populated
      hierarchical indexes. (GH3206) By Stephan Hoyer.
    + The xarray package is now discoverable by mypy (although typing
      hints coverage is not complete yet). mypy type checking is now
      enforced by CI. Libraries that depend on xarray and use mypy can
      now remove from their setup.cfg the lines:
         [mypy-xarray]
         ignore_missing_imports = True
      (GH2877, GH3088, GH3090, GH3112, GH3117, GH3207) By Guido
      Imperiale and Maximilian Roos.
    + Added DataArray.broadcast_like() and
      Dataset.broadcast_like(). By Deepak Cherian and David Mertz.
    + Dataset plotting API for visualizing dependencies between two
      DataArrays! Currently only Dataset.plot.scatter() is
      implemented. By Yohai Bar Sinai and Deepak Cherian
    + Added DataArray.head(), DataArray.tail() and DataArray.thin();
      as well as Dataset.head(), Dataset.tail() and Dataset.thin()
      methods. (GH319) By Gerardo Rivera.
  * Enhancements
    + Multiple enhancements to concat() and open_mfdataset(). By
      Deepak Cherian
    + Added compat='override'. When merging, this option picks the
      variable from the first dataset and skips all comparisons.
    + Added join='override'. When aligning, this only checks that
      index sizes are equal among objects and skips checking indexes
      for equality.
    + concat() and open_mfdataset() now support the join kwarg. It is
      passed down to align().
    + concat() now calls merge() on variables that are not
      concatenated (i.e. variables without concat_dim when data_vars
      or coords are "minimal"). concat() passes its new compat kwarg
      down to merge(). (GH2064)
    + Users can avoid a common bottleneck when using open_mfdataset()
      on a large number of files with variables that are known to be
      aligned and some of which need not be concatenated. Slow
      equality comparisons can now be avoided, for e.g.:
        data = xr.open_mfdataset(files, concat_dim='time',
                data_vars='minimal',
                coords='minimal', compat='override', join='override')
    + In to_zarr(), passing mode is not mandatory if append_dim is
      set, as it will automatically be set to 'a' internally. By David
      Brochart.
    + Added the ability to initialize an empty or full DataArray with
      a single value. (GH277) By Gerardo Rivera.
    + to_netcdf() now supports the invalid_netcdf kwarg when used with
      engine="h5netcdf". It is passed to h5netcdf.File(). By Ulrich
      Herter.
    + drop() now supports keyword arguments; dropping index labels by
      using both dim and labels or using a DataArrayCoordinates object
      are deprecated (GH2910). By Gregory Gundersen.
    + Added examples of Dataset.set_index() and DataArray.set_index(),
      as well are more specific error messages when the user passes
      invalid arguments (GH3176). By Gregory Gundersen.
    + filter_by_attrs() now filters the coordinates as well as the
      variables. By Spencer Jones.
  * Bug fixes
    + Improve “missing dimensions” error message for apply_ufunc()
      (GH2078). By Rick Russotto.
    + assign_coords() now supports dictionary arguments (GH3231). By
      Gregory Gundersen.
    + Fix regression introduced in v0.12.2 where copy(deep=True) would
      convert unicode indices to dtype=object (GH3094). By Guido
      Imperiale.
    + Improved error handling and documentation for .expand_dims()
      read-only view.
    + Fix tests for big-endian systems (GH3125). By Graham Inggs.
    + XFAIL several tests which are expected to fail on ARM systems
      due to a datetime issue in NumPy (GH2334). By Graham Inggs.
    + Fix KeyError that arises when using .sel method with float
      values different from coords float type (GH3137). By Hasan
      Ahmad.
    + Fixed bug in combine_by_coords() causing a ValueError if the
      input had an unused dimension with coordinates which were not
      monotonic (GH3150). By Tom Nicholas.
    + Fixed crash when applying distributed.Client.compute() to a
      DataArray (GH3171). By Guido Imperiale.
    + Better error message when using groupby on an empty DataArray
      (GH3037). By Hasan Ahmad.
    + Fix error that arises when using open_mfdataset on a series of
      netcdf files having differing values for a variable attribute of
      type list. (GH3034) By Hasan Ahmad.
    + Prevent argmax() and argmin() from calling dask compute
      (GH3237). By Ulrich Herter.
    + Plots in 2 dimensions (pcolormesh, contour) now allow to specify
      levels as numpy array (GH3284). By Mathias Hauser.
    + Fixed bug in DataArray.quantile() failing to keep attributes
      when keep_attrs was True (GH3304). By David Huard
      https://github.com/huard.
  * Documentation
    + Created a PR checklist as a quick reference for tasks before
      creating a new PR or pushing new commits. By Gregory Gundersen.
    + Fixed documentation to clean up unwanted files created in
      ipython examples (GH3227). By Gregory Gundersen.

- Disable non-functional dask tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 15 19:31:13 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 0.12.3:
 - New functions/methods:
  - New methods :py:meth:`Dataset.to_stacked_array` and
    :py:meth:`DataArray.to_unstacked_dataset` for reshaping Datasets of variables
    with different dimensions
    (:issue:`1317`).
    This is useful for feeding data from xarray into machine learning models,
    as described in :ref:`reshape.stacking_different`.
 - Enhancements:
  - Support for renaming ``Dataset`` variables and dimensions independently

Sun Jun 30 09:29:36 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 0.12.2:
 - New functions/methods:
  - Two new functions, :py:func:`~xarray.combine_nested` and
    :py:func:`~xarray.combine_by_coords`, allow for combining datasets along any
    number of dimensions, instead of the one-dimensional list of datasets
    supported by :py:func:`~xarray.concat`.
    The new ``combine_nested`` will accept the datasets as a nested
    list-of-lists, and combine by applying a series of concat and merge
    operations. The new ``combine_by_coords`` instead uses the dimension
    coordinates of datasets to order them.
    :py:func:`~xarray.open_mfdataset` can use either ``combine_nested`` or
    ``combine_by_coords`` to combine datasets along multiple dimensions, by
    specifying the argument ``combine='nested'`` or ``combine='by_coords'``.
    The older function :py:func:`~xarray.auto_combine` has been deprecated,
    because its functionality has been subsumed by the new functions.
    To avoid FutureWarnings switch to using ``combine_nested`` or
    ``combine_by_coords``, (or set the ``combine`` argument in
    ``open_mfdataset``). (:issue:`2159`)
    By `Tom Nicholas <http://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
  - :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.rolling_exp` and
    :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.rolling_exp` added, similar to pandas'
    ``pd.DataFrame.ewm`` method. Calling ``.mean`` on the resulting object
    will return an exponentially weighted moving average.
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - New :py:func:`DataArray.str <core.accessor_str.StringAccessor>` for string
    related manipulations, based on ``pandas.Series.str``.
    By `0x0L <https://github.com/0x0L>`_.
  - Added ``strftime`` method to ``.dt`` accessor, making it simpler to hand a
    datetime ``DataArray`` to other code expecting formatted dates and times.
    (:issue:`2090`). :py:meth:`~xarray.CFTimeIndex.strftime` is also now
    available on :py:class:`CFTimeIndex`.
    By `Alan Brammer <https://github.com/abrammer>`_ and
    `Ryan May <https://github.com/dopplershift>`_.
  - :py:meth:`~xarray.core.GroupBy.quantile` is now a method of ``GroupBy``
    objects  (:issue:`3018`).
    By `David Huard <https://github.com/huard>`_.
  - Argument and return types are added to most methods on ``DataArray`` and
    ``Dataset``, allowing static type checking both within xarray and external
    libraries. Type checking with `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org/>`_ is enabled in
    CI (though not required yet).
    By `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_
    and `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
 - Enhancements to existing functionality:
  - Add ``keepdims`` argument for reduce operations (:issue:`2170`)
    By `Scott Wales <https://github.com/ScottWales>`_.
  - Enable ``@`` operator for DataArray. This is equivalent to :py:meth:`DataArray.dot`
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Add ``fill_value`` argument for reindex, align, and merge operations
    to enable custom fill values. (:issue:`2876`)
    By `Zach Griffith <https://github.com/zdgriffith>`_.
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.transpose` now accepts a keyword argument
    ``transpose_coords`` which enables transposition of coordinates in the
    same way as :py:meth:`Dataset.transpose`. :py:meth:`DataArray.groupby`
    :py:meth:`DataArray.groupby_bins`, and :py:meth:`DataArray.resample` now
    accept a keyword argument ``restore_coord_dims`` which keeps the order
    of the dimensions of multi-dimensional coordinates intact (:issue:`1856`).
    By `Peter Hausamann <http://github.com/phausamann>`_.
  - Better warning message when supplying invalid objects to ``xr.merge``
    (:issue:`2948`).  By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.
  - Add ``errors`` keyword argument to :py:meth:`Dataset.drop` and :py:meth:`Dataset.drop_dims`
    that allows ignoring errors if a passed label or dimension is not in the dataset
    (:issue:`2994`).
    By `Andrew Ross <https://github.com/andrew-c-ross>`_.
 - IO related enhancements:
  - Implement :py:func:`~xarray.load_dataset` and
    :py:func:`~xarray.load_dataarray` as alternatives to
    :py:func:`~xarray.open_dataset` and :py:func:`~xarray.open_dataarray` to
    open, load into memory, and close files, returning the Dataset or DataArray.
    These functions are helpful for avoiding file-lock errors when trying to
    write to files opened using ``open_dataset()`` or ``open_dataarray()``.
    (:issue:`2887`)
    By `Dan Nowacki <https://github.com/dnowacki-usgs>`_.
  - It is now possible to extend existing :ref:`io.zarr` datasets, by using
    ``mode='a'`` and the new ``append_dim`` argument in
    :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.to_zarr`.
    By `Jendrik Jördening <https://github.com/jendrikjoe>`_,
    `David Brochart <https://github.com/davidbrochart>`_,
    `Ryan Abernathey <https://github.com/rabernat>`_ and
    `Shikhar Goenka <https://github.com/shikharsg>`_.
  - ``xr.open_zarr`` now accepts manually specified chunks with the ``chunks=``
    parameter. ``auto_chunk=True`` is equivalent to ``chunks='auto'`` for
    backwards compatibility. The ``overwrite_encoded_chunks`` parameter is
    added to remove the original zarr chunk encoding.
    By `Lily Wang <https://github.com/lilyminium>`_.
  - netCDF chunksizes are now only dropped when original_shape is different,
    not when it isn't found. (:issue:`2207`)
    By `Karel van de Plassche <https://github.com/Karel-van-de-Plassche>`_.
  - Character arrays' character dimension name decoding and encoding handled by
    ``var.encoding['char_dim_name']`` (:issue:`2895`)
    By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
  - open_rasterio() now supports rasterio.vrt.WarpedVRT with custom transform,
    width and height (:issue:`2864`).
    By `Julien Michel <https://github.com/jmichel-otb>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Rolling operations on xarray objects containing dask arrays could silently
    compute the incorrect result or use large amounts of memory (:issue:`2940`).
    By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.
  - Don't set encoding attributes on bounds variables when writing to netCDF.
    (:issue:`2921`)
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - NetCDF4 output: variables with unlimited dimensions must be chunked (not
    contiguous) on output. (:issue:`1849`)
    By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
  - indexing with an empty list creates an object with zero-length axis (:issue:`2882`)
    By `Mayeul d'Avezac <https://github.com/mdavezac>`_.
  - Return correct count for scalar datetime64 arrays (:issue:`2770`)
    By `Dan Nowacki <https://github.com/dnowacki-usgs>`_.
  - Fixed max, min exception when applied to a multiIndex (:issue:`2923`)
    By `Ian Castleden <https://github.com/arabidopsis>`_
  - A deep copy deep-copies the coords (:issue:`1463`)
    By `Martin Pletcher <https://github.com/pletchm>`_.
  - Increased support for `missing_value` (:issue:`2871`)
    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.
  - Removed usages of `pytest.config`, which is deprecated (:issue:`2988`)
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_.
  - Fixed performance issues with cftime installed (:issue:`3000`)
    By `0x0L <https://github.com/0x0L>`_.
  - Test suite fixes for newer versions of pytest (:issue:`3011`, :issue:`3032`).
    By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_
    and `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.
  - update to version 0.12.1:
 - Enhancements:
  - Allow ``expand_dims`` method to support inserting/broadcasting dimensions
    with size > 1. (:issue:`2710`)
    By `Martin Pletcher <https://github.com/pletchm>`_.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Dataset.copy(deep=True) now creates a deep copy of the attrs (:issue:`2835`).
    By `Andras Gefferth <https://github.com/kefirbandi>`_.
  - Fix incorrect ``indexes`` resulting from various ``Dataset`` operations
    (e.g., ``swap_dims``, ``isel``, ``reindex``, ``[]``) (:issue:`2842`,
    :issue:`2856`).
    By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.

Sat Mar 16 22:38:17 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * since this version is for python3 only, add a hint to skip python 2 during the build

- update to version 0.12.0:
  * Highlights include:
    + Removed support for Python 2. This is the first version of
      xarray that is Python 3 only!
    + New coarsen() and integrate() methods. See Coarsen large arrays
      and Computation using Coordinates for details.
    + Many improvements to cftime support. See below for details.
  * Deprecations
    + The compat argument to Dataset and the encoding argument to
      DataArray are deprecated and will be removed in a future
      release. (GH1188) By Maximilian Roos.
  * cftime related enhancements
    + Resampling of standard and non-standard calendars indexed by
      CFTimeIndex is now possible. (GH2191). By Jwen Fai Low and
      Spencer Clark.
    + Taking the mean of arrays of cftime.datetime objects, and by
      extension, use of coarsen() with cftime.datetime coordinates is
      now possible. By Spencer Clark.
    + Internal plotting now supports cftime.datetime objects as time
      series. (GH2164) By Julius Busecke and Spencer Clark.
    + cftime_range() now supports QuarterBegin and QuarterEnd offsets
      (GH2663). By Jwen Fai Low
    + open_dataset() now accepts a use_cftime argument, which can be
      used to require that cftime.datetime objects are always used, or
      never used when decoding dates encoded with a standard
      calendar. This can be used to ensure consistent date types are
      returned when using open_mfdataset() (GH1263) and/or to silence
      serialization warnings raised if dates from a standard calendar
      are found to be outside the pandas.Timestamp-valid range
      (GH2754). By Spencer Clark.
    + pandas.Series.dropna() is now supported for a pandas.Series
      indexed by a CFTimeIndex (GH2688). By Spencer Clark.
  * Other enhancements
    + Added ability to open netcdf4/hdf5 file-like objects with
      open_dataset. Requires (h5netcdf>0.7 and h5py>2.9.0). (GH2781)
      By Scott Henderson
    + Add data=False option to to_dict() methods. (GH2656) By Ryan
      Abernathey
    + DataArray.coarsen() and Dataset.coarsen() are newly added. See
      Coarsen large arrays for details. (GH2525) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Upsampling an array via interpolation with resample is now
      dask-compatible, as long as the array is not chunked along the
      resampling dimension. By Spencer Clark.
    + xarray.testing.assert_equal() and
      xarray.testing.assert_identical() now provide a more detailed
      report showing what exactly differs between the two objects
      (dimensions / coordinates / variables / attributes) (GH1507). By
      Benoit Bovy.
    + Add tolerance option to resample() methods bfill, pad,
      nearest. (GH2695) By Hauke Schulz.
    + DataArray.integrate() and Dataset.integrate() are newly
      added. See Computation using Coordinates for the
      detail. (GH1332) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Added drop_dims() (GH1949). By Kevin Squire.
  * Bug fixes
    + Silenced warnings that appear when using pandas 0.24. By Stephan
      Hoyer
    + Interpolating via resample now internally specifies
      bounds_error=False as an argument to scipy.interpolate.interp1d,
      allowing for interpolation from higher frequencies to lower
      frequencies. Datapoints outside the bounds of the original time
      coordinate are now filled with NaN (GH2197). By Spencer Clark.
    + Line plots with the x argument set to a non-dimensional coord
      now plot the correct data for 1D DataArrays. (GH27251). By Tom
      Nicholas.
    + Subtracting a scalar cftime.datetime object from a CFTimeIndex
      now results in a pandas.TimedeltaIndex instead of raising a
      TypeError (GH2671). By Spencer Clark.
    + backend_kwargs are no longer ignored when using open_dataset
      with pynio engine (:issue:‘2380’) By Jonathan Joyce.
    + Fix open_rasterio creating a WKT CRS instead of PROJ.4 with
      rasterio 1.0.14+ (GH2715). By David Hoese.
    + Masking data arrays with xarray.DataArray.where() now returns an
      array with the name of the original masked array (GH2748 and
      GH2457). By Yohai Bar-Sinai.
    + Fixed error when trying to reduce a DataArray using a function
      which does not require an axis argument. (GH2768) By Tom
      Nicholas.
    + Concatenating a sequence of DataArray with varying names sets
      the name of the output array to None, instead of the name of the
      first input array. If the names are the same it sets the name to
      that, instead to the name of the first DataArray in the list as
      it did before. (GH2775). By Tom Nicholas.
    + Per CF conventions, specifying 'standard' as the calendar type
      in cftime_range() now correctly refers to the 'gregorian'
      calendar instead of the 'proleptic_gregorian' calendar (GH2761).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 13 18:04:03 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- update to version 0.11.3
  * Saving files with times encoded with reference dates with timezones
    (e.g. '2000-01-01T00:00:00-05:00') no longer raises an error
  * Fixed performance regression with ``open_mfdataset``
  * Fixed supplying an explicit dimension in the ``concat_dim`` argument to
    to ``open_mfdataset``

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  3 17:40:46 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 0.11.2:
 - Removes inadvertently introduced setup dependency on pytest-runner (:issue:`2641`). Otherwise, this release is exactly equivalent to 0.11.1.
 - Warning:
  - This is the last xarray release that will support Python 2.7. Future releases will be Python 3 only, but older versions of xarray will always be available for Python 2.7 users. For the more details, see:
- update to version 0.11.1:
 - Breaking changes
  - Minimum rasterio version increased from 0.36 to 1.0 (for open_rasterio)
  - Time bounds variables are now also decoded according to CF conventions (:issue:`2565`). The previous behavior was to decode them only if they had specific time attributes, now these attributes are copied automatically from the corresponding time coordinate. This might brake downstream code that was relying on these variables to be not decoded. By Fabien Maussion.
 - Enhancements
  - Ability to read and write consolidated metadata in zarr stores (:issue:`2558`). By Ryan Abernathey.
  - :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` uses slicing for string indexing when possible (like :py:class:`pandas.DatetimeIndex`), which avoids unnecessary copies. By Stephan Hoyer
  - Enable passing rasterio.io.DatasetReader or rasterio.vrt.WarpedVRT to open_rasterio instead of file path string. Allows for in-memory reprojection, see (:issue:`2588`). By Scott Henderson.
  - Like :py:class:`pandas.DatetimeIndex`, :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` now supports "dayofyear" and "dayofweek" accessors (:issue:`2597`). Note this requires a version of cftime greater than 1.0.2. By Spencer Clark.
  - The option 'warn_for_unclosed_files' (False by default) has been added to allow users to enable a warning when files opened by xarray are deallocated but were not explicitly closed. This is mostly useful for debugging; we recommend enabling it in your test suites if you use xarray for IO. By Stephan Hoyer
  - Support Dask HighLevelGraphs by Matthew Rocklin.
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.resample` and :py:meth:`Dataset.resample` now supports the loffset kwarg just like Pandas. By Deepak Cherian
  - Datasets are now guaranteed to have a 'source' encoding, so the source file name is always stored (:issue:`2550`). By Tom Nicholas.
  - The apply methods for DatasetGroupBy, DataArrayGroupBy, DatasetResample and DataArrayResample now support passing positional arguments to the applied function as a tuple to the args argument. By Matti Eskelinen.
  - 0d slices of ndarrays are now obtained directly through indexing, rather than extracting and wrapping a scalar, avoiding unnecessary copying. By Daniel Wennberg.
  - Added support for fill_value with :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.shift` and :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.shift` By Maximilian Roos
 - Bug fixes
  - Ensure files are automatically closed, if possible, when no longer referenced by a Python variable (:issue:`2560`). By Stephan Hoyer
  - Fixed possible race conditions when reading/writing to disk in parallel (:issue:`2595`). By Stephan Hoyer
  - Fix h5netcdf saving scalars with filters or chunks (:issue:`2563`). By Martin Raspaud.
  - Fix parsing of _Unsigned attribute set by OPENDAP servers. (:issue:`2583`). By Deepak Cherian
  - Fix failure in time encoding when exporting to netCDF with versions of pandas less than 0.21.1 (:issue:`2623`). By Spencer Clark.
  - Fix MultiIndex selection to update label and level (:issue:`2619`). By Keisuke Fujii.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 13 14:30:03 UTC 2018 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.11.0
  * Enhancements
    + xarray.DataArray.plot.line() can now accept multidimensional 
      coordinate variables as input. hue must be a dimension name 
      in this case. (GH2407) By Deepak Cherian.
    + Added support for Python 3.7. (GH2271). By Joe Hamman.
    + Added support for plotting data with pandas.Interval coordinates, 
      such as those created by groupby_bins() By Maximilian Maahn.
    + Added shift() for shifting the values of a CFTimeIndex by a 
      specified frequency. (GH2244). By Spencer Clark.
    + Added support for using cftime.datetime coordinates with 
      differentiate(), differentiate(), interp(), and interp(). 
      By Spencer Clark
    + There is now a global option to either always keep or always 
      discard dataset and dataarray attrs upon operations. The option 
      is set with xarray.set_options(keep_attrs=True), and the default 
      is to use the old behaviour. By Tom Nicholas.
    + Added a new backend for the GRIB file format based on ECMWF 
      cfgrib python driver and ecCodes C-library. (GH2475) By 
      Alessandro Amici, sponsored by ECMWF.
    + Resample now supports a dictionary mapping from dimension to 
      frequency as its first argument, e.g., 
      data.resample({'time': '1D'}).mean(). This is consistent with 
      other xarray functions that accept either dictionaries or 
      keyword arguments. By Stephan Hoyer.
    + The preferred way to access tutorial data is now to load it 
      lazily with xarray.tutorial.open_dataset(). 
      xarray.tutorial.load_dataset() calls Dataset.load() prior to 
      returning (and is now deprecated). This was changed in order 
      to facilitate using tutorial datasets with dask. By Joe Hamman.
  * Bugfixes    
    + FacetGrid now properly uses the cbar_kwargs keyword argument. 
      (GH1504, GH1717) By Deepak Cherian.
    + Addition and subtraction operators used with a CFTimeIndex now 
      preserve the index’s type. (GH2244). By Spencer Clark.
    + We now properly handle arrays of datetime.datetime and 
      datetime.timedelta provided as coordinates. (GH2512) By 
      `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian`_.
    + xarray.DataArray.roll correctly handles multidimensional arrays. 
      (GH2445) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + xarray.plot() now properly accepts a norm argument and does not 
      override the norm’s vmin and vmax. (GH2381) By Deepak Cherian.
    + xarray.DataArray.std() now correctly accepts ddof keyword argument. 
      (GH2240) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Restore matplotlib’s default of plotting dashed negative contours 
      when a single color is passed to DataArray.contour() e.g. 
      colors='k'. By Deepak Cherian.
    + Fix a bug that caused some indexing operations on arrays opened 
      with open_rasterio to error (GH2454). By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Subtracting one CFTimeIndex from another now returns a 
      pandas.TimedeltaIndex, analogous to the behavior for 
      DatetimeIndexes (GH2484). By Spencer Clark.
    + Adding a TimedeltaIndex to, or subtracting a TimedeltaIndex from 
      a CFTimeIndex is now allowed (GH2484). By Spencer Clark.
    + Avoid use of Dask’s deprecated get= parameter in tests by Matthew Rocklin.
    + An OverflowError is now accurately raised and caught during the 
      encoding process if a reference date is used that is so distant that 
      the dates must be encoded using cftime rather than NumPy (GH2272). 
      By Spencer Clark.
    + Chunked datasets can now roundtrip to Zarr storage continually with 
      to_zarr and open_zarr (GH2300). By Lily Wang.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 26 03:15:12 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 0.10.9:
  * Enhancements
    + differentiate() and differentiate() are newly added. (GH1332) By
      Keisuke Fujii.
    + Default colormap for sequential and divergent data can now be
      set via set_options() (GH2394) By Julius Busecke.
    + min_count option is newly supported in sum(), prod() and sum(),
      and prod(). (GH2230) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + plot() now accepts the kwargs xscale, yscale, xlim, ylim,
      xticks, yticks just like Pandas. Also xincrease=False,
      yincrease=False now use matplotlib’s axis inverting methods
      instead of setting limits. By Deepak Cherian. (GH2224)
    + DataArray coordinates and Dataset coordinates and data variables
      are now displayed as a b … y z rather than a b c d …. (GH1186)
      By Seth P.
    + A new CFTimeIndex-enabled cftime_range() function for use in
      generating dates from standard or non-standard calendars. By
      Spencer Clark.
    + When interpolating over a datetime64 axis, you can now provide a
      datetime string instead of a datetime64
      object. E.g. da.interp(time='1991-02-01') (GH2284) By Deepak
      Cherian.
    + A clear error message is now displayed if a set or dict is
      passed in place of an array (GH2331) By Maximilian Roos.
    + Applying unstack to a large DataArray or Dataset is now much
      faster if the MultiIndex has not been modified after stacking
      the indices. (GH1560) By Maximilian Maahn.
    + You can now control whether or not to offset the coordinates
      when using the roll method and the current behavior, coordinates
      rolled by default, raises a deprecation warning unless
      explicitly setting the keyword argument. (GH1875) By Andrew
      Huang.
    + You can now call unstack without arguments to unstack every
      MultiIndex in a DataArray or Dataset. By Julia Signell.
    + Added the ability to pass a data kwarg to copy to create a new
      object with the same metadata as the original object but using
      new values. By Julia Signell.
  * Bug fixes
    + xarray.plot.imshow() correctly uses the origin
      argument. (GH2379) By Deepak Cherian.
    + Fixed DataArray.to_iris() failure while creating DimCoord by
      falling back to creating AuxCoord. Fixed dependency on var_name
      attribute being set. (GH2201) By Thomas Voigt.
    + Fixed a bug in zarr backend which prevented use with datasets
      with invalid chunk size encoding after reading from an existing
      store (GH2278). By Joe Hamman.
    + Tests can be run in parallel with pytest-xdist By Tony Tung.
    + Follow up the renamings in dask; from dask.ghost to dask.overlap
      By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Now raises a ValueError when there is a conflict between
      dimension names and level names of MultiIndex. (GH2299) By
      Keisuke Fujii.
    + Follow up the renamings in dask; from dask.ghost to dask.overlap
      By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Now xr.apply_ufunc() raises a ValueError when the size of
      input_core_dims is inconsistent with the number of
      arguments. (GH2341) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Fixed Dataset.filter_by_attrs() behavior not matching
      netCDF4.Dataset.get_variables_by_attributes(). When more than
      one key=value is passed into Dataset.filter_by_attrs() it will
      now return a Dataset with variables which pass all the
      filters. (GH2315) By Andrew Barna.

  * Fixed a bug in rasterio backend which prevented use with distributed. The rasterio backend now returns pickleable objects (:issue:`2021`).
- update to version 0.10.6:
 * Enhancements:
  * New PseudoNetCDF backend for many Atmospheric data formats including GEOS-Chem, CAMx, NOAA arlpacked bit and many others. See :ref:`io.PseudoNetCDF` for more details. By Barron Henderson.
  * The :py:class:`Dataset` constructor now aligns :py:class:`DataArray` arguments in data_vars to indexes set explicitly in coords, where previously an error would be raised. (:issue:`674`) By Maximilian Roos.
  * :py:meth:`~DataArray.sel`, :py:meth:`~DataArray.isel` & :py:meth:`~DataArray.reindex`, (and their :py:class:`Dataset` counterparts) now support supplying a dict as a first argument, as an alternative to the existing approach of supplying kwargs. This allows for more robust behavior of dimension names which conflict with other keyword names, or are not strings. By Maximilian Roos.
  * :py:meth:`~DataArray.rename` now supports supplying **kwargs, as an alternative to the existing approach of supplying a dict as the first argument. By Maximilian Roos.

  * :py:func:`apply_ufunc` now directly validates output variables (:issue:`1931`). By Stephan Hoyer.
  * Fixed a bug where to_netcdf(..., unlimited_dims='bar') yielded NetCDF files with spurious 0-length dimensions (i.e. b, a, and r) (:issue:`2134`). By Joe Hamman.
  * Removed spurious warnings with Dataset.update(Dataset) (:issue:`2161`) and array.equals(array) when array contains NaT (:issue:`2162`). By Stephan Hoyer.
  * Aggregations with :py:meth:`Dataset.reduce` (including mean, sum, etc) no longer drop unrelated coordinates (:issue:`1470`). Also fixed a bug where non-scalar data-variables that did not include the aggregation dimension were improperly skipped. By Stephan Hoyer
  * Fix :meth:`~DataArray.stack` with non-unique coordinates on pandas 0.23 (:issue:`2160`). By Stephan Hoyer
  * Selecting data indexed by a length-1 CFTimeIndex with a slice of strings now behaves as it does when using a length-1 DatetimeIndex (i.e. it no longer falsely returns an empty array when the slice includes the value in the index) (:issue:`2165`). By Spencer Clark.
  * Fix DataArray.groupby().reduce() mutating coordinates on the input array when grouping over dimension coordinates with duplicated entries (:issue:`2153`). By Stephan Hoyer
  * Fix Dataset.to_netcdf() cannot create group with engine="h5netcdf" (:issue:`2177`). By Stephan Hoyer

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 21 04:03:17 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.10.4:
  * Documentation
    + New FAQ entry, What other projects leverage xarray?. By Deepak
      Cherian.
    + Assigning values with indexing now includes examples on how to
      select and assign values to a DataArray with .loc. By Chiara
      Lepore.
  * Enhancements
    + Add an option for using a CFTimeIndex for indexing times with
      non-standard calendars and/or outside the Timestamp-valid range;
      this index enables a subset of the functionality of a standard
      pandas.DatetimeIndex. See Non-standard calendars and dates
      outside the Timestamp-valid range for full details. (GH789,
      GH1084, GH1252) By Spencer Clark with help from Stephan Hoyer.
    + Allow for serialization of cftime.datetime objects (GH789,
      GH1084, GH2008, GH1252) using the standalone cftime library. By
      Spencer Clark.
    + Support writing lists of strings as netCDF attributes
      (GH2044). By Dan Nowacki.
    + to_netcdf() with engine='h5netcdf' now accepts h5py encoding
      settings compression and compression_opts, along with the
      NetCDF4-Python style settings gzip=True and complevel. This
      allows using any compression plugin installed in hdf5, e.g. LZF
      (GH1536). By Guido Imperiale.
    + dot() on dask-backed data will now call
      dask.array.einsum(). This greatly boosts speed and allows
      chunking on the core dims. The function now requires dask >=
      0.17.3 to work on dask-backed data (GH2074). By Guido Imperiale.
    + plot.line() learned new kwargs: xincrease, yincrease that change
      the direction of the respective axes. By Deepak Cherian.
    + Added the parallel option to open_mfdataset(). This option uses
      dask.delayed to parallelize the open and preprocessing steps
      within open_mfdataset. This is expected to provide performance
      improvements when opening many files, particularly when used in
      conjunction with dask’s multiprocessing or distributed
      schedulers (GH1981). By Joe Hamman.
    + New compute option in to_netcdf(), to_zarr(), and
      save_mfdataset() to allow for the lazy computation of netCDF and
      zarr stores. This feature is currently only supported by the
      netCDF4 and zarr backends. (GH1784). By Joe Hamman.
  * Bug fixes
    + ValueError is raised when coordinates with the wrong size are
      assigned to a DataArray. (GH2112) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Fixed a bug in rolling() with bottleneck. Also, fixed a bug in
      rolling an integer dask array. (GH2113) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Fixed a bug where keep_attrs=True flag was neglected if
      apply_ufunc() was used with Variable. (GH2114) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + When assigning a DataArray to Dataset, any conflicted
      non-dimensional coordinates of the DataArray are now
      dropped. (GH2068) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Better error handling in open_mfdataset (GH2077). By Stephan
      Hoyer.
    + plot.line() does not call autofmt_xdate() anymore. Instead it
      changes the rotation and horizontal alignment of labels without
      removing the x-axes of any other subplots in the figure (if
      any). By Deepak Cherian.
    + Colorbar limits are now determined by excluding ±Infs too. By
      Deepak Cherian.
    + Fixed to_iris to maintain lazy dask array after conversion
      (GH2046). By Alex Hilson and Stephan Hoyer.

- changes from version 0.10.3:
  * Enhancements
    + isin() and isin() methods, which test each value in the array
      for whether it is contained in the supplied list, returning a
      bool array. See Selecting values with isin for full
      details. Similar to the np.isin function. By Maximilian Roos.
    + Some speed improvement to construct DataArrayRolling object
      (GH1993) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Handle variables with different values for missing_value and
      _FillValue by masking values for both attributes; previously
      this resulted in a ValueError. (GH2016) By Ryan May.
  * Bug fixes
    + Fixed decode_cf function to operate lazily on dask arrays
      (GH1372). By Ryan Abernathey.
    + Fixed labeled indexing with slice bounds given by xarray objects
      with datetime64 or timedelta64 dtypes (GH1240). By Stephan
      Hoyer.
    + Attempting to convert an xarray.Dataset into a numpy array now
      raises an informative error message. By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Fixed a bug in decode_cf_datetime where int32 arrays weren’t
      parsed correctly (GH2002). By Fabien Maussion.
    + When calling xr.auto_combine() or xr.open_mfdataset() with a
      concat_dim, the resulting dataset will have that one-element
      dimension (it was silently dropped, previously) (GH1988). By Ben
      Root.

Sat Mar 24 00:09:34 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.10.2:
  * Backwards incompatible changes
    + The addition of __array_ufunc__ for xarray objects (see below)
      means that NumPy ufunc methods (e.g., np.add.reduce) that
      previously worked on xarray.DataArray objects by converting them
      into NumPy arrays will now raise NotImplementedError instead. In
      all cases, the work-around is simple: convert your objects
      explicitly into NumPy arrays before calling the ufunc (e.g.,
      with .values).
  * Enhancements
    + Added dot(), equivalent to np.einsum(). Also, dot() now supports
      dims option, which specifies the dimensions to sum
      over. (GH1951) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Support for writing xarray datasets to netCDF files (netcdf4
      backend only) when using the dask.distributed scheduler
      (GH1464). By Joe Hamman.
    + Support lazy vectorized-indexing. After this change, flexible
      indexing such as orthogonal/vectorized indexing, becomes
      possible for all the backend arrays. Also, lazy transpose is now
      also supported. (GH1897) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Implemented NumPy’s __array_ufunc__ protocol for all xarray
      objects (GH1617). This enables using NumPy ufuncs directly on
      xarray.Dataset objects with recent versions of NumPy (v1.13 and
      newer):
         In [1]: ds = xr.Dataset({'a': 1})

         In [2]: np.sin(ds)
         Out[2]:
         <xarray.Dataset>
         Dimensions:  ()
         Data variables:
             a        float64 0.8415

      This obliviates the need for the xarray.ufuncs module, which
      will be deprecated in the future when xarray drops support for
      older versions of NumPy. By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Improve rolling() logic. DataArrayRolling() object now supports
      construct() method that returns a view of the DataArray /
      Dataset object with the rolling-window dimension added to the
      last axis. This enables more flexible operation, such as strided
      rolling, windowed rolling, ND-rolling, short-time FFT and
      convolution. (GH1831, GH1142, GH819) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + line() learned to make plots with data on x-axis if so
      specified. (GH575) By Deepak Cherian.
  * Bug fixes
    + Raise an informative error message when using apply_ufunc with
      numpy v1.11 (GH1956). By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Fix the precision drop after indexing datetime64 arrays
      (GH1932). By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Silenced irrelevant warnings issued by open_rasterio
      (GH1964). By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Fix kwarg colors clashing with auto-inferred cmap (GH1461) By
      Deepak Cherian.
    + Fix imshow() error when passed an RGB array with size one in a
      spatial dimension. By Zac Hatfield-Dodds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 28 13:02:36 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Rename package to python3-xray to match upstream naming.
- update to version 0.7.0:
  * The project formerly known as "xray" is now "xarray", pronounced "x-array"!
    This avoids a namespace conflict with the entire field of x-ray science. Renaming
    our project seemed like the right thing to do, especially because some
    scientists who work with actual x-rays are interested in using this project in
    their work. Thanks for your understanding and patience in this transition. 
  * Breaking changes
    - The internal data model used by :py:class:`~xray.DataArray` has been
      rewritten to fix several outstanding issues. Internally, ``DataArray``
      is now implemented in terms of ``._variable`` and ``._coords`` 
      attributes instead of holding variables in a ``Dataset`` object.
    - It is no longer possible to convert a DataArray to a Dataset with
      :py:meth:`xray.DataArray.to_dataset` if it is unnamed. This will now
      raise ``ValueError``. If the array is unnamed, you need to supply the
      ``name`` argument.
  * Enhancements
    - Basic support for :py:class:`~pandas.MultiIndex` coordinates on xray objects, including
      indexing, :py:meth:`~DataArray.stack` and :py:meth:`~DataArray.unstack`:
    - Support for reading GRIB, HDF4 and other file formats via PyNIO_. See
      :ref:`io.pynio` for more details.
    - Better error message when a variable is supplied with the same name as
      one of its dimensions.
    - Plotting: more control on colormap parameters (:issue:`642`). ``vmin`` and
      ``vmax`` will not be silently ignored anymore. Setting ``center=False``
      prevents automatic selection of a divergent colormap.
    - New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.shift` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.roll` methods
      for shifting/rotating datasets or arrays along a dimension
    - Assigning a ``pandas`` object directly as a ``Dataset`` variable is now permitted. Its
      index names correspond to the ``dims`` of the ``Dataset``, and its data is aligned.
    - Passing a :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame` or :py:class:`pandas.Panel` to a Dataset constructor
      is now permitted.
    - New function :py:func:`~xray.broadcast` for explicitly broadcasting
      ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset`` objects against each other. 
  * Bug fixes
    - Fixes for several issues found on ``DataArray`` objects with the same name
      as one of their coordinates (see :ref:`v0.7.0.breaking` for more details).
    - ``DataArray.to_masked_array`` always returns masked array with mask being an
      array (not a scalar value) (:issue:`684`)
    - Allows for (imperfect) repr of Coords when underlying index is PeriodIndex (:issue:`645`).
    - Fixes for several issues found on ``DataArray`` objects with the same name
      as one of their coordinates (see :ref:`v0.7.0.breaking` for more details).
    - Attempting to assign a ``Dataset`` or ``DataArray`` variable/attribute using
      attribute-style syntax (e.g., ``ds.foo = 42``) now raises an error rather
      than silently failing (:issue:`656`, :issue:`714`).
    - You can now pass pandas objects with non-numpy dtypes (e.g., ``categorical``
      or ``datetime64`` with a timezone) into xray without an error
      (:issue:`716`).
- update to version 0.6.1:
  * The handling of colormaps and discrete color lists for 2D plots in
    :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.plot` was changed to provide more
    compatibility with matplotlib's contour and contourf functions
    (:issue:`538`). Now discrete lists of colors should be specified
    using colors keyword, rather than cmap.
  * Faceted plotting through :py:class:`~xray.plot.FacetGrid` and the
    :py:meth:`~xray.plot.plot` method. See :ref:`plotting.faceting`
    for more details and examples.
  * :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.sel` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.reindex`
    now support the tolerance argument for controlling
    nearest-neighbor selection (:issue:`629`):
    This feature requires pandas v0.17 or newer.
  * New encoding argument in :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` for
    writing netCDF files with compression, as described in the new
    documentation section on :ref:`io.netcdf.writing_encoded`.
  * Add :py:attr:`~xray.Dataset.real` and
    :py:attr:`~xray.Dataset.imag` attributes to Dataset and DataArray
    (:issue:`553`).
  * More informative error message with
    :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.from_dataframe` if the frame has duplicate
    columns.
  * xray now uses deterministic names for dask arrays it creates or
    opens from disk. This allows xray users to take advantage of
    dask's nascent support for caching intermediate computation
    results. See :issue:`555` for an example.
  * Forwards compatibility with the latest pandas release
    (v0.17.0). We were using some internal pandas routines for
    datetime conversion, which unfortunately have now changed upstream
    (:issue:`569`).
  * Aggregation functions now correctly skip NaN for data for
    complex128 dtype (:issue:`554`).
  * Fixed indexing 0d arrays with unicode dtype (:issue:`568`).
  * :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.name` and Dataset keys must be a string
    or None to be written to netCDF (:issue:`533`).
  * :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.where` now uses dask instead of numpy if
    either the array or other is a dask array. Previously, if other
    was a numpy array the method was evaluated eagerly.
  * Global attributes are now handled more consistently when loading
    remote datasets using engine='pydap' (:issue:`574`).
  * It is now possible to assign to the .data attribute of DataArray
    objects.
  * coordinates attribute is now kept in the encoding dictionary after
    decoding (:issue:`610`).
  * Compatibility with numpy 1.10 (:issue:`617
- update to version 0.6.0:
  * Plotting methods have been implemented on DataArray objects
    :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.plot` through integration with matplotlib
    (:issue:`185`). For an introduction, see :ref:`plotting`.
  * Variables in netCDF files with multiple missing values are now decoded as
    NaN after issuing a warning if open_dataset is called with
    mask_and_scale=True.
  * We clarified our rules for when the result from an xray operation is a copy
    vs. a view (see :ref:`copies vs views` for more details).
  * Dataset variables are now written to netCDF files in order of appearance
    when using the netcdf4 backend (:issue:`479`).
  * Added :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.isel_points` and
    :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.sel_points` to support pointwise indexing of
    Datasets and DataArrays (:issue:`475`).
  * New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.where` method for masking xray objects
    according to some criteria. This works particularly well with
    multi-dimensional data:
  * Added new methods :py:meth:`DataArray.diff <xray.DataArray.diff>` and
    :py:meth:`Dataset.diff <xray.Dataset.diff>` for finite difference
    calculations along a given axis.
  * New :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.to_masked_array` convenience method for
    returning a numpy.ma.MaskedArray.
  * Added new flag "drop_variables" to :py:meth:`~xray.open_dataset` for
    excluding variables from being parsed. This may be useful to drop variables
    with problems or inconsistent values.
  * Fixed aggregation functions (e.g., sum and mean) on big-endian arrays when
    bottleneck is installed (:issue:`489`).
  * Dataset aggregation functions dropped variables with unsigned integer dtype
    (:issue:`505`).

    arrays.
  * Fixed an error when attempting to saving datetime64 variables to netCDF
    files when the first element is NaT (:issue:`528`).
  * Fix pickle on DataArray objects (:issue:`515`).
  * Fixed unnecessary coercion of float64 to float32 when using netcdf3 and
    netcdf4_classic formats (:issue:`526`).
