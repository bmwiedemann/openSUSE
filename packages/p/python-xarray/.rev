    <comment>- update to version 0.10.7:
 * Enhancements:
  * Plot labels now make use of metadata that follow CF conventions (:issue:`2135`). By Deepak Cherian and Ryan Abernathey.
  * Line plots now support facetting with row and col arguments (:issue:`2107`). By Yohai Bar Sinai.
  * :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.interp` and :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.interp` methods are newly added. See :ref:`interpolating values with interp` for the detail. (:issue:`2079`) By Keisuke Fujii.
 * Bug fixes:
  * Fixed a bug in rasterio backend which prevented use with distributed. The rasterio backend now returns pickleable objects (:issue:`2021`).
- update to version 0.10.6:
 * Enhancements:
  * New PseudoNetCDF backend for many Atmospheric data formats including GEOS-Chem, CAMx, NOAA arlpacked bit and many others. See :ref:`io.PseudoNetCDF` for more details. By Barron Henderson.
  * The :py:class:`Dataset` constructor now aligns :py:class:`DataArray` arguments in data_vars to indexes set explicitly in coords, where previously an error would be raised. (:issue:`674`) By Maximilian Roos.
  * :py:meth:`~DataArray.sel`, :py:meth:`~DataArray.isel` &amp; :py:meth:`~DataArray.reindex`, (and their :py:class:`Dataset` counterparts) now support supplying a dict as a first argument, as an alternative to the existing approach of supplying kwargs. This allows for more robust behavior of dimension names which conflict with other keyword names, or are not strings. By Maximilian Roos.
  * :py:meth:`~DataArray.rename` now supports supplying **kwargs, as an alternative to the existing approach of supplying a dict as the first argument. By Maximilian Roos.
  * :py:meth:`~DataArray.cumsum` and :py:meth:`~DataArray.cumprod` now support aggregation over multiple dimensions at the same time. This is the default behavior when dimensions are not specified (previously this raised an error). By Stephan Hoyer
  * :py:meth:`DataArray.dot` and :py:func:`dot` are partly supported with older dask&lt;0.17.4. (related to :issue:`2203`) By Keisuke Fujii.
  * Xarray now uses Versioneer to manage its version strings. (:issue:`1300`). By Joe Hamman.
 * Bug fixes:
  * Fixed a regression in 0.10.4, where explicitly specifying dtype='S1' or dtype=str in encoding with to_netcdf() raised an error (:issue:`2149`). Stephan Hoyer
  * :py:func:`apply_ufunc` now directly validates output variables (:issue:`1931`). By Stephan Hoyer.
  * Fixed a bug where to_netcdf(..., unlimited_dims='bar') yielded NetCDF files with spurious 0-length dimensions (i.e. b, a, and r) (:issue:`2134`). By Joe Hamman.
  * Removed spurious warnings with Dataset.update(Dataset) (:issue:`2161`) and array.equals(array) when array contains NaT (:issue:`2162`). By Stephan Hoyer.
  * Aggregations with :py:meth:`Dataset.reduce` (including mean, sum, etc) no longer drop unrelated coordinates (:issue:`1470`). Also fixed a bug where non-scalar data-variables that did not include the aggregation dimension were improperly skipped. By Stephan Hoyer
  * Fix :meth:`~DataArray.stack` with non-unique coordinates on pandas 0.23 (:issue:`2160`). By Stephan Hoyer
  * Selecting data indexed by a length-1 CFTimeIndex with a slice of strings now behaves as it does when using a length-1 DatetimeIndex (i.e. it no longer falsely returns an empty array when the slice includes the value in the index) (:issue:`2165`). By Spencer Clark.
  * Fix DataArray.groupby().reduce() mutating coordinates on the input array when grouping over dimension coordinates with duplicated entries (:issue:`2153`). By Stephan Hoyer
  * Fix Dataset.to_netcdf() cannot create group with engine=&quot;h5netcdf&quot; (:issue:`2177`). By Stephan Hoyer
- update to version 0.10.4:
  * Documentation
    + New FAQ entry, What other projects leverage xarray?. By Deepak
      Cherian.
    + Assigning values with indexing now includes examples on how to
      select and assign values to a DataArray with .loc. By Chiara
      Lepore.
  * Enhancements
    + Add an option for using a CFTimeIndex for indexing times with
      non-standard calendars and/or outside the Timestamp-valid range;
      this index enables a subset of the functionality of a standard
      pandas.DatetimeIndex. See Non-standard calendars and dates
      outside the Timestamp-valid range for full details. (GH789,
      GH1084, GH1252) By Spencer Clark with help from Stephan Hoyer.
    + Allow for serialization of cftime.datetime objects (GH789,
      GH1084, GH2008, GH1252) using the standalone cftime library. By
      Spencer Clark.
    + Support writing lists of strings as netCDF attributes
      (GH2044). By Dan Nowacki.
    + to_netcdf() with engine='h5netcdf' now accepts h5py encoding
      settings compression and compression_opts, along with the
      NetCDF4-Python style settings gzip=True and complevel. This
      allows using any compression plugin installed in hdf5, e.g. LZF
      (GH1536). By Guido Imperiale.
    + dot() on dask-backed data will now call
      dask.array.einsum(). This greatly boosts speed and allows
      chunking on the core dims. The function now requires dask &gt;=
      0.17.3 to work on dask-backed data (GH2074). By Guido Imperiale.
    + plot.line() learned new kwargs: xincrease, yincrease that change
      the direction of the respective axes. By Deepak Cherian.
    + Added the parallel option to open_mfdataset(). This option uses
      dask.delayed to parallelize the open and preprocessing steps
      within open_mfdataset. This is expected to provide performance
      improvements when opening many files, particularly when used in
      conjunction with dask’s multiprocessing or distributed
      schedulers (GH1981). By Joe Hamman.
    + New compute option in to_netcdf(), to_zarr(), and
      save_mfdataset() to allow for the lazy computation of netCDF and
      zarr stores. This feature is currently only supported by the
      netCDF4 and zarr backends. (GH1784). By Joe Hamman.
  * Bug fixes
    + ValueError is raised when coordinates with the wrong size are
      assigned to a DataArray. (GH2112) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Fixed a bug in rolling() with bottleneck. Also, fixed a bug in
      rolling an integer dask array. (GH2113) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Fixed a bug where keep_attrs=True flag was neglected if
      apply_ufunc() was used with Variable. (GH2114) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + When assigning a DataArray to Dataset, any conflicted
      non-dimensional coordinates of the DataArray are now
      dropped. (GH2068) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Better error handling in open_mfdataset (GH2077). By Stephan
      Hoyer.
    + plot.line() does not call autofmt_xdate() anymore. Instead it
      changes the rotation and horizontal alignment of labels without
      removing the x-axes of any other subplots in the figure (if
      any). By Deepak Cherian.
    + Colorbar limits are now determined by excluding ±Infs too. By
      Deepak Cherian.
    + Fixed to_iris to maintain lazy dask array after conversion
      (GH2046). By Alex Hilson and Stephan Hoyer.
- changes from version 0.10.3:
  * Enhancements
    + isin() and isin() methods, which test each value in the array
      for whether it is contained in the supplied list, returning a
      bool array. See Selecting values with isin for full
      details. Similar to the np.isin function. By Maximilian Roos.
    + Some speed improvement to construct DataArrayRolling object
      (GH1993) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Handle variables with different values for missing_value and
      _FillValue by masking values for both attributes; previously
      this resulted in a ValueError. (GH2016) By Ryan May.
  * Bug fixes
    + Fixed decode_cf function to operate lazily on dask arrays
      (GH1372). By Ryan Abernathey.
    + Fixed labeled indexing with slice bounds given by xarray objects
      with datetime64 or timedelta64 dtypes (GH1240). By Stephan
      Hoyer.
    + Attempting to convert an xarray.Dataset into a numpy array now
      raises an informative error message. By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Fixed a bug in decode_cf_datetime where int32 arrays weren’t
      parsed correctly (GH2002). By Fabien Maussion.
    + When calling xr.auto_combine() or xr.open_mfdataset() with a
      concat_dim, the resulting dataset will have that one-element
      dimension (it was silently dropped, previously) (GH1988). By Ben
      Root.
- temporarily deactivated tests because of minor issues with netCDF library
  see https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/2050
- update to version 0.10.3:
 * Enhancements
  - :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.isin` and :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.isin` methods,
    which test each value in the array for whether it is contained in the
    supplied list, returning a bool array. See :ref:`selecting values with isin`
    for full details. Similar to the ``np.isin`` function.
    By `Maximilian Roos &lt;https://github.com/maxim-lian&gt;`_.
  - Some speed improvement to construct :py:class:`~xarray.DataArrayRolling`
    object (:issue:`1993`)
    By `Keisuke Fujii &lt;https://github.com/fujiisoup&gt;`_.
  - Handle variables with different values for ``missing_value`` and
    ``_FillValue`` by masking values for both attributes; previously this
    resulted in a ``ValueError``. (:issue:`2016`)
    By `Ryan May &lt;https://github.com/dopplershift&gt;`_.
 * Bug fixes
  - Fixed ``decode_cf`` function to operate lazily on dask arrays
    (:issue:`1372`). By `Ryan Abernathey &lt;https://github.com/rabernat&gt;`_.
  - Fixed labeled indexing with slice bounds given by xarray objects with
    datetime64 or timedelta64 dtypes (:issue:`1240`).
    By `Stephan Hoyer &lt;https://github.com/shoyer&gt;`_.
  - Attempting to convert an xarray.Dataset into a numpy array now raises an
    informative error message.
    By `Stephan Hoyer &lt;https://github.com/shoyer&gt;`_.
  - Fixed a bug in decode_cf_datetime where ``int32`` arrays weren't parsed
    correctly (:issue:`2002`).
    By `Fabien Maussion &lt;https://github.com/fmaussion&gt;`_.
  - When calling `xr.auto_combine()` or `xr.open_mfdataset()` with a `concat_dim`,
    the resulting dataset will have that one-element dimension (it was
    silently dropped, previously) (:issue:`1988`).
    By `Ben Root &lt;https://github.com/WeatherGod&gt;`_.
- update to version 0.10.2:
  * Backwards incompatible changes
    + The addition of __array_ufunc__ for xarray objects (see below)
      means that NumPy ufunc methods (e.g., np.add.reduce) that
      previously worked on xarray.DataArray objects by converting them
      into NumPy arrays will now raise NotImplementedError instead. In
      all cases, the work-around is simple: convert your objects
      explicitly into NumPy arrays before calling the ufunc (e.g.,
      with .values).
  * Enhancements
    + Added dot(), equivalent to np.einsum(). Also, dot() now supports
      dims option, which specifies the dimensions to sum
      over. (GH1951) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Support for writing xarray datasets to netCDF files (netcdf4
      backend only) when using the dask.distributed scheduler
      (GH1464). By Joe Hamman.
    + Support lazy vectorized-indexing. After this change, flexible
      indexing such as orthogonal/vectorized indexing, becomes
      possible for all the backend arrays. Also, lazy transpose is now
      also supported. (GH1897) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Implemented NumPy’s __array_ufunc__ protocol for all xarray
      objects (GH1617). This enables using NumPy ufuncs directly on
      xarray.Dataset objects with recent versions of NumPy (v1.13 and
      newer):
         In [1]: ds = xr.Dataset({'a': 1})
         In [2]: np.sin(ds)
         Out[2]:
         &lt;xarray.Dataset&gt;
         Dimensions:  ()
         Data variables:
             a        float64 0.8415
      This obliviates the need for the xarray.ufuncs module, which
      will be deprecated in the future when xarray drops support for
      older versions of NumPy. By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Improve rolling() logic. DataArrayRolling() object now supports
      construct() method that returns a view of the DataArray /
      Dataset object with the rolling-window dimension added to the
      last axis. This enables more flexible operation, such as strided
      rolling, windowed rolling, ND-rolling, short-time FFT and
      convolution. (GH1831, GH1142, GH819) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + line() learned to make plots with data on x-axis if so
      specified. (GH575) By Deepak Cherian.
  * Bug fixes
    + Raise an informative error message when using apply_ufunc with
      numpy v1.11 (GH1956). By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Fix the precision drop after indexing datetime64 arrays
      (GH1932). By Keisuke Fujii.
    + Silenced irrelevant warnings issued by open_rasterio
      (GH1964). By Stephan Hoyer.
    + Fix kwarg colors clashing with auto-inferred cmap (GH1461) By
      Deepak Cherian.
    + Fix imshow() error when passed an RGB array with size one in a
      spatial dimension. By Zac Hatfield-Dodds.
- Replace future goals and aims by present capabilities.
- update to version 0.10.1:
 * please see upstream changelog at: https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/v0.10.1/doc/whats-new.rst
- remove check boundary condition
- run spec-cleaner
- use %license for license
- Implement single-spec version
- Update to 0.9.6
  * Please see changelog at:
    https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/v0.9.6/doc/whats-new.rst
- Rename package to python3-xray to match upstream naming.
- update to version 0.7.0:
  * The project formerly known as &quot;xray&quot; is now &quot;xarray&quot;, pronounced &quot;x-array&quot;!
    This avoids a namespace conflict with the entire field of x-ray science. Renaming
    our project seemed like the right thing to do, especially because some
    scientists who work with actual x-rays are interested in using this project in
    their work. Thanks for your understanding and patience in this transition. 
  * Breaking changes
    - The internal data model used by :py:class:`~xray.DataArray` has been
      rewritten to fix several outstanding issues. Internally, ``DataArray``
      is now implemented in terms of ``._variable`` and ``._coords`` 
      attributes instead of holding variables in a ``Dataset`` object.
    - It is no longer possible to convert a DataArray to a Dataset with
      :py:meth:`xray.DataArray.to_dataset` if it is unnamed. This will now
      raise ``ValueError``. If the array is unnamed, you need to supply the
      ``name`` argument.
  * Enhancements
    - Basic support for :py:class:`~pandas.MultiIndex` coordinates on xray objects, including
      indexing, :py:meth:`~DataArray.stack` and :py:meth:`~DataArray.unstack`:
    - Support for reading GRIB, HDF4 and other file formats via PyNIO_. See
      :ref:`io.pynio` for more details.
    - Better error message when a variable is supplied with the same name as
      one of its dimensions.
    - Plotting: more control on colormap parameters (:issue:`642`). ``vmin`` and
      ``vmax`` will not be silently ignored anymore. Setting ``center=False``
      prevents automatic selection of a divergent colormap.
    - New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.shift` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.roll` methods
      for shifting/rotating datasets or arrays along a dimension
    - Assigning a ``pandas`` object directly as a ``Dataset`` variable is now permitted. Its
      index names correspond to the ``dims`` of the ``Dataset``, and its data is aligned.
    - Passing a :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame` or :py:class:`pandas.Panel` to a Dataset constructor
      is now permitted.
    - New function :py:func:`~xray.broadcast` for explicitly broadcasting
      ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset`` objects against each other. 
  * Bug fixes
    - Fixes for several issues found on ``DataArray`` objects with the same name
      as one of their coordinates (see :ref:`v0.7.0.breaking` for more details).
    - ``DataArray.to_masked_array`` always returns masked array with mask being an
      array (not a scalar value) (:issue:`684`)
    - Allows for (imperfect) repr of Coords when underlying index is PeriodIndex (:issue:`645`).
    - Fixes for several issues found on ``DataArray`` objects with the same name
      as one of their coordinates (see :ref:`v0.7.0.breaking` for more details).
    - Attempting to assign a ``Dataset`` or ``DataArray`` variable/attribute using
      attribute-style syntax (e.g., ``ds.foo = 42``) now raises an error rather
      than silently failing (:issue:`656`, :issue:`714`).
    - You can now pass pandas objects with non-numpy dtypes (e.g., ``categorical``
      or ``datetime64`` with a timezone) into xray without an error
      (:issue:`716`).
- update to version 0.6.1:
  * The handling of colormaps and discrete color lists for 2D plots in
    :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.plot` was changed to provide more
    compatibility with matplotlib's contour and contourf functions
    (:issue:`538`). Now discrete lists of colors should be specified
    using colors keyword, rather than cmap.
  * Faceted plotting through :py:class:`~xray.plot.FacetGrid` and the
    :py:meth:`~xray.plot.plot` method. See :ref:`plotting.faceting`
    for more details and examples.
  * :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.sel` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.reindex`
    now support the tolerance argument for controlling
    nearest-neighbor selection (:issue:`629`):
    This feature requires pandas v0.17 or newer.
  * New encoding argument in :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` for
    writing netCDF files with compression, as described in the new
    documentation section on :ref:`io.netcdf.writing_encoded`.
  * Add :py:attr:`~xray.Dataset.real` and
    :py:attr:`~xray.Dataset.imag` attributes to Dataset and DataArray
    (:issue:`553`).
  * More informative error message with
    :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.from_dataframe` if the frame has duplicate
    columns.
  * xray now uses deterministic names for dask arrays it creates or
    opens from disk. This allows xray users to take advantage of
    dask's nascent support for caching intermediate computation
    results. See :issue:`555` for an example.
  * Forwards compatibility with the latest pandas release
    (v0.17.0). We were using some internal pandas routines for
    datetime conversion, which unfortunately have now changed upstream
    (:issue:`569`).
  * Aggregation functions now correctly skip NaN for data for
    complex128 dtype (:issue:`554`).
  * Fixed indexing 0d arrays with unicode dtype (:issue:`568`).
  * :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.name` and Dataset keys must be a string
    or None to be written to netCDF (:issue:`533`).
  * :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.where` now uses dask instead of numpy if
    either the array or other is a dask array. Previously, if other
    was a numpy array the method was evaluated eagerly.
  * Global attributes are now handled more consistently when loading
    remote datasets using engine='pydap' (:issue:`574`).
  * It is now possible to assign to the .data attribute of DataArray
    objects.
  * coordinates attribute is now kept in the encoding dictionary after
    decoding (:issue:`610`).
  * Compatibility with numpy 1.10 (:issue:`617
- update to version 0.6.0:
  * Plotting methods have been implemented on DataArray objects
    :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.plot` through integration with matplotlib
    (:issue:`185`). For an introduction, see :ref:`plotting`.
  * Variables in netCDF files with multiple missing values are now decoded as
    NaN after issuing a warning if open_dataset is called with
    mask_and_scale=True.
  * We clarified our rules for when the result from an xray operation is a copy
    vs. a view (see :ref:`copies vs views` for more details).
  * Dataset variables are now written to netCDF files in order of appearance
    when using the netcdf4 backend (:issue:`479`).
  * Added :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.isel_points` and
    :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.sel_points` to support pointwise indexing of
    Datasets and DataArrays (:issue:`475`).
  * New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.where` method for masking xray objects
    according to some criteria. This works particularly well with
    multi-dimensional data:
  * Added new methods :py:meth:`DataArray.diff &lt;xray.DataArray.diff&gt;` and
    :py:meth:`Dataset.diff &lt;xray.Dataset.diff&gt;` for finite difference
    calculations along a given axis.
  * New :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.to_masked_array` convenience method for
    returning a numpy.ma.MaskedArray.
  * Added new flag &quot;drop_variables&quot; to :py:meth:`~xray.open_dataset` for
    excluding variables from being parsed. This may be useful to drop variables
    with problems or inconsistent values.
  * Fixed aggregation functions (e.g., sum and mean) on big-endian arrays when
    bottleneck is installed (:issue:`489`).
  * Dataset aggregation functions dropped variables with unsigned integer dtype
    (:issue:`505`).
  * .any() and .all() were not lazy when used on xray objects containing dask
    arrays.
  * Fixed an error when attempting to saving datetime64 variables to netCDF
    files when the first element is NaT (:issue:`528`).
  * Fix pickle on DataArray objects (:issue:`515`).
  * Fixed unnecessary coercion of float64 to float32 when using netcdf3 and
    netcdf4_classic formats (:issue:`526`).

  * Enhancements
    + differentiate() and differentiate() are newly added. (GH1332) By
      Keisuke Fujii.
    + Default colormap for sequential and divergent data can now be
      set via set_options() (GH2394) By Julius Busecke.
    + min_count option is newly supported in sum(), prod() and sum(),
      and prod(). (GH2230) By Keisuke Fujii.
    + plot() now accepts the kwargs xscale, yscale, xlim, ylim,
      xticks, yticks just like Pandas. Also xincrease=False,
      yincrease=False now use matplotlib’s axis inverting methods
      instead of setting limits. By Deepak Cherian. (GH2224)
    + DataArray coordinates and Dataset coordinates and data variables
      are now displayed as a b … y z rather than a b c d …. (GH1186)
      By Seth P.
    + A new CFTimeIndex-enabled cftime_range() function for use in
      generating dates from standard or non-standard calendars. By
      Spencer Clark.
    + When interpolating over a datetime64 axis, you can now provide a
      datetime string instead of a datetime64
      object. E.g. da.interp(time='1991-02-01') (GH2284) By Deepak
      Cherian.
    + A clear error message is now displayed if a set or dict is
      passed in place of an array (GH2331) By Maximilian Roos.
    + Applying unstack to a large DataArray or Dataset is now much
      faster if the MultiIndex has not been modified after stacking
      the indices. (GH1560) By Maximilian Maahn.
    + You can now control whether or not to offset the coordinates

    <comment>- update to version 0.11.0
  * Enhancements
    + xarray.DataArray.plot.line() can now accept multidimensional 
      coordinate variables as input. hue must be a dimension name 
      in this case. (GH2407) By Deepak Cherian.
    + Added support for Python 3.7. (GH2271). By Joe Hamman.
    + Added support for plotting data with pandas.Interval coordinates, 
      such as those created by groupby_bins() By Maximilian Maahn.
    + Added shift() for shifting the values of a CFTimeIndex by a 
      specified frequency. (GH2244). By Spencer Clark.
    + Added support for using cftime.datetime coordinates with 
      differentiate(), differentiate(), interp(), and interp(). 
      By Spencer Clark
    + There is now a global option to either always keep or always 
      discard dataset and dataarray attrs upon operations. The option 
      is set with xarray.set_options(keep_attrs=True), and the default 
      is to use the old behaviour. By Tom Nicholas.
    + Added a new backend for the GRIB file format based on ECMWF 
      cfgrib python driver and ecCodes C-library. (GH2475) By 
      Alessandro Amici, sponsored by ECMWF.
    + Resample now supports a dictionary mapping from dimension to 
      frequency as its first argument, e.g., 
      data.resample({'time': '1D'}).mean(). This is consistent with 
      other xarray functions that accept either dictionaries or 
      keyword arguments. By Stephan Hoyer.
    + The preferred way to access tutorial data is now to load it 
      lazily with xarray.tutorial.open_dataset(). 
      xarray.tutorial.load_dataset() calls Dataset.load() prior to 
      returning (and is now deprecated). This was changed in order 
      to facilitate using tutorial datasets with dask. By Joe Hamman. (forwarded request 648746 from mcalabkova)</comment>

    <version>0.11.2</version>
    <time>1548335681</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 0.11.2:
 - Removes inadvertently introduced setup dependency on pytest-runner (:issue:`2641`). Otherwise, this release is exactly equivalent to 0.11.1.
 - Warning:
  - This is the last xarray release that will support Python 2.7. Future releases will be Python 3 only, but older versions of xarray will always be available for Python 2.7 users. For the more details, see:
- update to version 0.11.1:
 - Breaking changes
  - Minimum rasterio version increased from 0.36 to 1.0 (for open_rasterio)
  - Time bounds variables are now also decoded according to CF conventions (:issue:`2565`). The previous behavior was to decode them only if they had specific time attributes, now these attributes are copied automatically from the corresponding time coordinate. This might brake downstream code that was relying on these variables to be not decoded. By Fabien Maussion.
 - Enhancements
  - Ability to read and write consolidated metadata in zarr stores (:issue:`2558`). By Ryan Abernathey.
  - :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` uses slicing for string indexing when possible (like :py:class:`pandas.DatetimeIndex`), which avoids unnecessary copies. By Stephan Hoyer
  - Enable passing rasterio.io.DatasetReader or rasterio.vrt.WarpedVRT to open_rasterio instead of file path string. Allows for in-memory reprojection, see (:issue:`2588`). By Scott Henderson.
  - Like :py:class:`pandas.DatetimeIndex`, :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` now supports &quot;dayofyear&quot; and &quot;dayofweek&quot; accessors (:issue:`2597`). Note this requires a version of cftime greater than 1.0.2. By Spencer Clark.
  - The option 'warn_for_unclosed_files' (False by default) has been added to allow users to enable a warning when files opened by xarray are deallocated but were not explicitly closed. This is mostly useful for debugging; we recommend enabling it in your test suites if you use xarray for IO. By Stephan Hoyer
  - Support Dask HighLevelGraphs by Matthew Rocklin.
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.resample` and :py:meth:`Dataset.resample` now supports the loffset kwarg just like Pandas. By Deepak Cherian
  - Datasets are now guaranteed to have a 'source' encoding, so the source file name is always stored (:issue:`2550`). By Tom Nicholas.
  - The apply methods for DatasetGroupBy, DataArrayGroupBy, DatasetResample and DataArrayResample now support passing positional arguments to the applied function as a tuple to the args argument. By Matti Eskelinen.
  - 0d slices of ndarrays are now obtained directly through indexing, rather than extracting and wrapping a scalar, avoiding unnecessary copying. By Daniel Wennberg.
  - Added support for fill_value with :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.shift` and :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.shift` By Maximilian Roos
 - Bug fixes
  - Ensure files are automatically closed, if possible, when no longer referenced by a Python variable (:issue:`2560`). By Stephan Hoyer
  - Fixed possible race conditions when reading/writing to disk in parallel (:issue:`2595`). By Stephan Hoyer
  - Fix h5netcdf saving scalars with filters or chunks (:issue:`2563`). By Martin Raspaud.
  - Fix parsing of _Unsigned attribute set by OPENDAP servers. (:issue:`2583`). By Deepak Cherian
  - Fix failure in time encoding when exporting to netCDF with versions of pandas less than 0.21.1 (:issue:`2623`). By Spencer Clark.
  - Fix MultiIndex selection to update label and level (:issue:`2619`). By Keisuke Fujii.

    <comment>- update to version 0.12.3:
 - New functions/methods:
  - New methods :py:meth:`Dataset.to_stacked_array` and
    :py:meth:`DataArray.to_unstacked_dataset` for reshaping Datasets of variables
    with different dimensions
    (:issue:`1317`).
    This is useful for feeding data from xarray into machine learning models,
    as described in :ref:`reshape.stacking_different`.
 - Enhancements:
  - Support for renaming ``Dataset`` variables and dimensions independently
    with :py:meth:`~Dataset.rename_vars` and :py:meth:`~Dataset.rename_dims`
    (:issue:`3026`).
  - Add ``scales``, ``offsets``, ``units`` and ``descriptions``
    attributes to :py:class:`~xarray.DataArray` returned by
    :py:func:`~xarray.open_rasterio`. (:issue:`3013`)
 - Bug fixes:
  - Resolved deprecation warnings from newer versions of matplotlib and dask.
  - Compatibility fixes for the upcoming pandas 0.25 and NumPy 1.17 releases.
  - Fix summaries for multiindex coordinates (:issue:`3079`).
  - Fix HDF5 error that could arise when reading multiple groups from a file at
    once (:issue:`2954`).</comment>

    <time>1580990892</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 0.15.0:
 - This release brings many improvements to xarray's documentation: our examples are now binderized notebooks (`click here &lt;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/master?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/weather-data.ipynb&gt;`_):
 - and we have new example notebooks from our SciPy 2019 sprint (many thanks to our contributors!).:
 - This release also features many API improvements such as a new:
:py:class:`~core.accessor_dt.TimedeltaAccessor` and support for :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` in
:py:meth:`~DataArray.interpolate_na`); as well as many bug fixes.
 - Breaking changes:
  - Bumped minimum tested versions for dependencies:
    - numpy 1.15
    - pandas 0.25
    - dask 2.2
    - distributed 2.2
    - scipy 1.3
  - Remove ``compat`` and ``encoding`` kwargs from ``DataArray``, which
    have been deprecated since 0.12. (:pull:`3650`).
    Instead, specify the ``encoding`` kwarg when writing to disk or set
    the :py:attr:`DataArray.encoding` attribute directly.
    By `Maximilian Roos &lt;https://github.com/max-sixty&gt;`_.
  - :py:func:`xarray.dot`, :py:meth:`DataArray.dot`, and the ``@`` operator now
    use ``align=&quot;inner&quot;`` (except when ``xarray.set_options(arithmetic_join=&quot;exact&quot;)``;
    :issue:`3694`) by `Mathias Hauser &lt;https://github.com/mathause&gt;`_.
 - New Features:
  - :py:meth:`DataArray.sel` and :py:meth:`Dataset.sel` now support :py:class:`pandas.CategoricalIndex`. (:issue:`3669`)
    By `Keisuke Fujii &lt;https://github.com/fujiisoup&gt;`_.
  - Support using an existing, opened h5netcdf ``File`` with
    :py:class:`~xarray.backends.H5NetCDFStore`. This permits creating an
    :py:class:`~xarray.Dataset` from a h5netcdf ``File`` that has been opened
    using other means (:issue:`3618`).
    By `Kai Mühlbauer &lt;https://github.com/kmuehlbauer&gt;`_.
  - Implement ``median`` and ``nanmedian`` for dask arrays. This works by rechunking
    to a single chunk along all reduction axes. (:issue:`2999`).
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_.
  - :py:func:`~xarray.concat` now preserves attributes from the first Variable.
    (:issue:`2575`, :issue:`2060`, :issue:`1614`)
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.quantile`, :py:meth:`DataArray.quantile` and ``GroupBy.quantile``
    now work with dask Variables.
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_.
  - Added the ``count`` reduction method to both :py:class:`~core.rolling.DatasetCoarsen`
    and :py:class:`~core.rolling.DataArrayCoarsen` objects. (:pull:`3500`)
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_
  - Add ``meta`` kwarg to :py:func:`~xarray.apply_ufunc`;
    this is passed on to :py:func:`dask.array.blockwise`. (:pull:`3660`)
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_.
  - Add ``attrs_file`` option in :py:func:`~xarray.open_mfdataset` to choose the
    source file for global attributes in a multi-file dataset (:issue:`2382`,
    :pull:`3498`). By `Julien Seguinot &lt;https://github.com/juseg&gt;`_.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.swap_dims` and :py:meth:`DataArray.swap_dims`
    now allow swapping to dimension names that don't exist yet. (:pull:`3636`)
    By `Justus Magin &lt;https://github.com/keewis&gt;`_.
  - Extend :py:class:`~core.accessor_dt.DatetimeAccessor` properties
    and support ``.dt`` accessor for timedeltas
    via :py:class:`~core.accessor_dt.TimedeltaAccessor` (:pull:`3612`)
    By `Anderson Banihirwe &lt;https://github.com/andersy005&gt;`_.
  - Improvements to interpolating along time axes (:issue:`3641`, :pull:`3631`).
    By `David Huard &lt;https://github.com/huard&gt;`_.
    - Support :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` in :py:meth:`DataArray.interpolate_na`
    - define 1970-01-01 as the default offset for the interpolation index for both
      :py:class:`pandas.DatetimeIndex` and :py:class:`CFTimeIndex`,
    - use microseconds in the conversion from timedelta objects to floats to avoid
      overflow errors.
 - Bug fixes:
  - Applying a user-defined function that adds new dimensions using :py:func:`apply_ufunc`
    and ``vectorize=True`` now works with ``dask &gt; 2.0``. (:issue:`3574`, :pull:`3660`).
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_.
  - Fix :py:meth:`~xarray.combine_by_coords` to allow for combining incomplete
    hypercubes of Datasets (:issue:`3648`).  By `Ian Bolliger
    &lt;https://github.com/bolliger32&gt;`_.
  - Fix :py:func:`~xarray.combine_by_coords` when combining cftime coordinates
    which span long time intervals (:issue:`3535`).  By `Spencer Clark
    &lt;https://github.com/spencerkclark&gt;`_.
  - Fix plotting with transposed 2D non-dimensional coordinates. (:issue:`3138`, :pull:`3441`)
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_.
  - :py:meth:`plot.FacetGrid.set_titles` can now replace existing row titles of a
    :py:class:`~xarray.plot.FacetGrid` plot. In addition :py:class:`~xarray.plot.FacetGrid` gained
    two new attributes: :py:attr:`~xarray.plot.FacetGrid.col_labels` and
    :py:attr:`~xarray.plot.FacetGrid.row_labels` contain :py:class:`matplotlib.text.Text` handles for both column and
    row labels. These can be used to manually change the labels.
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_.
  - Fix issue with Dask-backed datasets raising a ``KeyError`` on some computations involving :py:func:`map_blocks` (:pull:`3598`).
    By `Tom Augspurger &lt;https://github.com/TomAugspurger&gt;`_.
  - Ensure :py:meth:`Dataset.quantile`, :py:meth:`DataArray.quantile` issue the correct error
    when ``q`` is out of bounds (:issue:`3634`) by `Mathias Hauser &lt;https://github.com/mathause&gt;`_.
  - Fix regression in xarray 0.14.1 that prevented encoding times with certain
    ``dtype``, ``_FillValue``, and ``missing_value`` encodings (:issue:`3624`).
    By `Spencer Clark &lt;https://github.com/spencerkclark&gt;`_
  - Raise an error when trying to use :py:meth:`Dataset.rename_dims` to
    rename to an existing name (:issue:`3438`, :pull:`3645`)
    By `Justus Magin &lt;https://github.com/keewis&gt;`_.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.rename`, :py:meth:`DataArray.rename` now check for conflicts with
    MultiIndex level names.
  - :py:meth:`Dataset.merge` no longer fails when passed a :py:class:`DataArray` instead of a :py:class:`Dataset`.
    By `Tom Nicholas &lt;https://github.com/TomNicholas&gt;`_.
  - Fix a regression in :py:meth:`Dataset.drop`: allow passing any
    iterable when dropping variables (:issue:`3552`, :pull:`3693`)
    By `Justus Magin &lt;https://github.com/keewis&gt;`_.
  - Fixed errors emitted by ``mypy --strict`` in modules that import xarray.
    (:issue:`3695`) by `Guido Imperiale &lt;https://github.com/crusaderky&gt;`_.
  - Allow plotting of binned coordinates on the y axis in :py:meth:`plot.line`
    and :py:meth:`plot.step` plots (:issue:`3571`,
    :pull:`3685`) by `Julien Seguinot &lt;https://github.com/juseg&gt;`_.
 - Documentation:
  - Switch doc examples to use `nbsphinx &lt;https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ and replace
    ``sphinx_gallery`` scripts with Jupyter notebooks. (:pull:`3105`, :pull:`3106`, :pull:`3121`)
    By `Ryan Abernathey &lt;https://github.com/rabernat&gt;`_.
  - Added :doc:`example notebook &lt;examples/ROMS_ocean_model&gt;` demonstrating use of xarray with
    Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) ocean hydrodynamic model output. (:pull:`3116`)
    By `Robert Hetland &lt;https://github.com/hetland&gt;`_.
  - Added :doc:`example notebook &lt;examples/ERA5-GRIB-example&gt;` demonstrating the visualization of
    ERA5 GRIB data. (:pull:`3199`)
    By `Zach Bruick &lt;https://github.com/zbruick&gt;`_ and
    `Stephan Siemen &lt;https://github.com/StephanSiemen&gt;`_.

    ``GroupBy.quantile``. (:pull:`3576`)
    By `Justus Magin &lt;https://github.com/keewis&gt;`_.
  - Add new :doc:`example notebook &lt;examples/apply_ufunc_vectorize_1d&gt;` example notebook demonstrating
    vectorization of a 1D function using :py:func:`apply_ufunc` , dask and numba.
    By `Deepak Cherian &lt;https://github.com/dcherian&gt;`_.
  - Added example for :py:func:`~xarray.map_blocks`. (:pull:`3667`)
    By `Riley X. Brady &lt;https://github.com/bradyrx&gt;`_.
 - Internal Changes:
  - Make sure dask names change when rechunking by different chunk sizes. Conversely, make sure they
    stay the same when rechunking by the same chunk size. (:issue:`3350`)

    slice, list of int, scalar ndarray, or 1-dimensional ndarray.
