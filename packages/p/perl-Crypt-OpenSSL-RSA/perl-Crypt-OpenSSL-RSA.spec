%description
'Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA' provides the ability to RSA encrypt strings which are
somewhat shorter than the block size of a key. It also allows for
decryption, signatures and signature verification.

_NOTE_: Many of the methods in this package can croak, so use 'eval', or
Error.pm's try/catch mechanism to capture errors. Also, while some methods
from earlier versions of this package return true on success, this (never
documented) behavior is no longer the case.
