Sun Mar 20 02:36:44 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 4.2.3:
  - Added support for Python 3.2.
  - Added hook for datetime module which implicitly imports the time module.
  - Fixed hook for tkinter in Python 3.x.
  - Always include the zlib module since the zipimport module requires
    it, even when compression is not taking place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 27 01:11:08 UTC 2010 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

  - Added support for namespace packages which are loaded implicitly upon
    startup by injection into sys.modules.
  - Added support for a Zope sample which makes use of namespace packages.
  - Use the Microsoft compiler on Windows for Python 2.6 and up as some
    strange behaviors were identified with Python 2.7 when compiled using
    mingw32.
  - Eliminate warning about -mwindows when using the Microsoft compiler for
    building the Win32GUI base executable.
  - Added support for creating version resources on Windows.
  - Ensure that modules that are not truly required for bootstrapping are not
    included in the frozen modules compiled in to the executable; otherwise,
  * cannot be found at
    runtime. This problem only seems to be present in Python 2.7.1 but it is a
    good improvement for earlier releases of Python as well.
  - Added support for setting the description for Windows services.
  - Added hook for using the widget plugins which are part of the PyQt4.uic
    package.
  - Added additional hooks to remove spurious errors about missing modules
    and to force inclusion of implicitly imported modules (twitter module
  *.
  - Fixed support for installing frozen executables under Python 3.x on
    Windows.
  - Removed optional import of setuptools which is not a complete drop-in
    replacement for distutils and if found, replaces distutils with itself,
    resulting in some distutils features not being available; for those who
    require or prefer the use of setuptools, import it in your setup.py.
