- Update to 4.3.2:
  * note: This version supports Python 2.4 and above. If you need Python
    2.3 support, please use cx_Freeze 4.2.3.
  * Added support for Python 3.4.
  * Added hooks for PyQt4, PyQt5 and PySide to handle their plugins.
  * Added support for creating a shortcut/alias to the Applications
    directory within distributed DMG files for OS X.
  * Improve missing modules output.
  * Avoid polluting the extension module namespace when using the bootstrap
    module to load the extension.
  * Added support for using setuptools and pip if such tools are available.
  * Added first tests; nose and mock are required to run them.
  * Remove --bundle-iconfile in favor of --iconfile as a more generic
    method of including the icon for bdist_mac.
  * Documentation improved and FAQ added.
  * Converted samples to follow PEP 8.
- Bugs fixed:
  * cxfreeze-quickstart failed if the default base was not used
  * scripts frozen with Python 3 fail with an ImportError trying to import
    the re module
  * fix bug where after a first attempt to find a module failed, the second
    attempt would erroneously succeed
  * stop attempting to load a module by a name that is not a valid Python
    identifier
- Update to 4.3.1:
  * note: This version supports Python 2.4 and above. If you need Python
    2.3 support, please use cx_Freeze 4.2.3.
  * Added support for the final release of Python 3.3.
  * Added support for copying the MSVC runtime DLLs and manifest if desired
    by using the --include-msvcr switch. Thanks to Almar Klein for the
    initial patch.
  * Clarified the documentation on the --replace-paths option. Thanks to
    Thomas Kluyver for the patch.
- Bugs fixed:
  * Producing a Mac distribution failed with a variable reference.
  * Freezing a script using PyQt on a Mac failed with a type error.
  * Version number reported was incorrect.
  * Correct paths during installation on Windows.
- Update to 4.3:
  * note: This version supports Python 2.4 and above. If you need Python
    2.3 support, please use cx_Freeze 4.2.3.
  * Added options to build Mac OS X application bundles and DMG packages
    using ``bdist_mac`` and ``bdist_dmg`` distutils commands. Written by
    Rob Reilink.
  * The documentation is now using Sphinx, and is `available on
    ReadTheDocs.org
    <http://cx_freeze.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
  * Added support for Python 3.3 which uses a different compiled file
    format than earlier versions of Python.
  * Added support for Windows services which start automatically and which
    are capable of monitoring changes in sessions such as lock and unlock.
  * New ``cxfreeze-quickstart`` wizard to create a basic ``setup.py`` file.
   Initially written by Thomas Kluyver.
  * Included files under their original name can now be passed to
   ``include_files`` as a tuple with an empty second element. Written by
   r_haritonov.
  * File inclusions/exclusions can now be specified using a full path, or a
   shared library name with a version number suffix.
- Bugs fixed:
  * Messagebox display of certain errors in Windows GUI applications with
    Python 3.
  * Running Windows GUI applications in a path containing non-ASCII
    characters.
  * Calculate the correct filename for the Python shared library in Python
    3.2.
  * Including a package would not include the packages within that package,
    only the modules within that package.

- Update to 4.2.3:
  - Added support for Python 3.2.
  - Added hook for datetime module which implicitly imports the time module.
  - Fixed hook for tkinter in Python 3.x.
  - Always include the zlib module since the zipimport module requires
    it, even when compression is not taking place.
  - Added sample for a tkinter application.
- Regenerated spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 27 01:11:08 UTC 2010 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 4.2.2:
  - Added support for namespace packages which are loaded implicitly upon
    startup by injection into sys.modules.
  - Added support for a Zope sample which makes use of namespace packages.
  - Use the Microsoft compiler on Windows for Python 2.6 and up as some
    strange behaviors were identified with Python 2.7 when compiled using
    mingw32.
  - Eliminate warning about -mwindows when using the Microsoft compiler for
    building the Win32GUI base executable.
  - Added support for creating version resources on Windows.
  - Ensure that modules that are not truly required for bootstrapping are not
    included in the frozen modules compiled in to the executable; otherwise,
  * cannot be found at
    runtime. This problem only seems to be present in Python 2.7.1 but it is a
    good improvement for earlier releases of Python as well.
  - Added support for setting the description for Windows services.
  - Added hook for using the widget plugins which are part of the PyQt4.uic
    package.
  - Added additional hooks to remove spurious errors about missing modules
    and to force inclusion of implicitly imported modules (twitter module
  *.
  - Fixed support for installing frozen executables under Python 3.x on
    Windows.
  - Removed optional import of setuptools which is not a complete drop-in
    replacement for distutils and if found, replaces distutils with itself,
    resulting in some distutils features not being available; for those who
    require or prefer the use of setuptools, import it in your setup.py.
