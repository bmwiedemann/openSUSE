%description
CX_Freeze is a set of scripts and modules for turning Python scripts
into executables in much the same way that py2exe and py2app do.

It works by bundling Python executables and libraries from the local
Python installation. As such, the distribution produced by CX_Freeze
shares the very same dependencies. System libraries are not bundled
however, so additional dependencies may need to be manually installed
before being able to run "cx-frozen" executables that were created by
other systems.
