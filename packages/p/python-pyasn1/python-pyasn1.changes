Sun Nov 26 21:22:26 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.4.2:
  * Fixed explicit tag splitting in chunked encoding mode at
    OctetString and BitString encoders

- changes from version 0.4.1:
  * ANY DEFINED BY clause support implemented
  * Encoders refactored to take either a value (as ASN.1 object) or a
    Python value plus ASN.1 schema
  * BitString decoder optimised for better performance when running on
    constructed encoding
  * Constructed types' .getComponentBy*() methods accept the `default`
    parameter to return instead if schema object is to be returned
  * Constructed types' .getComponentBy*() methods accept the
    `instantiate` parameter to disable automatic inner component
    instantiation
  * The ASN.1 types' `__repr__` implementation reworked for better
    readability at the cost of not being `eval`-compliant
  * Most ASN.1 types' `__str__` magic methods (except for OctetString
    and character types) reworked to call `.prettyPrint()` rather than
    `.prettyPrint` calling `__str__` as it was before. The intention
    is to eventually deprecate `.prettyPrint()` in favor of `str()`.
    The other related change is that `str()` of enumerations and
    boolean types will return string label instead of number.
  * Fixed Choice.clear() to fully reset internal state of the object
  * Sphinx documentation rearranged, simplified and reworded
  * The `isValue` singleton is now the only way to indicate ASN.1
    schema as opposed to ASN.1 schema instance. The legacy `None`
    initializer support has been removed.
  * Changed `Null` object initialization behaviour: previous default
    value (`''`) is not set anymore. Thus `Null()` call produces a
    ASN.1 schema object, while `Null('')` - value object.
  * Migrated all docs and references from SourceForge
  * Imports PEP8'ed
  * Fixed ASN.1 encoder not to omit empty substrate produced for inner
    component if the inner component belongs to the simple class (as
    opposed to constructed class)
  * Fixed CER/DER encoders to respect tagged CHOICE when ordering SET
    components
  * Fixed ASN.1 types not to interfere with the Pickle protocol
  * Fixed Sequence/SequenceOf types decoding heuristics in schema-less
    decoding mode

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    and Sequence protocols in part
  * Fixed crash in ASN.1 encoder when encoding an explicitly tagged
    component of a Sequence

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 29 21:01:20 UTC 2017 - michael@stroeder.com

- updated to upstream release 0.3.1
- do not ship doc/source/

Revision 0.3.1, released 26-07-2017
-----------------------------------

- ASN.1 types __init__(), .clone() and .subtype() signatures
  refactored into keyword arguments to simplify their signatures.
- ASN.1 types initialization refactored to minimize the use of
  relatively expensive isNoValue() call
- Lazily pre-populate list of values of Sequence/Set/Choice types
- NamedTypes comparison made more efficient
- More efficient constraints computation and code clean up
- The __getitem__() implementation of some ASN.1 types & tag object
  refactored for better performance
- BER/CER/DER value encoders refactored to produce either tuple of
  bytes or octet-stream depending on what is more optimal
- Reduced the frequency of expensive isinstance() calls
- Tag-related classes optimized, refactored into properties and
  documented.
- The NamedValues implementation refactored to mimic Python dict, its use
  in ASN.1 types refactored into properties and better documented.
  WARNING: this change introduces a deviation from original API.
- NamedType family of classes overhauled, optimized and documented.
- The `componentType` attribute of constructed ASN.1 types turned
  read-only on instances.
- Sequence/Set DER/CER/DER decoder optimized to skip the case of
  reordered components handling when not necessary.
- Tags and constraints-related getter methods refactored into read-only
  instance attributes.
- The .hasValue() method refactored into .isValue property. All ASN.1
  objects now support them, not just scalars.
- The Real.{isInfinity, isPlusInfinity, isMinusInfinity} methods
  refactored into properties and renamed into IsInf, IsPlusInf and isMinusInf
- The end-of-octets type refactored to ensure it is a singleton. Codecs
  changed to rely on that for better performance.
- Codecs lookup made more efficient at BER/CER/DER decoder main loop by
  assigning `typeId` to every ASN.1 type, not just ambiguous ones.
- The .getComponent*() methods of constructed ASN.1 types changed
  to lazily instantiate underlying type rather than return `None`.
  This should simplify its API as initialization like `X[0][1] = 2` becomes
  possible.
  WARNING: this change introduces a deviation from the original API.
- The .setComponent*() methods of SetOf/SequenceOf types changed not
  to allow uninitialized "holes" inside the sequences of their components.
  They now behave similarly to Python lists.
  WARNING: this change introduces a deviation from the original API.
- Default and optional components en/decoding of Constructed type
  refactored towards better efficiency and more control.
- OctetsString and Any decoder optimized to avoid creating ASN.1
  objects for chunks of substrate. Instead they now join substrate
  chunks together and create ASN.1 object from it just once.
- The GeneralizedTime and UTCTime types now support to/from Python
  datetime object conversion.
- Unit tests added for the `compat` sub-package.
- Fixed BitString named bits initialization bug.
- Fixed non-functional tag cache (when running Python 2) at DER decoder.
- Fixed chunked encoding restriction on DER encoder.
- Fixed SET components ordering at DER encoder.
- Fixed BIT STRING & OCTET STRING encoding to be always non-chunked (e.g.
  primitive) at DER encoder
- Fixed `compat.integer.from_bytes()` behaviour on empty input.

Mon Mar  6 13:28:21 UTC 2017 - michael@stroeder.com

- updated to upstream release 0.2.3

Revision 0.2.3, released 25-02-2017
-----------------------------------

- Improved SEQUENCE/SET/CHOICE decoding performance by maintaining a single shared
  NamedType object for all instances of SEQUENCE/SET object.
- Improved INTEGER encoding/decoding by switching to Python's built-in
  integer serialization functions.
- Improved BitString performance by rebasing it onto Python int type and leveraging
  fast Integer serialization functions.
- BitString type usability improved in many ways: for example bitshifting and
  numeric operation on BitString is now possible.
- Minor ObjectIdentifier type performance optimization.
- ASN.1 character types refactored to keep unicode contents internally
  (rather than serialized octet stream) and duck-type it directly.
- ASN.1 OctetString initialized from a Python object performs bytes()
  on it when running on Python 3 (used to do str() which is probably
  less logical).
- Missing support for NoValue.__sizeof__ added.
- Added checks to make sure SEQUENCE/SET components being assigned
  match the prototypes.
- Setter methods for constructed types consistently accept matchTags
  and matchConstraints flags to control the strictness of inner
  components compatibility verification. Previously, these checks
  were tied to verifyConstraints flag, now they are all independent.
- General documentation improvements here and there.
- Fix to __reversed__() magic to make it returning an iterator.
- Test suite simplified and unified.
- The __all__ variable added to most of the Python modules.
- The "test" directory renamed into "tests" not to collide with
  the "test" module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 07:35:04 UTC 2017 - michael@stroeder.com

- updated to upstream release 0.2.2 with security fixes
- updated project and source URLs and list of doc files

Revision 0.2.2, released 07-02-2017
-----------------------------------

- FIX TO A SECURITY WEAKNESS: define length only decoders could have successfully
  processed indefinite length serialization.
- FIX TO A SECURITY WEAKNESS: canonical decoders (CER/DER) may have successfully
  consumed non-canonical variations of (otherwise valid) serialization.
- Broken Enumerated subtyping fixed.

Revision 0.2.1, released 05-02-2017
-----------------------------------

- FIX TO A SECURITY WEAKNESS: BER decoder improperly cached long tags.
- New "native" codec implemented to transform pyasn1 types to Python built-in types and back.
- Switched to new-style classes.
- Sphinx documentation added.
- BitString improvements:

  * simple string of binary digits is now supported as initializer
  * default str() yields string of binary digits (used to yield str(tuple())
  * binValue and hexValue initializers added
  * .asNumbers(), .asOctets() and asInteger() representation added

- Components of constructed ASN.1 types can now be populated with
  uninitialized ASN.1 objects by assigning either noValue sentinel or
  setupComponent() function return in addition to now-legacy None sentinel.
  This should improve code readability.
- NoValue class improved to become a singleton and catch more kinds
  of access to it.
- Compatibility wrappers str2octs() and oct2strs() fixed to run over
  iso-8859-1 encoding.
- Integer changed to emit Real instance if division produces a float.
- True division operation now supported by Integer type.
- The __contains__(), __reverse__() methods implemented for container types
- Iterator protocol support implemented for all container types.
  Warning, warning, warning: this change may potentially affect backward
  compatibility when:

  * user class overrides __getitem__() without overriding __iter__()
  * when user code iterates over SEQUENCE object to get its components (now keys will be yielded)

- Almost complete Python list and dict protocols added to SequenceOf/SetOf and
  Sequence/Set respectively
- Fix to divmod operation implementation in Integer type.
- Fix to IntegerDecoder's precomputed value map on Python 3.
- Fix to base ASN.1 types to run in "unicode_literals" mode.
- Fix to composite constraints "+" operands ordering (AbstractConstraintSet.__radd__)
- Fix to constraints merge in .subtype() -- on merge existing constraints are
  expanded to accommodate new constraints, not the other way round. When existing
  constraints are wrapped in ConstraintsIntersection composite, additional
  constraints being added on subtyping effectively further narrow the set of
  allowed values, which aligns well with the notion of subtyping.
- Fix to NamedTypes methods to handle .getTagMap() returning None
- Fix to Set/Sequence.setDefaultComponents() to return self
- Copyright notice added to non-trivial source code files.
- Author's email changed, copyright extended to 2017

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  6 11:18:26 UTC 2015 - hpj@urpla.net

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  4 20:42:15 UTC 2015 - michael@stroeder.com

  - ObjectIdentifier codec fixed to work properly with arc 0 and arc 2 values.
  - Explicit limit on ObjectIdentifier arc value size removed.
  - Unicode initializer support added to OctetString type and derivatives.
  - New prettyPrintType() abstract method implemented to base pyasn1 types
    to facilitate encoding errors analisys.
  - The __str__() method implemented to Tag, TagSet and TagMap classes to
    ease encoding errors troubleshooting.
    easing encoding errors
  - Fix to SEQUENCE and SET types to give them their private componentTypes
    collection (which is a NamedTypes object) so that they won't collide in
    a MT execution environment.
  - Missing T61String,ISO646String character types and ObjectDescriptor useful
    type added.
  - Distribute is gone, switched to setuptools completely.
  - Missing NamedValues.__repr__() added.
  - The base.NoValue() class, that indicates uninitialized ASN.1 object,
    made public.
  - The base.NoValue() class instances now support __repr__() what makes
    possible to perform repr() on uninitialized pyasn1 types objects.
  - When comparing ASN.1 types, by-tag and/or by-constraints matching
    can now be performed with the isSuperTypeOf()/isSameTypeWith() optional
    flags.
  - Constructed types now verify their consistency by invoking 
    isSameTypeWith(matchTags=True, matchConstraints=False) and
    isSuperTypeOf(matchTags=False, matchConstraints=True) for each of their
    components rather than isSuperTypeOf() as it used to be. Constriants check 
    could be enforced to isSameTypeWith() with the strictConstraints=True
    constructed classes attribute.
  - Constructed types can now be initialized with new .setComponents() method
    which accepts both var-args and keyword-args. Default repr() modified to
    reflect this change.
  - NamedTypes() and NamedValues() made comparable.
  - Test coverage extended to cover pyasn1 types __repr__() function.
  - The abs(Integer()) & abs(Real()) operation now returns respective pyasn1 
    type, not a Python type.
  - More Python magic methods implementations added to Integer & Real classes
    (e.g.  __pos__, __neg__, __round__, __floor__, __ceil__, __trunc__)
  - The Integer.__invert__ Python magic method implemented.
  - The OctetString.__int__() and .__float__() magic methods implemented.
  - Handle the case of null writer at Debug printer.
  - BitString encoder/decoder performance improved.
  - Built-in debugging is now based on Python logging module.
  - Fix to NamedType.__repr__() to work properly.
  - Fixes to __repr__() implementation of many built-in ASN.1 types to take into
    account all of their initializers such as tagSet, subtypeSpec etc.
  - String typed float initializer to REAL type now supported.
  - Float typed mantissa initializer to REAL type for base 2 added.
  - Encoding bases 8 and 16 support for REAL type binary encoder added.
  - More strict CER/DER encoders added for GeneralizedTime and UTCTime types.
  - Asn1Item.hasValue() added to easily distinguish initalized ASN.1 objects
    from uninitialized ones (e.g. pure types).
  - Fix to REAL type binary decoder to handle different bases and scale factor.
  - Fix to TagSet.repr() to include [obsolete] baseTag information.
  - Fix to broken REAL type decoding handling.
  - Fix to BitString and OctetString decoders dealing with constructed
    encoding -- it used to be possible to embed other types in substrate.
  - Fix to end-of-octest sentinel handling:
    * require strict two-zeros sentinel encoding
    * recognize EOO sentinel only when explicitly requested by caller
      of the decoder via allowEoo=True parameter (warning: API change)
  - DER codec hardened not to tolerate indefinite length encoding/decoding.

    (http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
  - Test suite made discoverable by unittest/unittest2 discovery feature.
  - Fix to decoder working on indefinite length substrate -- end-of-octets
    marker is now detected by both tag and value. Otherwise zero values may
    interfere with end-of-octets marker.
  - Fix to decoder to fail in cases where tagFormat indicates inappropriate
    format for the type (e.g. BOOLEAN is always PRIMITIVE, SET is always 
    CONSTRUCTED and OCTET STRING is either of the two)
  - Fix to REAL type encoder to force primitive encoding form encoding.
  - Fix to CHOICE decoder to handle explicitly tagged, indefinite length
    mode encoding
  - Fix to REAL type decoder to handle negative REAL values correctly. Test
    case added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 18 09:19:52 UTC 2013 - michael@stroeder.com

- updated to upstrean release 0.1.6
  - The compact (valueless) way of encoding zero INTEGERs introduced in
    0.1.5 seems to fail miserably as the world is filled with broken
    BER decoders. So we had to back off the *encoder* for a while.
    There's still the IntegerEncoder.supportCompactZero flag which
    enables compact encoding form whenever it evaluates to True.
  - Report package version on debugging code initialization.
- Changes from version 0.1.5:
  - Documentation updated and split into chapters to better match
    web-site contents.
  - Make prettyPrint() working for non-initialized pyasn1 data objects. It
    used to throw an exception.
