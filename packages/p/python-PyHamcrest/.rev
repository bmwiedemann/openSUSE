    <comment>- Restrict pytest to 3.x as the newer does not work with release.
  In upstream git this was fixed by quite few commits so lets
  just wait for the release</comment>

    <comment>- Remove pytest4.patch and replace it with pytest4-02.patch,
  which is the upstream gh#hamcrest/PyHamcrest#124 fixing
  compatibility with pytest 4+ officially. And of course, we
  don't have to massacre test files anymore.

- Run spec-cleaner
- Add pytest4.patch to make the testsuite actually really pass.

- Because of gh#hamcrest/PyHamcrest#123 we have to remove 
  tests/hamcrest_unit_test/core/is{_test,instanceof_test}.py to
  make the test suite passing.
  Patch pytest4.patch has been removed, it was a step into dead
  end.</comment>
