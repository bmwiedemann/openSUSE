- Remove pytest4.patch and replace it with pytest4-02.patch,
  which is the upstream gh#hamcrest/PyHamcrest#124 fixing
  compatibility with pytest 4+ officially. And of course, we
  don't have to massacre test files anymore.

- Run spec-cleaner
- Add pytest4.patch to make the testsuite actually really pass.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  4 14:35:43 UTC 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Because of gh#hamcrest/PyHamcrest#123 we have to remove 
  tests/hamcrest_unit_test/core/is{_test,instanceof_test}.py to
  make the test suite passing.
  Patch pytest4.patch has been removed, it was a step into dead
  end.

  just wait for the release
