  <title>Extract distribution name and version from a distribution filename</title>
  <description>Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to associate
multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from the filename of the
upload. For most distributions this is easy as they have used
ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the distribution, which
results in a uniform name. But sadly not all uploads are created in this
way.

'CPAN::DistnameInfo' uses heuristics that have been learnt by the
http://search.cpan.org/ manpage to extract the distribution name and
version from filenames and also report if the version is to be treated as a
developer release

The constructor takes a single pathname, returning an object with the
following methods

* cpanid

  If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then this
  will be the the CPAN id of the author.

* dist

  The name of the distribution

* distvname

  The file name with any suffix and leading directory names removed

* filename

  If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then this
  will be the path to the file relative to the detected CPAN author
  directory. Otherwise it is the path that was passed in.

* maturity

  The maturity of the distribution. This will be either 'released' or
  'developer'

* extension

  The extension of the distribution, often used to denote the archive type
  (e.g. 'tar.gz')

* pathname

  The pathname that was passed to the constructor when creating the object.

* properties

  This will return a list of key-value pairs, suitable for assigning to a
  hash, for the known properties.

* version

  The extracted version</description>
