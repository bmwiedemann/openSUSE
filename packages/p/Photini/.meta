  <description>A free, easy to use, digital photograph metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP) editing application.

&quot;Metadata&quot; is said to mean &quot;data about data&quot;. In the context of digital photographs this means information that isn't essential in order to display the image, but tells you something about it. For example a title and description of the scene or the date &amp; time and the GPS coordinates of the camera's position when the picture was taken.
