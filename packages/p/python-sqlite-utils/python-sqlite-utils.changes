Fri Dec  8 13:46:46 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.35.2:
  * The ``--load-extension=spatialite`` option and
    :ref:`find_spatialite() <python_api_gis_find_spatialite>`
    utility function now both work correctly on ``arm64`` Linux.
  * Fix for bug where ``sqlite-utils insert`` could cause your
    terminal cursor to disappear. Thanks, `Luke Plant
  * ``datetime.timedelta`` values are now stored as ``TEXT``
    columns. Thanks, `Harald Nezbeda
  * Test suite is now also run against Python 3.12.
  * Fixed a bug where :ref:`table.transform()
    <python_api_transform>` would sometimes re-assign the
    ``rowid`` values for a table rather than keeping them
    consistent across the operation. (:issue:`592`)
  * Adding foreign keys to a table no longer uses ``PRAGMA
    writable_schema = 1`` to directly manipulate the
    ``sqlite_master`` table. This was resulting in errors in some
    Python installations where the SQLite library was compiled in
    a way that prevented this from working, in particular on
    macOS. Foreign keys are now added using the :ref:`table
    transformation <python_api_transform>` mechanism instead.
  * This new mechanism creates a full copy of the table, so it is
    likely to be significantly slower for large tables, but will
    no longer trigger ``table sqlite_master may not be modified``
    errors on platforms that do not support ``PRAGMA
    writable_schema = 1``.
  * A new plugin, `sqlite-utils-fast-fks
    <https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils-fast-fks>`__, is now
    available for developers who still want to use that faster
    but riskier implementation.
  * The :ref:`table.transform() method <python_api_transform>`
    has two new parameters: ``foreign_keys=`` allows you to
    replace the foreign key constraints defined on a table, and
    ``add_foreign_keys=`` lets you specify new foreign keys to
    add. These complement the existing ``drop_foreign_keys=``
    parameter. (:issue:`577`)
  * The :ref:`sqlite-utils transform <cli_transform_table>`
    command has a new ``--add-foreign-key`` option which can be
    called multiple times to add foreign keys to a table that is
    being transformed. (:issue:`585`)
  * :ref:`sqlite-utils convert <cli_convert>` now has a ``--pdb``
    option for opening a debugger on the first encountered error
    in your conversion script. (:issue:`581`)
  * Fixed a bug where ``sqlite-utils install -e '.[test]'``
    option did not work correctly.
  * Plugin hook: :ref:`plugins_hooks_register_commands`, for
    plugins to add extra commands to ``sqlite-utils``.
  * Plugin hook: :ref:`plugins_hooks_prepare_connection`. Plugins
    can use this to help prepare the SQLite connection to do
    things like registering custom SQL functions.
  * ``sqlite_utils.Database(..., execute_plugins=False)`` option
    for disabling plugin execution.
  * ``sqlite-utils install -e path-to-directory`` option for
    installing editable code.
  * ``table.create(...)`` method now accepts ``replace=True`` to
    drop and replace an existing table with the same name, or
    ``ignore=True`` to silently do nothing if a table already
    exists with the same name. (:issue:`568`)
  * ``sqlite-utils insert ... --stop-after 10`` option for
    stopping the insert after a specified number of records.
    Works for the ``upsert`` command as well. (:issue:`561`)
  * The ``--csv`` and ``--tsv`` modes for ``insert`` now accept a
    ``--empty-null`` option, which causes empty strings in the
    CSV file to be stored as ``null`` in the database.
  * New ``db.rename_table(table_name, new_name)`` method for
    renaming tables. (:issue:`565`)
  * ``sqlite-utils rename-table my.db table_name new_name``
    command for renaming tables. (:issue:`565`)
  * The ``table.transform(...)`` method now takes an optional
    ``keep_table=new_table_name`` parameter, which will cause the
    original table to be renamed to ``new_table_name`` rather
    than being dropped at the end of the transformation.
    (:issue:`571`)
  * Documentation now notes that calling ``table.transform()``
    without any arguments will reformat the SQL schema stored by
    SQLite to be more aesthetically pleasing. (:issue:`564`)
  * ``sqlite-utils`` will now use `sqlean.py
    <https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean.py>`__ in place of
    ``sqlite3`` if it is installed in the same virtual
    environment. This is useful for Python environments with
    either an outdated version of SQLite or with restrictions on
    SQLite such as disabled extension loading or restrictions
    resulting in the ``sqlite3.OperationalError: table
    sqlite_master may not be modified`` error. (:issue:`559`)
  * New ``with db.ensure_autocommit_off()`` context manager,
    which ensures that the database is in autocommit mode for the
    duration of a block of code. This is used by
    ``db.enable_wal()`` and ``db.disable_wal()`` to ensure they
    work correctly with ``pysqlite3`` and ``sqlean.py``.
  * New ``db.iterdump()`` method, providing an iterator over SQL
    strings representing a dump of the database. This uses
    ``sqlite-dump`` if it is available, otherwise falling back on
    the ``conn.iterdump()`` method from ``sqlite3``. Both
    ``pysqlite3`` and ``sqlean.py`` omit support for
    ``iterdump()`` - this method helps paper over that
    difference.
  * Examples in the :ref:`CLI documentation <cli>` can now all be
    copied and pasted without needing to remove a leading ``$``.
    (:issue:`551`)
  * Documentation now covers :ref:`installation_completion` for
    ``bash`` and ``zsh``. (:issue:`552`)
  * New experimental ``sqlite-utils tui`` interface for
    interactively building command-line invocations, powered by
    `Trogon <https://github.com/Textualize/trogon>`__. This
    requires an optional dependency, installed using ``sqlite-
    utils install trogon``. There is a screenshot :ref:`in the
    documentation <cli_tui>`. (:issue:`545`)
  * ``sqlite-utils analyze-tables`` command (:ref:`documentation
    <cli_analyze_tables>`) now has a ``--common-limit 20`` option
    for changing the number of common/least-common values shown
    for each column. (:issue:`544`)
  * ``sqlite-utils analyze-tables --no-most`` and ``--no-least``
    options for disabling calculation of most-common and least-
    common values.
  * If a column contains only ``null`` values, ``analyze-tables``
    will no longer attempt to calculate the most common and least
    common values for that column. (:issue:`547`)
  * Calling ``sqlite-utils analyze-tables`` with non-existent
    columns in the ``-c/--column`` option now results in an error
    message. (:issue:`548`)
  * The ``table.analyze_column()`` method (:ref:`documented here
    <python_api_analyze_column>`) now accepts
    ``most_common=False`` and ``least_common=False`` options for
    disabling calculation of those values.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6. Tests now ensure
    compatibility with Python 3.11. (:issue:`517`)
  * Automatically locates the SpatiaLite extension on Apple
    Silicon. Thanks, Chris Amico. (`#536
    <https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/pull/536>`__)
  * New ``--raw-lines`` option for the ``sqlite-utils query`` and
    ``sqlite-utils memory`` commands, which outputs just the raw
    value of the first column of every row. (:issue:`539`)
  * Fixed a bug where ``table.upsert_all()`` failed if the
    ``not_null=`` option was passed. (:issue:`538`)
  * Fixed a ``ResourceWarning`` when using ``sqlite-utils
    insert``. (:issue:`534`)
  * Now shows a more detailed error message when ``sqlite-utils
    insert`` is called with invalid JSON. (:issue:`532`)
  * ``table.convert(..., skip_false=False)`` and ``sqlite-utils
    convert --no-skip-false`` options, for avoiding a misfeature
    where the :ref:`convert()  <python_api_convert>` mechanism
    skips rows in the database with a falsey value for the
    specified column. Fixing this by default would be a
    backwards-incompatible change and is under consideration for
    a 4.0 release in the future. (:issue:`527`)
  * Tables can now be created with self-referential foreign keys.
    Thanks, Scott Perry. (`#537
    <https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/pull/537>`__)
  * ``sqlite-utils transform`` no longer breaks if a table
    defines default values for columns. Thanks, Kenny Song.
    (:issue:`509`)
  * Fixed a bug where repeated calls to ``table.transform()`` did
    not work correctly. Thanks, Martin Carpenter. (:issue:`525`)
  * Improved error message if ``rows_from_file()`` is passed a
    non-binary-mode file-like object. (:issue:`520`)
  * Now tested against Python 3.11. (:issue:`502`)
  * New ``table.search_sql(include_rank=True)`` option, which
    adds a ``rank`` column to the generated SQL. Thanks, Jacob
    Chapman. (`#480 <https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-
    utils/pull/480>`__)
  * Progress bars now display for newline-delimited JSON files
    using the ``--nl`` option. Thanks, Mischa Untaga.
    (:issue:`485`)
  * New ``db.close()`` method. (:issue:`504`)
  * Conversion functions passed to :ref:`table.convert(...)
    <python_api_convert>` can now return lists or dictionaries,
    which will be inserted into the database as JSON strings.
    (:issue:`495`)
  * ``sqlite-utils install`` and ``sqlite-utils uninstall``
    commands for installing packages into the same virtual
    environment as ``sqlite-utils``, :ref:`described here
    <cli_install>`. (:issue:`483`)
  * New :ref:`sqlite_utils.utils.flatten()
    <reference_utils_flatten>` utility function. (:issue:`500`)
  * Documentation on :ref:`using Just <contributing_just>` to run
    tests, linters and build documentation.
  * Documentation now covers the :ref:`release_process` for this
    package.
  * The ``sqlite-utils query``, ``memory`` and ``bulk`` commands
    now all accept a new ``--functions`` option. This can be
    passed a string of Python code, and any callable objects
    defined in that code will be made available to SQL queries as
    custom SQL functions. See :ref:`cli_query_functions` for
    details. (:issue:`471`)
  * ``db[table].create(...)`` method now accepts a new
    ``transform=True`` parameter. If the table already exists it
    will be :ref:`transformed <python_api_transform>` to match
    the schema configuration options passed to the function. This
    may result in columns being added or dropped, column types
    being changed, column order being updated or not null and
    default values for columns being set. (:issue:`467`)
  * Related to the above, the ``sqlite-utils create-table``
    command now accepts a ``--transform`` option.
  * New introspection property: ``table.default_values`` returns
    a dictionary mapping each column name with a default value to
    the configured default value. (:issue:`475`)
  * The ``--load-extension`` option can now be provided a path to
    a compiled SQLite extension module accompanied by the name of
    an entrypoint, separated by a colon - for example ``--load-
    extension ./lines0:sqlite3_lines0_noread_init``. This feature
    is modelled on code first `contributed to Datasette
    <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1789>`__ by Alex
    Garcia. (:issue:`470`)
  * Functions registered using the :ref:`db.register_function()
    <python_api_register_function>` method can now have a custom
    name specified using the new ``db.register_function(fn,
    name=...)`` parameter. (:issue:`458`)
  * :ref:`sqlite-utils rows <cli_rows>` has a new ``--order``
    option for specifying the sort order for the returned rows.
    (:issue:`469`)
  * All of the CLI options that accept Python code blocks can now
    all be used to define functions that can access modules
    imported in that same block of code without needing to use
    the ``global`` keyword. (:issue:`472`)
  * Fixed bug where ``table.extract()`` would not behave
    correctly for columns containing null values. Thanks, Forest
    Gregg. (:issue:`423`)
  * New tutorial: `Cleaning data with sqlite-utils and Datasette
    <https://datasette.io/tutorials/clean-data>`__ shows how to
    use ``sqlite-utils`` to import and clean an example CSV file.
  * Datasette and ``sqlite-utils`` now have a Discord community.
    `Join the Discord here <https://discord.gg/Ass7bCAMDw>`__.
  * New :ref:`table.duplicate(new_name) <python_api_duplicate>`
    method for creating a copy of a table with a matching schema
    and row contents. Thanks, `David
    <https://github.com/davidleejy>`__. (:issue:`449`)
  * New ``sqlite-utils duplicate data.db table_name new_name``
    CLI command for :ref:`cli_duplicate_table`. (:issue:`454`)
  * ``sqlite_utils.utils.rows_from_file()`` is now a
    :ref:`documented API <reference_utils_rows_from_file>`. It
    can be used to read a sequence of dictionaries from a file-
    like object containing CSV, TSV, JSON or newline-delimited
    JSON. It can be passed an explicit format or can attempt to
    detect the format automatically. (:issue:`443`)
  * ``sqlite_utils.utils.TypeTracker`` is now a documented API
    for detecting the likely column types for a sequence of
    string rows, see :ref:`python_api_typetracker`.
    (:issue:`445`)
  * ``sqlite_utils.utils.chunks()`` is now a documented API for
    :ref:`splitting an iterator into chunks
    <reference_utils_chunks>`. (:issue:`451`)
  * ``sqlite-utils enable-fts`` now has a ``--replace`` option
    for replacing the existing FTS configuration for a table.
    (:issue:`450`)
  * The ``create-index``, ``add-column`` and ``duplicate``
    commands all now take a ``--ignore`` option for ignoring
    errors should the database not be in the right state for them
    to operate. (:issue:`450`)
  * Code examples in documentation now have a "copy to clipboard"
    button. (:issue:`436`)
  * ``sqlite_utils.utils.utils.rows_from_file()`` is now a
    documented API, see :ref:`python_api_rows_from_file`.
    (:issue:`443`)
  * ``rows_from_file()`` has two new parameters to help handle
    CSV files with rows that contain more values than are listed
    in that CSV file's headings: ``ignore_extras=True`` and
    ``extras_key="name-of-key"``. (:issue:`440`)
  * ``sqlite_utils.utils.maximize_csv_field_size_limit()`` helper
    function for increasing the field size limit for reading CSV
    files to its maximum, see
    :ref:`python_api_maximize_csv_field_size_limit`.
    (:issue:`442`)
  * ``table.search(where=, where_args=)`` parameters for adding
    additional ``WHERE`` clauses to a search query. The
    ``where=`` parameter is available on
    ``table.search_sql(...)`` as well. See
    :ref:`python_api_fts_search`. (:issue:`441`)
  * Fixed bug where ``table.detect_fts()`` and other search-
    related functions could fail if two FTS-enabled tables had
    names that were prefixes of each other. (:issue:`434`)
  * Now depends on `click-default-group-wheel
    <https://github.com/simonw/click-default-group-wheel>`__, a
    pure Python wheel package. This means you can install and use
    this package with `Pyodide <https://pyodide.org/>`__, which
    can run Python entirely in your browser using WebAssembly.
    (`#429 <https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/pull/429>`__)
  * Try that out using the `Pyodide REPL
    <https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html>`__:
  * .. code-block:: python
  * >>> import micropip
  * >>> await micropip.install("sqlite-utils")
  * >>> import sqlite_utils
  * >>> db = sqlite_utils.Database(memory=True)
  * >>> list(db.query("select 3 * 5"))
  * [{'3 * 5': 15}]
  * New ``errors=r.IGNORE/r.SET_NULL`` parameter for the
    ``r.parsedatetime()`` and ``r.parsedate()`` :ref:`convert
    recipes <cli_convert_recipes>`. (:issue:`416`)
  * Fixed a bug where ``--multi`` could not be used in
    combination with ``--dry-run`` for the :ref:`convert
    <cli_convert>` command. (:issue:`415`)
  * New documentation: :ref:`cli_convert_complex`. (:issue:`420`)
  * More robust detection for whether or not
    ``deterministic=True`` is supported. (:issue:`425`)
  * Improved display of type information and parameters in the
    :ref:`API reference documentation <reference>`.
    (:issue:`413`)
  * New ``hash_id_columns=`` parameter for creating a primary key
    that's a hash of the content of specific columns - see
    :ref:`python_api_hash` for details. (:issue:`343`)
  * New :ref:`db.sqlite_version <python_api_sqlite_version>`
    property, returning a tuple of integers representing the
    version of SQLite, for example ``(3, 38, 0)``.
  * Fixed a bug where :ref:`register_function(deterministic=True)
    <python_api_register_function>` caused errors on versions of
    SQLite prior to 3.8.3. (:issue:`408`)
  * New documented :ref:`hash_record(record, keys=...)
    <reference_utils_hash_record>` function.

Wed Feb 16 20:38:17 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.24:
  * SpatiaLite helpers for the ``sqlite-utils`` command-line tool
  * All commands now include example usage in their ``--help`` - see :ref:`cli_reference`. (:issue:`384`)
  * Python library documentation has a new :ref:`python_api_getting_started` section. (:issue:`387`)
  * Documentation now uses `Plausible analytics <https://plausible.io/>`__. (:issue:`389`)
  * CLI and Python library improvements to help run `ANALYZE
    inserting rows, to gain better performance from the SQLite query planner
    when it runs against indexes.
  * Three new CLI commands: ``create-database``, ``analyze`` and ``bulk``.
  * More details and examples can be found in `the annotated release notes <https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jan/11/sqlite-utils/>`__.
  * Fixed bug where ``sqlite-utils upsert ... --detect-types`` ignored the ``--detect-types`` option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 14 07:51:51 UTC 2021 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 3.19
  * lot of changes, see changelog.rst in the package or
    https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/blob/main/docs/changelog.rst

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 08:32:36 UTC 2021 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 3.5.
  * ``sqlite-utils insert --sniff`` option for detecting the delimiter
    and quote character used by a CSV file
  * The ``table.rows_where()``, ``table.search()`` and
    ``table.search_sql()`` methods all now take optional ``offset=``
    and ``limit=`` arguments.
  * New ``--no-headers`` option for ``sqlite-utils insert --csv`` to
    handle CSV files that are missing the header row.
  * Fixed bug where inserting data with extra columns in subsequent
    chunks would throw an error.
  * Fixed bug importing CSV files with columns containing more than
    128KB of data.
  * Test suite now runs in CI against Ubuntu, macOS and Windows.
- Updates for 3.4.1
  * Fixed a code import bug that slipped in to 3.4.
- Updates for 3.4
  * ``sqlite-utils insert --csv`` now accepts optional
  ``--delimiter`` and ``--quotechar`` options.
- Updates for 3.3
  * The ``table.m2m()`` method now accepts an optional ``alter=True``
    argument to specify that any missing columns should be added to
    the referenced table.
- Updates for 3.2.1
  * Fixed a bug where ``.add_missing_columns()`` failed to take case
    insensitive column names into account.
- Updates for 3.2
  * This release introduces a new mechanism for speeding up
    ``count(*)`` queries using cached table counts, stored in a
    ``_counts`` table and updated by triggers. This mechanism is
    described in :ref:`python_api_cached_table_counts`, and can be
    enabled using Python API methods or the new ``enable-counts``
    CLI command.
  * ``table.enable_counts()`` method for enabling these triggers
    on a specific table.
  * ``db.enable_counts()`` method for enabling triggers on every
    table in the database.
  * New ``sqlite-utils enable-counts my.db`` command for enabling
    counts on all or specific tables, see :ref:`cli_enable_counts`.
  * New ``sqlite-utils triggers`` command for listing the triggers
    defined for a database or specific tables.
  * New ``db.use_counts_table`` property which, if ``True``, causes
    ``table.count`` to read from the ``_counts`` table.
  * ``table.has_counts_triggers`` property revealing if a table has
    been configured with the new ``_counts`` database triggers.
  * ``db.reset_counts()`` method and ``sqlite-utils reset-counts``
    command for resetting the values in the ``_counts`` table.
  * The previously undocumented ``db.escape()`` method has been
    renamed to ``db.quote()``.
  * New ``table.triggers_dict`` and ``db.triggers_dict``
    introspection properties.
  * ``sqlite-utils insert`` now shows a more useful error message
    for invalid JSON.
- Updates for 3.1.1
  * Fixed failing test caused by ``optimize`` sometimes creating
   larger database files.
  * Documentation now lives on https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/
  * README now includes ``brew install sqlite-utils`` installation method.
- Updates for 3.1
  * New command: ``sqlite-utils analyze-tables my.db`` outputs useful
   information about the table columns in the database, such as the
   number of distinct values and how many rows are null.
  * New ``table.analyze_column(column)`` Python method used by the
    ``analyze-tables`` command - see :ref:`python_api_analyze_column`.
  * The ``table.update()`` method now correctly handles values that
    should be stored as JSON.
- Updates for 3.0
  * This release introduces a new ``sqlite-utils search`` command
    for searching tables, see :ref:`cli_search`.
  * The ``table.search()`` method has been redesigned.
  * The release includes minor backwards-incompatible changes, hence
    the version bump to 3.0. Those changes, which should not affect
    most users, are:
  * The ``-c`` shortcut option for outputting CSV is no longer
    available. The full ``--csv`` option is required instead.
  * The ``-f`` shortcut for ``--fmt`` has also been removed - use
    ``--fmt``.
  * The ``table.search()`` method now defaults to sorting by
    relevance, not sorting by ``rowid``.
  * The ``table.search()`` method now returns a generator over a list
    of Python dictionaries. It previously returned a list of tuples.
  * The ``query``, ``tables``, ``rows`` and ``search`` CLI commands
    now accept a new ``--tsv`` option which outputs the results in TSV.
  * A new ``table.virtual_table_using`` property reveals if a table
    is a virtual table, and returns the upper case type of virtual
    table (e.g. ``FTS4`` or ``FTS5``) if it is. It returns ``None``
    if the table is not a virtual table.
  * The new ``table.search_sql()`` method returns the SQL for
    searching a table, see :ref:`python_api_fts_search_sql`.
  * ``sqlite-utils rows`` now accepts multiple optional ``-c``
    parameters specifying the columns to return.
  * The ``sqlite-utils search`` command now defaults to returning
    every result, unless you add a ``--limit 20`` option.
  * The ``sqlite-utils search -c`` and ``table.search(columns=[])``
    options are now fully respected.
- Skip python2 because python-sqlite-fts4 don't support it.
- Skip python36 because python-panda don't support it.
