  <title>Acme::Damn - 'Unbless' Perl objects</title>
  <description>Acme::Damn provides a single routine, damn(), which takes a blessed reference (a Perl object), and unblesses it, to return the original reference. I can't think of any reason why you might want to do this, but just because it's of no use doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to do it.</description>
