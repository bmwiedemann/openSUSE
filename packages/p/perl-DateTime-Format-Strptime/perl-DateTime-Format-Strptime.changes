  * Fix too-strict type checking for time zones. This module now uses the same
    check as DateTime itself, which allows for things that don't subclass
    DateTime::TimeZone as long as they provide the same API. Reported by
    E. Choroba. GH #30.

  * Fix tests for new failure caused by locale data changes in DateTime::Locale
    1.29. Reported by cthulhu8zombie. GH #28.

  * Added a warning about using locale-specific patterns. Some of these patterns
    can change quite a bit as the locale data is updated, so using them for
    parsing does not produce stable results across time. This is what caused the
    test failures that this release fixes.

  * When the parsed string contained an invalid time zone offset (parsed with
    "%z") like "-9999", the error handling set in the parser's constructor was
    ignored and an exception was always thrown. Reported by x-qq. GH #25.

  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]
  
  * The ability to set the pattern, time_zone, and locale via accessor methods
    has been removed. This was deprecated over three years ago in version
    1.60. It also turns out that the setting was actually broken for a long time
    but no one seemed to notice, so I think it's afe to remove this feature.

    was broken in 0.39. Reported by Slaven Rezić. GH #18.

  1.73     2017-01-31
  
  - The format_datetime now checks that the object it is given isa DateTime
    object. Implemented by Mohammad S Anwar. GitHub #17.
  
  
  1.72     2017-01-24
  
  - Require DateTime::Locale 1.05. This fixes some test failures seen on CPAN
    Testers. Also require DateTime::TimeZone 2.09 because you should really
    update this on a regular basis.
  
  - Require Specio 0.33 to fix other test failures seen on CPAN (I hope).
  
  
  1.71     2017-01-24
  
  - By default, the word boundary checks added in 1.69 are now off. You can
    enable them by passing "strict => 1" to the constructor. This was reported
    as an issue by Toby Corkindale as GitHub #15.
  
  - Switched from Params::Validate to Params::ValidationCompiler.

  - Altered the conversion specifier %z to accept ±HH, ±HHMM, ±HH:MM and Z.
    Previously only ±HHMM where accepted. PR from Christian Hansen, GitHub #13.
  
  
  1.69     2016-12-04 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - The word boundary check supposedly added in 1.67 didn't really work
    properly, and still matched too much. For example, the pattern "%d-%m-%y"
    would match "2016-11-30" and turn it into November 16, 2030. This also had
    problems at the end of strings, so that the same pattern would improperly
    match "30-11-2016" as November 30, 2020. Reported by Erik Huelsmann. GitHub
    #11.
  
  - Added docs for several formats which had long been supported but not
    documented. These are %P, %c, %x, and %X. Reported by Alexander
    Hartmaier. GH #10.

    much faster. Requested by Kent Fredric. RT #114237.

  1.67     2016-03-31
  
  - Fixed a regression introduced in 1.60. Older versions of this library would
    match dates pretty match anywhere in a string, so "%Y-%m-%d" would match a
    string like "abcd1234-12-30efgh". This is probably _too_ permissive, but we
    definitely want to match on word boundaries so that we match
    "log.2016-03-31". Based on a PR from YASUTAKE Kiyoshi. GitHub #3.
  
  
  1.66     2016-03-27
  
  - Added a zone_map constructor argument. This lets you supply a mapping for
    ambiguous time zone abbreviations. Based on a patch from Douglas Wilson. RT
    #74762.

    introduced in the latest IANA time zone database release.

    turned into a DateTime object in order to deal with changes coming in the
    next DateTime release.

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  - The behaviour of silently ignoring text after the matching part was
    lost in the rewrite. This has been restored. Patch by Dagfinn Ilmari
    Mannsåker. RT #111155.

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  - When on_error was set to something that did not die (including the default
    error handling), calling ->parse_datetime with some bad inputs could cause
    the module to error out internally by trying to call methods on an undefined
    value instead of returning undef. Reported by Mike Dorman. RT #110247.

  1.61     2015-11-13
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  - If you loaded this module with warnings globally enabled ("perl -w", which
    you should never do), then you'd get a warning about the import subroutine
    being redefined. This broke the Package::DeprecationManager API for turning
    off deprecation warnings. This has been fixed in
    Package::DeprecationManager 0.15. Reported by Martin. RT #108871.

  - This release is identical to the prior trial release. The changes for the
    trial releases are reproduced below for convenience.
  
  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]
  
  - The error messages for various types of failures have changed.
  
  - The never-documented diagnostic parameter for the constructor has been
    removed.
  
  - The never-documented feature to allow you to use arbitrary DateTime.pm
    methods in the parsing pattern has been removed. This never made much sense
    anyway, since most DateTime.pm methods are not constructor params, but they
    were used that way.
  
  - Using the pattern, locale, and time_zone to set the respective attribute is
    now deprecated. Make a new object instead of changing one of these values.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  - Fixed a warning from the tests with newer Perl versions. RT #107620.
  
  - Clarified docs to note that %Y and %G require 4-digit years. Reported by
    Karen Etheridge. RT #103147.
  
  - Using the 24-hour token (%H) with an AM/PM specifier (%p) now leads to an
    error if you try to parse something like "23:01 AM". Reported by Ric
    Signes. RT #92445.
  
  
  1.59     2015-10-25 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - The previous release accidentally included an old version of Strptime.pm in
    the root dir, causing all sorts of chaos and test failures.
  
  
  1.58     2015-10-18 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - This release is a substantial rewrite. Please test it and file bugs for any
    unintentional breakage.
  
  * The error messages for various types of failures have changed.

     Lucas. RT #84371.
  - Shut up "unescaped braces in regex" warning from 5.17.0. RT #77514. Patch by
    Zefram.

- 1.3000 2010-06-26

    actually contained leading space. Patch by Alex Vandiver. RT #58459.
  - License is now Artistic 2.0
- 1.2000 2010-03-19
  - Updated to use non-deprecated DateTime::Locale API
- 1.1000 2009-07-13 -- Regex Pattern

		- And a couple from Google:
		    #8		Add DateTime::Locale to documentation

  o autogen filelist with perl_gen_filelist
