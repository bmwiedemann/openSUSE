%description
text-unidecode is the most basic port of the Text::Unidecode Perl library.

There are other Python ports of Text::Unidecode (unidecode and
isounidecode). unidecode is GPL; isounidecode doesnâ€™t support Python 3
and uses too much memory.

This port is licensed under Artistic License and supports both Python
2.x and 3.x.
