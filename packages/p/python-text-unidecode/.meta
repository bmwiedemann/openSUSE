  <title>The most basic Text::Unidecode port</title>
  <description>text-unidecode is the most basic port of the Text::Unidecode Perl library.

There are other Python ports of Text::Unidecode (unidecode and isounidecode). unidecode is GPL; isounidecode doesn’t support Python 3 and uses too much memory.

This port is licensed under Artistic License and supports both Python 2.x and 3.x. If you’re OK with GPL, use unidecode (it has better memory usage and better transliteration quality).</description>
