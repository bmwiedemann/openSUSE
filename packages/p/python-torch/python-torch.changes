- Use GCC9 to build on aarch64 Tumbleweed to workaround SVE
  problem with GCC10 with sleef, see:

Tue Jun 23 15:28:57 UTC 2020 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to new stable release 1.5.1 which has following changes:
  This release includes several major new API additions and improvements. These
  include new APIs for autograd allowing for easy computation of hessians and
  jacobians, a significant update to the C++ frontend, ‘channels last’ memory
  format for more performant computer vision models, a stable release of the
  distributed RPC framework used for model parallel training, and a new API
  that allows for the creation of Custom C++ Classes that was inspired by
  PyBind. Additionally torch_xla 1.5 is now available and tested with the
  PyTorch 1.5 release providing a mature Cloud TPU experience.
  * see release.html for detailed information
- added patches: 
  * fix-call-of-onnxInitGraph.patch for API mismatch in onnx
  * fix-mov-operand-for-gcc.patch for aarch64 operands

- Inital commit of pytorch/caffe2 which is an opensource 
  machineleraning platform. This is the stable release 1.0.1 
  including like other tools a lot of third party sources, 
  which could not be used from the base system due to messy 
  build system. Additional sources are
  * gloo, a communitcation library for GPUs as
    gloo-670b4d4aa46886cc66874e2a4dc846f5cfc2a285.tar.gz

  * cpuinfo, a cross platform cpu information tool
    cpuinfo-89fe1695edf9ee14c22f815f24bac45577a4f135.tar.gz

    sleef-191f655caa25526ae226cf88dd2529265176014a.tar.gz
  * pytbind11, which exposes C/C++ headers to pythob, but
    the source code of this library is deeply integrated into
    pytorch, so we need
    pybind11-25abf7efba0b2990f5a6dfb0a31bc65c0f2f4d17.tar.gz
  * onnx, which is an format for exchaning neural networks as
    onnx-1.4.1.tar.gz
  * pthreadpool, a pthread based thread tool implementation, which 
    can be used when omp is not available
    pthreadpool-13da0b4c21d17f94150713366420baaf1b5a46f4.tar.gz
  * FXdiv, a Header-only library for division via fixed-point 
    multiplication by inverse, which has no stable API atm, so
    FXdiv-b742d1143724d646cd0f914646f1240eacf5bd73.tar.gz
  * psimd, portable 128-bit SIMD intrinsics
    psimd-90a938f30ba414ada2f4b00674ee9631d7d85e19.tar.gz
  * fp16, a numeric conversion library
    FP16-febbb1c163726b5db24bed55cc9dc42529068997.tar.gz
  * gemmlowp, self-contained low-precision GEMM library as
    gemmlowp-8416bab644641a5c0a81ecf91a5cda804af0aee1.tar.gz
  * fix-build-options.patch, which points pytorch to system libs
  * removed-peachpy-depedency.patch, which forces to use system 
    peachpy
