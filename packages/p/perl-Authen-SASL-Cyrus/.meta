  <title>SASL Authentication Framework - Cyrus Plugin</title>
  <description>SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
protocols.

Authen::SASL::Cyrus is a plug-in for the Authen::SASL module and
provides an implementation framework that all protocols should be able
to share.

The XS framework makes calls to the existing libsasl.so shared library
to perform SASL client connection functionality, including loading
existing shared library mechanisms.</description>
