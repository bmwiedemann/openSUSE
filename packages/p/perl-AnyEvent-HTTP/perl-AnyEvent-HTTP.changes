  	- fix incorrectly sending proxy requests to origin servers
            when reusing proxy connections (analyzed and testcase by Ivan Robert).
  	- the sessionid parameter was documented as session in random
            places - fix docs and keep using sessionid in the code as before.
  	- fix cookie format documentation.

  	- relative redirects used the proxy schema instead of the request
            url schema to generate the new url, which is wrong (analyzed by Felix
            Ostmann).
          - fix download example (reported by Felix Ostmann).

      - use the recurse parameter to also limit the number of retries to be

Tue Jun 14 09:45:02 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- updated to 2.12
  - fix a possible 'Can't call method "destroyed"' error (which would
    have been reported by Carl Chambers).
  - the keepalive session cache wouldn't take port and scheme into account
    when reusing connection - potentially causing information leaks
    (reported by Nick Kostirya).
  - bump AnyEvent dependency version (reported by Richard Harris).
  - the keepalive and persistent parameters were actually named
    differently in the code - they now work as documented.
  - fix a bug where callbacks would sometimes never be called when
    the request timeout is near or below the persistent connection
    timeout (testcase by Cindy Wang).
  - destroying the guard would have no effect when a request was
    recursing or being retired.
  - "proxy => undef" now overrides any global proxy when specified.
  - require scheme in urls, also use a stricter match to match urls,
    leading or trailing garbage is no longer tolerated.
  - EXPERIMENTAL: allow '=' in cookie values.
  - do not lowercase cookie names, only parameter names.
  - add missing dependency on common::sense.
  - add a resume download example.
