- Update to 6.1.0
  * Add a wait argument to Model.delete_table (#1270)
  * Add the ability to set or unset the boto retry configuration (#1271)
- from version 6.0.2
  * Fix a warning about datetime.utcfromtimestamp deprecation (#1261)
- from version 6.0.1
  * For failed transaction, return the underlying item in
    cancellation_reasons[...].raw_item (#1226). This only
    applies when passing return_values=ALL_OLD.
  * Fixing (#1242) regression to the extra_headers feature. These
    headers are intended for proxies that strip them, so they should
    be excluded from the AWS signature.
- from version 6.0.0
  * BinaryAttribute and BinarySetAttribute have undergone breaking changes:
    * The attributes’ internal encoding has changed. To prevent this change
      going unnoticed, a new required legacy_encoding parameter was added:
      see Upgrading Binary(Set)Attribute for details. If your codebase uses
      BinaryAttribute or BinarySetAttribute, go over the attribute declarations
      and mark them accordingly.
    * When using binary attributes, the return value of serialize() will no
      longer be JSON-serializable since it will contain bytes objects. Use
      to_dynamodb_dict() and to_simple_dict() for JSON-serializable mappings.
      for a safe JSON-serializable representation.
  * Python 3.6 is no longer supported.
  * PynamoDB no longer has a default AWS region (used to be us-east-1) (#1003).
    If needed, update your models’ Meta or set the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment
    variable.
  * Model’s JSON serialization helpers were changed:
    * to_json was renamed to to_simple_dict() (#1126). Additionally, to_dynamodb_dict()
      and from_dynamodb_dict() were added for round-trip JSON serialization.
    * pynamodb.util.attribute_value_to_json was removed (#1126)
  * Attribute’s default parameter must be either an immutable value (of one of
    the built-in immutable types) or a callable. This prevents a common class of
    errors caused by unintentionally mutating the default value. A simple workaround
    is to pass an initializer (e.g. change default={} to default=dict) or wrap in a
    lambda (e.g. change default={'foo': 'bar'} to default=lambda: {'foo': 'bar'}).
  * count(), query(), and scan() are now instance methods.
  * OperationSettings has been removed.
  * We are now compatible with opentelemetry botocore instrumentation.
  * We’ve reduced our usage of botocore private APIs (#1079). On multiple occasions,
    new versions of botocore broke PynamoDB, and this change lessens the likelihood
    of that happening in the future by reducing (albeit not eliminating) our reliance
    on private botocore APIs.
  * save(), update(), delete_item(), and delete() now accept a add_version_condition
    parameter. See Conditioning on the version for more details.
  * batch_get(), has guard rails defending against items without a hash_key and range_key.
  * set(), can remove attribute by assigning an empty value in the update expression.
- from version 5.5.1
  * Fix compatibility with botocore 1.33.2 (#1205)
- from version 5.5.0
  * save(), update(), delete_item(), and delete() now accept a add_version_condition
    parameter. See Conditioning on the version for more details.
- from version 5.4.1
  * Use model’s AWS credentials in threads (#1164)
- from version 5.4.0
  * Expose transaction cancellation reasons (#1156)
- from version 5.3.5
  * Fix exception message (#1157)
- Limit Python files matched in %files section
- Switch package to modern Python Stack on SLE-15
  * Use Python 3.11 on SLE-15 by default
  * Drop support for older Python versions
- Switch build system from setuptools to pyproject.toml
  * Add python-pip and python-wheel to BuildRequires
  * Remove python-devel and python-setuptools from BuildRequires
  * Replace %python_build with %pyproject_wheel
  * Replace %python_install with %pyproject_install
