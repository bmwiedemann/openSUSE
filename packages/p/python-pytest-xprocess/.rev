    <comment>- Remove python_module macro definition
- More specific python_sitelib in %files
- Update to 0.21.0:
  * Explicitly add py package as a dependency, fixing issue with pytest &gt;=
    7.2.0
  * Process log files will not be overwritten for each new process anymore,
    making it easier to debug issues that occurred in the middle of failed test
    runs
- 0.19.0:
  * drop support for python 3.5 and 3.6
  * reorganize internals. pytest-xprocess is now a package and all resources
    used by running processes are kept as instances of
    :class:XProcessResources.
- 0.18.1:
  * Fix bug with previous release where internal module was missing
- 0.18.0:
  * :method:`ProcessInfo.terminate` will now terminate outer leaves in process
    tree first and work its way towards root process. For example, if a process
    has child and grandchild, xprocess will terminate first child and
    grandchild and only then will the root process receive a termination
    signal.
  * :class:`ProcessStarter` now has attr:terminate_on_interrupt. This flag will
    make xprocess attempt to terminate and clean up all started process
    resources upon interruptions during pytest runs (CTRL+C, SIGINT and
    internal errors) when set to True. It will default to False, so if the
    described behaviour is desired the flag must be explicitly set True.
  * Add a new popen_kwargs variable to ProcessStarter, this variable can be
    used for passing keyword values to the subprocess.Popen constructor, giving
    the user more control over how the process is initialized.

    <comment>- update to 0.22.2:
  * Python 3.10 is now officially supported
  * `surrogateescape` will now be used as error handling strategy
    for encode/decode operations.
  * Make log files persistency, added in `0.21.0`, optional,
    defaulting to True. The previous logging behavior (prior to
    `0.21.0`) can be enabled by setting `persist_logs` flag to
    `False` when calling `XProcess.ensure`.
  * Fix resource warnings due to leaked internal file handles
  * Ignore zombie processes which are erroneously considered
    alive with python 3.11</comment>
