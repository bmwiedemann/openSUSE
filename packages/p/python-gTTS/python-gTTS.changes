  ------------------
  Features
  ~~~~~~~

  2.2.2 (2021-02-03)
  ------------------
  Features
  ~~~~~~~
  - Adds a language fallback feature for deprecated languages to maintain compatiblity  
    (e.g. ``en-us`` becomes ``en``). Fallback can be disabled with ``lang_check=False`` 
    or ``--nocheck`` for the cli (`#267 <https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/267>`_)
  Bugfixes
  ~~~~~~~
  - Fix Python 2.7 compatiblity (!). Python 2 is long gone, but the cut wasn't clearly communicated
    for gTTS, so it was restored. Python 2 support will be completely removed in the next major release.
    (`#255 <https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/255>`_)
  - Language code case sensitivity is maintained throughout (`#267 <https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/267>`_)
  Deprecations and Removals
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - The following list of 'hyphenated' language codes no longer work and have been removed: ``en-us``, ``en-ca``,
    ``en-uk``, ``en-gb``, ``en-au``, ``en-gh``, ``en-in``, ``en-ie``, ``en-nz``, ``en-ng``, ``en-ph``, ``en-za``,

    (`#267 <https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/267>`_)
  - Removed the ``gtts.get_url()`` method (outdated since ``2.1.0``)
    (`#270 <https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/270>`_)
- do not require python-mock for build, testsuite is not run

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  6 09:24:58 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.1
  * Debug mode now uses a copy of locals() to prevent RuntimeError (`#213 <https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/213>`_)
  * Added the ability to customize the Google Translate URL hostname.
    This is useful when ``google.com`` might be blocked within a network but
    a local or different Google host (e.g. ``google.cn``) is not
  * Pre-generated TTS API request URLs can now be obtained instead of
    writing an ``mp3`` file to disk (for example to be used in an
    external program)
  * New ``--tld`` option to match the new ``gtts`` customizable hostname
  * Added Python 3.8 support

  instead of bs4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  2 21:52:59 UTC 2019 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 2.0.3:
  * Added new tokenizer case for ':' preventing cut in the middle of
    a time notation

- Update to 2.0.2:
  Features
  * Added Python 3.7 support, modernization of packaging, testing and CI
  Bugfixes
  * Fixed language retrieval/validation broken from new Google Translate page

- Update to 2.0.1:
  Bugfixes
  * Fixed an UnicodeDecodeError when installing gTTS if system locale was
    not utf-8
  Improved Documentation
  * Added Pre-processing and tokenizing > Minimizing section about the API's
    100 characters limit and how larger tokens are handled

- Update to 2.0.0:
  Features
  * The gtts module
    + New logger ("gtts") replaces all occurrences of print()
    + Languages list is now obtained automatically (gtts.lang)
    + Added a curated list of language sub-tags that have been observed to
      provide different dialects or accents (e.g. "en-gb", "fr-ca")
    + New gTTS() parameter lang_check to disable language checking.
    + gTTS() now delegates the text tokenizing to the API request methods (i.e.
      write_to_fp(), save()), allowing gTTS instances to be modified/reused
    + Rewrote tokenizing and added pre-processing (see below)
    + New gTTS() parameters pre_processor_funcs and tokenizer_func to configure
      pre-processing and tokenizing (or use a 3rd party tokenizer)
    + Error handling:
      - Added new exception gTTSError raised on API request errors. It attempts
        to guess what went wrong based on known information and observed
        behaviour
      - gTTS.write_to_fp() and gTTS.save() also raise gTTSError on gtts_token
        error
      - gTTS.write_to_fp() raises TypeError when fp is not a file-like object
        or one that doesn't take bytes
      - gTTS() raises ValueError on unsupported languages (and lang_check is
        True)
      - More fine-grained error handling throughout (e.g. request failed vs.
        request successful with a bad response)
  * Tokenizer (and new pre-processors):
    + Rewrote and greatly expanded tokenizer (gtts.tokenizer)
    + Smarter token 'cleaning' that will remove tokens that only contain
      characters that can't be spoken (i.e. punctuation and whitespace)
    + Decoupled token minimizing from tokenizing, making the latter usable
      in other contexts
    + New flexible speech-centric text pre-processing
    + New flexible full-featured regex-based tokenizer
      (gtts.tokenizer.core.Tokenizer)
    + New RegexBuilder, PreProcessorRegex and PreProcessorSub classes to make
      writing regex-powered text pre-processors and tokenizer cases easier
    + Pre-processors:
      - Re-form words cut by end-of-line hyphens
      - Remove periods after a (customizable) list of known abbreviations (e.g.
        "jr", "sr", "dr") that can be spoken the same without a period
      - Perform speech corrections by doing word-for-word replacements from a
        (customizable) list of tuples
    + Tokenizing:
      - Keep punctuation that modify the inflection of speech (e.g. "?", "!")
      - Don't split in the middle of numbers (e.g. "10.5", "20,000,000")
      - Don't split on "dotted" abbreviations and accronyms (e.g. "U.S.A")
      - Added Chinese comma ("，"), ellipsis ("…") to punctuation list to
        tokenize on
  * The gtts-cli command-line tool
      - Rewrote cli as first-class citizen module (gtts.cli), powered by Click
      - Windows support using setuptool's entry_points
      - Better support for Unicode I/O in Python 2
      - All arguments are now pre-validated
      - New --nocheck flag to skip language pre-checking
      - New --all flag to list all available languages
      - Either the --file option or the <text> argument can be set to "-" to
        read from stdin
      - The --debug flag uses logging and doesn't pollute stdout anymore
  Bugfixes
  *  _minimize(): Fixed an infinite recursion loop that would occur when a
     token started with the miminizing delimiter (i.e. a space)
  *  _minimize(): Handle the case where a token of more than 100 characters
     did not contain a space (e.g. in Chinese).
  *  Fixed an issue that fused multiline text together if the total number of
     characters was less than 100
  *  Fixed gtts-cli Unicode errors in Python 2.7
  Deprecations and Removals
  * Dropped Python 3.3 support
  * Removed debug parameter of gTTS (in favour of logger)
  * gtts-cli: Changed long option name of -o to --output instead of
    --destination
  * gTTS() will raise a ValueError rather than an AssertionError on
    unsupported language
  Improved Documentation
  * Rewrote all documentation files as reStructuredText
  * Comprehensive documentation writen for Sphinx, published to
    http://gtts.readthedocs.io
  * Changelog built with towncrier
  Misc
  * Major test re-work
  * Language tests can read a TEST_LANGS enviromment variable so not all
    language tests are run every time.
  * Added AppVeyor CI for Windows
  * PEP 8 compliance

- Add remove-pip-requirement.patch to remove the dependency on pip to build
  the package.
