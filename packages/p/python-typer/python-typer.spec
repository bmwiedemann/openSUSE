%description
Typer is a library for building CLI applications based on Python 3.6+ type hints.

Based on type hints, Typer enables great editor support and completion for developers.
With automatic help and completion, Typer makes CLIs easy to use for users.

This package provides the Typer Python package and ensures all dependencies required
for full functionality are provided. In addition, it provides the command "typer"
which allows users to run scripts not using typer with the same command line comfort
as those that do.
