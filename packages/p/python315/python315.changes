Thu Nov  6 23:45:56 UTC 2025 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Add CVE-2025-8291-consistency-zip64.patch which checks
  consistency of the zip64 end of central directory record, and
  preventing obfuscation of the payload, i.e., you scanning for
  malicious content in a ZIP file with one ZIP parser (let's say
  a Rust one) then unpack it in production with another (e.g.,
  the Python one) and get malicious content that the other parser
  did not see (CVE-2025-8291, bsc#1251305)

Fri Oct 24 21:45:47 UTC 2025 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- New development of new major version, update to 3.15.0~a1:
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-139330: SBOM generation tool didn’t cross-check
      the version and checksum values against the
      Modules/expat/refresh.sh script, leading to the values
      becoming out-of-date during routine updates.
    - gh-132006: XCframeworks now include privacy manifests to
      satisfy Apple App Store submission requirements.
    - gh-138171: A script for building an iOS XCframework was
      added. As part of this change, the top level iOS folder has
      been moved to be a subdirectory of the Apple folder.
    - gh-137873: The iOS test runner has been simplified,
      resolving some issues that have been observed using
      the runner in GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines test
      environments.
    - gh-137484: Have Tools/wasm/wasi put the build Python into a
      directory named after the build triple instead of “build”.
    - gh-137025: The wasm_build.py script has been removed.
      Tools/wasm/emscripten and Tools/wasm/wasi should be used
      instead, as described in the Dev Guide.
    - gh-137248: Add a --logdir option to Tools/wasm/wasi for
      specifying where to write log files.
    - gh-137243: Have Tools/wasm/wasi detect a WASI SDK install
      in /opt when it was directly extracted from a release
      tarball.
    - gh-136251: Fixes and usability improvements for
      Tools/wasm/emscripten/web_example
    - gh-135968: Stubs for strip are now provided as part of an
      iOS install.
    - gh-135379: The cases generator no longer accepts type
      annotations on stack items. Conversions to non-default
      types are now done explicitly in bytecodes.c and
      optimizer_bytecodes.c. This will simplify code generation
      for top-of-stack caching and other future features.
    - gh-134215: REPL import autocomplete only suggests private
      modules when explicitly specified.
  - Tests
    - gh-139208: Fix regrtest --fast-ci --verbose: don’t ignore
      the --verbose option anymore. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-138313: Restore skipped test and add janky workaround
      to prevent select buildbots from failing with a
      ResourceWarning.
    - gh-135966: The iOS testbed now handles the app_packages
      folder as a site directory.
    - gh-135494: Fix regrtest to support excluding tests from
      --pgo tests. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-132815: Fix test__opcode: add JUMP_BACKWARD to
      specialization stats.
    - gh-135489: Show verbose output for failing tests during PGO
      profiling step with –enable-optimizations.
    - gh-135401: Add a new GitHub CI job to test the ssl module
      with AWS-LC as the backing cryptography and TLS library.
    - gh-135120: Add test.support.subTests().
    - gh-134567: Expose log formatter to users in
      TestCase.assertLogs. unittest.TestCase.assertLogs() will
      now optionally accept a formatter that will be used to
      format the strings in output if provided.
    - gh-133744: Fix multiprocessing interrupt test. Add an event
      to synchronize the parent process with the child process:
      wait until the child process starts sleeping. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-133682: Fixed test case
      test.test_annotationlib.TestStringFormat.test_displays
      which ensures proper handling of complex data structures
      (lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples) in string
      annotations.
    - gh-133639: Fix
      TestPyReplAutoindent.test_auto_indent_default() doesn’t run
      input_code.
  - Security
    - gh-139700: Check consistency of the zip64 end of central
      directory record. Support records with “zip64 extensible
      data” if there are no bytes prepended to the ZIP file
      (bsc#1251305, CVE-2025-8291).
    - gh-139400: xml.parsers.expat: Make sure that parent
      Expat parsers are only garbage-collected once they
      are no longer referenced by subparsers created by
      ExternalEntityParserCreate(). Patch by Sebastian Pipping.
    - gh-139283: sqlite3: correctly handle maximum number of rows
      to fetch in Cursor.fetchmany and reject negative values for
      Cursor.arraysize. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-136053: marshal: fix a possible crash when deserializing
      slice objects.
    - gh-135661: Fix parsing start and end tags in
      html.parser.HTMLParser according to the HTML5 standard.
      - Whitespaces no longer accepted between </ and the tag
        name. E.g. </ script> does not end the script section.
      - Vertical tabulation (\v) and non-ASCII whitespaces no
        longer recognized as whitespaces. The only whitespaces
        are \t\n\r\f and space.
      - Null character (U+0000) no longer ends the tag name.
      - Attributes and slashes after the tag name in end tags are
        now ignored, instead of terminating after the first > in
        quoted attribute value. E.g. </script/foo=">"/>.
      - Multiple slashes and whitespaces between the last
        attribute and closing > are now ignored in both start and
        end tags. E.g. <a foo=bar/ //>.
      - Multiple = between attribute name and value are no longer
        collapsed. E.g. <a foo==bar> produces attribute “foo”
        with value “=bar”.
    - gh-135661: Fix CDATA section parsing in
      html.parser.HTMLParser according to the HTML5 standard: ]
      ]> and ]] > no longer end the CDATA section. Add private
      method _set_support_cdata() which can be used to specify
      how to parse <[CDATA[ — as a CDATA section in foreign
      content (SVG or MathML) or as a bogus comment in the HTML
      namespace.
    - gh-102555: Fix comment parsing in html.parser.HTMLParser
      according to the HTML5 standard. --!> now ends the comment.
      -- > no longer ends the comment. Support abnormally ended
      empty comments <--> and <--->.
    - gh-135462: Fix quadratic complexity in processing specially
      crafted input in html.parser.HTMLParser. End-of-file errors
      are now handled according to the HTML5 specs – comments and
      declarations are automatically closed, tags are ignored.
    - gh-118350: Fix support of escapable raw text mode (elements
      “textarea” and “title”) in html.parser.HTMLParser.
    - gh-135034: Fixes multiple issues that allowed tarfile
      extraction filters (filter="data" and filter="tar") to be
      bypassed using crafted symlinks and hard links.
    - Addresses CVE 2024-12718, CVE 2025-4138, CVE 2025-4330, and
      CVE 2025-4517.

      decoder with a non-“strict” error handler.
    - gh-133623: Indicate through ssl.HAS_PSK_TLS13 whether
      the ssl module supports “External PSKs” in TLSv1.3, as
      described in RFC 9258. Patch by Will Childs-Klein.
    - gh-128840: Short-circuit the processing of long IPv6
      addresses early in ipaddress to prevent excessive memory
      consumption and a minor denial-of-service.
  - Library
    - gh-139482: Optimize os.environ.clear() by calling
      clearenv(3) when this function is available. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-139958: The application/toml mime type is now supported
      by mimetypes. Patch by Gil Forcada.
    - gh-139823: ensurepip now fails with a nicer error message
      when the zlib module is not available.
    - gh-139905: Add suggestion to error message for
      typing.Generic subclasses when cls.__parameters__
      is missing due to a parent class failing to call
      super().__init_subclass__() in its __init_subclass__.
    - gh-139894: Fix incorrect sharing of current task with the
      child process while forking in asyncio. Patch by Kumar

      color environment variable changes after parser creation.
    - gh-139736: Fix excessive indentation in the default
      argparse HelpFormatter. Patch by Alexander Edland.
    - gh-70765: http.server: fix default handling of HTTP/0.9
      requests in BaseHTTPRequestHandler. Previously,
      BaseHTTPRequestHandler.parse_request() incorrectly waited
      for headers in the request although those are not supported
      in HTTP/0.9. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-139322: Fix os.getlogin() error handling: fix the error
      number. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-135953: Add a Gecko format output to the tachyon
      profiler via --gecko.
    - gh-139184: os.forkpty() does now make the returned file
      descriptor non-inheritable.
    - gh-139391: Fix an issue when, on non-Windows platforms, it
      was not possible to gracefully exit a python -m asyncio
      process suspended by Ctrl+Z and later resumed by fg other
      than with kill.
    - gh-139374: timeit: Add color to error tracebacks.
    - gh-90949: Add

      restore the existing completer after importing rlcompleter.
    - gh-90949: Add SetAllocTrackerActivationThreshold() and
      SetAllocTrackerMaximumAmplification() to xmlparser objects
      to tune protections against disproportional amounts of
      dynamic memory usage from within an Expat parser. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-67795: Functions that take timestamp or timeout
      arguments now accept any real numbers (such as Decimal and
      Fraction), not only integers or floats, although this does
      not improve precision.
    - gh-95953: A CSS class, diff_changed, was added to the
      changed lines in the make_table output of difflib.HtmlDiff.
      Patch by Katie Gardner.
    - gh-139210: Fix use-after-free when reporting unknown event
      in xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse(). Patch by Ken Jin.

      KeyboardInterrupt to a Python process running a
      subinterpreter in a separate thread.
    - gh-118803: collections.abc.ByteString has been removed from
      collections.abc.__all__, and typing.ByteString has been
      removed from typing.__all__. The former has been deprecated
      since Python 3.12, and the latter has been deprecated since
      Python 3.9. Both classes are scheduled for removal in
      Python 3.17.
    - Additionally, the following statements now cause
      DeprecationWarnings to be emitted at runtime:
      from collections.abc import ByteString, from
      typing import ByteString, import collections.abc;
      collections.abc.ByteString and import typing;
      typing.ByteString. Both classes already caused
      DeprecationWarnings to be emitted if they were subclassed
      or used as the second argument to isinstance() or
      issubclass(), but they did not previously lead to
      DeprecationWarnings if they were merely imported or
      accessed from their respective modules.
    - gh-135729: Fix unraisable exception during finalization
      when using concurrent.interpreters in the REPL.

    - gh-139065: Fix trailing space before a wrapped long word if
      the line length is exactly width in textwrap.
    - gh-139001: Fix race condition in pathlib.Path on the

      None instead of a shared dictionary.
    - gh-138998: Update bundled libexpat to 2.7.2
    - gh-138993: Dedent credits text.
    - gh-118803: Add back collections.abc.ByteString and
      typing.ByteString. Both had been removed in prior alpha,
      beta and release candidates for Python 3.14, but their
      removal has now been postponed to Python 3.17.
    - gh-130567: Fix possible crash in locale.strxfrm() due to a
      platform bug on macOS.
    - gh-137226: Fix typing.get_type_hints() calls on generic
      typing.TypedDict classes defined with string annotations.
    - gh-138899: Executing quit command in pdb will raise
      bdb.BdbQuit when pdb is started from an asyncio console
      using breakpoint() or pdb.set_trace().
    - gh-138804: Raise TypeError instead of AttributeError when
      an argument of incorrect type is passed to shlex.quote().
      This restores the behavior of the function prior to 3.14.
    - gh-138779: Support device numbers larger than 2**63-1 for
      the st_rdev field of the os.stat_result structure.
    - gh-138682: Added symmetric difference support to
      collections.Counter objects.
    - gh-138712: Add os.NODEV.
    - gh-128636: Fix crash in PyREPL when os.environ is
      overwritten with an invalid value for mac
    - gh-138720: Fix an issue where io.BufferedWriter and
      io.BufferedRandom had different definitions of “closed” for
      close() and flush() which resulted in an exception when
      close called flush but flush thought the file was already
      closed.
    - gh-138706: Update unicodedata database to Unicode 17.0.0.
    - gh-76007: Deprecate __version__ from a number of standard
      library modules. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.

      os.scandir() are now immutable. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-116946: tkinter: the types _tkinter.Tcl_Obj (wrapper
      for Tcl objects), _tkinter.tktimertoken (obtained by
      calling createtimerhandler() on a Tk application) and
      _tkinter.tkapp (the runtime type of Tk applications) are
      now immutable. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-138514: Raise ValueError when a multi-character string
      is passed to the echo_char parameter of getpass.getpass().
      Patch by Benjamin Johnson.
    - gh-137706: Fix the partial evaluation of annotations that
      use typing.Annotated[T, x] where T is a forward reference.
    - gh-88375: Fix normalization of the robots.txt rules and
      URLs in the urllib.robotparser module. No longer ignore
      trailing ?. Distinguish raw special characters ?, = and &
      from the percent-encoded ones.
    - gh-138515: email is added to Emscripten build.
    - gh-99948: ctypes.util.find_library() now works in
      Emscripten build.

    - gh-138432: zoneinfo.reset_tzpath() will now convert any
      os.PathLike objects it receives into strings before adding
      them to TZPATH. It will raise TypeError if anything other
      than a string is found after this conversion. If given an
      os.PathLike object that represents a relative path, it will
      now raise ValueError instead of TypeError, and present a
      more informative error message.

      Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-57911: When extracting tar files on Windows, slashes in
      symlink targets will be replaced by backslashes to prevent
      corrupted links.
    - gh-138205: Removed the resize() method on platforms that
      don’t support the underlying syscall, instead of raising a
      SystemError.
    - gh-138008: Fix segmentation faults in the ctypes module due
      to invalid argtypes. Patch by Dung Nguyen.
    - gh-138252: ssl: SSLContext objects can now set client and
      server TLS signature algorithms. If Python has been built
      with OpenSSL 3.5 or later, SSLSocket objects can return the
      signature algorithms selected on a connection.
    - gh-138253: Add the block parameter in the put() and
      get() methods of the concurrent.interpreters queues for
      compatibility with the queue.Queue interface.

      extra_items keyword arguments (as described in PEP 728) to
      control whether additional non-required keys are allowed
      and to specify their value type.
    - gh-132947: Applied changes to importlib.metadata from
      importlib_metadata 8.7, including dist now disallowed
      for EntryPoints.select; deferred imports for faster
      import times; added support for metadata with newlines
      (python/cpython#119650); and metadata() function now
      returns None when a metadata directory is present but no
      metadata is present.
    - gh-90548: Fix musl detection for platform.libc_ver() on
      Alpine Linux if compiled with –strip-all.
    - gh-137317: inspect.signature() now correctly handles

      RLIM_SAVED_CUR, and RLIM_SAVED_MAX.
    - gh-137044: resource.RLIM_INFINITY is now always a positive
      integer. On all supported platforms, it is larger than any
      limited resource value, which simplifies comparison of the
      resource values. Previously, it could be negative, such as
      -1 or -3, depending on platform.
    - gh-137477: Fix inspect.getblock(), inspect.getsourcelines()
      and inspect.getsource() for generator expressions.
    - gh-137481: Calendar uses the lengths of the locale’s
      weekdays to decide if the width requires abbreviation.
    - gh-137466: Remove undocumented glob.glob0() and
      glob.glob1() functions, which have been deprecated since
      Python 3.13. Use glob.glob() and pass a directory to its
      root_dir argument instead.
    - gh-137044: Return large limit values as positive integers
      instead of negative integers in resource.getrlimit().
      Accept large values and reject negative values (except
      RLIM_INFINITY) for limits in resource.setrlimit().
    - gh-115766: Fix ipaddress.IPv4Interface.is_unspecified.
    - gh-75989: tarfile.TarFile.extractall() and
      tarfile.TarFile.extract() now overwrite symlinks when
      extracting hardlinks. (Contributed by Alexander Enrique
      Urieles Nieto in gh-75989.)
    - gh-137017: Fix threading.Thread.is_alive to remain True
      until the underlying OS thread is fully cleaned up. This
      avoids false negatives in edge cases involving thread
      monitoring or premature threading.Thread.is_alive calls.
    - gh-137273: Fix debug assertion failure in
      locale.setlocale() on Windows.
    - gh-137191: Fix how type parameters are collected, when
      typing.Protocol are specified with explicit parameters.
      Now, typing.Generic and typing.Protocol always dictate the
      parameter number and parameter ordering of types. Previous
      behavior was a bug.
    - gh-137282: Fix tab completion and dir() on
      concurrent.futures.

      inputs.
    - gh-137226: Fix behavior of
      annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate() when the type_params
      parameter is passed and the name of a type param is also
      present in an enclosing scope.
    - gh-137197: SSLContext objects can now set TLS 1.3 cipher
      suites via set_ciphersuites().
    - gh-81325: tarfile.TarFile now accepts a path-like when
      working on a tar archive. (Contributed by Alexander Enrique
      Urieles Nieto in gh-81325.)
    - gh-137185: Fix a potential async-signal-safety issue in
      faulthandler when printing C stack traces.
    - gh-133951: Remove lib64-lib symlink creation when creating
      new virtual environments in venv module
    - gh-130522: Fix unraisable TypeError raised during
      interpreter shutdown in the threading module.
    - gh-137059: Fix handling of file URLs with a
      Windows drive letter in the URL authority by
      urllib.request.url2pathname(). This fixes a regression in
      earlier pre-releases of Python 3.14.
    - gh-136980: Remove unused C tracing code in bdb for event
      type c_call, c_return and c_exception
    - gh-130577: tarfile now validates archives to ensure member
      offsets are non-negative. (Contributed by Alexander Enrique
      Urieles Nieto in gh-130577.)
    - gh-136170: Removed the unreleased
      zipfile.ZipFile.data_offset property added in 3.14.0a7 as
      it wasn’t fully clear which behavior it should have in some
      situations so the result was not always what a user might
      expect.
    - gh-121237: Support %:z directive for
      datetime.datetime.strptime(), datetime.time.strptime() and
      time.strptime(). Patch by Lucas Esposito and Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-136929: Ensure that hash functions guaranteed to be
      always available exist as attributes of hashlib even if
      they will not work at runtime due to missing backend
      implementations. For instance, hashlib.md5 will no longer
      raise AttributeError if OpenSSL is not available and Python
      has been built without MD5 support. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-124621: pyrepl now works in Emscripten.
    - gh-136914: Fix retrieval of doctest.DocTest.lineno
      for objects decorated with functools.cache() or
      functools.cached_property.
    - gh-136912: hmac.digest() now properly handles large
      keys and messages by falling back to the pure Python
      implementation when necessary. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-83424: Allows creating a ctypes.CDLL without name when
      passing a handle as an argument.
    - gh-135228: When dataclasses replaces a class with a slotted
      dataclass, the original class can now be garbage collected
      again. Earlier changes in Python 3.14 caused this class to
      always remain in existence together with the replacement
      class synthesized by dataclasses.
    - gh-136874: Discard URL query and fragment in
      urllib.request.url2pathname().
    - gh-136787: hashlib: improve exception messages when a
      hash algorithm is not recognized, blocked by the current
      security policy or incompatible with the desired operation
      (for instance, using HMAC with SHAKE). Patch by Bénédikt
      Tran.
    - gh-130645: Enable color help by default in argparse.
    - gh-131724: In http.client, a new max_response_headers
      keyword-only parameter has been added to HTTPConnection
      and HTTPSConnection constructors. This parameter sets the
      maximum number of allowed response headers, helping to
      prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    - gh-135427: With -Werror, the DeprecationWarning emitted
      by os.fork() and os.forkpty() in mutli-threaded processes
      is now raised as an exception. Previously it was silently
      ignored. Patch by Rani Pinchuk.
    - gh-136234: Fix asyncio.WriteTransport.writelines() to be
      robust to connection failure, by using the same behavior as
      write().
    - gh-53144: encodings.aliases: Add latin_N aliases
    - gh-136669: _asyncio is now statically linked for improved
      performance.
    - gh-136134: SMTP.auth_cram_md5() now raises an SMTPException
      instead of a ValueError if Python has been built without
      MD5 support. In particular, SMTP clients will not attempt
      to use this method even if the remote server is assumed to
      support it. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-136134: IMAP4.login_cram_md5 now raises an IMAP4.error
      if CRAM-MD5 authentication is not supported. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-136591: _hashlib: avoid using deprecated functions
      ERR_func_error_string and EVP_MD_CTX_md when using OpenSSL
      3.0 and later. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-136571: datetime.date.fromisocalendar() can now raise
      OverflowError for out of range arguments.
    - gh-136549: Fix signature of threading.excepthook().
    - gh-136492: Expose PEP 667’s FrameLocalsProxyType in the
      types module.
    - gh-83336: utf8_sig is now aliased to encodings.utf_8_sig
    - gh-136523: Fix wave.Wave_write emitting an unraisable when
      open raises.
    - gh-136507: Fix mimetypes CLI to handle multiple file
      parameters.
    - gh-52876: Add missing keepends (default True)
      parameter to codecs.StreamReaderWriter.readline() and
      codecs.StreamReaderWriter.readlines().
    - gh-136470: Correct
      concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor’s default thread
      name.
    - gh-136476: Fix a bug that was causing the
      get_async_stack_trace function to miss some frames in the
      stack trace.
    - gh-136434: Fix docs generation of UnboundItem in
      concurrent.interpreters when running with -OO.
    - gh-136380: Raises AttributeError when accessing
      concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor and
      subinterpreters are not available.
    - gh-72327: Suggest using the system command prompt when pip
      install is typed into the REPL. Patch by Tom Viner, Richard
      Si, and Brian Schubert.
    - gh-135953: Implement a new high-frequency runtime
      profiler that leverages the existing remote debugging
      functionality to collect detailed execution statistics
      from running Python processes. This tool is exposed in the
      profile.sample module and enables non-intrusive observation
      of production applications by attaching to already-running
      processes without requiring any code modifications,
      restarts, or special startup flags. The observer can
      perform extremely high-frequency sampling of stack traces
      and interpreter state, providing detailed runtime execution
      analysis of live applications.
    - gh-136021: Make type_params parameter required in
      typing._eval_type() after a deprecation period
      for not providing this parameter. Also remove the
      DeprecationWarning for the old behavior.
    - gh-136286: Fix pickling failures for protocols 0 and 1 for
      many objects related to subinterpreters.
    - gh-136047: Fix issues with typing when the C implementation
      of abc is not available.
    - gh-136316: Improve support for evaluating nested forward
      references in typing.evaluate_forward_ref().
    - gh-136306: ssl can now get and set groups used for key
      agreement.
    - gh-136156: tempfile.TemporaryFile() no longer uses
      os.O_EXCL with os.O_TMPFILE, so it’s possible to use
      linkat() on the file descriptor. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-133982: Update Python implementation of io.BytesIO to be
      thread safe.
    - gh-136193: Improve TypeError error message, when
      richcomparing two types.SimpleNamespace objects.

      is raised rather than a PermissionError. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - gh-90733: Improve error messages when reporting invalid
      parameters in hashlib.scrypt(). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-134759: Fix UnboundLocalError in
      email.message.Message.get_payload() when the payload to
      decode is a bytes object. Patch by Kliment Lamonov.
    - gh-136028: Fix parsing month names containing “İ” (U+0130,
      LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE) in time.strptime().
      This affects locales az_AZ, ber_DZ, ber_MA and crh_UA.
    - gh-87135: Acquiring a threading.Lock or threading.RLock at
      interpreter shutdown will raise PythonFinalizationError if
      Python can determine that it would otherwise deadlock.
    - gh-135995: In the palmos encoding, make byte 0x9b decode to
      › (U+203A - SINGLE RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK).

      modules.
    - gh-53203: Fix time.strptime() for %c and %x formats on
      locales byn_ER, wal_ET and lzh_TW, and for %X format on
      locales ar_SA, bg_BG and lzh_TW.
    - gh-135878: Fixes a crash of types.SimpleNamespace on free
      threading builds, when several threads were calling its
      __repr__() method at the same time.

      larger and smaller of two floating-point values. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-135836: Fix IndexError in
      asyncio.loop.create_connection() that could occur when
      non-OSError exception is raised during connection and
      socket’s close() raises OSError.
    - gh-135853: math: expose C99 signbit() function to determine
      whether the sign bit of a floating-point value is set.
      Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-134531: hmac: use the EVP_MAC(3ssl) interface for HMAC
      when Python is built with OpenSSL 3.0 and later instead of
      the deprecated HMAC_CTX(3ssl) interface. Patch by Bénédikt
      Tran.
    - gh-135836: Fix IndexError in
      asyncio.loop.create_connection() that could occur when the
      Happy Eyeballs algorithm resulted in an empty exceptions
      list during connection attempts.
    - gh-135855: Raise TypeError instead of SystemError when
      _interpreters.set___main___attrs() is passed a non-dict
      object. Patch by Brian Schubert.
    - gh-135823: netrc: improve the error message when
      the security check for the ownership of the default
      configuration file ~/.netrc fails. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-135815: netrc: skip security checks if os.getuid() is
      missing. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-135640: Address bug where it was possible to call
      xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree.write() on an ElementTree
      object with an invalid root element. This behavior blanked
      the file passed to write if it already existed.
    - gh-90117: Speed up pprint for list and tuple.
    - gh-135759: hashlib: reject negative digest lengths in
      OpenSSL-based SHAKE objects by raising a ValueError.

      typing.get_type_hints()
    - gh-135321: Raise a correct exception for values greater
      than 0x7fffffff for the BINSTRING opcode in the C
      implementation of pickle.
    - gh-121914: Changed the names of the symbol tables for
      lambda expressions and generator expressions to “<lambda>”
      and “<genexpr>” respectively to avoid conflicts with
      user-defined names.
    - gh-135276: Synchronized zipfile.Path with zipp 3.23,
      including improved performance of zipfile.Path.open() for
      non-reading modes, rely on functools.cached_property() to
      cache values on the instance. Rely on save_method_args to
      save the initialization method arguments. Fixed .name,
      .stem and other basename-based properties on Windows when
      working with a zipfile on disk.
    - gh-135234: hashlib: improve exception messages when an
      OpenSSL function failed. When memory allocation fails
      on OpenSSL’s side, a MemoryError is raised instead of a
      ValueError. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-135244: uuid: when the MAC address cannot be
      determined, the 48-bit node ID is now generated with a
      cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator
      (CSPRNG) as per RFC 9562, §6.10.3. This affects uuid1() and
      uuid6().
    - gh-135241: The INT opcode of the C accelerator _pickle
      module was updated to look only for “00” and “01” to push
      booleans onto the stack, aligning with the Python pickle
      module.
    - gh-133934: Improve sqlite3 CLI’s .help message.
    - gh-135069: Fix the “Invalid error handling” exception in
      encodings.idna.IncrementalDecoder to correctly replace the
      ‘errors’ parameter.

      implement in repl.
    - gh-134978: hashlib: Supporting the string keyword parameter
      in hash function constructors such as new() or the direct
      hash-named constructors such as md5() and sha256() is now
      deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.19. Prefer
      passing the initial data as a positional argument for
      maximum backwards compatibility. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-134970: Fix the “unknown action” exception in
      argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group() to correctly
      replace the action class.
    - gh-134718: By default, omit optional Load() values in

      they are default values.
    - gh-134939: Add the concurrent.interpreters module. See PEP
      734.
    - gh-108885: Run each example as a subtest in unit
      tests synthesized by doctest.DocFileSuite()
      and doctest.DocTestSuite(). Add the
      doctest.DocTestRunner.report_skip() method.
    - gh-134885: Fix possible crash in the compression.zstd
      module related to setting parameter types. Patch by Jelle
      Zijlstra.

      IPv4 address.
    - gh-133579: curses: Consistently report failures of
      curses C API calls in module-level methods by raising
      a curses.error. This affects assume_default_colors(),
      baudrate(), cbreak(), echo(), longname(), initscr(), nl(),
      raw(), termattrs(), termname() and unctrl(). Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-133579: curses.window.refresh() and
      curses.window.noutrefresh() now raise a TypeError instead
      of curses.error when called with an incorrect number of

      insnstr(). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-134771: The time_clockid_converter() function now
      selects correct type for clockid_t on Cygwin which fixes a
      build error.
    - gh-134637: Fix performance regression in calling a ctypes
      function pointer in free threading.
    - gh-134696: Built-in HACL* and OpenSSL implementations of
      hash function constructors now correctly accept the same
      documented named arguments. For instance, md5() could be
      previously invoked as md5(data=data) or md5(string=string)
      depending on the underlying implementation but these calls
      were not compatible. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-132710: If possible, ensure that uuid.getnode()
      returns the same result even across different processes.
      Previously, the result was constant only within the same
      process. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-134531: _hashlib: Rename internal C functions for
      _hashlib.HASH and _hashlib.HASHXOF objects. Patch by

      output to the HTML5 standard.
    - gh-134565: unittest.doModuleCleanups() no longer swallows
      all but first exception raised in the cleanup code, but
      raises a ExceptionGroup if multiple errors occurred.
    - gh-134546: Ensure pdb remote debugging script is readable
      by remote Python process.
    - gh-134451: Converted asyncio.tools.CycleFoundException from
      dataclass to a regular exception type.
    - gh-114177: Fix asyncio to not close subprocess pipes which

      which remains running when shutdown(wait=False), from
      attempting to adjust the pool’s worker processes after
      the object state has already been reset during shutdown.
      A combination of conditions, including a worker process
      having terminated abormally, resulted in an exception and
      a potential hang when the still-running executor thread
      attempted to replace dead workers within the pool.
    - gh-132876: ldexp() on Windows doesn’t round subnormal
      results before Windows 11, but should. Python’s
      math.ldexp() wrapper now does round them, so results may
      change slightly, in rare cases of very small results, on
      Windows versions before 11.

    - gh-91349: Adjust default compressionlevel= to 6 (down from
      9) in gzip and tarfile. It is the default level used by
      most compression tools and a better tradeoff between speed
      and performance.
    - gh-131146: Fix calendar.TextCalendar,
      calendar.HTMLCalendar, and the calendar CLI
      to display month names in the nominative case
      by adding calendar.standalone_month_name and
      calendar.standalone_month_abbr, which provide month names
      and abbreviations in the grammatical form used when a month
      name stands by itself, if the locale supports it.
    - gh-123471: Make concurrent iterations over itertools.cycle
      safe under free-threading.
    - gh-130664: Handle corner-case for Fraction’s formatting:
      treat zero-padding (preceding the width field by a zero
      ('0') character) as an equivalent to a fill character of
      '0' with an alignment type of '=', just as in case of
      float’s.
    - gh-130999: Avoid exiting the new REPL and offer suggestions
      even if there are non-string candidates when errors occur.
    - gh-88473: Implement a fast path for datetime.date objects
      in datetime.date.today() which results in a 5x performance

      performance.
    - gh-126883: Add check that timezone fields are in
      range for datetime.datetime.fromisoformat() and
      datetime.time.fromisoformat(). Patch by Semyon Moroz.

      keyword arguments are used.
    - gh-124033: SimplePath is now presented in

      multiprocessing.popen_spawn_posix that can happen when the
      child proc dies early by closing the child fds right away.
    - gh-105497: Fix flag mask inversion when unnamed flags
      exist.
    - gh-99813: ssl now uses SSL_sendfile internally when it is
      possible (see OP_ENABLE_KTLS). The function sends a file
      more efficiently because it performs TLS encryption in the
      kernel to avoid additional context switches. Patch by Illia
      Volochii.
    - gh-62824: Fix aliases for iso8859_8 encoding. Patch by Dave
      Goncalves.

      made RFC compliant.
    - gh-93334: Reraise KeyError as ModuleNotFoundError when
      importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec() is called on a
      submodule without importing the parent (and without a path
      argument).

      character entities in attribute values if they are followed
      by an ASCII alphanumeric or an equals sign.

      data files on Windows
    - bpo-43429: The size() method of the mmap.mmap class now
      returns the size of an anonymous mapping on both Unix and

      Detect decoding error in comments for default (UTF-8)
      encoding. Show the line and position of decoding error for
      default encoding in a traceback. Show the line containing

      Patch by Adam Hartz.
    - gh-37817: Allow assignment to __bases__ of direct
      subclasses of builtin classes.
    - gh-132732: Optimize _COMPARE_OP, _CONTAINS_OP,
      _UNARY_NEGATIVE, _UNARY_NOT, and _UNARY_INVERT
      in JIT builds with constant-loading uops
      (_POP_TWO_LOAD_CONST_INLINE_BORROW and
      _POP_TOP_LOAD_CONST_INLINE_BORROW), and then remove both to
      reduce instruction count.
    - gh-137400: Fix a crash in the free threading
      build when disabling profiling or tracing across
      all threads with PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads()
      or PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads() or their Python
      equivalents threading.settrace_all_threads() and
      threading.setprofile_all_threads().
    - gh-133143: Add sys.abi_info object to make ABI information
      more easily accessible.
    - gh-137400: Fix a crash in the free threading
      build when disabling profiling or tracing across
      all threads with PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads()
      or PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads() or their Python
      equivalents threading.settrace_all_threads() and
      threading.setprofile_all_threads().
    - gh-120037: Disable user site packages directory when a
      ._pth file is used, even if it contains import site.
    - gh-58124: Fix name of the Python encoding in Unicode errors
      of the code page codec: use “cp65000” and “cp65001” instead
      of “CP_UTF7” and “CP_UTF8” which are not valid Python code
      names. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-136966: The object.__dict__ and __weakref__ descriptors
      now use a single descriptor instance per interpreter,
      shared across all types that need them. This speeds up
      class creation, and helps avoid reference cycles.
    - gh-137314: Fixed a regression where raw f-strings
      incorrectly interpreted escape sequences in format
      specifications. Raw f-strings now properly preserve literal
      backslashes in format specs, matching the behavior from
      Python 3.11. For example, rf"{obj:\xFF}" now correctly
      produces '\\xFF' instead of 'ÿ'. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-137308: A standalone docstring in a node body is
      optimized as a pass statement to ensure that the node’s
      body is never empty. There was a ValueError in compile()
      otherwise.
    - gh-137288: Fix bug where some bytecode instructions of a
      boolean expression are not associated with the correct
      exception handler.
    - gh-137291: The perf profiler can now be used if a previous
      frame evaluation API has been provided.
    - gh-134291: Remove some newer macOS API usage from the JIT
      compiler in order to restore compatibility with older OSX
      10.15 deployment targets.
    - gh-88886: The codecs lookup function now again performs
      only minimal normalization of the encoding name before
      passing it to the search functions: all ASCII letters are
      converted to lower case, spaces are replaced with hyphens.
      This restores the pre-Python 3.9 behavior.
    - gh-131338: Disable computed stack limit checks on non-glibc
      linux platforms to fix crashes on deep recursion.
    - gh-136870: Fix data races while de-instrumenting bytecode
      of code objects running concurrently in threads.
    - gh-132732: Optimize constant comparison for
      _COMPARE_OP_INT, _COMPARE_OP_FLOAT and _COMPARE_OP_STR in
      JIT builds
    - gh-127598: Improve ModuleNotFoundError by adding flavour
      text to the exception when the -S option is passed. Patch
      by Andrea Mattei.
    - gh-136801: Fix PyREPL syntax highlighting on match cases
      after multi-line case. Contributed by Olga Matoula.
    - gh-74185: The __repr__() of ImportError and
      ModuleNotFoundError now shows “name” and “path” as
      name=<name> and path=<path> if they were given as keyword
      arguments at construction time. Patch by Serhiy Storchaka,
      Oleg Iarygin, and Yoav Nir
    - gh-116738: Make functions in syslog thread-safe on the free
      threaded build.
    - gh-116738: Make functions in pwd thread-safe on the free
      threaded build.
    - gh-136616: Improve SyntaxError error messages for invalid
      assert usages.
    - gh-136599: Improve performance of int hash calculations.
    - gh-136421: Fix crash when initializing datetime
      concurrently.
    - gh-136541: Fix some issues with the perf trampolines
      on x86-64 and aarch64. The trampolines were not being
      generated correctly for some cases, which could lead to
      the perf integration not working correctly. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo.
    - gh-107545: Improve the error messages that may be raised by
      setsockopt().
    - gh-136517: Fixed a typo that prevented printing of
      uncollectable objects when the gc.DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE mode
      was set.
    - gh-136525: Fix issue where per-thread bytecode was not
      instrumented for newly created threads.
    - gh-132657: Improve performance of frozenset by removing
      locks in the free-threading build.
    - gh-136459: Add support for perf trampoline on macOS, to
      allow profilers wit JIT map support to read Python calls.
      While profiling, PYTHONPERFSUPPORT=1 can be appended to
      enable the trampoline.
    - gh-132661: Interpolation.expression now has a default, the
      empty string.
    - gh-132661: Reflect recent PEP 750 change.
    - Disallow concatenation of string.templatelib.Template and
      str. Also, disallow implicit concatenation of t-string
      literals with string or f-string literals.
    - gh-91636: While performing garbage collection, clear
      weakrefs to unreachable objects that are created during
      running of finalizers. If those weakrefs were are not
      cleared, they could reveal unreachable objects.
    - gh-136355: Deprecate -b and -bb command line options and
      schedule them to become no-op in Python 3.17.
    - gh-109700: Fix memory error handling in
      PyDict_SetDefault().
    - gh-135552: Fix a bug caused by the garbage collector
      clearing weakrefs too early. The weakrefs in the
      tp_subclasses dictionary are needed in order to
      correctly invalidate type caches (for example, by
      calling PyType_Modified()). Clearing weakrefs before
      calling finalizers causes the caches to not be correctly
      invalidated. That can cause crashes since the caches can
      refer to invalid objects. Defer the clearing of weakrefs
      without callbacks until after finalizers are executed.
    - gh-136203: Improve TypeError error message, when
      richcomparing two types.MappingProxyType objects.
    - gh-136003: Fix threading.Thread objects becoming
      incorrectly daemon when created from an atexit callback or
      a pending call (Py_AddPendingCall()).
    - gh-78465: Fix error message for cls.__new__(cls, ...) where
      cls is not instantiable builtin or extension type (with
      tp_new set to NULL).
    - gh-135904: Perform more aggressive control-flow
      optimizations on the machine code templates emitted by the
      experimental JIT compiler.
    - gh-129958: Differentiate between t-strings and f-strings
      in syntax error for newlines in format specifiers of
      single-quoted interpolated strings.
    - gh-135871: Non-blocking mutex lock attempts now return
      immediately when the lock is busy instead of briefly
      spinning in the free threading build.
    - gh-134584: Specialize POP_TOP in the JIT compiler by
      specializing for reference lifetime and type. This will
      also enable easier top of stack caching in the JIT
      compiler.
    - gh-135106: Restrict the trashcan mechanism to GC’ed objects
      and untrack them while in the trashcan to prevent the GC
      and trashcan mechanisms conflicting.
    - gh-135379: Changes specialization of BINARY_OP for ints to
      only specialize for “compact” ints. This streamlines the
      fast path at the cost of fewer specializations when very
      large integers are used.
    - gh-135607: Fix potential weakref races in an object’s
      destructor on the free threaded build.
    - gh-135608: Fix a crash in the JIT involving attributes of
      modules.
    - gh-82088: Improve performance of PyLongObject
      conversion functions PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow(),
      PyLong_AsSsize_t(), PyLong_AsUnsignedLong(),
      PyLong_AsSize_t(), PyLong_AsUnsignedLongMask(),
      PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLongMask(),
      PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow() for integers larger than
      2**30 up to 30%.
    - gh-135551: Sorting randomly ordered lists will often run a
      bit faster, thanks to a new scheme for picking minimum run
      lengths from Stefan Pochmann, which arranges for the merge
      tree to be as evenly balanced as is possible.
    - gh-135543: Emit sys.remote_exec audit event
      when sys.remote_exec() is called and migrate
      remote_debugger_script to cpython.remote_debugger_script.
    - gh-135496: Fix typo in the f-string conversion type error
      (“exclamanation” -> “exclamation”).
    - gh-135474: Specialize integer operations only on compact
      integers. This is a CPython internal change.
    - gh-135371: Fixed asyncio debugging tools to properly
      display internal coroutine call stacks alongside external
      task dependencies. The python -m asyncio ps and python
      -m asyncio pstree commands now show complete execution
      context. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-135422: Fix regression in SyntaxError messages after
      gh-134036.
    - gh-116738: Make functions in grp thread-safe on the free
      threaded build.
    - gh-127319: Set the allow_reuse_port class variable to False
      on the XMLRPC, logging, and HTTP servers. This matches the
      behavior in prior Python releases, which is to not allow
      port reuse.
    - gh-130077: Properly raise custom syntax errors when
      incorrect syntax containing names that are prefixes of soft
      keywords is encountered. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-131798: Optimize _CALL_LEN in the JIT when the length is
      known. Patch by Tomas Roun
    - gh-131798: Optimize _UNARY_NEGATIVE in JIT-compiled code.
    - gh-135148: Fixed a bug where f-string debug expressions
      (using =) would incorrectly strip out parts of strings
      containing escaped quotes and # characters. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo.
    - gh-131798: Optimize _UNARY_INVERT in JIT-compiled code.
    - gh-131798: Optimize away _CALL_TYPE_1 in the JIT when the
      return type is known. Patch by Tomas Roun
    - gh-133136: Limit excess memory usage in the free threading
      build when a large dictionary or list is resized and
      accessed by multiple threads.
    - gh-131798: Optimize _CHECK_METHOD_VERSION into
      _CHECK_FUNCTION_VERSION_INLINE in JIT-compiled code.

      threaded build.
    - gh-134280: Disable constant folding for ~ with a boolean
      argument. This moves the deprecation warning from compile
      time to runtime.
    - gh-134876: Add support to PEP 768 remote debugging for
      Linux kernels which don’t have CONFIG_CROSS_MEMORY_ATTACH
      configured.
    - gh-134889: Fix handling of a few opcodes that leave
      operands on the stack when optimizing LOAD_FAST.
    - gh-134908: Fix crash when iterating over lines in a text
      file on the free threaded build.
    - gh-117852: Fix argument checking of athrow().
    - gh-132617: Fix dict.update() modification check that could
      incorrectly raise a “dict mutated during update” error when
      a different dictionary was modified that happens to share
      the same underlying keys object.
    - gh-131798: Allow the JIT to remove unnecessary
      _ITER_CHECK_TUPLE ops.
    - gh-134679: Fix crash in the free threading build’s QSBR
      code that could occur when changing an object’s __dict__
      attribute.

      to handle extension classes with inline values.
    - gh-131798: Make the JIT optimizer understand that slicing a
      string/list/tuple returns the same type.
    - gh-134584: Add a reference count elimination pass to the
      JIT compiler. Patch by Ken Jin.
    - gh-131798: Optimize _POP_CALL_TWO_LOAD_CONST_INLINE_BORROW.
    - gh-134381: Fix RuntimeError when using a not-started
      threading.Thread after calling os.fork()
    - gh-127960: PyREPL interactive shell no longer starts with
      __package__ and __file__ global names set to _pyrepl
      package internals. Contributed by Yuichiro Tachibana.
    - gh-130397: Remove special-casing for C stack depth limits
      for WASI. Due to WebAssembly’s built-in stack protection
      this does not pose a security concern.
    - gh-131798: JIT: replace _LOAD_SMALL_INT with
      _LOAD_CONST_INLINE_BORROW
    - gh-131798: Improve the JIT’s ability to optimize away
      cached class attribute and method loads.

      an error when Python is invoked on a read only filesystem
      while trying to write history file entries.
    - gh-131798: Improve the JIT’s ability to narrow unknown
      classes to constant values.
    - gh-134268: Add _POP_CALL_TWO_LOAD_CONST_INLINE_BORROW and
      use it to further optimize CALL_ISINSTANCE.
    - gh-131798: Split CALL_LIST_APPEND into several uops. Patch
      by Diego Russo.
    - gh-69605: When auto-completing an import in the REPL,
      finding no candidates now issues no suggestion, rather than
      suggestions from the current namespace.
    - gh-134170: Add colorization to sys.unraisablehook() by
      default.
    - gh-91153: Fix a crash when a bytearray is concurrently
      mutated during item assignment.
    - gh-134158: Fix coloring of double braces in f-strings and
      t-strings in the REPL.
    - gh-134119: Fix crash when calling next() on an exhausted
      template string iterator. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-134100: Fix a use-after-free bug that occurs when an
      imported module isn’t in sys.modules after its initial
      import. Patch by Nico-Posada.
    - gh-134036: Improve SyntaxError message when using invalid
      raise statements.
    - gh-133999: Fix SyntaxError regression in except parsing
      after gh-123440.
    - gh-133886: Fix sys.remote_exec() for non-ASCII paths in
      non-UTF-8 locales and non-UTF-8 paths in UTF-8 locales.
    - gh-133400: Fixed Ctrl+D (^D) behavior in _pyrepl module to
      match old pre-3.13 REPL behavior.
    - gh-133703: Fix hashtable in dict can be bigger than
      intended in some situations.
    - gh-133778: Fix bug where assigning to the __annotations__
      attributes of classes defined under from __future__ import
      annotations had no effect.
    - gh-133711: Implement PEP 686: Enable Python UTF-8 Mode by
      default. Patch by Adam Turner.
    - gh-132762: fromkeys() no longer loops forever when adding
      a small set of keys to a large base dict. Patch by Angela
      Liss.
    - gh-133541: Inconsistent indentation in user input crashed
      the new REPL when syntax highlighting was active. This is
      now fixed.
    - gh-133516: Raise ValueError when constants True, False or
      None are used as an identifier after NFKC normalization.
    - gh-131798: Allow the JIT to remove int guards after
      _GET_LEN by setting the return type to int.
    - gh-131798: Split CALL_ISINSTANCE into several uops,
      allowing the JIT to remove some of them.
    - gh-132554: Change iteration to use “virtual iterators”
      for sequences. Instead of creating an iterator, a tagged
      integer representing the next index is pushed to the stack
      above the iterable. For non-sequence iterators, NULL is
      pushed.
    - gh-130821: Enhance wrong type error messages and make them
      more consistent. Patch by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-131798: Narrow the return type and constant-evaluate
      CALL_ISINSTANCE for a subset of known values in the JIT.
      Patch by Tomas Roun

      in string search.
    - gh-132042: Improve class creation times by up to 12%
      by pre-computing type slots just once. Patch by Sergey
      Miryanov.
    - gh-133379: Correct usage of arguments in error messages.
    - gh-127266: In the free-threaded build, avoid data races
      caused by updating type slots or type flags after the type
      was initially created. For those (typically rare) cases,
      use the stop-the-world mechanism. Remove the use of atomics
      when reading or writing type flags. The use of atomics is
      not sufficient to avoid races (since flags are sometimes
      read without a lock and without atomics) and are no longer
      required.
    - gh-130425: Add "Did you mean: 'attr'?" suggestion when
      using del obj.attr if attr does not exist.
    - gh-128640: Fix a crash when using threads inside of a
      subinterpreter.

      PyFunction_PYFUNC_EVENT_MODIFY_QUALNAME event when a
      watched functions qualname is changed.
    - gh-111489: Add PyTuple_FromArray() to create a tuple from
      an array. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-136355: Deprecate PyConfig.bytes_warning field and
      schedule its removal in 3.17.
    - gh-138886: Remove deprecated PySys_ResetWarnOptions() C-API
      function.
    - gh-129813: Implement PEP 782, the PyBytesWriter API. Add
      functions:
         PyBytesWriter_Create()
         PyBytesWriter_Discard()
         PyBytesWriter_FinishWithPointer()
         PyBytesWriter_FinishWithSize()
         PyBytesWriter_Finish()
         PyBytesWriter_Format()
         PyBytesWriter_GetData()
         PyBytesWriter_GetSize()
         PyBytesWriter_GrowAndUpdatePointer()
         PyBytesWriter_Grow()
         PyBytesWriter_Resize()
         PyBytesWriter_WriteBytes()
    - Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-137956: Display and raise an exception if an extension
      compiled for non-free-threaded Python is loaded in a
      free-threaded interpreter.
    - gh-137573: Mark _PyOptimizer_Optimize as Py_NO_INLINE to
      prevent stack overflow crashes on macOS.
    - gh-128813: Functions _Py_c_sum(), _Py_c_diff(),
      _Py_c_neg(), _Py_c_prod(), _Py_c_quot(), _Py_c_pow() and
      previously undocumented _Py_c_abs() are soft deprecated.
      Deprecate also cval field of the PyComplexObject type.
      Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-137210: Add API for checking an extension module’s ABI
      compatibility: Py_mod_abi, PyABIInfo_Check(), PyABIInfo_VAR
      and Py_mod_abi.
    - gh-136759: Rename lock.h to pylock.h to avoid potential
      include conflicts.
    - gh-112068: Revert support of nullable arguments in
      PyArg_Parse().
    - gh-136006: On Solaris, the Py_NAN macro now expands to a
      double instead of a function address. Patch by Bénédikt
      Tran.
    - gh-135075: Make PyObject_SetAttr() and
      PyObject_SetAttrString() fail if called with NULL value and
      an exception set. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-135906: Fix compilation errors when compiling the
      internal headers with a C++ compiler.

      accept one or two PyMutex pointers rather than PyObject
      instances are now public in the non-limited C API.
    - gh-133157: Remove the private, undocumented macro
      _Py_NO_SANITIZE_UNDEFINED.
    - gh-134989: Fix Py_RETURN_NONE, Py_RETURN_TRUE and
      Py_RETURN_FALSE macros in the limited C API 3.11 and older:
      don’t treat Py_None, Py_True and Py_False as immortal.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-134989: Implement PyObject_DelAttr() and
      PyObject_DelAttrString() as macros in the limited C API
      3.12 and older. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-134745: Change PyThread_allocate_lock() implementation
      to PyMutex. On Windows, PyThread_acquire_lock_timed() now
      supports the intr_flag parameter: it can be interrupted.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-134891: Add PyUnstable_Unicode_GET_CACHED_HASH to get
      the cached hash of a string.
    - gh-134009: Expose PyMutex_IsLocked() as part of the public

      with a thread state that isn’t the initial thread for the
      interpreter.
    - gh-133968: Add PyUnicodeWriter_WriteASCII() function to
      write an ASCII string into a PyUnicodeWriter. The function
      is faster than PyUnicodeWriter_WriteUTF8(), but has an
      undefined behavior if the input string contains non-ASCII
      characters. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-133644: Remove deprecated Python initialization getter
      functions Py_Get*. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-133644: Remove deprecated function PyWeakref_GetObject()

      PyUnicode_AsDecodedObject(), PyUnicode_AsDecodedUnicode(),
      PyUnicode_AsEncodedObject(), and
      PyUnicode_AsEncodedUnicode().
    - gh-132629: For unsigned integer formats in
      PyArg_ParseTuple(), accepting Python integers with value
      that is larger than the maximal value for the C type or

      or build_emscripten, the build-details.json step is now
      included in the build process, just like with native
      builds.
    - This fixes the libinstall task which requires the
      build-details.json file during the process.
    - gh-138497: The LLVM version used by the JIT at build time
      can now be modified using the LLVM_VERSION environment
      variable. Use this at your own risk, as there is only one
      officially supported LLVM version. For more information,
      please check Tools/jit/README.md.
    - gh-95952: When cross-compiling for WASI, require that the
      HOSTRUNNER environment variable be explicitly set.
    - This was needed as macOS lacks the appropriate CLI tools to
      set a reasonable default.
    - gh-138061: Ensure reproducible builds by making JIT stencil
      header generation deterministic.
    - gh-128042: ./configure now warns when
      --enable-optimizations and CFLAGS=-O0 are both set,
      suggesting removing -O0 from CFLAGS for optimal
      performance. Patch by Taegyun Kim.
    - gh-132339: Add support for OpenSSL 3.5.
    - gh-135621: PyREPL no longer depends on the curses standard

      configure.ac script.
    - gh-134923: Windows builds with profile-guided optimization
      enabled now use /GENPROFILE and /USEPROFILE instead of
      deprecated /LTCG: options.
    - gh-134632: Fixed build-details.json generation to use
      INCLUDEPY, in order to reference the pythonX.Y subdirectory
      of the include directory, as required in PEP 739, instead
      of the top-level include directory.
    - gh-134486: The ctypes module now performs a more portable
      test for the definition of alloca(3), fixing a compilation
      failure on NetBSD.
    - gh-134455: Fixed build-details.json generation to use the
      correct c_api.headers as defined in PEP 739, instead of

      the JIT with CFLAGS_JIT
    - gh-115119: Removed implicit fallback to the bundled

      cross-build is a pydebug build.
    - gh-117088: AIX linker don’t support -h option, so avoid it
      through platform check
    - gh-123681: Check the strftime() behavior at runtime instead
      of at the compile time to support cross-compiling. Remove
      the internal macro _Py_NORMALIZE_CENTURY.
    - gh-127545: Fix crash when building on Linux/m68k.
- New subpackage profiling

      resolving some issues that have been observed using
      the runner in GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines test
      environments.
  - Security
    - gh-135661: Fix CDATA section parsing in
      html.parser.HTMLParser according to the HTML5 standard: ]
      ]> and ]] > no longer end the CDATA section. Add private
      method _set_support_cdata() which can be used to specify
      how to parse <[CDATA[ — as a CDATA section in foreign
      content (SVG or MathML) or as a bogus comment in the HTML
      namespace.
  - Library
    - gh-138998: Update bundled libexpat to 2.7.2
    - gh-118803: Add back collections.abc.ByteString and
      typing.ByteString. Both had been removed in prior alpha,
      beta and release candidates for Python 3.14, but their
      removal has now been postponed to Python 3.17.
    - gh-137226: Fix typing.get_type_hints() calls on generic
      typing.TypedDict classes defined with string annotations.
    - gh-138804: Raise TypeError instead of AttributeError when
      an argument of incorrect type is passed to shlex.quote().
      This restores the behavior of the function prior to 3.14.
    - gh-128636: Fix crash in PyREPL when os.environ is
      overwritten with an invalid value for mac
    - gh-138514: Raise ValueError when a multi-character string

      Alpine Linux if compiled with –strip-all.
    - gh-136134: SMTP.auth_cram_md5() now raises an SMTPException
      instead of a ValueError if Python has been built without
      MD5 support. In particular, SMTP clients will not attempt
      to use this method even if the remote server is assumed to
      support it. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-136134: IMAP4.login_cram_md5 now raises an IMAP4.error
      if CRAM-MD5 authentication is not supported. Patch by

      subscript expressions involving template string literals.
      Patch by Brian Schubert.
    - gh-138318: The default REPL now avoids highlighting
      built-in names (for instance set or format()) when they
      are used as attribute names (for instance in value.set or
      text.format).
    - gh-138349: Fix crash in certain cases where a module
      contains both a module-level annotation and a
      comprehension.
    - gh-137384: Fix a crash when using the warnings module in a
      finalizer at shutdown. Patch by Kumar Aditya.

Fri Aug 15 14:12:35 UTC 2025 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 3.14.0~rc2:
  - Library
    - gh-137426: Remove the code deprecation of
      importlib.abc.ResourceLoader. It is documented as
      deprecated, but left for backwards compatibility with other
      classes in importlib.abc.
    - gh-137282: Fix tab completion and dir() on
      concurrent.futures.
    - gh-137257: Bump the version of pip bundled in ensurepip to
      version 25.2
    - gh-137226: Fix behavior of
      annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate() when the type_params
      parameter is passed and the name of a type param is also
      present in an enclosing scope.
    - gh-130522: Fix unraisable TypeError raised during
      interpreter shutdown in the threading module.
    - gh-137059: Fix handling of file URLs with a
      Windows drive letter in the URL authority by
      urllib.request.url2pathname(). This fixes a regression in
      earlier pre-releases of Python 3.14.
    - gh-130577: tarfile now validates archives to ensure member
      offsets are non-negative. (Contributed by Alexander Enrique
      Urieles Nieto in gh-130577; CVE-2025-8194, bsc#1247249).
    - gh-135228: When dataclasses replaces a class with a slotted
      dataclass, the original class can now be garbage collected
      again. Earlier changes in Python 3.14 caused this class to
      always remain in existence together with the replacement
      class synthesized by dataclasses.
  - Documentation
    - gh-136155: We are now checking for fatal errors in EPUB
      builds in CI.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-137400: Fix a crash in the free threading
      build when disabling profiling or tracing across
      all threads with PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads()
      or PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads() or their Python
      equivalents threading.settrace_all_threads() and
      threading.setprofile_all_threads().
    - gh-137314: Fixed a regression where raw f-strings
      incorrectly interpreted escape sequences in format
      specifications. Raw f-strings now properly preserve literal
      backslashes in format specs, matching the behavior from
      Python 3.11. For example, rf"{obj:\xFF}" now correctly
      produces '\\xFF' instead of 'ÿ'. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-137308: A standalone docstring in a node body is
      optimized as a pass statement to ensure that the node’s
      body is never empty. There was a ValueError in compile()
      otherwise.
    - gh-137288: Fix bug where some bytecode instructions of a
      boolean expression are not associated with the correct
      exception handler.
    - gh-134291: Remove some newer macOS API usage from the JIT
      compiler in order to restore compatibility with older OSX
      10.15 deployment targets.
    - gh-131338: Disable computed stack limit checks on non-glibc
      linux platforms to fix crashes on deep recursion.
    - gh-136870: Fix data races while de-instrumenting bytecode
      of code objects running concurrently in threads.
  - C API
    - gh-137573: Mark _PyOptimizer_Optimize as Py_NO_INLINE to
      prevent stack overflow crashes on macOS.
  - Build
    - gh-132339: Add support for OpenSSL 3.5.
- Replaces upstreamed patches:
  - CVE-2025-8194-tarfile-no-neg-offsets.patch

    - gh-135968: Stubs for strip are now provided as part of an
      iOS install.
    - gh-133600: Backport file reorganization for Tools/wasm/wasi

  - Security
    - gh-136053: marshal: fix a possible crash when deserializing
      slice objects.
    - gh-135661: Fix parsing start and end tags in
      html.parser.HTMLParser according to the HTML5 standard.
      - Whitespaces no longer accepted between </ and the tag
        name. E.g. </ script> does not end the script section.
      - Vertical tabulation (\v) and non-ASCII whitespaces no
        longer recognized as whitespaces. The only whitespaces
        are \t\n\r\f and space.
      - Null character (U+0000) no longer ends the tag name.
      - Attributes and slashes after the tag name in end tags are
        now ignored, instead of terminating after the first > in
        quoted attribute value. E.g. </script/foo=">"/>.
      - Multiple slashes and whitespaces between the last
        attribute and closing > are now ignored in both start and
        end tags. E.g. <a foo=bar/ //>.
      - Multiple = between attribute name and value are no longer
        collapsed. E.g. <a foo==bar> produces attribute “foo”
        with value “=bar”.
      - Whitespaces between the = separator and attribute name or
        value are no longer ignored. E.g. <a foo =bar> produces
        two attributes “foo” and “=bar”, both with value None; <a
        foo= bar> produces two attributes: “foo” with value “”
        and “bar” with value None.
    - gh-102555: Fix comment parsing in html.parser.HTMLParser

    - gh-91555: An earlier change, which was introduced in
      3.14.0b2, has been reverted. It disabled logging for
      a logger during handling of log messages for that
      logger. Since the reversion, the behaviour should be as it
      was before 3.14.0b2.
    - gh-135878: Fixes a crash of types.SimpleNamespace on free
      threading builds, when several threads were calling its
      __repr__() method at the same time.

    - gh-135640: Address bug where it was possible to call
      xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree.write() on an ElementTree
      object with an invalid root element. This behavior blanked
      the file passed to write if it already existed.
    - gh-135645: Added supports_isolated_interpreters field to
      sys.implementation.
    - gh-135646: Raise consistent NameError exceptions in

      width fields for Fraction formatting, for example
      format(Fraction(1, 3), '.016f').
    - gh-87790: Support underscore and comma as thousands
      separators in the fractional part for Fraction’s
      formatting. Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-87790: Support underscore and comma as thousands
      separators in the fractional part for Decimal’s
      formatting. Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-130664: Handle corner-case for Fraction’s formatting:
      treat zero-padding (preceding the width field by a zero
      ('0') character) as an equivalent to a fill character of
      '0' with an alignment type of '=', just as in case of
      float’s.

      immediately when the lock is busy instead of briefly
      spinning in the free threading build.
    - gh-135106: Restrict the trashcan mechanism to GC’ed objects
      and untrack them while in the trashcan to prevent the GC

      crafted input in html.parser.HTMLParser. End-of-file errors
      are now handled according to the HTML5 specs – comments and
      declarations are automatically closed, tags are ignored
      (bsc#1244705, CVE-2025-6069).
    - gh-135034: Fixes multiple issues that allowed tarfile
      extraction filters (filter="data" and filter="tar") to be
      bypassed using crafted symlinks and hard links.  Addresses
      CVE 2024-12718, CVE 2025-4138, CVE 2025-4330, and CVE
      2025-4517. Also addresses CVE-2025-4435 (gh#135034,

      are set as it was before gh-124429.
    - gh-133967: Do not normalize locale name ‘C.UTF-8’ to
      ‘en_US.UTF-8’.

      zipp 3.23. Fixed .name, .stem and other basename-based
      properties on Windows when working with a zipfile on disk.
    - gh-135244: uuid: when the MAC address cannot be
      determined, the 48-bit node ID is now generated with a
      cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator
      (CSPRNG) as per RFC 9562, §6.10.3. This affects uuid1() and
      uuid6().
    - gh-134970: Fix the “unknown action” exception in
      argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group() to correctly
      replace the action class.

      module related to setting parameter types. Patch by Jelle
      Zijlstra.

      IPv4 address.
    - gh-134637: Fix performance regression in calling a ctypes
      function pointer in free threading.
    - gh-134696: Built-in HACL* and OpenSSL implementations of
      hash function constructors now correctly accept the same
      documented named arguments. For instance, md5() could be
      previously invoked as md5(data=data) or md5(string=string)
      depending on the underlying implementation but these calls
      were not compatible. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-134151: email: Fix TypeError in
      email.utils.decode_params() when sorting RFC 2231

      MiB.
    - gh-132813: Improve error messages for incorrect types and
      values of csv.Dialect attributes.
    - gh-132969: Prevent the ProcessPoolExecutor executor thread,
      which remains running when shutdown(wait=False), from
      attempting to adjust the pool’s worker processes after the
      object state has already been reset during shutdown. A
      combination of conditions, including a worker process
      having terminated abormally, resulted in an exception and
      a potential hang when the still-running executor thread
      attempted to replace dead workers within the pool.
    - gh-127081: Fix libc thread safety issues with os by
      replacing getlogin with getlogin_r re-entrant version.
    - gh-131884: Fix formatting issues in json.dump() when both
      indent and skipkeys are used.
    - gh-130999: Avoid exiting the new REPL and offer suggestions
      even if there are non-string candidates when errors occur.

      clause in the generator expression is created immediately.
    - bpo-45210: Document that error indicator may be set in
      tp_dealloc, and how to avoid clobbering it.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-135496: Fix typo in the f-string conversion type error
      (“exclamanation” -> “exclamation”).
    - gh-135371: Fixed asyncio debugging tools to properly
      display internal coroutine call stacks alongside external
      task dependencies. The python -m asyncio ps and python
      -m asyncio pstree commands now show complete execution
      context. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-127319: Set the allow_reuse_port class variable to False
      on the XMLRPC, logging, and HTTP servers. This matches the
      behavior in prior Python releases, which is to not allow
      port reuse.
    - gh-135171: Reverts the behavior of async generator
      expressions when created with object w/o __aiter__ method
      to the pre-3.13 behavior of raising a TypeError.
    - gh-130077: Properly raise custom syntax errors when
      incorrect syntax containing names that are prefixes of soft
      keywords is encountered. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-135171: Reverts the behavior of generator expressions
      when created with a non-iterable to the pre-3.13 behavior
      of raising a TypeError. It is no longer possible to
      cause a crash in the debugger by altering the generator
      expression’s local variables. This is achieved by moving
      the GET_ITER instruction back to the creation of the
      generator expression and adding an additional check to
      FOR_ITER.
    - gh-116738: Make methods in heapq thread-safe on the free
      threaded build.
    - gh-134876: Add support to PEP 768 remote debugging for

      operands on the stack when optimizing LOAD_FAST.
    - gh-134908: Fix crash when iterating over lines in a text
      file on the free threaded build.
    - gh-132617: Fix dict.update() modification check that could
      incorrectly raise a “dict mutated during update” error when
      a different dictionary was modified that happens to share
      the same underlying keys object.
    - gh-134679: Fix crash in the free threading build’s QSBR
      code that could occur when changing an object’s __dict__
      attribute.
    - gh-127682: No longer call __iter__ twice in list
      comprehensions. This brings the behavior of list
      comprehensions in line with other forms of iteration
    - gh-133912: Fix the C API function PyObject_GenericSetDict
      to handle extension classes with inline values.
  - C API
    - gh-134989: Fix Py_RETURN_NONE, Py_RETURN_TRUE and
      Py_RETURN_FALSE macros in the limited C API 3.11 and
      older: don’t treat Py_None, Py_True and Py_False as
      immortal. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-134989: Implement PyObject_DelAttr() and
      PyObject_DelAttrString() as macros in the limited C API
      3.12 and older. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-133968: Add PyUnicodeWriter_WriteASCII() function to
      write an ASCII string into a PyUnicodeWriter. The function
      is faster than PyUnicodeWriter_WriteUTF8(), but has an
      undefined behavior if the input string contains non-ASCII
      characters. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Build
    - gh-119132: Remove “experimental” tag from the CPython
      free-threading build.
    - gh-135497: Fix the detection of MAXLOGNAME in the
      configure.ac script.
    - gh-134923: Windows builds with profile-guided optimization
      enabled now use /GENPROFILE and /USEPROFILE instead of
      deprecated /LTCG: options.
    - gh-134774: Fix Py_DEBUG macro redefinition warnings on
      Windows debug builds. Patch by Chris Eibl.
    - gh-134632: Fixed build-details.json generation to use
      INCLUDEPY, in order to reference the pythonX.Y subdirectory
      of the include directory, as required in PEP 739, instead
      of the top-level include directory.

    - gh-134209: curses: The curses.window.instr() and
      curses.window.getstr() methods now allocate their internal
      buffer on the heap instead of the stack; in addition, the
      max buffer size is increased from 1023 to 2047.

      decoded path component of the requested URL, and not the
      query and fragment.
    - gh-134098: Fix handling paths that end with
      a percent-encoded slash (%2f or %2F) in
      http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.
    - gh-132124: On POSIX-compliant systems,
      multiprocessing.util.get_temp_dir() now ignores TMPDIR
      (and similar environment variables) if the path length of
      AF_UNIX socket files exceeds the platform-specific maximum

      to match the C implementation.
    - gh-133960: Simplify and improve
      typing.evaluate_forward_ref(). It now no longer raises
      errors on certain invalid types. In several situations,

      previously unsupported.
    - gh-133925: Make the private class typing._UnionGenericAlias
      hashable.
    - gh-133653: Fix argparse.ArgumentParser with the

      mistaken for multi-line SQL statements in the sqlite3
      command-line interface.
    - gh-132493: Avoid accessing __annotations__ unnecessarily in
      inspect.signature().
    - gh-132876: ldexp() on Windows doesn’t round subnormal
      results before Windows 11, but should. Python’s
      math.ldexp() wrapper now does round them, so results may
      change slightly, in rare cases of very small results, on
      Windows versions before 11.
    - gh-133009: xml.etree.ElementTree: Fix a crash in
      Element.__deepcopy__ when the element is concurrently

- Update to 3.14.0~b1:
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-130453: Allow passing multiple keyword arguments with
      the same function name in pygettext.
    - gh-130195: Add warning messages when pygettext
      unimplemented -a/--extract-all option is called.
  - Tests
    - gh-133131: The iOS testbed will now select the most
      recently released “SE-class” device for testing if a device
      isn’t explicitly specified.
    - gh-91048: Add ability to externally inspect all pending
      asyncio tasks, even if no task is currently entered on the
      event loop.
    - gh-109981: The test helper that counts the list of open
      file descriptors now uses the optimised /dev/fd approach on
      all Apple platforms, not just macOS. This avoids crashes
      caused by guarded file descriptors.
    - gh-132678: Add --prioritize to -m test. This option allows
      the user to specify which selected tests should execute
      first, even if the order is otherwise randomized. This is
      particularly useful for tests that run the longest.
    - gh-131290: Tests in Lib/test can now be correctly executed
      as standalone scripts.
  - Security
    - gh-115322: The underlying extension modules behind
      readline:, subprocess, and ctypes now raise audit events
      on previously uncovered code paths that could lead to file
      system access related to C function calling and external
      binary execution. The ctypes.call_function audit hook has
      also been fixed to use an unsigned value for its function
      pointer.
  - Library
    - gh-133490: Add color support to PDB in remote mode.
    - gh-132493: Avoid eagerly evaluating annotations in

      completions for Python expressions from the server when
      completing a continuation line of a multi-line Python
      block.
    - gh-133367: Add the --feature-version, --optimize,
      and --show-empty options to the ast command-line
      interface. Patch by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-133363: The cmd.Cmd class has been fixed to reliably
      call the completedefault method whenever the do_shell
      method is not defined and tab completion is requested for a
      line beginning with !.
    - gh-113081: Highlight syntax on source code in pdb.
    - gh-133349: Introduced auto-indent in pdb multi-line input.
    - gh-133306: Use \z instead of \Z in fnmatch.translate() and
      glob.translate().
    - gh-133306: Support \z as a synonym for \Z in regular
      expressions.
    - gh-133300: Make argparse.ArgumentParser’s suggest_on_error
      a keyword-only parameter. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-133290: Fix attribute caching issue when setting
      ctypes._Pointer._type_ in the undocumented and deprecated
      ctypes.SetPointerType() function and the undocumented
      set_type() method.
    - gh-133223: When PDB is attached to a remote process, do a
      better job of intercepting Ctrl+C and forwarding it to the
      remote process.
    - gh-133153: Do not complete pdb commands in interact mode of
      pdb.
    - gh-133139: Add the curses.assume_default_colors() function,
      a refinement of the curses.use_default_colors() function
      which allows to change the color pair 0.
    - gh-133089: Use original timeout value for
      subprocess.TimeoutExpired when the func subprocess.run()
      is called with a timeout instead of sometimes a confusing
      partial remaining time out value used internally on the
      final wait().
    - gh-133036: codecs.open() is now deprecated. Use open()
      instead. Contributed by Inada Naoki.
    - gh-132987: Many builtin and extension functions which
      accept an unsigned integer argument, now use __index__() if
      available.
    - gh-124703: Set return code to 1 when aborting process from
      pdb.
    - gh-133005: Support passing preset option to tarfile.open()
      when using 'w|xz' mode.
    - gh-115032: Support for custom logging handlers with the
      strm argument is deprecated and scheduled for removal in
      Python 3.16. Define handlers with the stream argument
      instead. Patch by Mariusz Felisiak.
    - gh-132991: Add socket.IP_FREEBIND constant on Linux 2.4 and
      later.
    - gh-132995: Bump the version of pip bundled in ensurepip to
      version 25.1.1
    - gh-132933: The zipapp module now applies the filter when
      creating the list of files to add, rather than waiting
      until the file is being added to the archive.
    - gh-121249: Always support the float complex and double
      complex C types in the struct module. Patch by Sergey B
      Kirpichev.
    - gh-132915: fcntl.fcntl() and fcntl.ioctl() can now detect
      a buffer overflow and raise SystemError. The stack and
      memory can be corrupted in such case, so treat this error
      as fatal.
    - gh-132017: Fix error when pyrepl is suspended, then resumed
      and terminated.
    - gh-132893: Improved statistics.NormalDist.cdf() accuracy
      for inputs smaller than the mean.
    - gh-130328: Speedup pasting in PyREPL on Windows. Fix by
      Chris Eibl.

      .gz, .m4v, .php, .rar, .rpm, .stl and .wmv. Patch by Hugo
      van Kemenade.
    - gh-132742: fcntl.fcntl() now supports arbitrary bytes-like
      objects, not only bytes. fcntl.ioctl() now automatically
      retries system calls failing with EINTR and releases the
      GIL during a system call even for large bytes-like object.
    - gh-132451: The CLI for the PDB debugger now accepts a -p
      PID argument to allow attaching to a running process. The
      process must be running the same version of Python as the
      one running PDB.
    - gh-125618: Add a format parameter to
      annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate(). Evaluating annotations
      in the FORWARDREF format now succeeds in more cases that
      would previously have raised an exception.
    - gh-132805: Fix incorrect handling of nested non-constant
      values in the FORWARDREF format in annotationlib.
    - gh-132734: Add new constants for Bluetooth sockets.

      with _align_ = 0 and _fields_ = [].
    - gh-132578: Rename the threading.Thread._handle field
      to avoid shadowing methods defined on subclasses of
      threading.Thread.
    - gh-132561: Fix the public locked method of
      multiprocessing.SemLock class. Also adding 2 tests for the
      derivated multiprocessing.Lock and multiprocessing.RLock
      classes.
    - gh-121468: Add pdb.set_trace_async() function to support
      await statements in pdb.
    - gh-132493: typing.Protocol now uses
      annotationlib.get_annotations() when checking whether
      or not an instance implements the protocol with
      isinstance(). This enables support for isinstance checks
      against classes with deferred annotations.
    - gh-132536: Do not disable PY_THROW event in bdb because it
      can’t be disabled.
    - gh-132527: Include the valid typecode ‘w’ in the error
      message when an invalid typecode is passed to array.array.
    - gh-132099: The Bluetooth socket with the BTPROTO_HCI
      protocol on Linux now accepts an address in the format of
      an integer device_id, not only a tuple (device_id,).
    - gh-81793: Fix os.link() on platforms (like Linux)
      where the system link() function does not follow
      symlinks. On Linux, it now follows symlinks by default
      or if follow_symlinks=True is specified. On Windows, it
      now raises an error if follow_symlinks=True is passed. On
      macOS, it now raises an error if follow_symlinks=False is
      passed and the system linkat() function is not available at
      runtime.
    - gh-132493: Support creation of typing.Protocol classes with
      annotations that cannot be resolved at class creation time.
    - gh-132491: Rename annotationlib.value_to_string to
      annotationlib.type_repr() and provide better handling for
      function objects.
    - gh-132426: Add
      annotationlib.get_annotate_from_class_namespace() as a
      helper for accessing annotations in metaclasses, and remove
      annotationlib.get_annotate_function.
    - gh-70145: Add support for channels in Bluetooth HCI
      protocol (BTPROTO_HCI).
    - gh-131913: Add a shortcut function
      multiprocessing.Process.interrupt() alongside the
      existing multiprocessing.Process.terminate() and
      multiprocessing.Process.kill() for an improved control over
      child process termination.
    - gh-132439: Fix PyREPL on Windows: characters entered via
      AltGr are swallowed. Patch by Chris Eibl.
    - gh-132429: Fix support of Bluetooth sockets on NetBSD
      and DragonFly BSD. Add support for cid and bdaddr_type
      in the BTPROTO_L2CAP address on FreeBSD. Return cid in
      getsockname() for BTPROTO_L2CAP if it is not zero.
    - gh-132106: QueueListener.start now raises a RuntimeError if
      the listener is already started.
    - gh-132417: Fix a NULL pointer dereference when a C function
      called using ctypes with restype py_object returns NULL.
    - gh-132385: Fix instance error suggestions trigger potential
      exceptions in object.__getattr__() in traceback.
    - gh-125866: Add optional add_scheme argument to
      urllib.request.pathname2url(); when set to true, a complete
      URL is returned. Likewise add optional require_scheme
      argument to url2pathname(); when set to true, a complete
      URL is accepted.
    - gh-132308: A traceback.TracebackException now correctly
      renders the __context__ and __cause__ attributes from
      falsey Exception, and the exceptions attribute from falsey
      ExceptionGroup.
    - gh-130645: Add colour to argparse help output. Patch by
      Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-127495: In PyREPL, append a new entry to the
      PYTHON_HISTORY file after every statement. This should
      preserve command-line history after interpreter is
      terminated. Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-129463: Comparison of annotationlib.ForwardRef objects
      no longer uses the internal __code__ and __ast_node__
      attributes, which are used as caches.
    - gh-132250: Fixed the SystemError in cProfile when locating
      the actual C function of a method raises an exception.
    - gh-132064: annotationlib.get_annotations() now uses
      the __annotate__ attribute if it is present, even if
      __annotations__ is not present. Additionally, the function
      now raises a TypeError if it is passed an object that does
      not have any annotatins.
    - gh-130664: Support the '_' digit separator in formatting
      of the integral part of Decimal’s. Patch by Sergey B
      Kirpichev.
    - gh-131952: Add color output to the json CLI. Patch by Tomas
      Roun.
    - gh-132063: Prevent exceptions that evaluate as
      falsey (namely, when their __bool__ method returns
      False or their __len__ method returns 0) from being
      ignored by concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor and
      concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.
    - gh-132106: logging.handlers.QueueListener now implements
      the context manager protocol, allowing it to be used in a
      with statement.
    - gh-132054: The application/yaml mime type (RFC 9512) is now
      supported by mimetypes. Patch by Sasha “Nelie” Chernykh and
      Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-119605: Respect follow_wrapped for __init__() and
      __new__() methods when getting the class signature for a
      class with inspect.signature(). Preserve class signature
      after wrapping with warnings.deprecated(). Patch by Xuehai
      Pan.
    - gh-118761: Improve import times by up to 33x for the shlex
      module, and improve the performance of shlex.quote() by up

      time.strptime().
    - gh-131524: Add help message to platform command-line
      interface. Contributed by Harry Lees.
    - gh-100926: Move ctypes.POINTER() types cache from
      a global internal cache (_pointer_type_cache) to
      the ctypes._CData.__pointer_type__ attribute of the
      corresponding ctypes types. This will stop the cache from
      growing without limits in some situations.
    - gh-85702: If zoneinfo._common.load_tzdata is given a
      package without a resource a ZoneInfoNotFoundError is
      raised rather than a IsADirectoryError.
    - gh-123471: Make concurrent iterations over itertools.repeat
      safe under free-threading.
    - gh-131127: Systems using LibreSSL now successfully build.
    - gh-89157: Make the pure Python implementation of
      datetime.date.fromisoformat(), only accept ASCII strings
      for consistency with the C implementation.
    - gh-130941: Fix configparser.ConfigParser parsing empty
      interpolation with allow_no_value set to True.
    - gh-110067: Make heapq max-heap functions
      heapq.heapify_max(), heapq.heappush_max(),
      heapq.heappop_max(), and heapq.heapreplace_max()
      public. Previous underscored naming is kept for backwards
      compatibility. Additionally, the missing function
      heapq.heappushpop_max() has been added to both the C and
      Python implementations.
    - gh-129098: Fix REPL traceback reporting when using
      compile() with an inexisting file. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-130631: http.cookiejar.join_header_words() is now more
      similar to the original Perl version. It now quotes the
      same set of characters and always quote values that end
      with "\n".
    - gh-130482: Add ability to specify name for
      tkinter.OptionMenu and tkinter.ttk.OptionMenu.
    - gh-77065: Add keyword-only optional argument echo_char for
      getpass.getpass() for optional visual keyboard feedback
      support. Patch by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-130317: Fix PyFloat_Pack2() and PyFloat_Unpack2()
      for NaN’s with payload. This corrects round-trip for

      754 binary16 “half precision” type. Patch by Sergey B
      Kirpichev.
    - gh-130402: Joining running daemon threads during
      interpreter shutdown now raises PythonFinalizationError.
    - gh-130167: Improve speed of difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK(). Patch
      by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-101410: Added more detailed messages for domain errors
      in the math module.

      variable for holding the warning filtering state if
      the sys.flags.context_aware_warnings flag is set to
      true. This makes using the context manager thread-safe
      in multi-threaded programs. The flag is true by default
      in free-threaded builds and is otherwise false. The
      value of the flag can be overridden by the the -X
      context_aware_warnings command-line option or by the
      PYTHON_CONTEXT_AWARE_WARNINGS environment variable.
    - gh-129719: Fix missing socket.CAN_RAW_ERR_FILTER constant
      in the socket module on Linux systems. It was missing since
      Python 3.11.
    - gh-129027: Raise DeprecationWarning for
      sys._clear_type_cache(). This function was deprecated in
      Python 3.13 but it didn’t raise a runtime warning.
    - gh-128307: Add eager_start keyword argument to
      asyncio.loop.create_task()
    - gh-127604: Add support for printing the C stack trace on

      via the c_stack argument in faulthandler.enable().
    - gh-127385: Add the F_DUPFD_QUERY constant to the fcntl
      module.
    - gh-126838: Add resolve_host keyword-only parameter to
      urllib.request.url2pathname(), and fix handling of file
      URLs with authorities.
    - gh-82129: Fix NameError when calling
      typing.get_type_hints() on a dataclasses.dataclass()
      created by dataclasses.make_dataclass() with un-annotated
      fields.
    - gh-122559: Remove __reduce__() and __reduce_ex__() methods
      that always raise TypeError in the C implementation
      of io.FileIO, io.BufferedReader, io.BufferedWriter
      and io.BufferedRandom and replace them with default
      __getstate__() methods that raise TypeError. This restores
      fine details of behavior of Python 3.11 and older versions.
    - gh-122179: hashlib.file_digest() now raises BlockingIOError
      when no data is available during non-blocking I/O. Before,
      it added spurious null bytes to the digest.
    - gh-53032: Expose decimal.IEEEContext() to support creation
      of contexts corresponding to the IEEE 754 (2008) decimal
      interchange formats. Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-120220: Deprecate the tkinter.Variable
      methods trace_variable(), trace_vdelete() and
      trace_vinfo(). Methods trace_add(), trace_remove() and
      trace_info() can be used instead.
    - gh-113539: webbrowser: Names in the BROWSER environment
      variable can now refer to already registered web browsers,
      instead of always generating a new browser command.
      This makes it possible to set BROWSER to the value of one
      of the supported browsers on macOS.
    - bpo-44172: Keep a reference to original curses windows in
      subwindows so that the original window does not get deleted
      before subwindows.
    - gh-75223: Deprecate undotted extensions in
      mimetypes.MimeTypes.add_type(). Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
  - IDLE
    - gh-112936: fix IDLE: no Shell menu item in single-process
      mode.
  - Documentation
    - gh-107006: Move documentation and example code for
      threading.local from its docstring to the official docs.
    - gh-125142: As part of the builtin help intro text, show the
      keyboard shortcuts for the new, non-basic REPL (F1, F2, and
      F3).
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-133336: -J is no longer reserved for use by
      Jython. Patch by Adam Turner.
    - gh-133261: Fix bug where the cycle GC could untrack
      objects in the trashcan because they looked like they were
      immortal. When objects are added to the trashcan, we take
      care to ensure they keep a mortal reference count.
    - gh-133346: Added experimental color theming support to the
      _colorize module.
    - gh-132917: For the free-threaded build, check the process
      memory usage increase before triggering a full automatic
      garbage collection. If the memory used has not increased
      10% since the last collection then defer it.
    - gh-91048: Add a new python -m asyncio ps PID command-line
      interface to inspect asyncio tasks in a running Python
      process. Displays a flat table of await relationships. A
      variant showing a tree view is also available as python -m
      asyncio pstree PID. Both are useful for debugging async
      code. Patch by Pablo Galindo, Łukasz Langa, Yury Selivanov,
      and Marta Gomez Macias.
    - gh-133304: Workaround NaN’s “canonicalization” in
      PyFloat_Pack4() and PyFloat_Unpack4() on RISC-V.
    - gh-133197: Improve SyntaxError error messages for
      incompatible string / bytes prefixes.
    - gh-133231: Add new utilities of observing JIT compilation:
      sys._jit.is_available(), sys._jit.is_enabled(), and
      sys._jit.is_active().
    - gh-133194: ast.parse() will no longer parse new PEP 758
      syntax with older feature_version passed.
    - gh-131798: Split CALL_LEN into several uops allowing the
      JIT to remove them when optimizing. Patch by Diego Russo.
    - gh-131798: Use sym_new_type instead of sym_new_not_null for
      _BUILD_STRING, _BUILD_SET
    - gh-132942: Fix two races in the type lookup cache. This
      affected the free-threaded build and could cause crashes
      (apparently quite difficult to trigger).
    - gh-131798: Propagate the return type of
      _BINARY_OP_SUBSCR_TUPLE_INT in JIT. Patch by Tomas Roun
    - gh-132952: Speed up startup with the -S argument by
      importing the private _io module instead of io. This fixes
      a performance regression introduced earlier in Python 3.14
      development and restores performance to the level of Python
      3.13.
    - gh-131798: Allow the JIT to remove int guards after
      _CALL_LEN by setting the return type to int. Patch by Diego
      Russo
    - gh-131798: Split CALL_TUPLE_1 into several uops allowing
      the JIT to remove some of them. Patch by Tomas Roun
    - gh-131798: Split CALL_STR_1 into several uops allowing the
      JIT to remove some of them. Patch by Tomas Roun
    - gh-132825: Enhance unhashable key/element error messages
      for dict and set. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-131591: Reset any PEP 768 remote debugging pending call
      in children after os.fork() calls.
    - gh-132713: Fix repr(list) race condition: hold a strong
      reference to the item while calling repr(item). Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-132661: Implement PEP 750 (Template Strings). Add
      new syntax for t-strings and implement new
      internal string.templatelib.Template and
      string.templatelib.Interpolation types.
    - gh-132479: Fix compiler crash in certain circumstances
      where multiple module-level annotations include
      comprehensions and other nested scopes.
    - gh-132747: Fix a crash when calling __get__() of a method
      with a None second argument.
    - gh-132744: Certain calls now check for runaway recursion
      and respect the system recursion limit.
    - gh-132449: Syntax errors that look like misspellings of
      Python keywords now provide a helpful fix suggestion for
      the typo. Contributed by Pablo Galindo Salgado.
    - gh-132737: Support profiling code that requires __main__,
      such as pickle.
    - gh-132639: Added PyLong_AsNativeBytes(),
      PyLong_FromNativeBytes() and
      PyLong_FromUnsignedNativeBytes() to the limited C API.
    - gh-100239: Add specialisation for BINARY_OP/SUBSCR on list
      and slice.
    - gh-132508: Uses tagged integers on the evaluation stack
      to represent the instruction offsets when reraising an
      exception. This avoids the need to box the integer which
      could fail in low memory conditions.
    - gh-124476: Fix decoding from the locale encoding in the
      C.UTF-8 locale.
    - gh-131927: Compiler warnings originating from the same
      module and line number are now only emitted once, matching
      the behaviour of warnings emitted from user code. This can
      also be configured with warnings filters.
    - gh-132457: Make staticmethod() and classmethod() generic.
    - gh-131798: Use sym_new_type instead of sym_new_not_null for
      _BUILD_LIST, _BUILD_SET, _BUILD_MAP
    - gh-131798: Split CALL_TYPE_1 into several uops allowing the
      JIT to remove some of them.
    - gh-132386: Fix crash when passing a dict subclass as the
      globals parameter to exec().
    - gh-127682: No longer call __iter__ twice when creating and
      executing a generator expression. Creating a generator
      expression from a non-interable will raise only when the
      generator expression is executed. This brings the behavior
      of generator expressions in line with other generators.
    - gh-132261: The internal storage for annotations and
      annotate functions on classes now uses different keys in
      the class dictionary. This eliminates various edge cases
      where access to the __annotate__ and __annotations__
      attributes would behave unpredictably.
    - gh-132284: Don’t wrap base PyCFunction slots on class
      creation if not overridden.
    - gh-130415: Improve the JIT’s ability to remove unused
      constant and local variable loads, and fix an issue where
      deallocating unused values could cause JIT code to crash or
      behave incorrectly.
    - gh-126703: Fix possible use after free in cases where a
      method’s definition has the same lifetime as its self.
    - gh-132286: Fix that type.__annotate__ was not deleted, when
      type.__annotations__ was deleted.
    - gh-131798: Allow the JIT to remove an extra _TO_BOOL_BOOL
      instruction after _CONTAINS_OP_DICT by setting the return
      type to bool.
    - gh-124715: Prevents against stack overflows when calling
      Py_DECREF(). Third-party extension objects no longer need
      to use the “trashcan” mechanism, as protection is now built
      into the Py_DECREF() macro.
    - gh-131798: Allow the JIT compiler to remove some type
      checks for operations on lists, tuples, dictionaries, and
      sets.
    - gh-128398: Improve error message when an object supporting
      the synchronous (resp. asynchronous) context manager
      protocol is entered using async with (resp. with) instead
      of with (resp. async with). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-131798: Allow the JIT to remove unicode guards after
      _BINARY_OP_SUBSCR_STR_INT by setting the return type to
      string.
    - gh-131878: Handle uncaught exceptions in the main input
      loop for the new REPL.
    - gh-131878: Fix support of unicode characters with two or
      more codepoints on Windows in the new REPL.
    - gh-126835: Move constant folding to the peephole
      optimizer. Rename AST optimization related files
      (Python/ast_opt.c -> Python/ast_preprocess.c), structs
      (_PyASTOptimizeState -> _PyASTPreprocessState) and
      functions (_PyAST_Optimize -> _PyAST_Preprocess,
      _PyCompile_AstOptimize -> _PyCompile_AstPreprocess).
    - gh-114809: Add support for macOS multi-arch builds with the
      JIT enabled
    - gh-131507: PyREPL now supports syntax
      highlighing. Contributed by Łukasz Langa.
    - gh-130907: If the __annotations__ of a module object
      are accessed while the module is executing, return the
      annotations that have been defined so far, without caching
      them.
    - gh-130104: Three-argument pow() now try calling __rpow__()
      if necessary. Previously it was only called in two-argument
      pow() and the binary power operator.
    - gh-130070: Fixed an assertion error for exec() passed a
      string source and a non-None closure. Patch by Bartosz
      Sławecki.
    - gh-129958: Fix a bug that was allowing newlines
      inconsitently in format specifiers for single-quoted
      f-strings. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-129858: elif statements that follow an else block now
      have a specific error message.
    - gh-69605: Add module autocomplete to PyREPL.
    - gh-128555: Add the sys.flags.thread_inherit_context flag.
        - This flag is set to true by default on the
          free-threaded build and false otherwise. If the flag
          is true, starting a new thread using threading.Thread
          will, by default, use a copy of the contextvars.Context
          from the caller of threading.Thread.start() rather than
          using an empty context.
        - Add the -X thread_inherit_context command-line option
          and PYTHON_THREAD_INHERIT_CONTEXT environment variable,
          which set the thread_inherit_context flag.
        - Add the context keyword parameter to Thread. It can be
          used to explicitly pass a context value to be used by a
          new thread.
        - Make the _contextvars module built-in.
    - gh-123539: Improve SyntaxError message for using import ...
      as and from ... import ... as with not a name.
    - gh-102567: -X importtime now accepts value 2, which
      indicates that an importtime entry should also be printed
      if an imported module has already been loaded. Patch by
      Noah Kim and Adam Turner.
    - gh-116436: Improve error message when TypeError occurs
      during dict.update()
    - gh-103997: String arguments passed to “-c” are now
      automatically dedented as if by textwrap.dedent(). This
      allows “python -c” invocations to be indented in shell
      scripts without causing indentation errors. (Patch by Jon
      Crall and Steven Sun)
    - gh-89562: Remove hostflags member from PySSLContext struct.
  - C API
    - gh-133166: Fix regression where PyType_GetModuleByDef()
      returns NULL without setting TypeError when a static type
      is passed.
    - gh-133164: Add
      PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary() function
      for determining if an object exists as a unique temporary
      variable on the interpreter’s stack. This is a replacement
      for some cases where checking that Py_REFCNT() is one is
      no longer sufficient to determine if it’s safe to modify a
      Python object in-place with no visible side effects.
    - gh-133140: Add PyUnstable_Object_IsUniquelyReferenced()
      as a replacement for Py_REFNCT(op) == 1 on free threaded
      builds of Python.
    - gh-131747: On non-Windows platforms, deprecate using
      ctypes.Structure._pack_ to use a Windows-compatible layout
      on non-Windows platforms. The layout should be specified
      explicitly by setting ctypes.Structure._layout_ to 'ms'.
    - gh-128972: For non-free-threaded builds, the memory layout
      of PyASCIIObject is reverted to match Python 3.13. (Note
      that the structure is not part of stable ABI and so its
      memory layout is guaranteed to remain stable.)
    - gh-133079: The undocumented APIs Py_C_RECURSION_LIMIT and
      PyThreadState.c_recursion_remaining, added in 3.13, are
      removed without a deprecation period.
    - gh-132987: The k and K formats in PyArg_Parse() now support
      the __index__() special method, like all other integer
      formats.
    - gh-132909: Fix an overflow when handling the K format in
      Py_BuildValue(). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-132798: Deprecated and undocumented
      functions PyUnicode_AsEncodedObject(),
      PyUnicode_AsDecodedObject(), PyUnicode_AsEncodedUnicode()
      and PyUnicode_AsDecodedUnicode() are scheduled for removal
      in 3.15.
    - gh-132470: Creating a ctypes.CField with a byte_size that
      does not match the actual type size now raises a ValueError
      instead of crashing the interpreter.
    - gh-112068: Add support of nullable arguments in
      PyArg_Parse() and similar functions. Adding ? after any
      format unit makes None be accepted as a value.
    - gh-50333: Non-tuple sequences are deprecated as argument
      for the (items) format unit in PyArg_ParseTuple() and other
      argument parsing functions if items contains format units
      which store a borrowed buffer or a borrowed reference.
  - Build
    - gh-113464: Use the cpython-bin-deps “externals” repository
      for Windows LLVM dependency management. Installing LLVM
      manually is no longer necessary for Windows JIT builds.
    - gh-133183: iOS compiler shims now include
      IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET in target triples, ensuring that
      SDK version minimums are honored.
    - gh-133167: Fix compilation process with
      --enable-optimizations and --without-docstrings.
    - gh-133171: Since free-threaded builds do not support the
      experimental JIT compiler, prevent these configurations
      from being combined.
    - gh-132758: Fix building with tail call interpreter and
      pystats.
    - gh-132649: The PClayout script now allows passing
      --include-tcltk on Windows ARM64.
    - gh-132257: Change the default LTO flags on GCC to not
      pass -flto-partition=none, and allow parallelization of
      LTO. For newer GNU makes and GCC, this has a multiple
      factor speedup for LTO build times, with no noticeable loss
      in performance.
    - gh-132026: Fix use of undefined identifiers in platform
      triplet detection on MIPS Linux platforms.
- Disabled GIL and experimental JIT cannot be combined.
- Remove python-3.3.0b1-test-posix_fadvise.patch (not needed
  since kernel 3.6-rc1)
- _contextvars is not a dynamic module any more
  (gh#python/cpython#128384)
- rename _testexternalinspection to _remotedebugging
  (gh#python/cpython!133284)

Sat Apr 12 21:50:29 UTC 2025 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 3.14.0~a7:
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-132121: Always escape non-printable Unicode characters in
      pygettext.
    - gh-131852: msgfmt no longer adds the POT-Creation-Date to
      generated .mo files for consistency with GNU msgfmt.
  - Tests
    - gh-131277: Allow to unset one or more environment variables
      at once via EnvironmentVarGuard.unset(). Patch by Bénédikt
      Tran.
    - gh-131050: test_ssl.test_dh_params is skipped if the
      underlying TLS library does not support finite-field
      ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.
  - Security
    - gh-131809: Update bundled libexpat to 2.7.1
    - gh-131261: Upgrade to libexpat 2.7.0
    - gh-121284: Fix bug in the folding of rfc2047 encoded-words
      when flattening an email message using a modern email
      policy. Previously when an encoded-word was too long for
      a line, it would be decoded, split across lines, and
      re-encoded. But commas and other special characters in the
      original text could be left unencoded and unquoted. This
      could theoretically be used to spoof header lines using a
      carefully constructed encoded-word if the resulting rendered
      email was transmitted or re-parsed.
  - Library
    - gh-132174: Fix function name in error message of
      _interpreters.run_string.

      __new__() by decorator warnings.deprecated. Patch by Xuehai
      Pan.
    - gh-132168: The ctypes.py_object type now supports
      subscription, making it a generic type.
    - gh-84481: Add the zipfile.ZipFile.data_offset attribute,
      which stores the offset to the beginning of ZIP data in a
      file when available. When the zipfile.ZipFile is opened in
      either mode 'w' or 'x' and the underlying file does not
      support tell(), the value will be None instead.
    - gh-132075: Fix possible use of socket address structures
      with uninitialized members. Now all structure members are
      initialized with zeroes by default.
    - gh-118761: Improve import times by up to 27x for the string
      module. Patch by Adam Turner.
    - gh-125434: Display thread name in faulthandler. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-132002: Fix crash when deallocating contextvars.ContextVar
      with weird unahashable string names.
    - gh-131938: xml.etree.ElementTree: update the error message
      when an element to remove via Element.remove is not
      found. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-115942: Add threading.RLock.locked(),
      multiprocessing.Lock.locked(),
      multiprocessing.RLock.locked(), and allow
      multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Lock() and
      multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.RLock() to proxy
      locked() call.
    - gh-131974: Fix several thread-safety issues in ctypes on the
      free threaded build.
    - gh-118761: Improve the import time of the ast module by
      extracting the unparse() function to a helper module.
    - gh-107369: Improved performance of textwrap.dedent() by an
      average of ~1.3x. Patch by Adam Turner.
    - gh-131792: Improved performance of textwrap.dedent() by an
      average of ~2.4x, (with improvements of up to 4x for large
      inputs), and fixed a bug where blank lines with whitespace
      characters other than space or horizontal tab were not
      normalised to the newline. Patch by Adam Turner, Marius
      Juston, and Pieter Eendebak.
    - gh-131668: socket: Fix code parsing AF_BLUETOOTH socket
      addresses.
    - gh-60115: Support frozen modules for linecache.getline().

      gzip.GzipFile with a filename fails, for example when passing
      an invalid compresslevel.
    - gh-131435: 10-20% performance improvement of
      random.randint().
    - gh-131461: Fix ResourceWarning when constructing a
      gzip.GzipFile in write mode with a broken file object.
    - gh-125866: Deprecate the nturl2path module. Call
      urllib.request.url2pathname() and pathname2url() instead.
    - gh-126367: Fix issue where urllib.request.url2pathname()
      raised OSError when given a Windows URI containing a colon
      character not following a drive letter, such as before an
      NTFS alternate data stream.
    - gh-120144: Disable CALL event in bdb in monitoring backend
      when we don’t need any new events on the code object to get a
      better performance.
    - gh-131358: Register cseuckr as an encoding alias for euc_kr.
    - gh-131325: Fix sendfile fallback implementation to drain data
      after writing to transport in asyncio.
    - gh-90548: platform.libc_ver() can now detect and report the
      version of musl on Alpine Linux.
    - gh-129843: Fix incorrect argument passing in
      warnings.warn_explicit().
    - gh-70647: When creating a datetime object with an out of
      range date a more informative error is raised.
    - gh-130914: Allow graphlib.TopologicalSorter.prepare()
      to be called more than once as long as sorting has not
      started. Patch by Daniel Pope.

      re. Patch by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-129598: Fix ast.unparse() when ast.Interactive contains
      multiple statements.
    - gh-85162: The http.server module now includes
      built-in support for HTTPS servers exposed by
      http.server.HTTPSServer. This functionality is exposed by the
      command-line interface (python -m http.server) through the
      --tls-cert, --tls-key and --tls-password-file options. Patch
      by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-129463: The implementations of equality and hashing
      for annotationlib.ForwardRef now use all attributes on
      the object. Two ForwardRef objects are equal only if all
      attributes are equal.
    - gh-128593: annotationlib.ForwardRef objects no longer cache
      their value when they are successfully evaluated. Successive
      calls to annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate() may return
      different values.
    - gh-117779: Fix reading duplicated entries in zipfile by
      name. Reading duplicated entries (except the last one) by
      ZipInfo now emits a warning instead of raising an exception.
    - gh-128715: The class of Structure/Union field descriptors
      is now available as CField, and has new attributes to aid
      debugging and introspection.
    - gh-128055: Fix test.test_sysconfig.test_sysconfigdata_json
      when running outside the build directory (eg. after
      installing).
    - gh-126037: xml.etree.ElementTree: Fix a crash in
      Element.find, Element.findtext and Element.findall when
      the tag to find implements an __eq__() method mutating the
      element being queried. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-127794: When headers are added to email.message.Message
      objects, either through email.message.Message.__setitem__()
      or email.message.Message.add_header(), the field name is now
      validated according to RFC 5322, Section 2.2 and a ValueError
      is raised if the field name contains any invalid characters.
    - gh-123599: Deprecate pathlib.PurePath.as_uri(); use
      pathlib.Path.as_uri() instead.
    - gh-126033: xml.etree.ElementTree: Fix a crash in
      Element.remove when the element is concurrently
      mutated. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-120144: Add the optional backend of sys.monitoring to bdb
      and use it for pdb.

      interface for CPython). Add a new sys.remote_exec() function
      to the sys module. This function schedules the execution of
      a Python file in a separate process. Patch by Pablo Galindo,
      Matt Wozniski and Ivona Stojanovic.

      pygettext.
  - Tests
    - gh-129200: Multiple iOS testbed runners can now be started
      at the same time without introducing an ambiguity over
      simulator ownership.
    - gh-130292: The iOS testbed will now run successfully on a
      machine that has not previously run Xcode tests (such as CI

    - gh-127371: Avoid unbounded buffering for
      tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile.writelines(). Previously,
      disk spillover was only checked after the lines iterator
      had been exhausted. This is now done after each line is
      written.
  - Library
    - gh-131204: Use monospace font from System Font Stack for
      cross-platform support in difflib.HtmlDiff.
    - gh-131196: Improve perfomance of uuid.UUID.hex and
      uuid.UUID.__str__.

      Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-93096: Removed undocumented -t and -v arguments of
      python -m pickle. Use python -m doctest Lib/pickle.py -v

      that cannot be interpreted as an integer or float is
      provided.
    - gh-93096: Removed undocumented -t and -v arguments
      of python -m pickletools. Use python -m doctest

    - gh-130660: sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 are now restored after
      code.interact() call.
    - gh-130608: Remove dirs_exist_ok argument from
      pathlib.Path.copy() and copy_into(). These methods are new
      in Python 3.14.
    - gh-130461: Remove .. index:: directives from the uuid
      module documentation. These directives previously created
      entries in the general index for getnode() as well as the
      uuid1(), uuid3(), uuid4(), uuid5(), and uuid8() constructor
      functions.
    - gh-130379: The zipapp module now calculates the list of
      files to be added to the archive before creating the
      archive. This avoids accidentally including the target when
      it is being created in the source directory.
    - gh-82987: Inline breakpoints like breakpoint() or
      pdb.set_trace() will always stop the program at calling
      frame, ignoring the skip pattern (if any).
    - gh-125377: <tab> at the beginning of the line in pdb
      multi-line input will fill in a 4-space indentation now,
      instead of inserting a \t character.
    - gh-125413: Ensure the path returned from
      pathlib.Path.copy() or move() has fresh info.
    - gh-65697: stdlib configparser will now attempt to validate
      that keys it writes will not result in file corruption
      (creating a file unable to be accurately parsed by a future
      read() call from the same parser). Attempting a corrupting
      write() will raise an InvalidWriteError.
    - gh-125413: Speed up Path.copy by making better use of info
      internally.
    - gh-130285: Fix corner case for random.sample() allowing the
      counts parameter to specify an empty population. So now,
      sample([], 0, counts=[]) and sample('abc', k=0, counts=[0,
      0, 0]) both give the same result as sample([], 0).
    - gh-124703: Executing quit command in pdb will raise
      bdb.BdbQuit when pdb is started from an interactive console
      using breakpoint() or pdb.set_trace().
    - gh-107773: Make datetime subclass __repr__() consistent
      both implementations. Patch by Semyon Moroz.

      pdb commands are missing
    - gh-127750: Improve repr of functools.singledispatchmethod
      methods and descriptors.
    - gh-128520: Apply type conversion consistently in
      pathlib.PurePath and Path methods can accept a path
      object as an argument, such as match() and rename(). The
      argument is now converted to path object if it lacks a
      with_segments() attribute, and not otherwise.
    - gh-118761: Reverts a change in the previous release
      attempting to make some stdlib imports used within the
      subprocess module lazy as this was causing errors during
      __del__ finalizers calling methods such as terminate, or
      kill, or send_signal.
    - gh-130164: Fixed failure to raise TypeError in
      inspect.Signature.bind() for positional-only arguments
      provided by keyword when a variadic keyword argument (e.g.
      **kwargs) is present.
    - gh-130151: Fix reference leaks in _hashlib.hmac_new() and
      _hashlib.hmac_digest(). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-130145: Fix asyncio.AbstractEventloop.run_forever() when
      another loop is already running.
    - gh-130139: Fix bug where ast.parse() did not error on AST
      input which is not of the correct type, when called with
      optimize=False.
    - gh-127260: Forbid the use of colon (“:”) as a fractional
      component separator and other improvements to the
      consistency of error raising between the C and Python
      implementaitons of datetime.time.fromisoformat() and
      datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(). Patch by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-85795: Using super() and __class__ closure variable in
      user-defined methods of typing.NamedTuple subclasses is now
      explicitly prohibited at runtime. Contributed by Bartosz
      Sławecki in gh-130082.
    - gh-118761: Improve import time of cmd by lazy importing
      inspect and removing string. Patch by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-129726: Fix gzip.GzipFile raising an unraisable
      exception during garbage collection when referring to
      a temporary object by breaking the reference loop with
      weakref.
    - gh-127750: Remove broken functools.singledispatchmethod()
      caching introduced in gh-85160. Achieve the same
      performance using different optimization.
    - gh-129948: Add support for shared set to
      multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager via SyncManager.set().
    - gh-129965: Update MIME types for .avi and .wav. Add MIME
      types for .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .epub, .flac, .m4a, .odg,
      .odp, .ods, .odt, .oga, .ogg, .ogx and .weba. Patch by Hugo
      van Kemenade.
    - gh-129889: Support context manager protocol by
      contextvars.Token. Patch by Andrew Svetlov.
    - gh-97850: Update the deprecation warning of
      importlib.abc.Loader.load_module().
    - gh-129678: configparser.ConfigParser: do not write an empty
      unnamed section
    - gh-128641: Restore configparser.ConfigParser.read()
      performance.
    - gh-129569: Fix unicodedata.normalize() to always return a
      built-in str object when given an input of a str subclass,
      regardless of whether the string is already normalized.
    - gh-128231: Execution of multiple statements in the new
      REPL now stops immediately upon the first exception
      encountered. Patch by Bartosz Sławecki.
    - gh-96092: Fix bug in traceback.walk_stack() called with
      None where it was skipping more frames than in prior
      versions. This bug fix also changes walk_stack to walk the
      stack in the frame where it was called rather than where it
      first gets used.
    - gh-129288: Add optional l2_cid and l2_bdaddr_type fields to
      socket BTPROTO_L2CAP sockaddr tuple.
    - gh-128703: Fix mimetypes.guess_type() to use default
      mapping for empty Content-Type in registry.
    - gh-128647: Eagerly write to buffers passed to
      gzip.GzipFile’s readinto() and readinto1() implementations,
      avoiding unnecessary allocations. Patch by Chris
      Markiewicz.
    - gh-128184: Improve display of annotationlib.ForwardRef
      object within inspect.Signature representations. This
      also fixes a NameError that was raised when using
      dataclasses.dataclass() on classes with unresolvable
      forward references.
    - gh-128041: Add
      concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.terminate_workers()
      and concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.kill_workers()
      as ways to terminate or kill all living worker processes
      in the given pool. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in
      gh-130849.)
    - gh-127647: Add protocols io.Reader and io.Writer
      as alternatives to typing.IO, typing.TextIO, and
      typing.BinaryIO.
    - gh-109798: Added additional information into error messages
      in datetime, and made the messages more consistent between
      the C and Python implementations. Patch by Semyon Moroz.
    - gh-125746: Delay deprecated
      zipimport.zipimporter.load_module() removal time to
      3.15. Use zipimport.zipimporter.exec_module() instead.
    - gh-74028: Add the optional buffersize parameter to
      concurrent.futures.Executor.map() to limit the number of
      submitted tasks whose results have not yet been yielded. If
      the buffer is full, iteration over the iterables pauses
      until a result is yielded from the buffer.
    - gh-124927: Non-printing characters are now properly handled
      in the new REPL.
    - gh-124096: Turn on virtual terminal mode and enable
      bracketed paste in REPL on Windows console. (If the
      terminal does not support bracketed paste, enabling it does
      nothing.)
    - gh-89083: Add uuid.uuid7() for generating UUIDv7 objects as
      specified in RFC 9562. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-89083: Add uuid.uuid6() for generating UUIDv6 objects as
      specified in RFC 9562. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-117151: Increase io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE from 8k to 128k
      and adjust open() on platforms where os.fstat() provides a
      st_blksize field (such as Linux) to use max(min(blocksize,
      8 MiB), io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE) rather than always
      using the device block size. This should improve I/O
      performance. Patch by Romain Morotti.
    - gh-105499: Make types.UnionType an alias for
      typing.Union. Both int | str and Union[int, str] now create
      instances of the same type. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-93096: Document the command-line for mimetypes. It now
      exits with 1 on failure instead of 0 and 2 on incorrect
      command-line parameters instead of 1. Also, errors are
      printed to stderr instead of stdout and their text is made
      tighter. Patch by Oleg Iarygin and Hugo van Kemenade.
  - Documentation
    - gh-125722: Require Sphinx 8.2.0 or later to build the
      Python documentation. Patch by Adam Turner.
    - gh-129712: The wheel tags supported by each macOS universal
      SDK option are now documented.
    - gh-46236: C API: Document PyUnicode_RSplit(),
      PyUnicode_Partition() and PyUnicode_RPartition().

      while registering callback.
    - gh-130804: Fix support of unicode characters on Windows in
      the new REPL.
    - gh-130932: Fix incorrect exception handling in
      _PyModule_IsPossiblyShadowing
    - gh-122029: sys.setprofile() and sys.settrace() will not
      generate a c_call event for INSTRUMENTED_CALL_FUNCTION_EX
      if the callable is a method with a C function wrapped,
      because we do not generate c_return event in such case.
    - gh-129964: Fix JIT crash on Windows on Arm. Patch by Diego
      Russo and Brandt Bucher.
    - gh-130851: Fix a crash in the free threading build when
      constructing a code object with co_consts that contains
      instances of types that are not otherwise generated by the
      bytecode compiler.
    - gh-128534: Ensure that both left and right branches have
      the same source for async for loops. Add these branches to
      the co_branches() iterator.
    - gh-130794: Fix memory leak in the free threaded build
      when resizing a shared list or dictionary from multiple
      short-lived threads.
    - gh-130415: Improve JIT understanding of integers in boolean
      context.
    - gh-130382: Fix PyRefTracer_DESTROY not being sent from
      Python/ceval.c Py_DECREF().
    - gh-130574: Renumber RESUME from 149 to 128.
    - gh-124878: Fix race conditions during runtime finalization
      that could lead to accessing freed memory.

      boolean values based on the results of truthiness tests.
    - gh-130618: Fix a bug that was causing UnicodeDecodeError or
      SystemError to be raised when using f-strings with lambda
      expressions with non-ASCII characters. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo
    - gh-123044: Make sure that the location of branch targets in
      match cases is in the body, not the pattern.
    - gh-128534: Add branch monitoring (BRANCH_LEFT and
      BRANCH_RIGHT events) for async for loops.
    - gh-130163: Fix possible crashes related to concurrent
      change and use of the sys module attributes.
    - gh-122029: INSTRUMENTED_CALL_KW will expand the method
      before monitoring to reflect the actual behavior more
      accurately.
    - gh-130415: Improve JIT’s ability to optimize strings in
      boolean contexts.
    - gh-130396: Use actual stack limits (from
      pthread_getattr_np(3)) for linux, and other systems with
      _GNU_SOURCE defined, when determining limits for C stack
      protection.
    - gh-128396: Fix a crash that occurs when calling locals()
      inside an inline comprehension that uses the same local
      variable as the outer frame scope where the variable is a
      free or cell var.
    - gh-129107: Fix two more bytearray functions for free
      threading.
    - gh-127705: Use tagged references (_PyStackRef) for
      the default build as well as for the free-threading
      build. This has a small negative performance impact
      short-term but will enable larger speedups in the future
      and signficantly reduce maintenance costs by allowing a
      single implementation of tagged references in the future.
    - gh-130094: Fix two race conditions involving concurrent
      imports that could lead to spurious failures with
      ModuleNotFoundError.
    - gh-129107: Make bytearray iterator safe under free
      threading.
    - gh-115802: Use the more efficient “medium” code model for
      JIT-compiled code on supported platforms.
    - gh-107956: A build-details.json file is now install in the
      platform-independent standard library directory (PEP 739
      implementation).
    - gh-116042: Fix location for SyntaxErrors of invalid escapes
      in the tokenizer. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-91079: Change C stack overflow protection to consider
      the amount of stack consumed, rather than a counter. This
      allows deeper recursion in many cases, but remains safe.
    - gh-129715: Improve the experimental JIT’s handling of
      returns to unknown callers.
    - gh-129983: Fix data race in compile_template in sre.c.
    - gh-129967: Fix a race condition in the free threading build
      when repr(set) is called concurrently with set.clear().
    - gh-129953: The internal (evaluation) stack is now spilled
      to memory whenever execution esacpes from the interpreter
      or JIT compiled code. This should have no observable effect
      in either Python or builtin extensions, but will allow
      various important optimizations in the future.
    - gh-129515: Clarify syntax error messages for conditional
      expressions when a statement is specified before an if or
      after an else keyword.
    - gh-129349: bytes.fromhex() and bytearray.fromhex() now
      accepts ASCII bytes and bytes-like objects.
    - gh-129149: Add fast path for medium-size integers in
      PyLong_FromSsize_t(). Patch by Chris Eibl.
    - gh-129107: Make the bytearray safe under free threading.
    - gh-128974: Fix a crash in UnicodeError.__str__ when custom
      attributes implement __str__() with side-effects. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-126085: typing.TypeAliasType now supports star
      unpacking.
    - gh-125331: from __future__ import barry_as_FLUFL now works
      in more contexts, including when it is used in files,
      with the -c flag, and in the REPL when there are multiple
      statements on the same line. Previously, it worked only
      on subsequent lines in the REPL, and when the appropriate
      flags were passed directly to compile(). Patch by Pablo
      Galindo.
    - gh-121464: Make concurrent iterations over the same
      enumerate() iterator safe under free-threading. See
      Strategy for Iterators in Free Threading.
    - gh-87790: Support underscore and comma as thousands
      separators in the fractional part for floating-point
      presentation types of the new-style string formatting (with
      format() or f-strings). Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-124445: Fix specialization of generic aliases that are
      generic over a typing.ParamSpec and have been specialized
      with a nested type variable.
    - gh-120608: Adapt reversed() for use in the free-theading
      build. The reversed() is still not thread-safe in the sense
      that concurrent iterations may see the same object, but
      they will not corrupt the interpreter state.
    - gh-100388: Fix the platform._sys_version() method when
      __DATE__ is undefined at buildtime by changing default
      buildtime datetime string to the UNIX epoch.
    - bpo-44369: Improve syntax errors for incorrectly closed
      strings. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - C API
    - gh-111178: Fix PyCMethod API: replace size_t nargs with
      Py_ssize_t nargs in PyCMethod. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-130947: Add again PySequence_Fast() to the limited C
      API. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-128863: The following private functions are deprecated
      and planned for removal in Python 3.18:
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_Init(): replace
      _PyUnicodeWriter_Init(&writer) with writer =
      PyUnicodeWriter_Create(0).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_Finish(): replace
      _PyUnicodeWriter_Finish(&writer) with
      PyUnicodeWriter_Finish(writer).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_Dealloc(): replace
      _PyUnicodeWriter_Dealloc(&writer) with
      PyUnicodeWriter_Discard(writer).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar(): replace
      _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar(&writer, ch) with
      PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar(writer, ch).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr(): replace
      _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr(&writer, str) with
      PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr(writer, str).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteSubstring(): replace
      _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteSubstring(&writer, str, start, end)
      with PyUnicodeWriter_WriteSubstring(writer, str, start,
      end).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteASCIIString(): replace
      _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteASCIIString(&writer, str) with
      PyUnicodeWriter_WriteUTF8(writer, str).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteLatin1String(): replace
      _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteLatin1String(&writer, str) with
      PyUnicodeWriter_WriteUTF8(writer, str).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_Prepare(): (no replacement).
    -     _PyUnicodeWriter_PrepareKind(): (no replacement).
    - The pythoncapi-compat project can be used to get these new
      public functions on Python 3.13 and older.
    - Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-45325: Add a new p format parameter to Py_BuildValue()
      that allows to take a C integer and produce a Python bool
      object. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Build
    - gh-131035: Use -flto=thin for faster build times using
      clang-cl on Windows. Patch by Chris Eibl.
    - gh-130740: Ensure that Python.h is included before
      stdbool.h unless pyconfig.h is included before or in some
      platform-specific contexts.
    - gh-130090: Building with PlatformToolset=ClangCL on Windows
      now supports PGO (profile guided optimization). Patch by
      Chris Eibl with invaluable support from Steve Dover.
    - gh-129819: Allow building the JIT with the tailcall
      interpreter.
    - gh-129989: Fix a bug where the tailcall interpreter was
      enabled when --without-tail-call-interp was provided to the
      configure script.
    - gh-129838: Don’t redefine _Py_NO_SANITIZE_UNDEFINED when
      compiling with a recent GCC version and undefined sanitizer
      enabled.
    - gh-82909: #pragma-based linking with python3*.lib can
      now be switched off with Py_NO_LINK_LIB. Patch by
      Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin.

Mon Mar 10 15:44:31 UTC 2025 - Bernhard Wiedemann <bwiedemann@suse.com>

- Skip PGO with %want_reproducible_builds (bsc#1239210).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 12 21:20:43 UTC 2025 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to the fifth development version of 3.14.0:
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-129248: The iOS test runner now strips the log prefix
      from each line output by the test suite.
    - gh-104400: Fix several bugs in extraction by switching to
      an AST parser in pygettext.
  - Tests
    - gh-129386: Add test.support.reset_code, which can be used
      to reset various bytecode-level optimizations and local
      instrumentation for a function.
    - gh-128474: Disable test_embed test cases that segfault on
      BOLT instrument binaries. The tests are only disabled when
      BOLT is enabled.
    - gh-128003: Add an option --parallel-threads=N to the
      regression test runner that runs individual tests in
      multiple threads in parallel in order to find concurrency
      bugs. Note that most of the test suite is not yet reviewed
      for thread-safety or annotated with @thread_unsafe when
      necessary.
  - Security
    - gh-105704: When using urllib.parse.urlsplit() and
      urllib.parse.urlparse() host parsing would not reject
      domain names containing square brackets ([ and ]). Square
      brackets are only valid for IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts
      according to RFC 3986 Section 3.2.2. (bsc#1236705,
      CVE-2025-0938, gh#python/cpython#105704).
    - gh-126108: Fix a possible NULL pointer dereference in
      PySys_AddWarnOptionUnicode().
    - gh-80222: Fix bug in the folding of quoted strings
      when flattening an email message using a modern email
      policy. Previously when a quoted string was folded so
      that it spanned more than one line, the surrounding
      quotes and internal escapes would be omitted. This could
      theoretically be used to spoof header lines using a
      carefully constructed quoted string if the resulting
      rendered email was transmitted or re-parsed.
    - gh-119511: Fix a potential denial of service in the imaplib
      module. When connecting to a malicious server, it could
      cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. On
      many systems this is harmless as unused virtual memory is
      only a mapping, but if this hit a virtual address size
      limit it could lead to a MemoryError or other process
      crash. On unusual systems or builds where all allocated
      memory is touched and backed by actual ram or storage
      it could’ve consumed resources doing so until similarly
      crashing.
  - Library
    - gh-129939: Comparison pages with highlighted changes
      generated by the difflib.HtmlDiff class now support dark
      mode.
    - gh-129928: Raise sqlite3.ProgrammingError if a user-defined
      SQL function with invalid number of parameters is
      created. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
    - gh-129583: Update bundled pip to 25.0.1
    - gh-129766: Fix crash in warnings, when calling
      _release_lock() with no existing lock.
    - gh-129005: _pyio.FileIO.readall() now allocates, resizes,
      and fills a data buffer using the same algorithm
      _io.FileIO.readall() uses.
    - gh-129646: Update the locale alias mapping in the locale
      module to match the latest X Org locale alias mapping and
      support new locales in Glibc 2.41.
    - gh-128317: Put CLI calendar highlighting in private class,
      removing highlight_day from public calendar.TextCalendar
      API. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-129603: Fix bugs where sqlite3.Row objects could
      segfault if their inherited description was set to
      None. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
    - gh-129559: Add bytearray.resize() method so bytearray can
      be efficiently resized in place.
    - gh-129502: Unlikely errors in preparing arguments for
      ctypes callback are now handled in the same way as errors
      raised in the callback of in converting the result of
      the callback – using sys.unraisablehook() instead of
      sys.excepthook() and not setting sys.last_exc and other
      variables.
    - gh-129403: Corrected ValueError message for asyncio.Barrier
      and threading.Barrier.
    - gh-129409: Fix an integer overflow in the csv module when
      writing a data field larger than 2GB.
    - gh-126400: Add a socket timeout keyword argument to
      logging.handlers.SysLogHandler.
    - gh-118761: Always lazy import warnings in threading. Patch
      by Taneli Hukkinen.
    - gh-118761: Improve import time of subprocess by lazy
      importing locale and signal. Patch by Taneli Hukkinen.
    - gh-129346: In sqlite3, handle out-of-memory when creating
      user-defined SQL functions.
    - gh-129005: Optimize _pyio.FileIO.readinto by avoiding
      unnecessary objects and copies using os.readinto().
    - gh-129195: Support reporting call graph information from
      asyncio.staggered.staggered_race().
    - gh-129205: Add os.readinto() to read into a buffer object
      from a file descriptor.
    - gh-128772: Fix pydoc for methods with the __module__
      attribute equal to None.
    - gh-129061: Fix FORCE_COLOR and NO_COLOR when empty
      strings. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-92897: Scheduled the deprecation of the check_home
      argument of sysconfig.is_python_build() to Python 3.15.
    - gh-129064: Deprecate sysconfig.expand_makefile_vars(),
      in favor of using sysconfig.get_paths() with the vars
      argument.
    - gh-128550: Removed an incorrect optimization relating
      to eager tasks in asyncio.TaskGroup that resulted in
      cancellations being missed.
    - gh-128991: Release the enter frame reference within bdb
      callback
    - gh-118761: Reduce import time of pstats and zipfile by up
      to 20%, by removing unnecessary imports to typing. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-128978: Fix a NameError in
      sysconfig.expand_makefile_vars(). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-128961: Fix a crash when setting state on an exhausted
      array.array iterator.
    - gh-128894: Fix
      traceback.TracebackException._format_syntax_error not to
      fail on exceptions with custom metadata.
    - gh-128916: Do not attempt to set SO_REUSEPORT on sockets of
      address families other than AF_INET and AF_INET6, as it is
      meaningless with these address families, and the call with
      fail with Linux kernel 6.12.9 and newer.
    - gh-118761: Improve import time of tomllib by removing
      typing, string, and tomllib._types imports. Patch by Taneli
      Hukkinen.
    - gh-128679: tracemalloc: Fix race conditions when
      tracemalloc.stop() is called by a thread, while other
      threads are tracing memory allocations. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - gh-128891: Add specialized opcodes to opcode.opname.
    - gh-118761: Reduce import time of gettext by up to ten
      times, by importing re on demand. In particular, re is
      no longer implicitly exposed as gettext.re. Patch by Eli
      Schwartz.
    - gh-118761: Reduce the import time of optparse when no help
      text is printed. Patch by Eli Schwartz.
    - gh-128657: Fix possible extra reference when using objects
      returned by hashlib.sha256() under free threading.
    - gh-118761: Reduce the import time of csv by up to five
      times, by importing re on demand. In particular, re is no
      more implicitly exposed as csv.re. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-128308: Support the name keyword argument
      for eager tasks in asyncio.loop.create_task(),
      asyncio.create_task() and asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task(),
      by passing on all kwargs to the task factory set by
      asyncio.loop.set_task_factory().
    - gh-118761: Improve the performance of base64.b16decode()
      by up to ten times by more efficiently checking the
      byte-string for hexadecimal digits. Reduce the import
      time of base64 by up to six times, by no longer importing
      re. Patch by Bénédikt Tran, Chris Markiewicz, and Adam
      Turner.
    - gh-128156: When using macOS system libffi, support for
      complex types in ctypes is now checked at runtime (macOS
      10.15 or newer). The types must also be available at build
      time.
    - gh-128636: Fix PyREPL failure when os.environ is
      overwritten with an invalid value.
    - gh-128498: Default to stdout isatty for color detection
      instead of stderr. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-128384: Add locking to warnings to avoid some
      data races when free-threading is used. Change
      _warnings_runtime_state.mutex to be a recursive mutex
      and expose it to warnings, via the _acquire_lock() and
      _release_lock() functions. The lock is held when filters
      and _filters_version are updated.
    - gh-128509: Add sys._is_immortal() for identifying immortal
      objects at runtime.
    - gh-128479: Fix asyncio.staggered.staggered_race() leaking
      tasks and issuing an unhandled exception.
    - gh-128427: uuid.NIL and uuid.MAX are now available to
      represent the Nil and Max UUID formats as defined by RFC
      9562.
    - gh-91279: zipfile.ZipFile.writestr() now respect
      SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH that distributions can set centrally
      and have build tools consume this in order to produce
      reproducible output.
    - gh-112064: Fix incorrect handling of negative read sizes in
      HTTPResponse.read. Patch by Yury Manushkin.
    - gh-58956: Fixed a frame reference leak in bdb.
    - gh-128131: Completely support random access of uncompressed
      unencrypted read-only zip files obtained by ZipFile.open.
    - gh-127975: Avoid reusing quote types in ast.unparse() if
      not needed.
    - gh-115514: Fix exceptions and incomplete writes after
      asyncio._SelectorTransport is closed before writes are
      completed.
    - gh-121604: Add missing Deprecation warnings for
      importlib.machinery.DEBUG_BYTECODE_SUFFIXES,
      importlib.machinery.OPTIMIZED_BYTECODE_SUFFIXES,
      importlib.machinery.WindowsRegistryFinder,
      importlib.abc.ResourceLoader,
      importlib.abc.SourceLoader.path_mtime().
    - gh-127873: When -E is set, only ignore PYTHON_COLORS
      and not FORCE_COLOR/NO_COLOR/TERM when colourising
      output. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-125413: Add pathlib.Path.info attribute, which stores
      an object implementing the pathlib.types.PathInfo protocol
      (also new). The object supports querying the file type and
      internally caching stat() results. Path objects generated
      by iterdir() are initialized with file type information
      gleaned from scanning the parent directory.
    - gh-127712: Fix handling of the secure argument of
      logging.handlers.SMTPHandler.
    - gh-127096: Do not recreate unnamed section on every read in
      configparser.ConfigParser. Patch by Andrey Efremov.
    - gh-124369: Deprecate pdb.Pdb.curframe_locals
    - gh-126332: Fix _pyrepl crash when entering a double CTRL-Z
      on an overflowing line.
    - gh-125553: Fix round-trip invariance for backslash
      continuations in tokenize.untokenize().
    - gh-91048: Add asyncio.capture_call_graph() and
      asyncio.print_call_graph() functions.
    - gh-124703: Quitting pdb in inline mode will emit a
      confirmation prompt and exit gracefully now, instead of
      printing an exception traceback.
    - gh-123987: Fixed issue in NamespaceReader where a non-path
      item in a namespace path, such as a sentinel added by an
      editable installer, would break resource loading.
    - gh-119349: Add the ctypes.util.dllist() function to list
      the loaded shared libraries for the current process.
    - gh-55454: Add IMAP4 IDLE support to the imaplib
      module. Patch by Forest.
    - gh-119257: Show tab completions menu below the current
      line, which results in less janky behaviour, and fixes a
      cursor movement bug. Patch by Daniel Hollas
    - gh-101410: Support custom messages for domain errors in the
      math module (math.sqrt(), math.log() and math.atanh() were
      modified as examples). Patch by Charlie Zhao and Sergey B
      Kirpichev.
    - gh-81340: Use os.copy_file_range() in shutil.copy(),
      shutil.copy2(), and shutil.copyfile() functions by
      default. An underlying Linux system call gives filesystems
      an opportunity to implement the use of copy-on-write (in
      case of btrfs and XFS) or server-side copy (in the case of
      NFS.) Patch by Illia Volochii.
    - bpo-27307: Add attribute and item access support to
      string.Formatter in auto-numbering mode, which allows
      format strings like ‘{.name}’ and ‘{[1]}’.
  - IDLE
    - gh-129873: Simplify displaying the IDLE doc by only copying
      the text section of idle.html to idlelib/help.html. Patch
      by Stan Ulbrych.
  - Documentation
    - gh-125722: Require Sphinx 8.1.3 or later to build the
      Python documentation. Patch by Adam Turner.
    - gh-67206: Document that string.printable is not
      printable in the POSIX sense. In particular,
      string.printable.isprintable() returns False. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-100239: Replace the opcode BINARY_SUBSCR and its family
      by BINARY_OP with oparg NB_SUBSCR.
    - gh-129732: Fixed a race in _Py_qsbr_reserve in the free
      threading build.
    - gh-129763: Remove the internal LLTRACE macro (use Py_DEBUG
      instead).
    - gh-129715: Improve JIT performance for generators.
    - gh-129643: Fix thread safety of PyList_Insert() in
      free-threading builds.
    - gh-129668: Fix race condition when raising MemoryError in
      the free threaded build.
    - gh-129643: Fix thread safety of PyList_SetItem() in
      free-threading builds. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - gh-128563: Fix an issue where the “lltrace” debug feature
      could have been incorrectly enabled for some frames.
    - gh-129393: On FreeBSD, sys.platform doesn’t contain the
      major version anymore. It is always 'freebsd', instead of
      'freebsd13' or 'freebsd14'.
    - gh-129345: Fix null pointer dereference in syslog.openlog()
      when an audit hook raises an exception.
    - gh-129231: Improve memory layout of JIT traces. Patch by
      Diego Russo
    - gh-129149: Add fast path for medium-size integers in
      PyLong_FromUnsignedLong(), PyLong_FromUnsignedLongLong()
      and PyLong_FromSize_t().
    - gh-129201: The free-threaded version of the cyclic garbage
      collector has been optimized to conditionally use CPU
      prefetch instructions during the collection. This can
      reduce collection times by making it more likely that
      data is in the CPU cache when it is needed. The prefetch
      instructions are enabled if the number of long-lived
      objects (objects surviving a full collection) exceeds a
      threshold.
    - gh-129093: Fix f-strings such as f'{expr=}' sometimes not
      displaying the full expression when the expression contains
      !=.
    - gh-124363: Treat debug expressions in f-string as raw
      strings. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-128714: Fix the potential races in get/set dunder
      methods __annotations__, __annotate__ and __type_params__
      for function object, and add related tests.
    - gh-128799: Add frame of except* to traceback when it wraps
      a naked exception.
    - gh-128842: Collect JIT memory stats using pystats. Patch by
      Diego Russo.
    - gh-100239: Specialize BINARY_OP for bitwise logical
      operations on compact ints.
    - gh-128910: Undocumented and unused private C-API functions
      _PyTrash_begin and _PyTrash_end are removed.
    - gh-128807: Add a marking phase to the free-threaded
      GC. This is similar to what was done in gh-126491. Since
      the free-threaded GC does not have generations and is
      not incremental, the marking phase looks for all objects
      reachable from known roots. The roots are objects known to
      not be garbage, like the module dictionary for sys. For
      most programs, this marking phase should make the GC a bit
      faster since typically less work is done per object.
    - gh-100239: Add opcode BINARY_OP_EXTEND which executes a
      pair of functions (guard and specialization functions)
      accessed from the inline cache.
    - gh-128563: A new type of interpreter has been added
      to CPython. This interpreter uses tail calls for its
      instruction handlers. Preliminary benchmark results suggest
      7-11% geometric mean faster on pyperformance (depending
      on platform), and up to 30% faster on Python-intensive
      workloads. This interpreter currently only works on newer
      compilers, such as clang-19. Other compilers will continue
      using the old interpreter. Patch by Ken Jin, with ideas on
      how to implement this in CPython by Mark Shannon, Garret
      Gu, Haoran Xu, and Josh Haberman.
    - gh-126703: Improve performance of iterating over lists and
      tuples by using a freelist for the iterator objects.
    - gh-127953: The time to handle a LINE event in
      sys.monitoring (and sys.settrace) is now independent of the
      number of lines in the code object.
    - gh-128330: Restore terminal control characters on REPL
      exit.
    - gh-128016: Improved the SyntaxWarning message for invalid
      escape sequences to clarify that such sequences will raise
      a SyntaxError in future Python releases. The new message
      also suggests a potential fix, i.e., Did you mean "\\e"?.
    - gh-126004: Fix handling of UnicodeError.start and
      UnicodeError.end values in the codecs.replace_errors()
      error handler. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-126004: Fix handling of UnicodeError.start
      and UnicodeError.end values in the
      codecs.backslashreplace_errors() error handler. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-126004: Fix handling of UnicodeError.start
      and UnicodeError.end values in the
      codecs.xmlcharrefreplace_errors() error handler. Patch by

      frames outlive their generator. Patch by Mikhail Efimov.
    - gh-126349: Add turtle.fill(), turtle.poly() and
      turtle.no_animation() context managers. Patch by Marie
      Roald and Yngve Mardal Moe.
    - gh-115911: If the current working directory cannot be
      determined due to permissions, then import will no longer
      raise PermissionError. Patch by Alex Willmer.

      http.cookies.
  - C API
    - gh-129533: Update PyGC_Enable(), PyGC_Disable(),
      PyGC_IsEnabled() to use atomic operation for thread-safety
      at free-threading build. Patch by Donghee Na.
    - gh-89188: Implement PyUnicode_KIND() and PyUnicode_DATA()
      as function, in addition to the macros with the same
      names. The macros rely on C bit fields which have
      compiler-specific layout. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-91417: Remove PySequence_Fast() from the limited
      C API, since this function has to be used with
      PySequence_Fast_GET_ITEM which never worked in the limited
      C API. Patch by Victor Stinner.

      added by PEP 741 “Python Configuration C API”. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-129033: Remove the private _Py_InitializeMain()
      function. It was a provisional API added to Python 3.8 by
      PEP 587. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-128844: Add PyUnstable_TryIncRef() and
      PyUnstable_EnableTryIncRef() unstable APIs. These
      are helpers for dealing with unowned references in a
      thread-safe way, particularly in the free threading build.
    - gh-128911: Add PyImport_ImportModuleAttr() and
      PyImport_ImportModuleAttrString() helper functions to
      import a module and get an attribute of the module. Patch
      by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-128863: The following private functions are deprecated
      and planned for removal in Python 3.18:
        _PyBytes_Join(): use PyBytes_Join().
        _PyDict_GetItemStringWithError(): use PyDict_GetItemStringRef().
        _PyDict_Pop(): use PyDict_Pop().
        _PyLong_Sign(): use PyLong_GetSign().
        _PyLong_FromDigits() and _PyLong_New(): use PyLongWriter_Create().
        _PyThreadState_UncheckedGet(): use PyThreadState_GetUnchecked().
        _PyUnicode_AsString(): use PyUnicode_AsUTF8().
        _Py_HashPointer(): use Py_HashPointer().
        _Py_fopen_obj(): use Py_fopen().
    The pythoncapi-compat project can be used to get these new
    public functions on Python 3.13 and older. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-126599: Remove some internal test APIs for the
      experimental JIT compiler.
    - gh-127925: Convert the decimal module to use PEP 757 C API
      (export-import integers), offering some speed-up if the
      integer part of the Decimal instance is small. Patch by
      Sergey B Kirpichev.
  - Build
    - gh-129660: Drop test_embed from PGO training, whose
      contribution in recent versions is considered to be
      ignorable.
    - gh-128902: Fix compile errors with Clang 9 and older due to
      lack of __attribute__((fallthrough)) support.
- Remove upstreamed patches:
    - CVE-2025-0938-sq-brackets-domain-names.patch
    - 314a4-no-SO_REUSEPORT.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to the fourth development version of 3.14.0:
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-128152: Fix a bug where Argument Clinic’s C
      pre-processor parser tried to parse pre-processor
      directives inside C comments. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
  - Tests
    - gh-128690: Temporarily do not use test_embed in PGO profile
      builds until the problem with test_init_pyvenv_cfg failing
      in some configurations is resolved.
  - Library
    - gh-128731: Fix ResourceWarning in
      urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser.read().
    - gh-71339: Add new assertion methods for unittest:
      assertHasAttr(), assertNotHasAttr(), assertIsSubclass(),
      assertNotIsSubclass() assertStartsWith(),
      assertNotStartsWith(), assertEndsWith() and
      assertNotEndsWith().
    - gh-118761: Improve import time of pickle by 25% by removing
      an unnecessary regular expression. As such, re is no more
      implicitly available as pickle.re. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-128661: Fixes typing.evaluate_forward_ref() not showing
      deprecation when type_params arg is not passed.
    - gh-128562: Fix possible conflicts in generated tkinter
      widget names if the widget class name ends with a digit.
    - gh-128559: Improved import time of asyncio.
    - gh-128552: Fix cyclic garbage introduced
      by asyncio.loop.create_task() and
      asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task() holding a reference to the
      created task if it is eager.
    - gh-128340: Add internal thread safe handle to be used
      in asyncio.loop.call_soon_threadsafe() for thread safe
      cancellation.
    - gh-128182: Fix crash when using ctypes pointers
      concurrently on the free threaded build.
    - gh-128400: Only show the current thread in faulthandler on
      the free threaded build to prevent races.
    - gh-128400: Fix crash when using
      faulthandler.dump_traceback() while other threads are
      active on the free threaded build.
    - gh-128388: Fix PyREPL on Windows to support more
      keybindings, like the Control-← and Control-→ word-skipping
      keybindings and those with meta (i.e. Alt), e.g. Alt-d to
      kill-word or Alt-Backspace backward-kill-word.
    - gh-88834: Unify the instance check for typing.Union and
      types.UnionType: Union now uses the instance checks against
      its parameters instead of the subclass checks.
    - gh-128302: Fix
      xml.dom.xmlbuilder.DOMEntityResolver.resolveEntity(), which
      was broken by the Python 3.0 transition.
    - gh-128317: Highlight today in colour in calendar’s CLI
      output. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-128302: Allow xml.dom.xmlbuilder.DOMParser.parse()
      to correctly handle xml.dom.xmlbuilder.DOMInputSource
      instances that only have a systemId attribute set.
    - gh-128151: Improve generation of UUID objects version 3,
      4, 5, and 8 via their dedicated functions by 30%. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-128118: Improve performance of copy.copy() by 30% via a
      fast path for atomic types and container types.
    - gh-127946: Fix crash when modifying ctypes._CFuncPtr
      objects concurrently on the free threaded build.
    - gh-128062: Revert the font of turtledemo’s menu bar to its
      default value and display the shortcut keys in the correct
      position.
    - gh-128014: Fix resetting the default window icon by passing
      default='' to the tkinter method wm_iconbitmap().
    - gh-41872: Fix quick extraction of module docstrings from
      a file in pydoc. It now supports docstrings with single
      quotes, escape sequences, raw string literals, and other
      Python syntax.
    - gh-127060: Set TERM environment variable to “dumb” to
      disable traceback colors in IDLE, since IDLE doesn’t
      understand ANSI escape sequences. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-126742: Fix support of localized error messages reported
      by dlerror(3) and gdbm_strerror in ctypes and dbm.gnu
      functions respectively. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-122548: Adds two new local events to sys.monitoring,
      BRANCH_LEFT and BRANCH_RIGHT. This allows the two arms
      of the branch to be disabled independently, which should
      hugely improve performance of branch-level coverage
      tools. The old branch event, BRANCH is now deprecated.
    - gh-127847: Fix the position when doing interleaved seeks
      and reads in uncompressed, unencrypted zip files returned
      by zipfile.ZipFile.open().
    - gh-127688: Add the SCHED_DEADLINE and SCHED_NORMAL
      constants to the os module.
    - gh-83662: Add missing __class_getitem__ method to the
      Python implementation of functools.partial(), to make it
      compatible with the C version. This is mainly relevant for
      alternative Python implementations like PyPy and GraalPy,
      because CPython will usually use the C-implementation of
      that function.
    - gh-127586: multiprocessing.pool.Pool now properly restores
      blocked signal handlers of the parent thread when creating
      processes via either spawn or forkserver.
    - gh-98188: Fix an issue in
      email.message.Message.get_payload() where data cannot be
      decoded if the Content Transfer Encoding mechanism contains
      trailing whitespaces or additional junk text. Patch by Hui
      Liu.
    - gh-127529: Correct behavior of
      asyncio.selector_events.BaseSelectorEventLoop._accept_connection()
      in handling ConnectionAbortedError in a loop. This improves
      performance on OpenBSD.
    - gh-127360: When a descriptive error message cannot be
      provided for an ssl.SSLError, the “unknown error” message
      now shows the internal error code (as retrieved by
      ERR_get_error and similar OpenSSL functions).
    - gh-127196: Fix crash when dict with keys in invalid
      encoding were passed to several functions in _interpreters
      module.
    - gh-124130: Fix a bug in matching regular expression \B in
      empty input string. Now it is always the opposite of \b. To
      get an old behavior, use (?!\A\Z)\B. To get a new behavior
      in old Python versions, use (?!\b).
    - gh-126639: tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile will now issue
      a ResourceWarning when it is finalized by the garbage
      collector without being explicitly closed.
    - gh-126624: Expose error code XML_ERROR_NOT_STARTED of Expat
      >=2.6.4 in xml.parsers.expat.errors.
    - gh-126225: getopt and optparse are no longer marked as
      deprecated. There are legitimate reasons to use one of
      these modules in preference to argparse, and none of these
      modules are at risk of being removed from the standard
      library. Of the three, argparse remains the recommended
      default choice, unless one of the concerns noted at the top
      of the optparse module documentation applies.
    - gh-124761: Add SO_REUSEPORT_LB constant to socket for
      FreeBSD.
    - gh-121720: enum.EnumDict can now be used without resorting
      to private API.
    - gh-123424: Add zipfile.ZipInfo._for_archive() setting
      default properties on ZipInfo objects. Patch by Bénédikt
      Tran and Jason R. Coombs.
    - gh-121676: Deprecate calling the Python implementation of
      functools.reduce() with a function or sequence as a keyword
      argument. This will be forbidden in Python 3.16 in order to
      match the C implementation.
    - gh-112015: ctypes.memoryview_at() now exists to create
      a memoryview object that refers to the supplied pointer
      and length. This works like ctypes.string_at() except
      it avoids a buffer copy, and is typically useful when
      implementing pure Python callback functions that are passed
      dynamically-sized buffers.
    - gh-95371: Added support for other image formats (PNG, PGM,
      and PPM) to the turtle module. Patch by Shin-myoung-serp.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-128078: Fix a SystemError when using anext() with a
      default tuple value. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-128717: Fix a crash when setting the recursion limit
      while other threads are active on the free threaded build.
    - gh-124483: Treat Py_DECREF and variants as escaping when
      generating opcode and uop metadata. This prevents the
      possibility of a __del__ method causing the JIT to behave
      incorrectly.
    - gh-126703: Improve performance of class methods by using a
      freelist.
    - gh-128137: Update PyASCIIObject layout to handle interned
      field with the atomic operation. Patch by Donghee Na.
    - gh-128192: Upgrade HTTP digest authentication algorithm for
      urllib.request by supporting SHA-256 digest authentication
      as specified in RFC 7616.
    - gh-126868: Increase usage of freelist for int allocation.
    - gh-114203: Optimize Py_BEGIN_CRITICAL_SECTION for simple
      recursive calls.
    - gh-127705: Adds stackref debugging when Py_STACKREF_DEBUG
      Inis set. Finds all double-closes and leaks, logging the
      Inorigin and last borrow. spired by HPy’s debug mode.
      Inhttps://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/debug-mode.html
    - gh-128079: Fix a bug where except* does not properly check
      the return value of an ExceptionGroup’s split() function,
      leading to a crash in some cases. Now when split() returns
      an invalid object, except* raises a TypeError with the
      original raised ExceptionGroup object chained to it.
    - gh-128030: Avoid error from calling
      PyModule_GetFilenameObject on a non-module object when
      importing a non-existent symbol from a non-module object.
    - gh-128035: Indicate through ssl.HAS_PHA whether the
      ssl module supports TLSv1.3 post-handshake client
      authentication (PHA). Patch by Will Childs-Klein.
    - gh-127274: Add a new flag, CO_METHOD, to co_flags that
      indicates whether the code object belongs to a function
      defined in class scope.
    - gh-66409: During the path initialization, we now check if
      base_exec_prefix is the same as base_prefix before falling
      back to searching the Python interpreter directory.
    - gh-127970: We now use the location of the libpython
      runtime library used in the current proccess to determine
      sys.base_prefix on all platforms implementing the dladdr
      function defined by the UNIX standard — this includes
      Linux, Android, macOS, iOS, FreeBSD, etc. This was already
      the case on Windows and macOS Framework builds.
    - gh-127773: Do not use the type attribute cache for types
      with incompatible MRO.
    - gh-127903: Objects/unicodeobject.c: fix a crash on DEBUG
      builds in _copy_characters when there is nothing to copy.
    - gh-127809: Fix an issue where the experimental JIT may
      infer an incorrect result type for exponentiation (** and
      **=), leading to bugs or crashes.
    - gh-126862: Fix a possible overflow when a class inherits
      from an absurd number of super-classes. Reported by Valery
      Fedorenko. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  - C API
    - gh-128400: Py_FatalError() no longer shows all threads on
      the free threaded build to prevent crashes.
    - gh-128629: Add macros Py_PACK_VERSION() and
      Py_PACK_FULL_VERSION() for bit-packing Python version
      numbers.
    - gh-128008: Add PyWeakref_IsDead() function, which tests if
      a weak reference is dead.
    - gh-127350: Add Py_fopen() function to open a file. Similar
      to the fopen() function, but the path parameter is a
      Python object and an exception is set on error. Add also
      Py_fclose() function to close a file, function needed for
      Windows support. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Build
    - gh-128627: For Emscripten builds the function pointer cast
      call trampoline now uses the wasm-gc ref.test instruction
      if it’s available instead of Wasm JS type reflection.
    - gh-128472: Skip BOLT optimization of functions using
      computed gotos, fixing errors on build with LLVM 19.
    - gh-115765: GNU Autoconf 2.72 is now required to generate
      !configure. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
    - gh-123925: Fix building the curses module on platforms with
      libncurses but without libncursesw.
    - gh-90905: Add support for cross-compiling to x86_64 on
      aarch64/arm64 macOS.
    - gh-128321: Set LIBS instead of LDFLAGS when checking if
      sqlite3 library functions are available. This fixes the
      ordering of linked libraries during checks, which was
      incorrect when using a statically linked libsqlite3.
    - gh-100384: Error on unguarded-availability in macOS builds,
      preventing invalid use of symbols that are not available in
      older versions of the OS.
    - gh-128104: Remove Py_STRFTIME_C99_SUPPORT conditions in
      favor of requiring C99 strftime(3) specifier support at
      build time. When cross-compiling, there is no build time
      check and support is assumed.
    - gh-127951: Add option --pystats to the Windows build to
      enable performance statistics collection.

      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-127637: Add tests for the dis command-line
      interface. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-126925: iOS test results are now streamed during test
      execution, and the deprecated xcresulttool is no longer
      used.
    - gh-127076: Disable strace based system call tests when
      LD_PRELOAD is set.
    - gh-127076: Filter out memory-related mmap, munmap, and
      mprotect calls from file-related ones when testing io
      behavior using strace.
  - Security
    - gh-127655: Fixed the
      asyncio.selector_events._SelectorSocketTransport
      transport not pausing writes for the protocol when
      the buffer reaches the high water mark when using
      asyncio.WriteTransport.writelines().
  - Library
    - gh-126907: Fix crash when using atexit concurrently on the
      free-threaded build.
    - gh-127870: Detect recursive calls in ctypes _as_parameter_
      handling. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-127732: The platform module now correctly detects
      Windows Server 2025.
    - gh-126789: Fixed sysconfig.get_config_vars(),
      sysconfig.get_paths(), and siblings, returning outdated
      cached data if the value of sys.prefix or sys.exec_prefix
      changes. Overwriting sys.prefix or sys.exec_prefix still is
      discouraged, as that might break other parts of the code.
    - gh-127718: Add colour to test.regrtest output. Patch by
      Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-127610: Added validation for more than one
      var-positional or var-keyword parameters in
      inspect.Signature. Patch by Maxim Ageev.
    - gh-127627: Added posix._emscripten_debugger() to help with
      debugging the test suite on the Emscripten target.
    - gh-126821: macOS and iOS apps can now choose to redirect
      stdout and stderr to the system log during interpreter
      configuration.

      module.
    - gh-127065: Make operator.methodcaller() thread-safe and
      re-entrant safe.
    - gh-127321: pdb.set_trace() will not stop at an opcode that
      does not have an associated line number anymore.
    - gh-127429: Fixed bug where, on cross-builds, the sysconfig
      POSIX data was being generated with the host Python’s
      Makefile. The data is now generated from current build’s
      Makefile.
    - gh-127413: Add the dis --specialized command-line option to
      show specialized bytecode. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-125413: Revert addition of pathlib.Path.scandir(). This
      method was added in 3.14.0a2. The optimizations remain for
      file system paths, but other subclasses should only have to
      implement pathlib.Path.iterdir().
    - gh-127257: In ssl, system call failures that OpenSSL
      reports using ERR_LIB_SYS are now raised as OSError.
    - gh-59705: On Linux, threading.Thread now sets the thread
      name to the operating system. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-127303: Publicly expose EXACT_TOKEN_TYPES in
      token.__all__.
    - gh-127331: ssl can show descriptions for errors added in
      OpenSSL 3.4.
    - gh-123967: Fix faulthandler for trampoline frames. If the
      top-most frame is a trampoline frame, skip it. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-127178: A _sysconfig_vars_(...).json file is now shipped
      in the standard library directory. It contains the output
      of sysconfig.get_config_vars() on the default environment
      encoded as JSON data. This is an implementation detail, and
      may change at any time.
    - gh-127072: Remove outdated socket.NETLINK_* constants not
      present in Linux kernels beyond 2.6.17.
    - gh-127255: The CopyComPointer() function is now
      public. Previously, this was private and only available in
      _ctypes.
    - gh-127182: Fix io.StringIO.__setstate__() crash, when None
      was passed as the first value.
    - gh-127217: Fix urllib.request.pathname2url() for paths
      starting with multiple slashes on Posix.
    - gh-125866: urllib.request.pathname2url() now adds an empty
      authority when generating a URL for a path that begins with
      exactly one slash. For example, the path /etc/hosts is
      converted to the scheme-less URL ///etc/hosts. As a result
      of this change, URLs without authorities are only generated
      for relative paths.
    - gh-127221: Add colour to unittest output. Patch by Hugo van
      Kemenade.
    - gh-127035: Fix shutil.which on Windows. Now it looks at
      direct match if and only if the command ends with a PATHEXT
      extension or X_OK is not in mode. Support extensionless
      files if “.” is in PATHEXT. Support PATHEXT extensions that
      end with a dot.
    - gh-122273: Support PyREPL history on Windows. Patch by
      devdanzin and Victor Stinner.
    - gh-125866: urllib.request.pathname2url() and url2pathname()
      no longer convert Windows drive letters to uppercase.
    - gh-127078: Fix issue where urllib.request.url2pathname()
      failed to discard an extra slash before a UNC drive in the
      URL path on Windows.
    - gh-126766: Fix issue where urllib.request.url2pathname()
      failed to discard any ‘localhost’ authority present in the
      URL.
    - gh-127065: Fix crash when calling a operator.methodcaller()
      instance from multiple threads in the free threading build.
    - gh-127090: Fix value of urllib.response.addinfourl.url
      for file: URLs that express relative paths and
      absolute Windows paths. The canonical URL generated by
      urllib.request.pathname2url() is now used.
    - gh-126992: Fix LONG and INT opcodes to only use base 10 for
      string to integer conversion in pickle.
    - gh-126997: Fix support of STRING and GLOBAL opcodes with
      non-ASCII arguments in pickletools. pickletools.dis()
      now outputs non-ASCII bytes in STRING, BINSTRING and
      SHORT_BINSTRING arguments as escaped (\xXX).
    - gh-126316: grp: Make grp.getgrall() thread-safe by adding a
      mutex. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-126618: Fix the representation of itertools.count
      objects when the count value is sys.maxsize.
    - gh-126615: The COMError exception is now
      public. Previously, this was private and only available in
      _ctypes.
    - gh-126985: When running under a virtual environment with
      the site disabled (see -S), sys.prefix and sys.base_prefix
      will now point to the virtual environment, instead of the
      base installation.
    - gh-112192: In the trace module, increase the coverage
      precision (cov%) to one decimal.
    - gh-118761: Improve import time of mimetypes by around 11-16
      times. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-126947: Raise TypeError in
      _pydatetime.timedelta.__new__() if the passed arguments are
      not int or float, so that the Python implementation is in
      line with the C implementation.
    - gh-126946: Improve the GetoptError error message when a
      long option prefix matches multiple accepted options in
      getopt.getopt() and getopt.gnu_getopt().
    - gh-126899: Make tkinter widget methods after() and
      after_idle() accept arguments passed by keyword.
    - gh-85168: Fix issue where urllib.request.url2pathname() and
      pathname2url() always used UTF-8 when quoting and unquoting
      file URIs. They now use the filesystem encoding and error
      handler.
    - gh-126780: Fix os.path.normpath() for drive-relative paths
      on Windows.
    - gh-126775: Make linecache.checkcache() thread safe and GC
      re-entrancy safe.
    - gh-126601: Fix issue where urllib.request.pathname2url()
      raised OSError when given a Windows path containing a colon
      character not following a drive letter, such as before an
      NTFS alternate data stream.
    - gh-126727: locale.nl_langinfo(locale.ERA) now returns
      multiple era description segments separated by
      semicolons. Previously it only returned the first segment
      on platforms with Glibc.
    - gh-85046: Add EHWPOISON error code to errno.
    - gh-118201: Fixed intermittent failures of os.confstr,
      os.pathconf and os.sysconf on iOS and Android.
    - gh-86463: The usage parameter of argparse.ArgumentParser no
      longer affects the default value of the prog parameter in
      subparsers.
    - gh-124008: Fix possible crash (in debug build), incorrect
      output or returning incorrect value from raw binary write()
      when writing to console on Windows.
    - gh-123401: The http.cookies module now supports parsing
      obsolete RFC 850 date formats, in accordance with RFC 9110
      requirements. Patch by Nano Zheng.
    - gh-122431: readline.append_history_file() now raises a
      ValueError when given a negative value.
    - gh-122356: Guarantee that the position of a file-like
      object passed to zipfile.is_zipfile() is left untouched
      after the call. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-122288: Improve the performances of fnmatch.translate()
      by a factor 1.7. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-88110: Fixed multiprocessing.Process reporting a
      .exitcode of 1 even on success when using the "fork" start
      method while using a concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.
    - gh-97514: Authentication was added to the multiprocessing
      forkserver start method control socket so that only
      processes with the authentication key generated by the
      process that spawned the forkserver can control it. This is
      an enhancement over the other gh-97514 fixes so that access
      is no longer limited only by filesystem permissions.
    The file descriptor exchange of control pipes with the forked
    worker process now requires an explicit acknowledgement byte to
    be sent over the socket after the exchange on all forkserver
    supporting platforms. That makes testing the above much easier.
  - Documentation
    - gh-127347: Publicly expose traceback.print_list() in
      traceback.__all__.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-127740: Fix error message in bytes.fromhex() when given
      an odd number of digits to properly indicate that an even
      number of hexadecimal digits is required.
    - gh-127058: PySequence_Tuple now creates the resulting
      tuple atomically, preventing partially created tuples
      being visible to the garbage collector or through
      gc.get_referrers()
    - gh-127599: Fix statistics for increments of object
      reference counts (in particular, when a reference count was
      increased by more than 1 in a single operation).
    - gh-127651: When raising ImportError for missing symbols
      in from imports, use __file__ in the error message if
      __spec__.origin is not a location
    - gh-127582: Fix non-thread-safe object resurrection when
      calling finalizers and watcher callbacks in the free
      threading build.
    - gh-127434: The iOS compiler shims can now accept arguments
      with spaces.
    - gh-127536: Add missing locks around some list assignment
      operations in the free threading build.
    - gh-127085: Fix race when exporting a buffer from a
      memoryview object on the free-threaded build.
    - gh-127238: Correct error message for
      sys.set_int_max_str_digits().
    - gh-113841: Fix possible undefined behavior division by zero
      in complex’s _Py_c_pow().
    - gh-127133: Calling
      argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group()
      on an argument group, and calling
      argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group() or
      argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group() on a
      mutually exclusive group now raise exceptions. This nesting
      was never supported, often failed to work correctly, and
      was unintentionally exposed through inheritance. This
      functionality has been deprecated since Python 3.11.
    - gh-126491: Add a marking phase to the GC. All objects that
      can be transitively reached from builtin modules or the
      stacks are marked as reachable before cycle detection. This
      reduces the amount of work done by the GC by approximately
      half.
    - gh-127020: Fix a crash in the free threading build
      when PyCode_GetCode(), PyCode_GetVarnames(),
      PyCode_GetCellvars(), or PyCode_GetFreevars() were called
      from multiple threads at the same time.
    - gh-127010: Simplify GC tracking of dictionaries. All
      dictionaries are tracked when created, rather than being
      lazily tracked when a trackable object was added to
      them. This simplifies the code considerably and results in
      a slight speedup.
    - gh-126980: Fix __buffer__() of bytearray crashing when READ
      or WRITE are passed as flags.
    - gh-126937: Fix TypeError when a ctypes.Structure
      has a field size that doesn’t fit into an unsigned
      16-bit integer. Instead, the maximum number of bits is
      sys.maxsize.
    - gh-126868: Increase performance of int by adding a freelist
      for compact ints.
    - gh-126881: Fix crash in finalization of dtoa state. Patch
      by Kumar Aditya.
    - gh-126892: Require cold or invalidated code to “warm up”
      before being JIT compiled again.
    - gh-126091: Ensure stack traces are complete when throwing
      into a generator chain that ends in a custom generator.
    - gh-126024: Optimize decoding of short UTF-8 sequences
      containing non-ASCII characters by approximately 15%.
    - gh-125420: Add memoryview.index() to memoryview
      objects. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-125420: Add memoryview.count() to memoryview
      objects. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-124470: Fix crash in free-threaded builds when replacing
      object dictionary while reading attribute on another thread
    - gh-69639: Implement mixed-mode arithmetic rules combining
      real and complex numbers as specified by C standards since
      C99. Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-120010: Correct invalid corner cases which resulted
      in (nan+nanj) output in complex multiplication,
      e.g., (1e300+1j)*(nan+infj). Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-109746: If _thread.start_new_thread() fails to start a
      new thread, it deletes its state from interpreter and thus
      avoids its repeated cleanup on finalization.
  - C API
    - gh-127896: The previously undocumented function
      PySequence_In() is soft deprecated. Use
      PySequence_Contains() instead.
    - gh-127791: Fix loss of callbacks after more than one call
      to PyUnstable_AtExit().
    - gh-127691: The Unicode Exception Objects C API now raises a
      TypeError if its exception argument is not a UnicodeError
      object. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-123378: Ensure that the value of UnicodeEncodeError.end
      retrieved by PyUnicodeEncodeError_GetEnd() lies in [min(1,
      objlen), max(min(1, objlen), objlen)] where objlen is the
      length of UnicodeEncodeError.object. Similar arguments
      apply to UnicodeDecodeError and UnicodeTranslateError and
      their corresponding C interface. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-127314: Improve error message when calling the C API
      without an active thread state on the free-threaded build.
    - gh-123378: Ensure that the value of
      UnicodeEncodeError.start retrieved by
      PyUnicodeEncodeError_GetStart() lies in [0,
      max(0, objlen - 1)] where objlen is the length of
      UnicodeEncodeError.object. Similar arguments apply to
      UnicodeDecodeError and UnicodeTranslateError and their
      corresponding C interface. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-109523: Reading text from a non-blocking stream with
      read may now raise a BlockingIOError if the operation
      cannot immediately return bytes.
    - gh-102471: Add a new import and export API for Python int
      objects (PEP 757):
        PyLong_GetNativeLayout();
        PyLong_Export();
        PyLong_FreeExport();
        PyLongWriter_Create();
        PyLongWriter_Finish();
        PyLongWriter_Discard().
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-121058: PyThreadState_Clear() now warns (and calls
      sys.excepthook) if the thread state still has an active
      exception.
  - Build
    - gh-127865: Fix build failure on systems without
      thread-locals support.
    - gh-127629: Emscripten builds now include ctypes support.
    - gh-127111: Updated the Emscripten web example to use ES6
      modules and be built into a distinct web_example subfolder.
    - gh-115869: Make jit_stencils.h (which is produced during
      JIT builds) reproducible.
    - gh-126898: The Emscripten build of Python is now based on
      ES6 modules.

      Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-126920: Fix the prefix and exec_prefix keys from
      sysconfig.get_config_vars() incorrectly having the same
      value as sys.base_prefix and sys.base_exec_prefix,
      respectively, inside virtual environments. They now
      accurately reflect sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix.
    - gh-67877: Fix memory leaks when regular expression matching
      terminates abruptly, either because of a signal or because
      memory allocation fails.
    - gh-125063: marshal now supports slice objects. The marshal
      format version was increased to 5.
    - gh-126789: Fixed the values of sysconfig.get_config_vars(),
      sysconfig.get_paths(), and their siblings when the site
      initialization happens after sysconfig has built a cache
      for sysconfig.get_config_vars().
    - gh-126188: Update bundled pip to 24.3.1
    - gh-126766: Fix issue where urllib.request.url2pathname()
      failed to discard two leading slashes introducing an empty
      authority section.
    - gh-126705: Allow os.PathLike to be a base for Protocols.
    - gh-126699: Allow collections.abc.AsyncIterator to be a base
      for Protocols.
    - gh-126654: Fix crash when non-dict was passed to several
      functions in _interpreters module.
    - gh-104745: Limit starting a patcher (from
      unittest.mock.patch() or unittest.mock.patch.object()) more
      than once without stopping it
    - gh-126595: Fix a crash when instantiating itertools.count
      with an initial count of sys.maxsize on debug builds. Patch
      by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-120423: Fix issue where urllib.request.pathname2url()
      mishandled Windows paths with embedded forward slashes.
    - gh-126565: Improve performances of zipfile.Path.open() for
      non-reading modes.
    - gh-126505: Fix bugs in compiling case-insensitive regular
      expressions with character classes containing non-BMP
      characters: upper-case non-BMP character did was ignored
      and the ASCII flag was ignored when matching a character
      range whose upper bound is beyond the BMP region.
    - gh-117378: Fixed the multiprocessing "forkserver"
      start method forkserver process to correctly inherit
      the parent’s sys.path during the importing of
      multiprocessing.set_forkserver_preload() modules in the
      same manner as sys.path is configured in workers before
      executing work items.
    - This bug caused some forkserver module preloading to
      silently fail to preload. This manifested as a performance
      degration in child processes when the sys.path was required
      due to additional repeated work in every worker.
    - It could also have a side effect of "" remaining in
      sys.path during forkserver preload imports instead of the
      absolute path from os.getcwd() at multiprocessing import
      time used in the worker sys.path.
    - The sys.path differences between phases in the child
      process could potentially have caused preload to import
      incorrect things from the wrong location. We are unaware of
      that actually having happened in practice.
    - gh-125679: The multiprocessing.Lock and
      multiprocessing.RLock repr values no longer say “unknown”
      on macOS.
    - gh-126476: Raise calendar.IllegalMonthError (now a subclass
      of IndexError) for calendar.month() when the input month is
      not correct.
    - gh-126489: The Python implementation of pickle no longer
      calls pickle.Pickler.persistent_id() for the result of
      persistent_id().
    - gh-126451: Register the contextvars.Context type to
      collections.abc.Mapping.
    - gh-126175: Add msg, doc, pos, lineno and colno attributes
      to tomllib.TOMLDecodeError. Deprecate instantiating with
      free-form arguments.
    - gh-89416: Add RFC 9559 MIME types for Matroska audiovisual
      container formats. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-126417: Register the multiprocessing.managers.DictProxy
      and multiprocessing.managers.ListProxy types in
      multiprocessing.managers to collections.abc.MutableMapping
      and collections.abc.MutableSequence, respectively.
    - gh-126390: Add support for returning intermixed options and
      non-option arguments in order in getopt.gnu_getopt().
    - gh-126374: Add support for options with optional arguments
      in the getopt module.
    - gh-126363: Speed up pattern parsing in pathlib.Path.glob()
      by skipping creation of a pathlib.Path object for the
      pattern.
    - gh-126353: asyncio.get_event_loop() now does not implicitly
      creates an event loop. It now raises a RuntimeError if
      there is no set event loop. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - gh-126313: Fix an issue in curses.napms() when
      curses.initscr() has not yet been called. Patch by Bénédikt
      Tran.
    - gh-126303: Fix pickling and copying of os.sched_param
      objects.
    - gh-126138: Fix a use-after-free crash on asyncio.Task
      objects whose underlying coroutine yields an object that
      implements an evil __getattribute__(). Patch by Nico
      Posada.
    - gh-120057: Replace the os.environ.refresh() method with a
      new os.reload_environ() function. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-126220: Fix crash in cProfile.Profile and
      _lsprof.Profiler when their callbacks were directly called
      with 0 arguments.
    - gh-126212: Fix issue where urllib.request.pathname2url()
      and url2pathname() removed slashes from Windows DOS drive
      paths and URLs.
    - gh-126223: Raise a UnicodeEncodeError instead of a
      SystemError upon calling _interpreters.create() with an
      invalid Unicode character.
    - gh-126205: Fix issue where urllib.request.pathname2url()
      generated URLs beginning with four slashes (rather than
      two) when given a Windows UNC path.
    - gh-126156: Improved performances of creating Morsel objects
      by a factor of 3.8x.
    - gh-126105: Fix a crash in ast when the ast.AST._fields
      attribute is deleted.
    - gh-126106: Fixes a possible NULL pointer dereference in
      ssl.
    - gh-126080: Fix a use-after-free crash on asyncio.Task
      objects for which the underlying event loop implements an
      evil __getattribute__(). Reported by Nico-Posada. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-125322: Correct detection of complex numbers support in
      libffi.
    - gh-126083: Fixed a reference leak in asyncio.Task objects
      when reinitializing the same object with a non-None
      context. Patch by Nico Posada.
    - gh-126068: Fix exceptions in the argparse module so that
      only error messages for ArgumentError and ArgumentTypeError
      are now translated. ArgumentError is now only used for
      command line errors, not for logical errors in the
      program. TypeError is now raised instead of ValueError for
      some logical errors.
    - gh-125413: Add pathlib.Path.scandir() method to efficiently
      fetch directory children and their file attributes. This is
      a trivial wrapper of os.scandir().
    - gh-125984: Fix use-after-free crashes on asyncio.Future
      objects for which the underlying event loop implements an
      evil __getattribute__(). Reported by Nico-Posada. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-125926: Fix urllib.parse.urljoin() for base URI with
      undefined authority. Although RFC 3986 only specify
      reference resolution for absolute base URI, urljoin()
      should continue to return sensible result for relative base
      URI.
    - gh-125969: Fix an out-of-bounds crash when an evil
      asyncio.loop.call_soon() mutates the length of the internal
      callbacks list. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-125966: Fix a use-after-free crash in
      asyncio.Future.remove_done_callback(). Patch by Bénédikt
      Tran.
    - gh-125789: Fix possible crash when mutating list of
      callbacks returned by asyncio.Future._callbacks. It
      now always returns a new copy in C implementation
      _asyncio. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - gh-126916: Allow the initial parameter of
      functools.reduce() to be passed as a keyword
      argument. Patch by Sayandip Dutta.
    - gh-124452: Fix an issue in
      email.policy.EmailPolicy.header_source_parse() and
      email.policy.Compat32.header_source_parse() that introduced
      spurious leading whitespaces into header values when the
      header includes a newline character after the header name
      delimiter (:) and before the value.
    - gh-117941: argparse.BooleanOptionalAction now rejects

      breakpoints on functions with certain annotations.
    - gh-125355: Fix several bugs in
      argparse.ArgumentParser.parse_intermixed_args().
    -     The parser no longer changes temporarily during
      parsing.
    -     Default values are not processed twice.
    -     Required mutually exclusive groups containing
      positional arguments are now supported.

      arguments in parse_known_intermixed_args().
    - gh-125767: super objects are now pickleable and copyable.
    - gh-124969: locale.nl_langinfo(locale.ALT_DIGITS) now
      returns a string again. The returned value consists of up
      to 100 semicolon-separated symbols.
    - gh-84850: Remove URLopener and FancyURLopener classes
      from urllib.request. They had previously raised
      DeprecationWarning since Python 3.3.
    - gh-125666: Avoid the exiting the interpreter if a null byte
      is given as input in the new REPL.

      for member values
    - gh-125631: Restore ability to set persistent_id and
      persistent_load attributes of instances of the Pickler and
      Unpickler classes in the pickle module.
    - gh-125378: Fixed the bug in pdb where after a multi-line
      command, an empty line repeats the first line of the
      multi-line command, instead of the full command.
    - gh-125682: Reject non-ASCII digits in the Python
      implementation of json.loads() conforming to the JSON
      specification.
    - gh-125660: Reject invalid unicode escapes for Python
      implementation of json.loads().
    - gh-52551: Use wcsftime() to implement time.strftime() on
      Windows.
    - gh-125259: Fix the notes removal logic for errors thrown in
      enum initialization.
    - gh-125633: Add function inspect.ispackage() to determine
      whether an object is a package or not.
    - gh-125614: In the FORWARDREF format of annotationlib,
      fix bug where nested expressions were not returned as
      annotationlib.ForwardRef format.
    - gh-125590: Allow FrameLocalsProxy to delete and pop if the
      key is not a fast variable.
    - gh-125600: Only show stale code warning in pdb when we
      display source code.
    - gh-125542: Deprecate passing keyword-only prefix_chars
      argument to argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group().
    - gh-125541: Pressing Ctrl-C while blocked in
      threading.Lock.acquire(), threading.RLock.acquire(), and
      threading.Thread.join() now interrupts the function call
      and raises a KeyboardInterrupt exception on Windows,
      similar to how those functions behave on macOS and Linux.
    - gh-125519: Improve traceback if importlib.reload() is
      called with an object that is not a module. Patch by Alex
      Waygood.
    - gh-125451: Fix deadlock when

      the activate script in venv when running in Git Bash for
      Windows.
    - gh-125245: Fix race condition when importing
      collections.abc, which could incorrectly return an empty
      module.
    - gh-52551: Fix encoding issues in time.strftime(), the
      strftime() method of the datetime classes datetime, date
      and time and formatting of these classes. Characters
      not encodable in the current locale are now acceptable
      in the format string. Surrogate pairs and sequence
      of surrogatescape-encoded bytes are no longer
      recombinated. Embedded null character no longer terminates
      the format string.
    - gh-124984: Fixed thread safety in ssl in the free-threaded
      build. OpenSSL operations are now protected by a per-object
      lock.
    - gh-124651: Properly quote template strings in venv
      activation scripts.
    - gh-124694: We’ve added
      concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor, which allows
      you to run code in multiple isolated interpreters. This
      allows you to circumvent the limitations of CPU-bound
      threads (due to the GIL). Patch by Eric Snow.
    - This addition is unrelated to PEP 734.
    - gh-58032: Deprecate the argparse.FileType type converter.
    - gh-99749: Adds a feature to optionally enable suggestions
      for argument choices and subparser names if mistyped by the
      user.
    - gh-58956: Fixed a bug in pdb where sometimes the breakpoint
      won’t trigger if it was set on a function which is already
      in the call stack.
    - gh-124111: The tkinter module can now be built to use
      either the new version 9.0.0 of Tcl/Tk or the latest
      release 8.6.15 of Tcl/Tk 8. Tcl/Tk 9 includes many
      improvements, both to the Tcl language and to the
      appearance and utility of the graphical user interface
      provided by Tk.
    - gh-80958: unittest discovery supports PEP 420 namespace
      packages as start directory again.
    - gh-123370: Fix the canvas not clearing after running
      turtledemo clock.
    - gh-89083: Add uuid.uuid8() for generating UUIDv8 objects as
      specified in RFC 9562. Patch by Bénédikt Tran
    - gh-122549: Add platform.invalidate_caches() to invalidate
      cached results.
    - gh-120754: Update unbounded read calls in zipfile to
      specify an explicit size putting a limit on how much data
      they may read. This also updates handling around ZIP max
      comment size to match the standard instead of reading
      comments that are one byte too long.
    - gh-121267: Improve the performance of tarfile when writing
      files, by caching user names and group names.
    - gh-70764: Fixed an issue where inspect.getclosurevars()
      would incorrectly classify an attribute name as a global
      variable when the name exists both as an attribute name and
      a global variable.
    - gh-118289: posixpath.realpath() now raises
      NotADirectoryError when strict mode is enabled and a
      non-directory path with a trailing slash is supplied.

      os.path.abspath() on Windows.
    - gh-97850: Remove deprecated pkgutil.get_loader() and
      pkgutil.find_loader().
    - gh-118986: Add socket.IPV6_RECVERR constant (available
      since Linux 2.2).
    - gh-116897: Accepting objects with false values (like 0 and
      []) except empty strings, byte-like objects and None in
      urllib.parse functions parse_qsl() and parse_qs() is now
      deprecated.
    - gh-101955: Fix SystemError when match regular expression
      pattern containing some combination of possessive
      quantifier, alternative and capture group.
    - gh-71936: Fix a race condition in

      frames from reported stacktraces.
    - gh-84852: Add MIME types for MS Embedded OpenType, OpenType
      Layout, TrueType, WOFF 1.0 and 2.0 fonts. Patch by Sahil
      Prajapati and Hugo van Kemenade.
  - Documentation
    - gh-126622: Added stub pages for removed modules explaining
      their removal, where to find replacements, and linking to
      the last Python version that supported them. Contributed by
      Ned Batchelder.
    - gh-125277: Require Sphinx 7.2.6 or later to build the
      Python documentation. Patch by Adam Turner.
    - gh-60712: Include the object type in the lists of
      documented types. Change by Furkan Onder and Martin Panter.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-126795: Increase the threshold for JIT code
      warmup. Depending on platform and workload, this can result
      in performance gains of 1-9% and memory savings of 3-5%.
    - gh-126341: Now ValueError is raised instead of SystemError
      when trying to iterate over a released memoryview object.
    - gh-126688: Fix a crash when calling os.fork() on some
      operating systems, including SerenityOS.
    - gh-126066: Fix importlib to not write an incomplete
      .pyc files when a ulimit or some other operating system
      mechanism is preventing the write to go through fully.
    - gh-126222: Do not include count of “peek” items in
      _PyUop_num_popped. This ensures that the correct number of
      items are popped from the stack when a micro-op exits with
      an error.
    - gh-126366: Fix crash when using yield from on an object
      that raises an exception in its __iter__.
    - gh-126209: Fix an issue with skip_file_prefixes parameter
      which resulted in an inconsistent behaviour between the C
      and Python implementations of warnings.warn(). Patch by
      Daehee Kim.
    - gh-126312: Fix crash during garbage collection on an object
      frozen by gc.freeze() on the free-threaded build.
    - gh-103951: Relax optimization requirements to allow fast
      attribute access to module subclasses.
    - gh-126072: Following gh-126101, for Code Objects like
      lambda, annotation and type alias, we no longer add None to
      its co_consts.
    - gh-126195: Improve JIT performance by 1.4% on macOS Apple
      Silicon by using platform-specific memory protection
      APIs. Patch by Diego Russo.
    - gh-126139: Provide better error location when attempting to
      use a future statement with an unknown future feature.
    - gh-126072: Add a new attribute in co_flags to indicate
      whether the first item in co_consts is the docstring. If a
      code object has no docstring, None will NOT be inserted.
    - gh-126076: Relocated objects such as tuple, bytes and
      str objects are properly tracked by tracemalloc and its
      associated hooks. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-90370: Avoid temporary tuple creation for vararg in
      argument passing with Argument Clinic generated code (if
      arguments either vararg or positional-only).
    - gh-126018: Fix a crash in sys.audit() when passing a
      non-string as first argument and Python was compiled in
      debug mode.
    - gh-126012: The memoryview type now supports subscription,
      making it a generic type.
    - gh-125837: Adds LOAD_SMALL_INT and LOAD_CONST_IMMORTAL
      instructions. LOAD_SMALL_INT pushes a small integer equal
      to the oparg to the stack. LOAD_CONST_IMMORTAL does the
      same as LOAD_CONST but is more efficient for immortal
      objects. Removes RETURN_CONST instruction.
    - gh-125942: On Android, the errors setting of sys.stdout was
      changed from surrogateescape to backslashreplace.
    - gh-125859: Fix a crash in the free threading build when
      gc.get_objects() or gc.get_referrers() is called during an
      in-progress garbage collection.
    - gh-125868: It was possible in 3.14.0a1 only for
      attribute lookup to give the wrong value. This was
      due to an incorrect specialization in very specific
      circumstances. This is fixed in 3.14.0a2.
    - gh-125498: The JIT has been updated to leverage Clang 19’s
      new preserve_none attribute, which supports more platforms
      and is more useful than LLVM’s existing ghccc calling
      convention. This also removes the need to manually patch
      the calling convention in LLVM IR, simplifying the JIT
      compilation process.
    - gh-125703: Correctly honour tracemalloc hooks in
      specialized Py_DECREF paths. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-125593: Use color to highlight error locations in
      traceback from exception group
    - gh-125017: Fix crash on certain accesses to the
      __annotations__ of staticmethod and classmethod objects.
    - gh-125588: The Python PEG generator can now use f-strings
      in the grammar actions. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-125444: Fix illegal instruction for older Arm
      architectures. Patch by Diego Russo, testing by Ross
      Burton.
    - gh-118423: Add a new INSTRUCTION_SIZE macro to the cases
      generator which returns the current instruction size.
    - gh-125038: Fix crash when iterating over a generator
      expression after direct changes on gi_frame.f_locals. Patch
      by Mikhail Efimov.
    - gh-124855: Don’t allow the JIT and perf support to be
      active at the same time. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-123714: Update JIT compilation to use LLVM 19
    - gh-123930: Improve the error message when a script
      shadowing a module from the standard library causes
      ImportError to be raised during a “from” import. Similarly,
      improve the error message when a script shadowing a third
      party module attempts to “from” import an attribute from
      that third party module while still initialising.
    - gh-119793: The map() built-in now has an optional
      keyword-only strict flag like zip() to check that all the
      iterables are of equal length. Patch by Wannes Boeykens.
    - gh-118950: Fix bug where SSLProtocol.connection_lost wasn’t
      getting called when OSError was thrown on writing to
      socket.
    - gh-113570: Fixed a bug in reprlib.repr where it incorrectly
      called the repr method on shadowed Python built-in types.
  - C API
    - gh-126554: Fix error handling in ctypes.CDLL objects which
      could result in a crash in rare situations.
    - gh-126061: Add PyLong_IsPositive(), PyLong_IsNegative() and
      PyLong_IsZero() for checking if a PyLongObject is positive,
      negative, or zero, respectively.
    - gh-125608: Fix a bug where dictionary watchers
      (e.g., PyDict_Watch()) on an object’s attribute dictionary
      (__dict__) were not triggered when the object’s attributes
      were modified.
    - gh-123619: Added the
      PyUnstable_Object_EnableDeferredRefcount() function for
      enabling PEP 703 deferred reference counting.
    - gh-121654: Add PyType_Freeze() function to make a type
      immutable. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-120026: The Py_HUGE_VAL macro is soft deprecated.
  - Build
    - gh-126691: Removed the --with-emscripten-target configure
      flag. We unified the node and browser options and the same
      build can now be used, independent of target runtime.
    - gh-123877: Use wasm32-wasip1 as the target triple for
      WASI instead of wasm32-wasi. The latter will eventually
      be reclaimed for WASI 1.0 while CPython currently only
      supports WASI preview1.
    - gh-126458: Disable SIMD support for HACL under WASI.
    - gh-89640: Hard-code float word ordering as little endian on
      WASM.
    - gh-126206: make clinic now runs Argument Clinic using the
      --force option, thus forcefully regenerating generated
      code.
    - gh-126187: Introduced Tools/wasm/emscripten.py to simplify
      doing Emscripten builds.
    - gh-124932: For cross builds, there is now support for
      having a different install prefix than the host_prefix used
      by getpath.py. This is set to / by default for Emscripten,
      on other platforms the default behavior is the same as
      before.
    - gh-125946: The minimum supported Android version is now 7.0
      (API level 24).
    - gh-125940: The Android build now supports 16 KB page sizes.
    - gh-89640: Improve detection of float word ordering on Linux
      when link-time optimizations are enabled.
    - gh-124928: Emscripten builds now require node >= 18.
    - gh-115382: Fix cross compile failures when the host and
      target SOABIs match.
- Remove upstreamed patches:
  - fix_test_generated_data.patch
  - fix_test_ftp_error.patch
  - gh125535-Lib_IntVector_Intrinsics_vec128.patch
- Don't limit clang to clang18.

Tue Oct  8 07:08:34 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 3.13.0:
  Major new features of the 3.13 series, compared to 3.12
  Some of the new major new features and changes in Python 3.13 are:
  - New features
    - A new and improved interactive interpreter, based on
      PyPy's, featuring multi-line editing and color support, as
      well as colorized exception tracebacks.
    - An experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables
      the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run
      more concurrently. The build mode is available as an
      experimental feature in the Windows and macOS installers as
      well.
    - A preliminary, experimental JIT, providing the ground work
      for significant performance improvements.
    - The locals() builtin function (and its C equivalent)
      now has well-defined semantics when mutating the
      returned mapping, which allows debuggers to operate more
      consistently.
    - A modified version of mimalloc is now included, optional
      but enabled by default if supported by the platform, and
      required for the free-threaded build mode.
    - Docstrings now have their leading indentation stripped,
      reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools
      handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)
    - The dbm module has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend that is used
      by default when creating new files.
    - WASI is now a Tier 2 supported platform. Emscripten is
      no longer an officially supported platform (but Pyodide
      continues to support Emscripten).
  - Typing
    - Support for type defaults in type parameters.
    - A new type narrowing annotation, typing.TypeIs.
    - A new annotation for read-only items in TypeDicts.
    - A new annotation for marking deprecations in the type
      system.
  - Removals and new deprecations
    - PEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library)
      scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc,
      audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib,
      nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau,
      telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.
    - Many other removals of deprecated classes, functions and
      methods in various standard library modules.
    - C API removals and deprecations. (Some removals present
      in alpha 1 were reverted in alpha 2, as the removals were
      deemed too disruptive at this time.)
    - New deprecations, most of which are scheduled for removal
      from Python 3.15 or 3.16.
  - For more details on the changes to Python 3.13, see What's
    new in Python 3.13 in the documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  1 15:40:31 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 3.13.0~rc3:
  - The most important change is rolling back the incremental
    cyclic garbage collector (GC), which was added in one of
    the alpha releases. The incremental GC had more significant
    performance regressions in specific workloads than we
    expected.
  - Tests
    - gh-124378: Updated test_ttk to pass with Tcl/Tk 8.6.15.
  - Library
    - gh-124538: Fixed crash when using gc.get_referents() on a
      capsule object.
    - gh-124498: Fix typing.TypeAliasType not to be generic, when
      type_params is an empty tuple.
    - gh-123017: Due to unreliable results on some devices,
      time.strftime() no longer accepts negative years on
      Android.
    - gh-123014: os.pidfd_open() and signal.pidfd_send_signal()
      are now unavailable when building against Android API
      levels older than 31, since the underlying system calls may
      cause a crash.
    - gh-124248: Fixed potential crash when using struct to
      process zero-width ‘Pascal string’ fields (0p).
    - gh-87041: Fix a bug in argparse where lengthy subparser
      argument help is incorrectly indented.
    - gh-124212: Fix invalid variable in venv handling of failed
      symlink on Windows
    - gh-124171: Add workaround for broken fmod() implementations
      on Windows, that loose zero sign (e.g. fmod(-10, 1) returns
      0.0). Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-123934: Fix unittest.mock.MagicMock reseting magic
      methods return values after .reset_mock(return_value=True)
      was called.
    - gh-123968: Fix the command-line interface for the random
      module to select floats between 0 and N, not 1 and N.
    - gh-123892: Add "_wmi" to sys.stdlib_module_names. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-123339: Fix inspect.getsource() for classes
      in collections.abc and decimal (for pure Python
      implementation) modules. inspect.getcomments() now raises
      OSError instead of IndexError if the __firstlineno__ value
      for a class is out of bound.
    - gh-121735: When working with zip archives,

  - Tests
    - gh-121084: Fix test_typing random leaks. Clear typing ABC

    - gh-120683: Fix an error in logging.LogRecord, when the
      integer part of the timestamp is rounded up, while the
      millisecond calculation truncates, causing the log
      timestamp to be wrong by up to 999 ms (affected roughly 1
      in 8 million timestamps).
    - gh-120633: Move scrollbar and remove tear-off menus in

      pager in such cases. Patch by Enrico Tröger.
    - gh-119577: The DeprecationWarning emitted when testing
      the truth value of an xml.etree.ElementTree.Element now
      describes unconditionally returning True in a future
      version rather than raising an exception in Python 3.14.

    - gh-115119: Fall back to the bundled libmpdec if a system version
      cannot be found.
    - gh-119132: Update sys.version to identify whether the build is
      default build or free-threading build. Patch By Donghee Na.
    - gh-118836: Fix an AssertionError when building with
      --enable-experimental-jit and the compiler emits a SHT_NOTE
      section.
    - gh-118943: Fix a possible race condition affecting parallel
      builds configured with --enable-experimental-jit, in which
      compilation errors could be caused by an incompletely-generated
      header file.
  - Windows
    - gh-119679: Ensures correct import libraries are included in
      Windows installs.
    - gh-119690: Adds Unicode support and fixes audit events for
      _winapi.CreateNamedPipe.
    - gh-111201: Add support for new pyrepl on Windows
    - gh-119070: Fixes py.exe handling of shebangs like /usr/bin/env
      python3.12, which were previously interpreted as python3.exe
      instead of python3.12.exe.
    - gh-117505: Fixes an issue with the Windows installer not running
      ensurepip in a fully isolated environment. This could cause
      unexpected interactions with the user site-packages.
    - gh-118209: Avoid crashing in mmap on Windows when the mapped
      memory is inaccessible due to file system errors or access
      violations.
    - gh-116145: Updated bundled Tcl/Tk to 8.6.14.
  - C API
    - gh-119585: Fix crash when a thread state that was created by
      PyGILState_Ensure() calls a destructor that during
      PyThreadState_Clear() that calls back into PyGILState_Ensure()
      and PyGILState_Release(). This might occur when in the
      free-threaded build or when using thread-local variables whose
      destructors call PyGILState_Ensure().
    - gh-119336: Restore the removed _PyLong_NumBits() function. It is
      used by the pywin32 project. Patch by Ethan Smith
    - gh-119247: Added Py_BEGIN_CRITICAL_SECTION_SEQUENCE_FAST and
      Py_END_CRITICAL_SECTION_SEQUENCE_FAST macros to make it possible
      to use PySequence_Fast APIs safely when free-threaded, and
      update str.join to work without the GIL using them.
    - gh-111389: Add PyHASH_MULTIPLIER constant: prime multiplier used
      in string and various other hashes. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116984: Make mimalloc includes relative to the current file
      to avoid embedders or extensions needing to include
      Internal/mimalloc if they are already including internal CPython
      headers.
    - gh-118789: Restore _PyWeakref_ClearRef that was previously
      removed in Python 3.13 alpha 1.

Thu May  9 08:18:00 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.13.0b1:
  - Security
    - gh-116741: Update bundled libexpat to 2.6.2
    - gh-117233: Detect BLAKE2, SHA3, Shake, & truncated SHA512 support
      in the OpenSSL-ish libcrypto library at build time. This allows
      hashlib to be used with libraries that do not to support every
      algorithm that upstream OpenSSL does.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-118414: Add instrumented opcodes to YIELD_VALUE assertion for
      tracing cases.
    - gh-117953: When a builtin or extension module is imported for
      the first time, while a subinterpreter is active, the module’s
      init function is now run by the main interpreter first before
      import continues in the subinterpreter. Consequently,
      single-phase init modules now fail in an isolated subinterpreter
      without the init function running under that interpreter,
      whereas before it would run under the subinterpreter before
      failing, potentially leaving behind global state and callbacks
      and otherwise leaving the module in an inconsistent state.
    - gh-117549: Don’t use designated initializer syntax in inline
      functions in internal headers. They cause problems for C++ or
      MSVC users who aren’t yet using the latest C++ standard (C++20).
      While internal, pycore_backoff.h, is included (indirectly, via
      pycore_code.h) by some key 3rd party software that does so for
      speed.
    - gh-95382: Improve performance of json.dumps() and json.dump()
      when using the argument indent. Depending on the data the
      encoding using json.dumps() with indent can be up to 2 to 3
      times faster.
    - gh-116322: In --disable-gil builds, the GIL will be enabled
      while loading C extension modules. If the module indicates that
      it supports running without the GIL, the GIL will be disabled
      once loading is complete. Otherwise, the GIL will remain enabled
      for the remainder of the interpreter’s lifetime. This behavior
      does not apply if the GIL has been explicitly enabled or
      disabled with PYTHON_GIL or -Xgil.
    - gh-118513: Fix incorrect UnboundLocalError when two
      comprehensions in the same function both reference the same
      name, and in one comprehension the name is bound while in the
      other it’s an implicit global.
    - gh-118518: Allow the Linux perf support to work without frame
      pointers using perf’s advanced JIT support. The feature is
      activated when using the PYTHON_PERF_JIT_SUPPORT environment
      variable or when running Python with -Xperf_jit. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo.
    - gh-117514: Add sys._is_gil_enabled() function that returns
      whether the GIL is currently enabled. In the default build it
      always returns True because the GIL is always enabled. In the
      free-threaded build, it may return True or False.
    - gh-118164: Break a loop between the Python implementation of the
      decimal module and the Python code for integer to string
      conversion. Also optimize integer to string conversion for
      values in the range from 9_000 to 135_000 decimal digits.
    - gh-118473: Fix sys.set_asyncgen_hooks() not to be partially set
      when raising TypeError.
    - gh-118465: Compiler populates the new __firstlineno__ field on a
      class with the line number of the first line of the class
      definition.
    - gh-118492: Fix an issue where the type cache can expose a
      previously accessed attribute when a finalizer is run.
    - gh-117714: update async_generator.athrow().close() and
      async_generator.asend().close() to close their section of the
      underlying async generator
    - gh-111201: The interactive interpreter is now implemented in
      Python, which allows for a number of new features like colors,
      multiline input, history viewing, and paste mode. Contributed by
      Pablo Galindo, Łukasz Langa and Lysandros Nikolaou based on code
      from the PyPy project.
    - gh-74929: Implement PEP 667: converted FrameType.f_locals and
      PyFrame_GetLocals() to return a write-through proxy object when
      the frame refers to a function or comprehension.
    - gh-116767: Fix crash in compiler on ‘async with’ that has many
      context managers.
    - gh-118335: Change how to use the tier 2 interpreter. Instead of
      running Python with -X uops or setting the environment variable
      PYTHON_UOPS=1, this choice is now made at build time by
      configuring with --enable-experimental-jit=interpreter.
    - Beware! This changes the environment variable to enable or
      disable micro-ops to PYTHON_JIT. The old PYTHON_UOPS is no
      longer used.
    - gh-118306: Update JIT compilation to use LLVM 18
    - gh-118160: Annotation scopes within classes can now contain
      comprehensions. However, such comprehensions are not inlined
      into their parent scope at runtime. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-118272: Fix bug where generator.close does not free the
      generator frame’s locals.
    - gh-118216: Don’t consider __future__ imports with dots before
      the module name.
    - gh-118074: Make sure that the Executor objects in the COLD_EXITS
      array aren’t assumed to be GC-able (which would access bytes
      outside the object).
    - gh-107674: Lazy load frame line number to improve performance of
      tracing
    - gh-118082: Improve SyntaxError message for imports without
      names, like in from x import and import cases. It now points out
      to users that import expects at least one name after it.
    - gh-118090: Improve SyntaxError message for empty type param
      brackets.
    - gh-102511: Speed up os.path.splitroot() with a native
      implementation.
    - gh-117958: Added a get_jit_code() method to access JIT compiled
      machine code from the UOp Executor when the experimental JIT is
      enabled. Patch by Anthony Shaw.
    - gh-117901: Add option for compiler’s codegen to save nested
      instruction sequences for introspection.
    - gh-116622: Redirect stdout and stderr to system log when
      embedded in an Android app.
    - gh-109118: annotation scope within class scopes can now contain
      lambdas.
    - gh-117894: Prevent agen.aclose() objects being re-used after
      .throw().
    - gh-117881: prevent concurrent access to an async generator via
      athrow().throw() or asend().throw()
    - gh-115874: Fixed a possible segfault during garbage collection
      of _asyncio.FutureIter objects
    - gh-117536: Fix a RuntimeWarning when calling
      agen.aclose().throw(Exception).
    - gh-117755: Fix mimalloc allocator for huge memory allocation
      (around 8,589,934,592 GiB) on s390x. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117750: Fix issue where an object’s dict would get out of
      sync with the object’s internal values when being cleared.
      obj.__dict__.clear() now clears the internal values, but leaves
      the dict attached to the object.
    - gh-117431: Improve the performance of the following bytes and
      bytearray methods by adapting them to the METH_FASTCALL calling
      convention:
        count()
        find()
        index()
        rfind()
        rindex()
    - gh-117709: Speed up calls to str() with positional-only
      argument, by using the PEP 590 vectorcall calling convention.
      Patch by Erlend Aasland.
    - gh-117680: Give _PyInstructionSequence a Python interface and
      use it in tests.
    - gh-115776: Statically allocated objects are, by definition,
      immortal so must be marked as such regardless of whether they
      are in extension modules or not.
    - gh-117641: Speedup os.path.commonpath() on Unix.
    - gh-117636: Speedup os.path.join().
    - gh-117607: Speedup os.path.relpath().
    - gh-117385: Remove unhandled PY_MONITORING_EVENT_BRANCH and
      PY_MONITORING_EVENT_EXCEPTION_HANDLED events from
      sys.settrace().
    - gh-116322: Extension modules may indicate to the runtime that
      they can run without the GIL. Multi-phase init modules do so by
      calling providing Py_MOD_GIL_NOT_USED for the Py_mod_gil slot,
      while single-phase init modules call
      PyUnstable_Module_SetGIL(mod, Py_MOD_GIL_NOT_USED) from their
      init function.
    - gh-116129: Implement PEP 696, adding support for defaults on
      type parameters. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-93502: Add two new functions to the C-API,
      PyRefTracer_SetTracer() and PyRefTracer_GetTracer(), that allows
      to track object creation and destruction the same way the
      tracemalloc module does. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-107674: Improved the performance of sys.settrace()
      significantly
    - gh-95754: Improve the error message when a script shadowing a
      module from the standard library causes AttributeError to be
      raised. Similarly, improve the error message when a script
      shadowing a third party module attempts to access an attribute
      from that third party module while still initialising.
    - gh-99180: Elide uninformative traceback indicators in return and
      simple assignment statements. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-105879: Allow the globals and locals arguments to exec() and
      eval() to be passed as keywords.
  - Library
    - gh-118418: A DeprecationWarning is now emitted if you fail to
      pass a value to the new type_params parameter of
      typing._eval_type() or typing.ForwardRef._evaluate(). (Using
      either of these private and undocumented functions is
      discouraged to begin with, but failing to pass a value to the
      type_params parameter may lead to incorrect behaviour on Python
      3.12 or newer.)
    - gh-118660: Add an optional second type parameter to
      typing.ContextManager and typing.AsyncContextManager,
      representing the return types of __exit__() and __aexit__()
      respectively. This parameter defaults to bool | None.
    - gh-118650: The enum module allows method named _repr_* to be
      defined on Enum types.
    - gh-118648: Add type parameter defaults to typing.Generator and
      typing.AsyncGenerator.
    - gh-101137: Mime type text/x-rst is now supported by mimetypes.
    - gh-118164: The Python implementation of the decimal module could
      appear to hang in relatively small power cases (like 2**117) if
      context precision was set to a very high value. A different
      method to check for exactly representable results is used now
      that doesn’t rely on computing 10**precision (which could be
      effectively too large to compute).
    - gh-111744: breakpoint() and pdb.set_trace() now enter the
      debugger immediately after the call rather than before the next
      line is executed.
    - gh-118500: Add pdb support for zipapps
    - gh-118406: Add signature for sqlite3.Connection objects.
    - gh-101732: Use a Y2038 compatible openssl time function when
      available.
    - gh-118404: Fix inspect.signature() for non-comparable callables.
    - gh-118402: Fix inspect.signature() for the result of the
      functools.cmp_to_key() call.
    - gh-116622: On Android, sysconfig.get_platform now returns the
      format specified by PEP 738.
    - gh-118285: Allow to specify the signature of custom callable
      instances of extension type by the __text_signature__ attribute.
      Specify signatures of operator.attrgetter, operator.itemgetter,
      and operator.methodcaller instances.
    - gh-118314: Fix an edge case in binascii.a2b_base64() strict
      mode, where excessive padding is not detected when no padding is
      necessary.
    - gh-118271: Add the PhotoImage methods read() to read an image
      from a file and data() to get the image data. Add background and
      grayscale parameters to PhotoImage method write().
    - gh-118225: Add the PhotoImage method copy_replace() to copy a
      region from one image to other image, possibly with pixel
      zooming and/or subsampling. Add from_coords parameter to
      PhotoImage methods copy(), zoom() and subsample(). Add zoom and
      subsample parameters to PhotoImage method copy().
    - gh-118221: Fix a bug where sqlite3.Connection.iterdump() could
      fail if a custom row factory was used. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
    - gh-118013: Fix regression introduced in gh-103193 that meant
      that calling inspect.getattr_static() on an instance would cause
      a strong reference to that instance’s class to persist in an
      internal cache in the inspect module. This caused unexpected
      memory consumption if the class was dynamically created, the
      class held strong references to other objects which took up a
      significant amount of memory, and the cache contained the sole
      strong reference to the class. The fix for the regression leads
      to a slowdown in getattr_static(), but the function should still
      be significantly faster than it was in Python 3.11. Patch by
      Alex Waygood.
    - gh-118218: Speed up itertools.pairwise() in the common case by
      up to 1.8x.
    - gh-117486: Improve the behavior of user-defined subclasses of
      ast.AST. Such classes will now require no changes in the usual
      case to conform with the behavior changes of the ast module in
      Python 3.13. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-90848: Fixed unittest.mock.create_autospec() to configure
      parent mock with keyword arguments.
    - gh-118168: Fix incorrect argument substitution when
      typing.Unpack is used with the builtin tuple. typing.Unpack now
      raises TypeError when used with certain invalid types. Patch by
      Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-118131: Add command-line interface for the random module.
      Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-118107: Fix zipimport reading of ZIP64 files with file
      entries that are too big or offset too far.
    - gh-117535: Change the unknown filename of warnings from sys to
      <sys> to clarify that it’s not a real filename.
    - gh-114053: Fix erroneous NameError when calling
      typing.get_type_hints() on a class that made use of PEP 695 type
      parameters in a module that had from __future__ import
      annotations at the top of the file. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-116931: Add parameter fileobj check for
      tarfile.TarFile.addfile()
    - gh-117995: Don’t raise DeprecationWarning when a sequence of
      parameters is used to bind indexed, nameless placeholders. See
      also gh-100668.
    - gh-80361: Fix TypeError in email.Message.get_payload() when the
      charset is RFC 2231 encoded.
    - gh-86650: Fix IndexError when parse some emails with invalid
      Message-ID (including one-off addresses generated by Microsoft
      Outlook).
    - gh-117691: Improve the error messages emitted by tarfile
      deprecation warnings relating to PEP 706. If a filter argument
      is not provided to extract() or extractall, the deprecation
      warning now points to the line in the user’s code where the
      relevant function was called. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-115060: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by omitting an initial
      is_dir() call. As a result of this change, glob() can no longer
      raise OSError.
    - gh-77102: site module now parses .pth file with UTF-8 first, and
      locale encoding if UnicodeDecodeError happened. It supported
      only locale encoding before.
    - gh-76785: We’ve exposed the low-level _interpreters module for
      the sake of the PyPI implementation of PEP 734. It was sometimes
      available as the _xxsubinterpreters module and was formerly used
      only for testing. For the most part, it should be considered an
      internal module, like _thread and _imp. See
      https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-734-multiple-interpreters-in-the-stdlib/41147/26.
    - gh-115060: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by not scanning
      directories for non-wildcard pattern segments.
    - gh-117727: Speed up pathlib.Path.iterdir() by using os.scandir()
      internally.
    - gh-117586: Speed up pathlib.Path.walk() by working with strings
      internally.
    - gh-117722: Change the new multi-separator support in
      asyncio.Stream.readuntil() to only accept tuples of separators
      rather than arbitrary iterables.
    - gh-117692: Fixes a bug when doctest.DocTestFinder was failing on
      wrapped builtin_function_or_method.
    - gh-117348: Largely restored import time performance of
      configparser by avoiding dataclasses.
    - gh-117663: Fix _simple_enum to detect aliases when multiple
      arguments are present but only one is the member value.
    - gh-117618: Support package.module as filename for break command
      of pdb
    - gh-102247: the status codes enum with constants in
      http.HTTPStatus are updated to include the names from RFC9110.
      This RFC includes some HTTP statuses previously only used for
      WEBDAV and assigns more generic names to them.
    - The old constants are preserved for backwards compatibility.
    - gh-117586: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by working with strings
      internally.
    - gh-117225: Add colour to doctest output. Patch by Hugo van
      Kemenade.
    - gh-117566: ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_loopback() will now return
      True for IPv4-mapped loopback addresses, i.e. addresses in the
      ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104 address space.
    - gh-117546: Fix issue where os.path.realpath() stopped resolving
      symlinks after encountering a symlink loop on POSIX.
    - gh-116720: Improved behavior of asyncio.TaskGroup when an
      external cancellation collides with an internal cancellation.
      For example, when two task groups are nested and both experience
      an exception in a child task simultaneously, it was possible
      that the outer task group would misbehave, because its internal
      cancellation was swallowed by the inner task group.
    - In the case where a task group is cancelled externally and also
      must raise an ExceptionGroup, it will now call the parent task’s
      cancel() method. This ensures that a asyncio.CancelledError will
      be raised at the next await, so the cancellation is not lost.
    - An added benefit of these changes is that task groups now
      preserve the cancellation count (asyncio.Task.cancelling()).
    - In order to handle some corner cases, asyncio.Task.uncancel()
      may now reset the undocumented _must_cancel flag when the
      cancellation count reaches zero.
    - gh-117516: Add typing.TypeIs, implementing PEP 742. Patch by
      Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-117503: Fix support of non-ASCII user names in bytes paths in
      os.path.expanduser() on Posix.
    - gh-117394: os.path.ismount() is now 2-3 times faster if the user
      has permissions.
    - gh-117313: Only treat '\n', '\r' and '\r\n' as line separators
      in re-folding the email messages. Preserve control characters
      '\v', '\f', '\x1c', '\x1d' and '\x1e' and Unicode line
      separators '\x85', '\u2028' and '\u2029' as is.
    - gh-117142: Convert _ctypes to multi-phase initialisation (PEP
      489).
    - gh-66543: Add the mimetypes.guess_file_type() function which
      works with file path. Passing file path instead of URL in
      guess_type() is soft deprecated.
    - gh-68583: webbrowser CLI: replace getopt with argparse, add long
      options. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-116871: Name suggestions for AttributeError and ImportError
      now only include underscored names if the original name was
      underscored.
    - gh-116023: Don’t show empty fields (value None or []) in
      ast.dump() by default. Add show_empty=False parameter to
      optionally show them.
    - gh-115961: Added name and mode attributes for compressed and
      archived file-like objects in modules bz2, lzma, tarfile and
      zipfile. The value of the mode attribute of gzip.GzipFile was
      changed from integer (1 or 2) to string ('rb' or 'wb'). The
      value of the mode attribute of the readable file-like object
      returned by zipfile.ZipFile.open() was changed from 'r' to 'rb'.

    - gh-109617: ncurses: fixed a crash that could occur on macOS 13
      or earlier when Python was built with Apple Xcode 15’s SDK.
    - gh-83151: Enabled arbitrary statements and evaluations in pdb
      shell to access the local variables of the current frame, which
      made it possible for multi-scope code like generators or nested
      function to work.
    - gh-110209: Add __class_getitem__() to types.GeneratorType and
      types.CoroutineType for type hinting purposes. Patch by James
      Hilton-Balfe.

      fix minor bug related to floating point math.
    - gh-100242: Bring pure Python implementation
      functools.partial.__new__ more in line with the C-implementation
      by not just always checking for the presence of the attribute
      'func' on the first argument of partial. Instead, both the
      Python version and the C version perform an isinstance(func,
      partial) check on the first argument of partial.
    - gh-99730: HEAD requests are no longer upgraded to GET request
      during redirects in urllib.
    - gh-66410: Callbacks registered in the tkinter module now take
      arguments as various Python objects (int, float, bytes, tuple),
      not just str. To restore the previous behavior set tkinter
      module global wantobject to 1 before creating the Tk object or
      call the wantobject() method of the Tk object with argument 1.
      Calling it with argument 2 restores the current default
      behavior.

  - Documentation
    - gh-117928: The minimum Sphinx version required for the
      documentation is now 6.2.1.
  - Build

      through the build.bat script) without specifying a value for
      UseTIER2.
    - gh-115119: The configure option --with-system-libmpdec now
      defaults to yes. The bundled copy of libmpdecimal will be
      removed in Python 3.15.
    - gh-117845: Fix building against recent libedit versions by
      detecting readline hook signatures in configure.

      Android.
    - gh-117645: Increase WASI stack size from 512 KiB to 8 MiB and
      the initial memory from 10 MiB to 20 MiB. Patch by Victor

    - gh-115119: configure now uses pkg-config to detect decimal
      dependencies if the --with-system-libmpdec option is given.
  - Windows
    - gh-115119: Update Windows installer to use libmpdecimal 4.0.0.

    - gh-90329: Suppress the warning displayed on virtual environment
      creation when the requested and created paths differ only by a
      short (8.3 style) name. Warnings will continue to be shown if a
      junction or symlink in the path caused the venv to be created in
      a different location than originally requested.
    - gh-117786: Fixes virtual environments not correctly launching
      when created from a Store install.
  - macOS
    - gh-115119: Update macOS installer to use libmpdecimal 4.0.0.

        Py_SetPythonHome()
        Py_SetProgramName()
        PySys_SetArgvEx()
        PySys_SetArgv()
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117929: Restore removed PyEval_InitThreads() function. Patch
      by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117534: Improve validation logic in the C implementation of
      datetime.datetime.fromisoformat() to better handle invalid
      years. Patch by Vlad Efanov.
    - gh-68114: Fixed skipitem()’s handling of the old ‘w’ and ‘w#’
      formatters. These are no longer supported and now raise an
      exception if used.
    - gh-111997: Add a C-API for firing monitoring events.

- Python 3.13.0 alpha 6:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-117648: Improve performance of os.path.join() and
      os.path.expanduser().
    - gh-117584: Raise TypeError for non-paths in posixpath.relpath().
    - gh-117494: Refactored the instruction sequence data structure
      out of compile.c into instruction_sequence.c.
    - gh-116968: Introduce a unified 16-bit backoff counter type
      (_Py_BackoffCounter), shared between the Tier 1 adaptive
      specializer and the Tier 2 optimizer. The API used for adaptive
      specialization counters is changed but the behavior is (supposed
      to be) identical.
    - The behavior of the Tier 2 counters is changed:
        There are no longer dynamic thresholds (we never varied these).
        All counters now use the same exponential backoff.
        The counter for JUMP_BACKWARD starts counting down from 16.
        The temperature in side exits starts counting down from 64.
    - gh-117431: Improve the performance of the following bytes and
      bytearray methods by adapting them to the METH_FASTCALL calling
      convention:
        endswith()
        startswith()
    - gh-117431: Improve the performance of the following str methods
      by adapting them to the METH_FASTCALL calling convention:
        count()
        endswith()
        find()
        index()
        rfind()
        rindex()
        startswith()
    - gh-117411: Move PyFutureFeatures to an internal header and make
      it private.
    - gh-109120: Added handle of incorrect star expressions, e.g f(3,
      *). Patch by Grigoryev Semyon
    - gh-117381: Fix error message for ntpath.commonpath().
    - gh-117349: Optimise several functions in os.path.
    - gh-117335: Raise TypeError for non-sequences for
      ntpath.commonpath().
    - gh-117266: Fix crashes for certain user-created subclasses of
      ast.AST. Such classes are now expected to set the _field_types
      attribute.
    - gh-99108: Updated the hashlib built-in HACL* project C code from
      upstream that we use for many implementations when they are not
      present via OpenSSL in a given build. This also avoids the rare
      potential for a C symbol name one definition rule linking issue.
    - gh-117108: Change the old space bit of objects in the young
      generation from 0 to gcstate->visited, so that any objects
      created during GC will have the old bit set correctly if they
      get moved into the old generation.
    - gh-117108: The cycle GC now chooses the size of increments based
      on the total heap size, instead of the rate of object creation.
      This ensures that it can keep up with growing heaps.
    - gh-117114: Make os.path.isdevdrive() available on all platforms.
      For those that do not offer Dev Drives, it will always return
      False.
    - gh-116735: For INSTRUMENTED_CALL_FUNCTION_EX, set arg0 to
      sys.monitoring.MISSING instead of None for CALL event.
    - gh-113964: Starting new threads and process creation through
      os.fork() are now only prevented once all non-daemon threads
      exit.
    - gh-116626: Ensure INSTRUMENTED_CALL_FUNCTION_EX always emits
      CALL
    - gh-116554: list.sort() now exploits more cases of partial
      ordering, particularly those with long descending runs with
      sub-runs of equal values. Those are recognized as single runs
      now (previously, each block of repeated values caused a new run
      to be created).
    - gh-114099: Added a Loader that can discover extension modules in
      an iOS-style Frameworks folder.
    - gh-115775: Compiler populates the new __static_attributes__
      field on a class with the names of attributes of this class
      which are accessed through self.X from any function in its body.
    - gh-115776: The array of values, the PyDictValues struct is now
      embedded in the object during allocation. This provides better
      performance in the common case, and does not degrade as much
      when the object’s __dict__ is materialized.
    - gh-108362: Implement an incremental cyclic garbage collector. By
      collecting the old generation in increments, there is no need
      for a full heap scan. This can hugely reduce maximum pause time
      for programs with large heaps.
    - Reduce the number of generations from three to two. The old
      generation is split into two spaces, “visited” and “pending”.
    - Collection happens in two steps:: * An increment is formed from
      the young generation and a small part of the pending space. *
      This increment is scanned and the survivors moved to the end of
      the visited space.
    - When the collecting space becomes empty, the two spaces are
      swapped.
    - gh-109870: Dataclasses now calls exec() once per dataclass,
      instead of once per method being added. This can speed up
      dataclass creation by up to 20%.
    - gh-97901: Mime type text/rtf is now supported by mimetypes.
    - bpo-24612: Improve the SyntaxError that happens when ‘not’
      appears after an operator. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Library
    - gh-117467: Preserve mailbox ownership when rewriting in
      mailbox.mbox.flush(). Patch by Tony Mountifield.
    - gh-114848: Raise FileNotFoundError when getcwd() returns
      ‘(unreachable)’, which can happen on Linux >= 2.6.36 with glibc
      < 2.27.
    - gh-117459: asyncio.asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe() now keeps
      the traceback of CancelledError, TimeoutError and
      InvalidStateError which are raised in the coroutine.
    - gh-117337: Deprecate undocumented glob.glob0() and glob.glob1()
      functions. Use glob.glob() and pass a directory to its root_dir
      argument instead.
    - gh-117348: Refactored configparser.RawConfigParser._read() to
      reduce cyclometric complexity and improve comprehensibility.
    - gh-66449: configparser.ConfigParser now accepts unnamed sections
      before named ones, if configured to do so.
    - gh-88014: In documentation of gzip.GzipFile in module gzip,
      explain data type of optional constructor argument mtime, and
      recommend mtime = 0 for generating deterministic streams.
    - gh-117310: Fixed an unlikely early & extra Py_DECREF triggered
      crash in ssl when creating a new _ssl._SSLContext if CPython was
      built implausibly such that the default cipher list is empty or
      the SSL library it was linked against reports a failure from its
      C SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list() API.
    - gh-117294: A DocTestCase now reports as skipped if all examples
      in the doctest are skipped.
    - gh-98966: In subprocess, raise a more informative message when
      stdout=STDOUT.
    - gh-117225: doctest: only print “and X failed” when non-zero,
      don’t pluralise “1 items”. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-117205: Speed up compileall.compile_dir() by 20% when using
      multiprocessing by increasing chunksize.
    - gh-117178: Fix regression in lazy loading of self-referential
      modules, introduced in gh-114781.
    - gh-112383: Fix dis module’s handling of ENTER_EXECUTOR
      instructions.
    - gh-117182: Lazy-loading of modules that modify their own
      __class__ no longer reverts the __class__ to types.ModuleType.
    - gh-117084: Fix zipfile extraction for directory entries with the
      name containing backslashes on Windows.
    - gh-117110: Fix a bug that prevents subclasses of typing.Any to
      be instantiated with arguments. Patch by Chris Fu.
    - gh-109653: Deferred select imports in importlib.metadata and
      importlib.resources for a 14% speedup.
    - gh-70647: Start the deprecation period for the current behavior
      of datetime.datetime.strptime() and time.strptime() which always
      fails to parse a date string with a ValueError involving a day
      of month such as strptime("02-29", "%m-%d") when a year is not
      specified and the date happen to be February 29th. This should
      help avoid users finding new bugs every four years due to a
      natural mistaken assumption about the API when parsing partial
      date values.
    - gh-116987: Fixed inspect.findsource() for class code objects.
    - gh-114099: Modify standard library to allow for iOS platform
      differences.
    - gh-90872: On Windows, subprocess.Popen.wait() no longer calls
      WaitForSingleObject() with a negative timeout: pass 0 ms if the
      timeout is negative. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116957: configparser: Don’t leave ConfigParser values in an
      invalid state (stored as a list instead of a str) after an
      earlier read raised DuplicateSectionError or
      DuplicateOptionError.
    - gh-115538: _io.WindowsConsoleIO now emit a warning if a boolean
      value is passed as a filedescriptor argument.
    - gh-90095: Ignore empty lines and comments in .pdbrc
    - gh-106531: Refreshed zipfile._path from zipp 3.18, providing
      better compatibility for PyPy, better glob performance for
      deeply nested zipfiles, and providing internal access to
      CompleteDirs.inject for use in other tests (like
      importlib.resources).
    - gh-63207: On Windows, time.time() now uses the
      GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime() clock to have a resolution
      better than 1 us, instead of the GetSystemTimeAsFileTime() clock
      which has a resolution of 15.6 ms. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116764: Restore support of None and other false values in
      urllib.parse functions parse_qs() and parse_qsl(). Also, they
      now raise a TypeError for non-zero integers and non-empty
      sequences.
    - gh-116811: In PathFinder.invalidate_caches, delegate to
      MetadataPathFinder.invalidate_caches.
    - gh-116647: Fix recursive child in dataclasses
    - gh-113171: Fixed various false positives and false negatives in
        ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private (see these docs for details)
        ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_global
        ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_private
        ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_global
        - Also in the corresponding ipaddress.IPv4Network and
          ipaddress.IPv6Network attributes.
        - Fixes bsc#1226448 (CVE-2024-4032).
    - gh-63283: In encodings.idna, any capitalization of the the ACE
      prefix (xn--) is now acceptable. Patch by Pepijn de Vos and
      Zackery Spytz.
    - gh-71042: Add platform.android_ver(), which provides device and
      OS information on Android.
    - gh-73468: Added new math.fma() function, wrapping C99’s fma()
      operation: fused multiply-add function. Patch by Mark Dickinson
      and Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116608: The importlib.resources functions is_resource(),
      open_binary(), open_text(), path(), read_binary(), and
      read_text() are un-deprecated, and support subdirectories via
      multiple positional arguments. The contents() function also
      allows subdirectories, but remains deprecated.
    - gh-116484: Change automatically generated tkinter.Checkbutton
      widget names to avoid collisions with automatically generated
      tkinter.ttk.Checkbutton widget names within the same parent
      widget.
    - gh-114314: In ctypes, ctype data is now stored in type objects
      directly rather than in a dict subclass. This is an internal
      change that should not affect usage.
    - gh-116401: Fix blocking os.fwalk() and shutil.rmtree() on
      opening named pipe.
    - gh-71052: Implement ctypes.util.find_library() on Android.
    - gh-90535: Fix support of interval values > 1 in
      logging.TimedRotatingFileHandler for when='MIDNIGHT' and
      when='Wx'.
    - gh-113308: Remove some internal protected parts from uuid:
      _has_uuid_generate_time_safe, _netbios_getnode,
      _ipconfig_getnode, and _load_system_functions. They were unused.
    - gh-115627: Fix the ssl module error handling of connection
      terminate by peer. It now throws an OSError with the appropriate
      error code instead of an EOFError.
    - gh-114847: Speed up os.path.realpath() on non-Windows platforms.
    - gh-114271: Fix a race in threading.Thread.join().
    - threading._MainThread now always represents the main thread of
      the main interpreter.
    - PyThreadState.on_delete and PyThreadState.on_delete_data have
      been removed.
    - gh-113538: Add asyncio.Server.close_clients() and
      asyncio.Server.abort_clients() methods which allow to more
      forcefully close an asyncio server.
    - gh-85287: Changes Unicode codecs to return UnicodeEncodeError or
      UnicodeDecodeError, rather than just UnicodeError.
    - gh-113548: pdb now allows CLI arguments to pdb -m.
    - gh-112948: Make completion of pdb similar to Python REPL
    - gh-105866: Fixed _get_slots bug which caused error when defining
      dataclasses with slots and a weakref_slot.
    - gh-96471: Add asyncio.Queue termination with shutdown() method.
    - gh-89739: The zipimport module can now read ZIP64 files.
    - bpo-33533: asyncio.as_completed() now returns an object that is
      both an asynchronous iterator and plain iterator. The new
      asynchronous iteration pattern allows for easier correlation
      between prior tasks and their completed results. This is a
      closer match to concurrent.futures.as_completed()’s iteration
      pattern. Patch by Justin Arthur.
    - bpo-27578: inspect.getsource() (and related functions) work with
      empty module files, returning '\n' (or reasonable equivalent)
      instead of raising OSError. Patch by Kernc.
    - bpo-37141: Accept an iterable of separators in
      asyncio.StreamReader.readuntil(), stopping when one of them is
      encountered.
    - gh-66543: Make mimetypes.guess_type() properly parsing of URLs
      with only a host name, URLs containing fragment or query, and
      filenames with only a UNC sharepoint on Windows. Based on patch
      by Dong-hee Na.
    - bpo-15010: unittest.TestLoader.discover() now saves the original
      value of unittest.TestLoader._top_level_dir and restores it at
      the end of the call.
  - Documentation
    - gh-115977: Remove compatibilty references to Emscripten.
    - gh-114099: Add an iOS platform guide, and flag modules not
      available on iOS.
    - gh-91565: Changes to documentation files and config outputs to
      reflect the new location for reporting bugs - i.e. GitHub rather
      than bugs.python.org.
  - Tests
    - gh-83434: Disable JUnit XML output (--junit-xml=FILE command
      line option) in regrtest when hunting for reference leaks (-R
      option). Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117187: Fix XML tests for vanilla Expat <2.6.0.
    - gh-116333: Tests of TLS related things (error codes, etc) were
      updated to be more lenient about specific error message strings
      and behaviors as seen in the BoringSSL and AWS-LC forks of
      OpenSSL.
    - gh-117089: Consolidated tests for importlib.metadata in their
      own metadata package.
    - gh-115979: Update test_importlib so that it passes under WASI
      SDK 21.
    - gh-112536: Add –tsan to test.regrtest for running TSAN tests in
      reasonable execution times. Patch by Donghee Na.
    - gh-116307: Added import helper isolated_modules as CleanImport
      does not remove modules imported during the context. Use it in
      importlib.resources tests to avoid leaving mod around to impede
      importlib.metadata tests.
  - Build
    - gh-114736: Have WASI builds use WASI SDK 21.
    - gh-115983: Skip building test modules that must be built as
      shared under WASI.
    - gh-71052: Add Android build script and instructions.
  - Windows
    - gh-117267: Ensure DirEntry.stat().st_ctime behaves consistently
      with os.stat() during the deprecation period of st_ctime by
      containing the same value as st_birthtime. After the deprecation
      period, st_ctime will be the metadata change time (or
      unavailable through DirEntry), and only st_birthtime will
      contain the creation time.
    - gh-116195: Improves performance of os.getppid() by using an
      alternate system API when available. Contributed by vxiiduu.
    - gh-88494: On Windows, time.monotonic() now uses the
      QueryPerformanceCounter() clock to have a resolution better than

- Update to 3.13.0a5:
  - Security
    - gh-115398: Allow controlling Expat >=2.6.0 reparse deferral
      (CVE-2023-52425) by adding five new methods:
        xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser.flush()
        xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser.flush()
        xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.GetReparseDeferralEnabled()
        xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.SetReparseDeferralEnabled()
        xml.sax.expatreader.ExpatParser.flush()
    - gh-114572: ssl.SSLContext.cert_store_stats() and
      ssl.SSLContext.get_ca_certs() now correctly lock access to
      the certificate store, when the ssl.SSLContext is shared
      across multiple threads.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-116604: Respect the status of the garbage collector when
      indirect calls are made via PyErr_CheckSignals() and the
      evaluation breaker. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112087: list is now compatible with the implementation
      of PEP 703.
    - gh-116381: Add specialization for CONTAINS_OP.
    - gh-116296: Fix possible refleak in object.__reduce__()
      internal error handling.
    - gh-115823: Properly calculate error ranges in the parser
      when raising SyntaxError exceptions caused by invalid byte
      sequences. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-115778: Add tierN annotation for instruction definition
      in interpreter DSL.
    - gh-115733: Fix crash when calling next() on exhausted list
      iterators.
    - gh-115700: The regen-cases build stage now works on
      Windows.
    - gh-115347: Fix bug where docstring was replaced by a
      redundant NOP when Python is run with -OO.
    - gh-115323: Make error message more meaningful for when
      bytearray.extend() is called with a str object.
    - gh-112175: Every PyThreadState now has its own
      eval_breaker, allowing specific threads to be interrupted.
    - gh-115154: Fix a bug that was causing the
      tokenize.untokenize() function to handle unicode named
      literals incorrectly. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112433: Add ability to force alignment of
      ctypes.Structure by way of the new _align_ attribute on the
      class.
    - gh-104090: The multiprocessing resource tracker now
      exits with non-zero status code if a resource leak was
      detected. It still exits with status code 0 otherwise.
    - gh-105858: Improve the constructors for ast
      nodes. Arguments of list types now default to an empty list
      if omitted, and optional fields default to None. AST nodes
      now have an __annotations__ attribute with the expected
      types of their attributes. Passing unrecognized extra
      arguments to AST nodes is deprecated and will become an
      error in Python 3.15. Omitting a required argument to an
      AST node is deprecated and will become an error in Python
      3.15. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-101860: Expose __name__ attribute on property.
    - gh-96497: Fix incorrect resolution of mangled class
      variables used in assignment expressions in comprehensions.
  - Library
    - gh-116600: Fix repr() for global Flag members.
    - gh-116349: platform.java_ver() is deprecated and will be
      removed in 3.15. It was largely untested, had a confusing
      API, and was only useful for Jython support.
    - gh-116143: Fix a race in pydoc _start_server, eliminating a
      window in which _start_server can return a thread that is
      “serving” but without a docserver set.
    - gh-116127: typing: implement PEP 705 which adds
      typing.ReadOnly support to typing.TypedDict.
    - gh-116325: typing: raise SyntaxError instead of
      AttributeError on forward references as empty strings.
    - gh-115957: When asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task is called on
      an inactive asyncio.TaskGroup, the given coroutine will be
      closed (which prevents a RuntimeWarning).
    - gh-115978: Disable preadv(), readv(), pwritev(),
      and writev() on WASI. Under wasmtime for WASI
      0.2, these functions don’t pass test_posix
      (gh-bytecodealliance/wasmtime#7830).
    - gh-88352: Fix the computation of the next rollover
      time in the logging.TimedRotatingFileHandler handler.
      computeRollover() now always returns a timestamp larger
      than the specified time and works correctly during the DST
      change. doRollover() no longer overwrite the already rolled
      over file, saving from data loss when run at midnight or
      during repeated time at the DST change.
    - gh-87115: Set __main__.__spec__ to None when running a
      script with pdb
    - gh-76511: Fix UnicodeEncodeError in
      email.Message.as_string() that results when a message
      that claims to be in the ascii character set actually has
      non-ascii characters. Non-ascii characters are now replaced
      with the U+FFFD replacement character, like in the replace
      error handler.
    - gh-89547: Add support for nested typing special forms like
      Final[ClassVar[int]].
    - gh-65824: Improve the less prompt in pydoc.
    - gh-116040: [Enum] fix by-value calls when second value is
      falsey; e.g. Cardinal(1, 0)
    - gh-115821: [Enum] Improve error message when calling
      super().__new__() in custom __new__.
    - gh-85644: Use the XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP environment variable
      in webbrowser to check desktop. Prefer it to the deprecated
      GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID for GNOME detection.
    - gh-75988: Fixed unittest.mock.create_autospec() to pass
      the call through to the wrapped object to return the real
      result.
    - gh-115881: Fix issue where ast.parse() would incorrectly
      flag conditional context managers (such as with (x() if y
      else z()): ...) as invalid syntax if feature_version=(3,
      8) was passed. This reverts changes to the grammar made as
      part of gh-94949.
    - gh-115886: Fix silent truncation of the
      name with an embedded null character in
      multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory.
    - gh-115532: Add kernel density estimation to the statistics
      module.
    - gh-115714: On WASI, the time module no longer get process
      time using times() or CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, system API
      is that is unreliable and is likely to be removed from
      WASI. The affected clock functions fall back to calling
      clock().
    - gh-115809: Improve algorithm for computing
      which rolled-over log files to delete in
      logging.TimedRotatingFileHandler. It is now reliable for
      handlers without namer and with arbitrary deterministic
      namer that leaves the datetime part in the file name
      unmodified.
    - gh-74668: urllib.parse functions parse_qs() and
      parse_qsl() now support bytes arguments containing raw and
      percent-encoded non-ASCII data.
    - gh-67044: csv.writer() now always quotes or escapes '\r'
      and '\n', regardless of lineterminator value.
    - gh-115712: Restore support of space delimiter with
      skipinitialspace=True in csv. csv.writer() now quotes empty
      fields if delimiter is a space and skipinitialspace is true
      and raises exception if quoting is not possible.
    - gh-112364: Fixed ast.unparse() to handle format_spec with
      ", ' or \\. Patched by Frank Hoffmann.
    - gh-112997: Stop logging potentially sensitive callback
      arguments in asyncio unless debug mode is active.
    - gh-114914: Fix an issue where an abandoned StreamWriter
      would not be garbage collected.
    - gh-111358: Fix a bug in
      asyncio.BaseEventLoop.shutdown_default_executor() to ensure
      the timeout passed to the coroutine behaves as expected.
    - gh-115618: Fix improper decreasing the reference count for
      None argument in property methods getter(), setter() and
      deleter().
    - gh-112720: Refactor dis.ArgResolver to make it possible to
      subclass and change the way jump args are interpreted.
    - gh-112006: Fix inspect.unwrap() for types
      with the __wrapper__ data descriptor. Fix
      inspect.Signature.from_callable() for builtins
      classmethod() and staticmethod().
    - gh-101293: Support callables with the __call__() method
      and types with __new__() and __init__() methods set to
      class methods, static methods, bound methods, partial
      functions, and other types of methods and descriptors in
      inspect.Signature.from_callable().
    - gh-103092: Isolate _lsprof (apply PEP 687).
    - gh-113942: pydoc no longer skips global functions
      implemented as builtin methods, such as
      MethodDescriptorType and WrapperDescriptorType.
    - gh-115256: Added DeprecationWarning when accessing the
      tarfile attribute of TarInfo objects. The attribute is
      never used internally and is only attached to TarInfos when
      the tarfile is opened in write-mode, not read-mode. The
      attribute creates an unnecessary reference cycle which may
      cause corruption when not closing the handle after writing
      a tarfile.
    - gh-115197: urllib.request no longer resolves the hostname
      before checking it against the system’s proxy bypass list
      on macOS and Windows.
    - gh-113812: DatagramTransport.sendto() will now send
      zero-length datagrams if called with an empty bytes
      object. The transport flow control also now accounts for
      the datagram header when calculating the buffer size.
    - gh-114763: Protect modules loaded with
      importlib.util.LazyLoader from race conditions when
      multiple threads try to access attributes before the
      loading is complete.
    - gh-114709: posixpath.commonpath() now raises a ValueError
      exception when passed an empty iterable. Previously,
      IndexError was raised.
      posixpath.commonpath() now raises a TypeError exception
      when passed None. Previously, ValueError was raised.
    - gh-114610: Fix bug where pathlib.PurePath.with_stem()
      converted a non-empty path suffix to a stem when given an
      empty stem argument. It now raises ValueError, just like
      pathlib.PurePath.with_suffix() does when called on a path
      with an empty stem, given a non-empty suffix argument.
    - gh-107361: Add ssl.VERIFY_X509_PARTIAL_CHAIN and
      VERIFY_X509_STRICT to the default SSL context created with
      ssl.create_default_context().
    - gh-112281: Allow creating union of types for
      typing.Annotated with unhashable metadata.
    - gh-111775: Fix
      importlib.resources.simple.ResourceHandle.open() for text
      mode, added missed stream argument.
    - gh-90095: Make .pdbrc and -c work with any valid pdb
      commands.
    - gh-107625: Raise configparser.ParsingError from read()
      and read_file() methods of configparser.ConfigParser if a
      key without a corresponding value is continued (that is,
      followed by an indented line).
    - gh-107155: Fix incorrect output of help(x) where x is a
      lambda function, which has an __annotations__ dictionary
      attribute with a "return" key.
    - gh-57141: Add option for non-shallow comparisons to
      filecmp.dircmp like filecmp.cmp(). Original patch by Steven
      Ward. Enhanced by Tobias Rautenkranz
    - gh-69990: Profile.print_stats() has been improved to accept
      multiple sort arguments. Patched by Chiu-Hsiang Hsu and
      Furkan Onder.
    - gh-104061: Add socket.SO_BINDTOIFINDEX constant.
    - gh-60346: Fix ArgumentParser inconsistent with
      parse_known_args.
    - gh-102389: Add windows_31j to aliases for cp932 codec
    - gh-72249: functools.partial`s of :func:`repr() has been
      improved to include the module name. Patched by Furkan
      Onder and Anilyka Barry.
    - gh-100985: Update HTTPSConnection to consistently wrap IPv6
      Addresses when using a proxy.
    - gh-100884: email: fix misfolding of comma in address-lists
      over multiple lines in combination with unicode encoding.
    - gh-95782: Fix io.BufferedReader.tell(),
      io.BufferedReader.seek(), _pyio.BufferedReader.tell(),
      io.BufferedRandom.tell(), io.BufferedRandom.seek() and
      _pyio.BufferedRandom.tell() being able to return negative
      offsets.
    - gh-96310: Fix a traceback in argparse when all options in a
      mutually exclusive group are suppressed.
    - gh-93205: Fixed a bug in
      logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler where multiple
      rotating handler instances pointing to files with the same
      name but different extensions would conflict and not delete
      the correct files.
    - bpo-31116: Add Z85 encoding to base64.
    - bpo-44865: Add missing call to localization function in
      argparse.
    - bpo-43952: Fix multiprocessing.connection.Listener.accept()
      to accept empty bytes as authkey. Not accepting empty bytes
      as key causes it to hang indefinitely.
    - bpo-42125: linecache: get module name from __spec__ if
      available. This allows getting source code for the __main__
      module when a custom loader is used.
    - bpo-41122: Failing to pass arguments properly to
      functools.singledispatchmethod() now throws a TypeError
      instead of hitting an index out of bounds internally.
    - bpo-40818: The asyncio REPL now runs
      sys.__interactivehook__ on startup. The default
      implementation of sys.__interactivehook__ provides
      auto-completion to the asyncio REPL. Patch contributed by
      Rémi Lapeyre.
    - bpo-33775: Add ‘default’ and ‘version’ help text for
      localization in argparse.
  - Documentation

      run failed tests with test.bisect_cmd to identify failing
      tests. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-115596: Fix ProgramPriorityTests in test_os permanently
      changing the process priority.
    - gh-115556: On Windows, commas passed in arguments to

    - gh-114828: Fix compilation crashes in uncommon code examples
      using super() inside a comprehension in a class body.
    - gh-112069: Adapt set and frozenset methods to Argument Clinic.

      support the same range of valid values for objects that has a
      __index__() method as for int.
    - gh-114887: Changed socket type validation in
      create_datagram_endpoint() to accept all non-stream sockets.
      This fixes a regression in compatibility with raw sockets.
    - gh-114944: Fixes a race between PyParkingLot_Park and
      _PyParkingLot_UnparkAll.
    - gh-113462: Limit the number of versions that a single class can
      use. Prevents a few wayward classes using up all the version
      numbers.
    - gh-76763: The chr() builtin function now always raises
      ValueError for values outside the valid range. Previously it
      raised OverflowError for very large or small values.
    - gh-114806: No longer specialize calls to classes, if those
      classes have metaclasses. Fixes bug where the __call__ method of
      the metaclass was not being called.
    - gh-107944: Improve error message for function calls with bad
      keyword arguments via getargs
    - gh-112529: The free-threaded build no longer allocates space for
      the PyGC_Head structure in objects that support cyclic garbage
      collection. A number of other fields and data structures are
      used as replacements, including ob_gc_bits, ob_tid, and mimalloc
      internal data structures.
    - gh-114456: Lower the recursion limit under a debug build of
      WASI.
    - gh-114083: Compiler applies folding of LOAD_CONST with following

      enables jump threading in certain circumstances.
    - gh-114388: Fix a RuntimeWarning emitted when assign an
      integer-like value that is not an instance of int to an
      attribute that corresponds to a C struct member of type T_UINT
      and T_ULONG. Fix a double RuntimeWarning emitted when assign a
      negative integer value to an attribute that corresponds to a C
      struct member of type T_UINT.
    - gh-114265: Compiler propagates line numbers before optimization,
      leading to more optimization opportunities and removing the need
      for the guarantee_lineno_for_exits hack.
    - gh-112529: The free-threaded build now has its own thread-safe
      GC implementation that uses mimalloc to find GC tracked objects.
      It is non-generational, unlike the existing GC implementation.
    - gh-114050: Fix segmentation fault caused by an incorrect format
      string in TypeError exception when more than two arguments are
      passed to int.
    - gh-112354: The END_FOR instruction now pops only one value. This

      disabled.
    - gh-114058: Implement the foundations of the Tier 2 redundancy
      eliminator.
    - gh-113939: frame.clear(): Clear frame.f_locals as well, and not
      only the fast locals. This is relevant once frame.f_locals was
      accessed, which would contain also references to all the locals.
    - gh-112050: Convert collections.deque to use Argument Clinic.
    - gh-112050: Make methods on collections.deque thread-safe when
      the GIL is disabled.
    - gh-113464: Add an option (--enable-experimental-jit for
      configure-based builds or --experimental-jit for PCbuild-based
      ones) to build an experimental just-in-time compiler, based on
      copy-and-patch
    - gh-113055: Make interp->obmalloc a pointer. For interpreters
      that share state with the main interpreter, this points to the
      same static memory structure. For interpreters with their own
      obmalloc state, it is heap allocated. Add free_obmalloc_arenas()
      which will free the obmalloc arenas and radix tree structures
      for interpreters with their own obmalloc state.
    - gh-55664: Add warning when creating type using a namespace
      dictionary with non-string keys. Patched by Daniel Urban and
      Furkan Onder.
    - gh-104530: Use native Win32 condition variables.
  - Library
    - gh-115392: Fix a bug in doctest where incorrect line numbers
      would be reported for decorated functions.
    - gh-114563: Fix several format() bugs when using the C
      implementation of Decimal: * memory leak in some rare cases when
      using the z format option (coerce negative 0) * incorrect output
      when applying the z format option to type F (fixed-point with
      capital NAN / INF) * incorrect output when applying the # format
      option (alternate form)
    - gh-102840: Fix confused traceback when floordiv, mod, or divmod
      operations happens between instances of fractions.Fraction and
      complex.
    - gh-115165: Most exceptions are now ignored when attempting to
      set the __orig_class__ attribute on objects returned when
      calling typing generic aliases (including generic aliases
      created using typing.Annotated). Previously only AttributeError
      was ignored. Patch by Dave Shawley.
    - gh-112903: Fix “issubclass() arg 1 must be a class” errors in
      certain cases of multiple inheritance with generic aliases
      (regression in early 3.13 alpha releases).
    - gh-115133: Fix tests for XMLPullParser with Expat 2.6.0.
    - gh-115059: io.BufferedRandom.read1() now flushes the underlying
      write buffer.
    - gh-79382: Trailing ** no longer allows to match files and
      non-existing paths in recursive glob().
    - gh-67837: Avoid race conditions in the creation of directories
      during concurrent extraction in tarfile and zipfile.
    - gh-115060: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by removing redundant
      regex matching.
    - gh-97928: Partially revert the behavior of tkinter.Text.count().
      By default it preserves the behavior of older Python versions,
      except that setting wantobjects to 0 no longer has effect. Add a
      new parameter return_ints: specifying return_ints=True makes
      Text.count() always returning the single count as an integer
      instead of a 1-tuple or None.
    - gh-114628: When csv.Error is raised when handling TypeError, do
      not print the TypeError traceback.
    - gh-85984: Added _POSIX_VDISABLE from C’s <unistd.h> to termios.
    - gh-114965: Update bundled pip to 24.0
    - gh-114959: tarfile no longer ignores errors when trying to
      extract a directory on top of a file.
    - gh-114894: Add array.array.clear().
    - gh-114071: Support tuple subclasses using auto() for enum member
      value.
    - gh-109475: Fix support of explicit option value “–” in argparse
      (e.g. --option=--).
    - gh-49766: Fix date-datetime comparison. Now the special
      comparison methods like __eq__ and __lt__ return NotImplemented
      if one of comparands is date and other is datetime instead of
      ignoring the time part and the time zone or forcefully return
      “not equal” or raise TypeError. It makes comparison of date and
      datetime subclasses more symmetric and allows to change the
      default behavior by overriding the special comparison methods in
      subclasses.
    - gh-110190: Fix ctypes structs with array on Windows ARM64
      platform by setting MAX_STRUCT_SIZE to 32 in stgdict. Patch by
      Diego Russo
    - gh-114678: Ensure that deprecation warning for ‘N’ specifier in
      Decimal format is not raised for cases where ‘N’ appears in
      other places in the format specifier. Based on patch by Stefan
      Krah.
    - gh-70303: Return both files and directories from
      pathlib.Path.glob() if a pattern ends with “**”. Previously only
      directories were returned.
    - gh-109653: Improve import time of importlib.metadata and
      email.utils.
    - gh-113280: Fix a leak of open socket in rare cases when error
      occurred in ssl.SSLSocket creation.
    - gh-77749: email.policy.EmailPolicy.fold() now always encodes
      non-ASCII characters in headers if utf8 is false.
    - gh-83383: Synchronization of the dbm.dumb database is now no-op
      if there was no modification since opening or last
      synchronization. The directory file for a newly created empty
      dbm.dumb database is now created immediately after opening
      instead of deferring this until synchronizing or closing.
    - gh-91602: Add filter keyword-only parameter to
      sqlite3.Connection.iterdump() for filtering database objects to
      dump. Patch by Mariusz Felisiak.
    - gh-112451: Prohibit subclassing pure-Python datetime.timezone.
      This is consistent with C-extension implementation. Patch by
      Mariusz Felisiak.
    - gh-69893: Add the close() method for the iterator returned by
      xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse().
    - gh-109653: Reduce the import time of threading module by ~50%.
      Patch by Daniel Hollas.
    - gh-114492: Make the result of termios.tcgetattr() reproducible
      on Alpine Linux. Previously it could leave a random garbage in
      some fields.
    - gh-114315: Make threading.Lock a real class, not a factory
      function. Add __new__ to _thread.lock type.
    - gh-100414: Add dbm.sqlite3 as a backend to dbm, and make it the
      new default dbm backend. Patch by Raymond Hettinger and Erlend
      E. Aasland.
    - gh-113267: Revert changes in gh-106584 which made calls of
      TestResult methods startTest() and stopTest() unbalanced.
    - gh-75128: Ignore an OSError in
      asyncio.BaseEventLoop.create_server() when IPv6 is available but
      the interface cannot actually support it.
    - gh-114423: _DummyThread entries in threading._active are now
      automatically removed when the related thread dies.
    - gh-114257: Dismiss the FileNotFound error in
      ctypes.util.find_library() and just return None on Linux.
    - gh-114321: Expose more platform specific constants in the fcntl
      module on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
    - gh-114328: The tty.setcbreak() and new tty.cfmakecbreak() no
      longer clears the terminal input ICRLF flag. This fixes a
      regression introduced in 3.12 that no longer matched how OSes
      define cbreak mode in their stty(1) manual pages.
    - gh-114281: Remove type hints from Lib/asyncio/staggered.py. The
      annotations in the typeshed project should be used instead.
    - gh-101438: Avoid reference cycle in ElementTree.iterparse. The
      iterator returned by ElementTree.iterparse may hold on to a file
      descriptor. The reference cycle prevented prompt clean-up of the
      file descriptor if the returned iterator was not exhausted.
    - gh-114198: The signature for the __replace__ method on
      dataclasses now has the first argument named self, rather than
      obj.
    - gh-104522: OSError raised when run a subprocess now only has
      filename attribute set to cwd if the error was caused by a
      failed attempt to change the current directory.
    - gh-114149: Enum: correctly handle tuple subclasses in custom
      __new__.
    - gh-83648: Support deprecation of options, positional arguments
      and subcommands in argparse.
    - gh-114087: Speed up dataclasses.asdict up to 1.35x.
    - gh-109534: Fix a reference leak in
      asyncio.selector_events.BaseSelectorEventLoop when SSL
      handshakes fail. Patch contributed by Jamie Phan.
    - gh-79634: Accept path-like objects as patterns in
      pathlib.Path.glob() and rglob().
    - gh-112202: Ensure that a asyncio.Condition.notify() call does
      not get lost if the awakened Task is simultaneously cancelled or
      encounters any other error.
    - gh-113951: Fix the behavior of tag_unbind() methods of
      tkinter.Text and tkinter.Canvas classes with three arguments.
      Previously, widget.tag_unbind(tag, sequence, funcid) destroyed
      the current binding for sequence, leaving sequence unbound, and
      deleted the funcid command. Now it removes only funcid from the
      binding for sequence, keeping other commands, and deletes the
      funcid command. It leaves sequence unbound only if funcid was
      the last bound command.
    - gh-97959: Fix rendering class methods, bound methods, method and
      function aliases in pydoc. Class methods no longer have “method
      of builtins.type instance” note. Corresponding notes are now
      added for class and unbound methods. Method and function aliases
      now have references to the module or the class where the origin
      was defined if it differs from the current. Bound methods are
      now listed in the static methods section. Methods of builtin
      classes are now supported as well as methods of Python classes.
    - gh-113796: Add more validation checks in the csv.Dialect
      constructor. ValueError is now raised if the same character is
      used in different roles.
    - gh-113732: Fix support of QUOTE_NOTNULL and QUOTE_STRINGS in
      csv.reader().
    - gh-113225: Speed up pathlib.Path.walk() by using
      os.DirEntry.path where possible.
    - gh-89039: When replace() method is called on a subclass of
      datetime, date or time, properly call derived constructor.
      Previously, only the base class’s constructor was called.
    - Also, make sure to pass non-zero fold values when creating
      subclasses in various methods. Previously, fold was silently
      ignored.
    - gh-112919: Speed-up datetime.datetime.replace(),
      datetime.date.replace() and datetime.time.replace().
    - gh-59013: Set breakpoint on the first executable line of the
      function, instead of the line of function definition when the
      user do break func using pdb
    - gh-112343: Improve handling of pdb convenience variables to
      avoid replacing string contents.
    - gh-112240: Add option to calendar module CLI to specify the
      weekday to start each week. Patch by Steven Ward.
    - gh-111741: Recognise image/webp as a standard format in the
      mimetypes module.
    - gh-43457: Fix the tkinter widget method wm_attributes(). It now
      accepts the attribute name without the minus prefix to get
      window attributes and allows to specify attributes and values to
      set as keyword arguments. Add new optional keyword argument
      return_python_dict: calling
      w.wm_attributes(return_python_dict=True) returns the attributes
      as a dict instead of a tuple. Calling w.wm_attributes() now
      returns a tuple instead of string if wantobjects was set to 0.
    - gh-82626: Many functions now emit a warning if a boolean value
      is passed as a file descriptor argument.
    - gh-111051: Added check for file modification during debugging
      with pdb
    - gh-110345: Show the Tcl/Tk patchlevel (rather than version) in
      tkinter._test().
    - gh-38807: Fix race condition in trace. Instead of checking if a
      directory exists and creating it, directly call os.makedirs()
      with the kwarg exist_ok=True.
    - gh-75705: Set unixfrom envelope in mailbox.mbox and
      mailbox.MMDF.
    - gh-106233: Fix stacklevel in InvalidTZPathWarning during
      zoneinfo module import.
    - gh-105102: Allow ctypes.Union to be nested in ctypes.Structure
      when the system endianness is the opposite of the classes.
    - gh-104282: Fix null pointer dereference in
      lzma._decode_filter_properties() due to improper handling of BCJ
      filters with properties of zero length. Patch by Radislav
      Chugunov.
    - gh-96471: Add queue.Queue termination with shutdown().
    - gh-101599: Changed argparse flag options formatting to remove
      redundancy.
    - gh-85984: Add POSIX pseudo-terminal functions os.posix_openpt(),
      os.grantpt(), os.unlockpt(), and os.ptsname().
    - gh-102512: When os.fork() is called from a foreign thread (aka
      _DummyThread), the type of the thread in a child process is
      changed to _MainThread. Also changed its name and daemonic
      status, it can be now joined.
    - gh-88569: Add os.path.isreserved(), which identifies reserved
      pathnames such as “NUL”, “AUX” and “CON”. This function is only
      available on Windows.
    - Deprecate pathlib.PurePath.is_reserved().
    - bpo-38364: The inspect functions isgeneratorfunction,
      iscoroutinefunction, isasyncgenfunction now support
      functools.partialmethod wrapped functions the same way they
      support functools.partial.
  - Documentation
    - gh-115233: Fix an example for LoggerAdapter in the Logging
      Cookbook.
    - gh-114123: Move the csv module docstring to the csv module
      instead of reexporting it from the internal _csv module, and
      remove __doc__ from csv.__all__.
    - Move csv.__version__ to the csv module instead of reexporting it
      from the internal _csv module, and remove __version__ from
      csv.__all__.  Test- s
    - gh-114099: Added test exclusions required to run the test suite
      on iOS.
    - gh-105089: Fix
      test.test_zipfile.test_core.TestWithDirectory.test_create_directory_with_write
      test in AIX by doing a bitwise AND of 0xFFFF on mode , so that
      it will be in sync with zinfo.external_attr Buil- d
    - gh-115167: Avoid vendoring vcruntime140_threads.dll when
      building with Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8.
    - gh-113632: Promote WASI to a tier 2 platform and drop Emscripten
      from tier 3 in configure.ac.
    - gh-114099: configure and Makefile were refactored to accomodate
      framework builds on Apple platforms other than macOS.
    - gh-114875: Add getgrent() as a prerequisite for building the grp
      module.  Wind- ows
    - gh-115049: Fixes py.exe launcher failing when run as users
      without user profiles.
    - gh-115009: Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.45.1.
    - gh-109991: Update Windows build to use OpenSSL 3.0.13.
    - gh-111239: Update Windows builds to use zlib v1.3.1.
    - gh-100107: The py.exe launcher will no longer attempt to run the
      Microsoft Store redirector when launching a script containing a
      /usr/bin/env shebang
    - gh-112984: Adds free-threaded binaries to Windows installer as
      an optional component.
    - gh-89240: Allows multiprocessing to create pools of greater than
      62 processes.
  - IDLE
    - gh-96905: In idlelib code, stop redefining built-ins ‘dict’ and
      ‘object’.
    - gh-103820: Revise IDLE bindings so that events from mouse button
      4/5 on non-X11 windowing systems (i.e. Win32 and Aqua) are not
      mistaken for scrolling.
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-113516: Don’t set LDSHARED when building for WASI.
    - gh-109991: Update GitHub CI workflows to use OpenSSL 3.0.13 and
      multissltests to use 1.1.1w, 3.0.13, 3.1.5, and 3.2.1.
    - gh-115015: Fix a bug in Argument Clinic that generated incorrect
      code for methods with no parameters that use the METH_METHOD |
      METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS calling convention. Only the
      positional parameter count was checked; any keyword argument
      passed would be silently accepted.
  - C API
    - gh-111140: Adds PyLong_AsNativeBytes(), PyLong_FromNativeBytes()
      and PyLong_FromUnsignedNativeBytes() functions.
    - gh-114685: PyBuffer_FillInfo() now raises a SystemError if
      called with PyBUF_READ or PyBUF_WRITE as flags. These flags
      should only be used with the PyMemoryView_* C API.
    - gh-114685: PyObject_GetBuffer() now raises a SystemError if
      called with PyBUF_READ or PyBUF_WRITE as flags. These flags
      should only be used with the PyMemoryView_* C API.
    - gh-114626: Add PyCFunctionFast and PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords
      typedefs (identical to the existing _PyCFunctionFast and
      _PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords typedefs, just without a leading _
      prefix).
    - gh-114329: Add PyList_GetItemRef(), which is similar to
      PyList_GetItem() but returns a strong reference instead of a
      borrowed reference.
    - gh-110850: Add PyTime C API:
      * PyTime_t type.
      * PyTime_MIN and PyTime_MAX constants.
      * PyTime_AsSecondsDouble(), PyTime_Monotonic(), PyTime_PerfCounter(), and PyTime_Time() functions.
    - gh-112066: Add PyDict_SetDefaultRef(): insert a key and value
      into a dictionary if the key is not already present. This is
      similar to dict.setdefault(), but returns an integer value
      indicating if the key was already present. It is also similar to
      PyDict_SetDefault(), but returns a strong reference instead of a
      borrowed reference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 20 18:12:05 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Add gh115133-XMLPullParserTest-fail.patch to make
  Python building with the current libexpat 2.6.0
  (gh#python/cpython#115133).
- Switch to %%autopatch. Let’s try it as an experiment, and if we
  need conditional patch, we should put condition inside of it.
- Remove double definition of /usr/bin/idle%%{version} in
  %%files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  8 08:10:09 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.13.0a3
  - Security
    - gh-113659: Skip .pth files with names starting with a dot or
      hidden file attribute.
    - gh-112302: Created a Software Bill-of-Materials document and
      tooling for tracking dependencies.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-107901: Compiler duplicates basic blocks that have an eval
      breaker check, no line number, and multiple predecessors.
    - gh-107901: A jump leaving an exception handler back to normal
      code no longer checks the eval breaker.
    - gh-113655: Set the C recursion limit to 4000 on Windows, and
      10000 on Linux/OSX. This seems to be near the sweet spot to
      maintain safety, but not compromise backwards compatibility.
    - gh-113710: Add typed stack effects to the interpreter DSL, along
      with various instruction annotations.
    - gh-77046: On Windows, file descriptors wrapping Windows handles
      are now created non inheritable by default (PEP 446). Patch by
      Zackery Spytz and Victor Stinner.
    - gh-113853: Guarantee that all executors make progress. This then
      guarantees that tier 2 execution always makes progress.
    - gh-113753: Fix an issue where the finalizer of PyAsyncGenASend
      objects might not be called if they were allocated from a free
      list.
    - gh-107901: Compiler changed so that synthetic jumps which are
      not at loop end no longer check the eval breaker.
    - gh-113703: Fix a regression in the codeop module that was
      causing it to incorrectly identify incomplete f-strings. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-89811: Check for a valid tp_version_tag before performing
      bytecode specializations that rely on this value being usable.
    - gh-111488: Changed error message in case of no ‘in’ keyword
      after ‘for’ in list comprehensions
    - gh-113657: Fix an issue that caused important instruction
      pointer updates to be optimized out of tier two traces.
    - gh-113603: Fixed bug where a redundant NOP is not removed,
      causing an assertion to fail in the compiler in debug mode.
    - gh-113602: Fix an error that was causing the parser to try to
      overwrite existing errors and crashing in the process. Patch by
      Pablo Galindo
    - gh-113486: No longer issue spurious PY_UNWIND events for
      optimized calls to classes.
    - gh-113297: Fix segfault in the compiler on with statement with
      19 context managers.
    - gh-113212: Improve super error messages.
    - gh-111375: Only use NULL in the exception stack to indicate an
      exception was handled. Patch by Carey Metcalfe.
    - gh-112215: Increase the C recursion limit by a factor of 3 for
      non-debug builds, except for webassembly and s390 platforms
      which are unchanged. This mitigates some regressions in 3.12
      with deep recursion mixing builtin (C) and Python code.
    - gh-113054: Fixed bug where a redundant NOP is not removed,
      causing an assertion to fail in the compiler in debug mode.
    - gh-106905: Use per AST-parser state rather than global state to
      track recursion depth within the AST parser to prevent potential
      race condition due to simultaneous parsing.
    - The issue primarily showed up in 3.11 by multithreaded users of
      ast.parse(). In 3.12 a change to when garbage collection can be
      triggered prevented the race condition from occurring.
    - gh-108866: Change the API and contract of _PyExecutorObject to
      return the next_instr pointer, instead of the frame, and to
      always execute at least one instruction.
    - gh-90350: Optimize builtin functions min() and max().
    - gh-112943: Correctly compute end column offsets for multiline
      tokens in the tokenize module. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112125: Fix None.__ne__(None) returning NotImplemented
      instead of False
    - gh-74616: input() now raises a ValueError when output on the
      terminal if the prompt contains embedded null characters instead
      of silently truncating it.
    - gh-112716: Fix SystemError in the import statement and in
      __reduce__() methods of builtin types when __builtins__ is not a
      dict.
    - gh-112730: Use color to highlight error locations in tracebacks.
      Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112625: Fixes a bug where a bytearray object could be cleared
      while iterating over an argument in the bytearray.join() method
      that could result in reading memory after it was freed.
    - gh-112660: Do not clear unexpected errors during formatting
      error messages for ImportError and AttributeError for modules.
    - gh-105967: Workaround a bug in Apple’s macOS platform zlib
      library where zlib.crc32() and binascii.crc32() could produce
      incorrect results on multi-gigabyte inputs. Including when using
      zipfile on zips containing large data.
    - gh-95754: Provide a better error message when accessing invalid
      attributes on partially initialized modules. The origin of the
      module being accessed is now included in the message to help
      with the common issue of shadowing other modules.
    - gh-112217: Add check for the type of __cause__ returned from
      calling the type T in raise from T.
    - gh-111058: Change coro.cr_frame/gen.gi_frame to return None
      after the coroutine/generator has been closed. This fixes a bug
      where getcoroutinestate() and getgeneratorstate() return the
      wrong state for a closed coroutine/generator.
    - gh-112388: Fix an error that was causing the parser to try to
      overwrite tokenizer errors. Patch by pablo Galindo
    - gh-112387: Fix error positions for decoded strings with
      backwards tokenize errors. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-99606: Make code generated for an empty f-string identical to
      the code of an empty normal string.
    - gh-112367: Avoid undefined behaviour when using the perf
      trampolines by not freeing the code arenas until shutdown. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112320: The Tier 2 translator now tracks the confidence level
      for staying “on trace” (i.e. not exiting back to the Tier 1
      interpreter) for branch instructions based on the number of bits
      set in the branch “counter”. Trace translation ends when the
      confidence drops below 1/3rd.
    - gh-109598: PyComplex_RealAsDouble()/PyComplex_ImagAsDouble() now
      tries to convert an object to a complex instance using its
      __complex__() method before falling back to the __float__()
      method. Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-94606: Fix UnicodeEncodeError when
      email.message.get_payload() reads a message with a Unicode
      surrogate character and the message content is not well-formed
      for surrogateescape encoding. Patch by Sidney Markowitz.
    - bpo-21861: Use the object’s actual class name in
      _io.FileIO.__repr__(), _io._WindowsConsoleIO() and
      _io.TextIOWrapper.__repr__(), to make these methods subclass
      friendly.
    - bpo-45369: Remove LibreSSL workarounds as per PEP 644.
    - bpo-34392: Added sys._is_interned().  Libr- ary
    - gh-114077: Fix possible OverflowError in
      socket.socket.sendfile() when pass count larger than 2 GiB on
      32-bit platform.
    - gh-111803: plistlib now supports loading more deeply nested
      lists in binary format.
    - gh-114014: Fixed a bug in fractions.Fraction where an invalid
      string using d in the decimals part creates a different error
      compared to other invalid letters/characters. Patch by Jeremiah
      Gabriel Pascual.
    - gh-108364: sqlite3.Connection.iterdump() now ensures that
      foreign key support is disabled before dumping the database
      schema, if there is any foreign key violation. Patch by Erlend
      E. Aasland and Mariusz Felisiak.
    - gh-113971: The zipfile.ZipInfo previously protected
      ._compresslevel attribute has been made public as
      .compress_level with the old _compresslevel name remaining
      available as a property to retain compatibility.
    - gh-113877: Fix tkinter method winfo_pathname() on 64-bit
      Windows.
    - gh-113868: Added mmap.MAP_NORESERVE, mmap.MAP_NOEXTEND,
      mmap.MAP_HASSEMAPHORE, mmap.MAP_NOCACHE, mmap.MAP_JIT,
      mmap.MAP_RESILIENT_CODESIGN, mmap.MAP_RESILIENT_MEDIA,
      mmap.MAP_32BIT, mmap.MAP_TRANSLATED_ALLOW_EXECUTE,
      mmap.MAP_UNIX03 and mmap.MAP_TPRO. All of them are mmap(2) flags
      on macOS.
    - gh-113848: asyncio.TaskGroup() and asyncio.timeout() context
      managers now handle CancelledError subclasses as well as exact
      CancelledError.
    - gh-113661: unittest runner: Don’t exit 5 if tests were skipped.
      The intention of exiting 5 was to detect issues where the test
      suite wasn’t discovered at all. If we skipped tests, it was
      correctly discovered.
    - gh-96037: Insert TimeoutError in the context of the exception
      that was raised during exiting an expired asyncio.timeout()
      block.
    - gh-113781: Silence unraisable AttributeError when warnings are
      emitted during Python finalization.
    - gh-113238: Add Anchor to importlib.resources (in order for the
      code to comply with the documentation)
    - gh-111693: asyncio.Condition.wait() now re-raises the same
      CancelledError instance that may have caused it to be
      interrupted. Fixed race condition in asyncio.Semaphore.aquire()
      when interrupted with a CancelledError.
    - gh-113791: Add CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW_APPROX and
      CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW_APPROX to time on macOS. These are clocks
      available on macOS 10.12 or later.
    - gh-112932: Restore the ability for zipfile to extractall from
      zip files with a “/” directory entry in them as is commonly
      added to zips by some wiki or bug tracker data exporters.
    - gh-113568: Raise deprecation warnings from pathlib.PurePath and
      not its private base class PurePathBase.
    - gh-113594: Fix UnicodeEncodeError in email when re-fold lines
      that contain unknown-8bit encoded part followed by
      non-unknown-8bit encoded part.
    - gh-113538: In asyncio.StreamReaderProtocol.connection_made(),
      there is callback that logs an error if the task wrapping the
      “connected callback” fails. This callback would itself fail if
      the task was cancelled. Prevent this by checking whether the
      task was cancelled first. If so, close the transport but don’t
      log an error.
    - gh-113626: Add support for the allow_code argument in the
      marshal module. Passing allow_code=False prevents serialization
      and de-serialization of code objects which is incompatible
      between Python versions.
    - gh-85567: Fix resource warnings for unclosed files in pickle and
      pickletools command line interfaces.
    - gh-113537: Support loads str in plistlib.loads().
    - gh-89850: Add default implementations of
      pickle.Pickler.persistent_id() and
      pickle.Unpickler.persistent_load() methods in the C
      implementation. Calling super().persistent_id() and
      super().persistent_load() in subclasses of the C implementation
      of pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler classes no longer causes
      infinite recursion.
    - gh-113569: Indicate if there were no actual calls in unittest
      assert_has_calls() failure.
    - gh-101225: Increase the backlog for
      multiprocessing.connection.Listener objects created by
      multiprocessing.manager and multiprocessing.resource_sharer to
      significantly reduce the risk of getting a connection refused
      error when creating a multiprocessing.connection.Connection to
      them.
    - gh-113568: Raise audit events from pathlib.Path and not its
      private base class PathBase.
    - gh-113543: Make sure that webbrowser.MacOSXOSAScript sends
      webbrowser.open audit event.
    - gh-113028: When a second reference to a string appears in the
      input to pickle, and the Python implementation is in use, we are
      guaranteed that a single copy gets pickled and a single object
      is shared when reloaded. Previously, in protocol 0, when a
      string contained certain characters (e.g. newline) it resulted
      in duplicate objects.
    - gh-113421: Fix multiprocessing logger for %(filename)s.
    - gh-111784: Fix segfaults in the _elementtree module. Fix first
      segfault during deallocation of _elementtree.XMLParser instances
      by keeping strong reference to pyexpat module in module state
      for capsule lifetime. Fix second segfault which happens in the
      same deallocation process by keeping strong reference to
      _elementtree module in XMLParser structure for _elementtree
      module lifetime.
    - gh-113407: Fix import of unittest.mock when CPython is built
      without docstrings.
    - gh-113320: Fix regression in Python 3.12 where Protocol classes
      that were not marked as runtime-checkable would be unnecessarily
      introspected, potentially causing exceptions to be raised if the
      protocol had problematic members. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-53502: Add a new option aware_datetime in plistlib to loads
      or dumps aware datetime.
    - gh-113358: Fix rendering tracebacks with exceptions with a
      broken __getattr__
    - gh-113214: Fix an AttributeError during asyncio SSL protocol
      aborts in SSL-over-SSL scenarios.
    - gh-113246: Update bundled pip to 23.3.2.
    - gh-87264: Fixed tarfile list() method to show file type.
    - gh-112182: asyncio.futures.Future.set_exception() now transforms
      StopIteration into RuntimeError instead of hanging or other
      misbehavior. Patch contributed by Jamie Phan.
    - gh-113225: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by using
      os.DirEntry.path where possible.
    - gh-113149: Improve error message when a JSON array or object
      contains a trailing comma. Patch by Carson Radtke.
    - gh-113117: The subprocess module can now use the
      os.posix_spawn() function with close_fds=True on platforms where
      posix_spawn_file_actions_addclosefrom_np is available. Patch by
      Jakub Kulik.
    - gh-113199: Make http.client.HTTPResponse.read1 and
      http.client.HTTPResponse.readline close IO after reading all
      data when content length is known. Patch by Illia Volochii.
    - gh-113191: Add support of os.fchmod() and a file descriptor in
      os.chmod() on Windows.
    - gh-113188: Fix shutil.copymode() and shutil.copystat() on
      Windows. Previously they worked differenly if dst is a symbolic
      link: they modified the permission bits of dst itself rather
      than the file it points to if follow_symlinks is true or src is
      not a symbolic link, and did not modify the permission bits if
      follow_symlinks is false and src is a symbolic link.
    - gh-113119: os.posix_spawn() now accepts env=None, which makes
      the newly spawned process use the current process environment.
      Patch by Jakub Kulik.
    - gh-113202: Add a strict option to batched() in the itertools
      module.
    - gh-61648: Detect line numbers of properties in doctests.
    - gh-113175: Sync with importlib_metadata 7.0, including improved
      type annotations, fixed issue with symlinked packages in
      package_distributions, added EntryPoints.__repr__, introduced
      the diagnose script, added Distribution.origin property, and
      removed deprecated EntryPoint access by numeric index (tuple
      behavior).
    - gh-59616: Add support of os.lchmod() and the follow_symlinks
      argument in os.chmod() on Windows. Note that the default value
      of follow_symlinks in os.lchmod() is False on Windows.
    - gh-112559: signal.signal() and signal.getsignal() no longer call
      repr on callable handlers. asyncio.run() and
      asyncio.Runner.run() no longer call repr on the task results.
      Patch by Yilei Yang.
    - gh-112962: dis module functions add cache information to the
      Instruction instance rather than creating fake Instruction
      instances to represent the cache entries.
    - gh-112989: Reduce overhead to connect sockets with asyncio
      SelectorEventLoop.
    - gh-112970: Use closefrom() on Linux where available (e.g.
      glibc-2.34), rather than only FreeBSD.
    - gh-110190: Fix ctypes structs with array on PPC64LE platform by
      setting MAX_STRUCT_SIZE to 64 in stgdict. Patch by Diego Russo.
    - gh-112540: The statistics.geometric_mean() function now returns
      zero for datasets containing a zero. Formerly, it would raise an
      exception.
    - gh-87286: Added LOG_FTP, LOG_NETINFO, LOG_REMOTEAUTH,
      LOG_INSTALL, LOG_RAS, and LOG_LAUNCHD tot the syslog module, all
      of them constants on used on macOS.
    - gh-112800: Fix asyncio SubprocessTransport.close() not to throw
      PermissionError when used with setuid executables.
    - gh-51944: Add the following constants to the termios module.
      These values are present in macOS system headers: ALTWERASE,
      B14400, B28800, B7200, B76800, CCAR_OFLOW, CCTS_OFLOW,
      CDSR_OFLOW, CDTR_IFLOW, CIGNORE, CRTS_IFLOW, EXTPROC, IUTF8,
      MDMBUF, NL2, NL3, NOKERNINFO, ONOEOT, OXTABS, VDSUSP, VSTATUS.
    - gh-79325: Fix an infinite recursion error in
      tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() cleanup on Windows.
    - gh-94692: shutil.rmtree() now only catches OSError exceptions.
      Previously a symlink attack resistant version of shutil.rmtree()
      could ignore or pass to the error handler arbitrary exception
      when invalid arguments were provided.
    - gh-112736: The use of del-safe symbols in subprocess was
      refactored to allow for use in cross-platform build
      environments.
    - gh-112727: Speed up pathlib.Path.absolute(). Patch by Barney
      Gale.
    - gh-74690: Speedup issubclass() checks against simple
      runtime-checkable protocols by around 6%. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-74690: Speedup isinstance() checks by roughly 20% for
      runtime-checkable protocols that only have one callable member.
      Speedup issubclass() checks for these protocols by roughly 10%.
      Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-112645: Remove deprecation error on passing onerror to
      shutil.rmtree().
    - gh-112640: Add kwdefaults parameter to types.FunctionType to set
      default keyword argument values.
    - gh-112622: Ensure name parameter is passed to event loop in
      asyncio.create_task().
    - gh-112618: Fix a caching bug relating to typing.Annotated.
      Annotated[str, True] is no longer identical to Annotated[str,
      1].
    - gh-112334: Fixed a performance regression in 3.12’s subprocess
      on Linux where it would no longer use the fast-path vfork()
      system call when it could have due to a logic bug, instead
      falling back to the safe but slower fork().
    - Also fixed a second 3.12.0 potential security bug. If a value of
      extra_groups=[] was passed to subprocess.Popen or related APIs,
      the underlying setgroups(0, NULL) system call to clear the
      groups list would not be made in the child process prior to
      exec().
    - This was identified via code inspection in the process of fixing
      the first bug.
    - gh-110190: Fix ctypes structs with array on Arm platform by
      setting MAX_STRUCT_SIZE to 32 in stgdict. Patch by Diego Russo.
    - gh-81194: Fix a crash in socket.if_indextoname() with specific
      value (UINT_MAX). Fix an integer overflow in
      socket.if_indextoname() on 64-bit non-Windows platforms.
    - gh-112578: Fix a spurious RuntimeWarning when executing the
      zipfile module.
    - gh-112516: Update the bundled copy of pip to version 23.3.1.
    - gh-112510: Add readline.backend for the backend readline uses
      (editline or readline)
    - gh-112328: [Enum] Make EnumDict, EnumDict.member_names,
      EnumType._add_alias_ and EnumType._add_value_alias_ public.
    - gh-112509: Fix edge cases that could cause a key to be present
      in both the __required_keys__ and __optional_keys__ attributes
      of a typing.TypedDict. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-101336: Add keep_alive keyword parameter for
      AbstractEventLoop.create_server() and
      BaseEventLoop.create_server().
    - gh-63284: Added support for TLS-PSK (pre-shared key) mode to the
      ssl module.
    - gh-112414: Fix regression in Python 3.12 where calling repr() on
      a module that had been imported using a custom loader could fail
      with AttributeError. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-112358: Revert change to struct.Struct initialization that
      broke some cases of subclassing.
    - gh-112405: Optimize pathlib.PurePath.relative_to(). Patch by

    - gh-112361: Speed up a small handful of pathlib methods by
      removing some temporary objects.
    - gh-112345: Improve error message when trying to call
      issubclass() against a typing.Protocol that has non-method
      members. Patch by Randolf Scholz.
    - gh-112137: Change dis output to display no-lineno as “–” instead
      of “None”.
    - gh-112332: Deprecate the exc_type field of
      traceback.TracebackException. Add exc_type_str to replace it.
    - gh-81620: Add extra tests for random.binomialvariate()
    - gh-112292: Fix a crash in readline when imported from a sub
      interpreter. Patch by Anthony Shaw
    - gh-77621: Slightly improve the import time of the pathlib module
      by deferring some imports. Patch by Barney Gale.
    - gh-112137: Change dis output to display logical labels for jump
      targets instead of offsets.
    - gh-112139: Add Signature.format() to format signatures to string
      with extra options. And use it in pydoc to render more readable
      signatures that have new lines between parameters.
    - gh-112105: Make readline.set_completer_delims() work with
      libedit
    - gh-106922: Display multiple lines with traceback when errors
      span multiple lines.
    - gh-111874: When creating a typing.NamedTuple class, ensure
      __set_name__() is called on all objects that define __set_name__
      and exist in the values of the NamedTuple class’s class
      dictionary. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-68166: Add support of the “vsapi” element type in
      tkinter.ttk.Style.element_create().
    - gh-110275: Named tuple’s methods _replace() and __replace__()
      now raise TypeError instead of ValueError for invalid keyword
      arguments.
    - gh-99367: Do not mangle sys.path[0] in pdb if safe_path is set
    - gh-111615: Fix a regression caused by a fix to gh-93162 whereby
      you couldn’t configure a QueueHandler without specifying
      handlers.
    - gh-75666: Fix the behavior of tkinter widget’s unbind() method
      with two arguments. Previously, widget.unbind(sequence, funcid)
      destroyed the current binding for sequence, leaving sequence
      unbound, and deleted the funcid command. Now it removes only
      funcid from the binding for sequence, keeping other commands,
      and deletes the funcid command. It leaves sequence unbound only
      if funcid was the last bound command.
    - gh-67790: Implement basic formatting support (minimum width,
      alignment, fill) for fractions.Fraction.
    - gh-111049: Fix crash during garbage collection of the io.BytesIO
      buffer object.
    - gh-102980: Redirect the output of interact command of pdb to the
      same channel as the debugger. Add tests and improve docs.
    - gh-102988: email.utils.getaddresses() and
      email.utils.parseaddr() now return ('', '') 2-tuples in more
      situations where invalid email addresses are encountered instead
      of potentially inaccurate values. Add optional strict parameter
      to these two functions: use strict=False to get the old
      behavior, accept malformed inputs. getattr(email.utils,
      'supports_strict_parsing', False) can be use to check if the
      strict paramater is available. Patch by Thomas Dwyer and Victor
      Stinner to improve the CVE-2023-27043 fix (bsc#1210638).
    - gh-52161: cmd.Cmd.do_help() now cleans docstrings with
      inspect.cleandoc() before writing them. Patch by Filip
      Łapkiewicz.
    - gh-82300: Add track parameter to
      multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory that allows using
      shared memory blocks without having to register with the POSIX
      resource tracker that automatically releases them upon process
      exit.
    - gh-110109: Add private pathlib._PurePathBase class: a base class
      for pathlib.PurePath that omits certain magic methods. It may be
      made public (along with _PathBase) in future.
    - gh-109858: Protect zipfile from “quoted-overlap” zipbomb. It now
      raises BadZipFile when try to read an entry that overlaps with
      other entry or central directory.
    - gh-109786: Fix possible reference leaks and crash when re-enter
      the __next__() method of itertools.pairwise.
    - gh-91539: Small (10 - 20%) and trivial performance improvement
      of urrlib.request.getproxies_environment(), typically useful
      when there are many environment variables to go over.
    - gh-103363: Add follow_symlinks keyword-only argument to
      pathlib.Path.owner() and group(), defaulting to True.
    - gh-102130: Support tab completion in cmd for editline.
    - gh-99437: runpy.run_path() now decodes path-like objects, making
      sure __file__ and sys.argv[0] of the module being run are always
      strings.
    - gh-104003: Add warnings.deprecated(), a decorator to mark
      deprecated functions to static type checkers and to warn on
      usage of deprecated classes and functions. See PEP 702. Patch by
      Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-103708: Make hardcoded python name, a configurable parameter
      so that different implementations of python can override it
      instead of making huge diffs in sysconfig.py
    - gh-66515: mailbox.MH now supports folders that do not contain a
      .mh_sequences file (e.g. Claws Mail IMAP-cache folders). Patch
      by Serhiy Storchaka.
    - gh-83162: Renamed re.error to PatternError for clarity, and kept
      re.error for backward compatibility. Patch by Matthias
      Bussonnier and Adam Chhina.
    - gh-91133: Fix a bug in tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup,
      which now no longer dereferences symlinks when working around
      file system permission errors.
    - bpo-43153: On Windows, tempfile.TemporaryDirectory previously
      masked a PermissionError with NotADirectoryError during
      directory cleanup. It now correctly raises PermissionError if
      errors are not ignored. Patch by Andrei Kulakov and Ken Jin.
    - bpo-32731: getpass.getuser() now raises OSError for all failures
      rather than ImportError on systems lacking the pwd module or
      KeyError if the password database is empty.
    - bpo-34321: mmap.mmap now has a trackfd parameter on Unix; if it
      is False, the file descriptor specified by fileno will not be
      duplicated.
    - bpo-35332: The shutil.rmtree() function now ignores errors when
      calling os.close() when ignore_errors is True, and os.close() no
      longer retried after error.
    - bpo-35928: io.TextIOWrapper now correctly handles the decoding
      buffer after read() and write().
    - bpo-26791: shutil.move() now moves a symlink into a directory
      when that directory is the target of the symlink. This provides
      the same behavior as the mv shell command. The previous behavior
      raised an exception. Patch by Jeffrey Kintscher.
    - bpo-41422: Fixed memory leaks of pickle.Pickler and
      pickle.Unpickler involving cyclic references via the internal
      memo mapping.
    - bpo-19821: The pydoc.ispackage() function has been deprecated.
    - bpo-40262: The ssl.SSLSocket.recv_into() method no longer
      requires the buffer argument to implement __len__ and supports
      buffers with arbitrary item size.
    - bpo-39912: warnings.filterwarnings() and warnings.simplefilter()
      now raise appropriate exceptions instead of AssertionError.
      Patch contributed by Rémi Lapeyre.
    - bpo-37260: Fixed a race condition in shutil.rmtree() in which
      directory entries removed by another process or thread while
      shutil.rmtree() is running can cause it to raise
      FileNotFoundError. Patch by Jeffrey Kintscher.
    - bpo-36959: Fix some error messages for invalid ISO format string
      combinations in strptime() that referred to directives not
      contained in the format string. Patch by Gordon P. Hemsley.
    - bpo-18060: Fixed a class inheritance issue that can cause
      segfaults when deriving two or more levels of subclasses from a
      base class of Structure or Union.
    - bpo-29779: Add a new PYTHON_HISTORY environment variable to set
      the location of a .python_history file.
    - bpo-21360: mailbox.Maildir now ignores files with a leading dot.
  - Documentation
    - gh-111699: Relocate smtpd deprecation notice to its own section
      rather than under locale in What’s New in Python 3.12 document
    - gh-110746: Improved markup for valid options/values for methods
      ttk.treeview.column and ttk.treeview.heading, and for Layouts.
    - gh-95649: Document that the asyncio module contains code taken
      from v0.16.0 of the uvloop project, as well as the required MIT
      licensing information.
  - Tests
    - gh-111798: Disable test_super_deep() from test_call under
      pydebug builds on WASI; the stack depth is too small to make the
      test useful.
    - gh-111801: Lower the recursion limit in test_isinstance for
      test_infinitely_many_bases(). This prevents a stack overflow on
      a pydebug build of WASI.
    - gh-111802: Specify a low recursion depth for test_bad_getattr()
      in test.pickletester to avoid exhausting the stack under a
      pydebug build for WASI.
    - gh-44626: Fix os.path.isabs() incorrectly returning True when
      given a path that starts with exactly one (back)slash on
      Windows.
    - Fix pathlib.PureWindowsPath.is_absolute() incorrectly returning
      False for some paths beginning with two (back)slashes.
    - gh-113633: Use module state for the _testcapi extension module.
    - gh-109980: Fix test_tarfile_vs_tar in test_shutil for macOS,
      where system tar can include more information in the archive
      than shutil.make_archive.
    - gh-112769: The tests now correctly compare zlib version when
      zlib.ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION contains non-integer suffixes. For
      example zlib-ng defines the version as 1.3.0.zlib-ng.
    - gh-112334: Adds a regression test to verify that vfork() is used
      when expected by subprocess on vfork enabled POSIX systems
      (Linux).
    - gh-108927: Fixed order dependence in running tests in the same
      process when a test that has submodules (e.g. test_importlib)
      follows a test that imports its submodule (e.g.
      test_importlib.util) and precedes a test (e.g. test_unittest or
      test_compileall) that uses that submodule.
    - bpo-40648: Test modes that file can get with chmod() on Windows.
  - Build
    - gh-114013: Fix Tools/wasm/wasi.py to not include the path to
      python.wasm as part of HOSTRUNNER. The environment variable is
      meant to specify how to run the WASI host only, having
      python.wasm and relevant flags appended to the HOSTRUNNER. This
      fixes make test work.
    - gh-113258: Changed the Windows build to write out generated
      frozen modules into the build tree instead of the source tree.
    - gh-112305: Fixed the check-clean-src step performed on out of
      tree builds to detect errant $(srcdir)/Python/frozen_modules/*.h
      files and recommend appropriate source tree cleanup steps to get
      a working build again.
    - gh-112536: Add support for thread sanitizer (TSAN)
    - gh-112867: Fix the build for the case that
      WITH_PYMALLOC_RADIX_TREE=0 set.
    - gh-103065: Introduce Tools/wasm/wasi.py to simplify doing a WASI
      build.
    - bpo-11102: The os.major(), os.makedev(), and os.minor()
      functions are now available on HP-UX v3.
    - bpo-36351: Do not set ipv6type when cross-compiling.
  - IDLE
    - gh-72284: Improve the lists of features, editor key bindings,
      and shell key bingings in the IDLE doc.
    - gh-113903: Fix rare failure of test.test_idle, in
      test_configdialog.
    - gh-113729: Fix the “Help -> IDLE Doc” menu bug in 3.11.7 and
      3.12.1.
    - gh-113269: Fix test_editor hang on macOS Catalina.
    - gh-112898: Fix processing unsaved files when quitting IDLE on
      macOS.
    - bpo-13586: Enter the selected text when opening the “Replace”
      dialog.
  - C API
    - gh-106560: Fix redundant declarations in the public C API.
      Declare PyBool_Type, PyLong_Type and PySys_Audit() only once.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-112438: Fix support of format units “es”, “et”, “es#”, and
      “et#” in nested tuples in PyArg_ParseTuple()-like functions.
    - gh-111545: Add Py_HashPointer() function to hash a pointer.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-65210: Change the declaration of the keywords parameter of
      PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords() and
      PyArg_VaParseTupleAndKeywords() for better compatibility with
      C++.

- Update to 3.13.0a2:

Python 3.13.0 alpha 2¶
  - Core and Builtins:
    - Don’t include comments in f-string debug expressions. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - Slightly optimize the Tier 2 (uop) interpreter by only
      loading oparg and operand when needed. Also double the
      trace size limit again, to 512 this time.
    - Change docstrings of __dict__ and __weakref__.
    - Lower the max parser stack depth to 1000 under WASI debug
      builds.
    - When Python is built in debug mode, set the C recursion
      limit to 500 instead of 1500. A debug build is likely built
      with low optimization level which implies higher stack
      memory usage than a release build. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Enable translating unspecialized FOR_ITER to Tier 2.
    - Make hashlib related modules thread-safe without the GIL
    - Deprecate assignment to a function’s __code__ field when
      the new code object is of a mismatched type (e.g., from a
      generator to a plain function).
    - Raise exception if frame.clear() is called on a suspended
      frame.
    - Implement native thread ids for GNU KFreeBSD.
    - Use exponential backoff to reduce the number of failed tier
      2 optimization attempts by over 99%.
    - Joining a thread now ensures the underlying OS thread has
      exited. This is required for safer fork() in multi-threaded
      processes.
    - Make sure that tier 2 traces are de-optimized if the code
      is instrumented
    - Specialize slot loads and stores for _Py_T_OBJECT as well
      as Py_T_OBJECT_EX
    - Speed up BaseExceptionGroup.derive(),
      BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup(), and
      BaseExceptionGroup.split() by changing how they parse
      passed arguments.
    - Fix runtime crash when some error happens in opcode
      LOAD_FROM_DICT_OR_DEREF.
    - Add support for sharing tuples between interpreters using
      the cross-interpreter API. Patch by Anthony Shaw.
    - The oparg of YIELD_VALUE is now 1 if the instruction
      is part of a yield-from or await, and 0 otherwise. The
      SUSPENDED frame state is now split into SUSPENDED and
      SUSPENDED_YIELD_FROM. This simplifies the code in
      _PyGen_yf.
    - Merge the Tier 1 (bytecode) and Tier 2 (micro-ops)
      interpreters together, moving the Tier 2 interpreter
      loop and switch into _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault() in
      Python/ceval.c. The Python/executor.c file is gone. Also
      the TIER_ONE and TIER_TWO macros are now handled by the
      code generator. Beware! This changes the environment
      variables to enable micro-ops and their debugging to
      PYTHON_UOPS and PYTHON_LLTRACE.
    - Speed up Traceback object creation by lazily compute the
      line number. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Allow type comments in parenthesized with statements
    - Add support for sharing floats between interpreters using
      the cross-interpreter API. Patch by Anthony Shaw.
    - Add support for sharing of True and False between
      interpreters using the cross-interpreter API. Patch by
      Anthony Shaw.
    - Fix a bug where iso2022_jp_3 and iso2022_jp_2004 codecs
      read out of bounds
    - Fix an issue in the codeop that was causing SyntaxError
      exceptions raised in the presence of invalid syntax to not
      contain precise error messages. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Fix a bug that was causing SyntaxWarning to appear twice
      when parsing if invalid syntax is encountered later. Patch
      by Pablo galindo
    - Added a new environment variable PYTHON_FROZEN_MODULES. It
      determines whether or not frozen modules are ignored by
      the import machinery, equivalent of the -X frozen_modules
      command-line option.
    - Remove oparg from YIELD_VALUE. Change oparg of RESUME to
      include information about the except-depth. These changes
      make it possible to simplify the code in generator close.
    - Fix a regression that prevented jumping across is None and
      is not None when debugging. Patch by Savannah Ostrowski.
    - Show source lines in tracebacks when using the -c option
      when running Python. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Fix a bug where a global declaration in an except block is
      rejected when the global is used in the else block.
    - Fix error messages for indented blocks with functions
      and classes with generic type parameters. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo
    - Remove unnecessary instruction pointer updates before
      returning from frames.
    - Correctly display the traceback for MemoryError exceptions
      using the traceback module. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Fixed crash due to improperly initialized static
      MemoryError in subinterpreter.
    - Return NULL for PyTrace_RETURN events caused by an
      exception
    - Fix argument parsing by _PyArg_UnpackKeywordsWithVararg
      for functions defining pos-or-keyword, vararg, and kw-only
      parameters.
    - Replace prev_instr on the interpreter frame by instr_ptr
      which points to the beginning of the instruction that
      is currently executing (or will execute once the frame
      resumes).
    - Allow the repl to show source code and complete
      tracebacks. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Add PYTHON_PRESITE=package.module to import a module
      early in the interpreter lifecycle before site.py is
      executed. Python needs to be built in debug mode for this
      option to exist.
    - Implement biased reference counting in --disable-gil
      builds.
    - Fix regression in Python 3.12 where
      types.CodeType.replace() would produce a broken code object
      if called on a module or class code object that contains a
      comprehension. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - Removed chained classmethod descriptors (introduced in
      bpo-19072). This can no longer be used to wrap other
      descriptors such as property. The core design of this
      feature was flawed and caused a number of downstream
      problems. To “pass-through” a classmethod, consider using
      the __wrapped__ attribute that was added in Python 3.10.
    - Use local events for opcode tracing
    - Add mimalloc memory allocator support.
    - When PyConfig.stdlib_dir is explicitly set, it’s now
      respected and won’t be overridden by PyConfig.home.
    - Fix incorrect SystemError about AST constructor recursion
      depth mismatch.
    - Improve error message for unterminated strings with
      escapes.
    - Improved error messages for elif/else statements not
      matching any valid statements. Patch by Jeremiah Vivian.
  - Library
    - Fix SystemError in the TextIOWrapper constructor with
      non-encodable “errors” argument in non-debug mode.
    - Added the NI_IDN constant to the socket module when present
      in C at build time for use with socket.getnameinfo().
    - Issue warning message instead of having RuntimeError be
      displayed when event loop has already been closed at
      StreamWriter.__del__().
    - Fix crashes in io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure() when pass
      invalid arguments, e.g. non-string encoding.
    - curses: restore wide character support (including
      curses.unget_wch() and get_wch()) on macOS, which was
      unavailable due to a regression in Python 3.12.
    - contextlib.suppress now supports suppressing exceptions
      raised as part of a BaseExceptionGroup, in addition to the
      recent support for ExceptionGroup.
    - The mmap.mmap class now has an seekable() method that
      can be used where it requires a file-like object with
      seekable and the seek() method return the new absolute
      position. Patch by Donghee Na.
    - Remove posix.fallocate() under WASI as the underlying
      posix_fallocate() is not available in WASI preview2.
    - Fix truncating arguments on an embedded null character in
      os.putenv() and os.unsetenv() on Windows.
    - wsgiref.util.is_hop_by_hop() is now exposed correctly in
      __all__.
    - Avoid executing the default function in cmd.Cmd in an
      except block
    - Fix doctest for SyntaxError not-builtin subclasses.
    - Add extra argument validation for alias command in pdb
    - time: Make time.clock_gettime() and time.clock_gettime_ns()
      functions up to 2x faster by faster calling
      convention. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Call loop exception handler for exceptions in
      client_connected_cb of asyncio.start_server() so that
      applications can handle it. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - Fix reference leaks in bind_class() and bind_all() methods
      of tkinter widgets.
    - asyncio.loop.create_unix_server() will now automatically
      remove the Unix socket when the server is closed.
    - Added io.text_encoding(), io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, and
      io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder to io.__all__.
    - Remove the code to set the REMOTE_HOST header from wsgiref
      module, as it is unreachable. This header is used for
      performance reasons, which is not necessary in the wsgiref
      module.
    - Speed up pathlib.PurePath.relative_to() and
      is_relative_to().
    - Fixed typo in math.sumprod().
    - Remove mention of not supported “vsapi” element type
      in tkinter.ttk.Style.element_create(). Add tests for
      element_create() and other ttk.Style methods. Add examples
      for element_create() in the documentation.
    - Add show_group parameter to
      traceback.format_exception_only(), which allows to format
      ExceptionGroup instances.
    - Another attempt at fixing asyncio.Server.wait_closed(). It
      now blocks until both conditions are true: the server is
      closed, and there are no more active connections. (This
      means that in some cases where in 3.12.0 this function
      would incorrectly have returned immediately, it will now
      block; in particular, when there are no active connections
      but the server hasn’t been closed yet.)
    - Optimize recursive wildcards in pathlib.
    - Fix time not checking for errors when initializing.
    - Add error checking during _socket module init.
    - Fix _blake2 not checking for errors when initializing.
    - Fix select not checking for errors when initializing.
    - Fix ssl not checking for errors when initializing.
    - Fix crash in io.BytesIO.getbuffer() called repeatedly for
      empty BytesIO.
    - Postpone removal version for locale.getdefaultlocale() to
      Python 3.15.
    - Fix doctest output comparison for exceptions with notes.
    - Fix invalid state handling in asyncio.TaskGroup and
      asyncio.Timeout. They now raise proper RuntimeError if they
      are improperly used and are left in consistent state after
      this.
    - Make turtledemo run without default root enabled.
    - Support alias and convenience vars for pdb completion
    - Added newline parameter to pathlib.Path.read_text(). Patch
      by Junya Okabe.
    - Make pdb enter post-mortem mode even for SyntaxError
    - Set f_trace_lines = True on all frames upon pdb.set_trace()
    - Expose the setup and cleanup portions of
      asyncio.run_forever() as the standalone
      methods asyncio.run_forever_setup() and
      asyncio.run_forever_cleanup(). This allows for tighter
      integration with GUI event loops.
    - Support setting the asyncio.Runner loop_factory kwarg in
      unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase
    - Fix tty.setraw() and tty.setcbreak(): previously they
      returned partially modified list of the original tty
      attributes. tty.cfmakeraw() and tty.cfmakecbreak() now make
      a copy of the list of special characters before modifying
      it.
    - Make line number of function breakpoint more precise in pdb
    - Emit deprecation warning for non-integer numbers in gettext
      functions and methods that consider plural forms even if
      the translation was not found.
    - Ensure that select.kqueue() objects correctly appear as
      closed in forked children, to prevent operations on an
      invalid file descriptor.
    - Add __reduce__ method to IPv6Address in order to keep
      scope_id
    - Improve errors for unsupported look-behind patterns. Now
      re.error is raised instead of OverflowError or RuntimeError
      for too large width of look-behind pattern.
    - Add the ipaddress.IPv4Address.ipv6_mapped property, which
      retuns the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.
    - Implement the CLI of the symtable module and improve the
      repr of Symbol.
    - Improved error handling in pdb command line interface,
      making it produce more concise error messages.
    - Change compileall to only strip the stripdir prefix from  .
    Prthe full path recorded in the compiled .pyc file, when    .
    Prthe prefix matches the start of the full path in its      .
    Prentirety. When the prefix does not match, no stripping    .
    Pris performed and a warning to this effect is displayed    .
    Previously all path components of the stripdir prefix that  .
    Prmatched the full path were removed, while those that did  .
    Prnot match were left alone (including ones interspersed    .
    Prbetween matching components)                              .
    - Make the DictProxy and ListProxy types in
      multiprocessing.managers Generic Alias Types for [] use in
      typing contexts.
    - Add glob.translate(). This function converts a pathname
      with shell-style wildcards to a regular expression.
    - Define USE_XATTRS on Cygwin so that XATTR-related functions
      in the os module become available.
    - New methods mailbox.Maildir.get_info(),
      mailbox.Maildir.set_info(), mailbox.Maildir.get_flags(),
      mailbox.Maildir.set_flags(), mailbox.Maildir.add_flag(),
      mailbox.Maildir.remove_flag(). These methods speed up
      accessing a message’s info and/or flags and are useful
      when it is not necessary to access the message’s contents,
      as when iterating over a Maildir to find messages with
      specific flags.
    - Fix returning of empty byte strings after seek in zipfile
      module
    - Added a parameter local_exit for code.interact() to
      prevent exit() and quit from closing sys.stdin and raise
      SystemExit.
    - Change the behavior of tkinter.Text.count(). It now always
      returns an integer if one or less counting options are
      specified. Previously it could return a single count as a
      1-tuple, an integer (only if option "update" was specified)
      or None if no items found. The result is now the same if
      wantobjects is set to 0.
    - Switch the storage of the unicode codepoint names to
      use a different data-structure, a directed acyclic word
      graph. This makes the unicodedata shared library about 440
      KiB smaller. Contributed by Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick
      using code from the PyPy project.
    - Omit the interface scope from an IPv6 address when used as
      Host header by http.client.
    - zipinfo now supports the full range of values in the TZ
      string determined by RFC 8536 and detects all invalid
      formats. Both Python and C implementations now raise
      exceptions of the same type on invalid data.
  - Tests
    - Make the default value of test.support.infinite_recursion()
      to be conditional based on whether optimizations were used
      when compiling the interpreter. This helps with platforms
      like WASI whose stack size is greatly restricted in debug
      builds.
    - Gathering line coverage of standard libraries within the
      regression test suite is now precise, as well as much
      faster. Patch by Łukasz Langa.
    - Make regrtest --verbose3 option compatible with
      --huntrleaks -jN options. The ./python -m test -j1 -R 3:3
      --verbose3 command now works as expected. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - Remove no longer used functions run_unittest() and
      run_doctest() from the test.support module.
    - Fix regrtest if the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment
      variable is defined: use the variable value as the random
      seed. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - test_gdb: Fix detection of gdb built without Python
      scripting support. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Test case matching patterns specified by options --match,
      --ignore, --matchfile and --ignorefile are now tested in
      the order of specification, and the last match determines
      whether the test case be run or ignored.
    - Add unit test for usercustomize and sitecustomize hooks
      from site.
  - Build
    - Make make regen-unicodedata work for out-of-tree builds of
      CPython.
    - Add Tools/build/regen-configure.sh script to regenerate
      the configure with an Ubuntu container image. The
      quay.io/tiran/cpython_autoconf:271 container image
      (tiran/cpython_autoconf) is no longer used. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - For wasi-threads, memory is now exported to fix
      compatibility issues with some wasm runtimes.
    - AIX 32bit needs -latomic to build the _testcapi extension
      module.
    - The errno, md5, resource, winsound, _ctypes_test,
      _multiprocessing.posixshmem, _scproxy, _stat,
      _testimportmultiple and _uuid C extensions are now built
      with the limited C API. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - IDLE
    - Add docstrings to the IDLE debugger module. Fix two
      bugs: initialize Idb.botframe (should be in Bdb); in
      Idb.in_rpc_code, check whether prev_frame is None before
      trying to use it. Greatly expand test_debugger.
  - Tools/Demos
    - Argument Clinic now supports the @critical_section
      directive that instructs Argument Clinic to generate a
      critical section around the function call, which locks the
      self object in --disable-gil builds. Patch by Sam Gross.
  - C API
    - Add again the private _PyThreadState_UncheckedGet()
      function as an alias to the new public
      PyThreadState_GetUnchecked() function. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - Restore the removed _PyDict_GetItemStringWithError()
      function. It is used by numpy. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Restore removed private C API functions, macros and
      structures which have no simple replacement for now:
        _PyDict_GetItem_KnownHash()
        _PyDict_NewPresized()
        _PyHASH_BITS
        _PyHASH_IMAG
        _PyHASH_INF
        _PyHASH_MODULUS
        _PyHASH_MULTIPLIER
        _PyLong_Copy()

    - Add again <ctype.h> and <unistd.h> includes in Python.h,
      but don’t include them in the limited C API version 3.13
      and newer. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Add internal-only one-time initialization API: _PyOnceFlag
      and _PyOnceFlag_CallOnce.
    - Add PyDict_Pop() and PyDict_PopString() functions:
      remove a key from a dictionary and optionally return the
      removed value. This is similar to dict.pop(), but without
      the default value and not raising KeyError if the key
      missing. Patch by Stefan Behnel and Victor Stinner.
    - Rename Py_NOGIL to Py_GIL_DISABLED. Patch by Hugo van
      Kemenade.
    - Add PyList_Extend() and PyList_Clear() functions: similar
      to Python list.extend() and list.clear() methods. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - On Windows, Python.h no longer includes the <stddef.h>
      standard header file. If needed, it should now be included
      explicitly. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Implement “Python Critical Sections” from PEP 703. These
      are macros to help replace the GIL with per-object locks in
      the --disable-gil build of CPython. The macros are no-ops
      in the default build.
    - In the limited C API version 3.13, Py_SET_REFCNT() function
      is now implemented as an opaque function call. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - Add PyErr_FormatUnraisable() function.
    - Move the undocumented private _PyArg functions
      and _PyArg_Parser structure to internal C API
      (pycore_modsupport.h). Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Support non-ASCII keyword names in
      PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords().
    - Introduced PyUnstable_PerfTrampoline_CompileCode(),
      PyUnstable_PerfTrampoline_SetPersistAfterFork() and
      PyUnstable_CopyPerfMapFile(). These functions allow
      extension modules to initialize trampolines eagerly, after
      the application is “warmed up”. This makes it possible to
      have perf-trampolines running in an always-enabled fashion.
    - Add the PySys_Audit() function to the limited C API. Patch
      by Victor Stinner.
    - Add PyMem_RawMalloc(), PyMem_RawCalloc(),
      PyMem_RawRealloc() and PyMem_RawFree() to the limited C
      API. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Functions PyDict_GetItem(), PyDict_GetItemString(),
      PyMapping_HasKey(), PyMapping_HasKeyString(),
      PyObject_HasAttr(), PyObject_HasAttrString(), and
      PySys_GetObject(), which clear all errors occurred
      during calling the function, report now them using
      sys.unraisablehook().
    - Remove redundant C-contiguity check in getargs.c, binascii,
      ssl and Argument Clinic. Patched by Stefan Krah and Furkan
      Onder
- Adjust patches:
  - bpo-31046_ensurepip_honours_prefix.patch
  - fix_configure_rst.patch
  - python-3.3.0b1-fix_date_time_compiler.patch
  - python-3.3.0b1-test-posix_fadvise.patch

Fri Oct 13 17:35:43 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.13.0a1:
  * Allow the count argument of str.replace() to be a keyword. (Contributed by
    Hugo van Kemenade in gh-106487.)
  * Compiler now strip indents from docstrings. This will reduce the size of
    bytecode cache (e.g. .pyc file). For example, cache file size for
    sqlalchemy.orm.session in SQLAlchemy 2.0 is reduced by about 5%. This
    change will affect tools using docstrings, like doctest. (Contributed by
    Inada Naoki in gh-81283.)
  * The compile() built-in can now accept a new flag, ast.PyCF_OPTIMIZED_AST,
    which is similar to ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST except that the returned AST is
    optimized according to the value of the optimize argument. (Contributed by
    Irit Katriel in gh-108113).
  * multiprocessing, concurrent.futures, compileall: Replace os.cpu_count()
    with os.process_cpu_count() to select the default number of worker threads
    and processes. Get the CPU affinity if supported. (Contributed by Victor
    Stinner in gh-109649.)
  * os.path.realpath() now resolves MS-DOS style file names even if the file is
    not accessible. (Contributed by Moonsik Park in gh-82367.)

Mon Oct  2 17:15:53 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to the final release of 3.12.0:
  Python 3.12 is the latest stable release of the Python
  programming language, with a mix of changes to the language and
  the standard library. The library changes focus on cleaning up
  deprecated APIs, usability, and correctness. Of note, the
  distutils package has been removed from the standard library.
  Filesystem support in os and pathlib has seen a number of
  improvements, and several modules have better performance.
  The language changes focus on usability, as f-strings have had
  many limitations removed and ‘Did you mean …’ suggestions
  continue to improve. The new type parameter syntax and type
  statement improve ergonomics for using generic types and type
  aliases with static type checkers.
  This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete
  specification of all new features, but instead gives
  a convenient overview. For full details, you should refer to
  the documentation, such as the Library Reference and Language
  Reference. If you want to understand the complete
  implementation and design rationale for a change, refer to the
  PEP for a particular new feature; but note that PEPs usually
  are not kept up-to-date once a feature has been fully
  implemented.
  - New syntax features:
      - PEP 695, type parameter syntax and the type statement
  - New grammar features:
      - PEP 701, f-strings in the grammar
  - Interpreter improvements:
      - PEP 684, a unique per-interpreter GIL
      - PEP 669, low impact monitoring
      - Improved ‘Did you mean …’ suggestions for NameError,
        ImportError, and SyntaxError exceptions
  - Python data model improvements:
      - PEP 688, using the buffer protocol from Python
  - Significant improvements in the standard library:
      - The pathlib.Path class now supports subclassing
      - The os module received several improvements for Windows
        support
      - A command-line interface has been added to the sqlite3
        module
      - isinstance() checks against runtime-checkable protocols
        enjoy a speed up of between two and 20 times
      - The asyncio package has had a number of performance
        improvements, with some benchmarks showing a 75% speed
        up.
      - A command-line interface has been added to the uuid
        module
      - Due to the changes in PEP 701, producing tokens via the
        tokenize module is up to up to 64% faster.
  - Security improvements:
      - Replace the builtin hashlib implementations of SHA1,
        SHA3, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, and MD5 with formally verified
        code from the HACL* project. These builtin
        implementations remain as fallbacks that are only used
        when OpenSSL does not provide them.
  - C API improvements:
      - PEP 697, unstable C API tier
      - PEP 683, immortal objects
  - CPython implementation improvements:
      - PEP 709, comprehension inlining
      - CPython support for the Linux perf profiler
      - Implement stack overflow protection on supported
        platforms
  - New typing features:
      - PEP 692, using TypedDict to annotate **kwargs
      - PEP 698, typing.override() decorator
  - Important deprecations, removals or restrictions:
      - PEP 623: Remove wstr from Unicode objects in Python’s
        C API, reducing the size of every str object by at least
        8 bytes.
      - PEP 632: Remove the distutils package. See the migration
        guide for advice replacing the APIs it provided. The
        third-party Setuptools package continues to provide
        distutils, if you still require it in Python 3.12 and
        beyond.
      - gh-95299: Do not pre-install setuptools in virtual
        environments created with venv. This means that
        distutils, setuptools, pkg_resources, and easy_install
        will no longer available by default; to access these run
        pip install setuptools in the activated virtual
        environment.
      - The asynchat, asyncore, and imp modules have been
        removed, along with several unittest.TestCase method
        aliases.
- Refresh bluez-devel-vendor.tar.xz from bluez-devel 5.69-1.1.

Wed Sep 20 07:14:17 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.12.0rc3:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-109496: On a Python built in debug mode, Py_DECREF() now
      calls _Py_NegativeRefcount() if the object is a dangling pointer
      to deallocated memory: memory filled with 0xDD “dead byte” by
      the debug hook on memory allocators. The fix is to check the
      reference count before checking for _Py_IsImmortal(). Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-109371: Deopted instructions correctly for tool
      initialization and modified the incorrect assertion in
      instrumentation, when a previous tool already sets INSTRUCTION
      events
    - gh-105658: Fix bug where the line trace of an except block
      ending with a conditional includes an excess event with the line
      of the conditional expression.
    - gh-109219: Fix compiling type param scopes that use a name which
      is also free in an inner scope.
    - gh-109341: Fix crash when compiling an invalid AST involving a
      ast.TypeAlias.
    - gh-109195: Fix source location for the LOAD_* instruction
      preceding a LOAD_SUPER_ATTR to load the super global (or
      shadowing variable) so that it encompasses only the name super
      and not the following parentheses.
    - gh-109118: Disallow nested scopes (lambdas, generator
      expressions, and comprehensions) within PEP 695 annotation
      scopes that are nested within classes.
    - gh-109114: Relax the detection of the error message for invalid
      lambdas inside f-strings to not search for arbitrary replacement
      fields to avoid false positives. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-109118: Fix interpreter crash when a NameError is raised
      inside the type parameters of a generic class.
    - gh-108976: Fix crash that occurs after de-instrumenting a code
      object in a monitoring callback.
    - gh-108732: Make iteration variables of module- and class-scoped
      comprehensions visible to pdb and other tools that use
      frame.f_locals again.
    - gh-108959: Fix caret placement for error locations for subscript
      and binary operations that involve non-semantic parentheses and
      spaces. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Library
    - gh-108682: Enum: require names=() or type=... to create an empty
      enum using the functional syntax.
    - gh-108843: Fix an issue in ast.unparse() when unparsing
      f-strings containing many quote types.
  - Documentation
    - gh-102823: Document the return type of x // y when x and y have
      type float.
  - Tests
    - gh-109396: Fix test_socket.test_hmac_sha1() in FIPS mode. Use a
      longer key: FIPS mode requires at least of at least 112 bits.
      The previous key was only 32 bits. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-104736: Fix test_gdb on Python built with LLVM clang 16 on
      Linux ppc64le (ex: Fedora 38). Search patterns in gdb “bt”
      command output to detect when gdb fails to retrieve the
      traceback. For example, skip a test if Backtrace stopped: frame
      did not save the PC is found. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-109237: Fix test_site.test_underpth_basic() when the working
      directory contains at least one non-ASCII character: encode the
      ._pth file to UTF-8 and enable the UTF-8 Mode to use UTF-8 for
      the child process stdout. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-109230: Fix test_pyexpat.test_exception(): it can now be run
      from a directory different than Python source code directory.
      Before, the test failed in this case. Skip the test if
      Modules/pyexpat.c source is not available. Skip also the test on
      Python implementations other than CPython. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - gh-109015: Fix test_asyncio, test_imaplib and test_socket tests
      on FreeBSD if the TCP blackhole is enabled (sysctl
      net.inet.tcp.blackhole). Skip the few tests which failed with
      ETIMEDOUT which such non standard configuration. Currently, the
      FreeBSD GCP image enables TCP and UDP blackhole (sysctl
      net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2 and sysctl net.inet.udp.blackhole=1).
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-91960: Skip test_gdb if gdb is unable to retrieve Python
      frame objects: if a frame is <optimized out>. When Python is
      built with “clang -Og”, gdb can fail to retrive the frame
      parameter of _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault(). In this case, tests
      like py_bt() are likely to fail. Without getting access to
      Python frames, python-gdb.py is mostly clueless on retrieving
      the Python traceback. Moreover, test_gdb is no longer skipped on
      macOS if Python is built with Clang. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108962: Skip test_tempfile.test_flags() if chflags() fails
      with “OSError: [Errno 45] Operation not supported” (ex: on
      FreeBSD 13). Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108851: Fix test_tomllib recursion tests for WASI buildbots:
      reduce the recursion limit and compute the maximum nested
      array/dict depending on the current available recursion limit.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108851: Add get_recursion_available() and
      get_recursion_depth() functions to the test.support module.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108834: Add --fail-rerun option option to regrtest: if a test
      failed when then passed when rerun in verbose mode, exit the
      process with exit code 2 (error), instead of exit code 0
      (success). Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108834: Rename regrtest --verbose2 option (-w) to --rerun.
      Keep --verbose2 as a deprecated alias. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108834: When regrtest reruns failed tests in verbose mode
      (./python -m test --rerun), tests are now rerun in fresh worker
      processes rather than being executed in the main process. If a
      test does crash or is killed by a timeout, the main process can
      detect and handle the killed worker process. Tests are rerun in
      parallel if the -jN option is used to run tests in parallel.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-103186: Suppress and assert expected RuntimeWarnings in
      test_sys_settrace.py
  - Build
    - gh-108740: Fix a race condition in make regen-all. The
      deepfreeze.c source and files generated by Argument Clinic are
      now generated or updated before generating “global objects”.
      Previously, some identifiers may miss depending on the order in
      which these files were generated. Patch by Victor Stinner.
- Python 3.12.0 release candidate 2:
  - Security
    - gh-108310: Fixed an issue where instances of ssl.SSLSocket were
      vulnerable to a bypass of the TLS handshake and included
      protections (like certificate verification) and treating sent
      unencrypted data as if it were post-handshake TLS encrypted
      data. Security issue reported as CVE-2023-40217 by Aapo Oksman.
      Patch by Gregory P. Smith.
    - gh-107774: PEP 669 specifies that
      sys.monitoring.register_callback will generate an audit event.
      Pre-releases of Python 3.12 did not generate the audit event.
      This is now fixed.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-108520: Fix
      multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock.__setstate__() to properly
      initialize multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock._is_fork_ctx.
      This fixes a regression when passing a SemLock accross nested
      processes.
    - Rename multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock.is_fork_ctx to
      multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock._is_fork_ctx to avoid
      exposing it as public API.
    - gh-108654: Restore locals shadowed by an inlined comprehension
      if the comprehension raises an exception.
    - gh-108487: Change an assert that would cause a spurious crash in
      a devious case that should only trigger deoptimization.
    - gh-106176: Use a WeakValueDictionary to track the lists
      containing the modules each thread is currently importing. This
      helps avoid a reference leak from keeping the list around longer
      than necessary. Weakrefs are used as GC can’t interrupt the
      cleanup.
    - gh-107901: Fix missing line number on JUMP_BACKWARD at the end
      of a for loop.
    - gh-108390: Raise an exception when setting a non-local event
      (RAISE, EXCEPTION_HANDLED, etc.) in
      sys.monitoring.set_local_events.
    - Fixes crash when tracing in recursive calls to Python classes.
    - gh-91051: Fix abort / segfault when using all eight type watcher
      slots, on platforms where char is signed by default.
    - gh-107724: In pre-release versions of 3.12, up to rc1, the
      sys.monitoring callback function for the PY_THROW event was
      missing the third, exception argument. That is now fixed.
    - gh-107080: Trace refs builds (--with-trace-refs) were crashing
      when used with isolated subinterpreters. The problematic global
      state has been isolated to each interpreter. Other fixing the
      crashes, this change does not affect users.
    - gh-77377: Ensure that multiprocessing synchronization objects
      created in a fork context are not sent to a different process
      created in a spawn context. This changes a segfault into an
      actionable RuntimeError in the parent process.
  - Library
    - gh-108469: ast.unparse() now supports new f-string syntax
      introduced in Python 3.12. Note that the f-string quotes are
      reselected for simplicity under the new syntax. (Patch by Steven
      Sun)
    - gh-108682: Enum: raise TypeError if super().__new__() is called
      from a custom __new__.
    - gh-108295: Fix crashes related to use of weakrefs on
      typing.TypeVar.
    - gh-64662: Fix support for virtual tables in
      sqlite3.Connection.iterdump(). Patch by Aviv Palivoda.
    - gh-108111: Fix a regression introduced in gh-101251 for 3.12,
      resulting in an incorrect offset calculation in
      gzip.GzipFile.seek().
    - gh-105736: Harmonized the pure Python version of OrderedDict
      with the C version. Now, both versions set up their internal
      state in __new__. Formerly, the pure Python version did the set
      up in __init__.
    - gh-108083: Fix bugs in the constructor of sqlite3.Connection and
      sqlite3.Connection.close() where exceptions could be leaked.
      Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - gh-107963: Fix multiprocessing.set_forkserver_preload() to check
      the given list of modules names. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
    - gh-106242: Fixes os.path.normpath() to handle embedded null
      characters without truncating the path.
    - gh-107913: Fix possible losses of errno and winerror values in
      OSError exceptions if they were cleared or modified by the
      cleanup code before creating the exception object.
    - gh-107845: tarfile.data_filter() now takes the location of
      symlinks into account when determining their target, so it will
      no longer reject some valid tarballs with
      LinkOutsideDestinationError.
    - gh-107805: Fix signatures of module-level generated functions in
      turtle.
    - gh-107715: Fix doctest.DocTestFinder.find() in presence of class
      names with special characters. Patch by Gertjan van Zwieten.
    - gh-100814: Passing a callable object as an option value to a
      Tkinter image now raises the expected TclError instead of an
      AttributeError.
    - gh-106684: Close asyncio.StreamWriter when it is not closed by
      application leading to memory leaks. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - gh-107396: tarfiles; Fixed use before assignment of
      self.exception for gzip decompression
    - gh-106052: re module: fix the matching of possessive quantifiers
      in the case of a subpattern containing backtracking.
    - gh-100061: Fix a bug that causes wrong matches for regular
      expressions with possessive qualifier.
    - gh-99203: Restore following CPython <= 3.10.5 behavior of
      shutil.make_archive(): do not create an empty archive if
      root_dir is not a directory, and, in that case, raise
      FileNotFoundError or NotADirectoryError regardless of format
      choice. Beyond the brought-back behavior, the function may now
      also raise these exceptions in dry_run mode.
  - Documentation
    - gh-105052: Update timeit doc to specify that time in seconds is just the default.
  - Tests
    - gh-89392: Removed support of test_main() function in tests. They
      now always use normal unittest test runner.
    - gh-108388: Convert test_concurrent_futures to a package of 7
      sub-tests. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108388: Split test_multiprocessing_fork,
      test_multiprocessing_forkserver and test_multiprocessing_spawn
      into test packages. Each package is made of 4 sub-tests:
      processes, threads, manager and misc. It allows running more
      tests in parallel and so reduce the total test duration. Patch
      by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-105776: Fix test_cppext when the C compiler command -std=c11
      option: remove -std= options from the compiler command. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-107178: Add the C API test for functions in the Mapping
      Protocol, the Sequence Protocol and some functions in the Object
      Protocol.
  - Build
    - gh-63760: Fix Solaris build: no longer redefine the
      gethostname() function. Solaris defines the function since 2005.
      Patch by Victor Stinner, original patch by Jakub Kulík.
    - gh-107814: When calling find_python.bat with -q it did not
      properly silence the output of nuget. That is now fixed.
  - Windows
    - gh-107565: Update Windows build to use OpenSSL 3.0.10.
    - gh-106242: Fixes realpath() to behave consistently when passed a
      path containing an embedded null character on Windows. In strict
      mode, it now raises OSError instead of the unexpected
      ValueError, and in non-strict mode will make the path absolute.
    - gh-106844: Fix integer overflow and truncating by the null
      character in _winapi.LCMapStringEx() which affects
      ntpath.normcase().
  - macOS
    - gh-107565: Update macOS installer to use OpenSSL 3.0.10.
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-107565: Update multissltests and GitHub CI workflows to use
      OpenSSL 1.1.1v, 3.0.10, and 3.1.2.
    - gh-95065: Argument Clinic now supports overriding automatically
      generated signature by using directive @text_signature.
  - C API
    - gh-107916: C API functions PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename(),
      PyErr_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilename() and
      PyErr_SetFromWindowsErrWithFilename() save now the error code
      before calling PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault().
    - gh-107915: Such C API functions as PyErr_SetString(),
      PyErr_Format(), PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename() and many others
      no longer crash or ignore errors if it failed to format the
      error message or decode the filename. Instead, they keep a
      corresponding error.
    - gh-107810: Improve DeprecationWarning for uses of PyType_Spec
      with metaclasses that have custom tp_new.

Mon Aug  7 07:31:27 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Refresh all patches
- Drop Revert-gh105127-left-tests.patch, in upstream now
- Update to 3.12.0rc1:
  - Reverted the :mod:`email.utils` security improvement change
    released in 3.12beta4 that unintentionally caused
    :mod:`email.utils.getaddresses` to fail to parse email addresses
    with a comma in the quoted name field. See :gh:`106669`.
  - Start initializing ob_digit during creation of
    :c:type:`PyLongObject` objects. Patch by Illia Volochii.
  - Increase C recursion limit for functions other than the main
    interpreter from 800 to 1500. This should allow functions like
    list.__repr__ and json.dumps to handle all the inputs that they
    could prior to 3.12
  - Fix potential unaligned memory access on C APIs involving returned
    sequences of char * pointers within the :mod:`grp` and
    :mod:`socket` modules. These were revealed using a
    -fsaniziter=alignment build on ARM macOS. Patch by Christopher
    Chavez.
  - Add the exception as the third argument to PY_UNIND callbacks in
    sys.monitoring. This makes the PY_UNWIND callback consistent with
    the other exception hanlding callbacks.
  - Raise a ValueError when a monitoring callback funtion returns
    DISABLE for events that cannot be disabled locally.
  - Add a RERAISE event to sys.monitoring, which occurs when an
    exception is reraised, either explicitly by a plain raise
    statement, or implicitly in an except or finally block.
  - Unsupported modules now always fail to be imported.
  - Fix classmethod-style :func:`super` method calls (i.e., where the
    second argument to :func:`super`, or the implied second argument
    drawn from self/cls in the case of zero-arg super, is a type) when
    the target of the call is not a classmethod.
  - Python no longer crashes due an infrequent race when initialzing
    per-interpreter interned strings. The crash would manifest when
    the interpreter was finalized.
  - Python no longer crashes due to an infrequent race in setting
    Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding and Py_FileSystemDefaultEncodeErrors
    (both deprecated), when simultaneously initializing two isolated
    subinterpreters. Now they are only set during runtime
    initialization.
  - Fix a segmentation fault caused by a use-after-free bug in
    frame_dealloc when the trashcan delays the deallocation of a
    PyFrameObject.
  - No longer suppress arbitrary errors in the __annotations__ getter
    and setter in the type and module types.
  - Propagate frozen_modules to multiprocessing spawned process
    interpreters.
  - Prevent out-of-bounds memory access during mmap.find() calls.
  - Seems that in some conditions, OpenSSL will return
    SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL instead of SSL_ERROR_SSL when a certification
    verification has failed, but the error parameters will still
    contain ERR_LIB_SSL and SSL_R_CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED. We are
    now detecting this situation and raising the appropiate
    ssl.SSLCertVerificationError. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Fix :func:`types.get_original_bases` to only return
    :attr:`!__orig_bases__` if it is present on cls directly. Patch by
    James Hilton-Balfe.
  - Prevent memory leak and use-after-free when using pointers to
    pointers with ctypes
  - Make :func:`gettext.pgettext` search plural definitions when
    translation is not found.
  - Document behavior of :func:`shutil.disk_usage` for non-mounted
    filesystems on Unix.
  - Do not report MultipartInvariantViolationDefect defect when the
    :class:`email.parser.Parser` class is used to parse emails with
    headersonly=True.
  - Fix invalid result from :meth:`PurePath.relative_to` method when
    attempting to walk a ".." segment in other with walk_up enabled. A
    :exc:`ValueError` exception is now raised in this case.
  - Fix potential missing NULL check of d2i_SSL_SESSION result in
    _ssl.c.
  - Update the bundled copy of pip to version 23.2.1.
  - Fixed several bugs in zipfile.Path, including: in Path.match`,
    Windows separators are no longer honored (and never were meant to
    be); Fixed ``name/suffix/suffixes/stem operations when no filename
    is present and the Path is not at the root of the zipfile;
    Reworked glob for performance and more correct matching behavior.
  - Add __copy__ and __deepcopy__ in :mod:`enum`
  - Revert a change to :func:`colorsys.rgb_to_hls` that caused
    division by zero for certain almost-white inputs. Patch by Terry
    Jan Reedy.
  - Instances of :class:`typing.TypeVar`, :class:`typing.ParamSpec`,
    :class:`typing.ParamSpecArgs`, :class:`typing.ParamSpecKwargs`,
    and :class:`typing.TypeVarTuple` once again support weak
    references, fixing a regression introduced in Python 3.12.0 beta
    1. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  - Detect possible memory allocation failure in the libtommath
    function :c:func:`mp_init` used by the _tkinter module.
  - Fix crash when calling repr with a manually constructed SignalDict
    object. Patch by Charlie Zhao.
  - Change the default return value of
    :meth:`http.client.HTTPConnection.get_proxy_response_headers` to
    be None and not {}.
  - Ensure gettext(msg) retrieve translations even if a plural form
    exists. In other words: gettext(msg) == ngettext(msg, '', 1).
  - Add documentation for :c:type:`PyInterpreterConfig` and
    :c:func:`Py_NewInterpreterFromConfig`. Also clarify some of the
    nearby docs relative to per-interpreter GIL.
  - Document the :mod:`curses` module variables :const:`~curses.LINES`
    and :const:`~curses.COLS`.
  - Add a number of standard external names to nitpick_ignore.
  - Add documentation on how to localize the :mod:`argparse` module.
  - test_logging: Fix test_udp_reconnection() by increasing the
    timeout from 100 ms to 5 minutes (LONG_TIMEOUT). Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - test_capi: Fix test_no_FatalError_infinite_loop() to no longer
    write a coredump, by using test.support.SuppressCrashReport. Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - Avoid creating a reference to the test object in
    :meth:`~unittest.TestResult.collectedDurations`.
  - Moved tests for zipfile.Path into Lib/test/test_zipfile/_path.
    Made zipfile._path a package.
  - Check for linux/limits.h before including it in
    Modules/posixmodule.c.
  - Detect MPI compilers in :file:`configure`.
  - Add experimental wasi-threads support. Patch by Takashi Yamamoto.
  - Update Windows build to use OpenSSL 3.0.9
  - Update macOS installer to use OpenSSL 3.0.9.
  - Fix bugs in the Argument Clinic destination <name> clear command;
    the destination buffers would never be cleared, and the
    destination directive parser would simply continue to the fault
    handler after processing the command. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
  - freeze now fetches CONFIG_ARGS from the original CPython instance
    the Makefile uses to call utility scripts. Patch by Ijtaba
    Hussain.
  - :c:func:`PyModule_AddObjectRef` is now only available in the
    limited API version 3.10 or later.

Fri Aug  4 06:37:41 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add externally_managed.in to label this build as PEP-668 managed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  3 14:13:30 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- IT MEANS THAT bsc#1210638 STILL HAS NOT BEEN FIXED!
- Add Revert-gh105127-left-tests.patch (gh#python/cpython!106941)
  partially reverting CVE-2023-27043-email-parsing-errors.patch,
  because of the regression in gh#python/cpython#106669.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 11 22:20:22 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.12.0b4:
  - gh-issue-102988: CVE-2023-27043 (bsc#1210638): Prevent
    :func:`email.utils.parseaddr` and
    :func:`email.utils.getaddresses` from returning the realname
    portion of an invalid RFC2822 email header in the email
    address portion of the 2-tuple returned after being parsed by
    :class:`email._parseaddr.AddressList`.
  - gh-issue-106396: When the format specification of an
    f-string expression is empty, the parser now generates an
    empty :class:`ast.JoinedStr` node for it instead of an
    one-element :class:`ast.JoinedStr` with an empty string
    :class:`ast.Constant`.
  - gh-issue-106145: Make ``end_lineno`` and ``end_col_offset``
    required on ``type_param`` ast nodes.
  - gh-issue-105979: Fix crash in :func:`!_imp.get_frozen_object`
    due to improper exception handling.
  - gh-issue-98931: Ensure custom :exc:`SyntaxError` error
    messages are raised for invalid imports with multiple
    targets. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - gh-issue-105908: Fixed bug where :gh:`99111` breaks future
    import ``barry_as_FLUFL`` in the Python REPL.
  - gh-issue-105340: Include the comprehension iteration
    variable in ``locals()`` inside a module- or class-scope
    comprehension.
  - gh-issue-105486: Change the repr of ``ParamSpec`` list of
    args in ``types.GenericAlias``.
  - gh-issue-101006: Improve error handling when read
    :mod:`marshal` data.
  - gh-issue-106524: Fix crash in :func:`!_sre.template` with
    templates containing invalid group indices.
  - gh-issue-106510: Improve debug output for atomic groups in
    regular expressions.
  - gh-issue-106503: Fix ref cycle in
    :class:`!asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport` by removing
    ``_write_ready`` in ``close``.
  - gh-issue-105497: Fix flag mask inversion when unnamed flags
    exist.
  - gh-issue-90876: Prevent :mod:`multiprocessing.spawn` from
    failing to *import* in environments where ``sys.executable``
    is ``None``.  This regressed in 3.11 with the addition of
    support for path-like objects in multiprocessing.
  - gh-issue-106292: Check for an instance-dict
    cached value in the :meth:`__get__` method of
    :func:`functools.cached_property`. This better matches the
    pre-3.12 behavior and improves compatibility for users
    subclassing :func:`functools.cached_property` and adding a
    :meth:`__set__` method.
  - gh-issue-106330: Fix incorrect matching of empty paths in
    :meth:`pathlib.PurePath.match`. This bug was introduced in
    Python 3.12.0 beta 1.
  - gh-issue-102541: Make pydoc.doc catch bad module ImportError
    when output stream is not None.
  - gh-issue-106152: Added PY_THROW event hook for
    :mod:`cProfile` for generators
  - gh-issue-106075: Added `asyncio.taskgroups.__all__` to
    `asyncio.__all__` for export in star imports.
  - gh-issue-105987: Fix crash due to improper reference counting
    in :mod:`asyncio` eager task factory internal routines.
  - gh-issue-105974: Fix bug where a :class:`typing.Protocol`
    class that had one or more non-callable members would
    raise :exc:`TypeError` when :func:`issubclass` was called
    against it, even if it defined a custom ``__subclasshook__``
    method. The behaviour in Python 3.11 and lower -- which has
    now been restored -- was not to raise :exc:`TypeError` in
    these situations if a custom ``__subclasshook__`` method was
    defined. Patch by Alex Waygood.
  - gh-issue-96145: Reverted addition of ``json.AttrDict``.
  - gh-issue-105497: Fix flag inversion when alias/mask members
    exist.
  - gh-issue-104554: Add RTSPS scheme support in urllib.parse
  - gh-issue-94777: Fix hanging :mod:`multiprocessing`
    ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` when a child process crashes while
    data is being written in the call queue.
  - gh-issue-106232: Make timeit doc command lines compatible
    with Windows by using double quotes for arguments.  This
    works on linux and macOS also.
  - gh-issue-101634: When running the Python test suite with
    ``-jN`` option, if a worker stdout cannot be decoded from
    the locale encoding report a failed testn so the exitcode is
    non-zero. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-issue-106118: Fix compilation for platforms without
    :data:`!O_CLOEXEC`. The issue was introduced with Python
    3.12b1 in :gh:`103295`. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
  - gh-issue-104692: Include ``commoninstall`` as a prerequisite
    for ``bininstall``
    This ensures that ``commoninstall`` is completed before
    ``bininstall`` is started when parallel builds are used (``make
    -j install``), and so the ``python3`` symlink is only installed
    after all standard library modules are installed.
  - gh-issue-106359: Argument Clinic now explicitly forbids
    "kwarg splats" in function calls used as annotations.
  - gh-issue-105227: The new :c:func:`PyType_GetDict` provides
    the dictionary for the given type object that is normally
    exposed by ``cls.__dict__``. Normally it's sufficient to
    use :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_dict`, but for the static
    builtin types :c:member:`!tp_dict` is now always ``NULL``.
    :c:func:`!PyType_GetDict()` provides the correct dict object
    instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 28 19:59:03 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.12.0b3:
  - gh-103142: The version of OpenSSL used in Windows and
    Mac installers has been upgraded to 1.1.1u to address
    CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-0465, CVE-2023-0466, CVE-2023-0464,
    as well as CVE-2023-0286, CVE-2022-4303, and CVE-2022-4303
    fixed previously in 1.1.1t (gh-101727).
  - gh-102153: urllib.parse.urlsplit() now strips leading C0
    control and space characters following the specification for
    URLs defined by WHATWG in response to CVE-2023-24329.
  - gh-99889: Fixed a security in flaw in uu.decode() that could
    allow for directory traversal based on the input if no
    out_file was specified.
  - gh-104049: Do not expose the local on-disk
    location in directory indexes produced by
    http.client.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.
  - gh-103935: trace.__main__ now uses io.open_code() for files
    to be executed instead of raw open().
  - gh-102953: The extraction methods in tarfile, and
    shutil.unpack_archive(), have a new filter argument that
    allows limiting tar features than may be surprising or
    dangerous, such as creating files outside the destination
    directory. See Extraction filters for details.

Sat Mar 25 22:02:04 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.12.0a6:
  - Many new features for Python 3.12 are still being planned and
    written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:
    - Even more improved error messages. More exceptions
      potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the
      user.
    - Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python
      function names in traces.
    - The deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C
      implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP
      623.
    - In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods
      and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since
      Python 3.1 or 3.2).
    - The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been
      removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package
      (installed by default in virtualenvs and many other places)
      continues to provide the distutils module.
    - A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions,
      classes and methods have been removed.
    - Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn
      with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making
      them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the
      future.)
    - The internal representation of integers has changed in
      preparation for performance enhancements. (This should not
      affect most users as it is an internal detail, but it may
      cause problems for Cython-generated code.)
- Add the refreshed version of
  F00251-change-user-install-location.patch (updated from
  Fedora), which works together with the installation schemes in
  sysconfig.
- Remove distutils-reproducible-compile.patch, which is not
  applicable anymore (because distutils was removed from the
  standard library).
- Remove upstreamed support-expat-CVE-2022-25236-patched.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  8 14:59:50 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.1:
  - python -m http.server no longer allows terminal control
    characters sent within a garbage request to be printed
    to the stderr server lo This is done by changing the
    http.server BaseHTTPRequestHandler .log_message method to
    replace control characters with a \xHH hex escape before
    printin
  - Avoid publishing list of active per-interpreter audit hooks
    via the gc module
  - The IDNA codec decoder used on DNS hostnames by socket or
    asyncio related name resolution functions no longer involves
    a quadratic algorithm. This prevents a potential CPU denial
    of service if an out-of-spec excessive length hostname
    involving bidirectional characters were decoded. Some
    protocols such as urllib http 3xx redirects potentially allow
    for an attacker to supply such a name (CVE-2022-45061).
  - Update bundled libexpat to 2.5.0
  - Fix a shell code injection vulnerability in the
    get-remote-certificate.py example script. The script no
    longer uses a shell to run openssl commands. Issue reported
    and initial fix by Caleb Shortt. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Fix a crash when an object which does not have a dictionary
    frees its instance values.
  - Fix a bug in the tokenizer that could cause infinite
    recursion when showing syntax warnings that happen in the
    first line of the source. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Fix an issue that could cause frames to be visible to Python
    code as they are being torn down, possibly leading to memory
    corruption or hard crashes of the interpreter.
  - Fix a reference bug in _imp.create_builtin() after the
    creation of the first sub-interpreter for modules builtins
    and sys. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing a buffer overflow if the
    tokenizer copies a line missing the newline caracter from a
    file that is as long as the available tokenizer buffer. Patch
    by Pablo galindo
  - Fix bug where an ExceptionGroup subclass can wrap a
    BaseException.
  - Fix zip path for venv created from a non-installed python on
    POSIX platforms.
  - Fix an issue that could potentially cause incorrect error
    handling for some bytecode instructions.
  - Fix an issue that prevented PyThreadState and
    PyInterpreterState memory from being freed properly.
  - Fix failure in except* with unhashable exceptions.
  - Fix calculation of sys._base_executable when inside a POSIX
    virtual environment using copies of the python binary when
    the base installation does not provide the executable name
    used by the venv. Calculation will fall back to alternative
    names (“python<MAJOR>”, “python<MAJOR>.<MINOR>”).
  - Update faulthandler to emit an error message with the proper
    unexpected signal number. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Fix location of SyntaxError for a try block with both except
    and except*.
  - Fix the error reporting positions of specialized traceback
    anchors when the source line contains Unicode characters.
  - Fix subscription of type aliases containing bare generic
    types or types like TypeVar: for example tuple[A, T][int] and
    tuple[TypeVar, T][int], where A is a generic type, and T is a
    type variable.
  - Lower the recursion depth for marshal on WASI to support
    wasmtime 2.0/main.
  - Fix multiple crashes in debug mode when str subclasses are
    used instead of str itself.
  - Fix an issue where member descriptors (such as those for
    __slots__) could behave incorrectly or crash instead of
    raising a TypeError when accessed via an instance of an
    invalid type.
  - Suppress ImportError for invalid query for help()
    command. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Fix detection of MAC addresses for uuid on certain OSs. Patch
    by Chaim Sanders
  - Print exception class name instead of its string
    representation when raising errors from ctypes calls.
  - os.sched_yield() now release the GIL while calling
    sched_yield(2). Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Fix an issue that could delay the specialization of PRECALL
    instructions.
  - Bugfix: PyFunction_GetAnnotations() should return a borrowed
    reference. It was returning a new reference.
  - Ensure that all Python frame objects are backed by “complete”
    frames.
  - Fixed a missing incref/decref pair in
    Exception.__setstate__(). Patch by Ofey Chan.
  - Fix the Python path configuration used to initialized
    sys.path at Python startup. Paths are no longer encoded
    to UTF-8/strict to avoid encoding errors if it contains
    surrogate characters (bytes paths are decoded with the
    surrogateescape error handler). Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Fix overly-broad source position information for chained
    comparisons used as branching conditions.
  - At Python exit, sometimes a thread holding the GIL can
    wait forever for a thread (usually a daemon thread) which
    requested to drop the GIL, whereas the thread already
    exited. To fix the race condition, the thread which requested
    the GIL drop now resets its request before exiting. Issue
    discovered and analyzed by Mingliang ZHAO. Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - Fix a possible assertion failure, fatal error, or SystemError
    if a line tracing event raises an exception while opcode
    tracing is enabled.
  - Fix undefined behaviour in C code of null pointer arithmetic.
  - Make sure that all frame objects created are created from
    valid interpreter frames. Prevents the possibility of invalid
    frames in backtraces and signal handlers.
  - Disable incorrect pickling of the C implemented classmethod
    descriptors.
  - On WASI ENOTCAPABLE is now mapped to PermissionError. The
    errno modules exposes the new error number. getpath.py now
    ignores PermissionError when it cannot open landmark files
    pybuilddir.txt and pyenv.cfg.
  - Allow pdb to locate source for frozen modules in the standard
    library.
  - Raise ValueError instead of SystemError when methods of
    uninitialized io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder objects are
    called. Patch by Oren Milman.
  - Fix a possible assertion failure in io.FileIO when the opener
    returns an invalid file descriptor.
  - Also escape s in the http.server
    BaseHTTPRequestHandler.log_message so that it is technically
    possible to parse the line and reconstruct what the original
    data was. Without this a xHH is ambiguious as to if it is a
    hex replacement we put in or the characters r”x” came through
    in the original request line.
  - asyncio.get_event_loop() now only emits a deprecation warning
    when a new event loop was created implicitly. It no longer
    emits a deprecation warning if the current event loop was
    set.
  - Fix bug when calling trace.CoverageResults with valid infile.
  - Fix a bug in handling class cleanups in
    unittest.TestCase. Now addClassCleanup() uses separate lists
    for different TestCase subclasses, and doClassCleanups() only
    cleans up the particular class.
  - Release the GIL when calling termios APIs to avoid blocking
    threads.
  - Fix ast.increment_lineno() to also cover ast.TypeIgnore when
    changing line numbers.
  - Fix bug in urllib.parse.urlparse() that causes URL schemes
    that begin with a digit, a plus sign, or a minus sign to be
    parsed incorrectly.
  - Check the number of arguments in substitution in user
    generics containing a TypeVarTuple and one or more TypeVar.
  - Fix substitution of ParamSpec followed by TypeVarTuple in
    generic aliases.
  - Fix substitution of TypeVarTuple and ParamSpec together in
    user generics.
  - Fixed bug where inspect.signature() reported incorrect
    arguments for decorated methods.
  - Fix SystemError in ctypes when exception was not set during
    __initsubclass__.
  - Remove older version of
    _SSLProtocolTransport.get_write_buffer_limits in
    asyncio.sslproto
  - fix negative numbers failing in verify()
  - Fix statistics.NormalDist pickle with 0 and 1 protocols.
  - enum.auto() is now correctly activated when combined with
    other assignment values. E.g. ONE = auto(), 'some text' will
    now evaluate as (1, 'some text').
  - Update the bundled copy of pip to version 22.3.1.
  - Clean up refleak on failed module initialisation in _zoneinfo
  - Clean up refleaks on failed module initialisation in in
    _pickle
  - Clean up refleak on failed module initialisation in _io.
  - Fix memory leak in math.dist() when both points don’t have
    the same dimension. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - [3.11] Applied changes from importlib_metadata 4.11.4
    through 4.13, including compatibility and robustness
    fixes for Distribution objects without _normalized_name,
    disallowing invalid inputs to Distribution.from_name, and
    refined behaviors in PathDistribution._name_from_stem and
    PathDistribution._normalized_name.
  - Fix argument typechecks in _overlapped.WSAConnect() and
    _overlapped.Overlapped.WSASendTo() functions.
  - Prevent crashing in traceback when retrieving the byte-offset
    for some source files that contain certain unicode
    characters.
  - Fix internal error in the re module which in very rare
    circumstances prevented compilation of a regular expression
    containing a conditional expression without the “else”
    branch.
  - Fix asyncio.StreamWriter.drain() to call
    protocol.connection_lost callback only once on Windows.
  - Add a mutex to unittest.mock.NonCallableMock to protect
    concurrent access to mock attributes.
  - Fix hang on Windows in subprocess.wait_closed() in asyncio
    with ProactorEventLoop. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix infinite loop in unittest when a self-referencing chained
    exception is raised
  - tkinter.Text.count() raises now an exception for options
    starting with “-” instead of silently ignoring them.
  - On uname_result, restored expectation that _fields and
    _asdict would include all six properties including processor.
  - A createSocket() method was added to SysLogHandler.
  - Fix bug in urllib.parse.urlparse() that causes certain port
    numbers containing whitespace, underscores, plus and minus
    signs, or non-ASCII digits to be incorrectly accepted.
  - Allow venv to pass along PYTHON* variables to ensurepip and
    pip when they do not impact path resolution
  - On macOS, fix a crash in syslog.syslog() in multi-threaded
    applications. On macOS, the libc syslog() function is not
    thread-safe, so syslog.syslog() no longer releases the GIL to
    call it. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Allow BUILTINS to be a valid field name for frozen
    dataclasses.
  - Wrap network errors consistently in urllib FTP support, so
    the test suite doesn’t fail when a network is available but
    the public internet is not reachable.
  - Make sure patch.dict() can be applied on async functions.
  - Earlier in 3.11 we deprecated
    asyncio.Task.cancel("message"). We realized we were too
    harsh, and have undeprecated it.
  - Change deprecate warning message in unittest from It is
    deprecated to return a value!=None to It is deprecated to
    return a value that is not None from a test case
  - Fixes AttributeError when subprocess.check_output() is used
    with argument input=None and either of the arguments encoding
    or errors are used.
  - Fix is_private properties in the ipaddress module. Previously
    non-private networks (0.0.0.0/0) would return True from this
    method; now they correctly return False.
  - Avoid spurious tracebacks from asyncio when default executor
    cleanup is delayed until after the event loop is closed (e.g.
    as the result of a keyboard interrupt).
  - Avoid a crash in the C version of
    asyncio.Future.remove_done_callback() when an evil argument
    is passed.
  - Remove tokenize.NL check from tabnanny.
  - Fix generation of the default name of
    tkinter.Checkbutton. Previously, checkbuttons in different
    parent widgets could have the same short name and share
    the same state if arguments “name” and “variable” are not
    specified. Now they are globally unique.
  - Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.9
  - Fix race condition in asyncio where process_exited() called
    before the pipe_data_received() leading to inconsistent
    output. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fixed check in multiprocessing.resource_tracker that
    guarantees that the length of a write to a pipe is not
    greater than PIPE_BUF.
  - Corrected type annotation for dataclass attribute
    pstats.FunctionProfile.ncalls to be str.
  - Fix repr of Any subclasses.
  - Work around missing socket functions in socket’s __repr__.
  - In inspect, fix overeager replacement of “typing.” in
    formatting annotations.
  - Fix handling of bytes path-like objects in os.ismount().
  - Fix handling compiler warnings (SyntaxWarning and
    DeprecationWarning) in codeop.compile_command() when checking
    for incomplete input. Previously it emitted warnings and
    raised a SyntaxError. Now it always returns None for
    incomplete input without emitting any warnings.
  - To avoid apparent memory leaks when asyncio.open_connection()
    raises, break reference cycles generated by local exception
    and future instances (which has exception instance as its
    member var). Patch by Dong Uk, Kang.
  - Fixed flickering of the turtle window when the tracer is
    turned off. Patch by Shin-myoung-serp.
  - Fix asyncio subprocess transport to kill process cleanly
    when process is blocked and avoid RuntimeError when loop is
    closed. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Prevent error when activating venv in nested fish instances.
  - TarFile.next() now returns None when called on an empty
    tarfile.
  - Document the optional callback parameter of WeakMethod. Patch
    by Géry Ogam.
  - Restrict use of sockets instead of pipes for stdin of
    subprocesses created by asyncio to AIX platform only.
  - shutil.copytree() now applies the ignore_dangling_symlinks
    argument recursively.
  - Fix IndexError in argparse.ArgumentParser when a store_true
    action is given an explicit argument.
  - Document that calling variadic functions with ctypes requires
    special care on macOS/arm64 (and possibly other platforms).
  - Remove extra row
  - Clarified the conflicting advice given in the ast
    documentation about ast.literal_eval() being “safe” for use
    on untrusted input while at the same time warning that it
    can crash the process. The latter statement is true and is
    deemed unfixable without a large amount of work unsuitable
    for a bugfix. So we keep the warning and no longer claim that
    literal_eval is safe.
  - Restructured the documentation for the os.wait* family of
    functions, and improved the docs for os.waitid() with more
    explanation of the possible argument constants.
  - Skip test_normalization() of test_unicodedata if it
    fails to download NormalizationTest.txt file from
    pythontest.net. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Correct test_marsh on (32 bit) x86: test_deterministic sets
    was failing.
  - Optional big memory tests in test_sqlite3 now catch the
    correct sqlite.DataError exception type in case of too large
    strings and/or blobs passed.
  - Fix a bug in the typing tests where a test relying
    on CPython-specific implementation details was not
    decorated with @cpython_only and was not skipped on other
    implementations.
  - Add tests for star-unpacking with PEP 646, and some other
    miscellaneous PEP 646 tests.
  - Added explicit coverage of Py_Initialize (and hence
    Py_InitializeEx) back to the embedding tests (all other
    embedding tests migrated to Py_InitializeFromConfig in Python
    3.11)
  - Some C API tests were moved into the new Lib/test/test_capi/
    directory.
  - Fix -Wimplicit-int, -Wstrict-prototypes, and
    -Wimplicit-function-declaration compiler warnings in
    configure checks.
  - Fix a compilation issue with GCC 12 on macOS.
  - Fix -Wimplicit-int compiler warning in configure check for
    PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM.
  - Fix a possible fd leak in Programs/_freeze_module.c
    introduced in Python 3.11.
  - Fix build with PYTHON_FOR_REGEN=python3.8.
  - Specify the full path to the source location for make
    docclean (needed for cross-builds).
  - Don’t use vendored libmpdec headers if --with-system-libmpdec
    is passed to configure. Don’t use vendored libexpat headers
    if --with-system-expat is passed to !configure.
  - Fix the build process of clang compiler for _bootstrap_python
    if LTO optimization is applied. Patch by Matthias Görgens and
    Dong-hee Na.
  - wasm32-emscripten builds for browsers now include
    concurrent.futures for asyncio and unittest.mock.
  - wasm32-emscripten platform no longer builds resource module,
    getresuid(), getresgid(), and their setters. The APIs are
    stubs and not functional.
  - Updated pegen regeneration script on Windows to find and
    use Python 3.9 or higher. Prior to this, pegen regeneration
    already required 3.9 or higher, but the script may have used
    lower versions of Python.
  - Fix a bug in the previous bugfix that caused IDLE to
    not start when run with 3.10.8, 3.12.0a1, and at least
    Microsoft Python 3.10.2288.0 installed without the Lib/test
    package. 3.11.0 was never affected.
  - The wasm_build.py script now pre-builds Emscripten ports,
    checks for broken EMSDK versions, and warns about pkg-config
    env vars.
  - The new tool Tools/wasm/wasm_builder.py automates configure,
    compile, and test steps for building CPython on WebAssembly
    platforms.
  - Fix handling of module docstrings in Tools/i18n/pygettext.py.
  - PyBUF_* constants were marked as part of Limited API
    of Python 3.11+. These were available in 3.11.0 with
    Py_LIMITED_API defined for 3.11, and are necessary to use the
    buffer API.
  - Fix use-after-free in Py_SetPythonHome(NULL),
    Py_SetProgramName(NULL) and _Py_SetProgramFullPath(NULL)
    function calls. Issue reported by Benedikt Reinartz. Patch by
    Victor Stinner.
  - Py_InitializeEx now correctly calls PyConfig_Clear after
    initializing the interpreter (the omission didn’t cause a
    memory leak only because none of the dynamically allocated
    config fields are populated by the wrapper function)
- Removed upstreamed patches:
  - 98437-sphinx.locale._-as-gettext-in-pyspecific.patch
  - CVE-2022-45061-DoS-by-IDNA-decode.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  9 18:31:23 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add CVE-2022-45061-DoS-by-IDNA-decode.patch to avoid
  CVE-2022-45061 (bsc#1205244) allowing DoS by IDNA decoding
  extremely long domain names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 25 08:39:47 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0 (overall changes from 3.10.*):
  - General changes
    - PEP 657 -- Include Fine-Grained Error Locations in
      Tracebacks
    - PEP 654 -- Exception Groups and except*
    - PEP 680 -- tomllib: Support for Parsing TOML in the
      Standard Library
    - gh-90908 -- Introduce task groups to asyncio
    - gh-34627 -- Atomic grouping ((?>...)) and possessive
      quantifiers (*+, ++, ?+, {m,n}+) are now supported in
      regular expressions.
    - The Faster CPython Project is already yielding some
      exciting results. Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than
      Python 3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the
      standard benchmark suite. See Faster CPython for details.
  - Typing and typing language changes
    - PEP 673 -- Self Type
    - PEP 646 -- Variadic Generics
    - PEP 675 -- Arbitrary Literal String Type
    - PEP 655 -- Marking individual TypedDict items as required
      or potentially-missing
    - PEP 681 -- Data Class Transforms
- (just changes from 3.11.0rc2):
  - Fix multiplying a list by an integer (list *= int): detect
    the integer overflow when the new allocated length is close
    to the maximum size. Issue reported by Jordan Limor. Patch by
    Victor Stinner.
  - On Linux the multiprocessing module returns to using
    filesystem backed unix domain sockets for communication
    with the forkserver process instead of the Linux abstract
    socket namespace. Only code that chooses to use the
    “forkserver” start method is affected. Abstract sockets have
    no permissions and could allow any user on the system in the
    same network namespace (often the whole system) to inject
    code into the multiprocessing forkserver process. This was
    a potential privilege escalation. Filesystem based socket
    permissions restrict this to the forkserver process user as
    was the default in Python 3.8 and earlier. This prevents
    Linux CVE-2022-42919.
  - Fix an issue where several frame objects could be backed by
    the same interpreter frame, possibly leading to corrupted
    memory and hard crashes of the interpreter.
  - Fix possible data corruption or crashes when accessing the
    f_back member of newly-created generator or coroutine frames.
  - Fix a crash occurring when PyEval_GetFrame() is called while
    the topmost Python frame is in a partially-initialized state.
  - Fix command line parsing: reject -X int_max_str_digits option
    with no value (invalid) when the PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS
    environment variable is set to a valid limit. Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - Fix undefined behaviour in _testcapimodule.c.
  - When ValueError is raised if an integer is larger than the
    limit, mention the sys.set_int_max_str_digits() function in
    the error message. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Correctly raise SyntaxError on exception groups (PEP 654) on
    python versions prior to 3.11
  - Document some places where an assignment expression needs
    parentheses.
  - Update the bundled copies of pip and setuptools to versions
    22.3 and 65.5.0 respectively.
  - fix Flag to use boundary CONFORM
  - This restores previous Flag behavior of allowing flags with
    non-sequential values to be combined; e.g.
  - class Skip(Flag): TWO = 2 EIGHT = 8
  - Skip.TWO | Skip.EIGHT -> <Skip.TWO|EIGHT: 10>
  - Fix ! in c domain ref target syntax via a conf.py patch, so
    it works as intended to disable ref target resolution.
  - Update tutorial introduction output to use 3.10+ SyntaxError
    invalid range.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 21 10:14:03 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add 98437-sphinx.locale._-as-gettext-in-pyspecific.patch to
  allow building of documentation with the latest Sphinx 5.3.0
  (gh#python/cpython#98366).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 08:43:07 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0rc2:
  - Converting between int and str in bases other than 2
    (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base
    10 (decimal) now raises a ValueError if the number of digits
    in string form is above a limit to avoid potential denial of
    service attacks due to the algorithmic complexity. This is
    a mitigation for CVE-2020-10735.
    This new limit can be configured or disabled by environment
    variable, command line flag, or sys APIs. See the integer
    string conversion length limitation documentation. The
    default limit is 4300 digits in string form.
  - Fix case of undefined behavior in ceval.c
  - Do not expose KeyWrapper in _functools.
  - Ensure that tracing, sys.setrace(), is turned on
    immediately. In pre-release versions of 3.11, some tracing
    events might have been lost when turning on tracing in a
    __del__ method or interrupt.
  - Fix use after free in trace refs build mode. Patch by Kumar
    Aditya.
  - When loading a file with invalid UTF-8 inside a multi-line
    string, a correct SyntaxError is emitted.
  - Make sure that incomplete frames do not show up in
    tracemalloc traces.
  - Remove two cases of undefined behavior, by adding NULL
    checks.
  - Fix possible NULL pointer dereference in
    _PyThread_CurrentFrames. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix AttributeError missing name and obj attributes in
    object.__getattribute__(). Patch by Philip Georgi.
  - Loading a file with invalid UTF-8 will now report the broken
    character at the correct location.
  - Fixed a bug that caused _PyCode_GetExtra to return garbage
    for negative indexes. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Fix a deadlock in PyGILState_Ensure() when allocating new
    thread state. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - PyType_Ready() now initializes ht_cached_keys and performs
    additional checks to ensure that type objects are properly
    configured. This avoids crashes in 3rd party packages that
    don’t use regular API to create new types.
  - Skip over incomplete frames in PyThreadState_GetFrame().
  - Fix format string in _PyPegen_raise_error_known_location that
    can lead to memory corruption on some 64bit systems. The
    function was building a tuple with i (int) instead of n
    (Py_ssize_t) for Py_ssize_t arguments.
  - Fix misleading contents of error message when converting an
    all-whitespace string to float.
  - ast.parse() will no longer parse function definitions with
    positional-only params when passed feature_version less than
    (3, 8). Patch by Shantanu Jain.
  - Fix incorrect error message in the io module.
  - Fix the faulthandler implementation of
    faulthandler.register(signal, chain=True) if the sigaction()
    function is not available: don’t call the previous signal
    handler if it’s NULL. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Correct conversion of numbers.Rational’s to float.
  - Fix TypeVarTuple.__typing_prepare_subst__. TypeError was not
    raised when using more than one TypeVarTuple, like [*T, *V]
    in type alias substitutions.
  - Fix asyncio.streams.StreamReaderProtocol to keep a strong
    reference to the created task, so that it’s not garbage
    collected
  - Fix a performance regression in logging
    TimedRotatingFileHandler. Only check for special files when
    the rollover time has passed.
  - Fix unused localName parameter in the Attr class in
    xml.dom.minidom.
  - Fix incorrect condition that causes sys.thread_info.name to
    be wrong on pthread platforms.
  - Remove an incompatible change from bpo-28080 that caused a
    regression that ignored the utf8 in ZipInfo.flag_bits. Patch
    by Pablo Galindo.
  - Fix asyncio.Runner to call asyncio.set_event_loop() only
    once to avoid calling attach_loop() multiple times on child
    watchers. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase to set event loop before
    calling setup functions. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - When a task catches asyncio.CancelledError and raises some
    other error, the other error should generally not silently be
    suppressed.
  - Fail gracefully if EPERM or ENOSYS is raised when loading
    crypt methods. This may happen when trying to load MD5 on a
    Linux kernel with FIPS enabled.
  - Allow asyncio.StreamWriter.drain() to be awaited concurrently
    by multiple tasks. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix ast.unparse() when ImportFrom.level is None
  - Improve discoverability of the higher level
    concurrent.futures module by providing clearer links from the
    lower level threading and multiprocessing modules.
  - What’s New 3.11 now has instructions for how to provide
    compiler and linker flags for Tcl/Tk and OpenSSL on RHEL 7
    and CentOS 7.
  - Mitigate the inherent race condition from using
    find_unused_port() in testSockName() by trying to find an
    unused port a few times before failing. Patch by Ross Burton.
  - Build and test with OpenSSL 1.1.1q
- Use support-expat-CVE-2022-25236-patched.patch from the current
  version of gh#python/cpython#93900 instead of the old
  support-expat-245.patch.
- Reapply fix_configure_rst.patch.

Mon Sep  5 08:43:49 UTC 2022 - Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

- Increase testsuite timeout for test_freeze_simple_script

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 21:31:40 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- fix import_failed.map to refer to the python 3.11 package versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 14:05:21 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0rc1:
  - Core and Builtins
    - Update code object hashing and equality to consider all
      debugging and exception handling tables. This fixes an
      issue where certain non-identical code objects could be
      “deduplicated” during compilation.
    - _PyPegen_Parser_New now properly detects token memory
      allocation errors. Patch by Honglin Zhu.
    - Run Python code in tracer/profiler function at full
      speed. Fixes slowdown in earlier versions of 3.11.
    - Emit a warning in debug mode if an object does not call
      PyObject_GC_UnTrack() before deallocation. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo.
    - Prevented crashes in the AST constructor when
      compiling some absurdly long expressions like
      "+0"*1000000. RecursionError is now raised instead. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - ast.AST node positions are now validated when provided to
      compile() and other related functions. If invalid positions
      are detected, a ValueError will be raised.
    - Fix error detection in some builtin functions when keyword
      argument name is an instance of a str subclass with
      overloaded __eq__ and __hash__. Previously it could cause
      SystemError or other undesired behavior.
  - Library
    - Update bundled pip to 22.2.2.
    - Fix asyncio.TaskGroup to propagate exception when
      asyncio.CancelledError was replaced with another exception
      by a context manger. Patch by Kumar Aditya and Guido van
      Rossum.
    - Update bundled pip to 22.2.1.
    - Fix GC crash when deallocating _lsprof.Profiler by
      untracking it before calling any callbacks. Patch by Kumar
      Aditya.
    - Fix asyncio.run() for asyncio.Task implementations without
      uncancel() method. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - Fix check for existence of os.EFD_CLOEXEC, os.EFD_NONBLOCK
      and os.EFD_SEMAPHORE flags on older kernel versions where
      these flags are not present. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - Fix concurrent.futures.Executor.map() to cancel the
      currently waiting on future on an error - e.g. TimeoutError
      or KeyboardInterrupt.
    - Ensure that timeouts scheduled with asyncio.Timeout that
      have already expired are delivered promptly.
    - Suppress writing an XML declaration in open files
      in ElementTree.write() with encoding='unicode' and
      xml_declaration=None.
    - Fix findtext in the xml module to only give an empty string
      when the text attribute is set to None.
  - Documentation
    - Fix stylesheet not working in Windows CHM htmlhelp docs
      and add warning that they are deprecated. Contributed by
      C.A.M. Gerlach.
    - Update library documentation with availability information
      on WebAssembly platforms wasm32-emscripten and wasm32-wasi.
    - Use consistent syntax for platform availability. The
      directive now supports a content body and emits a warning
      when it encounters an unknown platform.
    - Document a limitation in ThreadPoolExecutor where its exit
      handler is executed before any handlers in atexit.
  - Tests
    - Lib/test/test_asyncio/test_ssl.py exposed a bug in the
      macOS kernel where intense concurrent load on non-blocking
      sockets occasionally causes errno.ENOBUFS (“No buffer space
      available”) to be emitted. FB11063974 filed with Apple, in
      the mean time as a workaround buffer size used in tests on
      macOS is decreased to avoid intermittent failures. Patch by
      Fantix King.
    - Fix problem with test_ssl test_get_ciphers on systems that
      require perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers.
    - Add a regression test for re exponentional slowdown when
      using rjsmin.
  - Build
    - Fix a regression in configure script that caused some
      header checks to ignore custom CPPFLAGS. The regression was
      introduced in gh-94802.
    - wasm32-wasi builds no longer depend on WASIX’s pthread
      stubs. Python now has its own stubbed pthread API.
    - Python now detects missing dup function in WASI and works
      around some missing errno, select, and socket constants.
    - Python now skips missing socket functions and methods on
      WASI. WASI can only create sockets from existing fd /
      accept and has no netdb.
    - Platforms wasm32-unknown-emscripten and wasm32-unknown-wasi
      have been promoted to PEP 11 tier 3 platform support.
  - IDLE
    - Document handling of extensions in Save As dialogs.
    - Include prompts when saving Shell (interactive input and
      output).
    - Fix the Shell context menu copy-with-prompts bug of copying
      an extra line when one selects whole lines.
    - In the Edit menu, move Select All and add a new separator.
    - Enable using IDLE’s module browser with .pyw files.
    - Add .pyi as a recognized extension for IDLE on macOS. This
      allows opening stub files by double clicking on them in the
      Finder.
  - C API
    - Restore the 3.10 behavior for multiple inheritance of C
      extension classes that store their dictionary at the end of
      the struct.
    - Added PyCode_GetVarnames(), PyCode_GetCellvars() and
      PyCode_GetFreevars() for accessing co_varnames, co_cellvars
      and co_freevars respectively via the C API.

- Update to 3.11.0b5:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-93351: ast.AST node positions are now validated when
      provided to compile() and other related functions. If
      invalid positions are detected, a ValueError will be
      raised.
    - gh-94438: Fix an issue that caused extended opcode
      arguments and some conditional pops to be ignored when
      calculating valid jump targets for assignments to the

      descriptors may be ignored when an identically-named
      attribute also exists on the class itself.
    - gh-91153: Fix an issue where a bytearray item assignment
      could crash if it’s resized by the new value’s __index__()

      factory. The regression was introduced in 3.11a1 with PR
      24421 (gh-85128). Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.`
    - gh-93157: Fix fileinput module didn’t support errors option
      when inplace is true.
    - gh-95105: wsgiref.types.InputStream.__iter__() should
      return Iterator[bytes], not Iterable[bytes]. Patch by
      Shantanu Jain.
    - gh-94857: Fix refleak in
      _io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - gh-94821: Fix binding of unix socket to empty address

      frozensets that contain incompatible, unsortable types.
  - C API
    - gh-94930: Fix SystemError raised when
      PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords() is used with # in (...) but
      without PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN defined.
    - gh-94864: Fix PyArg_Parse* with deprecated format units “u”
      and “Z”. It returned 1 (success) when warnings are turned
      into exceptions.
    - gh-94731: Python again uses C-style casts for
      most casting operations when compiled with
      C++. This may trigger compiler warnings, if they
      are enabled with e.g. -Wold-style-cast `` or
      ``-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant options for g++.

Thu Jul 14 15:37:35 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0b4:
- Fixes many bugs and adds following more significant changes
- Security
  - gh-68966: The deprecated mailcap module now refuses to inject
    Coreunsafe text (filenames, MIME types, parameters) into
    shell Corecommands. Instead of using such text, it will
    warn and act Coreas if a match was not found (or for test
    commands, as if the Coretest failed). and Builtins
  - gh-93516: Lazily create a table mapping bytecode offsets to
    line numbers to speed up calculation of line numbers when
    tracing.
  - gh-93461: importlib.invalidate_caches() now drops entries
    from sys.path_importer_cache with a relative path as
    name. This solves a caching issue when a process changes its
    current working directory.
  - FileFinder no longer inserts a dot in the path, e.g.
    /egg/./spam is now /egg/spam.
Library
  - gh-93896: Fix asyncio.run() and
    unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase to always the set event loop
    as it was done in Python 3.10 and earlier. Patch by Kumar
    Aditya.
  - gh-94101: Manual instantiation of ssl.SSLSession objects is
    no longer allowed as it lead to misconfigured instances that
    crashed the interpreter when attributes where accessed on
    them.
  - gh-83658: Make multiprocessing.Pool raise an exception if
    maxtasksperchild is not None or a positive int.
  - gh-61162: Clarify sqlite3 behavior when Using the connection
    as a context manager.
Tools/Demos
  - gh-94538: Fix Argument Clinic output to custom file
    destinations. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
C API
  - gh-93937: The following frame functions and type are now
    directly available with #include <Python.h>, it’s no longer
    needed to add #include <frameobject.h>:
        PyFrame_Check()
        PyFrame_GetBack()
        PyFrame_GetBuiltins()
        PyFrame_GetGenerator()
        PyFrame_GetGlobals()
        PyFrame_GetLasti()
        PyFrame_GetLocals()
        PyFrame_Type

  - The Faster Cpython Project is already yielding some exciting
    results. Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python
    3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the standard
    benchmark suite. See
    https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython

    re-entering.
  - bpo-42369: Fix thread safety of zipfile._SharedFile.tell() to
    avoid a “zipfile.BadZipFile: Bad CRC-32 for file” exception
    when reading a ZipFile from multiple threads.
  - bpo-38256: Fix binascii.crc32() when it is compiled to use
    zlib’c crc32 to work properly on inputs 4+GiB in length
    instead of returning the wrong result. The workaround prior
    to this was to always feed the function data in increments
    smaller than 4GiB or to just call the zlib module function.
  - bpo-39394: A warning about inline flags not at the start of
    the regular expression now contains the position of the flag.
  - bpo-47061: Deprecate the various modules listed by PEP 594:
  - aifc, asynchat, asyncore, audioop, cgi, cgitb, chunk, crypt,
    imghdr, msilib, nntplib, nis, ossaudiodev, pipes, smtpd,
    sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib
  - bpo-2604: Fix bug where doctests using globals would fail
    when run multiple times.
  - bpo-45997: Fix asyncio.Semaphore re-aquiring FIFO order.
  - bpo-47022: The asynchat, asyncore and smtpd modules have been
    deprecated since at least Python 3.6. Their documentation and
    deprecation warnings and have now been updated to note they
    will removed in Python 3.12 (PEP 594).
  - bpo-46421: Fix a unittest issue where if the command was
    invoked as python -m unittest and the filename(s) began with
    a dot (.), a ValueError is returned.
  - bpo-40296: Fix supporting generic aliases in pydoc.

- Update to 3.10.3:
  - bpo-46940: Avoid overriding AttributeError metadata
    information for nested attribute access calls. Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - bpo-46852: Rename the private undocumented
    float.__set_format__() method to float.__setformat__() to fix
    a typo introduced in Python 3.7. The method is only used by
    test_float. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46794: Bump up the libexpat version into 2.4.6
  - bpo-46820: Fix parsing a numeric literal immediately (without
    spaces) followed by “not in” keywords, like in 1not in x. Now
    the parser only emits a warning, not a syntax error.
  - bpo-46762: Fix an assert failure in debug builds when a ‘<’,
    ‘>’, or ‘=’ is the last character in an f-string that’s
    missing a closing right brace.
  - bpo-46724: Make sure that all backwards jumps use the
    JUMP_ABSOLUTE instruction, rather than JUMP_FORWARD with an
    argument of (2**32)+offset.
  - bpo-46732: Correct the docstring for the __bool__() method.
    Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  - bpo-46707: Avoid potential exponential backtracking when
    producing some syntax errors involving lots of brackets.
    Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo-40479: Add a missing call to va_end() in
    Modules/_hashopenssl.c.
  - bpo-46615: When iterating over sets internally in
    setobject.c, acquire strong references to the resulting items
    from the set. This prevents crashes in corner-cases of
    various set operations where the set gets mutated.
  - bpo-45773: Remove two invalid “peephole” optimizations from
    the bytecode compiler.
  - bpo-43721: Fix docstrings of getter, setter, and deleter to
    clarify that they create a new copy of the property.
  - bpo-46503: Fix an assert when parsing some invalid N escape
    sequences in f-strings.
  - bpo-46417: Fix a race condition on setting a type __bases__
    attribute: the internal function add_subclass() now gets the
    PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses member after calling
    PyWeakref_NewRef() which can trigger a garbage collection
    which can indirectly modify PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses. Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46383: Fix invalid signature of _zoneinfo’s module_free
    function to resolve a crash on wasm32-emscripten platform.
  - bpo-46070: Py_EndInterpreter() now explicitly untracks all
    objects currently tracked by the GC. Previously, if an object
    was used later by another interpreter, calling
    PyObject_GC_UnTrack() on the object crashed if the previous
    or the next object of the PyGC_Head structure became
    a dangling pointer. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46339: Fix a crash in the parser when retrieving the
    error text for multi-line f-strings expressions that do not
    start in the first line of the string. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-46240: Correct the error message for unclosed parentheses
    when the tokenizer doesn’t reach the end of the source when
    the error is reported. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-46091: Correctly calculate indentation levels for lines
    with whitespace character that are ended by line continuation
    characters. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-43253: Fix a crash when closing transports where the
    underlying socket handle is already invalid on the Proactor
    event loop.
  - bpo-47004: Apply bugfixes from importlib_metadata 4.11.3,
    including bugfix for EntryPoint.extras, which was returning
    match objects and not the extras strings.
  - bpo-46985: Upgrade pip wheel bundled with ensurepip (pip
    22.0.4)
  - bpo-46968: faulthandler: On Linux 5.14 and newer, dynamically
    determine size of signal handler stack size CPython allocates
    using getauxval(AT_MINSIGSTKSZ). This changes allows for
    Python extension’s request to Linux kernel to use AMX_TILE
    instruction set on Sapphire Rapids Xeon processor to succeed,
    unblocking use of the ISA in frameworks.
  - bpo-46955: Expose asyncio.base_events.Server as
    asyncio.Server. Patch by Stefan Zabka.
  - bpo-23325: The signal module no longer assumes that SIG_IGN
    and SIG_DFL are small int singletons.
  - bpo-46932: Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.7
  - bpo-25707: Fixed a file leak in
    xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse() when the iterator is not
    exhausted. Patch by Jacob Walls.

    dynamically loaded or statically linked libexpat in embedded
    Python.
  - bpo-39327: shutil.rmtree() can now work with VirtualBox
    shared folders when running from the guest operating-system.
  - bpo-46756: Fix a bug in
    urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgr.find_user_password() and
    urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuth.is_authenticated()
    which allowed to bypass authorization. For example, access to
    URI example.org/foobar was allowed if the user was authorized
    for URI example.org/foo.
  - bpo-46643: In typing.get_type_hints(), support evaluating
    stringified ParamSpecArgs and ParamSpecKwargs annotations.
    Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-45863: When the tarfile module creates a pax format
    archive, it will put an integer representation of timestamps
    in the ustar header (if possible) for the benefit of older
    unarchivers, in addition to the existing full-precision
    timestamps in the pax extended header.
  - bpo-46676: Make typing.ParamSpec args and kwargs equal to
    themselves. Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-46672: Fix NameError in asyncio.gather() when initial

    bare stringified TypeAlias annotations. Patch by Gregory
    Beauregard.
  - bpo-45948: Fixed a discrepancy in the C implementation of the
    xml.etree.ElementTree module. Now, instantiating an
    xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser with a target=None keyword
    provides a default xml.etree.ElementTree.TreeBuilder target
    as the Python implementation does.
  - bpo-46521: Fix a bug in the codeop module that was
    incorrectly identifying invalid code involving string quotes
    as valid code.
  - bpo-46581: Brings ParamSpec propagation for GenericAlias in
    line with Concatenate (and others).
  - bpo-46591: Make the IDLE doc URL on the About IDLE dialog
    clickable.
  - bpo-46400: expat: Update libexpat from 2.4.1 to 2.4.4

  - bpo-46436: Fix command-line option -d/--directory in module
    http.server which is ignored when combined with command-line
    option --cgi. Patch by Géry Ogam.
  - bpo-41403: Make mock.patch() raise a TypeError with
    a relevant error message on invalid arg. Previously it
    allowed a cryptic AttributeError to escape.
  - bpo-46474: In importlib.metadata.EntryPoint.pattern, avoid
    potential REDoS by limiting ambiguity in consecutive
    whitespace.
  - bpo-46469: asyncio generic classes now return
    types.GenericAlias in __class_getitem__ instead of the same
    class.
  - bpo-46434: pdb now gracefully handles help when __doc__ is
    missing, for example when run with pregenerated optimized
    .pyc files.
  - bpo-46333: The __eq__() and __hash__() methods of
    typing.ForwardRef now honor the module parameter of
    typing.ForwardRef. Forward references from different modules
    are now differentiated.
  - bpo-46246: Add missing __slots__ to
    importlib.metadata.DeprecatedList. Patch by Arie Bovenberg.
  - bpo-46266: Improve day constants in calendar.
  - Now all constants (MONDAY … SUNDAY) are documented, tested,
    and added to __all__.
  - bpo-46232: The ssl module now handles certificates with bit
    strings in DN correctly.
  - bpo-43118: Fix a bug in inspect.signature() that was causing
    it to fail on some subclasses of classes with
    a __text_signature__ referencing module globals. Patch by
    Weipeng Hong.
  - bpo-26552: Fixed case where failing asyncio.ensure_future()
    did not close the coroutine. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - bpo-21987: Fix an issue with tarfile.TarFile.getmember()
    getting a directory name with a trailing slash.
  - bpo-20392: Fix inconsistency with uppercase file extensions
    in MimeTypes.guess_type(). Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - bpo-46080: Fix exception in argparse help text generation if
    a argparse.BooleanOptionalAction argument’s default is
    argparse.SUPPRESS and it has help specified. Patch by Felix
    Fontein.
  - bpo-44439: Fix .write() method of a member file in ZipFile,
    when the input data is an object that supports the buffer
    protocol, the file length may be wrong.
  - bpo-45703: When a namespace package is imported before
    another module from the same namespace is created/installed
    in a different sys.path location while the program is
    running, calling the importlib.invalidate_caches() function
    will now also guarantee the new module is noticed.
  - bpo-24959: Fix bug where unittest sometimes drops frames from
    tracebacks of exceptions raised in tests.
  - bpo-44791: Fix substitution of ParamSpec in Concatenate with
    different parameter expressions. Substitution with a list of
    types returns now a tuple of types. Substitution with
    Concatenate returns now a Concatenate with concatenated lists
    of arguments.
  - bpo-14156: argparse.FileType now supports an argument of ‘-’
    in binary mode, returning the .buffer attribute of
    sys.stdin/sys.stdout as appropriate. Modes including ‘x’ and
    ‘a’ are treated equivalently to ‘w’ when argument is ‘-’.
    Patch contributed by Josh Rosenberg
  - bpo-46463: Fixes escape4chm.py script used when building the
    CHM documentation file
  - bpo-46913: Fix test_faulthandler.test_sigfpe() if Python is

    Stinner.
  - bpo-46708: Prevent default asyncio event loop policy
    modification warning after test_asyncio execution.
  - bpo-46678: The function make_legacy_pyc in
    Lib/test/support/import_helper.py no longer fails when
    PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX is set to a directory on a different
    device from where tempfiles are stored.
  - bpo-46616: Ensures test_importlib.test_windows cleans up
    registry keys after completion.
  - bpo-44359: test_ftplib now silently ignores socket errors to
    prevent logging unhandled threading exceptions. Patch by
    Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46542: Fix a Python crash in test_lib2to3 when using
    Python built in debug mode: limit the recursion limit. Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46576: test_peg_generator now disables compiler
    optimization when testing compilation of its own C extensions
    to significantly speed up the testing on non-debug builds of
    CPython.
  - bpo-46542: Fix test_json tests checking for RecursionError:
    modify these tests to use support.infinite_recursion(). Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-13886: Skip test_builtin PTY tests on non-ASCII
    characters if the readline module is loaded. The readline
    module changes input() behavior, but test_builtin is not
    intented to test the readline module. Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - bpo-38472: Fix GCC detection in setup.py when
    cross-compiling. The C compiler is now run with LC_ALL=C.
    Previously, the detection failed with a German locale.
  - bpo-46513: configure no longer uses AC_C_CHAR_UNSIGNED macro
    and pyconfig.h no longer defines reserved symbol
    __CHAR_UNSIGNED__.
  - bpo-45296: Clarify close, quit, and exit in IDLE. In the File
    menu, ‘Close’ and ‘Exit’ are now ‘Close Window’ (the current
    one) and ‘Exit’ is now ‘Exit IDLE’ (by closing all windows).
    In Shell, ‘quit()’ and ‘exit()’ mean ‘close Shell’. If there
    are no other windows, this also exits IDLE.
  - bpo-45447: Apply IDLE syntax highlighting to pyi files. Patch
    by Alex Waygood and Terry Jan Reedy.
  - bpo-46433: The internal function _PyType_GetModuleByDef now
    correctly handles inheritance patterns involving static
    types.
  - bpo-14916: Fixed bug in the tokenizer that prevented
    PyRun_InteractiveOne from parsing from the provided FD.

  has been moved there. rpm-build pulls rpm-build-python
  automatically in when building anything against python3-base, but
  this implies that the initial build of python3-base does not
  trigger the automatic installation.

- Update to 3.9.5:
  * Security
    - bpo-43434: Creating a sqlite3.Connection object now also
      produces a sqlite3.connect auditing event. Previously this
      event was only produced by sqlite3.connect() calls. Patch
      by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - bpo-43882: The presence of newline or tab characters in
      parts of a URL could allow some forms of attacks.
    - Following the controlling specification for URLs defined by
      WHATWG urllib.parse() now removes ASCII newlines and tabs
      from URLs, preventing such attacks.
    - bpo-43472: Ensures interpreter-level audit hooks receive
      the cpython.PyInterpreterState_New event when called
      through the _xxsubinterpreters module.
    - bpo-36384: ipaddress module no longer accepts any leading
      zeros in IPv4 address strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous
      and interpreted as octal notation by some libraries. For
      example the legacy function socket.inet_aton() treats
      leading zeros as octal notatation. glibc implementation of
      modern inet_pton() does not accept any leading zeros. For
      a while the ipaddress module used to accept ambiguous
      leading zeros.
    - bpo-43075: Fix Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
      vulnerability in urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler.
      The ReDoS-vulnerable regex has quadratic worst-case
      complexity and it allows cause a denial of service when
      identifying crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on
      the client side and needs remote attackers to control the
      HTTP server.
    - bpo-42800: Audit hooks are now fired for frame.f_code,
      traceback.tb_frame, and generator code/frame attribute
      access.
  * Core and Builtins
    - bpo-43105: Importlib now resolves relative paths when
      creating module spec objects from file locations.
    - bpo-42924: Fix bytearray repetition incorrectly copying
      data from the start of the buffer, even if the data is
      offset within the buffer (e.g. after reassigning a slice at
      the start of the bytearray to a shorter byte string).
  * Library
    - bpo-43993: Update bundled pip to 21.1.1.
    - bpo-43937: Fixed the turtle module working with non-default
      root window.
    - bpo-43930: Update bundled pip to 21.1 and setuptools to
      56.0.0
    - bpo-43920: OpenSSL 3.0.0: load_verify_locations() now
      returns a consistent error message when cadata contains no
      valid certificate.
    - bpo-43607: urllib can now convert Windows paths with \\?\
      prefixes into URL paths.
    - bpo-43284: platform.win32_ver derives the windows version
      from sys.getwindowsversion().platform_version which in turn
      derives the version from kernel32.dll (which can be of
      a different version than Windows itself). Therefore change
      the platform.win32_ver to determine the version using the
      platform module’s _syscmd_ver private function to return an
      accurate version.
    - bpo-42248: [Enum] ensure exceptions raised in _missing__
      are released
    - bpo-43799: OpenSSL 3.0.0: define OPENSSL_API_COMPAT 1.1.1
      to suppress deprecation warnings. Python requires OpenSSL
      1.1.1 APIs.
    - bpo-43794: Add ssl.OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF constants
      (OpenSSL 3.0.0)
    - bpo-43789: OpenSSL 3.0.0: Don’t call the password callback
      function a second time when first call has signaled an
      error condition.
    - bpo-43788: The header files for ssl error codes are now
      OpenSSL version-specific. Exceptions will now show correct
      reason and library codes. The make_ssl_data.py script has
      been rewritten to use OpenSSL’s text file with error codes.
    - bpo-43655: tkinter dialog windows are now recognized as
      dialogs by window managers on macOS and X Window.
    - bpo-43534: turtle.textinput() and turtle.numinput() create
      now a transient window working on behalf of the canvas
      window.
    - bpo-43522: Fix problem with hostname_checks_common_name.
      OpenSSL does not copy hostflags from struct SSL_CTX to
      struct SSL.
    - bpo-42967: Allow bytes separator argument in
      urllib.parse.parse_qs and urllib.parse.parse_qsl when
      parsing str query strings. Previously, this raised
      a TypeError.
    - bpo-43176: Fixed processing of a dataclass that inherits
      from a frozen dataclass with no fields. It is now correctly
      detected as an error.
    - bpo-41735: Fix thread locks in zlib module may go wrong in
      rare case. Patch by Ma Lin.
    - bpo-36470: Fix dataclasses with InitVars and replace().
      Patch by Claudiu Popa.
    - bpo-32745: Fix a regression in the handling of ctypes’
      ctypes.c_wchar_p type: embedded null characters would cause
      a ValueError to be raised. Patch by Zackery Spytz.
  * Documentation
    - bpo-43959: The documentation on the PyContextVar C-API was
      clarified.
    - bpo-43938: Update dataclasses documentation to express that
      FrozenInstanceError is derived from AttributeError.
    - bpo-43755: Update documentation to reflect that
      unparenthesized lambda expressions can no longer be the
      expression part in an if clause in comprehensions and
      generator expressions since Python 3.9.
    - bpo-43739: Fixing the example code in
      Doc/extending/extending.rst to declare and initialize the
      pmodule variable to be of the right type.
  * Tests
    - bpo-43961: Fix
      test_logging.test_namer_rotator_inheritance() on Windows:
      use os.replace() rather than os.rename(). Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - bpo-43842: Fix a race condition in the SMTP test of
      test_logging. Don’t close a file descriptor (socket) from
      a different thread while asyncore.loop() is polling the
      file descriptor. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - bpo-43811: Tests multiple OpenSSL versions on GitHub
      Actions. Use ccache to speed up testing.
    - bpo-43791: OpenSSL 3.0.0: Disable testing of legacy
      protocols TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Tests are failing with
      TLSV1_ALERT_INTERNAL_ERROR.
- Refreshed patches:
  - bpo-31046_ensurepip_honours_prefix.patch
  - python-3.3.0b1-fix_date_time_compiler.patch
- Add vendorized files from bluez-devel to enable building support for
  Bluetooth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  2 09:20:06 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Make sure to close the import_failed.map file after the exception
  has been raised in order to avoid ResourceWarnings when the
  failing import is part of a try...except block.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 28 16:39:54 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.4:
  - bpo#43710: Reverted the fix for https://bugs.python.org/issue42500
    as it changed the PyThreadState struct size and broke the 3.9.x ABI
    in the 3.9.3 release (visible on 32-bit platforms using binaries
    compiled using an earlier version of Python 3.9.x headers).
  - bpo#26053: Fixed bug where the pdb interactive run command echoed
    the args from the shell command line, even if those have been
    overridden at the pdb prompt.
  - bpo#42988 (bsc#1183374) CVE-2021-3426: Remove the getfile
    feature of the pydoc module which could be abused to read
    arbitrary files on the disk (directory traversal
    vulnerability). Moreover, even source code of Python modules
    can contain sensitive data like passwords. Vulnerability
    reported by David Schwörer.
  - bpo#43285: ftplib no longer trusts the IP address value
    returned from the server in response to the PASV command by
    default. This prevents a malicious FTP server from using the
    response to probe IPv4 address and port combinations on the
    client network. Code that requires the former vulnerable
    behavior may set a trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address attribute
    on their ftplib.FTP instances to True to re-enable it.
  - bpo#43439: Add audit hooks for gc.get_objects(),
    gc.get_referrers() and gc.get_referents(). Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - bpo#43660: Fix crash that happens when replacing sys.stderr
    with a callable that can remove the object while an exception
    is being printed. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo#43555: Report the column offset for SyntaxError for
    invalid line continuation characters. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo#43517: Fix misdetection of circular imports when using
    from pkg.mod import attr, which caused false positives in
    non-trivial multi-threaded code.
  - bpo#35883: Python no longer fails at startup with a fatal
    error if a command line argument contains an invalid Unicode
    character. The Py_DecodeLocale() function now escapes byte
    sequences which would be decoded as Unicode characters
    outside the [U+0000; U+10ffff] range.
  - bpo#43406: Fix a possible race condition where
    PyErr_CheckSignals tries to execute a non-Python signal
    handler.
  - bpo#42500: Improve handling of exceptions near recursion
    limit. Converts a number of Fatal Errors in RecursionErrors.
  - bpo#43433: xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy no longer ignores query
    and fragment in the URL of the server.
  - bpo#35930: Raising an exception raised in a “future” instance
    will create reference cycles.
  - bpo#43577: Fix deadlock when using ssl.SSLContext debug
    callback with ssl.SSLContext.sni_callback().
  - bpo#43521: ast.unparse can now render NaNs and empty sets.
  - bpo#43423: subprocess.communicate() no longer raises an
    IndexError when there is an empty stdout or stderr IO buffer
    during a timeout on Windows.
  - bpo#27820: Fixed long-standing bug of smtplib.SMTP where
    doing AUTH LOGIN with initial_response_ok=False will fail.
    The cause is that SMTP.auth_login _always_ returns a password
    if provided with a challenge string, thus non-compliant with
    the standard for AUTH LOGIN. Also fixes bug with the test for
    smtpd.
  - bpo#43332: Improves the networking efficiency of http.client
    when using a proxy via set_tunnel(). Fewer small send calls
    are made during connection setup.
  - bpo#43399: Fix ElementTree.extend not working on iterators
    when using the Python implementation
  - bpo#43316: The python -m gzip command line application now
    properly fails when detecting an unsupported extension. It
    exits with a non-zero exit code and prints an error message
    to stderr.
  - bpo#43260: Fix TextIOWrapper can not flush internal buffer
    forever after very large text is written.
  - bpo#42782: Fail fast in shutil.move() to avoid creating
    destination directories on failure.
  - bpo#37193: Fixed memory leak in socketserver.ThreadingMixIn
    introduced in Python 3.7.
  - bpo#43199: Answer “Why is there no goto?” in the Design and
    History FAQ.
  - bpo#43407: Clarified that a result from time.monotonic(),
    time.perf_counter(), time.process_time(), or
    time.thread_time() can be compared with the result from any
    following call to the same function - not just the next
    immediate call.
  - bpo#27646: Clarify that ‘yield from <expr>’ works with any
    iterable, not just iterators.
  - bpo#36346: Update some deprecated unicode APIs which are
    documented as “will be removed in 4.0” to “3.12”. See PEP 623
    for detail.
  - bpo#37945: Fix test_getsetlocale_issue1813() of test_locale:
    skip the test if setlocale() fails. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo#41561: Add workaround for Ubuntu’s custom OpenSSL
    security level policy.
  - bpo#43288: Fix test_importlib to correctly skip Unicode file
    tests if the fileystem does not support them.
  - bpo#43617: Improve configure.ac: Check for presence of
    autoconf-archive package and remove our copies of M4 macros.
  - bpo#42225: Document that IDLE can fail on Unix either from
    misconfigured IP masquerage rules or failure displaying
    complex colored (non-ascii) characters.
  - bpo#43283: Document why printing to IDLE’s Shell is often
    slower than printing to a system terminal and that it can be
    made faster by pre-formatting a single string before
    printing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Feb  9 01:37:59 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Add Obsoletes for python3-base when primary interpreter is set to
  properly replace it during upgrades.  (bsc#1181324)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 22:02:03 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.1:
  Security bugs:
  - Prevented potential DoS attack via CPU and RAM exhaustion
    when processing malformed Apple Property List files in binary
    format.
  - The plistlib module no longer accepts entity declarations in
    XML plist files to avoid XML vulnerabilities. This should not
    affect users as entity declarations are not used in regular
    plist files.
  - Add volatile to the accumulator variable in
    hmac.compare_digest, making constant-time-defeating
    optimizations less likely.
  Core and Builtins
  - Allow assignment expressions in set literals and set
    comprehensions as per PEP 572. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Fix a regression introduced by the new parser, where an
    unparenthesized walrus operator was not allowed within
    generator expressions.
  - types.GenericAlias objects can now be the targets of
    weakrefs.
  - Fixed a bug in the PEG parser that was causing crashes in
    debug mode. Now errors are checked in left-recursive rules to
    avoid cases where such errors do not get handled in time and
    appear as long-distance crashes in other places.
  - Fixed a possible crash in the PEG parser when checking for
    the ‘!=’ token in the barry_as_flufl rule. Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - Fix handling of errors during creation of PyFunctionObject,
    which resulted in operations on uninitialized memory. Patch
    by Yonatan Goldschmidt.
  - Fix a bug in the parser, where a curly brace following
    a primary didn’t fail immediately. This led to invalid
    expressions like a {b} to throw a SyntaxError with a wrong
    offset, or invalid expressions ending with a curly brace like
    a { to not fail immediately in the REPL.
  - Fix possible buffer overflow in the new parser when checking
    for continuation lines. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Run the parser two times. On the first run, disable all the
    rules that only generate better error messages to gain
    performance. If there’s a parse failure, run the parser
    a second time with those enabled.
  - Document the default implementation of object.__eq__.
  - Fix peephole optimizer misoptimize conditional jump
    + JUMP_IF_NOT_EXC_MATCH pair.
  - The garbage collector now tracks all user-defined classes.
    Patch by Brandt Bucher.
  - Fixed potential issues with removing not completely
    initialized module from sys.modules when import fails.
  - Star-unpacking is now allowed for with item’s targets in the
    PEG parser.
  - Fixed stack overflow in issubclass() and isinstance() when
    getting the __bases__ attribute leads to infinite recursion.
  - When loading a native module and a load failure occurs,
    prevent a possible UnicodeDecodeError when not running in
    a UTF-8 locale by decoding the load error message using the
    current locale’s encoding.
  - Correctly count control blocks in ‘except’ in compiler.
    Ensures that a syntax error, rather a fatal error, occurs for
    deeply nested, named exception handlers.
  Library
  - types.GenericAlias will now raise a TypeError when attempting
    to initialize with a keyword argument. Previously, this would
    cause the interpreter to crash if the interpreter was
    compiled with debug symbols. This does not affect
    interpreters compiled for release. Patch by Ken Jin.
  - CGIHTTPRequestHandler.run_cgi() HTTP_ACCEPT improperly
    parsed. Replace the special purpose getallmatchingheaders
    with generic get_all method and add relevant tests.
  - inspect.findsource() now raises OSError instead of IndexError
    when co_lineno of a code object is greater than the file
    length. This can happen, for example, when a file is edited
    after it was imported. PR by Irit Katriel.
  - Fix handling of trailing comments by inspect.getsource().
  - ChainMap.__iter__ no longer calls __getitem__ on underlying
    maps
  - TracebackException no longer holds a reference to the
    exception’s traceback object. Consequently, instances of
    TracebackException for equivalent but non-equal exceptions
    now compare as equal.
  - We fixed an issue in pickle.whichmodule in which importing
    multiprocessing could change the how pickle identifies which
    module an object belongs to, potentially breaking the
    unpickling of those objects.
  - Clarify the error message for asyncio.IncompleteReadError
    when expected is None.
  - Extracting a symlink from a tarball should succeed and
    overwrite the symlink if it already exists. The fix is to
    remove the existing file or symlink before extraction. Based
    on patch by Chris AtLee, Jeffrey Kintscher, and Senthil
    Kumaran.
  - Fixed tkinter.ttk.Style.map(). The function accepts now the
    representation of the default state as empty sequence (as
    returned by Style.map()). The structure of the result is now
    the same on all platform and does not depend on the value of
    wantobjects.
  - Fix various issues with typing.Literal parameter handling
    (flatten, deduplicate, use type to cache key). Patch provided
    by Yurii Karabas.
  - Fix the threading.Thread class at fork: do nothing if the
    thread is already stopped (ex: fork called at Python exit).
    Previously, an error was logged in the child process.
  - The onerror callback from shutil.rmtree now receives correct
    function when os.open fails.
  - Fix os.sendfile() on illumos.
  - Fixed writing binary Plist files larger than 4 GiB.
  - The repr() of typing types containing Generic Alias Types
    previously did not show the parameterized types in the
    GenericAlias. They have now been changed to do so.
  - webbrowser: Ignore NotADirectoryError when calling
    xdg-settings.
  - binhex.binhex() consisently writes macOS 9 line endings.
  - Fix a stack overflow error for asyncio Task or Future repr().
  - The overflow occurs under some circumstances when a Task or
    Future recursively returns itself.
  - Fix memory leak in subprocess.Popen() in case an uid (gid)
    specified in user (group, extra_groups) overflows uid_t
    (gid_t).
  - Improve asyncio.wait function to create the futures set just
    one time.
  - InvalidFileException and RecursionError are now the only
    errors caused by loading malformed binary Plist file
    (previously ValueError and TypeError could be raised in some
    specific cases).
  - Pickling heap types implemented in C with protocols 0 and
    1 raises now an error instead of producing incorrect data.
  - plistlib: fix parsing XML plists with hexadecimal integer
    values
  - Fix an incorrectly formatted error from
    _codecs.charmap_decode() when called with a mapped value
    outside the range of valid Unicode code points. PR by Max
    Bernstein.
  - Fix pickling pure Python datetime.time subclasses. Patch by
    Dean Inwood.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing ctypes.util.find_library() to
    return None when triying to locate a library in an
    environment when gcc>=9 is available and ldconfig is not.
    Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - C14N 2.0 serialisation in xml.etree.ElementTree failed for
    unprefixed attributes when a default namespace was defined.
  - Fix a bug in the symtable module that was causing
    module-scope global variables to not be reported as both
    local and global. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - str() for the type attribute of the tkinter.Event object
    always returns now the numeric code returned by Tk instead of
    the name of the event type.
  - fix tkinter.EventType Enum so all members are strings, and
    none are tuples
  - Fix SQLite3 segfault when backing up closed database. Patch
    contributed by Peter David McCormick.
  - Fix the tarfile module to write only basename of TAR file to
    GZIP compression header.
  - Allow ctypes.wintypes to be imported on non-Windows systems.
  - shutil.which() now ignores empty entries in PATHEXT instead
    of treating them as a match.
  - Fix time-of-check/time-of-action issue in
    subprocess.Popen.send_signal.
  - Fix --outfile for cProfile / profile not writing the output
    file in the original directory when the program being
    profiled changes the working directory. PR by Anthony
    Sottile.
  - ZipFile truncates files to avoid corruption when a shorter
    comment is provided in append (“a”) mode. Patch by Jan Mazur.
  - Fixed KeyError exception when flattening an email to a string
    attempts to replace a non-existent Content-Transfer-Encoding
    header.
  Documentation
  - Fix the URL for the IMAP protocol documents.
  - Document __format__ functionality for IP addresses.
  - Clarify that subscription expressions are also valid for
    certain classes and types in the standard library, and for
    user-defined classes and types if the classmethod
    __class_getitem__() is provided.
  - Documented generic alias type and types.GenericAlias. Also
    added an entry in glossary for generic types.
  - In Programming FAQ “Sequences (Tuples/Lists)” section, add
    “How do you remove multiple items from a list”.
  - Fix RemovedInSphinx40Warning when building the documentation.
    Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Update the refcounts info of PyType_FromModuleAndSpec.
  - Fix tarfile’s extractfile documentation
  - Document some restrictions on the default string
    representations of numeric classes.
  Tests
  - Reenable test_gdb on gdb 9.2 and newer:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1866884 bug is
    fixed in gdb 10.1.
  - Fix test_asyncio.test_call_later() race condition: don’t
    measure asyncio performance in the call_later() unit test.
    The test failed randomly on the CI.
  - Include _testinternalcapi module in Windows installer for
    test suite
  - Fix test_logging.test_race_between_set_target_and_flush():
    the test now waits until all threads complete to avoid
    leaking running threads.
  - Avoid a test failure in test_lib2to3 if the module has
    already imported at the time the test executes. Patch by
    Pablo Galindo.
  - Tests for CJK codecs no longer call eval() on content
    received via HTTP.
  - Fix test_site.test_license_exists_at_url(): call
    urllib.request.urlcleanup() to reset the global
    urllib.request._opener. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - test_ssl: skip test_min_max_version_mismatch when TLS 1.0 is
    not available
  - Add tests for SIGINT handling in the runpy module.
  - Fixed a failure in test_tk.test_widgets.ScaleTest happening
    when executing the test with Tk 8.6.10.
  Build
  - Fix a race condition in “make regen-all” when make -jN option
    is used to run jobs in parallel. The clinic.py script now
    only use atomic write to write files. Moveover, generated
    files are now left unchanged if the content does not change,
    to not change the file modification time.
  - Update Py_UNREACHABLE to use __builtin_unreachable() if only
    the compiler is able to use it. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Addressed three compiler warnings found by undefined behavior
    sanitizer (ubsan).

  - Fix reporting offset of the RE error in searchengine.
  - Get docstrings for IDLE calltips more often by using
    inspect.getdoc.
  - Mostly finish using ttk widgets, mainly for editor, settings,
    and searches. Some patches by Mark Roseman.
  - Use ‘IDLE Shell’ as shell title
  - Rewrite the Calltips doc section.
  - In calltips, stop reminding that ‘/’ marks the end of
    positional-only arguments.
  - Typing opening and closing parentheses inside the parentheses
    of a function call will no longer cause unnecessary
    “flashing” off and on of an existing open call-tip, e.g. when
    typed in a string literal.
  C API
  - Fix potential crash in deallocating method objects when
    dynamically allocated PyMethodDef’s lifetime is managed
    through the self argument of a PyCFunction.
  - Py_FileSystemDefaultEncodeErrors and Py_UTF8Mode are
    available again in limited API.

  version in python36.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 10 00:26:51 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Last try before this results in an editwar:
  * remove importlib_resources and importlib-metadata
    provides/obsoletes
  * import importlib_resources is not the same as
    import importlib.resources, same for metadata
  * The backport packages from PyPI needed for older flavors are
    specified as such for setuptools or in pyproject.toml. If a
    package requires them they typically add them with a python
    version qualifier and the packages have their own version
    numbers.

- Removed CVE-2019-20907_tarfile-inf-loop.patch: fixed in upstream
- Removed recursion.tar: contained in upstream
- Update to 3.9.0b5:
  - bpo-41304: Fixes python3x._pth being ignored on Windows, caused
    by the fix for bpo-29778 (CVE-2020-15801).
  - bpo-41162: Audit hooks are now cleared later during
    finalization to avoid missing events.
  - bpo-29778: Ensure python3.dll is loaded from correct locations
    when Python is embedded (CVE-2020-15523).
  - bpo-39603: Prevent http header injection by rejecting control
    characters in http.client.putrequest(…).
  - bpo-41295: Resolve a regression in CPython 3.8.4 where defining
    “__setattr__” in a multi-inheritance setup and
    calling up the hierarchy chain could fail if builtins/extension
    types were involved in the base types.
  - bpo-41247: Always cache the running loop holder when running
    asyncio.set_running_loop.
  - bpo-41252: Fix incorrect refcounting in
    _ssl.c’s _servername_callback().
  - bpo-41215: Use non-NULL default values in the PEG parser
    keyword list to overcome a bug that was '
    preventing Python from being properly compiled when using the
    XLC compiler. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo-41218: Python 3.8.3 had a regression where compiling with
    ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT would
    aggressively mark list comprehension with CO_COROUTINE. Now only
    list comprehension making use of async/await will tagged as so.
  - bpo-41175: Guard against a NULL pointer dereference within
    bytearrayobject triggered by the bytearray() + bytearray() operation.
  - bpo-39960: The “hackcheck” that prevents sneaking around a type’s
    __setattr__() by calling the superclass method was
    rewritten to allow C implemented heap types.
  - bpo-41288: Unpickling invalid NEWOBJ_EX opcode with the
    C implementation raises now UnpicklingError instead of crashing.
  - bpo-39017: Avoid infinite loop when reading specially crafted
    TAR files using the tarfile module (CVE-2019-20907, bsc#1174091).

    DistutilsExecError is raised when the command is not found.
  - bpo-39168: Remove the __new__ method of typing.Generic.
  - bpo-41194: Fix a crash in the _ast module: it can no longer be
    loaded more than once. It now uses a global state rather than a module state.
  - bpo-39384: Fixed email.contentmanager to allow set_content() to set a
    null string.
  - bpo-41300: Save files with non-ascii chars.
    Fix regression released in 3.9.0b4 and 3.8.4.
  - bpo-37765: Add keywords to module name completion list.
    Rewrite Completions section of IDLE doc.
  - bpo-40170: Revert PyType_HasFeature() change: it reads
    again directly the PyTypeObject.tp_flags
    member when the limited C API is not used, rather than always calling
    PyType_GetFlags() which hides implementation details.

  is only 114kB and it provides python3-base with a working hashlib
  module.
  (also, this fixes bnc#743787)
