    <comment>Update to 3.15.0~a3:
- Security
    - gh-142145: Remove quadratic behavior in xml.minidom node ID
      cache clearing (CVE-2025-12084, bsc#1254997).
    - gh-42400: Fix buffer overflow in _Py_wrealpath() for paths
      exceeding MAXPATHLEN bytes by using dynamic memory
      allocation instead of fixed-size buffer. Patch by Shamil
      Abdulaev.
    - gh-119451: Fix a potential memory denial of service in the
      http.client module. When connecting to a malicious server,
      it could cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be
      allocated. This could have led to symptoms including
      a MemoryError, swapping, out of memory (OOM) killed
      processes or containers, or even system crashes
      (CVE-2025-13836, bsc#1254400).
    - gh-119342: Fix a potential memory denial of service in the
      plistlib module. When reading a Plist file received from
      untrusted source, it could cause an arbitrary amount of
      memory to be allocated. This could have led to symptoms
      including a MemoryError, swapping, out of memory (OOM)
      killed processes or containers, or even system crashes
      (CVE-2025-13837, bsc#1254401).
- Library
    - gh-142754: Add the ownerDocument attribute to
      xml.dom.minidom elements and attributes created by directly
      instantiating the Element or Attr class. Note that this way
      of creating nodes is not supported; creator functions like
      xml.dom.Document.documentElement() should be used instead.
    - gh-142594: Fix crash in TextIOWrapper.close() when the
      underlying buffer’s closed property calls detach().</comment>
