  <title>Compare the difference between numbers against a given tolerance</title>
  <description>At some point or another, most programmers find they need to compare
floating-point numbers for equality. The typical idiom is to test if the
absolute value of the difference of the numbers is within a desired tolerance,
usually called epsilon. This module provides such a function for use with
Test::Harness. Usage is similar to other test functions described in
Test::More.</description>
