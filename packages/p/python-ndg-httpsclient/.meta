  <description>This is a HTTPS client implementation for httplib and urllib2 based on
PyOpenSSL.  PyOpenSSL provides a more fully featured SSL implementation over the
default provided with Python and importantly enables full verification of the
SSL peer.


Prerequisites

This has been developed and tested for Python 2.6 and 2.7 with pyOpenSSL 0.13 and 0.14.
Version 0.4.0 tested with pyOpenSSL 0.15.1 and Python 2.7 and 3.4.  Note that proxy support
is only available from Python 2.6.2 onwards.  pyasn1 is required for correct SSL
