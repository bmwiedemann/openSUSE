%description
PCollections serves as a persistent and immutable analogue of the Java
Collections Framework. This includes efficient, thread-safe, generic,
immutable, and persistent stacks, maps, vectors, sets, and bags, compatible
with their Java Collections counterparts.

Persistent and immutable datatypes are increasingly appreciated as a simple,
design-friendly, concurrency-friendly, and sometimes more time- and
space-efficient alternative to mutable datatypes.
