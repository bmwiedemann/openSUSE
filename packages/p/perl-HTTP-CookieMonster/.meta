  <title>Easy read/write access to your jar of HTTP::Cookies</title>
  <description>This module was created because messing around with HTTP::Cookies is non-trivial. HTTP::Cookies a very useful module, but using it is not always as easy and clean as it could be. For instance, if you want to find a particular cookie, you can't just ask for it by name.</description>
