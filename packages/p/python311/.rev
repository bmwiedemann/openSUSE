    <comment>- Update to 3.11.0b4:
- Fixes many bugs and adds following more significant changes
- Security
  - gh-68966: The deprecated mailcap module now refuses to inject
    Coreunsafe text (filenames, MIME types, parameters) into
    shell Corecommands. Instead of using such text, it will
    warn and act Coreas if a match was not found (or for test
    commands, as if the Coretest failed). and Builtins
  - gh-93516: Lazily create a table mapping bytecode offsets to
    line numbers to speed up calculation of line numbers when
    tracing.
  - gh-93461: importlib.invalidate_caches() now drops entries
    from sys.path_importer_cache with a relative path as
    name. This solves a caching issue when a process changes its
    current working directory.
  - FileFinder no longer inserts a dot in the path, e.g.
    /egg/./spam is now /egg/spam.
Library
  - gh-93896: Fix asyncio.run() and
    unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase to always the set event loop
    as it was done in Python 3.10 and earlier. Patch by Kumar
    Aditya.
  - gh-94101: Manual instantiation of ssl.SSLSession objects is
    no longer allowed as it lead to misconfigured instances that
    crashed the interpreter when attributes where accessed on
    them.
  - gh-83658: Make multiprocessing.Pool raise an exception if
    maxtasksperchild is not None or a positive int.
  - gh-61162: Clarify sqlite3 behavior when Using the connection
    as a context manager.
Tools/Demos
  - gh-94538: Fix Argument Clinic output to custom file
    destinations. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
C API
  - gh-93937: The following frame functions and type are now
    directly available with #include &lt;Python.h&gt;, it’s no longer
    needed to add #include &lt;frameobject.h&gt;:
        PyFrame_Check()
        PyFrame_GetBack()
        PyFrame_GetBuiltins()
        PyFrame_GetGenerator()
        PyFrame_GetGlobals()
        PyFrame_GetLasti()
        PyFrame_GetLocals()
        PyFrame_Type

    <comment>- Update to 3.11.0b5:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-93351: ast.AST node positions are now validated when
      provided to compile() and other related functions. If
      invalid positions are detected, a ValueError will be
      raised.
    - gh-94438: Fix an issue that caused extended opcode
      arguments and some conditional pops to be ignored when
      calculating valid jump targets for assignments to the
      f_lineno attribute of frame objects. In some cases, this
      could cause inconsistent internal state, resulting in a
      hard crash of the interpreter.
    - gh-95060: Undocumented PyCode_Addr2Location function now
      properly returns when addrq argument is less than zero.
    - gh-95113: Replace all EXTENDED_ARG_QUICK instructions
      with basic EXTENDED_ARG instructions in unquickened
      code. Consumers of non-adaptive bytecode should be able to
      handle extended arguments the same way they were handled in
      CPython 3.10 and older.
    - gh-91409: Fix incorrect source location info caused by
      certain optimizations in the bytecode compiler.
    - gh-94036: Fix incorrect source location info for some
      multi-line attribute accesses and method calls.
    - gh-94739: Allow jumping within, out of, and across
      exception handlers in the debugger.
    - gh-94949: ast.parse() will no longer parse parenthesized
      context managers when passed feature_version less than (3,
      9). Patch by Shantanu Jain.
    - gh-94947: ast.parse() will no longer parse assignment
      expressions when passed feature_version less than (3,
      8). Patch by Shantanu Jain.
    - gh-91256: Ensures the program name is known for help text
      during interpreter startup.
    - gh-94869: Fix the column offsets for some expressions in
      multi-line f-strings ast nodes. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-94822: Fix an issue where lookups of metaclass
      descriptors may be ignored when an identically-named
      attribute also exists on the class itself.
    - gh-91153: Fix an issue where a bytearray item assignment
      could crash if it’s resized by the new value’s __index__()
      method.
    - gh-90699: Fix reference counting bug in
      bool.__repr__(). Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Library
    - gh-95087: Fix IndexError in parsing invalid date in the
      email module.
    - gh-95199: Upgrade bundled setuptools to 63.2.0.
    - gh-95194: Upgrade bundled pip to 22.2.
    - gh-95132: Fix a sqlite3 regression where *args and **kwds
      were incorrectly relayed from connect() to the Connection
      factory. The regression was introduced in 3.11a1 with PR
      24421 (gh-85128). Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.`
    - gh-93157: Fix fileinput module didn’t support errors option
      when inplace is true.
    - gh-95105: wsgiref.types.InputStream.__iter__() should
      return Iterator[bytes], not Iterable[bytes]. Patch by
      Shantanu Jain.
    - gh-94857: Fix refleak in
      _io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - gh-94821: Fix binding of unix socket to empty address
      on Linux to use an available address from the abstract
      namespace, instead of “0”.
    - gh-89988: Fix memory leak in pickle.Pickler when looking up
      dispatch_table. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - bpo-47025: Drop support for bytes on sys.path.
  - Tests
    - gh-95212: Make multiprocessing test case
      test_shared_memory_recreate parallel-safe.
  - Build
    - gh-94847: Fixed _decimal module build issue on GCC when
      compiling with LTO and pydebug. Debug builds no longer
      force inlining of functions.
    - gh-94841: Fix the possible performance regression of
      PyObject_Free() compiled with MSVC version 1932.
    - gh-94801: configure now uses custom flags like ZLIB_CFLAGS
      and ZLIB_LIBS when searching for headers and libraries.
    - gh-94773: deepfreeze.py now supports code object with
      frozensets that contain incompatible, unsortable types.
  - C API
    - gh-94930: Fix SystemError raised when
      PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords() is used with # in (...) but
      without PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN defined.
    - gh-94864: Fix PyArg_Parse* with deprecated format units “u”
      and “Z”. It returned 1 (success) when warnings are turned
      into exceptions.
    - gh-94731: Python again uses C-style casts for
      most casting operations when compiled with
      C++. This may trigger compiler warnings, if they
      are enabled with e.g. -Wold-style-cast `` or
      ``-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant options for g++.
