          + Fix : [RT #115792] : Latest blead stack unwind work causes infloop
                  in a test.
                  A change in how the core frees temporary values after eval
                  interacted badly with Variable::Magic and caused infinite loops
                  when a free callback was attached to a wizard. This change was
                  temporarily reverted, but is going to be reinstated, and
                  Variable::Magic is now able to play nicely when this happens.
                  Thanks Peter Rabbitson for reporting and David Mitchell for
                  providing a fix.

          + Chg : A large chunk of boilerplate XS code, which is also used in
                  other XS modules, has been factored out of the main .xs file
                  to a collection of .h files in the xsh subdirectory.
          + Fix : [RT #128989] : Bleadperl v5.25.3-266-g1d7e644 breaks V::M.
                  Len magic is no longer called for negative array indices
                  fetches, so the relevant tests are now skipped.
                  Thanks Andreas Koenig for reporting.

          + Chg : The magic callbacks are now always executed in a new stack.
                  This should have no negative impact (performance-wise or
                  behaviour-wise) on your code, but may actually fix some obscure
                  bugs.
          + Fix : [RT #107294] : Crash during install of Variable-Magic-0.58
                  running "t\18-opinfo.t".
                  A recent change in the core implementation of transliterations
                  caused an undefined behaviour when it interacted with this
                  module, which resulted in visible stack corruption on Win32
                  perls compiled with MSVC when the op_info feature was enabled.
                  This was fixed by using a separate stack for the magic
                  callbacks.
                  Thanks Peter Stokes for reporting and providing greatly
                  helpful feedback.
          + Fix : The object op_info feature will now handle correctly Unicode
                  transliteration, multideref and custom ops.

          + Add : If a non-len magic callback returns a reference, it will now
                  only be freed at the end of the statement that caused the
                  magic to trigger. This allows the user to attach free magic
                  (or a plain destructor) to a token returned from the callbacks
                  in order to defer an action after the magic is processed by
                  perl.
          + Fix : Test failures of threads tests on systems with harsh resource
                  constraints causing the threads to exit() during run.

          + Chg : The new environment variable to enable thread tests on older
                  perls is PERL_FORCE_TEST_THREADS. Note that this variable
                  should only be turned on by authors.
          + Fix : Segfaults when the module is loaded by several threads (or
                  Windows emulated processes) ran in parallel.
          + Fix : Segfaults when the module is loaded in a thread, which spawns
                  itself a new thread, and that child thread outlives its parent.
          + Fix : Small memory leaks of structures required for thread safety.
          + Fix : Update the Windows ActivePerl + gcc 3.4 workaround for
                  ExtUtils::MakeMaker 7.04. Thanks Christian Walde for reporting
                  and feedback on this issue.
          + Tst : The global destruction test will now be exercised on any perl
                  that has DEBUGGING set.
          + Tst : Optional capturing tests in t/17-ctl.t that were only run when
                  Capture::Tiny was present were converted to an IPC::Open3
                  based helper and will now be run everywhere.

          + Fix : [RT #101410] : Install fails in blead
                  Even though the change that caused this error was reverted from
                  blead, lvalue uses of ERRSV have been removed from this module
                  so that there will be no breakage when this change is possibly
                  reintroduced in the following months.
                  Thanks Dave Rolsky for reporting.
          + Tst : $ENV{$Config{ldlibpthname}} is now preserved on all platforms,
                  which will address failures of t/17-ctl.t with unusual
                  compilers (like icc) that link all their compiled objects to
                  their own libraries.
          + Tst : The global destruction test is now only run on perl 5.13.4 and
                  higher, and only if either Perl::Destruct::Level is installed
                  or PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL is set and the perl is a debugging perl.
                  This will solve rare crashes of t/15-self.t on perl 5.13.3 and
                  older.
  
  0.55    2014-10-20 23:45 UTC
          + Fix : [RT #99319] : t/18-opinfo.t: test failure due to change in
                  perl 5 blead
                  The new METHOP op class added in perl 5.21.5 is now supported.
                  Thanks James E Keenan for reporting.
  
  0.54    2014-09-22 17:30 UTC
          + Add : The new constant VMG_COMPAT_CODE_COPY_CLONE evaluates to true
                  if your perl calls 'copy' magic when a magical code prototype
                  is cloned, which is currently the case for perl 5.17.0 and
                  above.
          + Fix : [RT #90205] : copy magic on subs puts raw CV in $_[3]
                  $_[3] will now contain a reference to the cloned code when
                  'copy' magic is called for a coderef.
                  Thanks Lukas Mai for reporting.
          + Fix : t/35-stash.t has been taught about perl 5.21.4.
          + Fix : Tests using run_perl() in t/17-ctl.t will no longer fail on
                  Android.

                Thanks dsteinbrunner@pobox.com for the patch.
        + Tst : Author tests are no longer bundled with this distribution.
                They are only made available to authors in the git repository.

Mon Jun 10 11:00:00 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.52
         + Add : The new constant VMG_COMPAT_SCALAR_NOLEN evaluates to true
                 when your perl does not call 'len' magic for scalars, which
                 is the case for perl 5.17.4 and above.
                 This fixes RT #80388.
         + Tst : t/35-stash.t has been taught about perl 5.17.4.
         + Tst : Author tests overhaul.
         + Fix : It is now safe to call dispell() from inside 'free', 'copy' and
                 'uvar' callbacks to dispell the magic currently in use.
                 Thanks Clinton Gormley for reporting.
         + Fix : Exceptions thrown from inside a 'free' callback are now always
                 consistently propagated outside of the callback. They used to
                 be lost when the 'free' callback was invoked at the end of an
                 eval block or string.
         + Fix : The 'reset RMG flag' workaroundn used to allow wizards with
                 both 'uvar' and 'clear' magics to be cast onto a hash, has been
                 made thread-safe.
         + Fix : Less memory is leaked when a wizard is freed during global
                 destruction, or when an exception is thrown from a 'free'
                 callback.
         + Fix : [RT #77991] : t/17-ctl.t fails on perl 5.14 and 5.16.
                 This was actually an issue with ActivePerl, and this test
                 has learned to cope with it.
                 Thanks Gisle Aas for reporting.
         + Tst : t/35-stash.t has been taught about perl 5.17.1.
         + Doc : Many clarifications.
         This is a maintenance release. The code contains no functional change.
         Satisfied users of version 0.48 can skip this update.
         + Fix : [RT #77644] : t/17_ctl.t fails in test 44 since 5.17.0.
                 This test has been taught about perl 5.17.0.
                 Thanks Reini Urban for reporting.
         + Tst : t/99-kwalitee.t will be skipped when only problematic versions
                 of its dependencies are available.

- update to 0.47
  + Add : The new constant VMG_COMPAT_HASH_DELETE_NOUVAR_VOID evaluates
          to true when "delete $hash{key}" does not call 'delete' uvar
          magic in void context.
  + Chg : The MAGIC tokens created by this module no longer use the
          mg_private member for storing a "magical" signature.
  + Fix : Triggering magic in a thread on a variable cloned from the main
          interpreter, and when the wizard already went out of scope,
          will not segfault anymore.
  + Opt : The pointer table is no longer needed to ensure thread safety.
          The size of the object code is about 8% smaller for threaded
          perls.
  + Tst : Threads tests will not fail anymore if resources constraints
          prevent the system from creating all the required threads.

        + Tst : Threads tests are now only run on perl 5.13.4 and higher.
        + Rem : Support for development perls from the 5.11 branch but older
                than the 5.11.0 release was removed. This could cause more
                recent setups to fail.
