Tue Jan  7 13:38:42 UTC 2014 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 1.11:
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Switched to using wheels for the bundled
    copies of setuptools and pip. Using sdists is no longer supported
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Modified the handling of --extra-search-dirs.
    This option now works like pip’s --find-links option, in that it
    adds extra directories to search for compatible wheels for pip and
    setuptools. The actual wheel selected is chosen based on version
    and compatibility, using the same algorithm as pip install setuptools.
  + Upgraded pip to v1.5
  + Upgraded setuptools to v1.4
- Symlink /usr/bin/virtualenv in buildroot (u-a warning) and ghost
  alternatives link on 12.3 or newer

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 11 08:50:45 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 1.10.1:

  + Upgraded pip to v1.4.1
  + Upgraded setuptools to v0.9.8

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 15:28:21 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Don't drop shipped setuptools / pip, they've been fetched from the
  interwebs previously. It doesn't make sense to use the (currently
  matching) system equivalents, it's meant to be self-contained

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 14:39:38 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Use update-alternatives for parallel-installability with Python3 version

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 14:29:55 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 1.10:
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Dropped support for Python 2.5. The minimum supported
    Python version is now Python 2.6.
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Using virtualenv.py as an isolated script (i.e.
    without an associated virtualenv_support directory) is no longer supported
    for security reasons and will fail with an error.
  + Along with this, --never-download is now always pinned to True, and is only
    being maintained in the short term for backward compatibility (Pull #412).
  + IMPORTANT Switched to the new setuptools (v0.9.7) which has been merged with
    Distribute again and works for Python 2 and 3 with one codebase. The 
    --distribute and --setuptools options are now no-op.
  + Updated to pip 1.4.
  + Added support for PyPy3k
  + Added the option to use a version number with the -p option to get the system
    copy of that Python version (Windows only)
  + Removed embedded ez_setup.py, distribute_setup.py and distribute_from_egg.py
    files as part of switching to merged setuptools.
  + Fixed --relocatable to work better on Windows.
  + Fixed issue with readline on Windows.
- Spec clean:
  + Depend on setuptools instead of distribute again
  + Package README.rst
  + Build HTML documentation and install it (instead of sources)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to 1.8.4:

    regression) on UTF-8 platforms, and provides a workaround on
    other platforms: PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 pip install numpy.

    out arguments the distribute setup script won't understand.
    Fixes #358.

    avoid wrong 32-bit compiles in the venv. Fixes #328. Thanks Damien
    Nozay.

    csh shells. Fixes #332. Thanks Benjamin Root for report and patch.

    78 characters, without breaking creation of virtualenvs with
    non-ASCII paths. Thanks, Bradley Ayers.
