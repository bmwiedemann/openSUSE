    <comment>- Don't drop shipped setuptools / pip, they've been fetched from the
  interwebs previously. It doesn't make sense to use the (currently
  matching) system equivalents, it's meant to be self-contained

- Use update-alternatives for parallel-installability with Python3 version

- Update to version 1.10:
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Dropped support for Python 2.5. The minimum supported
    Python version is now Python 2.6.
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Using virtualenv.py as an isolated script (i.e.
    without an associated virtualenv_support directory) is no longer supported
    for security reasons and will fail with an error.
  + Along with this, --never-download is now always pinned to True, and is only
    being maintained in the short term for backward compatibility (Pull #412).
  + IMPORTANT Switched to the new setuptools (v0.9.7) which has been merged with
    Distribute again and works for Python 2 and 3 with one codebase. The 
    --distribute and --setuptools options are now no-op.
  + Updated to pip 1.4.
  + Added support for PyPy3k
  + Added the option to use a version number with the -p option to get the system
    copy of that Python version (Windows only)
  + Removed embedded ez_setup.py, distribute_setup.py and distribute_from_egg.py
    files as part of switching to merged setuptools.
  + Fixed --relocatable to work better on Windows.
  + Fixed issue with readline on Windows.
- Spec clean:
  + Depend on setuptools instead of distribute again
  + Package README.rst
  + Build HTML documentation and install it (instead of sources)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.11:
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Switched to using wheels for the bundled
    copies of setuptools and pip. Using sdists is no longer supported
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Modified the handling of --extra-search-dirs.
    This option now works like pip’s --find-links option, in that it
    adds extra directories to search for compatible wheels for pip and
    setuptools. The actual wheel selected is chosen based on version
    and compatibility, using the same algorithm as pip install setuptools.
  + Upgraded pip to v1.5
  + Upgraded setuptools to v1.4

    <comment>- Use multibuild to avoid cycles with pytest

- Update to 16.7.5:
  * fix powershell activation when sourced (#1398)
  * fix regression - sh activation script not working under sh (only bash) (#1396)
  * activate.ps1 syntax and style updated to follow PSStyleAnalyzer rules (#1371)
  * Allow creating virtual environments for 3.xy. (#1385)
  * Report error when running activate scripts directly
  * Extend the LICENSE search paths list by lib64/pythonX.Y to support Linux vendors who install their Python to /usr/lib64/pythonX.Y
  * Raise an error if the target path contains the operating systems path separator (using this would break our activation scripts)
  * Drop Jython support
  * Add tests covering prompt manipulation during activation/deactivation, and harmonize behavior of all supported shells

- Update to 16.4.3:
  * Revert the symlink fix, causing debian packaging issues. (#1390)
  * Fix license() builtin by copying the LICENSE file into the virtualenv - by asottile. (#1317)
  * fixes the scenario where the python base install is symlinked with relative symlinks (#490)
  * Use importlib over imp in virtualenv.py for python &gt;= 3.4 - by Anthony Sottile (#1293)
  * Copy or link PyPy header files instead of include directory itself (#1302)
  * Allow virtualenv creation with older pip not having config command correspondingly disabling configuration related features (such as pip cert setting) in this case. (#1303)
  * Use importlib over deprecated imp` in ``distutils/__init__.py for python 3 - by Anthony Sottile (#955)
  * Preserve cert option defined in pip.conf or environment variable. (#1273)
  * fixed a ResourceWarning: unclosed file in call_subprocess() - by Mickaël Schoentgen (#1277)
  * pre-import some built-in modules in site.py on PyPy according to PyPy's site.py - by microdog (#1281)
  * Copy files from sys.exec_prefix only if it is really different path than used prefix, bugfix for #1270 (#1282)
  * copyfile handles relative symlinks and symlinks to symlinks, avoiding problems when Python was installed using stow or homebrew. (#268)
  * Fix preserving of original path when using fish and a subshell. (#904)
  * Drop the source layout of the project, going back to how the source was laid out before 16.1.0. (#1241)
  * Fix bootstrap script generation broken with 16.0.0. Support now both CPython, pypy, jython. (#1244)
  * lib64 symlink is again relative (as was with &lt; 16.1.0). (#1248)</comment>

- update to 20.0.21:
  - Fix virtualenv fails sometimes when run concurrently, ``--clear-app-data`` conflicts with :option:`clear` flag when
    abbreviation is turned on. To bypass this while allowing abbreviated flags on the command line we had to move it to
    :option:`reset-app-data` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1824 &lt;https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1824&gt;`_)

    <comment>- Add missing Requires on two modules. 
- Drop no longer required appdirs Requires.
- Shift new BuildRequires to :test to avoid cycles.

- Switch off tests, they are just broken.

- Update to 20.7.0:
  - Removed xonsh activator due to this breaking fairly often the
    CI and lack of support from those packages maintainers,
    upstream is encouraged to continue supporting the project as
    a plugin
  - Support Python interpreters without distutils (fallback to
    syconfig in these cases)
  - Plugins now use 'selectable' entry points
  - add libffi-7.dll to the hard-coded list of dlls for PyPy
  - Drop python 3.4 support as it has been over 2 years since EOL
  - Use the better maintained platformdirs instead of appdirs
  - Built in discovery class is always preferred over plugin
    supplied classes.
  - On the programmatic API allow passing in the environment
    variable dictionary to use, defaults to os.environ if not
    specified
  - The builtin discovery takes now a --try-first-with argument
    and is first attempted as valid interpreters. One can use
    this to force discovery of a given python executable when the
    discovery order/mechanism raises errors</comment>

- Drop no longer required appdirs Requires.
- Shift new BuildRequires to :test to avoid cycles.
- Switch off tests, they are just broken.
- Update to 20.7.0:
  - Removed xonsh activator due to this breaking fairly often the
    CI and lack of support from those packages maintainers,
    upstream is encouraged to continue supporting the project as
    a plugin
  - Support Python interpreters without distutils (fallback to
    syconfig in these cases)
  - Plugins now use 'selectable' entry points
  - add libffi-7.dll to the hard-coded list of dlls for PyPy

    variable dictionary to use, defaults to os.environ if not
    specified

    and is first attempted as valid interpreters. One can use
    this to force discovery of a given python executable when the
    discovery order/mechanism raises errors
- Actually switch off all activation tests, so we can shed all those
  dependencies.
- Skip test_xonsh on platforms we don't carry xonsh.

  * performs this - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1896 &lt;https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1896&gt;`_)
  * Use ``\n`` instead if ``\r\n`` as line separator for report (because Python already performs this transformation
  * automatically upon write to the logging pipe) - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1905 &lt;https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1905&gt;`_)

- Add missing dependencies
- Skip online test test_seed_link_via_app_data

- Update to version 1.11:
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Switched to using wheels for the bundled
    copies of setuptools and pip. Using sdists is no longer supported
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Modified the handling of --extra-search-dirs.
    This option now works like pip’s --find-links option, in that it
    adds extra directories to search for compatible wheels for pip and
    setuptools. The actual wheel selected is chosen based on version
    and compatibility, using the same algorithm as pip install setuptools.
  + Upgraded pip to v1.5
  + Upgraded setuptools to v1.4
- Symlink /usr/bin/virtualenv in buildroot (u-a warning) and ghost
  alternatives link on 12.3 or newer
- Update to version 1.10.1:

    fingerprint: 7C6B 7C5D 5E2B 6356 A926 F04F 6E3C BCE9 3372 DCFA
  + Upgraded pip to v1.4.1
  + Upgraded setuptools to v0.9.8
- Don't drop shipped setuptools / pip, they've been fetched from the
  interwebs previously. It doesn't make sense to use the (currently
  matching) system equivalents, it's meant to be self-contained
- Use update-alternatives for parallel-installability with Python3 version
- Update to version 1.10:
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Dropped support for Python 2.5. The minimum supported
    Python version is now Python 2.6.
  + BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Using virtualenv.py as an isolated script (i.e.
    without an associated virtualenv_support directory) is no longer supported
    for security reasons and will fail with an error.
  + Along with this, --never-download is now always pinned to True, and is only
    being maintained in the short term for backward compatibility (Pull #412).
  + IMPORTANT Switched to the new setuptools (v0.9.7) which has been merged with
    Distribute again and works for Python 2 and 3 with one codebase. The
    --distribute and --setuptools options are now no-op.
  + Updated to pip 1.4.
  + Added support for PyPy3k
  + Added the option to use a version number with the -p option to get the system
    copy of that Python version (Windows only)
  + Removed embedded ez_setup.py, distribute_setup.py and distribute_from_egg.py
    files as part of switching to merged setuptools.
  + Fixed --relocatable to work better on Windows.
  + Fixed issue with readline on Windows.
- Spec clean:
  + Depend on setuptools instead of distribute again
  + Package README.rst
  + Build HTML documentation and install it (instead of sources)

    debian/ubuntu (Pull #379).
  * Fixed issue with readline module path on pypy and OSX (Pull #374).
  * Made 64bit detection compatible with Python 2.5 (Pull #393).
- Update to 1.8.4:
  - Updated distribute to 0.6.31. This fixes #359 (numpy install

    symlink, and more explicit about full paths. Fixes #334 and #330.
    Thanks Jeremy Orem.

    avoid wrong 32-bit compiles in the venv. Fixes #328. Thanks Damien
    Nozay.

    installing, so virtualenv for multiple Python versions can be
    installed to the same script location. Thanks Miki Tebeka.
  - Restored ability to create a virtualenv with a path longer than
    78 characters, without breaking creation of virtualenvs with
    non-ASCII paths. Thanks, Bradley Ayers.
  - Added ability to create virtualenvs without having installed
