  <title>Check that the Changes file matches the distribution.</title>
  <description>This module checks that you _Changes_ file has an entry for the current
version of the *Module* being tested.

The version information for the distribution being tested is taken out of
the Build data, or if that is not found, out of the Makefile.

It then attempts to open, in order, a file with the name _Changes_ or
_CHANGES_.

The _Changes_ file is then parsed for version numbers. If one and only one
of the version numbers matches the test passes. Otherwise the test fails.

A message with the current version is printed if the test passes, otherwise
dialog messages are printed to help explain the failure.

The _examples_ directory contains examples of the different formats of
_Changes_ files that are recognized.</description>
