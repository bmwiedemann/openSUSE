  <title>Dynamic generation of tests in nested combinations of contexts</title>
  <description>Test::WriteVariants is a utility to create variants of a common test.

Given the situation - like in DBI where some tests are the same for DBI::SQL::Nano and it's drop-in replacement SQL::Statement. Or a distribution duo having a Pure-Perl and an XS variant - and the same test shall be used to ensure XS and PP version are really drop-in replacements for each other.</description>
