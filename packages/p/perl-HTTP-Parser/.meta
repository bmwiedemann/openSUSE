  <title>Parse HTTP/1.1 request into HTTP::Request/Response object</title>
  <description>This is an HTTP request parser. It takes chunks of text as received and returns a 'hint' as to what is required, or returns the HTTP::Request when a complete request has been read. HTTP/1.1 chunking is supported. It dies if it finds an error.</description>
