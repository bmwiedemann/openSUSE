Fri Mar 19 08:36:26 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Don't skip test_C416_fail_1_list, because it has been fixed in
  python-pytest-flake8dir.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 18 12:59:11 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.4.0:
  - Remove rules C407 (Unnecessary <dict/list> comprehension
    - <builtin> can take a generator) and C412 (Unnecessary
    <dict/list/set> comprehension - 'in' can take a generator).
    Both rules recommended increasing laziness, which is not
    always desirable and can lead to subtle bugs. Also, a fully
    exhausted generator is slower than an equivalent
    comprehension, so the advice did not always improve
    performance.
  - Drop Python 3.5 support.
  - Support Python 3.9.
  - Move license from ISC to MIT License.
  - Partially reverted the change to C408 to make it apply again
    to when dict is called with keyword arguments, e.g. dict(a=1,
    b=2) will be flagged to be rewritten in the literal form
    {"a": 1, "b": 2}
- Skip test test_C416_fail_1_list
  (gh#adamchainz/flake8-comprehensions#313).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 11 18:38:19 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 3.2.3:
  * Made C408 only apply when no arguments are passed to
    dict/list/tuple.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  9 16:53:49 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 3.2.2:
  * Remove check for dict comprehensions in rule C407 as it would also
    change the results for certain builtins such as sum().

- changes from version 3.2.1:
  * Remove check for set comprehensions in rule C407 as it would
    change the results for certain builtins such as sum().

- changes from version 3.2.0:
  * Add filter and map to rule C407.
  * Check for dict and set comprehensions in rules C407 and C412.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  7 17:47:28 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * be more specific in %files section

- update to version 3.1.4:
  * Remove the tuple/unpacking check from C416 to prevent false
    positives where the type of the iterable is changed from some
    iterable to a tuple.

- changes from version 3.1.3:
  * Ensure the fix for false positives in C416 rule for asynchronous
    comprehensions runs on Python 3.6 too.

- changes from version 3.1.2:
  * Fix false positives in C416 rule for list comprehensions returning
    tuples.

- changes from version 3.1.1:
  * Fix false positives in C416 rule for asynchronous comprehensions.

- changes from version 3.1.0:
  * Update Python support to 3.5-3.8.
  * Fix false positives for C404 for list comprehensions not directly
    creating tuples.
  * Add C413 rule that checks for unnecessary use of list() or
    reversed() around sorted().
  * Add C414 rule that checks for unnecessary use of the following:
    + list(), reversed(), sorted(), or tuple() within set or sorted()
    + list() or tuple() within list() or tuple()
    + set() within set
  * Add C415 rule that checks for unnecessary reversal of an iterable
    via subscript within reversed(), set(), or sorted().
  * Add C416 rule that checks for unnecessary list or set
    comprehensions that can be rewritten using list() or set().

- changes from version 3.0.1:
  * Fix version display on flake8 --version (removing dependency on
    cached-property). Thanks to Jon Dufresne.

- changes from version 3.0.0:
  * Update Flake8 support to 3.0+ only. 3.0.0 was released in 2016 and
    the plugin hasn't been tested with it since.

- changes from version 2.3.0:
  * Converted setuptools metadata to configuration file. This meant
    removing the __version__ attribute from the package. If you want
    to inspect the installed version, use
    importlib.metadata.version("flake8-comprehensions") (docs /
    backport).
  * Add dependencies on cached-property and importlib-metadata.
  * Fix false negatives in C407 for cases when enumerate and sum() are
    passed more than one argument.

Fri Sep 13 07:29:08 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

  * C412 rule that complains about using list comprehension with in.
