- pytest-asyncio was build requirement by pyee's setup.py file, but
  it was only used for tests. On top of that, the python-pytest-asyncio
  package is only available for python3, so now we only do tests on
  python3 and a patch was added to fix the requirements:
  * fix-build-requirements.patch

- Since the tests require at least python 3.5, only run the tests when
  suse_version >= 1500

- Update to version 5.0.0
  * CHANGELOG.md reformatted to CHANGELOG.rst
  * Added CONTRIBUTORS.rst
  * The listeners method no longer returns the raw list of listeners, and
    instead returns a list of unwrapped listeners; This means that mutating
    listeners on the EventEmitter by mutating the list returned by this method
    isn't possible anymore, and that for once handlers this method returns the
    unwrapped handler rather than the wrapped handler
  * once API now returns the unwrapped handler in both decorator and
    non-decorator cases
  * Possible to remove once handlers with unwrapped handlers
  * Internally, listeners are now stored on a OrderedDict rather than a list
  * Minor stylistic tweaks to make code more pythonic

- Update to version 4.0.1
  * Fix bug in setup.py; Now publishable

- Update to version 4.0.0
  * Coroutines now work with .once Wrapped listener is removed prior to hook
  * execution rather than after for synchronous .once handlers
- Add LICENSE file from upstream
