  <title>Series of charting modules</title>
  <description>These manpages give you the most important information about Chart. There
is also a complete documentation (Documentation.pdf) within the Chart
package. Look at it to get more information. This module is an attempt to
build a general purpose graphing module that is easily modified and
expanded. I borrowed most of the API from Martien Verbruggen's GIFgraph
module. I liked most of GIFgraph, but I thought it was to difficult to
modify, and it was missing a few things that I needed, most notably
legends. So I decided to write a new module from scratch, and I've designed
it from the bottom up to be easy to modify. Like GIFgraph, Chart uses
Lincoln Stein's GD module for all of its graphics primitives calls.</description>
