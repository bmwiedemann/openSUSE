- Update to version 6.0.1
  * Robot Framework 6.0.1 is the first bug fix release in the RF 6.0 series.
    It mainly fixes a bug in using localized BDD prefixes consisting of more than one word (#4515) as well as a regression
    related to the library search order (#4516).
    Questions and comments related to the release can be sent to the robotframework-users mailing list or to Robot Framework Slack,
    and possible bugs submitted to the issue tracker.
    If you have pip installed, just run
      pip install --pre --upgrade robotframework
    to install the latest available release or use
      pip install robotframework==6.0.1
    to install exactly this version. Alternatively you can download the source distribution from PyPI and install it manually.
    For more details and other installation approaches, see the installation instructions.
    Robot Framework 6.0.1 was released on Thursday November 3, 2022.
