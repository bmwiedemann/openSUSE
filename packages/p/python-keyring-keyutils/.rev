    <comment>Hi,
I would like to maintain the python-keyring-keyutils [1] package in factory.

Very brief summary of the package (high-level POV):
- a python-keyring backend for the kernel keyring
- a special python-keyring backend that can be used by osc (so that osc
  stores the user's credentials in the kernel keyring)

A more detailed announcement can be found on the factory ml [2].
