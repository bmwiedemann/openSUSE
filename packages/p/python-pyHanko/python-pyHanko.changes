- update to 0.26.0:
  * Some outdated algos for encrypting the security handler seed
    in a public-key encrypted PDF were dropped to get rid of
    oscrypto as a direct dependency of pyhanko. It is still
    pulled in via pyhanko-certvalidator, but it is no longer used
    for any cryptographic operations (which is significant,
    because of compatibility issues on systems that no longer
    ship OpenSSL 1.1.1)
  * Relax uharfbuzz upper bound to <0.47.0.
  * Make defusedxml a regular dependency
  * Expose signature_mechanism parameter in PKCS#11 API.
