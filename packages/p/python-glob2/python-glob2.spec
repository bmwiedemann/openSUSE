%description
This module provides an extended version of Python's builtin glob
module with the following additions:

- The ability to capture the text matched by glob patterns, and
  return those matches alongside the filenames.
- A recursive '**' globbing syntax, akin for example to the globstar
  option of the bash shell.
- The ability to replace the filesystem functions used, in order to
  glob on virtual filesystems.
