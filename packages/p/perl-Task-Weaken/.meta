  <title>Task::Weaken - Ensure that a platform has weaken support</title>
  <description>One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's &quot;weaken&quot;
function is that it is not present in the pure-perl variant.

While this isn't necesarily always a problem in a straight CPAN-based
Perl environment, some operating system distributions only include the
pure-Perl versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken is then
&quot;missing&quot; from the platform, despite passing a dependency on
Scalar::Util successfully.</description>
