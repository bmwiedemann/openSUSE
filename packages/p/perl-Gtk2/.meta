  <title>Perl interface to the 2.x series of the Gimp Toolkit library</title>
  <description>Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ widget set.  This module
allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management
in C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.</description>
