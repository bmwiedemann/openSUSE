  <title>Base class for error handling</title>
  <description>Class::ErrorHandler provides an error-handling mechanism that's generic enough
to be used as the base class for a variety of OO classes. Subclasses inherit
its two error-handling methods, error and errstr, to communicate error messages
back to the calling program.</description>
