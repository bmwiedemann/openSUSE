  <title>Low-level allocate a pseudo-Tty, import constants.</title>
  <description>'IO::Tty' is used internally by 'IO::Pty' to create a pseudo-tty. You
wouldn't want to use it directly except to import constants, use 'IO::Pty'.
For a list of importable constants, see the IO::Tty::Constant manpage.

Windows is now supported, but ONLY under the Cygwin environment, see the
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/ manpage.

Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend. From my experience,
any modern POSIX system should be fine. Find below a list of systems that
'IO::Tty' should work on. A more detailed table (which is slowly getting
out-of-date) is available from the project pages document manager at
SourceForge the http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/ manpage.

If you have problems on your system and your system is listed in the
&quot;verified&quot; list, you probably have some non-standard setup, e.g. you
compiled your Linux-kernel yourself and disabled ptys (bummer!). Please ask
your friendly sysadmin for help.

If your system is not listed, unpack the latest version of 'IO::Tty', do a
''perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; uname -a'' and send me
(_RGiersig@cpan.org_) the results and I'll see what I can deduce from that.
There are chances that it will work right out-of-the-box...

If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with details
(version number, distribution, etc. 'uname -a' and 'perl -V' is a good
start; also, the output from &quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot; contains a lot of
interesting info, so please include that as well) so I can get an overview.
Thanks!</description>
