  <title>Implements the Precision Time protocol as defined by IEEE 1588 standard</title>
  <description>The PTP daemon (PTPd) implements the Precision Time protocol (PTP) as
defined by the IEEE 1588 standard. PTP was developed to provide very
precise time coordination of LAN connected computers.

PTPd is a complete implementation of the IEEE 1588 specification for a
standard (non-boundary) clock. PTPd has been tested with and is known
to work properly with other IEEE 1588 implementations. The source code
for PTPd is freely available under a BSD-style license. Thanks to
contributions from users, PTPd is becoming an increasingly portable,
interoperable, and stable IEEE 1588 implementation.

PTPd can run on most 32-bit little- or big-endian processors. It does
not require an FPU, so it is great for embedded processors. PTPd
currently runs on Linux, uClinux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD. It should also
be easy to port to other platforms.

PTPd is free. Everyone is invited to use and contribute to PTPd.</description>
