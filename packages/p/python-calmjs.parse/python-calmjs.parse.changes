Mon Jun 16 06:12:16 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Switch to pyroject macros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  3 14:57:11 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.3
  * Revert the usage of ``lru_cache`` as that isn't being hit as expected,
    and that the benefits it brings is too negligible to bring back given
    the extremely limited cache hits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 22 13:58:56 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.2:
  * Ensure building from source tree under Python 3.13 works.
  * Dropped support for building under Python 2 in source tree. [
    #44 ]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 10 11:43:35 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.1:
  * Modified existing ``setup.py`` hook from an install hook to a
    build hook to ensure the generated module files are present.
    Should any of those modules are missing and the required
    dependencies for are not present (i.e. ``ply`` and
    ``setuptools``), the build will result in a
    non-zero exit status and the documented error message should
    reflect which of the required dependencies are missing.

Fri Jun 23 08:05:31 UTC 2023 - Andreas Schneider <asn@cryptomilk.org>

- Use sle15_python_module_pythons

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 17 17:52:41 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Generated tables should get correct *.pyc files
- And no, this won't work with Python 2 modules. Just don't even
  try.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 16 15:28:20 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.0:
  - Introduce the extractor unparser - an unparser that will
    unparse a valid AST into a dict.
  - Correct the JoinAttr ruletype such that the intended empty
    definition value is passed to walk if it was defined as such
    to avoid an unintended infinite recursion.
  - Will now import Iterable from the Python 3.3+ location as the
    previous location is marked for removal in Python 3.9. The import
    will still have a fallback to the previous location in order to
    maintain support for Python 2.7.
  - Provide a test case helper to ensure that the generic Program repr
    signature is provided to assist with test case portability.
  - In the calmjs.parse.vlq module, implemented the decode_vlq helper
    for completeness/symmetry to the encode_vlq helper.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 30 09:24:12 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.2.4
  * Correct usage of ``__doc__`` to support level 2 optimized mode.
  * Corrected some minor string definition syntax, where raw string prefix
    should be used but was not previously.
  * Correctly include LICENSE file in sdist.
  * Include the correct test data general form for some previously added
    test cases to better accommodate already planned future features.
