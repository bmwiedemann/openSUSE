- Generated tables should get correct *.pyc files
- And no, this won't work with Python 2 modules. Just don't even
  try.

Tue Nov 16 15:28:20 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.0:
  - Introduce the extractor unparser - an unparser that will
    unparse a valid AST into a dict.
  - Correct the JoinAttr ruletype such that the intended empty
    definition value is passed to walk if it was defined as such
    to avoid an unintended infinite recursion.
  - Will now import Iterable from the Python 3.3+ location as the
    previous location is marked for removal in Python 3.9. The import
    will still have a fallback to the previous location in order to
    maintain support for Python 2.7.
  - Provide a test case helper to ensure that the generic Program repr
    signature is provided to assist with test case portability.
  - In the calmjs.parse.vlq module, implemented the decode_vlq helper
    for completeness/symmetry to the encode_vlq helper.

- Update to 1.2.4
  * Correct usage of ``__doc__`` to support level 2 optimized mode.
  * Corrected some minor string definition syntax, where raw string prefix
    should be used but was not previously.
  * Correctly include LICENSE file in sdist.
  * Include the correct test data general form for some previously added
    test cases to better accommodate already planned future features.
