  <title>Low-Level Interface to bzip2 compression library</title>
  <description>'Compress::Raw::Bzip2' provides an interface to the in-memory
compression/uncompression functions from the bzip2 compression library.

Although the primary purpose for the existence of 'Compress::Raw::Bzip2' is
for use by the 'IO::Compress::Bzip2' and 'IO::Compress::Bunzip2' modules,
it can be used on its own for simple compression/uncompression tasks.
