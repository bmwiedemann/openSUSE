  <title>Interactive SNMP tool</title>
  <description>Snimpy is a Python-based tool providing a simple interface to build
SNMP query. You can either use Snimpy interactively through its console
(derived from Python own console or from IPython_ if available) or write
Snimpy scripts which are just Python scripts with some global variables
available.

Snimpy is aimed at being the more Pythonic possible. You should forget
that you are doing SNMP requests. Snimpy will rely on MIB to hide SNMP
details. Here are some &quot;features&quot;:

 * MIB parser based on libsmi  (through CFFI)
 * SNMP requests are handled by PySNMP (SNMPv1, SNMPv2 and SNMPv3
   support)
 * scalars are just attributes of your session object
 * columns are like a Python dictionary and made available as an
   attribute
 * getting an attribute is like issuing a GET method
 * setting an attribute is like issuing a SET method
 * iterating over a table is like using GETNEXT
 * when something goes wrong, you get an exception
