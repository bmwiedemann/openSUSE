- Version bump to 1.2.0
  * Allow `oscrypto.use_ctypes()`, `oscrypto.use_openssl()` and
    `oscrypto.use_winlegacy()` to be called after initialization
    as long as the configuration does not change

- Changes from 1.1.1
  * Use versioned libcrypto.dylib and libssl.dylib on macOS
    Catalina to prevent segfaults
  * Fix warnings reported when using with cffi 1.13.2

- Changes from 1.1.0
  * Added `oscrypto.load_order()`, which returns a `list` of unicode
    strings of the names of the fully-qualified module names for all
    of submodules of the package. The module names are listed in their
    dependency load order.
    This is primarily intended for the sake of implementing hot reloading.

- Changes from 1.0.0
  * Backwards Compatibility Breaks
    ~ `oscrypto.backend()` will now return `"mac"` instead of
      `"osx"` when running on a Mac and not explicitly configured
      to use OpenSSL
  * Enhancements
    ~ Added functionality to calculate public keys from private keys
      since that was removed from asn1crypto:
       + `asn1crypto.keys.PrivateKeyInfo().unwrap()` is now
         `asymmetric.PrivateKey().unwrap()`
       + `asn1crypto.keys.PrivateKeyInfo().public_key` is now
         `asymmetric.PrivateKey().public_key.unwrap()`
       + `asn1crypto.keys.PrivateKeyInfo().public_key_info` is now
         `asymmetric.PrivateKey().public_key.asn1`
       + `asn1crypto.keys.PrivateKeyInfo().fingerprint` is now
         `asymmetric.PrivateKey().fingerprint`
       + `asn1crypto.keys.PublicKeyInfo().unwrap()` is now
         `asymmetric.PublicKey().unwrap()`
       + `asn1crypto.keys.PublicKeyInfo().fingerprint` is now
         `asymmetric.PublicKey().fingerprint`
    ~ Added `oscrypto.use_ctypes()` to avoid CFFI if desired
    ~ Added `tls.TLSSocket().port` property
    ~ Improved handling of disconnects with `tls.TLSSocket()`
    ~ Improved error messages when dealing with failures originating in OpenSSL
    ~ Allow PEM-encoded files to have leading whitespace when loaded via
      `keys.parse_private()`, `keys.parse_public()` and
      `keys.parse_certificate()`
    ~ Restructured internal imports of asn1crypto to make vendoring easier
    ~ No longer touch the user keychain on Macs when generating keys, instead
      use a temporary one
  * Bug Fixes
    ~Fixed compatibility with Python 3.7+
    ~ Fixed compatibility with LibreSSL version 2.2.x+
    ~ Fixed a bug where `tls.TLSSocket().read_until()` that would sometimes read
      more data from the socket than necessary
    ~ Fixed a buffer overflow when reading data from an OpenSSL memory bio
    ~ Fixed a bug in `util.pbkdf2()` that would cause incorrect output in some
      situations when run on Windows XP or with OpenSSL 0.9.8
    ~ Fixed `aes_cbc_no_padding_encrypt()` so it can be executed when the backend
      is OpenSSL
    ~ A `SecTrustRef` obtained from `SSLCopyPeerTrust()` on Mac is now
      properly released
