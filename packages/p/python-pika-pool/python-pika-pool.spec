%description
Pika connection pooling inspired by:

- `flask-pika <https://github.com/WeatherDecisionTechnologies/flask-pika>`_
- `sqlalchemy.pool.Pool <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/pooling.html#sqlalchemy.pool.Pool>`_

Typically you'll go with local `shovels <https://www.rabbitmq.com/shovel.html>`_, `krazee-eyez kombu <http://bit.ly/1txcnnO>`_, etc. but this works too.
