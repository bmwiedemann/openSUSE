  <title>Provides basic first-pass API testing for large class trees</title>
  <description>For many APIs with large numbers of classes, it can be very useful to be
able to do a quick once-over to make sure that classes, methods, and
inheritance is correct, before doing more comprehensive testing. This
module aims to provide such a capability.</description>
