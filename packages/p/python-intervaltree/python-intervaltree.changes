- update to 3.1.0:
  - Dropped support for Python 3.4, added Python 3.8
  - Add `__slots__` optimization in Node class, should give performance improvement
  - Fixed:
    - Restore universal wheels
    - Bytes/str type incompatibility in setup.py
    - New version of distutils rejects version suffixes of `.postNN`, use `aNN` instead

- Update to Version 3.0.2
  + Fixed:
    * On some systems, setup.py opened README.md with a non-unicode encoding. My fault for leaving the encoding flapping in the breeze. It's been fixed.
- Update to Version 3.0.1
  + Added:
    * Travis testing for 3.7 and 3.8-dev. These needed OpenSSL, sudo and Xenial. 3.8-dev is allowed to fail.
  + Fixed:
    * PyPI wasn't rendering markdown because I didn't tell it what format to use.
    * Python 2 wasn't installing via pip because of a new utils package. It has been zapped.
  + Maintainers:
    * TestPyPI version strings use .postN as the suffix instead of bN, and N counts from the latest tagged commit, which should be the last release
    * Install from TestPyPI works via make install-testpypi
- Update to Version 3.0.0
  + Breaking:
    * search(begin, end, strict) has been replaced with at(point), overlap(begin, end), and envelop(begin, end)
    * extend(items) has been deleted, use update(items) instead
    * Methods that take a strict=True/False argument now consistently default to strict=True
    * Dropped support for Python 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3
    * Add support for Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7
    * Faster Interval overlap checking (@tuxzz, #56)
  + Updated README:
    * new restructuring methods from 2.1.0
    * example of from_tuples() added
    * more info about chop(), split_overlaps(), merge_overlaps() and merge_equals().
  + Fixes:
    * Node.from_tuples() will now raise an error if given an empty iterable. This should never happen, and it should error if it does.
    * Interval.distance_to() gave an incorrect distance when passed the Interval's upper boundary
    * Node.pop_greatest_child() sometimes forgot to rotate() when creating new child nodes. (@escalonn, #41, #42)
    * IntervalTree.begin() and end() are O(1), not O(n). (@ProgVal, #40)
    * intersection_update() and symmetric_difference() and symmetric_difference_update() didn't actually work. Now they do.
    * collections.abc deprecation warning no longer happens
  + Maintainers:
    * PyPi accepts Markdown! Woohoo!
    * reorganize tests
    * more tests added to improve code coverage (We're at 96%! Yay!)
    * test for issue #4 had a broken import reference
