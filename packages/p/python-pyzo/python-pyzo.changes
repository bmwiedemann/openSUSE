- Update to version 4.10.2
  * Fix that PyInstaller's changes to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` leak through to the kernels (#665).
  * We've now automized the building of binaries on Azure Pipelines!
  * Our code is now formatted with Black, and checked with Flake8.
  * CI does not have a lot of tests yet, but we do check linting and importing on Python 3.5 and 3.8.
  * Implemented support for highres displays (although I am unable to verify myself).
  * Improve the workspace display of list, tuple, dict and array.
  * Clean up `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the kernels (#665).
  * Some improvements to asyncio integration.
  * Autocompletion no longer cancels the interactive help.
  * Issue a warning when `logging.basicConfig()` is called (because it does nothing).
  * Fix that non-breakable space was converted (#621, thanks Yann Salmon).
  * Add Jetbrains monospace font.
  * Fix introspection of signature containing kw-only args or annotations.
  * Add polish translation (thanks wojnilowicz)
  * Fix that Pyzo crashes on startup when non-english language is set and status bar is shown.
