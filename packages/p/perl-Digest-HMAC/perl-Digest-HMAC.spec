%description
HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that share a
secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest algorithm,
usually MD5 or SHA-1. The HMAC mechanism is described in RFC 2104.

HMAC follow the common 'Digest::' interface, but the constructor takes the
secret key and the name of some other simple 'Digest::' as argument.

The hmac() and hmac_hex() functions and the Digest::HMAC->new() constructor
takes an optional $blocksize argument as well. The HMAC algorithm assumes
the digester to hash by iterating a basic compression function on blocks of
data and the $blocksize should match the byte-length of such blocks.

The default $blocksize is 64 which is suitable for the MD5 and SHA-1 digest
functions. For stronger algorithms the blocksize probably needs to be
increased.
