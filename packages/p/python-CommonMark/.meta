  <title>Python parser for the CommonMark Markdown spec</title>
  <description>Pure Python port of jgm’s stmd.js, a Markdown parser and renderer for the
CommonMark specification, using only native modules. Once both this project and
the CommonMark specification are stable we will release the first 1.0 version
and attempt to keep up to date with changes in stmd.js.

We are currently at the same development stage (actually a bit ahead because we
have implemented HTML entity conversion and href URL escaping) as stmd.js. Since
Python versions pre-3.4 use outdated (i.e. not HTML5 spec) entity conversion,
I’ve converted the 3.4 implementation into a single file, entitytrans.py which
so far seems to work (all tests pass on 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4).
