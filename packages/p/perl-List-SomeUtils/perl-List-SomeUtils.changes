  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY]
  
  * Fixed a number of bugs in the handling of empty lists. The any_u(), all_u(),
    none_u(), notall_u(), and one_u() functions returned an empty list in list
    context instead of undef. This is in direct opposition to the documentation
    which has always said that it returned undef. Note that the
    List::SomeUtils::XS code had the _correct_ behavior, so most users probably
    have never experienced this bug.
  
  [IMPROVEMENTS]
  
  * Fixed some doc issues. Closes #7.
