- Update to version 1.0.0
  + Minor update improving compatibility and ease of use:
    * Added attribute access for colormap and palette dictionaries
      for convenience (PR #5)
    * Pulled out the subset of colormaps that have readable names
      into the cm_n and palette_n dictionaries to make it simpler
      to use them in GUI widgets selecting colormaps
    * Improved Python2/Python3 compatibility, now supporting Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
  + Minor backwards compatibility issue:
    * Renamed inferno to bmy to avoid confusion with matplotlib.
