%description
Use a decorator to get setuptools entry points that allows others
to use your commandline utility as a home for their related sub-commands.
You get to choose where these sub-commands or sub-groups can be registered
but the plugin developer gets to choose they ARE registered.
You could have all plugins register alongside the core commands,
in a special sub-group, across multiple sub-groups, or some combination.
