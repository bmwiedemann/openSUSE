  <title>An extension for click to register CLI commands via setuptools entry-points</title>
  <description>Use a decorator to get setuptools entry points that allows others to use your commandline utility as a home for their related sub-commands. You get to choose where these sub-commands or sub-groups can be registered but the plugin developer gets to choose they ARE registered. You could have all plugins register alongside the core commands, in a special sub-group, across multiple sub-groups, or some combination.
