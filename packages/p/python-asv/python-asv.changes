- update to 0.6.1:
  * ``pip`` dependencies in ``environment.yml`` files for the
    ``mamba`` plugin are handled correctly (#1326)
  * ``asv.config.json`` matrix requirements no longer need
    ``pip+`` set explicitly for calling the ``pip`` solver for
    ``virtualenv``
  * ``asv`` will now use ``conda_environment_file`` if it exists
    (#1325)
  * ``asv`` timestamps via ``datetime`` are now Python 3.12
    compatible (#1331)
  * ``asv`` now provides ``asv[virtualenv]`` as an installable
    target
  * ``asv`` now uses Github Actions exclusively for Windows and
    Linux

Mon Sep  4 15:54:12 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.6.0:
  * ``asv_runner`` is now used internally, making the addition of
    custom benchmark types viable (#1287)
  * Benchmarks can be skipped, both wholly and in part using new
    decorators ``skip_benchmark_if`` and ``skip_params_if``
  * Benchmarks can be skipped during their execution (after
    setup) by raising ``SkipNotImplemented`` (#1307)
  * Added ``default_benchmark_timeout`` to the configuration
    object, can also be
  * passed via ``-a timeout=NUMBER`` (#1308)
  * ``ASV_RUNNER_PATH`` can be set from the terminal to test
    newer versions of ``asv_runner`` (#1312)
  * Removed ``asv dev`` in favor of using ``asv run`` with the
    right arguments (#1200)
  * ``asv run`` and ``asv continuous`` don't implement the
    ``--strict`` option anymore, and they will always return
    a non-zero (i.e. ``2``) exit status if any benchmark fail.
  * Fixed ``install_timeout`` for ``conda`` (#1310)

Thu Aug  4 08:53:43 UTC 2022 - Otto Hollmann <otto.hollmann@suse.com>

-  Update to 0.5.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    * Packaging requirements-dev.txt file, used in setup.py. (#1013)
- Changes from 0.5:
  * New Features
    * Adding environment variables to build and benchmark commands. (#809, #833)
    * Added --strict option to asv run to set exit code on failure. (#865)
    * Added --no-stats option to asv compare and asv continuous. (#879)
    * Added --durations option to asv run and asv show for displaying benchmark
      run durations. (#838)
    * Added --date-period option to asv run for running benchmarks for commits
      separated by a constant time interval. (#835)
    * Web UI button to group regressions by benchmark. (#869)
    * Space-saving v2 file format for storing results. (#847)
    * timeraw_* benchmarks for measuring e.g. import times. (#832)
    * Support for using conda environment files for env setup. (#793)
  * API Changes
    * Results file format change requires asv update to update old data to v2
      format.
    * The configuration syntax for "matrix", "exclude", and "include" in
      asv.conf.json has changed. The old syntax is still supported, unless you
      are installing packages named req, env, env_nobuild.
  * Bug Fixes
    * When an asv find step fails due to timeout, assume runtime equal to
      timeout to allow bisection to proceed (#768)
    * Minor fixes and improvements (#897, #896, #888, #881, #877, #876, #875,
      #861, #870, #868, #867, #866, #864, #863, #857, #786, #854, #855, #852,
      #850, #844, #843, #842, #839, #841, #840, #837, #836, #834, #831, #830,
      #829, #828, #826, #825, #824)
  * Other Changes and Additions
    * Uniqueness of repr() for param objects is now guaranteed by suffixing
      unique identifier corresponding to order of appearance. (#771)
    * Memory addresses are now stripped from the repr() of param elements,
      allowing comparison across multiple runs. (#771)
    * asv dev is now equivalent to asv run with --python=same default. (#874)
    * asv continuous by default now records measurement samples, for better
      comparison statistics. (#878)
    * ASV now uses PEP 518 pyproject.toml in packaging. (#853)
