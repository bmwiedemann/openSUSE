Tue Oct 15 12:55:21 UTC 2024 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.4
  * ASV supports using JSONC as a configuration file (#1420)
  * Update deprecation for latest conda versions (#1403)
  * Fix runs for profiles commit results (#1404)
  * Internal pip parser now works for git URLs with branches and tags (#1431)
  * ``asv`` defaults to ``--force-reinstall`` now to facilitate ``compare`` and
    ``continuous`` for manually versioned projects (#1421)
- Drop removal of benchmark, docs and test directories from %install section
- Update Requires from pyproject.toml
- Use Python 3.11 on SLE-15 by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 27 12:57:50 UTC 2024 - Dirk M端ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.6.3:
  * build is now the default backend for asv to install projects.
  * Partially skipped benchmarks will still have their results
    displayed.
  * asv will now correctly prepare all the build backend
    dependencies into base_requirements and the default
    build_command has been modified to allow fetching from PyPI.
  * The asv package no longer prepends the script execution
    directory unconditionally. Now we check for and remove the
    path only if it matches the directory that the runner script
    resides in.
  * The bdist wheels no longer include benchmarks and test.
  * The mamba plugin works correctly for newer versions (>=1.5)
    of libmambapy
  * The mamba plugin respects the MAMBARC environment if set,
    taking channels and channel priority from the file in the
    environment variable.
  * Fixed a bug where matrix requirements were dropped if an
    environment file was specified.
  * conda-forge is no longer a default channel for mamba.
  * asv now depends on virtualenv

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  2 07:17:02 UTC 2023 - Dirk M端ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.6.1:
  * ``pip`` dependencies in ``environment.yml`` files for the
    ``mamba`` plugin are handled correctly (#1326)
  * ``asv.config.json`` matrix requirements no longer need
    ``pip+`` set explicitly for calling the ``pip`` solver for
    ``virtualenv``
  * ``asv`` will now use ``conda_environment_file`` if it exists
    (#1325)
  * ``asv`` timestamps via ``datetime`` are now Python 3.12
    compatible (#1331)
  * ``asv`` now provides ``asv[virtualenv]`` as an installable
    target
  * ``asv`` now uses Github Actions exclusively for Windows and
    Linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  4 15:54:12 UTC 2023 - Dirk M端ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.6.0:
  * ``asv_runner`` is now used internally, making the addition of
    custom benchmark types viable (#1287)
  * Benchmarks can be skipped, both wholly and in part using new
    decorators ``skip_benchmark_if`` and ``skip_params_if``
  * Benchmarks can be skipped during their execution (after
    setup) by raising ``SkipNotImplemented`` (#1307)
  * Added ``default_benchmark_timeout`` to the configuration
    object, can also be
  * passed via ``-a timeout=NUMBER`` (#1308)
  * ``ASV_RUNNER_PATH`` can be set from the terminal to test
    newer versions of ``asv_runner`` (#1312)
  * Removed ``asv dev`` in favor of using ``asv run`` with the
    right arguments (#1200)
  * ``asv run`` and ``asv continuous`` don't implement the
    ``--strict`` option anymore, and they will always return
    a non-zero (i.e. ``2``) exit status if any benchmark fail.
  * Fixed ``install_timeout`` for ``conda`` (#1310)

Thu Aug  4 08:53:43 UTC 2022 - Otto Hollmann <otto.hollmann@suse.com>

-  Update to 0.5.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    * Packaging requirements-dev.txt file, used in setup.py. (#1013)
- Changes from 0.5:
  * New Features
    * Adding environment variables to build and benchmark commands. (#809, #833)
    * Added --strict option to asv run to set exit code on failure. (#865)
    * Added --no-stats option to asv compare and asv continuous. (#879)
    * Added --durations option to asv run and asv show for displaying benchmark
      run durations. (#838)
    * Added --date-period option to asv run for running benchmarks for commits
      separated by a constant time interval. (#835)
    * Web UI button to group regressions by benchmark. (#869)
    * Space-saving v2 file format for storing results. (#847)
    * timeraw_* benchmarks for measuring e.g. import times. (#832)
    * Support for using conda environment files for env setup. (#793)
  * API Changes
    * Results file format change requires asv update to update old data to v2
      format.
    * The configuration syntax for "matrix", "exclude", and "include" in
      asv.conf.json has changed. The old syntax is still supported, unless you
      are installing packages named req, env, env_nobuild.
  * Bug Fixes
    * When an asv find step fails due to timeout, assume runtime equal to
      timeout to allow bisection to proceed (#768)
    * Minor fixes and improvements (#897, #896, #888, #881, #877, #876, #875,
      #861, #870, #868, #867, #866, #864, #863, #857, #786, #854, #855, #852,
      #850, #844, #843, #842, #839, #841, #840, #837, #836, #834, #831, #830,
      #829, #828, #826, #825, #824)
  * Other Changes and Additions
    * Uniqueness of repr() for param objects is now guaranteed by suffixing
      unique identifier corresponding to order of appearance. (#771)
    * Memory addresses are now stripped from the repr() of param elements,
      allowing comparison across multiple runs. (#771)
    * asv dev is now equivalent to asv run with --python=same default. (#874)
    * asv continuous by default now records measurement samples, for better
      comparison statistics. (#878)
    * ASV now uses PEP 518 pyproject.toml in packaging. (#853)
