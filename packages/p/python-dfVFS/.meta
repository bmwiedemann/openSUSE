  <title>Digital Forensics Virtual File System</title>
  <description>dfVFS, or Digital Forensics Virtual File System, provides read-only access to file-system objects from various storage media types and file formats. The goal of dfVFS is to provide a generic interface for accessing file-system objects, for which it uses several back-ends that provide the actual implementation of the various storage media types, volume systems and file systems.

dfVFS originates from the Plaso project and is also based on ideas from the GRR project. It was largely rewritten and made into a stand-alone project to provide more flexibility and allow other projects to make use of the VFS functionality. dfVFS originally was named PyVFS, but that name conflicted with another project.

dfVFS is currently implemented as a Python module.</description>
