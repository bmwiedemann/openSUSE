%description
This module implements so-called "guards". A guard is something (usually an
object) that "guards" a resource, ensuring that it is cleaned up when
expected.

Specifically, this module supports two different types of guards: guard
objects, which execute a given code block when destroyed, and scoped
guards, which are tied to the scope exit.
