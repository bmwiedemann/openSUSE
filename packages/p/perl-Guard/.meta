  <title>Guards for Perl</title>
  <description>This module implements so-called &quot;guards&quot;. A guard is something (usually
an object) that &quot;guards&quot; a resource, ensuring that it is cleaned up when
expected.

Specifically, this module supports two different types of guards: guard
objects, which execute a given code block when destroyed, and scoped
guards, which are tied to the scope exit.
