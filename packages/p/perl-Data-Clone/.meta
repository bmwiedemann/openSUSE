  <title>Polymorphic data cloning</title>
  <description>&quot;Data::Clone&quot; does data cloning, i.e. copies things recursively. This is
smart so that it works with not only non-blessed references, but also with
blessed references (i.e. objects). When &quot;clone()&quot; finds an object, it
calls a &quot;clone&quot; method of the object if the object has a &quot;clone&quot;,
otherwise it makes a surface copy of the object. That is, this module does
polymorphic data cloning.
Although there are several modules on CPAN which can clone data, this
module has a different cloning policy from almost all of them. See
&quot;Cloning policy&quot; and &quot;Comparison to other cloning modules&quot; for details.
