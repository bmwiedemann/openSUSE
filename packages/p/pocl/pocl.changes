-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  4 14:33:49 UTC 2022 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Use LLVM 13 on Tumbleweed, since LLVM 14 does not yet work

- Remove upstreamed fix_resources_path_version_dependency.patch
- Fix build with single-component libclang-cpp.so, add
  link_against_libclang-cpp_so.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 28 19:15:03 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Use GCC (default host compiler) for compiling the library itself,
  and only compile the openCL kernel bytecode with clang, which is the
  upstream default setup. This also fixes problems where clang chokes
  on the GCC LTO options.
- Drop unused boost_headers, glew, ncurses and uthash devel BuildRequires.
- Remove unneeded extra linker flags.
- Fix build on ARM, and enable Arch64 (needs explicit CPU specification),
  supported since pocl 1.1.
- Fix failing header lookup when minor libclang version changes
  (https://github.com/pocl/pocl/issues/747), add
  fix_resources_path_version_dependency.patch
- Require implementation (libpocl2) from the main package which
  contains the ICD referencing it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  5 19:56:21 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Adjust required clang version (clang < 9) since clang 8 is now
  supported by upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 19:21:26 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.3
  * Support for Clang/LLVM 8.0.
  Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed kernel debug symbol generation.
  * HSA: fix kernel caching.
  * Fix clCreateImage doesn't fail with unsupported image type.
  * Fix handle non-kernel functions with barriers properly.
  * Fix Unable to build pocl with CUDA support with LLVM 7 and host
    GCC 8.2.
  * Fix image format/size handling with multiple devices in context.
  * Fix padding issue with context arrays that manifested as unaligned
    access errors after autovectorization.
  Notable Internal Changes
  * Add group ids as hidden kernel arguments instead of digging
    them up from the context struct.
  * Ability to generate the final binary via separate assembly text +
    assembler call. Useful for supporting LLVM targets without direct
    binary emission support.
  * Use Clang's Driver API for launching the final linkage step. This
    way we utilize the toolchain registry with correct linkage steps
    required for the target at hand.
  * Add 'device_aux_functions' to the driver layer attributes. This
    can be used to retain device-specific functions required by the
    target across the pruning of unused globals.
  * The "default kernels" hack which was used to store kernel metadata,
    has been removed. Kernel metadata are now stored only once, in
    cl_program struct; every new cl_kernel structs holds only a pointer.
  * Major 'pthread' CPU driver cleanup.
  * Major Workgroup.cc cleanup.
- Remove reproducible.patch (fixed upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 31 12:13:35 UTC 2018 - Bernhard Wiedemann <bwiedemann@suse.com>

Mon Jul 30 04:53:06 UTC 2018 - bwiedemann@suse.com

  instead always asume core2 (boo#1100677)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 15 20:34:02 UTC 2018 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- move nonversioned lib to main package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  9 17:17:10 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.1
  * Support for LLVM/Clang 6.0 and 5.0.
  * Experimental SPIR and SPIR-V support
  * Improved kernel compilation speed

Wed Jan 31 14:51:17 UTC 2018 - msrb@suse.com

- Remove dependency on clang-devel-static. (bnc#1065464)
  * It was removed, clang-devel now again provides everything
    necessary as shared libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 19 18:44:43 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.0
  Highlights
  * Improved automatic local work-group sizing on kernel enqueue, taking
    into account standard constraints, SIMD width for vectorization as
    well as the number of compute units available on the device.
  * Support for NVIDIA GPUs via a new CUDA backend (currently experimental).
  * Removed support for BBVectorizer.
  * LLVM 5.0 is now supported.
  * A few build options have been added for distribution builds,
    see README.packaging.
  * Somewhat improved scalability in the CPU driver. CPUs with many cores
    and programs using a lot of WIs with small kernels can run somewhat faster.
  * Full conformance with OpenCL 1.2 standard, enabled by default. There are
    some caveats though - see the documentation.
  * When conformance is enabled, some kernel library functions might be
    slower than in previous releases.
  * Pocl now reports OpenCL 1.2 instead of 2.0, except HSA enabled builds.
  * Updated format of pocl binaries, which is NOT backwards compatible.
  * You'll need to clean any kernel caches.
  * Fixed several memory leaks.
  * Unresolved symbols (missing/misspelled functions etc) in a kernel will
    result in error in clBuildProgram() instead of pocl silently ignoring
    them and then aborting at dlopen().
  * New env variable POCL_MEMORY_LIMIT=N limits the Global memory size
    reported by pocl to N gigabytes.
  * New env variable POCL_AFFINITY (defaults to 0): if enabled, sets
    the affinity of each CPU driver pthread to a single core.
  * Improved AVX512 support (with LLVM 5.0). Note that even with LLVM 5.0
    there are still a few bugs (see pocl issue #555); AVX512 + LLVM 4.0 are
    a lot more broken, and probably not worth trying.
  * POCL_DEBUG env var has been revamped. You can now limit debuginfo to
    these categories (or their combination): all,error,warning,general
    memory,llvm,events,cache,locking,refcounts,timing,hsa,tce,cuda
  * The old setting POCL_DEBUG=1 now equals error+warning+general.
- Remove patch:
  * pocl-disable-tests.diff
- Disable CUDA backend since it depends on CUDA_TOOLKIT which is
  not available in Factory

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 26 14:13:18 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

    was not possible anyways
