  <title>TAP Formatter for GitHub Actions</title>
  <description>TAP::Formatter::GitHubActions provides GitHub-Actions-compatible output for prove.

It parses TAP output and tries it's best to guess where errors are located. For more accurate results, use in cojunction with Test2::Formatter::YAMLEnhancedTAP.

Test2::Formatter::YAMLEnhancedTAP enriches the TAP output generated by Test2 and friends (Test::More, Test::Most) with an additional context in YAML format (compliant with TAP version 13) that includes the precise location of the failure.</description>
