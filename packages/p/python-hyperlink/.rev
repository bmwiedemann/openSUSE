    <comment>- Add missing runtime dependency on idna

- version update to 19.0.0
  * When passed to `str()` URLs now stringify to usable URL
    strings. (See #49)
  * Switched off of Python's built-in IDNA facilities to using the
    [idna](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/idna) package. Not only is it
    much more modern, it's also much more strict and correct in its
    output. (See #19 and #56)
  * Added new `DecodedURL` type with almost-identical API to the normal
    `URL`, except that it automatically handles reserved characters in
    argument values passed to its methods. (See #6, #11, #44)
  * Added top-level `parse()` convenience function that now represents
    the main entrypoint to hyperlink.
  * Accept dictionaries as ‘query=’ arguments, in addition to
    sequences of tuples (see #50)
  * `URL.child()` will no longer fail when child gets no segments (#42 and #43)
  * `URL.normalize()` now supports encoding stray/unmatched `%` characters
    in character-encoded fields (userinfo, path, query string, fragment)
    (see #61, #62)</comment>

    <comment>- update to 20.0.1:
  * CPython 3.7 and 3.8 and PyPy3 added to test matrix
  * Hyperlink now has type hints and they are now exported per
  [PEP 561](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/).
  * Several bugs related to hidden state were fixed, making it so that all data
  on a `URL` object (including `rooted` and `uses_netloc`) is reflected by and
  consistent with its textual representation.
  This does mean that sometimes these constructor arguments are ignored, if it
  would create invalid or unparseable URL text.</comment>
