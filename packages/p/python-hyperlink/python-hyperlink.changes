- Add missing runtime dependency on idna

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 21 10:25:35 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 19.0.0
  * When passed to `str()` URLs now stringify to usable URL
    strings. (See #49)
  * Switched off of Python's built-in IDNA facilities to using the
    [idna](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/idna) package. Not only is it
    much more modern, it's also much more strict and correct in its
    output. (See #19 and #56)
  * Added new `DecodedURL` type with almost-identical API to the normal
    `URL`, except that it automatically handles reserved characters in
    argument values passed to its methods. (See #6, #11, #44)
  * Added top-level `parse()` convenience function that now represents
    the main entrypoint to hyperlink.
  * Accept dictionaries as ‘query=’ arguments, in addition to
    sequences of tuples (see #50)
  * `URL.child()` will no longer fail when child gets no segments (#42 and #43)
  * `URL.normalize()` now supports encoding stray/unmatched `%` characters
    in character-encoded fields (userinfo, path, query string, fragment)
    (see #61, #62)
