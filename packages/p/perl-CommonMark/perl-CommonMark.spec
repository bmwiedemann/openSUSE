%description
This module is a wrapper around the official CommonMark C library at
https://github.com/commonmark/cmark/. It closely follows the original API.

The main module provides some entry points to parse documents and
convenience functions for node creation. The bulk of features is available
through CommonMark::Node objects of which the parse tree is made.
CommonMark::Iterator is a useful class to walk through the nodes in a tree.
CommonMark::Parser provides a push parser interface.
