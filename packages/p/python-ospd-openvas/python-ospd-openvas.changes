  * Add support for alive test settings.
  * Add missing scan preferences expand_vhosts and
    test_empty_vhost.
  * Set reverse lookup options.
  * Check if the amount of vts in redis is coherent.
  * Add support for test_alive_hosts_only feature of openvas.
  * Use lock file during feed update to avoid corrupted cache.
  * Add details parameter to get_vt_iterator().
  * Add pontos as dev dependency for managing the version
    information in ospd-openvas.
  * Pass store directory to OSPDaemon init.

  * Add element to OSPD_PARAMS entries to indicate visibility
    for client.
