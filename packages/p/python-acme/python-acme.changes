-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  9 13:21:24 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.9.0:
  * Support for Python 3.12 was added.
  * Updates `joinpath` syntax to only use one addition per call,
    because the multiple inputs version was causing mypy errors
    on Python 3.10.
  * Makes the `reconfigure` verb actually use the staging server
    for the dry run to check the new configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Do not call deprecated datetime.utcnow() and datetime.utcfromtimestamp()
  * Support for Python 3.7 was deprecated and will be removed in our next planned release.

    renewal causing problems in setups where the user had multiple accounts with
    the same ACME server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  7 15:12:51 UTC 2023 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.6.0
  * Support for Python 3.11 was added to Certbot and all of its components
  * acme.challenges.HTTP01Response.simple_verify now accepts a timeout argument
    which defaults to 30 that causes the verification request to timeout after
    that many seconds.
  * The default key type for new certificates is now ECDSA secp256r1 (P-256).
    It was previously RSA 2048-bit. Existing certificates are not affected.
  * acme and Certbot no longer support versions of ACME from before the RFC 8555 standard.
  * acme and Certbot no longer support the old urn:acme:error: ACME error prefix.
  * many acme classes have been removed
  * acme.messages.Directory now only supports lookups by the exact resource name
    string in the ACME directory
  * Removed the deprecated source_address argument for acme.client.ClientNetwork.
  * Certbot will no longer respect very long challenge polling intervals, which
    may be suggested by some ACME servers. Certbot will continue to wait up to
    90 seconds by default, or up to a total of 30 minutes if requested by the server
    via Retry-After.
  * certbot show_account now displays the ACME Account Thumbprint.
  * acme.messages.OrderResource now supports being round-tripped through JSON
  * acme.client.ClientV2 now provides separate begin_finalization and poll_finalization
    methods, in addition to the existing finalize_order method.
  * Packaged tests for all Certbot components besides josepy were moved inside the _internal/tests module.
- Drop the signature (last was acme-1.31.0.tar.gz.asc) and python-acme.keyring
  * PyPI currently hides the signatures and plans to drop support
  * https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/9707

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  4 16:37:19 UTC 2022 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to 1.31.0
  * sync with the main certbot package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 21 17:49:37 UTC 2022 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.30.0
  * acme.client.ClientBase, acme.messages.Authorization.resolved_combinations,
    acme.messages.Authorization.combinations, acme.mixins, acme.fields.resource
    and acme.fields.Resource are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  * acme.messages.OLD_ERROR_PREFIX (urn:acme:error:) is deprecated and support
    for the old ACME error prefix in Certbot will be removed in the next major
    release of Certbot.
  * acme.messages.Directory.register is deprecated and will be removed in the
    next major release of Certbot. Furthermore, .Directory will only support
    lookups by the exact resource name string in the ACME directory (e.g.
    directory['newOrder']).
  * The source_address argument for acme.client.ClientNetwork is deprecated and
    support for it will be removed in the next major release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 11 13:07:42 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.29.0:
  * --allow-subset-of-names will now additionally retry in cases where domains
    are rejected while creating or finalizing orders. This requires subproblem
    support from the ACME server
  * The show_account subcommand now uses the "newAccount" ACME endpoint to
    fetch the account data, so it doesn't rely on the locally stored account URL.
    This fixes situations where Certbot
    would use old ACMEv1 registration info with non-functional account URLs.
  * The generated Certificate Signing Requests are now generated as version 1
    instead of version 3. This resolves situations in where strict enforcement
    of PKCS#10 meant that CSRs that were generated as version 3 were rejected

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 24 19:25:33 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.28.0:

  * Added support for RFC8555 subproblems to our acme library.
  * The PGP key F2871B4152AE13C49519111F447BF683AA3B26C3 was added
    as an additional trusted key to sign our PyPI packages
- Refreshed python-acme.keyring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  7 15:33:21 UTC 2022 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.26.0
  * Added show_account subcommand, which will fetch the account information from
    the ACME server and show the account details (account URL and, if applicable,
    email address or addresses)
  * The acme library now requires requests>=2.20.0.
  * Certbot and its acme library now require pytz>=2019.3.
  * Certbot and its acme module now depend on josepy>=1.13.0 due to better type annotation support.
  * Previously, when Certbot was in the process of registering a new ACME account
    and the ACME server did not present any Terms of Service, the user was asked
    to agree with a non-existent Terms of Service ("None"). This bug is now fixed,
    so that if an ACME server does not provide any Terms of Service to agree with,
    the user is not asked to agree to a non-existent Terms of Service any longer.
  * If account registration fails, Certbot did not relay the error from the ACME
    server back to the user. This is now fixed: the error message from the ACME
    server is now presented to the user when account registration fails.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    IP addresses.

    the acme library now assumes all server responses are UTF-8
    encoded which is required by RFC 8555.

  * The acme library no longer depends on the security extras from
    requests which was needed to support SNI in TLS requests when
    using old versions of Python 2.
  * When revoking a certificate by --cert-name, it is no longer
    necessary to specify the --server if the certificate was
    obtained from a non-default ACME server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  8 10:19:34 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- update to version 1.6.0
  * Support for alternative certificate chains in the acme module.
  * Added --preferred-chain <issuer CN>. If a CA offers multiple
    certificate chains, it may be used to indicate to Certbot which
    chain should be preferred.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 11 12:06:37 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

    request as a GET request when the targeted ACME CA server seems to not support
    POST-as-GET requests.
  * Support for Python 3.4 in Certbot and its ACME library is deprecated and will be

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:17:42 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 0.32.0
  * Certbot and its acme module now depend on josepy>=1.1.0.
  * An ACME CA server may return a "Retry-After" HTTP header on
    authorization polling, as specified in the ACME protocol, to
    indicate when the next polling should occur. Certbot now reads
    this header if set and respect its value.
  * The acme module avoids sending the keyAuthorization field in
    the JWS payload when responding to a challenge as the field is
    not included in the current ACME protocol. To ease the migration
    path for ACME CA servers, Certbot and its acme module will first
    try the request without the keyAuthorization field but will
    temporarily retry the request with the field included if a
    malformed error is received. This fallback will be removed in
    version 0.34.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
