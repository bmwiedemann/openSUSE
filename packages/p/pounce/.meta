  <title>IRC bouncer</title>
  <description>Pounce is a multi-client, TLS-only IRC bouncer. It maintains a persistent
connection to an IRC server, acting as a proxy and buffer for a number of
clients. When a client connects, any messages received since it last
disconnected will be relayed to it. Unlike some other bouncers, pounce uses a
single buffer for all IRC messages, which acts as a queue from which each
client reads messages independently. Pounce speaks regular modern IRC to both
servers and clients, using the server-time extension to indicate when messages
originally occurred.</description>
