  <title>The Properties Maven Plugin</title>
  <description>The Properties Maven Plugin is here to make life a little easier when dealing with properties. It provides goals to read properties from files and URLs and write properties to files, and also to set system properties.

Itâ€™s main use-case is loading properties from files or URLs instead of declaring them in pom.xml, something that comes in handy when dealing with different environments.</description>
