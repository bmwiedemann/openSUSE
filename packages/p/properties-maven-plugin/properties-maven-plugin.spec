%description
The Properties Maven Plugin is here to make life a little easier when dealing
with properties. It provides goals to read properties from files and URLs and
write properties to files, and also to set system properties.

Itâ€™s main use-case is loading properties from files or URLs instead of
declaring them in pom.xml, something that comes in handy when dealing with
different environments.
