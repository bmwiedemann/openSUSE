%description
Kiwi is a C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving
algorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the
seminal Cassowary paper, but it is not a refactoring of the original
C++ solver. Kiwi ranges from 10x to 500x faster processing than the
original Cassowary solver with the same input set, with typical use
cases gaining a 40x improvement. Memory savings are consistently >5x.

In addition to the C++ solver, Kiwi ships with hand-rolled Python bindings.
