    <comment>- added change from request #639007
  - rename package to python3-espressomd
  - install COPYING for all packages
  - change license to GPL-3.0-or-later
  - added sonum define
- Version bump to 4.0.0
- Rename pacakge to python-espressomd
- Dropped 1830.patch - merged upstream
- Dropped doc package - under rework in 4.0.0
- New features:
  - Reaction ensemble methods for the modelling of chemical reactions, including constant pH and Wang-Landau schemes.
  - Polarisable particles via the Drude-oscillator scheme.
  - Steepest-descent energy minimization scheme.
  - Methods for active particles (swimmer_reaction, dipolar swimmers).
  - GPU-accelerated P3M method for electrostatic interactions.
  - GPU-accelerated direct summation and Barnes-Hutt schemes for dipolar interactions under open boundary conditions.
  - Support for the electrostatic and magnetostatics method provided by the ScaFaCoS library.
  - Immersed boundary method for soft immersed objects in an LB fluid.
  - Virtual sites acting as inertialess tracers in an LB fluid usable as part of the immersed boundary method or independently.
  - New bonded quartic and Coulomb interactions.
  - Possibility to tune the skin parameter.
  - Support for saving to the h5md file format for molecular dynamics data.
  - Connection to the MD Analysis Python package.
  - A rotate_system command was added, which rotates the particle positions around the systemâ€™s center of mass.
- Added 2255.patch to fix numpy issue on i586
- Added 2259.patch to fix numpy issue on big-endian platforms
- Added 2265.patch to fix test on i586
- add 1830.patch to fix install
- update version 3.3.1+git20180203.f74064d
  * many many small fixes
  * support for newer cython
- adapt to new openlmi package - source mpivars.h during build
- use individual libboost-*-devel packages instead of boost-devel
- RPM group fixup
- switched to cmake build-system
- build python module
- dropped header as they are for internal use only
- dropped pkg-config files as nothing depends on libs yet
- update version 3.3.1+git20160803.6ed0518.tar.gz
  * overhaul of buildsystem
  * many many small fixes
- fix boo#985147
  * there's a commit that removed redefinition of malloc and realloc
    which fixed build for gcc 6. but it's too hard to cherry pick, so 
    update to the latest git version is a good idea
- there's no --without-mpi option left in configure.ac, so &quot;-openmpi&quot;
  sub-package is meaningless now (everything has openmpi support)
  and since there's no two main packages any more, &quot;-common&quot; sub-package
  is also meaningless now (and it doesn't contains data), merged.
- add sub-package: &quot;-devel&quot;, &quot;libEspresso0&quot;, &quot;libEspressoTcl0&quot;
- add generate_headers.rb to gather those .hpp that're really used
  into &quot;-devel&quot; sub-package
- create pkgconfig files
- add some texlive BuildRequires to build pdf documentation.
- update version 3.3.1+git20160622.6aa229c:
  * added edge statistics for meshes used by object-in-fluid
  * added pos_folded property
  * Adapted simple LB tests to current interface.
  * system.part.writevtk()
  * redesigned exclusions and added slice input
  * Scafacos: Add long range energy to correct place in energy data structure
  * Correction to scafacos energy calculation: Check cutoff in near field contrib
  * Scafacos: Sort out conditional compilation and cython includes
  * Scafacos: methods shared between electrostatics and dipolar calculations
- Update to version 3.3.1
  * A lot of changes; please read the NEWS file
- version bumped to 3.3.0
- Highlights of this release include:
  - Calculation of the electrokinetic equations via the ELECTROKINETICS feature,
   - the Shan/Chen method for multi component lattice Boltzmann fluids,
   - the P3M and MMM1D methods can now be computed on a GPU,
   -  ESPResSo now has a rudimentary Python interface.

- build openmpi and non-mpi version
- initial commit
