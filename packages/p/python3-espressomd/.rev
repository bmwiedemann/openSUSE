    <comment>- added change from request #639007
  - rename package to python3-espressomd
  - install COPYING for all packages
  - change license to GPL-3.0-or-later
  - added sonum define
- Version bump to 4.0.0
- Rename pacakge to python-espressomd
- Dropped 1830.patch - merged upstream
- Dropped doc package - under rework in 4.0.0
- New features:
  - Reaction ensemble methods for the modelling of chemical reactions, including constant pH and Wang-Landau schemes.
  - Polarisable particles via the Drude-oscillator scheme.
  - Steepest-descent energy minimization scheme.
  - Methods for active particles (swimmer_reaction, dipolar swimmers).
  - GPU-accelerated P3M method for electrostatic interactions.
  - GPU-accelerated direct summation and Barnes-Hutt schemes for dipolar interactions under open boundary conditions.
  - Support for the electrostatic and magnetostatics method provided by the ScaFaCoS library.
  - Immersed boundary method for soft immersed objects in an LB fluid.
  - Virtual sites acting as inertialess tracers in an LB fluid usable as part of the immersed boundary method or independently.
  - New bonded quartic and Coulomb interactions.
  - Possibility to tune the skin parameter.
  - Support for saving to the h5md file format for molecular dynamics data.
  - Connection to the MD Analysis Python package.
  - A rotate_system command was added, which rotates the particle positions around the systemâ€™s center of mass.
- Added 2255.patch to fix numpy issue on i586
- Added 2259.patch to fix numpy issue on big-endian platforms
- Added 2265.patch to fix test on i586
- add 1830.patch to fix install
- update version 3.3.1+git20180203.f74064d
  * many many small fixes
  * support for newer cython
- adapt to new openlmi package - source mpivars.h during build
- use individual libboost-*-devel packages instead of boost-devel
- RPM group fixup
- switched to cmake build-system
- build python module
- dropped header as they are for internal use only
- dropped pkg-config files as nothing depends on libs yet
- update version 3.3.1+git20160803.6ed0518.tar.gz
  * overhaul of buildsystem
  * many many small fixes
- fix boo#985147
  * there's a commit that removed redefinition of malloc and realloc
    which fixed build for gcc 6. but it's too hard to cherry pick, so 
    update to the latest git version is a good idea
- there's no --without-mpi option left in configure.ac, so &quot;-openmpi&quot;
  sub-package is meaningless now (everything has openmpi support)
  and since there's no two main packages any more, &quot;-common&quot; sub-package
  is also meaningless now (and it doesn't contains data), merged.
- add sub-package: &quot;-devel&quot;, &quot;libEspresso0&quot;, &quot;libEspressoTcl0&quot;
- add generate_headers.rb to gather those .hpp that're really used
  into &quot;-devel&quot; sub-package
- create pkgconfig files
- add some texlive BuildRequires to build pdf documentation.
- update version 3.3.1+git20160622.6aa229c:
  * added edge statistics for meshes used by object-in-fluid
  * added pos_folded property
  * Adapted simple LB tests to current interface.
  * system.part.writevtk()
  * redesigned exclusions and added slice input
  * Scafacos: Add long range energy to correct place in energy data structure
  * Correction to scafacos energy calculation: Check cutoff in near field contrib
  * Scafacos: Sort out conditional compilation and cython includes
  * Scafacos: methods shared between electrostatics and dipolar calculations
- Update to version 3.3.1
  * A lot of changes; please read the NEWS file
- version bumped to 3.3.0
- Highlights of this release include:
  - Calculation of the electrokinetic equations via the ELECTROKINETICS feature,
   - the Shan/Chen method for multi component lattice Boltzmann fluids,
   - the P3M and MMM1D methods can now be computed on a GPU,
   -  ESPResSo now has a rudimentary Python interface.
   For a complete list of the changes in the release, please refer to:

- build openmpi and non-mpi version
- initial commit

    <version>4.1.2</version>
    <time>1579195314</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 4.1.2:
  - The interface has not been changed between ESPResSo 4.1.1 and
    4.1.2.
  - General corrections and improvements:
    - Remove correlation between the rotational noise and
      translational noise in the Langevin thermostat (#3355)
    - Fix a bug that may cause the wrong temperature to be set by
      the Langevin and DPD thermostats in the first time step
      after the system was altered from the Python level, e.g.,
      by changing particles or interactions (#3341)
    - Fix a bug that caused the DPD thermostat to generate an
      incorrect velocity distribution when used together with the
      Langevin thermostat (#3352)
    - Fix a bug in MMM2D and ELC with potential boundary
      conditions, where one of the correction factors was
      over-counted resulting in wrong energies (#3310)
    - Fix a bug that caused the wrong bonds to be deleted when
      removing particles from the system (#3356)
    - Fix an ambiguity in `ParticleSlice`: the values in the
      square brackets refer to particle ids, not array indices
      (#3367). This means the ill-defined syntax
      `system.part[0:-1]` is no longer valid. See the User Guide
      section on Setting up particles for more information.
    - Remove the mass prefactor in the `ComForce` observable and
      use the correct Particle ids in the
      `ParticleAngularVelocities` and `ParticleBodyVelocities`
      observables (#3380)
    - Fix a rounding error that caused debug builds of ESPResSo
      running with multiple MPI threads to crash when a particle
      was placed exactly on the boundary between two cells
      (#3377)
    - Fix `espressomd.has_features()` for the corner case where
      the list of all compiled-in features is passed as argument,
      returning ``False`` instead of ``True`` (#3318)
    - Refactor the random number generator code (#3349)
  - Documentation and tutorials corrections and improvements:
    - Improve documentation of Monte Carlo methods (#3254, #3330)
  - Build system and platform-related corrections and
    improvements:
    - List all Python dependencies in `requirements.txt` with the
      supported version numbers (#3300). Please note that most of
      them are optional.
    - Add `MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS` and `MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS` to the
      command lines of parallel tests (#3221)
    - Add the `-oversubscribe` flag to the command lines of
      parallel tests running with OpenMPI v2.X to avoid exiting
      early from a Python test configured without `MAX_NUM_PROC`
      on a machine with a hyperthreaded CPU where OpenMPI is
      configured such that the number of threads cannot exceed
      the number of cores (#3335)
    - Refactor the CI, maintainer, Doxygen and pypresso shell
      scripts to make them more portable and support filepaths
      containing whitespaces (#3326, #3373)
    - Fix a nvcc compiler warning on the empty config (#3329)
  - Improved testing:
    - Add a test for ELC and MMM2D using analytic expressions of
      the force and energy (#3331)
    - Sped-up seven Python tests (#3319)
    - Fix a test that broke on s390x architectures with Fedora 31
      (#3312)
    - Fix tests that broke on i586 architectures with OpenSUSE
      Tumbleweed (#3327, #3358)
