- Added 2259.patch to fix numpy issue on big-endian platforms
- Added 2265.patch to fix test on i586
- add 1830.patch to fix install
- update version 3.3.1+git20180203.f74064d
  * many many small fixes
  * support for newer cython
- adapt to new openlmi package - source mpivars.h during build
- use individual libboost-*-devel packages instead of boost-devel
- RPM group fixup
- switched to cmake build-system
- build python module
- dropped header as they are for internal use only
- dropped pkg-config files as nothing depends on libs yet
- update version 3.3.1+git20160803.6ed0518.tar.gz
  * overhaul of buildsystem
  * many many small fixes
- fix boo#985147
  * there's a commit that removed redefinition of malloc and realloc
    which fixed build for gcc 6. but it's too hard to cherry pick, so 
    update to the latest git version is a good idea
- there's no --without-mpi option left in configure.ac, so &quot;-openmpi&quot;
  sub-package is meaningless now (everything has openmpi support)
  and since there's no two main packages any more, &quot;-common&quot; sub-package
  is also meaningless now (and it doesn't contains data), merged.
- add sub-package: &quot;-devel&quot;, &quot;libEspresso0&quot;, &quot;libEspressoTcl0&quot;
- add generate_headers.rb to gather those .hpp that're really used
  into &quot;-devel&quot; sub-package
- create pkgconfig files
- add some texlive BuildRequires to build pdf documentation.

  * redesigned exclusions and added slice input
  * Scafacos: Add long range energy to correct place in energy data structure
  * Correction to scafacos energy calculation: Check cutoff in near field contrib
  * Scafacos: Sort out conditional compilation and cython includes
  * Scafacos: methods shared between electrostatics and dipolar calculations
- Update to version 3.3.1
  * A lot of changes; please read the NEWS file

    <version>4.1.2</version>
    <time>1579195314</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 4.1.2:
  - The interface has not been changed between ESPResSo 4.1.1 and
    4.1.2.
  - General corrections and improvements:
    - Remove correlation between the rotational noise and
      translational noise in the Langevin thermostat (#3355)
    - Fix a bug that may cause the wrong temperature to be set by
      the Langevin and DPD thermostats in the first time step
      after the system was altered from the Python level, e.g.,
      by changing particles or interactions (#3341)
    - Fix a bug that caused the DPD thermostat to generate an
      incorrect velocity distribution when used together with the
      Langevin thermostat (#3352)
    - Fix a bug in MMM2D and ELC with potential boundary
      conditions, where one of the correction factors was
      over-counted resulting in wrong energies (#3310)
    - Fix a bug that caused the wrong bonds to be deleted when
      removing particles from the system (#3356)
    - Fix an ambiguity in `ParticleSlice`: the values in the
      square brackets refer to particle ids, not array indices
      (#3367). This means the ill-defined syntax
      `system.part[0:-1]` is no longer valid. See the User Guide
      section on Setting up particles for more information.
    - Remove the mass prefactor in the `ComForce` observable and
      use the correct Particle ids in the
      `ParticleAngularVelocities` and `ParticleBodyVelocities`
      observables (#3380)
    - Fix a rounding error that caused debug builds of ESPResSo
      running with multiple MPI threads to crash when a particle
      was placed exactly on the boundary between two cells
      (#3377)
    - Fix `espressomd.has_features()` for the corner case where
      the list of all compiled-in features is passed as argument,
      returning ``False`` instead of ``True`` (#3318)
    - Refactor the random number generator code (#3349)
  - Documentation and tutorials corrections and improvements:
    - Improve documentation of Monte Carlo methods (#3254, #3330)
  - Build system and platform-related corrections and
    improvements:
    - List all Python dependencies in `requirements.txt` with the
      supported version numbers (#3300). Please note that most of
      them are optional.
    - Add `MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS` and `MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS` to the
      command lines of parallel tests (#3221)
    - Add the `-oversubscribe` flag to the command lines of
      parallel tests running with OpenMPI v2.X to avoid exiting
      early from a Python test configured without `MAX_NUM_PROC`
      on a machine with a hyperthreaded CPU where OpenMPI is
      configured such that the number of threads cannot exceed
      the number of cores (#3335)
    - Refactor the CI, maintainer, Doxygen and pypresso shell
      scripts to make them more portable and support filepaths
      containing whitespaces (#3326, #3373)
    - Fix a nvcc compiler warning on the empty config (#3329)
  - Improved testing:
    - Add a test for ELC and MMM2D using analytic expressions of
      the force and energy (#3331)
    - Sped-up seven Python tests (#3319)
    - Fix a test that broke on s390x architectures with Fedora 31
      (#3312)
    - Fix tests that broke on i586 architectures with OpenSUSE
      Tumbleweed (#3327, #3358)

    <time>1658396131</time>
    <user>RBrownFactory</user>
    <comment>- Update to 4.2.0:
    This is a feature release, i.e., new functionality is added
    to ESPResSo.  New thermostats, cell systems and boundary
    conditions have been introduced to simulate systems with
    Stokesian Dynamics, Brownian Dynamics, strongly inhomogeneous
    particle sizes or translation-invariant shear flow. The
    interface underwent (non-silent) changes, therefore scripts
    will have to be slightly adapted. Most notably, particle
    access by id and particle slices have a new syntax, and
    electrostatic/magnetostatic layer correction and reaction
    methods have a different setup. All errors are also now
    emitted as Python exceptions and are recoverable with minimal
    effort.  An additional focus of this release is the
    simplification of both the C++ core and the Python script
    interface to facilitate future extensions of ESPResSo.  The
    testing of ESPResSo's functionality has been extended
    considerably. We recommend that this release be used for all
    production simulations. No further bug fix releases will be
    provided for the 4.1 line, and not all fixes are present in
    ESPResSo 4.1.4.
   Added functionality
   -------------------
   
   * `P3MGPU` now supports energy and pressure calculation via
     the CPU kernels (#4506).
   * `ELC` now works with `P3MGPU` (#4506).
   * The LB grid now supports slicing operations (#4195) and LB
     slices are equality comparable (#4268).
   * Lees-Edwards boundary conditions can be used for
     particle-based simulations (#4457). Lattice-Boltzmann
     support will be added in the 4.3.0 release.
   * The non-bonded energy of a single particle can be calculated
     (#4401).
   * The list of close neighbors of a single particle can be
     extracted (#4401).
   * Brownian Dynamics simulations can be carried out with the
     newly added Brownian integrator and Brownian thermostat
     (#1842).
   * Stokesian Dynamics simulations can be carried out with the
     newly added Stokesian integrator and Stokesian thermostat
     (#3790, #3987).
   * Bonded interactions can now be automatically broken when the
     bond length exceeds a critical value (#4456). This feature
     can be combined with collision detection to model reversible
     bonds (#4464).
   * A new cell system `HybridDecomposition` was introduced to
     speed up simulations with inhomogeneous particle interaction
     ranges (#4373).
   * Shapes can be merged into meta-shapes (#3493, #3538).
   * The `HollowConicalFrustum` can now be sliced open, made
     thick and rotated to model quarter pipes in any orientation
     (#4179). The main application is in the construction of
     complex microchannel geometries via `LBBoundaries`.
   * A parametric weight function was added to the DPD
     interaction (#3570).
   * H5MD output files now support a unit system (#3751).
   * H5MD output files now support custom specifications to
     control which particle and box properties to write to disk
     (#4480).
   * The `H5md` class is now checkpointable and usable in an
     interactive Python session (#3751).
   * MDAnalysis integration now provides bond information
     (#3801).
- Give up on building on 32bit architectures (gh#espressomd/espresso#4537).
- Fix rpath in provided libraries and shebang in pypresso.
