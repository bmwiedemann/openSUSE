Subject: [PATCH] core: Add guard for boost 1.74.0

This <boost/serialization/version.hpp> include guards against an issue
in boost::serialization from boost 1.74.0 that leads to compiler error
"explicit specialization of undeclared template struct 'version'" when
including <boost/serialization/optional.hpp>. More details in tickets:
https://github.com/boostorg/serialization/issues/210
https://github.com/boostorg/serialization/issues/217
