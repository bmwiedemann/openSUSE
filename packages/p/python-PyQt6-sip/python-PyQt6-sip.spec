%description
The sip extension module provides support for the PyQt6 package.

SIP is a tool for automatically generating Python bindings for
C and C++ libraries. SIP was originally developed in 1998 for
PyQt - the Python bindings for the Qt GUI toolkit - but is
suitable for generating bindings for any C or C++ library. SIP
can also be used write self contained extension modules, i.e.
without a library to be wrapped.
