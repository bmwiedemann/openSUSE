%description
ATTENTION: deprecated methods of the old API ( _string_, _rgb_, _red_,
_green_, _blue_, _rgb_hex_, _rgb_hash_, _hsl_, _hue_, _saturation_,
_lightness_, _hsl_hash_, _blend_with_, _gradient_to_, _rgb_gradient_to_,
_hsl_gradient_to_, _complementary_) will be removed on version 2.0.

Graphics::Toolkit::Color, for short GTC, is the top level API of this
module and the only one a regular user should be concerned with. Its main
purpose is the creation of sets of related colors, such as gradients,
complements and others.

GTC are read only color holding objects with no additional dependencies.
Create them in many different ways (see section CONSTRUCTOR). Access its
values via methods from section GETTER. Measure differences with the
_distance_ method. SINGLE-COLOR methods create one a object that is related
to the current one and COLOR-SETS methods will create a host of color that
are not only related to the current color but also have relations between
each other.

While this module can understand and output color values in many spaces,
such as YIQ, HSL and many more, RGB is the (internal) primal one, because
GTC is about colors that can be shown on the screen, and these are usually
encoded in RGB.

Humans access colors on hardware level (eye) in RGB, on cognition level in
HSL (brain) and on cultural level (language) with names. Having easy access
to all three and some color math should enable you to get the color palette
you desire quickly.
