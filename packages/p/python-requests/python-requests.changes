Thu Jun  6 19:38:03 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.32.3:
  * Fixed bug breaking the ability to specify custom SSLContexts
    in sub-classes of HTTPAdapter.
  * Fixed issue where Requests started failing to run on Python
    versions compiled without the `ssl` module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 22 14:00:50 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.32.2
  * To provide a more stable migration for custom HTTPAdapters impacted by the CVE changes in 2.32.0,
    we've renamed _get_connection to a new public API, get_connection_with_tls_context. Existing
    custom HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API. get_connection is
    considered deprecated in all versions of Requests>=2.32.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 21 12:33:41 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.32.1
  * Fixed an issue where setting verify=False on the first request from a Session
    will cause subsequent requests to the same origin to also ignore cert verification,
    regardless of the value of verify. (bsc#1224788, CVE-2024-35195)
  * verify=True now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve request time
    variance between first and subsequent requests.
  * Requests now supports optional use of character detection (chardet or charset_normalizer)
    when repackaged or vendored. This enables pip and other projects to minimize their
    vendoring surface area.
  * Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 and dropped support for CPython 3.7.
  * Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system using hatchling.

Mon Jun 12 12:02:29 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Delete requests-no-hardcoded-version.patch
- Security Update to 2.31.0 (bsc#1211674):
  Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential
  forwarding of Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when
  following HTTPS redirects.

  When proxies are defined with user info (https://user:pass@proxy:8080), Requests
  will construct a Proxy-Authorization header that is attached to the request to
  authenticate with the proxy.

  In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached
  the Proxy-Authorization header incorrectly, resulting in the value being
  sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on
  defining their proxy credentials in the URL are strongly encouraged to upgrade
  to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy
  credentials once the change has been fully deployed.

  Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through
  the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this
  vulnerability.

  Full details can be read in our Github Security Advisory
  and CVE-2023-32681.

    dropped from proxy URLs. (#6028)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 16:20:04 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.27.0:
* Officially added support for Python 3.10. (#5928)

* Added a `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` to unify JSON exceptions between
  Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the `response.json()` method, and is
  backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions.
  Can be caught from `requests.exceptions.RequestException` as well. (#5856)

* Improved error text for misnamed `InvalidSchema` and `MissingSchema`
  exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed
  (Schema->Scheme). (#6017)
* Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address
  recent changes to `urlparse` in Python 3.9+. (#5917)
* Fixed defect in `extract_zipped_paths` which could result in an infinite loop
  for some paths. (#5851)
* Fixed handling for `AttributeError` when calculating length of files obtained
  by `Tarfile.extractfile()`. (#5239)
* Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader` with
  `requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader`. (#5914)
* Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (#5391)
* Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where `Proxy-Authorization` was
  incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with `Session.send`. (#5924)
* Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of
  proxies available in the environment. (#5924)
* Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping `UnicodeError` with
  `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL` for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the
  domain. (#5414)
* Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022. While we
  don't have exact dates, Requests 2.27.x is likely to be the last release
  series providing support.

- update to 2.10.1:
  * SOCKS Proxy Support! (requires PySocks; $ pip install requests[socks])
  * Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.
  * Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use OrderedDict
    as its underlying datastore.
  * Don't use redirect_cache if allow_redirects=False

  * Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  1 17:44:11 UTC 2016 - jmatejek@suse.com

- update no-default-cacert.patch to simply pass empty CA path
- urllib3-ssl-default-context.patch: patch bundled urllib3 to behave
  correctly with regard to empty CA path passed
- change urllib3 fallback requirements to Recommends
- use ca-certificates in SLE as well
- recommend ca-certificates-mozilla to have a basic certificate set

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 14:47:12 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.9.1 (changes since 2.8.1):
  * The verify keyword argument now supports being passed a path to
    a directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.
  * Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.
  * Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the
    status code registry.
  * For file-like objects that are not seeked to the very beginning,
    we now send the content length for the number of bytes we will
    actually read, rather than the total size of the file, allowing
    partial file uploads.
  * When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no
    obvious content length we set Transfer-Encoding: chunked rather
    than Content-Length: 0.
  * We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when
    uploading chunked bodies.
  * We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on
    Python 3, by decoding it as UTF-8.
  * Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when
    using the functional API rather than leaking and waiting for
    the garbage collector to clean them up.
  * Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed qop
    directive that contains no token, by treating it the same as if
    no qop directive was provided at all.
  * Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies
    by name.
  * Fix errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain
    locales.
  * Update bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.
- Rebase no-default-cacert.patch.
- Modify no-default-cacert.patch: output /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem
  instead of neither NULL nor /etc/ssl/certs/ as a path to cacerts
  bundle (boo#967128).
- Don't apply no-default-cacert.patch on SLE.
- Require ca-certificates package (but not on SLE).
- Tests are being improperly started and actual ones require
  network connection, so fix and comment out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 17 13:45:59 UTC 2015 - rjschwei@suse.com

- Modify no-default-cacert
  + The call to set_default_verify_paths() is not necessary. The openSUSE
    and SLES Python has been patched to always use the system certs.
    Additionally this call breaks the use of python-requests on older systems,
    openSUSE_13.2 and original release of SLES 12 which fall back to
    the built in implementation of ssl which doe not implement
    this method

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 21:08:29 UTC 2015 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 2.8.1:
  - Update certificate bundle to match ``certifi`` 2015.9.6.2's weak certificate
    bundle.
  - Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise ``ConnectTimeout`` instead of
    ``ConnectionError``
  - When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly respect the
    ``json`` parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.
  - When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a
    Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  does basically the same.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  9 19:11:09 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.0:
  * Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the proxies
    dictionary to have entries of the form {'<scheme>://<hostname>':
    '<proxy>'}. Host-specific proxies will be used in preference to
    the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the previous
    syntax will continue to work.
  * Response.raise_for_status now prints the URL that failed as
    part of the exception message.
  * requests.utils.get_netrc_auth now takes an raise_errors kwarg,
    defaulting to False. When True, errors parsing .netrc files
    cause exceptions to be thrown.
  * Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to
    unbundle requests downstream.
  * Change the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on
    Linux: now contains only the requests version.
  * The json parameter to post() and friends will now only be used
    if neither data nor files are present, consistent with the
    documentation.
  * We now ignore empty fields in the NO_PROXY enviroment variable.
  * Fix problem where httplib.BadStatusLine would get raised if
    combining stream=True with contextlib.closing.
  * Prevent bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection
    back to the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.
  * Miscellaneous minor internal changes.
  * Digest Auth support is now thread safe.
- Apply no-default-cacert-sles.patch on SLE 12.
- Apply Arun Persaud's changes to requests-do-not-use-bundle.patch
  (update to 2.8.0).
- Enable tests.
- Small spec cleanup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 20 12:25:21 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 2.6.0 (bsc#922448, CVE-2015-2296):
  - Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie without a host
    value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL exposing requests
    users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie stealing. This was
    disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of `BugFuzz <https://bugfuzz.com>`_.
    An CVE identifier has not yet been assigned for this. This affects all
    versions of requests from v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).
  - Fix error when requests is an ``install_requires`` dependency and ``python
    setup.py test`` is run. (#2462)
  - Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the
    vendored import location.
  - Include fixes to ``urllib3``'s header handling.
  - Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.
  - Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the ``files`` argument.
    (#2468)
  - Avoid data duplication when creating a request with ``str``, ``bytes``, or
    ``bytearray`` input to the ``files`` argument.
  - Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context see
    (#2455, #2456, and http://bugs.python.org/issue23476)

  * Behavioral Changes
    - ``Connection: keep-alive`` header is now sent automatically.
  * Improvements
    - Support for connect timeouts! Timeout now accepts a tuple

      read timeouts.
    - Allow copying of PreparedRequests without headers/cookies.
    - Updated bundled urllib3 version.
    - Refactored settings loading from environment
      new `Session.merge_environment_settings`.

Sat Jun 14 10:56:52 UTC 2014 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Update tarball to the one upstream is publishing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  5 19:40:21 UTC 2014 - rschweikert@suse.com

- Update to version 2.3.0
  + New ``Response`` property ``is_redirect``, which is true when the
    library could have processed this response as a redirection (whether
    or not it actually did).
  + The ``timeout`` parameter now affects requests with both ``stream=True``
    and ``stream=False`` equally.
  + The change in v2.0.0 to mandate explicit proxy schemes has been reverted.
    Proxy schemes now default to ``http://``.
  + The ``CaseInsensitiveDict`` used for HTTP headers now behaves like a normal
    dictionary when references as string or viewd in the interpreter.
  + No longer expose Authorization or Proxy-Authorization headers on redirect.
    Fix CVE-2014-1829 and CVE-2014-1830 respectively.
  + Authorization is re-evaluated each redirect.
  + On redirect, pass url as native strings.
  + Fall-back to autodetected encoding for JSON when Unicode detection fails.
  + Headers set to ``None`` on the ``Session`` are now correctly not sent.
  + Correctly honor ``decode_unicode`` even if it wasn't used earlier in the
    same response.
  + Stop advertising ``compress`` as a supported Content-Encoding.
  + The ``Response.history`` parameter is now always a list.
  + Many, many ``urllib3`` bugfixes.- Fixes incorrect parsing of proxy
    credentials that contain a literal or encoded '#' character.
  + Assorted urllib3 fixes.
  + New exception: ``ContentDecodingError``. Raised instead of ``urllib3``
    ``DecodeError`` exceptions.
  + Avoid many many exceptions from the buggy implementation of
    ``proxy_bypass`` on OS X in Python 2.6.
  + Avoid crashing when attempting to get authentication credentials
    from ~/.netrc when running as a user without a home directory.
  + Use the correct pool size for pools of connections to proxies.
  + Fix iteration of ``CookieJar`` objects.
  + Ensure that cookies are persisted over redirect.
  + Switch back to using chardet, since it has merged with charade.
  + Cookies set on individual Requests through a ``Session``
    (e.g. via ``Session.get()``) are no longer persisted to the ``Session``.
  + Clean up connections when we hit problems during chunked upload,
    rather than leaking them.
  + Return connections to the pool when a chunked upload is successful,
    rather than leaking it.
  + Match the HTTPbis recommendation for HTTP 301 redirects.
  + Prevent hanging when using streaming uploads and Digest Auth when a
    401 is received.
  + Values of headers set by Requests are now always the native string type.
  + Fix previously broken SNI support.
  + Fix accessing HTTP proxies using proxy authentication.
  + Unencode HTTP Basic usernames and passwords extracted from URLs.
  + Support for IP address ranges for no_proxy environment variable
  + Parse headers correctly when users override the default ``Host:`` header.
  + Avoid munging the URL in case of case-sensitive servers.
  + Looser URL handling for non-HTTP/HTTPS urls.
  + Accept unicode methods in Python 2.6 and 2.7.
  + More resilient cookie handling.
  + Make ``Response`` objects pickleable.
  + Actually added MD5-sess to Digest Auth instead of pretending to like
    last time.
  + Updated internal urllib3.
  + Fixed @Lukasa's lack of taste.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  9 15:27:58 UTC 2013 - vuntz@suse.com

- Add no-default-cacert-sles.patch: use this patch when building
  for SLES, since python in SLES and openSUSE behave differently
  when it comes to SSL, and no-default-cacert.patch is wrong for
  SLES.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  7 10:07:58 UTC 2013 - mcihar@suse.cz

- update to 2.0.1
- changes in 2.0.1:
 - Updated included CA Bundle with new mistrusts and automated process for the future
 - Added MD5-sess to Digest Auth
 - Accept per-file headers in multipart file POST messages.
 - Fixed: Don't send the full URL on CONNECT messages.
 - Fixed: Correctly lowercase a redirect scheme.
 - Fixed: Cookies not persisted when set via functional API.
 - Fixed: Translate urllib3 ProxyError into a requests ProxyError derived from ConnectionError.
 - Updated internal urllib3 and chardet.
- changes in 2.0.0:
 - Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,
   i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.
 - Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception
   will be raised if they don't.
 - Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.
 - ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.
 - Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.
 - Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This
   method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on
   the ``Session``.
 - Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This
   method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the
   corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.
 - Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.
   This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.
 - ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding
   will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.
 - Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``
   exception to be raised.
 - HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ``"im_used"``. Correctly uses
   ``"already_reported"``.
 - HTTP 226 reason added (``"im_used"``).
 - Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb. Special thanks to
   the many contributors who worked towards this improvement.
 - Cookies are now properly managed when 401 authentication responses are
   received.
 - Chunked encoding fixes.
 - Support for mixed case schemes.
 - Better handling of streaming downloads.
 - Retrieve environment proxies from more locations.

- Require python-setuptools instead of distribute (upstreams merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 25 11:40:02 UTC 2013 - vuntz@suse.com

- Add no-default-cacert.patch: completely ignore the internal CA
  bundle and point to /etc/ssl/certs/. This works because we
  patched python to do the right thing when a directory is used
  there instead of a file.
- Manually remove requests/cacert.pem (better than doing that in
  the patch, since it's big) too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 27 10:36:36 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.2.3:

- update to 1.2.0:

 * Significantly change how hooks are dispatched - hooks now receive all the
  arguments specified by the user when making a request so hooks can make a
  secondary request with the same parameters. This is especially necessary for
  authentication handler authors
 * certifi support was removed
 * Fixed bug where using OAuth 1 with body ``signature_type`` sent no data
 * Major proxy work thanks to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy authentication
  from the proxy url
 * Fix DigestAuth handling too many 401s
 * Update vendored urllib3 to include SSL bug fixes
 * Allow keyword arguments to be passed to ``json.loads()`` via the
  ``Response.json()`` method

   requests
 * Add ``elapsed`` attribute to ``Response`` objects to time how long a request
   took.
 * Fix ``RequestsCookieJar``
 * Sessions and Adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the
  mutiprocessing library
  Update charade to version 1.0.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 18 08:31:22 UTC 2013 - saschpe@suse.de

  + charade: LGPL-2.1+

- Use a slightly different approach for bnc#761500, try to use /etc/ssl/certs
  but use /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem as a fallback. The previous fix didn't work
  for me as (my) Python ssl module doesn't support cert directories...
