- Update to v3.1
  * Breaking data change: A schema and data migration are required
    for users of mx.models.MXStateField and mx.forms.MXStateSelect.
    The following steps are required:
    + run manage.py makemigrations to generate a schema migration
    + migrate DIF to CDMX with a data migration
  * Breaking data change: A data migration is required for users of
    in_.models.INStateField and in_.forms.INStateSelect.
    The following data migrations are required:
    + Migrate CG to CT for Chattisgarh
    + Migrate UA to UT for Uttarakhand
    + Migrate DD and DN to DH for Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu
  * A warning message will be displayed when mx.models.MXStateField,
    mx.forms.MXStateSelect, in_.models.INStateField or
    in_.forms.INStateSelect are used. See the localflavor online docs
    for instructions on how to suppress this warning once the migration
    has been completed.
  * Fix fr.forms.FRNationalIdentificationNumber validation for people
    born overseas
  * Breaking data change: Updated Indian states and union territories
    names and code as per iso 3166 (iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:IN).
    The key for Chattisgarh has been changed from CG to CT, the key
    for Uttarakhand has been changed from UA to UT, and the keys DD
    (Dadra and Nagar Haveli) and DN (Daman and Diu) have been removed
    and combined into DH (Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu).
    Ladakh (LA) is the new addition in the Union Territories.
    There are also a few modifications in the States and 
    Union Territories names: Orissa (OR) is now Odisha (OR), Pondicherry (PY)
    is now Puducherry (PY) Andaman and Nicobar (AN) is now Andaman and
    Nicobar Islands (AN).
  * Correct sorting of US_STATES to sort by full name rather than code
  * Added new region for CL (gh-432, gh-433).
  * Updated IBAN validation for changes in IBAN Registry release 89, March 2021.
  * Breaking data change: mx.mx_states.STATE_CHOICES has been updated
    to change DIF/Distrito Federal to CDMX/Ciudad de MÃ©xico, the legal
    name for this state as of 29 January 2016.
  * Extended validation of BICs to match official SEPA regulations.
  * Removed positional arguments (*args) from form fields that inherit
    from Django's forms.CharField and forms.Field. Positional arguments
    are not supported in the the parent form and did not work.
  * Added error codes to all ValidationError`s as recommended by
    `Django's form validation documentation.
  * Renamed zh_CN and zh_TW locales to zh_Hans and zh_Hant
    respectively to match the Django locale names.
