%description
Bleach is an HTML sanitation library that escapes or strips markup and
attributes based on a white list. Bleach can also linkify text safely, applying
filters that Django's ``urlize`` filter cannot, and optionally setting ``rel``
attributes, even on links already in the text.

Bleach is intended for sanitizing text from *untrusted* sources.

Because it relies on html5lib, Bleach is as good as modern browsers at dealing
with weird, quirky HTML fragments. Bleach's methods will fix
unbalanced or mis-nested tags.

Documentation is at http://bleach.readthedocs.org/ .
