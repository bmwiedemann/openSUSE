- update to 3.1.4 (bsc#1168280, CVE-2020-6817):
  * ``bleach.clean`` behavior parsing style attributes could result in a
    regular expression denial of service (ReDoS).
    Calls to ``bleach.clean`` with an allowed tag with an allowed
    ``style`` attribute were vulnerable to ReDoS. For example,
    ``bleach.clean(..., attributes={'a': ['style']})``.
  * Style attributes with dashes, or single or double quoted values are
    cleaned instead of passed through.

- update to 3.1.3 (bsc#1167379, CVE-2020-6816):
  * Add relative link to code of conduct. (#442)
  * Drop deprecated 'setup.py test' support. (#507)
  * Fix typo: curren -> current in tests/test_clean.py (#504)
  * Test on PyPy 7
  * Drop test support for end of life Python 3.4
  * ``bleach.clean`` behavior parsing embedded MathML and SVG content
    with RCDATA tags did not match browser behavior and could result in
    a mutation XSS.
    Calls to ``bleach.clean`` with ``strip=False`` and ``math`` or
    ``svg`` tags and one or more of the RCDATA tags ``script``,
    ``noscript``, ``style``, ``noframes``, ``iframe``, ``noembed``, or
    ``xmp`` in the allowed tags whitelist were vulnerable to a mutation
    XSS.

- Add de-vendor.patch to avoid new vendoring of html5lib in v3.1.0
- Remove direct dependency on webencodings, a dependency of html5lib
- Update to v3.1.0
  * Add ``recognized_tags`` argument to the linkify ``Linker`` class. This
    fixes issues when linkifying on its own and having some tags get escaped.
    It defaults to a list of HTML5 tags
  * Add ``six>=1.9`` to requirements
  * Fix cases where attribute names could have invalid characters in them.
  * Fix problems with ``LinkifyFilter`` not being able to match links
    across ``&amp;``.
  * Fix ``InputStreamWithMemory`` when the ``BleachHTMLParser`` is
    parsing ``meta`` tags
  * Fix doctests.
- from v3.0.2
  * Merge ``Characters`` tokens after sanitizing them. This fixes issues
    in the ``LinkifyFilter`` where it was only linkifying parts of urls
- from v3.0.1
  * Support Python 3.7. It supported Python 3.7 just fine, but 3.7 was
    added to the list of Python environments being test
  * Fix ``list`` object has no attribute ``lower`` in ``clean``
  * Fix ``abbr`` getting escaped in ``linkify``
- from v3.0.0
  * [breaking] A bunch of functions were moved from one module to another.
    These were moved from ``bleach.sanitizer`` to ``bleach.html5lib_shim``:
    + convert_entity
    + convert_entities
    + match_entity
    + next_possible_entity
    + BleachHTMLSerializer
    + BleachHTMLTokenizer
    + BleachHTMLParser
    These functions and classes weren't documented and aren't part of the
    public API, but people read code and might be using them so we're
    considering it an incompatible API change.
    If you're using them, you'll need to update your code.
  * Bleach no longer depends on html5lib. html5lib==1.0.1 is now vendored into
    Bleach. You can remove it from your requirements file if none of your other
    requirements require html5lib.
    This means Bleach will now work fine with other libraries that depend on
    html5lib regardless of what version of html5lib they require.
  * Fixed tags getting added when using clean or linkify. This was a
    long-standing regression from the Bleach 2.0 rewrite
  * Fixed ``<isindex>`` getting replaced with a string. Now it gets escaped or
    stripped depending on whether it's in the allowed tags or not
- from v2.1.4
  * Dropped support for Python 3.3
  * Handle ambiguous ampersands in correctly

- Update to version 2.1.3:
  * Attributes that have URI values weren't properly sanitized if the
    values contained character entities. Using character entities, it
    was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not
    allowed that would slide through unsanitized.
    (CVE-2018-7753 bnc#1085969)

- changes from version 2.1:
  * Security fixes

      See https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/298 for more details.
      This affects all previous versions of Bleach. Check the comments
      on that issue for ways to alleviate the issue if you can’t
      upgrade to Bleach 2.1.
  * Backwards incompatible changes
    + Redid versioning. bleach.VERSION is no longer available. Use the
      string version at bleach.__version__ and parse it with
      pkg_resources.parse_version. (#307)
    + clean, linkify: linkify and clean should only accept text types;
      thank you, Janusz! (#292)
    + clean, linkify: accept only unicode or utf-8-encoded str (#176)
  * Bug fixes
    + bleach.clean() no longer unescapes entities including ones that
      are missing a ; at the end which can happen in urls and other
      places. (#143)
    + linkify: fix http links inside of mailto links; thank you,
      sedrubal! (#300)
    + clarify security policy in docs (#303)
    + fix dependency specification for html5lib 1.0b8, 1.0b9, and
      1.0b10; thank you, Zoltán! (#268)
    + add Bleach vs. html5lib comparison to README; thank you, Stu
      Cox! (#278)
