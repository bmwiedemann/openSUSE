- fix tests on python 3.8 as well with newer python-mocket by skipping
  the tests/test_webservice which need porting to new python-mocket 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 23 16:42:49 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Disable broken tests for python 3.11. python-mocket currently does not work
  with python 3.11, so we should disable tests that uses it until it's
  supported.

  See these issues:

Mon Jul  4 07:11:02 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to version 4.6.0:
  - The AddressNotFoundError class now has an ip_address attribute
    with the lookup address and network property for the empty network
    in the database containing the IP address. These are only available
    when using a database, not the web service. 
- Rebase 0001-Removing-unused-urllib3-dependency-loosening-request.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 18 19:55:34 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 4.5.0:
 - Support for mobile country code (MCC) and mobile network codes (MNC) was
   added for the GeoIP2 ISP and Enterprise databases as well as the GeoIP2
   City and Insights web services. ``mobile_country_code`` and
   ``mobile_network_code`` attributes were added to ``geoip2.model.ISP``
   for the GeoIP2 ISP database and ``geoip2.record.Traits`` for the
   Enterprise database and the GeoIP2 City and Insights web services.
   We expect this data to be available by late January, 2022.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 24 19:10:31 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 4.4.0:
 - The public API on ``geoip2.database`` is now explicitly defined by
   setting ``__all__``.
 - The return type of the ``metadata()`` method on ``Reader`` is now
   ``maxminddb.reader.Metadata`` rather than a union type.
- update to version 4.3.0:
 - Previously, the ``py.typed`` file was not being added to the source
   distribution. It is now explicitly specified in the manifest.
 - The type hints for the database file in the ``Reader`` constructor have
   been expanded to match those specified by ``maxmindb.open_database``. In
   particular, ``os.PathLike`` and ``IO`` have been added.
 - Corrected the type hint for the ``metadata()`` method on ``Reader``. It
   will return a ``maxminddb.extension.Metadata`` if the C extension is being
   used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 13 09:58:29 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- update to version 4.2.0:
 - You may now set a proxy to use when making web service requests by passing
   the ``proxy`` parameter to the ``AsyncClient`` or ``Client`` constructor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 10 01:27:35 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

    and geoip2.record.Traits.

  - Added ``py.typed`` file per PEP 561. Reported by Árni Már Jónsson.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 23 20:21:35 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 4.0.1:
  - Re-release to fix bad reStructuredText in ``README.md``. No substantive
    changes.
- update to version 4.0.0:
  - IMPORTANT: Python 2.7 and 3.5 support has been dropped. Python 3.6 or greater
    is required.
  - Asyncio support has been added for web service requests. To make async
    requests, use ``geoip.webservice.AsyncClient``.
  - ``geoip.webservice.Client`` now provides a ``close()`` method and associated
    context managers to be used in ``with`` statements.
  - Type hints have been added.
  - The attributes ``postal_code`` and ``postal_confidence`` have been removed
    from ``geoip2.record.Location``. These would previously always be ``None``.
  - ``user_id`` is no longer supported as a named argument for the constructor
    on ``geoip2.webservice.Client``. Use ``account_id`` or a positional
    parameter instead.
  - For both ``Client`` and ``AsyncClient`` requests, the default timeout is
    now 60 seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  4 07:46:22 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 3.0.0
  * BREAKING CHANGE: The geoip2.record.* classes have been refactored to
    improve performance. This refactoring may break classes that inherit from
    them. The public API should otherwise be compatible.
  * The network attribute was added to geoip2.record.Traits,
    geoip2.model.AnonymousIP, geoip2.model.ASN,
    geoip2.model.ConnectionType, geoip2.model.Domain,
    and geoip2.model.ISP. This is an ipaddress.IPv4Network or an
    ipaddress.IPv6Network. This is the largest network where all of the
    fields besides ip_address have the same value. GitHub #79.
  * Python 3.3 and 3.4 are no longer supported.
  * Updated documentation of anonymizer attributes - is_anonymous_vpn and
    is_hosting_provider - to be more descriptive.
  * Added support for the user_count trait for the GeoIP2 Precision webservice.
  * Added the static_ip_score attribute to geoip2.record.Traits for
  * GeoIP2 Precision Insights. This is a float which indicates how static or dynamic
    an IP address is.

   request by nkinkade. GitHub #53.
