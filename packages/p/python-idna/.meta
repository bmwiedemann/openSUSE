  <title>Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)</title>
  <description>A library to support the Internationalised Domain Names in
Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified in RFC 5891
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891. This version of the protocol
is often referred to as “IDNA2008” and can produce different
results from the earlier standard from 2003.

The library is also intended to act as a suitable drop-in replacement
for the “encodings.idna” module that comes with the Python standard
library but currently only supports the older 2003 specification.</description>
