%description
Priority is a pure-Python implementation of the priority logic for HTTP/2, set
out in `RFC 7540 Section 5.3 (Stream Priority)`. This logic allows for clients
to express a preference for how the server allocates its (limited) resources to
the many outstanding HTTP requests that may be running over a single HTTP/2
connection.
