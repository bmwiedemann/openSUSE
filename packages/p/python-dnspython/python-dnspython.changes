Fri Jan  8 20:01:12 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.1.0:
 * End-of-line comments are now associated with rdata when read from text.
   For backwards compatibility with prior versions of dnspython, they are
   only emitted in to_text() when requested.
 * Synchronous I/O is a bit more efficient, as we now try the I/O and only
   use poll() or select() if the I/O would block.
 * The resolver cache classes now offer basic hit and miss statistics, and
   the LRUCache can also provide hits for every cache key.
 * The resolver has a canonical_name() method.
 * There is now a registration mechanism for EDNS option types.
 * The default EDNS payload size has changed from 1280 to 1232.
 * The SVCB, HTTPS, and SMIMEA RR types are now supported.
 * TSIG has been enhanced with TKEY and GSS-TSIG support.  Thanks to
   Nick Hall for writing this.
 * Zones now can be updated via transactions.
 * A new zone subclass, dns.versioned.Zone is available which has a
   thread-safe transaction implementation and support for keeping many
   versions of a zone.
 * The zone file reading code has been adapted to use transactions, and
   is now a public API.
 * Inbound zone transfer support has been rewritten and is available as
   dns.query.inbound_xfr() and dns.asyncquery.inbound_xfr().  It uses
   the transaction mechanism, and fully supports IXFR and AXFR.

Thu Aug  6 13:46:23 UTC 2020 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Disable four tests which fail on openssl 1.1.0i and lower
- Add missing dependency requests-toolkit, and recommend
  cryptography

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 18 10:53:18 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- remove test depending on trio, which depends on Python 3.7 if python >= 3.7 is not available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 18 10:30:15 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to 2.0.0:
 - Python 3.6 or newer is required.
 - The license is now the ISC license.
 - Rdata is now immutable. Use dns.rdata.Rdata.replace() to make a new Rdata based on an existing one.
 - dns.resolver.resolve() has been added, allowing control of whether search lists are used. dns.resolver.query() is retained for backwards compatibility, but deprecated. The default for search list behavior can be set at in the resolver object with the use_search_by_default parameter. The default is False.
 - DNS-over-TLS is supported with dns.query.tls().
 - DNS-over-HTTPS is supported with dns.query.https(), and the resolver will use DNS-over-HTTPS for a nameserver which is an HTTPS URL.
 - Basic query and resolver support for the Trio, Curio, and asyncio asynchronous I/O libraries has been added in dns.asyncquery and dns.asyncresolver. This API should be viewed as experimental as asynchronous I/O support in dnspython is still evolving.
 - TSIG now defaults to using SHA-256.
 - Basic type info has been added to some functions. Future releases will have comprehensive type info.
 - from_text() functions now have a relativize_to parameter.
 - python-cryptography is now used for DNSSEC.
 - Ed25519 and Ed448 signatures are now supported.
 - A helper for NSEC3 generating hashes has been added.
 - SHA384 DS records are supported.
 - Rdatasets and RRsets are much faster.
 - dns.resolver.resolve_address() has been added, allowing easy address-to-name lookups.
 - dns.reversename functions now allow an alternate origin to be specified.
 - The repr form of Rdatasets and RRsets now includes the rdata.
 - A number of standard resolv.conf options are now parsed.
 - The nameserver and port used to get a response are now part of the resolver’s Answer object.
 - The NINFO record is supported.
 - The dns.hash module has been removed; just use Python’s native hashlib module.
 - Rounding is done in the standard python 3 fashion; dnspython 1.x rounded in the python 2 style on both python 2 and 3.
 - The resolver will now do negative caching if a cache has been configured.
 - TSIG and OPT now have rdata types.
 - The class for query messages is now QueryMessage. Class Message is now a base class, and is also used for messages for which we don’t have a better class. Update messages are now class UpdateMessage, though class Update is retained for compatibility.
 - Support for Windows 95, 98, and ME has been removed.

Fri Mar  8 13:55:40 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.16.0:
  * various fixes for wheel/cryptodome/etc
- Remove all patches, merged upstream:
  * 210.patch
  * pycryptodome.patch
  * readme.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  4 12:47:22 UTC 2018 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  8 13:16:31 UTC 2016 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- New upstream release 1.15.0
    * IDNA 2008 support is now available if the "idna" module has been
    installed and IDNA 2008 is requested.  The default IDNA behavior
    is still IDNA 2003.  The new IDNA codec mechanism is currently
    only useful for direct calls to dns.name.from_text() or
    dns.name.from_unicode(), but in future releases it will be
    deployed throughout dnspython, e.g. so that you can read a
    masterfile with an IDNA 2008 codec in force.
    * By default, dns.name.to_unicode() is not strict about which
    version of IDNA the input complies with.  Strictness can be
    requested by using one of the strict IDNA codecs.
    * Add AVC RR support.
    * Some problems with newlines in various output modes have been
    addressed.
    * dns.name.to_text() now returns text and not bytes on Python 3.x
    * More miscellaneous fixes for the Python 2/3 codeline merge.
- Include readme with readme.patch as not included in upstream tarball
- Fix a bug in the tests code with 210.patch with upstream pull request #210

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 17 07:09:42 UTC 2014 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.12.0:
  * The test system can now run the tests without requiring dnspython
    to be installed.
  * When reading from a masterfile, if the first content line
    started with leading whitespace, we raised an ugly exception
    instead of doing the right thing, namely using the zone origin as
    the name. [#73]  Thanks to Tassatux for reporting the issue.
  * Added dns.zone.to_text() convenience method.  Thanks to Brandon
    Whaley <redkrieg@gmail.com> for the patch.
  * The /etc/resolv.conf setting "options rotate" is now understood
    by the resolver.  If present, the resolver will shuffle the
    nameserver list each time dns.resolver.query() is called.  Thanks
    to underrun for the patch.  Note that you don't want to add
    "options rotate" to your /etc/resolv.conf if your system's
    resolver library does not understand it.  In this case, just set
    resolver.rotate = True by hand.
  * Escaping of Unicode has been corrected.  Previously we escaped
    and then converted to Unicode, but the right thing to do is
    convert to Unicode, then escape.  Also, characters > 0x7f should
    NOT be escaped in Unicode mode.  Thanks to Martin Basti for the
    patch.
  * dns.rdtypes.ANY.DNSKEY now has helpers functions to convert
    between the numeric form of the flags and a set of human-friendly
    strings.  Thanks to Petr Spacek for the patch.
  * RRSIGs did not respect relativization settings in to_text().
    Thanks to Brian Smith for reporting the bug and submitting a
    (slightly different) patch.
  * dns/rdtypes/IN/APL.py: The APL from_wire() method did not accept an
    rdata length of 0 as valid.  Thanks to salzmdan for reporting the
    problem.
  * dns/ipv6.py: Add is_mapped()
  * dns/reversename.py: Lookup IPv6 mapped IPv4 addresses in the v4
    reverse namespace.  Thanks to Devin Bayer.  Yes, I finally fixed
    this one :)
  * dns/zone.py: Do not put back an unescaped token.  This was
    causing escape processing for domain names to break.  Thanks to
    connormclaud for reporting the problem.
  * dns/message.py: Making a response didn't work correctly if the
    query was signed with TSIG and we knew the key.  Thanks to Jeffrey
    Stiles for reporting the problem.
  * dns/query.py: Fix problems with the IXFR state machine which caused
    long diffs to fail.  Thanks to James Raftery for the fix and the
    repeated prodding to get it applied :)
- enable some tests 
- add python-dnspython-rpmlintrc file
- add python-ecdsa and python-pycrypto to BuildRequires for the 
  DNSSec tests
- use /usr/bin/python instead of /usr/bin/env python for the example
  scripts to avoid additional dependencies

- Correct license field

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 28 13:49:59 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.9.4:
  - There is no new functionality in this release;
    just a few bug fixes in RRSIG and SIG code.
  - Legacy code will be eliminated for earlier versions of
    DNSSEC in a future release of dnspython.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 24 19:54:53 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Fix SLE_10 build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 24 18:34:32 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.9.3:
  Bugs fixed since 1.9.2:
  - Dnspython was erroneously doing case-insensitive comparisons
    of the names in NSEC and RRSIG RRs.
  - We now use "is" and not "==" when testing what section an RR
    is in.
  - The resolver now disallows metaqueries.
  New since 1.9.2:
  - A boolean parameter, 'raise_on_no_answer', has been added to
    the query() methods.  In no-error, no-data situations, this
    parameter determines whether NoAnswer should be raised or not.
    If True, NoAnswer is raised.  If False, then an Answer()
    object with a None rrset will be returned.
  - Resolver Answer() objects now have a canonical_name field.
  - Rdata now have a __hash__ method.
- Regenerated spec file with py2pack;
- Removed LICENSE PKG-INFO and TODO files from documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 23 11:24:52 UTC 2010 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.9.2:
  - The fix for the import problems was actually bad, but didn't
    show up in testing because the test suite's conditional
    importing code hid the problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 22 13:19:59 UTC 2010 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.9.1:
  Bugs fixed since 1.9.0:
    - The dns.dnssec module didn't work with DSA due to namespace
      contamination from a "from"-style import.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 22 01:10:52 UTC 2010 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.9.0:
  New since 1.8.0:
    - dnspython now uses poll() instead of select() when available.
    - Basic DNSSEC validation can be done using dns.dnsec.validate()
      and dns.dnssec.validate_rrsig() if you have PyCrypto 2.3 or
      later installed. Complete secure resolution is not yet
      available.
    - Added key_id() to the DNSSEC module, which computes the DNSSEC
      key id of a DNSKEY rdata.
    - Added make_ds() to the DNSSEC module, which returns the DS RR
      for a given DNSKEY rdata.
    - dnspython now raises an exception if HMAC-SHA284 or
      HMAC-SHA512 are used with a Python older than 2.5.2. (Older
      Pythons do not compute the correct value.)
    - Symbolic constants are now available for TSIG algorithm names.

  Bugs fixed since 1.8.0:
    - dns.resolver.zone_for_name() didn't handle a query response
      with a CNAME or DNAME correctly in some cases.
    - When specifying rdata types and classes as text, Unicode
      strings may now be used.
    - Hashlib compatibility issues have been fixed.
    - dns.message now imports dns.edns.
    - The TSIG algorithm value was passed incorrectly to use_tsig()
      in some cases.
