  <title>Linux tool to show progress for cp, rm, dd, ...</title>
  <description>This tool can be described as a Tiny Dirty Linux Only* C command that looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar, gzip/gunzip, cat, ...) currently running on your system and displays the percentage of copied data.

It can now also display an estimated throughput (using -w flag).</description>
