# /etc/pam.d/postlogin-account - account settings common to login services
#
# This file is included from login service-specific PAM config files,
# and contains the PAM modules which should be called after
# the modules of "common-account".
#
# This file should only be included from services doing real logins,
# so like "login", "xdm" or "sshd", but not "chsh" or "cron".
