# Import of pyface.toolkit mysteriously fails. But it is needed by only one test, which needs traitsui,
# but we cannot have traitsui, because the tests invocation segfaults with traitsui installed (why?!).
# So the test would be skipped anyway, so let us just skip the import as if pyface was not there.

%description
The traits package developed by Enthought provides a special type definition
called a trait. Although they can be used as normal Python object attributes,
traits also have several additional characteristics:

 * Initialization: A trait can be assigned a default value.
 * Validation: A trait attribute's type can be explicitly declared.
 * Delegation: The value of a trait attribute can be contained either
   in another object.
 * Notification: Setting the value of a trait attribute can trigger
   notification of other parts of the program.
 * Visualization: User interfaces that permit the interactive
   modification of a trait's value can be automatically constructed
   using the trait's definition.

Part of the Enthought Tool Suite (ETS).
