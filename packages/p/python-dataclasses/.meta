  <description>This is an implementation of PEP 557, Data Classes. It is a backport for Python 3.6. Because dataclasses will be included in Python 3.7, any discussion of dataclass features should occur on the python-dev mailing list at https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev. At this point this repo should only be used for historical purposes (itâ€™s where the original dataclasses discussions took place) and for discussion of the actual backport to Python 3.6.

See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/ for the details of how Data Classes work.

A test file can be found at https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses/blob/master/test/test_dataclasses.py, or in the sdist file.</description>
