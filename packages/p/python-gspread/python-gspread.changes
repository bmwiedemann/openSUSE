Thu May 24 17:34:22 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 3.0.0
  * This version drops Google Sheets API v3 support.
    > API v4 was the default backend since version 2.0.0.
    > All v4-related code has been moved from `gspread.v4` module to `gspread` module.
- Update to 2.1.1
  * Fixed #533 (#534 by @reallistic)
- Update to 2.1.0
  * URL encode the range in the value_* functions (#530 by @aiguofer)
  * Open team drive sheets by name (#527 by @ryantuck)
- Update to 2.0.1
  * Fixed #518
  * Include v4 in setup.py
  * Fetch all spreadsheets in Spreadsheet.list_spreadsheet_files (#522 by @aiguofer)
- Update to 2.0.0
  * Ported the library to Google Sheets API v4.
    This is a transition release. The v3-related code is untouched,
    but v4 is used by default. It is encouraged to move to v4 since
    the API is faster and has more features.
    API v4 is a significant change from v3. Some methods are not
    backward compatible, so there's no support for this compatibility
    in gspread either.
    These methods and properties are not supported in v4:
    > `Spreadsheet.updated`
    > `Worksheet.updated`
    > `Worksheet.export()`
    > `Cell.input_value`
