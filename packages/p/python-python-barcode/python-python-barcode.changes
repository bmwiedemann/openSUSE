- Update to 0.14.0
  * Breaking: The default dimensions have changed slightly. This is
    so that the results of generating a PNG and an SVG look more
    alike.
  * Previous versions included an empty text element for SVGs with
    no comment. This is no longer the case.
  * Some internals have been improved so as to allow better
    subclassing. Subclasses of Barcode can now override
    default_writer_options and default_writer().
  * A guardbar parameter has been added to EAN barcodes. This
    renders barcodes with guardars (longer bars).
  * Added support for Python 3.10.
  * The documentation setup has been redone, hopefully squashing a
    lot of legacy quirks.
  * Previous versions installed the tests module. This was not
    intentional and have been fixed.
- Remove ancient pathlib dependency

Mon Oct 26 04:08:04 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.13.1:
  * Fix a crash when using the generate shortcut function.
  * Added support for transparent backgrounds. This is done by setting the
    mode option for a writer to RGBA.
  * Removed writer_options from barcode.get. This parameter was not used.
  * Add a with_doctype flag to SVGWriter. Set this to false to avoid including
    a DOCTYPE in the resulting SVG.
  * Add support for Pillow>=8.0.0.

- version update to 0.11.0
  * Added basic support for multiline text.
  * Dropped lots of older compat-only code and other cleanups.
  * Fixed a bug in the API when combining certain barcodes and writers.
  * Published documentation again and updated all project references.
  * Fix python_barcode.get mixups between options as writer_options. Previously, some writer/barcode combinations worked fine, while others failed. Now all work consistently.
  * The cli tool has been fixed and should now work as expected again.
