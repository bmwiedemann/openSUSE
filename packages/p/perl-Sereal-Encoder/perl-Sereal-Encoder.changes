- updated to 4.025
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Sereal-Encoder/Changes

  4.025 Thr Jul 28, 2022
      * Release with build fixes for the Decoder under threaded
        perls and MANIFEST update.

  4.024 Wed Jul 27, 2022
      * Changes to the FREEZE/THAW mechanism. Remove the part that
        says that FREEZE cannot return a list. It can, and we have
        supported it for a very long time, although I have not checked
        how far back this support goes. If you use the FREEZE/THAW
        API's you should upgrade to this version.
      * Test fixes for t/020_sort_keys.t hanging on some perls
        which do not come bundled with Hash::Util.

      * Make it possible to upgrade with passing tests when using
        Sereal::Decoder 4.015 - 4.019 on threaded debugging perls.
        IF YOU USE THREADED PERLS YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO UPDATE
        TO THIS VERSION OR LATER. *UPGRADE THE DECODER IMMEDIATELY.*
  4.022 Sat Feb 19, 2022
  4.021 Fri Feb 18, 2022
      * Early but incomplete versions of 4.023, skip these releases.
  4.020 Thurs Feb 17, 2022
      * Fix "panic: free from wrong pool" errors on threaded debugging builds.
        This error is only visible on DEBUGGING perls however it exists
        regardless. If you are using a threaded build upgrade to this!
        Thanks to Andreas J. Koenig for finding the bug, and Nicholas Clark
        for suggesting valgrind to debug and fix it.

  3.008 Nov 27 2015
    * FIX: Make sure that reserializing a data structure created
      using alias_varint_under does not produce a corrupted dataset.
      Thanks to Iskra for the report.
    * FIX: Precedence issue related to sort keys options. Thanks
      to Petr Písař <ppisar@redhat.com> for the report and fix.
    * FIX: Win32 build issues, thanks to bulk88 for help.
  
  3.007 Nov 26 2015
    * FIX: sorting should now work with tied hashes, and
      be in general faster.
    * CHANGED: Sort order for sort_keys=1 is now defined to be
      "in order by length of bytes, then by byte order of the 
      underlying string, then by utd8ness, with non-utf8 first". 
      This sort order was chosen because it requires the least 
      operations to perform in the most cases, has a bounded number
      of cases where we would have to create any temporary SV's or 
      to do operations that require us to introspect codepoints in
      utf8 strings. IOW purely performance. Note that so long
      as you compare data created with the same sort_keys setting
      you will ALWAYS get the same order *in process*, regardless
      of what you choose. Backwards compatible support for  the
      old order is available via sort_keys=3.
      
      ADDED: sort_keys=2 to provide "perl cmp order"
             (Its just there because it is easy to do, not for any
              good reason.)
      ADDED: sort_keys=3 to provide "rev perl cmp order"
  
      Legacy sort order was equivalent to sort_keys=3, use this 
      option *ONLY* if you are extremely sensitive to changes in the
      sorted order (or "canonical form").
  
    * [DECODER] Build fixes for boxes without any Sereal installed (it seems
      to be common on certain types of smokers, and not on others).
    * Fix issues with serializing blessed scalars where we see the
      blessed scalar before we see the reference to it.
    * Handle PVLV undefs
    * Build fixes for 5.8.9
    * Doc patches
    * Optimizations

  3.006 Nov 14 2015
    * [DECODER] fix segfaults from heavily corrupted data. Guards
      against various pathological cases which could cause segfaults
      fixed. Thanks to Damian Gryski and "fuzzing sereal with afl"
      for finding these cases.
    * [ENCODER] Various subtle fixes to how we choose whether to serialize
      the string or numeric version of a value, in particular to
      ensure that "00" always round trips as "00", and related issues.
      Note this fix has correctness and performance consequences. In
      some cases values that used to serialized as integers (arguably
      incorrectly) will be serialized as strings instead, and some code
      maybe be slower to serialize.
      NOTE: Some issues related to this subject are not fixable without
      a protocol change. In particular this change may affect the behavior
      of code that uses binary logical operators on values serialized
      with Perl.
      Thanks to Zefram, Tom, and others for help with this issue.
    * Fixups for cast warnings under -Wint-to-ptr builds by using
      using PTR2INT and INT2PTR for casting our objects.
    * Win32 fixes
    * Build improvements
    * Changes to how we generate constants
