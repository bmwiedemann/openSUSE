- Update to version 3.3.7 
  * Bugs
    Dev Server
    Remove frontend javascript rebuild machinery altogether. Since the frontend source code is not included in distributed Lektor
    wheels this was breaking LEKTOR_DEV functionality for all but those running Lektor from git. (#1072)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 27 22:19:50 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.3.6:
  - Spurious edit page scrolling when typing in textareas is now
    (hopefully) fixed.
  - Fixed the edit hotkey (<ctl>-e or <meta>-e on a Mac) so that
    it works again.
  - The save hotkey (<ctl>-s or equivalent) in the edit view now
    always switches to the preview view.

- Update to 3.3.5:
  - Backport #1044. Fixes 404 from admin server for /admin.
  - Backport #1033. Fixes TypeError from click==8.1.3.
  - Back-port #1019: fixes for werkzeug 2.1.0.
- Update to 3.3.2:
  - Enabled the Jinja debug extension when the LEKTOR_DEV env var
    is set to 1 and lektor server is used. (#984)
  - The wording in the LICENSE file was standardized to that of
    the current BSD 3-Clause License. (#972)
  - Fix overzealous HTML-entity escaping of link and image
    attributes. (#989)
  - Fix a bug in make_editor_session when editing non-existant
    pages with a non-primary alt. (#964)
  - Fix the ability to add an initial flowblock to a
    page. (Broken in 3.3.1.)
  - Refactor API views to move business logic back into the Tree
    adapter (#967). This fixes #962.
  - Changed the structure of the URLs used by the GUI single-page
    app (#976). This fixes problems with the "edit" pencil when
    using alternatives (#975), and issues when page ids include
    colons (#610).
  - Other React refactors and fixes (#988).
  - Fix Attachment.url_path when alternatives are in use. There
    is only one copy of each attachment emitted — the url_path
    should always be that corresponding to the primary
    alternative. (#958)
  - Pad.get, if not passed an explicit value for the alt
    parameter, now returns the record for the primary alternative
    rather than the fallback record. Similarly, Pad.root now
    returns the root record for the primary alternative. (#958,
    #965)
  - Fix for uncaught OSError(error=EINVAL) on Windows when
    Pad.get was called with a path containing characters which
    are not allowed in Windows filenames (e.g. <>*?|\/":).
  - Pages now record a build dependency on their datamodel .ini
    file.
  - Fix sqlite version detection so that we use "without rowid"
    optimization with current versions of sqlite. (#1002)
  - When running lektor dev new-theme: fix check for ability to
    create symlinks under Windows. (#996)
  - Fix rsync publisher when deletion enabled on macOS. (#946,
    #954)
  - Fix for test failures when git is not installed. (#998,
    #1000)
  - Cleaned up EditorSession to split mapping methods (for
    access to record data) to a separate class, now available as
    EditorSession.data. (#969)
  - Cleaned up and moved our pylint and coverage configuration to
    pyproject.toml. (#990, #991)
  - Move frontend source from lektor/admin/static/
    to frontend/. Compiled frontend code moved from
    lektor/admin/static/gen/ to 'lektor/admin/static/`. (#1003)
  - Omit example subdirectory, frontend source code,
    developer-centric config files, as well as other assorted
    cruft from sdist. (#986)
- Update to 3.3.1:
  - Fixed an import cycle which caused in ImportError if
    lektor.types was imported before lektor.environemnt. #974
  - Disuse deprecated Thread.setDaemon(). #979
  - Fix spastic scroll behavior when editing flow elements. #640
  - Fix admin GUI when page contains an unknown flowblock
    type. #968
  - Fix admin GUI layout on mobile devices. #981
  - Increased timeout in test_watcher.IterateInThread to prevent
    random spurious failures during CI testing.
  - Fix tests/test_prev_next_sibling.py so as to allow running
    multiple test runs in parallel.
  - Use per-testenv coverage files to prevent contention when
    running tox --parallel.
  - Mark tests that require a working internet connections with
    pytest mark requiresinternet. #983
  - Finish rewriting React class-based components to
    function-based components. #977
  - Finish adding types for all API endpoints. #980
  - Remove disused event-source polyfill.
- Remove upstreamed patch skip-network-tests.patch.

- Upgrade to 3.3.0:

    3.6. In particular, Python 2.7 is no longer supported.
  - Quite a few bugs have been fixed since the previous release.

    performance optimisations. It has been rewritten in
    Typescript, and updated to use v5 of the Bootstrap CSS

    package work with mistune 2.*
  - skip-network-tests.patch (gh#lektor/lektor#982) we build in
