  - Fix off-by-one error in pagination's iter_pages in the
    interpretation of the right_current argument, and adding an
    appropriate trailing None for some uses.
  - Add support for setting an output_path in the project file.
  - Replaced the slugify backend to handle unicode more effectively.
    This should mean greater language support, but it may produce
    slightly different results in some cases.

  - Improved speed of source info updates.
  - Set colorspace to sRGB for thumbnails.
  - Now stripping profiles and comments from thumbnails.

    dots.

    extracted from EXIFs.
  - Added the ability to collapse flow elements in the admin UI.
  - Now extra_flags is passed to all plugin events.
  - Extra flags can now be passed to the clean and dev shell CLI
    commands.
  - Bugfix where lektor plugins reinstall triggered on_setup_env instead
    of just reinstalling plugins.
  - Added the ability to generate video thumbnails with ffmpeg.
  - Added mode and upscale thumbnail arguments, changing the preferred
    crop method to using mode. mode can be crop, fit, or stretch.
    upscale=False can now prevent upscaling.
  - Added a new CLI command lektor dev new-theme.
  - Made admin use full UTF-8 version of RobotoSlab. Fixes missing
    glyphs for some languages
  - Bumped minimum Jinja2 version to 2.11
  - Bumped filetype dependency to 1.0.7 because of API changes
  - Relative urls are now as short as possible.
  - Automatically include setup.cfg configured for universal wheels when
    creating plugins
