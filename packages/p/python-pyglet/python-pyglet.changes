Thu Feb 15 14:01:06 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 14 16:21:19 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.3.1
  + Bugfixes
    * #158 Fix mouse events in mouse exclusive mode on Windows.
    * #105 Crashes in PulseAudio;
    * #163 Workaround for running inside Spyder;
    * #45  Expose viewport size for use on HiDPI screens;
    * #15  Respect keyboard layout on macOS;
- Update to version 1.3.0
  * The entire codebase is now compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3 without the need for 2to3.
  + New features
    *  The procedural audio module is now more usable. This module allows synthesis of basic
      waveforms, such as sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, and simple FM (two operator sine).
      In addition, several basic amplitude envelopes are now available to apply to generated audio.
      These include ADSR, linear decay, tremolo, and flat envelopes.
  + Improvements
    * Improved font rendering for fonts with negative bearing (#99)
    * Sprites now have `scale_x` and `scale_y` attributes, allowing for aspect ratio changes. The 
      existing `scale` attribute sets the overall scaling, and functions as before.
    * Sprites have a new `update` method which allows simultaneous changing of position, scale, and
      rotation. This reduces some overhead when changing multiple attributes at once.
    * The pyglet.resource module now defaults to a 2048x2048 texture for it's internal texture atlas,
      but will fall back to the maximum available size that the GPU can provide.
    * All modern joysticks and game controllers should now be detected on Linux and Windows.
    * Refactored and reimplemented pyglet.media. Many improvements to stability. Different drivers
      should now behave more similar.
    * WM_CLASS hints are now set on Linux. On modern Linux desktop environments and window managers,
      this allows for proper tracking of pyglet applications. Previously, pyglet apps may show up as
      "Unknown" under the active window list in the environment. The window class hints are set
      to the same name as the Window caption, but will fall back to "pyglet" if the Window caption
      contains non-ascii characters.
    * Vastly improved documentation and programming guide.
  + Bugfixes
    * Limit the minimum window size 1x1 pixel, preventing an OpenGL exception when resizing (#49).
    * Font module no longer leaks memory when text is changed (#66).
    * Fix crash on Python 2 when sys.argv[0] has non-ASCII characters (#74).
    * Windows: Fix crash when opening multiple windows in succession (#81).
    * Windows: Fix local font loading (#100).
    * Windows: Italic fonts no longer render parts of their neighbors.
    * Prevent memory leak from orphaned StreamingSources in long running applications (#103).
    * Windows: Fix kerning regression (#115)
    * Windows: Window.set_icon no longer fails when given a Texture instead of ImageData (#136)
