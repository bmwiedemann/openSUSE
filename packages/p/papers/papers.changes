Fri Feb  7 09:44:18 UTC 2025 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 48.beta:
  + The location of the shell and the Rust bindings changed after
    the shell's Rust port was completed.
  + Papers minimum required Poppler version did not change, however
    to support free text annotations Poppler >= 25.02 is required
    with a detection at build time only.
  + The PostScript and XPS document formats have been dropped.
    Papers has a modular plugin system that allows implementing
    support for those formats out-of-tree. If there are users still
    interested in those formats, feel free to reach out to us, so
    we can help you setup maintenance out-of-tree, and make sure we
    don't break them. However, we recommend transforming any old
    documents you might still have in those formats, to other more
    appropriate and moderns formats still read by the Papers'
    default configuration. For PostScript, there has been a
    previous discussion to which you can contribute (#151). For
    XPS, there has been no previous public consideration, but the
    format seems to never have gained traction and is deprecated
    elsewhere.
  + Simplified printing job handling relying more on GTK's
    implementation
  + After supporting digitially signing in 47, we now have the
    counterpart of digital signature verification.
  + Redesign of annotation windows
  + Improved context menu for annotation
  + Replaced caret mode confirmation dialog with toast
  + Create text annotations in a single action
  + Removed bookmarks sidebar completely. Did not follow current
    mock-ups, and the way bookmarks were stored locally had
    multiple issues. Both UI and backend would need to be written
    from scratch.
  + The night mode now preserves hue and only adjust the
    luminosity. From now on this is no longer a per-document
    setting is retained across open and future windows.
  + Finished Rust port of shell
  + Supporting free text and stamp annotations
  + Add support for libspelling
  + Update attachment sidebar UI
  + Fixes:
    - text selection does not copy content with middle mouse button
    - support help action in Flatpak's bubblewrap sandbox
    - handle switching between fullscreen and presentation mode
      correctly
    - nearest search result not scrolled to if it's the first one
- Stop passing ps=enabled to meson setup, ps support dropped
  upstream.
- Add pkgconfig(libspelling-1) BuildRequires: New dependency.
- Drop sub-packages: libppsshell4-5, plugin-psdocument and
  plugin-xpsdocument following upstream changes.
