  <title>add/extend SSL support for common perl modules</title>
  <description>Some commonly used perl modules don't have SSL support at all, even if the
protocol supports it. Others have SSL support, but most of them don't do
proper checking of the server's certificate.

The 'Net::SSLGlue::*' modules try to add SSL support or proper certificate
checking to these modules. Currently support for the following modules is
available:

* Net::SMTP - add SSL from beginning or using STARTTLS

* Net::LDAP - add proper certificate checking

* LWP - add proper certificate checking</description>
