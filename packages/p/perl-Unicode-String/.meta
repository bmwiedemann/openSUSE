  <title>String of Unicode characters (UCS2/UTF16)</title>
  <description>A Unicode::String object represents a sequence of Unicode characters.
The Unicode Standard is a fixed-width, uniform encoding scheme for
written characters and text. This encoding treats alphabetic
characters, ideographic characters, and symbols identically, which
means that they can be used in any mixture and with equal facility. 
Unicode is modeled on the ASCII character set, but uses a 16-bit
encoding to support full multilingual text.</description>
