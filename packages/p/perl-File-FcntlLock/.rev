    <comment>- updated to 0.20
     - Problem on GNU Hurd hopefully fixed and some cosmetic changes.
 
 0.19  Tue May 27 2014
     - Builds failed on 32-bit systems due to missing CFLAGS derived
       from the Perl installation.
 
 0.18  Mon May 26 2014
     - CPAN didn't find the version number in FcntlLock.pm which
       was derived from that of Core.pm:-(
 
 0.17  Mon May 26 2014
     - CPAN testing showed that there are 32-bit systems where the
       off_t member of the flock struct is a 64-bit integer but Perl
       doesn't support the 'q' format for pack() and unpack(). On these
       systems there seem to be no good way of assembling a flock
       structure useing &quot;pure Perl&quot; and thus the File::FcntlLock::Pure
        and File::FcntlLock::Inline modules won't get installed.
 
 0.16  Sun May 25 2014
     - Missing file in 0.15, Pure.pm, in MANIFEST added.
 
 0.15  Thu May 20 2014
     - Module rewritten as three modules, one working
       exactly as before, and two new ones that instead of
       being XS-based use Perl code. For the first one the
       Perl code for packing/unpacking the C flock struct is
       generated when 'perl Makefile.PL' is run. For the other
       a C program is created, compiled and run each time the
       module gets loaded. This is in response to some concerns</comment>
