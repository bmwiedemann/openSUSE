- updated to 0.20
     - Problem on GNU Hurd hopefully fixed and some cosmetic changes.
 
 0.19  Tue May 27 2014
     - Builds failed on 32-bit systems due to missing CFLAGS derived
       from the Perl installation.
 
 0.18  Mon May 26 2014
     - CPAN didn't find the version number in FcntlLock.pm which
       was derived from that of Core.pm:-(
 
 0.17  Mon May 26 2014
     - CPAN testing showed that there are 32-bit systems where the
       off_t member of the flock struct is a 64-bit integer but Perl
       doesn't support the 'q' format for pack() and unpack(). On these
       systems there seem to be no good way of assembling a flock
       structure useing "pure Perl" and thus the File::FcntlLock::Pure
        and File::FcntlLock::Inline modules won't get installed.
 
 0.16  Sun May 25 2014
     - Missing file in 0.15, Pure.pm, in MANIFEST added.
 
 0.15  Thu May 20 2014
     - Module rewritten as three modules, one working
       exactly as before, and two new ones that instead of
       being XS-based use Perl code. For the first one the
       Perl code for packing/unpacking the C flock struct is
       generated when 'perl Makefile.PL' is run. For the other
       a C program is created, compiled and run each time the
       module gets loaded. This is in response to some concerns
       the Debian dpkg package managers (who use the module) had
       for certain circumstances when new Perl versions need to
       be installed (as far as I understand;-)
