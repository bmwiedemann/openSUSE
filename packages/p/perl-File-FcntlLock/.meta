  <title>File locking with fcntl(2)</title>
  <description>File locking in Perl is usually done using the the flock() manpage
function. Unfortunately, this only allows locks on whole files and is often
implemented in terms of flock(2), which has some shortcomings.

Using this module file locking via fcntl(2) can be done.
