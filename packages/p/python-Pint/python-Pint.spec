%description
Pint is Python module/package to define, operate and manipulate physical
quantities, the product of a numerical value and a unit of measurement.
It allows arithmetic operations between them and conversions from and
to different units.

It is distributed with a comprehensive list of physical units, prefixes
and constants. Due to it's modular design, you to extend (or even rewrite!)
the complete list without changing the source code.
