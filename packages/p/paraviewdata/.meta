  <description>ParaView is an application designed with the need to visualize large data
sets in mind.

ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as single
processor systems and has been successfully tested on Windows, Linux and
various Unix workstations and clusters. Under the hood, ParaView uses the
Visualization Toolkit as the data processing and rendering engine and has a
user interface written using a unique blend of Tcl/Tk and C++.

This package contains some example data for Paraview.
