%description
This package contains a generic BTrees implementation for Python. It is
mainly used by the ZODB, though.

Note that the data manager API, BTrees.interfaces.IDataManager, is
syntactically simple, but semantically complex. The semantics were not easy to
express in the interface. This could probably use more work. The semantics are
presented in detail through examples of a sample data manager in
BTrees.tests.test_SampleDataManager.
