-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  6 17:30:11 UTC 2022 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- version update to 4.11.0 (2022-11-03):
  * Add support for Python 3.11.
- version update to 4.10.1 (2022-09-12):
  * Disable unsafe math optimizations in C code. (#184)
- version update to 4.10.0 (2022-03-09):
  * Add support for Python 3.10.
- version update to 4.9.2 (2021-06-09):
  * Fix fsBTree.TreeSet and fsBTree.BTree raising SystemError. See
    issue 170.
  * Fix all the fsBTree objects to provide the correct interfaces
    and be instances of the appropriate collection ABCs. This was
    done for the other modules in release 4.8.0.
  * Fix the multiunion, union, intersection, and difference
    functions when used with arbitrary iterables. Previously, the
    iterable had to be pre-sorted, meaning only sequences like list
    and tuple could reliably be used; this was not documented
    though. If the iterable wasn’t sorted, the function would
    produce garbage output. Now, if the function detects an
    arbitrary iterable, it automatically sorts a copy.
- version update to 4.9.1 (2021-05-27):
  * Fix setting unknown class attributes on subclasses of BTrees
    when using the C extension. This prevented subclasses from
    being decorated with @component.adapter(). See issue 168.
- version update to 4.9.0 (2021-05-26):
  * Fix the C implementation to match the Python implementation and
    allow setting custom node sizes for an entire application
    directly by changing BTree.max_leaf_size and
    BTree.max_internal_size attributes, without having to create a
    new subclass. These attributes can now also be read from the
    classes in the C implementation. See issue 166.
  * Add various small performance improvements for storing
    zope.interface attributes on BTree and TreeSet as well as
    deactivating persistent objects from this package.
- disable more tests, that suffer from the same problem as 
  testPurePython

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 13 07:09:07 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add missing Provides

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 18 07:13:46 UTC 2021 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 4.8.0
  * Make Python 2 forbid the use of type objects as keys (unless a
    custom metaclass is used that implements comparison as required by
    BTrees.) On Python 3, types are not orderable so they were already
    forbidden, but on Python 2 types can be ordered by memory address,
    which makes them unsuitable for use as keys. See `issue
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/153>`_.
  * Make the ``multiunion``, ``union``, ``intersection``, and
    ``difference`` functions accept arbitrary Python iterables (that
    iterate across the correct types). Previously, the Python
    implementation allowed this, but the C implementation only allowed
    objects (like ``TreeSet`` or ``Bucket``) defined in the same module
    providing the function. See `issue 24
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/24>`_.
  * Fix persistency bug in the Python version
    (`#118 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/118>`_).
  * Fix ``Tree.__setstate__`` to no longer accept children besides
    tree or bucket types to prevent crashes. See `PR 143
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/pull/143>`_ for details.
  * Make BTrees, TreeSet, Set and Buckets implements the ``__and__``,
    ``__or__`` and ``__sub__`` special methods as shortcuts for
    ``BTrees.Interfaces.IMerge.intersection``,
    ``BTrees.Interfaces.IMerge.union`` and
    ``BTrees.Interfaces.IMerge.difference``.
  * Add support for Python 3.9.
  * Build and upload aarch64 wheels.
  * Make a value of ``0`` in the ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable
    require the C extensions (except on PyPy). Previously, and if this
    variable is unset, missing or unusable C extensions would be
    silently ignored. With this variable set to ``0``, an
    ``ImportError`` will be raised if the C extensions are unavailable.
    See `issue 156
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/156>`_.
  * Make the BTree objects (``BTree``, ``TreeSet``, ``Set``, ``Bucket``)
    of each module actually provide the interfaces defined in
    ``BTrees.Interfaces``. Previously, they provided no interfaces.
  * Make all the BTree and Bucket objects instances of
    ``collections.abc.MutableMapping`` (that is, ``isinstance(btree,
    MutableMapping)`` is now true; no actual inheritance has changed).
    As part of this, they now provide the ``popitem()`` method.
  * Make all the TreeSet and Set objects instances of
    ``collections.abc.MutableSet`` (that is, ``isinstance(tree_set,
    MutableSet)`` is now true; no actual inheritance has changed).
    As part of this, they now provide several more methods, including
    ``isdisjoint``, ``discard``, and ``pop``, and support in-place
    mutation operators such as ``tree_set |= other``, ``tree_set +=
    other``, ``tree_set -= other`` and ``tree_set ^= other``. See `issue
    121 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/121>`_.
  * Update the definitions of ``ISized`` and ``IReadSequence`` to simply
    be ``zope.interface.common.collections.ISized`` and
    ``zope.interface.common.sequence.IMinimalSequence`` respectively.
  * Remove the ``__nonzero__`` interface method from ``ICollection``. No
    objects actually implemented such a method; instead, the boolean value
    is typically taken from ``__len__``.
  * Adjust the definition of ``ISet`` to produce the same resolution
    order under the C3 and legacy orderings. This means that the legacy
    order has changed slightly, but that this package emits no warnings
    when ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_LOG_CHANGED_IRO=1``. Note that the legacy
    order was not being used for these objects because the C3 ordering
    was still consistent; it could only be obtained using
    ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_USE_LEGACY_IRO=1``. See `PR 159
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/pull/159>`_ for all the
    interface updates.
  * Fix the ``get``, ``setdefault`` and ``pop`` methods, as well as the
    ``in`` operator, to not suppress ``POSKeyError`` if the object or
    subobjects are corrupted. Previously, such errors were logged by
    ZODB, but not propagated. See `issue 161
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/161>`_.

Tue Apr 14 09:19:56 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Do not bother with documentation
- Update to 4.7.2:
  * Fix more cases of C and Python inconsistency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 16:00:38 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 4.7.1
  * Ensure the interface resolution order of all objects is consistent.
    See `issue 137 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/137>`_.
  * Add unsigned variants of the trees. These use the initial "U" for
    32-bit data and "Q" for 64-bit data (for "quad", which is similar to
    what the C ``printf`` function uses and the Python struct module
    uses).
  * Fix the value for ``BTrees.OIBTree.using64bits`` when using the pure Python
    implementation (PyPy and when ``PURE_PYTHON`` is in the environment).
  * Make the errors that are raised when values are out of range more
    consistent between Python 2 and Python 3 and between 32-bit and
    64-bit variants.
  * Make the Bucket types consistent with the BTree types as updated in
    versions 4.3.2: Querying for keys with default comparisons or that
    are not integers no longer raises ``TypeError``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 13 14:30:27 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 4.6.1
  * Add support for Python 3.8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  5 11:36:26 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 4.6.0
  * Drop support for Python 3.4.
  * Fix tests against persistent 4.4.
  * Stop accidentally installing the 'terryfy' package in macOS wheels.
    See `issue 98
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/98>`_.
  * Fix segmentation fault in ``bucket_repr()``.  See
    `issue 106 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issue/106>`_.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 10 11:14:42 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Update to v4.5.1
  + Use pyproject.toml to specify build dependencies. This requires pip
    18 or later to build from source.
- 4.5.0
  + Add support for Python 3.6 and 3.7, and drop support for Python 3.3.
  + Raise an ``ImportError`` consistently on Python 3 if the C extension for
    BTrees is used but the ``persistent`` C extension is not available.
    Previously this could result in an odd ``AttributeError``.
  + Fix the possibility of a rare crash in the C extension when
    deallocating items.
  + Respect the ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable at runtime even if
    the C extensions are available.
  + Always attempt to build the C extensions, but make their success
    optional.
  + Fix a ``DeprecationWarning`` that could come from I and L objects in
    Python 2 in pure-Python mode.

Mon Jul 10 11:19:10 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Fix duplicate summaries

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 24 12:19:41 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 4.4.1
  * Fixed a packaging bug that caused extra files to be included
    (some of which caused problems in some platforms).
  4.4.0:
  * Allow None as a special key (sorted smaller than all others).
  * This is a bit of a return to BTrees 3 behavior in that Nones
    are allowed as keys again. Other objects with default ordering
    are still not allowed as keys.
  4.3.2:
  * Make the CPython implementation consistent with the
    pure-Python implementation and only check object keys for
    default comparison when setting keys. In Python 2 this makes it
    possible to remove keys that were added using a less restrictive
    version of BTrees. (In Python 3 keys that are unorderable still
    cannot be removed.) Likewise, all versions can unpickle trees
    that already had such keys. See:
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/53 and
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/51
  * Make the Python implementation consistent with the CPython
    implementation and check object key identity before checking
    equality and performing comparisons. This can allow fixing trees
    that have keys that now have broken comparison functions. See
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/50
  * Make the CPython implementation consistent with the
    pure-Python implementation and no longer raise TypeError for an
    object key (in object-keyed trees) with default comparison on
    __getitem__, get or in operations. Instead, the results will be
    a KeyError, the default value, and False, respectively.
    Previously, CPython raised a TypeError in those cases, while the
    Python implementation behaved as specified.
  * Likewise, non-integer keys in integer-keyed trees will raise
    KeyError, return the default and return False, respectively, in
    both implementations. Previously, pure-Python raised a KeyError,
    returned the default, and raised a TypeError, while CPython
    raised TypeError in all three cases.
  4.3.1:
  * Packaging: fix password used to automate wheel creation on
    Travis.
  4.3.0:
  * Fix unexpected OverflowError when passing 64bit values to
    long keys / values on Win64. See:
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/32
  * When testing PURE_PYTHON environments under tox, avoid
    poisoning the user’s global wheel cache.
  * Ensure that the pure-Python implementation, used on PyPy and
    when a C compiler isn’t available for CPython, pickles
    identically to the C version. Unpickling will choose the best
    available implementation. This change prevents interoperability
    problems and database corruption if both implementations are in
    use. While it is no longer possible to pickle a Python
    implementation and have it unpickle to the Python implementation
    if the C implementation is available, existing Python pickles
    will still unpickle to the Python implementation (until pickled
    again). See: https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/19
  * Avoid creating invalid objects when unpickling empty BTrees
    in a pure-Python environment.
  * Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.
  4.2.0:
  * Add support for Python 3.5.
  4.1.4:
  * Ensure that pure-Python Bucket and Set objects have a human
    readable __repr__ like the C versions.
  4.1.3:
  * Fix _p_changed when removing items from small pure-Python
    BTrees/TreeSets and when adding items to small pure-Python Sets.
    See: https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/13
