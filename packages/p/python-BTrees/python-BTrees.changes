- version update to 4.6.0
  * Drop support for Python 3.4.
  * Fix tests against persistent 4.4.
  * Stop accidentally installing the 'terryfy' package in macOS wheels.
    See `issue 98
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/98>`_.
  * Fix segmentation fault in ``bucket_repr()``.  See
    `issue 106 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issue/106>`_.

- Update to v4.5.1
  + Use pyproject.toml to specify build dependencies. This requires pip
    18 or later to build from source.
- 4.5.0
  + Add support for Python 3.6 and 3.7, and drop support for Python 3.3.
  + Raise an ``ImportError`` consistently on Python 3 if the C extension for
    BTrees is used but the ``persistent`` C extension is not available.
    Previously this could result in an odd ``AttributeError``.
  + Fix the possibility of a rare crash in the C extension when
    deallocating items.
  + Respect the ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable at runtime even if
    the C extensions are available.
  + Always attempt to build the C extensions, but make their success
    optional.
  + Fix a ``DeprecationWarning`` that could come from I and L objects in
    Python 2 in pure-Python mode.

- Update to version 4.4.1
  * Fixed a packaging bug that caused extra files to be included
    (some of which caused problems in some platforms).
  4.4.0:
  * Allow None as a special key (sorted smaller than all others).
  * This is a bit of a return to BTrees 3 behavior in that Nones
    are allowed as keys again. Other objects with default ordering
    are still not allowed as keys.
  4.3.2:
  * Make the CPython implementation consistent with the
    pure-Python implementation and only check object keys for
    default comparison when setting keys. In Python 2 this makes it
    possible to remove keys that were added using a less restrictive
    version of BTrees. (In Python 3 keys that are unorderable still
    cannot be removed.) Likewise, all versions can unpickle trees
    that already had such keys. See:
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/53 and
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/51
  * Make the Python implementation consistent with the CPython
    implementation and check object key identity before checking
    equality and performing comparisons. This can allow fixing trees
    that have keys that now have broken comparison functions. See
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/50
  * Make the CPython implementation consistent with the
    pure-Python implementation and no longer raise TypeError for an
    object key (in object-keyed trees) with default comparison on
    __getitem__, get or in operations. Instead, the results will be
    a KeyError, the default value, and False, respectively.
    Previously, CPython raised a TypeError in those cases, while the
    Python implementation behaved as specified.
  * Likewise, non-integer keys in integer-keyed trees will raise
    KeyError, return the default and return False, respectively, in
    both implementations. Previously, pure-Python raised a KeyError,
    returned the default, and raised a TypeError, while CPython
    raised TypeError in all three cases.
  4.3.1:
  * Packaging: fix password used to automate wheel creation on
    Travis.
  4.3.0:
  * Fix unexpected OverflowError when passing 64bit values to
    long keys / values on Win64. See:
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/32
  * When testing PURE_PYTHON environments under tox, avoid
    poisoning the user’s global wheel cache.
  * Ensure that the pure-Python implementation, used on PyPy and
    when a C compiler isn’t available for CPython, pickles
    identically to the C version. Unpickling will choose the best
    available implementation. This change prevents interoperability
    problems and database corruption if both implementations are in
    use. While it is no longer possible to pickle a Python
    implementation and have it unpickle to the Python implementation
    if the C implementation is available, existing Python pickles
    will still unpickle to the Python implementation (until pickled
    again). See: https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/19
  * Avoid creating invalid objects when unpickling empty BTrees
    in a pure-Python environment.
  * Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.
  4.2.0:
  * Add support for Python 3.5.
  4.1.4:
  * Ensure that pure-Python Bucket and Set objects have a human
    readable __repr__ like the C versions.
  4.1.3:
  * Fix _p_changed when removing items from small pure-Python
    BTrees/TreeSets and when adding items to small pure-Python Sets.
    See: https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/13

- update to version 4.1.2:
  * Suppress testing 64-bit values in OLBTrees on 32 bit machines.
  * Fix _p_changed for small pure-Python BTrees.
- make the tests less verbose to avoid spamming the build log

- version 4.1.1

  - 4.1.1 (2014-12-27)
    Accomodate long values in pure-Python OLBTrees.

  - 4.1.0 (2014-12-26)
    Add support for PyPy and PyPy3.
    Add support for Python 3.4.
    BTree subclasses can define max_leaf_size or max_internal_size to control
    maximum sizes for Bucket/Set and BTree/TreeSet nodes.  Detect integer overflow
    on 32-bit machines correctly under Python 3.  Update pure-Python and C trees /
    sets to accept explicit None to indicate max / min value for minKey, maxKey.
    PR #3) Update pure-Python trees / sets to accept explicit None to indicate
    pen ranges for keys, values, items. (PR #3)
