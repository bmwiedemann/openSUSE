  <title>&quot;Off The Record&quot; end-to-end encryption plugin for gaim</title>
  <description>This is a gaim plugin which implements Off-the-Record (OTR)
   Messaging. OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM
   by providing: - Encryption

- No one else can read your instant messages.

- Authentication

- You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.

- Deniability

- The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
   checkable by a third party.	Anyone can forge messages after a
   conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
   _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the
   messages he sees are authentic and unmodified.

- Perfect forward secrecy

- If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation is
compromised.</description>
