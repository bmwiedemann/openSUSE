  Deprecations
  * .Pelias: deprecate country_bias param, use countries
  * instead. (#504)

- version update to 2.2.0
  New Features
  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  - :class:`.OpenCage`: added ``annotations`` param.
    Contributed by mtmail. (:issue:`464`)
  - :class:`.Photon`: added ``bbox`` param.
    Contributed by Holger Bruch. (:issue:`472`)

    Contributed by Jon Duckworth. (:issue:`468`)
  - New geocoder: :class:`.HereV7`.
    Contributed by Pratheek Rebala. (:issue:`433`)
  - New geocoder: :class:`.What3WordsV3`.
    Contributed by Saïd Tezel. (:issue:`444`)
  - New error class: :class:`.exc.GeocoderRateLimited`. This error extends
    :class:`.exc.GeocoderQuotaExceeded` and is now raised instead of it
    for HTTP 422 error code. (:issue:`479`)
  - :class:`.AdapterHTTPError`: added ``headers`` attribute. (:issue:`479`)
  Breaking Changes
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Removed GeocodeFarm class: the service is very unstable. (:issue:`445`)
  
  Deprecations
  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  - :class:`.GoogleV3` has been moved from ``geopy.geocoders.googlev3`` module
    to ``geopy.geocoders.google``. The old module is still present for
    backwards compatibility, but it will be removed in geopy 3. (:issue:`483`)
  Bugfixes
  ~~~~~~~
  - :class:`.OpenCage`: improved error handling by using the default errors map
    (e.g. to raise :class:`.exc.GeocoderQuotaExceeded` instead of
    :class:`.exc.GeocoderQueryError` for HTTP 402 error). (:issue:`479`)

  + New Features
    - Add support for leading plus sign in the .Point constructor.
    - Contributed by Azimjon Pulatov. (#448)
  + Breaking Changes
    - .GoogleV3: change missing api_key warning to an error. (#450)
  + Bugfixes
    - Fixed an undocumented breaking change in geopy 2.0.0, where
    the .Distance class has become abstract, thus it could
    no longer be used for unit conversions. (#435)
    - .Photon incorrectly treated 0.0 coordinate as an empty response.
    Contributed by Mateusz Konieczny. (#439)
    - .Nominatim: fix TypeError on empty reverse result. (#455)
  + Docs Improvements
    - Add Python 3.9 to the list of supported versions.
    - .Bing: change postalcode to postalCode.
      Contributed by zhongjun-ma. (#424)
    - .Nominatim: better describe what is returned in addressdetails.
      Contributed by Mateusz Konieczny. (#429)
    - .Nominatim: better describe viewbox param behavior.
     Contributed by Hannes. (#454)
    - .Yandex: remove attention block about requiring an API key.
- Update to 2.0.0 version
  geopy 2.0 is a major release with lots of cleanup and inner refactorings.
  The public interface of the library is mostly the same, and the set
  of supported geocoders didn't change.
  If you have checked your code on the latest 1.x release with enabled
  warnings (i.e. with -Wd key of the python command) and fixed
  all of them, then it should be safe to upgrade.

    Eric Palakovich Carr.
  * ADDED: DataBC geocoder for use with the British Columbia
    government’s DataBC service. Contributed by Benjamin
    Trigona-Harany.

  * CHANGED: GoogleV3’s geocode and reverse methods have different
    orders for keyword argument parameters. Geocoders are now
    standardized on (query, exactly_one, timeout, ...).
  * FIXED: Removed rounding of minutes which was causing a
    formatted point to always have zero seconds. Contributed by
    Jonathan Batchelor.

  * FIXED:YahooPlaceFinder geocoder authentication and response
    parsing fixed. Contributed by petergx.
  * ADDED: GoogleV3 geocoding now supports a components parameter,
    which is a filter for location criteria such as administrative
    area, country, etc. Contributed by crccheck.
- additional changes from version 0.97:
  * CHANGED: SSL connections are used by default for services with
    support. These geocoders accept a new ‘scheme’ argument in
    their init, which may be ‘https’ or ‘http’. Users desiring
    unencrypted connections must now specify ‘http’. Note that SSL
    connections’ certificates are not verified.
  * CHANGED: Geocoders accept a timeout argument which specifies
    the number of seconds to wait before raising a GeocoderTimedOut
    exception. This can be specified in the init, or specified
    one-off in each geocode or reverse call. There is now a default
    of 1 second.
  * CHANGED: geopy now supports Python 2 and Python 3 on a single
    codebase. Support for Python 2.5 is also dropped.
  * CHANGED: GoogleV3’s protocol argument is deprecated in favor of
    scheme.
  * ADDED: ESRI’s ArcGIS geocoder implemented. Contributed by Arsen
    Mamikonyan.
  * ADDED: Geocoders accept a proxies argument which specifies a
    proxy to route its geocoder requests through. It uses urllib,
    and accepts proxies in the form of a dictionary of {scheme:
    proxy address}, e.g., {“https”: “192.0.2.0”}. This was present
    but undocumented in 0.96.
  * ADDED: Geocoders check a new method,
    _geocoder_exception_handler, if defined, when the HTTP call to
    the geocoder’s service raises an exception. See LiveStreets for
    an example. Users can define or override this method.
  * ADDED: LiveStreets throws a GeocoderQuotaExceeded exception
    when appropriate.
  * ADDED: Point can parse a greater variety of coordinate strings.
    Contributed by nucflash.
  * FIXED: GeocodersDotUS now authenticates with an Authorization
    HTTP header. Contributed by Arsen Mamikonyan.
  * REMOVED: MediaWiki and SemanticMediaWiki geocoders removed.
  * REMOVED: Geohash module has been removed.
- additional changes from version 0.96.3:
  * ADDED: Documentation warning that the Vincenty distance
    implementation fails to converge for some valid points.
    Reported by mkeller-upb.
  * FIXED: Geocoder proxying fixed. Contributed by Marc-Olivier
    Titeux.

Wed Dec 11 01:23:31 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.96.2
  + fix : MANIFEST.in should not use `exclude`.
- Changes from 0.96.1
  + fix : GoogleV3 returns `None` when the service returns an error
    status of `ZERO_RESULTS`.
- Changes from 0.96.0
  + GoogleV3's reverse geocoder now returns one result by default. Set
    `exactly_one` to False for a list.

  + GoogleV3 returns new exception types:
    `geopy.geocoders.base.GQueryError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQueryError`
    `geopy.geocoders.base.GeocoderResultError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQueryError`
    `geopy.geocoders.base.GTooManyQueriesError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQuotaExceeded`

  + OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoder implemented.
  + Yahoo! BOSS Geo PlaceFinder geocoder implemented.
  + SmartyStreets LiveAddress geocoder implemented.
  + GeoNames geocoder is implements GeoNames' new username
    requirement and `api.geonames.org` endpoint.
  + Bing geocoder supports `user_location` (`Point`) parameter. Bing will
    prefer results near the coordinates of `user_location`.
  + `GoogleV3.geocode_first()` no longer throws exception on multiple
    results.
  + Unnecessary coercing to UTF-8 on Py3k.
  +`format_degrees` now rounds minutes properly.
  + No longer warn if the optional dependency `BeautifulSoup` is
    not present.
  + Miscellaneous inconsistent behavior and errors in geolocating.
  + Google V2 geocoder has been removed as its API was shutdown.
- Changes from 0.95.1
  + Fix #12, where `DeprecationWarning` was showing for GoogleV2 even if
    it wasn't being used (due to `geopy.geocoders` importing it).
  + `GoogleV3.geocode` "address" kwarg renamed to "string" to match
    `Google.geocode` to make updating easier.
  + Geocoders now properly handle Unicode objects as input (previously
    would fail on non-ASCII characters due to wanting UTF-8 strings).
- Changes from 0.95
  + Google Geocoding API V3 support. "google.Google()" should be
    replaced by "googlev3.GoogleV3()", with no `api_key`.
    Please see http://goo.gl/somDT for valid arguments.
  + setup.py updated to now automatically support Python 3+
    (via 2to3 auto-compile option).
