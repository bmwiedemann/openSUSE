- update to version 1.11.0:

Tue May  5 15:39:14 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 1.10.0:
  * CHANGED: GeocodeFarm now uses version 3 of the service’s API,
    which allows use by unauthenticated users, multiple results,
    and SSL/TLS. You may need to obtain a new API key from
    GeocodeFarm, or use None for their free tier. Contributed by
    Eric Palakovich Carr.
  * ADDED: DataBC geocoder for use with the British Columbia
    government’s DataBC service. Contributed by Benjamin
    Trigona-Harany.
  * ADDED: Placefinder’s geocode method now requests a timezone if
    the with_timezone parameter is true. Contributed by willr.
  * FIXED: Nominatim specifies a viewbox parameter rather than the
    apparently deprecated view_box.
- additional changes from version 1.9.1:
  * FIXED: Fix support for GoogleV3 bounds parameter. Contributed
    by Benjamin Trigona-Harany.
- additional changes from version 1.9.0:

    only available to enterprise accounts. OpenMapQuest is a
    replacement for Nominatim-sourced data.
  * CHANGED: Nominatim now uses HTTPS by default and accepts a
    scheme argument. Contributed by srounet.
  * ADDED: Nominatim now accepts a domain argument, which allows
    using a different server than nominatim.openstreetmap.org.
    Contributed by srounet.
  * FIXED: Bing was not accessible from get_geocoder_for_service.
    Contributed by Adrián López.

    timezone methods.
- additional changes from version 1.8.0:

    receive a ConfigurationError.
- additional changes from version 1.7.1:
  * FIXED: IGN France geocoder’s address formatting better handles
    results that do not have a building number. Contributed by
    Thomas Gratier.

    the service’s authentication. An auth_id parameter was added to
    the geocoder’s initialization. Contributed by Arsen Mamikonyan.
- additional changes from version 1.4.0:
  * ADDED: Mapquest.reverse() method added. Contributed by Dody
    Suria Wijaya.
  * ADDED: Bing’s geocoder now accepts the optional arguments
    “culture”, “includeNeighborhood”, and “include”. Contributed by
    oskholl.
- additional changes from version 1.3.0:
  * ADDED: Nominatim.geocode() accepts a geometry argument for
    retrieving wkt, svg, kml, or geojson formatted geometries in
    results. Contributed by spatialbitz.
- additional changes from version 1.2.0:
  * ADDED: GeoNames.reverse() added. Contributed by Emile Aben.
  * ADDED: GoogleV3.timezone() added. This returns a pytz object
    giving the timezone in effect for a given location at a time

    Contributed by kpanic.
  * ADDED: Nominatim geocoder now supports a language parameter.
    Contributed by Benjamin Henne.
  * CHANGED: GoogleV3’s geocode and reverse methods have different
    orders for keyword argument parameters. Geocoders are now
    standardized on (query, exactly_one, timeout, ...).
  * FIXED: Removed rounding of minutes which was causing a
    formatted point to always have zero seconds. Contributed by
    Jonathan Batchelor.
- additional changes from version 0.99:

    and reverse geocoding. Contributed by Eric Palakovich Carr.

    exception for all SSLError exceptions. Contributed by David
    Gilman.
- additional changes from version 0.98:
  * CHANGED: Geocoders’ geocode and reverse method return types
    have changed from None, a tuple, or a list of tuples, to None,
    a geopy.Location object, or a list of geopy.Location objects.
- additional changes from version 0.97.1:
  * FIXED:YahooPlaceFinder geocoder authentication and response
    parsing fixed. Contributed by petergx.
  * ADDED: GoogleV3 geocoding now supports a components parameter,
    which is a filter for location criteria such as administrative
    area, country, etc. Contributed by crccheck.
- additional changes from version 0.97:
  * CHANGED: SSL connections are used by default for services with
    support. These geocoders accept a new ‘scheme’ argument in
    their init, which may be ‘https’ or ‘http’. Users desiring
    unencrypted connections must now specify ‘http’. Note that SSL
    connections’ certificates are not verified.
  * CHANGED: Geocoders accept a timeout argument which specifies
    the number of seconds to wait before raising a GeocoderTimedOut
    exception. This can be specified in the init, or specified
    one-off in each geocode or reverse call. There is now a default
    of 1 second.
  * CHANGED: geopy now supports Python 2 and Python 3 on a single
    codebase. Support for Python 2.5 is also dropped.
  * CHANGED: GoogleV3’s protocol argument is deprecated in favor of
    scheme.
  * ADDED: ESRI’s ArcGIS geocoder implemented. Contributed by Arsen
    Mamikonyan.
  * ADDED: Geocoders accept a proxies argument which specifies a
    proxy to route its geocoder requests through. It uses urllib,
    and accepts proxies in the form of a dictionary of {scheme:
    proxy address}, e.g., {“https”: “192.0.2.0”}. This was present
    but undocumented in 0.96.
  * ADDED: Geocoders check a new method,
    _geocoder_exception_handler, if defined, when the HTTP call to
    the geocoder’s service raises an exception. See LiveStreets for
    an example. Users can define or override this method.
  * ADDED: LiveStreets throws a GeocoderQuotaExceeded exception
    when appropriate.
  * ADDED: Point can parse a greater variety of coordinate strings.
    Contributed by nucflash.
  * FIXED: GeocodersDotUS now authenticates with an Authorization
    HTTP header. Contributed by Arsen Mamikonyan.
  * REMOVED: MediaWiki and SemanticMediaWiki geocoders removed.
  * REMOVED: Geohash module has been removed.
- additional changes from version 0.96.3:
  * ADDED: Documentation warning that the Vincenty distance
    implementation fails to converge for some valid points.
    Reported by mkeller-upb.
  * FIXED: Geocoder proxying fixed. Contributed by Marc-Olivier
    Titeux.

Wed Dec 11 01:23:31 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.96.2
  + fix : MANIFEST.in should not use `exclude`.
- Changes from 0.96.1
  + fix : GoogleV3 returns `None` when the service returns an error
    status of `ZERO_RESULTS`.
- Changes from 0.96.0
  + GoogleV3's reverse geocoder now returns one result by default. Set
    `exactly_one` to False for a list.

  + GoogleV3 returns new exception types:
    `geopy.geocoders.base.GQueryError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQueryError`
    `geopy.geocoders.base.GeocoderResultError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQueryError`
    `geopy.geocoders.base.GTooManyQueriesError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQuotaExceeded`

  + OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoder implemented.
  + Yahoo! BOSS Geo PlaceFinder geocoder implemented.
  + SmartyStreets LiveAddress geocoder implemented.
  + GeoNames geocoder is implements GeoNames' new username
    requirement and `api.geonames.org` endpoint.
  + Bing geocoder supports `user_location` (`Point`) parameter. Bing will
    prefer results near the coordinates of `user_location`.
  + `GoogleV3.geocode_first()` no longer throws exception on multiple
    results.
  + Unnecessary coercing to UTF-8 on Py3k.
  +`format_degrees` now rounds minutes properly.
  + No longer warn if the optional dependency `BeautifulSoup` is
    not present.
  + Miscellaneous inconsistent behavior and errors in geolocating.
  + Google V2 geocoder has been removed as its API was shutdown.
- Changes from 0.95.1
  + Fix #12, where `DeprecationWarning` was showing for GoogleV2 even if
    it wasn't being used (due to `geopy.geocoders` importing it).
  + `GoogleV3.geocode` "address" kwarg renamed to "string" to match
    `Google.geocode` to make updating easier.
  + Geocoders now properly handle Unicode objects as input (previously
    would fail on non-ASCII characters due to wanting UTF-8 strings).
- Changes from 0.95
  + Google Geocoding API V3 support. "google.Google()" should be
    replaced by "googlev3.GoogleV3()", with no `api_key`.
    Please see http://goo.gl/somDT for valid arguments.
  + setup.py updated to now automatically support Python 3+
    (via 2to3 auto-compile option).
