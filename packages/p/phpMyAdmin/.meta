  <title>Administration of MySQL over the web</title>
  <description>phpMyAdmin can manage a whole MySQL server (needs a super-user) as well as a
single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a properly set up MySQL
user who can read/write only the desired database. It's up to you to look up
the appropriate part in the MySQL manual.

Currently phpMyAdmin can:

  * browse and drop databases, tables, views, fields and indexes
  * create, copy, drop, rename and alter databases, tables, fields and indexes
  * maintenance server, databases and tables, with proposals on server
    configuration
  * execute, edit and bookmark any SQL-statement, even batch-queries
  * load text files into tables
  * create^1 and read dumps of tables
  * export^1 data to various formats: CSV, XML, PDF, ISO/IEC 26300 -
    OpenDocument Text and Spreadsheet, Word, Excel and L^AT[E]X formats
  * import data and MySQL structures from Microsoft Excel and OpenDocument
    spreadsheets, as well as XML, CSV, and SQL files
  * administer multiple servers
  * manage MySQL users and privileges
  * check referential integrity in MyISAM tables
  * using Query-by-example (QBE), create complex queries automatically
    connecting required tables
  * create PDF graphics of your Database layout
  * search globally in a database or a subset of it
  * transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions,
    like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link
  * track changes on databases, tables and views
  * support InnoDB tables and foreign keys (see FAQ 3.6)
  * support mysqli, the improved MySQL extension (see FAQ 1.17)
  * communicate in 57 different languages 
  * synchronize two databases residing on the same as well as remote servers
