  <title>Python interface to the R Programming Language</title>
  <description>rpy2 is a very simple, yet robust, Python interface to the R Programming
Language. It can manage all kinds of R objects and can execute arbitrary R
functions (including the graphic functions). All errors from the R language
areconverted to Python exceptions. Any module installed for the R system can
be used from within Python. rpy2 is a redesign and rewrite of rpy.</description>
