%description
The functions exported by this module deal with runtime handling of Perl
modules, which are normally handled at compile time. This module avoids
using any other modules, so that it can be used in low-level
infrastructure.

The parts of this module that work with module names apply the same syntax
that is used for barewords in Perl source. In principle this syntax can
vary between versions of Perl, and this module applies the syntax of the
Perl on which it is running. In practice the usable syntax hasn't changed
yet. There's some intent for Unicode module names to be supported in the
future, but this hasn't yet amounted to any consistent facility.

The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules include
workarounds for three old Perl core bugs regarding 'require'. These
workarounds are applied on any Perl version where the bugs exist, except
for a case where one of the bugs cannot be adequately worked around in pure
Perl.
