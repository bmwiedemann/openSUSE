  * Work around an issue in the Python stdlib that makes the entire
    process deadlock during garbage collection if events are sent

    being attached to transactions.

- Update to version 0.16.0

    bugfix release of gevent. This will fix a few instances of
    wrong request data being attached to events while using an
    asyncio-based web framework.

    left open if the database transaction had to be rolled back.

    could not be overridden at all.
