    anything besides a dictionary
  * Fix the Django integrations's ASGI handler for Channels 3.0.
    Thanks Luke Pomfrey!

  * Fix a bug under Celery 4.2+ that may have caused disjoint
    traces or missing transactions.

- Update to version 0.17.6
  * Support for Flask 0.10 (only relaxing version check)

- Update to version 0.17.5
  * Work around an issue in the Python stdlib that makes the entire
    process deadlock during garbage collection if events are sent
    from a __del__ implementation.
  * Add possibility to wrap ASGI application twice in middleware to
    enable split up of request scope data and exception catching.

  * New integration for the Chalice web framework for AWS Lambda.
    Thanks to the folks at Cuenca MX!

- Update to version 0.17.3

    variables that then drown out the useful ones in trimming.

- Update to version 0.17.2

  * Fix timezone bugs in AWS Lambda integration.

  * Fix a bug that caused Django apps to crash if the view didn't
    have a __name__ attribute.

    errors for Python 3.
  * The AWS Lambda integration now supports an option to warn about

    impact. The flag will be removed in 0.17.
  * Fix compatibility bug with Django 3.1.

- Update to version 0.16.2
  * New (optional) integrations for richer stacktraces: pure_eval
    for additional variables, executing for better function names.

- Update to version 0.16.1
  * Flask integration: Fix a bug that prevented custom tags from
    being attached to transactions.

- Update to version 0.16.0
  * Redis integration: add tags for more commands
  * Redis integration: Patch rediscluster package if installed.
  * Session tracking: A session is no longer considered crashed if
    there has been a fatal log message (only unhandled exceptions

    exception if contextvars are not available, like it is already
    the case for other asyncio integrations.
  * Contextvars are now used in more circumstances following a
    bugfix release of gevent. This will fix a few instances of
    wrong request data being attached to events while using an
    asyncio-based web framework.
  * APM: Fix a bug in the SQLAlchemy integration where a span was
    left open if the database transaction had to be rolled back.
    This could have led to deeply nested span trees under that db
    query span.
  * Fix a bug in the Pyramid integration where the transaction name
    could not be overridden at all.
  * Fix a broken type annotation on capture_exception.
  * Basic support for Django 3.1. More work is required for async

    emit rate limits for specific event types/data categories.
  * Fix a bug in capture_event where it would crash if given
    additional kwargs.
  * Fix a bug where contextvars from the request handler were
    inaccessible in AIOHTTP error handlers.

    instrumented Celery as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 26 12:36:49 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>
