%description
Screenplain allows you to write a screenplay as a plain text
file using a format called Fountain. Text files are simple
and supported by all text manipulation software. It's not
just for hackers, too. The simplicity of plain text allows
you to easily view and edit them on devices such as tablets
and phones. No need for specific screenwriting software.

The magic that Screenplain performs is to take your plain
text file and convert it to a good looking screenplay in an
industry standard format. Send that file off to your producer,
agent, director or screenwriting competition. Currently, the
supported output formats are FDX and HTML. PDF will hopefully
be supported in a not too distant future.
