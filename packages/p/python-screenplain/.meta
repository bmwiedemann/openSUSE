  <title>Write your screenplay in plain text and run it through this program to make it look good</title>
  <description>Screenplain allows you to write a screenplay as a plain text file using a format called Fountain. Text files are simple and supported by all text manipulation software. It's not just for hackers, too. The simplicity of plain text allows you to easily view and edit them on devices such as tablets and phones. No need for specific screenwriting software.

The magic that Screenplain performs is to take your plain text file and convert it to a good looking screenplay in an industry standard format. Send that file off to your producer, agent, director or screenwriting competition. Currently, the supported output formats are FDX and HTML. PDF will hopefully be supported in a not too distant future.</description>
