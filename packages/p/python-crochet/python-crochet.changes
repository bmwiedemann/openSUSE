- Update to 1.5.0
  * New features:
    - Added support for Python 3.5.
  * Removed features:
    - Python 2.6, Python 3.3, and versions of Twisted < 15.0 are no longer
      supported.

- Update to 1.4.0
  * New features:
    - Added support for Python 3.4.
  * Documentation:
    - Added a section on known issues and workarounds.
  * Bug fixes:
    - Main thread detection (used to determine when Crochet should
      shutdown) is now less fragile. This means Crochet now supports more
      environments, e.g. uWSGI. Thanks to Ben Picolo for the patch.

- Update to 1.3.0
  * Bug fixes:
    - It is now possible to call ``EventualResult.wait()`` (or functions
      wrapped in ``wait_for``) at import time if another thread holds the
      import lock. Thanks to Ken Struys for the patch.

- Update to 1.2.0
  * New features:
    - ``crochet.wait_for`` implements the timeout/cancellation pattern documented
      in previous versions of Crochet. ``crochet.wait_for_reactor`` and
      ``EventualResult.wait(timeout=None)`` are now deprecated, since lacking
      timeouts they could potentially block forever.
    - Functions wrapped with ``wait_for`` and ``run_in_reactor`` can now be accessed
      via the ``wrapped_function`` attribute, to ease unit testing of the underlying
      Twisted code.
  * API changes:
    - It is no longer possible to call ``EventualResult.wait()`` (or functions
      wrapped with ``wait_for``) at import time, since this can lead to deadlocks
      or prevent other threads from importing. Thanks to Tom Prince for the bug
      report.
  * Bug fixes:
    - ``warnings`` are no longer erroneously turned into Twisted log messages.
    - The reactor is now only imported when ``crochet.setup()`` or
      ``crochet.no_setup()`` are called, allowing daemonization if only ``crochet``
      is imported (http://tm.tl/7105). Thanks to Daniel Nephin for the bug report.

- Update to 1.1.0
  * Bug fixes:
     - EventualResult.wait() can now be used safely from multiple threads,
       thanks to Gavin Panella for reporting the bug.
     - Fixed reentrancy deadlock in the logging code caused by
       http://bugs.python.org/issue14976, thanks to Rod Morehead for
       reporting the bug.
     - Crochet now installs on Python 3.3 again, thanks to Ben Cordero.
     - Crochet should now work on Windows, thanks to Konstantinos
       Koukopoulos.
     - Crochet tests can now run without adding its absolute path to
       PYTHONPATH or installing it first.
  * Documentation:
     - EventualResult.original_failure is now documented.
