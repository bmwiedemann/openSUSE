  <title>Crochet: Use Twisted Anywhere!</title>
  <description>Crochet is an MIT-licensed library that makes it easier for blocking or threaded applications like Flask or Django to use the Twisted networking framework. Crochet provides the following features:

  - Runs Twisted's reactor in a thread it manages.
  - The reactor shuts down automatically when the process' main thread finishes.
  - Hooks up Twisted's log system to the Python standard library logging framework. Unlike Twisted's built-in logging bridge, this includes support for blocking Handler instances.
  - A blocking API to eventual results (i.e. Deferred instances). This last feature can be used separately, so Crochet is also useful for normal Twisted applications that use threads.
