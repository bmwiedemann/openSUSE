  pcre-8.42-pcreposix.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  4 11:46:19 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- pcre 8.42:
  * Fix outdated real_pcre definitions in pcre.h.in
  * pcregrep was truncating components of file names to 128
    characters when processing files with the -r option, and also
    truncating path names to 512 characters. There is now a check on
    the absolute length of full path file names, which may be up to
    2047 characters long
  * Using pcre_dfa_exec(), in UTF mode when UCP support was not
    defined, there was the possibility of a false positive match when
    caselessly matching a "not this character" item such as
    [^\x{1234}] (with a code point greater than 127) because the
    "other case" variable was not being initialized
  * Although pcre_jit_exec checks whether the pattern is compiled
    in a given mode, it was also expected that at least one mode is
    available. This is fixed and pcre_jit_exec returns with
    PCRE_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION when the pattern is not optimized by JIT
    at all.
  * The line number and related variables such as match counts in
    pcregrep were all int variables, causing overflow when files with
    more than 2147483647 lines were processed (assuming 32-bit ints).
    They have all been changed to unsigned long ints.
  * If a backreference with a minimum repeat count of zero was first in
    a pattern, apart from assertions, an incorrect first matching
    character could be recorded. For example, for the pattern
    /(?=(a))\1?b/, "b" was incorrectly set as the first character of
    a match.
  * Fix out-of-bounds read for partial matching of /./ against an
    empty string when the newline type is CRLF.
  * When matching using the the REG_STARTEND feature of the POSIX
    API with a non-zero starting offset, unset capturing groups
    with lower numbers than a group that did capture something were
    not being correctly returned as "unset" (that is, with offset
    values of -1).
  * Matching the pattern /(*UTF)\C[^\v]+\x80/ against an 8-bit
    string containing multi-code-unit characters caused bad
    behaviour and possibly a crash. This issue was fixed for other
    kinds of repeat in release 8.37 by change 38, but repeating
    character classes were overlooked.
  * A small fix to pcregrep to avoid compiler warnings for
    -Wformat-overflow=2.
  * Added --enable-jit=auto support to configure.ac.
  * Fix misleading error message in configure.ac.

- pcre 8.41:
  * If pcregrep in multiline mode with --only-matching matched
    several lines, it restarted scanning at the next line instead
    of moving on to the end of the matched string, which can be
    several lines after the start.
  * Fix a missing else in the JIT compiler reported by 'idaifish'.
    CVE-2017-6004 bsc#1025709
  * A (?# style comment is now ignored between a basic quantifier
    and a following '+' or '?' (example: /X+(?#comment)?Y/.
  * Avoid use of a potentially overflowing buffer in pcregrep
  * Fix issues reported by fuzzers in pcretest:
    - Check for values < 256 when calling isprint() in pcretest.
    - Give an error for too big a number after \O.
  * In the 32-bit library in non-UTF mode, an attempt to find a 
    Unicode property for a character with a code point greater than
    0x10ffff (the Unicode maximum) caused a crash.
    CVE-2017-7186 bsc#1030066, CVE-2017-7244 bsc#1030807
  * The alternative matching function, pcre_dfa_exec() misbehaved
    if it encountered a character class with a possessive repeat,
    for example [a-f]{3}+.
  * When pcretest called pcre_copy_substring() in 32-bit mode, it
    set the buffer length incorrectly, which could result in buffer
    overflow. CVE-2017-7245 bsc#1030805, CVE-2017-7246 bsc#1030803

- pcre 8.40:
  * Using -o with -M in pcregrep could cause unnecessary repeated
    output when the match extended over a line boundary.
  * Fix register overwite in JIT when SSE2 acceleration is enabled.
  * Ignore "show all captures" (/=) for DFA matching.
  * Fix JIT unaligned accesses on x86
  * In any wide-character mode (8-bit UTF or any 16-bit or 32-bit
    mode), without PCRE_UCP set, a negative character type such as
    \D in a positive class should cause all characters greater than
    255 to match, whatever else is in the class. There was a bug
    that caused this not to happen if a Unicode property item was
    added to such a class, for example [\D\P{Nd}] or [\W\pL].
  * When pcretest was outputing information from a callout, the
    caret indicator for the current position in the subject line
    was incorrect if it was after an escape sequence for a
    character whose code point was greater than \x{ff}.
  * A pattern such as (?<RA>abc)(?(R)xyz) was incorrectly compiled
    such that the conditional was interpreted as a reference to
    capturing group 1 instead of a test for recursion. Any group
    whose name began with R was misinterpreted in this way. (The
    reference interpretation should only happen if the group's name
    is precisely "R".)
  * A number of bugs have been mended relating to match start-up
    optimizations when the first thing in a pattern is a positive
    lookahead. These all applied only when PCRE_NO_START_OPTIMIZE
    was *not* set:
    + A pattern such as (?=.*X)X$ was incorrectly optimized as if
      it needed both an initial 'X' and a following 'X'.
    + Some patterns starting with an assertion that started with
      .* were incorrectly optimized as having to match at the start
      of the subject or after a newline. There are cases where this
      is not true, for example, (?=.*[A-Z])(?=.{8,16})(?!.*[\s])
      matches after the start in lines that start with spaces.
      Starting .* in an assertion is no longer taken as an
      indication of matching at the start (or after a newline).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 15:40:59 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to 8.32 version:
  * There is now support for 32-bit character strings and UTF-32. Like the
    16-bit support, this is done by compiling a separate 32-bit library.
  * \X now matches a Unicode extended grapheme cluster.
  * Case-independent matching of Unicode characters that have more than one
    "other case" now makes all three (or more) characters equivalent. This
    applies, for example, to Greek Sigma, which has two lowercase versions.
  * Unicode character properties are updated to Unicode 6.2.0.
  * The EBCDIC support, which had decayed, has had a spring clean.
  * A number of JIT optimizations have been added, which give faster JIT
    execution speed. In addition, a new direct interface to JIT execution is
    available. This bypasses some of the sanity checks of pcre_exec() to give a
    noticeable speed-up.
  * A number of issues in pcregrep have been fixed, making it more compatible
    with GNU grep. In particular, --exclude and --include (and variants) apply
    to all files now, not just those obtained from scanning a directory
    recursively. In Windows environments, the default action for directories is
    now "skip" instead of "read" (which provokes an error).
  * If the --only-matching (-o) option in pcregrep is specified multiple
    times, each one causes appropriate output. For example, -o1 -o2 outputs the
    substrings matched by the 1st and 2nd capturing parentheses. A separating
    string can be specified by --om-separator (default empty).
  * When PCRE is built via Autotools using a version of gcc that has the
    "visibility" feature, it is used to hide internal library functions that are
    not part of the public API.
-  updated and versionned pcre-visibility.patch to svn trunk
   * Modifications on configure.ac and makefile have been merged on upstream release

    - support for \N, which always matches any character other than
      newline
    - added --line-buffered to pcregrep
  + Several small new features and bugfixes
- Changes from version 8.02:
  + Update Unicode data tables to Unicode 5.2.0
  + Update the licensing terms in the pcregexp.pas file
  + Several bug fixes
- Changes from version 8.01:
  + Several bug fixes and build system improvements
- Changes from version 8.00:
  + Enhancements:
    - remove restrictions on patterns used for partial matching
    - give extra information for partial matches
    - improve the partial matching process
    - add option to make a partial match override a full match
    - enhance "study" process by finding a lower bound matching
      length
    - groups with duplicate numbers may now have duplicated names
      without the use of PCRE_DUPNAMES, but they may not have
      different names
    - add REG_UNGREEDY to the pcreposix interface, which maps to
      PCRE_UNGREEDY.
  + Several bug fixes
- Drop pcre-7.9.patch: fixed upstream.
- Rearrange spec file to have all the %files sections together, as
  well as all the scriptlets together.
- Kill the main package that only included doc files like AUTHORS,
  NEWS, and license, and put those files in libpcre0: this really
  makes more sense. Therefore, make libpcre0 Provides/Obsoletes
  libpcre0.
- We can also remove the other dependencies on the main package,
  since everything already depends on libpcre0.
- Remove AutoReqProv: it's default now.
- Remove references to perl 5.005 in descriptons: it's not
  mentioned anywhere anymore upstream.

Fri Feb  1 19:43:16 CET 2008 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- update to version 7.6
- The main reason for having this release so soon after 7.5 
  is because it fixes a potential buffer overflow problem in pcre_compile() 
  when run in UTF-8 mode. In addition, the CMake configuration files have been brought up to date. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 13 09:08:22 CET 2008 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- update version 7.5
	1.  Applied a patch from Craig: "This patch makes it possible to 'ignore'
    values in parens when parsing an RE using the C++ wrapper."

	2.  Negative specials like \S did not work in character classes in UTF-8 mode.
    Characters greater than 255 were excluded from the class instead of being
    included.

	3.  The same bug as (2) above applied to negated POSIX classes such as
    [:^space:].

	4.  PCRECPP_STATIC was referenced in pcrecpp_internal.h, but nowhere was it
    defined or documented. It seems to have been a typo for PCRE_STATIC, so
    I have changed it.

	5.  The construct (?&) was not diagnosed as a syntax error (it referenced the
    first named subpattern) and a construct such as (?&a) would reference the
    first named subpattern whose name started with "a" (in other words, the
    length check was missing). Both these problems are fixed. "Subpattern name
    expected" is now given for (?&) (a zero-length name), and this patch also
    makes it give the same error for \k'' (previously it complained that that
    was a reference to a non-existent subpattern).

	6.  The erroneous patterns (?+-a) and (?-+a) give different error messages;
    this is right because (?- can be followed by option settings as well as by
    digits. I have, however, made the messages clearer.

	7.  Patterns such as (?(1)a|b) (a pattern that contains fewer subpatterns
    than the number used in the conditional) now cause a compile-time error.
    This is actually not compatible with Perl, which accepts such patterns, but
    treats the conditional as always being FALSE (as PCRE used to), but it
    seems to me that giving a diagnostic is better.

	8.  Change "alphameric" to the more common word "alphanumeric" in comments
    and messages.

	9.  Fix two occurrences of "backslash" in comments that should have been
    "backspace".

	10. Remove two redundant lines of code that can never be obeyed (their function
    was moved elsewhere).

	11. The program that makes PCRE's Unicode character property table had a bug
    which caused it to generate incorrect table entries for sequences of
    characters that have the same character type, but are in different scripts.
    It amalgamated them into a single range, with the script of the first of
    them. In other words, some characters were in the wrong script. There were
    thirteen such cases, affecting characters in the following ranges:

      U+002b0 - U+002c1
      U+0060c - U+0060d
      U+0061e - U+00612
      U+0064b - U+0065e
      U+0074d - U+0076d
      U+01800 - U+01805
      U+01d00 - U+01d77
      U+01d9b - U+01dbf
      U+0200b - U+0200f
      U+030fc - U+030fe
      U+03260 - U+0327f
      U+0fb46 - U+0fbb1
      U+10450 - U+1049d

	12. The -o option (show only the matching part of a line) for pcregrep was not
    compatible with GNU grep in that, if there was more than one match in a
    line, it showed only the first of them. It now behaves in the same way as
    GNU grep.

	13. If the -o and -v options were combined for pcregrep, it printed a blank
    line for every non-matching line. GNU grep prints nothing, and pcregrep now
    does the same. The return code can be used to tell if there were any
    non-matching lines.

	14. Added --file-offsets and --line-offsets to pcregrep.

	15. The pattern (?=something)(?R) was not being diagnosed as a potentially
    infinitely looping recursion. The bug was that positive lookaheads were not
    being skipped when checking for a possible empty match (negative lookaheads
    and both kinds of lookbehind were skipped).

	16. Fixed two typos in the Windows-only code in pcregrep.c, and moved the
    inclusion of <windows.h> to before rather than after the definition of
    INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES (patch from David Byron).

	17. Specifying a possessive quantifier with a specific limit for a Unicode
    character property caused pcre_compile() to compile bad code, which led at
    runtime to PCRE_ERROR_INTERNAL (-14). Examples of patterns that caused this
    are: /\p{Zl}{2,3}+/8 and /\p{Cc}{2}+/8. It was the possessive "+" that
    caused the error; without that there was no problem.

	18. Added --enable-pcregrep-libz and --enable-pcregrep-libbz2.

	19. Added --enable-pcretest-libreadline.

	20. In pcrecpp.cc, the variable 'count' was incremented twice in
    RE::GlobalReplace(). As a result, the number of replacements returned was
    double what it should be. I removed one of the increments, but Craig sent a
    later patch that removed the other one (the right fix) and added unit tests
    that check the return values (which was not done before).

	21. Several CMake things:

    (1) Arranged that, when cmake is used on Unix, the libraries end up with
        the names libpcre and libpcreposix, not just pcre and pcreposix.

    (2) The above change means that pcretest and pcregrep are now correctly
        linked with the newly-built libraries, not previously installed ones.

    (3) Added PCRE_SUPPORT_LIBREADLINE, PCRE_SUPPORT_LIBZ, PCRE_SUPPORT_LIBBZ2.

	22. In UTF-8 mode, with newline set to "any", a pattern such as .*a.*=.b.*
    crashed when matching a string such as a\x{2029}b (note that \x{2029} is a
    UTF-8 newline character). The key issue is that the pattern starts .*;
    this means that the match must be either at the beginning, or after a
    newline. The bug was in the code for advancing after a failed match and
    checking that the new position followed a newline. It was not taking
    account of UTF-8 characters correctly.

	23. PCRE was behaving differently from Perl in the way it recognized POSIX
    character classes. PCRE was not treating the sequence [:...:] as a
    character class unless the ... were all letters. Perl, however, seems to
    allow any characters between [: and :], though of course it rejects as
    unknown any "names" that contain non-letters, because all the known class
    names consist only of letters. Thus, Perl gives an error for [[:1234:]],
    for example, whereas PCRE did not - it did not recognize a POSIX character
    class. This seemed a bit dangerous, so the code has been changed to be
    closer to Perl. The behaviour is not identical to Perl, because PCRE will
    diagnose an unknown class for, for example, [[:l\ower:]] where Perl will
    treat it as [[:lower:]]. However, PCRE does now give "unknown" errors where
    Perl does, and where it didn't before.

	24. Rewrite so as to remove the single use of %n from pcregrep because in some
    Windows environments %n is disabled by default.

- update to version 7.4, since version 7.2, more than 40 bugs were fixed
 including multiple vulnerabilities [#325921] . The list of changes is too long
 to mention here, see changelog.txt for details. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- added fix to run ldconfig for libpcre*, Thanks to
  Cristian Rodriguez <crrodriguez@novell.com> who provided
  the patch (#298291)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 23 15:22:40 CEST 2007 - ms@suse.de

- update to version 7.2, fixes bug: (#293752)
- Changes from 7.1 to 7.2

 1. If the fr_FR locale cannot be found for test 3, try the "french" locale,
    which is apparently normally available under Windows.

 2. Re-jig the pcregrep tests with different newline settings in an attempt
    to make them independent of the local environment's newline setting.

 3. Add code to configure.ac to remove -g from the CFLAGS default settings.

 4. Some of the "internals" tests were previously cut out when the link size
    was not 2, because the output contained actual offsets. The recent new
    "Z" feature of pcretest means that these can be cut out, making the tests
    usable with all link sizes.

 5. Implemented Stan Switzer's goto replacement for longjmp() when not using
    stack recursion. This gives a massive performance boost under BSD, but just
    a small improvement under Linux. However, it saves one field in the frame
    in all cases.

 6. Added more features from the forthcoming Perl 5.10:

    (a) (?-n) (where n is a string of digits) is a relative subroutine or
        recursion call. It refers to the nth most recently opened parentheses.

    (b) (?+n) is also a relative subroutine call; it refers to the nth next
        to be opened parentheses.

    (c) Conditions that refer to capturing parentheses can be specified
        relatively, for example, (?(-2)... or (?(+3)...

    (d) \K resets the start of the current match so that everything before
        is not part of it.

    (e) \k{name} is synonymous with \k<name> and \k'name' (.NET compatible).

    (f) \g{name} is another synonym - part of Perl 5.10's unification of
        reference syntax.

    (g) (?| introduces a group in which the numbering of parentheses in each
        alternative starts with the same number.

    (h) \h, \H, \v, and \V match horizontal and vertical whitespace.

 7. Added two new calls to pcre_fullinfo(): PCRE_INFO_OKPARTIAL and
    PCRE_INFO_JCHANGED.

 8. A pattern such as  (.*(.)?)*  caused pcre_exec() to fail by either not
    terminating or by crashing. Diagnosed by Viktor Griph; it was in the code
    for detecting groups that can match an empty string.

 9. A pattern with a very large number of alternatives (more than several
    hundred) was running out of internal workspace during the pre-compile
    phase, where pcre_compile() figures out how much memory will be needed. A
    bit of new cunning has reduced the workspace needed for groups with
    alternatives. The 1000-alternative test pattern now uses 12 bytes of
    workspace instead of running out of the 4096 that are available.

10. Inserted some missing (unsigned int) casts to get rid of compiler warnings.

11. Applied patch from Google to remove an optimization that didn't quite work.
    The report of the bug said:

      pcrecpp::RE("a*").FullMatch("aaa") matches, while
      pcrecpp::RE("a*?").FullMatch("aaa") does not, and
      pcrecpp::RE("a*?\\z").FullMatch("aaa") does again.

12. If \p or \P was used in non-UTF-8 mode on a character greater than 127
    it matched the wrong number of bytes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  1 11:02:54 CEST 2007 - ms@suse.de

Wed Apr 25 13:39:55 CEST 2007 - ms@suse.de

- update to pcre 7.1

 1. Applied Bob Rossi and Daniel G's patches to convert the build system to one
    that is more "standard", making use of automake and other Autotools. There
    is some re-arrangement of the files and adjustment of comments consequent
    on this.

 2. Part of the patch fixed a problem with the pcregrep tests. The test of -r
    for recursive directory scanning broke on some systems because the files
    are not scanned in any specific order and on different systems the order
    was different. A call to "sort" has been inserted into RunGrepTest for the
    approprate test as a short-term fix. In the longer term there may be an
    alternative.

 3. I had an email from Eric Raymond about problems translating some of PCRE's
    man pages to HTML (despite the fact that I distribute HTML pages, some
    people do their own conversions for various reasons). The problems
    concerned the use of low-level troff macros .br and .in. I have therefore
    removed all such uses from the man pages (some were redundant, some could
    be replaced by .nf/.fi pairs). The 132html script that I use to generate
    HTML has been updated to handle .nf/.fi and to complain if it encounters
    .br or .in.

 4. Updated comments in configure.ac that get placed in config.h.in and also
    arranged for config.h to be included in the distribution, with the name
    config.h.generic, for the benefit of those who have to compile without
    Autotools (compare pcre.h, which is now distributed as pcre.h.generic).

 5. Updated the support (such as it is) for Virtual Pascal, thanks to Stefan
    Weber: (1) pcre_internal.h was missing some function renames; (2) updated
    makevp.bat for the current PCRE, using the additional files
    makevp_c.txt, makevp_l.txt, and pcregexp.pas.

 6. A Windows user reported a minor discrepancy with test 2, which turned out
    to be caused by a trailing space on an input line that had got lost in his
    copy. The trailing space was an accident, so I've just removed it.

 7. Add -Wl,-R... flags in pcre-config.in for *BSD* systems, as I'm told
    that is needed.

 8. Mark ucp_table (in ucptable.h) and ucp_gentype (in pcre_ucp_searchfuncs.c)
    as "const" (a) because they are and (b) because it helps the PHP
    maintainers who have recently made a script to detect big data structures
    in the php code that should be moved to the .rodata section. I remembered
    to update Builducptable as well, so it won't revert if ucptable.h is ever
    re-created.

 9. Added some extra #ifdef SUPPORT_UTF8 conditionals into pcretest.c,
    pcre_printint.src, pcre_compile.c, pcre_study.c, and pcre_tables.c, in
    order to be able to cut out the UTF-8 tables in the latter when UTF-8
    support is not required. This saves 1.5-2K of code, which is important in
    some applications.

    Later: more #ifdefs are needed in pcre_ord2utf8.c and pcre_valid_utf8.c
    so as not to refer to the tables, even though these functions will never be
    called when UTF-8 support is disabled. Otherwise there are problems with a
    shared library.

10. Fixed two bugs in the emulated memmove() function in pcre_internal.h:

    (a) It was defining its arguments as char * instead of void *.

    (b) It was assuming that all moves were upwards in memory; this was true
        a long time ago when I wrote it, but is no longer the case.

    The emulated memove() is provided for those environments that have neither
    memmove() nor bcopy(). I didn't think anyone used it these days, but that
    is clearly not the case, as these two bugs were recently reported.

11. The script PrepareRelease is now distributed: it calls 132html, CleanTxt,
    and Detrail to create the HTML documentation, the .txt form of the man
    pages, and it removes trailing spaces from listed files. It also creates
    pcre.h.generic and config.h.generic from pcre.h and config.h. In the latter
    case, it wraps all the #defines with #ifndefs. This script should be run
    before "make dist".

12. Fixed two fairly obscure bugs concerned with quantified caseless matching
    with Unicode property support.

    (a) For a maximizing quantifier, if the two different cases of the
        character were of different lengths in their UTF-8 codings (there are
        some cases like this - I found 11), and the matching function had to
        back up over a mixture of the two cases, it incorrectly assumed they
        were both the same length.

    (b) When PCRE was configured to use the heap rather than the stack for
        recursion during matching, it was not correctly preserving the data for
        the other case of a UTF-8 character when checking ahead for a match
        while processing a minimizing repeat. If the check also involved
        matching a wide character, but failed, corruption could cause an
        erroneous result when trying to check for a repeat of the original
        character.

13. Some tidying changes to the testing mechanism:

    (a) The RunTest script now detects the internal link size and whether there
        is UTF-8 and UCP support by running ./pcretest -C instead of relying on
        values substituted by "configure". (The RunGrepTest script already did
        this for UTF-8.) The configure.ac script no longer substitutes the
        relevant variables.

    (b) The debugging options /B and /D in pcretest show the compiled bytecode
        with length and offset values. This means that the output is different
        for different internal link sizes. Test 2 is skipped for link sizes
        other than 2 because of this, bypassing the problem. Unfortunately,
        there was also a test in test 3 (the locale tests) that used /B and
        failed for link sizes other than 2. Rather than cut the whole test out,
        I have added a new /Z option to pcretest that replaces the length and
        offset values with spaces. This is now used to make test 3 independent
        of link size. (Test 2 will be tidied up later.)

14. If erroroffset was passed as NULL to pcre_compile, it provoked a
    segmentation fault instead of returning the appropriate error message.

15. In multiline mode when the newline sequence was set to "any", the pattern
    ^$ would give a match between the \r and \n of a subject such as "A\r\nB".
    This doesn't seem right; it now treats the CRLF combination as the line
    ending, and so does not match in that case. It's only a pattern such as ^$
    that would hit this one: something like ^ABC$ would have failed after \r
    and then tried again after \r\n.

16. Changed the comparison command for RunGrepTest from "diff -u" to "diff -ub"
    in an attempt to make files that differ only in their line terminators
    compare equal. This works on Linux.

17. Under certain error circumstances pcregrep might try to free random memory
    as it exited. This is now fixed, thanks to valgrind.

19. In pcretest, if the pattern /(?m)^$/g<any> was matched against the string
    "abc\r\n\r\n", it found an unwanted second match after the second \r. This
    was because its rules for how to advance for /g after matching an empty
    string at the end of a line did not allow for this case. They now check for
    it specially.

20. pcretest is supposed to handle patterns and data of any length, by
    extending its buffers when necessary. It was getting this wrong when the
    buffer for a data line had to be extended.

21. Added PCRE_NEWLINE_ANYCRLF which is like ANY, but matches only CR, LF, or
    CRLF as a newline sequence.

22. Code for handling Unicode properties in pcre_dfa_exec() wasn't being cut
    out by #ifdef SUPPORT_UCP. This did no harm, as it could never be used, but
    I have nevertheless tidied it up.

23. Added some casts to kill warnings from HP-UX ia64 compiler.

24. Added a man page for pcre-config.

- update to new version 7.0
  Changes: As well as a number of bugfixes, there has been a major
  refactoring of the compiling code, which makes it easier to add new
  features, including some new optimizations. A QuoteMeta function has been
  added to the C++ wrapper. There is now a mode in which all Unicode newline
  sequences are recognized. Support for the Perl 5.10 syntax for features
  that were previously in PCRE but not in Perl (named groups, possessive
  quantifiers) has been added.

Mon Jul 10 16:29:14 CEST 2006 - ms@suse.de

- update to new version 6.7
- finally removed evil configure patch
- When UTF-8 mode was not set, PCRE looped when compiling certain patterns
  containing an extended class (one that cannot be represented by a bitmap
  because it contains high-valued characters or Unicode property items, e.g.
  [\pZ]). Almost always one would set UTF-8 mode when processing such a
  pattern, but PCRE should not loop if you do not (it no longer does).
  [Detail: two cases were found: (a) a repeated subpattern containing an
  extended class; (b) a recursive reference to a subpattern that followed a
  previous extended class. It wasn't skipping over the extended class
  correctly when UTF-8 mode was not set.]
- Applied a patch from the folks at Google to pcrecpp.cc, to fix "another
  instance of the 'standard' template library not being so standard".
