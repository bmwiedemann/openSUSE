  <title>Python XMPP (Jabber) Library that Implements Everything as a Plugin</title>
  <description>SleekXMPP is a pet project of an XMPP enthusiast. The goals of the project are
ease of implementation, and complete draft XEP (XMPP Extended Protocol)
coverage. Ideally the community will be able to use this for bots, easy XEP
protocoling, etc.
