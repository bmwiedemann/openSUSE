    <comment>- Changes file cleanup

- Update to version 0.12
  * Features
    - The interface argument to IReactorTCP.listenTCP may now be an IPv6
      address literal, allowing the creation of IPv6 TCP servers.
    - twisted.python.constants.Names now provides a way to define
      collections of named constants, similar to the &quot;enum type&quot; feature
      of C or Java.
    - twisted.python.constants.Values now provides a way to define
      collections of named constants with arbitrary values.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed an obscure case where connectionLost wasn't called on the
      protocol when using half-close.
    - UDP ports handle socket errors better on Windows.
    - When idle, the gtk2 and glib2 reactors no longer wake up 10 times a
      second.
    - Prevent a rare situation involving TLS transports, where a producer
      may be erroneously left unpaused.
    - twisted.internet.iocpreactor.iocpsupport now has fewer 64-bit
      compile warnings.
    - The GTK2 reactor is now more responsive on Windows.
    - TLS transports now correctly handle producer registration after the
      connection has been lost.
    - twisted.protocols.htb.Bucket now empties properly with a non-zero
      drip rate.
    - IReactorSSL and ITCPTransport.startTLS now synchronously propagate
      errors from the getContext method of context factories, instead of
      being capturing them and logging them as unhandled.
  * Improved Documentation</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 13.2.0:
  + Twisted now includes a HostnameEndpoint implementation which uses IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel, speeding up the connection by using whichever connects first (the 'Happy Eyeballs'/RFC 6555 algorithm). (#4859)
  + Improved support for Cancellable Deferreds by kaizhang, our GSoC student. (#4320, #6532, #6572, #6639)
  + Improved Twisted.Mail documentation by shira, our Outreach Program for Women intern. (#6649, #6652)
  + twistd now waits for the application to start successfully before exiting after daemonization. (#823)
  + SSL server endpoint string descriptions now support the specification of chain certificates. (#6499)
  + Over 70 closed tickets since 13.1.0.</comment>

  * Prevent CRLF injections described in CVE-2019-12387

- Update to 19.2.0:
  * twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now uses 32 random bytes instead of an MD5 hash for the ssl session identifier context. (#9463)
  * DeferredLock and DeferredSemaphore can be used as asynchronous context managers on Python 3.5+. (#9546)
  * t.i.b.BaseConnector has custom __repr__ (#9548)
  * twisted.internet.ssl.optionsForClientTLS now supports validating IP addresses from the certificate subjectAltName (#9585)
  * Twisted's minimum Cryptography requirement is now 2.5. (#9592)
  * twisted.conch.ssh.keys can now read private keys in the new &quot;openssh-key-v1&quot; format, introduced in OpenSSH 6.5 and made the default in OpenSSH 7.8. (#9515)
  * twisted.web.client.HostnameCachingHTTPSPolicy was added as a new contextFactory option. The policy caches a specified number of twisted.internet.interfaces.IOpenSSLClientConnectionCreator instances to to avoid the cost of instantiating a connection creator for multiple requests to the same host. (#9138)
- Remove merged patches:
  * openssl-errormsg.aptch
  * openssl111.patch
- Add patch to tests for new hyperlink:
  * hyperlink.patch</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 19.10.0:
  * twisted.trial.successResultOf, twisted.trial.failureResultOf, and twisted.trial.assertNoResult accept coroutines as well as Deferreds. (#9006)
  * Fixed circular import in twisted.trial.reporter, introduced in Twisted 16.0.0. (#8267)
  * The POP3 server implemented by twisted.mail.pop3 now accepts passwords that contain spaces. (#9100)
  * Incoming HTTP/2 connections will now not time out if they persist for longer than one minute. (#9653)
  * twisted.conch.ssh.keys now correctly writes the &quot;iqmp&quot; parameter in serialized RSA private keys as q^-1 mod p rather than p^-1 mod q. (#9681)
  * twisted.web.server.Request will now use twisted.web.server.Site.getContentFile, if it exists, to get a file into which to write request content. If getContentFile is not provided by the site, it will fall back to the previous behavior of using io.BytesIO for small requests and tempfile.TemporaryFile for large ones. (#9655)
  * twisted.web.client.FileBodyProducer will now stop producing when the Deferred returned by FileBodyProducer.startProducing is cancelled. (#9547)
  * The HTTP/2 server implementation now enforces TCP flow control on control frame messages and times out clients that send invalid data without reading responses. This closes CVE-2019-9512 (Ping Flood), CVE-2019-9514 (Reset Flood), and CVE-2019-9515 (Settings Flood). Thanks to Jonathan Looney and Piotr Sikora. (#9694)

    <comment>- Update to 21.2.0:
  * Features
    + The enableSessions argument to twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now
    + actually enables/disables OpenSSL's session cache. Also, due to
    + session-related bugs, it defaults to False. (#9583)
    + twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks and ensureDeferred will now associate a contextvars.Context with the coroutines they run, meaning that ContextVar objects will maintain their value within the same coroutine, similarly to asyncio Tasks. This functionality requires Python 3.7+, or the contextvars PyPI backport to be installed for Python 3.5-3.6. (#9719, #9826)
    + twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.fromCoroutine has been added. This is similar to the existing ensureDeferred function, but is named more consistently inside Twisted and does not pass through Deferreds. (#9825)
    + trial now allows the @unittest.skipIf decorator to specify that an entire test class should be skipped. (#9829)
    + The twisted.python.deprecate.deprecatedKeywordParameter decorator can be used to mark a keyword paramater of a function or method as deprecated. (#9844)
    + Projects using Twisted can now perform type checking against a Twisted
    + installation, for example using mypy. (#9908)
    + twisted.python.util.InsensitiveDict now fully implements MutableMapping. (#9919)
    + Python 3.8 is now tested and supported. (#9955)
    + Support a coroutine function in twisted.internet.task.react (#9974)
    + PyPy 3.7 is now tested and supported. (#10093)
  * Bugfixes
    + twisted.web.twcgi.CGIProcessProtocol.processEnded(...) now handles an already-finished request, for example when request.connectionLost(...) was called previously. (#9468)
    + Twisted's dependency on PyHamcrest has been moved from the base package to the new &quot;test&quot; extra. Consequently the test extra must be installed for Twisted's test suite to pass. (#9509)
    + Fixed serialization of timedelta, date, and time objects in twisted.spread. (#9716)
    + twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor now raises an exception if instantiated with an event loop which is not compatible with asyncio.SelectorEventLoop. This fixes the AsyncioSelectorReactor in Python 3.8+ on Windows, where in bp-34687 the default Windows asyncio event loop was changed to ProactorEventLoop. Applications that use AsyncioSelectorReactor on Windows with Python 3.8+ must call asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy()) before instantiating and running AsyncioSelectorReactor. (#9766)
    + twisted.internet.process.registerReapProcessHandler and ._BaseProcess.reapProcess will no longer raise a TypeError when processing a None PID (#9775)
    + INotify will close its file descriptor if a directory is automatically removed by twisted from the watchlist because it's deleted, avoiding orphaned filedescriptors. (#9777)
    + DelayedCall.reset() is now working properly with asyncioreactor (#9780)
    + AsyncioSelectorReactor.seconds() now correctly returns an epoch time. (#9787)
    + The _connDone parameter has been removed from twisted.internet.abstract.FileDescriptor.loseConnection()'s signature in order to match the signature in the base class twisted.internet._newtls.ConnectionMixin loseConnection(). (#9849)
    + The Gtk3 reactor now runs on Wayland-only sessions (#9904)
    + Descriptive error messages from twisted.internet.error are now present when running with 'python -OO'. (#9918)
    + Comparator methods such as eq() now always return NotImplemented for uncomparable types. (#9919)
    + When installing Twisted it now requires a minimum Python 3.5.4 version to match the version used with automated testing. This is the minimum Python version that we know that Twisted works with. (#10098)

  * install alternatives as master and slave links now
- Add no-test_successResultOfWithFailureHasTraceback.patch to
  skip sted.conch.test.test_keys.KeyTests.test_fromOpenSSH,
  which fails. Upstream suggests

  been confirmed, even less fixed.
- Update to 20.3.0
  * drop Python 2
  * twisted.news is deprecated.

  * twisted.conch.ssh.keys now correctly writes the &quot;iqmp&quot; parameter in serialized RSA private keys as q^-1 mod p rather than p^-1 mod q. (#9681)
  * twisted.web.server.Request will now use twisted.web.server.Site.getContentFile, if it exists, to get a file into which to write request content. If getContentFile is not provided by the site, it will fall back to the previous behavior of using io.BytesIO for small requests and tempfile.TemporaryFile for large ones. (#9655)
  * twisted.web.client.FileBodyProducer will now stop producing when the Deferred returned by FileBodyProducer.startProducing is cancelled. (#9547)
  * The HTTP/2 server implementation now enforces TCP flow control on control frame messages and times out clients that send invalid data without reading responses. This closes CVE-2019-9512 (Ping Flood), CVE-2019-9514 (Reset Flood), and CVE-2019-9515 (Settings Flood). Thanks to Jonathan Looney and Piotr Sikora. (#9694)

- Update to version 15.5.0
  * This is the last Twisted release where Python 2.6 is supported, on
    any platform. Python 3.5 (on POSIX) support has been added.
  * This release introduces changes that are required for Conch's SSH
    implementation to work with OpenSSH 6.9+ servers.
  * twisted.python.url is a new abstraction for URLs, supporting RFC
    3987 IRIs. (#5388)
  * twisted.python.logfile is now ported to Python 3. (#6749)
  * twisted.python.zippath has been ported to Python 3. (#6917)
  * twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions and
    twisted.internet.ssl.optionsForClientTLS now take a
    acceptableProtocols parameter that enables negotiation of the next
    protocol to speak after the TLS handshake has completed. This field
    advertises protocols over both NPN and ALPN. Also added new
    INegotiated interface for TLS interfaces that support protocol
    negotiation. This interface adds a negotiatedProtocol property that
    reports what protocol, if any, was negotiated in the TLS handshake.
    (#7860)
  * twisted.python.urlpath.URLPath now operates correctly on Python 3,
    using bytes instead of strings, and introduces the fromBytes
    constructor to assist with creating them cross-version. (#7994)
  * twisted.application.strports is now ported to Python 3. (#8011)
  * twistd (the Twisted Daemon) is now ported to Python 3. (#8012)
  * Python 3.5 is now supported on POSIX platforms. (#8042)
  * twisted.internet.serialport is now ported on Python 3. (#8099)
  * twisted.logger.formatEvent now can format an event if it was
    flattened (twisted.logger.eventAsJSON does this) and has text after
    the last replacement field. (#8003)
  * twisted.cred.checkers.FilePasswordDB now logs an error if the
    credentials db file does not exist, no longer raises an unhandled
    error. (#8028)
  * twisted.python.threadpool.ThreadPool now properly starts enough
    threads to do any work scheduled before ThreadPool.start() is
    called, such as when work is scheduled in the reactor via
    reactor.callInThread() before reactor.run(). (#8090)
  * Twisted Development test standard documentation now contain
    information about avoiding test data files. (#6535)
  * The documentation for twisted.internet.defer.DeferredSemaphore now
    describes the actual usage for limit and tokens instance
    attributes. (#8024)
  * twisted.python._initgroups, a C extension, has been removed and
    stdlib support is now always used instead. (#5861)
  * Python 2.6 is no longer supported. (#8017)
  * twisted.python.util.OrderedDict is now deprecated, and uses of it
    in Twisted are replaced with collections.OrderedDict. (#8051)
  * twisted.persisted.sob.load, twisted.persisted.sob.loadValueFromFile
    and twisted.persisted.sob.Persistent.save() are now deprecated when
    used with a passphrase. The encyption used by these methods are
    weak. (#8081)
  * twisted.internet.interfaces.IStreamClientEndpointStringParser has
    been removed and Twisted will no longer use parsers implementing
    this interface. (#8094)
  * #5976, #6628, #6894, #6980, #7228, #7693, #7731, #7997, #8046,

    assertFalse methods now pass through the standard library's more
    informative failure messages. (#6306)
  * The new package twisted.logger provides a new, fully tested, and
    feature-rich logging framework. The old module twisted.python.log
    is now implemented using the new framework. The new logger HOWTO
    documents the new framework. (#6750)
  * twisted.python.modules is now ported to Python 3. (#7804)
  * twisted.python.filepath.FilePath now supports Unicode (text) paths.
    Like the os module, instantiating it with a Unicode path will
    return a Unicode-mode FilePath, instantiating with a bytes path
    will return a bytes-mode FilePath. (#7805)
  * twisted.internet.kqreactor is now ported to Python 3 (#7823)
  * twisted.internet.endpoints.ProcessEndpoint is now ported to Python
    3. (#7824)

    to validate idna2008 names. (#7853)
  * Don't raise an exception if `DefaultLogObserver.emit()` gets an
    event with a message that raises when `repr()` is called on it.
    Specifically: use `textFromEventDict()` instead of a separate (and
    inferior) message rendering implementation. (#6569)
  * twisted.cred.credentials.DigestedCredentials incorrectly handled
    md5-sess hashing according to the RFC, which has now been fixed.
    (#7835)
  * Fixed an issue with twisted.internet.task.LoopingCall.withCount
    where sometimes the passed callable would be invoked with &quot;0&quot; when
    we got close to tricky floating point boundary conditions. (#7836)
  * twisted.internet.defer now properly works with the new logging
    system. (#7851)
  * Change `messages` key to `log_io` for events generated by
    `LoggingFile`. (#7852)
  * twisted.logger had literal characters in docstrings that are now
    quoted. (#7854)
  * twisted.logger now correctly formats a log event with a key named
    `message` when passed to a legacy log observer. (#7855)
  * twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint now uses getaddrinfo
    properly on Python 3.4 and above. (#7886)
  * Fix a typo in narrative documentation for logger (#7875)
  * tkunzip and tapconvert in twisted.scripts were deprecated in 11.0
    and 12.1 respectively, and are now removed. (#6747)

    twisted.trial.reporter.Reporter contained deprecated methods (since
    8.0) which have now been removed. (#7815)
  * #6027, #7287, #7701, #7727, #7758, #7776, #7786, #7812, #7819,
    #7831, #7838, #7865, #7866, #7869, #7872, #7877, #7878, #7885
  * twisted.conch.ssh.forwarding now supports local-&gt;remote forwarding
    of IPv6 (#7751)
  * twisted.mail.smtp.sendmail now uses ESMTP. It will
    opportunistically enable encryption and allow the use of
    authentication. (#7257)
  * twisted.web.static is now ported to Python 3. (#6177)
  * twisted.web.server.Site accepts requestFactory as constructor
    argument. (#7016)

    since 12.1 that have now been removed. (#7828)
  * #6927, #7797, #7802, #7846
  * The resumeOffset argument to

    - twisted.protocols.amp now provides a ListOf argument type which can be
      composed with some other argument types to create a zero or more element
      sequence of that type.
    - If returnValue is invoked outside of a function decorated with
      @inlineCallbacks, but causes a function thusly decorated to exit, a
      DeprecationWarning will be emitted explaining this potentially confusing
      behavior. In a future release, this will cause an exception.
    - twisted.python.logfile.BaseLogFile now has a reopen method allowing to
      use an external logrotate mechanism.
  * Bugfixes:
    - FTP.ftp_NLST now handles requests on invalid paths in a way consistent
      with RFC 959.
    - twisted.python.util.initgroups now calls the low-level C initgroups by
      default if available: the python version can create lots of I/O with certain
      authentication setup to retrieve all the necessary information.
    - startLogging now does nothing on subsequent invocations, thus fixing a
      terrible infinite recursion bug that's only on edge case.
    - Stringify non-string data to NetstringReceiver.sendString before
      calculating the length so that the calculated length is equal to the actual
      length of the transported data.
    - twisted.python.win32.cmdLineQuote now correctly quotes empty strings arguments.
    - Change the behavior of the Gtk2Reactor to register only one source watch for
      each file descriptor, instead of one for reading and one for writing. In
      particular, it fixes a bug with Glib under Windows where we failed to notify
      when a client is connected.
    - Twisted Trial no longer crashes if it can't remove an old _trial_temp directory.
    - The optional _c_urlarg extension now handles unquote(&quot;&quot;) correctly on
      platforms where malloc(0) returns NULL, such as AIX. It also compiles with less warnings.
    - On POSIX, child processes created with reactor.spawnProcess will no longer
      automatically ignore the signals which the parent process has set to be ignored.
    - All SOCKSv4a tests now use a dummy reactor with a deterministic resolve method.
    - Prevent extraneous server, date and content-type headers in proxy responses.
  * Deprecations and Removals:
    - twisted.internet.error.PotentialZombieWarning is now deprecated.
    - twisted.test.time_helpers is now deprecated.
    - The deprecated connectUDP method of IReactorUDP has now been removed.
    - twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase now ignores the previously deprecated
      setUpClass and tearDownClass methods.
- Renamed to python-Twisted from python-twisted
- remove unreferenced patch
- do not package executable docs
- Standardized &quot;Authors:&quot; format in descriptions of python-twisted.spec

    <comment>- Update to 22.2.0:
  * Bugfixes
    + twisted.internet.gireactor.PortableGIReactor.simulate and
      twisted.internet.gtk2reactor.PortableGtkReactor.simulate no longer
      raises TypeError when there are no delayed called. This was a
      regression introduced with the migration to Python 3 in which the
      builtin min function no longer accepts None as an argument. (#9660)
    + twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHTransportBase now disconnects the
      remote peer if the SSH version string is not sent in the first
      4096 bytes. (#10284, CVE-2022-21716, GHSA-rv6r-3f5q-9rgx)
  * Improved Documentation
    + Add type annotations for twisted.web.http.Request.getHeader. (#10270)
  * Deprecations and Removals
    + Support for Python 3.6, which is EoL as of 2021-09-04, has been
      deprecated. (#10303)
- Add patch CVE-2022-24801-http-1.1-leniency.patch:
  * Be stricter about HTTP/1.1 headers. (bsc#1198086)</comment>

    <time>1667389597</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 22.10.0:
  * Features
    + twisted.internet.defer.maybeDeferred will now schedule a coroutine
      result as asynchronous operation and return a Deferred that fires with
      the result of the coroutine.
    + Twisted now works with Cryptography versions 37 and above, and as a
      result, its minimum TLS protocol version has been upgraded to TLSv1.2.
    + The systemd: endpoint parser now supports &quot;named&quot; file descriptors. This
      is a more reliable mechanism for choosing among several inherited
      descriptors.
  * Bugfixes
    + twisted.internet.base.DelayedCall.__repr__ will no longer raise
      AttributeError if the DelayedCall was created before debug mode was
      enabled. As a side-effect, twisted.internet.base.DelayedCall.creator is
      now defined as None in cases where previously it was undefined.
    + twisted.internet.iocpreactor.udp now properly re-queues its listener
      when there is a failure condition on the read from the socket.
    + twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks no longer causes confusing
      StopIteration tracebacks to be added to the top of tracebacks
      originating in triggered callbacks.
    + The typing of twisted.internet.task.react no longer constrains the
      type of argv.
    + ContextVar.reset() now works correctly inside inlineCallbacks functions
      and coroutines.
    + Implement twisted.python.failure._Code.co_positions for compatibility
      with Python 3.11.
    + twisted.pair.tuntap._TUNSETIFF and ._TUNGETIFF values are now correct
      parisc, powerpc and sparc architectures. 
    + twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost will no longerreturn a NoResource
      error. (bsc#1204781, CVE-2022-39348)</comment>
