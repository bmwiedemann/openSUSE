Mon Oct 12 21:14:33 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add no-test_successResultOfWithFailureHasTraceback.patch to
  skip sted.conch.test.test_keys.KeyTests.test_fromOpenSSH,
  which fails. Upstream suggests
  https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9665, but it has never
  been confirmed, even less fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 28 12:43:51 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 20.3.0
  * drop Python 2
  * twisted.news is deprecated.

Wed Dec  4 05:01:47 UTC 2019 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 19.10.0 bsc#1162424:
  * twisted.trial.successResultOf, twisted.trial.failureResultOf, and twisted.trial.assertNoResult accept coroutines as well as Deferreds. (#9006)
  * Fixed circular import in twisted.trial.reporter, introduced in Twisted 16.0.0. (#8267)
  * The POP3 server implemented by twisted.mail.pop3 now accepts passwords that contain spaces. (#9100)
  * Incoming HTTP/2 connections will now not time out if they persist for longer than one minute. (#9653)
  * twisted.conch.ssh.keys now correctly writes the "iqmp" parameter in serialized RSA private keys as q^-1 mod p rather than p^-1 mod q. (#9681)
  * twisted.web.server.Request will now use twisted.web.server.Site.getContentFile, if it exists, to get a file into which to write request content. If getContentFile is not provided by the site, it will fall back to the previous behavior of using io.BytesIO for small requests and tempfile.TemporaryFile for large ones. (#9655)
  * twisted.web.client.FileBodyProducer will now stop producing when the Deferred returned by FileBodyProducer.startProducing is cancelled. (#9547)
  * The HTTP/2 server implementation now enforces TCP flow control on control frame messages and times out clients that send invalid data without reading responses. This closes CVE-2019-9512 (Ping Flood), CVE-2019-9514 (Reset Flood), and CVE-2019-9515 (Settings Flood). Thanks to Jonathan Looney and Piotr Sikora. (#9694)
- Add python-38-xml-namespace.patch to fix dictionary mutation under Python 3.8
- Add python-38-hmac-digestmod.patch to add digestmod parameter where required
- Add python-38-no-cgi-parseqs.patch to no longer import parse_qs from cgi

  * Add new twisted.logger.capturedLogs context manager for capturing observed log events in tests. (#9617)
  * twisted.internet.base.PluggableResolverMixin, which implements the pluggable resolver interfaces for easier re-use in other reactors, has been factored out of ReactorBase. (#9632)
  * The PyPI page for Twisted has been enhanced to include more information and useful links. (#9648)

Wed Dec  2 02:35:45 UTC 2015 - termim@gmail.com

- Update to version 15.5.0

  * This is the last Twisted release where Python 2.6 is supported, on
    any platform. Python 3.5 (on POSIX) support has been added.
  * This release introduces changes that are required for Conch's SSH
    implementation to work with OpenSSH 6.9+ servers.
  * twisted.python.url is a new abstraction for URLs, supporting RFC
    3987 IRIs. (#5388)
  * twisted.python.logfile is now ported to Python 3. (#6749)
  * twisted.python.zippath has been ported to Python 3. (#6917)
  * twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions and
    twisted.internet.ssl.optionsForClientTLS now take a
    acceptableProtocols parameter that enables negotiation of the next
    protocol to speak after the TLS handshake has completed. This field
    advertises protocols over both NPN and ALPN. Also added new
    INegotiated interface for TLS interfaces that support protocol
    negotiation. This interface adds a negotiatedProtocol property that
    reports what protocol, if any, was negotiated in the TLS handshake.
    (#7860)
  * twisted.python.urlpath.URLPath now operates correctly on Python 3,
    using bytes instead of strings, and introduces the fromBytes
    constructor to assist with creating them cross-version. (#7994)
  * twisted.application.strports is now ported to Python 3. (#8011)
  * twistd (the Twisted Daemon) is now ported to Python 3. (#8012)
  * Python 3.5 is now supported on POSIX platforms. (#8042)
  * twisted.internet.serialport is now ported on Python 3. (#8099)
  * twisted.logger.formatEvent now can format an event if it was
    flattened (twisted.logger.eventAsJSON does this) and has text after
    the last replacement field. (#8003)
  * twisted.cred.checkers.FilePasswordDB now logs an error if the
    credentials db file does not exist, no longer raises an unhandled
    error. (#8028)
  * twisted.python.threadpool.ThreadPool now properly starts enough
    threads to do any work scheduled before ThreadPool.start() is
    called, such as when work is scheduled in the reactor via
    reactor.callInThread() before reactor.run(). (#8090)
  * Twisted Development test standard documentation now contain
    information about avoiding test data files. (#6535)
  * The documentation for twisted.internet.defer.DeferredSemaphore now
    describes the actual usage for limit and tokens instance
    attributes. (#8024)
  * twisted.python._initgroups, a C extension, has been removed and
    stdlib support is now always used instead. (#5861)
  * Python 2.6 is no longer supported. (#8017)
  * twisted.python.util.OrderedDict is now deprecated, and uses of it
    in Twisted are replaced with collections.OrderedDict. (#8051)
  * twisted.persisted.sob.load, twisted.persisted.sob.loadValueFromFile
    and twisted.persisted.sob.Persistent.save() are now deprecated when
    used with a passphrase. The encyption used by these methods are
    weak. (#8081)
  * twisted.internet.interfaces.IStreamClientEndpointStringParser has
    been removed and Twisted will no longer use parsers implementing
    this interface. (#8094)
  * #5976, #6628, #6894, #6980, #7228, #7693, #7731, #7997, #8046,
    #8054, #8056, #8060, #8063, #8064, #8068, #8072, #8091, #8095,
    #8096, #8098, #8106

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 12 11:57:51 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

  is the only one that supports python 3 so far.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 12 10:19:03 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Implement update-alternatives in preparation for python 3 version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * lore removed
  * please see the NEWS file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 11 08:52:37 UTC 2015 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- change dep from python-asn1 to python-pyasn1 (renamed long ago)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 04 11:36:06 UTC 2015 - termim@gmail.com

- Wrong dependency rpm name, should be python-pycrypto

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 29 01:16:06 UTC 2015 - termim@gmail.com

- Add missing dependencies on python-asn1 and python-Crypto
- Update to version 15.2.1:
  * twisted.logger now marks the `isError` key correctly on legacy
    events generated by writes to stderr. (#7903)
  * twisted.logger's documentation is now correctly listed in the table
    of contents. (#7904)
- Changes from version 15.2.0:
  * twisted.internet.process has now been ported to Python 3. (#5987)
  * twisted.cred.credentials is now ported to Python 3. (#6176)
  * twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase's assertEqual, assertTrue, and
    assertFalse methods now pass through the standard library's more
    informative failure messages. (#6306)
  * The new package twisted.logger provides a new, fully tested, and
    feature-rich logging framework. The old module twisted.python.log
    is now implemented using the new framework. The new logger HOWTO
    documents the new framework. (#6750)
  * twisted.python.modules is now ported to Python 3. (#7804)
  * twisted.python.filepath.FilePath now supports Unicode (text) paths.
    Like the os module, instantiating it with a Unicode path will
    return a Unicode-mode FilePath, instantiating with a bytes path
    will return a bytes-mode FilePath. (#7805)
  * twisted.internet.kqreactor is now ported to Python 3 (#7823)
  * twisted.internet.endpoints.ProcessEndpoint is now ported to Python
    3. (#7824)
  * twisted.python.filepath.FilePath now has asBytesMode and asTextMode
    methods which return a FilePath in the requested mode. (#7830)
  * twisted.python.components.proxyForInterface now creates method
    proxies that can be used with functools.wraps. (#7832)
  * The tls optional dependency will now also install the idna package
    to validate idna2008 names. (#7853)
  * Don't raise an exception if `DefaultLogObserver.emit()` gets an
    event with a message that raises when `repr()` is called on it.
    Specifically: use `textFromEventDict()` instead of a separate (and
    inferior) message rendering implementation. (#6569)
  * twisted.cred.credentials.DigestedCredentials incorrectly handled
    md5-sess hashing according to the RFC, which has now been fixed.
    (#7835)
  * Fixed an issue with twisted.internet.task.LoopingCall.withCount
    where sometimes the passed callable would be invoked with "0" when
    we got close to tricky floating point boundary conditions. (#7836)
  * twisted.internet.defer now properly works with the new logging
    system. (#7851)
  * Change `messages` key to `log_io` for events generated by
    `LoggingFile`. (#7852)
  * twisted.logger had literal characters in docstrings that are now
    quoted. (#7854)
  * twisted.logger now correctly formats a log event with a key named
    `message` when passed to a legacy log observer. (#7855)
  * twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint now uses getaddrinfo
    properly on Python 3.4 and above. (#7886)
  * Fix a typo in narrative documentation for logger (#7875)
  * tkunzip and tapconvert in twisted.scripts were deprecated in 11.0
    and 12.1 respectively, and are now removed. (#6747)
  * twisted.protocols.gps is deprecated in preference to
    twisted.positioning. (#6810)
  * twisted.scripts.tap2deb and twisted.scripts.tap2rpm are now
    deprecated. (#7682)
  * twisted.trial.reporter.TestResult and
    twisted.trial.reporter.Reporter contained deprecated methods (since
    8.0) which have now been removed. (#7815)
  * #6027, #7287, #7701, #7727, #7758, #7776, #7786, #7812, #7819,
    #7831, #7838, #7865, #7866, #7869, #7872, #7877, #7878, #7885
  * twisted.conch.ssh.forwarding now supports local->remote forwarding
    of IPv6 (#7751)
  * twisted.mail.smtp.sendmail now uses ESMTP. It will
    opportunistically enable encryption and allow the use of
    authentication. (#7257)
  * twisted.web.static is now ported to Python 3. (#6177)
  * twisted.web.server.Site accepts requestFactory as constructor
    argument. (#7016)
  * twisted.web.util had some HTML generation functions deprecated
    since 12.1 that have now been removed. (#7828)
  * #6927, #7797, #7802, #7846
  * The resumeOffset argument to
    twisted.words.protocol.irc.DccFileReceive now works as it is
    documented. (#7775)

- Update to version 3.0.0
  + Features
   - The twisted.protocols.ftp.FTP server now treats "LIST -La", "LIST
     -al", and all other combinations of ordering and case of the "-l"
     and "-a" flags the same: by ignoring them rather than treating them
     as a pathname. (#1333)
   - twisted.python.log.FileLogObserver now uses `datetime.strftime` to
     format timestamps, adding support for microseconds and timezone
     offsets to the `timeFormat` string. (#3513)
   - trial now deterministically runs tests in the order in which they
     were specified on the command line, instead of quasi-randomly
     according to dictionary key ordering. (#5520)
   - Cooperator.running can be used to determine the current cooperator
     status. (#5937)
   - twisted.python.modules.PythonPath now implements `__contains__` to
     allow checking, by name, whether a particular module exists within
     it. (#6198)
   - twisted.application.internet.TimerService.stopService now waits for
     any currently running call to finish before firing its deferred.
     (#6290)
  + Bugfixes
   - twisted.protocols.ftp.FTP now recognizes all glob expressions
     supported by fnmatch. (#4181)
   - Constant values defined using twisted.python.constants can now be
     set as attributes of other classes without triggering an unhandled
     AttributeError from the constants implementation. (#5797)
   - Fixed problem where twisted.names.client.Resolver was not closing
     open file handles which can lead to an out of file descriptor error
     on PyPy. (#6216)
   - All reactors included in Twisted itself now gracefully handle a
     rare case involving delayed calls scheduled very far in the future.
     (#6259)
   - twisted.trial.reporter.Reporter._trimFrames correctly removes
     frames from twisted.internet.utils.runWithWarningsSuppressed again,

      Standard I/O endpoint.
    - If a FTPCmdError occurs during twisted.protocols.ftp.FTP.ftp_RETR
      sending the file (i.e. it is raised by the IReadFile.send method it
      invokes), then it will use that to return an error to the client
      rather than necessarily sending a 426 CNX_CLOSED_TXFR_ABORTED error.
    - twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorSocket.adoptStreamConnection is
      implemented by some reactors as a way to add an existing
      established connection to them.

      base class that provides usability improvements but not reactor-
      based testing features.
  * Bugfixes
    - twisted.internet.Process.signalProcess now catches ESRCH raised by
      os.kill call and raises ProcessExitedAlready instead.

  * Features
    - The interface argument to IReactorTCP.listenTCP may now be an IPv6
      address literal, allowing the creation of IPv6 TCP servers.
    - twisted.python.constants.Names now provides a way to define
      collections of named constants, similar to the "enum type" feature
      of C or Java.
    - twisted.python.constants.Values now provides a way to define
      collections of named constants with arbitrary values.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed an obscure case where connectionLost wasn't called on the
      protocol when using half-close.
    - UDP ports handle socket errors better on Windows.
    - When idle, the gtk2 and glib2 reactors no longer wake up 10 times a
      second.
    - Prevent a rare situation involving TLS transports, where a producer
      may be erroneously left unpaused.
    - twisted.internet.iocpreactor.iocpsupport now has fewer 64-bit
      compile warnings.

      connection has been lost.
    - twisted.protocols.htb.Bucket now empties properly with a non-zero
      drip rate.
    - IReactorSSL and ITCPTransport.startTLS now synchronously propagate
      errors from the getContext method of context factories, instead of
      being capturing them and logging them as unhandled.
  * Improved Documentation
    - The multicast documentation has been expanded.
    - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred now documents more return values.
    - Show a better starting page at

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 20 14:35:44 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Changed BuildRequires python-zopeinterface to python-zope.interface,
  it got renamed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  6 15:28:44 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Changed Buildrequires 'python-serial' to 'python-pyserial'

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  2 13:07:50 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 0.11:
  * Features:
    - The twistd man page now has a SIGNALS section.
    - reactor.spawnProcess now will not emit a PotentialZombieWarning when called
      before reactor.run, and there will be no potential for zombie processes in this case.
    - High-throughput applications based on Perspective Broker should now run
      noticably faster thanks to the use of a more efficient decoding function
      in Twisted Spread.
    - Documentation for trac-post-commit-hook functionality in svn-dev policy.
    - twisted.protocols.socks.SOCKSv4 now supports the SOCKSv4a protocol.
    - Trial can now output test results according to the subunit protocol, as
      long as Subunit is installed.
    - twisted.protocols.amp now provides a ListOf argument type which can be
      composed with some other argument types to create a zero or more element
      sequence of that type.
    - If returnValue is invoked outside of a function decorated with
      @inlineCallbacks, but causes a function thusly decorated to exit, a
      DeprecationWarning will be emitted explaining this potentially confusing
      behavior. In a future release, this will cause an exception.
    - twisted.python.logfile.BaseLogFile now has a reopen method allowing to
      use an external logrotate mechanism.
  * Bugfixes:
    - FTP.ftp_NLST now handles requests on invalid paths in a way consistent
      with RFC 959.
    - twisted.python.util.initgroups now calls the low-level C initgroups by
      default if available: the python version can create lots of I/O with certain
      authentication setup to retrieve all the necessary information.
    - startLogging now does nothing on subsequent invocations, thus fixing a
      terrible infinite recursion bug that's only on edge case.
    - Stringify non-string data to NetstringReceiver.sendString before
      calculating the length so that the calculated length is equal to the actual
      length of the transported data.
    - twisted.python.win32.cmdLineQuote now correctly quotes empty strings arguments.
    - Change the behavior of the Gtk2Reactor to register only one source watch for
      each file descriptor, instead of one for reading and one for writing. In
      particular, it fixes a bug with Glib under Windows where we failed to notify
      when a client is connected.
    - Twisted Trial no longer crashes if it can't remove an old _trial_temp directory.
    - The optional _c_urlarg extension now handles unquote("") correctly on
      platforms where malloc(0) returns NULL, such as AIX. It also compiles with less warnings.
    - On POSIX, child processes created with reactor.spawnProcess will no longer
      automatically ignore the signals which the parent process has set to be ignored.
    - All SOCKSv4a tests now use a dummy reactor with a deterministic resolve method.
    - Prevent extraneous server, date and content-type headers in proxy responses.
  * Deprecations and Removals:
    - twisted.internet.error.PotentialZombieWarning is now deprecated.
    - twisted.test.time_helpers is now deprecated.
    - The deprecated connectUDP method of IReactorUDP has now been removed.
    - twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase now ignores the previously deprecated
      setUpClass and tearDownClass methods.
