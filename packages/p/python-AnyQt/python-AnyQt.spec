%description
PyQt4/PyQt5 compatibility layer.

Features include:

* At the top level, AnyQt exports a Qt5 compatible module namespace along with
  some minimal renames to better support portability between different
  versions.
* The "QT_API" environment variable controls which Qt API/backend is used.
* The API can be chosen/forced programmatically (as long as no
  PyQt4/PyQt5/PySide was already imported).
* An optional compatibility import hook that denies imports from
  conflicting Qt APIs, or intercepts and fakes Qt4 API imports to use a Qt5
  compatible API (some monkey patching is involved).
