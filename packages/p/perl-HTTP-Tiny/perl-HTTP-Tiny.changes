  0.077     2021-07-22 13:07:14-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
      [ADDED]
      - Added a `patch` helper method for the HTTP `PATCH` verb.
      - If the REQUEST_METHOD environment variable is set, then CGI_HTTP_PROXY
        replaces HTTP_PROXY.
      [FIXED]
      - Unsupported scheme errors early without giving an uninitialized value
        warning first.
      - Sends Content-Length: 0 on empty body PUT/POST.  This is not in the spec,
        but some servers require this.
      - Allows optional status line reason, as clarified in RFC 7230.
      - Ignore SIGPIPE on reads as well as writes, as IO::Socket::SSL says that
        SSL reads can also send writes as a side effect.
      - Check if a server has closed a connection before preserving it for reuse.
      [DOCS]
      - Clarified that exceptions/errors result in 599 status codes.
      [PREREQS]
      - Optional IO::Socket::IP prereq must be at least version 0.32 to be used.
        This ensures correct timeout support.

  0.057     2016-04-18 10:17:00-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [ADDED]
  
      - Added support for the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable.
  
      - Added 'peer' attribute to force a connection to a particular
        server.
  
      - Added 'connected' method to allow introspection of persistent
        connections.
  
      - An array reference of redirection result hash references is included
        in the final response hash reference (but only if redirects occur).
  
      [CHANGED]
  
      - Because folded headers are obsoleted in the revised RFCs, if CRLF is
        found in header values followed by one or more spaces, they are all
        replaced by a single space.
  
      [FIXED]
  
      - Per the RFC, control headers are now sent first before other headers
        (which are sent in arbitrary order).
  
      - Only well-known headers have their case canonicalized; all other
        headers are sent in the case provided by the user.
  
      - The 'keep_alive' option now also sets the SO_KEEPALIVE option
        on the underlying socket to help with long-lived, idle connections.
  
      - Request header field values are now validated against the RFC rules
        (i.e. empty or else space-or-tab separated tokens of printable
        characters).

     [CHANGED]
 
     - Providing a custom 'Host' header is now a fatal exception.  Previously, it
       was silently ignored, as the RFC mandates that Host be set from the
       URL, but ignoring it could lead to unexpected, confusing errors.
 
     - optimized URL splitting
 
     - Passing 'undef' for any proxy attribute will prevent HTTP::Tiny from
       setting the proxy from the environment.

     [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES (from 0.039)]
 
     - The 'proxy' attribute no longer takes precedence over the
       'http_proxy' environment variable.  With the addition of http_proxy
       and https_proxy attributes (and corresponding environment variable
       defaults), the legacy 'proxy' attribute now maps to the
       all_proxy/ALL_PROXY environment variable and only takes effect when
       other proxy attributes are not defined.
 
     [ADDED (since 0.039)]
 
     - Added 'keep_alive' attribute for single-server persistent connections
       (Clinton Gormley)
