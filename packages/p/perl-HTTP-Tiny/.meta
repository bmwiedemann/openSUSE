  <title>A small, simple, correct HTTP/1.1 client</title>
  <description>This is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed primarily for doing simple
GET requests without the overhead of a large framework like
LWP::UserAgent.
It is more correct and more complete than HTTP::Lite. It supports proxies
(currently only non-authenticating ones) and redirection. It also
correctly resumes after EINTR.
