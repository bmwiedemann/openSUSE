  * Added :func:`print_black_and_white` worksheet method to set "Black
    and White" print options.

- changes from version 3.0.2:
  * Added :func:`set_top_left_cell` worksheet method to position the
    first visible cell in a worksheet.

- changes from version 3.0.1:
  * Add python_requires version to setup.py to help pip find the
    correct matching version for Python 2 and 3.

- changes from version 3.0.0:
  * This is the first Python 3 only version of XlsxWriter. It is
    approximately 10-15% faster than the Python2/3 version.  Python 2
    users should use XlsxWriter version 2.0.0, see below.

- changes from version 2.0.0:
  * This is the last XlsxWriter release to support Python 2. From now
    bug fixes and new features will only be available for Python
    3. The deprecation notice for Python 2 support in XlsxWriter has
    been in place since May 2020 and the Python community support for
    Python 2 ended in January 2020. Downloads of XlsxWriter for Python
    2 is currently less than 6% of all downloads of the library, and
    decreasing month by month.  Python 2 users should still be able to
    install versions of XlsxWriter up to this release but not any
    releases afterwards.

- changes from version 1.4.5:
  * Added Description/Alt Text and Decorative accessibility options
    for charts, textboxes and buttons. These options were already
    available for images.

- changes from version 1.4.4:
  * Added some performance improvements. Performance for larger files
    should be 5-10% better.

- changes from version 1.4.3:
  * Added support for background images in worksheets. See
    :func:`set_background` and :ref:`ex_background`.

    Excel "future" functions in Formulas. See :ref:`formula_future`,
    and the :func:`Workbook` constructor.

- changes from version 1.4.0:
  * Added fix for issue for where a y_axis font rotation of 0 was
    ignored.

- changes from version 1.3.9 :
  * Added option to set row heights and column widths in pixels via
    the :func:`set_row_pixels` and :func:`set_column_pixels` methods.

- changes from version 1.3.8 :
  * Added ability to add accessibility options "description" and
    "decorative" to images via :func:`insert_image`. :feature:`768`.
  * Added fix for datetime.timedelta values that exceed the Excel 1900
    leap day (timedeltas greater than 59 days, in hours). This is a
    backward incompatible change. :issue:`731`.
  * Added the worksheet :func:`read_only_recommended` method to set
    the Excel "Read-only Recommended" option that is available when
    saving a file.  :feature:`784`.
  * Fixed issue where temp files used in `constant_memory` mode
    weren't closed/deleted if the workbook object was garbage
    collected. :issue:`764`.
  * Fixed issue where pattern formats without colors were given a
    default black fill color. :issue:`790`.
  * Added option to set a chart crossing to 'min' as well as the
    existing 'max' option. The 'min' option isn't available in the
    Excel interface but can be enabled via VBA. :feature:`773`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 11:06:16 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.7
  * Added support for chart custom data labels
  * Added Border, Fill, Pattern and Gradient formatting to chart data labels and
    chart custom data labels.
  * Replaced internal MD5 digest used to check for duplicate images with a SHA256
    digest to avoid issues on operating systems such as Red Hat in FIPS mode
    which don't support MD5 for security reasons.
  * Added check, and warning, for worksheet tables with no data row.
    Either with or without a header row.
  * Added text alignment for textboxes. The existing options allowed the text
    area to be aligned but didn't offer control over the text within that area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 24 16:57:30 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to Release 1.2.9
  * Added support for ``stacked`` and ``percent_stacked`` Line charts.

    correctly.
    Issue `#686 <https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter/issues/686>`_.
  * Removed ``ReservedWorksheetName`` exception which was used with the reserved
    worksheet name "History" since this name is allowed in some Excel variants.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 15:38:43 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.2.7
  * Fix for duplicate images being copied to an XlsxWriter file. Excel uses an
    optimization where it only stores one copy of a repeated/duplicate image in
    a workbook. XlsxWriter didn't do this which meant that the file size would
    increase when then was a large number of repeated images. This release fixes
    that issue and replicates Excel's behavior.
  * Added documentation on :ref:`num_format_categories` and
    :ref:`num_format_locale`.
  * Added note to :func:`protect()` about how it is possible to encrypt an
    XlsxWriter file using a third party, cross platform, open source tool called
    `msoffice-crypt <https://github.com/herumi/msoffice>`_.
- Update to version 1.2.6
  * Added option to remove style from worksheet tables.
- Update to version 1.2.5

  * Added option to link textbox text from a cell. See :ref:`textbox_textlink`.
  * Added option to rotate text in a textbox. See
    :ref:`textbox_formatting_rotation`.
- Update to version 1.2.3
  * Increased allowable worksheet url length from 255 to 2079 characters, as
    supported in more recent versions of Excel. A lower or user defined limit
    can be set via the ``max_url_length`` property in the :func:`Workbook`
    constructor.
  * Fixed several issues with hyperlinks in worksheet images.
- Update to version 1.2.2
  * Fixed Python 3.8.0 warnings.
- Update to version 1.2.1
  * Added the :func:`add_write_handler` method to allow user defined types to be
    handled by the :func:`write` method. See :ref:`writing_user_types` for more
    information.
  * Add support for East Asian vertical fonts in charts.
- Update to version 1.2.0
  * Refactored exception handling around the workbook file :func:`close()`
    method to allow exceptions to be caught and handled. See
    :ref:`ex_check_close`. Also refactored the code to clean up temp files in
    the event of an exception.
  * Added the option to allow chart fonts to be rotated to 270 degrees
    to give a stacked orientation. See :ref:`chart_fonts`.
- Update to version 1.1.9
  * Another fix for issues where zipfile.py raises "ZIP does not support
    timestamps before 1980" exception.

  * Added ability to combine Doughnut and Pie charts.
  * Added gauge chart example which is a combination of a Doughnut and a Pie
    chart.
- Update to Release 1.1.7
  * Added docs on object_position.
  * Added fix for sizing of cell comment boxes when they cross columns/rows that
    have size changes that occur after the comment is written.
  * Added fix for the sizing of worksheet objects (images, charts, textboxes)
    when the underlying cell sizes have changed and the "object_position"
    parameter has been set to 1 "Move and size with cells". An additional mode 4
    has been added to simulate inserting the object in hidden rows.
    * Added object positioning for charts and textboxes, it was already supported
    for images. Note, the parameter is now called ``object_position``. The
    previous parameter name ``positioning`` is deprecated but still supported
    for images.
- Update to Release 1.1.6
  * Fixed issue where images that started in hidden rows/columns weren't placed
    correctly in the worksheet.
  * Fixed the mime-type reported by system ``file(1)``. The mime-type reported
    by "file --mime-type"/magic was incorrect for XlsxWriter files since it
    expected the ``[Content_types]`` to be the first file in the zip container.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
