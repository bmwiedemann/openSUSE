Wed Jan 28 12:18:42 UTC 2026 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.2.9:
  * Removed the `py.typed` file since it was causing a lot of
    downstream CI failures where consumers weren't handling the
    xlsxwriter types correctly or taking them into account.
  * The file will be re-added once the xlsxwriter typing is more
    comprehensive.
  * Fixed ``mypy`` implicit export error caused by the
    ``Workbook()`` type annotations changes in v3.2.7 and v3.2.6.
  * Fixed typing issue in ``Workbook()`` constructor.
  * Added an option to position custom data labels in the same
    way that the data labels can be positioned for the entire series.
  * Add border, fill, gradient and pattern formatting options for
    chart titles and also chart axis titles.
  * Fixed issue where a test function was made public incorrectly
    which caused warnings about a missing ``xlsxwriter.test`` module.
  * Added support for a :ref:`Color() <Color>` type. This is
    backwards compatible with existing Html and named color string
    types but also adds support for theme colors. See also :ref:`colors`.
  * Fixed issue where ``write_url()`` dropped implicit support
    for generic URL types due to the refactoring into a ``Url``
    type in the previous release.
  * Fixed issue where ``max_url_length`` parameter wasn't
    honored.
  * The Format class contained methods called ``set_font()``,
    ``set_size()`` and ``set_color()`` which were old internal
    testing alternatives for ``set_font_name()``, ``set_font_size()`` and
    ``set_font_color()``. Since they were intentionally internal
    methods they were removed as part of a general
    refactoring in v3.2.1. However, the alternative method names
    had leaked out into production code and the removal caused
    breaks in dependent code. These methods have been reinstated
    to prevent inadvertent breakages but may be removed in the
    future after an orderly deprecation. Users should update to the
    documented method names.
  * Added support for checkboxes via the
    :func:`insert_checkbox()` method.
  * Checkboxes are a new feature added to `Excel in 2024`_. They
    are a way of displaying a boolean value as a checkbox in a cell.
    The underlying value is still an Excel ``TRUE/FALSE`` boolean
    value and can be used in formulas and in references.
  * Added improvements to ``autofit()``.
  * Added the optional ``max_width`` parameter to the
    :func:`autofit()` method to work around the issue where the
    autofit width is too big.

- Switch building to use of PEP517 backend.
  Don't rename vba_extract.py to vba_extract, it makes things too
  complicated.

Sat Mar 16 16:20:03 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.2.0:
  * This is the 10th anniversary release of XlsxWriter.
  * Add :func:`embed_image()` worksheet method to embed images in
    cells. This is equivalent to Excel's menu item to insert an
    image using the option to "Place in Cell". It scales images
    automatically to the dimensions of the cell.
  * This has been a frequently requested feature for people
    creating spreadsheets with images for product items. See also
    :ref:`ex_embedded_images`.
  * Fix issue where a horizontal alignment format was ignored if
    indentation was also set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 13 10:28:33 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.1.9:
  * Add fix for errant XML tag in chart leader lines for non-Pie
    charts.
  * Add support for formatting the data label in chart
    trendlines.
  * Add the :func:`very_hidden()` method to hide a worksheet.
    This is similar to the :func:`hide()` method except that the
    worksheet cannot be unhidden in the the Excel user interface.
    The Excel worksheet "xlSheetVeryHidden" option can only be
    unset programmatically via VBA.
  * Added fixes for column formulas in tables that were
    overridden by table data and which also didn't take future
    functions into account.
  * Added support for chart leader lines for chart types other
    than Pie and Doughnut.
  * Added support for adding signed VBA macros to workbooks via
    the via the
  * Added support for enabling the Excel "Show #N/A as an empty
    cell" chart option via the :func:`show_na_as_empty_cell` method.
  * Added support for custom total formulas to worksheet tables.
  * Added worksheet page break preview mode via
    :func:`set_pagebreak_view()`.
  * Add support for new Excel dynamic functions added in 2023.
  * Added support for adding a color to the `invert_if_negative`
    chart option.
  * Minor fix for cell color issue.

  * Added :func:`set_top_left_cell` worksheet method to position the
    first visible cell in a worksheet.

- changes from version 3.0.1:
  * Add python_requires version to setup.py to help pip find the
    correct matching version for Python 2 and 3.

- changes from version 3.0.0:
  * This is the first Python 3 only version of XlsxWriter. It is
    approximately 10-15% faster than the Python2/3 version.  Python 2
    users should use XlsxWriter version 2.0.0, see below.

- changes from version 2.0.0:
  * This is the last XlsxWriter release to support Python 2. From now
    bug fixes and new features will only be available for Python
    3. The deprecation notice for Python 2 support in XlsxWriter has
    been in place since May 2020 and the Python community support for
    Python 2 ended in January 2020. Downloads of XlsxWriter for Python
    2 is currently less than 6% of all downloads of the library, and
    decreasing month by month.  Python 2 users should still be able to
    install versions of XlsxWriter up to this release but not any
    releases afterwards.

- changes from version 1.4.5:
  * Added Description/Alt Text and Decorative accessibility options
    for charts, textboxes and buttons. These options were already
    available for images.

  * Added some performance improvements. Performance for larger files
    should be 5-10% better.

    Excel "future" functions in Formulas. See :ref:`formula_future`,
    and the :func:`Workbook` constructor.

- changes from version 1.4.0:
  * Added fix for issue for where a y_axis font rotation of 0 was
    ignored.

- changes from version 1.3.9 :
  * Added option to set row heights and column widths in pixels via
    the :func:`set_row_pixels` and :func:`set_column_pixels` methods.

- changes from version 1.3.8 :
  * Added ability to add accessibility options "description" and
    "decorative" to images via :func:`insert_image`. :feature:`768`.
  * Added fix for datetime.timedelta values that exceed the Excel 1900
    leap day (timedeltas greater than 59 days, in hours). This is a
    backward incompatible change. :issue:`731`.
  * Added the worksheet :func:`read_only_recommended` method to set
    the Excel "Read-only Recommended" option that is available when
    saving a file.  :feature:`784`.
  * Fixed issue where temp files used in `constant_memory` mode
    weren't closed/deleted if the workbook object was garbage
    collected. :issue:`764`.
  * Fixed issue where pattern formats without colors were given a
    default black fill color. :issue:`790`.
  * Added option to set a chart crossing to 'min' as well as the
    existing 'max' option. The 'min' option isn't available in the
    Excel interface but can be enabled via VBA. :feature:`773`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 11:06:16 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.7
  * Added support for chart custom data labels
  * Added Border, Fill, Pattern and Gradient formatting to chart data labels and
    chart custom data labels.
  * Replaced internal MD5 digest used to check for duplicate images with a SHA256
    digest to avoid issues on operating systems such as Red Hat in FIPS mode
    which don't support MD5 for security reasons.
  * Added check, and warning, for worksheet tables with no data row.
    Either with or without a header row.
  * Added text alignment for textboxes. The existing options allowed the text
    area to be aligned but didn't offer control over the text within that area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 24 16:57:30 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to Release 1.2.9

    Issue `#686 <https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter/issues/686>`_.
  * Removed ``ReservedWorksheetName`` exception which was used with the reserved
    worksheet name "History" since this name is allowed in some Excel variants.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 15:38:43 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.2.7
  * Fix for duplicate images being copied to an XlsxWriter file. Excel uses an
    optimization where it only stores one copy of a repeated/duplicate image in
    a workbook. XlsxWriter didn't do this which meant that the file size would
    increase when then was a large number of repeated images. This release fixes
    that issue and replicates Excel's behavior.
  * Added documentation on :ref:`num_format_categories` and
    :ref:`num_format_locale`.
  * Added note to :func:`protect()` about how it is possible to encrypt an
    XlsxWriter file using a third party, cross platform, open source tool called
    `msoffice-crypt <https://github.com/herumi/msoffice>`_.
- Update to version 1.2.6
  * Added option to remove style from worksheet tables.
- Update to version 1.2.5

  * Added option to link textbox text from a cell. See :ref:`textbox_textlink`.
  * Added option to rotate text in a textbox. See
    :ref:`textbox_formatting_rotation`.
- Update to version 1.2.3
  * Increased allowable worksheet url length from 255 to 2079 characters, as
    supported in more recent versions of Excel. A lower or user defined limit
    can be set via the ``max_url_length`` property in the :func:`Workbook`
    constructor.
  * Fixed several issues with hyperlinks in worksheet images.
- Update to version 1.2.2
  * Fixed Python 3.8.0 warnings.
- Update to version 1.2.1
  * Added the :func:`add_write_handler` method to allow user defined types to be
    handled by the :func:`write` method. See :ref:`writing_user_types` for more
    information.
  * Add support for East Asian vertical fonts in charts.
- Update to version 1.2.0
  * Refactored exception handling around the workbook file :func:`close()`
    method to allow exceptions to be caught and handled. See
    :ref:`ex_check_close`. Also refactored the code to clean up temp files in
    the event of an exception.
  * Added the option to allow chart fonts to be rotated to 270 degrees
    to give a stacked orientation. See :ref:`chart_fonts`.
- Update to version 1.1.9
  * Another fix for issues where zipfile.py raises "ZIP does not support
    timestamps before 1980" exception.

  * Added gauge chart example which is a combination of a Doughnut and a Pie
    chart.
- Update to Release 1.1.7
  * Added docs on object_position.
  * Added fix for sizing of cell comment boxes when they cross columns/rows that
    have size changes that occur after the comment is written.
  * Added fix for the sizing of worksheet objects (images, charts, textboxes)
    when the underlying cell sizes have changed and the "object_position"
    parameter has been set to 1 "Move and size with cells". An additional mode 4
    has been added to simulate inserting the object in hidden rows.
    * Added object positioning for charts and textboxes, it was already supported
    for images. Note, the parameter is now called ``object_position``. The
    previous parameter name ``positioning`` is deprecated but still supported
    for images.
- Update to Release 1.1.6
  * Fixed issue where images that started in hidden rows/columns weren't placed
    correctly in the worksheet.
  * Fixed the mime-type reported by system ``file(1)``. The mime-type reported
    by "file --mime-type"/magic was incorrect for XlsxWriter files since it
    expected the ``[Content_types]`` to be the first file in the zip container.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Added named exceptions to XlsxWriter. See :ref:`exceptions`.
  * Removed the implicit :func:`close()` in the destructor since it wasn't
    guaranteed to work correctly and raised a confusing exception when any other

    automatically, see :func:`close()`.
