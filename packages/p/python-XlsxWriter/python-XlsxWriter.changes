Thu Jan 30 15:38:43 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.2.7
  * Fix for duplicate images being copied to an XlsxWriter file. Excel uses an
    optimization where it only stores one copy of a repeated/duplicate image in
    a workbook. XlsxWriter didn't do this which meant that the file size would
    increase when then was a large number of repeated images. This release fixes
    that issue and replicates Excel's behavior.
  * Added documentation on :ref:`num_format_categories` and
    :ref:`num_format_locale`.
  * Added note to :func:`protect()` about how it is possible to encrypt an
    XlsxWriter file using a third party, cross platform, open source tool called
    `msoffice-crypt <https://github.com/herumi/msoffice>`_.
- Update to version 1.2.6
  * Added option to remove style from worksheet tables.
- Update to version 1.2.5
  * Added option to add hyperlinks to textboxes. See :ref:`textbox_hyperlink`.
- Update to version 1.2.4
  * Added option to link textbox text from a cell. See :ref:`textbox_textlink`.
  * Added option to rotate text in a textbox. See
    :ref:`textbox_formatting_rotation`.
- Update to version 1.2.3
  * Increased allowable worksheet url length from 255 to 2079 characters, as
    supported in more recent versions of Excel. A lower or user defined limit
    can be set via the ``max_url_length`` property in the :func:`Workbook`
    constructor.
  * Fixed several issues with hyperlinks in worksheet images.
- Update to version 1.2.2
  * Fixed Python 3.8.0 warnings.
- Update to version 1.2.1
  * Added the :func:`add_write_handler` method to allow user defined types to be
    handled by the :func:`write` method. See :ref:`writing_user_types` for more
    information.
  * Add support for East Asian vertical fonts in charts.
- Update to version 1.2.0
  * Refactored exception handling around the workbook file :func:`close()`
    method to allow exceptions to be caught and handled. See
    :ref:`ex_check_close`. Also refactored the code to clean up temp files in
    the event of an exception.
  * Added the option to allow chart fonts to be rotated to 270 degrees
    to give a stacked orientation. See :ref:`chart_fonts`.
- Update to version 1.1.9
  * Another fix for issues where zipfile.py raises "ZIP does not support
    timestamps before 1980" exception.

- Use %pytest, as setup.py test invokes python which does not exist
  if only python3 flavour is built.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 22 16:16:15 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to Release 1.1.8
  * Added ability to combine Doughnut and Pie charts.
  * Added gauge chart example which is a combination of a Doughnut and a Pie
    chart.
- Update to Release 1.1.7
  * Added docs on object_position.
  * Added fix for sizing of cell comment boxes when they cross columns/rows that
    have size changes that occur after the comment is written.
  * Added fix for the sizing of worksheet objects (images, charts, textboxes)
    when the underlying cell sizes have changed and the "object_position"
    parameter has been set to 1 "Move and size with cells". An additional mode 4
    has been added to simulate inserting the object in hidden rows.
    * Added object positioning for charts and textboxes, it was already supported
    for images. Note, the parameter is now called ``object_position``. The
    previous parameter name ``positioning`` is deprecated but still supported
    for images.
- Update to Release 1.1.6
  * Fixed issue where images that started in hidden rows/columns weren't placed
    correctly in the worksheet.
  * Fixed the mime-type reported by system ``file(1)``. The mime-type reported
    by "file --mime-type"/magic was incorrect for XlsxWriter files since it
    expected the ``[Content_types]`` to be the first file in the zip container.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 1.0.8
  * Added named exceptions to XlsxWriter. See :ref:`exceptions`.
  * Removed the implicit :func:`close()` in the destructor since it wasn't
    guaranteed to work correctly and raised a confusing exception when any other

    change.** The ``with`` context manager is a better way to close
    automatically, see :func:`close()`.

- Update to version 1.0.4
  * Set the xlsx internal file member datetimes to 1980-01-01 00:00:00 like

    :func:`set_properties` ``created`` date is set.
