      - Fix deref when using the stupid and utterly unnecessary Readonly::Clone

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.04 2016-05-07T15:38:37Z
      - Quiet compile time warnings about function prototypes and vars being
        used only once
  
  2.03 2016-05-06T22:27:44Z

  	- No longer require an explicit version of perl in META.json or cpanfile
  
  2.02 2016-05-06T21:56:10Z
  	- Create mutable clones of readonly structures with Readonly::Clone
  		- Still not convinced this is useful but... fixes #13

  2.01 2016-02-24T16:01:12Z
      - Disallow initialization of Readonly variables by assignment
        allowed by Perl prototype changes in v5.16.  Assignment initialization
        of scalars sets scalar variables to undef and lists and hashes
        initialized by assignment are not read only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 17 14:55:28 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.00
     - Deprecation of Readonly::XS as a requirement for fast, readonly
       scalars is complete. Report any lingering issues on the tracker
       ASAP.
 
 1.61 2014-06-28T11:22:13Z
     - Normal constants (strings, numbers) do not appear to be read only to
       Internals::SvREADONLY($) but perl itself doesn't miss a beat when you
       attempt to assign a value to them. Fixing test regression in
       t/general/reassign.t
 
 1.60 2014-06-27T15:59:27Z
     - Fix array and hash tie() while in XS mode (exposed by Params::Validate tests)
     - Fix implicit undef value regression resolves #8
     - Minor documentation fixes (spell check, etc.)
     - Patch from Gregor Herrmann <gregoa@debian.org> resolves #7
 
 v1.500.0 2014-06-25T19:56:18Z
     - PLEASE NOTE: Readonly::XS is no longer needed!
     - Again, Readonly::XS is no longer needed.
     - Merged typo fix from David Steinbrunner RT#86350/#2
     - Merged patch (w/ tests, yay!) from Daniel P. Risse RT#37864
     - Upstream magic related bugs were reported to p5p and fixed in perl
       itself so we can resolve the following local issues: RT#70167, RT#57382,
       RT#29487, RT#36653, RT#24216.
     - Reported RT#120122 (tie + smartmatch bug) upstream to p5p. Will
       eventually resolve local [RT#59256].
     - Note: Resolved RT#16167 (benchmark.pl being installed) in 1.04.
     - Use readonly support exposed in Internals on perl >=5.8.x
     - Have I mentioned you don't need to install Readonly::XS anymore?
     - Checking $Readonly::XSokay is no longer suggested. ...never should have been

- eliminate attempt to remove the benchmark test. The new install process
  no longer installs the benchmark test into the target tree, thus the
  removal of the file to hide it from the package is obsolete.
  + Fixes the build failure on all distros
