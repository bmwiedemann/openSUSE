- Update to version 1.3.4
  + Added
    * C# and F# Jupyter notebooks are now supported 
  + Fixed
    * `jupytext --to script *.ipynb` now computes the script extension for each notebook 
    * Fix shebang handling for languages with non-# comments, by Jonas Bushart
    * Indented bash commands are now commented out
    * The main formats are documented in `jupytext --help`
- Update to version 1.3.3
  + Added
    * Jupytext has a logo! Many thanks to Kyle Kelley for contributing the actual logo, and to Chris Holdgraf for suggesting this.
    * Nested metadata filtering is now supported! You can use this to rid of `jupytext_version` if you wish.
  + Fixed
    * Code cells in the Markdown format can contain triple backticks inside multiline strings.
    * Changes in the YAML header when running `jupytext --test` on text files are ignored.
- Update to version 1.3.2
  + Fixed
    * The `--pre-commit` mode now ignores non-notebook files in the index.
    * `nbformat_minor` is taken from the notebook with outputs When inputs and outputs are merged.
- Update to version 1.3.1
  + Added
    * New `nomarker` format in the Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab extensions
  + Changed
    * The `normarker` format replaces the one previously named `bare`.
  + Fixed
    * Multiline strings are now accepted in the YAML header. Fix contributed by ZHUO Qiang.
    * Fixed the instructions on how to use multiline comments for all Markdown cells in the py:percent format, by ZHUO Qiang.
    * Added `cd` to the list of magic commands.
    * Do not read paired files when `--set-formats` is being used.
- Update to version 1.3.0
  + Added
    * Pairing a notebook to both `.md` and `.py` is now supported. Input cells are loaded from the most recent text representation
    * Both the Jupyter Notebook and the Jupyter Lab extension for Jupytext were updated
    * Raw cells are now encoded using HTML comments (`<!-- #raw -->` and `<!-- #endraw -->`) in Markdown files
    * Markdown cells can be delimited with any of `<!-- #region -->`,  `<!-- #markdown -->` or `<!-- #md -->`
    * Code blocks from Markdown files, when they don't have an explicit language, appear in Markdown cells in Jupyter
    * Code blocks with an explicit language and a `.noeval` attribute are inactive in Jupyter
    * Markdown and raw cells can be quoted with triple quotes in the `py:percent` format. And Markdown cells can start with just `# %% [md]`
    * The light format uses `# + [markdown]` rather than the previous `cell_type` metadata to identify markdown cells with metadata
    * Explicit Markdown cells in the light format `# + [markdown]` can use triple quotes
    * IPython magic help commands like `float?` are classified as magics, and thus commented in Python scripts
    * Cell metadata can be encoded as either `key=value` (the new default) or in JSON. An automatic option `cell_metadata_json` should help minimize the impact on existing files
    * R Markdown hidden inputs, outputs, or cells are now mapped to the corresponding Jupyter Book tags by default
    * The notebook metadata filter is automatically updated when extra keys are added to the YAML header
    * The Jupyter Notebook extension for Jupytext is compatible with Jupyter Notebook 6.0
    * `jupytext notebook.py --to ipynb` updates the timestamp of `notebook.py` so that the paired notebook still works in Jupyter
    * `jupytext --check pytest notebook.ipynb` can be used to run test functions in a notebook
    * `jupytext --check` and `jupytext --pipe` can run commands that only operate on files: when `{}` is found in the text of the command, `jupytext` saves the text representation of the notebook in a temp file, and replaces `{}` with the name of that file before executing the command.
    * Documented how to sync notebooks in a pre-commit hook
    * Added support for Rust/Evxcr, by Jonas Bushart
    * Added support for [Robot Framework](https://robots-from-jupyter.github.io/), by Asko Soukka
    * Added support for PowerShell
  + Changed
    * Use `CHANGELOG.md` rather than `HISTORY.rst`
  + Fixed
    * Commands like `cat = x` are not magic commands, so they are not commented any more
    * Fixed an inconsistent round trip (code cell with `"cat"` being converted to a markdown cell) in the `py:light` format
    * `jupytext --test textfile.ext` now really compares the text file to its round trip (rather than the corresponding notebook)
    * Markdown cells that contain code are now preserved in a round trip through the Markdown and R Markdown formats
    * Code cells with a `%%python3` cell magic are now preserved in a round trip through the Markdown format
    * `jupytext --execute` runs the notebook in its folder
    * Strings in the metadata of code cells are quoted in the Rmd representation. And we escape R code in chunk options with `#R_CODE#`

  + Improvements
    * Added documentation on how to use Jupytext with JupyterLab 0.35
    * and on using Jupytext with the pre-commit package manager
    * The `read` and `write` functions are easier to use
  + BugFixes
    * Jupytext now ships the ``jupyterlab-jupytext`` extension in version 1.0.2. The version 1.0.1 erroneously introduces a `target_formats` metadata in the jupytext section, instead of `formats`, and works only after two clicks.

  + Improvements
    * New ``--execute`` option in Jupytext CLI
    * The ``--set-formats`` option in Jupytext CLI also triggers ``--sync``, allowing shorter commands.

    * ``jupytext --sync`` will now skip unpaired notebooks.
    * The JupyterLab extension was updated. It now works on on text filesand has a new option to include
      (or not) the metadata in the text representation of the notebook.

      ``jupyter_server``

  + BugFixes
    * The ``jupyterlab-jupytext`` extension shipped with the python package is in version 1.0.1, and is compatible only
      with JupyterLab >= 1.0. If you use an earlier version of JupyterLab, please install the version 0.19 of the extension
