  <title>Python module to allow customization of the process title</title>
  <description>Changing the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for example when
a master process is forked: changing the children's title allows to identify
the task each process is busy with. The technique is used by PostgreSQL  and
the OpenSSH Server for example.</description>
