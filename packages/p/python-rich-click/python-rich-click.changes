- update to 1.7.2:
  * Add support for rich formatting in epilog text [#146]
  * Fix bug with `rich-click` CLI not working with Python 3.12.
    #141
  * Fix compatibility issue with `dbt-core` CLI. [#140]
  * Extends Click's `HelpFormatter` class
  * Creates a `HelpConfiguration` class that doubles the current
    module-level settings
  * Added a decorator that allows the `HelpConfiguration` to be
    passed into Click via the supported `context_settings`
    argument provided by the `Command` and `Group` classes.
  * The Rich Console object can also be configured per command
    and is distinct from the Console instance used internally by
    the formatter. The `RichHelpFormatter` creates a console
    based on the `RichHelpConfiguration` as the tight coupling
    between the Formatter and Click's internals make it difficult
    to allow the Console to be configured externally (i.e. one
    example is that Click expects help formatting to be
    buffered).
  * Created a `RichContext` class to allow creation of the custom
    formatter.
  * The Rich Command, Group, and Context now expose the `Console`
    and `RichHelpConfiguration` properties.
  * Added contributor VSCode settings
