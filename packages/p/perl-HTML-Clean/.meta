  <title>Cleans up HTML code for web browsers, not humans</title>
  <description>The majority of the web pages of the internet today are much larger
than they need to be.  The reason for this is that HTML tends to be
stored in a human readable format, with indenting, newlines and
comments.

However, all of these comments, whitespace etc. are ignored by the
browser, and needlessly lengthen download times.

Second, many people are using WYSIWYG HTML editors these days. This
makes creating content easy.  However these editors can cause a number
of compatibility problems by tying themselves to a particular browser
or operating system.</description>
