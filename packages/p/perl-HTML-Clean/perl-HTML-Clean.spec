%description
The HTML::Clean module encapsulates a number of common techniques for
minimizing the size of HTML files. You can typically save between 10% and
50% of the size of a HTML file using these methods. It provides the
following features:

* Remove unneeded whitespace (beginning of line, etc)

* Remove unneeded META elements.

* Remove HTML comments (except for styles, javascript and SSI)

* Replace tags with equivalent shorter tags (<strong> --> <b>)

* etc.

The entire process is configurable, so you can pick and choose what you want
to clean.
