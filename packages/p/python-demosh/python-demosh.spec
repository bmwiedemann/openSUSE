%description
tl;dr: demosh can run shell scripts or Markdown files in a very interactive
way, showing commentary in between running commands, and waiting for you to hit
RETURN to proceed before running commands. It was created as a tool for doing
live demos of relatively complex things. See testing.md and testing.sh for
examples.
