%description
This Python package provides high level utilities to read/write a
variety of Python types to/from HDF5 (Heirarchal Data Format) formatted
files. This package also provides support for MATLAB MAT v7.3 formatted
files, which are just HDF5 files with a different extension and some
extra meta-data.
