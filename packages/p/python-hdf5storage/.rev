    <comment>- Update 0.1.18 (performance improving release):
  - Pull Request #111 from Daniel Hrisca. Many repeated calls to
    the __getitem__ methods of objects were turned into single
    calls.
  - Further reducionts in __getitem__ calls in the spirit of PR
    #111.
- Update to 0.1.17 (bugfix and deprecation workaround release):
  - Issue #109. Fixed the fix Issue #102 for 32-bit platforms
    (previous fix was segfaulting).
  - Moved to using pkg_resources.parse_version from setuptools
    with distutils.version classes as a fallback instead of just
    the later to prepare for the removal of distutils (PEP 632)
    and prevent warnings on Python versions where it is marked as
    deprecated.
  - Issue #110. Changed all uses of the tostring method on numpy
    types to using tobytes if available, with tostring as the
    fallback for old versions of numpy where it is not.
- Add nose-to-pytest.patch which allows use of pytest instead of
  nose (not based on the upstream solution).
