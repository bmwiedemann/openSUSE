- Update to 1.6: 
  ***IMPORTANT NOTE*** This is the last release on pypi.  Curio
     will no longer be making package releases.  The most recent
     version can be obtained at https://github.com/dabeaz/curio.

     Fixed a problem with cancellation and waiting in UniversalEvent.
     Reported by vytasrgl.
	   
     Merged a fix for #350 where UniversalEvents couldn't be set
     more than once.   Reported and fixed by Stephen Harding.
	   
     Fixed Issue #340 related to the handling of daemonic tasks
     in a TaskGroup.   TaskGroups can now be given existing
     daemonic tasks in the constructor.  Daemonic tasks are
     correctly cancelled if a TaskGroup used as a context manager
     terminates due to an exception.
           
    Changed all cancellation related exceptions to inherit
    from BaseException instead of Exception.   This makes
    them play slightly better with normal exception handling
    code:

               try:
                   await some_operation()
               except Exception as err:
                   # Normal (expected) program related error
                   ...
               except CancelledError as err:
                   # Cancellation of some kind
                   ...

    This also mirrors a similar change to asyncio.CancelledError
    which now directly inherits from BaseException.
    ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
    If you were using try: ... except Exception: to catch
    cancellation, that code will break. 
           
    Added ps() and where() commands to the monitor
    that can be used from the Curio REPL when you run
    `python -m curio`.  These can also be used to monitor
    the state of the kernel from a different thread.
    For example:
    from threading import Thread
               
       kern = Kernel()
       Thread(target=kern.run, args=[main]).start()

        >>> from curio.monitor import ps
        >>> ps(kern)
        ... displays active tasks ...

    This makes it a bit easier to have some of the monitor
    capability in an live-environment where Curio is running.

- Reenable python36 build and skip the failing tests. The 
  dependency tree on curio is too large to just define
  skip_python36

  * gh#openSUSE/python-rpm-macros#66

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  3 21:47:14 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Although upstream reduced their requirement to python >= 3.6,
  we keep python >= 3.7 and skip the upcoming python36 flavor,
  because the unittests fail.
