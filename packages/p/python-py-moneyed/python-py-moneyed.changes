- Update to 2.0:
  * Dropped support for Python 2.7 and 3.5 and PyPy 2.
  * Dropped the moneyed.localization module that was deprecated and
    announced for removal in 1.0.
  * Added type hints along with a mypy pre-commit hook.
  * Removed undocumented DEFAULT_CURRENCY and DEFAULT_CURRENCY_CODE
    constants, and change to make instantiating Money without providing a
    currency a type error. This used to result in an object with a made-up
    "XYZ" currency, which could lead to surprising behaviors and bugs.
  * Added zero property to Currency to conveniently access the zero value
    of a given currency.
  * Moved to use setuptool's declarative packaging config and PEP 517
    isolated builds.
  * Removed requirements files and instead specified test requirements
    using extras.
- Switch to using the GitHub release URL.
