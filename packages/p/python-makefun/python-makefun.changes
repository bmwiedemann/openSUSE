  as specified by PEP 362. PR by #86 by lucaswiman.

- version update to 1.12.1
  ### 1.12.1 - Bugfix
   - Fixed `TypeError` when a `func` attribute is present on the function provided to `create_function`. Fixed [#76]
  ### 1.12.0 - Refactoring and consistency improvement
   - Fixed `partial` so that :
     - when no argument is provided, it is equivalent to `wraps(f)(f)`. That is, the `__wrapped__` attribute is set. Fixed [#73]
     - it sets the `func` attribute just as `functools.partial` does. Fixed [#75]
   - Removed `pytest-cases` dependency as it was a circular one. Fixed [#68]
   - Now using `flake8` for qualimetry and `genbadge` for badges. Fixed [#71]
   - Restructured project so that tests are truly independent, to ease rpm/apt/etc. packaging. Fixed [#69]
- test the package
