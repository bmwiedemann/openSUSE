  <title>SASL Authentication framework</title>
  <description>SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation framework that all
protocols should be able to share.

The framework allows different implementations of the connection class
to be plugged in. At the time of writing there were two such plugins.</description>
