%description
netCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of
the library and is implemented on  top of HDF5. This module can read
and write files in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3
format, and can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients. The
API modelled after Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to
users of that module.

Most new features of netCDF 4 are implemented, such as multiple unlimited
dimensions, groups and zlib data compression. All the new numeric data types
(such as 64 bit and unsigned integer types) are implemented. Compound and
variable length (vlen) data types are supported, but the enum and opaque data
types are not. Mixtures of compound and vlen data types (compound types
containing vlens, and vlens containing compound types) are not supported.
