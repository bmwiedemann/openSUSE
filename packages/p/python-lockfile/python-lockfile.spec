%description
The lockfile package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple API for
locking files.  Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the fcntl.lockf
and flock functions, and the deprecated posixfile module, the API is
identical across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and Windows platforms.
The lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the link (on Unix) and
mkdir (on Windows) system calls.  An implementation based on SQLite is also
provided, more as a demonstration of the possibilities it provides than as
production-quality code.
