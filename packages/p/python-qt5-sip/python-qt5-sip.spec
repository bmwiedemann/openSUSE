%description
The sip extension module provides support for the PyQt5 package.

SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for 
C and C++ libraries. It was originally developed to create PyQt, 
the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create 
bindings for any C or C++ library. For example, it is also used to 
create wxPython, the Python bindings for the wxWidget toolkit.
