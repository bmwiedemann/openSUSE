%description devel
The Polyhedral Library (PolyLib) operates on objects made up of
unions of polyhedra of any dimension.

It can manipulate non-parameterized unions of polyhedra
(intersection, difference, union, convex hull, simplify, image and
preimage, plus some input and output functions), parameterized
vertices computation, and Ehrhart polynomials computation.

This subpackage contains the include files and library links for
developing with PolyLib.
