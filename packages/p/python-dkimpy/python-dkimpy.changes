- update to 1.0.3
  * dknewkey: On posix operating systems set file permissions to 600 for
    ed25519 private key files (as is already done for RSA) (LP: #1857827)
  * Set minimum dnspython version to 1.16 because previous versions can not
    support the timeout parameter (LP: #1856546)
  * Follow CNAMES when looking up key records when using DNS (pydns)
  * Add support for RFC 8460 tlsrpt DKIM signature processing (LP: #1847020)
  * Add async support with aiodns for DKIM verification (ARC not supported)
  * Add new timeout parameter to enable DNS lookup timeouts to be adjusted
  * Add new DKIM.present function to allow applications to test if a DKIM
    signature is present without doing validation (LP: #1851141)
  * Support signature verification with RSAPublicKey formatted keys
    since, although rare, they are RFC 6376 specified (LP: #1851862)
  * Drop usage of pymilter Milter.dns in dnsplug since it doesn't support
    having a timeout passed to it
  * Catch binascii related key format errors (LP: #1854477)
  * Ignore unknown service types in key records (LP: #1847020)
  * Add LICENSE to MANIFEST.in so it is included in the tarball
