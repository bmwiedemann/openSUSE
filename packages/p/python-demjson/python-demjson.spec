%description
This module provides classes and functions for encoding or decoding data
represented in the language-neutral JSON format (which is often used as a
simpler substitute for XML in Ajax web applications).  This implementation tries
to be as compliant to the JSON specification (RFC 4627) as possible, while
still providing many optional extensions to allow less restrictive JavaScript
syntax.  It includes complete Unicode support, including UTF-32, BOM, and
surrogate pair processing.  It can also support JavaScript's
NaN and Infinity numeric types as well as it's 'undefined' type.
It also includes a lint-like JSON syntax validator which tests JSON text
for strict compliance to the standard.
