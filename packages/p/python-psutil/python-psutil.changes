  the 15.4_py39 target in devel:languages:python:backports.
- Merge skip-obs.patch into skip_failing_tests.patch and add
  test_linux.py::test_cpu_affinity because it depends on the

      ENOMEM. Dynamically increase the "malloc()" buffer size until
      it's big enough.
    + 2095_, [Linux]: `net_if_stats()`_ returns incorrect interface
      speed for 100GbE network cards.
    + 2113_, [FreeBSD], **[critical]**: `virtual_memory()`_ may raise

    - 2107, [Linux]: Process.memory_full_info() (reporting process USS/PSS/Swap memory)
      now reads /proc/pid/smaps_rollup instead of /proc/pids/smaps, which makes it 5 times faster.
  * Bug fixes
    - 2048: AttributeError is raised if psutil.Error class is raised manually and passed through str.
    - 2049, [Linux]: cpu_freq() erroneously returns curr value in GHz while min and max are in MHz.

Mon Jan 10 22:51:40 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.9.0:
  * [Linux]: `cpu_freq()`_ is slow on systems with many CPUs. Read current
    frequency values for all CPUs from ``/proc/cpuinfo`` instead of opening many
    files in ``/sys`` fs.  (patch by marxin)
  * `NoSuchProcess`_ message now specifies if the PID has been reused.
  * error classes (`NoSuchProcess`_, `AccessDenied`_, etc.) now have a better
    formatted and separated ``__repr__`` and ``__str__`` implementations.
  * [Linux]: `disk_partitions()`_: convert ``/dev/root`` device (an alias
    used on some Linux distros) to real root device path.
  * ``PSUTIL_DEBUG`` mode now prints file name and line number of the debug
    messages coming from C extension modules.
  * rewrite HISTORY.rst to use hyperlinks pointing to psutil API doc.
  * [Linux]: `wait_procs()`_ should catch ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired``
  exception.
  * [Linux]: `sensors_battery()`_ can raise ``TypeError`` on PureOS.
  * [Linux]: psutil does not handle ``ENAMETOOLONG`` when accessing process
  file descriptors in procfs.  (patch by Nikita Radchenko)
  * **[critical]**: ``memoize_when_activated`` decorator is not thread-safe.
  * **[critical]**: `process_iter()`_ is not thread safe and can raise
  ``TypeError`` if invoked from multiple threads.
  * [Linux]: `cpu_freq()`_ return order is wrong on systems with more than
  9 CPUs.

  * Enhancements
    + 1379: [Windows] Process suspend() and resume() now use
      NtSuspendProcess and NtResumeProcess instead of
      stopping/resuming all threads of a process. This is faster and
      more reliable (aka this is what ProcessHacker does).
    + 1420: [Windows] in case of exception disk_usage() now also shows
      the path name.
    + 1422: [Windows] Windows APIs requiring to be dynamically loaded
      from DLL libraries are now loaded only once on startup (instead
      of on per function call) significantly speeding up different

      raise OSError on failed malloc().
    + 1429: [Windows] SE DEBUG was not properly set for current

      miscalculated because we're not using the actual system
      PAGESIZE.
    + 1439: [NetBSD] Process.connections() may return incomplete
      results if using oneshot().
    + 1447: original exception wasn't turned into NSP/AD exceptions
      when using Process.oneshot() ctx manager.
  * Incompatible API changes
    + 1291: [OSX] Process.memory_maps() was removed because inherently

    + 1373: incorrect handling of cache in Process.oneshot() context
      causes Process instances to return incorrect results.
    + 1376: [Windows] OpenProcess() now uses
      PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION access rights wherever
      possible, resulting in less AccessDenied exceptions being thrown
      for system processes.
    + 1376: [Windows] check if variable is NULL before free()ing

- update to version 5.3.0

**Enhancements**
- 802_: disk_io_counters() and net_io_counters() numbers no longer wrap
  (restart from 0). Introduced a new "nowrap" argument.
- 928_: psutil.net_connections() and psutil.Process.connections() "laddr" and
  "raddr" are now named tuples.
- 1015_: swap_memory() now relies on /proc/meminfo instead of sysinfo() syscall
  so that it can be used in conjunction with PROCFS_PATH in order to retrieve
  memory info about Linux containers such as Docker and Heroku.
- 1022_: psutil.users() provides a new "pid" field.
- 1025_: process_iter() accepts two new parameters in order to invoke
  Process.as_dict(): "attrs" and "ad_value". With this you can iterate over all
  processes in one shot without needing to catch NoSuchProcess and do list/dict
  comprehensions.
- 1040_: implemented full unicode support.
- 1051_: disk_usage() on Python 3 is now able to accept bytes.
- 1058_: test suite now enables all warnings by default.

**Bug fixes**
- 989_: [Windows] boot_time() may return a negative value.

  value of the first call is now cached so that boot_time() always returns the
  same value if fluctuation is <= 1 second.
- 1013_: [FreeBSD] psutil.net_connections() may return incorrect PID.  (patch
  by Gleb Smirnoff)
- 1014_: [Linux] Process class can mask legitimate ENOENT exceptions as
  NoSuchProcess.
- 1016_: disk_io_counters() raises RuntimeError on a system with no disks.
- 1017_: net_io_counters() raises RuntimeError on a system with no network
  cards installed.
- 1021_: [Linux] open_files() may erroneously raise NoSuchProcess instead of
  skipping a file which gets deleted while open files are retrieved.
- 1029_: [OSX, FreeBSD] Process.connections('unix') on Python 3 doesn't
  properly handle unicode paths and may raise UnicodeDecodeError.
- 1033_: [OSX, FreeBSD] memory leak for net_connections() and
  Process.connections() when retrieving UNIX sockets (kind='unix').
- 1040_: fixed many unicode related issues such as UnicodeDecodeError on
  Python 3 + UNIX and invalid encoded data on Windows.
- 1042_: [FreeBSD] psutil won't compile on FreeBSD 12.
- 1044_: [OSX] different Process methods incorrectly raise AccessDenied for
  zombie processes.

- 1048_: [Windows] users()'s host field report an invalid IP address.
- 1050_: [Windows] Process.memory_maps memory() leaks memory.
- 1055_: cpu_count() is no longer cached; this is useful on systems such as
  Linux where CPUs can be disabled at runtime. This also reflects on
  Process.cpu_percent() which no longer uses the cache.
- 1058_: fixed Python warnings.
- 1062_: disk_io_counters() and net_io_counters() raise TypeError if no disks
  or NICs are installed on the system.
- 1063_: [NetBSD] net_connections() may list incorrect sockets.
- 1064_: [NetBSD] swap_memory() may segfault in case of error.
- 1065_: [OpenBSD] Process.cmdline() may raise SystemError.
- 1067_: [NetBSD] Process.cmdline() leaks memory if process has terminated.
- 1069_: [FreeBSD] Process.cpu_num() may return 255 for certain kernel
  processes.
- 1071_: [Linux] cpu_freq() may raise IOError on old RedHat distros.
- 1074_: [FreeBSD] sensors_battery() raises OSError in case of no battery.

- 1077_: [SunOS] net_connections() does not work on SunOS 5.10. (patch by
  Oleksii Shevchuk)
- 1079_: [FreeBSD] net_connections() didn't list locally connected sockets.
  (patch by Gleb Smirnoff)
- 1085_: cpu_count() return value is now checked and forced to None if <= 1.
- 1087_: Process.cpu_percent() guard against cpu_count() returning None and
  assumes 1 instead.
- 1093_: [SunOS] memory_maps() shows wrong 64 bit addresses.
- 1094_: [Windows] psutil.pid_exists() may lie. Also, all process APIs relying
  on OpenProcess Windows API now check whether the PID is actually running.
- 1098_: [Windows] Process.wait() may erroneously return sooner, when the PID
  is still alive.
- 1099_: [Windows] Process.terminate() may raise AccessDenied even if the
  process already died.
- 1101_: [Linux] sensors_temperatures() may raise ENODEV.

**Porting notes**

- 1039_: returned types consolidation:
  - Windows / Process.cpu_times(): fields #3 and #4 were int instead of float
  - Linux / FreeBSD: connections('unix'): raddr is now set to "" instead of
    None
  - OpenBSD: connections('unix'): laddr and raddr are now set to "" instead of
    None
- 1040_: all strings are encoded by using OS fs encoding.
- 1040_: the following Windows APIs on Python 2 now return a string instead of
  unicode:
  - Process.memory_maps().path
  - WindowsService.bin_path()
  - WindowsService.description()
  - WindowsService.display_name()
  - WindowsService.username()
