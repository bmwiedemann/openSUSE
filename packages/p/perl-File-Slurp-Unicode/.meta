  <title>Reading/Writing of Complete Files with Character Encoding Support</title>
  <description>This module wraps the File::Slurp manpage and adds character encoding
support through the *'encoding'* parameter. It exports the same functions
which take all the same parameters as File::Slurp. Please see the the
File::Slurp manpage documentation for basic usage; only the differences are
described from here on out.
