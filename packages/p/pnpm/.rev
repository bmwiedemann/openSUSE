    ignoreGhsas for ignoring vulnerabilities by their GHSA code #6838.

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- update to version 9.12.0:
  * Fix peer dependency resolution dead lock #8570. This change
    might change some of the keys in the snapshots field inside
    pnpm-lock.yaml but it should happen very rarely.
  * pnpm outdated command supports now a --sort-by=name option
    for sorting outdated dependencies by package name #8523
  * Added the ability for overrides to remove dependencies by
    specifying &quot;-&quot; as the field value #8572
  * Fixed an issue where pnpm list --json pkg showed &quot;private&quot;:
    false for a private package #8519
  * Packages with libc that differ from pnpm.
    supportedArchitectures.libc are not downloaded #7362
  * Prevent ENOENT errors caused by running store prune in parallel #8586
  * Add issues alias to pnpm bugs #8596

    installed peer dependencies #6657
  * pnpm publish should be able to publish from a local tarball #7950

    dlx processes #8604

    <version>9.12.3</version>
    <time>1731182299</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 9.12.3:
  * Don't purge node_modules, when typing &quot;n&quot; in the prompt that
    asks whether to remove node_modules before installation #8655
  * Fix a bug causing pnpm to infinitely spawn itself when manage-
    package-manager-versions=true is set and the .tools directory is corrupt
  * Use crypto.hash, when available, for improved performance #8629
  * Fixed a race condition in temporary file creation in the
    store by including worker thread ID in filename. Previously,
    multiple worker threads could attempt to use the same
    temporary file. Temporary files now include both process ID
    and thread ID for uniqueness #8703
  * All commands should read settings from the package.json at
    the root of the workspace #8667
  * When manage-package-manager-versions is set to true, errors
    spawning a self-managed version of pnpm will now be shown
    (instead of being silent)
  * Pass the find command to npm, it is an alias for npm search
- includes 9.12.2:
  * When checking whether a file in the store has executable
    permissions, the new approach checks if at least one of the
    executable bits (owner, group, and others) is set to 1.
    Previously, a file was incorrectly considered executable only
    when all the executable bits were set to 1. This fix ensures
    that files with any executable permission, regardless of the
    user class, are now correctly identified as executable #8546

    specific version of pnpm.

    is printed while trying to render the missing peer
    dependencies warning message #8538
