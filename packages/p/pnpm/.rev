    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- update to version 9.10.0:
  * Support for a new CLI flag, --exclude-peers, added to the
    list and why commands. When --exclude-peers is used, peer
    dependencies are not printed in the results, but dependencies
    of peer dependencies are still scanned #8506.
  * Added a new setting to package.json at pnpm.auditConfig.
    ignoreGhsas for ignoring vulnerabilities by their GHSA code #6838.
  * Throw an exception if pnpm switches to the same version of itself.
  * Reduce memory usage during peer dependencies resolution.

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- update to version 9.12.0:
  * Fix peer dependency resolution dead lock #8570. This change
    might change some of the keys in the snapshots field inside
    pnpm-lock.yaml but it should happen very rarely.
  * pnpm outdated command supports now a --sort-by=name option
    for sorting outdated dependencies by package name #8523
  * Added the ability for overrides to remove dependencies by
    specifying &quot;-&quot; as the field value #8572
  * Fixed an issue where pnpm list --json pkg showed &quot;private&quot;:
    false for a private package #8519
  * Packages with libc that differ from pnpm.
    supportedArchitectures.libc are not downloaded #7362
  * Prevent ENOENT errors caused by running store prune in parallel #8586
  * Add issues alias to pnpm bugs #8596

    installed peer dependencies #6657
  * pnpm publish should be able to publish from a local tarball #7950
  * Prevent EBUSY errors caused by creating symlinks in parallel
    dlx processes #8604

    <version>9.12.3</version>
    <time>1731182299</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 9.12.3:
  * Don't purge node_modules, when typing &quot;n&quot; in the prompt that
    asks whether to remove node_modules before installation #8655
  * Fix a bug causing pnpm to infinitely spawn itself when manage-
    package-manager-versions=true is set and the .tools directory is corrupt
  * Use crypto.hash, when available, for improved performance #8629
  * Fixed a race condition in temporary file creation in the
    store by including worker thread ID in filename. Previously,
    multiple worker threads could attempt to use the same
    temporary file. Temporary files now include both process ID
    and thread ID for uniqueness #8703
  * All commands should read settings from the package.json at
    the root of the workspace #8667
  * When manage-package-manager-versions is set to true, errors
    spawning a self-managed version of pnpm will now be shown
    (instead of being silent)
  * Pass the find command to npm, it is an alias for npm search
- includes 9.12.2:
  * When checking whether a file in the store has executable
    permissions, the new approach checks if at least one of the
    executable bits (owner, group, and others) is set to 1.
    Previously, a file was incorrectly considered executable only
    when all the executable bits were set to 1. This fix ensures
    that files with any executable permission, regardless of the
    user class, are now correctly identified as executable #8546

  * Convert settings in local .npmrc files to their correct types.
    For instance, child-concurrency should be a number, not a string #5075
  * pnpm should fail if a project requires a different package
    manager even if manage-package-manager-versions is set to true
  * pnpm init should respect the --dir option #8768
- includes 9.14.0:
  * chore: use verify-deps-before-run
  * fix(init): --dir option should be respected (#8768)
  * feat: support json format output in pnpm pack (#8765)
  * fix: pnpm exec should specify command (#8774)
  * fix: proper types of settings in local .npmrc files (#8775)

    <version>10.0.0</version>
    <time>1736677209</time>
    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- update to 10.0.0:
  * Lifecycle scripts of dependencies are not executed during
    installation by default! This is a breaking change aimed at
    increasing security. In order to allow lifecycle scripts of
    specific dependencies, they should be listed in the pnpm
    onlyBuiltDependencies field of package.json #8897
  * The pnpm link command now adds overrides to the root package.json. #8653
  * Secure hashing with SHA256
  * Configuration updates
  * Changes to the global store
  * The # character is now escaped in directory names within
    node_modules/.pnpm. #8557
  * Running pnpm add --global pnpm or pnpm add --global @pnpm/exe
    now fails with an error message, directing you to use pnpm
    self-update instead. #8728
  * Dependencies added via a URL now record the final resolved
    URL in the lockfile, ensuring that any redirects are fully
    captured. #8833
  * The pnpm deploy command now only works in workspaces that
    have inject-workspace-packages=true. This limitation is
    introduced to allow us to create a proper lockfile for the
    deployed project using the workspace lockfile.
  * Removed conversion from lockfile v6 to v9. If you need v6-to-
    v9 conversion, use pnpm CLI v9.
  * pnpm test now passes all parameters after the test keyword
    directly to the underlying script. This matches the behavior
    of pnpm run test. Previously you needed to use the -- prefix. #8619
  * node-gyp updated to version 11.
  * pnpm deploy now tries creating a dedicated lockfile from a
    shared lockfile for deployment. It will fallback to
    deployment without a lockfile if there is no shared lockfile
    or force-legacy-deploy is set to true.
  * Added support for a new type of dependencies called
    &quot;configurational dependencies&quot;. These dependencies are
    installed before all the other types of dependencies (befor
    &quot;dependencies&quot;, &quot;devDependencies&quot;, &quot;optionalDependencies&quot;).
  * New verify-deps-before-run setting. This setting controls how
    pnpm checks node_modules before running scripts #8836
  * On repeated installs, pnpm performs a quick check to ensure
    node_modules is up to date. #8838
  * pnpm add integrates with default workspace catalog: #8640
  * pnpm dlx now resolves packages to their exact versions and
    uses these exact versions for cache keys. This ensures pnpm
    dlx always installs the latest requested packages #8811
  * No node_modules validation on certain commands. Commands that
    should not modify node_modules (e.g., pnpm install --lockfile-
    only) no longer validate or purge node_modules. #8657
  * for full changes, see https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.0.0

    <version>10.1.0</version>
    <time>1738335877</time>
    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- update to 10.1.0:
  * Added a new command for printing the list of dependencies
    with ignored build scripts: pnpm ignored-builds #8963.
  * Added a new command for approving dependencies for running
    scripts during installation: pnpm approve-builds #8963.
  * Added a new setting called optimistic-repeat-install. When
    enabled, a fast check will be performed before proceeding to
    installation. This way a repeat install or an install on a
    project with everything up-to-date becomes a lot faster. But
    some edge cases might arise, so we keep it disabled by
    default for now #8977.
  * Added a new field &quot;pnpm.ignoredBuiltDependencies&quot; for
    explicitly listing packages that should not be built. When a
    package is in the list, pnpm will not print an info message
    about that package not being built #8935.
  * Verify that the package name is valid when executing the
    publish command.
  * When running pnpm install, the preprepare and postprepare
    scripts of the project should be executed #8989.
  * Allow workspace: and catalog: to be part of wider version
    range in peerDependencies.
  * pnpm deploy should inherit the pnpm object from the root
    package.json #8991.
  * Make sure that the deletion of a node_modules in a sub-
    project of a monorepo is detected as out-of-date #8959.
  * Fix infinite loop caused by lifecycle scripts using pnpm to
    execute other scripts during pnpm install with
    verify-deps-before-run=install #8954.
  * Replace strip-ansi with the built-in util.
    stripVTControlCharacters #9009.
  * Do not print patched dependencies as ignored dependencies
    that require a build #8952.
