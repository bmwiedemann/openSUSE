    directory when running dlx #7996
  * Updated @pnpm/tabtab to v0.5.4, enabling zsh autocomplete
    lazy loading #8236

    dependents is set to true #6300

    --use-node-version.

- update to version 9.4.0:
  * Some registries allow the exact same content to be published
    under different package names and/or versions. This breaks
    the validity checks of packages in the store. To avoid errors
    when verifying the names and versions of such packages in the
    store, you may now set the strict-store-pkg-content-check
    setting to false #4724
  * Fix package-manager-strict-version missing in config #8195
  * If install is performed on a subset of workspace projects,
    always create an up-to-date lockfile first. So, a partial
    install can be performed only on a fully resolved (non-partial)
    lockfile #8165
  * Handle workspace protocol with any semver range specifier,
    when used in peer dependencies #7578

- update to version 9.3.0:
  * Semi-breaking. Dependency key names in the lockfile are
    shortened if they are longer than 1000 characters. We don't
    expect this change to affect many users. Affected users most
    probably can't run install successfully at the moment. This
    change is required to fix some edge cases in which installation
    fails with an out-of-memory error or "Invalid string length
    (RangeError: Invalid string length)" error. The max allowed
    length of the dependency key can be controlled with the peers-
    suffix-max-length setting #8177.
  * Set reporter-hide-prefix to true by default for pnpm exec. In
    order to show prefix, the user now has to explicitly set reporter
    -hide-prefix=false #8174.
- changes from 9.2.0:
  * If package-manager-strict-version is set to true, pnpm will
    fail if its version doesn't exactly match the version in the
    "packageManager" field of package.json.
  * Update @yarnpkg/pnp to the latest version, fixing issue with
    node: imports #8161.
  * Deduplicate bin names to prevent race condition and corrupted
    bin scripts #7833.
  * pnpm doesn't fail if its version doesn't match the one
    specified in the "packageManager" field of package.json #8087.
  * exec now also streams prefixed output when --recursive or
    --parallel is specified just as run does #8065.
- changes from 9.1.4:
  * Improved the performance of the resolution stage by changing
    how missing peer dependencies are detected #8144.
- changes from 9.1.3:
  * Fix a bug in which a dependency that is both optional for one 
    package but non-optional for another is omitted when optional=false #8066.
  * Clear resolution cache before starting peer dependencies resolution #8109.
  * Reduce memory usage by peer dependencies resolution #8072.

Sat Apr 27 21:34:30 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.0.6:
  * Lockfiles that have git-hosted dependencies specified should
    be correctly converted to the new lockfile format #7990.
  * Don't upgrade the lockfile format on pnpm install
    --frozen-lockfile #7991.
- includes version 9.0.5:
  * Lockfiles with local or git-hosted dependencies are now
    successfully converted to the new lockfile format #7955.
  * Resolve peer dependencies correctly, when they have
    prerelease versions #7977.
  * Fix aliased dependencies resolution on repeat install with
    existing lockfile, when the aliased dependency doesn't
    specify a version or range #7957.
  * The lockfile should be saved in the new format even if it is
    up-to-date.
