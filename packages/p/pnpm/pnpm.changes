Sat Nov 16 19:08:45 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.13.2:
  * Detection of circular peer dependencies should not crash with
    aliased dependencies #8759. Fixes a regression introduced in
    the previous version.
  * Fix race condition of symlink creations caused by multiple
    parallel dlx processes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 14 19:00:27 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.13.1:
  * Fixed some edge cases where resolving circular peer
    dependencies caused a dead lock #8720

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 13 22:13:33 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.13.0:
  * The self-update now accepts a version specifier to install a
    specific version of pnpm.
  * Fix Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') that
    is printed while trying to render the missing peer
    dependencies warning message #8538

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  8 20:35:11 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.12.3:
  * Don't purge node_modules, when typing "n" in the prompt that
    asks whether to remove node_modules before installation #8655
  * Fix a bug causing pnpm to infinitely spawn itself when manage-
    package-manager-versions=true is set and the .tools directory is corrupt
  * Use crypto.hash, when available, for improved performance #8629
  * Fixed a race condition in temporary file creation in the
    store by including worker thread ID in filename. Previously,
    multiple worker threads could attempt to use the same
    temporary file. Temporary files now include both process ID
    and thread ID for uniqueness #8703
  * All commands should read settings from the package.json at
    the root of the workspace #8667
  * When manage-package-manager-versions is set to true, errors
    spawning a self-managed version of pnpm will now be shown
    (instead of being silent)
  * Pass the find command to npm, it is an alias for npm search
- includes 9.12.2:
  * When checking whether a file in the store has executable
    permissions, the new approach checks if at least one of the
    executable bits (owner, group, and others) is set to 1.
    Previously, a file was incorrectly considered executable only
    when all the executable bits were set to 1. This fix ensures
    that files with any executable permission, regardless of the
    user class, are now correctly identified as executable #8546

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  4 18:59:40 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.12.0:
  * Fix peer dependency resolution dead lock #8570. This change
    might change some of the keys in the snapshots field inside
    pnpm-lock.yaml but it should happen very rarely.
  * pnpm outdated command supports now a --sort-by=name option
    for sorting outdated dependencies by package name #8523
  * Added the ability for overrides to remove dependencies by
    specifying "-" as the field value #8572

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 00:17:17 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.10.0:
  * Support for a new CLI flag, --exclude-peers, added to the
    list and why commands. When --exclude-peers is used, peer
    dependencies are not printed in the results, but dependencies
    of peer dependencies are still scanned #8506.
  * Added a new setting to package.json at pnpm.auditConfig.
    ignoreGhsas for ignoring vulnerabilities by their GHSA code #6838.
  * Throw an exception if pnpm switches to the same version of itself.
  * Reduce memory usage during peer dependencies resolution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 11:54:31 UTC 2024 - Virinas-code <Virinas-code@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.9.0:
  * https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.8.0...v9.9.0
  * Minor breaking change. We had to optimize how we resolve peer
    dependencies in order to fix some infinite loops and
    out-of-memory errors during peer dependencies resolution.
  * pnpm deploy should write the node_modules/.modules.yaml to the
    node_modules directory within the deploy directory #7731
  * Don't override a symlink in node_modules if it already points
    to the right location pnpm/symlink-dir#54
- changes from 9.8.0:
  * https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.7.1...v9.8.0
  * Added a new command for upgrading pnpm itself when it isn't
    managed by Corepack: pnpm self-update. This command will work,
    when pnpm was installed via the standalone script from the pnpm
    installation page #8424
  * CLI tools installed in the root of the workspace should be
    added to the PATH, when running scripts and use-node-version is
    set
  * pnpm setup should never switch to another version of pnpm
  * Ignore non-string value in the os, cpu, libc fields, which
    checking optional dependencies #8431
  * Remember the state of edit dir, allow running pnpm patch-commit
    the second time without having to re-run pnpm patch
- changes from 9.7.1:
  * https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.7.0...v9.7.1
  * Fixed passing public-hoist-pattern and hoist-pattern via env
    variables #8339
  * pnpm setup no longer creates Batch/Powershell scripts on Linux
    and macOS #8418
  * When dlx uses cache, use the real directory path not the
    symlink to the cache #8421
  * pnpm exec now supports executionEnv #8356
  * Remove warnings for non-root pnpm field, add warnings for
    non-root pnpm subfields that aren't executionEnv #8143
  * Replace semver in "peerDependency" with workspace protocol
    #8355
  * Fix a bug in patch-commit in which relative path is rejected
    #8405
  * Update Node.js in @pnpm/exe to v20
- changes from 9.7.0:
  * https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.6.0...v9.7.0

    manage-package-manager-versions setting is set to true, pnpm
    will switch to the version specified in the packageManager
    field of package.json #8363
  * Added the ability to apply patch to all versions #8337
  * Change the default edit dir location when running pnpm patch
    from a temporary directory to
    node_modules/.pnpm_patches/pkg[@version] to allow the code
    editor to open the edit dir in the same file tree as the main
    project #8379.
  * Substitute environment variables in config keys #6679
  * pnpm install should run node-gyp rebuild if the project has a
    binding.gyp file even if the project doesn't have an install
    script #8293
  * Print warnings to stderr #8342
  * Peer dependencies of optional peer dependencies should be
    automatically installed #8323

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Add registries information to the calculation of dlx cache hash #8299

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  9 20:03:51 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

    dependents is set to true #6300
  * Fixed dlx not actually using the Node.js version specified by
    --use-node-version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  6 01:49:11 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.4.0:
  * Some registries allow the exact same content to be published
    under different package names and/or versions. This breaks
    the validity checks of packages in the store. To avoid errors
    when verifying the names and versions of such packages in the
    store, you may now set the strict-store-pkg-content-check
    setting to false #4724
  * Fix package-manager-strict-version missing in config #8195
  * If install is performed on a subset of workspace projects,
    always create an up-to-date lockfile first. So, a partial
    install can be performed only on a fully resolved (non-partial)
    lockfile #8165
  * Handle workspace protocol with any semver range specifier,
    when used in peer dependencies #7578

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 14 21:08:00 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.3.0:
  * Semi-breaking. Dependency key names in the lockfile are
    shortened if they are longer than 1000 characters. We don't
    expect this change to affect many users. Affected users most
    probably can't run install successfully at the moment. This
    change is required to fix some edge cases in which installation
    fails with an out-of-memory error or "Invalid string length
    (RangeError: Invalid string length)" error. The max allowed
    length of the dependency key can be controlled with the peers-
    suffix-max-length setting #8177.
  * Set reporter-hide-prefix to true by default for pnpm exec. In
    order to show prefix, the user now has to explicitly set reporter
    -hide-prefix=false #8174.
- changes from 9.2.0:
  * If package-manager-strict-version is set to true, pnpm will
    fail if its version doesn't exactly match the version in the
    "packageManager" field of package.json.
  * Update @yarnpkg/pnp to the latest version, fixing issue with
    node: imports #8161.
  * Deduplicate bin names to prevent race condition and corrupted
    bin scripts #7833.
  * pnpm doesn't fail if its version doesn't match the one
    specified in the "packageManager" field of package.json #8087.
  * exec now also streams prefixed output when --recursive or
    --parallel is specified just as run does #8065.
- changes from 9.1.4:
  * Improved the performance of the resolution stage by changing
    how missing peer dependencies are detected #8144.
- changes from 9.1.3:
  * Fix a bug in which a dependency that is both optional for one 
    package but non-optional for another is omitted when optional=false #8066.
  * Clear resolution cache before starting peer dependencies resolution #8109.
  * Reduce memory usage by peer dependencies resolution #8072.

- includes version 9.0.5:
  * Lockfiles with local or git-hosted dependencies are now
    successfully converted to the new lockfile format #7955.
  * Resolve peer dependencies correctly, when they have
    prerelease versions #7977.
  * Fix aliased dependencies resolution on repeat install with
    existing lockfile, when the aliased dependency doesn't
    specify a version or range #7957.
  * The lockfile should be saved in the new format even if it is
    up-to-date.
