- update to 10.17.1:
  * Patch Changes
    - When a version specifier cannot be resolved because the versions
      don't satisfy the minimumReleaseAge setting, print this
      information out in the error message #9974.
    - Fix state.json creation path when executing pnpm patch in a
      workspace project #9733.
    - When minimumReleaseAge is set and the latest tag is not mature
      enough, prefer a non-deprecated version as the new latest #9987.

Fri Sep 19 13:15:34 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.17:
  * Minor Changes
    - The minimumReleaseAgeExclude setting now supports patterns.
      For instance:

      minimumReleaseAge: 1440
      minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
        - "@eslint/*"

* Patch Changes
    - Don't ignore the minimumReleaseAge check, when the package is
      requested by exact version and the packument is loaded from
      cache #9978.
    - When minimumReleaseAge is set and the active version under a
      dist-tag is not mature enough, do not downgrade to a
      prerelease version in case the original version wasn't a
      prerelease one #9979.
- update to 10.16.1:
  * Patch Changes
    - The full metadata cache should be stored not at the same
      location as the abbreviated metadata. This fixes a bug where
      pnpm was loading the abbreviated metadata from cache and
      couldn't find the "time" field as a result #9963.
    - Forcibly disable ANSI color codes when generating patch diff
      #9914.
- update to 10.16:
  * Minor Changes
    - There have been several incidents recently where popular
      packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of
      installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new
      setting that delays the installation of newly released
      dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered
      quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the
      registry within an hour.
    - The new setting is called minimumReleaseAge. It specifies the
      number of minutes that must pass after a version is published
      before pnpm will install it. For example, setting
      minimumReleaseAge: 1440 ensures that only packages released
      at least one day ago can be installed.
    - If you set minimumReleaseAge but need to disable this
      restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under
      the minimumReleaseAgeExclude setting. For instance, with the
      following configuration pnpm will always install the latest
      version of webpack, regardless of its release time:

        minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
          - webpack

    - Added support for finders #9946.
      In the past, pnpm list and pnpm why could only search for
      dependencies by name (and optionally version). For example:

        pnpm why minimist

      prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of
      minimist:

        verdaccio 5.20.1
        ├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7
        │ └── minimist 1.2.8
        └─┬ mv 2.1.1
          └─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6
            └── minimist 1.2.8

      What if we want to search by other properties of a
      dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all
      packages that have react@17 in their peer dependencies?
      This is now possible with "finder functions". Finder
      functions can be declared in .pnpmfile.cjs and invoked with
      the --find-by=<function name> flag when running pnpm list or
      pnpm why.
      Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17
      in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our
      .pnpmfile.cjs:

        module.exports = {
          finders: {
            react17: (ctx) => {
              return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === "^17.0.0";
            },
          },
        };

      Now we can use this finder function by running:

        pnpm why --find-by=react17

      pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer
      dependencies and print their exact locations in the
      dependency graph.

        @apollo/client 4.0.4
        ├── @graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0
        └── graphql-tag 2.12.6

      It is also possible to print out some additional information
      in the output by returning a string from the finder. For
      example, with the following finder:

        module.exports = {
          finders: {
            react17: (ctx) => {
              const manifest = ctx.readManifest();
              if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === "^17.0.0") {
                return `license: ${manifest.license}`;
              }
              return false;
            },
          },
        };

      Every matched package will also print out the license from
      its package.json:

        @apollo/client 4.0.4
        ├── @graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0
        │   license: MIT
        └── graphql-tag 2.12.6
            license: MIT

  * Patch Changes
    - Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with
      Node.js 24 #9529.
    - Throw an error if nodeVersion is not set to an exact semver
      version #9934.
    - pnpm publish should be able to publish a .tar.gz file #9927.
    - Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make pnpm run
      return a non-zero exit code #9626.
- update to 10.15.1:
  * Patch Changes
    - Fix .pnp.cjs crash when importing subpath #9904.
    - When resolving peer dependencies, pnpm looks whether the peer
      dependency is present in the root workspace project's
      dependencies. This change makes it so that the peer
      dependency is correctly resolved even from aliased npm-hosted
      dependencies or other types of dependencies #9913.

Wed Aug 20 06:53:38 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.15.0:
  * Minor Changes
    - Added the cleanupUnusedCatalogs configuration. When set to
      true, pnpm will remove unused catalog entries during
      installation #9793.
    - Automatically load pnpmfiles from config dependencies that
      are named @*/pnpm-plugin-* #9780.
    - pnpm config get now prints an INI string for an object value
      #9797.
    - pnpm config get now accepts property paths (e.g. pnpm config
      get catalog.react, pnpm config get .catalog.react, pnpm
      config get
      'packageExtensions["@babel/parser"].peerDependencies["@babel/types"]'),
      and pnpm config set now accepts dot-leading or subscripted
      keys (e.g. pnpm config set .ignoreScripts true).
    - pnpm config get --json now prints a JSON serialization of
      config value, and pnpm config set --json now parses the input
      value as JSON.
  * Patch Changes
    - Semi-breaking. When automatically installing missing peer
      dependencies, prefer versions that are already present in the
      direct dependencies of the root workspace package #9835.
    - When executing the pnpm create command, must verify whether
      the node version is supported even if a cache already exists
      #9775.
    - When making requests for the non-abbreviated packument, add
      */* to the Accept header to avoid getting a 406 error on AWS
      CodeArtifact #9862.
    - The standalone exe version of pnpm works with glibc 2.26
      again #9734.
    - Fix a regression in which pnpm dlx pkg --help doesn't pass
      --help to pkg #9823.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  1 12:52:14 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.14.0:
  * Minor Changes
    - Added support for JavaScript runtime installation
      (Related PR: #9755.)
      Declare Node.js, Deno, or Bun in devEngines.runtime (inside
      package.json) and let pnpm download and pin it automatically.
      Usage example:

        {
          "devEngines": {
            "runtime": {
              "name": "node",
              "version": "^24.4.0",
              "onFail": "download" // we only support the "download" value for now
            }
          }
        }
      How it works:
      - pnpm install resolves your specified range to the latest
        matching runtime version.
      - The exact version (and checksum) is saved in the lockfile.
      - Scripts use the local runtime, ensuring consistency across
        environments.
      Why this is better:
      - This new setting supports also Deno and Bun (vs. our
        Node-only settings useNodeVersion and
        executionEnv.nodeVersion)
      - Supports version ranges (not just a fixed version).
      - The resolved version is stored in the pnpm lockfile, along
        with an integrity checksum for future validation of the
        Node.js content's validity.
      - It can be used on any workspace project (like
        executionEnv.nodeVersion). So, different projects in a
        workspace can use different runtimes.
      - For now devEngines.runtime setting will install the runtime
        locally, which we will improve in future versions of pnpm
        by using a shared location on the computer.
    - Add --cpu, --libc, and --os to pnpm install, pnpm add, and
      pnpm dlx to customize supportedArchitectures via the CLI
      #7510.
  * Patch Changes
    - Fix a bug in which pnpm add downloads packages whose libc
      differ from pnpm.supportedArchitectures.libc.
    - The integrities of the downloaded Node.js artifacts are
      verified #9750.
    - Allow dlx to parse CLI flags and options between the dlx
      command and the command to run or between the dlx command and
      -- #9719.
    - pnpm install --prod should removing hoisted dev dependencies
      #9782.
    - Fix an edge case bug causing local tarballs to not re-link
      into the virtual store. This bug would happen when changing
      the contents of the tarball without renaming the file and
      running a filtered install.
    - Fix a bug causing pnpm install to incorrectly assume the
      lockfile is up to date after changing a local tarball that
      has peers dependencies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  9 11:02:45 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.13.1:
  * Patch Changes
    - Run user defined pnpmfiles after pnpmfiles of plugins.
- update to 10.13.0:
  * Minor Changes
    - Added the possibility to load multiple pnpmfiles. The pnpmfile
      setting can now accept a list of pnpmfile locations #9702.
    - pnpm will now automatically load the pnpmfile.cjs file from any
      config dependency named @pnpm/plugin-* or pnpm-plugin-* #9729.
    - The order in which config dependencies are initialized should
      not matter — they are initialized in alphabetical order. If a
      specific order is needed, the paths to the pnpmfile.cjs files in
      the config dependencies can be explicitly listed using the
      pnpmfile setting in pnpm-workspace.yaml.
  * Patch Changes
    - When patching dependencies installed via pkg.pr.new, treat them
      as Git tarball URLs #9694.
    - Prevent conflicts between local projects' config and the global
      config in dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds, onlyBuiltDependencies,
      onlyBuiltDependenciesFile, and neverBuiltDependencies #9628.
    - Sort keys in pnpm-workspace.yaml with deep #9701.
    - The pnpm rebuild command should not add pkgs included in
      ignoredBuiltDependencies to ignoredBuilds in
      node_modules/.modules.yaml #9338.
    - Replaced shell-quote with shlex for quoting command arguments
      #9381.

- update to 10.12.4:
  * Patch Changes
    - Fix pnpm licenses command for local dependencies #9583.
    - Fix a bug in which pnpm ls --filter=not-exist --json prints
      nothing instead of an empty array #9672.
    - Fix a deadlock that sometimes happens during peer dependency
      resolution #9673.
    - Running pnpm install after pnpm fetch should hoist all
      dependencies that need to be hoisted.
    - Fixes a regression introduced in v10.12.2 by #9648; resolves
      #9689.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 24 11:02:21 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.12.3:
  * Patch Changes
    - Restore hoisting of optional peer dependencies when installing
      with an outdated lockfile.  Regression introduced in v10.12.2 by
      #9648; resolves #9685.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 23 04:46:30 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.12.2:
  * Patch Changes
    - Fixed hoisting with enableGlobalVirtualStore set to true #9648.
    - Fix the --help and -h flags not working as expected for the pnpm
      create command.
    - The dependency package path output by the pnpm licenses list
      --json command is incorrect.
    - Fix a bug in which pnpm deploy fails due to overridden
      dependencies having peer dependencies causing
      ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE #9595.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  8 14:55:22 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.12.1 (10.2.0 was yanked):
  * Minor Changes
    - Experimental. Added support for global virtual stores. When
      enabled, node_modules contains only symlinks to a central
      virtual store, rather to node_modules/.pnpm. By default, this
      central store is located at <store-path>/links (you can find
      the store path by running pnpm store path).
      In the central virtual store, each package is hard linked
      into a directory whose name is the hash of its dependency
      graph. This allows multiple projects on the system to symlink
      shared dependencies from this central location, significantly
      improving installation speed when a warm cache is available.
        This is conceptually similar to how NixOS manages packages,
        using dependency graph hashes to create isolated and
        reusable package directories.
      To enable the global virtual store, set
      enableGlobalVirtualStore: true in your root
      pnpm-workspace.yaml, or globally via:
        pnpm config -g set enable-global-virtual-store true
      NOTE: In CI environments, where caches are typically cold,
      this setting may slow down installation. pnpm automatically
      disables the global virtual store when running in CI.
      Related PR: #8190
    - The pnpm update command now supports updating catalog:
      protocol dependencies and writes new specifiers to
      pnpm-workspace.yaml.
    - A new catalogMode setting is available for controlling if and
      how dependencies are added to the default catalog. It can be
      configured to several modes:
      - strict: Only allows dependency versions from the catalog.
        Adding a dependency outside the catalog's version range
        will cause an error.
      - prefer: Prefers catalog versions, but will fall back to
        direct dependencies if no compatible version is found.
      - manual (default): Does not automatically add dependencies
        to the catalog.
    - Added two new CLI options (--save-catalog and
      --save-catalog-name=<name>) to pnpm add to save new
      dependencies as catalog entries. catalog: or catalog:<name>
      will be added to package.json and the package specifier will
      be added to the catalogs or catalog[<name>] object in
      pnpm-workspace.yaml #9425.
    - Semi-breaking. The keys used for side-effects caches have
      changed. If you have a side-effects cache generated by a
      previous version of pnpm, the new version will not use it and
      will create a new cache instead #9605.
    - Added a new setting called ci for explicitly telling pnpm if
      the current environment is a CI or not.
  * Patch Changes
    - Sort versions printed by pnpm patch using semantic versioning
      rules.
    - Improve the way the error message displays mismatched
      specifiers. Show differences instead of 2 whole objects
      #9598.
    - Revert #9574 to fix a regression #9596.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  2 15:39:10 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.11.1:
  * Patch Changes
    - Fix an issue in which pnpm deploy --legacy creates unexpected
      directories when the root package.json has a workspace
      package as a peer dependency #9550.
    - Dependencies specified via a URL that redirects will only be
      locked to the target if it is immutable, fixing a regression
      when installing from GitHub releases. (#9531)
    - Installation should not exit with an error if
      strictPeerDependencies is true but all issues are ignored by
      peerDependencyRules #9505.
    - Use pnpm_config_ env variables instead of npm_config_ #9571.
    - Fix a regression (in v10.9.0) causing the --lockfile-only
      flag on pnpm update to produce a different pnpm-lock.yaml
      than an update without the flag.
    - Let pnpm deploy work in repos with overrides when
      inject-workspace-packages=true #9283.
    - Fixed the problem of path loss caused by parsing URL address.
      Fixes a regression shipped in pnpm v10.11 via #9502.
    - pnpm -r --silent run should not print out section #9563.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- add Requires for nodejs(abi) >= 18

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 14 04:42:39 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.11.0:
  * Minor Changes
    - A new setting added for pnpm init to create a package.json
      with type=module, when init-type is module. Works as a flag
      for the init command too #9463.
    - Added support for Nushell to pnpm setup #6476.
    - Added two new flags to the pnpm audit command, --ignore and
      --ignore-unfixable #8474.
      Ignore all vulnerabilities that have no solution:
      > pnpm audit --ignore-unfixable
      Provide a list of CVE's to ignore those specifically, even if
      they have a resolution.
      > pnpm audit --ignore=CVE-2021-1234 --ignore=CVE-2021-5678
    - Added support for recursively running pack in every project
      of a workspace #4351.
      Now you can run pnpm -r pack to pack all packages in the
      workspace.
  * Patch Changes
    - pnpm version management should work, when
      dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds is set to true #9472.
    - pnpm link should work from inside a workspace #9506.
    - Set the default workspaceConcurrency to
      Math.min(os.availableParallelism(), 4) #9493.
    - Installation should not exit with an error if
      strictPeerDependencies is true but all issues are ignored by
      peerDependencyRules #9505.
    - Read updateConfig from pnpm-workspace.yaml #9500.
    - Add support for recursive pack
    - Remove url.parse usage to fix warning on Node.js 24 #9492.
    - pnpm run should be able to run commands from the workspace
      root, if ignoreScripts is set tot true #4858.

Sun May 11 18:09:28 UTC 2025 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to 10.10.0:
  * Allow loading the preResolution, importPackage, and fetchers
    hooks from local pnpmfile.
  * Fix cd command, when shellEmulator is true #7838.
  * Sort keys in pnpm-workspace.yaml #9453.
  * Pass the npm_package_json environment variable to the
    executed scripts #9452.
  * Fixed a mistake in the description of the --reporter=silent
    option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 21 11:04:21 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.9.0:
  * Minor Changes
    - Added support for installing JSR packages. You can now
      install JSR packages using the following syntax:
        add jsr:<pkg_name>
      or with a version range:
        pnpm add jsr:<pkg_name>@<range>
      For example, running:
        pnpm add jsr:@foo/bar
      will add the following entry to your package.json:
        {
          "dependencies": {
            "@foo/bar": "jsr:^0.1.2"
          }
        }
      When publishing, this entry will be transformed into a format
      compatible with npm, older versions of Yarn, and previous
      pnpm versions:
        {
          "dependencies": {
            "@foo/bar": "npm:@jsr/foo__bar@^0.1.2"
          }
        }
      Related issue: #8941.
      Note: The @jsr scope defaults to https://npm.jsr.io/ if the
      @jsr:registry setting is not defined.
    - Added a new setting, dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds, for
      automatically running any scripts of dependencies without the
      need to approve any builds. It was already possible to allow
      all builds by adding this to pnpm-workspace.yaml:
        neverBuiltDependencies: []
      dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds has the same effect but also allows
      to be set globally via:
        pnpm config set dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds true
      It can also be set when running a command:
        pnpm install --dangerously-allow-all-builds
  * Patch Changes
    - Fix a false negative in verifyDepsBeforeRun when nodeLinker
      is hoisted and there is a workspace package without
      dependencies and node_modules directory #9424.
    - Explicitly drop verifyDepsBeforeRun support for nodeLinker:
      pnp. Combining verifyDepsBeforeRun and nodeLinker: pnp will
      now print a warning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 14 13:21:23 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- udate to 10.8.1:
  * Patch Changes
    - Removed bright white highlighting, which didn't look good on
      some light themes #9389.
    - If there is no pnpm related configuration in package.json,
      onlyBuiltDependencies will be written to pnpm-workspace.yaml
      file #9404.
    - The patch file path saved by the pnpm patch-commit and
      patch-remove commands should be a relative path #9403.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  8 04:50:08 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.8:
  * Minor Changes
      Experimental. A new hook is supported for updating
      configuration settings. The hook can be provided via
      .pnpmfile.cjs. For example:

        module.exports = {
          hooks: {
            updateConfig: (config) => ({
              ...config,
              nodeLinker: "hoisted",
            }),
          },
        };

      Now you can use the pnpm add command with the --config flag
      to install new configurational dependencies #9377.
  * Patch Changes
    - Do not hang indefinitely, when there is a glob that starts
      with !/ in pnpm-workspace.yaml. This fixes a regression
      introduced by #9169.
    - pnpm audit --fix should update the overrides in
      pnpm-workspace.yaml.
    - pnpm link should update overrides in pnpm-workspace.yaml, not
      in package.json #9365.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  1 12:34:12 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.7.1:
  * Patch Changes
    - pnpm config set should convert the settings to their correct
      type before adding them to pnpm-workspace.yaml #9355.
    - pnpm config get should read auth related settings via npm CLI
      #9345.
    - Replace leading ~/ in a path in .npmrc with the home directory
      #9217.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 26 11:44:45 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.7:
  * Minor Changes
    - pnpm config get and list also show settings set in
      pnpm-workspace.yaml files #9316.
    - It should be possible to use env variables in
      pnpm-workspace.yaml setting names and value.
    - Add an ability to patch dependencies by version ranges. Exact
      versions override version ranges, which in turn override
      name-only patches. Version range * is the same as name-only,
      except that patch application failure will not be ignored.
      For example:

        patchedDependencies:
          foo: patches/foo-1.patch
          foo@^2.0.0: patches/foo-2.patch
          foo@2.1.0: patches/foo-3.patch

      The above configuration would apply patches/foo-3.patch to
      foo@2.1.0, patches/foo-2.patch to all foo versions which
      satisfy ^2.0.0 except 2.1.0, and patches/foo-1.patch to the
      remaining foo versions.
      [!WARNING]
      The version ranges should not overlap. If you want to
      specialize a sub range, make sure to exclude it from the
      other keys. For example:

        # pnpm-workspace.yaml
        patchedDependencies:
          # the specialized sub range
          'foo@2.2.0-2.8.0': patches/foo.2.2.0-2.8.0.patch
          # the more general patch, excluding the sub range above
          'foo@>=2.0.0 <2.2.0 || >2.8.0': 'patches/foo.gte2.patch

      In most cases, however, it's sufficient to just define an
      exact version to override the range.
    - pnpm config set --location=project saves the setting to a
      pnpm-workspace.yaml file if no .npmrc file is present in the
      directory #9316.
    - Rename pnpm.allowNonAppliedPatches to
      pnpm.allowUnusedPatches. The old name is still supported but
      it would print a deprecation warning message.
    - Add pnpm.ignorePatchFailures to manage whether pnpm would
      ignore patch application failures.
      - If ignorePatchFailures is not set, pnpm would throw an
        error when patches with exact versions or version ranges
        fail to apply, and it would ignore failures from name-only
        patches.
      - If ignorePatchFailures is explicitly set to false, pnpm
        would throw an error when any type of patch fails to apply.
      - If ignorePatchFailures is explicitly set to true, pnpm
        would print a warning when any type of patch fails to
        apply.
  * Patch Changes
    - Remove dependency paths from audit output to prevent
      out-of-memory errors #9280.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 19 14:58:30 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.6.5:
  * Patch Changes
    - Remove warnings after having explicitly approved no builds
      #9296.
    - When installing different dependency packages, should retain
      the ignoredBuilds field in the .modules.yaml file #9240.
    - Fix usages of the catalog: protocol in injected local
      workspace packages. This previously errored with
      ERR_PNPM_SPEC_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_ANY_RESOLVER. #8715
    - Setting workspace-concurrency to less than or equal to 0
      should work #9297.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 17 14:11:33 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.6.4:
  * Patch Changes
    - Fix pnpm dlx with --allow-build flag #9263.
    - Invalid Node.js version in use-node-version should not cause
      pnpm itself to break #9276.
    - The max amount of workers running for linking packages from
      the store has been reduced to 4 to achieve optimal results
      #9286. The workers are performing many file system
      operations, so increasing the number of CPUs doesn't help
      performance after some point.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 13 18:19:39 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.6.3:
  * Patch Changes
    - pnpm install --prod=false should not crash, when executed in
      a project with a pnpm-workspace.yaml file #9233. This fixes
      regression introduced via #9211.
    - Add the missing node-options config to recursive run #9180.
    - Removed a branching code path that only executed when
      dedupe-peer-dependents=false. We believe this internal
      refactor will not result in behavior changes, but we expect
      it to make future pnpm versions behave more consistently for
      projects that override dedupe-peer-dependents to false. There
      should be less unique bugs from turning off
      dedupe-peer-dependents.
      See details in #9259.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 10 06:55:55 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.6.2:
  * Patch Changes
    - pnpm self-update should always update the version in the
      packageManager field of package.json.
    - Fix running pnpm CLI from pnpm CLI on Windows when the CLI is
      bundled to an executable #8971.
    - pnpm patch-commit will now use the same filesystem as the
      store directory to compare and create patch files.
    - Don't show info output when --loglevel=error is used.
    - peerDependencyRules should be set in pnpm-workspace.yaml to
      take effect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  7 06:35:02 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.6.1:
  * Patch Changes
    - The pnpm CLI process should not stay hanging, when --silent
      reporting is used.
    - When --loglevel is set to error, don't show installation
      summary, execution time, and big tarball download progress.
    - Don't ignore pnpm.patchedDependencies from package.json
      #9226.
    - When executing the approve-builds command, if package.json
      contains onlyBuiltDependencies or ignoredBuiltDependencies,
      the selected dependency package will continue to be written
      into package.json.
    - When a package version cannot be found in the package
      metadata, print the registry from which the package was
      fetched.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  6 13:03:35 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.6.0:
  * Minor Changes
    - pnpm-workspace.yaml can now hold all the settings that .npmrc
      accepts. The settings should use camelCase #9211.
      pnpm-workspace.yaml example:

        verifyDepsBeforeRun: install
        optimisticRepeatInstall: true
        publicHoistPattern:
          - "*types*"
          - "!@types/react"

    - Projects using a file: dependency on a local tarball file
      (i.e. .tgz, .tar.gz, .tar) will see a performance improvement
      during installation. Previously, using a file: dependency on
      a tarball caused the lockfile resolution step to always run.
      The lockfile will now be considered up-to-date if the tarball
      is unchanged.
  * Patch Changes
    - pnpm self-update should not leave a directory with a broken
      pnpm installation if the installation fails.
    - fast-glob replace with tinyglobby to reduce the size of the
      pnpm CLI dependencies #9169.
    - pnpm deploy should not remove fields from the deployed
      package's package.json file #9215.
    - pnpm self-update should not read the pnpm settings from the
      package.json file in the current working directory.
    - Fix pnpm deploy creating a package.json without the imports
      and license field #9193.
    - pnpm update -i should list only packages that have newer
      versions #9206.
    - Fix a bug causing entries in the catalogs section of the
      pnpm-lock.yaml file to be removed when
      dedupe-peer-dependents=false on a filtered install. #9112

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 27 05:44:17 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.5.2:
  * The pnpm config set command should change the global .npmrc
    file by default.
    This was a regression introduced by #9151 and shipped in pnpm
    v10.5.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 26 13:36:14 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 10.5.1:
  * Throw an error message if a pnpm-workspaces.yaml or
    pnpm-workspaces.yml file is found instead of a
    pnpm-workspace.yaml #9170.
  * Fix the update of pnpm-workspace.yaml by the pnpm
    approve-builds command #9168.
  * Normalize generated link paths in package.json #9163
  * Specifying overrides in pnpm-workspace.yaml should work.
  * pnpm dlx should ignore settings from the package.json file in
    the current working directory #9178.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 25 22:39:13 UTC 2025 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to 10.5.0:
  * The pnpm.* settings from package.json can now be specified in
    the pnpm-workspace.yaml file instead #9121.
  * Added support for automatically syncing files of injected
    workspace packages after pnpm run #9081. Use the sync-injected
    -deps-after-scripts setting to specify which scripts build
    the workspace package. This tells pnpm when syncing is needed.
    The setting should be defined in a .npmrc file at the root of
    the workspace.
  * The packages field in pnpm-workspace.yaml became optional.
  * pnpm link with no parameters should work as if --global is
    specified #9151
  * Allow scope registry CLI option without --config. prefix such
    as --@scope:registry=https://scope.example.com/npm #9089
  * pnpm link <path> should calculate relative path from the root
    of the workspace directory #9132
  * Fix a bug causing catalog snapshots to be removed from the
    pnpm-lock.yaml file when using --fix-lockfile and --filter. #8639
  * Fix a bug causing catalog protocol dependencies to not re-
    resolve on a filtered install #8638

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 17 21:32:43 UTC 2025 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to 10.4.1:
  * Throws an error when the value provided by the --allow-build
    option overlaps with the pnpm.ignoredBuildDependencies list #9105.
  * Print pnpm's version after the execution time at the end of the console output.
  * Print warning about ignored builds of dependencies on repeat install #9106.
  * Setting init-package-manager should work.
- includes 10.4.0:
  * pnpm approve-builds --global works now for allowing
    dependencies of globally installed packages to run
    postinstall scripts.
  * The pnpm add command now supports a new flag, --allow-build,
    which allows building the specified dependencies.
  * pnpm approve-builds should work after two consecutive pnpm install runs #9083.
  * Fix instruction for updating pnpm with corepack #9101.
  * The pnpm version specified by packageManager cannot start with v.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 11 23:18:18 UTC 2025 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to 10.3.0:
  * Added a new setting called strict-dep-builds. When enabled,
    the installation will exit with a non-zero exit code if any
    dependencies have unreviewed build scripts (aka postinstall scripts) #9071.
  * Fix a false negative of verify-deps-before-run after pnpm
    install --production|--no-optional #9019.
  * Print the warning about blocked installation scripts at the
    end of the installation output and make it more prominent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  8 21:55:32 UTC 2025 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to 10.2.1:
  * Don't read a package from side-effects cache if it isn't
    allowed to be built #9042.
  * pnpm approve-builds should work, when executed from a
    subdirectory of a workspace #9042.
  * pnpm deploy --legacy should work without injected dependencies
  * Add information about how to deploy without "injected
    dependencies" to the "pnpm deploy" error message.
- includes 10.2.0:
  * Packages executed via pnpm dlx and pnpm create are allowed to
    be built (run postinstall scripts) by default.
  * Quote args for scripts with shell-quote to support new lines
    (on POSIX only) #8980.
  * Fix a bug in which pnpm deploy fails to read the correct
    projectId when the deploy source is the same as the workspace directory #9001.
  * Proxy settings should be respected, when resolving Git-hosted
    dependencies #6530.
  * Prevent overrides from adding invalid version ranges to
    peerDependencies by keeping the peerDependencies and
    overriding them with prod dependencies #8978.
  * Sort the package names in the "pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies"
    list saved by pnpm approve-builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 31 00:43:45 UTC 2025 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to 10.1.0:
  * Added a new command for printing the list of dependencies
    with ignored build scripts: pnpm ignored-builds #8963.
  * Added a new command for approving dependencies for running
    scripts during installation: pnpm approve-builds #8963.
  * Added a new setting called optimistic-repeat-install. When
    enabled, a fast check will be performed before proceeding to
    installation. This way a repeat install or an install on a
    project with everything up-to-date becomes a lot faster. But
    some edge cases might arise, so we keep it disabled by
    default for now #8977.
  * Added a new field "pnpm.ignoredBuiltDependencies" for
    explicitly listing packages that should not be built. When a
    package is in the list, pnpm will not print an info message
    about that package not being built #8935.
  * Verify that the package name is valid when executing the
    publish command.
  * When running pnpm install, the preprepare and postprepare
    scripts of the project should be executed #8989.
  * Allow workspace: and catalog: to be part of wider version
    range in peerDependencies.
  * pnpm deploy should inherit the pnpm object from the root
    package.json #8991.
  * Make sure that the deletion of a node_modules in a sub-
    project of a monorepo is detected as out-of-date #8959.
  * Fix infinite loop caused by lifecycle scripts using pnpm to
    execute other scripts during pnpm install with
    verify-deps-before-run=install #8954.
  * Replace strip-ansi with the built-in util.
    stripVTControlCharacters #9009.
  * Do not print patched dependencies as ignored dependencies
    that require a build #8952.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 10 00:08:03 UTC 2025 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to 10.0.0:
  * Lifecycle scripts of dependencies are not executed during
    installation by default! This is a breaking change aimed at
    increasing security. In order to allow lifecycle scripts of
    specific dependencies, they should be listed in the pnpm
    onlyBuiltDependencies field of package.json #8897
  * The pnpm link command now adds overrides to the root package.json. #8653
  * Secure hashing with SHA256
  * Configuration updates
  * Changes to the global store
  * The # character is now escaped in directory names within
    node_modules/.pnpm. #8557
  * Running pnpm add --global pnpm or pnpm add --global @pnpm/exe
    now fails with an error message, directing you to use pnpm
    self-update instead. #8728
  * Dependencies added via a URL now record the final resolved
    URL in the lockfile, ensuring that any redirects are fully
    captured. #8833
  * The pnpm deploy command now only works in workspaces that
    have inject-workspace-packages=true. This limitation is
    introduced to allow us to create a proper lockfile for the
    deployed project using the workspace lockfile.
  * Removed conversion from lockfile v6 to v9. If you need v6-to-
    v9 conversion, use pnpm CLI v9.
  * pnpm test now passes all parameters after the test keyword
    directly to the underlying script. This matches the behavior
    of pnpm run test. Previously you needed to use the -- prefix. #8619
  * node-gyp updated to version 11.
  * pnpm deploy now tries creating a dedicated lockfile from a
    shared lockfile for deployment. It will fallback to
    deployment without a lockfile if there is no shared lockfile
    or force-legacy-deploy is set to true.
  * Added support for a new type of dependencies called
    "configurational dependencies". These dependencies are
    installed before all the other types of dependencies (befor
    "dependencies", "devDependencies", "optionalDependencies").
  * New verify-deps-before-run setting. This setting controls how
    pnpm checks node_modules before running scripts #8836
  * On repeated installs, pnpm performs a quick check to ensure
    node_modules is up to date. #8838
  * pnpm add integrates with default workspace catalog: #8640
  * pnpm dlx now resolves packages to their exact versions and
    uses these exact versions for cache keys. This ensures pnpm
    dlx always installs the latest requested packages #8811
  * No node_modules validation on certain commands. Commands that
    should not modify node_modules (e.g., pnpm install --lockfile-
    only) no longer validate or purge node_modules. #8657
  * for full changes, see https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.0.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  6 05:41:24 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 9.15.3:
  * Fixed the Regex used to find the package manifest during
    packing #8938.
  * pnpm update --filter <pattern> --latest <pkg> should only
    change the specified package for the specified workspace, when
    dedupe-peer-dependents is set to true #8877.
  * Exclude .DS_Store file at patch-commit #8922.
  * Fix a bug in which pnpm patch is unable to bring back old patch
    without specifying @version suffix #8919.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 30 07:25:14 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 9.15.2:
  * Fixed publish/pack error with workspace dependencies with
    relative paths #8904. It was broken in v9.4.0 (398472c).
  * Use double quotes in the command suggestion by pnpm patch on
    Windows #7546.
  * Do not fall back to SSH, when resolving a git-hosted package if
    git ls-remote works via HTTPS #8906.
  * Improve how packages with blocked lifecycle scripts are
    reported during installation. Always print the list of ignored
    scripts at the end of the output. Include a hint about how to
    allow the execution of those packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 22 21:17:02 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.15.1:
  * pnpm remove should not link dependencies from the workspace,
    when link-workspace-packages is set to false #7674
  * Installation with hoisted node_modules should not fail, when
    a dependency has itself in its own peer dependencies #8854

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  7 19:23:19 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.15.0:
  * Metadata directory version bumped to force fresh cache after
    we shipped a fix to the metadata write function. This change
    is backward compatible as install doesn't require a metadata cache
  * pnpm update --global should not crash if there are no any
    global packages installed #7898
  * Fix an exception when running pnpm update --interactive if
    catalogs are used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 30 20:15:39 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.14.4:

  * Convert settings in local .npmrc files to their correct types.
    For instance, child-concurrency should be a number, not a string #5075
  * pnpm should fail if a project requires a different package
    manager even if manage-package-manager-versions is set to true
  * pnpm init should respect the --dir option #8768
- includes 9.14.0:
  * chore: use verify-deps-before-run

Sat Nov 16 19:08:45 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.13.2:
  * Detection of circular peer dependencies should not crash with
    aliased dependencies #8759. Fixes a regression introduced in
    the previous version.
  * Fix race condition of symlink creations caused by multiple
    parallel dlx processes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 14 19:00:27 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.13.1:
  * Fixed some edge cases where resolving circular peer
    dependencies caused a dead lock #8720

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 13 22:13:33 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.13.0:
  * The self-update now accepts a version specifier to install a
    specific version of pnpm.
  * Fix Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') that
    is printed while trying to render the missing peer
    dependencies warning message #8538

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  8 20:35:11 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.12.3:
  * Don't purge node_modules, when typing "n" in the prompt that
    asks whether to remove node_modules before installation #8655
  * Fix a bug causing pnpm to infinitely spawn itself when manage-
    package-manager-versions=true is set and the .tools directory is corrupt
  * Use crypto.hash, when available, for improved performance #8629
  * Fixed a race condition in temporary file creation in the
    store by including worker thread ID in filename. Previously,
    multiple worker threads could attempt to use the same
    temporary file. Temporary files now include both process ID
    and thread ID for uniqueness #8703
  * All commands should read settings from the package.json at
    the root of the workspace #8667
  * When manage-package-manager-versions is set to true, errors
    spawning a self-managed version of pnpm will now be shown
    (instead of being silent)
  * Pass the find command to npm, it is an alias for npm search
- includes 9.12.2:
  * When checking whether a file in the store has executable
    permissions, the new approach checks if at least one of the
    executable bits (owner, group, and others) is set to 1.
    Previously, a file was incorrectly considered executable only
    when all the executable bits were set to 1. This fix ensures
    that files with any executable permission, regardless of the
    user class, are now correctly identified as executable #8546

- update to version 9.12.0:
  * Fix peer dependency resolution dead lock #8570. This change
    might change some of the keys in the snapshots field inside
    pnpm-lock.yaml but it should happen very rarely.
  * pnpm outdated command supports now a --sort-by=name option
    for sorting outdated dependencies by package name #8523
  * Added the ability for overrides to remove dependencies by
    specifying "-" as the field value #8572

  * Don't print a warning when linking packages globally #4761

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 00:17:17 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.10.0:
  * Support for a new CLI flag, --exclude-peers, added to the
    list and why commands. When --exclude-peers is used, peer
    dependencies are not printed in the results, but dependencies
    of peer dependencies are still scanned #8506.
  * Added a new setting to package.json at pnpm.auditConfig.
    ignoreGhsas for ignoring vulnerabilities by their GHSA code #6838.
  * Throw an exception if pnpm switches to the same version of itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 11:54:31 UTC 2024 - Virinas-code <Virinas-code@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.9.0:
  * https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.8.0...v9.9.0
  * Minor breaking change. We had to optimize how we resolve peer
    dependencies in order to fix some infinite loops and
    out-of-memory errors during peer dependencies resolution.
  * pnpm deploy should write the node_modules/.modules.yaml to the
    node_modules directory within the deploy directory #7731
  * Don't override a symlink in node_modules if it already points
    to the right location pnpm/symlink-dir#54
- changes from 9.8.0:
  * https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.7.1...v9.8.0
  * Added a new command for upgrading pnpm itself when it isn't
    managed by Corepack: pnpm self-update. This command will work,
    when pnpm was installed via the standalone script from the pnpm
    installation page #8424
  * CLI tools installed in the root of the workspace should be
    added to the PATH, when running scripts and use-node-version is
    set
  * pnpm setup should never switch to another version of pnpm
  * Ignore non-string value in the os, cpu, libc fields, which
    checking optional dependencies #8431
  * Remember the state of edit dir, allow running pnpm patch-commit
    the second time without having to re-run pnpm patch
- changes from 9.7.1:
  * https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.7.0...v9.7.1
  * Fixed passing public-hoist-pattern and hoist-pattern via env
    variables #8339
  * pnpm setup no longer creates Batch/Powershell scripts on Linux
    and macOS #8418
  * When dlx uses cache, use the real directory path not the
    symlink to the cache #8421
  * pnpm exec now supports executionEnv #8356
  * Remove warnings for non-root pnpm field, add warnings for
    non-root pnpm subfields that aren't executionEnv #8143
  * Replace semver in "peerDependency" with workspace protocol
    #8355
  * Fix a bug in patch-commit in which relative path is rejected
    #8405
  * Update Node.js in @pnpm/exe to v20
- changes from 9.7.0:
  * https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/compare/v9.6.0...v9.7.0

    manage-package-manager-versions setting is set to true, pnpm
    will switch to the version specified in the packageManager
    field of package.json #8363
  * Added the ability to apply patch to all versions #8337
  * Change the default edit dir location when running pnpm patch
    from a temporary directory to
    node_modules/.pnpm_patches/pkg[@version] to allow the code
    editor to open the edit dir in the same file tree as the main
    project #8379.
  * Substitute environment variables in config keys #6679
  * pnpm install should run node-gyp rebuild if the project has a
    binding.gyp file even if the project doesn't have an install
    script #8293
  * Print warnings to stderr #8342
  * Peer dependencies of optional peer dependencies should be
    automatically installed #8323

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 25 20:35:23 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.6.0:
  * Support specifying node version (via pnpm.executionEnv.nodeVersion
    in package.json) for running lifecycle scripts per each package
    in a workspace #6720
  * Overrides now support the catalogs: protocol #8303

  * Add registries information to the calculation of dlx cache hash #8299

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  9 20:03:51 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.5.0:
  * Added support for catalogs #8122

    directory when running dlx #7996
  * Updated @pnpm/tabtab to v0.5.4, enabling zsh autocomplete
    lazy loading #8236

    dependents is set to true #6300
  * Fixed dlx not actually using the Node.js version specified by
    --use-node-version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  6 01:49:11 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.4.0:
  * Some registries allow the exact same content to be published
    under different package names and/or versions. This breaks
    the validity checks of packages in the store. To avoid errors
    when verifying the names and versions of such packages in the
    store, you may now set the strict-store-pkg-content-check
    setting to false #4724
  * Fix package-manager-strict-version missing in config #8195
  * If install is performed on a subset of workspace projects,
    always create an up-to-date lockfile first. So, a partial
    install can be performed only on a fully resolved (non-partial)
    lockfile #8165
  * Handle workspace protocol with any semver range specifier,
    when used in peer dependencies #7578

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 14 21:08:00 UTC 2024 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- update to version 9.3.0:
  * Semi-breaking. Dependency key names in the lockfile are
    shortened if they are longer than 1000 characters. We don't
    expect this change to affect many users. Affected users most
    probably can't run install successfully at the moment. This
    change is required to fix some edge cases in which installation
    fails with an out-of-memory error or "Invalid string length
    (RangeError: Invalid string length)" error. The max allowed
    length of the dependency key can be controlled with the peers-
    suffix-max-length setting #8177.
  * Set reporter-hide-prefix to true by default for pnpm exec. In
    order to show prefix, the user now has to explicitly set reporter
    -hide-prefix=false #8174.
- changes from 9.2.0:
  * If package-manager-strict-version is set to true, pnpm will
    fail if its version doesn't exactly match the version in the
    "packageManager" field of package.json.
  * Update @yarnpkg/pnp to the latest version, fixing issue with
    node: imports #8161.
  * Deduplicate bin names to prevent race condition and corrupted
    bin scripts #7833.
  * pnpm doesn't fail if its version doesn't match the one
    specified in the "packageManager" field of package.json #8087.
  * exec now also streams prefixed output when --recursive or
    --parallel is specified just as run does #8065.
- changes from 9.1.4:
  * Improved the performance of the resolution stage by changing
    how missing peer dependencies are detected #8144.
- changes from 9.1.3:
  * Fix a bug in which a dependency that is both optional for one
    package but non-optional for another is omitted when optional=false #8066.
  * Clear resolution cache before starting peer dependencies resolution #8109.
  * Reduce memory usage by peer dependencies resolution #8072.

  * Lockfiles that have git-hosted dependencies specified should
    be correctly converted to the new lockfile format #7990.
  * Don't upgrade the lockfile format on pnpm install
    --frozen-lockfile #7991.
- includes version 9.0.5:
  * Lockfiles with local or git-hosted dependencies are now
    successfully converted to the new lockfile format #7955.
  * Resolve peer dependencies correctly, when they have
    prerelease versions #7977.
  * Fix aliased dependencies resolution on repeat install with
    existing lockfile, when the aliased dependency doesn't
    specify a version or range #7957.
  * The lockfile should be saved in the new format even if it is
    up-to-date.
