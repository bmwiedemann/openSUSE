  * Vulkan: Avoid duplicate image pre-transitions (actually eliminated later anyway, but a small saving)
  * Vulkan transitions after render: Add a missing case that seems like it could be common?
  * Avoid an assert in ARM64 emitter, seen in Google Play crash logs

  * Complete a comment.
  * Vulkan: Fix colors for low-bpp depal (actually fixing the shadows of ff-type0)
  * Make VulkanTexture "immutable".
  * Add some disabled code to submit "init" command buffers separately to the queue for debugging.
  * Always recreate DrawPixelsTex to avoid inter-frame races.

- Update to version 1.4.2~git20171029:
  * Share the conversion code between vulkan and D3D, fixing the missing format thing.
  * Color-convert directly during the readback, saves a copy. Like we already do in D3D11.
  * Revert most of the last commit - will do it differently.
  * Use the CPU color conversion from GLES for readbacks in Vulkan (and D3D11). Fix bug.
  * Fix Vulkan framebuffer readbacks, as long as they're in R8G8B8A8.

  * Another buildfix
  * Fix integer overflow affecting very large draw calls
  * More buildfixes, warning fix, memory leak fix
  * 32-bit android buildfix attempt
  * Bump descriptor set limits, which became insufficient with the addition of tesselation (should really use separate big desc layouts for them)
  * Remove misguided hack.
  * Warning fixes
  * Remove a bad check making us use the wrong way to copy depth buffers.  Add a cap so we can try to unify BlitFramebufferDepth later.
  * Assorted fixes
  * Fix (some) crashes on blits. Validation issues remain.
  * Forgot to add the CMakeLists.txt change to the last commit.
  * Warning fixes, CMakeLists.txt/Android.mk fixes
  * Fix some resource leaks and excessive logging in VulkanRenderManager
  * Clean out some obsolete code
  * VulkanRenderManager: BindPipeline should really be its own command. Tighten up some image transitions.
  * Improve synchronization, though there are very weird issues. Possibly need to run the swap chain from the thread that created it?
  * Avoid re-binding pipelines.
  * Let's try a mutex. Doesn't completely solve the problem though..
  * Make sure not to begin and end the init command buffer on different threads.
  * Vulkan: Don't forget to specify stencil load op in render passes
  * This makes a little more sense, but still hangs (frameAvailable = true while stuck on condvar)
  * Synchronization is HARD. need a rethink, methinks.
  * Move the VulkanRenderManager stuff to thin3d, fits in better there.
  * Rendering basics now works.
  * A multitude of fixes. The UI now works correctly, though of course ingame still broken.
