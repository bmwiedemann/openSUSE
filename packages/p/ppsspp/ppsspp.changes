Set default to 128ms instead. * Different audio approach is necessary due to the following: it sets a   fixed framerate of 60, then sends either too many or too few audio samples per frame in order to force the frontend to run at the correct speed (.e.g. making the frontend run in slow motion for games that run at 30fps) - this is undesirable for libretro, we want a consistent amount of audio samples per batch.

  * Fix a java exception around the GPS stuff
  * Vulkan: Avoid duplicate image pre-transitions (actually eliminated later anyway, but a small saving)
  * Vulkan transitions after render: Add a missing case that seems like it could be common?
  * Avoid an assert in ARM64 emitter, seen in Google Play crash logs

  * Make VulkanTexture "immutable".
  * Add some disabled code to submit "init" command buffers separately to the queue for debugging.

- Update to version 1.4.2~git20171029:
  * Share the conversion code between vulkan and D3D, fixing the missing format thing.
  * Color-convert directly during the readback, saves a copy. Like we already do in D3D11.
  * Revert most of the last commit - will do it differently.
  * Use the CPU color conversion from GLES for readbacks in Vulkan (and D3D11). Fix bug.
  * Fix Vulkan framebuffer readbacks, as long as they're in R8G8B8A8.

  * Warning fixes
  * Remove a bad check making us use the wrong way to copy depth buffers.  Add a cap so we can try to unify BlitFramebufferDepth later.

  * Improve synchronization, though there are very weird issues. Possibly need to run the swap chain from the thread that created it?
  * Avoid re-binding pipelines.
  * Let's try a mutex. Doesn't completely solve the problem though..
  * Make sure not to begin and end the init command buffer on different threads.
  * Vulkan: Don't forget to specify stencil load op in render passes
  * This makes a little more sense, but still hangs (frameAvailable = true while stuck on condvar)
  * Synchronization is HARD. need a rethink, methinks.
  * Move the VulkanRenderManager stuff to thin3d, fits in better there.
  * Rendering basics now works.
  * A multitude of fixes. The UI now works correctly, though of course ingame still broken.
