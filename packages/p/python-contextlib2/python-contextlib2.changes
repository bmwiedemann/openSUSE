- Fix source URL.
- Provide python2- package for compatibility with singlespec macros.
- Run unit tests
- Update to version 0.5.5
  * Issue `#13 <https://github.com/jazzband/contextlib2/issues/13>`__:
    ``setup.py`` now falls back to plain ``distutils`` if ``setuptools`` is not
    available (patch by Allan Harwood)
  * Updates to the default compatibility testing matrix:
    * Added: PyPy3, CPython 3.6 (maintenance), CPython 3.7 (development)
    * Dropped: CPython 3.3
- Update to version 0.5.4
  * Thanks to the welcome efforts of Jannis Leidel, contextlib2 is now a
    [Jazzband](https://jazzband.co/) project! This means that I (Nick Coghlan)
    am no longer a single point of failure for backports of future contextlib
    updates to earlier Python versions.
  * Issue `#7 <https://github.com/jazzband/contextlib2/issues/7>`__: Backported
    fix for CPython issue `#27122 <http://bugs.python.org/issue27122>`__,
    preventing a potential infinite loop on Python 3.5 when handling
    ``RuntimeError`` (CPython updates by Gregory P. Smith & Serhiy Storchaka)
- Update to version 0.5.3
  * ``ExitStack`` now correctly handles context managers implemented as old-style
    classes in Python 2.x (such as ``codecs.StreamReader`` and
    ``codecs.StreamWriter``)
  * ``setup.py`` has been migrated to setuptools and configured to emit a
    universal wheel file by default
- Update to version 0.5.2
  * development migrated from BitBucket to GitHub
  * ``redirect_stream``, ``redirect_stdout``, ``redirect_stderr`` and ``suppress``
    now explicitly inherit from ``object``, ensuring compatibility with
    ``ExitStack`` when run under Python 2.x (patch contributed by Devin
    Jeanpierre).
  * ``MANIFEST.in`` is now included in the published sdist, ensuring the archive
    can be precisely recreated even without access to the original source repo
    (patch contributed by Guy Rozendorn)
- Update to version 0.5.1
  * Python 2.6 compatilibity restored (patch contributed by Armin Ronacher)
  * README converted back to reStructured Text formatting
- Update to version 0.5.0
  * Updated to include all features from the Python 3.4 and 3.5 releases of
    contextlib (also includes some ``ExitStack`` enhancements made following
    the integration into the standard library for Python 3.3)
  * The legacy ``ContextStack`` and ``ContextDecorator.refresh_cm`` APIs are
    no longer documented and emit ``DeprecationWarning`` when used
  * Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3 have been dropped from compatibility testing
  * tox is now supported for local version compatibility testing (patch by
    Marc Abramowitz)
