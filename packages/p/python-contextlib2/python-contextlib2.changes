- Update to 21.6.0:
  - License update: due to the inclusion of type hints from the
    typeshed project, the contextlib2 project is now under a
    combination of the Python Software License (existing license)
    and the Apache License 2.0 (typeshed license)
  - Switched to calendar based versioning using a
    “year”-“month”-“serial” scheme, rather than
    continuing with pre-1.0 semantic versioning
  - Due to the inclusion of asynchronous features from Python
    3.7+, the minimum supported Python version is now Python 3.6
    (#29)
  - Synchronised with the Python 3.10 version of contextlib
    (#12), making the following new features available on Python
    3.6+:
      - asyncontextmanager (added in Python 3.7, enhanced in Python 3.10)
      - aclosing (added in Python 3.10)
      - AbstractAsyncContextManager (added in Python 3.7)
      - AsyncContextDecorator (added in Python 3.10)
      - AsyncExitStack (added in Python 3.7)
      - async support in nullcontext (Python 3.10)
  - contextlib2 now includes an adapted copy of the contextlib
    type hints from typeshed (the adaptation removes the Python
    version dependencies from the API definition) (#33)
  - to incorporate the type hints stub file and the py.typed
    marker file, contextlib2 is now installed as a package rather
    than as a module
  - Updates to the default compatibility testing matrix:
      - Added: CPython 3.9, CPython 3.10
      - Dropped: CPython 2.7, CPython 3.5, PyPy2

- Fix source URL.
- Provide python2- package for compatibility with singlespec macros.
- Run unit tests
- Update to version 0.5.5
  * Issue `#13 <https://github.com/jazzband/contextlib2/issues/13>`__:
    ``setup.py`` now falls back to plain ``distutils`` if ``setuptools`` is not
    available (patch by Allan Harwood)
  * Updates to the default compatibility testing matrix:
    * Added: PyPy3, CPython 3.6 (maintenance), CPython 3.7 (development)
    * Dropped: CPython 3.3
- Update to version 0.5.4
  * Thanks to the welcome efforts of Jannis Leidel, contextlib2 is now a
    [Jazzband](https://jazzband.co/) project! This means that I (Nick Coghlan)
    am no longer a single point of failure for backports of future contextlib
    updates to earlier Python versions.
  * Issue `#7 <https://github.com/jazzband/contextlib2/issues/7>`__: Backported
    fix for CPython issue `#27122 <http://bugs.python.org/issue27122>`__,
    preventing a potential infinite loop on Python 3.5 when handling
    ``RuntimeError`` (CPython updates by Gregory P. Smith & Serhiy Storchaka)
- Update to version 0.5.3
  * ``ExitStack`` now correctly handles context managers implemented as old-style
    classes in Python 2.x (such as ``codecs.StreamReader`` and
    ``codecs.StreamWriter``)
  * ``setup.py`` has been migrated to setuptools and configured to emit a
    universal wheel file by default
- Update to version 0.5.2
  * development migrated from BitBucket to GitHub
  * ``redirect_stream``, ``redirect_stdout``, ``redirect_stderr`` and ``suppress``
    now explicitly inherit from ``object``, ensuring compatibility with
    ``ExitStack`` when run under Python 2.x (patch contributed by Devin
    Jeanpierre).
  * ``MANIFEST.in`` is now included in the published sdist, ensuring the archive
    can be precisely recreated even without access to the original source repo
    (patch contributed by Guy Rozendorn)
- Update to version 0.5.1
  * Python 2.6 compatilibity restored (patch contributed by Armin Ronacher)
  * README converted back to reStructured Text formatting
- Update to version 0.5.0
  * Updated to include all features from the Python 3.4 and 3.5 releases of
    contextlib (also includes some ``ExitStack`` enhancements made following
    the integration into the standard library for Python 3.3)
  * The legacy ``ContextStack`` and ``ContextDecorator.refresh_cm`` APIs are
    no longer documented and emit ``DeprecationWarning`` when used
  * Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3 have been dropped from compatibility testing
  * tox is now supported for local version compatibility testing (patch by
    Marc Abramowitz)
