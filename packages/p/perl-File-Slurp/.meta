  <title>Simple and Efficient Reading/Writing of Complete Files</title>
  <description>This module provides subs that allow you to read or write entire files with
one simple call. They are designed to be simple to use, have flexible ways
to pass in or get the file contents and to be very efficient. There is also
a sub to read in all the files in a directory other than '.' and '..'

These slurp/spew subs work for files, pipes and sockets, stdio,
pseudo-files, and the DATA handle. Read more about why slurping files is a
good thing in the file 'slurp_article.pod' in the extras/ directory.

If you are interested in how fast these calls work, check out the
slurp_bench.pl program in the extras/ directory. It compares many different
forms of slurping. You can select the I/O direction, context and file
sizes. Use the --help option to see how to run it.</description>
