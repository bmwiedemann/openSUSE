%description
ProxyChains NG is based on ProxyChains.

ProxyChains NG hooks network-related (TCP only) libc functions in dynamically
linked programs via a preloaded DSO (dynamic shared object) and redirects the
connections through one or more SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies.

Since Proxy Chains NG relies on the dynamic linker, statically linked binaries
are not supported.

Adjust ~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf for your Proxy and use ProxyChains NG
with

    proxychains4 application
