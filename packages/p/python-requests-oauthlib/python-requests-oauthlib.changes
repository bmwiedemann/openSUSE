Mon Mar  2 09:17:37 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.0:
  * Instagram compliance fix
  *  Added ``force_querystring`` argument to fetch_token() method on OAuth2Session

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 17 01:08:23 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Activate test suite, skipping three online tests
- Update to version 1.2.0
  * This project now depends on OAuthlib 3.0.0 and above.
  * Updated oauth2 tests to use 'sess' for an OAuth2Session instance instead
    of auth because OAuth2Session objects and methods acceept an auth
    paramether which is typically an instance of requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth
  * OAuth2Session.fetch_token previously tried to guess how and where to
    provide "client" and "user" credentials incorrectly. This was
    incompatible with some OAuth servers and incompatible with breaking
    changes in oauthlib that seek to correctly provide the client_id.
    The older implementation also did not raise the correct exceptions when
    username and password are not present on Legacy clients.
  * Avoid automatic netrc authentication for OAuth2Session.
- from v1.1.0
  * Adjusted version specifier for oauthlib dependency
  * Dropped dependency on nose.
  * Minor changes to clean up the code and make it more readable/maintainable.
- from v1.0.0
  * Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3.
  * Added several examples to the documentation.
  * Added plentymarkets compliance fix.
  * Added a token property to OAuth1Session, to match the corresponding
    token property on OAuth2Session.
