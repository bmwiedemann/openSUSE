- update to 2.0.0:
  * OAuth2Session now correctly uses the self.verify value if
    verify is not overridden in fetch_token and refresh_token.
    Fixes #404.
  * OAuth2Session constructor now uses its client.scope when a
    client is provided and scope is not overridden. Fixes #408
  * Add refresh_token_request and access_token_request compliance
    hooks
  * Add PKCE support and Auth0 example
  * Add support for Python 3.8-3.12
  * Remove support of Python 2.x, <3.7
  * Migrated to Github Action
  * Updated dependencies
  * Cleanup some docs and examples
  * Version 2.0.0 published initially as 1.4.0, it was yanked
    eventually.
  * Add initial support for OAuth Mutual TLS (draft-ietf-oauth-
    mtls)
  * Removed outdated LinkedIn Compliance Fixes
  * Add eBay compliance fix
  * Add Spotify OAuth 2 Tutorial
  * Add support for python 3.8, 3.9
  * Fixed LinkedIn Compliance Fixes
  * Fixed ReadTheDocs Documentation and sphinx errors
  * Moved pipeline to GitHub Actions
  * Instagram compliance fix
  * Added force_querystring argument to fetch_token() method on
    OAuth2Session
  * This project now depends on OAuthlib 3.0.0 and above. It does
    not support versions of OAuthlib before 3.0.0.
  * Updated oauth2 tests to use 'sess' for an OAuth2Session
    instance instead of auth because OAuth2Session objects and
    methods acceept an auth paramether which is typically an
    instance of requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth
  * OAuth2Session.fetch_token previously tried to guess how and
    where to provide "client" and "user" credentials incorrectly.
    This was incompatible with some OAuth servers and
    incompatible with breaking changes in oauthlib that seek to
    correctly provide the client_id. The older implementation
    also did not raise the correct exceptions when username and
    password are not present on Legacy clients.
  * Avoid automatic netrc authentication for OAuth2Session.
  * Adjusted version specifier for oauthlib dependency: this
    project is not yet compatible with oauthlib 3.0.0.
  * Dropped dependency on nose.
  * Minor changes to clean up the code and make it more
    readable/maintainable.
  * Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3. This project
    now supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.4 and above.
  * Added several examples to the documentation.
  * Added plentymarkets compliance fix.
  * Added a token property to OAuth1Session, to match the
    corresponding token property on OAuth2Session.
  * Added Fitbit compliance fix.
  * Fixed an issue where newlines in the response body for the
    access token request would cause errors when trying to
    extract the token.
  * Fixed an issue introduced in v0.7.0 where users passing auth
    to several methods would encounter conflicts with the
    client_id and client_secret-derived auth. The user-supplied
    auth argument is now used in preference to those options.
  * Allowed OAuth2Session.request to take the client_id and
    client_secret parameters for the purposes of automatic token
    refresh, which may need them.
  * Use client_id and client_secret for the Authorization header
    if provided.
  * Allow explicit bypass of the Authorization header by setting
    auth=False.
  * Pass through the proxies kwarg when refreshing tokens.
  * Miscellaneous cleanups.
  * Fixed a bug when sending authorization in headers with no
    username and password present.
  * Make sure we clear the session token before obtaining a new
    one.
  * Some improvements to the Slack compliance fix.
  * Avoid timing problems around token refresh.
  * Allow passing arbitrary arguments to requests when calling
    fetch_request_token and fetch_access_token.
  * Add compliance fix for Slack.
  * Add compliance fix for Mailchimp.
  * TokenRequestDenied exceptions now carry the entire response,
    not just the status code.
  * Pass through keyword arguments when refreshing tokens
    automatically.
  * Send authorization in headers, not just body, to maximize
    compatibility.
  * More getters/setters available for OAuth2 session client
    values.
  * Allow sending custom headers when refreshing tokens, and set
    some defaults.
  * Fix TypeError being raised instead of TokenMissing error.
  * Raise requests exceptions on 4XX and 5XX responses in the
    OAuth2 flow.
  * Avoid AttributeError when initializing the OAuth2Session
    class without complete client information.
  * New authorized property on OAuth1Session and OAuth2Session,
    which allows you to easily determine if the session is
    already authorized with OAuth tokens or not.
  * New TokenMissing and VerifierMissing exception classes for
    OAuth1Session: this will make it easier to catch and identify
    these exceptions.
  * New install target [rsa] for people using OAuth1 RSA-SHA1
    signature method.
  * Fixed bug in OAuth2 where supplied state param was not used
    in auth url.
  * OAuth2 HTTPS checking can be disabled by setting environment
    variable OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT.
  * OAuth1 now re-authorize upon redirects.
  * OAuth1 token fetching now raise a detailed error message when
    the response body is incorrectly encoded or the request was
    denied.
  * Added support for custom OAuth1 clients.
  * OAuth2 compliance fix for Sina Weibo.
  * Multiple fixes to facebook compliance fix.
  * Compliance fixes now re-encode body properly as bytes in
    Python 3.
  * Logging now properly done under requests_oauthlib namespace
    instead of piggybacking on oauthlib namespace.
  * Logging introduced for OAuth1 auth and session.
  * OAuth1Session methods only return unicode strings. #55.
  * Renamed requests_oauthlib.core to
    requests_oauthlib.oauth1_auth for consistency. #79.
  * Added Facebook compliance fix and access_token_response hook
    to OAuth2Session. #63.
  * Added LinkedIn compliance fix.
  * Added refresh_token_response compliance hook, invoked before
    parsing the refresh token.
  * Correctly limit compliance hooks to running only once!
  * Content type guessing should only be done when no content
    type is given
  * OAuth1 now updates r.headers instead of replacing it with non
    case insensitive dict
  * Remove last use of Response.content (in OAuth1Session). #44.
  * State param can now be supplied in
    OAuth2Session.authorize_url
