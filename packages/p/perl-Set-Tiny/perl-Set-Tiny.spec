%description
Set::Tiny is a thin wrapper around regular Perl hashes to perform often
needed set operations, such as testing two sets of strings for equality, or
checking whether one is contained within the other.

For a more complete implementation of mathematical set theory, see
Set::Scalar. For sets of arbitrary objects, see Set::Object.
