%description
The IP class allows a comfortable parsing and handling for most
notations in use for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and networks. It was
greatly inspired by RIPE's Perl module NET::IP's interface but
doesn't share the implementation. It doesn't share non-CIDR netmasks,
so funky stuff like a netmask of 0xffffff0f can't be done here.
