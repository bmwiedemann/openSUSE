-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 17 18:37:33 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to v2.15.9:
  * Fix false-positive for used-before-assignment in pattern matching with a
    guard.
  * Pylint will no longer deadlock if a parallel job is killed but fail
    immediately instead.
  * When pylint exit due to bad arguments being provided the exit code will
    now be the expected 32.
  * Fixes a ModuleNotFound exception when running pylint on a Django project
    with the pylint_django plugin enabled.
  * Document a known false positive for useless-suppression when disabling
  * line-too-long in a module with only comments and no code.
  * Fix logging-fstring-interpolation false positive raised when logging and
    f-string with %s formatting.
  * Fixes false positive abstract-method on Protocol classes.
  * Fix missing-param-doc false positive when function parameter has an
    escaped underscore.
  * multiple-statements no longer triggers for function stubs using inlined
    ....
  * Fix deprecated-method false positive when alias for method is similar to
  * name of deprecated method.
  * Fix a false positive for used-before-assignment for imports guarded by
  * typing.TYPE_CHECKING later used in variable annotations.
  * Other Bug Fixes
  * Pylint will now filter duplicates given to it before linting. The output
  * should be the same whether a file is given/discovered multiple times or
    not.
  * Fixes a crash in stop-iteration-return when the next builtin is
  * called without arguments.
  * Fix false positive for unhashable-member when subclassing dict and
  * using the subclass as a dictionary key.
  * unnecessary-list-index-lookup will not be wrongly emitted if
  * enumerate is called with start.
  * Don't warn about stop-iteration-return when using next() over
  * itertools.cycle.
  * Messages sent to reporter are now copied so a reporter cannot modify the
  * message sent to other reporters.
  * Fix crash that happened when parsing files with unexpected encoding
    starting with 'utf' like utf13.
  * Fix a crash when a child class with an __init__ method inherits from a
  * parent class with an __init__ class attribute.
  * Fix a false positive for simplify-boolean-expression when multiple
    values are inferred for a constant.
  * Remove __index__ dunder method call from unnecessary-dunder-call
  * Fixed a multi-processing crash that prevents using any more than 1
    thread on MacOS.
  * The returned module objects and errors that were cached by the linter
    plugin loader cannot be reliably pickled. This means that dill would
    throw an error  when attempting to serialise the linter object for
    multi-processing use.
  * Add a keyword-only compare_constants argument to safe_infer.
  * Sort --generated-rcfile output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 27 10:01:43 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 2.15.0
  * In pylint 2.15.0, we added a new check missing-timeout to warn
    of default timeout values that could cause a program to be
    hanging indefinitely.
  * We improved pylint's handling of namespace packages. More
    packages should be linted without resorting to using the
    --recursive=y option.
- Release highlights from 2.14
  * With 2.14 pylint only supports Python version 3.7.2 and above.
  * We introduced several new checks among which duplicate-value
    for sets, comparison-of-constants, and checks related to
    lambdas. We removed no-init and made no-self-use optional as
    they were too opinionated. We also added an option to generate
    a toml configuration: --generate-toml-config.
  * We migrated to argparse from optparse and refactored the
    configuration handling thanks to Daniël van Noord. On the user
    side it should change the output of the --help command, and
    some inconsistencies and bugs should disappear. The behavior
    between options set in a config file versus on the command line
    will be more consistent. For us, it will permit to maintain
    this part of the code easily in the future and anticipate
    optparse's removal in Python 3.12.
  * As a result of the refactor there are a lot of internal
    deprecations. If you're a library maintainer that depends on
    pylint, please verify that you're ready for pylint 3.0 by
    activating deprecation warnings.
  * We continued the integration of pylint-error and are now at
    33%!. We still welcome any community effort to help review,
    integrate, and add good/bad examples
    <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/5953>`_. This should be
    doable without any pylint or astroid knowledge, so this is the
    perfect entrypoint if you want to contribute to pylint or open
    source without any experience with our code!
- Release highlights from 2.13
  * In 2.13, we introduced a new check to deal with unicode
    security issues. On top of that a lot of work was done inside
    the unicode checker by @CarliJoy. We also introduced a new
    check when importing private name and for unnecessary ellipsis
    among other.
  * We fixed long standing issues related to duplicate code that
    could not be disabled, line numbers that were not accurate some
    of the time, and added the ability to lint all files in a
    directory without specifying each one. One of the most
    anticipated issue from the repository. Thank you @matusvalo !
  * A lot of undefined-variables and used-before-assignment issues
    were resolved thanks to @jacobtylerwalls.
  * We started integrating pylint-error the documentation created
    by @vald-phoenix a developer from Hlyniane, Ukraine. We hope
    he's doing well despite the current situation. The deployment
    is set up but there's still a lot to do so we welcome any
    community effort help to review, integrate, and add good/bad
    examples. This should be doable without any pylint or astroid
    knowledge, so this is the perfect entrypoint if you want to
    contribute to pylint without investing any time learning the
    internals.
  * This release is the last one to support interpreter below
    3.7.2, 3.6 end of life was reached in december 2021.
- Add pylint-pr7367-pythonpathtest.patch
  * gh#PyCQA/pylint#7367

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 11 14:54:24 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 2.12.2
  * Fixed a false positive for ``unused-import`` where everything
    was not analyzed properly inside typing guards.
  * Fixed a false-positive regression for
    ``used-before-assignment`` for typed variables in the body of
    class methods that reference the same class
  * Specified that the ``ignore-paths`` option considers "\" to
    represent a windows directory delimiter instead of a regular
    expression escape character.
  * Fixed a crash with the ``ignore-paths`` option when invoking
    the option via the command line.
  * Fixed handling of Sphinx-style parameter docstrings with
    asterisks. These should be escaped with by prepending a "\".
  * Add ``endLine`` and ``endColumn`` keys to output of
    ``JSONReporter``.
  * Fixed handling of Google-style parameter specifications where
    descriptions are on the line following the parameter name.
    These were generating false positives for
    ``missing-param-doc``.
  * Fix false negative for ``consider-iterating-dictionary`` during
    membership checks encapsulated in iterables or ``not in``
    checks
  * ``unused-import`` now check all ancestors for typing guards
- Release notes for 2.12.1
  * Require Python ``3.6.2`` to run pylint.
- Release notes for 2.12.0
  * Upgrade astroid to 2.9.0
  * Add ability to add ``end_line`` and ``end_column`` to the
    ``--msg-template`` option. With the standard ``TextReporter``
    this will add the line and column number of the end of a node
    to the output of Pylint. If these numbers are unknown, they are
    represented by an empty string.
  * Introduced primer tests and a configuration tests framework.
    The helper classes available in ``pylint/testutil/`` are still
    unstable and might be modified in the near future.
  * Fix ``install graphiz`` message which isn't needed for puml
    output format.
  * ``MessageTest`` of the unittest ``testutil`` now requires the
    ``confidence`` attribute to match the expected value. If none
    is provided it is set to ``UNDEFINED``.
  * ``add_message`` of the unittest ``testutil`` now actually
    handles the ``col_offset`` parameter and allows it to be
    checked against actual output in a test.
  * Fix a crash in the ``check_elif`` extensions where an
    undetected if in a comprehension with an if statement within a
    f-string resulted in an out of range error. The checker no
    longer relies on counting if statements anymore and uses known
    if statements locations instead. It should not crash on badly
    parsed if statements anymore.
  * Fix ``simplify-boolean-expression`` when condition can be
    inferred as False.
  * Fix exception when pyreverse parses ``property function`` of a
    class.
  * The functional ``testutils`` now accept ``end_lineno`` and
    ``end_column``. Expected output files without these will
    trigger a ``DeprecationWarning``. Expected output files can be
    easily updated with the ``python tests/test_functional.py
    --update-functional-output`` command.
  * The functional ``testutils`` now correctly check the
    distinction betweeen ``HIGH`` and ``UNDEFINED`` confidence.
    Expected output files without defiend ``confidence`` levels
    will now trigger a ``DeprecationWarning``. Expected output
    files can be easily updated with the ``python
    tests/test_functional.py --update-functional-output`` command.
  * The functional test runner now supports the option
    ``min_pyver_end_position`` to control on which python versions
    the ``end_lineno`` and ``end_column`` attributes should be
    checked. The default value is 3.8.
  * Fix ``accept-no-yields-doc`` and ``accept-no-return-doc`` not
    allowing missing ``yield`` or ``return`` documentation when a
    docstring is partially correct
  * Add an optional extension ``consider-using-any-or-all`` :
    Emitted when a ``for`` loop only produces a boolean and could
    be replaced by ``any`` or ``all`` using a generator. Also
    suggests a suitable any or all statement.
  * Properly identify parameters with no documentation and add new
    message called ``missing-any-param-doc``
  * Add checkers ``overridden-final-method`` &
    ``subclassed-final-class``
  * Fixed ``protected-access`` for accessing of attributes and
    methods of inner classes
  * Added support for ``ModuleNotFoundError`` (``import-error`` and
    ``no-name-in-module``). ``ModuleNotFoundError`` inherits from
    ``ImportError`` and was added in Python ``3.6``
  * ``undefined-variable`` now correctly flags variables which only
    receive a type annotations and never get assigned a value
  * ``undefined-variable`` now correctly considers the line
    numbering and order of classes used in metaclass declarations
  * ``used-before-assignment`` now correctly considers references
    to classes as type annotation or default values in first-level
    methods
  * ``undefined-variable`` and ``unused-variable`` now correctly
    trigger for assignment expressions in functions defaults
  * ``undefined-variable`` now correctly triggers for assignment
    expressions in if ... else statements This includes a basic
    form of control flow inference for if ... else statements using
    constant boolean values
  * Added the ``--enable-all-extensions`` command line option. It
    will load all available extensions which can be listed by
    running ``--list-extensions``
  * Fix bug with importing namespace packages with relative imports
  * Improve and flatten ``unused-wildcard-import`` message
  * In length checker, ``len-as-condition`` has been renamed as
    ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-len`` in order to be consistent
    with ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison``.
  * Created new ``UnsupportedVersionChecker`` checker class that
    includes checks for features not supported by all versions
    indicated by a ``py-version``.
  * Added ``using-f-string-in-unsupported-version`` checker. Issued
    when ``py-version`` is set to a version that does not support
    f-strings (< 3.6)
  * Fix ``useless-super-delegation`` false positive when default
    keyword argument is a variable.
  * Properly emit ``duplicate-key`` when Enum members are duplicate
    dictionary keys
  * Use ``py-version`` setting for alternative union syntax check
    (PEP 604), instead of the Python interpreter version.
  * Subclasses of ``dict`` are regarded as reversible by the
    ``bad-reversed-sequence`` checker (Python 3.8 onwards).
  * Support configuring mixin class pattern via ``mixin-class-rgx``
  * Added new checker ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison``:
    Emitted when collection literal comparison is being used to
    check for emptiness.
  * ``mising-param-doc`` now correctly parses asterisks for
    variable length and keyword parameters
  * ``mising-param-doc`` now correctly handles Numpy parameter
    documentation without explicit typing
  * ``pylint`` no longer crashes when checking assignment
    expressions within if-statements
  * Update ``literal-comparison``` checker to ignore tuple literals
  * Normalize the input to the ``ignore-paths`` option to allow
    both Posix and Windows paths
  * Fix double emitting of ``not-callable`` on inferrable
    ``properties``
  * ``self-cls-assignment`` now also considers tuple assignment
  * Fix ``missing-function-docstring`` not being able to check
    ``__init__`` and other magic methods even if the
    ``no-docstring-rgx`` setting was set to do so
  * Added ``using-final-decorator-in-unsupported-version`` checker.
    Issued when ``py-version`` is set to a version that does not
    support ``typing.final`` (< 3.8)
  * Added configuration option ``exclude-too-few-public-methods``
    to allow excluding classes from the ``min-public-methods``
    checker.
  * The ``--jobs`` parameter now fallbacks to 1 if the host
    operating system does not have functioning shared semaphore
    implementation.
  * Fix crash for ``unused-private-member`` when checking private
    members on ``__class__``
  * Crashes when a list is encountered in a toml configuration do
    not happen anymore.
  * Moved ``misplaced-comparison-constant`` to its own extension
    ``comparison_placement``. This checker was opinionated and now
    no longer a default. It can be reactived by adding
    ``pylint.extensions.comparison_placement`` to ``load-plugins``
    in your config.
  * A new ``bad-configuration-section`` checker was added that will
    emit for misplaced option in pylint's top level namespace for
    toml configuration. Top-level dictionaries or option defined in
    the wrong section will still silently not be taken into
    account, which is tracked in a follow-up issue.
  * Fix crash for ``protected-access`` on (outer) class traversal
  * Added new checker ``useless-with-lock`` to find incorrect usage
    of with statement and threading module locks. Emitted when
    ``with threading.Lock():`` is used instead of ``with
    lock_instance:``.
  * Make yn validator case insensitive, to allow for ``True`` and
    ``False`` in config files.
  * Fix crash on ``open()`` calls when the ``mode`` argument is not
    a simple string.
  * Inheriting from a class that implements ``__class_getitem__``
    no longer raises ``inherit-non-class``.
  * Pyreverse - Add the project root directory to sys.path
  * Don't emit ``consider-using-f-string`` if ``py-version`` is set
    to Python < ``3.6``. ``f-strings`` were added in Python ``3.6``
  * Fix regression for ``unspecified-encoding`` with
    ``pathlib.Path.read_text()``
  * Don't emit ``consider-using-f-string`` if the variables to be
    interpolated include a backslash
  * Fixed false positive for ``cell-var-from-loop`` when variable
    is used as the default value for a keyword-only parameter.
  * Fix false-positive ``undefined-variable`` with ``Lambda``,
    ``IfExp``, and assignment expression.
  * Fix false-positive ``useless-suppression`` for
    ``wrong-import-order``
  * Fixed ``toml`` dependency issue
  * Fix false-positive ``useless-suppression`` for
    ``line-too-long``
  * Fixed ``invalid-name`` not checking parameters of overwritten
    base ``object`` methods
  * Fixed crash in ``consider-using-f-string`` if ``format`` is not
    called
  * Fix crash with ``AssignAttr`` in ``if TYPE_CHECKING`` blocks.
  * Improve node information for ``invalid-name`` on function
    argument.
  * Prevent return type checkers being called on functions with
    ellipses as body

    from astroid to ``pylint.checkers.utils``.
  * Fix regression on ClassDef inference
  * Fix regression on Compare node inference
  * Fix false-positive
    ``isinstance-second-argument-not-valid-type`` with
    ``typing.Callable``.
  * It is now recommended to do ``pylint`` development on
    ``Python`` 3.8 or higher. This allows using the latest ``ast``
    parser.
  * All standard jobs in the ``pylint`` CI now run on ``Python``
    3.8 by default. We still support python 3.6 and 3.7 and run
    tests for those interpreters.
  * ``TypingChecker``
    * Fix false-negative for ``deprecated-typing-alias`` and
      ``consider-using-alias`` with ``typing.Type`` +
      ``typing.Callable``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  3 17:04:18 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.11.1
  * ``unspecified-encoding`` now checks the encoding of 
    ``pathlib.Path()`` correctly 
  * The python3 porting mode checker and it's ``py3k`` option were 
    removed. You can still find it in older pylints  versions.

    string
  * Added new extension ``SetMembershipChecker`` with
    ``use-set-for-membership`` check: Emitted when using an 
    in-place defined ``list`` or ``tuple`` to do a membership 
    test. ``sets`` are better optimized for that.
  * Added ``py-version`` config key (if ``[MASTER]`` section). Used
    for version dependant checks.
    Will default to whatever Python version pylint is executed
    with.
  * ``CodeStyleChecker``  
    Added ``consider-using-assignment-expr``: Emitted when an
    assignment is directly followed by an if statement and both can
    be combined by using an assignment expression ``:=``. Requires
    Python 3.8
  * Added ``consider-using-f-string``: Emitted when .format() or '%'
    is being used to format a string.
  * Fix false positive for ``consider-using-with`` if a context
    manager is assigned to a variable in different paths of control
    flow (e. g. if-else clause).  
  * https is now prefered in the documentation and
    http://pylint.pycqa.org correctly redirect to
    https://pylint.pycqa.org
  * Fix false positive for ``function-redefined`` for simple type
    annotations
  * Fix false positive for ``protected-access`` if a protected 
    member is used in type hints of function definitions
  * Fix false positive ``dict-iter-missing-items`` for dictionaries 
    only using tuples as keys
  * The ``unspecified-encoding`` checker now also checks calls to 
    ``pathlib.Path().read_text()`` and
    ``pathlib.Path().write_text()``

    access.
  * Setting ``min-similarity-lines`` to 0 now makes the similarty 
    checker stop checking for duplicate code
  * Fix a bug where pylint complained if the cache's parent 
    directory does not exist
  * The ``global-variable-not-assigned`` checker now catches global 
    variables that are never reassigned in a
    local scope and catches (reassigned) functions
  * Fix false positives for invalid-all-format that are lists or 
    tuples at runtime
  * Fix ``no-self-use`` and ``docparams extension`` for async 
    functions and methods.
  * Add documentation for ``pyreverse`` and ``symilar``

    considers membership checks
  * The ``invalid-name`` message is now more detailed when using 
    multiple naming style regexes.
- Release 2.10.2
  * We now use platformdirs instead of appdirs since the latter is 
    not maintained.

  * pyreverse: add option to produce colored output.
  * pyreverse: add output in PlantUML format.
  * ``consider-using-with`` is no longer triggered if a context 
    manager is returned from a function.
  * pylint does not crash with a traceback anymore when a file is 
    problematic. It creates a template text file for opening an 
    issue on the bug tracker instead.
    The linting can go on for other non problematic files instead 
    of being impossible.
  * pyreverse: Show class has-a relationships inferred from the 
    type-hint
  * Fixed a crash when importing beyond the top level package 
    during ``import-error`` message creation
  * Added ``ignored-parents`` option to the design checker to

    Emitted whenever a variable is assigned in both branches of an 
    if/else block.
  * Added optional extension ``while-used``: Emitted whenever a 
    ``while`` loop is used.
  * Added ``forgotten-debug-statement``: Emitted when 
    ``breakpoint``, ``pdb.set_trace`` or ``sys.breakpointhook`` 
    calls are found
  * Fix false-positive of ``unused-private-member`` when using 
    nested functions in a class

    nested attributes.
  * Fix a false positive for ``unused-private-member`` with class 
    names
  * Fix false positives for ``superfluous-parens`` with walrus 
    operator, ternary operator and inside list comprehension.
  * Added ``format-string-without-interpolation`` checker: Emitted 
    when formatting is applied to a string without any variables to 
    be replaced
  * Refactor of ``--list-msgs`` & ``--list-msgs-enabled``: both 
    options now show whether messages are emittable with the 
    current interpreter.
  * Fix false negative for ``used-before-assignment`` when the 
    variable is assigned in an exception handler, but used outside 
    of the handler.
  * Added ``disable-next`` option: allows using `# pylint: 
    disable-next=msgid` to disable a message for the following line
  * Added ``redundant-u-string-prefix`` checker: Emitted when the u 
    prefix is added to a string
  * Fixed ``cell-var-from-loop`` checker: handle cell variables in 
    comprehensions within functions, and function default argument 
    expressions. Also handle basic variable shadowing.
  * Fixed bug with ``cell-var-from-loop`` checker: it no longer has 
    false negatives when both ``unused-variable`` and 
    ``used-before-assignment`` are disabled.
  * Fix false postive for ``invalid-all-format`` if the list or 
    tuple builtin functions are used
  * Config files can now contain environment variables
  * Fix false-positive ``used-before-assignment`` with an 
    assignment expression in a ``Return`` node

    * Limit ``consider-using-tuple`` to be emitted only for 
    in-place defined ``lists``.
    * Emit ``consider-using-tuple`` even if list contains a 
    ``starred`` expression.

    functions' with similarities "ignore-signatures" option enabled
  * Improve performance when inferring ``Call`` nodes, by utilizing 
    caching.
  * Improve error message for invalid-metaclass when the node is an 
    Instance.

Fri Aug 20 19:24:31 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Unskip the numpy inference tests. Note: always check with a clean
  environment (osc build --clean) -- gh#PyCQA/pylint#4877

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 20 10:03:42 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.9.6
  * Fix a false positive undefined-variable when variable name in
    decoration matches function argument
- Many more release notes from 2.9.0 to 2.9.5:
  * https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/releases
  * Added time.clock to deprecated functions/methods for python 3.3
  * No longer emit consider-using-with for ThreadPoolExecutor and
    ProcessPoolExecutor as they have legitimate use cases without a
    with block.
  * The similarity checker no longer add three trailing whitespaces
    for empty lines in its report.
  * Python 3.10 is now supported.
  * Added various deprecated functions/methods for python 3.10,
    3.7, 3.6 and 3.3
  * setuptools_scm has been removed and replaced by tbump in order
    to not have hidden runtime dependencies to setuptools
- Drop pylint-pr4450-import-init.patch
- Add pylint-pr4816-astroid27.patch
  * gh#PyCQA/pylint#4816
  * remove astroid upper bound -- the previous pin broke a lot of
    packages through the pkg_resources check

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  6 12:04:43 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.8.3:
  * pin astroid to 2.5.6 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 14:41:41 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.8.2
  * Keep ``__pkginfo__.numversion`` a tuple to avoid breaking 
    pylint-django.
  * scm_setuptools has been added to the packaging.
  * Pylint's tags are now the standard form ``vX.Y.Z`` and not
    ``pylint-X.Y.Z`` anymore.
  * New warning message ``deprecated-class``. This message is
    emitted if import or call deprecated class of the standard
    library (like ``collections.Iterable`` that will be removed 
    Python 3.10).
  * Add numversion back (temporarily) in __pkginfo__ because it 
    broke Pylama and revert the unnecessary pylint.version   
    beaking change.
- Release 2.8.0
  * New refactoring message ``consider-using-with``. This message
    is emitted if resource-allocating functions or methods of the
    standard library (like ``open()`` or
    ``threading.Lock.acquire()  ``) that can be used as a context
    manager are called without a ``with`` block.
  * Resolve false positives on unused variables in decorator
    functions
  * Add new extension ``ConfusingConsecutiveElifChecker``. This
    optional checker emits a refactoring message (R5601
    ``confusing-consecutive-elif``) if if/elif statements with 
    different indentation levels follow   directly one after the
    other.  
  * New option ``--output=<file>`` to output result to a file 
    rather   than printing to stdout.
  * Use a prescriptive message for ``unidiomatic-typecheck``
  * Apply ``const-naming-style`` to module constants annotated with
    ``typing.Final``
  * The packaging is now done via setuptools exclusively. 
    ``doc``,   ``tests``, ``man``, ``elisp`` and ``Changelog`` are
    not packaged anymore - reducing the size of the package by 75%.
  * Debian packaging is now  (officially) done in https://salsa.  
    debian.org/python-team/packages/pylint.
  * The 'doc' extra-require has been removed.
  * ``__pkginfo__`` now only contain ``__version__`` (also   
    accessible with ``pylint.__version__``), other 
    meta-information   are still
    accessible with ``from importlib import metadata;metadata.  
    metadata('pylint')``.
  * COPYING has been renamed to LICENSE for standardization.
  * Fix false-positive ``used-before-assignment`` in function   
    returns.
  * Updated ``astroid`` to 2.5.3
  * Add ``consider-using-min-max-builtin`` check for if 
    statement   which could be replaced by Python builtin min or 
    max
  * Don't auto-enable postponed evaluation of type annotations 
    with Python 3.10
  * Update ``astroid`` to 2.5.4
  * Add new extension ``TypingChecker``. This optional checker 
    can   detect the use of deprecated typing aliases
    and can suggest the use of the alternative union syntax 
    where   possible.
    (For example, 'typing.Dict' can be replaced by 'dict', and   
    'typing.Unions' by '|', etc.)
    Make sure to check the config options if you plan on using it!
  * Reactivates old counts in report mode.
  * During detection of ``inconsistent-return-statements`` 
    consider   that ``assert False`` is a return node.
  * Run will not fail if score exactly equals ``config.
    fail_under``.
  * Functions that never returns may declare ``NoReturn`` as
    type hints, so that
    ``inconsistent-return-statements`` is not emitted.
  * Improved protected access checks to allow access inside 
    class   methods
  * Fix issue with PEP 585 syntax and the use of ``collections.
    abc.  Set``
  * Fix issue that caused class variables annotated with 
    ``typing.  ClassVar`` to be  
    identified as class constants. Now, class variables nnotated   
    with ``typing.Final`` are identified as such.
  * Continuous integration with read the doc has been added.
  * Don't show ``DuplicateBasesError`` for attribute access
  * Fix crash when checking ``setup.cfg`` for pylint config when   
    there are non-ascii characters in there 
  * Allow code flanked in backticks to be skipped by spellchecker
  * Allow Python tool directives (for black, flake8, zimports,   
    isort, mypy, bandit, pycharm) at beginning of comments to be   
    skipped by spellchecker
  * Fix issue that caused emacs pylint to fail when used with tramp
  * Improve check for invalid PEP 585 syntax inside functions
    if postponed evaluation of type annotations is enabled
    * Improve check for invalid PEP 585 syntax as default
      function arguments
- Release 2.7.4
  * Fix a problem with disabled msgid not being ignored
  * Fix issue with annotated class constants
- Release 2.7.3
  * Introduce logic for checking deprecated attributes in   
    DeprecationMixin.
  * Reduce usage of blacklist/whitelist terminology. Notably,   
    ``extension-pkg-allow-list`` is an alternative to
    ``extension-pkg-whitelist`` and the message
    ``blacklisted-name`` is now emitted as
    ``disallowed-name``. The previous names are accepted to
    maintain   backward compatibility.
  * Move deprecated checker to ``DeprecatedMixin``
  * Bump ``astroid`` version to ``2.5.2``
  * Fix false positive for ``method-hidden`` when using private   
    attribute and method
  * ``use-symbolic-message-instead`` now also works on legacy   
    messages like ``C0111`` (``missing-docstring``).
  * Remove unwanted print to stdout from ``_emit_no_member``
  * Introduce a command-line option to specify pyreverse output
    directory
  * Fix issue with Enums and
    ``class-attribute-naming-style=snake_case``
  * Add ``allowed-redefined-builtins`` option for fine tuning 
    ``redefined-builtin`` check.
  * Fix issue when executing with ``python -m pylint``
  * Exempt ``typing.TypedDict`` from ``too-few-public-methods``
    check.
  * Fix false-positive ``no-member`` for typed annotations without
    default value.
  * Add ``--class-const-naming-style`` for Enum constants and
    class variables annotated with ``typing.ClassVar``
   * Fix astroid.Inference error for undefined-variables with
    ``len()```
  * Fix column index on FIXME warning messages
  * Improve handling of assignment expressions, better edge case
    handling
  * Improve check if class is subscriptable PEP585
  * Fix documentation and filename handling of --import-graph
  * Fix false-positive for ``unused-import`` on class keyword
    arguments
  * Fix regression with plugins on PYTHONPATH if latter is cwd

    ``contextlib.asynccontextmanager`` is used
  * Fix linter multiprocessing pool shutdown (triggered warnings
    when runned in parallels with other pytest plugins)

    (`Protocol[T]`)
  * Fix bug that lead to duplicate messages when using
    ``--jobs 2`` or more.
  * Adds option ``check-protected-access-in-special-methods`` in
    the ClassChecker to activate/deactivate
    ``protected-access`` message emission for single underscore
      prefixed attribute in special methods.
  * Fix vulnerable regular expressions in ``pyreverse``
  * ``inconsistent-return-statements`` message is now emitted if
    one of ``try/except`` statement is not returning explicitly
    while the other do.
  * Fix ``useless-super-delegation`` false positive when default
    keyword argument is a dictionnary.
  * Fix a crash when a specified config file does not exist
  * Add support to ``ignored-argument-names`` in
    DocstringParameterChecker and adds ``useless-param-doc`` and
    ``useless-type-doc`` messages.
  * Enforce docparams consistently when docstring is not present
  * Fix ``duplicate-code`` false positive when lines only contain
    whitespace and non-alphanumeric characters (e.g. parentheses,

    like range or list/dict/set comprehension. This should reduce
    the false positives for other classes, like pandas's DataFrame
    or numpy's Array.
  * Fixes duplicate-errors not working with -j2+
  * ``generated-members`` now matches the qualified name of members
  * Add check for bool function to ``len-as-condition``
  * Add ``simplifiable-condition`` check for extraneous constants

  * Add ``condition-evals-to-constant`` check for conditionals
    using and/or that evaluate to a constant.
  * Changed setup.py to work with distlib
  * New check: ``consider-using-generator``
    This check warns when a comprehension is used inside an
    ``any`` or ``all`` function, since it is unnecessary and
    should be replaced by a generator instead. Using a generator
    would be less code and way faster.   
  * Add Github Actions to replace Travis and AppVeyor in the 
    future

    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3590
- Changelog from 2.5.1
  * Fix a crash in `method-hidden` lookup for unknown base classes
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3527

  * Do not allow ``python -m pylint ...`` to import user code
    ``python -m pylint ...`` adds the current working directory as the first element
    of ``sys.path``. This opens up a potential security hole where ``pylint`` will import
    user level code as long as that code resides in modules having the same name as stdlib
    or pylint's own modules.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3386
  * Add `dummy-variables-rgx` option for `_redeclared-assigned-name` check.

  * Added errors for protocol functions when invalid return types are detected.
    E0304 (invalid-bool-returned): __bool__ did not return a bool
    E0305 (invalid-index-returned): __index__ did not return an integer
    E0306 (invalid-repr-returned): __repr__ did not return a string
    E0307 (invalid-str-returned): __str__ did not return a string

    E0310 (invalid-length-hint-returned): __length_hint__ did not return a non-negative integer
    E0311 (invalid-format-returned): __format__ did not return a string
    E0312 (invalid-getnewargs-returned): __getnewargs__ did not return a tuple
    E0313 (invalid-getnewargs-ex-returned): __getnewargs_ex__ did not return a tuple of the form (tuple, dict)
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#560
  * ``missing-*-docstring`` can look for ``__doc__`` assignments.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3301
  * ``undefined-variable`` can now find undefined loop iterables
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#498
  * ``safe_infer`` can infer a value as long as all the paths share the same type.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#2503   
  * Add a --fail-under <score> flag, also configurable in a .pylintrc file. If 
    the final score is more than the specified score, it's considered a success 
    and pylint exits with exitcode 0. Otherwise, it's considered a failure and 
    pylint exits with its current exitcode based on the messages issued.  
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#2242
  * Don't emit ``line-too-long`` for multilines when `disable=line-too-long` comment stands at their end
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#2957
  * Fixed an ``AttributeError`` caused by improper handling of ``dataclasses`` inference in ``pyreverse``
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3256
  * Do not exempt bare except from ``undefined-variable`` and similar checks
    If a node was wrapped in a ``TryExcept``, ``pylint`` was taking a hint
    from the except handler when deciding to emit or not a message.
    We were treating bare except as a fully fledged ignore but only
    the corresponding exceptions should be handled that way (e.g. ``NameError`` or ``ImportError``)
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3235
  * No longer emit ``assignment-from-no-return`` when a function only raises an exception
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3218
  * Allow import aliases to exempt ``import-error`` when used in type annotations.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3178
  * ``Ellipsis` is exempted from ``multiple-statements`` for function overloads.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3224
  * No longer emit ``invalid-name`` for non-constants found at module level.
    Pylint was taking the following statement from PEP-8 too far, considering
    all module level variables as constants, which is not what the statement is saying:
    `Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in
    all capital letters with underscores separating words.`
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3111, gh#PyCQA/pylint#3132
  * Allow ``implicit-str-concat-in-sequence`` to be emitted for string juxtaposition
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3030
  * ``implicit-str-concat-in-sequence`` was renamed ``implicit-str-concat``
  * The ``json`` reporter no longer bypasses ``redirect_stdout``. Close #3227
  * Move ``NoFileError``, ``OutputLine``, ``FunctionalTestReporter``,
    ``FunctionalTestFile``, ``LintModuleTest`` and related methods from
    ``test_functional.py`` to ``pylint.testutils`` to help testing for 3rd
    party pylint plugins.
  * Can read config from a setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#617
  * Fix exception-escape false positive with generators

    Closes gh#PyCQA/pylint#2729
  * Allow parallel linting when run under Prospector
  * Fixed false positives of ``method-hidden`` when a subclass defines the method that is being hidden.
    Closes gh#PyCQA/pylint#414
  * Python 3 porting mode is 30-50% faster on most codebases
  * Python 3 porting mode no longer swallows syntax errors
    Closes gh#PyCQA/pylint#2956
  * Pass the actual PyLinter object to sub processes to allow using custom
    PyLinter classes.
    PyLinter object (and all its members except reporter) needs to support
    pickling so the PyLinter object can be passed to worker processes.
  * Clean up setup.py
    Make pytest-runner a requirement only if running tests, similar to McCabe.
    Clean up the setup.py file, resolving a number of warnings around it.
  * Handle SyntaxError in files passed via ``--from-stdin`` option
    Pylint no longer outputs a traceback, if a file, read from stdin,
    contains a syntaxerror.
  * Fix uppercase style to disallow 3+ uppercase followed by lowercase.

  * Emit ``unused-argument`` for functions that partially uses their argument list before raising an exception.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3246
  * Fixed ``broad_try_clause`` extension to check try/finally statements and to
    check for nested statements (e.g., inside of an ``if`` statement).
  * Recognize classes explicitly inheriting from ``abc.ABC`` or having an
    ``abc.ABCMeta`` metaclass as abstract. This makes them not trigger W0223.
    Closes gh#PyCQA/pylint#3098
  * Fix overzealous `arguments-differ` when overridden function uses variadics
    No message is emitted if the overriding function provides positional or
    keyword variadics in its signature that can feasibly accept and pass on
    all parameters given by the overridden function.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#1482, gh#PyCQA/pylint#1553
  * Multiple types of string formatting are allowed in logging functions.
    The `logging-fstring-interpolation` message has been brought back to allow
    multiple types of string formatting to be used.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3361

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  7 21:44:44 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 1.5.5:
  * Let visit_importfrom from Python 3 porting checker be called when everything is disabled
    Because the visit method was filtering the patterns it was expecting to be activated,
    it didn't run when everything but one pattern was disabled, leading to spurious false 
    positives
  * Don't emit unsubscriptable-value for classes with unknown
    base classes.
  * Use an OrderedDict for storing the configuration elements
    This fixes an issue related to impredictible order of the disable / enable
    elements from a config file. In certain cases, the disable was coming before
    the enable which resulted in classes of errors to be enabled, even though the intention
    was to disable them. The best example for this was in the context of running multiple
    processes, each one of it having different enables / disables that affected the output.
  * Don't consider bare and broad except handlers as ignoring NameError,
    AttributeError and similar exceptions, in the context of checkers for
    these issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 08:25:01 UTC 2016 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Update to version 1.5.4
  * Merge StringMethodChecker with StringFormatChecker. This fixes a
    bug where disabling all the messages and enabling only a handful of
    messages from the StringFormatChecker would have resulted in no
    messages at all.
  * Don't apply unneeded-not over sets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 13 10:15:52 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.5.3:
  * Handle the import fallback idiom with regard to wrong-import-order.
    Closes issue #750.
  * Decouple the displaying of reports from the displaying of messages
    Some reporters are aggregating the messages instead of displaying
    them when they are available. The actual displaying was conflatted
    in the generate_reports. Unfortunately this behaviour was flaky
    and in the case of the JSON reporter, the messages weren't shown
    at all if a file had syntax errors or if it was missing.
    In order to fix this, the aggregated messages can now be
    displayed with Reporter.display_message, while the reports are
    displayed with display_reports.
    Closes issues #766 and #765.
  * Ignore function calls with variadic arguments without a context.
    Inferring variadic positional arguments and keyword arguments
    will result into empty Tuples and Dicts, which can lead in
    some cases to false positives with regard to no-value-for-parameter.
    In order to avoid this, until we'll have support for call context
    propagation, we're ignoring such cases if detected.
    Closes issue #722.
  * Treat AsyncFunctionDef just like FunctionDef nodes,
    by implementing visit_asyncfunctiondef in terms of
    visit_functiondef.
    Closes issue #767.
  * Take in account kwonlyargs when verifying that arguments
    are defined with the check_docs extension.
    Closes issue #745.
  * Suppress reporting 'unneeded-not' inside `__ne__` methods
    Closes issue #749.
- update to version 1.5.2:
  * Don't crash if graphviz is not installed, instead emit a warning
    letting the user to know.  Closes issue #168.
  * Accept only functions and methods for the deprecated-method
    checker.  This prevents a crash which can occur when an object
    doesn't have .qname() method after the inference.
  * Don't emit super-on-old-class on classes with unknown bases.
    Closes issue #721.
  * Allow statements in `if` or `try` blocks containing imports.
    Closes issue #714.
- update to version 1.5.1:
  * Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered
    in plugin modules. Closes issue #711.
  * Add wrong-import-position to check_messages's decorator arguments
    for ImportChecker.leave_module This fixes an esoteric bug which
    occurs when ungrouped-imports and wrong-import-order are disabled
    and pylint is executed on multiple files.  What happens is that
    without wrong-import-position in check_messages, leave_module will
    never be called, which means that the first non-import node from
    other files might leak into the current file, leading to
    wrong-import-position being emitted by pylint.
  * Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered
    in plugin modules. Closes issue #711.
  * Don't emit import-self and cyclic-import for relative imports of
    modules with the same name as the package itself.  Closes issues
    #708 and #706.
- update to version 1.5.0:
  * long list of changes, see Changelog file for details

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  2 14:16:15 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.4:
    * Avoid breaking pylint when using logilab.common >= 1.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 16 12:22:48 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.3:
    * Remove three warnings: star-args, abstract-class-little-used,
      abstract-class-not-used. These warnings don't add any real value
      and they don't imply errors or problems in the code.
    * Added a new option for controlling the peephole optimizer in astroid.
      The option ``--optimize-ast`` will control the peephole optimizer,
      which is used to optimize a couple of AST subtrees. The current problem
      solved by the peephole optimizer is when multiple joined strings,
      with the addition operator, are encountered. If the numbers of such
      strings is high enough, Pylint will then fail with a maximum recursion
      depth exceeded error, due to its visitor architecture. The peephole
      just transforms such calls, if it can, into the final resulting string
      and this exhibit a problem, because the visit_binop method stops being
      called (in the optimized AST it will be a Const node).           

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 12 09:20:31 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.2:
    * Don't require a docstring for empty modules. Closes issue #261.
    * Fix a false positive with `too-few-format-args` string warning,
      emitted when the string format contained a normal positional
      argument ('{0}'), mixed with a positional argument which did
      an attribute access ('{0.__class__}').
      Closes issue #463.
    * Take in account all the methods from the ancestors
      when checking for too-few-public-methods. Closes issue #471.
    * Catch enchant errors and emit 'invalid-characters-in-docstring'
      when checking for spelling errors. Closes issue #469.
    * Use all the inferred statements for the super-init-not-called
      check. Closes issue #389.
    * Add a new warning, 'unichr-builtin', emitted by the Python 3
      porting checker, when the unichr builtin is found. Closes issue #472.
    * Add a new warning, 'intern-builtin', emitted by the Python 3
      porting checker, when the intern builtin is found. Closes issue #473.
    * Add support for editable installations.
    * The HTML output accepts the `--msg-template` option. Patch by
      Dan Goldsmith.
    * Add 'map-builtin-not-iterating' (replacing 'implicit-map-evaluation'),
      'zip-builtin-not-iterating', 'range-builtin-not-iterating', and
      'filter-builtin-not-iterating' which are emitted by `--py3k` when the
      appropriate built-in is not used in an iterating context (semantics
      taken from 2to3).
    * Add a new warning, 'unidiomatic-typecheck', emitted when an explicit
      typecheck uses type() instead of isinstance(). For example,
      `type(x) == Y` instead of `isinstance(x, Y)`. Patch by Chris Rebert.
      Closes issue #299.
    * Add support for combining the Python 3 checker mode with the --jobs
      flag (--py3k and --jobs). Closes issue #467.
    * Add a new warning for the Python 3 porting checker, 'using-cmp-argument',
      emitted when the `cmp` argument for the `list.sort` or `sorted builtin`
      is encountered.
    * Make the --py3k flag commutative with the -E flag. Also, this patch
      fixes the leaks of error messages from the Python 3 checker when
      the errors mode was activated. Closes issue #437.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 18 12:11:39 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.1:
    * Look only in the current function's scope for bad-super-call.
      Closes issue #403.
    * Check the return of properties when checking for not-callable.
      Closes issue #406.
    * Warn about using the input() or round() built-ins for Python 3.
      Closes issue #411.
    * Proper abstract method lookup while checking for
      abstract-class-instantiated. Closes issue #401.
    * Use a mro traversal for finding abstract methods. Closes issue #415.
    * Fix a false positive with catching-non-exception and tuples of
      exceptions.
    * Fix a false negative with raising-non-exception, when the raise used
      an uninferrable exception context.
    * Fix a false positive on Python 2 for raising-bad-type, when
      raising tuples in the form 'raise (ZeroDivisionError, None)'.
    * Fix a false positive with invalid-slots-objects, where the slot entry
      was an unicode string on Python 2. Closes issue #421.
    * Add a new warning, 'redundant-unittest-assert', emitted when using
      unittest's methods assertTrue and assertFalse with constant value
      as argument. Patch by Vlad Temian.
    * Add a new JSON reporter, usable through -f flag.
    * Add the method names for the 'signature-differs' and 'argument-differs'
      warnings. Closes issue #433.
    * Don't compile test files when installing.
    * Fix a crash which occurred when using multiple jobs and the files
      given as argument didn't exist at all.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  8 10:06:19 UTC 2014 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.0:
    * Added new options for controlling the loading of C extensions.
      By default, only C extensions from the stdlib will be loaded
      into the active Python interpreter for inspection, because they
      can run arbitrary code on import. The option 
      `--extension-pkg-whitelist` can be used to specify modules
      or packages that are safe to load.
    * Change default max-line-length to 100 rather than 80
    * Drop BaseRawChecker class which were only there for backward
      compat for a while now
    * Don't try to analyze string formatting with objects coming from
      function arguments. Closes issue #373.
    * Port source code to be Python 2/3 compatible. This drops the
      need for 2to3, but does drop support for Python 2.5.
    * Each message now comes with a confidence level attached, and
      can be filtered base on this level. This allows to filter out
      all messages that were emitted even though an inference failure
      happened during checking.
    * Improved presenting unused-import message. Closes issue #293.
    * Add new checker for finding spelling errors. New messages:
      wrong-spelling-in-comment, wrong-spelling-in-docstring.
      New options: spelling-dict, spelling-ignore-words.
    * Add new '-j' option for running checks in sub-processes.
    * Added new checks for line endings if they are mixed (LF vs CRLF)
      or if they are not as expected. New messages: mixed-line-endings,
      unexpected-line-ending-format. New option: expected-line-ending-format.
    * 'dangerous-default-value' no longer evaluates the value of the arguments,
      which could result in long error messages or sensitive data being leaked.
      Closes issue #282
    * Fix a false positive with string formatting checker, when
      encountering a string which uses only position-based arguments.
      Closes issue #285.
    * Fix a false positive with string formatting checker, when using
      keyword argument packing. Closes issue #288.
    * Proper handle class level scope for lambdas.
    * Handle 'too-few-format-args' or 'too-many-format-args' for format
      strings with both named and positional fields. Closes issue #286.

    * Properly handle nested format string fields. Closes issue #294.
    * Properly handle unicode format strings for Python 2.
      Closes issue #296.
    * Fix a false positive with 'too-few-format-args', when the format
      strings contains duplicate manual position arguments.
      Closes issue #310.
    * fixme regex handles comments without spaces after the hash.
      Closes issue #311.
    * Fix a crash encountered when looking for attribute docstrings.
    * Fix a crash which ocurred while checking for 'method-hidden',

      Closes issue #233.
    * Return new astroid class nodes when the inferencer can detect that
      that result of a function invocation on a type (like `type` or 
      `abc.ABCMeta`) is requested. Closes #205.
    * Emit 'undefined-variable' for undefined names when using the
      Python 3 `metaclass=` argument.
    * Checkers respect priority now. Close issue #229.
    * Fix a false positive regarding W0511. Closes issue #149.
    * Fix unused-import false positive with Python 3 metaclasses (#143).
    * Don't warn with 'bad-format-character' when encountering
      the 'a' format on Python 3.
    * Add multiple checks for PEP 3101 advanced string formatting:
     'bad-format-string', 'missing-format-argument-key',
     'unused-format-string-argument', 'format-combined-specification',
     'missing-format-attribute' and 'invalid-format-index'.
    * Issue broad-except and bare-except even if the number
      of except handlers is different than 1. Fixes issue #113.
    * Issue attribute-defined-outside-init for all cases, not just
      for the last assignment. Closes issue #262.

Tue Sep 26 14:51:57 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- fix build with python 2.5
- update to version 0.12.0
  * usability changes:
    o parseable, html and color options are now handled by a single
      output-format option
    o enable-<checkerid> and disable-all options are now handled by
      two (exclusive) enable-checker and disable-checker options
      taking a comma separated list of checker names as value
    o renamed debug-mode option to errors-only
  * started a reference user manual
  * new W0212 message for access to protected member from client code
  * new W0105 and W0106 messages extracted from W0104 (statement seems to
    have no effect) respectivly when the statement is actually string
    (that's sometimes used instead of comments for documentation) or an
    empty statement generated by a useless semicolumn
  * reclassified W0302 to C0302
  * fix so that global messages are not anymore connected to the last
    analyzed module
  * fix some bugs related to local disabling of messages
  * fix cr/lf pb when generating the rc file on windows platforms
- changes from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0
  * fix crash caused by the exceptions checker in some case
  * fix some E1101 false positive with abstract method or classes defining
    __getattr__
  * dirty fix to avoid "_socketobject" has not "connect" member. The actual
    problem is that astng isn't able to understand the code used to create
    socket.socket object with exec
  * added an option in the similarity checker to ignore docstrings, enabled
    by default
  * included patch from Benjamin Niemann to allow block level
    enabling/disabling of messages
- changes from 0.9.0 to 0.10.0
  * WARNING, this release include some configuration changes (see below), so
    you may have to check and update your own configuration file(s) if you
    use one
  * this release require the 0.15 version of astng or superior (it will save
    you a lot of pylint crashes...)
  * W0705 has been reclassified to E0701, and is now detecting more
    inheriting problem, and a false positive when empty except clause is
    following an Exception catch has been fixed
  * E0212 and E0214 (metaclass/class method should have mcs/cls as first
    argument have been reclassified to C0202 and C0203 since this not as
    well established as "self" for instance method (E0213)
  * W0224 has been reclassified into F0220 (failed to resolve interfaces
    implemented by a class)
  * a new typecheck checker, introducing the following checks:
    o E1101, access to unexistant member (implements #10430), remove the
      need of E0201 and so some options has been moved from the classes
      checker to this one
    o E1102, calling a non callable object
    o E1111 and W1111 when an assigment is done on a function call but the
      infered function returns None (implements #10431)
  * change in the base checker:
    o checks module level and instance attribute names (new const-rgx
      and attr-rgx configuration option)
    o list comprehension and generator expression variables have their
      own regular expression  (the inlinevar-rgx option)
    o the C0101 check with its min-name-lentgh option has
      been removed (this can be specified in the regxp after all...)
    o W0103 and W0121 are now handled by the variables checker
      (W0103 is now W0603 and W0604 has been splitted into different messages)
    o W0131 and W0132 messages  have been reclassified to C0111 and
      C0112 respectivly
    o new W0104 message on statement without effect
  * regexp support for dummy-variables (dummy-variables-rgx option
    replace dummy-variables)
  * better global statement handling, see W0602, W0603, W0604 messages
  * --debug-mode option, disabling all checkers without error message
    and filtering others to only display error
  * fixed some R0201 (method could be a function) false positive
