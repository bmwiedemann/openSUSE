- Update to 2.5.3
  * Fix a regression where disable comments that have checker names with numbers in them are not parsed correctly
    Close #3666
  * `property-with-parameters` properly handles abstract properties
    Close #3600

    Close #3612
  * Fix a regression where messages with dash are not fully parsed
    Close #3604
  * In a TOML configuration file, it's now possible to use rich (non-string) types, such as list, integer or boolean instead of strings. For example, one can now define a *list* of message identifiers to enable like this::
      enable = [
          "use-symbolic-message-instead",
          "useless-suppression",
      ]
    Close #3538
  * Fix a regression where the score was not reported with multiple jobs

- Changelog from 2.5.1
  * Fix a crash in `method-hidden` lookup for unknown base classes
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3527
  * Revert pylint.Run's `exit` parameter to ``do_exit``
    This has been inadvertently changed several releases ago to ``do_exit``.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3533

- Changelog from 2.5.0
  * Fix a false negative for ``undefined-variable`` when using class attribute in comprehension.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3494
  * Fix a false positive for ``undefined-variable`` when using class attribute in decorator or as type hint.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#511, gh#PyCQA/pylint#1976
  * Remove HTML quoting of messages in JSON output.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#2769
  * Adjust the `invalid-name` rule to work with non-ASCII identifiers and add the `non-ascii-name` rule.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#2725
  * Positional-only arguments are taken in account for ``useless-super-delegation``
  * ``unidiomatic-typecheck`` is no longer emitted for ``in`` and ``not in`` operators

  * Emit ``invalid-overridden-method`` for improper async def overrides.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3355
  * Do not allow ``python -m pylint ...`` to import user code
    ``python -m pylint ...`` adds the current working directory as the first element
    of ``sys.path``. This opens up a potential security hole where ``pylint`` will import
    user level code as long as that code resides in modules having the same name as stdlib
    or pylint's own modules.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3386

  * Add a check for non string assignment to __name__ attribute.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#583
  * `__pow__`, `__imatmul__`, `__trunc__`, `__floor__`, and `__ceil__` are recognized as special method names.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3281
  * Added errors for protocol functions when invalid return types are detected.
    E0304 (invalid-bool-returned): __bool__ did not return a bool
    E0305 (invalid-index-returned): __index__ did not return an integer
    E0306 (invalid-repr-returned): __repr__ did not return a string
    E0307 (invalid-str-returned): __str__ did not return a string
    E0308 (invalid-bytes-returned): __bytes__ did not return a string

    E0310 (invalid-length-hint-returned): __length_hint__ did not return a non-negative integer
    E0311 (invalid-format-returned): __format__ did not return a string
    E0312 (invalid-getnewargs-returned): __getnewargs__ did not return a tuple
    E0313 (invalid-getnewargs-ex-returned): __getnewargs_ex__ did not return a tuple of the form (tuple, dict)
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#560
  * ``missing-*-docstring`` can look for ``__doc__`` assignments.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3301
  * ``undefined-variable`` can now find undefined loop iterables
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#498
  * ``safe_infer`` can infer a value as long as all the paths share the same type.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#2503   
  * Add a --fail-under <score> flag, also configurable in a .pylintrc file. If 
    the final score is more than the specified score, it's considered a success 
    and pylint exits with exitcode 0. Otherwise, it's considered a failure and 
    pylint exits with its current exitcode based on the messages issued.  
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#2242
  * Don't emit ``line-too-long`` for multilines when `disable=line-too-long` comment stands at their end
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#2957
  * Fixed an ``AttributeError`` caused by improper handling of ``dataclasses`` inference in ``pyreverse``
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3256
  * Do not exempt bare except from ``undefined-variable`` and similar checks
    If a node was wrapped in a ``TryExcept``, ``pylint`` was taking a hint
    from the except handler when deciding to emit or not a message.
    We were treating bare except as a fully fledged ignore but only
    the corresponding exceptions should be handled that way (e.g. ``NameError`` or ``ImportError``)
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3235
  * No longer emit ``assignment-from-no-return`` when a function only raises an exception
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3218
  * Allow import aliases to exempt ``import-error`` when used in type annotations.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3178
  * ``Ellipsis` is exempted from ``multiple-statements`` for function overloads.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3224
  * No longer emit ``invalid-name`` for non-constants found at module level.
    Pylint was taking the following statement from PEP-8 too far, considering
    all module level variables as constants, which is not what the statement is saying:
    `Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in
    all capital letters with underscores separating words.`
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3111, gh#PyCQA/pylint#3132
  * Allow ``implicit-str-concat-in-sequence`` to be emitted for string juxtaposition
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3030
  * ``implicit-str-concat-in-sequence`` was renamed ``implicit-str-concat``
  * The ``json`` reporter no longer bypasses ``redirect_stdout``. Close #3227
  * Move ``NoFileError``, ``OutputLine``, ``FunctionalTestReporter``,
    ``FunctionalTestFile``, ``LintModuleTest`` and related methods from
    ``test_functional.py`` to ``pylint.testutils`` to help testing for 3rd
    party pylint plugins.
  * Can read config from a setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#617
  * Fix exception-escape false positive with generators
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3128
  * ``inspect.getargvalues`` is no longer marked as deprecated.
  * A new check ``f-string-without-interpolation`` was added
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3190
  * Flag mutable ``collections.*`` utilities as dangerous defaults
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3183
  * ``docparams`` extension supports multiple types in raises sections.
    Multiple types can also be separated by commas in all valid sections.
    Closes gh#PyCQA/pylint#2729
  * Allow parallel linting when run under Prospector
  * Fixed false positives of ``method-hidden`` when a subclass defines the method that is being hidden.
    Closes gh#PyCQA/pylint#414
  * Python 3 porting mode is 30-50% faster on most codebases
  * Python 3 porting mode no longer swallows syntax errors
    Closes gh#PyCQA/pylint#2956
  * Pass the actual PyLinter object to sub processes to allow using custom
    PyLinter classes.
    PyLinter object (and all its members except reporter) needs to support
    pickling so the PyLinter object can be passed to worker processes.
  * Clean up setup.py
    Make pytest-runner a requirement only if running tests, similar to McCabe.
    Clean up the setup.py file, resolving a number of warnings around it.
  * Handle SyntaxError in files passed via ``--from-stdin`` option
    Pylint no longer outputs a traceback, if a file, read from stdin,
    contains a syntaxerror.
  * Fix uppercase style to disallow 3+ uppercase followed by lowercase.
  * Fixed ``undefined-variable`` and ``unused-import`` false positives
    when using a metaclass via an attribute.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#1603
  * Emit ``unused-argument`` for functions that partially uses their argument list before raising an exception.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3246
  * Fixed ``broad_try_clause`` extension to check try/finally statements and to
    check for nested statements (e.g., inside of an ``if`` statement).
  * Recognize classes explicitly inheriting from ``abc.ABC`` or having an
    ``abc.ABCMeta`` metaclass as abstract. This makes them not trigger W0223.
    Closes gh#PyCQA/pylint#3098
  * Fix overzealous `arguments-differ` when overridden function uses variadics
    No message is emitted if the overriding function provides positional or
    keyword variadics in its signature that can feasibly accept and pass on
    all parameters given by the overridden function.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#1482, gh#PyCQA/pylint#1553
  * Multiple types of string formatting are allowed in logging functions.
    The `logging-fstring-interpolation` message has been brought back to allow
    multiple types of string formatting to be used.
    Close gh#PyCQA/pylint#3361
- needs python-toml now
- remove python2 compatibility requirements
- remove PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 -- its included in %pytest macro
- two tests need special treatment:
  * test_functional[undefined_variable] gh#PyCQA/pylint#3635
  * test_do_not_import_files_from_local_directory gh#PyCQA/pylint#3636

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  7 21:44:44 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 1.5.5:
  * Let visit_importfrom from Python 3 porting checker be called when everything is disabled
    Because the visit method was filtering the patterns it was expecting to be activated,
    it didn't run when everything but one pattern was disabled, leading to spurious false 
    positives
  * Don't emit unsubscriptable-value for classes with unknown
    base classes.
  * Use an OrderedDict for storing the configuration elements
    This fixes an issue related to impredictible order of the disable / enable
    elements from a config file. In certain cases, the disable was coming before
    the enable which resulted in classes of errors to be enabled, even though the intention
    was to disable them. The best example for this was in the context of running multiple
    processes, each one of it having different enables / disables that affected the output.
  * Don't consider bare and broad except handlers as ignoring NameError,
    AttributeError and similar exceptions, in the context of checkers for
    these issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 08:25:01 UTC 2016 - jweberhofer@weberhofer.at

- Update to version 1.5.4
  * Merge StringMethodChecker with StringFormatChecker. This fixes a
    bug where disabling all the messages and enabling only a handful of
    messages from the StringFormatChecker would have resulted in no
    messages at all.
  * Don't apply unneeded-not over sets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 13 10:15:52 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.5.3:
  * Handle the import fallback idiom with regard to wrong-import-order.
    Closes issue #750.
  * Decouple the displaying of reports from the displaying of messages
    Some reporters are aggregating the messages instead of displaying
    them when they are available. The actual displaying was conflatted
    in the generate_reports. Unfortunately this behaviour was flaky
    and in the case of the JSON reporter, the messages weren't shown
    at all if a file had syntax errors or if it was missing.
    In order to fix this, the aggregated messages can now be
    displayed with Reporter.display_message, while the reports are
    displayed with display_reports.
    Closes issues #766 and #765.
  * Ignore function calls with variadic arguments without a context.
    Inferring variadic positional arguments and keyword arguments
    will result into empty Tuples and Dicts, which can lead in
    some cases to false positives with regard to no-value-for-parameter.
    In order to avoid this, until we'll have support for call context
    propagation, we're ignoring such cases if detected.
    Closes issue #722.
  * Treat AsyncFunctionDef just like FunctionDef nodes,
    by implementing visit_asyncfunctiondef in terms of
    visit_functiondef.
    Closes issue #767.
  * Take in account kwonlyargs when verifying that arguments
    are defined with the check_docs extension.
    Closes issue #745.
  * Suppress reporting 'unneeded-not' inside `__ne__` methods
    Closes issue #749.
- update to version 1.5.2:
  * Don't crash if graphviz is not installed, instead emit a warning
    letting the user to know.  Closes issue #168.
  * Accept only functions and methods for the deprecated-method
    checker.  This prevents a crash which can occur when an object
    doesn't have .qname() method after the inference.
  * Don't emit super-on-old-class on classes with unknown bases.
    Closes issue #721.
  * Allow statements in `if` or `try` blocks containing imports.
    Closes issue #714.
- update to version 1.5.1:
  * Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered
    in plugin modules. Closes issue #711.
  * Add wrong-import-position to check_messages's decorator arguments
    for ImportChecker.leave_module This fixes an esoteric bug which
    occurs when ungrouped-imports and wrong-import-order are disabled
    and pylint is executed on multiple files.  What happens is that
    without wrong-import-position in check_messages, leave_module will
    never be called, which means that the first non-import node from
    other files might leak into the current file, leading to
    wrong-import-position being emitted by pylint.
  * Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered
    in plugin modules. Closes issue #711.
  * Don't emit import-self and cyclic-import for relative imports of
    modules with the same name as the package itself.  Closes issues
    #708 and #706.
- update to version 1.5.0:
  * long list of changes, see Changelog file for details

Wed Sep  2 14:16:15 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.4:
    * Avoid breaking pylint when using logilab.common >= 1.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 16 12:22:48 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.3:
    * Remove three warnings: star-args, abstract-class-little-used,
      abstract-class-not-used. These warnings don't add any real value
      and they don't imply errors or problems in the code.
    * Added a new option for controlling the peephole optimizer in astroid.
      The option ``--optimize-ast`` will control the peephole optimizer,
      which is used to optimize a couple of AST subtrees. The current problem
      solved by the peephole optimizer is when multiple joined strings,
      with the addition operator, are encountered. If the numbers of such
      strings is high enough, Pylint will then fail with a maximum recursion
      depth exceeded error, due to its visitor architecture. The peephole
      just transforms such calls, if it can, into the final resulting string
      and this exhibit a problem, because the visit_binop method stops being
      called (in the optimized AST it will be a Const node).           

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 12 09:20:31 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.2:
    * Don't require a docstring for empty modules. Closes issue #261.
    * Fix a false positive with `too-few-format-args` string warning,
      emitted when the string format contained a normal positional
      argument ('{0}'), mixed with a positional argument which did
      an attribute access ('{0.__class__}').
      Closes issue #463.
    * Take in account all the methods from the ancestors
      when checking for too-few-public-methods. Closes issue #471.
    * Catch enchant errors and emit 'invalid-characters-in-docstring'
      when checking for spelling errors. Closes issue #469.
    * Use all the inferred statements for the super-init-not-called
      check. Closes issue #389.
    * Add a new warning, 'unichr-builtin', emitted by the Python 3
      porting checker, when the unichr builtin is found. Closes issue #472.
    * Add a new warning, 'intern-builtin', emitted by the Python 3
      porting checker, when the intern builtin is found. Closes issue #473.
    * Add support for editable installations.
    * The HTML output accepts the `--msg-template` option. Patch by
      Dan Goldsmith.
    * Add 'map-builtin-not-iterating' (replacing 'implicit-map-evaluation'),
      'zip-builtin-not-iterating', 'range-builtin-not-iterating', and
      'filter-builtin-not-iterating' which are emitted by `--py3k` when the
      appropriate built-in is not used in an iterating context (semantics
      taken from 2to3).
    * Add a new warning, 'unidiomatic-typecheck', emitted when an explicit
      typecheck uses type() instead of isinstance(). For example,
      `type(x) == Y` instead of `isinstance(x, Y)`. Patch by Chris Rebert.
      Closes issue #299.
    * Add support for combining the Python 3 checker mode with the --jobs
      flag (--py3k and --jobs). Closes issue #467.

      emitted when the `cmp` argument for the `list.sort` or `sorted builtin`
      is encountered.
    * Make the --py3k flag commutative with the -E flag. Also, this patch
      fixes the leaks of error messages from the Python 3 checker when
      the errors mode was activated. Closes issue #437.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  8 10:06:19 UTC 2014 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.4.0:
    * Added new options for controlling the loading of C extensions.
      By default, only C extensions from the stdlib will be loaded
      into the active Python interpreter for inspection, because they
      can run arbitrary code on import. The option 
      `--extension-pkg-whitelist` can be used to specify modules
      or packages that are safe to load.
    * Change default max-line-length to 100 rather than 80
    * Drop BaseRawChecker class which were only there for backward
      compat for a while now
    * Don't try to analyze string formatting with objects coming from
      function arguments. Closes issue #373.
    * Port source code to be Python 2/3 compatible. This drops the
      need for 2to3, but does drop support for Python 2.5.
    * Each message now comes with a confidence level attached, and
      can be filtered base on this level. This allows to filter out
      all messages that were emitted even though an inference failure
      happened during checking.
    * Improved presenting unused-import message. Closes issue #293.
    * Add new checker for finding spelling errors. New messages:
      wrong-spelling-in-comment, wrong-spelling-in-docstring.
      New options: spelling-dict, spelling-ignore-words.
    * Add new '-j' option for running checks in sub-processes.
    * Added new checks for line endings if they are mixed (LF vs CRLF)
      or if they are not as expected. New messages: mixed-line-endings,
      unexpected-line-ending-format. New option: expected-line-ending-format.
    * 'dangerous-default-value' no longer evaluates the value of the arguments,
      which could result in long error messages or sensitive data being leaked.
      Closes issue #282
    * Fix a false positive with string formatting checker, when
      encountering a string which uses only position-based arguments.
      Closes issue #285.
    * Fix a false positive with string formatting checker, when using
      keyword argument packing. Closes issue #288.
    * Proper handle class level scope for lambdas.
    * Handle 'too-few-format-args' or 'too-many-format-args' for format
      strings with both named and positional fields. Closes issue #286.

    * Only emit attribute-defined-outside-init for definition within the same
      module as the offended class, avoiding to mangle the output in some cases.

      taking a comma separated list of checker names as value
    o renamed debug-mode option to errors-only
  * started a reference user manual
  * new W0212 message for access to protected member from client code
  * new W0105 and W0106 messages extracted from W0104 (statement seems to
    have no effect) respectivly when the statement is actually string
    (that's sometimes used instead of comments for documentation) or an
    empty statement generated by a useless semicolumn

  * fix so that global messages are not anymore connected to the last
    analyzed module
  * fix some bugs related to local disabling of messages

    __getattr__

    socket.socket object with exec

    by default
  * included patch from Benjamin Niemann to allow block level
    enabling/disabling of messages

    you a lot of pylint crashes...)
  * W0705 has been reclassified to E0701, and is now detecting more
    inheriting problem, and a false positive when empty except clause is
    following an Exception catch has been fixed
  * E0212 and E0214 (metaclass/class method should have mcs/cls as first
    argument have been reclassified to C0202 and C0203 since this not as
    well established as "self" for instance method (E0213)
  * W0224 has been reclassified into F0220 (failed to resolve interfaces
    implemented by a class)
  * a new typecheck checker, introducing the following checks:
    o E1101, access to unexistant member (implements #10430), remove the
      need of E0201 and so some options has been moved from the classes
      checker to this one
    o E1102, calling a non callable object
    o E1111 and W1111 when an assigment is done on a function call but the
      infered function returns None (implements #10431)
  * change in the base checker:
    o checks module level and instance attribute names (new const-rgx
      and attr-rgx configuration option)
    o list comprehension and generator expression variables have their
      own regular expression  (the inlinevar-rgx option)
    o the C0101 check with its min-name-lentgh option has
      been removed (this can be specified in the regxp after all...)
    o W0103 and W0121 are now handled by the variables checker
      (W0103 is now W0603 and W0604 has been splitted into different messages)
    o W0131 and W0132 messages  have been reclassified to C0111 and
      C0112 respectivly
    o new W0104 message on statement without effect
  * regexp support for dummy-variables (dummy-variables-rgx option
    replace dummy-variables)
  * better global statement handling, see W0602, W0603, W0604 messages
  * --debug-mode option, disabling all checkers without error message
    and filtering others to only display error
  * fixed some R0201 (method could be a function) false positive
