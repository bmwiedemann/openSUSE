Fri Jun 14 07:10:32 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Remove not needed patch skip-test-under-libexpat-2.6.0.patch
- Update to 5.2.2:
  - GH#417: The test_feed_parser test could fail if lxml_html_clean
    was not installed.  It is now skipped in that case.
  - LP#2059910: The minimum CPU architecture for the Linux x86 binary
    wheels was set back to "core2", without SSE 4.2.
  - If libxml2 uses iconv, the compile time version is available as
    etree.ICONV_COMPILED_VERSION.
- 5.2.1
  - LP#2059910: The minimum CPU architecture for the Linux x86 binary
    wheels was set back to "core2", but with SSE 4.2 enabled.
  - LP#2059977: ``Element.iterfind("//absolute_path")`` failed with a
    ``SyntaxError`` where it should have issued a warning.
  - GH#416: The documentation build was using the non-standard
    ``which`` command.  Patch by Michał Górny.
- 5.2.0
  - LP#1958539: The ``lxml.html.clean`` implementation suffered from
    several (only if used) security issues in the past and was now
    extracted into a separate library:
    https://github.com/fedora-python/lxml_html_clean
    Projects that use lxml without "lxml.html.clean" will not notice
    any difference, except that they won't have potentially vulnerable
    code installed.  The module is available as an "extra" setuptools
    dependency "lxml[html_clean]", so that Projects that need
    "lxml.html.clean" will need to switch their requirements from
    "lxml" to "lxml[html_clean]", or install the new library
    themselves.
  - The minimum CPU architecture for the Linux x86 binary wheels was
    upgraded to "sandybridge" (launched 2011), and glibc 2.28 / gcc 12
    (manylinux_2_28) wheels were added.
  - Built with Cython 3.0.10.
- 5.1.2
  - LP#2059977: ``Element.iterfind("//absolute_path")`` failed with a
    ``SyntaxError`` where it should have issued a warning.
- 5.1.1
  - LP#2048920: ``iterlinks()`` in ``lxml.html`` rejected ``bytes``
    input in 5.1.0.
  - High source line numbers from the parser are no longer truncated
    (up to a C ``long``) when using libxml2 2.11 or later.
  - GH#407: A compatibility test was adapted to recent expat versions.
    Patch by Miro Hrončok.
  - Binary wheels use the library versions libxml2 2.12.6 and libxslt
    1.1.39.
  - Windows binary wheels use the library versions libxml2 2.11.7 and
    libxslt 1.1.39.
  - Built with Cython 3.0.9.

Fri Feb 18 00:36:08 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.8.0:
  * GH#337: Path-like objects are now supported throughout the API instead of
    just strings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 10 23:09:05 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.7.1:
  * Chunked Unicode string parsing via ``parser.feed()`` now encodes the input data
    to the native UTF-8 encoding directly, instead of going through ``Py_UNICODE`` /
    ``wchar_t`` encoding first, which previously required duplicate recoding in most cases.
  * The standard namespace prefixes were mishandled during "C14N2" serialisation on Python 3.
  * ``lxml.objectify`` previously accepted non-XML numbers with underscores (like "1_000")
    as integers or float values in Python 3.6 and later. It now adheres to the number
    format of the XML spec again.
  * LP#1939031: Static wheels of lxml now contain the header files of zlib and libiconv
    (in addition to the already provided headers of libxml2/libxslt/libexslt).

  which allowed JavaScript to pass through.  The cleaner now removes more sneaky
  "style" content. (bsc#1179534)
* A vulnerability was discovered in the HTML Cleaner by Yaniv Nizry, which allowed
  JavaScript to pass through.  The cleaner now removes more sneaky "style" content.
* GH#310: ``lxml.html.InputGetter`` supports ``__len__()`` to count the number of input fields.
  Patch by Aidan Woolley.
* ``lxml.html.InputGetter`` has a new ``.items()`` method to ease processing all input fields.
* ``lxml.html.InputGetter.keys()`` now returns the field names in document order.
* GH-309: The API documentation is now generated using ``sphinx-apidoc``.
* LP#1869455: C14N 2.0 serialisation failed for unprefixed attributes
  when a default namespace was defined.
* ``TreeBuilder.close()`` raised ``AssertionError`` in some error cases where it
  should have raised ``XMLSyntaxError``.  It now raises a combined exception to
  keep up backwards compatibility, while switching to ``XMLSyntaxError`` as an
  interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 17 07:30:50 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.5.2:
  * ``Cleaner()`` now validates that only known configuration options can be set.
  * LP#1882606: ``Cleaner.clean_html()`` discarded comments and PIs regardless of the
    corresponding configuration option, if ``remove_unknown_tags`` was set.
  * LP#1880251: Instead of globally overwriting the document loader in libxml2, lxml now
    sets it per parser run, which improves the interoperability with other users of libxml2
    such as libxmlsec.
  * LP#1881960: Fix build in CPython 3.10 by using Cython 0.29.21.
  * The setup options "--with-xml2-config" and "--with-xslt-config" were accidentally renamed
    to "--xml2-config" and "--xslt-config" in 4.5.1 and are now available again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  1 13:13:57 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 4.4.0
  * ``Element.clear()`` accepts a new keyword argument ``keep_tail=True`` to
    clear everything but the tail text.  This is helpful in some document-style
    use cases.
  * When creating attributes or namespaces from a dict in Python 3.6+, lxml now
    preserves the original insertion order of that dict, instead of always sorting
    the items by name.  A similar change was made for ElementTree in CPython 3.8.
    See https://bugs.python.org/issue34160
  * Integer elements in ``lxml.objectify`` implement the ``__index__()`` special method.
  * GH#269: Read-only elements in XSLT were missing the ``nsmap`` property.
    Original patch by Jan Pazdziora.
  * ElementInclude can now restrict the maximum inclusion depth via a ``max_depth``
    argument to prevent content explosion.  It is limited to 6 by default.
  * The ``target`` object of the XMLParser can have ``start_ns()`` and ``end_ns()``
    callback methods to listen to namespace declarations.
  * The ``TreeBuilder`` has new arguments ``comment_factory`` and ``pi_factory`` to
    pass factories for creating comments and processing instructions, as well as
    flag arguments ``insert_comments`` and ``insert_pis`` to discard them from the
    tree when set to false.
  * A `C14N 2.0 <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n2/>`_ implementation was added as
    ``etree.canonicalize()``, a corresponding ``C14NWriterTarget`` class, and
    a ``c14n2`` serialisation method.

  * GH#255: ``SelectElement.value`` returns more standard-compliant and
    browser-like defaults for non-multi-selects.  If no option is selected, the
    value of the first option is returned (instead of None).  If multiple options

- spec changes:
  - add fdupes

- update to 4.0.0:
  Features added:
  - The ElementPath implementation is now compiled using Cython,
    which speeds up the .find*() methods quite significantly.
  - The modules lxml.builder, lxml.html.diff and lxml.html.clean
    are also compiled using Cython in order to speed them up.
  - xmlfile() supports async coroutines using async with and await.
  - iterwalk() has a new method skip_subtree() that prevents
    walking into the descendants of the current element.
  - RelaxNG.from_rnc_string() accepts a base_url argument to allow
    relative resource lookups.
  - The XSLT result object has a new method .write_output(file)
    that serialises output data into a file according to the
    <xsl:output> configuration.

  Bugs fixed:
  - GH#251: HTML comments were handled incorrectly by the
     soupparser. Patch by mozbugbox.
  - LP#1654544: The html5parser no longer passes the useChardet
    option if the input is a Unicode string, unless explicitly
    requested. When parsing files, the default is to enable it when
    a URL or file path is passed (because the file is then opened in
    binary mode), and to disable it when reading from a file(-like) object.

    Note: This is a backwards incompatible change of the default configuration.
    If your code parses byte strings/streams and depends on character
    detection, please pass the option guess_charset=True explicitly, which
    already worked in older lxml versions.

  - LP#1703810: etree.fromstring() failed to parse UTF-32 data with BOM.
  - LP#1526522: Some RelaxNG errors were not reported in the error log.
  - LP#1567526: Empty and plain text input raised a TypeError in soupparser.
  - LP#1710429: Uninitialised variable usage in HTML diff.
  - LP#1415643: The closing tags context manager in xmlfile() could continue
    to output end tags even after writing failed with an exception.
  - LP#1465357: xmlfile.write() now accepts and ignores None as input argument.
  - Compilation under Py3.7-pre failed due to a modified function signature.

  Other changes:
  - The main module source files were renamed from lxml.*.pyx to plain *.pyx
    (e.g. etree.pyx) to simplify their handling in the build process. Care was
    taken to keep the old header files as fallbacks for code that compiles
    against the public C-API of lxml, but it might still be worth validating
    that third-party code does not notice this change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 28 17:24:27 UTC 2017 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update to 3.8.0
  Features added
  - ElementTree.write() has a new option doctype that writes out
    a doctype string before the serialisation, in the same way as
    tostring().
  - GH#220: xmlfile allows switching output methods at an element
    level. Patch by Burak Arslan.
  - LP#1595781, GH#240: added a PyCapsule Python API and C-level
    API for passing externally generated libxml2 documents into
    lxml.
  - GH#244: error log entries have a new property path with an
    XPath expression (if known, None otherwise) that points to the
    tree element responsible for the error. Patch by Bob Kline.
  - The namespace prefix mapping that can be used in ElementPath
    now injects a default namespace when passing a None prefix.
  Bugs fixed
  - GH#238: Character escapes were not hex-encoded in the xmlfile
    serialiser. Patch by matejcik.
  - GH#229: fix for externally created XML documents.
    Patch by Theodore Dubois.
  - LP#1665241, GH#228: Form data handling in lxml.html no longer
    strips the option values specified in form attributes but only
    the text values. Patch by Ashish Kulkarni.
  - LP#1551797: revert previous fix for XSLT error logging as it
    breaks multi-threaded XSLT processing.
  - LP#1673355, GH#233: fromstring() html5parser failed to parse
    byte strings.
  Other changes
  - The previously undocumented docstring option in
    ElementTree.write() produces a deprecation warning and will
    eventually be removed.
- enable source url for pdf doc
- remove patch lxml-fix-attribute-quoting.patch because it is now

Mon Dec 19 17:46:14 UTC 2016 - jmatejek@suse.com

- update for multipython build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 16 07:38:31 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 3.6.1 (FATE #321014):
  * Separate option ``inline_style`` for Cleaner that only removes ``style``
    attributes instead of all styles.
  * Windows build support for Python 3.5.

Mon Feb  1 10:36:35 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- update to version 3.5.0:
  * Unicode string results failed XPath queries in PyPy.
  * LP#1497051: HTML target parser failed to terminate on exceptions
    and continued parsing instead.
  * Deprecated API usage in doctestcompare.

- changes from version 3.5.0b1:
  * cleanup_namespaces() accepts a new argument keep_ns_prefixes that
    does not remove definitions of the provided prefix-namespace
    mapping from the tree.
  * cleanup_namespaces() accepts a new argument top_nsmap that moves
    definitions of the provided prefix-namespace mapping to the top of
    the tree.
  * LP#1490451: Element objects gained a cssselect() method as known
    from lxml.html. Patch by Simon Sapin.
  * API functions and methods behave and look more like Python
    functions, which allows introspection on them etc. One side effect
    to be aware of is that the functions now bind as methods when
    assigned to a class variable. A quick fix is to wrap them in
    staticmethod() (as for normal Python functions).
  * ISO-Schematron support gained an option error_finder that allows
    passing a filter function for picking validation errors from
    reports.
  * LP#1243600: Elements in lxml.html gained a classes property that
    provides a set-like interface to the class attribute. Original
    patch by masklinn.

    comments and processing instructions outside of the root
    element. Patch by Olli Pottonen.
  * LP#1421512: The docinfo of a tree was made editable to allow
    setting and removing the public ID and system ID of the
    DOCTYPE. Patch by Olli Pottonen.
  * LP#1442427: More work-arounds for quirks and bugs in pypy and
    pypy3.
  * lxml.html.soupparser now uses BeautifulSoup version 4 instead of
    version 3 if available.
  * Memory errors that occur during tree adaptations (e.g. moving
    subtrees to foreign documents) could leave the tree in a crash
    prone state.
  * Calling process_children() in an XSLT extension element without an
    output_parent argument failed with a TypeError. Fix by Jens
    Tröger.
  * GH#162: Image data in HTML data URLs is considered safe and no
    longer removed by lxml.html.clean JavaScript cleaner.
  * GH#166: Static build could link libraries in wrong order.
  * GH#172: Rely a bit more on libxml2 for encoding detection rather
    than rolling our own in some cases. Patch by Olli Pottonen.
  * GH#159: Validity checks for names and string content were
    tightened to detect the use of illegal characters early. Patch by
    Olli Pottonen.
  * LP#1421921: Comments/PIs before the DOCTYPE declaration were not
    serialised. Patch by Olli Pottonen.
  * LP#659367: Some HTML DOCTYPE declarations were not
    serialised. Patch by Olli Pottonen.
  * LP#1238503: lxml.doctestcompare is now consistent with stdlib's
    doctest in how it uses + and - to refer to unexpected and missing
    output.

    used with ElementPath to avoid hiding bugs in user code.
  * Several problems with PyPy were fixed by switching to Cython 0.23.

  * New ``htmlfile`` HTML generator to accompany the incremental ``xmlfile``
    serialisation API.  Patch by Burak Arslan.
  * ``lxml.sax.ElementTreeContentHandler`` did not initialise its superclass.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  4 07:43:22 UTC 2014 - mlin@suse.com

- Update to 3.4.0
  * Features added
  ** xmlfile(buffered=False) disables output buffering and flushes the
     content after each API operation (starting/ending element blocks or
     writes). A new method xf.flush() can alternatively be used to
     explicitly flush the output.
  ** lxml.html.document_fromstring has a new option ensure_head_body=True
     which will add an empty head and/or body element to the result
     document if missing.
  ** lxml.html.iterlinks now returns links inside meta refresh tags.
  ** New XMLParser option collect_ids=False to disable ID hash table
     creation. This can substantially speed up parsing of documents with
     many different IDs that are not used.
  ** The parser uses per-document hash tables for XML IDs. This reduces
     the load of the global parser dict and speeds up parsing for
     documents with many different IDs.
  ** ElementTree.getelementpath(element) returns a structural ElementPath
     expression for the given element, which can be used for lookups later.
  ** xmlfile() accepts a new argument close=True to close file(-like)
     objects after writing to them. Before, xmlfile() only closed the file
     if it had opened it internally.
  ** Allow "bytearray" type for ASCII text input.

  * Other changes
  ** LP#400588: decoding errors have become hard errors even in recovery
     mode. Previously, they could lead to an internal tree representation
     in a mixed encoding state, which lead to very late errors or even
     silently incorrect behaviour during tree traversal or serialisation.
  ** Requires Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 or later. No longer supports Python 2.4,
     2.5 and 3.1, use lxml 3.3.x for those.
  ** Requires libxml2 2.7.0 or later and libxslt 1.1.23 or later, use lxml
     3.3.x with older versions.
- Add updatream patch lxml-dont-depend-on-URL-formatting-in-test.patch
  * fix test
- Changes in 3.3.6
  * Bugs fixed
  ** Prevent tree cycle creation when adding Elements as siblings.
  ** LP#1361948: crash when deallocating Element siblings without parent.
  ** LP#1354652: crash when traversing internally loaded documents in XSLT
     extension functions.

- Update to version 3.3.2:
  - The properties resolvers and version, as well as the methods
    set_element_class_lookup() and makeelement(), were lost from iterparse
    objects.
  - LP#1222132: instances of XMLSchema, Schematron and RelaxNG did not clear
    their local error_log before running a validation.
  - LP#1238500: lxml.doctestcompare mixed up "expected" and "actual" in
    attribute values.
  - Some file I/O tests were failing in MS-Windows due to incorrect temp file
    usage. Initial patch by Gabi Davar.
  - LP#910014: duplicate IDs in a document were not reported by DTD
    validation.
  - LP#1185332: tostring(method="html") did not use HTML serialisation
    semantics for trailing tail text. Initial patch by Sylvain Viollon.
  - LP#1281139: .attrib value of Comments lost its mutation methods in 3.3.0.
    Even though it is empty and immutable, it should still provide the same
    interface as that returned for Elements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 28 10:12:18 UTC 2014 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Run tests during build

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Jan 26 13:02:19 UTC 2014 - toms@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.3.0:

  ** Features added
     n/a
  ** Bugs fixed
     - The heuristic that distinguishes file paths from URLs was
       tightened to produce less false negatives.

- Changes from 3.3.0beta5
  ** Features added
     - The PEP 393 unicode parsing support gained a fallback for
       wchar strings which might still be somewhat common on Windows systems.
  ** Bugs fixed
     - Several error handling problems were fixed throughout the code base
       that could previously lead to exceptions being silently swallowed or
       not properly reported.
     - The C-API function appendChild() is now deprecated as it does not
       propagate exceptions (its return type is void). The new function
       appendChildToElement() was added as a safe replacement.
     - Passing a string into fromstringlist() raises an exception instead of
       parsing the string character by character.

  ** Other changes
     -  Document cleanup code was simplified using the new GC features in Cython 0.20.

- Remove old source file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 13 09:58:19 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 3.2.3:
* LP#1185701: spurious XMLSyntaxError after finishing iterparse().
* Crash in lxml.objectify during xsi annotation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 08:34:19 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 3.2.1:
* The methods ``apply_templates()`` and ``process_children()`` of XSLT
  extension elements have gained two new boolean options ``elements_only``
  and ``remove_blank_text`` that discard either all strings or whitespace-only
  strings from the result list.
* When moving Elements to another tree, the namespace cleanup mechanism
  no longer drops namespace prefixes from attributes for which it finds
  a default namespace declaration, to prevent them from appearing as
  unnamespaced attributes after serialisation.
* Returning non-type objects from a custom class lookup method could lead
  to a crash.
* Instantiating and using subtypes of Comments and ProcessingInstructions
  crashed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 29 12:25:39 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 3.2.0:
  * Leading whitespace could change the behaviour of the string
  parsing functions in ``lxml.html``.
  * LP#599318: The string parsing functions in ``lxml.html`` are more robust
  in the face of uncommon HTML content like framesets or missing body tags.
  Patch by Stefan Seelmann.
  * LP#712941: I/O errors while trying to access files with paths that contain
  non-ASCII characters could raise ``UnicodeDecodeError`` instead of properly
  reporting the ``IOError``.
  * LP#673205: Parsing from in-memory strings disabled network access in the
  default parser and made subsequent attempts to parse from a URL fail.
  * LP#971754: lxml.html.clean appends 'nofollow' to 'rel' attributes instead
  of overwriting the current value.
  * LP#715687: lxml.html.clean no longer discards scripts that are explicitly
  allowed by the user provided whitelist.  Patch by Christine Koppelt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 30 17:29:03 UTC 2013 - arun@gmx.de

- update to 3.1.1:
  (changes taken from http://lxml.de/3.1/changes-3.1.1.html)

   * 3.1.1 (2013-03-29)
   ** Bugs fixed
      - LP#1160386: Write access to lxml.html.FormElement.fields raised an AttributeError in Py3.
      - Illegal memory access during cleanup in incremental xmlfile writer.
   ** Other changes
      - The externally useless class lxml.etree._BaseParser was removed from the module dict.

   * 3.1.0 (2013-02-10)
   ** Features added
      - GH#89: lxml.html.clean allows overriding the set of attributes that it considers 'safe'.
        Patch by Francis Devereux.
   ** Bugs fixed
      - LP#1104370: copy.copy(el.attrib) raised an exception. It now returns a copy of the
        attributes as a plain Python dict.
      - GH#95: When used with namespace prefixes, the el.find*() methods always used the first
        namespace mapping that was provided for each path expression instead of using the one that
	was actually passed in for the current run.
      - LP#1092521, GH#91: Fix undefined C symbol in Python runtimes compiled without threading
        support. Patch by Ulrich Seidl.

   * 3.1beta1 (2012-12-21)
   ** Features added
      - New build-time option --with-unicode-strings for Python 2 that makes the API always
        return Unicode strings for names and text instead of byte strings for plain ASCII content.
      - New incremental XML file writing API etree.xmlfile().
      - E factory in lxml.objectify is callable to simplify the creation of tags with
        non-identifier names without having to resort to getattr().
   ** Bugs fixed
      - When starting from a non-namespaced element in lxml.objectify, searching for a
        child without explicitly specifying a namespace incorrectly found namespaced
	elements with the requested local name, instead of restricting the search to
	non-namespaced children.
      - GH#85: Deprecation warnings were fixed for Python 3.x.
      - GH#33: lxml.html.fromstring() failed to accept bytes input in Py3.
      - LP#1080792: Static build of libxml2 2.9.0 failed due to missing file.
   ** Other changes
      - The externally useless class _ObjectifyElementMakerCaller was removed from the
        module API of lxml.objectify.
      - LP#1075622: lxml.builder is faster for adding text to elements with many children.
        Patch by Anders Hammarquist.

   * 3.0.2 (2012-12-14)
   ** Bugs fixed
      - Fix crash during interpreter shutdown by switching to Cython 0.17.3 for building.

   * 3.0.1 (2012-10-14)
   ** Bugs fixed
      - LP#1065924: Element proxies could disappear during garbage collection in PyPy
        without proper cleanup.
      - GH#71: Failure to work with libxml2 2.6.x.
      - LP#1065139: static MacOS-X build failed in Py3.

   * 3.0 (2012-10-08)
   ** Bugs fixed
      - End-of-file handling was incorrect in iterparse() when reading from a low-level
        C file stream and failed in libxml2 2.9.0 due to its improved consistency checks.
   ** Other changes
      - The build no longer uses Cython by default unless the generated C files are
        missing. To use Cython, pass the option "--with-cython". To ignore the fatal build
	error when Cython is required but not available (e.g. to run special setup.py
	commands that do not actually run a build), pass "--without-cython".

   * 3.0beta1 (2012-09-26)
   ** Features added
      - Python level access to (optional) libxml2 memory debugging features to simplify
        debugging of memory leaks etc.
   ** Bugs fixed
      - Fix a memory leak in XPath by switching to Cython 0.17.1.
      - Some tests were adapted to work with PyPy.
   ** Other changes
      - The code was adapted to work with the upcoming libxml2 2.9.0 release.

   * 3.0alpha2 (2012-08-23)
   ** Features added
      - The .iter() method of elements now accepts tag arguments like "{*}name" to search
        for elements with a given local name in any namespace. With this addition, all
        combinations of wildcards now work as expected: "{ns}name", "{}name", "{*}name",
	"{ns}*", "{}*" and "{*}*". Note that "name" is equivalent to "{}name", but "*" is
        "{*}*". The same change applies to the .getiterator(), .itersiblings(), .iterancestors(),
	.iterdescendants(), .iterchildren() and .itertext() methods;the strip_attributes(),
	strip_elements() and strip_tags() functions as well as the iterparse() class.
	Patch by Simon Sapin.
      - C14N allows specifying the inclusive prefixes to be promoted to top-level during
        exclusive serialisation.
   ** Bugs fixed
      - Passing long Unicode strings into the feed() parser interface failed to read the entire string.

   * 3.0alpha1 (2012-07-31)
   ** Features added
      - Initial support for building in PyPy (through cpyext).
      - DTD objects gained an API that allows read access to their declarations.
      - xpathgrep.py gained support for parsing line-by-line (e.g. from grep output) and
        for surrounding the output with a new root tag.
      - E-factory in lxml.builder accepts subtypes of known data types (such as string
        subtypes) when building elements around them.
      - Tree iteration and iterparse() with a selective tag argument supports passing a
        set of tags. Tree nodes will be returned by the iterators if they match any of the tags.
   ** Bugs fixed
      - The .find*() methods in lxml.objectify no longer use XPath internally, which makes
        them faster in many cases (especially when short circuiting after a single or
	couple of elements) and fixes some behavioural differences compared to lxml.etree.
	Note that this means that they no longer support arbitrary XPath expressions but
	only the subset that the ElementPath language supports. The previous implementation
	was also redundant with the normal XPath support, which can be used as a replacement.
      - el.find('*') could accidentally return a comment or processing instruction that
        happened to be in the wrong spot. (Same for the other .find*() methods.)
      - The error logging is less intrusive and avoids a global setup where possible.
      - Fixed undefined names in html5lib parser.
      - xpathgrep.py did not work in Python 3.
      - Element.attrib.update() did not accept an attrib of another Element as parameter.
      - For subtypes of ElementBase that make the .text or .tail properties immutable (as in
        objectify, for example), inserting text when creating Elements through the E-Factory
	feature of the class constructor would fail with an exception, stating that the text
	cannot be modified.
   ** Other changes
      - The code base was overhauled to properly use 'const' where the API of libxml2 anders
        libxslt requests it. This also has an impact on the public C-API of lxml itself, as
	defined in etreepublic.pxd, as well as the provided declarations in the lxml/includes/
	directory. Code that uses these declarations may have to be adapted. On the plus side,
	this fixes several C compiler warnings, also for user code, thus making it easier to
	spot real problems again.
      - The functionality of "lxml.cssselect" was moved into a separate PyPI package called
        "cssselect". To continue using it, you must install that package separately. The
	"lxml.cssselect" module is still available and provides the same interface, provided
	the "cssselect" package can be imported at runtime.
      - Element attributes passed in as an attrib dict or as keyword arguments are now sorted
        by (namespaced) name before being created to make their order predictable for
	serialisation and iteration. Note that adding or deleting attributes afterwards does
	not take that order into account, i.e. setting a new attribute appends it after the
	existing ones.
      - Several classes that are for internal use only were removed from the lxml.etree module
        dict: _InputDocument, _ResolverRegistry, _ResolverContext, _BaseContext, _ExsltRegExp,
	_IterparseContext, _TempStore, _ExceptionContext, __ContentOnlyElement, _AttribIterator,
	_NamespaceRegistry, _ClassNamespaceRegistry, _FunctionNamespaceRegistry,
	_XPathFunctionNamespaceRegistry, _ParserDictionaryContext, _FileReaderContext,
	_ParserContext, _PythonSaxParserTarget, _TargetParserContext, _ReadOnlyProxy,
	_ReadOnlyPIProxy, _ReadOnlyEntityProxy, _ReadOnlyElementProxy, _OpaqueNodeWrapper,
	_OpaqueDocumentWrapper, _ModifyContentOnlyProxy, _ModifyContentOnlyPIProxy,
	_ModifyContentOnlyEntityProxy, _AppendOnlyElementProxy, _SaxParserContext,
	_FilelikeWriter, _ParserSchemaValidationContext, _XPathContext, _XSLTResolverContext,
	_XSLTContext, _XSLTQuotedStringParam
      - Several internal classes can no longer be inherited from: _InputDocument,
        _ResolverRegistry, _ExsltRegExp, _ElementUnicodeResult, _IterparseContext, _TempStore,
	_AttribIterator, _ClassNamespaceRegistry, _XPathFunctionNamespaceRegistry,
	_ParserDictionaryContext, _FileReaderContext, _PythonSaxParserTarget,
	_TargetParserContext, _ReadOnlyPIProxy, _ReadOnlyEntityProxy, _OpaqueDocumentWrapper,
	_ModifyContentOnlyPIProxy, _ModifyContentOnlyEntityProxy, _AppendOnlyElementProxy,
	_FilelikeWriter, _ParserSchemaValidationContext, _XPathContext, _XSLTResolverContext,
	_XSLTContext, _XSLTQuotedStringParam, _XSLTResultTree, _XSLTProcessingInstruction

   * 2.3.6 (2012-09-28)
   ** Bugs fixed
      - Passing long Unicode strings into the feed() parser interface failed to read the
        entire string.

   * 2.3.5 (2012-07-31)
   ** Bugs fixed
      - Crash when merging text nodes in element.remove().
      - Crash in sax/target parser when reporting empty doctype.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  9 20:57:25 UTC 2012 - saschpe@gmx.de

- Update to version 2.3.3:
  * lxml.html.tostring() gained new serialisation options with_tail and doctype.
  * Fixed a crash when using iterparse() for HTML parsing and requesting start events.
  * Fixed parsing of more selectors in cssselect. Whitespace before
    pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes is significant as it is a descendant
    combinator. "E :pseudo" should parse the same as "E *:pseudo", not "E:pseudo".
  * lxml.html.diff no longer raises an exception when hitting 'img' tags without 'src' attribute.
- Changes from version 2.3.2:
  * lxml.objectify.deannotate() has a new boolean option cleanup_namespaces to
    remove the objectify namespace declarations (and generally clean up the
    namespace declarations) after removing the type annotations.
  * lxml.objectify gained its own SubElement() function as a copy of
    etree.SubElement to avoid an otherwise redundant import of lxml.etree on the user side.
  * Fixed the "descendant" bug in cssselect a second time
  * Fixed parsing of some selectors in cssselect.
- Changes from version 2.3.1:
  * New option kill_tags in lxml.html.clean to remove specific tags and their
    content (i.e. their whole subtree).
  * pi.get() and pi.attrib on processing instructions to parse
    pseudo-attributes from the text content of processing instructions.
  * lxml.get_include() returns a list of include paths that can be used to
    compile external C code against lxml.etree.
  * Resolver.resolve_file() takes an additional option close_file that
    configures if the file(-like) object will be closed after reading or not.
  * HTML cleaning didn't remove 'data:' links.
  * The html5lib parser integration now uses the 'official' implementation in
    html5lib itself, which makes it work with newer releases of the library.
  * In lxml.sax, endElementNS() could incorrectly reject a plain tag name when
    the corresponding start event inferred the same plain tag name to be in the default namespace.
  * When an open file-like object is passed into parse() or iterparse(), the
    parser will no longer close it after use.
  * Assertion error in lxml.html.cleaner when discarding top-level elements.
  * In lxml.cssselect, use the xpath 'A//B' (short for
    'A/descendant-or-self::node()/B') instead of 'A/descendant::B' for the css
    descendant selector ('A B').
  * In lxml.html, non-selected <option> tags no longer show up in the collected form values.
  * Adding/removing <option> values to/from a multiple select form field
    properly selects them and unselects them.

- Update to 2.3 (2011-03-03):
  Features added
   * When looking for children, lxml.objectify takes '{}tag' as
     meaning an empty namespace, as opposed to the parent namespace.

  Bugs fixed
    * When finished reading from a file-like object, the parser
      immediately calls its close() method.
    * When finished parsing, iterparse() immediately closes the input
      file.
    * Work-around for libxml2 bug that can leave the HTML parser in a
      non-functional state after parsing a severly broken document (fixed
      in libxml2 2.7.8).
    * marque tag in HTML cleanup code is correctly named marquee.

      document other than the original context document.
    * Support recent versions of html5lib by not requiring its
      XHTMLParser in htmlparser.py anymore.
    * Manually instantiating the custom element classes in
      lxml.objectify could crash.
    * Invalid XML text characters were not rejected by the API when
      they appeared in unicode strings directly after non-ASCII characters.
    * lxml.html.open_http_urllib() did not work in Python 3.
    * The functions strip_tags() and strip_elements() in lxml.etree
      did not remove all occurrences of a tag in all cases.
    * Crash in XSLT extension elements when the XSLT context
      node is not an element.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 30 17:25:06 UTC 2009 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 2.2.3 (2009-10-30):
  Features added
   None
  Bugs fixed
    * The resolve_entities option did not work in the incremental
      feed parser.
    * Looking up and deleting attributes without a namespace could
      hit a namespaced attribute of the same name instead.
    * Late errors during calls to SubElement() (e.g. attribute related
      ones) could leave a partially initialised element in the tree.
    * Modifying trees that contain parsed entity references could result
      in an infinite loop.
    * ObjectifiedElement.__setattr__ created an empty-string child
      element when the attribute value was rejected as a non-unicode/non-ascii string
    * Syntax errors in lxml.cssselect could result in misleading error messages.
    * Invalid syntax in CSS expressions could lead to an infinite loop
      in the parser of lxml.cssselect.
    * CSS special character escapes were not properly handled in lxml.cssselect.
    * CSS Unicode escapes were not properly decoded in lxml.cssselect.
    * Select options in HTML forms that had no explicit value attribute
      were not handled correctly. The HTML standard dictates that their value
      is defined by their text content. This is now supported by lxml.html.
    * XPath raised a TypeError when finding CDATA sections. This is now fully supported.
    * Calling help(lxml.objectify) didn't work at the prompt.
    * The ElementMaker in lxml.objectify no longer defines the default namespaces
      when annotation is disabled.
    * Feed parser failed to honour the 'recover' option on parse errors.
    * Diverting the error logging to Python's logging system was broken.

  (debug_package macro)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 14:04:56 CEST 2009 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 2.2.2 (2009-06-21):
  Features added
    * New helper functions strip_attributes(), strip_elements(),
      strip_tags() in lxml.etree to remove attributes/subtrees/tags
      from a subtree.

  Bugs fixed
    * Namespace cleanup on subtree insertions could result in missing
      namespace declarations (and potentially crashes) if the element
      defining a namespace was deleted and the namespace was not used
      by the top element of the inserted subtree but only in deeper
      subtrees.
    * Raising an exception from a parser target callback didn't always
      terminate the parser.
    * Only {true, false, 1, 0} are accepted as the lexical representation
      for BoolElement ({True, False, T, F, t, f} not any more),
      restoring lxml <= 2.0 behaviour.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 03 10:47:00 CEST 2009 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 2.2.1:

    * Injecting default attributes into a document during XML Schema
      validation (also at parse time).
    * Pass huge_tree parser option to disable parser security restrictions
      imposed by libxml2 2.7.

  Bugs fixed
    * The script for statically building libxml2 and libxslt didn't work in Py3.
    * XMLSchema() also passes invalid schema documents on to libxml2 for
      parsing (which could lead to a crash before release 2.6.24).

* Updated to 2.2 (excerpt):
  See also http://codespeak.net/lxml/changes-2.2.html

  Features added:
  - Allow lxml.html.diff.htmldiff to accept Element objects,
    not just HTML strings.
  - XSLT.strparam() class method to wrap quoted string parameters
    that require escaping.
  - Support strings and instantiable Element classes as child
    arguments to the constructor of custom Element classes.
  - GZip compression support for serialisation to files and
    file-like objects.
  - Support for standalone flag in XML declaration through
    tree.docinfo.standalone and by passing standalone=True/False
    on serialisation.

  Bugs fixed:
  - Memory leak in XPath evaluators.
  - Setting the base attribute in lxml.objectify from a unicode
    string failed.
  - Crash when parsing indented XML in one thread and merging
    it with other documents parsed in another thread.
  - Crash when parsing an XML Schema with external imports from
    a filename.
  - iter_links (and related link-rewriting functions) in lxml.html
    would interpret CSS like url("link") incorrectly (treating the
    quotation marks as part of the link).
  - Failing import on systems that have an io module.
  - Potential memory leak on exception handling. This was due
    to a problem in Cython, not lxml itself.
  - Crash when using an XPath evaluator in multiple threads.
  - Fixed missing whitespace before Link:... in lxml.html.diff.

  Other changes
  - The global error log (which is copied into the exception log)
    is now local to a thread, which fixes some race conditions.
  - More robust error handling on serialisation.
  - Export lxml.html.parse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 18 10:00:00 CEST 2008 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 2.1.2
  Features added
  * lxml.etree now tries to find the absolute path name of files
    when parsing from a file-like object. This helps custom resolvers
    when resolving relative URLs, as lixbml2 can prepend them with
    the path of the source document.

  Bugs fixed
  * Memory problem when passing documents between threads.
  * Target parser did not honour the recover option and raised an
    exception instead of calling .close() on the target.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 30 07:47:00 CEST 2008 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 2.1.1
  Features added:
  * No new features
  Bugs fixed
  * Crash when parsing XSLT stylesheets in a thread and using them
    in another.
  * Encoding problem when including text with ElementInclude under
    Python 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 09 16:21:00 CEST 2008 - toms@suse.de

- Corrected SPEC file:
  * requires now libxml2 and libxslt
  * Cleaned up spec file, added %{py_requires}
  * Inserted PDF documentation
- Updated to 2.1:
  Features added
  * Smart strings can be switched off in XPath (smart_string keyword option).
  * lxml.html.rewrite_links() strips links to work around documents with
    whitespace in URL attributes.

  Bugs fixed
  * Custom resolvers were not used for XMLSchema includes/imports and
    XInclude processing.
  * CSS selector parser dropped remaining expression after a function
    with parameters.

- Other changes
  * objectify.enableRecursiveStr() was removed, use objectify.enable_recursive_str()
    instead
  * Speed-up when running XSLTs on documents from other threads

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 20 11:23:00 CEST 2008 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 2.0.7:
- Features added:
  * Pickling ElementTree objects in lxml.objectify.
- Bugs fixed:
  * Descending dot-separated classes in CSS selectors were not
    resolved correctly.
  * ElementTree.parse() didn't handle target parser result.
  * Potential threading problem in XInclude.
  * Crash in Element class lookup classes when the __init__()
    method of the super class is not called from Python subclasses.
- Other changes:
  * Non-ASCII characters in attribute values are no longer escaped on serialisation.

- Changes from 2.0.6:
- Features added:
  * No new features
- Bugs fixed
  * Incorrect evaluation of el.find("tag[child]").
  * Windows build was broken.
  * Moving a subtree from a document created in one thread into a
    document of another thread could crash when the rest of the
    source document is deleted while the subtree is still in use.
  * Rare crash when serialising to a file object with certain encodings.
- Other changes:
  * lxml should now build without problems on MacOS-X (2.0.6)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 15 08:37:00 CEST 2008 - toms@suse.de

- SPEC: Fixed some warnings from rpmlint and removed duplicate doc dir
- Updated to 2.0.5
- Features added:
  - No new features
- Bugs fixed:
  - Resolving to a filename in custom resolvers didn't work.
  - lxml did not honour libxslt's second error state "STOPPED",
    which let some XSLT errors pass silently.
  - Memory leak in Schematron with libxml2 >= 2.6.31.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 14 07:46:20 CEST 2008 - toms@suse.de

- Features added:
  - No new features

- Bugs fixed:
  - Hanging thread in conjunction with GTK threading.
  - Crash bug in iterparse when moving elements into other documents.
  - HTML elements' .cssselect() method was broken.
  - ElementTree.find*() didn't accept QName objects


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 28 11:01:26 CET 2008 - toms@suse.de

- Split documentation into subpackage python-lxml-doc
- Updated to 2.0.3
- Features added
  - soupparser.parse() allows passing keyword arguments on to
    BeautifulSoup.
  - fromstring() method in lxml.html.soupparser.

- Bugs fixed:
  - lxml.html.diff didn't treat empty tags properly (e.g., <br>).
  - Handle entity replacements correctly in target parser.
  - Crash when using iterparse() with XML Schema validation.
  - The BeautifulSoup parser (soupparser.py) did not replace entities,
    which made them turn up in text content.
  - Attribute assignment of custom PyTypes in objectify could fail
    to correctly serialise the value to a string.

- Other changes
  - lxml.html.ElementSoup was replaced by a new module lxml.html.soupparser
    with a more consistent API. The old module remains for
    compatibility with ElementTree's own ElementSoup module.
  - Setting the XSLT_CONFIG and XML2_CONFIG environment variables at
    build time will let setup.py pick up the xml2-config and xslt-config
    scripts from the supplied path name.
  - Passing --with-xml2-config=/path/to/xml2-config to setup.py will
    override the xml2-config script that is used to determine the
    C compiler options. The same applies for the --with-xslt-config option.

- Older changes:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/2.0.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 12:03:16 CET 2007 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 1.3.6
- Bugs fixed
  - Backported decref crash fix from 2.0
  - Well hidden free-while-in-use crash bug in ObjectPath

- Other changes
  - The test suites now run gc.collect() in the tearDown() methods.
    While this makes them take a lot longer to run, it also makes
    it easier to link a specific test to garbage collection problems
    that would otherwise appear in later tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 30 13:33:22 CEST 2007 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 1.3.4
- Features added
  - The ElementMaker in lxml.builder now accepts the keyword arguments
    namespace and nsmap to set a namespace and nsmap for the Elements
    it creates.
  - The docinfo on ElementTree objects has new properties internalDTD
    and externalDTD that return a DTD object for the internal or external
    subset of the document respectively.
  - Serialising an ElementTree now includes any internal DTD subsets
    that are part of the document, as well as comments and PIs that are
    siblings of the root node.

- Bugs fixed
  - Parsing with the no_network option could fail

- Other changes
  - lxml now raises a TagNameWarning about tag names containing ':' instead
    of an Error as 1.3.3 did. The reason is that a number of projects
    currently misuse the previous lack of tag name validation to generate
    namespace prefixes without declaring namespaces. Apart from the danger
    of generating broken XML this way, it also breaks most of the
    namespace-aware tools in XML, including XPath, XSLT and validation.
    lxml 1.3.x will continue to support this bug with a Warning, while lxml
    2.0 will be strict about well-formed tag names (not only regarding ':').
  - Serialising an Element no longer includes its comment and PI siblings
    (only ElementTree serialisation includes them).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 30 15:10:07 CEST 2007 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 1.3.3
- Features added:
  - ElementTree compatible parser ETCompatXMLParser strips
    processing instructions and comments while parsing XML
  - Parsers now support stripping PIs (keyword argument 'remove_pis')
  - etree.fromstring() now supports parsing both HTML and XML,
    depending on the parser you pass
  - Support base_url keyword argument in HTML() and XML()

- Bugs fixed:
  - Parsing from Python Unicode strings failed on some platforms
  - Element() did not raise an exception on tag names containing ':'
  - Element.getiterator(tag) did not accept Comment and ProcessingInstruction
    as tags. It also accepts Element now.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 19 13:03:00 CET 2007 - toms@suse.de

- Updated to 1.1.2
