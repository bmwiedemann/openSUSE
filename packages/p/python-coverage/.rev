    <comment>- Update to version 3.5.1b1:
  * for-else constructs are understood better, and don't cause erroneous partial
    branch warnings.  Fixes issue 122.
  * Branch coverage for with statements is improved, fixing issue 128.
  * The number of partial branches reported on the HTML summary page was
    different than the number reported on the individual file pages.  This is
    now fixed.
  * An explicit include directive to measure files in the Python installation
    wouldn't work because of the standard library exclusion.  Now the include
    directive takes precendence, and the files will be measured.  Fixes
    issue 138.
  * The HTML report now handles Unicode characters in Python source files
    properly. This fixes issue 124 and issue 144. Thanks, Devin
    Jeanpierre.
  * In order to help the core developers measure the test coverage of the
    standard library, Brandon Rhodes devised an aggressive hack to trick Python
    into running some coverage code before anything else in the process.
    See the coverage/fullcoverage directory if you are interested.

    <comment>- Update to version 3.5.1:
  * The [paths] feature unfortunately didn't work in real world situations
    where you wanted to, you know, report on the combined data.  Now all paths
    stored in the combined file are canonicalized properly.

- Add python-distribute runtime requirement</comment>

    <comment>- update to 3.7:
   * Added the ``--debug`` switch to ``coverage run``.  It accepts a list of
   options indicating the type of internal activity to log to stderr.
   * Running code with ``coverage run -m`` now behaves more like Python does,
   setting sys.path properly, which fixes `issue 207`_ and `issue 242`_.
   * Coverage can now run .pyc files directly, closing `issue 264`_.

    <comment>- update to 5.3.1:
  - When using ``--source`` on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous
    versions.  This performance regression is now fixed, closing `issue 1037`_.
  - Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in `issue 1010`_. An
    immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying
    solution.
  - The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way,
    fixing `issue 986`_.  Thanks, Sebastián Ramírez (`pull request 1066`_).
  - The HTML report pages now have a :ref:`Sleepy Snake &lt;sleepy&gt;` favicon.
  - Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).</comment>

    <comment>- update to 5.4:
  - The text report produced by ``coverage report`` now always outputs a TOTAL
    line, even if only one Python file is reported.  This makes regex parsing
    of the output easier.  Thanks, Judson Neer.  This had been requested a number
    of times
  - The ``skip_covered`` and ``skip_empty`` settings in the configuration file
    can now be specified in the ``[html]`` section, so that text reports and HTML
    reports can use separate settings.  The HTML report will still use the
    ``[report]`` settings if there isn't a value in the ``[html]`` section.
  - Combining files on Windows across drives how works properly
  - Fix an obscure warning from deep in the _decimal module, as reported in
    `issue 1084`_.
  - Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including `PEP 626: Precise
    line numbers for debugging and other tools &lt;pep626_&gt;`_.</comment>

  * 0001-make-data-collection-operations-thread-safe.patch
- Add traced_file_absolute.patch to fix gh#nedbat/coveragepy#1161.
- Switch off test_debug_trace started to avoid failure
  (gh#nedbat/coveragepy#1161).
- Update to 5.5:
  - coverage combine has a new option, --keep to keep the original data
    files after combining them. The default is still to delete the files
    after they have been combined. This was requested in issue 1108 and
    implemented in pull request 1110. Thanks, Éric Larivière.
  - When reporting missing branches in coverage report, branches aren’t
    reported that jump to missing lines. This adds to the long-standing
    behavior of not reporting branches from missing lines. Now branches
    are only reported if both the source and destination lines are
    executed. Closes both issue 1065 and issue 955.
  - Minor improvements to the HTML report:
    - The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in
      local storage so you don’t have to fiddle with them so often,
      fixing issue 1123.
    - It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers
      work well, fixing issue 1124.
  - Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so
    that users will be more likely to understand what’s happening,
    closing issue 803.

    <comment>- update to 6.5.0:
  - The JSON report now includes details of which branches were taken, and which
    are missing for each file. Thanks, Christoph Blessing (`pull 1438`_). Closes
    `issue 1425`_.
  - Starting with coverage.py 6.2, ``class`` statements were marked as a branch.
    This wasn't right, and has been reverted, fixing `issue 1449`_. Note this
    will very slightly reduce your coverage total if you are measuring branch
    coverage.
  - Packaging is now compliant with `PEP 517`_, closing `issue 1395`_.
  - A new debug option ``--debug=pathmap`` shows details of the remapping of
    paths that happens during combine due to the ``[paths]`` setting.
  - Fix an internal problem with caching of invalid Python parsing. Found by
    OSS-Fuzz, fixing their `bug 50381`_.

  * Fix: the PyPI page had broken links to documentation pages,
    but no longer does
  * Fix: public members of the coverage module are now properly
    indicated so that mypy will find them
  * Added a new setting ``[report] exclude_also`` to let you add
    more exclusions without overwriting the defaults.
  * Added a :meth:`.CoverageData.purge_files` method to remove
    recorded data for a particular file.
  * Fix: when reporting commands fail, they will no longer
    congratulate themselves with messages like &quot;Wrote XML
    report to file.xml&quot; before spewing a traceback about
    their failure.
  * Fix: arguments in the public API that name file paths now
    accept pathlib.Path objects.  This includes the
    ``data_file`` and ``config_file`` arguments to
    the Coverage constructor and the ``basename`` argument to
    CoverageData.
  * Fix: In some embedded environments, an IndexError could occur
    on stop() when the originating thread exits before completion.
    This is now fixed, thanks to
  * Added a ``py.typed`` file to announce our type-hintedness.</comment>

    and a sourced package was installed inside the virtualenv,
    then all of the third-party packages inside the virtualenv
    would be measured.  This was incorrect, but
    has now been fixed: only the specified packages will be

    with incorrect LF (lines found) and LH (lines hit) totals
  * Fix: the ``coverage xml`` command on Windows could create a
    .xml file with duplicate ``&lt;package&gt;`` elements.</comment>

    <comment>- Add fix-tests.patch gh#nedbat/coveragepy@3fdda7d017ff
- Update to 7.2.5:
  * Fix: html_report() could fail with an AttributeError on isatty if
    run in an unusual environment where sys.stdout had been replaced.
    This is now fixed.
- 7.2.4:
  * Fix: with relative_files = true, specifying a specific file to
    include or omit wouldn't work correctly (issue 1604). This is now
    fixed, with testing help by Marc Gibbons.
  * Fix: the XML report would have an incorrect &lt;source&gt; element when
    using relative files and the source option ended with a slash
    (issue 1541). This is now fixed, thanks to Kevin Brown-Silva.
  * When the HTML report location is printed to the terminal, it's now
    a terminal-compatible URL, so that you can click the location to
    open the HTML file in your browser. Finishes issue 1523 thanks to
    Ricardo Newbery.
  * Docs: a new :ref:`Migrating page &lt;migrating&gt;` with details about
    how to migrate between major versions of coverage.py. It currently
    covers the wildcard changes in 7.x. Thanks, Brian Grohe.
- 7.2.3:
  * Fix: the :ref:`config_run_sigterm` setting was meant to capture
    data if a process was terminated with a SIGTERM signal, but it
    didn't always. This was fixed thanks to Lewis Gaul, closing issue
    1599.
  * Performance: HTML reports with context information are now much
    more compact. File sizes are typically as small as one-third the
    previous size, but can be dramatically smaller. This closes issue
    1584 thanks to Oleh Krehel.
  * Development dependencies no longer use hashed pins, closing issue
    1592.

  * The semantics of stars in file patterns has been clarified in
    the docs.  A leading or trailing star matches any number of path
    components, like a double star would.  This is different than
    the behavior of a star in the middle of a pattern.

    since 6.4.3.

  * Sometimes SQLite will create journal files alongside the
    coverage.py database files.  These are ephemeral, but could
    be mistakenly included when combining data files.
  * On Python 3.12+, we now disable SQLite writing journal files,
    which should be a little faster.
  * The new 3.12 soft keyword ``type`` is properly bolded in HTML
    reports.
  * Removed the &quot;fullcoverage&quot; feature used by CPython to measure
    the coverage of early-imported standard library modules.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 7.5.1:
  * Fix: a pragma comment on the continuation lines of a multi-line statement
    now excludes the statement and its body, the same as if the pragma is
    on the first line.
  * Fix: very complex source files could cause a maximum recursion error when
    creating an HTML report.
  * HTML report improvements:
    + Support files (JavaScript and CSS) referenced by the HTML report now have
      hashes added to their names to ensure updated files are used instead of
      stale cached copies.
    + Missing branch coverage explanations that said &quot;the condition was never
      false&quot; now read &quot;the condition was always true&quot; because it's easier to
      understand.
    + Column sort order is remembered better as you move between the index
      pages.
  * Added initial support for function and class reporting in the HTML report.
  * Other HTML report improvements:
    + There is now a &quot;hide covered&quot; checkbox to filter out 100% files.
    + The index page is always sorted by one of its columns, with clearer
      indications of the sorting.
    + The &quot;previous file&quot; shortcut key didn't work on the index page, but now
      it does.
  * The debug output showing which configuration files were tried now shows
    absolute paths to help diagnose problems where settings aren't taking
    effect, and is renamed from &quot;attempted_config_files&quot; to the more logical
    &quot;config_files_attempted.&quot;
  * Fix: in some cases, even with [run] relative_files=True, a data file
    could be created with absolute path names.  When combined with other
    relative data files, it was random whether the absolute file names would
    be made relative or not. If they weren't, then a file would be listed</comment>

    <comment>- update to 7.5.3:
  * Performance improvements for combining data files, especially
    when measuring line coverage. A few different quadratic
    behaviors were eliminated. In one extreme case of combining
    700+ data files, the time dropped from more than three hours
    to seven minutes.  Thanks for Kraken Tech for funding the
    fix.
  * Performance improvements for generating HTML reports, with a
    side benefit of reducing memory use, closing issue 1791.
    Thanks to Daniel Diniz for helping to diagnose the problem.
  * Fix: nested matches of exclude patterns could exclude too
    much code, as reported in issue 1779.  This is now fixed.
  * Changed: previously, coverage.py would consider a module
    docstring to be an executable statement if it appeared after
    line 1 in the file, but not executable if it was the first
    line.  Now module docstrings are never counted as executable
    statements.  This can change coverage.py's count of the
    number of statements in a file, which can slightly change the
    coverage percentage reported.
  * In the HTML report, the filter term and &quot;hide covered&quot;
    checkbox settings are remembered between viewings, thanks to
    Daniel Diniz.
  * Python 3.13.0b1 is supported.
  * Fix: parsing error handling is improved to ensure bizarre
    source files are handled gracefully, and to unblock oss-fuzz
    fuzzing, thanks to Liam DeVoe. Closes issue 1787.</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 7.6.1:
  * Fix: coverage used to fail when measuring code using
    :func:`runpy.run_path &lt;python:runpy.run_path&gt;` with a
    :class:`Path &lt;python:pathlib.Path&gt;` argument. This is now
    fixed, thanks to Ask Hjorth Larsen.
  * Fix: backslashes preceding a multi-line backslashed string
    could confuse the HTML report.  This is now fixed, thanks to
    LiuYinCarl.
  * Now we publish wheels for Python 3.13, both regular and free-
    threaded.
  * Exclusion patterns can now be multi-line, thanks to Daniel
    Diniz.  This enables many interesting exclusion use-cases,
    including those requested in issues 118 (entire files), 996
    (multiple lines only when appearing together), 1741
    (remainder of a function), and 1803 (arbitrary sequence of
    marked lines).  See the :ref:`multi_line_exclude` section of
    the docs for more details and examples.
  * The JSON report now includes per-function and per-class
    coverage information. Thanks to Daniel Diniz for getting the
    work started. This closes issue 1793 and issue 1532.
  * Fixed an incorrect calculation of &quot;(no class)&quot; lines in the
    HTML classes report.
  * Python 3.13.0b3 is supported.
  * If you attempt to combine statement coverage data with branch
    coverage data, coverage.py used to fail with the message
    &quot;Can't combine arc data with line data&quot; or its reverse,
    &quot;Can't combine line data with arc data.&quot;  These messages used
    internal terminology, making it hard for people to understand
    the problem.  They are now changed to mention &quot;branch
    coverage data&quot; and &quot;statement coverage data.&quot;</comment>

    <comment>- update to 7.6.4:
  * fix: multi-line with statements could cause contained
    branches to be incorrectly marked as missing (issue 1880).
    This is now fixed.
  * Fix: nested context managers could incorrectly be analyzed to
    flag a missing branch on the last context manager, as
    described in issue 1876.  This is now fixed.
  * Fix: the missing branch message about not exiting a module
    had an extra &quot;didn't,&quot; as described in issue 1873.  This is
    now fixed.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.8 and PyPy 3.8.
  * Fix: a final wildcard match/case clause assigning to a name
    (case _ as value) was incorrectly marked as a missing branch.
    This is now fixed, closing issue 1860.
  * Fewer things are considered branches now. Lambdas,
    comprehensions, and generator expressions are no longer
    marked as missing branches if they don't complete execution.
    Closes issue 1852.
  * Fix: the HTML report didn't properly show multi-line
    f-strings that end with a backslash continuation.  This is
    now fixed, closing issue 1836, thanks to LiuYinCarl and Marco
    Ricci.
  * Fix: the LCOV report now has correct line numbers (fixing
    issue 1846) and better branch descriptions for BRDA records
    (fixing issue 1850).  There are other changes to lcov also,
    including a new configuration option :ref:`line_checksums
    &lt;config_lcov_line_checksums&gt;` to control whether line
    checksums are included in the lcov report.  The default is
    false. To keep checksums set it to true.  All this work is
    thanks to Zack Weinberg (pull 1849 and pull 1851).</comment>

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- update to 7.6.10:
  * Fix: some descriptions of missing branches in HTML and LCOV
    reports were incorrect when multi-line statements were
    involved (issue 1874 and issue 1875).  These are now fixed.
  * Fix: Python 3.14 defers evaluation of annotations by moving
    them into separate code objects.  That code is rarely
    executed, so coverage.py would mark them as missing, as
    reported in issue 1908.  Now they are ignored by coverage
    automatically.
  * Fixed an obscure and mysterious problem on PyPy 3.10
    seemingly involving mocks, imports, and trace functions:
    issue 1902.  To be honest, I don't understand the problem or
    the solution, but git bisect helped find it, and now it's
    fixed.
  * Docs: re-wrote the :ref:`subprocess` page to put
    multiprocessing first and to highlight the correct use of
    :class:`multiprocessing.Pool
    &lt;python:multiprocessing.pool.Pool&gt;`.
  * Fix: Tomas Uribe fixed a performance problem in the XML
    report.  Large code bases should produce XML reports much
    faster now.
  * Fix: the LCOV report code assumed that a branch line that
    took no branches meant that the entire line was unexecuted.
    This isn't true in a few cases: the line might always raise
    an exception, or might have been optimized away. Fixes issue
    1896.
  * Fix: similarly, the HTML report will now explain that a line
    that jumps to none of its expected destinations must have
    always raised an exception. Previously, it would say
    something nonsensical like, &quot;line 4 didn't jump to line 5</comment>

    <comment>- update to 7.9.2:
  * Fix: complex conditionals within a line might cause a
    KeyError when using sys.monitoring, as reported in issue
    1991.  This is now fixed.
  * Fix: we can now measure coverage for code in Python archive
    (.par) files. Thanks, Itamer Oren.
  * The &quot;no-ctracer&quot; warning is not issued for Python pre-release
    versions. Coverage doesn't ship compiled wheels for those
    versions, so this was far too noisy.
  * On Python 3.14+, the &quot;sysmon&quot; core is now the default if it's
    supported for your configuration.  Plugins and dynamic
    contexts are still not supported with it.
  * Added a [run] core configuration setting to specify the
    measurement core, which was previously only available through
    the COVERAGE_CORE environment variable. Finishes issue 1746.
  * Fixed incorrect rendering of f-strings with doubled braces,
    closing issue 1980.
  * If the C tracer core can't be imported, a warning (&quot;no-
    ctracer&quot;) is issued with the reason.
  * The C tracer core extension module now conforms to PEP 489,
    closing issue 1977.  Thanks, Adam Turner.
  * Fixed a &quot;ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence&quot; error
    caused by strange empty modules, found by oss-fuzz.
  * Wheels are provided for Windows ARM64 on Python 3.11, 3.12,
    and 3.13. Thanks, Finn Womack.
  * A number of EncodingWarnings were fixed that could appear if
    you've enabled PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING, fixing issue 1966.
    Thanks, Henry Schreiner.
  * Fixed a race condition when using sys.monitoring with free-
    threading Python, closing issue 1970.</comment>
