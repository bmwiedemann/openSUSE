Mon Dec 26 12:21:27 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.0.1
  * When checking if a file mapping resolved to a file that exists,
    we weren’t considering files in .whl files. This is now fixed,
    closing issue 1511.
  * File pattern rules were too strict, forbidding plus signs and
    curly braces in directory and file names. This is now fixed,
    closing issue 1513.
  * Unusual Unicode or control characters in source files could
    prevent reporting. This is now fixed, closing issue 1512.
  * The PyPy wheel now installs on PyPy 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, closing
    issue 1510.
- Release 7.0.0
  * Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating
    your configuration:
    - Previously, * would incorrectly match directory separators,
      making precise matching difficult. This is now fixed, closing
      issue 1407.
    - Now ** matches any number of nested directories, including
      none.
  * Improvements to combining data files when using the [run]
    relative_files setting, which might require updating your
    configuration:
    - During coverage combine, relative file paths are implicitly
      combined without needing a [paths] configuration setting.
      This also fixed issue 991.
    - A [paths] setting like */foo will now match foo/bar.py so
      that relative file paths can be combined more easily.
    - The [run] relative_files setting is properly interpreted in
      more places, fixing issue 1280.
  * When remapping file paths with [paths], a path will be remapped
    only if the resulting path exists. The documentation has long
    said the prefix had to exist, but it was never enforced. This
    fixes issue 608, improves issue 649, and closes issue 757.
  * Reporting operations now implicitly use the [paths] setting to
    remap file paths within a single data file. Combining multiple
    files still requires the coverage combine step, but this
    simplifies some single-file situations. Closes issue 1212 and
    issue 713.
  * The coverage report command now has a --format= option. The
    original style is now --format=text, and is the default.
    - Using --format=markdown will write the table in Markdown
      format, thanks to Steve Oswald, closing issue 1418.
    - Using --format=total will write a single total number to the
      output. This can be useful for making badges or writing
      status updates.
  * Combining data files with coverage combine now hashes the data
    files to skip files that add no new information. This can
    reduce the time needed. Many details affect the speed-up, but
    for coverage.py’s own test suite, combining is about 40%
    faster. Closes issue 1483.
  * When searching for completely un-executed files, coverage.py
    uses the presence of __init__.py files to determine which
    directories have source that could have been imported. However,
    implicit namespace packages don’t require __init__.py. A new
    setting [report] include_namespace_packages tells coverage.py
    to consider these directories during reporting. Thanks to Felix
    Horvat for the contribution. Closes issue 1383 and issue 1024.
  * Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files.
    It was overly broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py
    settings, as described in issue 1481 and issue 1345. This is
    now fixed, but in rare cases will require changing your
    pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment
    substitution.
  * An empty file has a coverage total of 100%, but used to fail
    with --fail-under. This has been fixed, closing issue 1470.
  * The text report table no longer writes out two separator lines
    if there are no files listed in the table. One is plenty.
  * Fixed a mis-measurement of a strange use of wildcard
    alternatives in match/case statements, closing issue 1421.
  * Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on
    implementations other than CPython or PyPy (issue 1474).
  * The deprecated [run] note setting has been completely removed.
- Make fit for devel:languages:python:backports
  * Explicit usage of python3 in specfile

Mon Oct  3 15:48:41 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 6.5.0:
  - The JSON report now includes details of which branches were taken, and which
    are missing for each file. Thanks, Christoph Blessing (`pull 1438`_). Closes
    `issue 1425`_.
  - Starting with coverage.py 6.2, ``class`` statements were marked as a branch.
    This wasn't right, and has been reverted, fixing `issue 1449`_. Note this
    will very slightly reduce your coverage total if you are measuring branch
    coverage.
  - Packaging is now compliant with `PEP 517`_, closing `issue 1395`_.
  - A new debug option ``--debug=pathmap`` shows details of the remapping of
    paths that happens during combine due to the ``[paths]`` setting.
  - Fix an internal problem with caching of invalid Python parsing. Found by
    OSS-Fuzz, fixing their `bug 50381`_.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 10 15:31:21 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 6.4.4:
  * Wheels are now provided for Python 3.11.

- changes from version 6.4.3:
  * Fix a failure when combining data files if the file names
    contained glob-like patterns (pull 1405). Thanks, Michael Krebs
    and Benjamin Schubert.
  * Fix a messaging failure when combining Windows data files on a
    different drive than the current directory. (pull 1430, fixing
    issue 1428). Thanks, Lorenzo Micò.
  * Fix path calculations when running in the root directory, as you
    might do in a Docker container: pull 1403, thanks Arthur Rio.
  * Filtering in the HTML report wouldn’t work when reloading the
    index page. This is now fixed (pull 1413). Thanks, Marc Legendre.
  * Fix a problem with Cython code measurement (pull 1347, fixing
    issue 972). Thanks, Matus Valo.

- changes from version 6.4.2:
  * Updated for a small change in Python 3.11.0 beta 4: modules now
    start with a line with line number 0, which is ignored. This line
    cannnot be executed, so coverage totals were thrown off. This line
    is now ignored by coverage.py, but this also means that truly
    empty modules (like __init__.py) have no lines in them, rather
    than one phantom line. Fixes issue 1419.
  * Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual
    module, to avoid confusing code that examines everything in
    sys.modules. Thanks, Yilei Yang (pull 1399).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  9 14:27:53 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 6.4.1:
  * Greatly improved performance on PyPy, and other environments that
    need the pure Python trace function. Thanks, Carl Friedrich
    Bolz-Tereick (pull 1381 and pull 1388). Slightly improved
    performance when using the C trace function, as most environments
    do. Closes issue 1339.
  * The conditions for using tomllib from the standard library have
    been made more precise, so that 3.11 alphas will continue to
    work. Closes issue 1390.

- changes from version 6.4:
  * A new setting, [run] sigterm, controls whether a SIGTERM signal
    handler is used. In 6.3, the signal handler was always installed,
    to capture data at unusual process ends. Unfortunately, this
    introduced other problems (see issue 1310). Now the signal handler
    is only used if you opt-in by setting [run] sigterm = true.
  * Small changes to the HTML report:
    + Added links to next and previous file, and more keyboard
      shortcuts: [ and ] for next file and previous file; u for up to
      the index; and ? to open/close the help panel. Thanks,
      J. M. F. Tsang.
    + The timestamp and version are displayed at the top of the
      report. Thanks, Ammar Askar. Closes issue 1351.
  * A new debug option debug=sqldata adds more detail to debug=sql,
    logging all the data being written to the database.
  * Previously, running coverage report (or any of the reporting
    commands) in an empty directory would create a .coverage data
    file. Now they do not, fixing issue 1328.
  * On Python 3.11, the [toml] extra no longer installs tomli, instead
    using tomllib from the standard library. Thanks Shantanu.
  * In-memory CoverageData objects now properly update(), closing
    issue 1323.

- changes from version 6.3.3 :
  * Fix: Coverage.py now builds successfully on CPython 3.11
    (3.11.0b1) again. Closes issue 1367. Some results for generators
    may have changed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 12 05:47:59 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year
  * require python-base >= 3.7

- update to version 6.3.2:
  * Fix: adapt to pypy3.9’s decorator tracing behavior. It now traces
    function decorators like CPython 3.8: both the @-line and the
    def-line are traced. Fixes issue 1326.
  * Debug: added pybehave to the list of Diagnostics: coverage debug
    and --debug options.
  * Fix: show an intelligible error message if
    --concurrency=multiprocessing is used without a configuration
    file. Closes issue 1320.

- changes from version 6.3.1:
  * Fix: deadlocks could occur when terminating processes. Some of
    these deadlocks (described in issue 1310) are now fixed.
  * Fix: a signal handler was being set from multiple threads, causing
    an error: “ValueError: signal only works in main thread”. This is
    now fixed, closing issue 1312.
  * Fix: --precision on the command-line was being ignored while
    considering --fail-under. This is now fixed, thanks to Marcelo
    Trylesinski.
  * Fix: releases no longer provide 3.11.0-alpha wheels. Coverage.py
    uses CPython internal fields which are moving during the alpha
    phase. Fixes issue 1316.

- changes from version 6.3:
  * Feature: Added the lcov command to generate reports in LCOV
    format. Thanks, Bradley Burns. Closes issues 587 and 626.
  * Feature: the coverage data file can now be specified on the
    command line with the --data-file option in any command that reads
    or writes data. This is in addition to the existing COVERAGE_FILE
    environment variable. Closes issue 624. Thanks, Nikita
    Bloshchanevich.
  * Feature: coverage measurement data will now be written when a
    SIGTERM signal is received by the process. This includes
    Process.terminate, and other ways to terminate a
    process. Currently this is only on Linux and Mac; Windows is not
    supported. Fixes issue 1307.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached end-of-life on
    2021-12-23.
  * Updated Python 3.11 support to 3.11.0a4, fixing issue 1294.
  * Fix: the coverage data file is now created in a more robust way,
    to avoid problems when multiple processes are trying to write data
    at once. Fixes issues 1303 and 883.
  * Fix: a .gitignore file will only be written into the HTML report
    output directory if the directory is empty. This should prevent
    certain unfortunate accidents of writing the file where it is not
    wanted.
  * Releases now have MacOS arm64 wheels for Apple Silicon, fixing
    issue 1288.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 17:16:23 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 6.2
  * Feature: Now the --concurrency setting can now have a list of
    values, so that threads and another lightweight threading
    package can be measured together, such as
    --concurrency=gevent,thread. Closes issue 1012 and issue 1082.
  * Fix: A module specified as the source setting is imported
    during startup, before the user program imports it. This could
    cause problems if the rest of the program isn't ready yet. For
    example, issue 1203 describes a Django setting that is accessed
    before settings have been configured. Now the early import is
    wrapped in a try/except so errors then don't stop execution.
  * Fix: A colon in a decorator expression would cause an exclusion
    to end too early, preventing the exclusion of the decorated
    function. This is now fixed.
  * Fix: The HTML report now will not overwrite a .gitignore file
    that already exists in the HTML output directory (follow-on for
    issue 1244).
  * API: The exceptions raised by Coverage.py have been
    specialized, to provide finer-grained catching of exceptions by
    third-party code.
  * API: Using suffix=False when constructing a Coverage object
    with multiprocessing wouldn't suppress the data file suffix
    (issue 989). This is now fixed.
  * Debug: The coverage debug data command will now sniff out
    combinable data files, and report on all of them.
  * Debug: The coverage debug command used to accept a number of
    topics at a time, and show all of them, though this was never
    documented. This no longer works, to allow for command-line
    options in the future.
- Release notes for 6.1.2
  * Python 3.11 is supported (tested with 3.11.0a2). One still-open
    issue has to do with exits through with-statements.
  * Fix: When remapping file paths through the [paths] setting
    while combining, the [run] relative_files setting was ignored,
    resulting in absolute paths for remapped file names (issue
    1147). This is now fixed.
  * Fix: Complex conditionals over excluded lines could have
    incorrectly reported a missing branch (issue 1271). This is now
    fixed.
  * Fix: More exceptions are now handled when trying to parse
    source files for reporting. Problems that used to terminate
    coverage.py can now be handled with [report] ignore_errors.
    This helps with plugins failing to read files
    (django_coverage_plugin issue 78).
  * Fix: Removed another vestige of jQuery from the source tarball
    (issue 840).
  * Fix: Added a default value for a new-to-6.x argument of an
    internal class. This unsupported class is being used by
    coveralls (issue 1273). Although I'd rather not "fix"
    unsupported interfaces, it's actually nicer with a default
    value.
- Release notes for 6.1.1
  * Fix: The sticky header on the HTML report didn't work unless
    you had branch coverage enabled. This is now fixed: the sticky
    header works for everyone. (Do people still use coverage
    without branch measurement!? j/k)
  * Fix: When using explicitly declared namespace packages, the
    "already imported a file that will be measured" warning would
    be issued (issue 888). This is now fixed.
- Release notes for 6.1
  * Deprecated: The annotate command and the Coverage.annotate
    function will be removed in a future version, unless people let
    me know that they are using it. Instead, the html command gives
    better-looking (and more accurate) output, and the report -m
    command will tell you line numbers of missing lines. Please get
    in touch if you have a reason to use annotate over those better
    options: ned@nedbatchelder.com.
  * Feature: Coverage now sets an environment variable,
    COVERAGE_RUN when running your code with the coverage run
    command. The value is not important, and may change in the
    future. Closes issue 553.
  * Feature: The HTML report pages for Python source files now have
    a sticky header so the file name and controls are always
    visible.
  * Feature: The xml and json commands now describe what they wrote
    where.
  * Feature: The html, combine, xml, and json commands all accept a
    -q/--quiet option to suppress the messages they write to stdout
    about what they are doing (issue 1254).
  * Feature: The html command writes a .gitignore file into the
    HTML output directory, to prevent the report from being
    committed to git. If you want to commit it, you will need to
    delete that file. Closes issue 1244.
  * Feature: Added support for PyPy 3.8.
  * Fix: More generated code is now excluded from measurement. Code
    such as attrs boilerplate, or doctest code, was being measured
    though the synthetic line numbers meant they were never
    reported. Once Cython was involved though, the generated .so
    files were parsed as Python, raising syntax errors, as reported
    in issue 1160. This is now fixed.
  * Fix: When sorting human-readable names, numeric components are
    sorted correctly: file10.py will appear after file9.py. This
    applies to file names, module names, environment variables, and
    test contexts.
  * Performance: Branch coverage measurement is faster, though you
    might only notice on code that is executed many times, such as
    long-running loops.
  * Build: jQuery is no longer used or vendored (issue 840 and
    issue 1118). Huge thanks to Nils Kattenbeck (septatrix) for the
    conversion to vanilla JavaScript in pull request 1248.
- Release notes for 6.0.2
  * Namespace packages being measured weren't properly handled by
    the new code that ignores third-party packages. If the
    namespace package was installed, it was ignored as a
    third-party package. That problem (issue 1231) is now fixed.
  * Packages named as "source packages" (with source, or
    source_pkgs, or pytest-cov's --cov) might have been only
    partially measured. Their top-level statements could be marked
    as unexecuted, because they were imported by coverage.py before
    measurement began (issue 1232). This is now fixed, but the
    package will be imported twice, once by coverage.py, then again
    by your test suite. This could cause problems if importing the
    package has side effects.
  * The :meth:`.CoverageData.contexts_by_lineno` method was
    documented to return a dict, but was returning a defaultdict.
    Now it returns a plain dict. It also no longer returns negative
    numbered keys.
- Release notes for 6.0.1
  * In 6.0, the coverage.py exceptions moved from coverage.misc to
    coverage.exceptions. These exceptions are not part of the
    public supported API, CoverageException is. But a number of
    other third-party packages were importing the exceptions from
    coverage.misc, so they are now available from there again
    (issue 1226).
  * Changed an internal detail of how tomli is imported, so that
    tomli can use coverage.py for their own test suite (issue
    1228).
  * Defend against an obscure possibility under code obfuscation,
    where a function can have an argument called "self", but no
    local named "self" (pull request 1210). Thanks, Ben Carlsson.
- Release notes for 6.0
  * The coverage html command now prints a message indicating where
    the HTML report was written. Fixes issue 1195.
  * The coverage combine command now prints messages indicating
    each data file being combined. Fixes issue 1105.
  * The HTML report now includes a sentence about skipped files due
    to skip_covered or skip_empty settings. Fixes issue 1163.
  * Unrecognized options in the configuration file are no longer
    errors. They are now warnings, to ease the use of coverage
    across versions. Fixes issue 1035.
  * Fix handling of exceptions through context managers in Python
    3.10. A missing exception is no longer considered a missing
    branch from the with statement. Fixes issue 1205.
  * Fix another rarer instance of "Error binding parameter 0 -
    probably unsupported type." (issue 1010).
  * Creating a directory for the coverage data file now is safer
    against conflicts when two coverage runs happen simultaneously
    (pull 1220). Thanks, Clément Pit-Claudel.
- Release notes for Version 6.0b1
  * Dropped support for Python 2.7, PyPy 2, and Python 3.5.
  * Added support for the Python 3.10 match/case syntax.
  * Data collection is now thread-safe. There may have been rare
    instances of exceptions raised in multi-threaded programs.
  * Plugins (like the Django coverage plugin) were generating
    "Already imported a file that will be measured" warnings about
    Django itself. These have been fixed, closing issue 1150.
  * Warnings generated by coverage.py are now real Python warnings.
  * Using --fail-under=100 with coverage near 100% could result in
    the self-contradictory message total of 100 is less than
    fail-under=100. This bug (issue 1168) is now fixed.
  * The COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE environment variable now accepts stdout
    and stderr to write to those destinations.
  * TOML parsing now uses the tomli library.
  * Some minor changes to usually invisible details of the HTML
    report:
  * Use a modern hash algorithm when fingerprinting, for
    high-security environments (issue 1189). When generating the
    HTML report, we save the hash of the data, to avoid
    regenerating an unchanged HTML page. We used to use MD5 to
    generate the hash, and now use SHA-3-256. This was never a
    security concern, but security scanners would notice the MD5
    algorithm and raise a false alarm.
  * Change how report file names are generated, to avoid leading
    underscores (issue 1167), to avoid rare file name collisions
    (issue 584), and to avoid file names becoming too long (issue
    580).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  8 14:15:04 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 5.5:
  - coverage combine has a new option, --keep to keep the original data
    files after combining them. The default is still to delete the files
    after they have been combined. This was requested in issue 1108 and
    implemented in pull request 1110. Thanks, Éric Larivière.
  - When reporting missing branches in coverage report, branches aren’t
    reported that jump to missing lines. This adds to the long-standing
    behavior of not reporting branches from missing lines. Now branches
    are only reported if both the source and destination lines are
    executed. Closes both issue 1065 and issue 955.
  - Minor improvements to the HTML report:
    - The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in
      local storage so you don’t have to fiddle with them so often,
      fixing issue 1123.
    - It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers
      work well, fixing issue 1124.
  - Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so
    that users will be more likely to understand what’s happening,
    closing issue 803.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  1 20:58:07 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.4:
  - The text report produced by ``coverage report`` now always outputs a TOTAL
    line, even if only one Python file is reported.  This makes regex parsing
    of the output easier.  Thanks, Judson Neer.  This had been requested a number
    of times
  - The ``skip_covered`` and ``skip_empty`` settings in the configuration file
    can now be specified in the ``[html]`` section, so that text reports and HTML
    reports can use separate settings.  The HTML report will still use the
    ``[report]`` settings if there isn't a value in the ``[html]`` section.
  - Combining files on Windows across drives how works properly
  - Fix an obscure warning from deep in the _decimal module, as reported in

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 20 09:24:09 UTC 2020 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.3.1:
  - When using ``--source`` on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous
    versions.  This performance regression is now fixed, closing `issue 1037`_.
  - Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in `issue 1010`_. An
    immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying
    solution.
  - The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way,
    fixing `issue 986`_.  Thanks, Sebastián Ramírez (`pull request 1066`_).
  - The HTML report pages now have a :ref:`Sleepy Snake <sleepy>` favicon.
  - Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 17:12:53 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.5.1:
  * Now that 4.5 properly separated the [run] omit and [report] omit
    settings, an old bug has become apparent. If you specified a
    package name for [run] source, then omit patterns weren’t matched
    inside that package. This bug (issue 638) is now fixed.
  * On Python 3.7, reporting about a decorated function with no body
    other than a docstring would crash coverage.py with an IndexError
    (issue 640). This is now fixed.
  * Configurer plugins are now reported in the output of --debug=sys.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 10 17:25:15 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 4.5:
  * A new kind of plugin is supported: configurators are invoked at
    start-up to allow more complex configuration than the .coveragerc
    file can easily do. See Plug-in classes for details. This solves
    the complex configuration problem described in issue 563.
  * The fail_under option can now be a float. Note that you must
    specify the [report] precision configuration option for the
    fractional part to be used. Thanks to Lars Hupfeldt Nielsen for
    help with the implementation. Fixes issue 631.
  * The include and omit options can be specified for both the [run]
    and [report] phases of execution. 4.4.2 introduced some incorrect
    interactions between those phases, where the options for one were
    confused for the other. This is now corrected, fixing issue 621
    and issue 622. Thanks to Daniel Hahler for seeing more clearly
    than I could.
  * The coverage combine command used to always overwrite the data
    file, even when no data had been read from apparently combinable
    files. Now, an error is raised if we thought there were files to
    combine, but in fact none of them could be used. Fixes issue 629.
  * The coverage combine command could get confused about path
    separators when combining data collected on Windows with data
    collected on Linux, as described in issue 618. This is now fixed:
    the result path always uses the path separator specified in the
    [paths] result.
  * On Windows, the HTML report could fail when source trees are
    deeply nested, due to attempting to create HTML filenames longer
    than the 250-character maximum. Now filenames will never get much
    larger than 200 characters, fixing issue 627. Thanks to Alex
    Sandro for helping with the fix.

- test presence of python2 (not just if it is skipped; two different
  things now, unfortunately)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  6 16:55:45 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.4.2:
  * Support for Python 3.7. In some cases, class and module docstrings
    are no longer counted in statement totals, which could slightly
    change your total results.
  * Specifying both --source and --include no longer silently ignores
    the include setting, instead it displays a warning. Thanks, Loïc
    Dachary. Closes issue 265 and issue 101.
  * Fixed a race condition when saving data and multiple threads are
    tracing (issue 581). It could produce a “dictionary changed size
    during iteration” RuntimeError. I believe this mostly but not
    entirely fixes the race condition. A true fix would likely be too
    expensive. Thanks, Peter Baughman for the debugging, and Olivier
    Grisel for the fix with tests.
  * Configuration values which are file paths will now apply
    tilde-expansion, closing issue 589.
  * Now secondary config files like tox.ini and setup.cfg can be
    specified explicitly, and prefixed sections like [coverage:run]
    will be read. Fixes issue 588.
  * Be more flexible about the command name displayed by help, fixing
    issue 600. Thanks, Ben Finney.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 15:47:22 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.4.1:
  * No code changes: just corrected packaging for Python 2.7 Linux
    wheels.

- changes from version 4.4:
  * Reports could produce the wrong file names for packages, reporting
    pkg.py instead of the correct pkg/__init__.py. This is now
    fixed. Thanks, Dirk Thomas.
  * XML reports could produce <source> and <class> lines that together
    didn’t specify a valid source file path. This is now fixed. (issue
    526)
  * Namespace packages are no longer warned as having no code. (issue
    572)
  * Code that uses sys.settrace(sys.gettrace()) in a file that wasn’t
    being coverage-measured would prevent correct coverage measurement
    in following code. An example of this was running doctests
    programmatically. This is now fixed. (issue 575)
  * Errors printed by the coverage command now go to stderr instead of
    stdout.
  * Running coverage xml in a directory named with non-ASCII
    characters would fail under Python 2. This is now fixed. (issue
    573)

- changes from version 4.4b1:
  * Some warnings can now be individually disabled. Warnings that can
    be disabled have a short name appended. The [run] disable_warnings
    setting takes a list of these warning names to disable. Closes
    both issue 96 and issue 355.
  * The XML report now includes attributes from version 4 of the
    Cobertura XML format, fixing issue 570.
  * In previous versions, calling a method that used collected data
    would prevent further collection. For example, save(), report(),
    html_report(), and others would all stop collection. An explicit
    start() was needed to get it going again. This is no longer
    true. Now you can use the collected data and also continue
    measurement. Both issue 79 and issue 448 described this problem,
    and have been fixed.
  * Plugins can now find unexecuted files if they choose, by
    implementing the find_executable_files method. Thanks, Emil
    Madsen.
  * Minimal IronPython support. You should be able to run IronPython
    programs under coverage run, though you will still have to do the
    reporting phase with CPython.
  * Coverage.py has long had a special hack to support CPython’s need
    to measure the coverage of the standard library tests. This code
    was not installed by kitted versions of coverage.py. Now it is.

- update for singlespec
- update to 4.3.4:
  - Using the --skip-covered option on an HTML report with 100% coverage would
    cause a “No data to report” error, as reported in issue 549. This is now
    fixed; thanks, Loïc Dachary.
  - If-statements can be optimized away during compilation, for example, if 0:
    or if __debug__:. Coverage.py had problems properly understanding these
    statements which existed in the source, but not in the compiled bytecode.
    This problem, reported in issue 522, is now fixed.
  - If you specified --source as a directory, then coverage.py would look for
    importable Python files in that directory, and could identify ones that had
    never been executed at all. But if you specified it as a package name, that
    detection wasn’t performed. Now it is, closing issue 426. Thanks to Loïc
    Dachary for the fix.
  - If you started and stopped coverage measurement thousands of times in your
    process, you could crash Python with a “Fatal Python error: deallocating
    None” error. This is now fixed. Thanks to Alex Groce for the bug report.
  - On PyPy, measuring coverage in subprocesses could produce a warning: “Trace
    function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None”. This was spurious,
    and has been suppressed.
  - Previously, coverage.py couldn’t start on Jython, due to that
    implementation missing the multiprocessing module (issue 551). This problem
    has now been fixed. Also, issue 322 about not being able to invoke coverage
    conveniently, seems much better: jython -m coverage run myprog.py works
    properly.
  - Let’s say you ran the HTML report over and over again in the same output
    directory, with --skip-covered. And imagine due to your heroic test-writing
    efforts, a file just acheived the goal of 100% coverage. With coverage.py
    4.3, the old HTML file with the less-than-100% coverage would be left
    behind. This file is now properly deleted.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 14 19:28:37 UTC 2017 - hpj@urpla.net

- update to Version 4.3.1 — 2016-12-28:
  - Some environments couldn’t install 4.3, as described in issue 540. This is
    now fixed.
  - The check for conflicting --source and --include was too simple in a few
    different ways, breaking a few perfectly reasonable use cases, described in
    issue 541. The check has been reverted while we re-think the fix for issue 265.

- update to Version 4.3 — 2016-12-27:
  Special thanks to Loïc Dachary, who took an extraordinary interest in
  coverage.py and contributed a number of improvements in this release.
  - The HTML report now supports a --skip-covered option like the other
    reporting commands. Thanks, Loïc Dachary for the implementation, closing
    issue 433.
  - Subprocesses that are measured with automatic subprocess measurement used
    to read in any pre-existing data file. This meant data would be incorrectly
    carried forward from run to run. Now those files are not read, so each
    subprocess only writes its own data. Fixes issue 510.
  - Coverage.py wouldn’t execute sys.excepthook when an exception happened in
    your program. Now it does, thanks to Andrew Hoos. Closes issue 535.

  - The coverage combine command will now fail if there are no data files to
    combine. The combine changes in 4.2 meant that multiple combines could lose
    data, leaving you with an empty .coverage data file. Fixes issues issue 525,
    issue 412, issue 516, and probably issue 511.
  - The branch coverage issues described in issue 493, issue 496, and issue 502
    are now fixed, thanks to Loïc Dachary.
  - Options can now be read from a tox.ini file, if any. Like setup.cfg,
    sections are prefixed with “coverage:”, so [run] options will be read from
    the [coverage:run] section of tox.ini. Implements part of issue 519. Thanks,
    Stephen Finucane.
  - Specifying both --source and --include no longer silently ignores the
    include setting, instead it fails with a message. Thanks, Nathan Land and
    Loïc Dachary. Closes issue 265.
  - Coverage.py can now search .pex files for source, just as it can .zip and
    .egg. Thanks, Peter Ebden.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 15 10:06:32 UTC 2016 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 4.2:
  - Since ``concurrency=multiprocessing`` uses subprocesses, options specified on
    the coverage.py command line will not be communicated down to them.  Only
    options in the configuration file will apply to the subprocesses.
    Previously, the options didn't apply to the subprocesses, but there was no
    indication.  Now it is an error to use ``--concurrency=multiprocessing`` and
    other run-affecting options on the command line.  This prevents
    failures like those reported in `issue 495`_.
  - Filtering the HTML report is now faster, thanks to Ville Skyttä.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 28 12:16:34 UTC 2015 - marec@detebe.org

- update to 4.0.3:
  - Fixed a mysterious problem that manifested in different ways: sometimes
    hanging the process (`issue 420`_), sometimes making database connections
    fail (`issue 445`_).
  - The XML report now has correct ``<source>`` elements when using a
    ``--source=`` option somewhere besides the current directory.  This fixes
    `issue 439`_. Thanks, Arcady Ivanov.
  - Fixed an unusual edge case of detecting source encodings, described in
    `issue 443`_.
  - Help messages that mention the command to use now properly use the actual
    command name, which might be different than "coverage".  Thanks to Ben Finney,
    this closes `issue 438`_.

Tue Nov 20 18:15:53 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 3.5.3:
  + Line numbers in the HTML report line up better with the source lines, fixing
    issue 197
  + When specifying a directory as the source= option, the directory itself no
    longer needs to have a __init__.py file, though its subdirectories do, to
    be considered as source files.
  + Files encoded as UTF-8 with a BOM are now properly handled, fixing
    issue 179_.
  + Fixed more cases of non-Python files being reported as Python source, and
    then not being able to parse them as Python.  Closes issue 82 (again).
  + Fixed memory leaks under Python 3, thanks, Brett Cannon. Closes issue 147_.
  + Optimized .pyo files may not have been handled correctly, issue 195_.
  + Certain unusually named file paths could have been mangled during reporting,
    issue 194_.
  + Try to do a better job of the impossible task of detecting when we can't
    build the C extension, fixing issue 183_.
  + Testing is now done with tox
- Changes from version 3.5.2:
  + No changes since 3.5.2.b1
- Changes from version 3.5.2b1
  + The HTML report has slightly tweaked controls: the buttons at the top of
    the page are color-coded to the source lines they affect.
  + Custom CSS can be applied to the HTML report by specifying a CSS file as
    the extra_css configuration value in the [html] section.
  + Source files with custom encodings declared in a comment at the top are now
    properly handled during reporting on Python 2.  Python 3 always handled them
    properly.  This fixes issue 157_.
  + Backup files left behind by editors are no longer collected by the source=
    option, fixing issue 168_.
  + If a file doesn't parse properly as Python, we don't report it as an error
    if the filename seems like maybe it wasn't meant to be Python.  This is a
    pragmatic fix for issue 82_.
  + The -m switch on coverage report, which includes missing line numbers
    in the summary report, can now be specifed as show_missing in the
    config file.  Closes issue 173_.
  + When running a module with coverage run -m <modulename>, certain details
    of the execution environment weren't the same as for
    python -m <modulename>.  This had the unfortunate side-effect of making
    coverage run -m unittest discover not work if you had tests in a
    directory named "test".  This fixes issue 155_.
  + Now the exit status of your product code is properly used as the process
    status when running python -m coverage run ....  Thanks, JT Olds.
  + When installing into pypy, we no longer attempt (and fail) to compile
    the C tracer function, closing issue 166_.

  * for-else constructs are understood better, and don't cause erroneous partial
    branch warnings.  Fixes issue 122.
  * Branch coverage for with statements is improved, fixing issue 128.
  * The number of partial branches reported on the HTML summary page was
    different than the number reported on the individual file pages.  This is
    now fixed.
  * An explicit include directive to measure files in the Python installation
    wouldn't work because of the standard library exclusion.  Now the include
    directive takes precendence, and the files will be measured.  Fixes
    issue 138.
  * The HTML report now handles Unicode characters in Python source files
    properly. This fixes issue 124 and issue 144. Thanks, Devin
    Jeanpierre.
  * In order to help the core developers measure the test coverage of the
    standard library, Brandon Rhodes devised an aggressive hack to trick Python
    into running some coverage code before anything else in the process.
    See the coverage/fullcoverage directory if you are interested.

    properly, producing a coverage.py stack trace.  That is now fixed.
- Changes from version 3.3.1:
  + Using parallel=True in .coveragerc file prevented reporting, but now does
    not, fixing issue 49.
  + When running your code with "coverage run", if you call sys.exit(),
    coverage.py will exit with that status code, fixing issue 50.
