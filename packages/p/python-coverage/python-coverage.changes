-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 17:12:53 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.5.1:
  * Now that 4.5 properly separated the [run] omit and [report] omit
    settings, an old bug has become apparent. If you specified a
    package name for [run] source, then omit patterns weren’t matched
    inside that package. This bug (issue 638) is now fixed.
  * On Python 3.7, reporting about a decorated function with no body
    other than a docstring would crash coverage.py with an IndexError
    (issue 640). This is now fixed.
  * Configurer plugins are now reported in the output of --debug=sys.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 10 17:25:15 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 4.5:
  * A new kind of plugin is supported: configurators are invoked at
    start-up to allow more complex configuration than the .coveragerc
    file can easily do. See Plug-in classes for details. This solves
    the complex configuration problem described in issue 563.
  * The fail_under option can now be a float. Note that you must
    specify the [report] precision configuration option for the
    fractional part to be used. Thanks to Lars Hupfeldt Nielsen for
    help with the implementation. Fixes issue 631.
  * The include and omit options can be specified for both the [run]
    and [report] phases of execution. 4.4.2 introduced some incorrect
    interactions between those phases, where the options for one were
    confused for the other. This is now corrected, fixing issue 621
    and issue 622. Thanks to Daniel Hahler for seeing more clearly
    than I could.
  * The coverage combine command used to always overwrite the data
    file, even when no data had been read from apparently combinable
    files. Now, an error is raised if we thought there were files to
    combine, but in fact none of them could be used. Fixes issue 629.
  * The coverage combine command could get confused about path
    separators when combining data collected on Windows with data
    collected on Linux, as described in issue 618. This is now fixed:
    the result path always uses the path separator specified in the
    [paths] result.
  * On Windows, the HTML report could fail when source trees are
    deeply nested, due to attempting to create HTML filenames longer
    than the 250-character maximum. Now filenames will never get much
    larger than 200 characters, fixing issue 627. Thanks to Alex
    Sandro for helping with the fix.

- test presence of python2 (not just if it is skipped; two different
  things now, unfortunately)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  6 16:55:45 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.4.2:
  * Support for Python 3.7. In some cases, class and module docstrings
    are no longer counted in statement totals, which could slightly
    change your total results.
  * Specifying both --source and --include no longer silently ignores
    the include setting, instead it displays a warning. Thanks, Loïc
    Dachary. Closes issue 265 and issue 101.
  * Fixed a race condition when saving data and multiple threads are
    tracing (issue 581). It could produce a “dictionary changed size
    during iteration” RuntimeError. I believe this mostly but not
    entirely fixes the race condition. A true fix would likely be too
    expensive. Thanks, Peter Baughman for the debugging, and Olivier
    Grisel for the fix with tests.
  * Configuration values which are file paths will now apply
    tilde-expansion, closing issue 589.
  * Now secondary config files like tox.ini and setup.cfg can be
    specified explicitly, and prefixed sections like [coverage:run]
    will be read. Fixes issue 588.
  * Be more flexible about the command name displayed by help, fixing
    issue 600. Thanks, Ben Finney.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 15:47:22 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.4.1:
  * No code changes: just corrected packaging for Python 2.7 Linux
    wheels.

- changes from version 4.4:
  * Reports could produce the wrong file names for packages, reporting
    pkg.py instead of the correct pkg/__init__.py. This is now
    fixed. Thanks, Dirk Thomas.
  * XML reports could produce <source> and <class> lines that together
    didn’t specify a valid source file path. This is now fixed. (issue
    526)
  * Namespace packages are no longer warned as having no code. (issue
    572)
  * Code that uses sys.settrace(sys.gettrace()) in a file that wasn’t
    being coverage-measured would prevent correct coverage measurement
    in following code. An example of this was running doctests
    programmatically. This is now fixed. (issue 575)
  * Errors printed by the coverage command now go to stderr instead of
    stdout.
  * Running coverage xml in a directory named with non-ASCII
    characters would fail under Python 2. This is now fixed. (issue
    573)

- changes from version 4.4b1:
  * Some warnings can now be individually disabled. Warnings that can
    be disabled have a short name appended. The [run] disable_warnings
    setting takes a list of these warning names to disable. Closes
    both issue 96 and issue 355.
  * The XML report now includes attributes from version 4 of the
    Cobertura XML format, fixing issue 570.
  * In previous versions, calling a method that used collected data
    would prevent further collection. For example, save(), report(),
    html_report(), and others would all stop collection. An explicit
    start() was needed to get it going again. This is no longer
    true. Now you can use the collected data and also continue
    measurement. Both issue 79 and issue 448 described this problem,
    and have been fixed.
  * Plugins can now find unexecuted files if they choose, by
    implementing the find_executable_files method. Thanks, Emil
    Madsen.
  * Minimal IronPython support. You should be able to run IronPython
    programs under coverage run, though you will still have to do the
    reporting phase with CPython.
  * Coverage.py has long had a special hack to support CPython’s need
    to measure the coverage of the standard library tests. This code
    was not installed by kitted versions of coverage.py. Now it is.

- update for singlespec
- update to 4.3.4:
  - Using the --skip-covered option on an HTML report with 100% coverage would
    cause a “No data to report” error, as reported in issue 549. This is now
    fixed; thanks, Loïc Dachary.
  - If-statements can be optimized away during compilation, for example, if 0:
    or if __debug__:. Coverage.py had problems properly understanding these
    statements which existed in the source, but not in the compiled bytecode.
    This problem, reported in issue 522, is now fixed.
  - If you specified --source as a directory, then coverage.py would look for
    importable Python files in that directory, and could identify ones that had
    never been executed at all. But if you specified it as a package name, that
    detection wasn’t performed. Now it is, closing issue 426. Thanks to Loïc
    Dachary for the fix.
  - If you started and stopped coverage measurement thousands of times in your
    process, you could crash Python with a “Fatal Python error: deallocating
    None” error. This is now fixed. Thanks to Alex Groce for the bug report.
  - On PyPy, measuring coverage in subprocesses could produce a warning: “Trace
    function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None”. This was spurious,
    and has been suppressed.
  - Previously, coverage.py couldn’t start on Jython, due to that
    implementation missing the multiprocessing module (issue 551). This problem
    has now been fixed. Also, issue 322 about not being able to invoke coverage
    conveniently, seems much better: jython -m coverage run myprog.py works
    properly.
  - Let’s say you ran the HTML report over and over again in the same output
    directory, with --skip-covered. And imagine due to your heroic test-writing
    efforts, a file just acheived the goal of 100% coverage. With coverage.py
    4.3, the old HTML file with the less-than-100% coverage would be left
    behind. This file is now properly deleted.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 14 19:28:37 UTC 2017 - hpj@urpla.net

- update to Version 4.3.1 — 2016-12-28:
  - Some environments couldn’t install 4.3, as described in issue 540. This is
    now fixed.
  - The check for conflicting --source and --include was too simple in a few
    different ways, breaking a few perfectly reasonable use cases, described in
    issue 541. The check has been reverted while we re-think the fix for issue 265.

- update to Version 4.3 — 2016-12-27:
  Special thanks to Loïc Dachary, who took an extraordinary interest in
  coverage.py and contributed a number of improvements in this release.
  - The HTML report now supports a --skip-covered option like the other
    reporting commands. Thanks, Loïc Dachary for the implementation, closing
    issue 433.
  - Subprocesses that are measured with automatic subprocess measurement used
    to read in any pre-existing data file. This meant data would be incorrectly
    carried forward from run to run. Now those files are not read, so each
    subprocess only writes its own data. Fixes issue 510.
  - Coverage.py wouldn’t execute sys.excepthook when an exception happened in
    your program. Now it does, thanks to Andrew Hoos. Closes issue 535.

  - The coverage combine command will now fail if there are no data files to
    combine. The combine changes in 4.2 meant that multiple combines could lose
    data, leaving you with an empty .coverage data file. Fixes issues issue 525,
    issue 412, issue 516, and probably issue 511.
  - The branch coverage issues described in issue 493, issue 496, and issue 502
    are now fixed, thanks to Loïc Dachary.
  - Options can now be read from a tox.ini file, if any. Like setup.cfg,
    sections are prefixed with “coverage:”, so [run] options will be read from
    the [coverage:run] section of tox.ini. Implements part of issue 519. Thanks,
    Stephen Finucane.
  - Specifying both --source and --include no longer silently ignores the
    include setting, instead it fails with a message. Thanks, Nathan Land and
    Loïc Dachary. Closes issue 265.
  - Coverage.py can now search .pex files for source, just as it can .zip and
    .egg. Thanks, Peter Ebden.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 15 10:06:32 UTC 2016 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 4.2:
  - Since ``concurrency=multiprocessing`` uses subprocesses, options specified on
    the coverage.py command line will not be communicated down to them.  Only
    options in the configuration file will apply to the subprocesses.
    Previously, the options didn't apply to the subprocesses, but there was no
    indication.  Now it is an error to use ``--concurrency=multiprocessing`` and
    other run-affecting options on the command line.  This prevents
    failures like those reported in `issue 495`_.
  - Filtering the HTML report is now faster, thanks to Ville Skyttä.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 28 12:16:34 UTC 2015 - marec@detebe.org

- update to 4.0.3:
  - Fixed a mysterious problem that manifested in different ways: sometimes
    hanging the process (`issue 420`_), sometimes making database connections
    fail (`issue 445`_).
  - The XML report now has correct ``<source>`` elements when using a
    ``--source=`` option somewhere besides the current directory.  This fixes
    `issue 439`_. Thanks, Arcady Ivanov.
  - Fixed an unusual edge case of detecting source encodings, described in
    `issue 443`_.
  - Help messages that mention the command to use now properly use the actual
    command name, which might be different than "coverage".  Thanks to Ben Finney,
    this closes `issue 438`_.

   * Running code with ``coverage run -m`` now behaves more like Python does,
   setting sys.path properly, which fixes `issue 207`_ and `issue 242`_.

Tue Nov 20 18:15:53 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 3.5.3:
  + Line numbers in the HTML report line up better with the source lines, fixing
    issue 197
  + When specifying a directory as the source= option, the directory itself no
    longer needs to have a __init__.py file, though its subdirectories do, to
    be considered as source files.
  + Files encoded as UTF-8 with a BOM are now properly handled, fixing
    issue 179_.
  + Fixed more cases of non-Python files being reported as Python source, and
    then not being able to parse them as Python.  Closes issue 82 (again).
  + Fixed memory leaks under Python 3, thanks, Brett Cannon. Closes issue 147_.
  + Optimized .pyo files may not have been handled correctly, issue 195_.
  + Certain unusually named file paths could have been mangled during reporting,
    issue 194_.
  + Try to do a better job of the impossible task of detecting when we can't
    build the C extension, fixing issue 183_.
  + Testing is now done with tox
- Changes from version 3.5.2:
  + No changes since 3.5.2.b1
- Changes from version 3.5.2b1
  + The HTML report has slightly tweaked controls: the buttons at the top of
    the page are color-coded to the source lines they affect.
  + Custom CSS can be applied to the HTML report by specifying a CSS file as
    the extra_css configuration value in the [html] section.
  + Source files with custom encodings declared in a comment at the top are now
    properly handled during reporting on Python 2.  Python 3 always handled them
    properly.  This fixes issue 157_.
  + Backup files left behind by editors are no longer collected by the source=
    option, fixing issue 168_.
  + If a file doesn't parse properly as Python, we don't report it as an error
    if the filename seems like maybe it wasn't meant to be Python.  This is a
    pragmatic fix for issue 82_.
  + The -m switch on coverage report, which includes missing line numbers
    in the summary report, can now be specifed as show_missing in the
    config file.  Closes issue 173_.
  + When running a module with coverage run -m <modulename>, certain details
    of the execution environment weren't the same as for
    python -m <modulename>.  This had the unfortunate side-effect of making
    coverage run -m unittest discover not work if you had tests in a
    directory named "test".  This fixes issue 155_.
  + Now the exit status of your product code is properly used as the process
    status when running python -m coverage run ....  Thanks, JT Olds.
  + When installing into pypy, we no longer attempt (and fail) to compile
    the C tracer function, closing issue 166_.

- Update to version 3.5.1b1:
  * for-else constructs are understood better, and don't cause erroneous partial
    branch warnings.  Fixes issue 122.
  * Branch coverage for with statements is improved, fixing issue 128.
  * The number of partial branches reported on the HTML summary page was
    different than the number reported on the individual file pages.  This is
    now fixed.
  * An explicit include directive to measure files in the Python installation
    wouldn't work because of the standard library exclusion.  Now the include
    directive takes precendence, and the files will be measured.  Fixes
    issue 138.
  * The HTML report now handles Unicode characters in Python source files
    properly. This fixes issue 124 and issue 144. Thanks, Devin
    Jeanpierre.
  * In order to help the core developers measure the test coverage of the
    standard library, Brandon Rhodes devised an aggressive hack to trick Python
    into running some coverage code before anything else in the process.
    See the coverage/fullcoverage directory if you are interested.

  + Programs that exited with sys.exit() with no argument weren't handled
    properly, producing a coverage.py stack trace.  That is now fixed.
- Changes from version 3.3.1:
  + Using parallel=True in .coveragerc file prevented reporting, but now does
    not, fixing issue 49.
  + When running your code with "coverage run", if you call sys.exit(),
    coverage.py will exit with that status code, fixing issue 50.
