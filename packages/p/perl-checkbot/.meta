  <title>WWW Link Verifier</title>
  <description>Checkbot is a perl5 script which can verify links within a region of
the World Wide Web. It checks all pages within an identified region,
and all links within that region. After checking all links within the
region, it will also check all links which point outside of the
region, and then stop.

Checkbot regularly writes reports on its findings, including all
servers found in the region, and all links with problems on those
servers.

Checkbot was written originally to check a number of servers at
once. This has implied some design decisions, so you might want to
keep that in mind when making suggestions. Speaking of which, be sure
to check the to do file on the website for things which have been
suggested for Checkbot.</description>
