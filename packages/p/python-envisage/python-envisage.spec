%description
Envisage is a Python-based framework for building extensible
applications, that is, applications whose functionality can be
extended by adding "plug-ins". Envisage provides a standard mechanism
for features to be added to an application. When building an
application using Envisage, the entire application consists primarily
of plug-ins. In this respect, it is similar to the Eclipse and
Netbeans frameworks for Java applications.

Part of the Enthought Tool Suite (ETS).
