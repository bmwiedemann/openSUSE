%description
A learned sage once wrote on IRC:

   $^O is stupid and ugly, it wears its pants as a hat

Devel::CheckOS provides a more friendly interface to $^O, and also lets you
check for various OS "families" such as "Unix", which includes things like
Linux, Solaris, AIX etc.

It spares perl the embarrassment of wearing its pants on its head by
covering them with a splendid Fedora.
