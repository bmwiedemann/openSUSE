- Update to v0.47.0
  * Better compatibility with Django 4.0
  * New providers: Gumroad.
  * Added a new setting SOCIALACCOUNT_LOGIN_ON_GET that controls
    whether or not the endpoints for initiating a social login
    (for example, "/accounts/google/login/") require a POST request
    to initiate the handshake. As requiring a POST is more secure,
    the default of this new setting is False.
- from v0.46.0
  * New providers: Gitea, MediaWiki.
  * New translations: Georgian, Mongolian.
  * Django 3.2 compatibility.
- from v0.45.0
  * New providers: Feishu, NetIQ, Frontier, CILogin.
- from v0.44.0
  * In previous versions, the mechanism to prevent too many failed login
    attempts (ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT) could be bypassed by
    changing the casing of the login.
  * The certificate key part of the SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS
    configuration has been renamed to certificate_key. This is done
    to prevent the key from being displayed without being masked
    in Django debug pages.
  * Better compatibility with Django 3.2
- from v0.43.0
  * New translation: Slovenian.
  * If ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT is set and the user successfully
    resets their password, the timeout is cleared to allow immediate
    login.
  * You can now limit the amount of email addresses a user can
    associate to his account by setting ACCOUNT_MAX_EMAIL_ADDRESSES.
  * New providers: Apple, Okta, Stocktwits, Zoho, Zoom.
  * If email verification is set to mandatory, the email address you use
    to login with must now be verified as well.
    In previous versions, it was sufficient if the account had at least
    one verified email address, not necessarily the one used to login with.
  * Added a new setting: ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_REDIRECT_URL -- the URL
    (or URL name) to redirect to directly after signing up.
  * In previous versions, the allauth app included a base.html template.
    This template could conflict with an equally named template at project
    level. Therefore, base.html has now been moved to account/base.html

  * Fixes CVE-2019-19844: Potential account hijack via password
    reset form bsc#1159447

  to be present always anyway

  * Added support for Patreon API v2, with API v1 set as default for backwards compatibility.

- Update to 0.39.1:
  * The linkedin_oauth2 provider now gracefully deals with old V1 data that might still be present in SocialAccount.extra_data.
  * New providers: JupyterHub (OAuth2), Steam (OpenID)
  * Refactor translations: Portuguese (Portugal).
  * Add testing for Django 2.2 (no code changes required)
  * linkedin_oauth2: As the LinkedIn V1 API is deprecated, the user info endpoint has been moved over to use the API V2. The format of the user extra_data is different and the profile picture is absent by default.
