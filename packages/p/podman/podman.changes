4.3.1:

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a deadlock between the `podman ps` and `podman container inspect` commands

### Misc
- Updated the containers/image library to v5.23.1


4.3.0:

### Features
- A new command, `podman generate spec`, has been added, which creates a JSON struct based on a given container that can be used with the Podman REST API to create containers.
- A new command, `podman update`, has been added,which makes changes to the resource limits of existing containers. Please note that these changes do not persist if the container is restarted ([#15067](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15067)).
- A new command, `podman kube down`, has been added, which removes pods and containers created by the given Kubernetes YAML (functionality is identical to `podman kube play --down`, but it now has its own command).
- The `podman kube play` command now supports Kubernetes secrets using Podman's secrets backend.
- Systemd-managed pods created by the `podman kube play` command now integrate with sd-notify, using the `io.containers.sdnotify` annotation (or `io.containers.sdnotify/$name` for specific containers).
- Systemd-managed pods created by `podman kube play` can now be auto-updated, using the `io.containers.auto-update` annotation (or `io.containers.auto-update/$name` for specific containers).
- The `podman kube play` command can now read YAML from URLs, e.g. `podman kube play https://example.com/demo.yml` ([#14955](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14955)).
- The `podman kube play` command now supports the `emptyDir` volume type ([#13309](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13309)).
- The `podman kube play` command now supports the `HostUsers` field in the pod spec.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports `binaryData` in ConfigMaps.
- The `podman pod create` command can now set additional resource limits for pods using the new `--memory-swap`, `--cpuset-mems`, `--device-read-bps`, `--device-write-bps`, `--blkio-weight`, `--blkio-weight-device`, and `--cpu-shares` options.
- The `podman machine init` command now supports a new option, `--username`, to set the username that will be used to connect to the VM as a non-root user ([#15402](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15402)).
- The `podman volume create` command's `-o timeout=` option can now set a timeout of 0, indicating volume plugin operations will never time out.
- Added support for a new volume driver, `image`, which allows volumes to be created that are backed by images.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands support a new option, `--env-merge`, allowing environment variables to be specified relative to other environment variables in the image (e.g. `podman run --env-merge "PATH=$PATH:/my/app" ...`) ([#15288](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15288)).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands support a new option, `--on-failure`, to allow action to be taken when a container fails health checks, with the following supported actions: `none` (take no action, the default), `kill` (kill the container), `restart` (restart the container), and `stop` (stop the container).
- The `--keep-id` option to `podman create` and `podman run` now supports new options, `uid` and `gid`, to set the UID and GID of the user in the container that will be mapped to the user running Podman (e.g. `--userns=keep-id:uid=11` will made the user running Podman to UID 11 in the container) ([#15294](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15294)).
- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a new option, `--env`/`-e`, to set environment variables in the generated unit file ([#15523](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15523)).
- The `podman pause` and `podman unpause` commands now support the `--latest`, `--cidfile`, and `--filter` options.
- The `podman restart` command now supports the `--cidfile` and `--filter` options.
- The `podman rm` command now supports the `--filter` option to select which containers will be removed.
- The `podman rmi` command now supports a new option, `--no-prune`, to prevent the removal of dangling parents of removed images.
- The `--dns-opt` option to `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman pod create` has received a new alias, `--dns-option`, to improve Docker compatibility.
- The `podman` command now features a new global flag, `--debug`/`-D`, which enables debug-level logging (identical to `--log-level=debug`), improving Docker compatibility.
- The `podman` command now features a new global flag, `--config`. This flag is ignored, and is only included for Docker compatibility ([#14767](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14767)).
- The `podman manifest create` command now accepts a new option, `--amend`/`-a`.
- The `podman manifest create`, `podman manifest add` and `podman manifest push` commands now accept a new option, `--insecure` (identical to `--tls-verify=false`), improving Docker compatibility.
- The `podman secret create` command's `--driver` and `--format` options now have new aliases, `-d` for `--driver` and `-f` for `--format`.
- The `podman secret create` command now supports a new option, `--label`/`-l`, to add labels to created secrets.
- The `podman secret ls` command now accepts the `--quiet`/`-q` option.
- The `podman secret inspect` command now accepts a new option, `--pretty`, to print output in human-readable format.
- The `podman stats` command now accepts the `--no-trunc` option.
- The `podman save` command now accepts the `--signature-policy` option ([#15869](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15869)).
- The `podman pod inspect` command now allows multiple arguments to be passed. If so, it will return a JSON array of the inspected pods ([#15674](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15674)).
- A series of new hidden commands have been added under `podman context` as aliases to existing `podman system connection` commands, to improve Docker compatibility.
- The remote Podman client now supports proxying signals for attach sessions when the `--sig-proxy` option is set ([#14707](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14707)).

### Changes
- Duplicate volume mounts are now allowed with the `-v` option to `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create`, so long as source, destination, and options all match ([#4217](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/4217)).
- The `podman generate kube` and `podman play kube` commands have been renamed to `podman kube generate` and `podman kube play` to group Kubernetes-related commands. Aliases have been added to ensure the old command names still function.
- A number of Podman commands (`podman init`, `podman container checkpoint`, `podman container restore`, `podman container cleanup`) now print the user-inputted name of the container, instead of its full ID, on success.
- When an unsupported option (e.g. resource limit) is specified for a rootless container on a cgroups v1 system, a warning message is now printed that the limit will not be honored.
- The installer for the Windows Podman client has been improved.
- The `--cpu-rt-period` and `--cpu-rt-runtime` options to `podman run` and `podman create` now print a warning and are ignored on cgroups v2 systems (cgroups v2 having dropped support for these controllers) ([#15666](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15666)).
- Privileged containers running systemd will no longer mount `/dev/tty*` devices other than `/dev/tty` itself into the container ([#15878](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15878)).
- Events for containers that are part of a pod now include the ID of the pod in the event.
- SSH functionality for `podman machine` commands has seen a thorough rework, addressing many issues about authentication.
- The `--network` option to `podman kube play` now allows passing `host` to set the pod to use host networking, even if the YAML does not request this.
- The `podman inspect` command on containers now includes the digest of the image used to create the container.
- Pods created by `podman play kube` are now, by default, placed into a network named `podman-kube`. If the `podman-kube` network does not exist, it will be created. This ensures pods can connect to each other by their names, as the network has DNS enabled.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman network prune` and `podman container prune` commands did not properly support the `--filter label!=` option ([#14182](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14182)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube generate` command added an unnecessary `Secret: null` line to generated YAML ([#15156](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15156)).

- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command did not respect default values for liveness probes ([#15855](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15855)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command did not bind ports if `hostPort` was not specified but `containerPort` was ([#15942](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15942)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command sometimes did not create directories on the host for `hostPath` volumes.
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman manifest push` command did not display progress.
- Fixed a bug where the `--filter "{{.Config.Healthcheck}}"` option to `podman image inspect` did not print the image's configured healthcheck ([#14661](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14661)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman volume create -o timeout=` option could be specified even when no volume plugin was in use.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman rmi` command did not emit `untag` events when removing tagged images ([#15485](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15485)).
- Fixed a bug where API forwarding with `podman machine` VMs on windows could sometimes fail because the pipe was not created in time ([#14811](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14811)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod rm` command could error if removal of a container in the pod was interrupted by a reboot.
- Fixed a bug where the `exited` and `exec died` events for containers did not include the container's labels ([#15617](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15617)).
- Fixed a bug where running Systemd containers on a system not using Systemd as PID 1 could fail ([#15647](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15647)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman did not pass all necessary environment variables (including `$PATH`) to Conmon when starting containers ([#15707](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15707)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman events` command could function improperly when no events were present ([#15688](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15688)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--format` flag to various Podman commands did not properly handle template strings including a newline (`\n`) ([#13446](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13446)).
- Fixed a bug where Systemd-managed pods would kill every container in a pod when a single container exited ([#14546](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14546)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd` command would generate incorrect YAML for pods created without the `--name` option.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command did not properly set stop timeout ([#16149](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16149)).
- Fixed a bug where a broken OCI spec resulting from the system rebooting while a container is being started could cause the `podman inspect` command to be unable to inspect the container until it was restarted.
- Fixed a bug where creating a container with a working directory on an overlay volume would result in the container being unable to start ([#15789](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15789)).
- Fixed a bug where attempting to remove a pod with running containers without `--force` would not error and instead would result in the pod, and its remaining containers, being placed in an unusable state ([#15526](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15526)).
- Fixed a bug where memory limits reported by `podman stats` could exceed the maximum memory available on the system ([#15765](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15765)).

- The Libpod Restore endpoint for Containers now features a new query parameter, `pod`, to set the pod that the container will be restored into ([#15018](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15018)).
- Fixed a bug where the REST API could panic while retrieving images.
- Fixed a bug where a cancelled connection to several endpoints could induce a memory leak.

- Update to version 4.2.0:
  * Features
    - Podman now supports the Gitlab Runner (using the Docker executor), allowing its use in Gitlab CI/CD pipelines.
    - A new command has been added, podman pod clone, to create a copy of an existing pod. It supports several options, including --start to start the new pod, --destroy to remove the original pod, and --name to change the name of the new pod (#12843).
    - A new command has been added, podman volume reload, to sync changes in state between Podman's database and any configured volume plugins (#14207).
    - A new command has been added, podman machine info, which displays information about the host and the versions of various machine components.
    - Pods created by podman play kube can now be managed by systemd unit files. This can be done via a new systemd service, podman-kube@.service - e.g. systemctl --user start podman-play-kube@$(systemd-escape my.yaml).service will run the Kubernetes pod or deployment contained in my.yaml under systemd.
    - The podman play kube command now honors the RunAsUser, RunAsGroup, and SupplementalGroups setting from the Kubernetes pod's security context.
    - The podman play kube command now supports volumes with the BlockDevice and CharDevice types (#13951).
    - The podman play kube command now features a new flag, --userns, to set the user namespace of created pods. Two values are allowed at present: host and auto (#7504).
    - The podman play kube command now supports setting the type of created init containers via the io.podman.annotations.init.container.type annotation.
    - Pods now have include an exit policy (configurable via the --exit-policy option to podman pod create), which determines what will happen to the pod's infra container when the entire pod stops. The default, continue, acts as Podman currently does, while a new option, stop, stops the infra container after the last container in the pod stops, and is used by default for pods from podman play kube (#13464).
    - The podman pod create command now allows the pod's name to be specified as an argument, instead of using the --name option - for example, podman pod create mypod instead of the prior podman pod create --name mypod. Please note that the --name option is not deprecated and will continue to work.
    - The podman pod create command's --share option now supports adding namespaces to the set by prefacing them with + (as opposed to specifying all namespaces that should be shared) (#13422).
    - The podman pod create command has a new option, --shm-size, to specify the size of the /dev/shm mount that will be shared if the pod shares its UTS namespace (#14609).
    - The podman pod create command has a new option, --uts, to configure the UTS namespace that will be shared by containers in the pod.
    - The podman pod create command now supports setting pod-level resource limits via the --cpus, --cpuset-cpus, and --memory options. These will set a limit for all containers in the pod, while individual containers within the pod are allowed to set further limits. Look forward to more options for resource limits in our next release!
    - The podman create and podman run commands now include the -c short option for the --cpu-shares option.
    - The podman create and podman run commands can now create containers from a manifest list (and not an image) as long as the --platform option is specified (#14773).
    - The podman build command now supports a new option, --cpp-flag, to specify options for the C preprocessor when using Containerfile.in files that require preprocessing.
    - The podman build command now supports a new option, --build-context, allowing the user to specify an additional build context.
    - The podman machine inspect command now prints the location of the VM's Podman API socket on the host (#14231).
    - The podman machine init command on Windows now fetches an image with packages pre-installed (#14698).
    - Unused, cached Podman machine VM images are now cleaned up automatically. Note that because Podman now caches in a different directory, this will not clean up old images pulled before this change (#14697).
    - The default for the --image-volume option to podman run and podman create can now have its default set through the image_volume_mode setting in containers.conf (#14230).
    - Overlay volumes now support two new options, workdir and upperdir, to allow multiple overlay volumes from different containers to reuse the same workdir or upperdir (#14427).
    - The podman volume create command now supports two new options, copy and nocopy, to control whether contents from the overmounted folder in a container will be copied into the newly-created named volume (copy-up).
    - Volumes created using a volume plugin can now specify a timeout for all operations that contact the volume plugin (replacing the standard 5 second timeout) via the --opt o=timeout= option to podman volume create (BZ 2080458).
    - The podman volume ls command's --filter name= option now supports regular expression matching for volume names (#14583).
    - When used with a podman machine VM, volumes now support specification of the 9p security model using the security_model option to podman create -v and podman run -v.
    - The remote Podman client's podman push command now supports the --remove-signatures option (#14558).
    - The remote Podman client now supports the podman image scp command.
    - The podman image scp command now supports tagging the transferred image with a new name.
    - The podman network ls command supports a new filter, --filter dangling=, to list networks not presently used by any containers (#14595).
    - The --condition option to podman wait can now be specified multiple times to wait on any one of multiple conditions.
    - The podman events command now includes the -f short option for the --filter option.
    - The podman pull command now includes the -a short option for the --all-tags option.
    - The podman stop command now includes a new flag, --filter, to filter which containers will be stopped (e.g. podman stop --all --filter label=COM.MY.APP).
    - The Podman global option --url now has two aliases: -H and --host.
    - The podman network create command now supports a new option with the default bridge driver, --opt isolate=, which isolates the network by blocking any traffic from it to any other network with the isolate option enabled. This option is enabled by default for networks created using the Docker-compatible API.
    - Added the ability to create sigstore signatures in podman push and podman manifest push.
    - Added an option to read image signing passphrase from a file.
  * Changes
    - Paused containers can now be killed with the podman kill command.
    - The podman system prune command now removes unused networks.
    - The --userns=keep-id and --userns=nomap options to the podman run and podman create commands are no longer allowed (instead of simply being ignored) with root Podman.
    - If the /run directory for a container is part of a volume, Podman will not create the /run/.containerenv file (#14577).
    - The podman machine stop command on macOS now waits for the machine to be completely stopped to exit (#14148).
    - All podman machine commands now only support being run as rootless, given that VMs only functioned when run rootless.
    - The podman unpause --all command will now only attempt to unpause containers that are paused, not all containers.
    - Init containers created with podman play kube now default to the once type (#14877).
    - Pods created with no shared namespaces will no longer create an infra container unless one is explicitly requested (#15048).
    - The podman create, podman run, and podman cp commands can now autocomplete paths in the image or container via the shell completion.
    - The libpod/common package has been removed as it's not used anywhere.
    - The --userns option to podman create and podman run is no longer accepted when an explicit UID or GID mapping is specified (#15233).
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where bind-mounting /dev into a container which used the --init flag would cause the container to fail to start (#14251).

- Update to version 4.1.1:
  * The output of the podman load command now mirrors that of docker load.
  * Podman now supports Docker Compose v2.2 and higher. Please note that it may be necessary to disable the use of Buildkit by setting the environment variable DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0.
  * A new container command has been added, podman container clone. This command makes a copy of an existing container, with the ability to change some settings (e.g. resource limits) while doing so.
  * Podman now supports sending JSON events related to machines to a Unix socket named machine_events.*\.sock in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman or to a socket whose path is set in the PODMAN_MACHINE_EVENTS_SOCK environment variable.
  * Two new volume commands have been added, podman volume mount and podman volume unmount. These allow for Podman-managed named volumes to be mounted and accessed from outside containers.
  * The podman container checkpoint and podman container restore options now support checkpointing to and restoring from OCI images. This allows checkpoints to be distributed via standard image registries.
  * The podman play kube command now supports environment variables that are specified using the fieldRef and resourceFieldRef sources.
  * The podman play kube command will now set default resource limits when the provided YAML does not include them.
  * The podman play kube command now supports a new option, --annotation, to add annotations to created containers.
  * The podman play kube --build command now supports a new option, --context-dir, which allows the user to specify the context directory to use when building the Containerfile.
  * The podman container commit command now supports a new option, --squash, which squashes the generated image into a single layer.
  * The podman pod logs command now supports two new options, --names, which identifies which container generated a log message by name, instead of ID and --color, which colors messages based on what container generated them.
  * The podman rmi command now supports a new option, --ignore, which will ignore errors caused by missing images.
  * The podman network create command now features a new option, --ipam-driver, to specify details about how IP addresses are assigned to containers in the network.
  * The podman machine list command now features a new option, --quiet, to print only the names of configured VMs and no other information.
  * The --ipc option to the podman create, podman run, and podman pod create commands now supports three new modes: none, private, and shareable. The default IPC mode is now shareable, indicating the the IPC namespace can be shared with other containers.
  * The --mount option to the podman create and podman run commands can now set options for created named volumes via the volume-opt parameter.
  * The --mount option to the podman create and podman run commands now allows parameters to be passed in CSV format.
  * The --userns option to the podman create and podman run commands now supports a new option, nomap, that (only for rootless containers) does not map the UID of the user that started the container into the container, increasing security.
  * The podman import command now supports three new options, --arch, --os, and --variant, to specify what system the imported image was built for.
  * The podman inspect command now includes information on the network configuration of containers that joined a pre-configured network namespace with the --net ns: option to podman run, podman create, and podman pod create.
  * The podman run and podman create commands now support a new option, --chrootdirs, which specifies additional locations where container-specific files managed by Podman (e.g. /etc/hosts, `/etc/resolv.conf, etc) will be mounted inside the container (#12961).
  * The podman run and podman create commands now support a new option, --passwd-entry, allowing entries to be added to the container's /etc/passwd file.
  * The podman images --format command now accepts two new format directives: {{.CreatedAt}} and {{.CreatedSince}}.
  * The podman volume create command's -o option now accepts a new argument, o=noquota, to disable XFS quotas entirely and avoid potential issues when Podman is run on an XFS filesystem with existing quotas defined.
  * The podman info command now includes additional information on the machine Podman is running on, including disk utilization on the drive Podman is storing containers and images on, and CPU utilization.
  * Fix CVE-2022-27191 / bsc#1197284

    did not have working port forwarding from the host (#12207).
  * Fixed a bug where the podman network reload command command on containers
    using the slirp4netns network mode and the rootlessport port forwarding
    driver would make an unnecessary attempt to restart rootlessport
    on containers that did not forward ports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 01 08:45:30 UTC 2021 - michael@stroeder.com

- Update to version 3.4.0:
  * Features
    - Pods now support init containers! Init containers are containers which run before the rest of the pod starts. There are two types of init containers: "always", which always run before the pod is started, and "once", which only run the first time the pod starts and are subsequently removed. They can be added using the podman create command's --init-ctr option.
    - Support for init containers has also been added to podman play kube and podman generate kube - init containers contained in Kubernetes YAML will be created as Podman init containers, and YAML generated by Podman will include any init containers created.
    - The podman play kube command now supports building images. If the --build option is given and a directory with the name of the specified image exists in the current working directory and contains a valid Containerfile or Dockerfile, the image will be built and used for the container.
    - The podman play kube command now supports a new option, --teardown, which removes any pods and containers created by the given Kubernetes YAML.
    - The podman generate kube command now generates annotations for SELinux mount options on volume (:z and :Z) that are respected by the podman play kube command.
    - A new command has been added, podman pod logs, to return logs for all containers in a pod at the same time.
    - Two new commands have been added, podman volume export (to export a volume to a tar file) and podman volume import) (to populate a volume from a given tar file).
    - The podman auto-update command now supports simple rollbacks. If a container fails to start after an automatic update, it will be rolled back to the previous image and restarted again.
    - Pods now share their user namespace by default, and the podman pod create command now supports the --userns option. This allows rootless pods to be created with the --userns=keep-id option.
    - The podman pod ps command now supports a new filter with its --filter option, until, which returns pods created before a given timestamp.
    - The podman image scp command has been added. This command allows images to be transferred between different hosts.
    - The podman stats command supports a new option, --interval, to specify the amount of time before the information is refreshed.
    - The podman inspect command now includes ports exposed (but not published) by containers (e.g. ports from --expose when --publish-all is not specified).
    - The podman inspect command now has a new boolean value, Checkpointed, which indicates that a container was stopped as a result of a podman container checkpoint operation.
    - Volumes created by podman volume create now support setting quotas when run atop XFS. The size and inode options allow the maximum size and maximum number of inodes consumed by a volume to be limited.
    - The podman info command now outputs information on what log drivers, network drivers, and volume plugins are available for use (#11265).
    - The podman info command now outputs the current log driver in use, and the variant and codename of the distribution in use.
    - The parameters of the VM created by podman machine init (amount of disk space, memory, CPUs) can now be set in containers.conf.
    - The podman machine ls command now shows additional information (CPUs, memory, disk size) about VMs managed by podman machine.
    - The podman ps command now includes healthcheck status in container state for containers that have healthchecks (#11527).
  * Changes
    - The podman build command has a new alias, podman buildx, to improve compatibility with Docker. We have already added support for many docker buildx flags to podman build and aim to continue to do so.
    - Cases where Podman is run without a user session or a writable temporary files directory will now produce better error messages.
    - The default log driver has been changed from file to journald. The file driver did not properly support log rotation, so this should lead to a better experience. If journald is not available on the system, Podman will automatically revert to the file.
    - Podman no longer depends on ip for removing networks (#11403).
    - The deprecated --macvlan flag to podman network create now warns when it is used. It will be removed entirely in the Podman 4.0 release.
    - The podman machine start command now prints a message when the VM is successfully started.
    - The podman stats command can now be used on containers that are paused.
    - The podman unshare command will now return the exit code of the command that was run in the user namespace (assuming the command was successfully run).
    - Successful healthchecks will no longer add a healthy line to the system log to reduce log spam.
    - As a temporary workaround for a lack of shortname prompts in the Podman remote client, VMs created by podman machine now default to only using the docker.io registry.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where whitespace in the definition of sysctls (particularly default sysctls specified in containers.conf) would cause them to be parsed incorrectly.
    - Fixed a bug where the Windows remote client improperly validated volume paths (#10900).
    - Fixed a bug where the first line of logs from a container run with the journald log driver could be skipped.
    - Fixed a bug where images created by podman commit did not include ports exposed by the container.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman auto-update command would ignore the io.containers.autoupdate.authfile label when pulling images (#11171).
    - Fixed a bug where the --workdir option to podman create and podman run could not be set to a directory where a volume was mounted (#11352).
    - Fixed a bug where systemd socket-activation did not properly work with systemd-managed Podman containers (#10443).
    - Fixed a bug where environment variable secrets added to a container were not available to exec sessions launched in the container.

- Update to v3.0.1
  * Changes
    - Several frequently-occurring WARN level log messages have been downgraded to INFO or DEBUG to not clutter terminal output.
Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where the Created field of podman ps --format=json was formatted as a string instead of an Unix timestamp (integer) (#9315).
    - Fixed a bug where failing lookups of individual layers during the podman images command would cause the whole command to fail without printing output.
    - Fixed a bug where --cgroups=split did not function properly on cgroups v1 systems.
    - Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over an directory in the container that existed, but was empty, could fail (#9393).
    - Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over a directory in the container that existed could copy the entirety of the container's rootfs, instead of just the directory mounted over, into the volume (#9415).
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would treat the --entrypoint=[""] option to podman run and podman create as a literal empty string in the entrypoint, when instead it should have been ignored (#9377).
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would set the HOME environment variable to "" when the container ran as a user without an assigned home directory (#9378).
    - Fixed a bug where specifying a pod infra image that had no tags (by using its ID) would cause podman pod create to panic (#9374).
    - Fixed a bug where the --runtime option was not properly handled by the podman build command (#9365).
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would incorrectly print an error message related to the remote API when the remote API was not in use and starting Podman failed.
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would change ownership of a container's working directory, even if it already existed (#9387).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd --new command would incorrectly escape %t when generating the path for the PID file (#9373).
    - Fixed a bug where Podman could, when run inside a Podman container with the host's containers/storage directory mounted into the container, erroneously detect a reboot and reset container state if the temporary directory was not also mounted in (#9191).
    - Fixed a bug where some options of the podman build command (including but not limited to --jobs) were nonfunctional (#9247).
  * API
    - Fixed a breaking change to the Libpod Wait API for Containers where the Conditions parameter changed type in Podman v3.0 (#9351).
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle forwarded ports that did not specify a host port.
    - Fixed a bug where the Libpod Wait endpoint for Containers could write duplicate headers after an error occurred.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Images would not pull images that already had a matching tag present locally, even if a more recent version was available at the registry (#9232).
    - The Compat Create endpoint for Images has had its compatibility with Docker improved, allowing its use with the docker-java library.
  * Misc
    - Updated Buildah to v1.19.4
    - Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.6
- Changes from v3.0.0
  * Features
    - Podman now features initial support for Docker Compose.
    - Added the podman rename command, which allows containers to be renamed after they are created (#1925).
    - The Podman remote client now supports the podman copy command.
    - A new command, podman network reload, has been added. This command will re-configure the network of all running containers, and can be used to recreate firewall rules lost when the system firewall was reloaded (e.g. via firewall-cmd --reload).
    - Podman networks now have IDs. They can be seen in podman network ls and can be used when removing and inspecting networks. Existing networks receive IDs automatically.
    - Podman networks now also support labels. They can be added via the --label option to network create, and podman network ls can filter labels based on them.
    - The podman network create command now supports setting bridge MTU and VLAN through the --opt option (#8454).
    - The podman container checkpoint and podman container restore commands can now checkpoint and restore containers that include volumes.
    - The podman container checkpoint command now supports the --with-previous and --pre-checkpoint options, and the podman container restore command now support the --import-previous option. These add support for two-step checkpointing with lowered dump times.
    - The podman push command can now push manifest lists. Podman will first attempt to push as an image, then fall back to pushing as a manifest list if that fails.
    - The podman generate kube command can now be run on multiple containers at once, and will generate a single pod containing all of them.
    - The podman generate kube and podman play kube commands now support Kubernetes DNS configuration, and will preserve custom DNS configuration when exporting or importing YAML (#9132).
    - The podman generate kube command now properly supports generating YAML for containers and pods creating using host networking (--net=host) (#9077).
    - The podman kill command now supports a --cidfile option to kill containers given a file containing the container's ID (#8443).
    - The podman pod create command now supports the --net=none option (#9165).
    - The podman volume create command can now specify volume UID and GID as options with the UID and GID fields passed to the the --opt option.
    - Initial support has been added for Docker Volume Plugins. Podman can now define available plugins in containers.conf and use them to create volumes with podman volume create --driver.
    - The podman run and podman create commands now support a new option, --platform, to specify the platform of the image to be used when creating the container.
    - The --security-opt option to podman run and podman create now supports the systempaths=unconfined option to unrestrict access to all paths in the container, as well as mask and unmask options to allow more granular restriction of container paths.
    - The podman stats --format command now supports a new format specified, MemUsageBytes, which prints the raw bytes of memory consumed by a container without human-readable formatting #8945.
    - The podman ps command can now filter containers based on what pod they are joined to via the pod filter (#8512).
    - The podman pod ps command can now filter pods based on what networks they are joined to via the network filter.
    The podman pod ps command can now print information on what networks a pod is joined to via the .Networks specifier to the --format option.
    - The podman system prune command now supports filtering what containers, pods, images, and volumes will be pruned.
    - The podman volume prune commands now supports filtering what volumes will be pruned.
    - The podman system prune command now includes information on space reclaimed (#8658).
    - The podman info command will now properly print information about packages in use on Gentoo and Arch systems.
    - The containers.conf file now contains an option for disabling creation of a new kernel keyring on container creation (#8384).
    - The podman image sign command can now sign multi-arch images by producing a signature for each image in a given manifest list.
    - The podman image sign command, when run as rootless, now supports per-user registry configuration files in $HOME/.config/containers/registries.d.
    - Configuration options for slirp4netns can now be set system-wide via the NetworkCmdOptions configuration option in containers.conf.
    - The MTU of slirp4netns can now be configured via the mtu= network command option (e.g. podman run --net slirp4netns:mtu=9000).
  * Security
    - A fix for CVE-2021-20199 / bsc#1181640 is included. Podman between v1.8.0 and v2.2.1 used 127.0.0.1 as the source address for all traffic forwarded into rootless containers by a forwarded port; this has been changed to address the issue.
  * Changes
    - Shortname aliasing support has now been turned on by default. All Podman commands that must pull an image will, if a TTY is available, prompt the user about what image to pull.
    - The podman load command no longer accepts a NAME[:TAG] argument. The presence of this argument broke CLI compatibility with Docker by making docker load commands unusable with Podman (#7387).
    - The Go bindings for the HTTP API have been rewritten with a focus on limiting dependency footprint and improving extensibility. Read more here.
    - The legacy Varlink API has been completely removed from Podman.
    - The default log level for Podman has been changed from Error to Warn.
    - The podman network create command can now create macvlan networks using the --driver macvlan option for Docker compatibility. The existing --macvlan flag has been deprecated and will be removed in Podman 4.0 some time next year.
    - The podman inspect command has had the LogPath and LogTag fields moved into the LogConfig structure (from the root of the Inspect structure). The maximum size of the log file is also included.
    - The podman generate systemd command no longer generates unit files using the deprecated KillMode=none option (#8615).
    - The podman stop command now releases the container lock while waiting for it to stop - as such, commands like podman ps will no longer block until podman stop completes (#8501).
    - Networks created with podman network create --internal no longer use the dnsname plugin. This configuration never functioned as expected.
    - Error messages for the remote Podman client have been improved when it cannot connect to a Podman service.
    - Error messages for podman run when an invalid SELinux is specified have been improved.
    - Rootless Podman features improved support for containers with a single user mapped into the rootless user namespace.
    - Pod infra containers now respect default sysctls specified in containers.conf allowing for advanced configuration of the namespaces they will share.
    - SSH public key handling for remote Podman has been improved.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where the podman history --no-trunc command would truncate the Created By field (#9120).
    - Fixed a bug where root containers that did not explicitly specify a CNI network to join did not generate an entry for the network in use in the Networks field of the output of podman inspect (#6618).
    - Fixed a bug where, under some circumstances, container working directories specified by the image (via the WORKDIR instruction) but not present in the image, would not be created (#9040).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd command would generate invalid unit files if the container was creating using a command line that included doubled braces ({{ and }}), e.g. --log-opt-tag={{.Name}} (#9034).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd --new command could generate unit files including invalid Podman commands if the container was created using merged short options (e.g. podman run -dt) (#8847).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd --new command could generate unit files that did not handle Podman commands including some special characters (e.g. $) (#9176
    - Fixed a bug where rootless containers joining CNI networks could not set a static IP address (#7842).
    - Fixed a bug where rootless containers joining CNI networks could not set network aliases (#8567).
    - Fixed a bug where the remote client could, under some circumstances, not include the Containerfile when sending build context to the server (#8374).
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman did not mount /sys as a new sysfs in some circumstances where it was acceptable.
    - Fixed a bug where rootless containers that both joined a user namespace and a CNI networks would cause a segfault. These options are incompatible and now return an error.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command did not properly handle CMD and ARGS from images (#8803).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command did not properly handle environment variables from images (#8608).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command did not properly print errors that occurred when starting containers.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command errored when hostNetwork was used (#8790).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command would always pull images when the :latest tag was specified, even if the image was available locally (#7838).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command did not properly handle SELinux configuration, rending YAML with custom SELinux configuration unusable (#8710).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman generate kube command incorrectly populated the args and command fields of generated YAML (#9211).
    - Fixed a bug where containers in a pod would create a duplicate entry in the pod's shared /etc/hosts file every time the container restarted (#8921).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman search --list-tags command did not support the --format option (#8740).
    - Fixed a bug where the http_proxy option in containers.conf was not being respected, and instead was set unconditionally to true (#8843).
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could, on systems with a recent Conmon and users with a long username, fail to attach to containers (#8798).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman images command would break and fail to display any images if an empty manifest list was present in storage (#8931).
    - Fixed a bug where locale environment variables were not properly passed on to Conmon.
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would not build on the MIPS architecture (#8782).
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to properly configure user namespaces for rootless containers when the user specified a --uidmap option that included a mapping beginning with UID 0.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman logs command using the k8s-file backend did not properly handle partial log lines with a length of 1 (#8879).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman logs command with the --follow option did not properly handle log rotation (#8733).
    - Fixed a bug where user-specified HOSTNAME environment variables were overwritten by Podman (#8886).
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would applied default sysctls from containers.conf in too many situations (e.g. applying network sysctls when the container shared its network with a pod).
    - Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly handle cases where a secondary image store was in use and an image was present in both the secondary and primary stores (#8176).
    - Fixed a bug where systemd-managed rootless Podman containers where the user in the container was not root could fail as the container's PID file was not accessible to systemd on the host (#8506).
    - Fixed a bug where the --privileged option to podman run and podman create would, under some circumstances, not disable Seccomp (#8849).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman exec command did not properly add capabilities when the container or exec session were run with --privileged.
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would use the --enable-sandbox option to slirp4netns unconditionally, even when pivot_root was disabled, rendering slirp4netns unusable when pivot_root was disabled (#8846).
    - Fixed a bug where podman build --logfile did not actually write the build's log to the logfile.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman system service command did not close STDIN, and could display user-interactive prompts (#8700).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman system reset command could, under some circumstances, remove all the contents of the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR directory (#8680).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman network create command created CNI configurations that did not include a default gateway (#8748).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman.service systemd unit provided by default used the wrong service type, and would cause systemd to not correctly register the service as started (#8751).
    - Fixed a bug where, if the TMPDIR environment variable was set for the container engine in containers.conf, it was being ignored.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman events command did not properly handle future times given to the --until option (#8694).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman logs command wrote container STDERR logs to STDOUT instead of STDERR (#8683).
    - Fixed a bug where containers created from an image with multiple tags would report that they were created from the wrong tag (#8547).

    - Fixed a bug where the --layers option to podman build was nonfunctional (#8643).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman system prune command did not act recursively, and thus would leave images, containers, pods, and volumes present that would be removed by a subsequent call to podman system prune (#7990).

  * Misc
    - Updated Buildah to v1.19.2
    - Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.5
    - Updated the containers/image library to v5.10.2
    - Updated the containers/common library to v0.33.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  5 18:14:52 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to v2.2.1
  * Changes
    - Due to a conflict with a previously-removed field, we were forced to
      modify the way image volumes (mounting images into containers using
      --mount type=image) were handled in the database.
      As a result, containers created in Podman 2.2.0 with image volume
       will not have them in v2.2.1, and these containers will need to be re-created.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would, on systems without the
      XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable defined, use an incorrect path
      for the PID file of the Podman pause process, causing Podman to fail
      to start (#8539).
    - Fixed a bug where containers created using Podman v1.7 and earlier were
      unusable in Podman due to JSON decode errors (#8613).
    - Fixed a bug where Podman could retrieve invalid cgroup paths, instead
      of erroring, for containers that were not running.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman system reset command would print a warning
      about a duplicate shutdown handler being registered.
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to mount sysfs in
      circumstances where it was not allowed; some OCI runtimes (notably
      crun) would fall back to alternatives and not fail, but others
      (notably runc) would fail to run containers.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman run and podman create commands would fail
      to create containers from untagged images (#8558).
    - Fixed a bug where remote Podman would prompt for a password even when
      the server did not support password authentication (#8498).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman exec command did not move the Conmon
      process for the exec session into the correct cgroup.
    - Fixed a bug where shell completion for the ancestor option to
      podman ps --filter did not work correctly.
    - Fixed a bug where detached containers would not properly clean themselves
      up (or remove themselves if --rm was set) if the Podman command that
      created them was invoked with --log-level=debug.
  * API
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not
      properly handle the Binds and Mounts parameters in HostConfig.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers
      ignored the Name query parameter.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not
      properly handle the "default" value for NetworkMode (this value is
      used extensively by docker-compose) (#8544).
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Build endpoint for Images would sometimes
      incorrectly use the target query parameter as the image's tag.
  * Misc
    - Podman v2.2.0 vendored a non-released, custom version of the
      github.com/spf13/cobra package; this has been reverted to the latest
      upstream release to aid in packaging.
    - Updated the containers/image library to v5.9.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  2 13:24:06 UTC 2020 - Richard Brown <rbrown@suse.com>

- Update to v2.2.0
 * Features
  - Experimental support for shortname aliasing has been added. This is not enabled by default, but can be turned on by setting the environment variable CONTAINERS_SHORT_NAME_ALIASING to on. Documentation is available here and here.
  - Initial support has been added for the podman network connect and podman network disconnect commands, which allow existing containers to modify what networks they are connected to. At present, these commands can only be used on running containers that did not specify --network=none when they were created.
  - The podman run command now supports the --network-alias option to set network aliases (additional names the container can be accessed at from other containers via DNS if the dnsname CNI plugin is in use). Aliases can also be added and removed using the new podman network connect and podman network disconnect commands. Please note that this requires a new release (v1.1.0) of the dnsname plugin, and will only work on newly-created CNI networks.
  - The podman generate kube command now features support for exporting container's memory and CPU limits (#7855).
  - The podman play kube command now features support for setting CPU and Memory limits for containers (#7742).
  - The podman play kube command now supports persistent volumes claims using Podman named volumes.
  - The podman play kube command now supports Kubernetes configmaps via the --configmap option (#7567).
  - The podman play kube command now supports a --log-driver option to set the log driver for created containers.
  - The podman play kube command now supports a --start option, enabled by default, to start the pod after creating it. This allows for podman play kube to be more easily used in systemd unitfiles.
  - The podman network create command now supports the --ipv6 option to enable dual-stack IPv6 networking for created networks (#7302).
  - The podman inspect command can now inspect pods, networks, and volumes, in addition to containers and images (#6757).
  - The --mount option for podman run and podman create now supports a new type, image, to mount the contents of an image into the container at a given location.
  - The Bash and ZSH completions have been completely reworked and have received significant enhancements! Additionally, support for Fish completions and completions for the podman-remote executable have been added.
  - The --log-opt option for podman create and podman run now supports the max-size option to set the maximum size for a container's logs (#7434).
  - The --network option to the podman pod create command now allows pods to be configured to use slirp4netns networking, even when run as root (#6097).
  - The podman pod stop, podman pod pause, podman pod unpause, and podman pod kill commands now work on multiple containers in parallel and should be significantly faster.
  - The podman search command now supports a --list-tags option to list all available tags for a single image in a single repository.
  - The podman search command can now output JSON using the --format=json option.
  - The podman diff and podman mount commands now work with all containers in the storage library, including those not created by Podman. This allows them to be used with Buildah and CRI-O containers.
  - The podman container exists command now features a --external option to check if a container exists not just in Podman, but also in the storage library. This will allow Podman to identify Buildah and CRI-O containers.
  - The --tls-verify and --authfile options have been enabled for use with remote Podman.
  - The /etc/hosts file now includes the container's name and hostname (both pointing to localhost) when the container is run with --net=none (#8095).
  - The podman events command now supports filtering events based on the labels of the container they occurred on using the --filter label=key=value option.
  - The podman volume ls command now supports filtering volumes based on their labels using the --filter label=key=value option.
  - The --volume and --mount options to podman run and podman create now support two new mount propagation options, unbindable and runbindable.
  - The name and id filters for podman pod ps now match based on a regular expression, instead of requiring an exact match.
  - The podman pod ps command now supports a new filter status, that matches pods in a certain state.
 * Changes
  - The podman network rm --force command will now also remove pods that are using the network (#7791).
  - The podman volume rm, podman network rm, and podman pod rm commands now return exit code 1 if the object specified for removal does not exist, and exit code 2 if the object is in use and the --force option was not given.
  - If /dev/fuse is passed into Podman containers as a device, Podman will open it before starting the container to ensure that the kernel module is loaded on the host and the device is usable in the container.
  - Global Podman options that were not supported with remote operation have been removed from podman-remote (e.g. --cgroup-manager, --storage-driver).
  - Many errors have been changed to remove repetition and be more clear as to what has gone wrong.
  - The --storage option to podman rm is now enabled by default, with slightly changed semantics. If the given container does not exist in Podman but does exist in the storage library, it will be removed even without the --storage option. If the container exists in Podman it will be removed normally. The --storage option for podman rm is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  - The --storage option to podman ps has been renamed to --external. An alias has been added so the old form of the option will continue to work.
  - Podman now delays the SIGTERM and SIGINT signals during container creation to ensure that Podman is not stopped midway through creating a container resulting in potential resource leakage (#7941).
  - The podman save command now strips signatures from images it is exporting, as the formats we export to do not support signatures (#7659).
  - A new Degraded state has been added to pods. Pods that have some, but not all, of their containers running are now considered to be Degraded instead of Running.
  - Podman will now print a warning when conflicting network options related to port forwarding (e.g. --publish and --net=host) are specified when creating a container.
  - The --restart on-failure and --rm options for containers no longer conflict. When both are specified, the container will be restarted if it exits with a non-zero error code, and removed if it exits cleanly (#7906).
  - Remote Podman will no longer use settings from the client's containers.conf; defaults will instead be provided by the server's containers.conf (#7657).
  - The podman network rm command now has a new alias, podman network remove (#8402).
 * Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where podman load on the remote client did not error when attempting to load a directory, which is not yet supported for remote use.
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could hang when the newuidmap binary was not installed (#7776).
  - Fixed a bug where the --pull option to podman run, podman create, and podman build did not match Docker's behavior.
  - Fixed a bug where sysctl settings from the containers.conf configuration file were applied, even if the container did not join the namespace associated with a sysctl.
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would not return the text of errors encounted when trying to run a healthcheck for a container.
  - Fixed a bug where Podman was accidentally setting the containers environment variable in addition to the expected container environment variable.
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman using CNI networking did not properly clean up DNS entries for removed containers (#7789).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman untag --all command was not supported with remote Podman.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman system service command could time out even if active attach connections were present (#7826).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman system service command would sometimes never time out despite no active connections being present.
  - Fixed a bug where Podman's handling of capabilities, specifically inheritable, did not match Docker's.
  - Fixed a bug where podman run would fail if the image specified was a manifest list and had already been pulled (#7798).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman did not take search registries into account when looking up images locally (#6381).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman manifest inspect command would fail for images that had already been pulled (#7726).
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add supplemental GIDs to containers when when a user, but not a group, was set via the --user option to podman create and podman run and sufficient GIDs were available to add the groups (#7782).
  - Fixed a bug where remote Podman commands did not properly handle cases where the user gave a name that could also be a short ID for a pod or container (#7837).
  - Fixed a bug where podman image prune could leave images ready to be pruned after podman image prune was run (#7872).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman logs command with the journald log driver would not read all available logs (#7476).
  - Fixed a bug where the --rm and --restart options to podman create and podman run did not conflict when a restart policy that is not on-failure was chosen (#7878).
  - Fixed a bug where the --format "table {{ .Field }}" option to numerous Podman commands ceased to function on Podman v2.0 and up.
  - Fixed a bug where pods did not properly share an SELinux label between their containers, resulting in containers being unable to see the processes of other containers when the pod shared a PID namespace (#7886).
  - Fixed a bug where the --namespace option to podman ps did not work with the remote client (#7903).
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman incorrectly calculated the number of UIDs available in the container if multiple different ranges of UIDs were specified.
  - Fixed a bug where the /etc/hosts file would not be correctly populated for containers in a user namespace (#7490).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman network create and podman network remove commands could race when run in parallel, with unpredictable results (#7807).
  - Fixed a bug where the -p option to podman run, podman create, and podman pod create would, when given only a single number (e.g. -p 80), assign the same port for both host and container, instead of generating a random host port (#7947).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman containers did not properly store the cgroup manager they were created with, causing them to stop functioning after the cgroup manager was changed in containers.conf or with the --cgroup-manager option (#7830).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman inspect command did not include information on the CNI networks a container was connected to if it was not running.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman attach command would not print a newline after detaching from the container (#7751).
  - Fixed a bug where the HOME environment variable was not set properly in containers when the --userns=keep-id option was set (#8004).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman container restore command could panic when the container in question was in a pod (#8026).
  - Fixed a bug where the output of the podman image trust show --raw command was not properly formatted.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman runlabel command could panic if a label to run was not given (#8038).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman run and podman start --attach commands would exit with an error when the user detached manually using the detach keys on remote Podman (#7979).
  - Fixed a bug where rootless CNI networking did not use the dnsname CNI plugin if it was not available on the host, despite it always being available in the container used for rootless networking (#8040).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly handle cases where an OCI runtime is specified by its full path, and could revert to using another OCI runtime with the same binary path that existed in the system $PATH on subsequent invocations.
  - Fixed a bug where the --net=host option to podman create and podman run would cause the /etc/hosts file to be incorrectly populated (#8054).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman inspect command did not include container network information when the container shared its network namespace (IE, joined a pod or another container's network namespace via --net=container:...) (#8073).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman ps command did not include information on all ports a container was publishing.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman build command incorrectly forwarded STDIN into build containers from RUN instructions.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman wait command's --interval option did not work when units were not specified for the duration (#8088).
  - Fixed a bug where the --detach-keys and --detach options could be passed to podman create despite having no effect (and not making sense in that context).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman could not start containers if running on a system without a /etc/resolv.conf file (which occurs on some WSL2 images) (#8089).
  - Fixed a bug where the --extract option to podman cp was nonfunctional.
  - Fixed a bug where the --cidfile option to podman run would, when the container was not run with --detach, only create the file after the container exited (#8091).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman images and podman images -a commands could panic and not list any images when certain improperly-formatted images were present in storage (#8148).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman events command could, when the journald events backend was in use, become nonfunctional when a badly-formatted event or a log message that container certain string was present in the journal (#8125).
  - Fixed a bug where remote Podman would, when using SSH transport, not authenticate to the server using hostkeys when connecting on a port other than 22 (#8139).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman attach command would not exit when containers stopped (#8154).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly clean paths before verifying them, resulting in Podman refusing to start if the root or temporary directories were specified with extra trailing / characters (#8160).
  - Fixed a bug where remote Podman did not support hashed hostnames in the known_hosts file on the host for establishing connections (#8159).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman image exists command would return non-zero (false) when multiple potential matches for the given name existed.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman manifest inspect command on images that are not manifest lists would error instead of inspecting the image (#8023).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman system service command would fail if the directory the Unix socket was to be created inside did not exist (#8184).
  - Fixed a bug where pods that shared the IPC namespace (which is done by default) did not share a /dev/shm filesystem between all containers in the pod (#8181).
  - Fixed a bug where filters passed to podman volume list were not inclusive (#6765).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman volume create command would fail when the volume's data directory already existed (as might occur when a volume was not completely removed) (#8253).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman run and podman create commands would deadlock when trying to create a container that mounted the same named volume at multiple locations (e.g. podman run -v testvol:/test1 -v testvol:/test2) (#8221).
  - Fixed a bug where the parsing of the --net option to podman build was incorrect (#8322).

  - Fixed a bug where the podman manifest create and podman manifest add commands on local images would drop any images in the manifest not pulled by the host.
  - Fixed a bug where networks made by podman network create did not include the tuning plugin, and as such did not support setting custom MAC addresses (#8385).
  - Fixed a bug where container healthchecks did not use $PATH when searching for the Podman executable to run the healthcheck.
  - Fixed a bug where the --ip-range option to podman network create did not properly handle non-classful subnets when calculating the last usable IP for DHCP assignment (#8448).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman container ps alias for podman ps was missing (#8445).
 * API
  - The Compat Create endpoint for Container has received a major refactor to share more code with the Libpod Create endpoint, and should be significantly more stable.
  - A Compat endpoint for exporting multiple images at once, GET /images/get, has been added (#7950).
  - The Compat Network Connect and Network Disconnect endpoints have been added.
  - Endpoints that deal with image registries now support a X-Registry-Config header to specify registry authentication configuration.

Mon Oct 26 14:08:32 UTC 2020 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- add dependency to timezone package or podman fails to build a
  container (bsc#1178122)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 30 14:07:34 UTC 2020 - rhafer@suse.com
- Added patch varlink.patch to disable needless varlink code
  generation. This would cause compile failures in OBS.
  (https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/7854)
- Cleanup %build section a bit and no longer build in GOPATH.
  This shouldn't be needed anymore.
- Path BUILDFLAGS via enviroment variable to allow it being
  appended to the corresponding Makefile variable instead of
  completely overriding it.
- Install new auto-update system units
- Update to v2.1.1 (bsc#1178392):
  * Changes
    - The `podman info` command now includes the cgroup manager
      Podman is using.
  * API
    - The REST API now includes a Server header in all responses.
    - Fixed a bug where the Libpod and Compat Attach endpoints
      could terminate early, before sending all output from the
      container.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers
      did not properly handle the Interactive parameter.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Kill endpoint for containers
      could continue to run after a fatal error.
    - Fixed a bug where the Limit parameter of the Compat List
      endpoint for Containers did not properly handle a limit of 0
      (returning nothing, instead of all containers) [#7722].
    - The Libpod Stats endpoint for containers is being deprecated
      and will be replaced by a similar endpoint with additional
      features in a future release.
- Changes in v2.1.0
  * Features
    - A new command, `podman image mount`, has been added. This
      allows for an image to be mounted, read-only, to inspect its
      contents without creating a container from it [#1433].
    - The `podman save` and `podman load` commands can now create
      and load archives containing multiple images [#2669].
    - Rootless Podman now supports all `podman network` commands,
      and rootless containers can now be joined to networks.
    - The performance of `podman build` on `ADD` and `COPY`
      instructions has been greatly improved, especially when a
      `.dockerignore` is present.
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a
      new mode for the `--cgroups` option, `--cgroups=split`.
      Podman will create two cgroups under the cgroup it was
      launched in, one for the container and one for Conmon. This
      mode is useful for running Podman in a systemd unit, as it
      ensures that all processes are retained in systemd's cgroup
      hierarchy [#6400].
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now specify
      options to slirp4netns by using the `--network` option as
      follows:  `--net slirp4netns:opt1,opt2`. This allows for,
      among other things, switching the port forwarder used by
      slirp4netns away from rootlessport.
    - The `podman ps` command now features a new option,
      `--storage`, to show containers from Buildah, CRI-O and other
      applications.
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a
      `--sdnotify` option to control the behavior of systemd's
      sdnotify with containers, enabling improved support for
      Podman in `Type=notify` units.
    - The `podman run` command now features a `--preserve-fds`
      opton to pass file descriptors from the host into the
      container [#6458].
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now create
      overlay volume mounts, by adding the `:O` option to a bind
      mount (e.g. `-v /test:/test:O`). Overlay volume mounts will
      mount a directory into a container from the host and allow
      changes to it, but not write those changes back to the
      directory on the host.
    - The `podman play kube` command now supports the Socket
      HostPath type [#7112].
    - The `podman play kube` command now supports read-only mounts.
    - The `podman play kube` command now supports setting labels on
      pods from Kubernetes metadata labels.
    - The `podman play kube` command now supports setting container
      restart policy [#7656].
    - The `podman play kube` command now properly handles
      `HostAlias` entries.
    - The `podman generate kube` command now adds entries to
      `/etc/hosts` from `--host-add` generated YAML as `HostAlias`
      entries.
    - The `podman play kube` and `podman generate kube` commands
      now properly support `shareProcessNamespace` to share the PID
      namespace in pods.
    - The `podman volume ls` command now supports the `dangling`
      filter to identify volumes that are dangling (not attached to
      any container).
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a
      `--umask` option to set the umask of the created container.
    - The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now feature a
      `--tz` option to set the timezone within the container [#5128].
    - Environment variables for Podman can now be added in the
      `containers.conf` configuration file.
    - The `--mount` option of `podman run` and `podman create` now
      supports a new mount type, `type=devpts`, to add a `devpts`
      mount to the container. This is useful for containers that
      want to mount `/dev/` from the host into the container, but
      still create a terminal.
    - The `--security-opt` flag to `podman run` and `podman create`
      now supports a new option, `proc-opts`, to specify options
      for the container's `/proc` filesystem.
    - Podman with the `crun` OCI runtime now supports a new option
      to `podman run` and `podman create`, `--cgroup-conf`, which
      allows for advanced configuration of cgroups on cgroups v2
      systems.
    - The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now support a
      `--override-variant` option, to override the architecture
      variant of the image that will be pulled and ran.
    - A new global option has been added to Podman,
      `--runtime-flags`, which allows for setting flags to use when
      the OCI runtime is called.
    - The `podman manifest add` command now supports the
      `--cert-dir`, `--auth-file`, `--creds`, and `--tls-verify`
      options.
  * Security
    - This release resolves CVE-2020-14370, in which environment
      variables could be leaked between containers created using
      the Varlink API.
  * Changes
    - Podman will now retry pulling an image 3 times if a pull
      fails due to network errors.
    - The `podman exec` command would previously print error
      messages (e.g. `exec session exited with non-zero exit code
      -1`) when the command run exited with a non-0 exit code. It
      no longer does this. The `podman exec` command will still
      exit with the same exit code as the command run in the
      container did.
    - Error messages when creating a container or pod with a name
      that is already in use have been improved.
    - For read-only containers running systemd init, Podman creates
      a tmpfs filesystem at `/run`. This was previously limited to
      65k in size and mounted `noexec`, but is now unlimited size
      and mounted `exec`.
    - The `podman system reset` command no longer removes
      configuration files for rootless Podman.
  * API
    - The Libpod API version has been bumped to v2.0.0 due to a
      breaking change in the Image List API.
    - Docker-compatible Volume Endpoints (Create, Inspect, List,
      Remove, Prune) are now available!
    - Added an endpoint for generating systemd unit files for
      containers.
    - The `last` parameter to the Libpod container list endpoint
      now has an alias, `limit` [#6413].
    - The Libpod image list API new returns timestamps in Unix
      format, as integer, as opposed to as strings
    - The Compat Inspect endpoint for containers now includes port
      information in NetworkSettings.
    - The Compat List endpoint for images now features limited
      support for the (deprecated) `filter` query parameter [#6797].
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers
      was not correctly handling bind mounts.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers
      would not return a 404 when the requested image was not
      present.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers
      did not properly handle Entrypoint and Command from images.
    - Fixed a bug where name history information was not properly
      added in the Libpod Image List endpoint.
    - Fixed a bug where the Libpod image search endpoint improperly
      populated the Description field of responses.
    - Added a `noTrunc` option to the Libpod image search endpoint.
    - Fixed a bug where the Pod List API would return null, instead
      of an empty array, when no pods were present [#7392].
    - Fixed a bug where endpoints that hijacked would do perform
      the hijack too early, before being ready to send and receive
      data [#7195].
    - Fixed a bug where Pod endpoints that can operate on multiple
      containers at once (e.g. Kill, Pause, Unpause, Stop) would
      not forward errors from individual containers that failed.
    - The Compat List endpoint for networks now supports filtering
      results [#7462].
    - Fixed a bug where the Top endpoint for pods would return both
      a 500 and 404 when run on a non-existant pod.
    - Fixed a bug where Pull endpoints did not stream progress back
      to the client.
    - The Version endpoints (Libpod and Compat) now provide version
      in a format compatible with Docker.
    - All non-hijacking responses to API requests should not
      include headers with the version of the server.
    - Fixed a bug where Libpod and Compat Events endpoints did not
      send response headers until the first event occurred [#7263].
    - Fixed a bug where the Build endpoints (Compat and Libpod) did
      not stream progress to the client.
    - Fixed a bug where the Stats endpoints (Compat and Libpod) did
      not properly handle clients disconnecting.
    - Fixed a bug where the Ignore parameter to the Libpod Stop
      endpoint was not performing properly.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Logs endpoint for containers did
      not stream its output in the correct format [#7196].

    is restarted if the container's /etc/passwd did not contain an entry
    for the user the container was started as.

    a non-root user would not start.
  * Fixed a bug where the --remote flag would sometimes not make
    remote connections and would instead attempt to run Podman locally.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 25 07:01:13 UTC 2020 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to v2.0.5 (bsc#1175821)

    - Podman now has a new global flag, --connection, to specify a connection to a remote Podman API instance.
  * Changes
    - Podman's automatic systemd integration (activated by the --systemd=true flag, set by default) will now activate for containers using /usr/local/sbin/init as their command, instead of just /usr/sbin/init and /sbin/init (and any path ending in systemd).
    - Seccomp profiles specified by the --security-opt seccomp=... flag to podman create and podman run will now be honored even if the container was created using --privileged.

    - Fixed a bug where the podman system service command, when run as a non-root user by Systemd, did not properly handle the Podman pause process and would not restart properly as a result (#7180).
    - Fixed a bug where the --publish flag to podman create, podman run, and podman pod create did not properly handle a host IP of 0.0.0.0 (attempting to bind to literal 0.0.0.0, instead of all IPs on the system) (#7104).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman start --attach command would not print the container's exit code when the command exited due to the container exiting.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman rm command with remote Podman would not remove volumes, even if the --volumes flag was specified (#7128).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman run command with remote Podman and the --rm flag could exit before the container was fully removed.
    - Fixed a bug where the --pod new:... flag to podman run and podman create would create a pod that did not share any namespaces.
    - Fixed a bug where the --preserve-fds flag to podman run and podman exec could close the wrong file descriptors while trying to close user-provided descriptors after passing them into the container.

    - Fixed a bug where Podman did not clear CMD from the container image if the user overrode ENTRYPOINT (#7115).
    - Fixed a bug where error parsing image names were not fully reported (part of the error message containing the exact issue was dropped).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman images command with remote Podman did not support printing image tags in Go templates supplied to the --format flag (#7123).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman rmi --force command would not attempt to unmount containers it was removing, which could cause a failure to remove the image.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd --new command could incorrectly quote arguments to Podman that contained whitespace, leading to nonfunctional unit files (#7285).

    - Fixed a bug where the libpod Exists endpoint would attempt to write a second header in some error conditions (#7197).
    - Fixed a bug where compat and libpod Network Inspect and Network Remove endpoints would return a 500 instead of 404 when the requested network was not found.
    - Added a versioned _ping endpoint (e.g. http://localhost/v1.40/_ping).
    - Fixed a bug where containers started through a systemd-managed instance of the REST API would be shut down when podman system service shut down due to its idle timeout (#7294).
    - Added stronger parameter verification for the libpod Network Create endpoint to ensure subnet mask is a valid value.

    container's output.
  * The `--mount` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` now
    accepts `readonly` option as an alias to `ro`.
  * The `podman generate systemd` command now supports the `--container-prefix`,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 29 06:34:51 UTC 2020 - Sascha Grunert <sgrunert@suse.com>

- Update podman to v1.9.1:
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where healthchecks could become nonfunctional if
      container log paths were manually set with --log-path and
      multiple container logs were placed in the same directory
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could, when using an older
      libpod.conf, print numerous warning messages about an invalid
      CGroup manager config
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would sometimes fail to
      close the rootless user namespace when joining it
  * Misc
    - Updated containers/common to v0.8.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 16 06:33:21 UTC 2020 - Sascha Grunert <sgrunert@suse.com>

- Switched to simple `make binaries` for building podman
- Update podman to v1.9.0:
  * Features
    - Experimental support has been added for podman run
      --userns=auto, which automatically allocates a unique UID and
      GID range for the new container's user namespace
    - The podman play kube command now has a --network flag to
      place the created pod in one or more CNI networks
    - The podman commit command now supports an --iidfile flag to
      write the ID of the committed image to a file
    - Initial support for the new containers.conf configuration
      file has been added. containers.conf allows for much more
      detailed configuration of some Podman functionality
  * Changes
    - There has been a major cleanup of the podman info command
      resulting in breaking changes. Many fields have been renamed
      to better suit usage with APIv2
    - All uses of the --timeout flag have been switched to prefer
      the alternative --time. The --timeout flag will continue to
      work, but man pages and --help will use the --time flag
      instead
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where some volume mounts from the host would
      sometimes not properly determine the flags they should use
      when mounting
    - Fixed a bug where Podman was not propagating $PATH to Conmon
      and the OCI runtime, causing issues for some OCI runtimes
      that required it
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would print error messages
      about missing support for systemd cgroups when run in a
      container with no cgroup support

      system directories if run as rootless on installations
      created by older Podman (#4831)
    - Fixed a bug where image built by podman build would not
      properly set the OS and Architecture they were built with
      (#5503)
    - Fixed a bug where attached podman run with --sig-proxy
      enabled (the default), when built with Go 1.14, would
      repeatedly send signal 23 to the process in the container and
      could generate errors when the container stopped (#5483)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless podman run commands could hang
      when forwarding ports
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not work when /proc
      was mounted with the hidepid option set

      did not depend on network targets, and so could start before
      the system network was ready (#4130)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 15:57:54 UTC 2020 - Ralf Haferkamp <rhafer@suse.com>

- The name of the cni-bridge in the default config changed from
  "cni0" to "podman-cni0" with podman-1.6.0. Add a %trigger to
  rename the bridge in the system to the new default if it exists.
  The trigger is only excuted when updating podman-cni-config
  from something older than 1.6.0. This is mainly needed for SLE
  where we're updating from 1.4.4 to 1.8.0 (bsc#1160460).

    - The fixes to runtime directory path as root can cause strange
      behavior if an upgrade is performed while containers are
      running
    - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.12.0
    - Updated vendored containers/storage library to v1.15.4
    - Updated vendored containers/image library to v5.1.0
    - Kata Containers runtimes (kata-runtime, kata-qemu, and
      kata-fc) are now present in the default libpod.conf, but will
      not be available unless Kata containers is installed on the
      system
    - Podman previously did not allow the creation of containers
      with a memory limit lower than 4MB. This restriction has been
      removed, as the crun runtime can create containers with
      significantly less memory
- Remove no longer needed workaround for *.5.md man page sources

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 07:21:29 UTC 2019 - Sascha Grunert <sgrunert@suse.com>

- Update podman to v1.6.2
  * Features
    - Added a --runtime flag to podman system migrate to allow the
      OCI runtime for all containers to be reset, to ease transition
      to the crun runtime on CGroups V2 systems until runc gains full
      support
    - The podman rm command can now remove containers in broken
      states which previously could not be removed
    - The podman info command, when run without root, now shows
      information on UID and GID mappings in the rootless user
      namespace
    - Added podman build --squash-all flag, which squashes all layers
      (including those of the base image) into one layer
    - The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create now accepts
      a string argument and allows a new value, always, which forces
      systemd support without checking if the the container
      entrypoint is systemd
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where the podman top command did not work on
      systems using CGroups V2 (#4192)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could double-close a file,
      leading to a panic
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to retrieve some
      containers while refreshing the state
    - Fixed a bug where podman start --attach --sig-proxy=false would
      still proxy signals into the container
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would unconditionally use a
      non-default path for authentication credentials (auth.json),
      breaking podman login integration with skopeo and other tools
      using the containers/image library
    - Fixed a bug where podman ps --format=json and podman images
      --format=json would display null when no results were returned,
      instead of valid JSON
    - Fixed a bug where podman build --squash was incorrectly
      squashing all layers into one, instead of only new layers
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would allow volumes with
      options to be mounted (mounting volumes requires root),
      creating an inconsistent state where volumes reported as
      mounted but were not (#4248)
    - Fixed a bug where volumes which failed to unmount could not be
      removed (#4247)
    - Fixed a bug where Podman incorrectly handled some errors
      relating to unmounted or missing containers in
      containers/storage
    - Fixed a bug where podman stats was broken on systems running
      CGroups V2 when run rootless (#4268)
    - Fixed a bug where the podman start command would print the
      short container ID, instead of the full ID
    - Fixed a bug where containers created with an OCI runtime that
      is no longer available (uninstalled or removed from the config
      file) would not appear in podman ps and could not be removed
      via podman rm
    - Fixed a bug where containers restored via podman container
      restore --import would retain the CGroup path of the original
      container, even if their container ID changed; thus, multiple
      containers created from the same checkpoint would all share the
      same CGroup
  * Misc
    - The default PID limit for containers is now set to 4096. It can
      be adjusted back to the old default (unlimited) by passing
      --pids-limit 0 to podman create and podman run
    - The podman start --attach command now automatically attaches
      STDIN if the container was created with -i
    - The podman network create command now validates network names
      using the same regular expression as container and pod names
    - The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create will now
      only enable systemd mode when the binary being run inside the
      container is /sbin/init, /usr/sbin/init, or ends in systemd
      (previously detected any path ending in init or systemd)
    - Updated vendored Buildah to 1.11.3
    - Updated vendored containers/storage to 1.13.5
    - Updated vendored containers/image to 4.0.1

      host when copying a symlink in the container that included a
      glob operator (#3829)

      would fail to start containers due to mount leaks
  * Misc
    - Significant changes were made to Podman volumes in this
      release. If you have pre-existing volumes, it is strongly
      recommended to run podman system renumber after upgrading.

    - Podman no longer sets a default size of 65kb for tmpfs
      filesystems
    - The default Podman CNI network has been renamed in an attempt
      to prevent conflicts with CRI-O when both are run on the same
      system. This should only take effect on system restart
    - The output of podman volume inspect has been more closely
      matched to docker volume inspect

      host for the container
    - The podman rm and podman rmi commands now use different exit
      codes to indicate 'no such container' and 'container is
      running' errors
    - Support for CGroups V2 through the crun OCI runtime has been
      greatly improved, allowing resource limits to be set for

- Add podman-remote varlink client
- Update podman to v1.4.4

      Docker compatability (#3340)
    - The podman diff command now supports the --latest flag
  * Bugfixes

      configuration if no rootless configuration was present for the user,
      breaking rootless Podman for new installations
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman's pause process would block SIGTERM,
      preventing graceful system shutdown and hanging until the system's init
      send SIGKILL
    - Fixed a bug where running Podman as root with sudo -E would not work after
      running rootless Podman at least once
    - Fixed a bug where options for tmpfs volumes added with the --tmpfs flag
      were being ignored
    - Fixed a bug where images with no layers could not properly be displayed
      and removed by Podman
    - Fixed a bug where locks were not properly freed on failure to create a
      container or pod
    - Fixed a bug where podman cp on a single file would create a directory at
      the target and place the file in it (#3384)

      hexadecimal address instead of a container's mounts

  * Misc
    - Updated containers/storage to v1.12.13

    - The --cgroup-manager flag to podman now shows the correct default setting
      in help if the default was overridden by libpod.conf

      is now supported as an alias for --log-driver=k8s-file. This is considered
      deprecated, and json-file will be moved to a new implementation in the
      future ([#3363](https://github.com/containers/libpo\
      d/issues/3363))
    - Podman's default libpod.conf file now allows the crun OCI runtime to be
      used if it is installed

- Do not compile commit hash into binary. `podman version` will not print
  the commit number as we are now following official releases.

- Change tar naming from commit to version to facilitate updates via the
  _service file.

- Update podman to v0.3.3.  This update includes several fixes and a new
  configuration file, libpod.conf.  By default, this config will be
  installed to /usr/share/containers and /etc/containers, whereas podman
  will always use the latter if present.  The config in
  /usr/share/containers can be used to check for new config options and
  will be replaced with each package update.  The libpod.conf config can
  be used to tweak some run-time paths of conmon, runc, etc., which is a
  more flexible approach than hard-coding those paths in podman.

  Changelog:
  * Update containers/image
  * Add restart to main podman manpage
  * Add podman restart to podman bash completions and commands
  * Make manpage more clear
