- Update podman to v1.8.2:
  * Features
    - Initial support for automatically updating containers managed
      via Systemd unit files has been merged. This allows
      containers to automatically upgrade if a newer version of
      their image becomes available
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where unit files generated by podman generate
      systemd --new would not force containers to detach, causing
      the unit to time out when trying to start
    - Fixed a bug where podman system reset could delete important
      system directories if run as rootless on installations
      created by older Podman (#4831)
    - Fixed a bug where image built by podman build would not
      properly set the OS and Architecture they were built with
      (#5503)
    - Fixed a bug where attached podman run with --sig-proxy
      enabled (the default), when built with Go 1.14, would
      repeatedly send signal 23 to the process in the container and
      could generate errors when the container stopped (#5483)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless podman run commands could hang
      when forwarding ports
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not work when /proc
      was mounted with the hidepid option set
    - Fixed a bug where the podman system service command would use
      large amounts of CPU when --timeout was set to 0 (#5531)
  * HTTP API
    - Initial support for Libpod endpoints related to creating and
      operating on image manifest lists has been added
    - The Libpod Healthcheck and Events API endpoints are now
      supported
    - The Swagger endpoint can now handle cases where no Swagger
      documentation has been generated
  * Misc
    - Updated Buildah to v1.14.3
    - Updated containers/storage to v1.16.5
    - Several performance improvements have been made to creating
      containers, which should somewhat improve the performance of
      podman create and podman run

      --no-healthcheck flag to disable healthchecks for a container
      (#5299)
    - Containers now recognize the io.containers.capabilities

      image to run. These capabilities will be used as long as they
      are more restrictive than the default capabilities used

      ([#5256](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5256))
    - Fixed a bug where trailing / characters in image volume
      definitions could cause them to not be overridden by a
      user-specified mount at the same location
      ([#5219](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5219))
    - Fixed a bug where the label option in libpod.conf, used to

      podman images --format=json were misnamed, which also broke
      Go template output for those fields
      ([#5110](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5110))
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman containers with ports
      forwarded could hang when started (#5182)

      validate image OS and architecture when starting containers
    - Fixed a bug where Bash completion for podman build -f would
      not list available files that could be built (#3878)
    - Fixed a bug where podman commit --change would perform
      incorrect validation, resulting in valid changes being
      rejected (#5148)

    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could segfault when passed
      a large number of file descriptors
    - Fixed a bug where the podman port command was incorrectly
      interpreting additional arguments as container names, instead
      of port numbers
    - Fixed a bug where units created by podman generate systemd
      did not depend on network targets, and so could start before
      the system network was ready (#4130)
    - Fixed a bug where exec sessions in containers which did not
      specify a user would not inherit supplemental groups added to
      the container via --group-add

      templates using the old name shou ld still work
    - The CreatedTime field to podman images --format=json has been
      renamed to CreatedAt as part of the fix for (#5110). Go
      templates using the old name should still work

      passwords are being passed in plaintext
    - Some common cases where Podman would deadlock have been fixed
      to warn the user that podman system renumber must be run to
      resolve the deadlock

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 16:26:16 UTC 2020 - Ralf Haferkamp <rhafer@suse.com>

- Added SLE specific README.SUSE about current support status
  (jsc#SLE-9112, jsc#CAASP-60)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 15:40:12 UTC 2020 - Richard Brown <rbrown@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 15:57:54 UTC 2020 - Ralf Haferkamp <rhafer@suse.com>

- The name of the cni-bridge in the default config changed from
  "cni0" to "podman-cni0" with podman-1.6.0. Add a %trigger to
  rename the bridge in the system to the new default if it exists.
  The trigger is only excuted when updating podman-cni-config
  from something older than 1.6.0. This is mainly needed for SLE
  where we're updating from 1.4.4 to 1.8.0 (bsc#1160460).

      systemd service on systems using CGroups v2
    - Fixed a bug where podman inspect would show CPUShares as 0,

    - Fixed a bug where podman-remote push would segfault
    - Fixed a bug where image healthchecks were not shown in the
      output of podman inspect
    - Fixed a bug where named volumes created with containers from

    - Fixed a bug where podman history was not computing image
      sizes correctly
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would not error on invalid values to

      differently from podman stop; podman start
    - Fixed a bug where setting the --memory-swap flag to podman
      create and podman run to -1 (to indicate unlimited) was not
      supported
  * Misc
    - Initial work on version 2 of the Podman remote API has been
      merged, but is still in an alpha state and not ready for use.

      --mount type=tmpfs flags to podman create and podman run to
      control whether the content of directories are copied into
      tmpfs filesystems mounted over them
    - Added support for disabling detaching from containers by

      containers were present in the pods and the --force flag was
      not passed (#4346)

      print the size of the container's read/write layer if the
      size was 0 (#4744)
    - Fixed a bug where the podman kill command was not properly
      validating signals before use (#4746)
    - Fixed a bug where the --quiet and --format flags to podman ps
      could not be used at the same time

      automatically removed on being stopped if an exec session was
      running inside the container (#4666)
  * Misc

      behavior if an upgrade is performed while containers are
      running
    - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.12.0
    - Updated vendored containers/storage library to v1.15.4
    - Updated vendored containers/image library to v5.1.0

      not be available unless Kata containers is installed on the
      system
    - Podman previously did not allow the creation of containers
      with a memory limit lower than 4MB. This restriction has been
      removed, as the crun runtime can create containers with
      significantly less memory
- Remove no longer needed workaround for *.5.md man page sources

- Update podman to v1.6.2
  * Features
    - Added a --runtime flag to podman system migrate to allow the
      OCI runtime for all containers to be reset, to ease transition
      to the crun runtime on CGroups V2 systems until runc gains full
      support
    - The podman rm command can now remove containers in broken
      states which previously could not be removed
    - The podman info command, when run without root, now shows
      information on UID and GID mappings in the rootless user
      namespace
    - Added podman build --squash-all flag, which squashes all layers
      (including those of the base image) into one layer
    - The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create now accepts
      a string argument and allows a new value, always, which forces
      systemd support without checking if the the container
      entrypoint is systemd
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where the podman top command did not work on
      systems using CGroups V2 (#4192)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could double-close a file,
      leading to a panic
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to retrieve some
      containers while refreshing the state
    - Fixed a bug where podman start --attach --sig-proxy=false would
      still proxy signals into the container
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would unconditionally use a
      non-default path for authentication credentials (auth.json),
      breaking podman login integration with skopeo and other tools
      using the containers/image library
    - Fixed a bug where podman ps --format=json and podman images
      --format=json would display null when no results were returned,
      instead of valid JSON
    - Fixed a bug where podman build --squash was incorrectly
      squashing all layers into one, instead of only new layers
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would allow volumes with
      options to be mounted (mounting volumes requires root),
      creating an inconsistent state where volumes reported as
      mounted but were not (#4248)
    - Fixed a bug where volumes which failed to unmount could not be
      removed (#4247)
    - Fixed a bug where Podman incorrectly handled some errors
      relating to unmounted or missing containers in
      containers/storage
    - Fixed a bug where podman stats was broken on systems running
      CGroups V2 when run rootless (#4268)
    - Fixed a bug where the podman start command would print the
      short container ID, instead of the full ID
    - Fixed a bug where containers created with an OCI runtime that
      is no longer available (uninstalled or removed from the config
      file) would not appear in podman ps and could not be removed
      via podman rm
    - Fixed a bug where containers restored via podman container
      restore --import would retain the CGroup path of the original
      container, even if their container ID changed; thus, multiple
      containers created from the same checkpoint would all share the
      same CGroup
  * Misc
    - The default PID limit for containers is now set to 4096. It can
      be adjusted back to the old default (unlimited) by passing
      --pids-limit 0 to podman create and podman run
    - The podman start --attach command now automatically attaches
      STDIN if the container was created with -i
    - The podman network create command now validates network names
      using the same regular expression as container and pod names
    - The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create will now
      only enable systemd mode when the binary being run inside the
      container is /sbin/init, /usr/sbin/init, or ends in systemd
      (previously detected any path ending in init or systemd)
    - Updated vendored Buildah to 1.11.3
    - Updated vendored containers/storage to 1.13.5
    - Updated vendored containers/image to 4.0.1

      with podman create and podman run. This is presently only
      supported with the crun OCI runtime
    - The podman volume rm and podman volume inspect commands can now
      refer to volumes by an unambiguous partial name, in addition to
      full name (e.g. podman volume rm myvol to remove a volume named
      myvolume) (#3891)

      host when copying a symlink in the container that included a
      glob operator (#3829)

      (#4162)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman with slirp4netns networking
      would fail to start containers due to mount leaks
  * Misc
    - Significant changes were made to Podman volumes in this
      release. If you have pre-existing volumes, it is strongly
      recommended to run podman system renumber after upgrading.
    - Version 0.8.1 or greater of the CNI Plugins is now required for
      Podman
    - Version 2.0.1 or greater of Conmon is strongly recommended

      slirp4netns and fuse-overlayfs if they are available
    - Podman no longer sets a default size of 65kb for tmpfs
      filesystems
    - The default Podman CNI network has been renamed in an attempt
      to prevent conflicts with CRI-O when both are run on the same
      system. This should only take effect on system restart
    - The output of podman volume inspect has been more closely
      matched to docker volume inspect

      an arbitary path with --userns=ns:$PATH
    - Rootless Podman can experimentally squash all UIDs and GIDs in

      host for the container
    - The podman rm and podman rmi commands now use different exit
      codes to indicate 'no such container' and 'container is
      running' errors
    - Support for CGroups V2 through the crun OCI runtime has been
      greatly improved, allowing resource limits to be set for
      rootless containers when the CGroups V2 hierarchy is in use
  * Bugfixes

      to fail to start containers with ports
    - Fixed a bug where containers restored from a checkpoint would

      set in imported YAML (#3689)
    - Fixed a bug where podman run --env, when passed a single key

Mon Jul  8 10:46:43 UTC 2019 - Marco Vedovati <mvedovati@suse.com>

- Add podman-remote varlink client
- Update podman to v1.4.4
  * Features
    - Podman now has greatly improved support for containers using multiple OCI
      runtimes. Containers now remember if they were created with a different
      runtime using --runtime and will always use that runtime
    - The cached and delegated options for volume mounts are now allowed for
      Docker compatability (#3340)
    - The podman diff command now supports the --latest flag
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to use the entire root
      configuration if no rootless configuration was present for the user,
      breaking rootless Podman for new installations
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman's pause process would block SIGTERM,
      preventing graceful system shutdown and hanging until the system's init
      send SIGKILL
    - Fixed a bug where running Podman as root with sudo -E would not work after
      running rootless Podman at least once
    - Fixed a bug where options for tmpfs volumes added with the --tmpfs flag
      were being ignored
    - Fixed a bug where images with no layers could not properly be displayed
      and removed by Podman
    - Fixed a bug where locks were not properly freed on failure to create a
      container or pod
    - Fixed a bug where podman cp on a single file would create a directory at
      the target and place the file in it (#3384)
    - Fixed a bug where podman inspect --format '{{.Mounts}}' would print a
      hexadecimal address instead of a container's mounts
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add an entry to container's
      /etc/hosts files for their own hostname (#3405)
    - Fixed a bug where podman ps --sync would segfault (#3411)
    - Fixed a bug where podman generate kube would produce an invalid ports
      configuration (#3408)
  * Misc
    - Updated containers/storage to v1.12.13
    - Podman now performs much better on systems with heavy I/O load
    - The --cgroup-manager flag to podman now shows the correct default setting
      in help if the default was overridden by libpod.conf
    - For backwards compatability, setting --log-driver=json-file in podman run
      is now supported as an alias for --log-driver=k8s-file. This is considered
      deprecated, and json-file will be moved to a new implementation in the
      future ([#3363](https://github.com/containers/libpo\
      d/issues/3363))
    - Podman's default libpod.conf file now allows the crun OCI runtime to be

- Do not compile commit hash into binary. `podman version` will not print
  the commit number as we are now following official releases.

- Change tar naming from commit to version to facilitate updates via the
  _service file.

- Update podman to v0.3.3.  This update includes several fixes and a new
  configuration file, libpod.conf.  By default, this config will be
  installed to /usr/share/containers and /etc/containers, whereas podman
  will always use the latter if present.  The config in
  /usr/share/containers can be used to check for new config options and
  will be replaced with each package update.  The libpod.conf config can
  be used to tweak some run-time paths of conmon, runc, etc., which is a
  more flexible approach than hard-coding those paths in podman.

  Changelog:
  * Update containers/image
  * Add restart to main podman manpage
  * Add podman restart to podman bash completions and commands
  * Make manpage more clear
