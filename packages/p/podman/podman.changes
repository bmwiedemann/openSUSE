Mon Oct 26 14:08:32 UTC 2020 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- add dependency to timezone package or podman fails to build a 
  container (bsc#1178122)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 30 14:07:34 UTC 2020 - rhafer@suse.com
- Added patch varlink.patch to disable needless varlink code
  generation. This would cause compile failures in OBS.
  (https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/7854)
- Cleanup %build section a bit and no longer build in GOPATH.
  This shouldn't be needed anymore.
- Path BUILDFLAGS via enviroment variable to allow it being
  appended to the corresponding Makefile variable instead of
  completely overriding it.
- Install new auto-update system units
- Update to v2.1.1:
  * Changes
    - The `podman info` command now includes the cgroup manager
      Podman is using.
  * API
    - The REST API now includes a Server header in all responses.
    - Fixed a bug where the Libpod and Compat Attach endpoints
      could terminate early, before sending all output from the
      container.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers
      did not properly handle the Interactive parameter.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Kill endpoint for containers
      could continue to run after a fatal error.
    - Fixed a bug where the Limit parameter of the Compat List
      endpoint for Containers did not properly handle a limit of 0
      (returning nothing, instead of all containers) [#7722].
    - The Libpod Stats endpoint for containers is being deprecated
      and will be replaced by a similar endpoint with additional
      features in a future release.
- Changes in v2.1.0
  * Features
    - A new command, `podman image mount`, has been added. This
      allows for an image to be mounted, read-only, to inspect its
      contents without creating a container from it [#1433].
    - The `podman save` and `podman load` commands can now create
      and load archives containing multiple images [#2669].
    - Rootless Podman now supports all `podman network` commands,
      and rootless containers can now be joined to networks.
    - The performance of `podman build` on `ADD` and `COPY`
      instructions has been greatly improved, especially when a
      `.dockerignore` is present.
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a
      new mode for the `--cgroups` option, `--cgroups=split`.
      Podman will create two cgroups under the cgroup it was
      launched in, one for the container and one for Conmon. This
      mode is useful for running Podman in a systemd unit, as it
      ensures that all processes are retained in systemd's cgroup
      hierarchy [#6400].
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now specify
      options to slirp4netns by using the `--network` option as
      follows:  `--net slirp4netns:opt1,opt2`. This allows for,
      among other things, switching the port forwarder used by
      slirp4netns away from rootlessport.
    - The `podman ps` command now features a new option,
      `--storage`, to show containers from Buildah, CRI-O and other
      applications.
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a
      `--sdnotify` option to control the behavior of systemd's
      sdnotify with containers, enabling improved support for
      Podman in `Type=notify` units.
    - The `podman run` command now features a `--preserve-fds`
      opton to pass file descriptors from the host into the
      container [#6458].
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now create
      overlay volume mounts, by adding the `:O` option to a bind
      mount (e.g. `-v /test:/test:O`). Overlay volume mounts will
      mount a directory into a container from the host and allow
      changes to it, but not write those changes back to the
      directory on the host.
    - The `podman play kube` command now supports the Socket
      HostPath type [#7112].
    - The `podman play kube` command now supports read-only mounts.
    - The `podman play kube` command now supports setting labels on
      pods from Kubernetes metadata labels.
    - The `podman play kube` command now supports setting container
      restart policy [#7656].
    - The `podman play kube` command now properly handles
      `HostAlias` entries.
    - The `podman generate kube` command now adds entries to
      `/etc/hosts` from `--host-add` generated YAML as `HostAlias`
      entries.
    - The `podman play kube` and `podman generate kube` commands
      now properly support `shareProcessNamespace` to share the PID
      namespace in pods.
    - The `podman volume ls` command now supports the `dangling`
      filter to identify volumes that are dangling (not attached to
      any container).
    - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a
      `--umask` option to set the umask of the created container.
    - The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now feature a
      `--tz` option to set the timezone within the container [#5128].
    - Environment variables for Podman can now be added in the
      `containers.conf` configuration file.
    - The `--mount` option of `podman run` and `podman create` now
      supports a new mount type, `type=devpts`, to add a `devpts`
      mount to the container. This is useful for containers that
      want to mount `/dev/` from the host into the container, but
      still create a terminal.
    - The `--security-opt` flag to `podman run` and `podman create`
      now supports a new option, `proc-opts`, to specify options
      for the container's `/proc` filesystem.
    - Podman with the `crun` OCI runtime now supports a new option
      to `podman run` and `podman create`, `--cgroup-conf`, which
      allows for advanced configuration of cgroups on cgroups v2
      systems.
    - The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now support a
      `--override-variant` option, to override the architecture
      variant of the image that will be pulled and ran.
    - A new global option has been added to Podman,
      `--runtime-flags`, which allows for setting flags to use when
      the OCI runtime is called.
    - The `podman manifest add` command now supports the
      `--cert-dir`, `--auth-file`, `--creds`, and `--tls-verify`
      options.
  * Security
    - This release resolves CVE-2020-14370, in which environment
      variables could be leaked between containers created using
      the Varlink API.
  * Changes
    - Podman will now retry pulling an image 3 times if a pull
      fails due to network errors.
    - The `podman exec` command would previously print error
      messages (e.g. `exec session exited with non-zero exit code
      -1`) when the command run exited with a non-0 exit code. It
      no longer does this. The `podman exec` command will still
      exit with the same exit code as the command run in the
      container did.
    - Error messages when creating a container or pod with a name
      that is already in use have been improved.
    - For read-only containers running systemd init, Podman creates
      a tmpfs filesystem at `/run`. This was previously limited to
      65k in size and mounted `noexec`, but is now unlimited size
      and mounted `exec`.
    - The `podman system reset` command no longer removes
      configuration files for rootless Podman.
  * API
    - The Libpod API version has been bumped to v2.0.0 due to a
      breaking change in the Image List API.
    - Docker-compatible Volume Endpoints (Create, Inspect, List,
      Remove, Prune) are now available!
    - Added an endpoint for generating systemd unit files for
      containers.
    - The `last` parameter to the Libpod container list endpoint
      now has an alias, `limit` [#6413].
    - The Libpod image list API new returns timestamps in Unix
      format, as integer, as opposed to as strings
    - The Compat Inspect endpoint for containers now includes port
      information in NetworkSettings.
    - The Compat List endpoint for images now features limited
      support for the (deprecated) `filter` query parameter [#6797].
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers
      was not correctly handling bind mounts.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers
      would not return a 404 when the requested image was not
      present.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers
      did not properly handle Entrypoint and Command from images.
    - Fixed a bug where name history information was not properly
      added in the Libpod Image List endpoint.
    - Fixed a bug where the Libpod image search endpoint improperly
      populated the Description field of responses.
    - Added a `noTrunc` option to the Libpod image search endpoint.
    - Fixed a bug where the Pod List API would return null, instead
      of an empty array, when no pods were present [#7392].
    - Fixed a bug where endpoints that hijacked would do perform
      the hijack too early, before being ready to send and receive
      data [#7195].
    - Fixed a bug where Pod endpoints that can operate on multiple
      containers at once (e.g. Kill, Pause, Unpause, Stop) would
      not forward errors from individual containers that failed.
    - The Compat List endpoint for networks now supports filtering
      results [#7462].
    - Fixed a bug where the Top endpoint for pods would return both
      a 500 and 404 when run on a non-existant pod.
    - Fixed a bug where Pull endpoints did not stream progress back
      to the client.
    - The Version endpoints (Libpod and Compat) now provide version
      in a format compatible with Docker.
    - All non-hijacking responses to API requests should not
      include headers with the version of the server.
    - Fixed a bug where Libpod and Compat Events endpoints did not
      send response headers until the first event occurred [#7263].
    - Fixed a bug where the Build endpoints (Compat and Libpod) did
      not stream progress to the client.
    - Fixed a bug where the Stats endpoints (Compat and Libpod) did
      not properly handle clients disconnecting.
    - Fixed a bug where the Ignore parameter to the Libpod Stop
      endpoint was not performing properly.
    - Fixed a bug where the Compat Logs endpoint for containers did
      not stream its output in the correct format [#7196].

    - The podman system connection command has been reworked to support multiple connections, and reenabled for use!
    - Podman now has a new global flag, --connection, to specify a connection to a remote Podman API instance.
  * Changes
    - Podman's automatic systemd integration (activated by the --systemd=true flag, set by default) will now activate for containers using /usr/local/sbin/init as their command, instead of just /usr/sbin/init and /sbin/init (and any path ending in systemd).
    - Seccomp profiles specified by the --security-opt seccomp=... flag to podman create and podman run will now be honored even if the container was created using --privileged.

    - Fixed a bug where the podman system service command, when run as a non-root user by Systemd, did not properly handle the Podman pause process and would not restart properly as a result (#7180).
    - Fixed a bug where the --publish flag to podman create, podman run, and podman pod create did not properly handle a host IP of 0.0.0.0 (attempting to bind to literal 0.0.0.0, instead of all IPs on the system) (#7104).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman start --attach command would not print the container's exit code when the command exited due to the container exiting.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman rm command with remote Podman would not remove volumes, even if the --volumes flag was specified (#7128).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman run command with remote Podman and the --rm flag could exit before the container was fully removed.
    - Fixed a bug where the --pod new:... flag to podman run and podman create would create a pod that did not share any namespaces.
    - Fixed a bug where the --preserve-fds flag to podman run and podman exec could close the wrong file descriptors while trying to close user-provided descriptors after passing them into the container.
    - Fixed a bug where default environment variables ($PATH and $TERM) were not set in containers when not provided by the image.

    - Fixed a bug where the podman images command with remote Podman did not support printing image tags in Go templates supplied to the --format flag (#7123).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman rmi --force command would not attempt to unmount containers it was removing, which could cause a failure to remove the image.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd --new command could incorrectly quote arguments to Podman that contained whitespace, leading to nonfunctional unit files (#7285).

    - Fixed a bug where the libpod Exists endpoint would attempt to write a second header in some error conditions (#7197).
    - Fixed a bug where compat and libpod Network Inspect and Network Remove endpoints would return a 500 instead of 404 when the requested network was not found.
    - Added a versioned _ping endpoint (e.g. http://localhost/v1.40/_ping).
    - Fixed a bug where containers started through a systemd-managed instance of the REST API would be shut down when podman system service shut down due to its idle timeout (#7294).
    - Added stronger parameter verification for the libpod Network Create endpoint to ensure subnet mask is a valid value.

    not completely remove containers using the image (#7153).
  * Fixed a bug where memory usage in bytes and memory use
    percentage were swapped in the output of podman stats
    --format=json.
  * Fixed a bug where the libpod and compat events endpoints would
    fail if no filters were specified (#7078).

Mon Jun 22 14:55:23 UTC 2020 - Ralf Haferkamp <rhafer@suse.com>

- Update to podman v2.0.0
  * The `podman generate systemd` command now supports the `--new`
    flag when used with pods, allowing portable services for pods
    to be created.
  * The `podman play kube` command now supports running Kubernetes
    Deployment YAML.
  * The `podman exec` command now supports the `--detach` flag to
    run commands in the container in the background.
  * The `-p` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports
    forwarding ports to IPv6 addresses.
  * The `podman run`, `podman create` and `podman pod create`
    command now support a `--replace` flag to remove and replace any
    existing container (or, for `pod create`, pod) with the same name
  * The `--restart-policy` flag to `podman run` and `podman create`
    now supports the `unless-stopped` restart policy.
  * The `--log-driver` flag to `podman run` and `podman create`
    now supports the `none` driver, which does not log the
    container's output.
  * The `--mount` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` now
    accepts `readonly` option as an alias to `ro`.
  * The `podman generate systemd` command now supports the `--container-prefix`,
    `--pod-prefix`, and `--separator` arguments to control the
    name of generated unit files.
  * The `podman network ls` command now supports the `--filter`
    flag to filter results.
  * The `podman auto-update` command now supports specifying an
    authfile to use when pulling new images on a per-container
    basis using the `io.containers.autoupdate.authfile` label.
  * Fixed a bug where the `podman exec` command would log to journald
    when run in containers loggined to journald
    ([#6555](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6555)).
  * Fixed a bug where the `podman auto-update` command would not
    preserve the OS and architecture of the original image when
    pulling a replacement
    ([#6613](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6613)).
  * Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` command could create an extra
    `merged` directory when copying into an existing directory
    ([#6596](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6596)).
  * Fixed a bug where the `podman pod stats` command would crash
    on pods run with `--network=host`
    ([#5652](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5652)).
  * Fixed a bug where containers logs written to journald did not
    include the name of the container.
  * Fixed a bug where the `podman network inspect` and
    `podman network rm` commands did not properly handle non-default
    CNI configuration paths ([#6212](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6212)).
  * Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly remove containers
    when using the Kata containers OCI runtime.
  * Fixed a bug where `podman inspect` would sometimes incorrectly
    report the network mode of containers started with `--net=none`.
  * Podman is now better able to deal with cases where `conmon`
    is killed before the container it is monitoring.
- Requires go 1.13 now

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 25 11:32:32 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to podman v1.9.3:

    were not properly mounted into containers
  * Fixed a bug where builds run over Varlink would hang
  * Fixed a bug where podman save would fail when the target
    image was specified by digest
  * Fixed a bug where rootless containers with ports forwarded to them
    could panic and dump core due to a concurrency issue (#6018)
  * Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could race when opening the
    rootless user namespace, resulting in commands failing to run
  * Fixed a bug where HTTP proxy environment variables forwarded into
    the container by the --http-proxy flag could not be overridden by --env or --env-file
  * Fixed a bug where rootless Podman was setting resource limits on cgroups
    v2 systems that were not using systemd-managed cgroups
    (and thus did not support resource limits), resulting in containers failing to start


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 29 06:34:51 UTC 2020 - Sascha Grunert <sgrunert@suse.com>

- Update podman to v1.9.1:
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where healthchecks could become nonfunctional if
      container log paths were manually set with --log-path and
      multiple container logs were placed in the same directory
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could, when using an older
      libpod.conf, print numerous warning messages about an invalid
      CGroup manager config
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would sometimes fail to
      close the rootless user namespace when joining it
  * Misc
    - Updated containers/common to v0.8.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 16 06:33:21 UTC 2020 - Sascha Grunert <sgrunert@suse.com>

- Switched to simple `make binaries` for building podman
- Update podman to v1.9.0:
  * Features
    - Experimental support has been added for podman run
      --userns=auto, which automatically allocates a unique UID and
      GID range for the new container's user namespace
    - The podman play kube command now has a --network flag to
      place the created pod in one or more CNI networks
    - The podman commit command now supports an --iidfile flag to
      write the ID of the committed image to a file
    - Initial support for the new containers.conf configuration
      file has been added. containers.conf allows for much more
      detailed configuration of some Podman functionality
  * Changes
    - There has been a major cleanup of the podman info command
      resulting in breaking changes. Many fields have been renamed
      to better suit usage with APIv2
    - All uses of the --timeout flag have been switched to prefer
      the alternative --time. The --timeout flag will continue to
      work, but man pages and --help will use the --time flag
      instead
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where some volume mounts from the host would
      sometimes not properly determine the flags they should use
      when mounting
    - Fixed a bug where Podman was not propagating $PATH to Conmon
      and the OCI runtime, causing issues for some OCI runtimes
      that required it
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would print error messages
      about missing support for systemd cgroups when run in a
      container with no cgroup support

      pruning containers in the created and configured states
    - Fixed a bug where Podman was not properly removing CNI IP
      address allocations after a reboot (#5433)
    - Fixed a bug where Podman was not properly applying the
      default Seccomp profile when --security-opt was not given at
      the command line
  * HTTP API
    - Many Libpod API endpoints have been added, including Changes,
      Checkpoint, Init, and Restore
    - Resolved issues where the podman system service command would
      time out and exit while there were still active connections
    - Stability overall has greatly improved as we prepare the API
      for a beta release soon with Podman 2.0
  * Misc
    - The default infra image for pods has been upgraded to
      k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2 (from 3.1) to address a bug in the
      architecture metadata for non-AMD64 images
    - The slirp4netns networking utility in rootless Podman now
      uses Seccomp filtering where available for improved security
    - Updated Buildah to v1.14.8
    - Updated containers/storage to v1.18.2
    - Updated containers/image to v5.4.3
    - Updated containers/common to v0.8.1

  (bsc#1167850)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 20 07:56:22 UTC 2020 - Sascha Grunert <sgrunert@suse.com>

- Update podman to v1.8.2:
  * Features
    - Initial support for automatically updating containers managed
      via Systemd unit files has been merged. This allows
      containers to automatically upgrade if a newer version of
      their image becomes available
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where unit files generated by podman generate
      systemd --new would not force containers to detach, causing
      the unit to time out when trying to start
    - Fixed a bug where podman system reset could delete important
      system directories if run as rootless on installations
      created by older Podman (#4831)
    - Fixed a bug where image built by podman build would not
      properly set the OS and Architecture they were built with
      (#5503)
    - Fixed a bug where attached podman run with --sig-proxy
      enabled (the default), when built with Go 1.14, would
      repeatedly send signal 23 to the process in the container and
      could generate errors when the container stopped (#5483)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless podman run commands could hang
      when forwarding ports
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not work when /proc
      was mounted with the hidepid option set
    - Fixed a bug where the podman system service command would use
      large amounts of CPU when --timeout was set to 0 (#5531)
  * HTTP API
    - Initial support for Libpod endpoints related to creating and
      operating on image manifest lists has been added
    - The Libpod Healthcheck and Events API endpoints are now
      supported
    - The Swagger endpoint can now handle cases where no Swagger
      documentation has been generated
  * Misc
    - Updated Buildah to v1.14.3
    - Updated containers/storage to v1.16.5
    - Several performance improvements have been made to creating
      containers, which should somewhat improve the performance of
      podman create and podman run

      container
    - Fixed a bug where Podman containers with user namespaces in
      CNI networks with the DNS plugin enabled would not have the
      DNS plugin's nameserver added to their resolv.conf
      ([#5256](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5256))
    - Fixed a bug where trailing / characters in image volume
      definitions could cause them to not be overridden by a
      user-specified mount at the same location
      ([#5219](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5219))

    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could segfault when passed
      a large number of file descriptors
    - Fixed a bug where the podman port command was incorrectly
      interpreting additional arguments as container names, instead

      did not depend on network targets, and so could start before
      the system network was ready (#4130)
    - Fixed a bug where exec sessions in containers which did not
      specify a user would not inherit supplemental groups added to

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 15:57:54 UTC 2020 - Ralf Haferkamp <rhafer@suse.com>

- The name of the cni-bridge in the default config changed from
  "cni0" to "podman-cni0" with podman-1.6.0. Add a %trigger to
  rename the bridge in the system to the new default if it exists.
  The trigger is only excuted when updating podman-cni-config
  from something older than 1.6.0. This is mainly needed for SLE
  where we're updating from 1.4.4 to 1.8.0 (bsc#1160460).

      could possible remove running containers if they were started
      while the command was running
    - Fixed a bug where Podman, when run as root, would not
      properly configure slirp4netns networking when requested

    - Fixed a bug where image healthchecks were not shown in the
      output of podman inspect
    - Fixed a bug where named volumes created with containers from

      containers if the --rm flag was given, even if they were
      given names
    - Fixed a bug where podman history was not computing image
      sizes correctly
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would not error on invalid values to

    - Fixed a bug where the podman restart command would not
      properly clean up the network, causing it to function
      differently from podman stop; podman start
    - Fixed a bug where setting the --memory-swap flag to podman
      create and podman run to -1 (to indicate unlimited) was not
      supported

    - The podman play kube command now honors RunAsUser,
      RunAsGroup, and selinuxOptions
    - The output format of the podman version command has been
      changed to better match docker version when using the
      --format flag
    - Rootless Podman will no longer initialize containers/storage
      twice, removing a potential deadlock preventing Podman
      commands from running while an image was being pulled (#4591)
    - Added tmpcopyup and notmpcopyup options to the --tmpfs and
      --mount type=tmpfs flags to podman create and podman run to
      control whether the content of directories are copied into
      tmpfs filesystems mounted over them
    - Added support for disabling detaching from containers by
      setting empty detach keys via --detach-keys=""
    - The podman build command now supports the --pull and
      --pull-never flags to control when images are pulled during a
      build
    - The podman ps -p command now shows the name of the pod as
      well as its ID (#4703)
    - The podman inspect command on containers will now display the
      command used to create the container
    - The podman info command now displays information on registry
      mirrors (#4553)
  * Bugfixes

      directory as root, causing state to be deleted after root
      logged out and making Podman in systemd services not function
      properly
    - Fixed a bug where the --change flag to podman import and
      podman commit was not being parsed properly in many cases
    - Fixed a bug where detach keys specified in libpod.conf were
      not used by the podman attach and podman exec commands, which
      always used the global default ctrl-p,ctrl-q key combination
      (#4556)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman was not able to run podman
      pod stats even on CGroups v2 enabled systems (#4634)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would fail on kernels
      without the renameat2 syscall (#4570)

      container B using --net container=C) would not properly mount
      /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf into the container (#4626)
    - Fixed a bug where podman run with the --rm flag and without
      -d could, when run in the background, throw a 'container does
      not exist' error when attempting to remove the container
      after it exited
    - Fixed a bug where named volume locks were not properly
      reacquired after a reboot, potentially leading to deadlocks
      when trying to start containers using the volume (#4605 and
      #4621)
    - Fixed a bug where Podman could not completely remove
      containers if sent SIGKILL during removal, leaving the
      container name unusable without the podman rm --storage
      command to complete removal (#3906)
    - Fixed a bug where checkpointing containers started with --rm
      was allowed when --export was not specified (the container,
      and checkpoint, would be removed after checkpointing was
      complete by --rm) (#3774)
    - Fixed a bug where the podman pod prune command would fail if
      containers were present in the pods and the --force flag was
      not passed (#4346)
    - Fixed a bug where containers could not set a static IP or
      static MAC address if they joined a non-default CNI network

      Architecture against the host when starting a container
    - Fixed a bug where containers in pods did not function
      properly with the Kata OCI runtime (#4353)
    - Fixed a bug where `podman info --format '{{ json . }}' would
      not produce JSON output (#4391)
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would not verify if files passed to
      --authfile existed (#4328)

      of a container's logs, instead of no lines (#4396)
    - Fixed a bug where the timeout for slirp4netns was incorrectly
      set, resulting in an extremely long timeout (#4344)

      utilizations figures incorrectly (#4409)
    - Fixed a bug where the podman inspect --size command would not
      print the size of the container's read/write layer if the
      size was 0 (#4744)
    - Fixed a bug where the podman kill command was not properly
      validating signals before use (#4746)
    - Fixed a bug where the --quiet and --format flags to podman ps
      could not be used at the same time
    - Fixed a bug where the podman stop command was not stopping
      exec sessions when a container was created without a PID
      namespace (--pid=host)

      automatically removed on being stopped if an exec session was
      running inside the container (#4666)
  * Misc

      behavior if an upgrade is performed while containers are
      running
    - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.12.0
    - Updated vendored containers/storage library to v1.15.4
    - Updated vendored containers/image library to v5.1.0
    - Kata Containers runtimes (kata-runtime, kata-qemu, and

      not be available unless Kata containers is installed on the
      system
    - Podman previously did not allow the creation of containers
      with a memory limit lower than 4MB. This restriction has been
      removed, as the crun runtime can create containers with
      significantly less memory
- Remove no longer needed workaround for *.5.md man page sources

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 12 14:30:34 UTC 2019 - Richard Brown <rbrown@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 31 13:05:29 UTC 2019 - Richard Brown <rbrown@suse.com>

- Add container-start-fix.patch to correct output of container-start to show container_name, not _id.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 07:21:29 UTC 2019 - Sascha Grunert <sgrunert@suse.com>

- Update podman to v1.6.2
  * Features
    - Added a --runtime flag to podman system migrate to allow the
      OCI runtime for all containers to be reset, to ease transition
      to the crun runtime on CGroups V2 systems until runc gains full
      support
    - The podman rm command can now remove containers in broken
      states which previously could not be removed
    - The podman info command, when run without root, now shows
      information on UID and GID mappings in the rootless user
      namespace
    - Added podman build --squash-all flag, which squashes all layers
      (including those of the base image) into one layer
    - The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create now accepts
      a string argument and allows a new value, always, which forces
      systemd support without checking if the the container
      entrypoint is systemd
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where the podman top command did not work on
      systems using CGroups V2 (#4192)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could double-close a file,
      leading to a panic
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to retrieve some
      containers while refreshing the state
    - Fixed a bug where podman start --attach --sig-proxy=false would
      still proxy signals into the container
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would unconditionally use a
      non-default path for authentication credentials (auth.json),
      breaking podman login integration with skopeo and other tools
      using the containers/image library
    - Fixed a bug where podman ps --format=json and podman images
      --format=json would display null when no results were returned,
      instead of valid JSON
    - Fixed a bug where podman build --squash was incorrectly
      squashing all layers into one, instead of only new layers
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would allow volumes with
      options to be mounted (mounting volumes requires root),
      creating an inconsistent state where volumes reported as
      mounted but were not (#4248)
    - Fixed a bug where volumes which failed to unmount could not be
      removed (#4247)
    - Fixed a bug where Podman incorrectly handled some errors
      relating to unmounted or missing containers in
      containers/storage
    - Fixed a bug where podman stats was broken on systems running
      CGroups V2 when run rootless (#4268)
    - Fixed a bug where the podman start command would print the
      short container ID, instead of the full ID
    - Fixed a bug where containers created with an OCI runtime that
      is no longer available (uninstalled or removed from the config
      file) would not appear in podman ps and could not be removed
      via podman rm
    - Fixed a bug where containers restored via podman container
      restore --import would retain the CGroup path of the original
      container, even if their container ID changed; thus, multiple
      containers created from the same checkpoint would all share the
      same CGroup
  * Misc
    - The default PID limit for containers is now set to 4096. It can
      be adjusted back to the old default (unlimited) by passing
      --pids-limit 0 to podman create and podman run
    - The podman start --attach command now automatically attaches
      STDIN if the container was created with -i
    - The podman network create command now validates network names
      using the same regular expression as container and pod names
    - The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create will now
      only enable systemd mode when the binary being run inside the
      container is /sbin/init, /usr/sbin/init, or ends in systemd
      (previously detected any path ending in init or systemd)
    - Updated vendored Buildah to 1.11.3
    - Updated vendored containers/storage to 1.13.5
    - Updated vendored containers/image to 4.0.1

      create would not copy the contents of their mountpoint the
      first time they were mounted into a container (#3945)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could not run podman exec
      when the container was not run inside a CGroup owned by the
      user (#3937)
    - Fixed a bug where podman play kube would panic when given Pod
      YAML without a securityContext (#3956)
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would place files incorrectly when
      storage.conf configuration items were set to the empty string
      (#3952)
    - Fixed a bug where podman build did not correctly inherit
      Podman's CGroup configuration, causing crashed on CGroups V2
      systems (#3938)
    - Fixed a bug where podman cp would improperly copy files on the
      host when copying a symlink in the container that included a
      glob operator (#3829)
    - Fixed a bug where remote podman run --rm would exit before the
      container was completely removed, allowing race conditions when
      removing container resources (#3870)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not properly handle
      changes to /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid after a container was
      launched

      devices in a container using the --device flag (#3905)
    - Fixed a bug where the commit Varlink API would segfault if
      provided incorrect arguments (#3897)
    - Fixed a bug where temporary files were not properly cleaned up
      after a build using remote Podman (#3869)

      it was not yet supported (#3861)
    - Fixed a bug where podman exec would run as the wrong user when
      execing into a container was started from an image with

      was actually mounted
    - Fixed a bug where podman exec --preserve-fds caused Podman to
      hang (#4020)
    - Fixed a bug where removing an unmounted container that was
      unmounted might sometimes not properly clean up the container
      (#4033)

      (#4162)
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman with slirp4netns networking
      would fail to start containers due to mount leaks
  * Misc
    - Significant changes were made to Podman volumes in this
      release. If you have pre-existing volumes, it is strongly
      recommended to run podman system renumber after upgrading.
    - Version 0.8.1 or greater of the CNI Plugins is now required for
      Podman
    - Version 2.0.1 or greater of Conmon is strongly recommended

    - Podman no longer sets a default size of 65kb for tmpfs
      filesystems
    - The default Podman CNI network has been renamed in an attempt
      to prevent conflicts with CRI-O when both are run on the same
      system. This should only take effect on system restart
    - The output of podman volume inspect has been more closely
      matched to docker volume inspect

- Update podman to v1.5.0
  * Features
    - Podman containers can now join the user namespaces of other
      containers with --userns=container:$ID, or a user namespace at
      an arbitary path with --userns=ns:$PATH
    - Rootless Podman can experimentally squash all UIDs and GIDs in
      an image to a single UID and GID (which does not require use of
      the newuidmap and newgidmap executables) by passing
      --storage-opt ignore_chown_errors
    - The podman generate kube command now produces YAML for any bind
      mounts the container has created (#2303)
    - The podman container restore command now features a new flag,
      --ignore-static-ip, that can be used with --import to import a
      single container with a static IP multiple times on the same
      host
    - Added the ability for podman events to output JSON by
      specifying --format=json
    - If the OCI runtime or conmon binary cannot be found at the
      paths specified in libpod.conf, Podman will now also search for
      them in the calling user's path
    - Added the ability to use podman import with URLs (#3609)
    - The podman ps command now supports filtering names using
      regular expressions (#3394)

      host into the container
    - Rootless Podman now supports healthchecks (#3523)
    - The format of the HostConfig portion of the output of podman
      inspect on containers has been improved and synced with Docker

      them by passing --cgroupns=private to podman run or podman
      create
    - The podman create and podman run commands now support the
      --ulimit=host flag, which uses any ulimits currently set on the
      host for the container
    - The podman rm and podman rmi commands now use different exit
      codes to indicate 'no such container' and 'container is
      running' errors
    - Support for CGroups V2 through the crun OCI runtime has been
      greatly improved, allowing resource limits to be set for
      rootless containers when the CGroups V2 hierarchy is in use
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where a race condition could cause podman restart
      to fail to start containers with ports
    - Fixed a bug where containers restored from a checkpoint would
      not properly report the time they were started at

      variable in the container even if it was not set on the host
      (#3648)

- Add podman-remote varlink client
- Update podman to v1.4.4
  * Features
    - Podman now has greatly improved support for containers using multiple OCI
      runtimes. Containers now remember if they were created with a different
      runtime using --runtime and will always use that runtime
    - The cached and delegated options for volume mounts are now allowed for
      Docker compatability (#3340)
    - The podman diff command now supports the --latest flag
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to use the entire root
      configuration if no rootless configuration was present for the user,
      breaking rootless Podman for new installations
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman's pause process would block SIGTERM,
      preventing graceful system shutdown and hanging until the system's init
      send SIGKILL
    - Fixed a bug where running Podman as root with sudo -E would not work after
      running rootless Podman at least once
    - Fixed a bug where options for tmpfs volumes added with the --tmpfs flag
      were being ignored
    - Fixed a bug where images with no layers could not properly be displayed
      and removed by Podman
    - Fixed a bug where locks were not properly freed on failure to create a
      container or pod
    - Fixed a bug where podman cp on a single file would create a directory at
      the target and place the file in it (#3384)
    - Fixed a bug where podman inspect --format '{{.Mounts}}' would print a
      hexadecimal address instead of a container's mounts
    - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add an entry to container's
      /etc/hosts files for their own hostname (#3405)
    - Fixed a bug where podman ps --sync would segfault (#3411)
    - Fixed a bug where podman generate kube would produce an invalid ports
      configuration (#3408)
  * Misc
    - Updated containers/storage to v1.12.13
    - Podman now performs much better on systems with heavy I/O load
    - The --cgroup-manager flag to podman now shows the correct default setting
      in help if the default was overridden by libpod.conf
    - For backwards compatability, setting --log-driver=json-file in podman run
      is now supported as an alias for --log-driver=k8s-file. This is considered
      deprecated, and json-file will be moved to a new implementation in the
      future ([#3363](https://github.com/containers/libpo\
      d/issues/3363))
    - Podman's default libpod.conf file now allows the crun OCI runtime to be
      used if it is installed

- Split out podman's basic CNI configuration to podman-cni-config, to avoid

- Do not compile commit hash into binary. `podman version` will not print
  the commit number as we are now following official releases.

- Change tar naming from commit to version to facilitate updates via the
  _service file.

- Update podman to v0.3.3.  This update includes several fixes and a new
  configuration file, libpod.conf.  By default, this config will be
  installed to /usr/share/containers and /etc/containers, whereas podman
  will always use the latter if present.  The config in
  /usr/share/containers can be used to check for new config options and
  will be replaced with each package update.  The libpod.conf config can
  be used to tweak some run-time paths of conmon, runc, etc., which is a
  more flexible approach than hard-coding those paths in podman.

  Changelog:
  * Update containers/image
  * Add restart to main podman manpage
  * Add podman restart to podman bash completions and commands
  * Make manpage more clear
  * Add 'podman restart' command
  * Remove ability to specify mount label when mounting

  * sleep does not catch SIGTERM
  * Include tmpfs in inspect
  * Add run and search to commands page
