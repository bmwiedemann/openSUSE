%description
The intent of this module is to provide a series of basic tests for 80% of
the testing you will need to do for scripts in the _script_ (or _bin_ as is
also commonly used) paths of your Perl distribution.

It also provides similar functions for testing programs that are not Perl
scripts.

Further, it aims to provide this functionality with perfect
platform-compatibility, and in a way that is as unobtrusive as possible.

That is, if the program works on a platform, then *Test::Script* should
always work on that platform as well. Anything less than 100% is considered
unacceptable.

In doing so, it is hoped that *Test::Script* can become a module that you
can safely make a dependency of all your modules, without risking that your
module won't on some platform because of the dependency.

Where a clash exists between wanting more functionality and maintaining
platform safety, this module will err on the side of platform safety.
