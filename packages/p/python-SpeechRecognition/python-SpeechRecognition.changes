- Update to version 3.8.1
  * Snowboy hotwords support for highly efficient, performant listening.
    This is implemented as the snowboy_configuration parameter of
    recognizer_instance.listen.
  * Configurable Pocketsphinx models - you can now specify your own acoustic
    parameters, language model, and phoneme dictionary, using the language
    parameter of recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx.
  * audio_data_instance.get_segment(start_ms=None, end_ms=None) is a new method
    that can be called on any AudioData instance to get a segment of the audio
    starting at start_ms and ending at end_ms. This is really useful when you
    want to get, say, only the first five seconds of some audio.
  * The stopper function returned by listen_in_background now accepts one
    parameter, wait_for_stop (defaulting to True for backwards compatibility),
    which determines whether the function will wait for the background thread
    to fully shutdown before returning. One advantage is that if wait_for_stop
    is False, you can call the stopper function from any thread!
  * New example, demonstrating how to simultaneously listen to and recognize
    speech with the threaded producer/consumer pattern: threaded_workers.py.
  * Various improvements and bugfixes:
    * Python 3 style type annotations in library documentation.
    * recognize_google_cloud now uses the v1 rather than the beta API.
    * recognize_google_cloud now returns timestamp info when the show_all
      parameter is True.
    * recognize_bing won't time out as often on credential requests, due to a
      longer default timeout.
    * recognize_google_cloud timeouts respect
      recognizer_instance.operation_timeout now.
    * Any recognizers using FLAC audio were broken inside Linux on Docker -
      this is now fixed.
    * Various documentation and lint fixes.
    * Lots of small build system improvements.
