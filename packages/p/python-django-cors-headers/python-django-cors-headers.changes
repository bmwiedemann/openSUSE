- Add Django dependency
- Use %license
- Update to v2.4.0
  * Always add 'Origin' to the 'Vary' header for responses to enabled
    URL's, to prevent caching of responses intended for one origin
    being served for another.
- from v2.3.0
  * Match ``CORS_URLS_REGEX`` to ``request.path_info`` instead of
    ``request.path``, so the patterns can work without knowing the
    site's path prefix at configuration time.
- from v2.2.1
  * Add ``Content-Length`` header to CORS preflight requests.
    This fixes issues with some HTTP proxies and servers,
    e.g. AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- from v2.2.0
  * Django 2.0 compatibility. Again there were no changes to the
    actual library code, so previous versions probably work.
  * Ensured that ``request._cors_enabled`` is always a ``bool()`` -
    previously it could be set to a regex match object.
