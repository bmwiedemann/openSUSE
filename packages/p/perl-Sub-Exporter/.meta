  <title>A sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines</title>
  <description>Sub::Exporter provides a sophisticated alternative to Exporter.pm.  It allows
for renaming, currying/sub-generation, and other cool stuff.  Read its own
documentation.


The biggest benefit of Sub::Exporter over existing exporters
(including the ubiquitous Exporter.pm) is its ability to build new coderefs
for export, rather than to simply export code identical to that found
in the exporting package.
