    <comment>- Update to 19.1.0:
  * structlog.ReturnLogger and structlog.PrintLogger now have
    a fatal() log method. #181
  * Under certain (rather unclear) circumstances, the frame
    extraction could throw an SystemError: error return without
    exception set. A workaround has been added. #174
  * structlog now tolerates passing through dicts to stdlib
    logging. #187 #188 #189
- Use pytest macro
- Fix source address and add missing source.
- Version update to 18.2.0
  * Added structlog.stdlib.add_log_level_number() processor that adds the level
    number to the event dictionary. Can be used to simplify log filtering.
  * structlog.processors.JSONRenderer now allows for overwriting the default
    argument of its serializer.
  * Added try_unbind() that works like unbind() but doesn't raise a KeyError if
    one of the keys is missing. #171
- Initial packaging of version 18.1.0
