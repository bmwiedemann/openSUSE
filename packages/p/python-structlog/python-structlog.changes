Mon Jul 22 08:46:41 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 24.3.0:
  * Restore feature parity between structlog.traceback.ExceptionDictTransformer
    and Rich's traceback extractor #627
    + When displaying locals, use Rich for formatting if it is available.
    + When displaying locals, call repr() on strings, too (improves handling of
      SecretStr implementations).
    + Add locals_max_length config option
    + Add locals_hide_sunder config option
    + Add locals_hide_dunder config option
    + Add suppress config option
  * structlog.testing.capture_logs() now maps the exception log level to
    error (as it's elsewhere) #628

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 10 08:28:13 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 24.2.0:
  * It is now possible to disable log level-padding in
    `structlog.dev.LogLevelColumnFormatter` and
    `structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`.
  * The `structlog.processors.CallsiteParameterAdder` can now be
    pickled.
  * `structlog.processors.CallsiteParameterAdder` now also works
    with `structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger`'s non-standard async
    methods (`ainfo()`, and so forth)
  * `structlog.processors.LogfmtRenderer` now escapes newlines.
  * `structlog.processors.LogfmtRenderer` now escapes backslashes
    and double quotes.
  * `structlog.processors.CallsiteParameterAdder` has been
    optimized to be about 2x faster.
  * `structlog.stdlib.render_to_log_kwargs` now correctly passes
    stacklevel as a kwarg to stdlib logging.

- update to 24.1.0:
  * The lazy logger proxy returned by `structlog.get_logger()`
    now returns its initial values when asked for context.
  * When asked for context before binding for the first time, it
    returned an empty dictionary in 23.3.0.
  * The displayed level name when using
    `structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger.exception()` is `"error"`
    instead of `"exception"`.
  * Don't ignore the `width` argument of
    `RichTracebackFormatter`.
  * Implementing the output on top of the new columns API has
    changed the default very slightly, but shouldn't be
    noticeable.
  * Async log methods (those starting with an `a`) now also
    support the collection of callsite information using
    `structlog.processors.CallsiteParameterAdder`.
  * `structlog.stdlib.recreate_defaults()` now also adds
    `structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name` to the processors.
  * The return value from `get_logger()` (a
    `BoundLoggerLazyProxy`) now passes `isinstance`-checks
    against `structlog.typing.BindableLogger` on Python 3.12.
  * `structlog.threadlocal.tmp_bind()` now also works with
    `BoundLoggerLazyProxy` (in other words: before anything is
    bound to a bound logger).
  * stdlib: `ProcessorFormatter` can now be told to not render
    the log record message using `getMessage` and just
    `str(record.msg)` instead.
  * stdlib: `structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger.exception()`'s handling
    of`LogRecord.exc_info` is now set consistent with `logging`.
  * Official support for Python 3.12.
  * `structlog.processors.MaybeTimeStamper` that only adds a
    timestamp if there isn't one already.
  * `structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer` now supports renamed
    timestamp keys using the *timestamp_key* parameter.
  * `structlog.dev.RichTracebackFormatter` that allows to
    configure the traceback formatting.
  * `FilteringBoundLogger.exception()` and
    `FilteringBoundLogger.aexception()` now support positional
    argument formatting like the rest of the methods.
  * `structlog.processors.format_exc_info()` and
    `structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer` do not crash anymore when
    told to format a non-existent exception.
  * `structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger` now has, analogously to our
    native logger, a full set of async log methods prefixed with
    an `a`: `await log.ainfo("event!")`
  * The default configuration now respects the presence of
    `FORCE_COLOR` (regardless of its value, unless an empty
    string).
  * This disables all heuristics whether it makes sense to use
    colors.
  * The default configuration now respects the presence of
    `NO_COLOR` (regardless of its value, unless an empty string).
  * This disables all heuristics whether it makes sense to use
    colors and overrides `FORCE_COLOR`.
  * Accessing package metadata as attributes on the *structlog*
    module is deprecated (for example, `structlog.__version__`).
  * Please use `importlib.metadata` instead (for Python 3.7: the
    *importlib-metadata* PyPI package).
  * The `structlog.types` module is now deprecated in favor of
    the `structlog.typing` module.
  * It seems like the Python typing community is settling on this
    name.
  * The timestamps in the default configuration now use the
    correct separator (`:`) for seconds.

Thu Jul 21 07:12:29 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 22.1.0:
  Removed:
  * Python 3.6 is not supported anymore.
  * Pickling is now only possible with protocol version 3 and newer.
  Deprecated:
  * The entire structlog.threadlocal module is deprecated. Please use the
    primitives from structlog.contextvars instead.
  * If you're using the modern APIs (bind_threadlocal() / merge_threadlocal())
    it's enough to replace them 1:1 with their contextvars counterparts. The old
    approach around wrap_dict() has been discouraged for a while.
  * Currently there are no concrete plans to remove the module, but no patches
    against it will be accepted from now on. #409
  Added:
  * structlog.processors.StackInfoRenderer now has an additional_ignores
    parameter that allows you to filter out your own logging layer. #396
  * Added structlog.WriteLogger, a faster – but more low-level – alternative to
    structlog.PrintLogger. It works the way PrintLogger used to work in previous
    versions. #403 #404
  * structlog.make_filtering_bound_logger()-returned loggers now also have a
    log() method to match the structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger signature closer. #413
  * Added structured logging of tracebacks via the structlog.tracebacks module,
    and most notably the structlog.tracebacks.ExceptionDictTransformer which can be
    used with the new structlog.processors.ExceptionRenderer to render JSON
    tracebacks. #407
  * structlog.stdlib.recreate_defaults(log_level=logging.NOTSET) that recreates
    structlog's defaults on top of standard library's logging. It optionally also
    configures logging to log to standard out at the passed log level. #428
  * structlog.processors.EventRenamer allows you to rename the hitherto
    hard-coded event dict key event to something else. Optionally, you can rename
    another key to event at the same time, too. So adding EventRenamer(to="msg",
    replace_by="_event") to your processor pipeline will rename the standard event
    key to msg and then rename the _event key to event. This allows you to use the
    event key in your own log files and to have consistent log message keys across
    languages.
  * structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer(event_key="event") now allows to customize
    the name of the key that is used for the log message.
  Changed:
  * structlog.make_filtering_bound_logger() now returns a method with the same
    signature for all log levels, whether they are active or not. This ensures that
    invalid calls to inactive log levels are caught immediately and don't explode
    once the log level changes. #401
  * structlog.PrintLogger – that is used by default – now uses print() for
    printing, making it a better citizen for interactive terminal applications. #399
  * structlog.testing.capture_logs now works for already initialized bound loggers. #408
  * structlog.processors.format_exc_info() is no longer a function, but an
    instance of structlog.processors.ExceptionRenderer. Its behavior has not
    changed. #407
  * The default configuration now includes the
    structlog.contextvars.merge_contextvars processor. That means you can use
    structlog.contextvars features without configuring structlog.
  Fixed:
  * Overloaded the bind, unbind, try_unbind and new methods in the
    FilteringBoundLogger Protocol. This makes it easier to use objects of type
    FilteringBoundLogger in a typed context. #392
  * Monkeypatched sys.stdouts are now handled more gracefully by
    ConsoleRenderer (that's used by default). #404
  * structlog.stdlib.render_to_log_kwargs() now correctly handles the presence
    of exc_info, stack_info, and stackLevel in the event dictionary. They are
    transformed into proper keyword arguments instead of putting them into the
    extra dictionary. #424, #427

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  1 10:55:24 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 21.5.0:
  * Added the structlog.processors.LogfmtRenderer processor to render
    log lines using the logfmt format. #376
  * Added the structlog.stdlib.ExtraAdder processor that adds extra
    attributes of logging.LogRecord objects to the event dictionary.
    This processor can be used for adding data passed in the extra
    parameter of the logging module's log methods to the event
    dictionary. #209 #377
  * Added the structlog.processor.CallsiteParameterAdder processor that
    adds parameters of the callsite that an event dictionary orginated
    from to the event dictionary. This processor can be used to enrich
    events dictionaries with information such as the function name,
    line number and filename that an event dictionary orignated from. #380

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  1 10:50:45 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 21.4.0:
  * Fixed import when running in optimized mode (PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2
    or python -OO). #373
  * Added the structlog.threadlocal.bound_threadlocal and
    structlog.contextvars.bound_contextvars decorator/context managers
    to temporarily bind key/value pairs to a thread-local and context-local
    context. #371

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  1 10:49:07 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 21.3.0:
  * structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer now has sort_keys boolean parameter
    that allows to disable the sorting of keys on output. #358
  * structlog.processors.TimeStamper now works well with FreezeGun
    even when it gets applied before the loggers are configured. #364
  * structlog.stdlib.AsyncBoundLogger now determines the running loop
    when logging, not on instantiation. That has a minor performance
    impact, but makes it more robust when loops change
    (e.g. aiohttp.web.run_app()), or you want to use sync_bl before a
    loop has started.
  * structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter now has a processors argument
    that allows to define a processor chain to run over all log entries.
  * Before running the chain, two additional keys are added to the event
    dictionary: _record and _from_structlog. With them it's possible to
    extract information from logging.LogRecords and differentiate between
    structlog and logging log entries while processing them.
  * The old processor (singular) parameter is now deprecated, but no
    plans exist to remove it. #365

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 13 08:36:18 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 21.2.0:
  Highlights:
  * Support for for beautiful (and helpful!) exceptions by integrating
    ConsoleRenderer with rich or better-exceptions.
  * Helpers to access thread-local and context-local context.
  * Deeper contextvars support.
  Backward-incompatible changes:
  * To implement pretty exceptions (see Changes below),
    structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer now formats exceptions itself.
    Make sure to remove format_exc_info from your processor chain if you
    configure structlog manually. This change is not really breaking
    because the old use-case will keep working as before. However if
    you pass pretty_exceptions=True (which is the default if either
    rich or better-exceptions is installed), a warning will be raised
    and the exception will be renderered without prettyfication.
  Changes:
  * structlog is now importable if sys.stdout is None (e.g. when
    running using pythonw). #313
  * structlog.threadlocal.get_threadlocal() and
    structlog.contextvars.get_contextvars() can now be used to get a copy
    of the current thread-local/context-local context that has been bound
    using structlog.threadlocal.bind_threadlocal() and
    structlog.contextvars.bind_contextvars(). #331 #337
  * structlog.threadlocal.get_merged_threadlocal(bl) and
    structlog.contextvars.get_merged_contextvars(bl) do the same, but
    also merge the context from a bound logger bl. Same pull requests as
    previous change.
  * structlog.contextvars.bind_contextvars() now returns a mapping of
    keys to contextvars.Tokens, allowing you to reset values using the
    new structlog.contextvars.reset_contextvars(). #339
  * Exception rendering in structlog.dev.ConsoleLogger is now configurable
    using the exception_formatter setting. If either the rich or the
    better-exceptions package is present, structlog will use them for
    pretty-printing tracebacks. rich takes precedence over
    better-exceptions if both are present.
    This only works if format_exc_info is absent in the processor chain.
    #330 #349
  * All use of colorama on non-Windows systems has been excised. Thus,
    colors are now enabled by default in structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer
    on non-Windows systems. You can keep using colorama to customize
    colors, of course. #345
  * The final processor can now return a bytearray (additionally to str
    and bytes). #344

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 19 08:07:55 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 21.1.0:
  * structlog.threadlocal.wrap_dict() now has a correct type
    annotation. #290
  * Fix isolation in structlog.contextvars. #302
  * The default configuration and loggers are pickleable again. #301
  * structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer will now look for a logger_name
     key if no logger key is set. #295

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 11:16:18 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 20.2.0:
  Backward-incompatible changes:
  * Python 2.7 and 3.5 aren't supported anymore. The package meta
    data should ensure that you keep getting 20.1.0 on those versions. #244
  * structlog is now fully type-annotated. This won't break your
    applications, but if you use Mypy, it will most likely break your CI.
  Deprecations:
  * Accessing the _context attribute of a bound logger is now deprecated.
    Please use the new structlog.get_context().
  Changes:
  * structlog has now type hints for all of its APIs! Since structlog
    is highly dynamic and configurable, this led to a few concessions
    like a specialized structlog.stdlib.get_logger() whose only difference
    to structlog.get_logger() is that it has the correct type hints.
    We consider them provisional for the time being – i.e. the backward
    compatibility does not apply to them in its full strength until we
    feel we got it right. Please feel free to provide feedback! #223, #282
  * Added structlog.make_filtering_logger that can be used like
    configure(wrapper_class=make_filtering_bound_logger(logging.INFO)).
    It creates a highly optimized bound logger whose inactive methods
    only consist of a return None. This is now also the default logger.
  * As a complement, structlog.stdlib.add_log_level() can now
    additionally be imported as structlog.processors.add_log_level
    since it just adds the method name to the event dict.
  * structlog.processors.add_log_level() is now part of the default configuration.
  * structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter no longer uses exceptions for
    control flow, allowing foreign_pre_chain processors to use
    sys.exc_info() to access the real exception.
  * Added structlog.BytesLogger to avoid unnecessary encoding round trips.
    Concretely this is useful with orjson which returns bytes. #271
  * The final processor now also may return bytes that are passed
    untouched to the wrapped logger.
  * structlog.get_context() allows you to retrieve the original
    context of a bound logger. #266,
  * structlog.PrintLogger now supports copy.deepcopy(). #268
  * Added structlog.testing.CapturingLogger for more unit testing goodness.
  * Added structlog.stdlib.AsyncBoundLogger that executes logging
    calls in a thread executor and therefore doesn't block. #245

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 17 11:33:05 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 20.1.0
  - This is the last version to support Python 2.7 (including PyPy) and 3.5.
    All following versions will only support Python 3.6 or later.
  - Added a new module ``structlog.contextvars`` that allows to have a global but context-local ``structlog`` context the same way as with ``structlog.threadlocal`` since 19.2.0.
    `#201 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/201>`_,
    `#236 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/236>`_
  - Added a new module ``structlog.testing`` for first class testing support.
    The first entry is the context manager ``capture_logs()`` that allows to make assertions about structured log calls.
    `#14 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/14>`_,
    `#234 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/234>`_
  - Added ``structlog.threadlocal.unbind_threadlocal()``.
    `#239 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/239>`_
  - The logger created by ``structlog.get_logger()`` is not detected as an abstract method anymore, when attached to an abstract base class.
    `#229 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/229>`_
  - ``colorama`` isn't initialized lazily on Windows anymore because it breaks rendering.
    `#232 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/232>`_,
    `#242 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/242>`_

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 17 06:35:14 UTC 2019 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 19.2.0:
  Backward-incompatible changes:
  * Python 3.4 is not supported anymore. It has been unsupported by
    the Python core team for a while now and its PyPI downloads are negligible.
    It's very unlikely that structlog will break under 3.4 anytime soon,
    but we don't test it anymore.
  Changes:
  * Full Python 3.8 support for structlog.stdlib.
  * Added more pass-through properties to structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger.
    To makes it easier to use it as a drop-in replacement for logging.Logger. #198
  * structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter now takes a logger object as an
    optional keyword argument. This makes ProcessorFormatter work properly
    with stuctlog.stdlib.filter_by_level(). #219
  * structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer now uses no colors by default, if
    colorama is not available. #215
  * structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer now initializes colorama lazily, to
    prevent accidental side-effects just by importing structlog. #210
  * Added new processor structlog.dev.set_exc_info() that will set
    exc_info=True if the method's name is exception and exc_info isn't
    set at all. This is only necessary when the standard library integration
    is not used. It fixes the problem that in the default configuration,
    structlog.get_logger().exception("hi") in an except block would not print the
    exception without passing exc_info=True to it explicitly. #130, #173, #200, #204
  * A best effort has been made to make as much of structlog pickleable as possible
    to make it friendlier with multiprocessing and similar libraries.
    Some classes can only be pickled on Python 3 or using the dill library
    though and that is very unlikely to change.
  * So far, the configuration proxy, structlog.processor.TimeStamper,
    structlog.BoundLogger, structlog.PrintLogger and structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer
    have been made pickelable. Please report if you need any another class fixed. #126
  * Added a new thread-local API that allows binding values to a thread-local
    context explicitly without affecting the default behavior of bind(). #222, #225
  * Added pass_foreign_args argument to structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter.
    It allows to pass a foreign log record's args attribute to the event
    dictionary under the positional_args key. #228
  * structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer now calls str() on the event value. #221

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  2 11:12:35 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 19.1.0:
  * structlog.ReturnLogger and structlog.PrintLogger now have
    a fatal() log method. #181
  * Under certain (rather unclear) circumstances, the frame
    extraction could throw an SystemError: error return without
    exception set. A workaround has been added. #174
  * structlog now tolerates passing through dicts to stdlib
    logging. #187 #188 #189
- Use pytest macro

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 29 08:06:43 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 22 13:28:52 UTC 2018 - Karol Babioch <kbabioch@suse.de>

- Version update to 18.2.0
  * Added structlog.stdlib.add_log_level_number() processor that adds the level
    number to the event dictionary. Can be used to simplify log filtering.
  * structlog.processors.JSONRenderer now allows for overwriting the default
    argument of its serializer.
  * Added try_unbind() that works like unbind() but doesn't raise a KeyError if
    one of the keys is missing. #171

-------------------------------------------------------------------
