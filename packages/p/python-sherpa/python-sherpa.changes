- Update to 4.15.0
  * This release of Sherpa includes various enhancements,
    documentation updates,  bug fixes, and infrastructure changes.
  ## Enhancements:
  * Improved validation of arguments when creating Data objects:
    - arrays sent to Data objects are now converted to ndarrays
    - the independent axis is now made read-only
    - the size of a data object is now fixed.
  * Filter setting with notice/ignore are reported to the screen
    for the users of the UI layer.
  * Increased test coverage for plotting
  ## Documentation changes:
  * updated readthedocs to use pip and pytest instead of setup.py
  * several updates to documentation, including updates to
    fake_pha, calc_ftest, calc_mlr
  ## Infrastructure changes:
  * Drop support for Python 3.7
  * Updates to start creating Python 3.10 Conda packages.
  * Use Numpy 1.20 for Python 3.8/3.9 and Numpy 1.21 for Python
    3.10.
  * Moves toward PEP-517 with some distutils cleanup and more
    configuration moved from setup.py to setup.cfg
  * Various improvements to the GitHub Actions and GitLab workflows
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Ensure chi2xspecvar errors match XSPEC when 0 counts are
    present during background subtraction
  * Remove model instances from the global symbol table when clean
    is called
  * Addresses new warnings in the tests for Matplotlib 3.6.0 and
    AstroPy 5.1
  * Minor copy and paste error in fake_pha docstring
  * Test issues in test_fake_pha.py due to randomness
  ## Caveats
  * There are known issues (#1602, #1605, #1606) in the
    histogram1d/histogram2d functions leading to failures which
    were not fully addressed in this release (see the failed case
    in the second histogram1d example). This is not the Sherpa core
    functionality and numpy.histogram can be used if needed.
- Drop reproducible.patch: the patched fftw sources are not used in
  this build.

Mon Aug  8 15:24:05 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Sherpa requires a build with setuptools < 60:
  * Use python3X bundled setuptools instead of distribution package
