Fri Nov 22 17:33:04 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.5.1:
  * Fix a bug where flushing in threaded mode did not write the
    data to the output file.
  * Threaded reading and writing do no longer block exiting
    when an exception occurs in the main thread.
- update to 0.5.0:
  * Fix a bug where READ and WRITE in zlib_ng.gzip_ng were
    inconsistent with the values in gzip on Python 3.13
  * Small simplifications to the ``gzip_ng.compress`` and
    ``gzip_ng.decompress`` functions, which should lead to less
    overhead.
- update to 0.4.3:
  * Fix a bug where files larger than 4GB could not be
    decompressed.
- update to 0.4.2:
  * Fix a reference counting error that happened on module
    initialization and triggered an error in the CPython debug
    build.
  * Fix a setup.py error that was triggered on MacOS ARM64.

- build against modern python on sle15

Sat Mar 16 14:42:27 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.1:
  * Fix a bug where streams that were passed to
    gzip_ng_threaded.open where closed.
  * Fix compatibility with Python 3.13

Tue Feb  6 20:48:05 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.4.0
  * Add a gzip_ng_threaded module that contains the
    gzip_ng_threaded.open function. This allows using multithreaded
    compression as well as escaping the GIL.
  * The internal gzip_ng._GzipReader has been rewritten in C. As a
    result the overhead of decompressing files has significantly
    been reduced.
  * The gzip_ng._GzipReader in C is now used in gzip_ng.decompress.
    The _GzipReader also can read from objects that support the
    buffer protocol. This has reduced overhead significantly.
  * Fix some unclosed buffer errors in the gzip_ng CLI.
- Version 0.3.0
  * Source distributions on Linux now default to building with
    configure and make as it is faster and has less dependencies
    than CMake.
  * Python 3.12 support was added. Python 3.7 support was dropped
    as it is end of life.
  * Update embedded zlib-ng version to 2.1.5. This comes with some
    speed improvements and changes with regards to the compression
    levels. Also several bugs were fixed. For full details checkout
    the zlib-ng 2.1.2 release notes as well as those for the bugfix
    releases 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.5.
- Fix BuildRequirements. This one never used poetry.
- Enable tests in multibuild: some tests call python3.X -m zlib_ng
  without respecting the PYTHONPATH from %pytest_arch.
- Link to system library
