- Update to 0.4.0
  * Add a gzip_ng_threaded module that contains the
    gzip_ng_threaded.open function. This allows using multithreaded
    compression as well as escaping the GIL.
  * The internal gzip_ng._GzipReader has been rewritten in C. As a
    result the overhead of decompressing files has significantly
    been reduced.
  * The gzip_ng._GzipReader in C is now used in gzip_ng.decompress.
    The _GzipReader also can read from objects that support the
    buffer protocol. This has reduced overhead significantly.
  * Fix some unclosed buffer errors in the gzip_ng CLI.
- Version 0.3.0
  * Source distributions on Linux now default to building with
    configure and make as it is faster and has less dependencies
    than CMake.
  * Python 3.12 support was added. Python 3.7 support was dropped
    as it is end of life.
  * Update embedded zlib-ng version to 2.1.5. This comes with some
    speed improvements and changes with regards to the compression
    levels. Also several bugs were fixed. For full details checkout
    the zlib-ng 2.1.2 release notes as well as those for the bugfix
    releases 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.5.
- Fix BuildRequirements. This one never used poetry.
- Enable tests in multibuild: some tests call python3.X -m zlib_ng
  without respecting the PYTHONPATH from %pytest_arch.
- Link to system library
