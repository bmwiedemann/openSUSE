    <comment>- update to 0.5.1:
  * Fix a bug where flushing in threaded mode did not write the
    data to the output file.
  * Threaded reading and writing do no longer block exiting
    when an exception occurs in the main thread.
- update to 0.5.0:
  * Fix a bug where READ and WRITE in zlib_ng.gzip_ng were
    inconsistent with the values in gzip on Python 3.13
  * Small simplifications to the ``gzip_ng.compress`` and
    ``gzip_ng.decompress`` functions, which should lead to less
    overhead.
- update to 0.4.3:
  * Fix a bug where files larger than 4GB could not be
    decompressed.
- update to 0.4.2:
  * Fix a reference counting error that happened on module
    initialization and triggered an error in the CPython debug
    build.
  * Fix a setup.py error that was triggered on MacOS ARM64.
