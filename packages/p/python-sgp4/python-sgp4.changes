Fri May  9 05:18:52 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Switch to pyproject macros.
- Ship README as docs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  8 12:32:55 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.23:
  * Tweaked tests to resolve breakage introduced by Python 3.12.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 31 19:48:23 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.22:
  * Added a ``satnum_str`` attribute, exposing the fact that the C++ now
    stores the satellite number as a string; and check that ``satnum`` is
    never greater than 339999.
  * Fixed the units of the ``nddot`` attribute when the value is loaded
    from an OMM record.  (Since the TLE computation itself ignores this
    attribute, this did not affect any satellite positions.)
  * Enhanced the fallback Python version of ``twoline2rv()`` to verify
    that TLE lines are ASCII, and added documentation using it to
    double-check TLEs that might suffer from non-ASCII characters.
  * If the user doesn’t set a satellite’s ``classification``, it now
    defaults to ``'U'`` for ‘unclassified’.
  * Added ``dump_satrec()`` to the ``sgp4.conveniences`` module.
  * Fixed the ``Satrec`` attribute ``.error``, which was previously
    building a nonsense integer from the wrong data in memory.
  * Removed ``.whichconst`` from Python ``Satrec``, to help users avoid
    writing code that will break when the C++ extension is available.

Sun Jul  4 12:03:54 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 2.20
  * Taught sgp4init() to round both epochdays and jdsatepochF to
    the same 8 decimal places used for the date fraction in a TLE,
    if the user-supplied epoch itself has 8 or fewer digits behind
    the decimal point. This should make it easier to build
    satellites that round-trip to TLE format with perfect accuracy.
  * Fixed how export_tle() formats the BSTAR field when its value,
    if written in scientific notation, has a positive exponent.
  * Fixed the epochyr assigned by sgp4init() so years before 2000
    have two digits instead of three (for example, so that 1980
    produces an epochyr of 80 instead of 980).
- Release 2.19
  * Extended the documentation on the Python Package Index and in
    the module docstring so it lists every Satrec attribute that
    this library exposes; even the more obscure ones might be
    useful to folks working to analyze satellite orbits.
- Release 2.18
  * If a TLE satellite number lacks the required 5 digits,
    twoline2rv() now gives the underlying C++ library a little
    help so it can still parse the classification and
    international designator correctly.
  * The Satrec attributes jdsatepoch, jdsatepochF, epochyr, and
    epochdays are now writeable, so users can adjust their values
    manually — which should make up for the fact that the sgp4init
    () method can’t set them with full floating point precision.
- Release 2.17
  * Fixed where in the output array the sgp4_array() method writes
    NaN values when an SGP4 propagation fails.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 20:47:21 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to Version 2.16
  * Fixed ``days2mdhms()`` rounding to always match TLE epoch.
- Changes in Version 2.15
  * Fixed parsing of the ``satnum`` TLE field in the Python
    fallback code, when the field has a leading space
  * added OMM export routine.
- skip python36 (NEP 29, NumPy 1.20)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  2 00:26:53 UTC 2021 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to Version 2.14
  * New data formats: added OMM message support for both XML and
    CSV, and added support for the new Alpha-5 extension to TLE
    files.
- Drop sgp4-fix69-precision.patch merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 17:49:47 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

  gh#brandon-rhodes/python-sgp4#69

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 09:49:21 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 2.13
  *  Enhanced sgp4init() with custom code that also sets the
     epochdays and epochyr satellite attributes.
