%description
This Python package computes the position and velocity of an earth-orbiting 
satellite, given the satellite’s TLE orbital elements from a source like 
Celestrak. It implements the most recent version of SGP4, and is regularly run 
against the SGP4 test suite to make sure that its satellite position predictions 
agree to within 0.1 mm with the predictions of the standard distribution of the 
algorithm. This error is far less than the 1–3 km/day by which satellites 
themselves deviate from the ideal orbits described in TLE files.

This package compiles the verbatim source code from the official C++ version
of SGP4. You can call the routine directly, or through an array API that loops 
over arrays of satellites and arrays of times with machine code instead of Python.
