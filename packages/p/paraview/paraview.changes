Thu May  7 21:53:50 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Drop patches no longer needed:
  * 0001-Add-libogg-to-IOMovie-target-link-libraries.patch
  * fix-loguru-missing-links.patch
  * paraview-do-not-install-missing-vtk-doxygen-dir.patch
  * paraview-link-against-python.patch: pass
    DVTK_PYTHON_OPTIONAL_LINK=OFF to cmake instead (see
    https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/issues/17881).
- Update bundled_exodusii_add_missing_libpthread.patch to version

  https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/-/issues/19706#note_746038.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  8 18:26:31 UTC 2020 - Christoph G <foss@grueninger.de>

  now required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 18 18:49:49 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.8.0:
  * See https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-5-8-0-release-notes/.
- Rebase paraview-desktop-entry-fix.patch for updated location of
  desktop file in source.
- Drop fix-QtGUI-missing-GLX_mesa-linking.patch: no longer
  required as linking GLX_mesa to build QtGUI is now correctly
  handled by build.
- Drop 0001-Allow-compilation-on-GLES-platforms.patch: patch no
  longer applies (since vesin 5.7.0) and commenting out patch
  leads to factory_auto declining the submission.
- Use ninja instead of make as recommended by upstream and to
  speed up build; define __builder to ninja so that cmake build
  macros use this instead of the default make.
- Pass PARAVIEW_BUILD_WITH_EXTERNAL to cmake to use system third
  party libraries by default; pass VTK_MODULE_USE_EXTERNAL_<name>
  to use specific bundled libraries conditionally (gl2ps, haru,
  pugixml).
- Use %cmake_build instead of %make_jobs during building.
- Replace deprecated options passed to cmake by updated ones:
  * PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI -> DPARAVIEW_USE_QT
  * PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON -> PARAVIEW_USE_PYTHON.
- Update paraview-rpmlintrc to suppress warning about a non-exec
  file that is installed to %{_bindir} and is really necessary
  (see https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/19706);
  the previous entry no longer applies, so drop it.
- Add absolutely necessary dependencies for paraview-devel as
  Requires.
- Install python modules to %{python3_sitearch}/paraview rather
  than the default [%{python3_sitearch}] by setting
  PARAVIEW_PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES_SUFFIX when configuring cmake;
  this avoids file conflicts between python3-paraview and
  python3-vtk.
- Don't install paraview-config: it doesn't work without the
  static libs being installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 31 22:30:41 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.7.0:
  See https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-5-7-0-release-notes/
- Split out new subpackages: libparaview5_7 for all the shared
  libs, paraview-plugins for bundled plugins, and python3-paraview
  for python3 bindings.
- Move shared libraries to %{_libdir} and install them as part of
  libparaview5_7.
- Update commands passed to cmake in keeping with upstream's
  overhaul.
- Drop paraview-find-qhelpgenerator-qt5.patch: no longer needed.
- Drop  paraview-fix-file-contains-date-time.patch: GCC supports
  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH and, as such, this fix is no longer needed.
- Switch to python3: Paraview is production ready with python3
  starting with version 5.7.0, and python2 support is slated to be
  dropped from the next major upgrade.
- Rebase patches for updated version:
  * fix-libharu-missing-m.patch.
  * bundled_exodusii_add_missing_libpthread.patch.
- New patches to fix linking problems introduced with version
  5.7.0:
  * fix-loguru-missing-links.patch: Add linking to libraries libm,
    libdl, and libpthread when building loguru.
  * fix-QtGUI-missing-GLX_mesa-linking.patch: Link to library
    libGLX_mesa when building Qt GUI support.
  * paraview-link-against-python.patch to fix linking against
    the python library.
- Patch 0001-Allow-compilation-on-GLES-platforms.patch needs
  rebase; commented out for now.
- Switch an env based hashbang with one directly calling the
  required binary (python3 in this case).
- Switch as many BuildRequires as possible to pkgconfig based
  ones.
- Update rpmlintrc file to remove no longer needed filters and
  update the leftover filter (hidden file or dir) for directory
  change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 31 22:05:09 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

  * 0001-Allow-compilation-on-GLES-platforms.patch

  * Fixed problem with long-running animations not advancing past
    a certain number of time steps.

    loader "Choose File Names" dialog also changed the file paths
    of other files with the same type.

    ParaViewWeb.

    a full list of updates.
- Use the %%cmake macro instead of using cmake manually.
- Minor rebase of existing patches for version update.
- ExcludeArch for ix86 processors until 32 bit builds can be
  sorted out; issue reported upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 20 15:42:39 UTC 2017 - foss@grueninger.de

  * VTK-m Plugin for many-core systems
  * Reader and Writer Improvements and Additions
  * Fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA) is now on by default
  * new StreamLinesRepresentation plugin

    https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-5-3-0-release-notes/
- drop package paraview-plugin-SciberQuestToolKit as SQTK is no longer
  part of ParaView (see commit c2bc94c2efb66c4bb525383176688ddfd430ca26)
- drop paraview-build-sciberquesttoolkit-with-opengl2.patch as SQTK is
  no longer build
- add paraview-do-not-install-missing-vtk-doxygen-dir.patch to remove
  non-existing doxygen/doc/html folder from VTK.
- modified paraview-find-qhelpgenerator-qt5.patch to adapt to partial
  inclusion of original patch to upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  8 15:30:11 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Replicate the %cmake macro manually, stripping out the
  problematic and unused options. In particular, this restores
  passing rpm_opt_flags to C/C++ during compilation.
- Update paraview-fix-file-contains-date-time.patch to remove
  references to __DATE__ and __TIME__ also from
  Plugins/CDIReader/cdilib.c; suppresses an rpmlint warning.
- Update %{name}-rpmlintrc file to also suppress warnings about:
  * no-manual-page-for-binary: upstream doesn't supply manpages
    and we don't care.
  * hidden-file-or-dir: this hidden file is really used as a
    catalogue of available plugins by paraview.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 24 18:38:09 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.2.0: See a summary of changes at:
  https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-5-2-0-release-notes/ .
- Use cmake macros (except for %cmake) for %build and %install
  actions; drop the paraview_cmake_options and send the options
  directly to cmake. We do not use the %cmake macro because
  it passes the RPM optflags to cmake, and with paraview 5.2 these
  flags cause compilation errors; see
  https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17049.
- Turn off system GL2PS and DIY for bundled VTK.
- Switch to using Qt5 for openSUSE > 13.2 and Leap 42.2 and
  higher (Qt5 >= 5.6.0 is required).
- Add BuildRequires on python-Sphinx, python-qt*-devel; new
  requirements.
- Add BuildRequires on pkgconfig(libpng), pkgconfig(freetype2) and
  pkgconfig(xt); these are all required and being implicitly
  pulled in by libqt4-devel.
- Add paraview-find-qhelpgenerator-qt5.patch: Help find
  qhelpgenerator-qt5 instead of qhelpgenerator when Qt5 is used.
- Add paraview-pythonqt-build-fix.patch to fix build issues with
  PythonQtPlugin; patch taken from upstream.
- Add paraview-build-sciberquesttoolkit-with-opengl2.patch to
  enable building of SciberQuestToolKit even when OpenGL2 is used
  as the default VTK rendering (needs testing).
- Drop require-only-cmake-3_0.patch, cmake >= 3.3 is now required.
- Add documentation linked to from the Help menu in main
  application as additional sources and install them where it
  looks for them (ParaViewGettingStarted-5.2.0.pdf,
  ParaViewGuide-5.2.0.pdf, ParaViewTutorial.pdf).
- Send other docs to %{_docdir} by explicitly passing the cmake
  option VTK_INSTALL_DOC_DIR.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 29 05:13:00 UTC 2016 - foss@grueninger.de

    improperly read files with no timesteps.
