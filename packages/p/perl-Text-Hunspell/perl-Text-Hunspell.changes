          Fixed GH#5 (http://github.com/cosimo/perl5-text-hunspell/issues/5).
          Should make Text::Hunspell installable without pain from CPAN and
          cpanminus clients. The problem was in the undeclared use of
          ExtUtils::PkgConfig, which needs to be known even before running
          the configure (Makefile.PL) step. Thanks to Pavel Shaydo for reporting
          the problem.

          Fixed RT#99548, which should make it easier to install Text::Hunspell
          on most systems. Basically replace my broken way of checking for
          libhunspell by looking up pkgconfig using ExtUtils::PkgConfig.
          Thanks to David Gutteridge for teaching me how to do it!
