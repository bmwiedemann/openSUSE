  2.14    2016/01/14 08:36:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)
  
          No functional changes. Now Text::Hunspell depends on Alien::Hunspell
          version 0.04. Should finally compile nicely on Win32 platform.
  
  2.13    2016/01/11 10:59:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)
  
          Win32 build support added (Graham Ollis, @plicease).
          This should make Text::Hunspell build correctly on Windows. \o/
  
          *** If you're using Win32, make sure you use a recent version of
          Alien::Base (>= 0.024) and/or Alien::Hunspell (soon-to-be 0.04)
  
  2.12    2015/12/18 10:35:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)
  
          Replaced ExtUtils::PkgConfig with Alien::Hunspell. This should allow
          Text::Hunspell to build on non-pkgconfig-enabled systems, even though
          I'm not sure how reliably it works. Will have to evaluate from CPAN
          testers results. Thanks to Alien* expert Graham Ollis for this
          contribution.

          No functional changes, only minor cleanups and a fix for RT#99810
          (compilation on non-gcc based systems). Thanks to bjakubski for sending
          in patches on Github.

          Fixed GH#5 (http://github.com/cosimo/perl5-text-hunspell/issues/5).
          Should make Text::Hunspell installable without pain from CPAN and
          cpanminus clients. The problem was in the undeclared use of
          ExtUtils::PkgConfig, which needs to be known even before running
          the configure (Makefile.PL) step. Thanks to Pavel Shaydo for reporting
          the problem.
  
  2.09    2014/10/20 07:56:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)
  
          Fixed RT#99548, which should make it easier to install Text::Hunspell
          on most systems. Basically replace my broken way of checking for
          libhunspell by looking up pkgconfig using ExtUtils::PkgConfig.
          Thanks to David Gutteridge for teaching me how to do it!

        Improved main POD documentation for Hunspell.pm.
        Fixes RT#84964. Thanks to Paul Flo Williams for the patch.
        (https://github.com/cosimo/perl5-text-hunspell/pull/2)

        DEPRECATED the delete() method, and implemented proper
        object handles in the hunspell XS glue. Again, thanks to
        Paul Flo Williams for patch and test case. Closes RT#84054.

        Implemented new add_dic() function from hunspell API.
        Fixes RT#83765. Thanks to Paul Flo Williams for patch
        and test case.

        Fixed RT#79630 incorrect encoding of Hunspell.pm POD documentation.
        Thanks to Paul for the patch.

        Fixed t/02_pod.t test due to newest Test::Pod and
        missing =encoding directive. Thanks to SHLOMIF for
        the patch.
