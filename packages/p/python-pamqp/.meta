  <description>pamqp is a pure-python AMQP 0-9-1 frame encoder and decoder.

pamqp is not a end-user client library for talking to RabbitMQ but
rather is used by client libraries for marshaling and unmarshaling
AMQP frames.

AMQP class/method command class mappings can be found in the
pamqp.specification module while actual frame encoding and
encoding should be run through the pamqp.frame module.
