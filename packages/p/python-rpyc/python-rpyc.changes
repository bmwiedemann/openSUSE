-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 24 10:59:46 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 4.0.2
  * fix default hostname for ipv6 in rpyc_classic.py
  * fix ThreadPoolServer not working
  4.0.1
  * fix ValueError during install due to absolute PATH in SOURCES.txt 
  4.0.0 (see upstream Release Change Log for more)
  * classic.teleport_function now executes the function in the 
    connection’s namespace by default
  * Changed signature of Service.on_connect and on_disconnect, 
    adding the connection as argument.
  * Changed signature of Service.__init__, removing the connection 
    argument
  * no longer store connection as self._conn.
  * SlaveService is now split into two asymetric classes: 
    SlaveService and MasterService. If you want old SlaveService
    behaviour, use ClassicService
  * Removed modules rpyc.experimental.splitbrain and rpyc.experimental.retunnel.
  * bin/rpyc_classic.py will bind to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 by default
  * Exposed attributes no longer hide plain attributes if one 
    otherwise has the required permissions to access the plain attribute.

    globals dict

  * handle timeouts cumulatively
  * fix __hash__ for netrefs

    before importing for rpyc. Client connections can already be made
    without further changes to rpyc, just using gevent’s monkey patching.
  * fix problem with MongoDB, or more generally any remote objects 
    that have a catch-all __getattr__
  * service can now easily override protocol handlers, by updating 
    conn._HANDLERS in _connect or on_connect.
- implement multibuild to fix some tests, skip some other failing tests

Tue Dec  4 12:53:57 UTC 2018 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Remove superfluous devel dependency for noarch package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 16 15:28:23 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 3.4.4
  * Fix refcount leakage when unboxing from cache (`#196`_)
  * Fix TypeError when dispatching exceptions on py2 (unicode)
  * Respect ``rpyc_protocol_config`` for default Service getattr
  * Support unix domain sockets
  * Use first accessible server in ``connect_by_service``
  * Fix deadlock problem with logging
  * Fix timeout problem for long commands
- Update to 3.4.3
  * Add missing endpoints config in ThreadPoolServer
  * Fix jython support
  * Improve documentation
- Update to 3.4.2
  * Fix ``export_function`` on python 3.6
- Update to 3.4.1
  * Fix issue high-cpu polling
  * Fix filename argument in logging
  * Improved log messages
  * Drop support for python 3.2 and py 2.5
- Update to 3.4.0
  * Add keepalive interface
  * Various fixes
- Update to 3.3.0
  * RPyC integrates with `plumbum <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plumbum>`_; plumbum is required
    for some features, like ``rpyc_classic.py`` and   *zero deploy  *, but the core of the library
    doesn't require it. It is, of course, advised to have it installed.
  * ``SshContext``, ``SshTunnel`` classes killed in favor of plumbum's SSH tunneling. The interface
    doesn't change much, except that ``ssh_connect`` now accept a ``plumbum.SshMachine`` instance
    instead of ``SshContext``.
  * Zero deploy: deploy RPyC to a remote machine over an SSH connection and form an SSH tunnel
    connected to it, in just one line of code. All you need is SSH access and a Python interpreter
    installed on the remote machine.
  * Dropping Python 2.4 support. RPyC now requires Python 2.5 - 3.3.
  * rpycd - a well-behaved daemon for ``rpyc_classic.py``, based on
    `python-daemon <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/>`_
  * The ``OneShotServer`` is now exposed by ``rpyc_classic -m oneshot``
  * ``scripts`` directory renamed ``bin``
  * Introducing ``Splitbrain Python`` - running code on remote machines transparently. Although tested,
    it is still considered experimental.
  * Removing the ``BgServerThread`` and all polling/timeout hacks in favor of a "global background
    reactor thread" that handles all incoming transport from all connections. This should solve
    all threading issues once and for all.
  * Added ``MockClassicConnection`` - a mock RPyC "connection" that allows you to write code that runs
    either locally or remotely without modification
  * Added ``teleport_function``

  - Added SSH tunneling support (ssh_connect)
  - Added restricted object wrapping
  - Several fixes to AsyncResult and weak references
  - Added the ThreadPoolServer
  - Fixed some minor (harmless) races that caused tracebacks occasionally when
    server-threads terminated
  - Fixes issues #8, #41, #42, #43, #46, and #49.
  - Converted all CRLF to LF (#40)
  - Dropped TLSlite integration (#45). We’ve been dragging this corpse for too
    long

  - Python 3.0-3.2 support
- 3.1.0
  - Supports CPython 2.4-2.7, IronPython, and Jython
  - tlslite has been ported to python 2.5-2.7 (the original library targeted
    2.3 and 2.4)
  - Initial python 3 support – not finished!
  - Moves to a more conventional directory structure
  - Moves to more standard facilities (logging, nosetests)
  - Solves a major performance issue with the BgServingThread (#32), by
    removing the contention between the two threads that share the connection
  - Fixes lots of issues concerning the ForkingServer (#3, #7, and #15)
  - Many small bug fixes (#16, #13, #4, etc.)
  - Integrates with the built-in ssl module for SSL support

  - Fixes typos, running pylint, etc.
  - Breakage from 3.0.7:
    - Removing egg builds (we’re pure python, and eggs just messed up the
      build)
    - Package layout changed drastically, and some files were renamed
    - The servers/ directory was renamed scripts/
    - classic_server.py was renamed rpyc_classic.py
    - They scripts now install to your python scripts directory (no longer
      part of the package), e.g. C:\python27\Scripts
    - rpyc_classic.py now takes --register in order to register, instead of
      --dont-register, which was a silly choice
    - classic.tls_connect, factory.tls_connect were renamed tlslite_connect,
      to distinguish it from the new ssl_connect
