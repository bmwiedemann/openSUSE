%description
This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module from a
Makefile.PL. It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by Andy
Dougherty and the perl5-porters.

It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several subroutines that
can be individually overridden. Each subroutine returns the text it wishes
to have written to the Makefile.

As there are various Make programs with incompatible syntax, which use
operating system shells, again with incompatible syntax, it is important
for users of this module to know which flavour of Make a Makefile has been
written for so they'll use the correct one and won't have to face the
possibly bewildering errors resulting from using the wrong one.

On POSIX systems, that program will likely be GNU Make; on Microsoft
Windows, it will be either Microsoft NMake, DMake or GNU Make. See the
section on the L</"MAKE"> parameter for details.

ExtUtils::MakeMaker (EUMM) is object oriented. Each directory below the
current directory that contains a Makefile.PL is treated as a separate
object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of Makefiles
with a single invocation of WriteMakefile().

All inputs to WriteMakefile are Unicode characters, not just octets. EUMM
seeks to handle all of these correctly. It is currently still not possible
to portably use Unicode characters in module names, because this requires
Perl to handle Unicode filenames, which is not yet the case on Windows.

See L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker::FAQ> for details of the design and usage.
