  - use a different method to mark executable built from "pp --clean ..."
    - scripts/par.pl: don't patch the string "__PASS_PAR_CLEAN__               \0" in the
      "boot" section of the executable and ...
    - myldr/boot.c: ... stop looking for the patched string
    - scripts/par.pl: add "\0CLEAN" in lieu of "\0CACHE" (and drop the 40-byte
      cache name below that) in the "trailer" section when generating a packed
      executable when META.yml indicates "--clean" was specified)
    - myldr/mktmpdir.c: allow "\0CLEAN" as an alternative to "\0CACHE"
      and set PAR_CLEAN=1 in that case
    - myldr/mktmpdir.c: implement find_par_magic() akin the one in script/par.pl
  - better CLT detection in MacOS (#70) [plk <Philip@kime.org.uk>]

  - Fix #66: patch myldr/boot for "pp --clean ..." without side effects
    - make sure myldr/boot contains exactly one string of the form
      "__PASS_PAR_CLEAN__               \0" so that there are no
      duplicates that may get split on chunk boundaries
      (myldr/boot_embedded_files.c)
    - simplify patching of this string (in $loader) to
      "__PASS_PAR_CLEAN__=1             \0" in script/par.pl
    - add a test for #66 (check for ephemeral vs persistent cache directory)
  - Revert "Fixes #62: rs6000_71 (AIX) "An offset in the .loader section header is too large.""
    PAR_CLEAN is set too late: at this point PAR_TEMP has already
    been set (and populated) to a persistent cache directory
    (/tmp/par-USER/cache-SHA1) instead of an ephemeral one (/tmp/par-USER/temp-PID).
  - Some code cleanup
    - replace some magic numbers with constants
    - use string interpolation (instead of concatenation)
    - clean up some convoluted C code

  - Fix #62: rs6000_71 (AIX) "An offset in the .loader section header is too large."
    Communicate pp option "--clean" to the generated executable in a
    different way. Previously this was done by patching "__ENV_PAR_..." strings
    **in the executable being built** and interpreting these strings in
    par.pl **at runtime**. Though hacky, this seemingly worked on any OS
    (without rendering the executable invalid).
    But the only information ever passed was the value of PAR_CLEAN and this was
    gleaned at build time from the value of JSONPath $par.clean from META.yml
    in the zip (set by pp by option "--clean").
    Instead read and interpret "META.yml" in par.pl **at runtime**.
  - Fix: merge PR #58 from Philip@kime.org.uk:
    Adding support for running MacOS Universal binaries created via 'lipo'
    from already pp'ed and signed thin binaries
  - Make writing stuff more robust: check return value of print()
    and close() in some places.

  - Fix #25: unexpected interaction between pp options "--compile" and "--module Foo::"
    scan_deps_runtime() is called for all detected Foo:: modules, but
    modules by themselves are typically not suitable for dynamic scanning
    (causing lots of spurious warnings for "--compile").

  - Rethink use of Filter::PodStrip.
    
    Do not add directives 
  
    #line 1 "file"
  
    to packed modules except for "embdeded" files.
    We still add these directives to "embedded" files as these are extracted 
    with mangled names which makes it hard to make sense of warn() or die() messages
    caused by them. These are all core modules and don't reference __FILE__.
  
    This should make use of __FILE__ in packed modules work without
    workarounds. __FILE__ is typically used to refer to installed non-module
    resources, e.g.
    
      # MIME::Types
      my $db = File::Spec->catfile(dirname(__FILE__), 'types.db');
    
      # Mozilla::CA
      my $ca_file = File::Spec->catfile(dirname(__FILE__), "CA", "cacert.pem");
    
      # Mojo::File (__FILE__ used implicitly by caller())
      sub curfile { __PACKAGE__->new(Cwd::realpath((caller)[1])) }
    
    Hence, remove known workarounds from Filter::PatchContent and add a test.
    
  - Fix RT#130685: core module detection doesn't work with -Duserelocatableinc

  - Fix RT#129312: Code signing for OSX
    
    Avoid Archive::Zip::Archive error "can't find EOCD signature" for pp'ed
    executables with lots of stuff appended (e.g. by OSX codesign).
    
    Note: This requires the corresponding fix in PAR in 1.016, 
    hence bump its required version.
      
    Add a test by appending 512 kB to a pp'ed executable.
  
  - Fix issue GitHub#15 (doesn't build with a relocatable version of perl)
    
    If the perl used to build PAR::Packer is a relocatable perl,
    i.e. it was build with -Duserelocatableinc, then myldr/par will
    also be relocatable. Hence, the automagical default @INC for myldr/par
    is something like ("myldr/../lib/5.x.y", 
    "myldr/../lib/site_perl/5.x.y", ...) which won't find any modules.

  - Fix RT#129312: Code signing for OSX
    
    Apply pull request from Philip Kime, adds a small program that will fix up
    an executable generated by pp so that MacOS codesigning will accept it,
    see contrib/pp_osx_codesign_fix/pp_osx_codesign_fix.c
  
    Since codesigning will append currently ~180 KB to an executable, increase the
    offsets from the end of the file where Archive::Zip and PAR::Packer will
    look for their respective signatures.
  
  - Fix GitHub issue #12: sha1.c warnings due to inconsistent USE_64_BIT_INT
    
    Do not "inline" sha1.c (into main.c and boot.c vi mktmp.c), instead
    just link to it. There's no reason that callers of
    sha_init/sha_update/sha_final should know about the implementation of SHA_INFO.
  
    myldr/sha1.c: stop including perl.h etc, instead pass the necessary #define's 
    via the compile command
  
  - Fix GitHub issue #13: `par.exe -b` failure with Portable::Config
      
    Note to users of Strawberry Perl *portable* installations: 
    There's a bad interaction between a Strawberry *portable* installation if you
    also have a *standard* Strawberry installation installed in C:\strawberry.
    Under certain conditions, parl created by the portable installation
    may have have a built-in @INC of [ C:\strawberry\perl\lib, C:\strawberry\perl\site\lib, 
    C:\strawberry\perl\vendor\lib ], i.e. pointing to the *standard* installation.
    This will cause it to load modules from the *standard* installation. If the versions
    of the two installations are different, this may cause weird failures.
  
  - Always require Digest::SHA, remove ugly alternatives
  
  - Make "pp -e 0" work, apparently nobody noticed

  - Cope with the fact that PL_statbuf is gone since Perl 5.27.x.
    
    This breaks PAR::Packer on systems where Perl's "Stat_t" is not
    the same as "struct stat", notably Windows.
  
  - Extract-embedded.pl: list (but not extract) the embedded files 
    if no directory is given
  
  - Use the long option name "--link" in messages (as "-l" may easily be

    - libraries where packed into the wrong location in the zip

  - no changes to modules and scripts, only fixes for configure, build and test
  
  - require a version of IPC::Run3 that gets shell quoting on Windows right
  
  - restructure how we find the files to embed into boot.c
  
  - avoid an error with newer gcc: "error: 'for' loop initial declarations 
    are only allowed in C99 or C11 mode"

    - guard against Module::ScanDeps::_find_in_inc() returning ()
  
  - Fail early when packing with a version of Perl
    that's different frome the one PAR::Packer was built with.
  
    Scenario: User has built and installed PAR::Packer (or got it
    pre-packaged), then installs a newer version of Perl, then does
  
      pp -o foo.exe foo.pl
  
    But running foo.exe then fails with
  
      foo.exe
  
      C:\Users\jon\AppData\Local\Temp\parlzcPb.exe: Perl lib version (5.24.1) doesn't match executable 'perl.exe' version (5.24.0) at C:/Perl64/lib/Config.pm line 62.
      Compilation failed in require at C:/Perl64/lib/Errno.pm line 10.
      ...
      C:\Perl64\site in/pp: Failed to extract a parl from 'PAR::StrippedPARL::Static' to file 'C:\Users\jon\AppData\Local\Temp\parl3swwQJc.exe' at C:/Perl64/site/lib/PAR/Packer.pm line 1184, <DATA> line 1.
  
    Now, pp will fail and with a more useful message.
  
  - Switch from Module::Install to ExtUtils::MakeMaker
  
  - Rewrite the library search (for "pp --link ...")
    - start with $Config{libpth} which is *not* the runtime loader (e.g.
      ld.so on Linux) search path, but rather the linker (ld) search path -
      but it's the best guess without having to grok /etc/ld.so.conf
    - augment that with $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} or similar
  
  - Rework how we determine the name under which a library should be installed
    - use objdump (on Linux and other ELF-based OS) and otool on Darwin
    - fall back to "chasing symlinks" otherwise
  
  - Remove PAR_ARGV_*, PAR_ARGC stuff from script/par.pl and myldr/boot.c.
    - Dunno what problem this obscure way of passing the command line arguments
      from a packed executable to the custom Perl interpreter was intended
      to fix, but arguments pass just fine through execvp (or spawnvp)
      to perl_parse.
  
  - Only set the environment variable for the shared library search path
    (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH) that is relevant for the operating system
    that we're running on
  
  - Use DynaLoader::dl_findfile to locate DLLs instead of homegrown stuff.
  
  - Remove "par_base" - prebuilt .par's haven't been available for ages

  - Fix RT #99231: Problem with PAR::Packer 1.022 on Perl 5.20.1 and earlier

- Update to 1.023:
  - Fix RT #99231: Problem with PAR::Packer 1.022 on Perl 5.20.1 and earlier
  - Fix RT #63939: The behaviour of "pp --link ..." is subtly different between OSX and Linux
  - Bump required version of Module::ScanDeps,
    makes t/90-rt59710.t pass again on perl 5.21.x
  - die if a requested shared library (option -l) can't be found.
  - Add a patch rule so that Mozilla::CA finds its (extracted) cacert.pem file.
  - Upgrade to Module::Install 1.14.

- Update to 1.022:
  - Fix RT#98955: installation fails | Can't locate String/ShellQuote.pm
  - Simply enclose the filenames in double quotes, should work on both
    *nix and Windows in all reasonable scenarios.
  - Drop incorrectly specified 'Digital signature support' "feature": simply
    "recommends" the required modules.

- Update to 1.021:
  - Fix #98791: PAR-Packer fails to build with DWIMPerl/Strawberry Perl due to unquoted path name

- Update to 1.020:
  - Implement option --xargs for pp
  - Update to Module::Install 1.10

- Update to 1.019:
  - Fix RT #96288: PAR::Packer unable to build under Win32/ActivePerl v5.14.2
        RT #96739: "bsd_glob" is not defined on perl 5.14.x and earlier

- Update to 1.018:
  - [DJIBEL] tkpp 1.4 : Since PAR::Packer 1.015, tkpp doesn't work
  - Use bsd_glob() instead of glob() to avoid problems with patterns that
    contain whitespace
  - Fix RT #93008: install failure with ubuntu / puppet

- Update to 1.017:
  RT #84588: OSX: incorrect detection of gcc (unsupported option '-static-libgcc')
  merged with:
  - RT #90198: PAR::Packer fails to compile in Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks
  - RT #91086: PAR-Packer-1.016 fails to install on OSX)

  clang on OSX pretends to be gcc, but doesn't implement gcc's option "-static-libgcc" 
  - use this option only on Windows (when using the MingW toolchain).

  Drop a test that was using Inline::C just to wrap native execvp().
  - It caused failures on CPAN Testers (if accidentally Inline was
    installed) that were unrelated to PAR::Packer.

- Update to 1.016:
    RT #90870: Segmentation fault (core dumped) (MooX::Options)
    - any "die" in a packed executable causes the executable to segfault
      (at least on Linux and Perl 5.18.1)
    - remove a line from XS code that sets an internal perl variable

- Update to 1.015:
  RT #82916: Terminating during unpack results in corrupted cache, 
             failure on next start
  - apply (slightly modified) patch from shutton@pobox.com, thanks!

  RT #88297 (-M crashes pp if option contains backslashes)
  - _add_file(): do _not_ use $zip->memberNamed(...) to refer to the
                 just added Archive::Zip::Member; instead use the
                 return value of $zip->addFile or $zip->addString 

  minor changes
  - use File::Spec::Functions, get rid of ugly File::Spec->... calls 
  - set $pre_res using catfile() instead of hardcoding a backslash;
    this might help on Cygwin
  - fix -Mblib option for run_with_inc.pl: we want the blib in the top 
    level directory

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  5 18:28:38 CEST 2013 - mls@suse.de

- add libperl_requires, as we link against libperl and thus
  need a specific version of perl

- Update to 1.010
* Bug fixes, etc.

    - Adapt for changes in XSloader.pm (>= 0.14)
      The old rule in PatchContent.pm no longer works with this version; 
      this effectively disables how PAR::Packer intercepts loading of DLLs.
      Add a new rule for the code in recent XSloader.pm.
      NOTE: This problem affected all users of Perl >= 5.14.0 as this
      was the first stable release to include XSLoader 0.14.
      Also affected: Strawberry (at least) 5.12.3 which also comes
      with XSLoader 0.14.

    - RT #67681: can't write file
      During packing several temp files are created in the user's
      working directory - this will fail if the working directory is read-only.
      Fix up all calls to File::Temp::tempfile with TMPDIR => 1 
      and drop the bogus check whether cwd is writable.

      NOTE: test 32 of t/20-pp.t may fail. I have received conflicting reports 
      about this, but just wanted to make a release to get wider coverage.

  * Bug fixes, etc.
  
      - RT #53463: PAR::Packer 1.002 on HPUX 11.23 PA-RISC issue
        (HPUX) patch from Lars-Gunnar Taube
        - add SHLIB_PATH to ld_path_keys in myldr/mktmpdir.c
        - call "chatr +s enable ..." on the extracted custom perl
  
      - RT #65535: Unable to run perl script packaged with pp under cygwin
        on another Windows XP installation
  
        - lib/PAR/Filter/PatchContent.pm: patch AutoLoader.pm to add "cygwin"
         to the list of "is_dosish" $^O identifiers; otherwise
         AutoLoader::find_filename() will mangle filenames that start with
         a drive letter
        - script/par.pl: use PAR::Filter::PatchContent to patch any modules
         embedded in the packed excutable; this supersedes the ad hoc
         patching of XSLoader.pm and will now also patch AutoLoader.pm
        - myldr/Makefile.PL: when generating $parl_exe or $parldy_exe make
         sure that we use the PAR::* modules (e.g PAR::Filter::PatchContent)
         from the build environment rather than a possibly
         installed older version
  
      - "Fix" #64485: pp PodStrip module included
        document how to inhibit pod stripping (copied from PAR.pm POD)
  
      - bump required Module::ScanDeps to 1.01 (hopefully fixes failures
        in t/90-rt59710.t with Perl 5.13.x)
  
      - reworked the build system a bit to fix recurring problems with dmake
        on Windows and parallel makes in general:
  
        - copy myldr/{parl,parldyn} to blib/scripts from myldr/Makefile
        - myldr/Makefile was completely handcrafted; try to generate it
         using standard ExtUtils::MakeMaker tools as much as possible
        - generate myldr/{Dynamic,Static}.pm from templates {Dynamic,Static}.in
        - rename static.c to boot.c
  
      - add "configure_requires" for ExtUtils::Embed
  
      - pick up some POD spelling fixes from Debian
        (thanks, Jonathan Yu <jawnsy@cpan.org>)

Tue Nov 23 19:07:55 CET 2010 - pth@suse.de

- Package as bz2 to have it build on SLE10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 23 16:44:08 CET 2010 - pth@suse.de

- initial package 1.008
  * created by cpanspec 1.78
- BuildRequire perl(Test::Pod).
- Don't run multiple instances of make as Makefile can't cope with it.
- Create a separate spec for running the tests.
