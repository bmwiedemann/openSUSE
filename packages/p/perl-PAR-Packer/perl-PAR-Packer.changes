  - Fix #27: "pp -u broken in perl 5.32"
    ignore "pp -u ..." (with a warning) for Perl >= 5.31.6
  - Fix #25: unexpected interaction between pp options "--compile" and "--module Foo::"
    scan_deps_runtime() is called for all detected Foo:: modules, but
    modules by themselves are typically not suitable for dynamic scanning
    (causing lots of spurious warnings for "--compile").
  - cleanup argv handling in myldr/main.c
  - placate cperl ("Attempt to change hash while iterating over it.")

  - Rethink use of Filter::PodStrip.
    
    Do not add directives 
  
    #line 1 "file"
  
    to packed modules except for "embdeded" files.
    We still add these directives to "embedded" files as these are extracted 
    with mangled names which makes it hard to make sense of warn() or die() messages
    caused by them. These are all core modules and don't reference __FILE__.
  
    This should make use of __FILE__ in packed modules work without
    workarounds. __FILE__ is typically used to refer to installed non-module
    resources, e.g.
    
      # MIME::Types
      my $db = File::Spec->catfile(dirname(__FILE__), 'types.db');
    
      # Mozilla::CA
      my $ca_file = File::Spec->catfile(dirname(__FILE__), "CA", "cacert.pem");
    
      # Mojo::File (__FILE__ used implicitly by caller())
      sub curfile { __PACKAGE__->new(Cwd::realpath((caller)[1])) }
    
    Hence, remove known workarounds from Filter::PatchContent and add a test.
    
  - Fix RT#130685: core module detection doesn't work with -Duserelocatableinc
    
    Original patch by Frank.Lichtenheld@Sophos.com, thanx!
    Added a test for this.

  - Fix RT#129312: Code signing for OSX
    
    Avoid Archive::Zip::Archive error "can't find EOCD signature" for pp'ed
    executables with lots of stuff appended (e.g. by OSX codesign).
    
    Note: This requires the corresponding fix in PAR in 1.016, 
    hence bump its required version.
      
    Add a test by appending 512 kB to a pp'ed executable.
  
  - Fix issue GitHub#15 (doesn't build with a relocatable version of perl)
    
    If the perl used to build PAR::Packer is a relocatable perl,
    i.e. it was build with -Duserelocatableinc, then myldr/par will
    also be relocatable. Hence, the automagical default @INC for myldr/par
    is something like ("myldr/../lib/5.x.y", 
    "myldr/../lib/site_perl/5.x.y", ...) which won't find any modules.

  1.048  2019-04-29
  
  - Fix RT#129312: Code signing for OSX
    
    Apply pull request from Philip Kime, adds a small program that will fix up
    an executable generated by pp so that MacOS codesigning will accept it,
    see contrib/pp_osx_codesign_fix/pp_osx_codesign_fix.c
  
    Since codesigning will append currently ~180 KB to an executable, increase the
    offsets from the end of the file where Archive::Zip and PAR::Packer will
    look for their respective signatures.
  
  - Fix GitHub issue #12: sha1.c warnings due to inconsistent USE_64_BIT_INT
    
    Do not "inline" sha1.c (into main.c and boot.c vi mktmp.c), instead
    just link to it. There's no reason that callers of
    sha_init/sha_update/sha_final should know about the implementation of SHA_INFO.
  
    myldr/sha1.c: stop including perl.h etc, instead pass the necessary #define's 
    via the compile command
  
  - Fix GitHub issue #13: `par.exe -b` failure with Portable::Config
      
    Note to users of Strawberry Perl *portable* installations: 
    There's a bad interaction between a Strawberry *portable* installation if you
    also have a *standard* Strawberry installation installed in C:\strawberry.
    Under certain conditions, parl created by the portable installation
    may have have a built-in @INC of [ C:\strawberry\perl\lib, C:\strawberry\perl\site\lib, 
    C:\strawberry\perl\vendor\lib ], i.e. pointing to the *standard* installation.
    This will cause it to load modules from the *standard* installation. If the versions
    of the two installations are different, this may cause weird failures.
  
  - Always require Digest::SHA, remove ugly alternatives
  
  - Make "pp -e 0" work, apparently nobody noticed

  1.047  2018-08-19
  
  Disable failing test cases in (Windows only) test t/90-rt122949.t
  
  Add .SEQUENTIAL to force non-parallel build when using dmake (e.g. on Windows)
  
  1.046  2018-08-18
  
  - Fix RT#126280: 90-rt122949.t fails when "Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support" is enabled
  
  - Fix https://github.com/rschupp/PAR-Packer/issues/7 "Parallel build rules dependancy problem"
    
    Instead of fighting GNU make and EUMM, just punt and add a .NOTPARALLEL
    target. Yeah, I know that this is specific to GNU make (though some
    other make implementations support it, too).
  
  - Add bugtracker to META.yml
  
  1.045  2018-06-12
  
  - Fix RT#125503: Fix build with 64-bit perl-5.28.0
      
    Merged patch by Steve Hay, thanks!
  
  1.044  2018-06-06
  
  - Cope with the fact that PL_statbuf is gone since Perl 5.27.x.
    
    This breaks PAR::Packer on systems where Perl's "Stat_t" is not
    the same as "struct stat", notably Windows.
  
  - Extract-embedded.pl: list (but not extract) the embedded files 
    if no directory is given
  
  - Use the long option name "--link" in messages (as "-l" may easily be
    confused with "-I" when view in a sans serif font).
  
  1.043  2018-04-03
  
  - Fix test failures on Windows
  
  1.042  2018-04-02
  
  - Fix PAR-Packer#5 "unintended glob expansion on strawberry win32?"
     
    On Windows using Mingw set _CRT_glob=0 also in parl (the custom
    Perl interpreter).
  
  - Fix RT #124445 "Par-Packer 'falsifies' PerlTk server() and Win32 GetOSName() and GetOSVersion() output on Windows 10"
     
    Add <compatibility> section to pp.manifest
    (cf. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn481241(v=vs.85).aspx)
    to make par.exe "Windows 10 aware".
  
  - Add dependencies on stuff in myldr/winres to myldr/Makefile
  
  - Fix parallel make: install modules into blib *before* recursing into "myldr"
  
  1.041  2017-11-08
  
  - Fix problem with --link libraries on MacOS
    - libraries where packed into the wrong location in the zip
    - hence they were not extracted into the cache area where they could
      be found via DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    - hence the packed executable either couldn't find them or found incompatible
      versions outside the cache area
    - reported by Phil Kime
  
  1.040  2017-10-21
  
  - no changes to modules and scripts, only fixes for configure, build and test
  
  - require a version of IPC::Run3 that gets shell quoting on Windows right
  
  - restructure how we find the files to embed into boot.c
  
  - avoid an error with newer gcc: "error: 'for' loop initial declarations 
    are only allowed in C99 or C11 mode"
  
  - fix tests when running without "." in @INC even (even in tests)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  8 07:29:29 UTC 2017 - coolo@suse.com

- remove -test subspec (which ignored errors in make check anyway)
- add 50ff73f26855151910e039b8480473024ae08b8a.patch to fix tests
  with latest perl

  1.038  2017-09-27
  
  - Fix "RT#122949: PAR-Packer-1.37 executables split arguments containing whitespace"
    - on Windows, quote elements of argv array passed to spawnvp();
      algorithm stolen from Win32::ShellQuote.
  
  - introduce helper t/utils.pl to streamline tests 
  
  - require IPC::Run3 for test
  
  - make test work with "dot-less" perl and PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=0
  
  1.037  2017-05-28
  
  - Fix RT#121268 for PAR-Packer: error installing PAR-Packer on windows10 ( 64Bit )
    - on Windows, make dl_findfile() search first in the directory containing
      the perl executable (to avoid erroneous hits in other members of PATH)
  
  - Fix RT#120038: [PATCH] Fix build for VS2015 (VC++ 14)
    and merge pull request from Steve Hay (shay@cpan.org)
    - makes PAR::Packer work with VisualStudio 2015. Thanks, Steve!
  
  - Fix RT#120041: --exclude gets confused by missing modules
    - guard against Module::ScanDeps::_find_in_inc() returning ()
  
  - Fail early when packing with a version of Perl
    that's different frome the one PAR::Packer was built with.
  
    Scenario: User has built and installed PAR::Packer (or got it
    pre-packaged), then installs a newer version of Perl, then does
  
      pp -o foo.exe foo.pl
  
    But running foo.exe then fails with
  
      foo.exe
  
      C:\Users\jon\AppData\Local\Temp\parlzcPb.exe: Perl lib version (5.24.1) doesn't match executable 'perl.exe' version (5.24.0) at C:/Perl64/lib/Config.pm line 62.
      Compilation failed in require at C:/Perl64/lib/Errno.pm line 10.
      ...
      C:\Perl64\site in/pp: Failed to extract a parl from 'PAR::StrippedPARL::Static' to file 'C:\Users\jon\AppData\Local\Temp\parl3swwQJc.exe' at C:/Perl64/site/lib/PAR/Packer.pm line 1184, <DATA> line 1.
  
    Now, pp will fail and with a more useful message.
  
  - Switch from Module::Install to ExtUtils::MakeMaker
  
  - Rewrite the library search (for "pp --link ...")
    - start with $Config{libpth} which is *not* the runtime loader (e.g.
      ld.so on Linux) search path, but rather the linker (ld) search path -
      but it's the best guess without having to grok /etc/ld.so.conf
    - augment that with $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} or similar
  
  - Rework how we determine the name under which a library should be installed
    - use objdump (on Linux and other ELF-based OS) and otool on Darwin
    - fall back to "chasing symlinks" otherwise
  
  - Remove PAR_ARGV_*, PAR_ARGC stuff from script/par.pl and myldr/boot.c.
    - Dunno what problem this obscure way of passing the command line arguments
      from a packed executable to the custom Perl interpreter was intended
      to fix, but arguments pass just fine through execvp (or spawnvp)
      to perl_parse.
  
  - Only set the environment variable for the shared library search path
    (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH) that is relevant for the operating system
    that we're running on
  
  - Use DynaLoader::dl_findfile to locate DLLs instead of homegrown stuff.
  
  - Remove "par_base" - prebuilt .par's haven't been available for ages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  1 15:01:41 UTC 2017 - josef.moellers@suse.com

      NOTE: "use lib '.'" does *not* work in this case

  - Move to GitHub. Thanks, OpenFoundry, for years of service.
    - add Perl_5 LICENSE file, make "repository" point to GitHub
    - always refer to the included LICENSE file

  - Fix RT#116254: Compilation error under strawberry perl 5.24 x64

    s/PP_VERSION/PAR_PACKER_VERSION/ as Strawberry Perl also defines
    PP_VERSION (in c/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/wincrypt.h)

- Update to 1.034:

  - Fix RT#116056: Fixes for Cygwin build of PAR::Packer
    - detect whether we're using a 32-bit or 64-bit perl
    - fix elision of "-l<perl lib>" from $static_ldflags
    - add $static_ldflags back to $boot_ldflags

  - Add information to packed executable about which version
    of PAR::Packer was used to build it (suggested by Johan Vromans):
    - accessible from the packaged Perl script as $PAR::Packer::VERSION
    - by looking for the string "Packed by PAR::Packer ..." in the executable
      itself (using "strings exe | grep ..." or the like)

  - Use ldd on cygwin, too
    - NOTE: a "system lib" on cygwin is either in /usr/bin
      or a Windows "system lib"

  RT #84588: OSX: incorrect detection of gcc (unsupported option '-static-libgcc')
  merged with:
  - RT #90198: PAR::Packer fails to compile in Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks
  - RT #91086: PAR-Packer-1.016 fails to install on OSX)

  clang on OSX pretends to be gcc, but doesn't implement gcc's option "-static-libgcc" 
  - use this option only on Windows (when using the MingW toolchain).

  Drop a test that was using Inline::C just to wrap native execvp().
  - It caused failures on CPAN Testers (if accidentally Inline was
    installed) that were unrelated to PAR::Packer.

- Update to 1.016:
    RT #90870: Segmentation fault (core dumped) (MooX::Options)
    - any "die" in a packed executable causes the executable to segfault
      (at least on Linux and Perl 5.18.1)

  - _add_file(): do _not_ use $zip->memberNamed(...) to refer to the

  minor changes
  - use File::Spec::Functions, get rid of ugly File::Spec->... calls 
  - set $pre_res using catfile() instead of hardcoding a backslash;
    this might help on Cygwin
  - fix -Mblib option for run_with_inc.pl: we want the blib in the top 
    level directory

- Update to 1.010
* Bug fixes, etc.

    - Adapt for changes in XSloader.pm (>= 0.14)
      The old rule in PatchContent.pm no longer works with this version; 
      this effectively disables how PAR::Packer intercepts loading of DLLs.
      Add a new rule for the code in recent XSloader.pm.
      NOTE: This problem affected all users of Perl >= 5.14.0 as this
      was the first stable release to include XSLoader 0.14.
      Also affected: Strawberry (at least) 5.12.3 which also comes
      with XSLoader 0.14.

    - RT #67681: can't write file
      During packing several temp files are created in the user's
      working directory - this will fail if the working directory is read-only.
      Fix up all calls to File::Temp::tempfile with TMPDIR => 1 
      and drop the bogus check whether cwd is writable.

      NOTE: test 32 of t/20-pp.t may fail. I have received conflicting reports 
      about this, but just wanted to make a release to get wider coverage.

- updated to 1.009
  * Bug fixes, etc.
  
      - RT #53463: PAR::Packer 1.002 on HPUX 11.23 PA-RISC issue
        (HPUX) patch from Lars-Gunnar Taube
        - add SHLIB_PATH to ld_path_keys in myldr/mktmpdir.c
        - call "chatr +s enable ..." on the extracted custom perl
  
      - RT #65535: Unable to run perl script packaged with pp under cygwin
        on another Windows XP installation
  
        - lib/PAR/Filter/PatchContent.pm: patch AutoLoader.pm to add "cygwin"
         to the list of "is_dosish" $^O identifiers; otherwise
         AutoLoader::find_filename() will mangle filenames that start with
         a drive letter
        - script/par.pl: use PAR::Filter::PatchContent to patch any modules
         embedded in the packed excutable; this supersedes the ad hoc
         patching of XSLoader.pm and will now also patch AutoLoader.pm
        - myldr/Makefile.PL: when generating $parl_exe or $parldy_exe make
         sure that we use the PAR::* modules (e.g PAR::Filter::PatchContent)
         from the build environment rather than a possibly
         installed older version
  
      - "Fix" #64485: pp PodStrip module included
        document how to inhibit pod stripping (copied from PAR.pm POD)
  
      - bump required Module::ScanDeps to 1.01 (hopefully fixes failures
        in t/90-rt59710.t with Perl 5.13.x)
  
      - reworked the build system a bit to fix recurring problems with dmake
        on Windows and parallel makes in general:
  
        - copy myldr/{parl,parldyn} to blib/scripts from myldr/Makefile
        - myldr/Makefile was completely handcrafted; try to generate it
         using standard ExtUtils::MakeMaker tools as much as possible
        - generate myldr/{Dynamic,Static}.pm from templates {Dynamic,Static}.in
        - rename static.c to boot.c
  
      - add "configure_requires" for ExtUtils::Embed
  
      - pick up some POD spelling fixes from Debian
        (thanks, Jonathan Yu <jawnsy@cpan.org>)
