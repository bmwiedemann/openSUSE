    * We have added first class support for find and replace across JupyterLab. It is currently supported in notebooks and text files and is extensible for other widgets who wish to support it.
    * We have integrated the JupyterLab Status Bar package into the core distribution. Extensions can add their own status to it as well.
    * We now include the JupyterHub extension in core JupyterLab, so you no longer need to install ``@jupyterlab/hub-extension``.

    * Performance fixes for text-based progress bars
    * Add support for rendering Vega 5 and Vega Lite 3 while keeping the existing Vega 4 and Vega Lite 2 renderers
    * Drag and drop console cells into a notebook or text editor
    * Drag and drop notebook cells into a console or text editor
    * The extension manager search now sorts extensions by the score assigned to them by NPM instead of alphabetically
    * Notify the user when a kernel is automatically restarted, for example, if crashes from an out of memory error

    * The keyboard shortcut system has been rewritten and now displays a list of system commands in the settings comments.
    * There are new settings for many following items, including:
      > Adds an option to shut down terminals and notebook kernels when they are closed
      > Scrolling past the end of a notebooks and text editor document
      > Text editor code folding, rulers, and active line highlighting
      > Markdown viewer options
      > Terminal scrollback and other settings
      > The autosave interval

      > Custom scrollbar styling for dark themes
  + Command Line Changes
    * Installing extensions will be quieter and adds a ``--debug`` to extension installing
    * We now support running JupyterLab when its application directory is a symlink
    * Add ``--all`` flag to ``labextension uninstall`` to remove all extensions
    * Adds the ability to override the base URLs from the config
    * Updates to workspaces CLI command
  + Extension Development Changes
    * We have rewritten how extensions provide keyboard shortcuts and interact with the settings system. If you previously defined keyboard shortcuts or used the settings mechanism, you will need to update your extension
    * We have renamed the plugin type from ``JupyterLabPlugin`` to ``JupyterFrontEndPlugin``. The application arg is also renamed from ``JupyterLab`` to  ``JupyterFrontEnd`` and some its functionality has been moved to a separate ``ILabShell`` plugin
    * The lab shell ``addToMainArea``, ``addToLeftArea``, ``addToTopArea``, ``addToRightArea``, and ``addToBottomArea`` functions have been replaced with a single ``add()`` function that takes the area as an argument. Replace ``addToMainArea(widget, options)`` with ``add(widget, 'main', options)``, etc.
    * Rename ``pageUrl`` to ``appUrl`` in the server connection
    * ``MainAreaWidget`` instances now forward update requests to their ``content``
    * The theme data attributes are renamed and moved to the document body element. If you are relying on these attributes in CSS to conditionally style based on the theme, you should update their names. For example ``data-theme-light`` is now ``data-jp-theme-light``.
    * Extensions which require CSS should no longer import their CSS files into their Javascript files. Instead, they should specify a root CSS file in the ``style`` attribute in their ``package.json``, and JupyterLab will automatically import that CSS file.
    * ``Dialog.prompt`` has been replaced by a number of type-specific dialogs such as ``InputDialog.getString``, ``InputDialog.getBoolean``, etc.
    * When a ``RenderMime`` widget is re-rendered, the default behavior is to remove any existing content in the DOM. This can be overridden if needed.
    * We have updated our internal TypeScript version to 3.5.1 and our compile target to ``ES2017``. Extensions may need to upgrade their TypeScript version and target as well.
    * We have updated the typings for some of the Kernel messages so that they better match the spec.
    * A ``connectionFailure`` signal has been added to some of the manager classes, which can be used to detect when a connection to the server is lost
    * Add rate limiting and polling utilities to ``coreutils``  to use for throttling and debouncing of API requests
    * Require session when instantiating terminal widget
    * Provides a signal to see what items are opened in a directory listing
    * Ads the ability to add widget above the main work area to a top header area
    * Renames ``contextMenuFirst`` to  ``contextMenuHitTest`` in the ``JupyterFrontEnd``
    * Removes the ``initialCommand`` arg from the terminal creation command.
    * Adds ``--jp-code-cursor-width0``, ``--jp-code-cursor-width1``, and ``--jp-code-cursor-width2`` variables to the themes to support changing the cursor width if you change the font size
    * Adds the ability to insert a new item to the toolbar before or after another item
    * Adds the ability for extensions to register new CodeMirror modes
    * We have removed the ``JUPYTERLAB_xxx_LOADER`` Webpack loaders, instead you should use the loader directly in the URL as Webpack supports it
    * Adds the ability to handle fragments for document widgets
    * We have added a  ``@jupyterlab/ui-components`` package that contains reusable React components to be used internally and in extensions. Feel free to use this to create extension UIs with consistent styles
    * The ``showErrorMessage`` function now lets you customize the buttons it uses
    * We now provide helpers for using React components within JupyterLab. If you were previously using ``ReactElementWidget`` you should switch to using ``ReactWidget``.
    * The share link command has been moved to its own extension so that it can be overridden
    * Creating a new services session now requires passing a kernel model instead of a kernel instance
    * We upgraded the Webpack raw file loader. The new version of the raw loader exports ES2015 modules, so this may require changes in extensions that import files using the raw loader. For example, if you did ``require('myfile.md')`` to get the content of `myfile.md` as a string, you now should import it using ES2015 `import` syntax, or use `require('myfile.md').default`.
    * Widget factories now can support custom cloning behavior from an optional source widget
    * We have renamed the type ``InstanceTracker`` to ``WidgetTracker``.
    * In order to add widgets to the main area (e.g. as in the old XKCD extension tutorial), the correct syntax is now ``app.shell.add(widget)`` or ``app.shell.add(widget, 'main')``,

  * New "Shutdown all" button  in the Running panel ([#3764](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3764))
  * Performance improvements wherein non-focused documents poll the server less ([#3931](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3931))
  * Changing the keyboard shortcut for singled-document-mode to something less easy to trigger ([#3889](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3889))

  * Always show the context menu in the file browser, even for an empty directory ([#4264](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4264)).
  * Handle asynchronous comm messages in the services library more correctly (Note: this means `@jupyterlab/services` is now at version 2.0!) ([[#4115](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4115)](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4115)).
  * Display the kernel banner in the console when a kernel is restarted to mark the restart ([[#3663](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3663)](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3663)).
