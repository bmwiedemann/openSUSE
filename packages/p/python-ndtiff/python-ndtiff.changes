- Update to 3.1.0
  * Fixes a bug where metadata was sometimes encoded using an
    incorrect encoding, see micro-manager/pycro-manager#467
    (comment)
  * This is the last one to be called ndtiff, upstream renamed to
    ndstorage, but consumers need to change their requirements too
- Version 3.0 (NDStorage)
  * In version 2 NDTiff files, even when not using multi-resolution
    pyramid features, the data were in a Full resolution directory.
    In v3.0 this was eliminated in favor of putting them directly
    in the top-level directory
  * An additional 4 bytes was added to bytes 16-20 of the header of
    each file containing the minor version of the format, thereby
    shifting back the summary metadata and it's header by 4 bytes
- Revert numpy restriction.
