- Only BuildRequire python38-backports.zoneinfo if python38-base is
  also present (i.e. do not require this when python38 is not a
  built python flavor).

- version update to 4.2
  4.2 (2022-04-02)
  - If TZ environment variable is set to /etc/localhost, and that's a link to
    a zoneinfo file, then tzlocal will now find the timezone name, and not
    just return a localtime TZ object.
  4.1 (2021-10-29)
  - No changes from 4.1b1.
  4.1b1 (2021-10-28)
  - It turns out a lot of Linux distributions make the links between zoneinfo
    aliases backwards, so instead of linking GB to Europe/London it actually
    links the other way. When /etc/localtime then links to Europe/London, and you
    also have a config file saying Europe/London, the code that checks if
    /etc/localtime is a symlink ends up at GB instead of Europe/London and
    we get an error, as it thinks GB and Europe/London are different zones.
    So now we check the symlink of all timezones in the uniqueness test. We still
    return the name in the config file, though, so you would only get GB or Zulu
    returned as the time zone instead of Europe/London or UTC if your only
    configuration is the /etc/localtime symlink, as that's checked last, and
    tzlocal will return the first configuration found.
  - The above change also means that GMT and UTC are no longer seen as synonyms,
    as zoneinfo does not see them as synonyms. This might be controversial,
    but you just have to live with it. Pick one and stay with it. ;-)
  4.0.2 (2021-10-26)
  - Improved the error message when you had a conflict including a
    /etc/localtime symlink.
  4.0.1 (2021-10-19)
  - A long time bug in Ubuntu docker images seem to not get fixed,
    so I added a workaround.
  4.0.1b1 (2021-10-18)
  - Handle UCT and Zulu as synonyms for UTC, while treating GMT and
    UTC as different.
  4.0 (2021-10-18)
  - No changes.
  4.0b5 (2021-10-18)
  - Fixed a bug in the Windows DST support.
  4.0b4 (2021-10-18)
  - Added support for turning off DST in Windows. That only works in
    whole hour timezones, and honestly, if you need to turn off DST,
    you should just use UTC as a timezone.
  4.0b3 (2021-10-08)
  - Returning pytz_deprecation_shim zones to lower the surprise for pytz users.
  - The Windows OS environment variable 'TZ' will allow an override for
    setting the timezone. The override timezone will be asserted for
    timezone validity bit not compared against the systems timezone offset.
    This allows for overriding the timezone when running tests.
  - Dropped support for Windows 2000, XP and Vista, supports Windows 7, 8 and 10.
  4.0b2 (2021-09-26)
  - Big refactor; Implemented get_localzone_name() functions.
  - Adding a Windows OS environment variable 'TZ' will allow an override for
    setting the timezone (also see 4.0b3).
  4.0b1 (2021-08-21)
  - Now finds and compares all the configs (under Unix-like systems) and
    tells you what files it found and how they conflict. This should make
    it a lot easier to figure out what goes wrong.
  3.0 (2021-08-13)
  - Modernized the packaging, moving to setup.cfg etc.
  - Handles if the text config files incorrectly is a TZ file. (revanSZ)
  3.0b1 (2020-09-21)
  - Dropped Python 2 support
  - Switched timezone provider from pytz to zoneinfo (PEP 615)
- python-mock is not required for build

Tue Jun  2 17:17:59 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1:
  - The is_dst flag is wrong for Europe/Dublin on some Unix releases.
  I changed to another way of determining if DST is in effect or not.
  - Added support for Python 3.7 and 3.8. Dropped 3.5 although it still works.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 31 12:31:37 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.0.0
  Major differences since 1.5.1
  .............................
  - When no time zone configuration can be find, tzlocal now return UTC.
    This is a major difference from 1.x, where an exception would be raised.
    This change is because Docker images often have no configuration at all,
    and the unix utilities will then default to UTC, so we follow that.
  - If tzlocal on Unix finds a timezone name in a /etc config file, then 
    tzlocal now verifies that the timezone it fouds has the same offset as
    the local computer is configured with. If it doesn't, something is
    configured incorrectly. (Victor Torres, regebro)
  - Get timezone via Termux `getprop` wrapper on Android. It's not officially
    supported because we can't test it, but at least we make an effort.
    (Jean Jordaan)
  Minor differences and bug fixes
  ...............................
  - Skip comment lines when parsing /etc/timezone. (Edward Betts)
  - Don't load timezone from current directory. (Gabriel Corona)
  - Now verifies that the config files actually contain something before
    reading them. (Zackary Welch, regebro)
  - Got rid of a BytesWarning (Mickaël Schoentgen)
  - Now handles if config file paths exists, but are directories.

- Use noun phrase in summary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  4 11:10:03 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Switch to github archive as per upstream recommendation:
  * the pypi archive fails tests due to wrong file->symlink conversions
- Update to 1.5.1:
  * increased test coverage.
  * No longer treats macOS as special, but as a unix.
  * get_windows_info.py is renamed to update_windows_mappings.py
  * Windows mappings now also contain mappings from deprecated zoneinfo names.
    (Preston-Landers, regebro)
