Wed Apr  1 17:02:33 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 0.4.2
  * PulseView session setups can now be saved/restored to and
    from *.pvs files.
  * Translation support was added to the GUI elements (and a first
    translation, German, is available). Please check the wiki for
    details on how you can contribute further translations.
  * There's a new protocol decoder selection subwindow with
    filtering capabilities, browing by decoder tags, auto-stacking
    of decoders where required, and more.
  * A new decoder "binary" output subwindow can show/save
    "OUTPUT_BINARY" type decoder data in various (decoder-specific)
    formats (WAV, PCAP, PNG, and many others). This also features
    a simple "hex view" for the data.
  * It is now possible to show/hide individual decoder annotation
    rows, and individual annotation classes. This is very handy
    when you're debugging a specific issue and only want to see
    certain classes of decoder annotations, e.g. "show me only CRC
    errors", "show me only parity errors and frame errors", or
    "show me only I²C NACKs" etc. etc.
  * Lots of UI and functionality improvements regarding cursors
    and markers.
  * Various new handy key shortcuts for zooming, moving around in
    the data, placing cursors, etc.
  * Various drawing and decoder/annotation performance improvements.
- This requires libsigrok >= 0.5.2 (already released for some time)

Tue Jun 13 20:52:15 UTC 2017 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Update to version 0.4.0
  * Add the concepts of sessions and views to PulseView:
    - Sessions represent individual files/device instances.
      Each session is represented as a tab in PulseView.
    - Views are different data representations of one specific session.
      For example, different views of a session can have different zoom levels,
      can be scrolled to different positions, etc. etc.
      Each view is a dock window within the respective session's tab.
    - The view docks can be repositioned, resized and extracted out into their
      own individual windows.
  * Add support for saving analog data to .sr files.
  * Lots of fixes and improvements
