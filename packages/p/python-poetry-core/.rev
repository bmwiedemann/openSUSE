  * Deprecate poetry.core.constraints.generic, which is replaced by

    according to PEP 685 (#476).
  * Fix an issue where sdist names were not normalized (#484).
- Release 1.2.0

    <comment>- Update to 1.4.0 
  ## Added
  * The PEP 517 metadata_directory is now respected as an input to
    the build_wheel hook (#487).
  ## Changed
  * Sources are now considered more carefully when dealing with
    dependencies with environment markers (#497).
  * EmptyConstraint is now hashable (#513).
  * ParseConstraintError is now raised on version and constraint
    parsing errors, and includes information on the package that
    caused the error (#514).
  ## Fixed
  * Fix an issue where invalid PEP 508 requirements were generated
    due to a missing space before semicolons (#510).
  * Fix an issue where relative paths were encoded into package
    requirements, instead of a file:// URL as required by PEP 508
    (#512).
