    <comment>- Update to 1.3.2
  * Fix an issue where the normalization was not applied to the
    path of an sdist built using a PEP 517 frontend (#495).
- Release 1.3.1
  * Fix an issue where a typing-driven assertion could be false at
    runtime, causing a failure during
    prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel (#492).
- Release 1.3.0
  * Add 3.11 to the list of available Python versions (#477).
  * Deprecate poetry.core.constraints.generic, which is replaced by
    poetry.core.packages.constraints (#482).
  * Deprecate poetry.core.semver, which is replaced by
    poetry.core.constraints.version (#482).
  * Fix an issue where versions were escaped wrongly when building
    the wheel name (#469).
  * Fix an issue where caret constraints of pre-releases with a
    major version of 0 resulted in an empty version range (#475).
  * Fix an issue where the names of extras were not normalized
    according to PEP 685 (#476).
  * Fix an issue where sdist names were not normalized (#484).
- Release 1.2.0
  * Added support for subdirectories in url dependencies (#398).
  * When setting an invalid version constraint an error is raised
    instead of silently setting &quot;any version&quot; (#461).
  * Allow more characters in author name (#411).
  * Fixed an issue where incorrect Requires-Dist information was
    generated when environment markers where used for optional
    packages (#462).
  * Fixed an issue where incorrect python constraints were parsed
    from environment markers (#457). (forwarded request 1009081 from bnavigator)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.4.0 
  ## Added
  * The PEP 517 metadata_directory is now respected as an input to
    the build_wheel hook (#487).
  ## Changed
  * Sources are now considered more carefully when dealing with
    dependencies with environment markers (#497).
  * EmptyConstraint is now hashable (#513).
  * ParseConstraintError is now raised on version and constraint
    parsing errors, and includes information on the package that
    caused the error (#514).
  ## Fixed
  * Fix an issue where invalid PEP 508 requirements were generated
    due to a missing space before semicolons (#510).
  * Fix an issue where relative paths were encoded into package
    requirements, instead of a file:// URL as required by PEP 508
    (#512).
