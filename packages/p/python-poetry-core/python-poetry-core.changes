Remove python2 subpackage:
python2 requires the typing package as a dependency, but we ship a too recent version of that and thus cannot build it for Leap + Python2 anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 17:01:46 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Let the pyproject_install macro do the compiling

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 10 20:06:27 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- unbundle vendored packages 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 18:49:33 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- remove dephell dependency. poetry-core can build and install
  itself as a PEP517 backend (using pip as frontend)
- precompile the python files as in setuptools
  * gh#openSUSE/python-rpm-macros#37

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  5 13:35:26 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>
