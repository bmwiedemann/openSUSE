%description
The 'Error' package provides two interfaces. Firstly 'Error' provides a
procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly 'Error' is a base
class for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent
catch, or can simply be recorded.

Errors in the class 'Error' should not be thrown directly, but the user
should throw errors from a sub-class of 'Error'.
