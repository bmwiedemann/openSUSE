- Switch from 'plugdev' group to 'disk' group for udev rule
- Update to 24.01.1:
  * introduce (optional) logging of meta-data via MQTT.
    See the README for more details on how to use it.
  * What's Changed
    - Add statistics via mqtt by @BedaKraus in #68
    - README: Update DCO to follow the kernel wording by @SmithChart in #70
- Skipped 24.01:
  * Our tool can now read the SCR, CID and CSD SD card registers from
    the card reader ID, decode their contents and print the result on
    the screen. Give the usbsdmux /dev/sg0 info command a try.
  * Since the register contents are structured information we decided
    to add a JSON-output, so the information can be used by other tools.
  * What's Changed
    - implement 'info' command to show SD card SCR, CID and CSD by @jluebbe in #58
    - Add JSON status output for all commands and errors by @SmithChart in #60
    - Add support for decoding SCR, CID and CSD registers by @jluebbe in #62
    - Add pytest tests and a GitHub Actions workflow for SD register decoding by @jluebbe in #63
    - add test that checks README.rst against usbsdmux -h output by @jluebbe in #65
- Skipped 0.3.0:
  * add support for a new hardware revision of our USB-SD-Mux.
  * The new hardware features two open-drain outputs and is built
    around a new I2C port expander and a faster analog switch for
    the SD-Card.
  * Breaking Changes:
    - If you are using this tool as a Python library: This release
      changes the API. The usbsdmux.UsbSdMux class is now an abstract
      base class and can not be instantiated directly. Use the
      usbsdmux.autoselect_driver() function to obtain an instance of
      the correct type.
  * What's Changed:
    - Cleanups for usb2642i2c by @ukleinek in #42
    - create a basic debian package by @jluebbe in #38
    - flake8 and black: Fix Problems and add Actions for verification by @SmithChart in #47
    - README: fix typo in UDEV rule path by @remes-codasip in #54
    - Drop debian packaging by @ukleinek in #53
    - Add support for the USB-SD-Mux FAST by @SmithChart in #52
    - Increment package version to 0.3.0 by @SmithChart in #56
