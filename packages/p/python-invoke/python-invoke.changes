-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 22:42:07 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Make calling of %{sle15modernpython} optional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 16 17:50:36 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.7.3:
  * Fix a non-fatal bug in our setup.py long_description generation causing
    1.7.0-1.7.2 to have malformed description text on PyPI. 
  * Fix errors thrown when comparing Task objects to non-Task objects; such
    comparisons are now always false.
  * Refactor CLI parser instantiation such that the tasks.ignore_unknown_help
    feature (added in 1.7) works when Invoke is run in --complete mode, i.e. in
    tab-completion scripts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 24 10:56:41 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.7.1:
  * :bug:`659` Improve behavior under ``nohup``, which causes stdin to become an
     undetectably-unreadable (but otherwise legit) file descriptor. Previously
     this led to `OSError` even if you weren't expecting anything on stdin; we now
     trap this specific case and silently ignore it, allowing execution to
     continue. Thanks to ``@kingkisskill`` for initial report and to Ryan Stoner
     for followup and workshopping.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  4 12:35:49 UTC 2022 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.7.0
  * [Feature] #845: Env vars explicitly supplied to sudo (via its env kwarg) are now
    explicitly preserved via sudo’s --preserve-env argument. Patch courtesy of Benno Rice.
  * [Feature] #793: Add a new tasks.ignore_unknown_help config option for users who hand
    their tasks centrally-defined argument help dictionaries; it defaults to False but
     such users may set it to True to avoid exceptions. Thanks to @Allu2 for the report.
  * [Support]: Switch our continuous integration service from Travis-CI to Circle-CI,
    plus related and necessary updates to various administrative config files, management
    tasks and metadata. Including but not limited to:
      * Enhanced PyPI-level metadata/links
      * Split out tool config data from setup.cfg
      * Enhance execution & coverage of unit vs integration tests under CI
  * [Support] #803: Upgrade our vendored PyYAML from 3.11 to 5.4.1; this should both
    supply a number of security fixes, and address problems loading project-level YAML
    config files under Python 3.10. Fix via Andreas Rammhold.
  * [Support]: Switch to using yaml.safe_load for loading config files. This avoids some
    warnings under newer PyYAML versions and is also, in a shocking twist, more secure.

- Update to 1.2.0:

- Switch to multibuild to run tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 28 12:30:16 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.22.1:
  * gh#pyinvoke/invoke#488: Account for additional I/O related
    OSError error strings when attempting to capture only this
    specific subtype of error.
  * gh#pyinvoke/invoke#437: When merging configuration levels
    together (which uses copy.copy by default), pass file objects
    by reference so they don’t get closed.
  * gh#pyinvoke/invoke#342: Accidentally hardcoded Collection
    instead of cls in Collection.from_module (an alternate
    constructor and therefore a classmethod.) This made it rather
    hard to properly subclass Collection.
  * gh#pyinvoke/invoke#469: Fix up the doc/example re: subclassing
    Config.
  * gh#pyinvoke/invoke#433: Add -dev and -nightly style Python
    versions to our Travis builds.
- Changes from version 0.22.0:
  * Iterable-type CLI args were actually still somewhat broken &
    were ‘eating’ values after themselves in the parser stream
    (thus e.g. preventing parsing of subsequent tasks or flags.)
  * gh#pyinvoke/invoke#364: Drop Python 2.6 and Python 3.3
    support, as these versions now account for only very low
    percentages of the userbase and are unsupported (or about to
    be unsupported) by the rest of the ecosystem, including pip.
- Update URL to upstream recommended.

- Update to 0.9.0 2014-08-26
  * [Bug]: Fixed a sub-case of the already-mostly-fixed #149 so the error
    message works usefully even with no explicit collection name given.
  * [Support] #169: Overhaul the Sphinx docs into two trees, one for main
    project info and one for versioned API docs.
  * [Bug] #162: Adjust platform-sensitive imports so Windows users don’t
    encounter import-time exceptions. Thanks to Paul Moore for the patch.
  * [Feature] #136: Added the autoprint flag to invoke.tasks.Task/@task,
    allowing users to set up tasks which act as both subroutines & 
    “print a result” CLI tasks. Thanks to Matthias Lehmann for the original 
    patch.
  * [Bug] #119: (also #162, #113) Better handle platform-sensitive operations
    such as pty size detection or use, either replacing with platform-specific
    implementations or raising useful exceptions. Thanks to Gabi Davar and
    (especially) Paul Moore, for feedback & original versions of the final
    patchset.
  * [Bug] #167: Running the same task multiple times in one CLI session was
    horribly broken; it works now. Thanks to Erich Heine for the report.
  * [Bug] #165: Running inv[oke] with no task names on a collection containing
    a default task should (intuitively) have run that default task, but instead
    did  nothing. This has been fixed.
- Update to 0.8.2 2014-06-15
  * [Bug] #142: The refactored Loader class failed to account for the behavior
    of imp.find_module when run against packages (vs modules) and was exploding
    at load time. This has been fixed. Thanks to David Baumgold for catch & patch.
  * [Bug] #145: Ensure a useful message is displayed (instead of a confusing
    exception) when listing empty task collections.
  * [Bug] #149: Print a useful message to stderr when Invoke can’t find the
    requested collection/tasks file, instead of displaying a traceback.
- Update to 0.8.1 2014-06-09
  * [Bug] #140: Revert incorrect changes to our setup.py regarding detection of
    sub-packages such as the vendor tree & the parser. Also add additional
    scripting to our Travis-CI config to catch this class of error in future.
    Thanks to Steven Loria and James Cox for the reports.
- Update to 0.8.0 2014-06-08
  * [Feature] #125: Improve output of Failure exceptions when printed.
  * [Feature] #124: Add a --debug flag to the core parser to enable easier
    debugging (on top of existing INVOKE_DEBUG env var.)
  * [Bug] #127: Fill in tasks’ exposed name attribute with body name if
    explicit name not given.
  * [Bug] #116: Ensure nested config overrides play nicely with default tasks
    and pre-tasks.
  * [Bug] #131: Make sure one’s local tasks module is always first in sys.path,
    even if its parent directory was already somewhere else in sys.path. This
    ensures that local tasks modules never become hidden by third-party ones.
    Thanks to @crccheck for the early report and to Dorian Puła for assistance
    fixing.
  * [Support]: Refactor the invoke.runner.Runner module to differentiate what
    it means to run a command in the abstract, from execution specifics. Top
    level API is unaffected.
  * [Feature] #87: (also #92) Rework the loader module such that recursive
    filesystem searching is implemented, and is used instead of searching
    sys.path.
    This adds the behavior most users expect or are familiar with from Fabric 1
    or similar tools; and it avoids nasty surprise collisions with other
    installed packages containing files named tasks.py.
    Thanks to Michael Hahn for the original report & PR, and to Matt Iversen
    for providing the discovery algorithm used in the final version of this
    change.
    Warning
    This is technically a backwards incompatible change (reminder: we’re not at
    1.0 yet!). You’ll only notice if you were relying on adding your tasks
    module  to sys.path and then calling Invoke elsewhere on the filesystem.
  * [Support] #117: Tidy up setup.py a bit, including axing the (broken)
    distutils support. Thanks to Matt Iversen for the original PR & followup
    discussion.
  * [Feature] #110: Add task docstrings’ 1st lines to --list output. Thanks to
    Hiroki Kiyohara for the original PR (with assists from Robert Read and
    James Thigpen.)
  * [Feature] #115: Make it easier to reuse Invoke’s primary CLI machinery in
    other (non-Invoke-distributed) bin-scripts. Thanks to Noah Kantrowitz.
  * [Support] #118: Update the bundled six plus other minor tweaks to support
    files. Thanks to Matt Iversen.
  * [Bug] #121: Add missing help output denoting inverse Boolean options (i.e.
    --[no-]foo for a --foo flag whose value defaults to true.) Thanks to Andrew
    Roberts for catch & patch.
  * [Bug] #128: Positional arguments containing underscores were not exporting
    to the parser correctly; this has been fixed. Thanks to J. Javier Maestro
    for catch & patch.
  * [Support] #25: Trim a bunch of time off the test suite by using mocking and
    other tools instead of dogfooding a bunch of subprocess spawns.
  * [Feature] #135: (also bugs #120, #123) Implement post-tasks to match
    pre-tasks, and allow control over the arguments passed to both (via
    invoke.tasks.call). For details, see Pre- and post-tasks.
    Warning
    Pre-tasks were overhauled a moderate amount to implement this feature; they
    now require references to task objects instead of task names. This is a
    backwards incompatible change.
- Update to 0.7.0 2014.01.28
  * [Feature] #107: Update configuration merging behavior for more flexible
    reuse of imported task modules, such as parameterizing multiple copies of a
    module within a task tree.
  * [Feature] #108: Update invoke.collection.Collection.from_module to accept
    useful shorthand arguments for tweaking the invoke.collection.Collection
    objects it creates (e.g. name, configuration.)
  * [Feature] #109: Add a default kwarg to
    invoke.collection.Collection.add_task allowing per-collection control over
    default tasks.
