  <title>Pythonic Task Execution</title>
  <description>Invoke is a Python (2.6+ and 3.2+) task execution tool &amp; library, drawing 
inspiration from various sources to arrive at a powerful &amp; clean feature set.

* Like Ruby's Rake tool and Invoke's own predecessor Fabric 1.x, it provides a
  clean, high level API for running shell commands and defining/organizing
  task functions from a ``tasks.py`` file
  
* From GNU Make, it inherits an emphasis on minimal boilerplate for common
  patterns and the ability to run multiple tasks in a single invocation::

    $ invoke clean build

* Following the lead of most Unix CLI applications, it offers a traditional
  flag-based style of command-line parsing, deriving flag names and value types
  from task signatures (optionally, of course!)::

    $ invoke clean --docs --bytecode build --docs --extra='**/*.pyo'
    $ invoke clean -d -b build --docs -e '**/*.pyo'
    $ invoke clean -db build -de '**/*.pyo'

* Like many of its predecessors, it offers advanced features as well --
  namespacing, task aliasing, before/after hooks, parallel execution and more.
