%description
Azure File Share storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via
the industry standard [Server Message Block (SMB) protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/
desktop/FileIO/microsoft-smb-protocol-and-cifs-protocol-overview). Azure file shares can be mounted
concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally,
Azure file shares can be cached on Windows Servers with Azure File Sync for fast access near
where the data is being used.

Azure file shares can be used to:

 * Replace or supplement on-premises file servers
 * "Lift and shift" applications
 * Simplify cloud development with shared application settings,
   diagnostic share, and Dev/Test/Debug tools
