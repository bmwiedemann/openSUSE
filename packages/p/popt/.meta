  <title>A C library for parsing command line parameters</title>
  <description>Popt is a C library for parsing command line parameters.  Popt was
heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions. It
improves on them by allowing more powerful argument expansion. Popt can
parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays and automatically set variables
based on command line arguments.  Popt allows command line arguments to
be aliased via configuration files and includes utility functions for
parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays using shell-like rules.</description>
