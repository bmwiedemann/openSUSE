- Upgrade to v8.77

	Added *.args and *.fmt convenience files to the %doc section.  These files have apparently been
	in the tarball for a while, but not in the %doc section as they should have been.

	This package has been rapidly seeing small releases.  There have been 12 releases since it was last updated
	for openSUSE12.1 in Sept. 2011.  Afew of the key updates are below.  See the Changes file in doc directory,
	or http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/EXIFTOOL/Image-ExifTool-8.77/Changes

	* Highlights of Changes for Versions 8.66 to 8.77

	    to a GIF image containing XMP metadata

	    API Changes:
		Added Sort2 option and 'Descr' setting for Sort option
		Added secondary sort option to GetFoundTags() and GetTagList()
		Changed name of Sort 'Alpha' setting to 'Tag' (but 'Alpha' still works for backward compatibility) 
        - Enhanced SetNewValue() AddValue option to allow this option to be ignored for non-list tags
        - Added ProtectSaved option to SetNewValue() and return save count from SaveNewValues()
        - Added CharsetEXIF and CharsetQuickTime options

- update to 8.65
  * /usr/bin/exiftool was previously packaged as only an application and the perl(Image::ExifTool) module was not available for use.
  * Thus the standalone exiftool package has now been obsoleted
  * And /usr/bin/exiftool is now included in this package as a sub-package in addition to the perl library modules
  *
  * A significant number of new file formats, etc. are now supported, see
  * http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/EXIFTOOL/Image-ExifTool-8.65/Changes
