- update to 8.65
  * /usr/bin/exiftool was previously packaged as only an application and the perl(Image::ExifTool) module was not available for use.
  * Thus the standalone exiftool package has now been obsoleted
  * And /usr/bin/exiftool is now included in this package as a sub-package in addition to the perl library modules
  *
  * A significant number of new file formats, etc. are now supported, see
  * http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/EXIFTOOL/Image-ExifTool-8.65/Changes
