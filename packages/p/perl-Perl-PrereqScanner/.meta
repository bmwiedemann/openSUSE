<package name="perl-Perl-PrereqScanner" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>a tool to scan your Perl code for its prerequisites</title>
  <description>The scanner will extract loosely your distribution prerequisites from your
files.

The extraction may not be perfect but tries to do its best. It will
currently find the following prereqs:

* *

  plain lines beginning with 'use' or 'require' in your perl modules and
  scripts, including minimum perl version

* *

  regular inheritance declared with the 'base' and 'parent' pragmata

* *

  the Moose manpage inheritance declared with the 'extends' keyword

* *

  the Moose manpage roles included with the 'with' keyword

It will trim the following pragamata: 'strict', 'warnings', and 'lib'.
'base' is trimmed unless a specific version is required. 'parent' is kept,
since it's only recently become a core library.</description>
