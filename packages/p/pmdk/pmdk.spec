%description
The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK), formerly known as NVML
(Non-Volatile Memory Library), is a collection of libraries and tools
built on the DAX (Direct Access) feature of the Linux kernel which
allows applications to access persistent memory as memory-mapped
files, as described in the SNIA NVM Programming Model.

%package -n libpmem1
Summary:        Low-level persistent memory support library
Group:          System/Libraries
Recommends:     %name

%description -n libpmem1
libpmem provides low level persistent memory support, in particular,
support for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes
to pmem.

%package -n libpmem-devel
Summary:        Development files for the low-level persistent memory library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++
Requires:       libpmem1 = %version

%description -n libpmem-devel
libpmem provides low level persistent memory support. In particular,
support for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes
to pmem is provided.

This library is provided for software which tracks every store to
pmem and needs to flush those changes to durability. Most developers
will find higher level libraries like libpmemobj to be much more
convenient.

%package -n libpmemblk1
Summary:        Persistent Memory Resident Block library
Group:          System/Libraries

%description -n libpmemblk1
libpmemblk implements a pmem-resident array of blocks, all the same
size, where a block is updated atomically with respect to power
failure or program interruption (no torn blocks).

%package -n libpmemblk-devel
Summary:        Development files for the Persistent Memory Resident Block library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++
Requires:       libpmemblk1 = %version

%description -n libpmemblk-devel
libpmemblk implements a pmem-resident array of blocks, all the same
size, where a block is updated atomically with respect to power
failure or program interruption (no torn blocks).

For example, a program keeping a cache of fixed-size objects in pmem
might find this library useful. This library is provided for cases
requiring large arrays of objects at least 512 bytes each. Most
developers will find higher level libraries like libpmemobj to be
more generally useful.

%package -n libpmemlog1
Summary:        Persistent Memory Resident Log File library
Group:          System/Libraries

%description -n libpmemlog1
The libpmemlog library provides a pmem-resident log file. This is
useful for programs like databases that append frequently to a log
file.

%package -n libpmemlog-devel
Summary:        Development files for the Persistent Memory Resident Log File library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++
Requires:       libpmemlog1 = %version

%description -n libpmemlog-devel
The libpmemlog library provides a pmem-resident log file. This
library is provided for cases requiring an append-mostly file to
record variable length entries. Most developers will find higher
level libraries like libpmemobj to be more generally useful.

%package -n libpmemobj1
Summary:        Persistent Memory Transactional Object Store library
Group:          System/Libraries

%description -n libpmemobj1
The libpmemobj library provides a transactional object store,
providing memory allocation, transactions, and general facilities for
persistent memory programming.

%package -n libpmemobj-devel
Summary:        Development files for the Persistent Memory Transactional Object Store library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++
Requires:       libpmemobj1 = %version

%description -n libpmemobj-devel
The libpmemobj library provides a transactional object store,
providing memory allocation, transactions, and general facilities for
persistent memory programming. Developers new to persistent memory
probably want to start with this library.

%package -n libpmempool1
Summary:        Persistent Memory pool management library
Group:          System/Libraries

%description -n libpmempool1
The libpmempool library provides a set of utilities for off-line administration,
analysis, diagnostics and repair of persistent memory pools created
by libpmemlog, libpemblk and libpmemobj libraries.

%package -n libpmempool-devel
Summary:        Development files for Persistent Memory pool management library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++
Requires:       libpmempool1 = %version

analysis, diagnostics and repair of persistent memory pools created
by libpmemlog, libpemblk and libpmemobj libraries.

%package -n librpmem1
Summary:        Remote Access to Persistent Memory library
#Manual dependency to make sure libfabric is at least in this version

Requires:       openssh

%description -n librpmem1
The librpmem library provides low-level support for remote access
to persistent memory utilizing RDMA-capable NICs. It can be used
to replicate persistent memory regions over RDMA protocol.

%package -n librpmem-devel
Summary:        Development files for the Remote Access to Persistent Memory library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++
Requires:       librpmem1 = %version

%description -n librpmem-devel
The librpmem library provides low-level support for remote access
to persistent memory utilizing RDMA-capable NICs. It can be used
to replicate persistent memory regions over RDMA protocol.

This sub-package contains libraries and header files for developing
applications that want to specifically make use of librpmem.

%package -n rpmemd
