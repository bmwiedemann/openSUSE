%description
The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK), formerly known as NVML
(Non-Volatile Memory Library), is a collection of libraries and tools
built on the DAX (Direct Access) feature of the Linux kernel which
allows applications to access persistent memory as memory-mapped
files, as described in the SNIA NVM Programming Model.

%package -n libpmem1
Summary:        Low-level persistent memory support library
Group:          System/Libraries
Recommends:     %name

%description -n libpmem1
libpmem provides low level persistent memory support, in particular,
support for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes
to pmem.

%package -n libpmem-devel
Summary:        Development files for the low-level persistent memory library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++
Requires:       libpmem1 = %version

%description -n libpmem-devel
libpmem provides low level persistent memory support. In particular,
support for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes
to pmem is provided.

This library is provided for software which tracks every store to
pmem and needs to flush those changes to durability. Most developers
will find higher level libraries like libpmemobj to be much more
convenient.

Recommends:     %name

%description -n libpmem2-1
libpmem provides low level persistent memory support, in particular,
support for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes
to pmem. libpmem2 has a new API that addresses many of the shortcommings
of libpmem1

%package -n libpmem2-devel

Summary:        Persistent Memory Transactional Object Store library
Group:          System/Libraries

%description -n libpmemobj1
The libpmemobj library provides a transactional object store,
providing memory allocation, transactions, and general facilities for
persistent memory programming.

%package -n libpmemobj-devel
Summary:        Development files for the Persistent Memory Transactional Object Store library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++

%description -n libpmemobj-devel
The libpmemobj library provides a transactional object store,
providing memory allocation, transactions, and general facilities for
persistent memory programming. Developers new to persistent memory
probably want to start with this library.

%package -n libpmempool1
