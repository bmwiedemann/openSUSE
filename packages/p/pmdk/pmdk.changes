- Update to release 2.1
  * New logging subsystem; Messages by default are printed to
    syslog and stderr but might be redirected to a user-defined
    function (cf. pmem(obj)_log_set_function,
    pmem(obj)_log_set_treshold).
  * Introduced fuses against ill-considered use of NDCTL_ENABLE=n.
  * Does not allow create PMEMOBJ pool without unsafe shutdown
    counter (USC).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 12 07:13:15 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.0.1
  * Removes librpmem. Those interested in remote persistent memory
    support should use the rpma library.
  * Removes libpmemset - it was an experimental library.
  * Removes libpmemlog, libpmemblk, btt, and their support in
    (lib)pmempool
  * Removes all pmem2_async operations (experimental)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  8 14:42:34 UTC 2021 - Christian Vögl <christian.voegl@suse.com>

- Update to PMDK 1.11.0
  * Version 1.11.0
    - Adds new APIs for libpmem2, most notably there are new functions
      to shrink and extend an existing reservation and a new iterator API
      for mappings contained within an existing reservation. There's also
      a new function to retrieve a numa node for a source.
    - Makes the pmemobj_open() and pmemobj_close() functions from libpmemobj
      thread-safe. It's now easier to correctly manage persistent memory
      pools in a parallel environment.
    - Introduces a new API in libpmemobj to globally change the method of
      assigning arenas to threads. The default is to rely on a OS per-thread
      key to store arena information. This release introduces an option
      to avoid the use of thread-local keys by simply using one global
      arena for all threads in a pool.
    - pmem2: don't force smaller alignment for fsdax mappings
    - rpmem: various fixes for powerpc64le
    - doc: fix documentation of pmem_is_pmem()
    - common: fix various minor problems found by static analysis
    - pmem2: arm64: fix possible data loss on ARMv8.2+ (improper flushing)
    This release introduces no changes to the on-media layout and is
    fully compatible with the previous version of PMDK. 

  * Version 1.10
    - This release introduces a new stable PMDK library, libpmem2, which
      is the next major release of libpmem.
      This library has an entirely new, but familiar, API that addresses many
      shortcomings of the previous version, while retaining all of its
      functionality. To learn more, see https://pmem.io/pmdk/libpmem2/ or
      libpmem2(7).
      The old library, libpmem, is still going to be maintained for the
      foreseeable future, but we'd like to encourage any new applications to
      leverage libpmem2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  8 10:06:57 UTC 2021 - Christian Vögl <christian.voegl@suse.com>

- Update to PMDK 1.9.2

- Update to PMDK 1.9
  - Switches the default instruction set for memcpy, memmove and memset
    implementations on x86 to AVX512, and introduces numerous performance
    improvements for those operations on AVX and SSE2 fallback paths.
  - Optimizes transactional allocations in libpmemobj by avoiding one
    extraneous cache miss and reducing the amount of work required to perform
    a reservation.
  - Introduces a new API in libpmemobj, pmemobj_tx_set_failure_behavior,
    that enables the application to control the behavior of aborting
    transactions.
  - Stabilizes support for ppc64.
  - pmem: mem[cpy|set] optimization when eADR is available
  - obj: detect msync failures in non-pmem variants of mem[cpy|move|set]

- Update to PMDK 1.8
  - Introduces new API in libpmemobj for user-assisted defragmentation
    (see pmemobj_defrag man page for details).
  - Introduces experimental support for PPC64LE architecture.
  - Introduces new flag in libpmemobj for opting-out of transaction aborts on failure
    (POBJ_TX_NO_ABORT), along with new variants of existing APIs that didn't accept
    flags (pmemobj_tx_xfree, pmemobj_tx_xpublish,
  - pmemobj_tx_xlock, pmemobj_tx_xlog_append_buffer, pmemobj_tx_xstrdup, pmemobj_tx_xwcsdup).
  - Moves out libvmem and libvmmalloc to the new repository (https://github.com/pmem/vmem).
  - obj: introduce new statistics useful for defrag
  - obj: introduce transient/persistent statistics enabling
  - obj: introduce pmemobj_tx_(set/get)_user_data funcs
  - obj: introduce pmemobj_(set/get)_user_data funcs
  - obj: disable workaround for offsetof() since VS 15.5 in public header
  - common: drop support for libndctl < 63 on Linux
  - pool: rename -N --no-exec to -d --dry-run
- Add gen-doc.sh to pregenerate documentation in pregen-doc.tgz and avoid adding a
  build dependency to pandoc


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 11 14:19:47 UTC 2019 - Nicolas Morey-Chaisemartin <nmoreychaisemartin@suse.com>

- Update to PMDK 1.7 (jsc#SLE-9886)
  - Introduces new APIs in libpmemobj for managing space used by transactions.
    (see pmemobj_tx_log_append_buffer man page for details)
  - Introduces new APIs in librpmem, splitting rpmem_persist into rpmem_flush
    and rpmem_drain, allowing applications to use the flush + drain model
    already known from libpmem. (libpmemobj does not use this feature yet)
  - Optimizes large libpmemobj transactions by significantly reducing
    the amount of memory modified at the commit phase.
  - Optimizes tracking of libpmemobj reservations.
  - Adds new flags for libpmemobj's pmemobj_tx_xadd_range[_direct] API:
    POBJ_XADD_NO_SNAPSHOT and POBJ_XADD_ASSUME_INITIALIZED, allowing
    applications to optimize how memory is tracked by the library.
- To support some of the above changes the libpmemobj on-media layout had
  to be changed, which means that old pools have to be converted using
  pmdk-convert >= 1.7.

  requests identified by the issue numbers listed next to the items below.

  Other important changes are related to performance tuning and
  stabilization of librpmem library, which is used by libpmemobj to get
  remote access to persistent memory and to provide basic data replication
  over RDMA.  The librpmem is still considered experimental.

Thu Mar 16 08:32:02 UTC 2017 - jthumshirn@suse.com

- Update to upstream version 1.2.1 (FATE#321727)
  This NVML release changes the behavior of pmem_is_pmem() on Linux.
  The pmem_is_pmem() function will now return true only if the entire
  range is mapped directly from Device DAX (/dev/daxX.Y) without an
  intervening file system, and only if the corresponding file mapping
  was created with pmem_map_file().  See libpmem(3) for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  9 09:01:10 UTC 2017 - jthumshirn@suse.com

- Update to upstream version 1.2 (FATE#321727)
+ build-fix.patch
- 0001-libpmemblk-cast-translation-entry-to-uint64_t-when-calculating-data-offset.patch
* Add Device DAX support, providing that "optimized flush" mechanism
  defined in SNIA NVM Programming Model can safely be used, even
  if PMEM-aware file system supporting that model is not available,
  or if the user does not want to use the file system for some reason.
* Add a package for libpmemobj C++ bindings.
  C++ API is no longer considered experimental.
  Web-based documentation for C++ API is available on http://pmem.io.
* Add "sync" and "transform" commands to pmempool utility.
  The "sync" command allows to recover missing or corrupted part(s)
  of a pool set from a healthy replica, while the "transform" command
  is a convenient way for modifying the structure of an existing
  pool set, i.e. by adding or removing replicas.
* Add experimental support for remote access to persistent memory and
  basic remote data replication over RDMA (librpmem).  Experimental
  support for remote replicas is also provided by libpmemobj library.
  Note: This is one not packaged for SUSE yet.

  library must be converted to the new format using "pmempool
  convert" command. See pmempool-convert(1) for details.
* A new "libpmempool" library is available, providing support for
  off-line pool management and diagnostics. Initially, it
  provides only "check" and "repair" operations for log and blk
  memory pools, and for BTT devices.
* pmem: deprecate PCOMMIT
* blk: match BTT Flog initialization with Linux NVDIMM BTT
* pmem: defer pmem_is_pmem() initialization
* cpp: clarify polymorphism in persistent_ptr

- Add libpmempool subpackage
- Add new BuildRequires: pkg-config, glibc-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  7 13:38:57 UTC 2016 - jthumshirn@suse.com

- Version 1.0
    The API of six libraries (libpmem, libpmemblk, libpmemlog,
    libpmemobj, libvmem, libvmmalloc) is complete and stable.
    The on-media layout of persistent memory pools will be maintained
    from this point, and if changed it will be backward compatible.
    Man pages are all complete.
    This release has been validated to "Production quality".

    For the purpose of new features planned for next releases of NVML
    there have been some API modifications made:
            - pmem: pmem_map replaced with pmem_map_file
            - log/blk: 'off_t' substituted with 'long long'
            - obj: type numbers extended to 64-bit
            - obj: new entry points and macros added:
              pmemobj_tx_errno, pmemobj_tx_lock, pmemobj_mutex_timedlock,
              TX_ADD_DIRECT, TX_ADD_FIELD_DIRECT, TX_SET_DIRECT

    Other key changes since version 0.4 include:
            - common: updated/fixed installation scripts
            - common: eliminated dependency on libuuid
            - pmem: CPU features/ISA detection using CPUID
            - obj: improved error handling
            - obj: atomic allocation fails if constructor returns error
            - obj: multiple performance optimizations
            - obj: object store refactoring
            - obj: additional examples and benchmarks

    This release also introduces a prototype implementation
    of C++ bindings for libpmemobj.  Note that C++ API is still
    experimental and should not be used in production environments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 22 09:16:47 UTC 2016 - jthumshirn@suse.com

- Update to upstream version 0.4
  This NVML version primarily focuses on improving code quality
  and reliability.  In addition to a couple of bug fixes,
  the changes include:
          - benchmarks for libpmemobj, libpmemblk and libvmem
          - additional pmemobj tests and examples
          - pool mapping address randomization
          - added pmempool "rm" command
          - eliminated libpmem dependency on libpthread
          - enabled extra warnings
          - minor performance improvements
  Man pages are all complete.
  This release is considered "Beta quality" by the team, having
  been thoroughly validated, including significant performance analysis.
  The pmempool command does not yet support "check" and "repair"
  operations for pmemobj type pools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 19 09:51:06 UTC 2015 - jthumshirn@suse.com
