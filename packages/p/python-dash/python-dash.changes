Mon Jul 11 02:46:42 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 2.5.1:
  * Fixed
    + #2087 Fix bug #2086 in which using id as a key within a
      component's id breaks the new callback context's args_grouping
      function.
    + #2084 In dash 2.5.0, a default viewport meta tag was added as
      recommended for mobile-optimized sites by mdn This feature can
      be disabled by providing an empty viewport meta tag. e.g. app =
      Dash(meta_tags=[{"name": "viewport"}])
    + #2090, #2092. Fixed bug where the path to the pages_folder was
      incorrect on Windows.
  * Removed
    + #2087 Removed the undocumented callback context
      args_grouping_values property which was incompatible with
      pattern-matching callbacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  7 19:53:02 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.5.0
  * #1947 Added pages - a better way to build multi-page apps. For
    more information see the forum post.
  * #1965 Add component as props.
  * #2049 Added wait_for_class_to_equal and wait_for_contains_class
    methods to dash.testing
  * #2050 Changed find_element and find_elements to accept an
    attribute argument that aligns with Selenium's By class,
    allowing you to search elements by other attributes. Default
    value is CSS_SELECTOR to maintain backwards compatibility with
    previous find_elements.
  * #2043 Fix bug #2003 in which dangerously_allow_html=True +
    mathjax=True works in some cases, and in some cases not.
  * #2065 Fix bug #2064 rendering of dcc.Dropdown with a value but
    no options.
  * #2047 Fix bug #1979 in which DASH_DEBUG as environment variable
    gets ignored.
  * #2070 Fix bug #2066 nested types triggering maximum call stack
    error when building typescript components.
- Release 2.4.1
  * Fix #2045 import error when using pytest but dash[testing] is
    not installed.
- Release 2.4.0
  * #1952 Improved callback_context
    - Closes #1818 Closes #1054
    - adds dash.ctx, a more concise name for dash.callback_context
    - adds ctx.triggered_prop_ids, a dictionary of the component
      ids and props that triggered the callback.
    - adds ctx.triggered_id, the id of the component that triggered
      the callback.
    - adds ctx.args_grouping, a dict of the inputs used with
      flexible callback signatures.
  * #2009 Add support for Promises within Client-side callbacks as
    requested in #1364.
  * #1956 Add TypeScript components generation.
  * #2034 Add link_target prop to dcc.Markdown component. Closes
    #1827
  * #2035 Add type annotations to testing fixtures.
  * #2029 Restrict the number of props listed explicitly in
    generated component constructors - default is 250. This
    prevents exceeding the Python 3.6 limit of 255 arguments. The
    omitted props are still in the docstring and can still be
    provided the same as before, they just won't appear in the
    signature so autocompletion may be affected.
  * #1968 Fix bug #1877, code which uses merge_duplicate_headers
    and style_header_conditional to highlight columns, it
    incorrectly highlights header cells.
  * #2015 Fix bug #1854 in which the combination of
    row_selectable="single or multi" and filter_action="native"
    caused the JS error.
  * #1976 Fix #1962 in which DatePickerSingle and DatePickerRange
    are extremely slow when provided a long list of disabled_days.
  * #2035 Fix #2033 In-App error reporting does not render HTML.
  * #1970 dcc.Dropdown Refactor fixes:
   - Fix bug #1868 value does not update when selected option
     removed from options.
   - Fix bug #1908 Selected options not showing when the value
     contains a comma.
  * #1751 Rename app.run_server to app.run while preserving
    app.run_server for backwards compatibility.
  * #1839 The callback decorator returns the original function, not
    the wrapped function, so that you can still call these
    functions directly, for example in tests. Note that in this
    case there will be no callback context so not all callbacks can
    be tested this way.
  * #2016 Drop the 375px width from default percy_snapshot calls,
    keep only 1280px
  * #2027 Improve the error message when a user doesn't wrap
    children in a list
  * #2016, #2032, and #2042 Widespread dependency upgrades
    - Upgrade Plotly.js to v2.12.1 (from v2.11.0).
      + Feature release 2.12.0 adds minor ticks and gridlines, as
        well as dashed gridlines.
      + Patch release 2.11.1 fixes regl-based traces in strict CSP
        mode, however you must manually switch to the strict bundle
        to use this.
      + Patch release 2.12.1 fixes several bugs.
    - Upgrade black to v22.3.0 for Python 3.7+ - if you use
      dash[ci] and you call black, this may alter your code
      formatting slightly, including more consistently breaking
      Python 2 compatibility.
    - Many other mainly JS dependency upgrades to the internals of
      Dash renderer and components. These may patch bugs or improve
      performance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 29 20:56:04 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.3.1
  * #1963 Fix #1780 flask shutdown deprecation warning when running
    dashduo threaded tests.
  * #1995 Fix #1992 ImportError: cannot import name
    'get_current_traceback' from 'werkzeug.debug.tbtools'.
- Release 2.3.0
  * #1949 Add built-in MathJax support to both dcc.Markdown and
    dcc.Graph. A new boolean prop mathjax was added to these two
    components, defaulting to False. Set mathjax=True to enable
    math rendering. This work uses MathJax v3, although dcc.Graph
    and Plotly.js can also be used with MathJax v2.
    - In dcc.Markdown this has two flavors: inline math is any
      content between single dollar signs, for example "$E=mc^2$",
      and "display" math (on its own line, potentially multi-line)
      is delimited by double dollar signs.
    - In dcc.Graph, most text fields (graph and axis titles, trace
      names, scatter and bar text) can use math, and it's enabled
      with single dollar sign delimiters. A limitation here is that
      currently a given piece of text can only be one or the other:
      if math is found, everything outside the delimiters is
      ignored. See https://plotly.com/python/LaTeX/ for details.
    - For an intro to LaTeX math, see
      https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics.
    - Big thanks to Equinor for sponsoring this development,
      including the related work in Plotly.js!
  * #1949 Upgrade Plotly.js to v2.11.0 (from v2.9.0)
    - Support for MathJax v3
    - fillpattern for scatter traces with filled area
    - Every trace type can now be rendered in a stricter CSP
      environment, specifically avoiding unsafe-eval. Please note:
      the regl-based traces (scattergl, scatterpolargl, parcoords,
      and splom) are only strict in the strict bundle, which is NOT
      served by default in Dash. To use this bundle with Dash, you
      must either download it and put it in your assets/ folder, or
      include it as an external_script from the CDN:
      https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-strict-2.11.0.min.js. All other
      trace types are strict in the normal bundle.
    - Patch release 2.10.1 containing a bugfix for mesh3d traces.
  * #1915 Fix bug #1474 when both dcc.Graph and go.Figure have
    animation, and when the second animation in Figure is executed,
    the Frames from the first animation are played instead of the
    second one.
  * #1953 Fix bug #1783 in which a failed hot reloader blocks the
    UI with alerts.
  * #1942 Fix bug #1663 preventing pie traces from sending
    customdata with clickData and other events.

Wed Mar  2 21:52:56 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 2.2.0:
  Changelog would be too long, see
  https://github.com/plotly/dash/releases for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  9 21:34:20 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.20.0
  Changed
  * #1531 Update the format of the docstrings to make them easier
    to read in the reference pages of Dash Docs and in the
    console. This also addresses #1205
  * #1553 Increase the z-index of the Dash error menu from 1001 to
    1100 in order to make sure it appears above Bootstrap
    components.
  Fixed
  * #1546 Validate callback request outputs vs output to avoid a
    perceived security issue.
- Release 1.19.0
  Added
  * #1508 Fix #1403: Adds an x button to close the error messages
    box.
  * #1525 Adds support for callbacks which have overlapping inputs
    and outputs. Combined with dash.callback_context this
    addresses many use cases which require circular callbacks.
  Changed
  * #1503 Fix #1466: loosen dash[testing] requirements for easier
    integration in external projects. This PR also bumps many dash
    [dev] requirements.
  Fixed
  * #1530 Dedent error messages more carefully.
  * #1527￼ get_asset_url now pulls from an external source if
    assets_external_path is set.
    - updated _add_assets_resource to build asset urls the same
      way as get_asset_url.
    - updated doc string for assets_external_path Dash argument to
      be more clear that it will allways be joined with the
      assets_url_path argument when determining the url to an
      external asset.
  * #1493 Fix #1143, a bug where having a file with one of several
    common names (test.py, code.py, org.py, etc) that imports a
    dash component package would make import dash fail with a
    cryptic error message asking whether you have a file named
    "dash.py"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  3 18:48:57 UTC 2021 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Prepare Andy's work for submission
  * update specfile with requirements and comment about tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 21 11:31:03 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to 1.18.1.
  * Bump plotly.js v1.58.2
  * Updates for 1.18.0
    * Fix a bug where the table is using classes that are styled by
      Bootstrap
    * Upgraded Plotly.js to 1.58.1
  * Updates for 1.17.0
    * Update from React 16.13.0 to 16.14.0
    * Fix #1432 for Julia to import non-core component packages
      without possible errors.
    * Provide a hint in the callback error when the user forgot to
      make app.callback(...) a decorator.
  * Updates for 1.16.3
    * Fix a regression caused by flask-compress==1.6.0 causing
      performance degradation on server requests
  * Updates for 1.16.2
    * Fix a regression with some layouts callbacks involving
      dcc.Tabs, not yet loaded dash_table.DataTable and dcc.Graph
      to not be called
    * Make callback graph more robust for complex apps and some
      specific props (width in particular) that previously caused
      errors.
  * Updates for 1.16.1
    * Extends the getTransform logic in the renderer to handle
      persistenceTransforms for both nested and non-nested
      persisted props. This was used to to fix dcc#700 in
      conjunction with dcc#854 by using persistenceTransforms to
      strip the time part of the datetime so
      that datepickers can persist when defined in callbacks.
      Fixes a bug where the callback graph layout would reset
      whenever a callback fired, losing user-initiated layout
      changes (#1402) or creating a new force layout (#1401)
  * Updates for 1.16.0
    * You can now get CSP script-src hashes of all added inline
      scripts by calling app.csp_hashes() (both Dash internal
      inline scripts, and those added with
      app.clientside_callback).
    * Closes #1350 and fixes a previously undefined callback
      behavior when multiple elements are stacked on top of one
      another and their n_clicks props are used as inputs of the
      same callback. The callback will now trigger once with all
      the triggered n_clicks props changes.
    * New and improved callback graph in the debug menu. Now based
      on Cytoscape for much more interactivity, plus callback
      profiling including number of calls, fine-grained time
      information, bytes sent and received, and more. You can even
      add custom timing information on the server with
      callback_context.record_timing(name, seconds)
    * Fixed a bug introduced by #1180 breaking use of
      prevent_initial_call as a positional arg in callback
      definitions[1.15.0] - 2020-08-25
    * Removed redundant log message and consolidated logger
      initialization. You can now control the log level - for
      example suppress informational messages from Dash with
      app.logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING).
    * #1253, #1377 Added experimental --jl-prefix option to
      dash-generate-components, optionally generates Julia version
      of components and corresponding Julia package
    * Input, Output, and State in callback definitions don’t need
      to be in lists. You still need to provide Output items first,
      then Input items, then State, and the list form is still
      supported. In particular, if you want to return a single
      output item wrapped in a length-1 list, you should still wrap
      the Output in a list. This can be useful for
      procedurally-generated callbacks.
    * Updated pytest to v6.0.1. To avoid deprecation warnings, this
      also updated pytest-sugar to 0.9.4 and pytest-mock to 3.2.0.
      The pytest mock update only effects python >= 3.0.
      Pytest-mock remains pinned at 2.0.0 for python == 2.7.
  * Updates for 1.14.0
    * Add title parameter to set the document title. This is the
      recommended alternative to setting app.title or overriding
      the index HTML.
    * Add update_title parameter to set or disable the
      “Updating....” document title during updates. Closes #856 and
      #732
  * Updates for 1.13.4
    * Fix a regression since 1.13.0 preventing more than one
      loading state from being shown at a time.
  * Updates for 1.13.3
  * Updates for 1.13.2
    * Fix regression that causes crash when FLASK_ENV is modified
      during app execution
    * Fix regression that caused tests using _wait_for_callbacks
      to fail
  * Updates for 1.13.0
    * Supports DASH_PROXY env var to tell app.run_server to report
      the correct URL to view your app, when it’s being proxied.
      Throws an error if the proxy is incompatible with the host
      and port you’ve given the server.
    * Adds callback_context to clientside callbacks (e.g.
      dash_clientside.callback_context.triggered).
      Supports triggered, inputs, inputs_list, states, and
      states_list, all of which closely resemble their serverside
      cousins.
    * Closes #920: Converts hot reload fetch failures into a server
      status indicator showing whether the latest fetch succeeded
      or failed.
    * Callback fetch failures still appear as errors but have a
      clearer message.
    * Modifies the callback chain implementation and improves
      performance for apps with a lot of components
    * Hard hot reload targets only the current window, not the top
      - so if your app is in an iframe you will only reload the app
    * Fixes #919 so dash.testing is compatible with more pytest
      plugins, particularly pytest-flake8 and pytest-black.
    * Fixes #1245, so you can use prop persistence with components
      that have dict IDs, ie for pattern-matching callbacks.
    * Sort asset directories, same as we sort files inside those
      directories. This way if you need your assets loaded in a
      certain order, you can add prefixes to subdirectory names and
      enforce that order.#1288 Closes #1285: Debug=True should work
      in the main module.
  * Updates for 1.12.0
    * Adds control over firing callbacks on page (or layout chunk)
      load. Individual callbacks can have their initial calls
      disabled in their definition
      @app.callback(..., prevent_initial_call=True) and similar
      for app.clientside_callback. The app-wide default can also be
      changed with app=Dash(prevent_initial_callbacks=True), then
      individual callbacks may disable this behavior.
    * New attribute app.validation_layout allows you to create a
      multi-page app without suppress_callback_exceptions=True
      or layout function tricks. Set this to a component layout
      containing the superset of all IDs on all pages in your app.
    * Permit usage of arbitrary file extensions for assets within
      component libraries
    * Fixes #1223, a very specific situation in which initial
      callbacks will not fire.
    * Fixes #1216, a set of related issues about pattern-matching
      callbacks with ALL wildcards in their Output which would fail
      if no components matched the pattern.
    * Fixes #1200 - prior to Dash 1.11, if none of the inputs to a
      callback were on the page, it was not an error. This was, and
      is now again,treated as though the callback raised
      PreventUpdate. The one exception to this is with
      pattern-matching callbacks, when every Input uses a
      multi-value wildcard (ALL or ALLSMALLER), and every Output is
      on the page. In that case the callback fires as usual.
    * Fixes #1193 - prior to Dash 1.11, you could use
      flask.has_request_context() == False inside an app.layout
      function to provide a special layout containing all IDs for
      validation purposes in a multi-page app. Dash 1.11 broke this
      when we moved most of this validation into the renderer. This
      change makes it work again.

Sat Apr 18 20:31:40 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * updated required versions

- update to version 1.11.0:
  * Added
    + #1103 Pattern-matching IDs and callbacks. Component IDs can be
       dictionaries, and callbacks can reference patterns of
       components, using three different wildcards: ALL, MATCH, and
       ALLSMALLER, available from dash.dependencies. This lets you
       create components on demand, and have callbacks respond to any
       and all of them. To help with this, dash.callback_context gets
       three new entries: outputs_list, inputs_list, and states_list,
       which contain all the ids, properties, and except for the
       outputs, the property values from all matched components.
    + #1103 dash.testing option --pause: after opening the dash app in
       a test, will invoke pdb for live debugging of both Javascript
       and Python. Use with a single test case like pytest -k cbwc001
       --pause.
  * Changed
  * #1103 Multiple changes to the callback pipeline:
    + dash.callback_context.triggered now does NOT reflect any initial
      values, and DOES reflect EVERY value which has been changed
      either by activity in the app or as a result of a previous
      callback. That means that the initial call of a callback with no
      prerequisite callbacks will list nothing as triggering. For
      backward compatibility, we continue to provide a length-1 list
      for triggered, but its id and property are blank strings, and
      bool(triggered) is False.
    + A user interaction which returns the same property value as was
      previously present will not trigger the component to re-render,
      nor trigger callbacks using that property as an input.
    + Callback validation is now mostly done in the browser, rather
      than in Python. A few things - mostly type validation, like
      ensuring IDs are strings or dicts and properties are strings -
      are still done in Python, but most others, like ensuring outputs
      are unique, inputs and outputs don't overlap, and (if desired)
      that IDs are present in the layout, are done in the
      browser. This means you can define callbacks BEFORE the layout
      and still validate IDs to the layout; and while developing an
      app, most errors in callback definitions will not halt the app.
  * Fixed
    + #1103 Fixed multiple bugs with chained callbacks either not
       triggering, inconsistently triggering, or triggering multiple
       times. This includes: #635, #832, #1053, #1071, and #1084. Also
       fixed #1105: async components that aren't rendered by the page
       (for example in a background Tab) would block the app from
       executing callbacks.

Fri Dec  6 18:44:56 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Disable python2 support since dependencies dropped python2
- Update to version 1.7.0
  + Added
    * Add support for defining clientside JavaScript callbacks via inline strings.
    * Allow `visit_and_snapshot` API in `dash.testing.browser`  to stay on the page so you can run other checks.
  + Changed
    * Better error message when you forget to wrap multiple `children` in an array, and they get passed to other props.
  + Fixed
    * Fix the `dash.testing` **stop** API with process application runner in Python2. Use `kill()` instead of `communicate()` to avoid hanging.
    * Fix bug with renderer callback lock never resolving with non-rendered async component using the asyncDecorator
- Update to version 1.6.1
  + Fixed
    * Fix IE11 / ES5 compatibility and validation issues
    * Fix bug with renderer wrapper component TreeContainer to prevent useless re-renders
      > Fix and improve the `clear_input()` API in `dash.testing`, so it's more robust handling react `input`.
      > make the `percy_snapshot()` API more robust, and the timeout of `wait_for_callbacks` (if set to True) will not fail the snapshot execution, but logged as potential error.
- Update to version 1.6.0
  + Fixed
    * Fix fingerprint for component suites with `metadata` in version.
    * Fix the assets loading issues when dashR application runner is handling with an app defined by string chunk.
- Update to version 1.5.1
  + Fixed
    * Fix cache string handling for component suites with nested folders in their packages.
    * Fix a bug with evaluation of `_force_eager_loading` when application is loaded with gunicorn
- Update to version 1.5.0
  + Added
    * Adds support for preventing updates in clientside functions.
      > Reject all updates with `throw window.dash_clientside.PreventUpdate;`
      > Reject a single output by returning `window.dash_clientside.no_update`
    * Add support for async dependencies and components
    * Adds support for resource caching and adds a fallback caching mechanism through etag
  + Fixed
    * Fix and improve a percy snapshot behavior issue we found in dash-docs testing. It adds a flag `wait_for_callbacks` to ensure that, in the context of a dash app testing, the percy snapshot action will happen only after all callbacks get fired.
- Update to version 1.4.1
  + Fixed
    * Fix warnings emitted by react devtools coming from our own devtools components.
- Update to version 1.4.0
  + Added
    * Support setting working directory for R apps run using the `dashr` fixture, primarily useful for tests with assets. `dashr.start_server` supports a `cwd` argument to set an explicit working directory, and has smarter defaults when it's omitted: if `app` is a path to an R script, uses the directory of that path; if `app` is a string, uses the directory the test file itself is in.
      > Relevant `dash.testing` methods can now be called with either an element or a CSS selector: `select_dcc_dropdown`, `multiple_click`, `clear_input`, `zoom_in_graph_by_ratio`, `click_at_coord_fractions`.
      > Three new `dash.testing` methods: `clear_local_storage`, `clear_session_storage`, and `clear_storage` (to clear both together)
    * `dash.testing` adds two APIs `zoom_in_graph_by_ratio` and `click_at_coord_fractions` about advanced interactions using mouse `ActionChain`
    * Add debugging traces to dash backend about serving component suites, to verify the installed packages whenever in doubt.
  + Fixed
    * Fix a bug with persistence being toggled on/off on an existing component.
- Update to version 1.3.1
  + Changed
    * Bump dash-core-components version from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1
- Update to version 1.3.0
  + Added
    * Add one configuration `--percy-assets` in `pytest` to specify extra application assets path if needed.
    * Add `wait_for_element_by_id` and `visit_and_snapshot` APIs in browser, add `raw_command` option (with higher priority than the default waitress one) and optional `start_timeout` argument to handle large applications within the process runner.
    * Persistence: enable props edited by the user to persist across recreating the component or reloading the page. Components need to define three new props: `persistence`, `persisted_props`, and `persistence_type` as described in the lead comment of `src/persistence.js`. App developers then enable this behavior by, in the simplest case, setting `persistence: true` on the component. First use case is table
  + Changed
    * Bump dash-table version from 4.2.0 to 4.3.0
    * Bump dash-core-components version from 1.1.2 to 1.2.0

  + Fixed
    * Fix `dash-generate-components` on Windows.
    * Fix the `--remote` pytest argument which was not effective in the code, adding a new argument `--remote-url` to support the selenium grid usage in the cloud.
    * Reduce the dash-renderer packages size on **PyPI** about 55% by removing the source maps. To do more advanced debugging, the source maps needs to be generated from source code with `npm run build:local` and pip install in editable mode, i.e. `pip install -e .`
- Update to version 1.2.0
  + Added
    * Add a new arg `dev_tools_prune_errors` to `app.run_server` and `app.enable_dev_tools`. Default `True`, tracebacks only include user code and below. Set it `False` for the previous behavior showing all the Dash and Flask parts of the stack.
  + Changed
    * Bump dash-table version from 4.1.0 to 4.2.0
    * Bump dash-core-components version from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2
    * Bump dash-html-components version from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
    * Bump dash-renderer version from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1

  + Changed
    * Bump dash-table version from 4.0.2 to 4.1.0
    * Bump dash-core-components version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- Update to version 1.0.2
  + Changed
    * Bump dash-table version from 4.0.1 to 4.0.2
  + Fixed
    * Fix a bug with callback error reporting
- Update to version 1.0.1
  + Changed
    * Remove strong `dash.testing` dependencies per community feedback. Testing users should do `pip install dash[testing]` afterwards.
    * Add headless mode for dash.testing, add `pytest_setup_options` hook for full configuration of `WebDriver Options`.
    * Bump dash-table version from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1
- Update to version 1.0.0
  + Changed
    * Several breaking changes to the `dash.Dash` API:
      > Remove two obsolete constructor kwargs: `static_folder` and `components_cache_max_age`
      > Remove the misspelled `supress_callback_exceptions` fallback
      > Remove the unused `resources.config.infer_from_layout`
      > Revamp `app.config`: ALL constructor args are now stored in `config`, with three exceptions: `server`, `index_string`, and `plugins`. None of these are stored in any other instance attributes anymore.
      > Change `hot_reload_interval` from msec to seconds, for consistency with `hot_reload_watch_interval`
      > When called from `enable_dev_tools`, `debug=True` by default. It's still `False` by default from `run_server`.
    * Introducing Dash Testing (`dash.testing`) - read the full tutorial at http://dash.plot.ly/testing.
    * `Component` no longer inherits `MutableMapping`, so `values`, `keys`, and more are no longer methods. Fixes an issue where components with certain prop names defined but not provided would cause a failure to render. During component generation we now disallow all props with leading underscores or matching a few remaining reserved words: `UNDEFINED`, `REQUIRED`, `to_plotly_json`, `available_properties`, and `available_wildcard_properties`.
    * Allow the Flask app to be provided to Dash after object initialization. This allows users to define Dash layouts etc when using the app factory pattern, or any other pattern that inhibits access to the app object. This broadly complies with the flask extension API, allowing Dash to be considered as a Flask extension where it needs to be.
    * Allow the Flask app to set the Dash app name if the name is not provided by users.
    * Assets are served locally by default. Both JS scripts and CSS files are affected. This improves robustness and flexibility in numerous situations, but in certain cases initial loading could be slowed. To restore the previous CDN serving, set `app.scripts.config.serve_locally = False` (and similarly with `app.css`, but this is generally less important).
    * Undo/redo toolbar is removed by default, you can enable it with `app=Dash(show_undo_redo=true)`. The CSS hack `._dash-undo-redo:{display:none;}` is no longer needed
    * Merge the `dash-renderer` project into the main dash repo to simplify feature dev workflow. We will keep the deprecated one for archive purpose.

- Update to version 0.35.3
  + Changed
      > `assets_folder` argument now defaults to 'assets'

- Update to version 0.24.1
  + Fixed
    * Fix bug where importing Dash components with no props would result in an error.
