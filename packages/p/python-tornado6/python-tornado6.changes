- Rename to python-tornado6 to handle version incompatibilities
- Update to 6.0.3
  + Bug fixes
    * `.gen.with_timeout` always treats ``asyncio.CancelledError`` as a
      ``quiet_exception`` (this improves compatibility with Python 3.8,
      which changed ``CancelledError`` to a ``BaseException``).
    * ``IOStream`` now checks for closed streams earlier, avoiding
      spurious logged errors in some situations (mainly with websockets).
- Update to 6.0.2
  + Bug fixes
    * `.WebSocketHandler.set_nodelay` works again.
    * Accessing ``HTTPResponse.body`` now returns an empty byte string
      instead of raising ``ValueError`` for error responses that don't
      have a body (it returned None in this case in Tornado 5).
- Update to 6.0.1
  + Bug fixes
    * Fixed issues with type annotations that caused errors while
      importing Tornado on Python 3.5.2.
- Update to 6.0.0
  + Backwards-incompatible changes
    * Python 2.7 and 3.4 are no longer supported; the minimum supported
      Python version is 3.5.2.
    * APIs deprecated in Tornado 5.1 have been removed. This includes the
      ``tornado.stack_context`` module and most ``callback`` arguments
      throughout the package. All removed APIs emitted
      `DeprecationWarning` when used in Tornado 5.1, so running your
      application with the ``-Wd`` Python command-line flag or the
      environment variable ``PYTHONWARNINGS=d`` should tell you whether
      your application is ready to move to Tornado 6.0.
    * ``.WebSocketHandler.get`` is now a coroutine and must be called
      accordingly in any subclasses that override this method (but note
      that overriding ``get`` is not recommended; either ``prepare`` or
      ``open`` should be used instead).
  + General changes
    * Tornado now includes type annotations compatible with ``mypy``.
      These annotations will be used when type-checking your application
      with ``mypy``, and may be usable in editors and other tools.
    * Tornado now uses native coroutines internally, improving performance.
  + tornado.auth
    * All ``callback`` arguments in this package have been removed. Use
      the coroutine interfaces instead.
    * The ``OAuthMixin._oauth_get_user`` method has been removed.
      Override `~.OAuthMixin._oauth_get_user_future` instead.
  + tornado.concurrent
    * The ``callback`` argument to `.run_on_executor` has been removed.
    * ``return_future`` has been removed.
  + tornado.gen
    * Some older portions of this module have been removed. This includes
      ``engine``, ``YieldPoint``, ``Callback``, ``Wait``, ``WaitAll``,
      ``MultiYieldPoint``, and ``Task``.
    * Functions decorated with ``@gen.coroutine`` no longer accept
      ``callback`` arguments.
  + tornado.httpclient
    * The behavior of ``raise_error=False`` has changed. Now only
      suppresses the errors raised due to completed responses with non-200
      status codes (previously it suppressed all errors).
    * The ``callback`` argument to `.AsyncHTTPClient.fetch` has been removed.
  + tornado.httputil
    * ``HTTPServerRequest.write`` has been removed. Use the methods of
      ``request.connection`` instead.
    * Unrecognized ``Content-Encoding`` values now log warnings only for
      content types that we would otherwise attempt to parse.
  + tornado.ioloop
    * ``IOLoop.set_blocking_signal_threshold``,
      ``IOLoop.set_blocking_log_threshold``, ``IOLoop.log_stack``,
      and ``IOLoop.handle_callback_exception`` have been removed.
    * Improved performance of `.IOLoop.add_callback`.
  + tornado.iostream
    * All ``callback`` arguments in this module have been removed except
      for `.BaseIOStream.set_close_callback`.
    * ``streaming_callback`` arguments to `.BaseIOStream.read_bytes` and
      `.BaseIOStream.read_until_close` have been removed.
    * Eliminated unnecessary logging of "Errno 0".
  + tornado.log
    * Log files opened by this module are now explicitly set to UTF-8 encoding.
  + tornado.netutil
    * The results of ``getaddrinfo`` are now sorted by address family to
      avoid partial failures and deadlocks.
  + tornado.platform.twisted
    * ``TornadoReactor`` and ``TwistedIOLoop`` have been removed.
  + tornado.simple_httpclient
    * The default HTTP client now supports the ``network_interface``
      request argument to specify the source IP for the connection.
    * If a server returns a 3xx response code without a ``Location``
      header, the response is raised or returned directly instead of
      trying and failing to follow the redirect.
    * When following redirects, methods other than ``POST`` will no longer
      be transformed into ``GET`` requests. 301 (permanent) redirects are
      now treated the same way as 302 (temporary) and 303 (see other)
      redirects in this respect.
    * Following redirects now works with ``body_producer``.
  + tornado.stack_context
    * The ``tornado.stack_context`` module has been removed.
  + tornado.tcpserver
    * `.TCPServer.start` now supports a ``max_restarts`` argument (same as
      `.fork_processes`).
  + tornado.testing
    * `.AsyncHTTPTestCase` now drops all references to the `.Application`
      during ``tearDown``, allowing its memory to be reclaimed sooner.
    * `.AsyncTestCase` now cancels all pending coroutines in ``tearDown``,
      in an effort to reduce warnings from the python runtime about
      coroutines that were not awaited. Note that this may cause
      ``asyncio.CancelledError`` to be logged in other places. Coroutines
      that expect to be running at test shutdown may need to catch this
      exception.
  + tornado.web
    * The ``asynchronous`` decorator has been removed.
    * The ``callback`` argument to `.RequestHandler.flush` has been removed.
    * `.StaticFileHandler` now supports large negative values for the
      ``Range`` header and returns an appropriate error for ``end >
      start``.
    * It is now possible to set ``expires_days`` in ``xsrf_cookie_kwargs``.
  + tornado.websocket
    * Pings and other messages sent while the connection is closing are
      now silently dropped instead of logging exceptions.
    * Errors raised by ``open()`` are now caught correctly when this method
      is a coroutine.
  + tornado.wsgi
    * ``WSGIApplication`` and ``WSGIAdapter`` have been removed.
- Rebase patches:
  * tornado-testsuite_timeout.patch
  * skip-failing-tests.patch
- Remove upstream-included openssl-cert-size.patch


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 16:04:26 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Rename to python-tornado5 to handle version incompatibilities
- Update to 5.1.1
  + Bug fixes
    * Fixed an case in which the `.Future` returned by
      `.RequestHandler.finish` could fail to resolve.
    * The `.TwitterMixin.authenticate_redirect` method works again.
    * Improved error handling in the `tornado.auth` module, fixing hanging
      requests when a network or other error occurs.
- Update to 5.1.0
  + Deprecation notice
    * Tornado 6.0 will drop support for Python 2.7 and 3.4. The minimum
      supported Python version will be 3.5.2.
    * The ``tornado.stack_context`` module is deprecated and will be removed
      in Tornado 6.0. The reason for this is that it is not feasible to
      provide this module's semantics in the presence of ``async def``
      native coroutines. ``ExceptionStackContext`` is mainly obsolete
      thanks to coroutines. ``StackContext`` lacks a direct replacement
      although the new ``contextvars`` package (in the Python standard
      library beginning in Python 3.7) may be an alternative.
    * Callback-oriented code often relies on ``ExceptionStackContext`` to
      handle errors and prevent leaked connections. In order to avoid the
      risk of silently introducing subtle leaks (and to consolidate all of
      Tornado's interfaces behind the coroutine pattern), ``callback``
      arguments throughout the package are deprecated and will be removed
      in version 6.0. All functions that had a ``callback`` argument
      removed now return a `.Future` which should be used instead.
    * Where possible, deprecation warnings are emitted when any of these
      deprecated interfaces is used. However, Python does not display
      deprecation warnings by default. To prepare your application for
      Tornado 6.0, run Python with the ``-Wd`` argument or set the
      environment variable ``PYTHONWARNINGS`` to ``d``. If your
      application runs on Python 3 without deprecation warnings, it should
      be able to move to Tornado 6.0 without disruption.
  + tornado.auth
    * `.OAuthMixin._oauth_get_user_future` may now be a native coroutine.
    * All ``callback`` arguments in this package are deprecated and will
      be removed in 6.0. Use the coroutine interfaces instead.
    * The ``OAuthMixin._oauth_get_user`` method is deprecated and will be removed in
      6.0. Override `~.OAuthMixin._oauth_get_user_future` instead.
  + tornado.autoreload
    * The command-line autoreload wrapper is now preserved if an internal
      autoreload fires.
    * The command-line wrapper no longer starts duplicated processes on windows
      when combined with internal autoreload.
  + tornado.concurrent
    * `.run_on_executor` now returns `.Future` objects that are compatible
      with ``await``.
    * The ``callback`` argument to `.run_on_executor` is deprecated and will
      be removed in 6.0.
    * ``return_future`` is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.
  + tornado.gen
    * Some older portions of this module are deprecated and will be removed
      in 6.0. This includes ``engine``, ``YieldPoint``, ``Callback``,
      ``Wait``, ``WaitAll``, ``MultiYieldPoint``, and ``Task``.
    * Functions decorated with ``@gen.coroutine`` will no longer accept
      ``callback`` arguments in 6.0.
  + tornado.httpclient
    * The behavior of ``raise_error=False`` is changing in 6.0. Currently
      it suppresses all errors; in 6.0 it will only suppress the errors
      raised due to completed responses with non-200 status codes.
    * The ``callback`` argument to `.AsyncHTTPClient.fetch` is deprecated
      and will be removed in 6.0.
    * `tornado.httpclient.HTTPError` has been renamed to
      `.HTTPClientError` to avoid ambiguity in code that also has to deal
      with `tornado.web.HTTPError`. The old name remains as an alias.
    * ``tornado.curl_httpclient`` now supports non-ASCII characters in
      username and password arguments.
    * ``.HTTPResponse.request_time`` now behaves consistently across
      ``simple_httpclient`` and ``curl_httpclient``, excluding time spent
      in the ``max_clients`` queue in both cases (previously this time was
      included in ``simple_httpclient`` but excluded in
      ``curl_httpclient``). In both cases the time is now computed using
      a monotonic clock where available.
    * `.HTTPResponse` now has a ``start_time`` attribute recording a
      wall-clock (`time.time`) timestamp at which the request started
      (after leaving the ``max_clients`` queue if applicable).
  + tornado.httputil
    * `.parse_multipart_form_data` now recognizes non-ASCII filenames in
      RFC 2231/5987 (``filename*=``) format.
    * ``HTTPServerRequest.write`` is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0. Use
      the methods of ``request.connection`` instead.
    * Malformed HTTP headers are now logged less noisily.
  + tornado.ioloop
    * `.PeriodicCallback` now supports a ``jitter`` argument to randomly
      vary the timeout.
    * ``IOLoop.set_blocking_signal_threshold``,
      ``IOLoop.set_blocking_log_threshold``, ``IOLoop.log_stack``,
      and ``IOLoop.handle_callback_exception`` are deprecated and will
      be removed in 6.0.
    * Fixed a `KeyError` in `.IOLoop.close` when `.IOLoop` objects are
      being opened and closed in multiple threads.
  + tornado.iostream
    * All ``callback`` arguments in this module are deprecated except for
      `.BaseIOStream.set_close_callback`. They will be removed in 6.0.
    * ``streaming_callback`` arguments to `.BaseIOStream.read_bytes` and
      `.BaseIOStream.read_until_close` are deprecated and will be removed
      in 6.0.
  + tornado.netutil
    * Improved compatibility with GNU Hurd.
  + tornado.options
    * `tornado.options.parse_config_file` now allows setting options to
      strings (which will be parsed the same way as
      `tornado.options.parse_command_line`) in addition to the specified
      type for the option.
  + tornado.platform.twisted
    * ``TornadoReactor`` and ``TwistedIOLoop`` are deprecated and will be
      removed in 6.0. Instead, Tornado will always use the asyncio event loop
      and twisted can be configured to do so as well.
``tornado.stack_context``
    * The ``tornado.stack_context`` module is deprecated and will be removed
      in 6.0.
  + tornado.testing
    * `.AsyncHTTPTestCase.fetch` now takes a ``raise_error`` argument.
      This argument has the same semantics as `.AsyncHTTPClient.fetch`,
      but defaults to false because tests often need to deal with non-200
      responses (and for backwards-compatibility).
    * The `.AsyncTestCase.stop` and `.AsyncTestCase.wait` methods are
      deprecated.
  + tornado.web
    * New method `.RequestHandler.detach` can be used from methods
      that are not decorated with ``@asynchronous`` (the decorator
      was required to use ``self.request.connection.detach()``.
    * `.RequestHandler.finish` and `.RequestHandler.render` now return
      ``Futures`` that can be used to wait for the last part of the
      response to be sent to the client.
    * `.FallbackHandler` now calls ``on_finish`` for the benefit of
      subclasses that may have overridden it.
    * The ``asynchronous`` decorator is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.
    * The ``callback`` argument to `.RequestHandler.flush` is deprecated
      and will be removed in 6.0.
  + tornado.websocket
    * When compression is enabled, memory limits now apply to the
      post-decompression size of the data, protecting against DoS attacks.
    * `.websocket_connect` now supports subprotocols.
    * `.WebSocketHandler` and `.WebSocketClientConnection` now have
      ``selected_subprotocol`` attributes to see the subprotocol in use.
    * The `.WebSocketHandler.select_subprotocol` method is now called with
      an empty list instead of a list containing an empty string if no
      subprotocols were requested by the client.
    * `.WebSocketHandler.open` may now be a coroutine.
    * The ``data`` argument to `.WebSocketHandler.ping` is now optional.
    * Client-side websocket connections no longer buffer more than one
      message in memory at a time.
    * Exception logging now uses `.RequestHandler.log_exception`.
  + tornado.wsgi
    * ``WSGIApplication`` and ``WSGIAdapter`` are deprecated and will be removed
      in Tornado 6.0.
- Update to 5.0.2
  + Bug fixes
    * Fixed a memory leak when `.IOLoop` objects are created and destroyed.
    * If `.AsyncTestCase.get_new_ioloop` returns a reference to a
      preexisting event loop (typically when it has been overridden to
      return `.IOLoop.current()`), the test's ``tearDown`` method will not
      close this loop.
    * Fixed a confusing error message when the synchronous `.HTTPClient`
      fails to initialize because an event loop is already running.
    * `.PeriodicCallback` no longer executes twice in a row due to
      backwards clock adjustments.
- Update to 5.0.1
  + Bug fix
    * This release restores support for versions of Python 3.4 prior to
      3.4.4. This is important for compatibility with Debian Jessie which
      has 3.4.2 as its version of Python 3.
  + Highlights
    * The focus of this release is improving integration with `asyncio`.
      On Python 3, the `.IOLoop` is always a wrapper around the `asyncio`
      event loop, and `asyncio.Future` and `asyncio.Task` are used instead
      of their Tornado counterparts. This means that libraries based on
      `asyncio` can be mixed relatively seamlessly with those using
      Tornado. While care has been taken to minimize the disruption from
      this change, code changes may be required for compatibility with
      Tornado 5.0, as detailed in the following section.
    * Tornado 5.0 supports Python 2.7.9+ and 3.4+. Python 2.7 and 3.4 are
      deprecated and support for them will be removed in Tornado 6.0,
      which will require Python 3.5+.
+ Backwards-compatibility notes
    * Python 3.3 is no longer supported.
    * Versions of Python 2.7 that predate the `ssl` module update are no
      longer supported. (The `ssl` module was updated in version 2.7.9,
      although in some distributions the updates are present in builds
      with a lower version number. Tornado requires `ssl.SSLContext`,
      `ssl.create_default_context`, and `ssl.match_hostname`)
    * Versions of Python 3.5 prior to 3.5.2 are no longer supported due to
      a change in the async iterator protocol in that version.
    * The ``trollius`` project (`asyncio` backported to Python 2) is no
      longer supported.
    * `tornado.concurrent.Future` is now an alias for `asyncio.Future`
      when running on Python 3. This results in a number of minor
      behavioral changes:
      > `.Future` objects can only be created while there is a current
        `.IOLoop`
      > The timing of callbacks scheduled with
        ``Future.add_done_callback`` has changed.
        `tornado.concurrent.future_add_done_callback` can be used to
        make the behavior more like older versions of Tornado (but not
        identical). Some of these changes are also present in the Python
        2 version of `tornado.concurrent.Future` to minimize the
        difference between Python 2 and 3.
      > Cancellation is now partially supported, via
        `asyncio.Future.cancel`. A canceled `.Future` can no longer have
        its result set. Applications that handle `~asyncio.Future`
        objects directly may want to use
        `tornado.concurrent.future_set_result_unless_cancelled`. In
        native coroutines, cancellation will cause an exception to be
        raised in the coroutine.
      > The ``exc_info`` and ``set_exc_info`` methods are no longer
        present. Use `tornado.concurrent.future_set_exc_info` to replace
        the latter, and raise the exception with
        `~asyncio.Future.result` to replace the former.
    * ``io_loop`` arguments to many Tornado functions have been removed.
      Use `.IOLoop.current()` instead of passing `.IOLoop` objects
      explicitly.
    * On Python 3, `.IOLoop` is always a wrapper around the `asyncio`
      event loop. ``IOLoop.configure`` is effectively removed on Python 3
      (for compatibility, it may be called to redundantly specify the
      `asyncio`-backed `.IOLoop`)
    * `.IOLoop.instance` is now a deprecated alias for `.IOLoop.current`.
      Applications that need the cross-thread communication behavior
      facilitated by `.IOLoop.instance` should use their own global variable
      instead.
  + Other notes
    * The ``futures`` (`concurrent.futures` backport) package is now required
      on Python 2.7.
    * The ``certifi`` and ``backports.ssl-match-hostname`` packages are no
      longer required on Python 2.7.
    * Python 3.6 or higher is recommended, because it features more
      efficient garbage collection of `asyncio.Future` objects.
  + tornado.auth
    * `.GoogleOAuth2Mixin` now uses a newer set of URLs.
  + tornado.autoreload
    * On Python 3, uses ``__main__.__spec`` to more reliably reconstruct
      the original command line and avoid modifying ``PYTHONPATH``.
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to `tornado.autoreload.start` has been removed.
  + tornado.concurrent
    * `tornado.concurrent.Future` is now an alias for `asyncio.Future`
      when running on Python 3. See "Backwards-compatibility notes" for
      more.
    * Setting the result of a ``Future`` no longer blocks while callbacks
      are being run. Instead, the callbacks are scheduled on the next
      `.IOLoop` iteration.
    * The deprecated alias ``tornado.concurrent.TracebackFuture`` has been
      removed.
    * `tornado.concurrent.chain_future` now works with all three kinds of
      ``Futures`` (Tornado, `asyncio`, and `concurrent.futures`)
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to `tornado.concurrent.run_on_executor` has
      been removed.
    * New functions `.future_set_result_unless_cancelled`,
      `.future_set_exc_info`, and `.future_add_done_callback` help mask
      the difference between `asyncio.Future` and Tornado's previous
      ``Future`` implementation.
  + tornado.curl_httpclient
    * Improved debug logging on Python 3.
    * The ``time_info`` response attribute now includes ``appconnect`` in
      addition to other measurements.
    * Closing a `.CurlAsyncHTTPClient` now breaks circular references that
      could delay garbage collection.
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to the `.CurlAsyncHTTPClient` constructor
      has been removed.
  + tornado.gen
    * ``tornado.gen.TimeoutError`` is now an alias for
      `tornado.util.TimeoutError`.
    * Leak detection for ``Futures`` created by this module now attributes
      them to their proper caller instead of the coroutine machinery.
    * Several circular references that could delay garbage collection have
      been broken up.
    * On Python 3, `asyncio.Task` is used instead of the Tornado coroutine
      runner. This improves compatibility with some `asyncio` libraries
      and adds support for cancellation.
    * The ``io_loop`` arguments to ``YieldFuture`` and `.with_timeout` have
      been removed.
  + tornado.httpclient
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to all `.AsyncHTTPClient` constructors has
      been removed.
  + tornado.httpserver
    * It is now possible for a client to reuse a connection after sending
      a chunked request.
    * If a client sends a malformed request, the server now responds with
      a 400 error instead of simply closing the connection.
    * ``Content-Length`` and ``Transfer-Encoding`` headers are no longer
      sent with 1xx or 204 responses (this was already true of 304
      responses).
    * When closing a connection to a HTTP/1.1 client, the ``Connection:
      close`` header is sent with the response.
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to the `.HTTPServer` constructor has been
      removed.
    * If more than one ``X-Scheme`` or ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header is
      present, only the last is used.
  + tornado.httputil
    * The string representation of `.HTTPServerRequest` objects (which are
      sometimes used in log messages) no longer includes the request
      headers.
    * New function `.qs_to_qsl` converts the result of
      `urllib.parse.parse_qs` to name-value pairs.
  + tornado.ioloop
    * ``tornado.ioloop.TimeoutError`` is now an alias for
      `tornado.util.TimeoutError`.
    * `.IOLoop.instance` is now a deprecated alias for `.IOLoop.current`.
    * `.IOLoop.install` and `.IOLoop.clear_instance` are deprecated.
    * The ``IOLoop.initialized`` method has been removed.
    * On Python 3, the `asyncio`-backed `.IOLoop` is always used and
      alternative `.IOLoop` implementations cannot be configured.
      `.IOLoop.current` and related methods pass through to
      `asyncio.get_event_loop`.
    * `~.IOLoop.run_sync` cancels its argument on a timeout. This
      results in better stack traces (and avoids log messages about leaks)
      in native coroutines.
    * New methods `.IOLoop.run_in_executor` and
      `.IOLoop.set_default_executor` make it easier to run functions in
      other threads from native coroutines (since
      `concurrent.futures.Future` does not support ``await``).
    * ``PollIOLoop`` (the default on Python 2) attempts to detect misuse
      of `.IOLoop` instances across `os.fork`.
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to `.PeriodicCallback` has been removed.
    * It is now possible to create a `.PeriodicCallback` in one thread
      and start it in another without passing an explicit event loop.
    * The ``IOLoop.set_blocking_signal_threshold`` and
      ``IOLoop.set_blocking_log_threshold`` methods are deprecated because
      they are not implemented for the `asyncio` event loop`. Use the
      ``PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1`` environment variable instead.
    * `.IOLoop.clear_current` now works if it is called before any
      current loop is established.
  + tornado.iostream
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to the `.IOStream` constructor has been removed.
    * New method `.BaseIOStream.read_into` provides a minimal-copy alternative to
      `.BaseIOStream.read_bytes`.
    * `.BaseIOStream.write` is now much more efficient for very large amounts of data.
    * Fixed some cases in which ``IOStream.error`` could be inaccurate.
    * Writing a `memoryview` can no longer result in "BufferError:
      Existing exports of data: object cannot be re-sized".
  + tornado.locks
    * As a side effect of the ``Future`` changes, waiters are always
      notified asynchronously with respect to `.Condition.notify`.
  + tornado.netutil
    * The default `.Resolver` now uses `.IOLoop.run_in_executor`.
      `.ExecutorResolver`, `.BlockingResolver`, and `.ThreadedResolver` are
      deprecated.
    * The ``io_loop`` arguments to `.add_accept_handler`,
      `.ExecutorResolver`, and `.ThreadedResolver` have been removed.
    * `.add_accept_handler` returns a callable which can be used to remove
      all handlers that were added.
    * `.OverrideResolver` now accepts per-family overrides.
  + tornado.options
    * Duplicate option names are now detected properly whether they use
      hyphens or underscores.
  + tornado.platform.asyncio
    * `.AsyncIOLoop` and `.AsyncIOMainLoop` are now used automatically
      when appropriate; referencing them explicitly is no longer
      recommended.
    * Starting an `.IOLoop` or making it current now also sets the
      `asyncio` event loop for the current thread. Closing an `.IOLoop`
      closes the corresponding `asyncio` event loop.
    * `.to_tornado_future` and `.to_asyncio_future` are deprecated since
      they are now no-ops.
    * `~.AnyThreadEventLoopPolicy` can now be used to easily allow the creation
      of event loops on any thread (similar to Tornado's prior policy).
  + tornado.platform.caresresolver
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to `.CaresResolver` has been removed.
  + tornado.platform.twisted
    * The ``io_loop`` arguments to ``TornadoReactor``, `.TwistedResolver`,
      and ``tornado.platform.twisted.install`` have been removed.
  + tornado.process
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to the `.Subprocess` constructor and
      `.Subprocess.initialize` has been removed.
  + tornado.routing
    * A default 404 response is now generated if no delegate is found for
      a request.
  + tornado.simple_httpclient
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to `.SimpleAsyncHTTPClient` has been removed.
    * TLS is now configured according to `ssl.create_default_context` by
      default.
  + tornado.tcpclient
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to the `.TCPClient` constructor has been
      removed.
    * `.TCPClient.connect` has a new ``timeout`` argument.
  + tornado.tcpserver
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to the `.TCPServer` constructor has been
      removed.
    * `.TCPServer` no longer logs ``EBADF`` errors during shutdown.
  + tornado.testing
    * The deprecated ``tornado.testing.get_unused_port`` and
      ``tornado.testing.LogTrapTestCase`` have been removed.
    * `.AsyncHTTPTestCase.fetch` now supports absolute URLs.
    * `.AsyncHTTPTestCase.fetch` now connects to ``127.0.0.1``
      instead of ``localhost`` to be more robust against faulty
      ipv6 configurations.
  + tornado.util
    * `tornado.util.TimeoutError` replaces ``tornado.gen.TimeoutError``
      and ``tornado.ioloop.TimeoutError``.
    * `.Configurable` now supports configuration at multiple levels of an
      inheritance hierarchy.
  + tornado.web
    * `.RequestHandler.set_status` no longer requires that the given
      status code appear in `http.client.responses`.
    * It is no longer allowed to send a body with 1xx or 204 responses.
    * Exception handling now breaks up reference cycles that could delay
      garbage collection.
    * `.RedirectHandler` now copies any query arguments from the request
      to the redirect location.
    * If both ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present
      in a request to `.StaticFileHandler`, the latter is now ignored.
  + tornado.websocket
    * The C accelerator now operates on multiple bytes at a time to
      improve performance.
    * Requests with invalid websocket headers now get a response with
      status code 400 instead of a closed connection.
    * `.WebSocketHandler.write_message` now raises `.WebSocketClosedError` if
      the connection closes while the write is in progress.
    * The ``io_loop`` argument to `.websocket_connect` has been removed.

- update to 4.4.2:
 * Tornado now requires Python 2.7 or 3.3+; versions 2.6 and 3.2 are no
   longer supported. Pypy3 is still supported even though its latest
   release is mainly based on Python 3.2.
 * The `monotonic <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/monotonic>`_ package is
   now supported as an alternative to `Monotime
   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Monotime>`_ for monotonic clock support
   on Python 2.

- add singledispatch and backports_abc dependencies

as stated in docs/releases/v4.3.0.rst


* Tornado has several new dependencies: (...)
  ``singledispatch`` on all Python versions prior to 3.4 (This was an
  optional dependency in prior versions of Tornado, and is now
  mandatory), and ``backports_abc>=0.4`` on all versions prior to
  3.5

Since this python module works with python version >= 2.7.9 (otherwise it would be called python3-tornado, afaiu)

Thu Sep 10 19:39:18 UTC 2015 - aboe76@gmail.com

- Update to 4.2.1:
  Security fix:
  * This release fixes a path traversal vulnerability in StaticFileHandler, 
  in which files whose names started with the static_path directory 
  but were not actually in that directory could be accessed.
- Update to 4.2:
  Backwards-compatibility:
  * SSLIOStream.connect and IOStream.start_tls now 
    validate certificates by default.
  * Certificate validation will now use the system CA root certificates 
    instead of certifi when possible (i.e. Python 2.7.9+ or 3.4+). 
    This includes IOStream and simple_httpclient, but not curl_httpclient
  * The default SSL configuration has become stricter, 
    using ssl.create_default_context where available on the client side. 
    (On the server side, applications are encouraged to migrate from 
    the ssl_options dict-based API to pass an ssl.SSLContext instead).
  * The deprecated classes in the tornado.auth module, GoogleMixin, 
    FacebookMixin, and FriendFeedMixin have been removed.
  * see more details:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 22 13:21:19 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 4.1:
  * If a `.Future` contains an exception but that exception is never
    examined or re-raised (e.g. by yielding the `.Future`), a stack
    trace will be logged when the `.Future` is garbage-collected.
  * New class `tornado.gen.WaitIterator` provides a way to iterate
    over ``Futures`` in the order they resolve.
  * The `tornado.websocket` module now supports compression via the
    "permessage-deflate" extension.  Override
    `.WebSocketHandler.get_compression_options` to enable on the server
    side, and use the ``compression_options`` keyword argument to
    `.websocket_connect` on the client side.
  * When the appropriate packages are installed, it is possible to yield
    `asyncio.Future` or Twisted ``Defered`` objects in Tornado coroutines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  1 15:23:31 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 4.0.2
  + Bug fixes
    * Fixed a bug that could sometimes cause a timeout to fire after being
      cancelled.
    * `.AsyncTestCase` once again passes along arguments to test methods,
      making it compatible with extensions such as Nose's test generators.
    * `.StaticFileHandler` can again compress its responses when gzip is enabled.
    * ``simple_httpclient`` passes its ``max_buffer_size`` argument to the
      underlying stream.
    * Fixed a reference cycle that can lead to increased memory consumption.
    * `.add_accept_handler` will now limit the number of times it will call
      `~socket.socket.accept` per `.IOLoop` iteration, addressing a potential
      starvation issue.
    * Improved error handling in `.IOStream.connect` (primarily for FreeBSD
      systems)
- Update to version 4.0.1
  + Bug fixes
    * The build will now fall back to pure-python mode if the C extension
      fails to build for any reason (previously it would fall back for some
      errors but not others).
    * `.IOLoop.call_at` and `.IOLoop.call_later` now always return
      a timeout handle for use with `.IOLoop.remove_timeout`.
    * If any callback of a `.PeriodicCallback` or `.IOStream` returns a
      `.Future`, any error raised in that future will now be logged
      (similar to the behavior of `.IOLoop.add_callback`).
    * Fixed an exception in client-side websocket connections when the
      connection is closed.
    * ``simple_httpclient`` once again correctly handles 204 status
      codes with no content-length header.
    * Fixed a regression in ``simple_httpclient`` that would result in
      timeouts for certain kinds of errors.
- Update to version 4.0.0
  + Highlights
    * The `tornado.web.stream_request_body` decorator allows large files to be
      uploaded with limited memory usage.
    * Coroutines are now faster and are used extensively throughout Tornado itself.
      More methods now return `Futures <.Future>`, including most `.IOStream`
      methods and `.RequestHandler.flush`.
    * Many user-overridden methods are now allowed to return a `.Future`
      for flow control.
    * HTTP-related code is now shared between the `tornado.httpserver`,
      ``tornado.simple_httpclient`` and `tornado.wsgi` modules, making support
      for features such as chunked and gzip encoding more consistent.
      `.HTTPServer` now uses new delegate interfaces defined in `tornado.httputil`
      in addition to its old single-callback interface.
    * New module `tornado.tcpclient` creates TCP connections with non-blocking
      DNS, SSL handshaking, and support for IPv6.
  + See more release details at 
    http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/releases/v4.0.0.html
- Update to version 3.2.2
  + Security fixes
    * The XSRF token is now encoded with a random mask on each request.
      This makes it safe to include in compressed pages without being
      vulnerable to the `BREACH attack <http://breachattack.com>`_.
      This applies to most applications that use both the ``xsrf_cookies``
      and ``gzip`` options (or have gzip applied by a proxy).
  + Backwards-compatibility notes
    * If Tornado 3.2.2 is run at the same time as older versions on the same
      domain, there is some potential for issues with the differing cookie
      versions.  The `.Application` setting ``xsrf_cookie_version=1`` can
      be used for a transitional period to generate the older cookie format
      on newer servers.
  + Other changes
    * ``tornado.platform.asyncio`` is now compatible with ``trollius`` version 0.3.

- Update to 2.4.1:
  - Fixed a memory leak in tornado.stack_context that was especially
    likely with long-running @gen.engine functions.
  - tornado.auth.TwitterMixin now works on Python 3.
  - Fixed a bug in which IOStream.read_until_close with a streaming
    callback would sometimes pass the last chunk of data to the
    final callback instead of the streaming callback.

Tue Apr 24 11:01:28 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.2.1:
  - tornado.web.RequestHandler.set_header now properly sanitizes
    input values to protect against header injection, response
    splitting, etc. (it has always attempted to do this, but the
    check was incorrect). Note that redirects, the most likely
    source of such bugs, are protected by a separate check in
    RequestHandler.redirect.
  - Colored logging configuration in tornado.options is compatible
    with Python 3.2.3 (and 3.3).

Tue Oct  4 23:57:09 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.1.1
  Bug fixes:
  - Fixed handling of closed connections with the epoll
    (i.e. Linux) IOLoop. Previously, closed connections could be
    shut down too early, which most often manifested as “Stream
    is closed” exceptions in SimpleAsyncHTTPClient.
  - Fixed a case in which chunked responses could be closed
    prematurely, leading to truncated output.
  - IOStream.connect now reports errors more consistently via
    logging and the close callback (this affects e.g. connections
    to localhost on FreeBSD).
  - IOStream.read_bytes again accepts both int and long arguments.
  - PeriodicCallback no longer runs repeatedly when IOLoop
    iterations complete faster than the resolution of time.time()
    (mainly a problem on Windows).
  Backwards-compatibility note
  - Listening for IOLoop.ERROR alone is no longer sufficient for
    detecting closed connections on an otherwise unused socket.
    IOLoop.ERROR must always be used in combination with READ or
    WRITE.
