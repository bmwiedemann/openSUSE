%description
This module allows you to manage a set of deprecations for one or more
modules.

When you import 'Package::DeprecationManager', you must provide a set of
'-deprecations' as a hash ref. The keys are "feature" names, and the values
are the version when that feature was deprecated.

In many cases, you can simply use the fully qualified name of a subroutine
or method as the feature name. This works for cases where the whole
subroutine is deprecated. However, the feature names can be any string.
This is useful if you don't want to deprecate an entire subroutine, just a
certain usage.

You can also provide an optional array reference in the '-ignore'
parameter.

The values to be ignored can be package names or regular expressions (made
with 'qr//'). Use this to ignore packages in your distribution that can
appear on the call stack when a deprecated feature is used.

As part of the import process, 'Package::DeprecationManager' will export
two subroutines into its caller. It provides an 'import()' sub for the
caller and a 'deprecated()' sub.

The 'import()' sub allows callers of _your_ class to specify an
'-api_version' parameter. If this is supplied, then deprecation warnings
are only issued for deprecations with API versions earlier than the one
specified.

You must call the 'deprecated()' sub in each deprecated subroutine. When
called, it will issue a warning using 'Carp::cluck()'.

The 'deprecated()' sub can be called in several ways. If you do not pass
any arguments, it will generate an appropriate warning message. If you pass
a single argument, this is used as the warning message.

Finally, you can call it with named arguments. Currently, the only allowed
names are 'message' and 'feature'. The 'feature' argument should correspond
to the feature name passed in the '-deprecations' hash.

If you don't explicitly specify a feature, the 'deprecated()' sub uses
'caller()' to identify its caller, using its fully qualified subroutine
name.

A given deprecation warning is only issued once for a given package. This
module tracks this based on both the feature name _and_ the error message
itself. This means that if you provide several different error messages for
the same feature, all of those errors will appear.
