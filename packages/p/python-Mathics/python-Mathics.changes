- Don't build for Python 3.6, due to no NumPy. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 28 01:52:38 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.1.1:
  * Mathics Packages added:
    - DiscreteMath`CombinatoricaV0.9 (preferred)
    - DiscreteMath`CombinatoricaV0.6.
  * New builtins:
    - StirlingS1, StirlingS2 (not all WL variations handled)
    - MapAt (not all WL variations handled)
    - PythonForm, SympyForm: these is not in WL. It simply will
      show a crude translation to sympy or python.
    - Throw and Catch
    - With
    - FileNameTake
  * Enhancements and Bug fixes:
    - Workaround for Compile so it accepts functions
      (gh#mathics/Mathics#1026)
    - Add Trace option to Get. Get["fn", Trace->True] will show
      lines as they are read.
    - Convert to/from Boolean types properly in from_python,
      to_python. Previously they were 0, and 1.
    - Extend DeleteCases to accept a levelspec parameter.
    - Set Evaluation#exc_result to capture Aborted, Timeout,
      Overflow1`, etc.
    - ImageData changed to get bits {0,1}, not booleans as
      previously.
    - Add tokenizer symbols for <-> and -> and the unicode
      versions of those.
    - Small corrections to Needs, e.g check if already loaded,
      correct a typo, etc.
    - System`$InputFileName is now set inside Needs and Get
    - Install shell scripts dmathicserver, dmathicsscript, and
      dmathics to simplify running docker
    - Adjust $InputFileName inside Get and Needs.
- Adapt file list to the renaming of mathicsscript to
  dmathicsscript and the addition of dmathicserver.

Sat Nov 14 22:17:20 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.1.0:
  * Add Symbolic Comparisons [gh#mathics/Mathics#1000].
  * Support for externally PyPI-packagable builtin modules -
    PyMathics.
  * SetDirectory fixes [gh#mathics/Mathics#994].
  * Catch `PatternError Exceptions.
  * Fix formatting of .. and ... (RepeatAll)
  * tokenization of \. without a following space (ReplaceAll)
    [gh#mathics/Mathics#992].
  * Support for assignments to named `Pattern`
  * Improving support for `Names [gh#mathics/Mathics#1003].
  * Adding a MathicsSession class to simplify running Mathics from
    Python [gh#mathics/Mathics#1001].
  * Improving support for `Protect` and `Unprotect` list
    of symbols and regular expressions [gh#mathics/Mathics#1003].
- Updated source URL.
- Disable python2 as it is not supported any more by upstream.
- Run tests:
  * Omit home_page tests as they require a running django server
    set up first.
  * Add additional BuildRequires needed for tests: python-Pint,
    python-chardet, python-palettable, python-pytest,
    python-requests.
- Sympy >= 1.6 is now required.
