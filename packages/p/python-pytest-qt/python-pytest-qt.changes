- Remove python_module macro definition
- Update to 4.2.0:
  * Import the code sub-package from the correct location rather than the
    deprecated py package, restoring compatibility with pytest 7.2.0, where py
    was dropped. Thanks @The-Compiler for the PR.
  * Use pytest.hookimpl to configure hooks, avoiding a deprecation warning in
    pytest 7.2.0. Thanks @The-Compiler for the PR.
  * Now pytest-qt will check if any of the Qt libraries is already imported by
    the time the plugin loads, and use it if that is the case (#412). Thanks
    @eyllanesc for the PR.
  * Most custom pytest-qt exceptions can be accessed via qtbot (for example
    qtbot.TimeoutError), but it was not always explicit in the documentation
    that this is the recommended way to access those exceptions, instead of
    importing them from pytestqt.exceptions. This is now clarified in the
    documentation and examples, and an alias to ScreenshotError has been added
    to qtbot so it can be accessed in the same way (#460).

Fri Jul  1 19:06:12 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 4.1.0
  * pytest-qt now requires Python 3.7+.
  * Improved PEP-8 aliases definition so they have a smaller call
    stack depth by one and better parameter suggestions in IDEs.
    (#383). Thanks @luziferius for the PR.
  * Updated model tester handling around hasChildren based on Qt's
    updates.
  * New qapp_cls fixture returning the QApplication class to use,
    thus making it easier to use a custom subclass without having
    to override the whole qapp fixture. Thanks @The-Compiler for
    the PR.
  * Updated model tester to track/verify in-flight changes based on
    Qt's updates. Thanks @The-Compiler for the PR.
  * New qtbot.screenshot() method which can be used to take a
    screenshot of the given widget. Thanks @The-Compiler for the
    PR.

- Enable pyside6 test flavor

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 12 20:18:59 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Allow either of the valid Qt binding implementations, do not hard
  require python-qt5
- Enable multibuild for tests with different implementations
  * Pyside2, PyQt5, PyQt6
  * Prepared for Pyside6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 14 15:02:19 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 4.0.2
  * Restored compatibility with PySide2 5.11, which doesn't depend on the
    ``shiboken2`` project, used by pytest-qt 4.0.0. The dependency is now not
    needed anymore, and the ``.isdeleted`` attribute of ``qt_compat`` (which
    isn't intended for public use) is removed.
- Release 4.0.1
  * The ``sip`` module now gets imported directly if ``PyQt5.sip`` /
    ``PyQt6.sip`` wasn't found, as it's still packaged like that in some
    distributions (`#369`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
- Release 4.0.0
  * `PySide6 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide6>`__ and `PyQt6 <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6>`__ (6.1+)
    are now supported. Thanks `@jensheilman`_ and `@The-Compiler`_ for the PRs (`#328`_, `#330`_).
  * ``pytest-qt`` now requires Python 3.6+.
  * When using PyQt5, ``pytest-qt`` now requires PyQt5 5.11 or newer (`#330`_).
  * Support for Qt4 (i.e. ``PyQt4`` and ``PySide``) is now dropped (`#279`_).
  * The ``qtbot.waitActive`` and ``qtbot.waitExposed`` context managers are now
    available with all Qt APIs, rather than only PyQt5 (`#361`_). Thanks
    `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * The ``qtbot.waitForWindowShown`` method is deprecated, as the underlying Qt
    method was obsoleted in Qt 5.0 and removed in Qt 6.0. Its name is imprecise and
    the pytest-qt wrapper does not raise TimeoutError if the window wasn't shown.
    Please use the ``qtbot.waitExposed`` context manager instead (`#361`_). Thanks
    `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * The old ``qtbot.stopForInteraction()`` name is now removed as it was
    cumbersome and rarely used. Use ``qtbot.stop()`` (added in 1.1.1) instead
    (`#306`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * The old ``SignalTimeoutError`` exception alias is now removed, as it was renamed to
    ``TimeoutError`` in 2.1 (`#306`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * The old ``qt_wait_signal_raising`` option is now removed, as it was renamed to
    ``qt_default_raising`` in 3.1 (`#306`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * ``qtbot.waitSignal`` and ``waitSignals`` (as well as their PEP-8 aliases)
    supported passing ``None`` as signal, making them wait for the given timeout
    instead. This is not supported anymore, use ``qtbot.wait(ms)`` instead
    (`#306`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * Various arguments to ``qtbot`` methods are now keyword-only (`#366`_):
    * ``qtbot.waitActive``: ``timeout`` (``widget`` being the only positional argument)
    * ``qtbot.waitExposed``: ``timeout`` (``widget`` being the only positional argument)
    * ``qtbot.waitSignal``:  ``timeout``, ``raising`` and ``check_params_cb`` (``signal`` being the only positional argument)
    * ``qtbot.waitSignals``:  ``timeout``, ``raising`` and ``check_params_cbs`` (``signals`` being the only positional argument)
    * ``qtbot.assertNotEmitted``:  ``wait`` (``signal`` being the only positional argument)
    * ``qtbot.waitUntil``:  ``timeout`` (``callback`` being the only positional argument)
    * ``qtbot.waitCallback``:  ``timeout`` and ``raising`` (with no positional arguments)
    The same applies to the respective PEP-8 aliases. Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for
    the PR.
  * Various classes are now not importable from ``pytestqt.plugin`` anymore, and
    should instead be imported from the module they're residing in since the 1.6.0
    release (`#306`_):
    * ``pytestqt.plugin.QtBot`` -> ``pytestqt.qtbot.QtBot``
    * ``pytestqt.plugin.SignalBlocker`` -> ``pytestqt.wait_signal.SignalBlocker``
    * ``pytestqt.plugin.MultiSignalBlocker`` -> ``pytestqt.wait_signal.MultiSignalBlocker``
    * ``pytestqt.plugin.Record`` -> ``pytestqt.logging.Record``
    * ``pytestqt.plugin.capture_exceptions`` ->
      ``pytestqt.exceptions.capture_exceptions`` (but consider using
      ``qtbot.capture_exceptions`` instead)
    * ``pytestqt.plugin.format_captured_exceptions`` ->
      ``pytestqt.exceptions.format_captured_exceptions``
  * The ``qt_api.extract_from_variant`` and ``qt_api.make_variant`` functions
    (which were never intended for public usage) as well as all class aliases
    (such as ``qt_api.QWidget`` or ``qt_api.QEvent``, among others) are now
    removed. Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * The default timeouts for ``qtbot.waitSignal``, ``waitSignals``, ``waitUntil``
    and ``waitCallback``, ``waitActive`` and ``waitExposed`` have been raised from
    1s to 5s. This makes them in line the default timeout used by Qt's underlying
    methods such as ``QSignalSpy::wait``. To get the old behavior back, explicitly
    pass ``timeout=1000`` to those functions (`#306`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_
    for the PR.
  * ``waitUntil`` now raises a ``TimeoutError`` when a timeout occurs to make the
    cause of the timeout more explict (`#222`_). Thanks `@karlch`_ for the PR.
  * The ``QtTest::keySequence`` method is now exposed (if available, with Qt >=
    5.10) (`#289`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * ``addWidget`` now enforces that its argument is a ``QWidget`` in order to
    display a clearer error when this isn't the case (`#290`_). Thanks
    `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * New option ``qt_qapp_name`` can be used to set the name of the
    ``QApplication`` created by ``pytest-qt``, defaulting to ``"pytest-qt-qapp"``
    (`#302`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * When the ``-s`` (``--capture=no``) argument is passed to pytest, Qt log
    capturing is now disabled as well (`#300`_). Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
  * PEP-8 aliases (``add_widget``, ``wait_active``, etc) are no longer just simple
    assignments to the methods, but they are real methods which call the normal
    implementations. This makes subclasses work as expected, instead of having to
    duplicate the assignment (`#326`_, `#333`_). Thanks `@oliveira-mauricio`_ and
    `@jensheilman`_ for the PRs.
  * Errors related to the ``qt_compat`` module (such as an invalid
    ``PYTEST_QT_API`` setting or missing Qt API wrappers) are now shown as a more
    human-readable error message rather than an internal pytest error (`#355`_). Thanks
    `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.

Fri Sep 25 09:19:58 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- require a default ttf font gh#pytest-dev/pytest-qt#317
- move to %pytest macro and use pytest-xvfb plugin
- drop skip-timeout-tests.patch; deselect by pytest -k parameter

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  6 13:07:28 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.3.0:
  * Improve message in uncaught exceptions by mentioning the Qt event loop instead of Qt virtual methods (#255).
  * pytest-qt now requires pytest version >= 3.0.
  * qtbot.addWiget now supports an optional before_close_func keyword-only argument, which if given is a function which is called before the widget is closed, with the widget as first argument.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 31 09:05:27 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.2.2:
  * Fix Off-by-one error in modeltester (#249). Thanks @ext-jmmugnes for the PR.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  7 19:04:18 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.2.1
  * Fixed compatibility with PyQt5 5.11.3
- Update to version 3.2.0
  * The ``CallbackBlocker`` returned by ``qtbot.waitCallback()`` now has a new
    ``assert_called_with(...)`` convenience method.
- Update to version 3.1.0
  * If Qt's model tester implemented in C++ is available (PyQt5 5.11 or newer),
    the ``qtmodeltester`` fixture now uses that instead of the Python
    implementation. This can be turned off by passing  ``force_py=True`` to
    ``qtmodeltester.check()``.
  * The Python code used by ``qtmodeltester`` is now based on the latest Qt
    modeltester. This also means that the ``data_display_may_return_none``
    attribute for ``qtmodeltester`` isn't used anymore.
  * New ``qtbot.waitCallback()`` method that returns a ``CallbackBlocker``, which
    can be used to wait for a callback to be called.
  * ``qtbot.assertNotEmitted`` now has a new ``wait`` parameter which can be used
    to make sure asynchronous signals aren't emitted by waiting after the code in
    the ``with`` block finished.
  * The ``qt_wait_signal_raising`` option was renamed to ``qt_default_raising``.
    The old name continues to work, but is deprecated.
  * The docs still referred to ``SignalTimeoutError`` in some places, despite it
    being renamed to ``TimeoutError`` in the 2.1 release. This is now corrected.
  * Improve debugging output when no Qt wrapper was found.
  * When no context is available for warnings on Qt 5, no ``None:None:0`` line is
    shown anymore.
  * The ``no_qt_log`` marker is now registered with pytest so ``--strict`` can be
    used.
  * ``qtbot.waitSignal`` with timeout ``0`` now expects the signal to arrive
    directly in the code enclosed by it.
- Update to version 3.0.2
  * Another fix related to ``QtInfoMsg`` objects during logging (`#225`_).
- Update to version 3.0.1
  * Fix handling of ``QtInfoMsg`` objects during logging (`#225`_).
    Thanks `@willsALMANJ`_ for the report.
- Update to version 3.0.0
  * Removed ``qtbot.mouseEvent`` proxy, it was an internal Qt function which has
    now been removed in PyQt 5.11 (`#219`_). Thanks `@mitya57`_ for the PR.
  * Fix memory leak when tests raised an exception inside Qt virtual methods (`#187`_).
    Thanks `@fabioz`_ for the report and PR.
