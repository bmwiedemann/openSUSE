  <title>A set of classes for core data, message and XML handling</title>
  <description>The *RPC::XML* package is an implementation of the *XML-RPC* standard.

The package provides a set of classes for creating values to pass to the
constructors for requests and responses. These are lightweight objects,
most of which are implemented as tied scalars so as to associate specific
type information with the value. Classes are also provided for requests,
responses, faults (errors) and a parser based on the the XML::Parser
manpage package from CPAN.

This module does not actually provide any transport implementation or
server basis. For these, see the RPC::XML::Client manpage and the
RPC::XML::Server manpage, respectively.</description>
