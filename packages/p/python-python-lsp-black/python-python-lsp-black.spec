Black plugin for the Python LSP Server

To avoid unexpected results you should make sure yapf and autopep8 are not installed.

- pyls-black can either format an entire file or just the selected text.
- The code will only be formatted if it is syntactically valid Python.
- Text selections are treated as if they were a separate Python file.
  Unfortunately this means you can't format an indented block of code.
- python-lsp-black will use your project's pyproject.toml if it has one.
