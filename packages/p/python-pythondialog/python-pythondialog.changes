- Update to version 3.5.3 

	Fix related to the 'timeout' option (--timeout for dialog)

	* dialog.py (Dialog._perform): ignore the dialog output when a timeout
	occurred, which we know thanks to the exit code. Without this change,
	output parsing or checking (e.g., in Dialog._widget_with_no_output())
	would be broken by the '\ntimeout\n' string printed by dialog in such
	cases (seen with msgbox, at least).

	It might be that parsing is still disturbed for some widgets when a
	timeout occurs, if they never produce an empty output in a no-timeout
	situation: this remains to be checked. Also, it appears that the
	--timeout option doesn't work with all widgets in the dialog
	backend (tested with dialog 1.3-20201126: 'msgbox', 'checklist' and
	'menu' support --timeout; 'inputbox' and 'mixedform' don't; other
	widgets untested with this option).

	Show use of d.add_persistent_args(["--no-nl-expand"]) in examples

	* Using this option is quite relevant when using pythondialog. Thanks to
	ChristianTacke for the report. Closes:
	<https://github.com/frougon/pythondialog/issues/8>.

	Improve support for the --timeout dialog option

	* Set DIALOG_TIMEOUT in the environment when invoking dialog; this
	allows us to distinguish between DIALOG_TIMEOUT and DIALOG_ESC. Add
	the corresponding TIMEOUT attribute to the Dialog class. Thanks to
	Rolf for the report. Closes:
	<https://sourceforge.net/p/pythondialog/bugs/11/>.

- Update to version 3.5.1

        README.rst: update the latest version of the Python 2 backport

	* README.rst: the latest version of the Python 2 backport is now 3.5.1.
	This will also be the last version, unless metadata needs to be updated
	(e.g., if the home page or Git repository were to move, we would
	probably have to make a new upload in order to update the data published
	on PyPI).
 
        Safer instruction when using easy_install

	* INSTALL: when easy_install is mentioned (deprecated method!),
	explicitly use <base_dir>/bin/easy_install to ensure it comes from the
	right Python installation.

        demo: remove invalid escape sequence from sample string

	* examples/with-autowidgetsize/demo.py: same change as in commit
	94f0dc952f7cfe7cecc7865dd3febf4a457072c0, since the file is essentially
	a copy of examples/demo.py. The escape sequence \/ is invalid in normal
	strings; use a raw string here, since the goal was to display both
	characters.
