  tests.video_test.VideoModuleTest.test_renderer_set_viewport
  (gh#pygame/pygame#2721 and gh#pygame/pygame#2670) on 32bit

Tue Apr 27 11:22:12 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Explictly require libudev while building (for staging)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 23 20:56:42 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.0.1 The Age Of Aquarius release
  * This is a bug fix release, with a bunch of features and
    optimizations thrown in for good measure.
  * Backwards compatibility fixes
  * Major event refactor
  * Color.update() and Rect.update()
  * SDL 2.0.14
  * Xbox One port
  * pathlib support for image, sound, and font loading.
  * Cursor object API
  * pygame.draw.rect fixes.
- pygame 2.0 - the happy dance birthday release
  * Support for Metal, Direct 3d, Vulkan, OpenGL 3.0+ in various
    profiles (core, compatibility, debug, robust, etc), OpenGL ES,
    and other modern hardware accelerated video APIs across many
    platforms.
  * SSE2/Neon assembly image drawing. Much faster drawing
    routines, image loading, and alpha blending.
  * Type Hints, for code completion (and to help you make the
    squiggly lines disappear) in editors and IDEs.
  * Code cleanup, using lots of code robustness tools like static
    analyzers, and automated CI/CD. We've been able to help dozens
    of people new to community projects contribute. We have lots
    of work to go on code quality, but we're currently the highest
    rated Python and highest rate C large project on LGTM.
  * Many, many bug fixes including in our pygame.draw routines,
    pygame.math(for vectors), and pygame.mask for pixel perfect
    collision detection.
  * better support for PyPy (the fast JIT based implementation of
    python). See our milestone Are we pypy yet? No. for our
    progress on making PyPy the best python for games.
  * libsdl version 2 support. Technically pygame 2.0 still works
    with SDL 1, but we recommend SDL2 which is vastly improved
    over SDL1 for most use cases. Probably we will remove SDL 1
    support starting pygame 2.1.
  * Touch support (multitouch, gestures, etc)
  * Audio input support (make games with your microphone!).
  * Message alert boxes (Press OK, or Cancel).
  * Better keyboard support. Proper unicode input and IME support.
  * Much improved game controller support.
  * Better image and audio format support. Including: webp, 32bit
    wav files, and much more reliable mp3 support.
  * Multiple display support, and multiple window support (multi
    window support is still experimental, more will come in pygame
    2.1).
  * Android support through python for android (fork of pygame
    subset for android). Better documentation, and better support
    will come in future releases.
  * to make distributing your apps easier, a built in "pyinstaller
    hook"and compatibility with cxfreeze.
  * binary "wheels" on many platforms and versions of python from
    the old python 2.7 - to the latest python 3.9 (and with pypy!).
  * lots of quality of life improvements like Surface.fill
    ('black') instead of Surface.fill(pygame.Color(0, 0, 0)). Also
    keywords are supported for many more function arguments. You
    can draw rounded corners on rects.
  * plenty of new examples, like python3 -m pygame.examples.
    font_viewer, and python3 -m pygame.examples.music_drop_fade.
    Additionally the example source code has been cleaned up a lot
    to follow a more current python style.
  * Hundreds of documentation improvements, include a new Korean
    tutorial.
  * a special SCALED mode which takes low pixel games and
    automatically translates them to a larger window. Imagine your
    320x200 resolution game of glorious pixel art... on modern
    screens that would be a very tiny windows. Now with SCALED it
    shows up big on a Full HD screen, or even a 4K/8K screen and
    the translation of mouse coordinates and up-scaling of pixels
    is done for you (hardware accelerated of course).
