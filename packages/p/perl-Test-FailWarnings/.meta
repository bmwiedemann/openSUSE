  <title>Add test failures if warnings are caught</title>
  <description>This module hooks '$SIG{__WARN__}' and converts warnings to the Test::More
manpage's 'fail()' calls. It is designed to be used with 'done_testing',
when you don't need to know the test count in advance.

Just as with the Test::NoWarnings manpage, this does not catch warnings if
other things localize '$SIG{__WARN__}', as this is designed to catch
_unhandled_ warnings.</description>
