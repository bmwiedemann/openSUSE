%description
Objects in this class provide access to _terminfo_ database entires.

This database provides information about a terminal, in three separate sets
of capabilities. Flag capabilities indicate the presence of a particular
ability, feature, or bug simply by their presence. Number capabilities give
the size, count or other numeric detail of some feature of the terminal.
String capabilities are usually control strings that the terminal will
recognise, or send.

Capabilities each have two names; a short name called the capname, and a
longer name called the varname. This class provides two sets of methods,
one that works on capnames, one that work on varnames.

This module optionally uses _unibilium_ to access the terminfo(5) database,
if it is available at compile-time. If not, it will use _<term.h>_ and
_-lcurses_. For more detail, see the SEE ALSO section below.
