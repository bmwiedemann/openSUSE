- version update to 3.4.1
  * 3.4.1
    * Move the username argument in the Redis and Connection classes to the
      end of the argument list. This helps those poor souls that specify all
      their connection options as non-keyword arguments. #1276
    * Prior to ACL support, redis-py ignored the username component of
      Connection URLs. With ACL support, usernames are no longer ignored and
      are used to authenticate against an ACL rule. Some cloud vendors with
      managed Redis instances (like Heroku) provide connection URLs with a
      username component pre-ACL that is not intended to be used. Sending that
      username to Redis servers < 6.0.0 results in an error. Attempt to detect
      this condition and retry the AUTH command with only the password such
      that authentication continues to work for these users. #1274
    * Removed the __eq__ hooks to Redis and ConnectionPool that were added
      in 3.4.0. This ended up being a bad idea as two separate connection
      pools be considered equal yet manage a completely separate set of
      connections.
  * 3.4.0
    * Allow empty pipelines to be executed if there are WATCHed keys.
      This is a convenient way to test if any of the watched keys changed
      without actually running any other commands. Thanks @brianmaissy.
      #1233, #1234
    * Removed support for end of life Python 3.4.
    * Added support for all ACL commands in Redis 6. Thanks @IAmATeaPot418
      for helping.
    * Pipeline instances now always evaluate to True. Prior to this change,
      pipeline instances relied on __len__ for boolean evaluation which
      meant that pipelines with no commands on the stack would be considered
      False. #994
    * Client instances and Connection pools now support a 'client_name'
      argument. If supplied, all connections created will call CLIENT SETNAME
      as soon as the connection is opened. Thanks to @Habbie for supplying
      the basis of this change. #802
    * Added the 'ssl_check_hostname' argument to specify whether SSL
      connections should require the server hostname to match the hostname
      specified in the SSL cert. By default 'ssl_check_hostname' is False
      for backwards compatibility. #1196
    * Slightly optimized command packing. Thanks @Deneby67. #1255
    * Added support for the TYPE argument to SCAN. Thanks @netocp. #1220
    * Better thread and fork safety in ConnectionPool and
      BlockingConnectionPool. Added better locking to synchronize critical
      sections rather than relying on CPython-specific implementation details
      relating to atomic operations. Adjusted how the pools identify and
      deal with a fork. Added a ChildDeadlockedError exception that is
      raised by child processes in the very unlikely chance that a deadlock
      is encountered. Thanks @gmbnomis, @mdellweg, @yht804421715. #1270,
      #1138, #1178, #906, #1262
    * Added __eq__ hooks to the Redis and ConnectionPool classes.
      Thanks @brainix. #1240

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 18 08:54:01 UTC 2019 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- Update to 3.2.0 bsc#1131555:
    * Added support for `select.poll` to test whether data can be read
      on a socket. This should allow for significantly more connections to
      be used with pubsub. Fixes #486/#1115
    * Attempt to guarentee that the ConnectionPool hands out healthy
      connections. Healthy connections are those that have an established
      socket connection to the Redis server, are ready to accept a command
      and have no data available to read. Fixes #1127/#886
    * Use the socket.IPPROTO_TCP constant instead of socket.SOL_TCP.
      IPPROTO_TCP is available on more interpreters (Jython for instance).
      Thanks @Junnplus. #1130
    * Fixed a regression introduced in 3.0 that mishandles exceptions not
      derived from the base Exception class. KeyboardInterrupt and
      gevent.timeout notable. Thanks Christian Fersch. #1128/#1129
    * Significant improvements to handing connections with forked processes.
      Parent and child processes no longer trample on each others' connections.
      Thanks to Jay Rolette for the patch and highlighting this issue.
      #504/#732/#784/#863
    * PythonParser no longer closes the associated connection's socket. The
      connection itself will close the socket. #1108/#1085

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 15 11:43:24 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.0:
    * Connection URLs must have one of the following schemes:
      redis://, rediss://, unix://. Thanks @jdupl123. #961/#969
    * Fixed an issue with retry_on_timeout logic that caused some TimeoutErrors
      to be retried. Thanks Aaron Yang. #1022/#1023
    * Added support for SNI for SSL. Thanks @oridistor and Roey Prat. #1087
    * Fixed ConnectionPool repr for pools with no connections. Thanks
      Cody Scott. #1043/#995
    * Fixed GEOHASH to return a None value when specifying a place that
      doesn't exist on the server. Thanks @guybe7. #1126
    * Fixed XREADGROUP to return an empty dictionary for messages that
      have been deleted but still exist in the unacknowledged queue. Thanks
      @xeizmendi. #1116
    * Added an owned method to Lock objects. owned returns a boolean
      indicating whether the current lock instance still owns the lock.
      Thanks Dave Johansen. #1112
    * Allow lock.acquire() to accept an optional token argument. If
      provided, the token argument is used as the unique value used to claim
      the lock. Thankd Dave Johansen. #1112
    * Added a reacquire method to Lock objects. reaquire attempts to renew
      the lock such that the timeout is extended to the same value that the
      lock was initially acquired with. Thanks Ihor Kalnytskyi. #1014
    * Stream names found within XREAD and XREADGROUP responses now properly
      respect the decode_responses flag.
    * XPENDING_RANGE now requires the user the specify the min, max and
      count arguments. Newer versions of Redis prevent ount from being
      infinite so it's left to the user to specify these values explicitly.
    * ZADD now returns None when xx=True and incr=True and an element
      is specified that doesn't exist in the sorted set. This matches
      what the server returns in this case. #1084
    * Added client_kill_filter that accepts various filters to identify
      and kill clients. Thanks Theofanis Despoudis. #1098
    * Fixed a race condition that occurred when unsubscribing and
      resubscribing to the same channel or pattern in rapid succession.
      Thanks Marcin Raczyński. #764
    * Added a LockNotOwnedError that is raised when trying to extend or
      release a lock that is no longer owned. This is a subclass of LockError
      so previous code should continue to work as expected. Thanks Joshua
      Harlow. #1095
    * Fixed a bug in GEORADIUS that forced decoding of places without
      respecting the decode_responses option. Thanks Bo Bayles. #1082

Fri Nov 16 08:48:26 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 3.0.1:
 * Fixed regression with UnixDomainSocketConnection caused by 3.0.0.
   Thanks Jyrki Muukkonen
 * Fixed an issue with the new asynchronous flag on flushdb and flushall.
   Thanks rogeryen
 * Updated Lock.locked() method to indicate whether *any* process has
   acquired the lock, not just the current one. This is in line with
   the behavior of threading.Lock. Thanks Alan Justino da Silva
- update to version 3.0.0:
 BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
 * When using a Lock as a context manager and the lock fails to be acquired
   a LockError is now raised. This prevents the code block inside the
   context manager from being executed if the lock could not be acquired.
 * Renamed LuaLock to Lock.
 * Removed the pipeline based Lock implementation in favor of the LuaLock
   implementation.
 * Only bytes, strings and numbers (ints, longs and floats) are acceptable
   for keys and values. Previously redis-py attempted to cast other types
   to str() and store the result. This caused must confusion and frustration
   when passing boolean values (cast to 'True' and 'False') or None values
   (cast to 'None'). It is now the user's responsibility to cast all
   key names and values to bytes, strings or numbers before passing the
   value to redis-py.
 * The StrictRedis class has been renamed to Redis. StrictRedis will
   continue to exist as an alias of Redis for the forseeable future.
 * The legacy Redis client class has been removed. It caused much confusion
   to users.
 * ZINCRBY arguments 'value' and 'amount' have swapped order to match the
   the Redis server. The new argument order is: keyname, amount, value.
 * MGET no longer raises an error if zero keys are passed in. Instead an
   empty list is returned.
 * MSET and MSETNX now require all keys/values to be specified in a single
   dictionary argument named mapping. This was changed to allow for future
   options to these commands in the future.
 * ZADD now requires all element names/scores be specified in a single
   dictionary argument named mapping. This was required to allow the NX,
   XX, CH and INCR options to be specified.
 * Removed support for EOL Python 2.6 and 3.3. Thanks jdufresne
 OTHER CHANGES
 * Added missing DECRBY command. Thanks derek-dchu
 * CLUSTER INFO and CLUSTER NODES respones are now properly decoded to
   strings.
 * Added a 'locked()' method to Lock objects. This method returns True
   if the lock has been acquired and owned by the current process,
   otherwise False.
 * EXISTS now supports multiple keys. It's return value is now the number
   of keys in the list that exist.
 * Ensure all commands can accept key names as bytes. This fixes issues
   with BLPOP, BRPOP and SORT.
 * All errors resulting from bad user input are raised as DataError
   exceptions. DataError is a subclass of RedisError so this should be
   transparent to anyone previously catching these.
 * Added support for NX, XX, CH and INCR options to ZADD
 * Added support for the MIGRATE command
 * Added support for the MEMORY USAGE and MEMORY PURGE commands. Thanks
   Itamar Haber
 * Added support for the 'asynchronous' argument to FLUSHDB and FLUSHALL
   commands. Thanks Itamar Haber
 * Added support for the BITFIELD command. Thanks Charles Leifer and
   Itamar Haber
 * Improved performance on pipeline requests with large chunks of data.
   Thanks tzickel
 * Fixed test suite to not fail if another client is connected to the
   server the tests are running against.
 * Added support for SWAPDB. Thanks Itamar Haber
 * Added support for all STREAM commands. Thanks Roey Prat and Itamar Haber
 * SHUTDOWN now accepts the 'save' and 'nosave' arguments. Thanks
   dwilliams-kenzan
 * Added support for ZPOPMAX, ZPOPMIN, BZPOPMAX, BZPOPMIN. Thanks
   Itamar Haber
 * Added support for the 'type' argument in CLIENT LIST. Thanks Roey Prat
 * Added support for CLIENT PAUSE. Thanks Roey Prat
 * Added support for CLIENT ID and CLIENT UNBLOCK. Thanks Itamar Haber
 * GEODIST now returns a None value when referencing a place that does
   not exist. Thanks qingping209
 * Added a ping() method to pubsub objects. Thanks krishan-carbon
 * Fixed a bug with keys in the INFO dict that contained ':' symbols.
   Thanks mzalimeni
 * ssl_cert_reqs now has a default value of 'required' by default. This
   should make connecting to a remote Redis server over SSL more secure.
   Thanks u2mejc
 * Fixed the select system call retry compatibility with Python 2.x.
   Thanks lddubeau
 * max_connections is now a valid querystring argument for creating
   connection pools from URLs. Thanks mmaslowskicc
 * Added the UNLINK command. Thanks yozel
 * Added socket_type option to Connection for configurability.
   Thanks garlicnation
 * Lock.do_acquire now atomically sets acquires the lock and sets the
   expire value via set(nx=True, px=timeout). Thanks 23doors
 * Added 'count' argument to SPOP. Thanks AlirezaSadeghi
 * Fixed an issue parsing client_list respones that contained an '='.
   Thanks swilly22

Tue Nov 15 12:35:46 UTC 2016 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 2.10.5:
  * Allow URL encoded parameters in Redis URLs. Characters like a "/" can
    now be URL encoded and redis-py will correctly decode them. Thanks
  * Added support for the WAIT command. Thanks https://github.com/eshizhan
  * Better shutdown support for the PubSub Worker Thread. It now properly
    cleans up the connection, unsubscribes from any channels and patterns
    previously subscribed to and consumes any waiting messages on the socket.
  * Added the ability to sleep for a brief period in the event of a
    WatchError occuring. Thanks Joshua Harlow.
  * Fixed a bug with pipeline error reporting when dealing with characters
    in error messages that could not be encoded to the connection's
    character set. Thanks Hendrik Muhs.
  * Fixed a bug in Sentinel connections that would inadvertantly connect
    to the master when the connection pool resets. Thanks
    https://github.com/df3n5
  * Better timeout support in Pubsub get_message. Thanks Andy Isaacson.
  * Fixed a bug with the HiredisParser that would cause the parser to
     get stuck in an endless loop if a specific number of bytes were
    delivered from the socket. This fix also increases performance of
     parsing large responses from the Redis server.
   * Added support for ZREVRANGEBYLEX.
   * ConnectionErrors are now raised if Redis refuses a connection due to
     the maxclients limit being exceeded. Thanks Roman Karpovich.
   * max_connections can now be set when instantiating client instances.
     Thanks Ohad Perry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  2 16:17:27 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.10.3
  * Fixed a bug with the bytearray support introduced in 2.10.2. Thanks
    Josh Owen.
- Update to version 2.10.2
  * Added support for Hiredis's new bytearray support. Thanks
    https://github.com/tzickel
  * POSSIBLE BACKWARDS INCOMPATBLE CHANGE: Fixed a possible race condition
    when multiple threads share the same Lock instance with a timeout. Lock
    tokens are now stored in thread local storage by default. If you have
    code that acquires a lock in one thread and passes that lock instance to
    another thread to release it, you need to disable thread local storage.
    Refer to the doc strings on the Lock class about the thread_local
    argument information.
  * Fixed a regression in from_url where "charset" and "errors" weren't
    valid options. "encoding" and "encoding_errors" are still accepted
    and preferred.
  * The "charset" and "errors" options have been deprecated. Passing
    either to StrictRedis.__init__ or from_url will still work but will
    also emit a DeprecationWarning. Instead use the "encoding" and
    "encoding_errors" options.
  * Fixed a compatability bug with Python 3 when the server closes a
    connection.
  * Added BITPOS command. Thanks https://github.com/jettify.
  * Fixed a bug when attempting to send large values to Redis in a Pipeline.
- Update to version 2.10.1
  * Fixed a bug where Sentinel connections to a server that's no longer a
    master and receives a READONLY error will disconnect and reconnect to
    the master.
- Update to version 2.10.0
  * Discontinuted support for Python 2.5. Upgrade. You'll be happier.
  * The HiRedis parser will now properly raise ConnectionErrors.
  * Completely refactored PubSub support. Fixes all known PubSub bugs and
    adds a bunch of new features. Docs can be found in the README under the
    new "Publish / Subscribe" section.
  * Added the new HyperLogLog commanads (PFADD, PFCOUNT, PFMERGE). Thanks
    Pepijn de Vos and Vincent Ohprecio.
  * Updated TTL and PTTL commands with Redis 2.8+ semantics. Thanks Markus
    Kaiserswerth.
  * *SCAN commands now return a long (int on Python3) cursor value rather
    than the string representation. This might be slightly backwards
    incompatible in code using *SCAN commands loops such as
    "while cursor != '0':".
  * Added extra *SCAN commands that return iterators instead of the normal
    [cursor, data] type. Use scan_iter, hscan_iter, sscan_iter, and
    zscan_iter for iterators. Thanks Mathieu Longtin.
  * Added support for SLOWLOG commands. Thanks Rick van Hattem.
  * Added lexicographical commands ZRANGEBYLEX, ZREMRANGEBYLEX, and ZLEXCOUNT
    for sorted sets.
  * Connection objects now support an optional argument, socket_read_size,
    indicating how much data to read during each socket.recv() call. After
    benchmarking, increased the default size to 64k, which dramatically
    improves performance when fetching large values, such as many results
    in a pipeline or a large (>1MB) string value.
  * Improved the pack_command and send_packed_command functions to increase
    performance when sending large (>1MB) values.
  * Sentinel Connections to master servers now detect when a READONLY error
    is encountered and disconnect themselves and all other active connections
    to the same master so that the new master can be discovered.
  * Fixed Sentinel state parsing on Python 3.
  * Added support for SENTINEL MONITOR, SENTINEL REMOVE, and SENTINEL SET
    commands. Thanks Greg Murphy.
  * INFO ouput that doesn't follow the "key:value" format will now be
    appended to a key named "__raw__" in the INFO dictionary. Thanks Pedro
    Larroy.
  * The "vagrant" directory contains a complete vagrant environment for
    redis-py developers. The environment runs a Redis master, a Redis slave,
    and 3 Sentinels. Future iterations of the test sutie will incorporate
    more integration style tests, ensuring things like failover happen
    correctly.
  * It's now possible to create connection pool instances from a URL.
    StrictRedis.from_url() now uses this feature to create a connection pool
    instance and use that when creating a new client instance. Thanks
    https://github.com/chillipino
  * When creating client instances or connection pool instances from an URL,
    it's now possible to pass additional options to the connection pool with
    querystring arguments.
  * Fixed a bug where some encodings (like utf-16) were unusable on Python 3
    as command names and literals would get encoded.
  * Added an SSLConnection class that allows for secure connections through
    stunnel or other means. Construct and SSL connection with the sll=True
    option on client classes, using the rediss:// scheme from an URL, or
    by passing the SSLConnection class to a connection pool's
    connection_class argument. Thanks https://github.com/oranagra.
  * Added a socket_connect_timeout option to control how long to wait while
    establishing a TCP connection before timing out. This lets the client
    fail fast when attempting to connect to a downed server while keeping
    a more lenient timeout for all other socket operations.
  * Added TCP Keep-alive support by passing use the socket_keepalive=True
    option. Finer grain control can be achieved using the
    socket_keepalive_options option which expects a dictionary with any of
    the keys (socket.TCP_KEEPIDLE, socket.TCP_KEEPCNT, socket.TCP_KEEPINTVL)
    and integers for values. Thanks Yossi Gottlieb.
  * Added a `retry_on_timeout` option that controls how socket.timeout errors
    are handled. By default it is set to False and will cause the client to
    raise a TimeoutError anytime a socket.timeout is encountered. If
    `retry_on_timeout` is set to True, the client will retry a command that
    timed out once like other `socket.error`s.
  * Completely refactored the Lock system. There is now a LuaLock class
    that's used when the Redis server is capable of running Lua scripts along
    with a fallback class for Redis servers < 2.6. The new locks fix several
    subtle race consider that the old lock could face. In additional, a
    new method, "extend" is available on lock instances that all a lock
    owner to extend the amount of time they have the lock for. Thanks to
    Eli Finkelshteyn and https://github.com/chillipino for contributions.
- Update to version 2.9.1
  * IPv6 support. Thanks https://github.com/amashinchi
- Update to version 2.9.0
  * Performance improvement for packing commands when using the PythonParser.
    Thanks Guillaume Viot.
  * Executing an empty pipeline transaction no longer sends MULTI/EXEC to
    the server. Thanks EliFinkelshteyn.
  * Errors when authenticating (incorrect password) and selecting a database
    now close the socket.
  * Full Sentinel support thanks to Vitja Makarov. Thanks!
  * Better repr support for client and connection pool instances. Thanks
    Mark Roberts.
  * Error messages that the server sends to the client are now included
    in the client error message. Thanks Sangjin Lim.
  * Added the SCAN, SSCAN, HSCAN, and ZSCAN commands. Thanks Jingchao Hu.
  * ResponseErrors generated by pipeline execution provide addition context
    including the position of the command in the pipeline and the actual
    command text generated the error.
  * ConnectionPools now play nicer in threaded environments that fork. Thanks
    Christian Joergensen.

  * Fixed a bug introduced in 2.7.5 that prevented a ConnectionError from
    being raised when the Redis server is LOADING data.
  * Added a BusyLoadingError exception that's raised when the Redis server
    is starting up and not accepting commands yet. BusyLoadingError
    subclasses ConnectionError, which this state previously returned.
    Thanks Yossi Gottlieb.
- Changes in 2.7.5:
  * DEL, HDEL and ZREM commands now return the numbers of keys deleted
    instead of just True/False.
  * from_url now supports URIs with a port number. Thanks Aaron Westendorf.
- Changes in 2.7.4:
  * Added missing INCRBY method. Thanks Krzysztof Dorosz.
  * SET now accepts the EX, PX, NX and XX options from Redis 2.6.12. These
    options will generate errors if these options are used when connected
    to a Redis server < 2.6.12. Thanks George Yoshida.
- Changes in 2.7.3:
  * Fixed a bug with BRPOPLPUSH and lists with empty strings.
  * All empty except: clauses have been replaced to only catch Exception
    subclasses. This prevents a KeyboardInterrupt from triggering exception
    handlers. Thanks Lucian Branescu Mihaila.
  * All exceptions that are the result of redis server errors now share a
    command Exception subclass, ServerError. Thanks Matt Robenolt.
  * Prevent DISCARD from being called if MULTI wasn't also called. Thanks
    Pete Aykroyd.
  * SREM now returns an integer indicating the number of items removed from
    the set. Thanks http://github.com/ronniekk.
  * Fixed a bug with BGSAVE and BGREWRITEAOF response callbacks with Python3.
    Thanks Nathan Wan.
  * Added CLIENT GETNAME and CLIENT SETNAME commands.
    Thanks http://github.com/bitterb.
  * It's now possible to use len() on a pipeline instance to determine the
    number of commands that will be executed. Thanks Jon Parise.
  * Fixed a bug in INFO's parse routine with floating point numbers. Thanks
    Ali Onur Uyar.
  * Fixed a bug with BITCOUNT to allow `start` and `end` to both be zero.
    Thanks Tim Bart.
  * The transaction() method now accepts a boolean keyword argument,
    value_from_callable. By default, or if False is passes, the transaction()
    method will return the value of the pipelines execution. Otherwise, it
    will return whatever func() returns.
  * Python3 compatibility fix ensuring we're not already bytes(). Thanks
    Salimane Adjao Moustapha.
  * Added PSETEX. Thanks YAMAMOTO Takashi.
  * Added a BlockingConnectionPool to limit the number of connections that
    can be created. Thanks James Arthur.
  * SORT now accepts a `groups` option that if specified, will return
    tuples of n-length, where n is the number of keys specified in the GET
    argument. This allows for convenient row-based iteration. Thanks
    Ionuț Arțăriși.
- Changes in 2.7.2:
  * Parse errors are now *always* raised on multi/exec pipelines, regardless
    of the `raise_on_error` flag. See
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/redis-db/VUiEFT8U8U0
    for more info.
- Changes in 2.7.1:
  * Packaged tests with source code
- Changes in 2.7.0:
  * Added BITOP and BITCOUNT commands. Thanks Mark Tozzi.
  * Added the TIME command. Thanks Jason Knight.
  * Added support for LUA scripting. Thanks to Angus Peart, Drew Smathers,
    Issac Kelly, Louis-Philippe Perron, Sean Bleier, Jeffrey Kaditz, and
    Dvir Volk for various patches and contributions to this feature.
  * Changed the default error handling in pipelines. By default, the first
    error in a pipeline will now be raised. A new parameter to the
    pipeline's execute, `raise_on_error`, can be set to False to keep the
    old behavior of embeedding the exception instances in the result.
  * Fixed a bug with pipelines where parse errors won't corrupt the
    socket.
  * Added the optional `number` argument to SRANDMEMBER for use with
    Redis 2.6+ servers.
  * Added PEXPIRE/PEXPIREAT/PTTL commands. Thanks Luper Rouch.
  * Added INCRBYFLOAT/HINCRBYFLOAT commands. Thanks Nikita Uvarov.
  * High precision floating point values won't lose their precision when
    being sent to the Redis server. Thanks Jason Oster and Oleg Pudeyev.
  * Added CLIENT LIST/CLIENT KILL commands

- Update to 2.6.2:
  * `from_url` is now available as a classmethod on client classes. Thanks
    Jon Parise for the patch.
  * Fixed several encoding errors resulting from the Python 3.x support.
- Changes in 2.6.1:
  * Python 3.x support! Big thanks to Alex Grönholm.
  * Fixed a bug in the PythonParser's read_response that could hide an error
    from the client (#251).
- Changes in 2.6.0:
  * Changed (p)subscribe and (p)unsubscribe to no longer return messages
    indicating the channel was subscribed/unsubscribed to. These messages
    are available in the listen() loop instead. This is to prevent the
    following scenario:
      * Client A is subscribed to "foo"
      * Client B publishes message to "foo"
      * Client A subscribes to channel "bar" at the same time.
    Prior to this change, the subscribe() call would return the published
    messages on "foo" rather than the subscription confirmation to "bar".
  * Added support for GETRANGE, thanks Jean-Philippe Caruana
  * A new setting "decode_responses" specifies whether return values from
    Redis commands get decoded automatically using the client's charset
    value. Thanks to Frankie Dintino for the patch.

- Update to 2.4.13:
  * redis.from_url() can take an URL representing a Redis connection string
      and return a client object. Thanks Kenneth Reitz for the patch.
- Changes in 2.4.12:
  * ConnectionPool is now fork-safe. Thanks Josiah Carson for the patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 01:15:02 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.4.11:
  * AuthenticationError will now be correctly raised if an invalid password
    is supplied.
  * If Hiredis is unavailable, the HiredisParser will raise a RedisError
    if selected manually.
  * Made the INFO command more tolerant of Redis changes formatting. Fix
    for #217.
- Aditional changes from 2.4.10:
  * Buffer reads from socket in the PythonParser. Fix for a Windows-specific
    bug (#205).
  * Added the OBJECT and DEBUG OBJECT commands.
  * Added __del__ methods for classes that hold on to resources that need to
    be cleaned up. This should prevent resource leakage when these objects
    leave scope due to misuse or unhandled exceptions. Thanks David Wolever
    for the suggestion.
  * Added the ECHO command for completeness.
  * Fixed a bug where attempting to subscribe to a PubSub channel of a Redis
    server that's down would blow out the stack. Fixes #179 and #195. Thanks
    Ovidiu Predescu for the test case.
  * StrictRedis's TTL command now returns a -1 when querying a key with no
    expiration. The Redis class continues to return None.
  * ZADD and SADD now return integer values indicating the number of items
    added. Thanks Homer Strong.
  * Renamed the base client class to StrictRedis, replacing ZADD and LREM in
    favor of their official argument order. The Redis class is now a subclass
    of StrictRedis, implementing the legacy redis-py implementations of ZADD
    and LREM. Docs have been updated to suggesting the use of StrictRedis.
  * SETEX in StrictRedis is now compliant with official Redis SETEX command.
    the name, value, time implementation moved to "Redis" for backwards
    compatability.

Fri Sep 23 12:12:39 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 2.4.9:
  * Removed socket retry logic in Connection. This is the responsbility of
    the caller to determine if the command is safe and can be retried. Thanks
    David Wolver.
  * Added some extra guards around various types of exceptions being raised
    when sending or parsing data. Thanks David Wolver and Denis Bilenko.
- See file CHANGES for previous versions...

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 15 12:43:07 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 2.2.4:
  * WARNING: Potential backwards incompatible change - Changed order of
    parameters of ZREVRANGEBYSCORE to match those of the actual Redis command.
    This is only backwards-incompatible if you were passing max and min via
    keyword args. If passing by normal args, nothing in user code should have
    to change.
  * Fixed INFO to properly parse the Redis data correctly for both 2.2.x and
    2.3+. Thanks Stéphane Angel for the fix.
  * Lock objects now store their timeout value as a float.
  * WATCH now supports multiple keys.
  * Broke out some code that was Python 2.4 incompatible. redis-py should
    now be useable on 2.4, but this hasn't actually been tested. Thanks
    Dan Colish for the patch.
  * Optimized some code using izip and islice.
  * Better error handling 
  * Subscription status is now reset after every (re)connection.
- Added spec file license header
