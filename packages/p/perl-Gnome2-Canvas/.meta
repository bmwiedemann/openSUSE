  <title>Gnome2-Canvas Perl module</title>
  <description>The Gnome2::Canvas module allows a perl developer to use the GnomeCanvas
widget with Gtk2-Perl.  Find out more about Gnome+ at http://www.gnome.org.

Like the Gtk2 module on which it depends, Gnome2::Canvas follows the C API
of libgnomecanvas-2.0 as closely as possible while still being perlish.
Thus, the C API reference remains the canonical documentation.

To discuss gtk2-perl, ask questions and flame/praise the authors,
join gtk-perl-list@gnome.org at lists.gnome.org.

Also have a look at the gtk2-perl website and sourceforge project page,
