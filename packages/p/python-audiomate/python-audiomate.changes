- reenable python 3.11 build (numba available now) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  4 10:01:54 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Skip python311, python-numba doesn't support python 3.11 yet.

Fri May 28 02:48:24 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Do not build for Python 3.6, due to no NumPy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 14:21:44 UTC 2020 - Marketa Machova <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 6.0.0
  * Drop support of Python 3.5 because a required dependency (llvmlite) 
    does not support it anymore.
  * Setup consistent way for logging. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  7 11:24:08 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 5.0.2
  * Many new features and performance improvements, see upstream changelog
  Breaking:
  * Changed :class:`audiomate.corpus.validation.InvalidItemsResult' 
    to use it not only for Utterances, but also for Tracks for example.
  * Refactoring and addition of splitting functions in the 
    :class:`audiomate.corpus.subset.Splitter`.
  * For utterances and labels -1 was used for representing that the end 
    is the same as the end of the parent utterance/track. In order to 
    prevent -1 checks in different methods/places float('inf') is now used. 
    This makes it easier to implement stuff like label overlapping.
  * :class:`audiomate.annotations.LabelList` is now backed by an interval-tree 
    instead of a simple list. Therefore the labels have no fixed order anymore. 
    The interval-tree provides functionality for operations like merging, 
    splitting, finding overlaps with much lower code complexity.
  * Removed module :mod:`audiomate.annotations.label_cleaning`, since those 
    methods are available on :class:`audiomate.annotations.LabelList` directly.

- Update to 3.0.0
  + Breaking Changes
    * Moved label-encoding to its own module (audiomate.encoding). It now provides the processing of full corpora and store it in containers.
    * Moved audiomate.feeding.PartitioningFeatureIterator to the audiomate.feeding module.
    * Added audiomate.containers.AudioContainer to store audio tracks in a single file. All container classes are now in a separate module audiomate.containers.
    * Corpus now contains Tracks not Files anymore. This makes it possible to different kinds of audio sources. Audio from a file is now included using audiomate.tracks.FileTrack. New is the audiomate.tracks.ContainerTrack, which reads data stored in a container.
    * The audiomate.corpus.io.DefaultReader and the audiomate.corpus.io.DefaultWriter now load and store tracks, that are stored in a container.
    * All functionality regarding labels was moved to its own module audiomate.annotations.
    * The class audiomate.tracks.Utterance was moved to the tracks module.
  + New Features
    * Introducing the audiomate.feeding module. It provides different tools for accessing container data. Via a audiomate.feeding.Dataset data can be accessed by indices. With a audiomate.feeding.DataIterator one can easily iterate over data, such as frames.
    * Added processing steps for computing Onset-Strength (audiomate.processing.pipeline.OnsetStrength)) and Tempogram (audiomate.processing.pipeline.Tempogram)).
    * Introduced audiomate.corpus.validation module, that is used to validate a corpus.
    * Added reader (audiomate.corpus.io.SWCReader) for the SWC corpus. But it only works for the prepared corpus.
    * Added function (audiomate.corpus.utils.label_cleaning.merge_consecutive_labels_with_same_values()) for merging consecutive labels with the same value
    * Added downloader (audiomate.corpus.io.GtzanDownloader) for the GTZAN Music/Speech.
    * Added audiomate.corpus.assets.Label.tokenized() to get a list of tokens from a label. It basically splits the value and trims whitespace.
    * Added methods on audiomate.corpus.CorpusView, audiomate.corpus.assets.Utterance and audiomate.corpus.assets.LabelList to get a set of occurring tokens.
    * Added audiomate.encoding.TokenOrdinalEncoder to encode labels of an utterance by mapping every token of the label to a number.
    * Create container base class (audiomate.corpus.assets.Container), that can be used to store arbitrary data per utterance. The audiomate.corpus.assets.FeatureContainer is now an extension of the container, that provides functionality especially for features.
    * Added functions to split utterances and label-lists into multiple parts. (audiomate.corpus.assets.Utterance.split(), audiomate.corpus.assets.LabelList.split())
    * Added audiomate.processing.pipeline.AddContext to add context to frames, using previous and subsequent frames.
    * Added reader (audiomate.corpus.io.MailabsReader) and downloader (audiomate.corpus.io.MailabsDownloader) for the M-AILABS Speech Dataset.
  + Fixes
    * [#58] Keep track of number of samples per frame and between frames. Now the correct values will be stored in a Feature-Container, if the processor implements it correctly.
    * [#72] Fix bug, when reading samples from utterance, using a specific duration, while the utterance end is not defined.
