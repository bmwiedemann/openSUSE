%description
*Archive::Tar::Wrapper* is an API wrapper around the 'tar' command line
program. It never stores anything in memory, but works on temporary
directory structures on disk instead. It provides a mapping between the
logical paths in the tarball and the 'real' files in the temporary
directory on disk.

It differs from Archive::Tar in two ways:

  * *Archive::Tar::Wrapper* almost doesn't hold anything in memory (see 'write'
method), instead using disk as storage.

  * *Archive::Tar::Wrapper* is 100% compliant with the platform's 'tar' utility
because it uses it internally.
