%description
Skip test scripts if modules are not available. The requested modules will
be loaded, and optionally have their versions checked. If the module is
missing, the test script will be skipped. Modules that are found but fail
to compile will exit with an error rather than skip.

If used in a subtest, the remainder of the subtest will be skipped.

Skipping will work even if some tests have already been run, or if a plan
has been declared.

Versions are checked via a '$module->VERSION($wanted_version)' call.
Versions must be provided in a format that will be accepted. No extra
processing is done on them.

If 'perl' is used as a module, the version is checked against the running
perl version ($]). The version can be specified as a number, dotted-decimal
string, v-string, or version object.

If the 'RELEASE_TESTING' environment variable is set, the tests will fail
rather than skip. Subtests will be aborted, but the test script will
continue running after that point.
