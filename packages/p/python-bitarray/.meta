  <title>Efficient Arrays of Booleans</title>
  <description>This module provides an object type which efficiently represents an
array of booleans.  Bitarrays are sequence types and behave very
much like usual lists. Eight bits are represented by one byte in a
contiguous block of memory. The user can select between two
representations; little-endian and big-endian.
All of the functionality is implemented in C. Methods for accessing
the machine representation are provided.  This can be useful when
bit level access to binary files is required, such as portable
bitmap image files (.pbm).
Also, when dealing with compressed data which uses variable bit
length encoding, you may find this module useful.
