  <title>perl-Test-Alien-CPP - Testing tools for Alien modules for projects that use C++</title>
  <description>This module works exactly like Test::Alien except that it supports C++. All functions like 'alien_ok', etc that are exported by Test::Alien are exported by this module. The only difference is that 'xs_ok' injects C++ support before delegating to Test::Alien.
