Sun Aug  2 15:14:47 UTC 2020 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Add optional test dependencies
- Recommend optional runtime dependency python-typing_extensions
- Remove unused runtime dependency ujson
- Update to v1.6.1
  * fix validation and parsing of nested models with default_factory
- from v1.6
  * Modify validators for conlist and conset to not have always=True
  * Add port check to AnyUrl (can't exceed 65536) ports are 16 insigned
    bits: 0 <= port <= 2**16-1 src: rfc793 header format
  * Document default regex anchoring semantics
  * Use chain.from_iterable in class_validators.py. This is a faster
    and more idiomatic way of using itertools.chain. Instead of computing
    all the items in the iterable and storing them in memory, they are
    computed one-by-one and never stored as a huge list.
    This can save on both runtime and memory space
  * Add conset(), analogous to conlist()
  * make pydantic errors (un)pickable
  * Allow custom encoding for dotenv files
  * Ensure SchemaExtraCallable is always defined to get type hints on BaseConfig
  * Update datetime parser to support negative timestamps
  * Update mypy, remove AnyType alias for Type[Any]
  * Adjust handling of root validators so that errors are aggregated
    from all failing root validators, instead of reporting on only
    the first root validator to fail
  * Make __modify_schema__ on Enums apply to the enum schema rather
    than fields that use the enum
  * Fix behavior of __all__ key when used in conjunction with index
    keys in advanced include/exclude of fields that are sequences
  * Subclass validators do not run when referencing a List field
    defined in a parent class when each_item=True
  * change schema.field_class_to_schema to support frozenset in schema
  * Call __modify_schema__ only for the field schema
  * Move the assignment of field.validate_always in fields.py so the
    always parameter of validators work on inheritance
  * Added support for UUID instantiation through 16 byte strings such
    as b'\x12\x34\x56\x78' * 4.
    This was done to support BINARY(16) columns in sqlalchemy
  * Add a test assertion that default_factory can return a singleton
  * Add NameEmail.__eq__ so duplicate NameEmail instances are
    evaluated as equal
  * Add datamodel-code-generator link in pydantic document site
  * Added a "Discussion of Pydantic" section to the documentation,
    with a link to "Pydantic Introduction" video
  * Avoid some side effects of default_factory by calling it only
    once if possible and by not setting a default value in the schema
  * Added docs about dumping dataclasses to JSON
  * Make BaseModel.__signature__ class-only, so getting __signature__
    from model instance will raise AttributeError
  * include 'format': 'password' in the schema for secret types
  * Modify schema constraints on ConstrainedFloat so that
    exclusiveMinimum and minimum are not included in the schema if
    they are equal to -math.inf and exclusiveMaximum and maximum are
    not included if they are equal to math.inf
  * Squash internal __root__ dicts in .dict() (and, by extension, in .json())
  * Move const validator to post-validators so it validates the parsed value
  * Fix model validation to handle nested literals
  * Remove user_required = True from RedisDsn, neither user nor
    password are required
  * Remove extra allOf from schema for fields with Union and custom Field
  * Updates OpenAPI schema generation to output all enums as separate
    models. Instead of inlining the enum values in the model schema,
    models now use a $ref property to point to the enum definition

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  9 19:24:27 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.5.1

Sat Apr 18 19:11:39 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.5
  * Make includes/excludes arguments for .dict(), ._iter(), ...,
    immutable

  * Confirm that shallow model.copy() does make a shallow copy of
    attributes

    attributes in mypy plugin

    when overriding __str__
  * Allow None as input to all optional list fields
  * Add datetime field to default_factory example
  * Allow subclasses of known types to be encoded with superclass
    encoder
  * Exclude exported fields from all elements of a list/tuple of
    submodels/dicts with '__all__', #1286 by @masalim2
  * Add pydantic.color.Color objects as available input for Color
    fields
  * In examples, type nullable fields as Optional, so that these
    are valid mypy annotations
  * Make pattern_validator() accept pre-compiled Pattern objects.
    Fix str_validator() return type to str
  * Support instance methods and class methods with
    @validate_arguments
  * Add default_factory argument to Field to create a dynamic
    default value by passing a zero-argument callable
  * add support for NewType of List, Optional, etc
  * fix mypy signature for root_validator
  * Fixed parsing of nested 'custom root type' models
  * Add validate_arguments function decorator which checks the
    arguments to a function matches type annotations
  * Add __signature__ to models
  * Refactor ._iter() method, 10x speed boost for dict(model)

    parent aliases, including using alias_generator

    priority over an alias from alias_generator
  * many more fixes and improvements
