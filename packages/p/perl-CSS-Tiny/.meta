  <title>Read/Write .css files with as little code as possible</title>
  <description>CSS::Tiny is a perl class to read and write .css stylesheets with as little
code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead. CSS.pm requires
about 2.6 meg or ram to load, which is a large amount of overhead if you
only want to do trivial things. Memory usage is normally scoffed at in
Perl, but in my opinion should be at least kept in mind.</description>
