        - Added Firebird support, thanks to Stefan Suciu.
        - Fixed SQLite savepoint support to properly detect SQlite versions 3.9
          and higher.
        - Restored MySQL savepoint testing when the DBICTEST_* environment
          variables are set.

        - Added versions to the RollbackError exception classes to make PAUSE
          happy.
  
  0.54  2016-02-05T18:52:44Z
        - Removeed the Pod tests from the distribution.
        - Fixed the example code for handling `rollback_error` exceptions in the
          documentation to properly wrap the transaction in an exception
          handler. Patch from Perlover (issue #32).
        - Improved handling of connection failures when RaiseError (or
          HandleError) is not set. Thanks to Andreas Huber for the report and
          fix.
        - Document that `$_` is set locally, not globally, in the methods that
          set it. Suggested by William Lindley.
        - The disconnect method no longer longer remove entries from the DBI
          handle's CachedKids attribute. That behavior appears to be a
          workaround for a database we don't (yet) support.
        - Fixed a test failure where the test system has the `$DBI_DSN` or
          `$DBI_DRIVER` environment variable set. Thanks to Erik Rijkers for the
          patch.
        - Added recommendation to use DBD::Pg 3.5.0 or later to the Pg driver.
          Earlier versions had an incorrect implementation of the `ping()`
          method (Issue #41).

- updated to upstream version 0.53

0.53  2013-03-20T06:04:34Z
      - Fixed some documentation typos, thanks to Mike O'Regan (Issue #22).
      - Fixed issue where an connection failure caused an unhelpful error
        (Issue #26).
 
0.52  2012-05-29T18:32:42Z
      - The DBI params are now encapsulated in a code reference, rather than
        stored as the passed array, so that the password is less likely to be
        displayed in a dump. Idea borrowed from Rose::DB. Patch from Brad
        Bowman.
      - Eliminated warning about the non-portability of a v-string on older
        Perls. Thanks to Mark Lawrence for the report (Issue #17).
      - Removed a couple of leftover examples of the feature removed
        in v0.50. Thanks to Randy Stauner for the patch!
      - Eliminated more "Use of qw(...) as parentheses" syntax errors in tests
        when running on Perl 5.17.
      - Add mention of DBI Callbacks parameter to the docs, as folks often ask
        for this functionality, not realizing that the DBI already provides
        it. Randy Stauner.
