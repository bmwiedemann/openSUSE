-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 12 18:18:46 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 4.28.3
  * [subset] Fixed bug while subsetting COLR table, whereby
    incomplete layer records pointing to missing glyphs were being
    retained leading to struct.error upon compiling. Make it so
    that glyf glyph closure, which follows the COLR glyph closure,
    does not influence the COLR table subsetting (#2461, #2462).
  * [docs] Fully document the cmap and glyf tables (#2454, #2457).
  * [colorLib.unbuilder] Fixed CLI by deleting no longer existing
    parameter (180bb1867).
- Release 4.28.2
  * [otlLib] Remove duplicates when building coverage (#2433).
  * [docs] Add interrogate configuration (#2443).
  * [docs] Remove comment about missing “start” optional argument
    to calcChecksum (#2448).
  * [cu2qu/cli] Adapt to the latest ufoLib2.
  * [subset] Support subsetting SVG table and remove it from the
    list of drop by default tables (#534).
  * [subset] add --pretty-svg option to pretty print SVG table
    contents (#2452).
  * [merge] Support merging CFF tables (CID-keyed CFF is still not
    supported) (#2447).
  * [merge] Support --output-file (#2447).
  * [docs] Split table docs into individual pages (#2444).
  * [feaLib] Forbid empty classes (#2446).
  * [docs] Improve documentation for fontTools.ttLib.ttFont
    (#2442).
- Release 4.28.1
  * [subset] Fixed AttributeError while traversing a color glyph's
    Paint graph when there is no LayerList, which is optional
    (#2441).
- Release 4.28.0
  * Dropped support for EOL Python 3.6, require Python 3.7 (#2417).
  * [ufoLib/glifLib] Make filename-clash checks faster by using a
    set instead of a list (#2422).
  * [subset] Don't crash if optional ClipList and LayerList are
    None (empty) (#2424, 2439).
  * [OT-SVG] Removed support for old deprecated version 1 and
    embedded color palettes, which were never officially part of
    the OpenType SVG spec. Upon compile, reuse offsets to SVG
    documents that are identical (#2430).
  * [feaLib] Added support for Variable Feature File syntax. This
    is experimental and subject to change until it is finalized in
    the Adobe FEA spec (#2432).
  * [unicodedata] Update Scripts/ScriptExtensions/Blocks to
    UnicodeData 14.0 (#2437).
- Release 4.27.1
  * [otlLib] Fixed error when chained contextual lookup builder
    overflows (#2404, #2411).
  * [bezierTools] Fixed two floating-point bugs: one when computing
    t for a point lying on an almost horizontal/vertical line;
    another when computing the intersection point between a curve
    and a line (#2413).
- Release 4.27.0
  * [ttLib/otTables] Cleaned up virtual GID handling: allow virtual
    GIDs in Coverage and ClassDef readers; removed unused allowVID
    argument from TTFont constructor, and requireReal argument in
    TTFont.getGlyphID method. Make TTFont.setGlyphOrder clear
    reverse glyphOrder map, and assume glyphOrder internal
    attribute is never modified outside setGlyphOrder; added
    TTFont.getGlyphNameMany and getGlyphIDMany (#1536, #1654,
    #2334, #2398).
  * [py23] Dropped internal use of fontTools.py23 module to fix
    deprecation warnings in client code that imports from fontTools
    (#2234, #2399, #2400).
  * [subset] Fix subsetting COLRv1 clip boxes when font is loaded
    lazily (#2408).
- Release 4.26.2
  * [otTables] Added missing CompositeMode.PLUS operator (#2390).
- Release 4.26.1
  * [transform] Added transformVector and transformVectors methods
    to the Transform class. Similar to transformPoint but ignore
    the translation part (#2386).
- Release 4.26.0
  * [xmlWriter] Default to "\n" for newlinestr instead of
    platform-specific os.linesep (#2384).
  * [otData] Define COLRv1 ClipList and ClipBox (#2379).
  * [removeOverlaps/instancer] Added --ignore-overlap-errors option
    to work around Skia PathOps.Simplify bug (#2382, #2363,
    google/fonts#3365).
  * NOTE: This will be the last version to support Python 3.6.
    FontTools will require Python 3.7 or above from the next
    release (#2350)
- Release 4.25.2
  * [COLRv1] Various changes to sync with the latest CORLv1 draft
    spec. In particular: define COLR.VarIndexMap, remove/inline
    ColorIndex struct, add VarIndexBase to PaintVar* tables
    (#2372); add reduced-precicion specialized transform Paints;
    define Angle as fraction of half circle encoded as F2Dot14; use
    FWORD (int16) for all Paint center coordinates; change
    PaintTransform to have an offset to Affine2x3;
  * [ttLib] when importing XML, only set sfntVersion if the font
    has no reader and is empty (#2376)
- Release 4.25.1
  * [ttGlyphPen] Fixed bug in TTGlyphPointPen, whereby open
    contours (i.e. starting with segmentType "move") would throw
    NotImplementedError. They are now treated as if they are
    closed, like with the TTGlyphPen (#2364, #2366).
- Release 4.25.0
  * [tfmLib] Added new library for parsing TeX Font Metric (TFM)
    files (#2354).
  * [TupleVariation] Make shared tuples order deterministic on
    python < 3.7 where Counter (subclass of dict) doesn't remember
    insertion order (#2351, #2353).
  * [otData] Renamed COLRv1 structs to remove 'v1' suffix and match
    the updated draft spec: 'LayerV1List' -> 'LayerList',
    'BaseGlyphV1List' -> 'BaseGlyphList', 'BaseGlyphV1Record' ->
    'BaseGlyphPaintRecord' (#2346). Added 8 new PaintScale* tables:
    with/without centers, uniform vs non-uniform. Added
    *AroundCenter variants to PaintRotate and PaintSkew: the
    default versions no longer have centerX/Y, but default to
    origin. PaintRotate, PaintSkew and PaintComposite formats were
    re-numbered. NOTE: these are breaking changes; clients using
    the experimental COLRv1 API will have to be updated (#2348).
  * [pointPens] Allow GuessSmoothPointPen to accept a tolerance.
    Fixed call to math.atan2 with x/y parameters inverted. Sync the
    code with fontPens (#2344).
  * [post] Fixed parsing post table format 2.0 when it contains
    extra garbage at the end of the stringData array (#2314).
  * [subset] drop empty features unless 'size' with FeatureParams
    table (#2324).
  * [otlLib] Added otlLib.optimize module; added GPOS compaction
    algorithm. The compaction can be run on existing fonts with
    fonttools otlLib.optimize or using the snippet compact_gpos.py.
    There's experimental support for compacting fonts at
    compilation time using an environment variable, but that might
    be removed later (#2326).
- Release 4.24.4
  * [subset/instancer] Fixed AttributeError when instantiating a VF
    that contains GPOS ValueRecords with Device tables but without
    the respective non-Device values (e.g. XAdvDevice without
    XAdvance). When not explicitly set, the latter are assumed to
    be 0 (#2323).
- Release 4.24.3
  * [otTables] Fixed AttributeError in methods that split
    LigatureSubst, MultipleSubst and AlternateSubst subtables when
    an offset overflow occurs. The Format attribute was removed in
    v4.22.0 (#2319).
- Release 4.24.2
  * [ttGlyphPen] Fixed typing annotation of TTGlyphPen glyphSet
    parameter (#2315).
  * Fixed two instances of DeprecationWarning: invalid escape
    sequence (#2311).
- Release 4.24.1
  * [subset] Fixed AttributeError when SinglePos subtable has None
    Value (ValueFormat 0) (#2312, #2313).
- Release 4.24.0
  * [pens] Add ttGlyphPen.TTGlyphPointPen similar to TTGlyphPen
    (#2205).
- Release 4.23.1
  * [subset] Fix KeyError after subsetting COLR table that
    initially contains both v0 and v1 color glyphs when the subset
    only requested v1 glyphs; we were not pruning the v0 portion of
    the table (#2308).
  * [colorLib] Set LayerV1List attribute to None when empty, it's
    optional in CORLv1 (#2308).
- Release 4.23.0
  * [designspaceLib] Allow to use \\UNC absolute paths on Windows
    (#2299, #2306).
  * [varLib.merger] Fixed bug where VarLibMergeError was raised
    with incorrect parameters (#2300).
  * [feaLib] Allow substituting a glyph class with NULL to delete
    multiple glyphs (#2303).
  * [glyf] Fixed NameError exception in getPhantomPoints (#2295,
    #2305).
  * [removeOverlaps] Retry pathops.simplify after rounding path
    coordinates to integers if it fails the first time using
    floats, to work around a rare and hard to debug Skia bug
    (#2288).
  * [varLib] Added support for building, reading, writing and
    optimizing 32-bit ItemVariationStore as used in COLRv1 table
    (#2285).
  * [otBase/otConverters] Add array readers/writers for int types
    (#2285).
  * [feaLib] Allow more than one lookahead glyph/class in
    contextual positioning with "value at end" (#2293, #2294).
  * [COLRv1] Default varIdx should be 0xFFFFFFFF (#2297, #2298).
  * [pens] Make RecordingPointPen actually pass on identifiers;
    replace asserts with explicit PenError exception (#2284).
  * [mutator] Round lsb for CF2 fonts as well (#2286).
- Release 4.22.1
  * [feaLib] Skip references to named lookups if the lookup block
    definition is empty, similarly to makeotf. This also fixes an
    AttributeError while generating aalt feature (#2276, #2277).
  * [subset] Fixed bug with --no-hinting implementation for Device
    tables (#2272, #2275). The previous code was alwyas dropping
    Device tables if no-hinting was requested, but some Device
    tables (DeltaFormat=0x8000) are also used to encode variation
    indices and need to be retained.
  * [otBase] Fixed bug in getting the ValueRecordSize when
    decompiling MVAR table with lazy=True (#2273, #2274).
  * [varLib/glyf/gvar] Optimized and simplified GlyphCoordinates
    and TupleVariation classes, use bytearray where possible,
    refactored phantom-points calculations. We measured about 30%
    speedup in total time of loading master ttfs, building gvar,
    and saving (#2261, #2266).
  * [subset] Fixed AssertionError while pruning unused CPAL
    palettes when 0xFFFF is present (#2257, #2259).
- Release 4.22.0
  * [ttLib] Remove .Format from Coverage, ClassDef, SingleSubst,
    LigatureSubst, AlternateSubst, MultipleSubst (#2238).
    ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!
  * [misc.arrayTools] move Vector to its own submodule, and rewrite
    as a tuple subclass (#2201).
  * [docs] Added a terminology section for varLib (#2209).
  * [varLib] Move rounding to VariationModel, to avoid error
    accumulation from multiple deltas (#2214)
  * [varLib] Explain merge errors in more human-friendly terms
    (#2223, #2226)
  * [otlLib] Correct some documentation (#2225)
  * [varLib/otlLib] Allow merging into VariationFont without first
    saving GPOS PairPos2 (#2229)
  * [subset] Improve PairPosFormat2 subsetting (#2221)
  * [ttLib] TTFont.save: create file on disk as late as possible
    (#2253)
  * [cffLib] Add missing CFF2 dict operators LanguageGroup and
    ExpansionFactor (#2249) ATTENTION: This will change your TTX
    dumps! 
- Support for python36 has been dropped

  the test fonts.
- The `fonttools` command is now documented and tested in the test
  suite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  1 22:01:14 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Release 4.21.1
  * [pens] Reverted breaking change that turned AbstractPen and
    AbstractPointPen into abstract base classes (#2164, #2198).
- Release 4.21.0
  * [feaLib] Indent anchor statements in asFea() to make them more
    legible and diff-able (#2193).
  * [pens] Turn AbstractPen and AbstractPointPen into abstract
    base classes (#2164).
  * [feaLib] Added support for parsing and building STAT table
    from AFDKO feature files (#2039).
  * [instancer] Added option to update name table of generated
    instance using STAT table's axis values (#2189).
  * [bezierTools] Added functions to compute bezier point-at-time,
    as well as line-line, curve-line and curve-curve intersections
    (#2192).
  * [arrayTools] Added rectArea function to compute area of
    rectangle (#2192).
- Release 4.20.0
  * [COLRv1] Added unbuildColrV1 to deconstruct COLRv1 otTables to
    raw json-able data structure; it does the reverse of
    buildColrV1 (#2171).
  * [feaLib] Allow sub X by NULL sequence to delete a glyph (#2170)
  * [arrayTools] Fixed Vector division (#2173).
  * [COLRv1] Define new PaintSweepGradient (#2172).
  * [otTables] Moved Paint.Format enum class outside of Paint
    class definition, now named PaintFormat. It was clashing with
    paint instance Format attribute and thus was breaking lazy
    load of COLR table which relies on magic __getattr__ (#2175).
  * [COLRv1] Replace hand-coded builder functions with
    otData-driven dynamic implementation (#2181).
  * [COLRv1] Define additional static (non-variable) Paint formats
    (#2181).

    designspaceLib.AxisDescriptor objects. Added new setupAvar
    method. Support localised names for axes and named instances
    (#2185).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 23 14:28:25 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- We do Require fs module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 13:48:21 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 4.19.1
  * [woff2] An initial off-curve point with an overlap flag now
    stays an off-curve point after compression.
- Changes in 4.19.0
  * [codecs] Handle errors parameter different from 'strict' for
    the custom extended mac encodings (#2137, #2132).
  * [featureVars] Raise better error message when a script is
    missing the required default language system (#2154).
  * [COLRv1] Avoid abrupt change caused by rounding
    PaintRadialGradient.c0 when the start circle almost touches
    the end circle's perimeter (#2148).
  * [COLRv1] Support building unlimited lists of paints as 255-ary
    trees of PaintColrLayers tables (#2153).
  * [subset] Prune redundant format-12 cmap subtables when all
    non-BMP characters are dropped (#2146).
  * [basePen] Raise MissingComponentError instead of bare KeyError
    when a referenced component is missing (#2145).
- Only 'Recommend:' optional extra requirements (Some are not
  available in TW python36 flavor anymore)
- Don't require python36-scipy for testing. (NEP 29)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 14 16:26:38 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.18.2:
  - [COLRv1] Implemented ``PaintTranslate`` paint format (#2129).
  - [varLib.cff] Fixed unbound local variable error (#1787).
  - [otlLib] Don't crash when creating OpenType class definitions if some glyphs
    occur more than once (#2125).
  - [colorLib] Speed optimization for ``LayerV1ListBuilder`` (#2119).
  - [mutator] Fixed missing tab in ``interpolate_cff2_metrics`` (0957dc7a).
  - [COLRv1] Update to latest draft: added ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew`` (#2118).
  - [woff2] Support new ``brotlicffi`` bindings for PyPy (#2117).
  - [glifLib] Added ``expectContentsFile`` parameter to ``GlyphSet``, for use when
    reading existing UFOs, to comply with the specification stating that a
    ``contents.plist`` file must exist in a glyph set (#2114).
  - [subset] Allow ``LangSys`` tags in ``--layout-scripts`` option (#2112). For example:
    ``--layout-scripts=arab.dflt,arab.URD,latn``; this will keep ``DefaultLangSys``
    and ``URD`` language for ``arab`` script, and all languages for ``latn`` script.
  - [varLib.interpolatable] Allow UFOs to be checked; report open paths, non existant
    glyphs; add a ``--json`` option to produce a machine-readable list of
    incompatibilities
  - [pens] Added ``QuartzPen`` to create ``CGPath`` from glyph outlines on macOS.
    Requires pyobjc (#2107).
  - [feaLib] You can export ``FONTTOOLS_LOOKUP_DEBUGGING=1`` to enable feature file
    debugging info stored in ``Debg`` table (#2106).
  - [otlLib] Build more efficient format 1 and format 2 contextual lookups whenever
    possible (#2101).
  - [colorLib] Fixed regression in 4.17.0 when building COLR v0 table; when color
    layers are stored in UFO lib plist, we can't distinguish tuples from lists so
    we need to accept either types (e5439eb9, googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues#426).
  - [colorLib/otData] Updated to latest draft ``COLR`` v1 spec (#2092).
  - [svgLib] Fixed parsing error when arc commands' boolean flags are not separated
    by space or comma (#2094).
  - [varLib] Interpret empty non-default glyphs as 'missing', if the default glyph is
    not empty (#2082).
  - [feaLib.builder] Only stash lookup location for ``Debg`` if ``Builder.buildLookups_``
    has cooperated (#2065, #2067).
  - [varLib] Fixed bug in VarStore optimizer (#2073, #2083).
  - [varLib] Add designspace lib key for custom feavar feature tag (#2080).
  - Add HashPointPen adapted from psautohint. With this pen, a hash value of a glyph
    can be computed, which can later be used to detect glyph changes (#2005).
  - [varLib.instancer] Fixed ``TypeError`` exception when instantiating a VF with
    a GSUB table 1.1 in which ``FeatureVariations`` attribute is present but set to
    ``None`` -- indicating that optional ``FeatureVariations`` is missing (#2077).
  - [glifLib] Make ``x`` and ``y`` attributes of the ``point`` element required
    even when validation is turned off, and raise a meaningful ``GlifLibError``
    message when that happens (#2075).
  - [removeOverlaps] Added new module and ``removeOverlaps`` function that merges
    overlapping contours and components in TrueType glyphs. It requires the
    `skia-pathops <https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops>`__ module.
    Note that removing overlaps invalidates the TrueType hinting (#2068).
  - [varLib.instancer] Added ``--remove-overlaps`` command-line option.
    The ``overlap`` option in ``instantiateVariableFont`` now takes an ``OverlapMode``
    enum: 0: KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS, 1: KEEP_AND_SET_FLAGS (default), and 2: REMOVE.
    The latter is equivalent to calling ``removeOverlaps`` on the generated static
    instance. The option continues to accept ``bool`` value for backward compatibility.
  - [plistlib] Added typing annotations to plistlib module. Set up mypy static
    typechecker to run automatically on CI (#2061).
  - [ttLib] Implement private ``Debg`` table, a reverse-DNS namespaced JSON dict.
  - [feaLib] Optionally add an entry into the ``Debg`` table with the original
    lookup name (if any), feature name / script / language combination (if any),
    and original source filename and line location. Annotate the ttx output for
    a lookup with the information from the Debg table (#2052).
  - [sfnt] Disabled checksum checking by default in ``SFNTReader`` (#2058).
  - [Docs] Document ``mtiLib`` module (#2027).
  - [varLib.interpolatable] Added checks for contour node count and operation type
    of each node (#2054).
  - [ttLib] Added API to register custom table packer/unpacker classes (#2055).
  - [feaLib] Allow anonymous classes in LookupFlags definitions (#2037).
  - [Docs] Better document DesignSpace rules processing order (#2041).
  - [ttLib] Fixed 21-year old bug in ``maxp.maxComponentDepth`` calculation (#2044,
    #2045).
  - [varLib.models] Fixed misspelled argument name in CLI entry point (81d0042a).
  - [subset] When subsetting GSUB v1.1, fixed TypeError by checking whether the
    optional FeatureVariations table is present (e63ecc5b).
  - [Snippets] Added snippet to show how to decompose glyphs in a TTF (#2030).
  - [otlLib] Generate GSUB type 5 and GPOS type 7 contextual lookups where appropriate
    (#2016).
  - [feaLib/otlLib] Moved lookup subtable builders from feaLib to otlLib; refactored
    some common code (#2004, #2007).
  - [docs] Document otlLib module (#2009).
  - [glifLib] Fixed bug with some UFO .glif filenames clashing on case-insensitive
    filesystems (#2001, #2002).
  - [colorLib] Updated COLRv1 implementation following changes in the draft spec:
    (#2008, googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec#24).

    Only attempt to recovered malformed UTF  *16 data from a ``bytes`` string,
    not from unicode ``str`` (#1997, #1998).
  * [OS/2] Don't calculate whole sets of unicode codepoints, use faster and more memory
    efficient ranges and bisect lookups (#1984).
  * [voltLib] Support writing back abstract syntax tree as VOLT data (#1983).

- Upstream provided fix for the issue with big endian machines. Remove
  fonttools-disable_failing_tests_bigendian.patch and replace with
  349cd94d171cf4e1e7541884df0d12bb6d4e841a.patch
- Upstream fix has a missing import; thus fix-missing-sys.patch

- Update to version 3.24.1
  * [varLib] Don’t remap the same DeviceTable twice in VarStore
    optimizer (#1206).
  * [varLib] Add --disable-iup option to fonttools varLib script,
    and a optimize=True keyword argument to varLib.build function,
    to optionally disable IUP optimization while building varfonts.
  * [ttCollection] Fixed issue while decompiling ttc with python3
    (#1207).
- Update to version 3.24.0
  * [ttGlyphPen] Decompose composite glyphs if any components’
    transform is too large to fit a F2Dot14 value, or clamp
    transform values that are (almost) equal to +2.0 to make them
    fit and avoid decomposing (#1200, #1204, #1205).
  * [ttx] Added new -g option to dump glyphs from the glyf table
    splitted as individual ttx files (#153, #1035, #1132, #1202).
  * Copied ufoLib.filenames module to fontTools.misc.filenames,
    used for the ttx split-glyphs option (#1202).
  * [feaLib] Added support for cvParameters blocks in Character
    Variant feautures cv01-cv99 (#860, #1169).
  * [Snippets] Added checksum.py script to generate/check SHA1
    hash of ttx files (#1197).
  * [varLib.mutator] Fixed issue while instantiating some variable
    fonts whereby the horizontal advance width computed from gvar
    phantom points could turn up to be negative (#1198).
  * [varLib/subset] Fixed issue with subsetting GPOS variation
    data not picking up ValueRecord Device objects (54fd71f).
  * [feaLib/voltLib] In all AST elements, the location is no
    longer a required positional argument, but an optional
    kewyord argument (defaults to None). This will make it easier
    to construct feature AST from code (#1201).
- Update to version 3.23.0
  * [designspaceLib] Added an optional lib element to the
    designspace as a whole, as well as to the instance elements,
    to store arbitrary data in a property list dictionary, similar
    to the UFO’s lib. Added an optional font attribute to the
    SourceDescriptor, to allow operating on in-memory font objects
    (#1175).
  * [cffLib] Fixed issue with lazy-loading of attributes when
    attempting to set the CFF TopDict.Encoding (#1177, #1187).
  * [ttx] Fixed regression introduced in 3.22.0 that affected
    the split tables -s option (#1188).
  * [feaLib] Added IncludedFeaNotFound custom exception subclass,
    raised when an included feature file cannot be found (#1186).
  * [otTables] Changed VarIdxMap to use glyph names internally
    instead of glyph indexes. The old ttx dumps of HVAR/VVAR
    tables that contain indexes can still be imported
    (21cbab8, 38a0ffb).
  * [varLib] Implemented VarStore optimizer (#1184).
  * [subset] Implemented pruning of GDEF VarStore, HVAR and
    MVAR (#1179).
  * [sfnt] Restore backward compatiblity with numFonts attribute
    of SFNTReader object (#1181).
  * [merge] Initial support for merging LangSysRecords (#1180).
  * [ttCollection] don’t seek(0) when writing to possibly
    unseekable strems.
  * [subset] Keep all --name-IDs from 0 to 6 by default
    (#1170, #605, #114).
  * [cffLib] Added width module to calculate optimal CFF default
    and nominal glyph widths.
  * [varLib] Don’t fail if STAT already in the master fonts
    (#1166).
