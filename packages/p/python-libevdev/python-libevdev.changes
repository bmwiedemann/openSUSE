- Avoid usage of %{_libdir}: a noarch package cannot rely on libdir
  pointing to arch-specific packages. TWeak using
  %{_prefix}/lib*/libevdev.so to find the correct library package
  %name.

- BuildRequires on a binary library package is a bad idea as well
  as the required SOVER needs to be calculated.
