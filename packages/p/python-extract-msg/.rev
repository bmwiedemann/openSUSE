    <comment>- Make running the test suite verbose.

- Update to version 0.52.0
  * Fix typo in string that prevented HTML body from generating from
    the plain text body properly.
  * Adjusted the behavior of `MSGFile.areStringsUnicode` to prioritize
    the property specified by the parent MSG files for MSG files that
    are embedded. Additionally, added a fallback to rely on whether or
    not there is a stream using the `001F` type to determine the
    property value if it is entirely missing.
  * Adjusted `OleWriter.fromMsg()` and `MSGFile.export()` to add the
    argument `allowBadEmbed` which helps to correct a few different
    issues that may appear in embedded MSG files. These corrections
    allow the embedded file to still be extracted and to open properly
    in Outlook.
  * In addition to the above, the errors that some of those corrections
    will suppress are now significantly more informative about what went
    wrong.
- from version 0.51.1
  * Add class type added in last version to known class types.
- from version 0.51.0
  * Add basic support for MSG class type `IPM.SkypeTeams.Message`.
- from version 0.50.1
  * Fix bug introduced in previous version.
- from version 0.50.0
  * Adjust html header code to replace non-ascii characters with escaped versions.
    Also adjusted plain text to html conversion to ensure non-ascii character
    from the body are encoded to escaped values to be safe.
  * Made some corrections to `NullDate`.</comment>
