  <title>Captures the output of subprocesses in real-time</title>
  <description>This package provides a drop-in alternative to `subprocess.run` that
captures the output while still printing it in real-time, just the way
`tee` does.

Printing output in real-time while still capturing is valuable for
any tool that executes long-running child processes. For those, you do want
to provide instant feedback (progress) related to what is happening.
