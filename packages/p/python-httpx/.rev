    <comment>- Update to 0.22.0:
  * Add support for `Client(allow_redirects=&lt;bool&gt;)`. (Pull #1790)
  * Add automatic character set detection, when no `charset` is included in the response `Content-Type` header. (Pull #1791)
  * Added the `httpx` command-line client.
  * Response instances now include `.is_informational`, `.is_success`, `.is_redirect`, `.is_client_error`, and `.is_server_error`
    properties for checking 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx response types. Note that the behaviour of `.is_redirect` is slightly different in that it now returns True for all 3xx responses, in order to allow for a consistent set of properties onto the different HTTP status code types. The `response.has_redirect_location` location may be used to determine responses with properly formed URL redirects.
  * Support for [the SOCKS5 proxy protocol](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#socks) via [the `socksio` package](https://github.com/sethmlarson/socksio). (#2034)
  * Support for custom headers in multipart/form-data requests (#1936)
  * Event hooks are now also called for any additional redirect or auth requests/responses. (Pull #1806)
  * Strictly enforce that upload files must be opened in binary mode. (Pull #1736)
  * Strictly enforce that client instances can only be opened and closed once, and cannot be re-opened. (Pull #1800)
  * Drop `mode` argument from `httpx.Proxy(..., mode=...)`. (Pull #1795)
  * The `allow_redirects` flag is now `follow_redirects` and defaults to `False`.
  * The `raise_for_status()` method will now raise an exception for any responses
    except those with 2xx status codes. Previously only 4xx and 5xx status codes
    would result in an exception.
  * The low-level transport API changes to the much simpler `response = transport.handle_request(request)`.
  * The `client.send()` method no longer accepts a `timeout=...` argument, but the
    `client.build_request()` does. This required by the signature change of the
    Transport API. The request timeout configuration is now stored on the request
    instance, as `request.extensions['timeout']`.
  * `response.iter_bytes()` no longer raises a ValueError when called on a response with no content. (Pull #1827)
  * The `'wsgi.error'` configuration now defaults to `sys.stderr`, and is corrected to be a `TextIO` interface, not a `BytesIO` interface. Additionally, the WSGITransport now accepts a `wsgi_error` configuration. (Pull #1828)
  * Follow the WSGI spec by properly closing the iterable returned by the application. (Pull #1830)
  * Don't perform unreliable close/warning on `__del__` with unclosed clients. (#2026)
  * Fix `Headers.update(...)` to correctly handle repeated headers (#2038)
  * Fix streaming uploads using `SyncByteStream` or `AsyncByteStream`. Regression in 0.21.2. (#2016)
  * HTTP/2 support for tunnelled proxy cases. (#2009)
  * Improved the speed of large file uploads. (#1948)
  * The `response.url` property is now correctly annotated as `URL`, instead of `Optional[URL]`. (#1940)</comment>
