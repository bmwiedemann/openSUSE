Mon Jan 16 10:33:05 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 0.23.3
  * Version 0.23.2 accidentally included stricter type checking on query
    parameters. This shouldn've have been included in a minor version bump, and
    is now reverted. (#2523, #2539)
- 0.23.2 (2nd Jan, 2023)
  * Support digest auth nonce counting to avoid multiple auth requests. (#2463)
  * Multipart file uploads where the file length cannot be determine now use
    chunked transfer encoding, rather than loading the entire file into memory
    in order to determine the `Content-Length`. (#2382)
  * Raise `TypeError` if content is passed a dict-instance. (#2495)
  * Partially revert the API breaking change in 0.23.1, which removed `RawURL`.
    We continue to expose a `url.raw` property which is now a plain
    named-tuple. This API is still expected to be deprecated, but we will do so
    with a major version bump. (#2481)
- 0.23.1 (18th Nov, 2022)
  **Note**: The 0.23.1 release should have used a proper version bump, rather
            than a minor point release. There are API surface area changes
            that may affect some users. See the "Removed" section of these
            release notes for details.
  ### Added
    * Support for Python 3.11. (#2420)
    * Allow setting an explicit multipart boundary in `Content-Type` header.
      (#2278)
    * Allow `tuple` or `list` for multipart values, not just `list`. (#2355)
    * Allow `str` content for multipart upload files. (#2400)
    * Support connection upgrades. See
      https://www.encode.io/httpcore/extensions/#upgrade-requests
  ### Fixed
    * Don't drop empty query parameters. (#2354)
  ### Removed
    * Upload files *must* always be opened in binary mode. (#2400)
    * Drop `.read`/`.aread` from `SyncByteStream`/`AsyncByteStream`. (#2407)
    * Drop `RawURL`. (#2241)

- Add transfer-encoding-lower-case.patch to fix failing tests due
  to incorrect capitalization of the 'transfer-encoding' header
  (gh#encode/httpx!1735).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 19 15:45:42 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.23.0
  * Drop support for Python 3.6. (#2097)
  * Use utf-8 as the default character set, instead of falling back
    to charset-normalizer for auto-detection. To enable automatic
    character set detection, see the documentation. (#2165)
  * Fix URL.copy_with for some oddly formed URL cases. (#2185)
  * Digest authentication should use case-insensitive comparison
    for determining which algorithm is being used. (#2204)
  * Fix console markup escaping in command line client. (#1866)
  * When files are used in multipart upload, ensure we always seek
    to the start of the file. (#2065)
  * Ensure that iter_bytes never yields zero-length chunks. (#2068)
  * Preserve Authorization header for redirects that are to the
    same origin, but are an http-to-https upgrade. (#2074)
  * When responses have binary output, don't print the output to
    the console in the command line client. Use output like <16086
    bytes of binary data> instead. (#2076)
  * Fix display of --proxies argument in the command line client
    help. (#2125)
  * Close responses when task cancellations occur during stream
    reading. (#2156)
  * Fix type error on accessing .request on HTTPError exceptions.
    (#2158)
- Drop CVE-2021-41945-copy_with-data-leak.patch fixed upstream
  (bsc#1199002)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  2 03:01:52 UTC 2022 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Add patch CVE-2021-41945-copy_with-data-leak.patch:
  * Do not leak data in httpx.URL.copy_with (bsc#1199002, CVE-2021-41945) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 11 19:31:34 UTC 2022 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Only recommend and not require the installation of python-h2 because it is
  seriously broken and prevents any other Python software to run correctly with -bb.
  (See also: https://github.com/python-hyper/h2/issues/1236)
  This also matches upstream's setup.py which lists h2 as optional
  dependency in extra_requires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  1 07:01:13 UTC 2022 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.22.0:
  * Add support for `Client(allow_redirects=<bool>)`. (Pull #1790)
  * Add automatic character set detection, when no `charset` is included in the response `Content-Type` header. (Pull #1791)
  * Added the `httpx` command-line client.
  * Response instances now include `.is_informational`, `.is_success`, `.is_redirect`, `.is_client_error`, and `.is_server_error`
    properties for checking 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx response types. Note that the behaviour of `.is_redirect` is slightly different in that it now returns True for all 3xx responses, in order to allow for a consistent set of properties onto the different HTTP status code types. The `response.has_redirect_location` location may be used to determine responses with properly formed URL redirects.
  * Support for [the SOCKS5 proxy protocol](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#socks) via [the `socksio` package](https://github.com/sethmlarson/socksio). (#2034)
  * Support for custom headers in multipart/form-data requests (#1936)
  * Event hooks are now also called for any additional redirect or auth requests/responses. (Pull #1806)
  * Strictly enforce that upload files must be opened in binary mode. (Pull #1736)
  * Strictly enforce that client instances can only be opened and closed once, and cannot be re-opened. (Pull #1800)
  * Drop `mode` argument from `httpx.Proxy(..., mode=...)`. (Pull #1795)
  * The `allow_redirects` flag is now `follow_redirects` and defaults to `False`.
  * The `raise_for_status()` method will now raise an exception for any responses
    except those with 2xx status codes. Previously only 4xx and 5xx status codes
    would result in an exception.
  * The low-level transport API changes to the much simpler `response = transport.handle_request(request)`.
  * The `client.send()` method no longer accepts a `timeout=...` argument, but the
    `client.build_request()` does. This required by the signature change of the
    Transport API. The request timeout configuration is now stored on the request
    instance, as `request.extensions['timeout']`.
  * `response.iter_bytes()` no longer raises a ValueError when called on a response with no content. (Pull #1827)
  * The `'wsgi.error'` configuration now defaults to `sys.stderr`, and is corrected to be a `TextIO` interface, not a `BytesIO` interface. Additionally, the WSGITransport now accepts a `wsgi_error` configuration. (Pull #1828)
  * Follow the WSGI spec by properly closing the iterable returned by the application. (Pull #1830)
  * Don't perform unreliable close/warning on `__del__` with unclosed clients. (#2026)
  * Fix `Headers.update(...)` to correctly handle repeated headers (#2038)
  * Fix streaming uploads using `SyncByteStream` or `AsyncByteStream`. Regression in 0.21.2. (#2016)
  * HTTP/2 support for tunnelled proxy cases. (#2009)
  * Improved the speed of large file uploads. (#1948)
  * The `response.url` property is now correctly annotated as `URL`, instead of `Optional[URL]`. (#1940)
- Inject multibuild to cut down a build loop.
- Remove patch 0001-Add-a-network-pytest-mark-for-tests-that-use-the-network.patch:
  * Included upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 18 07:56:56 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.18.2
  * Added
    - Support for Python 3.10. (Pull #1687)
    - Expose httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT, used as the default to auth
      and timeout parameters in request methods.
    - Support HTTP/2 "prior knowledge", using
      httpx.Client(http1=False, http2=True).
  * Fixed
    - Clean up some cases where warnings were being issued.
    - Prefer Content-Length over Transfer-Encoding: chunked for
      content= cases.

- Update to 0.18.1
  * Changed
    - Update brotli support to use the brotlicffi package
    - Ensure that Request(..., stream=...) does not auto-generate
      any headers on the request instance.
  * Fixed
    - Pass through timeout=... in top-level httpx.stream()
      function.
    - Map httpcore transport close exceptions to httpx exceptions.

- Add patch (submitted to upstream at gh#encode/httpx#1669) to add
  a pytest marker so we can disable the tests that use the network
  in %check:
  * 0001-Add-a-network-pytest-mark-for-tests-that-use-the-network.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 15:15:51 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Enable tests (adding some missing dependencies and disabling
  test_async_proxy_close and test_sync_proxy_close since they
  access the network)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 08:58:20 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.18.0
  * The 0.18.x release series formalises our low-level Transport
    API, introducing the base classes httpx.BaseTransport and
    httpx.AsyncBaseTransport.
    See the "Writing custom transports" documentation and the
    httpx.BaseTransport.handle_request() docstring for more
    complete details on implementing custom transports.
    Pull request #1522 includes a checklist of differences from
    the previous httpcore transport API, for developers
    implementing custom transports.
    The following API changes have been issuing deprecation
    warnings since 0.17.0 onwards, and are now fully deprecated...
    - You should now use httpx.codes consistently instead of
      httpx.StatusCodes.
    - Use limits=... instead of pool_limits=....
    - Use proxies={"http://": ...} instead of proxies={"http": ...}
      for scheme-specific mounting.
  * Changed
    - Transport instances now inherit from httpx.BaseTransport or
      httpx.AsyncBaseTransport, and should implement either the
      handle_request method or handle_async_request method.
      (Pull #1522, #1550)
    - The response.ext property and Response(ext=...) argument are
      now named extensions. (Pull #1522)
    - The recommendation to not use data=<bytes|str|bytes
      (a)iterator> in favour of content=<bytes|str|bytes
      (a)iterator> has now been escalated to a deprecation warning.
      (Pull #1573)
    - Drop Response(on_close=...) from API, since it was a bit of
      leaking implementation detail. (Pull #1572)
    - When using a client instance, cookies should always be set on
      the client, rather than on a per-request basis. We prefer
      enforcing a stricter API here because it provides clearer
      expectations around cookie persistence, particularly when
      redirects occur. (Pull #1574)
    - The runtime exception httpx.ResponseClosed is now named
      httpx.StreamClosed. (#1584)
    - The httpx.QueryParams model now presents an immutable
      interface. The is a discussion on the design and motivation
      here. Use client.params = client.params.merge(...) instead of
      client.params.update(...). The basic query manipulation
      methods are query.set(...), query.add(...), and
      query.remove(). (#1600)
  * Added
    - The Request and Response classes can now be serialized using
      pickle. (#1579)
    - Handle data={"key": [None|int|float|bool]} cases.
      (Pull #1539)
    - Support httpx.URL(**kwargs), for example
      httpx.URL(scheme="https", host="www.example.com", path="/'),
      or httpx.URL("https://www.example.com/",
      username="tom@gmail.com", password="123 456"). (Pull #1601)
    - Support url.copy_with(params=...). (Pull #1601)
    - Add url.params parameter, returning an immutable QueryParams
      instance. (Pull #1601)
    - Support query manipulation methods on the URL class. These
      are url.copy_set_param(), url.copy_add_param(),
      url.copy_remove_param(), url.copy_merge_params().
      (Pull #1601)
    - The httpx.URL class now performs port normalization, so :80
      ports are stripped from http URLs and :443 ports are stripped
      from https URLs. (Pull #1603)
    - The URL.host property returns unicode strings for
      internationalized domain names. The URL.raw_host property
      returns byte strings with IDNA escaping applied. (Pull #1590)
  * Fixed
    - Fix Content-Length for cases of files=... where unicode
      string is used as the file content. (Pull #1537)
    - Fix some cases of merging relative URLs against
      Client(base_url=...). (Pull #1532)
    - The request.content attribute is now always available except
      for streaming content, which requires an explicit .read().
      (Pull #1583)

- Update to v0.17.1
  * Fixed
    - Type annotation on CertTypes allows keyfile and password to
      be optional. (Pull #1503)
    - Fix httpcore pinned version. (Pull #1495)

- Update to v0.17.0
  * Added
    - Add httpx.MockTransport(), allowing to mock out a transport
      using pre-determined responses. (Pull #1401, Pull #1449)
    - Add httpx.HTTPTransport() and httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport()
      default transports. (Pull #1399)
    - Add mount API support, using httpx.Client(mounts=...).
      (Pull #1362)
    - Add chunk_size parameter to iter_raw(), iter_bytes(),
      iter_text(). (Pull #1277)
    - Add keepalive_expiry parameter to httpx.Limits()
      configuration. (Pull #1398)
    - Add repr to httpx.Cookies to display available cookies.
      (Pull #1411)
    - Add support for params=<tuple> (previously only
      params=<list> was supported). (Pull #1426)
  * Fixed
    - Add missing raw_path to ASGI scope. (Pull #1357)
    - Tweak create_ssl_context defaults to use trust_env=True.
      (Pull #1447)
    - Properly URL-escape WSGI PATH_INFO. (Pull #1391)
    - Properly set default ports in WSGI transport. (Pull #1469)
    - Properly encode slashes when using base_url. (Pull #1407)
    - Properly map exceptions in request.aclose(). (Pull #1465)
