    <comment>- update to 1.59:
  * The &quot;normalize&quot; function in the sample editor's volume
    toolbox didn't work like it should if you had only selected
    one single sample point (for example after cutting sample
    data)
  * The (fake) spectrum analyzer is now more accurate to real PT
    in quirky cases
  * Some very small code changes not really worthy of a
    description
  * Updated effects.txt with the little known and undocumented
    effect &quot;E8x&quot;
- update to 1.58:
  * Added support for loading FLAC samples
  * The IFF sample saver was writing somewhat broken files for
    non-looped samples
  * The &quot;UPSAMP&quot; button in Edit Op. was showing the wrong status
    text
  * Small code refactor for how the song is timed/ticked. Longer
    song-to-WAV renders may have a filesize change of a few
    bytes, but this is actually more correct.
  * Increased number of precision bits for song BPM, playback
    time counter and audio-&gt;video syncing. This is a minor change
    and does very little in practice as the previous precision
    was already quite good.
  * Audio/video sync timestamps are reset every half an hour to
    prevent possible sync drifting after several hours of playing
    a song without a single song stop (resets timestamp) in-
    between
  * The HPC timers are reset every half an hour instead of every
    hour. The video (if no vsync) and the scopes use these</comment>
