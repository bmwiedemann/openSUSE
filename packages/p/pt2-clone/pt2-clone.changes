Mon Oct 30 18:51:32 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.65
  * Removed audio output dithering. It seemed to be wrongly
    implemented anyway.
  * Removed CTRL+G and CTRL+V keybinding (boost/filter all
    samples)
  * The BOOST (Edit Op. #3) function was not 100% accurate to
    Amiga ProTracker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 15:46:45 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.64
  * Bugfix: A buffer overrun would occur if MOD2WAVFREQUENCY was
    set higher than FREQUENCY in protracker.ini while using
    MOD2WAV.
  * Right mouse button can now be held down while scrolling in
    Pos Ed. for faster scrolling speeds (forgot to implement this).
- Update to version 1.63
  * When loading raw samples, use the filename as the sample name.

Tue Aug 29 15:01:15 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.62:
  * Bugfix: It was possible to scroll out of bounds in Disk Op. by
    using shift+key
  * Bugfix: Don't set "song unsaved" flag if text editing didn't
    make a change.
  * Bugfix: Editing the Disk Op. path text would set the
    "song unsaved" flag.
  * Bugfix: Using the "CLEAR" button while Edit. Op. or the about
    screen was open could lead to a screen redrawing issue.
  * Disk Op. file entry jumping (left shift + key) now works a bit
    differently. If the last pressed jump key didn't change, cycle
    through pages if there are more matches to be found. This
    allows for quicker module finding.
  * Re-implemented the Pos Ed. pattern naming feature. Be aware
    that this data is not saved to the module, and is only used to
    temporarily keep track of the patterns while making the module.
  * Code refactoring, a small portion of the code should be easier
    to understand now.

- update to 1.61:
  * De-minimize window (if minimized) and set focus after drag n'
    drop of file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 19 19:17:53 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.60:
  * Added an AUTO mode for VIDEOSCALE in protracker.ini. This is
    now the default. It will use the most optimal window size
    based on the screen resolution. If you want this feature but
    don't want to replace protracker.ini, set VIDEOSCALE to AUTO
    (make sure you have v1.60 or later). Manual settings (2X, 3X,
    ...) still work like expected.
  * Removed VIDEOSCALE limit of 2X for ARM systems. This was
    originally meant for Raspberry Pi, but it would affect all
    ARM systems (except Apple).

Sun Jun 11 08:18:15 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.59:
  * The "normalize" function in the sample editor's volume
    toolbox didn't work like it should if you had only selected
    one single sample point (for example after cutting sample
    data)
  * The (fake) spectrum analyzer is now more accurate to real PT
    in quirky cases
  * Some very small code changes not really worthy of a
    description
  * Updated effects.txt with the little known and undocumented
    effect "E8x"
- update to 1.58:
  * Added support for loading FLAC samples
  * The IFF sample saver was writing somewhat broken files for
    non-looped samples
  * The "UPSAMP" button in Edit Op. was showing the wrong status
    text
  * Small code refactor for how the song is timed/ticked. Longer
    song-to-WAV renders may have a filesize change of a few
    bytes, but this is actually more correct.
  * Increased number of precision bits for song BPM, playback
    time counter and audio->video syncing. This is a minor change
    and does very little in practice as the previous precision
    was already quite good.
  * Audio/video sync timestamps are reset every half an hour to
    prevent possible sync drifting after several hours of playing
    a song without a single song stop (resets timestamp) in-
    between
  * The HPC timers are reset every half an hour instead of every
    hour. The video (if no vsync) and the scopes use these
    timers. This hopefully fixes potential timing drifting issues
    that were still lingering.
  * Code refactoring for module/sample loaders
