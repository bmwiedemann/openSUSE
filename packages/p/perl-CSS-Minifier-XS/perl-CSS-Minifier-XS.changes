   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-CSS-Minifier-XS/Changes

  0.13      2021-02-06 17:26:39-08:00 America/Vancouver
      - Internals; avoid allocating memory for each node as we tokenize the
        document, and simply use pointers back into original string.
        - Dramatically improves performance; local testing shows boost from
          ~25/s to ~85MB/s
      - Improve zero value minification further
      - Simplified whitespace compaction
  0.12      2021-01-30 21:46:07-08:00 America/Vancouver
      - rewrote test suite into a single ".t" test
      - GH #1 / RT #97574; whitespace before a ":" in a pseudo-selector is
        meaningful and needs to be preserved (e.g. "#link :visited")
      - Further reductions of "zero values", when possible
        - "00000px" and "0.0px" become "0px"
        - "000%" and "0.0%" become "0%"
        - units are preserved inside of functions, but eliminated otherwise, and
          percentages are always left as a percentages
      - Optimized whitespace collapsing
      - Optimized memory usage and string copying
  0.11      2020-12-30 21:27:39-08:00 America/Vancouver
      - POD spelling fixes
      - Switch to DZil Author Bundle
  0.10      2020-12-28 11:00:17-08:00 America/Vancouver
      - RT #90879; correct minification of %s in "hsl()" and "hsla()" functions
        Thanks to Philipp Soehnlein
      - RT #103231; don't remove units on zero values inside of functions.
        Thanks to Isaac Montoya, for an additional test case.
      - No long drop units on zero percentages, as those may be required for CSS
        animations.  Thanks to Isaac Montoya for continuing to poke me on this.
      - Now prunes leading whitespace before "!important"
          e.g. "color: red !important" becomes "color:red!important"
      - Switch to Dist::Zilla

     - RT #85350; retain WS around "+" and "-" operators, so that we don't break
       the "calc()" function by accident.
       Thanks to Philipp Soehnlein
     - RT #60239; remove WS around ">" and "~" selector combinators
       Thanks to Jacob R.
     - RT #60238; remove units on zero values (e.g. "0px" -> "0")
       Thanks to Jacob R.
     - RT #85896 and #79792; allow builds on Perls older than 5.8.8
       Thanks to Michael Robinton
