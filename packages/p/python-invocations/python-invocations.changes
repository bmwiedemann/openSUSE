- Update to version 2.6.1
  no changelog
- Update to version 2.6.0 2022-03-25
  [Feature]: Update packaging.release.publish with a new config option, rebuild_with_env,
  to support a downstream (Fabric) release use-case.
  [Feature]: Enhance packaging.release.test-install so it’s more flexible about the primary directory argument
  (re: a dist dir, or a parent of one) and errors usefully when you (probably) gave it an incorrect path.
- Update to version 2.5.0 2022-03-25
  [Feature]: Port make-sshable from the travis module to the new ci one.
- Update to version 2.4.0 2022-03-17
  [Feature]: Add additional CLI flags to the use of gpg when signing releases,
  to support headless passphrase entry. It was found that modern GPG versions require --batch and
  --pinentry-mode=loopback for --passphrase-fd to function correctly.
  [Feature]: Add a new invocations.ci task module for somewhat-more-generic CI support than the now legacy invocations.travis tasks.
  [Feature]: Allow supplying additional test runners to pytest.coverage; primarily useful for setting up multiple additive test runs before publishing reports.

- Update to 2.3.0
  * [Bug]: The packaging.release.upload task wasn’t properly
    exposed externally, even though another task’s docstring
    referenced it. Fixed.
  * [Bug]: Ensure that the venv used for
    packaging.release.test_install has its pip upgraded to match
    the invoking interpreter’s version of same; this avoids common
    pitfalls where the “inner” pip is a bundled-with-venv,
    much-older version incapable of modern package installations.
  * [Support]: Overhaul testing and release procedures to use
    CircleCI & modern Invocations.
  * 2.2.0 2021-09-03
  * [Feature]: Added the invocations.environment module with
    top-level functions such as in_ci.
  * [Feature]: packaging.release.push, in dry-run mode, now
    dry-runs its git push subcommand – meaning the subcommand
    itself is what is “dry-ran”, instead of truly executing git
    push --dry-run – when a CI environment is detected.
  * This prevents spurious errors when the git remote (eg Github)
    bails out on read-only authentication credentials, which is
    common within CI systems.
  * It’s also just not very useful to dry-run a real git push
    within CI, since almost certainly the commands to generate git
    objects to get pushed will themselves not have truly run!
  * [Bug]: packaging.release.status (and its use elsewhere, eg
    prepare) didn’t adequately reload the local project’s version
    module during its second/final recheck; this causes that check
    to fail when said version was edited as part of a prepare run.
    It now force-reloads said version module.
- Release 2.1.0
  * [Feature]: Added twine check (which validates packaging
    metadata’s long_description) as a pre-upload step within
    packaging.release.publish.
  * This includes some tweaking of readme_renderer behavior (used
    internally by twine) so it correctly spots more malformed RST,
    as Sphinx does.
  * [Feature]: Add packaging.release.push for pushing Git objects
    as part of a release.
  * [Feature]: The packaging.release.all_ task has been expanded to
    actually do “ALL THE THINGS!!!”, given a dry_run flag, and
    renamed on the CLI to all (no trailing underscore).
  * [Feature]: packaging.release.prepare grew a dry_run flag to
    match the rest of its friends.
  * [Feature]: Add Codecov support to pytest.coverage.
  * [Feature]: Add packaging.release.test_install task and call it
    just prior to the final step in packaging.release.upload (so
    one doesn’t upload packages which build OK but don’t actually
    install OK).
  * [Bug]: pytest.coverage incorrectly concatenated its opts
    argument to internal options; this has been fixed.
  * [Bug]: Correctly test for html report type inside of
    pytest.coverage when deciding whether to run open at the end.
  * [Bug]: packaging.release.publish missed a spot when it grew
    “kwargs beat configuration” behavior - the index kwarg still
    got overwritten by the config value, if defined. This has been
    fixed.
  * [Bug]: packaging.release.prepare now generates annotated Git
    tags instead of lightweight ones. This was a perplexing
    oversight (Git has always intended annotated tags to be used
    for release purposes) so we’re considering it a bugfix instead
    of a backwards incompatible feature change.
  * [Support]: packaging.release.prepare now runs its internal
    status check twice, once at the start (as before) and again at
    the end (to prove that the actions taken did in fact satisfy
    needs).
  * [Support]: Rely on Invoke 1.6+ for some of its new features.
- Release 2.0.0
  * [Feature]: Add a warnings kwarg/flag to pytest.test, allowing
    one to call it with --no-warnings as an inline ‘alias’ for
    pytest’s own --disable-warnings flag.
  * [Bug]: Fix minor display bug causing the pytest task module to
    append a trailing space to the invocation of pytest itself.
  * [Bug]: release.build and release.publish had bad
    kwargs-vs-config logic preventing flags such as --wheel or
    --python from actually working (config defaults always won out,
    leading to silent ignoring of user input). This has been fixed;
    config will now only be honored unless the CLI appears to be
    overriding it.
  * [Bug]: release.build’s --clean flag has been updated:
    - It now honors configuration like the other flags in this
      task, specifically packaging.clean.
    - It now defaults to False (rationale: most build operations in
      the wild tend to assume no cleaning by default, so defaulting
      to the opposite was sometimes surprising).
      + Warning: This is a backwards incompatible change.
    - When True, it applies to both build and dist directories,
      instead of just build.
      + Warning: This is a backwards incompatible change.
  * [Support]: Modify release task tree to look at main branches in
    addition to master ones, for “are we on a feature release line
    or a bugfix one?” calculations, etc.
  * [Support]: Replace some old Python 2.6-compatible syntax bits.
  * [Support]: Reverse the default value of release.build and
    release.publish)’s wheel argument from False to True. Included
    in this change is a new required runtime dependency on the
    wheel package.
    - Rationale: at this point in time, most users will be
      expecting wheels to be available, and not building wheels is
      likely to be the uncommon case.
    - Warning: This is a backwards incompatible change.
  * [Support] #21: Only require enum34 under Python 2 to prevent it
    clashing with the stdlib enum under Python 3. Credit: Alex
    Gaynor.
  * [Support] #12: Upgrade our packaging manifest so tests (also
    docs, requirements files, etc) are included in the distribution
    archives. Thanks to Tomáš Chvátal for the report.
  * [Support]: Drop Python 3.4 support. We didn’t actually do
    anything to make the code not work on 3.4, but we’ve removed
    some 3.4 related runtime (and development) dependency
    limitations. Our CI will also no longer test on 3.4.
    - Warning: This is a backwards incompatible change.
