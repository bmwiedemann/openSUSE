- release 0.4
  * This new release stops providing stubs, but instead expects
    libc to do so. On platforms where this is not the case, 
    "-pthread" is injected via our pkg-config file instead. This
    was done to make loading libpthread (indirectly) via dlopen()
    work correctly in the presence of pthread-stubs.
