  <title>UNIVERAL::moniker</title>
  <description>Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good when
written in prose. For this reason, we tend to say things like &quot;customer&quot; or
&quot;basket&quot; when we are referring to 'My::Site::User::Customer' or
'My::Site::Shop::Basket'. We thought it would be nice if our classes knew
what we would prefer to call them.

This module will add a 'moniker' (and 'plural_moniker') method to
'UNIVERSAL', and so to every class or module.</description>
