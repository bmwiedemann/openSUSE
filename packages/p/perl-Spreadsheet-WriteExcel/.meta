  <title>This Module can be Used to Create Excel Binary Files</title>
  <description>The Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module can be used to create a cross-

workbook and formatting can be applied to cells. Text, numbers,
formulas, hyperlinks, and images can be written to the cells.

The Excel file produced by this module is compatible with Excel 5, 95,
97, 2000, and 2002.

The module will work on the majority of Windows, UNIX, and Macintosh
platforms. Generated files are also compatible with Gnumeric and
OpenOffice.org, the Linux/UNIX spreadsheet applications. The generated
files are not compatible with MS Access.</description>
