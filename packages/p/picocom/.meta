  <title>Minimal dumb-terminal emulation program</title>
  <description>As its name suggests, [picocom] is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation
program. It is, in principle, very much like minicom, only it's &quot;pico&quot;
instead of &quot;mini&quot;! It was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem
configuration, testing, and debugging tool. It has also served (quite
well) as a low-tech &quot;terminal-window&quot; to allow operator intervention
in PPP connection scripts (something like the ms-windows &quot;open
terminal window before / after dialing&quot; feature). It could also prove
useful in many other similar tasks.</description>
