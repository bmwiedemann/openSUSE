      - Specify min perl as 5.008001 rather than 5.008_001, which was
        causing problems with some versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

      - When Benjamin created this, he had a server set up for doing the
        tests, but that's gone now. So to stop all the fails, I'm skipping
        the live tests for now. Could do with mocking, but this is a stop-gap.

      - Changed the test suite to use some online HTTP status code test servers.
        Let's see how reliable they are.

      - Switched to using Test::RequiresInternet rather than the hand-rolled
        online() function that was duplicated in 2 tests. Plus it was testing
        whether google.com was contactable, and not the site used in the tests.
