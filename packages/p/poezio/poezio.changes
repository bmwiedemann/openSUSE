  API:

  * E2EEPlugin decrypts encrypted messages even when they have no body.
  * E2EEPlugin lets through already encrypted messages without giving them
    to the user lib (poezio-omemo, for example).
  * Correctly pass realjid to decrypt call for MUC messages
  *  /<encryption_name>_fingerprint command is added. Plugins can implement
    `get_fingerprints` and `format_fingerprint` for it to return a (formatted)
    value.
  Under the hood:
  * Moved development from 'master' to 'main' branch
  * Lots of type hints added (decorators, multiuserchat, shlex, common, muctab,
    etc.) fixing many bugs
  * Lots of event handlers and calls are now async in poezio. Many callbacks removed.

    - Trim all messages by 24 bytes on 64-bit systems
    - Reduce log parsing by a lot
  * No more safeJID calls. (#3457)
  * Rework some features to use slixmpp's API instead of custom poezio code
    (i.e., muc's set_subject, set_role, set_affiliation, destroy_room,
    cancel_config, set_room_config, and most events)
  * Split commands from Core
  * Require typing_extensions package for python
  * Require setuptools package explicitly because of pkg_resources' import
  * Replace asyncio.ensure_future with asyncio.create_task
