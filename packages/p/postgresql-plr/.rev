    <comment>- use _multibuild
As such it should replace any variant of postgresql-plr we have in factory.

- Packaging
  + Make comment versionable
  + Remove obsoleted macro (mkdir, install)
  + Fix copyright line 
- Remove non maintained postgresql version 9.1 9.2
- Undo the rename of postgresql-plr.changes.in to make happy 
  factory auto-bot 
- Update to 08.03.00.17 version - Bring support to postgresql96
- Packaging
  + Move source to github and adapt packaging for that
  + Add plr-US.pdf as documentation, html being not delivered
    Documentation is build outside of the package to avoid texlive
  + Redone patch-Makefile-ldflags.patch to current sources
  + Rename postgresql-plr.changes.in to postgresql-plr.changes to
    ease osc vc edition, adapt pre_checking.sh to this change.

  Remove hack to take signal back from R interpreter (Mark Kirkwood)
  Set R_SignalHandlers = 0, the proper way to prevent R from taking signals in the first place (Mark Kirkwood)
  Adjust RPM spec file
  As of pg9.2 the syntax &quot;LANGUAGE 'C'&quot; no longer works. Use &quot;LANGUAGE C&quot; instead.
  The MacPorts installation has the header filed distributed across two different directories, so there is no single &quot;rincludedir&quot; to query from pkg-config. Instead, do it the proper way and ask pkg-config for the cflags, which should work for all installation variants. (Peter Eisentraut)
