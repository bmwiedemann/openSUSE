  <description>Dispatcher mechanism for creating event models.

PyDispatcher is an enhanced version of Patrick K. O’Brien’s original
dispatcher.py module. It provides the Python programmer with a robust
mechanism for event routing within various application contexts.

Included in the package are the robustapply and saferef modules, which
provide the ability to selectively apply arguments to callable objects and
to reference instance methods using weak-references.
