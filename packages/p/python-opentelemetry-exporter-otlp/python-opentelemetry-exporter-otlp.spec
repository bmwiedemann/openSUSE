OpenTelemetry Collector Exporters

This library is provided as a convenience to install all supported
OpenTelemetry Collector Exporters. Currently it installs:

* opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc
* opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http

In the future, additional packages will be available:
* opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-json-http

To avoid unnecessary dependencies, users should install the specific package
once they've determined their preferred serialization and protocol method.
