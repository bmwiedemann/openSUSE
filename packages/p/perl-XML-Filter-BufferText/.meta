  <title>Filter to put all characters() in one event</title>
  <description>This is a very simple filter. One common cause of grief (and programmer error)
is that XML parsers aren`t required to provide character events in one chunk.
They can, but are not forced to, and most don`t. This filter does the trivial
but oft-repeated task of putting all characters into a single event.
