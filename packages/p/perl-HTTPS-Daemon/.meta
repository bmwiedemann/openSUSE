  <title>a simple http server class with SSL support</title>
  <description>HTTP::Daemon::SSL is a descendant of HTTP::Daemon that uses SSL sockets
(via IO::Socket::SSL) instead of cleartext sockets.  It also handles
SSL-specific problems, such as dealing with HTTP clients that attempt
to connect to it without using SSL.</description>
