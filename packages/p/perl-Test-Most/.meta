  <title>Most commonly needed test functions and features</title>
  <description>Test::Most exists to reduce boilerplate and to make your testing life easier.
We provide &quot;one stop shopping&quot; for most commonly used testing modules. In fact,
we often require the latest versions so that you get bug fixes through
Test::Most and don't have to keep upgrading these modules separately.

This module provides you with the most commonly used testing functions, along
with automatically turning on strict and warning and gives you a bit more
fine-grained control over your test suite.
