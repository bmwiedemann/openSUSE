%description
Test::Most exists to reduce boilerplate and to make your testing life
easier. We provide "one stop shopping" for most commonly used testing
modules. In fact, we often require the latest versions so that you get bug
fixes through Test::Most and don't have to keep upgrading these modules
separately.

This module provides you with the most commonly used testing functions,
along with automatically turning on strict and warning and gives you a bit
more fine-grained control over your test suite.

    use Test::Most tests => 4, 'die';

    ok 1, 'Normal calls to ok() should succeed';
    is 2, 2, '... as should all passing tests';
    eq_or_diff [3], [4], '... but failing tests should die';
    ok 4, '... will never get to here';

As you can see, the 'eq_or_diff' test will fail. Because 'die' is in the
import list, the test program will halt at that point.

If you do not want strict and warnings enabled, you must explicitly disable
them. Thus, you must be explicit about what you want and no longer need to
worry about accidentally forgetting them.

    use Test::Most tests => 4;
    no strict;
    no warnings;
