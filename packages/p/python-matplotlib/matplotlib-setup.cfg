# Rename this file to setup.cfg to modify Matplotlib's build options.

[egg_info]

[libs]
# By default, Matplotlib builds with LTO, which may be slow if you re-compile
# often, and don't need the space saving/speedup.
#enable_lto = True
# By default, Matplotlib downloads and builds its own copy of FreeType, and
# builds its own copy of Qhull.  You may set the following to True to instead
# link against a system FreeType/Qhull.
#system_freetype = False
#system_qhull = False

[packages]
# There are a number of data subpackages from Matplotlib that are
# considered optional. All except 'tests' data (meaning the baseline
# image files) are installed by default, but that can be changed here.
tests = True
sample_data = True

[gui_support]
# Matplotlib supports multiple GUI toolkits, known as backends.
# The MacOSX backend requires the Cocoa headers included with XCode.
# You can select whether to build it by uncommenting the following line.
# It is never built on Linux or Windows, regardless of the config value.
#
#macosx = True

[rc_options]
# User-configurable options
#
# Default backend, one of: Agg, Cairo, GTK3Agg, GTK3Cairo, MacOSX, Pdf, Ps,
# Qt4Agg, Qt5Agg, SVG, TkAgg, WX, WXAgg.
#
# The Agg, Ps, Pdf and SVG backends do not require external dependencies.  Do
# not choose MacOSX if you have disabled the relevant extension modules.  The
# default is determined by fallback.
#
#backend = Agg
