  <title>Example HEP files for testing and demonstrating</title>
  <description>A common package to provide example files (*e.g*. ROOT) for testing and
developing packages against.  The sample of files is representative of typical
files found &quot;in the wild&quot;.

In addition to including some root files directly, this package adds some
simple helper methods to get larger files from common open-access data
repositories.
