Sat Oct 30 15:30:37 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 5.1.1
  * 5.1.1 fixes compatibility issues with Python 3.10 (rc2).
- Release 5.1.0
  * Traitlets 5.1 brings a couple of updates and changes to
    traitlets, and is recommended for all users. What follow is a
    non-exhaustive list of changes:
  * Removal of the ``ipython_genutils`` dependency, this should
    remove any direct and indirect reliance on ``nose`` and prepare
    traitlets 5.1 for Python 3.10 and above compatibility, some
    test suite changes also accommodate Python 3.10 changes. If you
    package traitlets downstream, make sure to remove this
    dependency.
  * Removal of ``ipython_genutils`` may have change the default
    encoding detected for the command line argument parsing when
    not utf-8. We expect this to affect a small portion of older
    windows version. If you encounter issue let us know.
  * Stop recommendation of ``CUnicode`` in some circumstances as
    it's deprecated.
  * Our test suite is now using GitHub action instead of travis CI.
    If you are packaging downstream using the git repository, you
    may have to exclude the ``.github`` folder now, and can remove
    exclusion of
  * It fixes a parsing issue for list of one single element on the
    CLI.
  * We reserve the right to remove official support for Python 3.7
    in subsequent minor revisions.
- Releases 5.0.2 to 5.0.5
  * Support deprecated literals for sets, tuples on the
    command-line: ``nbconvert
    --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_cell_tags='  *"tag"}'``
  * Fix ``from_string_list`` for Tuples in general
  * Fix support for ``List(default_value=None, allow_none=True)``
    and other Container traits
  * Fix help output for nested aliases and tuple traits
  * Support deprecated use of byte-literals for bytes on the
    command-line: ``ipython kernel --Session.key="b'abc'"``. The
    `b` prefix is no longer needed in traitlets 5.0, but is
    supported for backward-compatibility
  * Improve output of configuration errors, especially when help
    output would make it hard to find the helpful error message
  * Fix regression in handling `--opt=None` on the CLI for configurable traits
    with `allow_none=True`
  * Fix casting bytes to unicode
- Traitlets 5.0
  * Traitlets 5.0 is a new version of traitlets that accumulate
    changes over a period of more close to four years; A number of
    internal refactoring made the internal code structure cleaner
    and simpler, and greatly improved the diagnostic error messages
    as well has help and documentation generation.
  * We expect no code change needed for any consumer of the Python
    API (ipywidgets, and alike), though CLI argument parsing have
    seen a complete rewrite, so if you have an application that
    does use the parsing logic of traitlets you may see changes in
    behavior, and now have access to more features.
  * Major changes are:
    - Removal of Python 2 support,
    - Removal of Python 3.0-3.6 support
    - we now follow NEP 29, and are thus Python 3.7+ only.
    - remove ``six`` as a dependency
    - remove ``funcsig`` as a dependency.

- Update to 4.3.2
  * using :meth:`_traitname_default()` without the ``@default``
    decorator is no longer deprecated.
  * Passing ``config=True`` in traitlets constructors is no longer
    deprecated.
- Update to 4.3.1
  * Compatibility fix for Python 3.6a1
  * Fix bug in Application.classes getting extra entries when
    multiple Applications are instantiated in the same process.
- Update to 4.3.0
  * Improve the generated config file output.
  * Allow TRAITLETS_APPLICATION_RAISE_CONFIG_FILE_ERROR env to
    override :attr:`Application.raise_config_file_errors`,
    so that config file errors can result in exiting immediately.
  * Avoid using root logger. If no application logger is registered,
    the ``'traitlets'`` logger will be used instead of the root
    logger.
  * Change/Validation arguments are now Bunch objects, allowing
    attribute-access, in addition to dictionary access.
  * Reduce number of common deprecation messages in certain cases.
  * Ensure command-line options always have higher priority than
    config files.
  * Add bounds on numeric traits.
  * Improves various error messages.
- Update to 4.2.2
  * Partially revert a change in 4.1 that prevented IPython's
    command-line options from taking priority over config files.
- Update to 4.2.1
  * Demotes warning about unused arguments in ``HasTraits.__init__``
    introduced in 4.2.0 to DeprecationWarning.
- Update to 4.2.0
  * :class:`JSONFileConfigLoader` can be used as a context manager
    for updating configuration.
  * If a value in config does not map onto a configurable trait,
    a message is displayed that the value will have no effect.
  * Unused arguments are passed to ``super()`` in
    ``HasTraits.__init__``, improving support for multiple
    inheritance.
  * Various bugfixes and improvements in the new API introduced
    in 4.1.
  * Application subclasses may specify
    ``raise_config_file_errors = True``
    to exit on failure to load config files,
    instead of the default of logging the failures.
- Update to 4.1
  * Decorators are used, rather than magic method names, for
    registering trait-related methods. See :doc:`using_traitlets`
    and :doc:`migration` for more info.
  * Deprecate ``Trait(config=True)`` in favor of
    ``Trait().tag(config=True)``. In general, metadata is added
    via ``tag`` instead of the constructor.
  * Trait attributes initialized with ``read_only=True`` can only
    be set with the ``set_trait`` method.
    Attempts to directly modify a read-only trait attribute raises
    a ``TraitError``.
  * The directional link now takes an optional `transform`
    attribute allowing the modification of the value.
  * Various fixes and improvements to config-file generation
    (fixed ordering, Undefined showing up, etc.)
  * Warn on unrecognized traits that aren't configurable, to avoid
    silently ignoring mistyped config.
