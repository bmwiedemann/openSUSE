%description
Launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal (pty), and interact with both the
process and its pty.

Sometimes, piping stdin and stdout is not enough. There might be a password
prompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes when it's going to a
pipe rather than a terminal, or curses-style interfaces that rely on a terminal.
If you need to automate these things, running the process in a pseudo terminal
(pty) is the answer.
