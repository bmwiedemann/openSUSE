  <title>Python wrapper for the ssdeep library</title>
  <description>A Python wrapper for ssdeep, which is a library for computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH). Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies. Such inputs
have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both
content and length.
