- Update to version 0.4.2
  * Work with pre-release pytest versions, by [chandlernine](https://github.com/chandlernine), 
    with a different implementation proposed by [Aly Sivji](https://github.com/alysivji).
  * Marking a test with `freeze_time` should freeze time in fixtures, even if the `freezer` 
    fixture is also used explicitly late in the fixture list. Thanks to 
    [Christian Grossm√ºller](https://github.com/chgad) for pointing out the problem.
