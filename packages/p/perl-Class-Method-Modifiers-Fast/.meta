  <title>provides Moose-like method modifiers</title>
  <description>Method modifiers are a powerful feature from the CLOS (Common Lisp Object
System) world.

'Class::Method::Modifiers::Fast' provides three modifiers: 'before',
'around', and 'after'. 'before' and 'after' are run just before and after
the method they modify, but can not really affect that original method.
'around' is run in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call
that original method. See the 'MODIFIERS' section for more details on how
the particular modifiers work.</description>
