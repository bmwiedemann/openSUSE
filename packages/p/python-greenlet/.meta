  <title>Lightweight in-process concurrent programming</title>
  <description>The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython
that supports micro-threads called &quot;tasklets&quot;. Tasklets run
pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)
and are synchronized with data exchanges on &quot;channels&quot;.</description>
