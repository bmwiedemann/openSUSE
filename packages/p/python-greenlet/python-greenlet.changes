Wed Feb 25 09:53:31 UTC 2026 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 3.3.2
  * Fix a crash on Python 3.10 if there are active greenlets during
    interpreter shutdown. See PR 495 by Nicolas Bouvrette.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 29 08:40:10 UTC 2026 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 3.3.1
  * Publish Windows ARM binary wheels, where available.
  * Fix compilation for 3.14t on Windows.
  * Publish Windows 3.14t binary wheels for Intel.
  * Switch from Appveyor for Windows to Github Actions.
  * Fix compilation on MIPS with GCC 15 and binutils 2.45.
    See PR 487 by Rosen Penev. Note that this is not a
    platform tested by this project’s CI.
  * Move most project metadata into the static pyproject.toml
    file. This updates licensing information to use the modern
    License-Expression field. See PR 480 by mrbean-bremen.
- Update BuildRequires from pyproject.toml

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  9 11:29:59 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 3.3.0
  * Drop support for Python 3.9.
  * Switch to distributing manylinux_2_28 wheels instead of manylinux2014
    wheels. Likewise, switch from musllinux_1_1 to 1_2.
  * Add initial support for free-threaded builds of CPython 3.14. Due to
    limitations, we do not distribute binary wheels for free-threaded
    CPython on Windows. (Free-threaded CPython 3.13 may work, but is
    untested and unsupported.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  1 12:37:08 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 3.2.4
  * Various small build/test changes for less common configurations (e.g.,
    building CPython with assertions enabled but NOT debugging),
    contributed by Michał Górny. Note that while greenlet will BUILD in
    a free-threaded Python, it will cause the GIL to be allocated and
    used, and memory may leak. Also note that these configurations
    are not tested by this project's CI.
  * Fix an assertion error on debug builds of Python 3.14 when using the
    experimental JIT. See PR 460.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 11 09:26:37 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

  * Potentially fix build on NetBSD/sparc64. See PR 447.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 12 12:16:08 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 3.2.2
  * Make greenlet build and run on Python 3.14 beta 1. It will not run
    on earlier versions of 3.14; it should run on subsequent versions.
    See PR 445.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 29 09:23:14 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 3.2.1
  * Fix a crash regression for Riscv64. See issue 443.
- from version 3.2.0
  * Remove support for Python 3.7 and 3.8.
  * Add untested, community supported implementation for RiscV 32. See PR 438.
  * Make greenlet build and run on Python 3.14a7. It will not build on earlier
    3.14 alpha releases, and may not build on later 3.14 releases.
  * Packaging: Use PEP 639 license expressions and include license files.

- Fix build error under Leap.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 26 13:37:06 UTC 2024 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.1
  * Fix crashes on 32-bit PPC Linux. Note that there is no CI for this,
    and support is best effort; there may be other issues lurking.
  * Remove unnecessary logging sometimes during interpreter shutdown.
  * Fix some crashes on 32-bit PPC MacOS. This is a very old platform,
    and is only known to be tested on beta versions of an operating
    system that was never released, using the GCC 14 only provided by
    MacPorts; it may or may not work on the final MacOS X release that
    supported 32-bit PowerPC. It has the known issue of leaking memory
    when greenlets are used in multiple threads. Help debugging this
    would be appreciated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 10 20:44:39 UTC 2024 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.0
  * Adds support for Python 3.13.
  * Greatly reduce the chances for crashes during interpreter shutdown.
  * Support for the following platforms was contributed by the community.
    Note that they are untested by this project's continuous integration
    services.
    + Hitachi's SuperH CPU
    + NetBSD on PowerPC
    + RISC-V with -fno-omit-frame-pointer
- Drop port-to-python313.patch, merged upstream

Wed Jan 10 22:14:16 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 3.0.3
  * Python 3.12: Restore the full ability to walk the stack of a
    suspended greenlet; previously only the innermost frame was
    exposed. See issue 388. Fix by Joshua Oreman in PR 393.
- Disable building the docs: Now requires the furo theme, which is
  not available.

- require setuptools

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 17 01:45:41 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.0.2:
  * Packaging: Add a minimal ``pyproject.toml`` to sdists.
  * Packaging: Various updates to macOS wheels.
  * Fix a test case on Arm32. Note that this is not a supported
    platform (there is no CI for it) and support is best effort;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 27 15:46:29 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.0.1:
  * Fix a potential crash on Python 3.8 at interpreter shutdown
    time.  This was a regression from earlier 3.0.x releases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 06:25:18 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0:
  * No changes from 3.0rc3 aside from the version number.
- Ignore some slow and flaky tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 19 22:04:57 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.0.0~rc3:
  * Fix an intermittent error during process termination on some
    platforms (GCC/Linux/libstdc++).
  * Fix some potential bugs (assertion failures and memory leaks) in
    previously-untested error handling code. In some cases, this means
    that the process will execute a controlled ``abort()`` after severe
    trouble when previously the process might have continued for some
    time with a corrupt state. It is unlikely those errors occurred in
    practice.
  * Fix some assertion errors and potential bugs with re-entrant
    switches.
  * Fix a potential crash when certain compilers compile greenlet with
    high levels of optimization. The symptom would be that switching to
    a greenlet for the first time immediately crashes.
  * Fix a potential crash when the callable object passed to the
    greenlet constructor (or set as the ``greenlet.run`` attribute) has
    a destructor attached to it that switches. Typically, triggering
    this issue would require an unlikely subclass of
    ``greenlet.greenlet``.
  * Python 3.11+: Fix rare switching errors that could occur when a
    garbage collection was triggered during the middle of a switch, and
    Python-level code in ``__del__`` or weakref callbacks switched to a
    different greenlet and ultimately switched back to the original
    greenlet. This often manifested as a ``SystemError``: "switch
    returned NULL without an exception set."
  * Python 3.12: Fix walking the frame stack of suspended greenlets.
    Previously accessing ``glet.gr_frame.f_back`` would crash due to
    `changes in CPython's undocumented internal frame handling
  * Make the platform-specific low-level C/assembly snippets stop using
    the ``register`` storage class. Newer versions of standards remove
    this storage class, and it has been generally ignored by many
    compilers for some time. See `PR 347
    <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/347>`_ from Khem
    Raj.
  * Add initial support for Python 3.12. See `issue
    <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/323>`_ and `PR
    <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/327>`_; thanks go
    to (at least) Michael Droettboom, Andreas Motl, Thomas A Caswell,
    raphaelauv, Hugo van Kemenade, Mark Shannon, and Petr Viktorin.
  * Remove support for end-of-life Python versions, including Python
    2.7, Python 3.5 and Python 3.6.
  * Require a compiler that supports ``noinline`` directives. See
    `issue 271
    <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/266>`_.
  * Require a compiler that supports C++11.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 14:37:30 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.0.2:
  * Fix calling ``greenlet.settrace()`` with the same tracer
    object that was currently active.
  * Various compilation and standards conformance fixes.
   * Python 3.11: Fix a memory leak. See issue 328 and gevent issue 1924.
- 2.0.0.post0 (2022-11-03)
   * Add Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11 to the PyPI classifier
     metadata.
- 2.0.0rc5 (2022-10-31)
   * Linux: Fix another group of rare crashes that could occur when shutting
     down an interpeter running multiple threads. See issue 325.
- 2.0.0rc4 (2022-10-30)
   * Linux: Fix a rare crash that could occur when shutting down an interpreter
     running multiple threads, when some of those threads are in greenlets
     making calls to functions that release the GIL.
- 2.0.0rc1 (2022-10-27)
   * Deal gracefully with greenlet switches that occur while deferred
     deallocation of objects is happening using CPython's "trash can"
     mechanism. Previously, if a large nested container held items that
     switched greenlets during delayed deallocation, and that second greenlet
     also invoked the trash can, CPython's internal state could become corrupt.
     This was visible as an assertion error in debug builds. Now, the relevant
     internal state is saved and restored during greenlet switches. See also
     gevent issue 1909.
   * Rename the C API function PyGreenlet_GET_PARENT to PyGreenlet_GetParent
     for consistency. The old name remains available as a deprecated alias.
- 2.0.0a1 (2022-01-20)
   * Drop support for very old versions of GCC and MSVC.
     Compilation now requires a compiler that either supports C++11 or has some
     other intrinsic way to create thread local variables; for older GCC, clang
     and SunStudio we use __thread, while for older MSVC we use
     __declspec(thread).
   * This version of greenlet is known to compile and pass tests on CPython
     3.11.0a4. Earlier or later 3.11 releases may or may not work. See PR 280.
     Special thanks to Brandt Bucher and the CPython developers.
   * Fix several leaks that could occur when using greenlets from multiple
     threads. For example, it is no longer necessary to call getcurrent()
     before exiting a thread to allow its main greenlet to be cleaned up. See
     issue 252.
   * Fix the C API PyGreenlet_Throw to perform the same error checking that the
     Python API greenlet.throw() does. Previously, it did no error checking.

Mon Sep 12 20:13:22 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.3:
  * Add support for Python 3.11.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 16 19:07:41 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.2:
  - Fix a potential crash due to a reference counting error when Python
    subclasses of ``greenlet.greenlet`` were deallocated. The crash
    became more common on Python 3.10; on earlier versions, silent
    memory corruption could result.
  - Fix a leak of a list object when the last reference to a greenlet
    was deleted from some other thread than the one to which it
    belonged. For this to work correctly, you must call a greenlet API
    like ``getcurrent()`` before the thread owning the greenlet exits:
    this is a long-standing limitation that can also lead to the leak of
    a thread's main greenlet if not called; we hope to lift this
    limitation. Note that in some cases this may also fix leaks of
    greenlet objects themselves. See `issue 251
  - Python 3.10: Tracing or profiling into a spawned greenlet didn't
    work as expected. See `issue 256

- %check: use %pyunittest rpm macro

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  6 12:37:38 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.0:
  * Add support for Python 3.10. Pre-built binary wheels for 3.10 are
    not currently available for all platforms. The greenlet ABI is
    different on Python 3.10 from all previous versions, but as 3.10 was
    never supported before, and the ABI has not changed on other Python
    versions, this is not considered a reason to change greenlet's major
    version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  1 22:13:52 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.0.0:
  * Require setuptools to build from source.
  * Stop asking setuptools to build both .tar.gz and .zip
    sdists. PyPI has standardized on .tar.gz for all platforms.
  * Publish the change log to https://greenlet.readthedocs.io

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 23 12:05:16 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 0.4.0:
  + Greenlet has an instance dictionary now, which means it can be
    used for implementing greenlet local storage, etc. However, this
    might introduce incompatibility if subclasses have __dict__ in their
    __slots__. Classes like that will fail, because greenlet already
    has __dict__ out of the box.
  + Greenlet no longer leaks memory after thread termination, as long as
    terminated thread has no running greenlets left at the time.
  + Add support for debian sparc and openbsd5-sparc64
  + Add support for ppc64 linux
  + Don't allow greenlets to be copied with copy.copy/deepcopy
  + Fix arm32/thumb support
