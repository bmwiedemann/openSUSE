  <title>Incredibly simple helpers for testing code with exceptions</title>
  <description>Test::Fatal is an alternative to the popular Test::Exception. It does much
less, but should allow greater flexibility in testing exception-throwing
code with about the same amount of typing.
It exports one routine by default: &quot;exception&quot;.</description>
