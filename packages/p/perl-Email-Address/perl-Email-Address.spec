%description
This class implements a regex-based RFC 2822 parser that locates email
addresses in strings and returns a list of 'Email::Address' objects found.
Alternatively you may construct objects manually. The goal of this software
is to be correct, and very very fast.

Version 1.909 and earlier of this module had vulnerabilies (at
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7686) and (at
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12558) which
allowed specially constructed email to cause a denial of service. The
reported vulnerabilities and some other pathalogical cases (meaning they
really shouldn't occur in normal email) have been addressed in version
1.910 and newer. If you're running version 1.909 or older, you should
update!

Alternatively, you could switch to *Email::Address::XS* which has a
backward compatible API.
