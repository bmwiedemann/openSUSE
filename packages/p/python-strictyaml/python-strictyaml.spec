%description
StrictYAML is a type-safe YAML parser that parses and validates a
restricted subset of the YAML specification.

Priorities:

 * No parsing of hard to read and insecure features of YAML like the
   Norway problem.
 * Strict validation of markup and straightforward type casting.
 * Acting as a near-drop in replacement for pyyaml, ruamel.yaml or poyo.
 * Comment preservation across a read-write cycle
 * Speed is not a key concern
