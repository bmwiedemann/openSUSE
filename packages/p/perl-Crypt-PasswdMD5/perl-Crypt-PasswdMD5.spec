%description
'apache_md5_crypt()' provides a function compatible with Apache's
'.htpasswd' files. This was contributed by Bryan Hart <bryan@eai.com>. This
function is exported by default.

The 'unix_md5_crypt()' provides a crypt()-compatible interface to the
rather new MD5-based crypt() function found in modern operating systems.
It's based on the implementation found on FreeBSD 2.2.[56]-RELEASE. This
function is also exported by default.

For both functions, if a salt value is not supplied, a random salt will be
generated, using the function random_md5_salt(). This function is not
exported by default.
