    is that Etc/GMT+1 is 1 hour _behind_ UTC, and Etc/GMT-1 is 1 hour

  - The fix in 1.99 broke the parsing of the etcetera zones, which are specified
    as 1 or 2 digit offsets in hours, unlike all other zones which are written
    as "1:00" or "-2:00".
  
  
  1.99    2016-06-07
  
  - When parsing the POSIX zones in the etcetera file, don't special case the
    ETC[+-]NN zones. These are weirdly named, as ETC+8 is 8 hours _behind_ UTC,
    and -6 is 6 hours _ahead_. Previously, we were swapping these so the name
    matched the sane usage, but this is confusing for anyone who is explicitly
    trying to use the POSIX names, expecting the bizarre (but POSIXly correct)
    interpretation. Patch by Bron Gondwana. GitHub PR #7.

   module. Instead, it depends on that module when you install
   DateTime::TimeZone on a Windows system machine.
 
 - Tweaked the warning when loading a zone class from disk that was generated
   using a different Olson version than the current DateTime::TimeZone
   module. Previously, it said the loaded version was older, but all we know is
   that it's different. Reported by Karen Etheridge. RT #66097.

- update to 0.91
  - 0.91    2009-05-26
    - This release is based on version 2009h of the Olson database. This
      release has no user-visible changes, but I like to follow along
      anyway.
  - 0.90    2009-04-27
    - This release is based on version 2009g of the Olson database. This
      release has changes for Egypt.
  - 0.89    2009-04-13
    - This release is based on version 2009f of the Olson database. This
      release has changes for Pakistan.
  - 0.88    2009-04-06
    - This release is based on version 2009e of the Olson database. This
      release has changes for Jordan and Palestine.
  - 0.87    2009-04-05
    - The DateTime::TimeZone::Local module will now try to load a subclass
      of the form DateTime::TimeZone::Local::$^O before falling back to
      the Unix subclass. This allows you to provide a new subclass on
      systems where the existing subclasses (Unix, Win32, and VMS) don't
      get the right answer. Based on a patch from Olivier MenguÃ©.
  - 0.86    2009-03-23
    - This release is based on version 2009d of the Olson database. This
      release has changes for Morocco, Tunisia, Syria, and Argentina.
  - 0.85    2009-03-16
    - This release is based on version 2009c of the Olson database. The
      only changes in this release are for Cuba.
    - Fixes for Win32 with Microsoft's December time zone update. This
      updated added a zone for Mauritius that wasn't accounted for in the
      DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32 module. Reported by David
      Pinkowitz. RT #43535.
    - Added a hack to fix some brokenness with Module::Build::Compat that
      causes the compatibility Makefile.PL to fail on really old
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker versions (6.17 and older). RT #43605.
  - 0.84    2009-01-21
    - This release is based on version 2009a of the Olson
      database. Changes include spelling "Katmandu" as "Kathmandu" (with a
      link for the old spelling), fixes for historical rules in
      Switzerland, and changes to America/Resolute and Cuba for the past
      few years (but not present).
    - If DateTime::TimeZone::Local could not load its OS-specific subclass
      because of a missing dependency, it would silently fall back on
      loading the Unix subclass, rather than throwing an error. RT #41305.
    - Fixed a bug where the short names for some time zones were
      wrong. This mostly (exclusively?) manifested in time zone rules for
      the first half of the 20th century or so.
  - 0.8301  2008-11-07
    - Test fixes only. The 19local-win32 tried to skip tests when they're
      run without write access to the registry, but this was done in a
      very broken way.
  - 0.83    2008-10-27
    - This release is based on version 2008i of the Olson database. The
      major changes in this release are for Argentina.
    - Updated the docs on how the local time zone is determined for
      various platforms.
- added perl-macros
  o autogen filelist with perl_gen_filelist
- spec mods
  o added header
  o fixed desc, deps
