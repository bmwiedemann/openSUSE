- update to 0.20.0:
  * When FawltyDeps finds a 3rd-party `import` that is not
    declared, it will output that import name as an undeclared
    dependency. But as we've talked about before, _import_ names
    in Python are not necessarily synonymous with the _package_
    names that you would have to declare in order to make those
    import names available.
  * For example, if you `import sklearn` in your code, it might
    not be obvious that the corresponding dependency declaration
    should be `scikit-learn`, and not `sklearn`.
  * Starting with this version, if you run FawltyDeps with the
    `--detailed` option, _and_ if there happens to be one or more
    (undeclared) packages in your Python environment that provide
    the relevant import name, then FawltyDeps will suggest these
    packages as potential solutions to your undeclared
    dependency.
  * By default (and before this release) FawltyDeps looks at the
    paths on the command-line to deduce where 1st-party imports
    (i.e. your project's own modules) can be found. In some
    corner cases this deduction fails, and the result is
    typically that a 1st-party import is flagged by FawltyDeps as
    an undeclared dependency.
  * The new `--base-dir` allows you to control where FawltyDeps
    looks for 1st-party imports, and it can help fix those cases
    where the default deduction fails, for example in cases where
    you are passing individual file names (instead of directory
    names) on the FawltyDeps command line.
