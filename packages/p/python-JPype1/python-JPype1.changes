Tue Feb 27 01:50:13 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Switch to pyproject and autosetup macros. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  6 17:12:01 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.5.0:
  * Support for Python 3.12
  * Switched __eq__ and __ne__ operator to use equals rather than
    compareTo for comparable objects to avoid exception when
    comparing object of different types.
  * Fixed segmentation fault when comparing Java Comparable to
    primitives.
  * Java exceptions that occur in inequality comparisons now map
    to Python TypeError.
  * Fixed crash when calling subscript on JArray.
  * Fixed direct byte buffers not reporting nbytes correctly when
    cast to memoryview.
  * Expand the defintion for Functional interface to include
    classes without FunctionInterface annotation.
  * Add additional matching level for derived types to resolve
    ambiguities when a derived type is used in place of base
    class when determining the method overload.  This will
    resolve some previous ambiguities between methods.

Tue Aug 16 21:45:24 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to 1.4.0
  Support for all different buffer type conversions.
  * Improved buffer transfers to numpy as guaranteed to match Java types. 
    However, exact dtype for conversions is os/numpy version dependent.
  * Support for byte order channels on buffer transfers.
  * Byte size for buffers now fixed to Java definitions.
  * When directly accessing Java arrays using memory view, Python requires a cast
    from buffers. Required because Python does not support memory view alterations
    on non-native sizes.
  Fix crash when comparing JChar.
    * Order handling for numerical operations with JChar fixed.
  * Improved matching for Java functors based on parameter count.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.5 and 3.6
  * dbapi2 handles drivers that don't support autocommit.
  * Fixed issue when Java classes with dunder methods such as __del__ caused 
    conflicts in Python type system. Java method which match dunder patterns are longer
    translated to Python.
  * Fix issue with numpy arrays with no dimensions resulting in crash.
  * Support for user defined conversions for java.lang.Class and array types.
  * Fixed issue with ssize_t on Windows for Python 3.10. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 21 12:18:03 UTC 2022 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Update to v1.3.0
  * Fixes for memory issues found when upgrading to Python 3.10 beta.
  * Add additional diagnositics for importing of non-public class.
  * Fixed issue with classes with unsatified dependencies leading to
    a crash on windows.
  * Fixed a bug with arrays created using the short cut.
- from v1.2.1
  * Missing stub files added.
  * Python 3.9 issues are resolved on Windows.
  * JPype scans jar files and rebuilding missing directories to
    allow imports from stripped and obfuscated jar files.
- from v1.2.0
  * Added builds for Python 3.9.
  * Fixed bug when importing from multi-release jars.
  * addClassPath can add jar files after the JVM is started.
    The default loader for JPype class is
    ``org.jpype.classloader.DynamicClassLoader``.
  * Build support of z/OS added.
  * Bug causing ambiguity between primitives and variadic arguments
    in method resolution was corrected.
  * Boolean was inadvertently left out of method resolution.
    ``boolean`` now properly matched with boxed types.
  * Support for PyInstaller was added.
