- Update to 0.9.5
  * Support Windows free-threading by @henryiii in #759
  * Strip whitespace around generator so that it's passed through
    correctly by @vyasr in #748
- Version 0.9.4
  * This version supports the newly available free-threading
    variant of Python 3.13b1 (mostly related to skipping the stable
    ABI). We test this via the manylinux/musllinux images. There's
    also a new feature requested by third-party packagers; the
    ability to pass args directly to the build tool
  * Add build.tool-args by @henryiii in #733
  ## Fixes:
  * Support free-threaded builds of Python 3.13+ on Linux by
    @henryiii in #741
  * Slightly better stable ABI behavior using PyPy by @henryiii in
    #741
- Version 0.9.3
  * This version ensures the Hatchling plugin correctly indicates
    editable mode is not yet supported, supports CMAKE_ARGS that
    have spaces, and has a bit of other minor cleanup.
  ## Fixes:
  * Properly indicate lack of editable support in Hatch plugin by
    @ofek in #728
  * Don't generate entrypoints.txt if none set by @henryiii in #729
  * Don't warn if lib not found on UNIX, just debug by @henryiii in
    #730
  * Support CMAKE_ARGS that may have spaces inside quotes by @vyasr
    in #727
- Version 0.9.2
  * Quick fix for quick fix in 0.9.1; if cmake is a broken script
    (which can happen if you pip install outside an environment
    then enter an environment, there was an unbound local error
    instead of ignoring the broken cmake script.)
  ## Fixes:
  * Unbound local error by @henryiii in #719
- Version 0.9.1
  * Quick fix for Pyodide (WebAssembly) builds.
  ## Fixes:
  * Try --version if -E capabilities fails by @henryiii in #717
- Version 0.9.0
  * This version adds the ability to inherit in override tables,
    matching a similar feature added to cibuildwheel 2.17's
    overrides. You can now write out extra metadata to
    ${SKBUILD_METADATA_DIR}. A new Hatchling plugin is provided as
    an experimental feature (will likely be made a separate package
    in the future like the setuptools plugin).
  * The meaning of wheel.exclude has been changed to match on the
    wheel path, rather than the source path. We could not find any
    projects that would be affected by this change, so it was not
    added to the minimum-version protection policy. This now allows
    you to ignore CMake outputs as well.
  ## Features:
  * Preserve additivity of cmake.define across overrides tables by
    @stubbiali in #564
  * Add metadata dir access by @henryiii in #702
  * Experimental hatchling builder by @henryiii and
    @aryamanjeendgar in #637
  * Vendor pyproject-metadata by @henryiii in #703
  * Always require pathspec by @henryiii in #711
  ## Fixes:
  * Exclude installed files if listed in exclude by @henryiii in
    #652
  * Make .git_archival.txt reproducible by @LecrisUT in #706
  * Use cmake -E capabilities instead of cmake --version by
    @KyleFromNVIDIA in #675
  * Ensure many/musl tags not selected by @henryiii in #698
  * purelib should set py3 tag if unset by @henryiii in #661
  * Validate description for 0.9+ by @henryiii in #709
  * Support bools in config settings by @henryiii in #712
  ## API changes:
  * extra_settings for SettingsReader by @henryiii in #697
  * GetRequires args changed by @henryiii in #699
  * Make from_file a little more powerful by @henryiii in #700
  * Metadata is part of the build backend by @henryiii in #708
- Version 0.8.2
  * This version fixes a few small issues related to configuration.
    The wheel tag is fixed when wheel.platlib is False, inplace
    editable installs ignore build-dir, and install-dir no longer
    affects the generate path.
  ## Fixes:
  * Ensure wheel.platlib being false sets <abi>-<platform> as
    "none-any" by @jcfr in #655
  * Inplace editable install should ignore build-dir by @henryiii
    in #644
  * install-dir shouldn't affect generate path by @henryiii in #654
  * Expand info printing by @henryiii in #651
- Version 0.8.1
  * This version fixes two small issues with specific situations:
    if ninja/cmake is present but not executable, and ninja on
    Windows not respecting the build type.
  ## Fixes:
  * Do not exit with exec permission error in ninja check by
    @thewtex in #626
  * Include CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE on Windows Ninja by @henryiii in #640
  * Use - vs _ in error message by @nbelakovski in #638
  * Make run command logged at info by @LecrisUT in #639
- Version 0.8.0
  * This version replaces the cmake/ninja minimum-version config
    option with a more powerful free-form version field.
    Scikit-build-core will now respect CMAKE_EXECUTABLE for finding
    CMake. You can override based on the build state, allowing
    overrides for editable installs, for example. You can specify a
    build tag (AKA build number). And you can define CMake
    variables from environment variables.
  ## Features:
  * Add build-tag by @henryiii in #612
  * Add if.state to overrides by @henryiii in #600
  * Add cmake.version and ninja.version by @henryiii in #602
  * Support CMAKE_EXECUTABLE by @henryiii in #603
  * Config to set CMake variables with environment variables by
    @stubbiali in #565
  ## Fixes:
  * Include license file entry in search by @henryiii in #601
  * Make sure purelib is indicated by @henryiii in #613
  * Project version should always be CMake parsable by @henryiii in
    #608
- Version 0.7.1
  * This is a quick fix for a downstream change in
    hatch-fancy-pypi-readme that broke our plugin wrapper.
  ## Fixes:
  * Patch for change in hatch-fancy-pypi-readme by @henryiii in
    #593
- Version 0.7.0
  * This release features several large improvements to overrides:
    a new if.any group to allow selections based on any item being
    true, and a new if.env option for selecting an override based
    on environment variables. You can now build pure Python
    packages with wheel.cmake = false, perfect for providing a
    slower pure Python version of a package on unsupported systems
    via overrides.
  * There's also a new inplace mode for editable installs, which
    has drawbacks but feels like the classic "--inplace" setting in
    setuptools and can enable some tooling that would otherwise not
    support modern editable installs to work. If you are using
    Cython to access .pxd files, modern ("redirect") editable
    installs now support that. And to help avoid collisions with a
    future user feature, config settings can now be passed with an
    optional namespace, skbuild., as well.
  ## Features:
  * Add inplace mode for editable installs by @henryiii in #553
  * Add wheel.exclude by @henryiii in #560
  * Support cmake-less runs (for overrides) by @henryiii in #550
  * Support if.any by @henryiii in #548
  * Support if.env by @henryiii in #549
  * Support namespaced config settings (skbuild.) by @henryiii in
    #556
  ## Fixes:
  * Correct issue with editable template & add more tests by
    @henryiii in #552
  * Support editable installs of Cython .pxd files by @vyasr in
    #516
- Version 0.6.1
  ## Fixes:
  * Editable package imports fix (regression in 0.6.0) by @henryiii
    in #546
  * Filter CMAKE_ARGS and debug printout by @henryiii in #543
- Version 0.6.0
  * This release features overrides, a system similar to mypy and
    cibuildwheel's overrides, allowing static configuration of
    special cases, like different settings per operating system or
    Python version ranges. It also features preliminary support for
    importlib.resources in editable mode.
  ## Features:
  * Adding overrides by @henryiii in #514
  * Overrides platform node by @0xTowel in #526
  * Support importlib.resources in editable installs by @LecrisUT
    in #399
  ## Fixes:
  * Better handling for -G by @henryiii in #483
  * Nicer error message when SCM version missing by @henryiii in
    #528
  * (schema) Fix a typo and better metadata support by @henryiii in
    #522
  * (setuptools) Remove DEBUG envvar by @henryiii in #527
- Version 0.5.1
  ## Features:
  * Add {build_type} and {state} to build-dir by @henryiii in #504
  * Include 'python' dir as an auto search path by @henryiii in
    #499
  ## Fixes:
  * Parse CMake version strings containing '-' by @jllllll in #508
  * Set NumPy include directory if known by @henryiii in #482
  * Adapt for setuptools_scm 8 writing change by @henryiii in #509
  * (setuptools) Support build_type set in toml by @henryiii in
    #498
- Version 0.5.0
  * This release sees the addition of a generated schema, which has
    also been contributed to SchemaStore, enabling
    tool.scikit-build to be understood by most editors. There's
    also now a way to enable CMake during the SDist step, a new
    regex plugin, and a mechanism to write metadata to a file
    without having to depend on the plugin.
  ## Features:
  * Add option to run CMake during SDist creation by @henryiii in
    #454
  * Add a schema for validate-pyproject by @henryiii in #447, #450,
    #455
  * Added regex plugin and dynamic-metadata rewrite by @henryiii in
    #457
  * Add configuration option to write metadata to file by @henryiii
    in #459
  ## Fixes:
  * Normalize sdist names by @henryiii in #434
  * Report cmake/ninja required if already present by @henryiii in
    #462
- Version 0.4.8
  * This release focus on two fixes that correct some interference
    issues with other setuptools plugins. A few new features were
    added (opt-in only): the ability to select build targets,
    install components, and opt-in --strip (will be opt-out in 0.5
    if the minimum-version is set to 0.5+ or unset).
  ## Features:
  * Add build target support by @henryiii in #432
  * Add component support and strip support by @henryiii in #430
  ## Fixes:
  * (setuptools) Avoid instantiating build too soon by @henryiii in
    #443
  * (setuptools) Avoid interfering with other setuptools plugins by
    @henryiii in #414
  * Only link to valid module paths (not things like gitignore) in
    editable installs by @henryiii in #444
