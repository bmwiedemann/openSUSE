%description
The toolkit is combined from two basic set of classes - core and external.
The core classes are coded in C and form a base line for every Prima object
written in perl. The usage of C is possible together with the toolkit;
however, its full power is revealed in the perl domain. The external
classes present easily expandable set of widgets, written completely in
perl and communicating with the system using Prima library calls.
