  <title>A Perl Module Proc::Fork - Simple, intuitive interface to the fork() system call</title>
  <description>This module provides an intuitive, Perl-ish way to write forking
programs by letting you use blocks to illustrate which code section
executes in which fork. The code for the parent, child, retry handler
and error handler are grouped together in a &quot;fork block&quot;. The clauses
may appear in any order, but they must be consecutive (without any
other statements in between).</description>
