-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 11 10:53:56 UTC 2022 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 3.5.0
  3.5.0 (2022-09-11)
  * Add support for generators and coroutines in the :obj:`hunter.wrap` decorator.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6.
  3.4.3 (2021-12-15)
  * Removed most of the Python 2 support code.
  * Fix some refactoring regression in ``setup.py`` and make the 3.4.x series installable only on Python 3.6 and later.
  * Yank 3.4.0, 3.4.1, 3.4.2 releases to avoid install problems on Python 2.7.
  3.4.2 (2021-12-15)
  * Fixed CI to properly make win32 wheels.
  3.4.1 (2021-12-14)
  * Add support for building a ``pp37.pp38`` tagged wheel
    (basically an universal wheel installable just for those two PyPy versions).
  3.4.0 (2021-12-14)
  * Switched CI to GitHub Actions, this has a couple consequences:
    * Support for Python 2.7 is dropped. You can still install it there but it's not tested anymore and
      Python 2 specific handling will be removed at some point.
    * Linux wheels are now provided in `musllinux` and `manylinux2014` variants.
  * Extension building is now completely skipped on PyPy.
  * A pure but tagged as platform specific wheel is now provided for PyPy (to have fast installs there as well).
