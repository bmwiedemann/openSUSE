      overwriting.
- from v0.2.7
  * compat
    + cache_from_source is now imported from importlib.util where
      available.
  * database

      is a list of top-level modules as read from top_level.txt, if that is in
      the distribution info.
  * locators
    + Fixed #103: Thanks to Saulius Žemaitaitis for the patch.
  * metadata
    + Added support for PEP 566 / Metadata 1.3.
