Thu Jan 16 08:42:35 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 2.8.1:
  * Updated tzdata version to 2019c.
  * Fixed a race condition in the tzoffset and tzstr "strong"
    caches on Python 2.7. Reported by @kainjow (gh issue #901).
  * Parsing errors will now raise ParserError, a subclass of
    ValueError, which has a nicer string representation. Patch by
    @gfyoung (gh pr #881).
  * parser.parse will now raise TypeError when tzinfos is passed a
    type that cannot be interpreted as a time zone. Prior to this
    change, it would raise an UnboundLocalError instead. Patch by
    @jbrockmendel (gh pr #891).
  * Changed error message raised when when passing a bytes object as
    the time zone name to gettz in Python 3. Reported and fixed by
    @labrys () (gh issue #927, gh pr #935).
  * Changed compatibility logic to support a potential Python 4.0
    release. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade (gh pr #950).
  * Updated many modules to use tz.UTC in favor of tz.tzutc()
    internally, to avoid an unnecessary function call. (gh pr #910).
  * Fixed issue where dateutil.tz was using a backported version of
    contextlib.nullcontext even in Python 3.7 due to a malformed
    import statement. (gh pr #963).

Thu Feb 21 11:00:12 UTC 2019 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to 2.8.0 (2019-02-04)
  + Data updates
    * Updated tzdata version to to 2018i.
  + Features
    * Added support for EXDATE parameters when parsing rrule
      strings. Reported by @mlorant (gh issue #410), fixed by
      @nicoe (gh pr #859).
    * Added support for sub-minute time zone offsets in Python
      3.6+. Fixed by @cssherry (gh issue #582, pr #763)
    * Switched the tzoffset, tzstr and gettz caches over to using
      weak references, so that the cache expires when no other
      references to the original tzinfo objects exist. This cache-
      expiry behavior is not guaranteed in the public interface and
      may change in the future. To improve performance in the case
      where transient references to the same time zones are
      repeatedly created but no strong reference is continuously
      held, a smaller “strong value” cache was also added. Weak
      value cache implemented by @cs-cordero (gh pr #672, #801),
      strong cache added by Gökçen Nurlu (gh issue #691, gh pr
      #761)
  + Bugfixes
    * Added time zone inference when initializing an rrule with a
      specified UNTIL but without an explicitly specified DTSTART;
      the time zone of the generated DTSTART will now be taken from
      the UNTIL rule. Reported by @href (gh issue #652). Fixed by
      @absreim (gh pr #693).
    * Fixed an issue where parser.parse would raise Decimal-
      specific errors instead of a standard ValueError if certain
      malformed values were parsed (e.g. NaN or infinite values).
      Reported and fixed by @amureki (gh issue #662, gh pr #679).
    * Fixed issue in parser where a tzinfos call explicitly
      returning None would throw a ValueError. Fixed by @parsethis
      (gh issue #661, gh pr #681)
    * Fixed incorrect parsing of certain dates earlier than 100 AD
      when repesented in the form “%B.%Y.%d”, e.g.
      “December.0031.30”. (gh issue #687, pr #700)
    * Add support for ISO 8601 times with comma as the decimal
      separator in the dateutil.parser.isoparse function. (gh pr
      #721)
    * Changed handling of T24:00 to be compliant with the standard.
      T24:00 now represents midnight on the following day. Fixed by
      @cheukting (gh issue #658, gh pr #751)
    * Fixed an issue where isoparser.parse_isotime was unable to
      handle the 24:00 variant representation of midnight. (gh pr
      #773)
    * Added support for more than 6 fractional digits in isoparse.
      Reported and fixed by @jayschwa (gh issue #786, gh pr #787).
    * Added ‘z’ (lower case Z) as valid UTC time zone in isoparser.
      Reported by @cjgibson (gh issue #820). Fixed by @Cheukting
      (gh pr #822)
    * Fixed a bug with base offset changes during DST in tzfile,
      and refactored the way base offset changes are detected.
      Originally reported on StackOverflow by @MartinThoma. (gh
      issue #812, gh pr #810)
    * Fixed error condition in tz.gettz when a non-ASCII timezone
      is passed on Windows in Python 2.7. (gh issue #802, pr #861)
    * Improved performance and inspection properties of tzname
      methods. (gh pr #811)
    * Removed unnecessary binary_type compatibility shims. Added by
      @jdufresne (gh pr #817)
    * Changed python setup.py test to print an error to stderr and
      exit with 1 instead of 0. Reported and fixed by @hroncok (gh
      pr #814)
    * Added a pyproject.toml file with build requirements and an
      explicitly specified build backend. (gh issue #736, gh prs
      #746, #863)

    equality with tzoffset and tzutc. (gh pr #598)
  * Deprecated the idiosyncratic tzstr format mentioned in several examples but
    evidently designed exclusively for dateutil, and very likely not used by
    any current users. (gh issue #595, gh pr #606)

    an imaginary one, if necessary. Implemented by @Cheukting (gh issue #339,
    gh pr #607)

    a version number from the git metadata. Reported by @jreback (gh issue #511),
    implemented by @Sulley38 (gh pr #564)
  * Switched setup.py to use find_packages, and started testing against pip
    installed versions of dateutil in CI. Fixed issue with parser import
    discovered by @jreback in pandas-dev/pandas#18141. (gh issue #507, pr #509)
  * Switched test suite to using pytest (gh pr #495)
  * Switched CI over to use tox. Fixed by @gaborbernat (gh pr #549)

- Update to version 2.6.0
  * Added PEP-495-compatible methods to address ambiguous and 
    imaginary dates in time zones in a backwards-compatible
    way. Ambiguous dates and times can now be safely represented
    by all dateutil time zones. Many thanks to Alexander
    Belopolski (@abalkin) and Tim Peters @tim-one for their 
    inputs on how to address this. Original issues reported by
    Yupeng and @zed (lP: 1390262, gh issues #57, #112, #249,
    #284, #286, prs #127, #225, #248, #264, #302).
  * Added new methods for working with ambiguous and imaginary 
    dates to the tz module. datetime_ambiguous() determines if
    a datetime is ambiguous for a given zone and datetime_exists()
    determines if a datetime exists in a given zone.
    This works for all fold-aware datetimes, not just those 
    provided by dateutil. (gh issue #253, gh pr #302)
  * Fixed an issue where dst() in Portugal in 1996 was 
    returning the wrong value  in tz.tzfile objects. Reported
    by @abalkin (gh issue #128,  pr #225)
  * Fixed an issue where zoneinfo.ZoneInfoFile errors were not 
    being properly deep-copied. (gh issue #226, pr #225)
  * Refactored tzwin and tzrange as a subclass of a common 
    class, tzrangebase, as there was substantial overlapping
    functionality. As part of this change, tzrange and tzstr
    now expose a transitions() function, which returns the
    DST on and off transitions for a given year. (gh issue 
    #260, pr #302)
  * Deprecated zoneinfo.gettz() due to confusion with 
    tz.gettz(), in favor of get() method of
    zoneinfo.ZoneInfoFile objects. (gh issue #11, pr #310)
  * For non-character, non-stream arguments, parser.parse now 
    raises TypeError instead of AttributeError. (gh issues
    #171, #269, pr #247)
  * Fixed an issue where tzfile objects were not properly 
    handling dst() and tzname() when attached to
    datetime.time objects. Reported by @ovacephaloid.
    (gh issue #292, pr #309)
  * /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo was added to TZPATHS for 
    compatibility with Solaris systems. Reported by @dhduvall
    (gh issue #276, pr #307)
  * tzoffset and tzrange objects now accept either a number of 
    seconds or a datetime.timedelta() object wherever
    previously only a  number of seconds was allowed.
    (gh pr #264, #277)
  * datetime.timedelta objects can now be added to 
    relativedelta objects. Reported and added by Alec Nikolas
    Reiter (@justanr) (gh issue #282, pr #283
  * Refactored relativedelta.weekday and rrule.weekday into a 
    common base class to reduce code duplication.
    (gh issue #140, pr #311)
  * An issue where the WKST parameter was improperly rendering 
    in str(rrule) was reported and fixed by Daniel LePage
    (@dplepage). (gh issue  #262, pr #263)
  * A replace() method has been added to rrule objects by 
    @jendas1, which creates new rrule with modified attributes,
    analogous to datetime.replace (gh pr #167)
  * Made some significant performance improvements to rrule 
    objects in Python 2.x (gh pr #245)
  * All classes defining equality functions now return 
    NotImplemented when  compared to unsupported classes,
    rather than raising TypeError, to allow other classes to
    provide fallback support. (gh pr #236)
  * Several classes have been marked as explicitly unhashable 
    to maintain identical behavior between Python 2 and 3.
    Submitted by Roy Williams (@rowillia) (gh pr #296)
  * Trailing whitespace in easter.py has been removed. 
    Submitted by @OmgImAlexis (gh pr #299)
  * Windows-only batch files in build scripts had line endings 
    switched to CRLF. (gh pr #237)
  * @adamchainz updated the documentation links to reflect 
    that the canonical location for readthedocs links is now
    at .io, not .org. (gh pr #272)
  * Made some changes to the CI and codecov to test against 
    newer versions of Python and pypy, and to adjust the code
    coverage  requirements. For the moment, full pypy3
    compatibility is not supported until a new release is
    available, due to upstream bugs in the old version
    affecting PEP-495 support. (gh prs #265, #266, #304, #308)
  * The full PGP signing key fingerprint was added to the 
    README.md in favor of the previously used long-id.
    Reported by @valholl (gh issue #287, pr #304)
  * Updated zoneinfo to 2016i. (gh issue #298, gh pr #306)

- update url in specfile
- use sed to eliminate MS-DOS style end of lines

- update to version 2.4.2:
  * Updated zoneinfo to 2015b.
  * Fixed issue with parsing of tzstr on Python 2.7.x; tzstr will now
    be decoded if not a unicode type. gh #51 (lp:1331576), gh pr #55.
  * Fix a parser issue where AM and PM tokens were showing up in fuzzy
    date stamps, triggering inappropriate errors. gh #56 (lp:
    1428895), gh pr #63.
  * Missing function "setcachsize" removed from zoneinfo __all__ list
    by @ryanss, fixing an issue with wildcard imports of
    dateutil.zoneinfo. (gh pr #66).
  * (PyPi only) Fix an issue with source distributions not including
    the test suite.

- changes from version 2.4.1:
  * Added explicit check for valid hours if AM/PM is specified in
    parser. (gh pr #22, issue #21)
  * Fix bug in rrule introduced in 2.4.0 where byweekday parameter was
    not handled properly. (gh pr #35, issue #34)
  * Fix error where parser allowed some invalid dates, overwriting
    existing hours with the last 2-digit number in the string. (gh pr
    #32, issue #31)
  * Fix and add test for Python 2.x compatibility with boolean
    checking of relativedelta objects. Implemented by @nimasmi (gh pr
    #43) and Céic Krier (lp: 1035038)
  * Replaced parse() calls with explicit datetime objects in unit
    tests unrelated to parser. (gh pr #36)
  * Changed private _byxxx from sets to sorted tuples and fixed one
    currently unreachable bug in _construct_byset. (gh pr #54)
  * Additional documentation for parser (gh pr #29, #33, #41) and
    rrule.
  * Formatting fixes to documentation of rrule and README.rst.
  * Updated zoneinfo to 2015a.

- changes from version 2.4.0:
  * Fix an issue with relativedelta and freezegun (lp:1374022)
  * Fix tzinfo in windows for timezones without dst (lp:1010050, gh
    #2)
  * Ignore missing timezones in windows like in POSIX

    #14 #17), including defusing some infinite loops (gh #4)

- changes from version 2.3:
  * Cleanup directory structure, moved test.py to
    dateutil/tests/test.py
  * Changed many aspects of dealing with the zone info file. Instead
    of a cache, all the zones are loaded to memory, but symbolic links
    are loaded only once, so not much memory is used.
  * The package is now zip-safe, and universal-wheelable, thanks to
    changes in the handling of the zoneinfo file.
  * Fixed tzwin silently not imported on windows python2
  * New maintainer, together with new hosting: GitHub, Travis,
    Read-The-Docs
