- Update to version 2.0.0:
  - This release primarily updates core myst-parser dependencies, with
    some minor changes to parsing behaviour:
    - UPGRADE: markdown-it-py to v3 (#773)
      - This is mainly a non-breaking change, fixing some edge cases in parsing
      - See: https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py/releases/tag/v3.0.0
      - and https://github.com/executablebooks/mdit-py-plugins/releases/tag/v0.4.0
    - UPGRADE: linkify-it-py to v2 (#675)
      - Also fixes some edge cases in parsing
      - See: https://github.com/tsutsu3/linkify-it-py/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
    - UPGRADE: Add support for docutils v0.20 (#775)
      - No significant changes, see https://docutils.sourceforge.io/RELEASE-NOTES.html#release-0-20-2023-05-04
    - UPGRADE: Add support for sphinx v7, and remove v5 support (#776)
      - No significant changes, see https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/changes.html
    - UPGRADE: Remove Python 3.7 support and add testing for Python
      3.11 (#772)
    - Improve default slug generation for heading anchors, thanks to
      @Cimbali (#777)
      - This change makes the slug generation closer to GitHub, in
        that, starting/ending whitespace will not be stripped.
      - For example, # ` a` b `c ` will now correctly create the slug
        -a-b-c- and not a-b-c
    - IMPROVE: Substitution extension (#777)
      - Allow any value type (including dict, list, datetime) and emit
        a myst.substitution warning for errors in resolving the
        substitution content.
    - Introduce a gate/check GHA job, thanks to @webknjaz (#635)
