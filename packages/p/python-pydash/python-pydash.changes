- Update to version 6.0.2
  * Only prevent access to object paths containing ``__globals__`` or
    ``__builtins__`` instead of all dunder-methods for non-dict/list
    objects.
- from version 6.0.1
  * Fix exception raised due to mishandling of non-string keys in functions
    like ``get()`` for non-dict/list objects that used integer index references
    like ``"[0]"``.
- from version 6.0.0
  * Prevent access to object paths containing dunder-methods in functions like
    ``get()`` for non-dict/list objects. Attempting to access dunder-methods
    using get-path keys will raise a ``KeyError`` (e.g. ``get(SomeClass(),
    '__init__'`` will raise). Access to dict keys are unaffected (e.g.
    ``get({"__init__": True}, "__init__")`` will return ``True``).
    (**breaking change**)
  * Add support for Python 3.11.
  * Drop support for Python 3.6 (**breaking change**)
- from version 5.1.2
  * Remove unnecessary type check and conversion for ``exceptions``
    argument in ``pydash.retry``.
- from version 5.1.1
  * Add support for Python 3.10.
  * Fix timing assertion issue in test for ``pydash.delay`` where it could
    fail on certain environments.
- Switch build system from setuptools to pyproject.toml
- Update BuildRequires from pyproject.toml

  -------------------
  - Fix compatibility issue between ``pydash.py_`` / ``pydash._`` and ``typing.Protocol`` + ``typing.runtime_checkable``

  v5.0.1 (2021-06-27)
  -------------------

  v5.0.0 (2021-03-29)
  -------------------
  - Drop support for Python 2.7. (**breaking change**)
  - Improve Unicode word splitting in string functions to be inline with Lodash. Thanks mervynlee94_! (**breaking change**)

    - ``snake_case``
    - ``start_case``
    - ``upper_case``

  v4.9.3 (2021-03-03)
  -------------------
  - Fix regression introduced in ``v4.8.0`` that caused ``merge`` and ``merge_with`` to raise an exception when passing ``None`` 
    as the first argument.
  v4.9.2 (2020-12-24)
  -------------------
  - Fix regression introduced in ``v4.9.1`` that broke ``pydash.get`` for dictionaries and dot-delimited keys that reference

  -------------------
  - Fix bug in ``get/has`` that caused ``defaultdict`` objects to get populated on key access.
  v4.9.0 (2020-10-27)
  -------------------
  - Add ``default_to_any``. Thanks gonzalonaveira_!
  - Fix mishandling of key names containing ``\.`` in ``set_``, ``set_with``, and ``update_with`` where the ``.`` was not
    treated as a literal value within the key name. Thanks zhaowb_!
- python-mock is not required for build
