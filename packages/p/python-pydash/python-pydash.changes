Wed Feb  5 13:06:20 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 8.0.5
  * Fix bug that could result in passing too many arguments to
    callback functions when the callback contained a var-keyword
    or keyword-only arguments.
- from version 8.0.4
  * Fix bug in ``zip_object`` and ``zip_object_deep`` where an
    empty list for keys/values would cause an exception instead
    of returning an empty dict.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 18 17:19:27 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 8.0.3:
  * Specify explicit type parameters for all type annotations.
    Thanks DeviousStoat!
  * Fix typing issue in map_ for compatability with chain. Thanks
    DeviousStoat!
  * Fix issue where too many arguments were passed to stdlib's
    operator.attrgetter, operator.itemgetter, and
    operator.methodcaller when instances of those classes were
    used as callbacks to functions like map_, filter_, etc. due
    to a bug introduced in Python 3.12.3 and 3.11.9 that reported
    an incorrect signature for those operator class instances.

Wed Apr  3 01:30:20 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 8.0.0:
  * Add functions:
    + apply_catch, apply_if, apply_if_not_none, eq_cmp, gt_cmp
    + gte_cmp, in_range_cmp, is_equal_cmp, is_equal_with_cmp
    + is_instance_of_cmp, is_match_cmp, is_match_with_cmp
    + is_monotone_cmp, lt_cmp, lte_cmp
  * Rename function thru to apply.
  * Changed zip_, unzip, zip_with, unzip_with and to_pairs to accept
    iterables of tuples instead of lists and return lists of tuples
    instead of lists of lists.
  * Fixed bug in divide, multiply, and subtract that returned the wrong
    result when 0 was used as one of the operation values.
  * Fix bug in function wrappers that incorrectly computed the number of
    arguments the wrapped function could handle.
  * Fix bug in set_ where the incorrect object type, list instead of dict,
    was initialized on class attributes.
  * Drop support for Python 3.7.
  * Fix typing for chaining interface for methods that use varargs.
  * Fix typing for find_index and find_last_index by allowing predicate
    argument to be callback shorthand values.
  * Fix typing for difference_by, intersection_by, union_by, uniq_by,
    and xor_by by allowing iteratee argument to be `Any`.
  * Fix missing install dependency, typing-extensions, for package.
  * Add type annotations to package.
  * Change behavior of to_dict to not using dict() internally.
  * Change behavior of slugify to remove single-quotes from output.
  * Add support for negative indexes in get path keys.
- Switch to autosetup macro.
- No more greedy globs in %files.

Tue Mar  5 09:17:48 UTC 2024 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Switch package to modern Python Stack on SLE-15
  + Add %{?sle15_python_module_pythons}
  + Drop %{?!python_module:%define python_module() python-%{**} python3-%{**}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 16 10:07:57 UTC 2023 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 6.0.2
  * Only prevent access to object paths containing ``__globals__`` or
    ``__builtins__`` instead of all dunder-methods for non-dict/list
    objects.
- from version 6.0.1
  * Fix exception raised due to mishandling of non-string keys in functions
    like ``get()`` for non-dict/list objects that used integer index references
    like ``"[0]"``.
- from version 6.0.0
  * Prevent access to object paths containing dunder-methods in functions like
    ``get()`` for non-dict/list objects. Attempting to access dunder-methods
    using get-path keys will raise a ``KeyError`` (e.g. ``get(SomeClass(),
    '__init__'`` will raise). Access to dict keys are unaffected (e.g.
    ``get({"__init__": True}, "__init__")`` will return ``True``).
    (**breaking change**)
  * Add support for Python 3.11.
  * Drop support for Python 3.6 (**breaking change**)
- from version 5.1.2
  * Remove unnecessary type check and conversion for ``exceptions``
    argument in ``pydash.retry``.
- from version 5.1.1
  * Add support for Python 3.10.
  * Fix timing assertion issue in test for ``pydash.delay`` where it could
    fail on certain environments.
- Switch build system from setuptools to pyproject.toml
- Update BuildRequires from pyproject.toml
