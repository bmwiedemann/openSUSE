# This adds a run-time dependency on package
#    qml6-module-qtquick-dialogs (on Debian).

    page to avoid a bug in Qt that made the text sometimes
    disappear if a navigation link was pressed with a scrolled

- Update to version 21.0
  * New help viewer implementation, which includes DocBook files
    in the resources. This avoids using an external browser, which
    did not work with all installation directories on Ubuntu 21.10
    because Firefox and Chromium have restricted access to local

    architectures or in Qt 6.0/6.1.
