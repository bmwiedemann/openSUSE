Mon Mar  6 19:08:27 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 23.0
  * Use native file dialogs on Linux to make loading and saving of
    games work with flatpak.
# This adds a run-time dependency on package
#    qml6-module-qtquick-dialogs (on Debian).
  * Prefix MIME config and icons with io.sourceforge.pentobi, such
    that registering Pentobi as an app for its game files works
    with flatpak.
  * Removed option to disable animations.
  * Removed menu item Open Clipboard.
  * Require C++ compiler with C++20 support.
  * Minimum required Qt version is now 6.4
  * Removed custom CMake module to find path of Docbook XSL and let
    the local XML catalog do the mapping between URL and path.
  * Don't initialize move number dialog with current move but show
    it as placeholder text.
- Update to version 22.0
  * Fixed game analysis hanging on some platforms.
  * Don't use custom menu implementation, which caused problems in
    dark mode on Android and KDE 5. As a consequence, shortcuts
    are no longer shown on the menu but documented in the Pentobi
    manual.
  * Made navigation links in help viewer part of the scrollable
    page to avoid a bug in Qt that made the text sometimes
    disappear if a navigation link was pressed with a scrolled
    page.
  * Help window shortcuts stopped working after mouse click with
    Qt 6.4.

Wed May 18 07:01:57 UTC 2022 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 21.0
  * New help viewer implementation, which includes DocBook files
    in the resources. This avoids using an external browser, which
    did not work with all installation directories on Ubuntu 21.10
    because Firefox and Chromium have restricted access to local
    files, or using WebView, which is not supported on all Linux
    architectures or in Qt 6.0/6.1.
  * Fixed visibility of labels on Callisto 1x1-piece in dark theme.
  * Fixed rendering issues on Android with Qt 6.3.0.

  * Install application and mimetype bitmap icons for multiple
    sizes.
  * Show error message if launching web browser failed.
  * Minimum required CMake version is now 3.18.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    syntax.

    PENTOBI_OPEN_HELP_EXTERNALLY.

  * Loading game files in encodings other than UTF-8 is no
    longer supported.
