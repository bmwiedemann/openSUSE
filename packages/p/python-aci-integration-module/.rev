    <comment>- Fixed up the SPEC file so that the build can succeed with the
  upstream tarball. Otherwise, the tarball needs to be generated
  from the &quot;python setup.py sdist&quot; command.
- Switch to the upstream tarball as is required by our policies
- Remove useless patch 0001_manifest_alembic_addition.patch
- Do not remove requirements file in the prep phase
- Specify the package group
- Make sure we execute unittests, for now skipped
- Format the spec file using spec-cleaner to get unified look and
  normal whitespace
- Changelog should be named the same as spec-file
- Changelog should be in an order timewise
- Changelog should not contain any patch lines
- Added a patch to include alembic migration files 
- run format-spec file and fix requires
- Spec file changes:
    - Added the LICENSE file to the package.
    - Synced the Requires list with requirements.txt.
    - Eliminated the RPMlint error on duplicate files.
    - Eliminated as many RPMlint warnings as possible.
- Renamed aci-integration-module to python-aci-integration-module.
  Thus renamed the spec file. And made the spec file singlespec.
- Built source package directly from source 
    - removed manual steps for the build
    - Upgraded to version 0.14.3
- Change the .spec file to build python-aci-integration-module
  * Made it conform to singlespec standards, but only build python2
    packages.
  * made other cleanups to the spec file.
- Corrected spelling in spec file: python-sqlalchemy should be
  python-SQLAlchemy.
- License should be Apache-2.0 according to the LICENSE file
  in the aci-integration-module-0.10.0.tar.gz.
- Upgraded to 0.10.0
  - for use with openstack Pike
- Fixed Requires python-acitoolkit
- Fixed Requires for python-oslo.config
- Initial Packaging (version 0.3.0)
