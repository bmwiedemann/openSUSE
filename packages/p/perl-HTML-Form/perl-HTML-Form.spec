%description
Objects of the 'HTML::Form' class represents a single HTML '<form> ...
</form>' instance. A form consists of a sequence of inputs that usually
have names, and which can take on various values. The state of a form can
be tweaked and it can then be asked to provide HTTP::Request objects that
can be passed to the request() method of LWP::UserAgent.
