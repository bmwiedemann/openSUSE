  <title>Parse a distribution name</title>
  <description>Parse::Distname is yet another distribution name parser. It works almost the same as CPAN::DistnameInfo, but Parse::Distname takes a different approach. It tries to extract a version part of a distribution and treat the rest as a distribution name, contrary to CPAN::DistnameInfo which tries to define a name part and treat the rest as a version.</description>
