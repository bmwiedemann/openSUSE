- Update to 1.6.0:
  * ``execnet`` no longer supports Python 2.6 and 3.3 (#85). Users of those Python versions
    using a recent enough ``pip`` should not be affected, as ``pip`` will only install
    ``1.5.0`` for them.
  * Update test suite to support ``pytest>4``.
- Remove pytest4.patch merged upstream
- Remove fix_apipkg.patch merged upstream

  * CHANGELOG -> CHANGELOG.rst
  * README.txt -> README.rst

- update to version 1.5.0:
  * support shell escaping in python pathnames of popen.
    Eugene Ciurana discovered that execnet breaks if you use pathnames
    with spaces in a "python=" part of a spec. We now use shlex.split
    to split the string.  There is a potential for regressions if you
    used quote or escape sequences as part of your python command.
  * Only insert importdir into sys.path if it is not already in the
    path.
    This prevents a bug when using enum34 with python 3.6 and
    pytest-xdist.
    The issue is that enum34 installs an 'enum' module in
    site-packages which is normally shadowed by the stdlib version of
    enum, however in gateway_bootstrap.py site-packages is added at
    the front the the search path. This means on the workers enum34 is
    hit for import enum which in turn causes import re to fail (as it
    makes use of the new enum features in 3.6).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 22 17:27:02 UTC 2016 - osynge@suse.com

- Update to version 1.4.1:
  * fix issue33 -- index.txt to correctly mention MIT instead of GPL.
  * fix issue35 -- adapt some doctests, fix some channel tests for py3.
  * use subprocess32 when available for python < 3.
  * try to be a bit more careful when interpreter is shutting down
    to avoid random exceptions, thanks Alfredo Deza.
  * ignore errors on orphan file removal when rsyncing
  * fix issue34 -- limit use of import based bootstrap
  * de-vendor apipkg and use the pypi dependency instead
    (this also fixes the bpython interaction issues)
  * Fix issue38: provide ability to connect to Vagrant VMs easily
    using :code:`vagrant_ssh=defaut` or :code:`vagrant_ssh=machinename`
    this feature is experimental and will be refined in future releases.
    Thanks Christian Theune for the discussion and the initial pull request.
  * add support for serializing the "complex" type. Thanks Sebastian
    Koslowski.
  * fix a regression of the Serializer created by the implied opcode ordering
    which resulted in a incompatible opcode mapping

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 12 20:06:01 UTC 2014 - tbechtold@suse.com

- Update to version 1.2:
  * fix issue22 -- during interpreter shutdown don't throw
    an exception when we can't send a termination sequence
    anymore as we are about to die anyway.
  * fix issue24 -- allow concurrent creation of gateways
    by guarding automatic id creation by a look.
    Thanks tlecomte.
  * majorly refactor internal thread and IO handling.
    execnet can now operate on different thread models,
    defaults to "thread" but allows for eventlet and
    gevent if it is installed.
  * gateway.remote_exec() will now execute in multiple
    threads on the other side by default.  The previous
    neccessity of running "gateway.remote_init_threads()"
    to allow for such concurrency is gone.  The latter
    method is now a no-op and will be removed in future
    versions of execnet.
  * fix issue20: prevent AttributError at interpreter shutdown
    by not trying to send close/last_message messages if the
    world around is half destroyed.
  * fix issue21: allow to create local gateways with sudo aka
    makegateway("popen//python=sudo python").
    Thanks Alfredo Deza for the PR.
  * streamline gateway termination and simplify proxy
    implementation. add more internal tracing.
  * if execution hangs in computation, we now try to
    send a SIGINT to ourselves on Unix platforms
    instead of just calling thread.interrupt_main()
  * change license from GPL to MIT
  * introduce execnet.dump/load variants of dumps/loads
    serializing/unserializing mechanism.
  * improve channel.receive() communication latency on python2
    by changing the default timeout of the underlying Queue.get
    to a regular None instead of the previous default -1
    which caused an internal positive timeout value
    (a hack probably introduced to allow CTRL-C to pass
    through for <python2.5 versions).
  * extended ssh-syntax to allow passing of command line args,
    e.g.  "ssh= -p 50 hostname". The options are passed to
    the underlying ssh client binary.  Thanks tundish.
  * fix issue15: interoperability with inspect.getstack().
    Thanks Peter Feiner.
  * fix issue10 : skip PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE test if
    it we are running with PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE set.
  * dont try the jython pid fixup on a RemoteIO
  * avoid accidentally setting exc_info() in gateway_base.py
