- update to 24.8.0:
  * Add .gitkeep as an ignored filename.
  * Config ignore option now supports wildcard matching via
    fnmatch.
  * Add a config for enforcing issue names using regex.
  * The template file is now ignored based only on the file name.
  * Control of the header formatting is once again completely up
    to the user when they are writing markdown files (fixes a
    regression introduced in
    [#610](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier/pull/610)).
  * Fixed an issue where issue_template failed recognizing the
    issue name of files with a non-category suffix (.md)
  * Fixed a bug where orphan news fragments (e.g.
    +abc1234.feature) would fail when an issue_pattern is
    configured. Orphan news fragments are now excempt from
    issue_pattern checks.
  * Moved towncrier version definition from
    src/towncrier/_version.py to pyproject.toml
    towncrier.__version__ was removed, after being deprecated in
    23.6.0. (#640)
  * #640, #657
  * When the template file is stored in the same directory with
    the news fragments, it is automatically ignored when checking
    for valid fragment file names.
  * #629, #630
  * towncrier build now handles removing news fragments which are
    not part of the git repository. For example, uncommitted or
    unstaged files. (#357)
  * Inferring the version of a Python package now tries to use
    the metadata of the installed package before importing the
    package explicitly (which only looks for
    [package].__version__). (#432)
  * If no filename is given when doing towncrier create,
    interactively ask for the issue number and fragment type (and
    then launch an interactive editor for the fragment content).
    Now by default, when creating a fragment it will be appended
    with the filename option's extension (unless an extension is
    explicitly provided). For example, towncrier create
    123.feature will create news/123.feature.rst. This can be
    changed in configuration file by setting add_extension =
    false. A new line is now added by default to the end of the
    fragment contents. This can be reverted in the configuration
    file by setting add_newline = false. (#482)
  * The temporary file towncrier create creates now uses the
    correct .rst or .md extension, which may help your editor
    with with syntax highlighting. (#594)
  * Running towncrier will now traverse back up directories
    looking for the configuration file. (#601)
  * The towncrier create action now uses sections defined in your
    config (either interactively, or via the new --section
    option). (#603)
  * News fragments are now sorted by issue number even if they
    have non-digit characters. For example:  - some issue (gh-3,
    gh-10) - another issue (gh-4) - yet another issue (gh-11)
    The sorting algorithm groups the issues first by non-text
    characters and then by number. (#608)
  * The title_format configuration option now uses a markdown
    format for markdown templates. (#610)
  * newsfragment categories can now be marked with check = false,
    causing them to be ignored in towncrier check (#617)
  * towncrier check will now fail if any news fragments have
    invalid filenames. Added a new configuration option called
    ignore that allows you to specify a list of filenames that
    should be ignored. If this is set, towncrier build will also
    fail if any filenames are invalid, except for those in the
    list. (#622)
  * Add explicit encoding to read_text.
  * The default Markdown template now renders a title containing
    the release version and date, even when the name
    configuration is left empty.
  * Orphan news fragments, fragments not associated with an
    issue, consisting of only digits (e.g. '+12345678.feature')
    now retain their leading marker character.
  * Orphan news fragments, fragments not associated with an
    issue, will now still show in categories that are marked to
    not show content, since they do not have an issue number to
    show.
  * Clarify version discovery behavior.
  * The tutorial now introduces the filename option in the
    appropriate paragraph and mentions its default value.
  * Add docs to explain how towncrier create +.feature.rst
    (orphan fragments) works.
  * #491, #561, #562, #568, #569, #571, #574, #575, #582, #591,
    #596, #597, #625
  * build now treats a missing fragments directory the same as an
    empty one, consistent with other operations.

- update to 23.11.0:
  * Fragments with filenames like fix-1.2.3.feature are now
    associated with the ticket fix-1.2.3. In previous versions
    they were incorrectly associated to ticket 3.
  * Orphan newsfragments containing numeric values are no longer
    accidentally associated to tickets. In previous versions the
    orphan marker was ignored and the newsfragment was associated
    to a ticket having the last numerical value from the
    filename.
  * No significant changes since the previous release candidate.
  * Python 3.12 is now officially supported. (#541)
  * Python 3.12 is now officially supported.
  * Initial support was added for monorepo-style setup. One
    project with multiple independent news files stored in
    separate sub-directories, that share the same towncrier
    config. (#548)
  * Initial support was added for monorepo-style setup. One
    project with multiple independent news files stored in
    separate sub-directories, that share the same towncrier
    config.
  * Two newlines are no longer always added between the current
    release notes and the previous content. The newlines are now
    defined only inside the template. Important! If you're using
    a custom template and want to keep the same whitespace
    between releases, you may have to modify your template.
    (#552)
  * Two newlines are no longer always added between the current
    release notes and the previous content. The newlines are now
    defined only inside the template.
  * The support for Python 3.7 has been dropped.
  * Provide a default Markdown template if the configured
    filename ends with .md.
  * Towncrier no longer depends on setuptools & uses
    importlib.resources (or its backport) instead. (#496)
  * Towncrier no longer depends on setuptools & uses
    importlib.resources (or its backport) instead.
  * Calling towncrier check without an existing configuration,
    will just show only an error message. In previous versions, a
    traceback was generated instead of the error message. (#501)
  * Calling towncrier check without an existing configuration,
    will just show only an error message.
  * In previous versions, a traceback was generated instead of
    the error message.
  * No changes since the previous release candidate.
  * Added --keep option to the build command that allows
    generating a newsfile, but keeps the newsfragments in place.
    This option can not be used together with --yes. (#129)
  * Added --keep option to the build command that allows
    generating a newsfile, but keeps the newsfragments in place.
    This option can not be used together with --yes.
  * Python 3.11 is now officially supported.
