    <comment>- update to 23.11.0:
  * Fragments with filenames like fix-1.2.3.feature are now
    associated with the ticket fix-1.2.3. In previous versions
    they were incorrectly associated to ticket 3.
  * Orphan newsfragments containing numeric values are no longer
    accidentally associated to tickets. In previous versions the
    orphan marker was ignored and the newsfragment was associated
    to a ticket having the last numerical value from the
    filename.
  * No significant changes since the previous release candidate.
  * Python 3.12 is now officially supported. (#541)
  * Python 3.12 is now officially supported.
  * Initial support was added for monorepo-style setup. One
    project with multiple independent news files stored in
    separate sub-directories, that share the same towncrier
    config. (#548)
  * Initial support was added for monorepo-style setup. One
    project with multiple independent news files stored in
    separate sub-directories, that share the same towncrier
    config.
  * Two newlines are no longer always added between the current
    release notes and the previous content. The newlines are now
    defined only inside the template. Important! If you're using
    a custom template and want to keep the same whitespace
    between releases, you may have to modify your template.
