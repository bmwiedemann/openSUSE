%description
Log::Dispatchouli is a thin layer above Log::Dispatch and meant to make it
dead simple to add logging to a program without having to think much about
categories, facilities, levels, or things like that. It is meant to make
logging just configurable enough that you can find the logs you want and
just easy enough that you will actually log things.

Log::Dispatchouli can log to syslog (if you specify a facility), standard
error or standard output, to a file, or to an array in memory. That last
one is mostly useful for testing.

In addition to providing as simple a way to get a handle for logging
operations, Log::Dispatchouli uses String::Flogger to process the things to
be logged, meaning you can easily log data structures. Basically: strings
are logged as is, arrayrefs are taken as (sprintf format, args), and
subroutines are called only if needed. For more information read the
String::Flogger docs.
