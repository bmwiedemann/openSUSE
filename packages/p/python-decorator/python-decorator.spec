%description
Typical implementations of Python decorators involve nested
functions, and do not preserve the signature of decorated functions,
thus can be confusing to both developers and documentation tools.

This module changes the usage of decorators for the average
programmer so as to make decorators such as memoize, tracing,
redirecting_stdout, locked, etc. more accessible.
