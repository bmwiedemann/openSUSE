Sat Oct 16 20:56:50 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.1.0:
  * Added a function `decoratorx` using the `FunctionMaker` and thus
    preserving the signature of `__code__` objects.
  * Sphinx was printing a few warnings when building the documentation
  * functions decorated with `decorator.contextmanager` were one-shot,
     as discovered by Alex Pizarro.
  * `decorator.decorator` was not passing the kwsyntax argument.
- drop kwsyntax.patch (usptream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  5 15:25:53 UTC 2021 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Add upstream patch kwsyntax.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 27 06:15:15 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.0.9:
  * Fixed a test breaking PyPy. Restored support for Sphinx.
  * Made the decorator module more robust when decorating builtin functions
    lacking dunder attributes, like `dict.__setitem__`.
  * The decorator module was not passing correctly the defaults inside the
    `*args` tuple, thanks to Dan Shult for the fix.
  * The decorator module was not copying the __module__ attribute anymore.
  * Dropped support for Python < 3.5 with a substantial simplification of
    the code base (now building a decorator does not require calling "exec").
    Added a way to mimic functools.wraps-generated decorators.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 14 15:50:24 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

  several users. Fixed a .rst bug in the description as seen in PyPI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 19 15:15:40 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 4.4.0:
  * Fixed a regression with decorator factories breaking the case with no
    arguments by going back to the syntax used in version 4.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 13 17:32:05 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- update to version 4.3.2
   * now the decorator module can decorate generator functions by
     preserving their being generator functions
   * Set `python_requires='>=2.6, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*'` in setup.py
- update to version 4.3.1
  * Added a section "For the impatient" to the README, addressing
    an issue raised by Amir Malekpour.
  * Added support for Python 3.7.

    tracebacks, as suggested by a user at EuroPython 2018.

Tue Apr 17 01:52:09 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.3.0:
  * Extended the decorator family facility to work with positional
    arguments and updated the documentation. Removed
    decorator.getargspec and provided decorator.getfullargspec
    instead. This is convenient for users of Python 2.6/2.7, the
    others can just use inspect.getfullargspec.

    https://github.com/spapini .

- changes from version 4.2.0 :
  * Added a facility to define families of decorators (aka decorators
    with arguments) as requested by several users. Accepted a pylint
    patch by David Allouche.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  9 14:14:10 UTC 2017 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 4.1.2:
  * Made it possible to define decorators converting coroutines into regular
    functions.
  * Changed the documentation build system to sphinx and uploaded the docs
    on readthedocs.org.
  * Support for Python 3.5 coroutines defined with `async def`, thanks to
    Victor-Nicolae Savu who raised the issue of `iscoroutinefunction` not
    giving the right answer for coroutines decorated with the decorator module.

    in Python 3.5, as signaled by Ralf Gommers.
