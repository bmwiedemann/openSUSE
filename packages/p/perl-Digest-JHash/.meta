  <title>Perl extension for 32 bit Jenkins Hashing Algorithm</title>
  <description>The 'Digest::JHash' module allows you to use the fast JHash hashing
algorithm developed by Bob Jenkins from within Perl programs. The algorithm
takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a
32-bit &quot;message digest&quot; of the input in the form of an unsigned long
integer.

Call it a low calorie version of MD5 if you like.
