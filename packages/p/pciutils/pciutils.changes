Thu May 11 08:20:57 UTC 2023 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 3.10.0:
  - Fixed bug in definition of versioned symbol aliases
    in shared libpci, which made compiling with link-time
    optimization fail.
  - Filters now accept "0x..." syntax for backward compatibility.
  - Windows: The cfgmgr32 back-end which provides the list of devices
    can be combined with another back-end which provides access
    to configuration space.
  - ECAM (Enhanced Configuration Access Mechanism), which is defined
    by the PCIe standard, is now supported. It requires root privileges,
    access to physical memory, and also manual configuration on some
    systems.
  - lspci: Tree view now works on multi-domain systems. It now respects
    filters properly.
  - Last but not least, pci.ids were updated to the current snapshot
    of the database. This includes overall cleanup of entries with
    non-ASCII characters in their names -- such characters are allowed,
    but only if they convey interesting information (e.g., umlauts
    in German company names, but not the "registered trade mark" sign).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 27 13:14:15 UTC 2022 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.com>

- Replace transitional %usrmerged macro with regular version check (boo#1206798)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  2 21:41:01 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.9.0:
  * We decode Compute Express Link (CXL) capabilities.
  * The tree mode of lspci is now compatible with filtering options.
  * When setpci is used with a named register, it checks whether
    the register is present in the particular header type.
  * Linux: The intel-conf[12] back-ends prefer to use ioperm() instead
    of iopl() to gain access to I/O ports.
  * mmio-conf1(-ext): Added a new back-end implementing the intel-conf1
    interface over MMIO. This is useful on some ARM machines, but it
    requires manual configuration of the MMIO addresses.
  * As usually, updated pci.ids to the current snapshot of the database.

- Make shared library executable

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 21 07:08:48 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 3.8.0:
	* Filters can now match devices based on partially specified
	  class code and also on the programming interface.
	* Reporting of link speeds, power limits, and virtual function tags
	  has been updated to the current PCIe specification.
	* We decode the Data Object Exchange capability.
	* Bus mapping mode works in non-zero domains.
	* pci_fill_info() can fetch more fields: bridge bases, programming
	  interface, revision, subsystem vendor and device ID, OS driver,
	  and also parent bridge. Internally, the implementation was rewritten,
	  significantly reducing the number of corner cases to be handled.
  * If the configuration space is not readable for some reason
	  (e.g., the cfgmgr32 back-end, but also badly implemented sleep mode
	  of some devices), lspci prints only information provided by the OS.
	* The Hurd back-end was greatly improved thanks to Joan Lledó.
	* Various minor bug fixes and improvements.
	* As usually, updated pci.ids to the current snapshot of the database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  1 07:19:48 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- Update to 3.7.0:
  * Add or improved the following capabilities:
    Designated Vendor-Specific, Compute eXpress Link,
    Resizable BARs, VF Resizable BARs, Link Capabilities 2,
    Link Status 2
  * On Linux, lspci can show IOMMU groups
  * setpci can be asked to skip bus scan and operate on a device
    completely specified by its domain/bus/dev/func address
  * back-ends which do not support domains now correctly fail when
    trying to access devices outside domain 0
- Add upstream keyging to verify source signature

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  2 07:38:52 UTC 2020 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.6.4:
  * A new back-end for the GNU Hurd was contributed by Joan Lledó.
  * When printing VPD item identifiers, non-ASCII characters are escaped.
- Changes for version 3.6.3
  * `lspci -t' (tree mode) can be combined with `-s' to show a sub-tree.
    We also fixed potential buffer overflows in the tree dumper.
  * Cleaned messy code for dumping of I/O, memory, and ROM regions.
    This helped fixing a bug, which caused some 64-bit regions to be
    reported as virtual. All flags are now printed after the address
    (previously, "[virtual]" and "[enhanced]" were before it for no good
    reason).
  * Added pci_find_cap_nr() to the library, which handles capabilities
    which occur multiple times in a single device.
  * Minor improvements in printing of PCIe capabilities.
  * We now decode the Multicast and Secondary PCI Express extended
    capabilities.
  * The list of capability names available to setpci was updated.
  * Minor bugs were fixed in FreeBSD and Solaris ports.
  * We now prefer HTTPS URLs in all documentation
  * The pci.ids file has a man page.
  * As usually, updated pci.ids to the current snapshot of the database.
- Drop no longer relevant pciutils-3.2.0_update-dist.patch
- Do not ship update-pciids script - they are provided via hwdata
  package and we dont want to override data by other packages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 28 08:21:59 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Replace dependency on pciutil-ids with hwdata

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 16 17:35:15 UTC 2018 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 3.6.2
  * Added "-P" and "-PP" switches to lspci, which display the path
    through bridges to each device.
  * Fixed a couple of bugs in computation of bus topology. It was
    previously used only for the tree display, but we re-use it
    for computing the paths.
  * As usual, updated pci.ids to the current snapshot of the database. 
- changes for version 3.6.0
  * BARs reported by the OS, but not set on the device itself are
    reliably marked with "[virtual]".
  * lib: Introduced a generic mechanism of string properties. This
    avoids lots of special cases and makes ABI compatibility easier.
  * On systems with OpenFirmware, report corresponding device tree
    nodes as device properties.
  * VPD decoder knows several non-standard extensions [bsc#1098228] (bsc#1170554, ltc#185587).
  * When PCIe link speed is less than the maximum supported by the
    device, it is explicitly marked as "downgraded".
  * Several new capabilities are not decoded yet, but at least
    their names are printed.
  * The Null capability is easily decoded.
  * Formatting of several capabilities was cleaned up.
  * The VGA16 bit in the bridge control register is now supported.
  * Added a port to SylixOS.
  * Added a port to DOS/DJGPP
  * The order in which back-ends are probed was decoupled from the
    internal back-end IDs. This helps, because new back-ends must
    have their ID allocated at the end to keep the ABI, but they
    might need to be proved earlier.
  * The fbsd-device back-end should work again.
  * Fixed a couple of bugs. Most notably, DeviceName was not printed.
- cleanup with spec-cleaner
- rebase pciutils-endianh.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 27 12:07:44 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 3.5.4:
	* Previous version broke compilation on systems, for which
    lib/types.h did not provide a 64-bit integer type. It is
    provided everywhere now.
- Changes for version 3.5.3:
	* When lspci looks for Linux kernel modules, it uses the default
	  path to module directory provided by libkmod. Previously,
	  it tried to construct the path explicitly, which need not
	  work on all systems.
	* Improved formatting of memory and I/O ranges behind a bridge.
	* PCIe link capabilities now display GEN4 speed (16GT/s) [bsc#1098094].
	* PCIe device capabilities now show bits related to atomic
    operations.
- Changes for version 3.5.2:
	* The L1 power management capability is now decoded more
	  thoroughly. Thanks to Rajat Jain for the patch.
	* The table of configuration registers used by setpci
	  had a bug in the definition of SUBSYSTEM_VENDOR_ID.

    Jonathan Yong.
  * Domain numbers extended to 31 bits. This will be used by the
    Linux kernel on some machines in near future (bsc#1006827).
  * Enhanced allocation regions are now decoded on Linux.
  * The NetBSD back-end supports PCIe extended configuration space.
  * Updated pci.ids to the current snapshot of the database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  6 07:41:51 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 3.3.1
  * Removed hacks for backward compatibility with Linux libc5,
    which were breaking newer non-glibc Linux systems. Thanks
    to Felix Janda.
  * Display VirtIO vendor-specific capability. Patch by Gerd
    Hoffmann.
  * Fixed memory leak in name cache (bnc#837347).
  * Updated pci.ids to the current snapshot of the database.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 18 13:22:45 UTC 2014 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version bump to 3.3.0:
   * Device names exported by BIOS are displayed on Linux.
   * On Linux systems, HWDB is used to look up device names
     when our ID database gives no match. (More precisely,
     HWDB is consulted after local pci.ids, but before using
     network to query online pci.ids.) Thanks to Tom Gundersen
     for the initial patch.
   * Added experimental back-end for OS X / Darwin. Thanks to
     Richard Yao for providing it.
   * Filters now support matching by device class. Original
     patch by Matthew Wilcox, wrappers for ABI compatibility
     by me.
   * Interrupt Pin and Interrupt Line registers are displayed
     for bridge devices, too.
   * Several portability bugs have been fixed.
   * Several typos have been fixed. Also, use of questionable
     constructs in man pages has been reduced.
   * PCIe link capabilities now include the ASPMOptComp bit.
   * The "CRS Software Visibility" bit is now decoded properly (bsc#1001888).
   * Updated pci.ids to the current snapshot of the database.

  * PCIe L1 PM substates are decoded.
  * Various bugs were fixed in decoding of PCIe capabilities.
  * The sysfs back-end does not spit out unnecessary warnings when
    empty slots report only a partial device address. This actually
    happens on IBM pSeries.
  * Updated pci.ids to the today's snapshot of the database.
- Cleanup with spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 30 16:58:00 UTC 2013 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to 3.2.0

- Update to 3.1.9
  * Whereever we mention the PCI ID database, we now refer to
    http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/ and the sf.net site is mentioned only
    as a mirror. This includes update-pciids.
  * Decode PCIe Gen 3 speeds and link status fields
  * various minor bug fixes
  * Updated pci.ids to the 2012-01-14 snapshot of the database

- Update to 3.1.8
  * More capabilities: Transaction Processing Hints, Latency 
    Tolerance Reporting. Thanks to Jesse Barnes.
  * Added BeOS and Haiku ports. Contributed by Francois Revol.
  * pciutils.pc now uses Libs.private properly.
  * When we format a name and it does not fit in the buffer, we 
    truncate it instead of returning "buffer too small" instead. 
    This works on all platforms with sane (i.e., C99-compatible) 
    snprintf().

 * Updated pci.ids to the today's snapshot of the database.
 * When scanning extended capabilities, properly mask the lowest 2 bits,
   which are currently reserved. This avoids unaligned access errors on
   broken hardware (see tests/broken-ecaps).
 * Large bar sizes are displayed in human-readable format (with units).
 * Physical slot information is displayed correctly for multi-function cards.
 * Fixed a couple of typos everywhere.
 * Library: Fixed bugs in freeing of capabilities.
 * Windows back-end compiles again.

 * Fixed memory and file descriptor leak in the dump back-end.
 * The SR-IOV capability decoder now prints the VF BAR's.
 * On request of certain company's lawyers, we now include a copy
   of the GPL with our package. It seems that the pciutils are getting
   mature if the most important bug of the month was this one ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  3 14:33:26 CEST 2009 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 3.1.3 
 * The VPD parser now reports unknown and vendor-defined items
   properly. It also stops on any item in unknown format, 
   avoiding long output on bogus VPD data.
 * The MSI-X table size now matches the spec.
 * The Power Management capability now includes the soft reset bit.
 * Decoding of the Advanced Features capability has been added.
 * The whole package compiles on GNU/kFreeBSD again.
 * The procfs back-end is able to cope with /proc/bus/pci
   containing names with domains, which occur on sparc64 and
   possibly other architectures due to a kernel bug.
 * The sysfs back-end no longer complains when a slot address
   is missing, which happens with old versions of Linux fakephp.
 * The Device Serial Number capability is printed in the right
   byte order.
 * The MSI and MSI-X capabilities are printed in a prettier way.
 * The tree output mode (`lspci -t') shows domain numbers only
   at the root, which makes the output more compact.
 * Updated documentation on the bus mapping mode (`lspci -M').
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  5 15:10:19 CET 2009 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 3.1.2 
 * Fixed another silly bug in the command-line parser of setpci.
 * The configure script now sets LC_ALL to avoid being fooled by
   locale-dependent behavior of `tr'.
 * The command-line parser of setpci did sometimes segfault on invalid
   input.
 * The Cygwin backend now works on Windows Vista.
 * Fixed a bug in decoding of the SR-IOV capability.
 * Details of some PCIe capabilities are displayed only with -vv.
 * When a BAR is reported by the OS, but not by the device (i.e.,
   it is marked as [virtual] in lspci), the [disabled] flag is
   suppressed, because it does not make sense in such cases.
 * The source code of lspci has been split to multiple files, hopefully
   making it easier to maintain.
 * The library and lspci now know about physical slot names. So far,
   they are provided by the sysfs back-end only.
 * When a device has the VPD (Vital Product Data) capability and the
   VPD data are supplied by the OS, they are decoded and printed in the
   verbose mode. This currently works only on Linux with the sysfs
   back-end.
 * `setpci --version' now works properly.
 * `setpci --dumpregs' prints a table of all known names of
   registers and capabilities. This replaces the table of registers
   in the setpci man page.
 * The dry-run mode of setpci gives better feedback.
 * The setpci utility is now able to address registers stored in PCI
   capabilities (actually it allows a more general form of relative
   addressing).
 * The library has gained functions for working with PCI capabilities.
 * Address Translation Services capability is now decoded.
 * `lspci -k' now displays the subsystem ID, too. This makes `-k'
   show everything needed to identify the device and the available
   drivers, which was called for by many users.
 * Fixed spelling of MSI.
 * Better support for cross-compilation.
 * Fixed printing of the AER capability.
 * HT 1.02 capabilities are decoded as HT 1.03.
 * Fixed Cygwin build.
 * Fixed a minor bug in the configure script, which caused warnings
   about redefinition of symbols during compilation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 11 22:45:55 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 3.0.1 
 * Added a Cygwin port.
 * Worked around compatibility problems with various default 
   settings of wget 
 * Fixed printing of MSI capabilities.
 * Added decoding of several PCI-X capabilities: device/link/slot 2,
   Advanced Error Reporting, Access Control Services, Alternative
   Routing-ID, Single Root I/O Virtualization.
 * Fixed bug in filters which caused them to refuse 
   vendor/device ID 0xffff.
 * Fixed several build problems: builds without PCI_USE_DNS 
   on Linux and with PCI_USE_DNS on Solaris and *BSD. Static 
   library mode also compiles again on old versions of GCC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 11 16:30:15 CEST 2008 - mrueckert@suse.de

- move shared libs to /%{_lib}

- package the pkgconfig file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 11 00:07:33 CEST 2008 - mrueckert@suse.de

  the symlink to link against libpci

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 10 21:36:17 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 3.0.0 
 * The makefile system has been reworked. All configuration 
   settings are now passed to the configure script in environment
   variables, allowing for easy tweaking in the top-level Makefile.
   All control knobs are now described in the README.
 * The libpci can be built as a shared library with properly 
   restricted symbol exports. Use `make SHARED=yes' to enable that 
   or `make SHARED=local' for a local testing build (with hardwired 
   paths to the library, so that it does not need installation).
 * Support for resolving of PCI ID's using DNS together with a local
   cache of resolved entries has been added. See the `-q' and `-Q' 
   options of lspci.
 * The library now has a generic system of settable parameters, which
   also include settings of the DNS resolver and cache. An `-O' 
   option has been added to lspci and setpci to allow setting 
   of these options.
 * Configuration of the access methods are now specified by the new
   parameter system, replacing the pci_access->method_params array.
 * Access methods now also have sensible names and help texts and it
   is possible to look up method ID by a name.
 * An `-A' switch has been added to both lspci and setpci, allowing 
   to select an arbitrary access method. The `-P' switch (configure 
   proc backend) has been removed as it is no longer needed 
   and I do not know any its user.
 * Several source files have been split for better maintainability
   (most notably the resolving of ID's).
 * Man pages and help texts have been updated. A new man page 
   `pcilib(7)' has been added and description of library options 
   has been moved there.
 * When an unknown device ID is encountered, we print `Device <id>'
   instead of `Unknown device <id>'. It uses less space and it also
   should reduce the number of inexperienced users complaining that
   the device is not supported by the OS. To lookup up OS drivers,
   use the `-k' option.
 * Makefile: stripping of the binaries during installation can be
   overridden by the STRIP variable.
 * lib/types.h: We use the integer types from <stdint.h> if the
   compiler claims C99 support.
- remove strip patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  9 15:32:10 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 2.2.10 
 * lspci.c, setpci.c: Cleaned up the list of options.
 * lib/names.c: Fix displaying of errors reported by zlib.
   Previously, the buffer containing the error message had
   been deallocated by gzclose() before the message was printed.
 * update-pciids.sh: Added quiet mode (-q). Clean up uncompressed
   files left by previous versions of the pciutils.
 * update-pciids.man: Mention the -q switch.
 * lib/dump.c: Squashed compiler warnings about code with
   no effect (there really were surplus *'s).
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  6 22:33:43 CET 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 2.2.9 
  * lspci.c: Added a new switch `-k' which requests printing
    of information on kernel drivers attached to each device
    and on kernel modules reporting the ability to handle the
    device.	
  * Makefile, lib/Makefile: Moved -lz from LDFLAGS to LDLIBS.
    Also added an explicit pattern rule for linking to make sure
    that LDLIBS is used on all platforms.
  * pci.ids: Revised class codes to match Conventional PCI 3.0 
    specs.
  * lspci.c: Decode the Debug port capability (per EHCI 0.96 spec).
  * lspci.c: Big code cleanup: re-arranged functions in the code,
    renamed everything related to capabilities to cap_* and
    all options except verbose to opt_*.
  * Capability loop detection introduced 2.2.7 did not work
    properly with extended capabilities. Fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 24 15:19:12 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- drop the patch backporting upstream bug in 
  a machine readable output [#330533]
- fix typo in show_ext_caps in lspci 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  5 14:42:24 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 2.2.7 
  * lspci.c (show_caps, show_ext_caps): Detect and report loops in
    capability lists.
  * lspci.c, lib/header.h: Finished decoding of the PCI Express
    capability. The extended capabilities remain undecoded for now,
    but at least the list of them has been updated to reflect the
    current PCI Express 2.0 spec.
  * lspci.c, lib/header.h: Decode new bits of traditional registers
    as defined by PCIE / PCI-X. This includes discard timers in 
    the bridge control register and INTx enable/status in device 
    control/status registers.
  * Makefile, lib/Makefile: `ar' and `ranlib' can be overriden to 
    allow cross-compilation.
  * lspci.c (show_ht): Added decoding of Hypertransport MSI 
    mapping capability
  * tests/cap-MSI-mapping: Added a test case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  3 08:29:53 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 2.2.6
 * Makefile: Added an "install-lib" target.
 * Makefile, lib/Makefile: Generate and install pkg-config file
   for libpci.
 * lib/i386-io-hurd.h: Rewritten for new Hurd kernels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  4 20:41:39 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 2.2.5
  * pci.ids: Updated to the current snapshot of the database.
  * lspci.c (show_express): Added PCI/PCI-X to PCI-Express 
    Bridge type.
  * pci.ids: Updated to the current snapshot of the database.
  * Replaced bzero() by memset() everywhere, it's better to lose 
    a tiny bit of readability than maintain hacks to make it work 
    on various systems.
  * lib/configure: tr on Solaris is a bit weird and it requires 
    `[A-Z]' instead of `A-Z'. Fortunately, the extra brackets 
    don't hurt otherwise.
  * lib/types.h, lib/configure: Solaris should use <stdint.h> 
    to get precise integer types.
  * lspci.c: alloca() needs <alloca.h>.
  * lib/dump.c: Fixed a couple of bugs in the dump backend which 
    caused devices with domains or with extended config space 
    to be read incorrectly. Also, dumps with partial lines are 
    allowed now.
  * lspci.c (scan_device): If an error occurs when reading the 
    standard config header of a device, report it and ignore the 
    device and return with exit code 2 at the end.
