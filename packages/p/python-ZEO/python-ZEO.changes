- Remove msgpack restriction to < 0.6 release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  4 14:10:06 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 5.2.1:
  * Add support for Python 3.7.
  * Switch from msgpack-python to msgpack. Currently a version < 0.6 is required.
  * Stop calling the deprecated checkSecure method when creating a ClientStorage. With ZODB 5.2.2 and above, this issued a warning. With older versions, this could issue a log message, but this was considered a misfeature. See issue 134.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  2 08:29:57 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Change url to match up with upstream
- Update to release 5.2.0:
  * Fixed: The quickstart/ad-hoc/play ZEO server relied on test
    dependencies. See `issue 105
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZEO/issues/105>`_.
  * Disallow passing strings as addresses to ClientStorage under Windows
    because string addresses are used for unix-domain sockets, which
    aren't supported on Windows. See `issue 107
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZEO/issues/107>`_.
  * Renamed all ``async`` attributes to ``async_`` for compatibility
    with Python 3.7. See `issue 104
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZEO/issues/104>`_.
  * Fixed to work with some changes made in ZODB 5.4.0.
    Client-side updates are incuded for ZODB 5.4.0 or databases that
    already had ``zodbpickle.binary`` OIDs. See `issue 113
    <https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZEO/issues/113>`_.
  * ZEO now uses pickle protocol 3 for both Python 2 and Python 3.
    (Previously protocol 1 was used for Python 2.) This matches the
    change in ZODB 5.4.0.
