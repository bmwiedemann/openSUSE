Although, for historical reasons, the Test::Harness distribution takes its name
from this module it now exists only to provide TAP::Harness with an interface
that is somewhat backwards compatible with Test::Harness 2.xx. If you're
writing new code consider using TAP::Harness directly instead.

Emulation is provided for runtests and execute_tests but the pluggable 'Straps'
interface that previous versions of Test::Harness supported is not reproduced
here. Straps is now available as a stand alone module: Test::Harness::Straps.

See TAP::Parser, TAP::Harness for the main documentation for this distribution.
