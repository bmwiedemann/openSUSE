%description
Although, for historical reasons, the Test::Harness distribution takes its
name from this module it now exists only to provide TAP::Harness with an
interface that is somewhat backwards compatible with Test::Harness 2.xx. If
you're writing new code consider using TAP::Harness directly instead.

Emulation is provided for 'runtests' and 'execute_tests' but the pluggable
'Straps' interface that previous versions of Test::Harness supported is not
reproduced here. Straps is now available as a stand alone module:
Test::Harness::Straps.

See TAP::Parser, TAP::Harness for the main documentation for this
distribution.
