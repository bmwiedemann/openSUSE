Thu Dec  8 10:43:43 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.16:
  - python -m http.server no longer allows terminal control
    characters sent within a garbage request to be printed to the
    stderr server log.
    This is done by changing the http.server
    BaseHTTPRequestHandler .log_message method to replace control
    characters with a \xHH hex escape before printing.
  - Avoid publishing list of active per-interpreter audit hooks
    via the gc module
  - The IDNA codec decoder used on DNS hostnames by socket or
    asyncio related name resolution functions no longer involves
    a quadratic algorithm. This prevents a potential CPU denial
    of service if an out-of-spec excessive length hostname
    involving bidirectional characters were decoded. Some
    protocols such as urllib http 3xx redirects potentially allow
    for an attacker to supply such a name (CVE-2015-20107).
  - Update bundled libexpat to 2.5.0
  - Port XKCP’s fix for the buffer overflows in SHA-3
    (CVE-2022-37454).
  - On Linux the multiprocessing module returns to using
    filesystem backed unix domain sockets for communication with
    the forkserver process instead of the Linux abstract socket
    namespace. Only code that chooses to use the “forkserver”
    start method is affected.
    Abstract sockets have no permissions and could allow any
    user on the system in the same network namespace (often
    the whole system) to inject code into the multiprocessing
    forkserver process. This was a potential privilege
    escalation. Filesystem based socket permissions restrict this
    to the forkserver process user as was the default in Python
    3.8 and earlier.
    This prevents Linux CVE-2022-42919.
  - The deprecated mailcap module now refuses to inject unsafe
    text (filenames, MIME types, parameters) into shell
    commands. Instead of using such text, it will warn and act
    as if a match was not found (or for test commands, as if the
    test failed).
- Removed upstreamed patches:
  - CVE-2015-20107-mailcap-unsafe-filenames.patch
  - CVE-2022-42919-loc-priv-mulitproc-forksrv.patch
  - CVE-2022-45061-DoS-by-IDNA-decode.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  9 18:31:23 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add CVE-2022-45061-DoS-by-IDNA-decode.patch to avoid
  CVE-2022-45061 (bsc#1205244) allowing DoS by IDNA decoding
  extremely long domain names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  3 21:35:28 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add CVE-2022-42919-loc-priv-mulitproc-forksrv.patch to avoid
  CVE-2022-42919 (bsc#1204886) avoiding Linux specific local
  privilege escalation via the multiprocessing forkserver start
  method.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 21 10:14:03 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add 98437-sphinx.locale._-as-gettext-in-pyspecific.patch to
  allow building of documentation with the latest Sphinx 5.3.0
  (gh#python/cpython#98366).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 19 07:12:23 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.15:
  - Fix multiplying a list by an integer (list *= int): detect
    the integer overflow when the new allocated length is close
    to the maximum size.
  - Fix a shell code injection vulnerability in the
    get-remote-certificate.py example script. The script no
    longer uses a shell to run openssl commands. (originally
    filed as CVE-2022-37460, later withdrawn)
  - Fix command line parsing: reject -X int_max_str_digits option
    with no value (invalid) when the PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS
    environment variable is set to a valid limit.
  - When ValueError is raised if an integer is larger than the
    limit, mention the sys.set_int_max_str_digits() function in
    the error message.
  - Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.9

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 11 08:49:43 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.14:
  - (CVE-2020-10735, bsc#1203125). Converting between int
    and str in bases other than 2 (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16
    (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base 10 (decimal) now raises a
    ValueError if the number of digits in string form is above a
    limit to avoid potential denial of service attacks due to the
    algorithmic complexity.
    This new limit can be configured or disabled by environment
    variable, command line flag, or sys APIs. See the integer
    string conversion length limitation documentation. The
    default limit is 4300 digits in string form.
  - Also other bug fixes:
    - http.server: Fix an open redirection vulnerability in the
      HTTP server when an URI path starts with //. Vulnerability
      discovered, and initial fix proposed, by Hamza Avvan.
    - Fix contextvars HAMT implementation to handle iteration
      over deep trees. The bug was discovered and fixed by Eli
      Libman. See MagicStack/immutables#84 for more details.
    - Fix binding of unix socket to empty address on Linux to use
      an available address from the abstract namespace, instead
      of “0”.
    - Suppress writing an XML declaration in open files
      in ElementTree.write() with encoding='unicode' and
      xml_declaration=None.
    - Fix the formatting for await x and not x in the operator
      precedence table when using the help() system.
    - Fix ensurepip environment isolation for subprocess running
      pip.
    - Fix problem with test_ssl test_get_ciphers on systems that
      require perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers.
    - test_ssl is now checking for supported TLS version and
      protocols in more tests.
- Removed upstreamed patches:
  - CVE-2021-28861-double-slash-path.patch
- Realign patches:
  - bpo-31046_ensurepip_honours_prefix.patch
  - sphinx-update-removed-function.patch

Fri May 20 14:18:15 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.13:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-92311: Fixed a bug where setting frame.f_lineno to jump
      over a list comprehension could misbehave or crash.
    - gh-92112: Fix crash triggered by an evil custom mro() on
      a metaclass.
    - gh-92036: Fix a crash in subinterpreters related to the
      garbage collector. When a subinterpreter is deleted,
      untrack all objects tracked by its GC. To prevent a crash
      in deallocator functions expecting objects to be tracked by
      the GC, leak a strong reference to these objects on
      purpose, so they are never deleted and their deallocator
      functions are not called. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-91421: Fix a potential integer overflow in
      _Py_DecodeUTF8Ex.
    - bpo-46775: Some Windows system error codes(>= 10000) are
      now mapped into the correct errno and may now raise
      a subclass of OSError. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
    - bpo-46962: Classes and functions that unconditionally
      declared their docstrings ignoring the
      --without-doc-strings compilation flag no longer do so.
    - The classes affected are pickle.PickleBuffer,
      testcapi.RecursingInfinitelyError, and types.GenericAlias.
    - The functions affected are 24 methods in ctypes.
    - Patch by Oleg Iarygin.
    - bpo-36819: Fix crashes in built-in encoders with error
      handlers that return position less or equal than the
      starting position of non-encodable characters.
  - Library
    - gh-91581: utcfromtimestamp() no longer attempts to resolve
      fold in the pure Python implementation, since the fold is
      never 1 in UTC. In addition to being slightly faster in the
      common case, this also prevents some errors when the
      timestamp is close to datetime.min. Patch by Paul Ganssle.
    - gh-92530: Fix an issue that occurred after interrupting
      threading.Condition.notify().
    - gh-92049: Forbid pickling constants re._constants.SUCCESS
      etc. Previously, pickling did not fail, but the result
      could not be unpickled.
    - bpo-47029: Always close the read end of the pipe used by
      multiprocessing.Queue after the last write of buffered data
      to the write end of the pipe to avoid BrokenPipeError at
      garbage collection and at multiprocessing.Queue.close()
      calls. Patch by Géry Ogam.
    - gh-91910: Add missing f prefix to f-strings in error
      messages from the multiprocessing and asyncio modules.
    - gh-91810: ElementTree method write() and function
      tostring() now use the text file’s encoding (“UTF-8” if not
      available) instead of locale encoding in XML declaration
      when encoding="unicode" is specified.
    - gh-91832: Add required attribute to argparse.Action repr
      output.
    - gh-91734: Fix OSS audio support on Solaris.
    - gh-91700: Compilation of regular expression containing
      a conditional expression (?(group)...) now raises an
      appropriate re.error if the group number refers to not
      defined group. Previously an internal RuntimeError was
      raised.
    - gh-91676: Fix unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase to shutdown
      the per test event loop executor before returning from its
      run method so that a not yet stopped or garbage collected
      executor state does not persist beyond the test.
    - gh-90568: Parsing \N escapes of Unicode Named Character
      Sequences in a regular expression raises now re.error
      instead of TypeError.
    - gh-91595: Fix the comparison of character and integer
      inside Tools.gdb.libpython.write_repr(). Patch by Yu Liu.
    - gh-90622: Worker processes for
      concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor are no longer
      spawned on demand (a feature added in 3.9) when the
      multiprocessing context start method is "fork" as that can
      lead to deadlocks in the child processes due to a fork
      happening while threads are running.
    - gh-91575: Update case-insensitive matching in the re module
      to the latest Unicode version.
    - gh-91581: Remove an unhandled error case in the
      C implementation of calls to datetime.fromtimestamp with no
      time zone (i.e. getting a local time from an epoch
      timestamp). This should have no user-facing effect other
      than giving a possibly more accurate error message when
      called with timestamps that fall on 10000-01-01 in the
      local time. Patch by Paul Ganssle.
    - bpo-34480: Fix a bug where _markupbase raised an
      UnboundLocalError when an invalid keyword was found in
      marked section. Patch by Marek Suscak.
    - bpo-27929: Fix asyncio.loop.sock_connect() to only resolve
      names for socket.AF_INET or socket.AF_INET6 families.
      Resolution may not make sense for other families, like
      socket.AF_BLUETOOTH and socket.AF_UNIX.
    - bpo-43323: Fix errors in the email module if the charset
      itself contains undecodable/unencodable characters.
    - bpo-46787: Fix concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor
      exception memory leak
    - bpo-46415: Fix ipaddress.ip_{address,interface,network}
      raising TypeError instead of ValueError if given invalid
      tuple as address parameter.
    - bpo-44911: IsolatedAsyncioTestCase will no longer throw an
      exception while cancelling leaked tasks. Patch by Bar
      Harel.
    - bpo-44493: Add missing terminated NUL in sockaddr_un’s
      length
    - This was potentially observable when using non-abstract
      AF_UNIX datagram sockets to processes written in another
      programming language.
    - bpo-42627: Fix incorrect parsing of Windows registry proxy
      settings
    - bpo-36073: Raise ProgrammingError instead of segfaulting on
      recursive usage of cursors in sqlite3 converters. Patch by
      Sergey Fedoseev.

      Documentation Strings paragraph. Patch by Oleg Iarygin.
    - bpo-26792: Improve the docstrings of runpy.run_module() and
      runpy.run_path(). Original patch by Andrew Brezovsky.
    - bpo-45790: Adjust inaccurate phrasing in Defining Extension
      Types: Tutorial about the ob_base field and the macros used
      to access its contents.
    - bpo-42340: Document that in some circumstances
      KeyboardInterrupt may cause the code to enter an
      inconsistent state. Provided a sample workaround to avoid
      it if needed.
    - bpo-41233: Link the errnos referenced in
      Doc/library/exceptions.rst to their respective section in
      Doc/library/errno.rst, and vice versa. Previously this was
      only done for EINTR and InterruptedError. Patch by Yan
      “yyyyyyyan” Orestes.
    - bpo-38056: Overhaul the Error Handlers documentation in
      codecs.
    - bpo-13553: Document tkinter.Tk args.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 26 22:22:24 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.12:
  - bpo-46968: Check for the existence of the “sys/auxv.h” header
    in faulthandler to avoid compilation problems in systems
    where this header doesn’t exist. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-47101: hashlib.algorithms_available now lists only
    algorithms that are provided by activated crypto providers on
    OpenSSL 3.0. Legacy algorithms are not listed unless the
    legacy provider has been loaded into the default OSSL
    context.
  - bpo-23691: Protect the re.finditer() iterator from
    re-entering.
  - bpo-42369: Fix thread safety of zipfile._SharedFile.tell() to
    avoid a “zipfile.BadZipFile: Bad CRC-32 for file” exception
    when reading a ZipFile from multiple threads.
  - bpo-38256: Fix binascii.crc32() when it is compiled to use
    zlib’c crc32 to work properly on inputs 4+GiB in length
    instead of returning the wrong result. The workaround prior
    to this was to always feed the function data in increments
    smaller than 4GiB or to just call the zlib module function.
  - bpo-39394: A warning about inline flags not at the start of
    the regular expression now contains the position of the flag.
  - bpo-47061: Deprecate the various modules listed by PEP 594:
  - aifc, asynchat, asyncore, audioop, cgi, cgitb, chunk, crypt,

  - bpo-2604: Fix bug where doctests using globals would fail
    when run multiple times.
  - bpo-45997: Fix asyncio.Semaphore re-aquiring FIFO order.
  - bpo-47022: The asynchat, asyncore and smtpd modules have been
    deprecated since at least Python 3.6. Their documentation has
    now been updated to note they will removed in Python 3.12
    (PEP 594).
  - bpo-46421: Fix a unittest issue where if the command was
    invoked as python -m unittest and the filename(s) began with
    a dot (.), a ValueError is returned.
  - bpo-40296: Fix supporting generic aliases in pydoc.
  - bpo-14156: argparse.FileType now supports an argument of ‘-’
    in binary mode, returning the .buffer attribute of
    sys.stdin/sys.stdout as appropriate. Modes including ‘x’ and
    ‘a’ are treated equivalently to ‘w’ when argument is ‘-’.
    Patch contributed by Josh Rosenberg

- Update to 3.9.11:
  - bpo-46852: Rename the private undocumented
    float.__set_format__() method to float.__setformat__() to fix
    a typo introduced in Python 3.7. The method is only used by
    test_float. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46794: Bump up the libexpat version into 2.4.6
  - bpo-46762: Fix an assert failure in debug builds when a ‘<’,
    ‘>’, or ‘=’ is the last character in an f-string that’s
    missing a closing right brace.
  - bpo-46732: Correct the docstring for the __bool__() method.
    Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  - bpo-40479: Add a missing call to va_end() in
    Modules/_hashopenssl.c.
  - bpo-46615: When iterating over sets internally in
    setobject.c, acquire strong references to the resulting items
    from the set. This prevents crashes in corner-cases of
    various set operations where the set gets mutated.
  - bpo-43721: Fix docstrings of getter, setter, and deleter to
    clarify that they create a new copy of the property.
  - bpo-46503: Fix an assert when parsing some invalid N escape
    sequences in f-strings.
  - bpo-46417: Fix a race condition on setting a type __bases__
    attribute: the internal function add_subclass() now gets the
    PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses member after calling
    PyWeakref_NewRef() which can trigger a garbage collection
    which can indirectly modify PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses. Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46383: Fix invalid signature of _zoneinfo’s module_free
    function to resolve a crash on wasm32-emscripten platform.
  - bpo-43253: Fix a crash when closing transports where the
    underlying socket handle is already invalid on the Proactor
    event loop.
  - bpo-47004: Apply bugfixes from importlib_metadata 4.11.3,

    22.0.4, bnc#1186819, CVE-2021-3572)
  - bpo-46968: faulthandler: On Linux 5.14 and newer, dynamically
    determine size of signal handler stack size CPython allocates
    using getauxval(AT_MINSIGSTKSZ). This changes allows for
    Python extension’s request to Linux kernel to use AMX_TILE
    instruction set on Sapphire Rapids Xeon processor to succeed,
    unblocking use of the ISA in frameworks.
  - bpo-46955: Expose asyncio.base_events.Server as
    asyncio.Server. Patch by Stefan Zabka.
  - bpo-46932: Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.7

    shared folders when running from the guest operating-system.
  - bpo-46756: Fix a bug in
    urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgr.find_user_password() and
    urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuth.is_authenticated()
    which allowed to bypass authorization. For example, access to
    URI example.org/foobar was allowed if the user was authorized
    for URI example.org/foo.
  - bpo-45863: When the tarfile module creates a pax format
    archive, it will put an integer representation of timestamps
    in the ustar header (if possible) for the benefit of older
    unarchivers, in addition to the existing full-precision
    timestamps in the pax extended header.
  - bpo-46672: Fix NameError in asyncio.gather() when initial
    type check fails.
  - bpo-45948: Fixed a discrepancy in the C implementation of the
    xml.etree.ElementTree module. Now, instantiating an
    xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser with a target=None keyword
    provides a default xml.etree.ElementTree.TreeBuilder target
    as the Python implementation does.
  - bpo-46591: Make the IDLE doc URL on the About IDLE dialog
    clickable.
  - bpo-46400: expat: Update libexpat from 2.4.1 to 2.4.4
  - bpo-46487: Add the get_write_buffer_limits method to
    asyncio.transports.WriteTransport and to the SSL transport.
  - bpo-46539: In typing.get_type_hints(), support evaluating
    stringified ClassVar and Final annotations inside Annotated.
    Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-46491: Allow typing.Annotated to wrap typing.Final and
    typing.ClassVar. Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-46436: Fix command-line option -d/--directory in module
    http.server which is ignored when combined with command-line
    option --cgi. Patch by Géry Ogam.
  - bpo-41403: Make mock.patch() raise a TypeError with
    a relevant error message on invalid arg. Previously it
    allowed a cryptic AttributeError to escape.
  - bpo-46474: In importlib.metadata.EntryPoint.pattern, avoid
    potential REDoS by limiting ambiguity in consecutive
    whitespace.

    when the input data is an object that supports the buffer
    protocol, the file length may be wrong.
  - bpo-45703: When a namespace package is imported before
    another module from the same namespace is created/installed
    in a different sys.path location while the program is
    running, calling the importlib.invalidate_caches() function
    will now also guarantee the new module is noticed.
  - bpo-24959: Fix bug where unittest sometimes drops frames from
    tracebacks of exceptions raised in tests.
  - bpo-46463: Fixes escape4chm.py script used when building the

    characters if the readline module is loaded. The readline
    module changes input() behavior, but test_builtin is not
    intented to test the readline module. Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - bpo-38472: Fix GCC detection in setup.py when
    cross-compiling. The C compiler is now run with LC_ALL=C.
    Previously, the detection failed with a German locale.
  - bpo-46513: configure no longer uses AC_C_CHAR_UNSIGNED macro
    and pyconfig.h no longer defines reserved symbol
    __CHAR_UNSIGNED__.

    + bpo-44219: Release the GIL while performing isatty system calls on arbitrary file descriptors. In particular, this affects os.isatty(), os.device_encoding() and io.TextIOWrapper. By extension, io.open() in text mode is also affected. This change solves a deadlock in os.isatty(). Patch by Vincent Michel in bpo-44219.
    + bpo-44959: Added fallback to extension modules with ‘.sl’ suffix on HP-UX
    + bpo-44050: Extensions that indicate they use global state (by setting m_size to -1) can again be used in multiple interpreters. This reverts to behavior of Python 3.8.
    + bpo-45121: Fix issue where Protocol.__init__ raises RecursionError when it’s called directly or via super(). Patch provided by Yurii Karabas.
    + bpo-45083: When the interpreter renders an exception, its name now has a complete qualname. Previously only the class name was concatenated to the module name, which sometimes resulted in an incorrect full name being displayed.
    + bpo-45738: Fix computation of error location for invalid continuation characters in the parser. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    + Library
    + bpo-45678: Fix bug in Python 3.9 that meant functools.singledispatchmethod failed to properly wrap the attributes of the target method. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    + bpo-45679: Fix caching of multi-value typing.Literal. Literal[True, 2] is no longer equal to Literal[1, 2].
    + bpo-45438: Fix typing.Signature string representation for generic builtin types.
    + bpo-45581: sqlite3.connect() now correctly raises MemoryError if the underlying SQLite API signals memory error. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.

    + bpo-45467: Fix incremental decoder and stream reader in the “raw-unicode-escape” codec. Previously they failed if the escape sequence was split.
    + bpo-45461: Fix incremental decoder and stream reader in the “unicode-escape” codec. Previously they failed if the escape sequence was split.
    + bpo-45239: Fixed email.utils.parsedate_tz() crashing with UnboundLocalError on certain invalid input instead of returning None. Patch by Ben Hoyt.
    + bpo-44904: Fix bug in the doctest module that caused it to fail if a docstring included an example with a classmethod property. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    + bpo-45406: Make inspect.getmodule() catch FileNotFoundError raised by :’func:inspect.getabsfile, and return None to indicate that the module could not be determined.
    + bpo-45262: Prevent use-after-free in asyncio. Make sure the cached running loop holder gets cleared on dealloc to prevent use-after-free in get_running_loop
    + bpo-45386: Make xmlrpc.client more robust to C runtimes where the underlying C strftime function results in a ValueError when testing for year formatting options.
    + bpo-45371: Fix clang rpath issue in distutils. The UnixCCompiler now uses correct clang option to add a runtime library directory (rpath) to a shared library.

    + bpo-45343: Update bundled pip to 21.2.4 and setuptools to 58.1.0
    + bpo-41710: On Unix, if the sem_clockwait() function is available in the C library (glibc 2.30 and newer), the threading.Lock.acquire() method now uses the monotonic clock (time.CLOCK_MONOTONIC) for the timeout, rather than using the system clock (time.CLOCK_REALTIME), to not be affected by system clock changes. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    + bpo-45328: Fixed http.client.HTTPConnection to work properly in OSs that don’t support the TCP_NODELAY socket option.
    + bpo-1596321: Fix the threading._shutdown() function when the threading module was imported first from a thread different than the main thread: no longer log an error at Python exit.
    + bpo-45274: Fix a race condition in the Thread.join() method of the threading module. If the function is interrupted by a signal and the signal handler raises an exception, make sure that the thread remains in a consistent state to prevent a deadlock. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    + bpo-45238: Fix unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase.debug(): it runs now asynchronous methods and callbacks.
    + bpo-36674: unittest.TestCase.debug() raises now a unittest.SkipTest if the class or the test method are decorated with the skipping decorator.
    + bpo-45235: Fix an issue where argparse would not preserve values in a provided namespace when using a subparser with defaults.
    + bpo-45234: Fixed a regression in copyfile(), copy(), copy2() raising FileNotFoundError when source is a directory, which should raise IsADirectoryError
    + bpo-45228: Fix stack buffer overflow in parsing J1939 network address.
    + bpo-45192: Fix the tempfile._infer_return_type function so that the dir argument of the tempfile functions accepts an object implementing the os.PathLike protocol.
    + bpo-45160: When tracing a tkinter variable used by a ttk OptionMenu, callbacks are no longer made twice.
    + bpo-35474: Calling mimetypes.guess_all_extensions() with strict=False no longer affects the result of the following call with strict=True. Also, mutating the returned list no longer affects the global state.
    + bpo-45166: typing.get_type_hints() now works with Final wrapped in ForwardRef.
    + bpo-45097: Remove deprecation warnings about the loop argument in asyncio incorrectly emitted in cases when the user does not pass the loop argument.
    + bpo-45081: Fix issue when dataclasses that inherit from typing.Protocol subclasses have wrong __init__. Patch provided by Yurii Karabas.
    + bpo-24444: Fixed an error raised in argparse help display when help for an option is set to 1+ blank spaces or when choices arg is an empty container.
    + bpo-45021: Fix a potential deadlock at shutdown of forked children when using concurrent.futures module
    + bpo-45030: Fix integer overflow in pickling and copying the range iterator.
    + bpo-39039: tarfile.open raises ReadError when a zlib error occurs during file extraction.

    + bpo-45680: Amend the docs on GenericAlias objects to clarify that non-container classes can also implement __class_getitem__. Patch contributed by Alex Waygood.
    + bpo-45655: Add a new “relevant PEPs” section to the top of the documentation for the typing module. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    + bpo-45604: Add level argument to multiprocessing.log_to_stderr function docs.
    + bpo-45464: Mention in the documentation of Built-in Exceptions that inheriting from multiple exception types in a single subclass is not recommended due to possible memory layout incompatibility.
    + bpo-45449: Add note about PEP 585 in collections.abc.
    + bpo-45516: Add protocol description to the importlib.abc.Traversable documentation.
    + bpo-20692: Add Programming FAQ entry explaining that int literal attribute access requires either a space after or parentheses around the literal.
    + bpo-45216: Remove extra documentation listing methods in difflib. It was rendering twice in pydoc and was outdated in some places.
    + bpo-45772: socket.socket documentation is corrected to a class from a function.
    + bpo-45392: Update the docstring of the type built-in to remove a redundant line and to mention keyword arguments for the constructor.

Sat Nov  6 13:45:01 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- rpm-build-python dependency is available on the current
  Factory, not with SLE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 30 12:37:34 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add incorrect-deprecation-warn-asyncio.patch to fix bpo#45097
  (from gh#python/cpython#28153) to remove incorrect deprecation
  warnings in asyncio.

Wed Oct 13 08:51:46 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- BuildRequire rpm-build-python: The provider to inject python(abi)
  has been moved there. rpm-build pulls rpm-build-python
  automatically in when building anything against python3-base, but
  this implies that the initial build of python3-base does not
  trigger the automatic installation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 10:17:28 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.7:
  - Security
    - Replaced usage of tempfile.mktemp() with TemporaryDirectory
      to avoid a potential race condition.
    - Add auditing events to the marshal module, and stop raising
      code.__init__ events for every unmarshalled code object.
      Directly instantiated code objects will continue to raise
      an event, and audit event handlers should inspect or
      collect the raw marshal data. This reduces a significant
      performance overhead when loading from .pyc files.
    - Made the internal putcmd function in smtplib sanitize input
      for presence of \r and \n characters to avoid (unlikely)
      command injection.
  - Core and Builtins
    - Fixed pickling of range iterators that iterated for over
      2**32 times.
    - Fix a race in WeakKeyDictionary, WeakValueDictionary and
      WeakSet when two threads attempt to commit the last pending
      removal. This fixes asyncio.create_task and fixes a data
      loss in asyncio.run where shutdown_asyncgens is not run
    - Fixed a corner case bug where the result of
      float.fromhex('0x.8p-1074') was rounded the wrong way.
    - Refine the syntax error for trailing commas in import
      statements. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - Restore behaviour of complex exponentiation with
      integer-valued exponent of type float or complex.
    - Correct the ast locations of f-strings with format specs
      and repeated expressions. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Use new trashcan macros (Py_TRASHCAN_BEGIN/END) in
      frameobject.c instead of the old ones
      (Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_BEGIN/END).
    - Fix segmentation fault with deep recursion when cleaning
      method objects. Patch by Augusto Goulart and Pablo Galindo.
    - Fix bug where PyErr_SetObject hangs when the current
      exception has a cycle in its context chain.
    - Fix reference leaks in the error paths of update_bases()
      and __build_class__. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - Fix undefined behaviour in complex object exponentiation.
    - Remove uses of PyObject_GC_Del() in error path when
      initializing types.GenericAlias.
    - Remove the pass-through for hash() of weakref.proxy objects
      to prevent unintended consequences when the original
      referred object dies while the proxy is part of a hashable
      object. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - Fix ltrace functionality when exceptions are raised. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - Fix a crash at Python exit when a deallocator function
      removes the last strong reference to a heap type. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - Fix crash when using passing a non-exception to
      a generator’s throw() method. Patch by Noah Oxer
  - Library
    - run() now always return a TestResult instance. Previously
      it returned None if the test class or method was decorated
      with a skipping decorator.
    - Fix bugs in cleaning up classes and modules in unittest:
        - Functions registered with addModuleCleanup() were not
          called unless the user defines tearDownModule() in
          their test module.
        - Functions registered with addClassCleanup() were not
          called if tearDownClass is set to None.
        - Buffering in TestResult did not work with functions
          registered with addClassCleanup() and
          addModuleCleanup().
        - Errors in functions registered with addClassCleanup()
          and addModuleCleanup() were not handled correctly in
          buffered and debug modes.
        - Errors in setUpModule() and functions registered with
          addModuleCleanup() were reported in wrong order.
        - And several lesser bugs.
    - Made email date parsing more robust against malformed
      input, namely a whitespace-only Date: header. Patch by
      Wouter Bolsterlee.
    - Fix a crash in the signal handler of the faulthandler
      module: no longer modify the reference count of frame
      objects. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Method stopTestRun() is now always called in pair with
      method startTestRun() for TestResult objects implicitly
      created in run(). Previously it was not called for test
      methods and classes decorated with a skipping decorator.
    - argparse.BooleanOptionalAction’s default value is no longer
      printed twice when used with
      argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter.
    - Upgrade bundled pip to 21.2.3 and setuptools to 57.4.0
    - Fix the os.set_inheritable() function on FreeBSD 14 for
      file descriptor opened with the O_PATH flag: ignore the
      EBADF error on ioctl(), fallback on the fcntl()
      implementation. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - The @functools.total_ordering() decorator now works with
      metaclasses.
    - sqlite3 user-defined functions and aggregators returning
      strings with embedded NUL characters are no longer
      truncated. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - Always show loop= arg deprecations in asyncio.gather() and
      asyncio.sleep()
    - Non-protocol subclasses of typing.Protocol ignore now the
      __init__ method inherited from protocol base classes.
    - The tokenize.tokenize() doesn’t incorrectly generate
      a NEWLINE token if the source doesn’t end with a new line
      character but the last line is a comment, as the function
      is already generating a NL token. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Fix http.client.HTTPSConnection fails to download >2GiB
      data.
    - rcompleter does not call getattr() on property objects to
      avoid the side-effect of evaluating the corresponding
      method.
    - weakref.proxy objects referencing non-iterators now raise
      TypeError rather than dereferencing the null tp_iternext
      slot and crashing.
    - The implementation of collections.abc.Set._hash() now
      matches that of frozenset.__hash__().
    - Fixed issue in compileall.compile_file() when sys.stdout is
      redirected. Patch by Stefan Hölzl.
    - Give priority to using the current class constructor in
      inspect.signature(). Patch by Weipeng Hong.
    - Fix memory leak in _tkinter._flatten() if it is called with
      a sequence or set, but not list or tuple.
    - Update shutil.copyfile() to raise FileNotFoundError instead
      of confusing IsADirectoryError when a path ending with
      a os.path.sep does not exist; shutil.copy() and
      shutil.copy2() are also affected.
    - handle StopIteration subclass raised from
      @contextlib.contextmanager generator
    - Make the implementation consistency of indexOf() between
      C and Python versions. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
    - Fixes TypedDict to work with typing.get_type_hints() and
      postponed evaluation of annotations across modules.
    - Fix bug with pdb’s handling of import error due to
      a package which does not have a __main__ module
    - Fixed an exception thrown while parsing a malformed
      multipart email by email.message.EmailMessage.
    - pathlib.PureWindowsPath.is_reserved() now identifies
      a greater range of reserved filenames, including those with
      trailing spaces or colons.
    - Handle exceptions from parsing the arg of pdb’s run/restart
      command.
    - The sqlite3 context manager now performs a rollback (thus
      releasing the database lock) if commit failed. Patch by
      Luca Citi and Erlend E. Aasland.
    - Improved string handling for sqlite3 user-defined functions
      and aggregates:
        - It is now possible to pass strings with embedded null
          characters to UDFs
        - Conversion failures now correctly raise MemoryError
    - Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - Handle RecursionError in TracebackException’s constructor,
      so that long exceptions chains are truncated instead of
      causing traceback formatting to fail.
    - Fix email.message.EmailMessage.set_content() when called
      with binary data and 7bit content transfer encoding.
    - The compresslevel and preset keyword arguments of
      tarfile.open() are now both documented and tested.
    - Fixed a Y2k38 bug in the compileall module where it would
      fail to compile files with a modification time after the
      year 2038.
    - Fix test___all__ on platforms lacking a shared memory
      implementation.
    - Pass multiprocessing BaseProxy argument manager_owned
      through AutoProxy.
    - email.utils.getaddresses() now accepts email.header.Header
      objects along with string values. Patch by Zackery Spytz.
    - lib2to3 now recognizes async generators everywhere.
    - Fix TypeError when required subparsers without dest do not
      receive arguments. Patch by Anthony Sottile.
  - Documentation
    - Removed the othergui.rst file, any references to it, and
      the list of GUI frameworks in the FAQ. In their place I’ve
      added links to the Python Wiki page on GUI frameworks.
    - Update the definition of __future__ in the glossary by
      replacing the confusing word “pseudo-module” with a more
      accurate description.
    - Add typical examples to os.path.splitext docs
    - Clarify that shutil.make_archive() is not thread-safe due
      to reliance on changing the current working directory.
    - Update of three expired hyperlinks in
      Doc/distributing/index.rst: “Project structure”, “Building
      and packaging the project”, and “Uploading the project to
      the Python Packaging Index”.
    - Updated the docstring and docs of filecmp.cmp() to be more
      accurate and less confusing especially in respect to
      shallow arg.
    - Match the docstring and python implementation of countOf()
      to the behavior of its c implementation.
    - List all kwargs for textwrap.wrap(), textwrap.fill(), and
      textwrap.shorten(). Now, there are nav links to attributes
      of TextWrap, which makes navigation much easier while
      minimizing duplication in the documentation.
    - Clarify that atexit uses equality comparisons internally.
    - Documentation of csv.Dialect is more descriptive.
    - Fix documentation for the return type of
      sysconfig.get_path().
    - Add a “Security Considerations” index which links to
      standard library modules that have explicitly documented
      security considerations.
    - Remove the unqualified claim that tkinter is threadsafe. It
      has not been true for several years and likely never was.
      An explanation of what is true may be added later, after
      more discussion, and possibly after patching _tkinter.c,
  - Tests
    - Add calls of gc.collect() in tests to support PyPy.
    - Made tests relying on the _asyncio C extension module
      optional to allow running on alternative Python
      implementations. Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.
    - Fix auto history tests of test_readline: sometimes, the
      newline character is not written at the end, so don’t
      expect it in the output.
    - Add ability to wholesale silence DeprecationWarnings while
      running the regression test suite.
    - Notify users running test_decimal regression tests on macOS
      of potential harmless “malloc can’t allocate region”
      messages spewed by test_decimal.
    - Fixed floating point precision issue in turtle tests.
    - Regression tests, when run with -w, are now re-running only
      the affected test methods instead of re-running the entire
      test file.
    - Add test for nested queues when using multiprocessing
      shared objects AutoProxy[Queue] inside ListProxy and
      DictProxy

- Update to 3.9.6:
  * Security
    - bpo-44022 (bsc#1189241, CVE-2021-3737): http.client now
      avoids infinitely reading potential HTTP headers after
      a 100 Continue status response from the server.
  * Core and Builtins
    - bpo-44168: Fix error message in the parser involving keyword
      arguments with invalid expressions. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - bpo-44114: Fix incorrect dictkeys_reversed and
      dictitems_reversed function signatures in C code, which broke
      webassembly builds.
    - bpo-44070: No longer eagerly makes import filenames absolute,
      except for extension modules, which was introduced in 3.9.5.
    - bpo-28146: Fix a confusing error message in str.format().
    - bpo-11105: When compiling ast.AST objects with recursive
      references through compile(), the interpreter doesn’t crash
      anymore instead it raises a RecursionError.
  * Library
    - bpo-43972: When http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler sends a
      301 (Moved Permanently) for a directory path not ending with
      /, add a Content-Length: 0 header. This improves the behavior
      for certain clients.
    - bpo-43776: When subprocess.Popen args are provided as a
      string or as pathlib.Path, the Popen instance repr now shows
      the right thing.
    - bpo-43318: Fix a bug where pdb does not always echo cleared
      breakpoints.
    - bpo-43295: datetime.datetime.strptime() now raises ValueError
      instead of IndexError when matching 'z' with the %z format
      specifier.
    - bpo-37022: pdb now displays exceptions from repr() with its p
      and pp commands.
  * IDLE
    - bpo-33962: Move the indent space setting from the Font tab to
      the new Windows tab. Patch by Mark Roseman and Terry Jan
      Reedy.
    - bpo-40468: Split the settings dialog General tab into Windows
      and Shell/ED tabs. Move help sources, which extend the Help
      menu, to the Extensions tab. Make space for new options and
      shorten the dialog. The latter makes the dialog better fit
      small screens.
    - bpo-41611: Avoid uncaught exceptions in
      AutoCompleteWindow.winconfig_event().
    - bpo-41611: Fix IDLE sometimes freezing upon tab-completion on
      macOS.
  * Tools/Demos
    - bpo-44074: Make patchcheck automatically detect the correct
      base branch name (previously it was hardcoded to ‘master’)
- Upstreamed patches were removed:
  - bpo44426-complex-keyword-sphinx.patch
- Refreshed patches:
  - subprocess-raise-timeout.patch

- Update to 3.9.5:
  * Security
    - bpo-43434: Creating a sqlite3.Connection object now also
      produces a sqlite3.connect auditing event. Previously this
      event was only produced by sqlite3.connect() calls. Patch
      by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - bpo-43882: The presence of newline or tab characters in
      parts of a URL could allow some forms of attacks.
    - Following the controlling specification for URLs defined by
      WHATWG urllib.parse() now removes ASCII newlines and tabs
      from URLs, preventing such attacks.
    - bpo-43472: Ensures interpreter-level audit hooks receive
      the cpython.PyInterpreterState_New event when called
      through the _xxsubinterpreters module.
    - bpo-36384 (bsc#1185706, CVE-2021-29921): ipaddress module
      no longer accepts any leading zeros in IPv4 address
      strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous and interpreted as
      octal notation by some libraries. For example the legacy
      function socket.inet_aton() treats leading zeros as octal
      notatation. glibc implementation of modern inet_pton() does
      not accept any leading zeros. For a while the ipaddress
      module used to accept ambiguous leading zeros.
    - bpo-43075 (CVE-2021-3733, bsc#1189287): Fix Regular
      Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in
      urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler. The
      ReDoS-vulnerable regex has quadratic worst-case complexity
      and it allows cause a denial of service when identifying
      crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on the client
      side and needs remote attackers to control the HTTP server.
    - bpo-42800: Audit hooks are now fired for frame.f_code,
      traceback.tb_frame, and generator code/frame attribute
      access.
  * Core and Builtins
    - bpo-43105: Importlib now resolves relative paths when
      creating module spec objects from file locations.
    - bpo-42924: Fix bytearray repetition incorrectly copying
      data from the start of the buffer, even if the data is
      offset within the buffer (e.g. after reassigning a slice at
      the start of the bytearray to a shorter byte string).
  * Library
    - bpo-43993: Update bundled pip to 21.1.1.
    - bpo-43937: Fixed the turtle module working with non-default
      root window.
    - bpo-43930: Update bundled pip to 21.1 and setuptools to
      56.0.0
    - bpo-43920: OpenSSL 3.0.0: load_verify_locations() now
      returns a consistent error message when cadata contains no
      valid certificate.
    - bpo-43607: urllib can now convert Windows paths with \\?\
      prefixes into URL paths.
    - bpo-43284: platform.win32_ver derives the windows version
      from sys.getwindowsversion().platform_version which in turn
      derives the version from kernel32.dll (which can be of
      a different version than Windows itself). Therefore change
      the platform.win32_ver to determine the version using the
      platform module’s _syscmd_ver private function to return an
      accurate version.
    - bpo-42248: [Enum] ensure exceptions raised in _missing__
      are released
    - bpo-43799: OpenSSL 3.0.0: define OPENSSL_API_COMPAT 1.1.1
      to suppress deprecation warnings. Python requires OpenSSL
      1.1.1 APIs.
    - bpo-43794: Add ssl.OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF constants
      (OpenSSL 3.0.0)
    - bpo-43789: OpenSSL 3.0.0: Don’t call the password callback
      function a second time when first call has signaled an
      error condition.
    - bpo-43788: The header files for ssl error codes are now
      OpenSSL version-specific. Exceptions will now show correct
      reason and library codes. The make_ssl_data.py script has
      been rewritten to use OpenSSL’s text file with error codes.
    - bpo-43655: tkinter dialog windows are now recognized as
      dialogs by window managers on macOS and X Window.
    - bpo-43534: turtle.textinput() and turtle.numinput() create
      now a transient window working on behalf of the canvas
      window.
    - bpo-43522: Fix problem with hostname_checks_common_name.
      OpenSSL does not copy hostflags from struct SSL_CTX to
      struct SSL.
    - bpo-42967: Allow bytes separator argument in
      urllib.parse.parse_qs and urllib.parse.parse_qsl when
      parsing str query strings. Previously, this raised
      a TypeError.
    - bpo-43176: Fixed processing of a dataclass that inherits
      from a frozen dataclass with no fields. It is now correctly
      detected as an error.
    - bpo-41735: Fix thread locks in zlib module may go wrong in
      rare case. Patch by Ma Lin.
    - bpo-36470: Fix dataclasses with InitVars and replace().
      Patch by Claudiu Popa.
    - bpo-32745: Fix a regression in the handling of ctypes’
      ctypes.c_wchar_p type: embedded null characters would cause
      a ValueError to be raised. Patch by Zackery Spytz.
  * Documentation
    - bpo-43959: The documentation on the PyContextVar C-API was
      clarified.
    - bpo-43938: Update dataclasses documentation to express that
      FrozenInstanceError is derived from AttributeError.
    - bpo-43755: Update documentation to reflect that
      unparenthesized lambda expressions can no longer be the
      expression part in an if clause in comprehensions and
      generator expressions since Python 3.9.
    - bpo-43739: Fixing the example code in
      Doc/extending/extending.rst to declare and initialize the
      pmodule variable to be of the right type.
  * Tests
    - bpo-43961: Fix
      test_logging.test_namer_rotator_inheritance() on Windows:
      use os.replace() rather than os.rename(). Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - bpo-43842: Fix a race condition in the SMTP test of
      test_logging. Don’t close a file descriptor (socket) from
      a different thread while asyncore.loop() is polling the
      file descriptor. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - bpo-43811: Tests multiple OpenSSL versions on GitHub
      Actions. Use ccache to speed up testing.
    - bpo-43791: OpenSSL 3.0.0: Disable testing of legacy
      protocols TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Tests are failing with
      TLSV1_ALERT_INTERNAL_ERROR.
- Refreshed patches:
  - bpo-31046_ensurepip_honours_prefix.patch
  - python-3.3.0b1-fix_date_time_compiler.patch
- Add vendorized files from bluez-devel to enable building support for
  Bluetooth.

Wed Apr 28 16:39:54 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.4:
  - bpo#43710: Reverted the fix for https://bugs.python.org/issue42500
    as it changed the PyThreadState struct size and broke the 3.9.x ABI
    in the 3.9.3 release (visible on 32-bit platforms using binaries
    compiled using an earlier version of Python 3.9.x headers).
  - bpo#26053: Fixed bug where the pdb interactive run command echoed
    the args from the shell command line, even if those have been
    overridden at the pdb prompt.
  - bpo#42988 (bsc#1183374) CVE-2021-3426: Remove the getfile
    feature of the pydoc module which could be abused to read
    arbitrary files on the disk (directory traversal
    vulnerability). Moreover, even source code of Python modules
    can contain sensitive data like passwords. Vulnerability
    reported by David Schwörer.
  - bpo#43285: ftplib no longer trusts the IP address value
    returned from the server in response to the PASV command by
    default. This prevents a malicious FTP server from using the
    response to probe IPv4 address and port combinations on the
    client network. Code that requires the former vulnerable
    behavior may set a trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address attribute
    on their ftplib.FTP instances to True to re-enable it.
  - bpo#43439: Add audit hooks for gc.get_objects(),
    gc.get_referrers() and gc.get_referents(). Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - bpo#43660: Fix crash that happens when replacing sys.stderr
    with a callable that can remove the object while an exception
    is being printed. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo#43555: Report the column offset for SyntaxError for
    invalid line continuation characters. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo#43517: Fix misdetection of circular imports when using
    from pkg.mod import attr, which caused false positives in
    non-trivial multi-threaded code.
  - bpo#35883: Python no longer fails at startup with a fatal
    error if a command line argument contains an invalid Unicode
    character. The Py_DecodeLocale() function now escapes byte
    sequences which would be decoded as Unicode characters
    outside the [U+0000; U+10ffff] range.
  - bpo#43406: Fix a possible race condition where
    PyErr_CheckSignals tries to execute a non-Python signal
    handler.
  - bpo#42500: Improve handling of exceptions near recursion
    limit. Converts a number of Fatal Errors in RecursionErrors.
  - bpo#43433: xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy no longer ignores query
    and fragment in the URL of the server.
  - bpo#35930: Raising an exception raised in a “future” instance
    will create reference cycles.
  - bpo#43577: Fix deadlock when using ssl.SSLContext debug
    callback with ssl.SSLContext.sni_callback().
  - bpo#43521: ast.unparse can now render NaNs and empty sets.
  - bpo#43423: subprocess.communicate() no longer raises an
    IndexError when there is an empty stdout or stderr IO buffer
    during a timeout on Windows.
  - bpo#27820: Fixed long-standing bug of smtplib.SMTP where
    doing AUTH LOGIN with initial_response_ok=False will fail.
    The cause is that SMTP.auth_login _always_ returns a password
    if provided with a challenge string, thus non-compliant with
    the standard for AUTH LOGIN. Also fixes bug with the test for
    smtpd.
  - bpo#43332: Improves the networking efficiency of http.client
    when using a proxy via set_tunnel(). Fewer small send calls
    are made during connection setup.
  - bpo#43399: Fix ElementTree.extend not working on iterators
    when using the Python implementation
  - bpo#43316: The python -m gzip command line application now
    properly fails when detecting an unsupported extension. It
    exits with a non-zero exit code and prints an error message
    to stderr.
  - bpo#43260: Fix TextIOWrapper can not flush internal buffer
    forever after very large text is written.
  - bpo#42782: Fail fast in shutil.move() to avoid creating
    destination directories on failure.
  - bpo#37193: Fixed memory leak in socketserver.ThreadingMixIn
    introduced in Python 3.7.
  - bpo#43199: Answer “Why is there no goto?” in the Design and
    History FAQ.
  - bpo#43407: Clarified that a result from time.monotonic(),
    time.perf_counter(), time.process_time(), or
    time.thread_time() can be compared with the result from any
    following call to the same function - not just the next
    immediate call.
  - bpo#27646: Clarify that ‘yield from <expr>’ works with any
    iterable, not just iterators.
  - bpo#36346: Update some deprecated unicode APIs which are
    documented as “will be removed in 4.0” to “3.12”. See PEP 623
    for detail.
  - bpo#37945: Fix test_getsetlocale_issue1813() of test_locale:
    skip the test if setlocale() fails. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo#41561: Add workaround for Ubuntu’s custom OpenSSL
    security level policy.
  - bpo#43288: Fix test_importlib to correctly skip Unicode file
    tests if the fileystem does not support them.
  - bpo#43617: Improve configure.ac: Check for presence of
    autoconf-archive package and remove our copies of M4 macros.
  - bpo#42225: Document that IDLE can fail on Unix either from
    misconfigured IP masquerage rules or failure displaying
    complex colored (non-ascii) characters.
  - bpo#43283: Document why printing to IDLE’s Shell is often
    slower than printing to a system terminal and that it can be
    made faster by pre-formatting a single string before
    printing.

Tue Feb  9 01:37:59 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Add Obsoletes for python3-base when primary interpreter is set to
  properly replace it during upgrades.  (bsc#1181324)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 22:02:03 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.1:
  Security bugs:
  - Prevented potential DoS attack via CPU and RAM exhaustion
    when processing malformed Apple Property List files in binary
    format.
  - The plistlib module no longer accepts entity declarations in
    XML plist files to avoid XML vulnerabilities. This should not
    affect users as entity declarations are not used in regular
    plist files.
  - Add volatile to the accumulator variable in
    hmac.compare_digest, making constant-time-defeating
    optimizations less likely.
  Core and Builtins
  - Allow assignment expressions in set literals and set
    comprehensions as per PEP 572. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Fix a regression introduced by the new parser, where an
    unparenthesized walrus operator was not allowed within
    generator expressions.
  - types.GenericAlias objects can now be the targets of
    weakrefs.
  - Fixed a bug in the PEG parser that was causing crashes in
    debug mode. Now errors are checked in left-recursive rules to
    avoid cases where such errors do not get handled in time and
    appear as long-distance crashes in other places.
  - Fixed a possible crash in the PEG parser when checking for
    the ‘!=’ token in the barry_as_flufl rule. Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - Fix handling of errors during creation of PyFunctionObject,
    which resulted in operations on uninitialized memory. Patch
    by Yonatan Goldschmidt.
  - Fix a bug in the parser, where a curly brace following
    a primary didn’t fail immediately. This led to invalid
    expressions like a {b} to throw a SyntaxError with a wrong
    offset, or invalid expressions ending with a curly brace like
    a { to not fail immediately in the REPL.
  - Fix possible buffer overflow in the new parser when checking
    for continuation lines. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Run the parser two times. On the first run, disable all the
    rules that only generate better error messages to gain
    performance. If there’s a parse failure, run the parser
    a second time with those enabled.
  - Document the default implementation of object.__eq__.
  - Fix peephole optimizer misoptimize conditional jump
    + JUMP_IF_NOT_EXC_MATCH pair.
  - The garbage collector now tracks all user-defined classes.
    Patch by Brandt Bucher.
  - Fixed potential issues with removing not completely
    initialized module from sys.modules when import fails.
  - Star-unpacking is now allowed for with item’s targets in the
    PEG parser.
  - Fixed stack overflow in issubclass() and isinstance() when
    getting the __bases__ attribute leads to infinite recursion.
  - When loading a native module and a load failure occurs,
    prevent a possible UnicodeDecodeError when not running in
    a UTF-8 locale by decoding the load error message using the
    current locale’s encoding.
  - Correctly count control blocks in ‘except’ in compiler.
    Ensures that a syntax error, rather a fatal error, occurs for
    deeply nested, named exception handlers.
  Library
  - types.GenericAlias will now raise a TypeError when attempting
    to initialize with a keyword argument. Previously, this would
    cause the interpreter to crash if the interpreter was
    compiled with debug symbols. This does not affect
    interpreters compiled for release. Patch by Ken Jin.
  - CGIHTTPRequestHandler.run_cgi() HTTP_ACCEPT improperly
    parsed. Replace the special purpose getallmatchingheaders
    with generic get_all method and add relevant tests.
  - inspect.findsource() now raises OSError instead of IndexError
    when co_lineno of a code object is greater than the file
    length. This can happen, for example, when a file is edited
    after it was imported. PR by Irit Katriel.
  - Fix handling of trailing comments by inspect.getsource().
  - ChainMap.__iter__ no longer calls __getitem__ on underlying
    maps
  - TracebackException no longer holds a reference to the
    exception’s traceback object. Consequently, instances of
    TracebackException for equivalent but non-equal exceptions
    now compare as equal.
  - We fixed an issue in pickle.whichmodule in which importing
    multiprocessing could change the how pickle identifies which
    module an object belongs to, potentially breaking the
    unpickling of those objects.
  - Clarify the error message for asyncio.IncompleteReadError
    when expected is None.
  - Extracting a symlink from a tarball should succeed and
    overwrite the symlink if it already exists. The fix is to
    remove the existing file or symlink before extraction. Based
    on patch by Chris AtLee, Jeffrey Kintscher, and Senthil
    Kumaran.
  - Fixed tkinter.ttk.Style.map(). The function accepts now the
    representation of the default state as empty sequence (as
    returned by Style.map()). The structure of the result is now
    the same on all platform and does not depend on the value of
    wantobjects.
  - Fix various issues with typing.Literal parameter handling
    (flatten, deduplicate, use type to cache key). Patch provided
    by Yurii Karabas.
  - Fix the threading.Thread class at fork: do nothing if the
    thread is already stopped (ex: fork called at Python exit).
    Previously, an error was logged in the child process.

    specified in user (group, extra_groups) overflows uid_t
    (gid_t).
  - Improve asyncio.wait function to create the futures set just
    one time.
  - InvalidFileException and RecursionError are now the only
    errors caused by loading malformed binary Plist file
    (previously ValueError and TypeError could be raised in some
    specific cases).
  - Pickling heap types implemented in C with protocols 0 and
    1 raises now an error instead of producing incorrect data.
  - plistlib: fix parsing XML plists with hexadecimal integer
    values
  - Fix an incorrectly formatted error from
    _codecs.charmap_decode() when called with a mapped value
    outside the range of valid Unicode code points. PR by Max
    Bernstein.
  - Fix pickling pure Python datetime.time subclasses. Patch by
    Dean Inwood.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing ctypes.util.find_library() to
    return None when triying to locate a library in an
    environment when gcc>=9 is available and ldconfig is not.
    Patch by Pablo Galindo

    always returns now the numeric code returned by Tk instead of
    the name of the event type.
  - fix tkinter.EventType Enum so all members are strings, and
    none are tuples
  - Fix SQLite3 segfault when backing up closed database. Patch
    contributed by Peter David McCormick.
  - Fix the tarfile module to write only basename of TAR file to
    GZIP compression header.
  - Allow ctypes.wintypes to be imported on non-Windows systems.
  - shutil.which() now ignores empty entries in PATHEXT instead
    of treating them as a match.
  - Fix time-of-check/time-of-action issue in
    subprocess.Popen.send_signal.
  - Fix --outfile for cProfile / profile not writing the output
    file in the original directory when the program being
    profiled changes the working directory. PR by Anthony
    Sottile.
  - ZipFile truncates files to avoid corruption when a shorter
    comment is provided in append (“a”) mode. Patch by Jan Mazur.

    attempts to replace a non-existent Content-Transfer-Encoding
    header.

    fixed in gdb 10.1.
  - Fix test_asyncio.test_call_later() race condition: don’t
    measure asyncio performance in the call_later() unit test.
    The test failed randomly on the CI.
  - Include _testinternalcapi module in Windows installer for
    test suite
  - Fix test_logging.test_race_between_set_target_and_flush():
    the test now waits until all threads complete to avoid
    leaking running threads.
  - Avoid a test failure in test_lib2to3 if the module has
    already imported at the time the test executes. Patch by
    Pablo Galindo.

  - Rewrite the Calltips doc section.
  - In calltips, stop reminding that ‘/’ marks the end of
    positional-only arguments.
  - Typing opening and closing parentheses inside the parentheses
    of a function call will no longer cause unnecessary
    “flashing” off and on of an existing open call-tip, e.g. when
    typed in a string literal.
  C API
  - Fix potential crash in deallocating method objects when
    dynamically allocated PyMethodDef’s lifetime is managed

- Last try before this results in an editwar:
  * remove importlib_resources and importlib-metadata 
    provides/obsoletes
  * import importlib_resources is not the same as
    import importlib.resources, same for metadata
  * The backport packages from PyPI needed for older flavors are
    specified as such for setuptools or in pyproject.toml. If a
    package requires them they typically add them with a python
    version qualifier and the packages have their own version
    numbers.

  - bpo-41162: Audit hooks are now cleared later during
    finalization to avoid missing events.
  - bpo-29778: Ensure python3.dll is loaded from correct locations 
    when Python is embedded (CVE-2020-15523).

    characters in http.client.putrequest(…).
  - bpo-41295: Resolve a regression in CPython 3.8.4 where defining
    “__setattr__” in a multi-inheritance setup and 
    calling up the hierarchy chain could fail if builtins/extension
    types were involved in the base types.
  - bpo-41247: Always cache the running loop holder when running 
    asyncio.set_running_loop.
  - bpo-41252: Fix incorrect refcounting in 
    _ssl.c’s _servername_callback().

    keyword list to overcome a bug that was '
    preventing Python from being properly compiled when using the
    XLC compiler. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo-41218: Python 3.8.3 had a regression where compiling with 
    ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT would 
    aggressively mark list comprehension with CO_COROUTINE. Now only
    list comprehension making use of async/await will tagged as so.
  - bpo-41175: Guard against a NULL pointer dereference within 
    bytearrayobject triggered by the bytearray() + bytearray() operation.

    loaded more than once. It now uses a global state rather than a module state.
  - bpo-39384: Fixed email.contentmanager to allow set_content() to set a 
    null string.
  - bpo-41300: Save files with non-ascii chars. 
    Fix regression released in 3.9.0b4 and 3.8.4.
  - bpo-37765: Add keywords to module name completion list. 
    Rewrite Completions section of IDLE doc.
  - bpo-40170: Revert PyType_HasFeature() change: it reads 
    again directly the PyTypeObject.tp_flags 
    member when the limited C API is not used, rather than always calling 
    PyType_GetFlags() which hides implementation details.

  is only 114kB and it provides python3-base with a working hashlib
  module.
  (also, this fixes bnc#743787)
