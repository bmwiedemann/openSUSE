  <title>Perl extension for Berkeley DB version 2, 3 or 4</title>
  <description>This Perl module provides an interface to most of the functionality available
in Berkeley DB versions 2, 3 and 4. In general it is safe to assume that the
interface provided here to be identical to the Berkeley DB interface. The main
changes have been to make the Berkeley DB API work in a Perl way. Note that if
you are using Berkeley DB 2.x, the new features available in
Berkeley DB 3.x or DB 4.x are not available via this module.</description>
