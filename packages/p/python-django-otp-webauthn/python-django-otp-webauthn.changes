- update to 0.6.0:
  * Add documentation for nearly all features and settings to the
    Sphinx documentation site
  * Add support for Related Origin Requests, a feature defined in
    the level 3 working draft of the WebAuthn specification. It
    makes simple, cross-domain sharing of Passkeys possible
  * Add support for redirecting after Passkey authentication by
    reading a `next` url parameter from the current view
  * Add support for Django 5.2 pending its final release
  * All Python code is now 100% covered by tests
  * Browser automation tests using Playwright and Chromium have
    been added to ensure the JavaScript implementation works as
    expected
  * The API views provided now explicitly indicate they only
    render JSON, disabling the browsable API (see #55 and #56, by
    AlmerCarbonEquity)
  * Fixed an issue where the display name of a Passkey would have
    the username between parenthesis for users that have both an
    empty `first_name` and `last_name`.
  * **Noteworthy:** the way WebAuthn user handles are generated
    has been changed to make them more privacy-friendly. There
    should be no breaking backward-compatibility issues.
  * For context: these are used by the browser to identify if it
    already has a Passkey stored for a given user account.
  * After registering a new Passkey, users are now automatically
    marked as 'mfa verified' in the context of `django_otp.login`
  * The default JavaScript implementation is now built using Node
    22
  * The default JavaScript implementation for interacting with
    the browser api has been updated to use
    `@simplewebauthn/browser` v13.1.0
