- Update to 2.2.0
  * Add conda as a new language. 
  * Remove python2 / python3.5 support. Note that pre-commit still 
    supports running hooks written in python2, but pre-commit itself 
    requires python 3.6+.
  * Removed pcre language, use pygrep instead. 
  * Don't filter GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY from environment when cloning.
  * Replace aspy.yaml with sort_keys=False. 
  * Add support for perl. 
  * Fix python healthy() check when python executable goes missing. 
  * Many more fixes and improvements, see upstream changelog
