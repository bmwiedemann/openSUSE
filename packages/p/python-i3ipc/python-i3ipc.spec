%description
python-i3ipc is a Python library for controlling the i3 window manager which
aims to be used by scripts and applications which interact with the window
manager like status line generators, notification daemons and pagers.

This library uses i3â€™s interprocess communication, which is the interface
that i3 WM uses to receive commands from client applications such as i3-msg. It
also features a publish/subscribe mechanism for notifying interested parties of
window manager events.
