  <title>L&lt;Pod::Coverage&gt; extension for L&lt;Moose&gt;</title>
  <description>When using the Pod::Coverage manpage in combination with the Moose manpage,
it will report any method imported from a Role. This is especially bad when
used in combination with the Test::Pod::Coverage manpage, since it takes
away its ease of use.

To use this module in combination with the Test::Pod::Coverage manpage, use
something like this:

  use Test::Pod::Coverage;
  all_pod_coverage_ok({ coverage_class =&gt; 'Pod::Coverage::Moose'});</description>
