- update to 1.6.0:
  * Add `install-all` command to install packages according to
    spec metadata file.
  * Introduce `pipx pin` and `pipx unpin` commands, which can be
    used to pin or unpin the version
  * of an installed package, so it will not be upgraded by `pipx
    upgrade` or `pipx upgrade-all`.
  * Add a new option `--pinned` to `pipx list` command for
    listing pinned packages only.
  * Add `pipx interpreter upgrade` command to upgrade local
    standalone python in micro/patch level
  * Add `--requirement` option to `inject` command to read list
    of packages from a text file.
  * Add `pipx upgrade-shared` command, to create/upgrade shared
    libraries as a standalone command.
  * Allow `upgrade` command to accept multiple packages as
    arguments.
  * Support Python version for `--python` arg when py launcher is
    not available
  * Make `install-all` gather errors in batch

Tue Apr  2 15:43:40 UTC 2024 - Eyad Issa <eyadlorenzo@gmail.com>

- Update to 1.5.0
  * Add --global option to pipx commands. - This will run the
    action in a global scope and affect environment for all system
    users.
  * Add a --fetch-missing-python flag to all commands that accept
    a --python flag. - When combined, this will automatically
    download a standalone copy of the requested python version if
    it's not already available on
    the user's system.
  * Add commands to list and prune standalone interpreters
  * Add --install option to pipx upgrade command. - This will
    install the package given as argument if it is not already
    installed.

  - Add a CACHEDIR.TAG to the cache directory to prevent it from being included in archives and backups. For more information about cache directory tags, see https://bford.info/cachedir

- 1.0.0
  - Support [argcomplete 2.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/2.0.0) (#790)
  - Include machinery to build a manpage for pipx with [argparse-manpage](https://pypi.org/project/argparse-manpage/).
  - Add better handling for 'app not found' when a single app is present in the project, and an improved error message (#733)
  - Fixed animations sending output to stdout, which can break JSON output. (#769)
  - Fix typo in `pipx upgrade-all` output

- 0.17.0
  - Support `pipx run` with version constraints and extras. (#697)

- 0.16.5
  - Fixed `pipx list` output phrasing to convey that python version displayed is the one with which package was installed.
  - Fixed `pipx install` to provide return code 0 if venv already exists, similar to pip’s behavior. (#736)
  - [docs] Update ansible's install command in [Programs to Try document](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/programs-to-try/#ansible) to work with Ansible 2.10+ (#742)

- 0.16.4
  - Fix to `pipx ensurepath` to fix behavior in user locales other than UTF-8, to fix #644. The internal change is to use userpath v1.6.0 or greater. (#700)
  - Fix virtual environment inspection for Python releases that uses an int for its release serial number. (#706)
  - Fix PermissionError in windows when pipx manages itself. (#718)

- 0.16.3
  - Organization: pipx is extremely pleased to now be a project of the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)! Note that our github URL has changed to [pypa/pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
  - Fixed `pipx list --json` to return valid json with no venvs installed. Previously would return an empty string to stdout. (#681)
  - Changed `pipx ensurepath` bash behavior so that only one of {`~/.profile`, `~/.bash\_profile`} is modified with the extra pipx paths, not both. Previously, if a `.bash_profile` file was created where one didn't exist, it could cause problems, e.g. #456. The internal change is to use userpath v1.5.0 or greater. (#684)
  - Changed default nox tests, Github Workflow tests, and pytest behavior to use local pypi server with fixed lists of available packages. This allows greater test isolation (no network pypi access needed) and determinism (fixed available dependencies.) It also allows running the tests offline with some extra preparation beforehand (See [Running Unit Tests Offline](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/contributing/#running-unit-tests-offline)). The old style tests that use the internet to access pypi.org are still available using `nox -s tests_internet` or `pytest --net-pypiserver tests`. (#686)

  * Colorama is now only installed on Windows. (#691)

- 0.16.2.1
  - Changed non-venv-info warnings and notices from `pipx list` to print to stderr. This especially prevents `pipx list --json` from printing invalid json to stdout. (#680)
  - Fixed bug that could cause uninstall on Windows with injected packages to uninstall too many apps from the local binary directory. (#679)

- 0.16.2.0
  - Fixed bug #670 where uninstalling a venv could erroneously uninstall other apps from the local binary directory. (#672)
  - Added `--json` switch to `pipx list` to output rich json-metadata for all venvs.
  - Ensured log files are utf-8 encoded to prevent Unicode encoding errors from occurring with emojis. (#646)
  - Fixed issue which made pipx incorrectly list apps as part of a venv when they were not installed by pipx. (#650)
  - Fixed old regression that would prevent pipx uninstall from cleaning up linked binaries if the venv was old and did not have pipx metadata. (#651)
  - Fixed bugs with suffixed-venvs on Windows. Now properly summarizes install, and actually uninstalls associated binaries for suffixed-venvs. (#653)
  - Changed venv minimum python version to 3.6, removing python 3.5 which is End of Life. (#666)

- 0.16.1.0
  - Introduce the `pipx.run` entry point group as an alternative way to declare an application for `pipx run`.
  - Fix cursor show/hide to work with older versions of Windows. (#610)
  - Support text colors on Windows. (#612)
  - Better platform unicode detection to avoid errors and allow showing emojis when possible. (#614)
  - Don't emit show cursor or hide cursor codes if STDERR is not a tty. (#620)
  - Sped up `pipx list` (#624).
  - pip errors no longer stream to the shell when pip fails during a pipx install. pip's output is now saved to a log file. In the shell, pipx will tell you the location of the log file and attempt to summarize why pip failed. (#625)
  - For `reinstall-all`, fixed bug where missing python executable would cause error. (#634)
  - Fix regression which prevented pipx from working with pythonloc (and `__pypackages__` folder). (#636)

- 0.16.0.0
  - New venv inspection! The code that pipx uses to examine and determine metadata in an installed venv has been made faster, better, and more reliable. It now uses modern python libraries like `packaging` and `importlib.metadata` to examine installed venvs. It also now properly handles installed package extras. In addition, some problems pipx has had with certain characters (like periods) in package names should be remedied.
  - Added reinstall command for reinstalling a single venv.
  - Changed `pipx run` on non-Windows systems to actually replace pipx process with the app process instead of running it as a subprocess. (Now using python's `os.exec*`)
  - [bugfix] Fixed bug with reinstall-all command when package have been installed using a specifier. Now the initial specifier is used.
  - [bugfix] Override display of `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` value when generating web documentation for `pipx install` #523
  - [bugfix] Wrap help documentation for environment variables.
  - [bugfix] Fixed uninstall crash that could happen on Windows for certain packages
  - [feature] Venv package name arguments now do not have to match exactly as pipx has them stored, but can be specified in any python-package-name-equivalent way. (i.e. case does not matter, and `.`, `-`, `_` characters are interchangeable.)
  - [change] Venvs with a suffix: A suffix can contain any characters, but for purposes of uniqueness, python package name rules apply--upper- and lower-case letters are equivalent, and any number of `.`, `-`, or `_` characters in a row are equivalent. (e.g. if you have a suffixed venv `pylint_1.0A` you could not add another suffixed venv called `pylint--1-0a`, as it would not be a unique name.)
  - [implementation detail] Pipx shared libraries (providing pip, setuptools, wheel to pipx) are no longer installed using pip arguments taken from the last regular pipx install. If you need to apply pip arguments to pipx's use of pip for its internal shared libraries, use PIP\_\* environment variables.
  - [feature] Autocomplete for venv names is no longer restricted to an exact match to the literal venv name, but will autocomplete any logically-similar python package name (i.e. case does not matter, and `.`, `-`, `_` characters are all equivalent.)
  - pipx now reinstalls its internal shared libraries when the user executes `reinstall-all`.
  - Made sure shell exit codes from every pipx command are correct. In the past some (like from `pipx upgrade`) were wrong. The exit code from `pipx runpip` is now the exit code from the `pip` command run. The exit code from `pipx list` will be 1 if one or more venvs have problems that need to be addressed.
  - pipx now writes a log file for each pipx command executed to `$PIPX_HOME/logs`, typically `~/.local/pipx/logs`. pipx keeps the most recent 10 logs and deletes others.
  - `pipx upgrade` and `pipx upgrade-all` now have a `--upgrade-injected` option which directs pipx to also upgrade injected packages.
  - `pipx list` now detects, identifies, and suggests a remedy for venvs with old-internal data (internal venv names) that need to be updated.
  - Added a "Troubleshooting" page to the pipx web documentation for common problems pipx users may encounter.
  - pipx error, warning, and other messages now word-wrap so words are not split across lines. Their appearance is also now more consistent.

- 0.15.6.0
  - [docs] Update license
  - [docs] Display a more idiomatic command for registering completions on fish.
  - [bugfix] Fixed regression in list, inject, upgrade, reinstall-all commands when suffixed packages are used.

- 0.15.5.1
  - [bugfix] Fixed regression of 0.15.5.0 which erroneously made installing from a local path with package extras not possible.

- 0.15.5.0
  - pipx now parses package specification before install. It removes (with warning) the `--editable` install option for any package specification that is not a local path. It also removes (with warning) any environment markers.
  - Disabled animation when we cannot determine terminal size or if the number of columns is too small. (Fixes #444)
  - [feature] Version of each injected package is now listed after name for `pipx list --include-injected`
  - Change metadata recorded from version-specified install to allow upgrades in future. Adds pipx dependency on `packaging` package.
  - [bugfix] Prevent python error in case where package has no pipx metadata and advise user how to fix.
  - [feature] `ensurepath` now also ensures that pip user binary path containing pipx itself is in user's PATH if pipx was installed using `pip install --user`.
  - [bugfix] For `pipx install`, fixed failure to install if user has `PIP_USER=1` or `user=true` in pip.conf. (#110)
  - [bugfix] Requiring userpath v1.4.1 or later so ensure Windows bug is fixed for `ensurepath` (#437)
  - [feature] log pipx version (#423)

  - [bugfix] On Windows, pipx now lists correct Windows apps (#217)
  - [bugfix] Fixed a `pipx install` bug causing incorrect python binary to be used when using the optional --python argument in certain situations, such as running pipx from a Framework python on macOS and specifying a non-Framework python.

- 0.15.1.2
  - [bugfix] Fix recursive search of dependencies' apps so no apps are missed.

- 0.15.0.0

  Upgrade instructions: When upgrading to 0.15.0.0 or above from a pre-0.15.0.0 version, you must re-install all packages to take advantage of the new persistent pipx metadata files introduced in this release. These metadata files store pip specification values, injected packages, any custom pip arguments, and more in each main package's venv. You can do this by running `pipx reinstall-all` or `pipx uninstall-all`, then reinstalling manually.

  - `install` now has no `--spec` option. You may specify any valid pip specification for `install`'s main argument.
  - `inject` will now accept pip specifications for dependency arguments
  - Metadata is now stored for each application installed, including install options like `--spec`, and injected packages. This information allows upgrade, upgrade-all and reinstall-all to work properly even with non-pypi installed packages. (#222)
  - `upgrade` options `--spec` and `--include-deps` were removed. Pipx now uses the original options used to install each application instead. (#222)
  - `upgrade-all` options `--include-deps`, `--system-site-packages`, `--index-url`, `--editable`, and `--pip-args` were removed. Pipx now uses the original options used to install each application instead. (#222)
  - `reinstall-all` options `--include-deps`, `--system-site-packages`, `--index-url`, `--editable`, and `--pip-args` were removed. Pipx now uses the original options used to install each application instead. (#222)
  - Handle missing interpreters more gracefully (#146)
  - Change `reinstall-all` to use system python by default for apps. Now use `--python` option to specify a different python version.
  - Remove the PYTHONPATH environment variable when executing any command to prevent conflicts between pipx dependencies and package dependencies when pipx is installed via homebrew. Homebrew can use PYTHONPATH manipulation instead of virtual environments. (#233)
  - Add printed summary after successful call to `pipx inject`
  - Support associating apps with Python 3.5
  - Improvements to animation status text
  - Make `--python` argument in `reinstall-all` command optional
  - Use threads on OS's without support for semaphores
  - Stricter parsing when passing `--` argument as delimiter
- Removed upstreamed patches:
  - test_alternative_names.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 00:20:19 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Don't use %python3_only command, but properly use alternatives.
- Add test_alternative_names.patch to make tests pass even
  with alternated name of the binary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 14:08:11 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Activate subset of test suite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 08:04:57 AM UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Initial spec for v0.14.0.0
