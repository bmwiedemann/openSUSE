- Update to 0.7.0
  * feat(experimental)!: Require include in _get_anywidget_state
    signature (#317)
  * Allows implementors to avoid re-serializing fields which aren't
    needed to send to the front end. This is a BREAKING change
    because it requires implementors of _get_anywidget_state to
    account for include in the function signature.

- Update to 0.6.5
  * fix: disable auto-reloading in dist-packages (#276)
  * When the package is located in dist-packages, auto-reloading is
    now disabled. This prevents unnecessary warnings when the
    package is used in environments like Google Colab which are
    likely non-development installs.
- Release 0.6.4
  * fix: Keep support for binary traitlets (#274)
  * Uses structuredClone to ensure binary data is automatically
    serialized, correctly. Applies changes reverted in ipywidgets
    8.1.1.
