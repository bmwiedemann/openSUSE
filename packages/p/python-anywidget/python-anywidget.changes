- Update to 0.9.0
  * Require ANYWIDGET_HMR to opt-in to HMR during development
  * Introduce front-end widget lifecycle methods (#395)
  * Deprecation Notice: Exporting a render from the front-end
    widget will trigger a deprecation notice in the browser
    console. The preferred way to define a widget's front-end code
    is now with a default object export.
  * These methods introduce lifecycle hooks for widget developers:
    - initialize: is executed once in the lifetime of a widget. It
      has access to the only the model to setup non-view event
      handlers or state to share across views.
    - render: is executed once per view, or for each notebook
      output cell. It has access to the model and a unique el DOM
      element. This method should be familiar and is used to setup
      event handlers or access state specific to that view.
  * Fix serialization of layout trait (#426)
- Add anywidget-pr439-py312mock.patch gh#manzt/anywidget#439

- Update to 0.8.1
  * fix: Skip Promise serialization for ipywidget's layout/style
    traits (#412)

Sat Dec 23 18:33:46 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.8.0
  * Remove re-export of @anywidget/vite from main package (#398)
  * Breaking change. If using our Vite plugin, please make sure to
    install @anywidget/vite (rather than importing from anywidget
    main package). This change allows us to version the Vite plugin
    and anywidget's core separately.
    
    // vite.config.mjs
    import { defineConfig } from "vite";
    -- import anywidget from "anywidget/vite";
    ++ import anywidget from "@anywidget/vite";
    
    If you are already using @anywidget/vite, there are no changes
    necessary.

- Update to 0.7.1
  * feat: Raise Python error when file is missing (#345)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 14 08:48:18 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.7.0
  * feat(experimental)!: Require include in _get_anywidget_state
    signature (#317)
  * Allows implementors to avoid re-serializing fields which aren't
    needed to send to the front end. This is a BREAKING change
    because it requires implementors of _get_anywidget_state to
    account for include in the function signature.

Sat Sep 23 16:38:24 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.6.5
  * fix: disable auto-reloading in dist-packages (#276)
  * When the package is located in dist-packages, auto-reloading is
    now disabled. This prevents unnecessary warnings when the
    package is used in environments like Google Colab which are
    likely non-development installs.
- Release 0.6.4
  * fix: Keep support for binary traitlets (#274)
  * Uses structuredClone to ensure binary data is automatically
    serialized, correctly. Applies changes reverted in ipywidgets
    8.1.1.
