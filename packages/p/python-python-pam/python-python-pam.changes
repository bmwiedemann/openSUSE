- Version update to 2.0.2:
  * Surface fixes:
    * Fixed #31 whereby I changed the boolean response in 2.0.0 to 
      a PAM constant. This reverts to the boolean response as 
      existed in v1.8.5. The result code is still stored in the 
      obj.code attribute.
    * Added the PamAuthenticate.authenticate() method signature 
      and docstring to both of the new and legacy interfaces. 
    * Changed the PamAuthenticate.authenticate() type hinting so it 
      didn't interfere with the docstring.

  * Under the hood changes:
    * Start mocking the libpam methods so we can wholly disassociate 
      ourselves from the underlying system. This lets us test more 
      of the actual python code and lets us start injecting errors 
      to test for.
 
- Version update to 2.0.0:
  * The surface functionality hasn't changed much but a few bugs 
    have been fixed. Under the hood, a lot has changed. 
    Functionality has now been moved into a class that helped with
    value tracking. I planned on removing Python 2 support but 
    was convinced to leave it in for now as apparently there are 
    still a lot of python2 users.

  * Most testing has moved to occur underneath tox, this is superior
    as it provides for testing in a clean environment and an
    installed environment.
