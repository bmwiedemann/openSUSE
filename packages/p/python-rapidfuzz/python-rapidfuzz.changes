Sat Jul  6 18:31:21 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.9.4:
  * fix bug in Levenshtein.editops and Levenshtein.opcodes which
    could lead to incorrect results and crashes for some inputs
  * fix None handling for queries in process.cdist for scorers
    not supporting SIMD
  * fix supported versions of taskflow in cmake to be in the
    range v3.3 - v3.7
  * disable AVX2 on MacOS since it did lead to illegal
    instructions being generated
  * significantly improve type hints for the library
  * fix cmake version parsing
  * use the correct version of rapidfuzz-cpp when building
    against a system installed version
  * added process.cpdist which allows pairwise comparison of two
    collection of inputs
  * fix some minor errors in the type hints
  * fix potentially incorrect results of JaroWinkler when using
    high prefix weights

Sat Apr  6 12:11:45 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.7.0:
  * reduce importtime

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 13 19:02:16 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.6.2:
  * upgrade rapidfuzz-cpp which includes a fix for build issues
    on some compilers
  * fix some issues with the sphinx config

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 21 10:46:47 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.6.1:
  * fix overflow error on systems with ``sizeof(size_t) < 8``
  * fix pure python fallback implementation of ``fuzz.token_set_ratio``
  * properly link with ``-latomic`` if ``std::atomic<uint64_t>``
    is not natively supported
  * add banded implementation of LCS / Indel. This improves the
    runtime from ``O((|s1|/64) * |s2|)`` to
    ``O((score_cutoff/64) * |s2|)``
  * upgrade to ``Cython==3.0.7``
  * cdist for many metrics now returns a matrix of ``uint32``
    instead of ``int32`` by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 27 16:06:20 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.5.2:
  * skip pandas ``pd.NA`` similar to ``None``
  * add ``score_multiplier`` argument to ``process.cdist`` which
    allows multiplying the end result scores
  * with a constant factor.
  * drop support for Python 3.7
  * improve performance of simd implementation for ``LCS`` /
    ``Indel`` / ``Jaro`` / ``JaroWinkler``
  * improve performance of Jaro and Jaro Winkler for long
    sequences
  * implement ``process.extract`` with ``limit=1`` using
    ``process.extractOne`` which can be faster
  * the preprocessing function was always called through Python
    due to a broken C-API version check
  * fix wraparound issue in simd implementation of Jaro and Jaro
    Winkler
  * upgrade to ``Cython==3.0.3``
  * add simd implementation for Jaro and Jaro Winkler
  * add missing tag for python 3.12 support
  * upgrade to ``Cython==3.0.2``
  * implement the remaining missing features from the C++
    implementation in the pure Python implementation
  * added support for Python 3.12
  * build x86 with sse2/avx2 runtime detection
  * upgrade to ``taskflow==3.6``
  * added keyword argument ``pad`` to Hamming distance. This
    controls whether sequences of different
  * length should be padded or lead to a ``ValueError``
  * improve consistency of exception messages between the C++ and
    pure Python implementation
  * upgrade required Cython version to ``Cython==3.0.0b3``
  * allow the usage of ``Hamming`` for different string lengths.
    Length differences are handled as insertions / deletions
  * remove support for boolean preprocessor functions in
    ``rapidfuzz.fuzz`` and ``rapidfuzz.process``.
  * The processor argument is now always a callable or ``None``.
  * update defaults of the processor argument to be ``None``
    everywhere. For affected functions this can change results,
    since strings are no longer preprocessed.
  * fix incorrect tag dispatching implementation leading to AVX2
    instructions in the SSE2 code path
  * add wheels for windows arm64
  * allow the usage of finite generators as choices in
    ``process.extract``
  * fix handling of non symmetric scorers in pure python version
    of ``process.cdist``
  * fix default dtype handling when using ``process.cdist`` with
    pure python scorers

- version 2.13.5
  * Added
    + added docs to sdist
  * Fixed
    + fix two cases of undefined behavior in process.cdist
- version 2.13.4
  * Changed
    + handle float("nan") similar to None for query / choice, since this is
      common for non-existent data in tools like numpy
  * Fixed
    + fix handling on None/float("nan") in process.distance
    + use absolute imports inside tests
- version 2.13.3
  * Fixed
    + improve handling of functions wrapped using functools.wraps
    + fix broken fallback to Python implementation when the a ImportError occurs on import.
      This can e.g. occur when the binary has a dependency on libatomic, but it
      is unavailable on the system
    + define CMAKE_C_COMPILER_AR/CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_AR/CMAKE_C_COMPILER_RANLIB/CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_RANLIB
      if they are not defined yet
