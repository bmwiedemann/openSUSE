  <title>An Encode::Encoding subclass that detects the encoding of data</title>
  <description>This Perl module is an Encode::Encoding subclass that uses
Encode::Detect::Detector to determine the charset of the input data and then
decodes it using the encoder of the detected charset.

It is similar to Encode::Guess, but does not require the configuration of a set
of expected encodings. Like Encode::Guess, it only supports decoding--it cannot
encode.</description>
