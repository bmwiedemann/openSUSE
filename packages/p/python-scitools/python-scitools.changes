- Properly remove she-bang lines from non-executable files (bnc#840511)
- Update to version 0.9.0:
  * LaTeX support in legends and titles in Easyviz. The output is reasonable
    in most formats.
  * Updated movie module with a new encoder "HTML": javascript code for
    displaying PNG/JPG/GIF files as a movie in a webbrowser.
  * Gnuplot postscript plots has linewidth 4 instead of 1.2 for clearer
    line in hardcopy plots.
  * New commands in the scitools script:
    * replace for textual replacement (subst is the counterpart for
      regular expression replacements)
    * pyreport for a version of pyreport that works with both
      scitools.easyviz and matplotlib
  * Added misc.function_UI function for autogenerating a user interface
    to a module such that a range of functions can be called from the
    command line with arguments also given on the command
    line. Autogeneration of help too.
  * Added Recorder class for recording what happens with an
    object. Can be used to see how Easyviz actually works with the
    underlying module. In this way, it becomes apparent what Easyviz
    actually performs, and if desired, the actions can be done
    (manually) outside Easyviz.
  * Rewritten the scitools simplified profiler to take advantage of new
    profiling tools in Python.
  * Added a numpyutils.PiecewiseConstant class for piecewise constant
    functions.
  * Added the avplotter module for making vertical plots in the terminal
    window. Handy when experimenting with very long time series that can
    be plotted vertically, line by line.
  * Updated documentation.
