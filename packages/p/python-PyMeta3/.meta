  <title>PyMeta</title>
  <description>PyMeta is an implementation of OMeta, an object-oriented pattern-matching
language developed by Alessandro Warth
(http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~awarth/ometa/). PyMeta provides a compact syntax based
on Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) for common lexing, parsing and
tree-transforming activities in a way that's easy to reason about for Python
programmers.</description>
