- update to version 1.0.1:
  * A list of all issues can be found on github
- additional changes from version 1.0.0:
  * This version is equivalent to v0.3.7, but finally acknowledges
    that GitPython is stable and production ready
- additional changes from version 0.3.7:
  * IndexFile.add() will now write the index without any extension
    data by default
  * Renamed ignore_tree_extension_data keyword argument in
    IndexFile.write(...) to ignore_extension_data
  * If the git command executed during Remote.push(...)|fetch(...)
    returns with an non-zero exit code and GitPython didn't obtain
    any head-information, the corresponding GitCommandError will be
    raised
  * If the git executable can't be found in the PATH or at the path
    provided by GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE, this is made obvious by
    throwing GitCommandNotFound, both on unix and on windows.
  * A list of all issues can be found on github
- additional changes from version 0.3.6:
  * special members like __init__ are now listed in the API
    documentation
  * tutorial section was revised entirely, more advanced examples
    were added
  * As rev_parse will now throw BadName as well as BadObject,
    client code will have to catch both exception types
  * Repo.working_tree_dir now returns None if it is bare
  * IndexFile.add() previously raised AssertionError when paths
    where used with bare repository, now it raises
    InvalidGitRepositoryError
  * Added Repo.merge_base() implementation. See the respective
    issue on github

  * Internally, hexadecimal SHA1 are treated as ascii encoded
    strings
  * Id attribute of Commit objects is now hexsha, instead of binsha
  * IMPORTANT: If you were using the config_writer(), you
    implicitly relied on __del__ to work as expected to flush
    changes. To be sure changes are flushed under PY3, you will
    have to call the new release() method to trigger a flush
  * The Tree now has a .join('name') method which is equivalent to
    tree / 'name'
- additional changes from version 0.3.3:
  * When fetching, pulling or pushing, and an error occours, it
