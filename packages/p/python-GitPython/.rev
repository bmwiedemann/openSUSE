    will be used to fill the void.
- Update to version 2.0.9
  * Bugfixes
  * `tag.commit` will now resolve commits deeply.
  * `Repo` objects can now be pickled, which helps with multi-processing.
  * `Head.checkout()` now deals with detached heads, which is when it will return
    the `HEAD` reference instead.
  * `DiffIndex.iter_change_type(...)` produces better results when diffing
- update to 2.0.8:
  * Py2.6 support dropped
  * lots of new features and bugfixes

  * IMPORTANT: If you were using the config_writer(), you
    implicitly relied on __del__ to work as expected to flush
    changes. To be sure changes are flushed under PY3, you will
