- update to 0.15.1:
  * Disallow creating an instruction targeting a
    pseudo/instrumented opcode PR #133
  * Fixes encoding of 0 as a varint PR #132
  * Correct spelling of "INTRINSIC" in several places; this
    affected some ops in Python 3.12.  PR #131

Mon Sep 18 10:14:40 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.15.0:
  * Add support for Python 3.12 PR #122
  * Support for Python 3.12, comes with a number of changes
    reflecting changes in CPython bytecode itself:
  * handle the ability of ``LOAD_ATTR`` to replace
    ``LOAD_METHOD``
    As a consequence the argument is now a ``tuple[bool, str]``
    similarly ``LOAD_SUPER_ATTR`` which uses the 2 lowest bits as
    flag takes a ``tuple[bool, bool, str]`` as argument
  * ``POP_JUMP_IF_*`` instructions are undirected in Python 3.12
  * ``YIELD_VALUE`` now takes an argument
  * Support for ``CALL_INSTRINSIC_1/2`` led to the addition of 2
    new enums to represent the argument

Sat May 27 21:36:54 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.14.2:
  * allow to convert a CFG, for which stack sizes have not been
    computed, to Bytecode even in the presence of mergeable
    TryBegin/TryEnd
  * remove spurious TryEnd leftover when going from CFG to
    Bytecode

- update to 0.14.1:
  * allow to disassemble code containing ``EXTENDED_ARG``
    targeting a ``NOP`` PR #117

- Update to 0.14.0
  * New features:
  Removed the peephole optimizer PR #107
  Basically changes in Python 3.11 made it hard to port and the maintenance cost exceeded the perceived use. It could be re-added if there is a demand for it.
  Add support for Python 3.11 PR #107
  Support for Python 3.11, comes with a number of changes reflecting changes in CPython bytecode itself:
  support for the exception table in ConcreteBytecode
  support for pseudo-instruction TryBegin and TryEnd describing the exception table in Bytecode and ControlflowGraph
  new keyword arguments in conversion method related to computations required for the exception table
  handling of CACHE opcode at the ConcreteBytecode level
  handling of the ability of LOAD_GLOBAL to push NULL (the argument is now a tuple[bool, str])
  support for end_lineno and column offsets in instructions
  support for co_qualname (as qualname on bytecode objects)
  and a number of internal changes related to changes in the internal bytecode representation.
  Add type annotations and make types stricter PR # 105 In particular, ConcreteInstr does not inherit from Instr anymore and one cannot
  use ConcreteInstr in Bytecode object. This is saner than before.
  * Bugfixes:
  Removed EXC_MATCH from the Compare enumeration starting with Python 3.9. The new JUMP_IF_NOT_EXC_MATCH opcode should be used instead.
  Removed IN, NOT_IN, IS, NOT_IS from the Compare enumeration starting with Python 3.9. The new CONTAINS_OP and IS_OP opcodes should be used instead.
  Add proper pre and post stack effects to all opcodes (up to Python 3.11) PR #106 #107
  * Maintenance:
  Make the install process PEP517 compliant PR #97
  Drop support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 PR #100

Thu Nov 18 11:47:11 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 0.13.0
  * Add support for Python 3.10 new encoding of line number. This support is
    minimal in the sense that we still systematically assign a line number
    while the new format allow bytecode with absolutely no line number. PR #72
  * Fix handling of RERAISE (introduced in 3.9) when creating a ControlFlowGraph,
    previously it was not considered final. PR #72
  * Fix line table assembly in Python 3.10. PR #85

- Update to 0.12.0
  * All calculations of stacksize now check for stack underflow to
    avoid segfault at runtime PR #69
  * Fix recursion limitations when compiling bytecode with numerous basic
    blocks. PR #57
  * Fix handling of line offsets. Issue #67, PR #71
  * Forbid an :class:`Instr` to hold an EXTENDED_ARG op_code PR #65
  * Forbid the use of :class:`ConcreteInstr` in :class:`Bytecode` and
    :class:`ControlFlowGraph` PR #65
    This is motivated by the extra complexity that handling possible EXTENDED_ARG
    instruction in those representation would bring (stack computation, etc)
  * Always remove EXTENDED_ARG when converting :class:`ConcreteBytecode` to
    :class:`Bytecode` PR #65
  * This is equivalent to say that the :class:`ConcreteBytecode` converted to
    :class:`Bytecode` was generated by :meth:`ConcreteBytecode.from_code`
    with extended_args=False
  * :class:`Instr` now has a new method :meth:`Instr.pre_and_post_stack_effect`
    for checking the prerequisite stack size of an operation PR #69
  * :meth:`_compute_stack_size` now uses :meth:`Instr.pre_and_post_stack_effect`
    to compute the stack size to reject code that will lead to runtime segfault
    caused by stack underflow PR #69
