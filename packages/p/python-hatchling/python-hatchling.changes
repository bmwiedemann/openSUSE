- update to version 1.4.1:
  * Fixed:
    + Fix forced inclusion of important files like licenses for
      sdist targets when using the explicit selection options
    + Don't sort project URL metadata so that the rendered order
      on PyPI can be controlled

- update to version 1.4.0:
  * Changed: The packages option uses the new only-include option
    to provide targeted inclusion, since that is desired most of
    the time
  * Added:
    + Support PEP 561 type hinting
    + Add version build hook
    + Add only-include option
    + The editable version of wheel targets now respects the
      force-include option by default
    + The force-include option now supports path rewriting with the
      sources option
    + The wheel target shared-data and extra-metadata options now
      respect file selection options
    + The wheel target now auto-detects single module layouts
    + Improve performance by never entering directories that are
      guaranteed to be undesirable like __pycache__ rather than
      excluding individual files within
    + Update SPDX license information to version 3.17
  * Fixed:
    + Don't write empty entry points file for wheel targets if
      there are no entry points defined
    + Allow metadata hooks to set the version in all cases
    + Prevent duplicate file entries from inclusion when using the
      force-include option
