- update to version 1.6.0:

      to better match expected behavior

      modules

  * Fixed:
    + Fix removing sources using an empty string value in the

  requirement

Mon Jul  4 16:13:37 UTC 2022 - Benoît Monin <benoit.monin@gmx.fr>

- update to version 1.4.0:

    + Add version build hook
    + Add only-include option
    + The editable version of wheel targets now respects the
