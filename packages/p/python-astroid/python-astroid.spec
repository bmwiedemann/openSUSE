%description
This module provides a common base representation of Python source code for
projects such as pychecker, pyreverse, pylint. The development of this library
is governed by pylint's needs.

It provides a compatible representation which comes from the _ast
module. It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new
node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
usages. They include some support for static inference and local name
scopes. Furthermore, astroid builds partial trees by inspecting living
objects.
