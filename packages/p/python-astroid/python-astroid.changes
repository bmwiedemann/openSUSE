-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 13 10:03:16 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.4.3
  * pkg_resources brain tips are a bit more specific,
    by specifiying proper returns.
  * Standard library modules are properly detected by is_standard_module.
    This should fix issues such as https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/725.
- Update to version 1.4.2
  * The slots() method conflates all the slots from the ancestors
    into a list of current and parent slots.
    We're doing this because this is the right semantics of slots,
    they get inherited, as long as each parent defines a __slots__
    entry.
  * Revert to using printf-style formatting in as_string, in order
    to avoid a potential problem with encodings when using .format.
    Closes issue #273.
  * assigned_stmts methods have the same signature from now on.
    They used to have different signatures and each one made
    assumptions about what could be passed to other implementations,
    leading to various possible crashes when one or more arguments
    weren't given. Closes issue #277.
- update to version 1.4.1:
  * Add support for handling Uninferable nodes when calling as_string

    Some object, for instance List or Tuple can have, after inference,
    Uninferable as their elements, happening when their components
    weren't couldn't be inferred properly. This means that as_string
    needs to cope with expecting Uninferable nodes part of the other
    nodes coming for a string transformation. The patch adds a visit
    method in AsString and "accept" on Yes / Uninferable nodes.
    Closes issue #270.
- update to version 1.4.0:
  * Class.getattr('__mro__') returns the actual MRO. Closes issue #128.
  * The logilab-common dependency is not needed anymore as the needed code
    was integrated into astroid.
  * Add 'assert_equals' method in nose.tools's brain plugin.
  * Generated enum member stubs now support IntEnum and multiple
    base classes.
  * Add brain tips for multiprocessing.Manager and
    multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.
  * Add brain tips for multiprocessing post Python 3.4+,
    where the module level functions are retrieved with getattr
    from a context object, leading to many no-member errors
    in Pylint.
  * The Generator objects inferred with `infer_call_result`
    from functions have as parent the function from which they
    are returned.
  * Understand partially the 3-argument form of `type`.
    The only change is that astroid understands members
    passed in as dictionaries as the third argument.
  * Improve the inference of Getattr nodes when dealing with
    abstract properties from the abc module.

    In astroid.bases.Instance._wrap_attr we had a detection
    code for properties, which basically inferred whatever
    a property returned, passing the results up the stack,
    to the igetattr() method. It handled only the builtin property
    but the new patch also handles a couple of other properties,
    such as abc.abstractproperty.
  * UnboundMethod.getattr calls the getattr of its _proxied object
    and doesn't call super(...) anymore.

    It previously crashed, since the first ancestor in its mro was
    bases.Proxy and bases.Proxy doesn't implement the .getattr method.
    Closes issue #91.
  * Don't hard fail when calling .mro() on a class which has
    combined both newstyle and old style classes. The class
    in question is actually newstyle (and the __mro__ can be
    retrieved using Python).

    .mro() fallbacks to using .ancestors() in that case.
  * Class.local_attr and Class.local_attr_ancestors uses internally
    a mro lookup, using .mro() method, if they can.

    That means for newstyle classes, when trying to lookup a member
    using one of these functions, the first one according to the
    mro will be returned. This reflects nicely the reality,
    but it can have as a drawback the fact that it is a behaviour
    change (the previous behaviour was incorrect though). Also,
    having bases which can return multiple values when inferred
    will not work with the new approach, because .mro() only
    retrieves the first value inferred from a base.
  * Expose a implicit_metaclass() method in Class. This will return
    a builtins.type instance for newstyle classes.
  * Add two new exceptions for handling MRO error cases. DuplicateBasesError
    is emitted when duplicate bases are found in a class,
    InconsistentMroError is raised when the method resolution is determined
    to be inconsistent. They share a common class, MroError, which
    is a subclass of ResolveError, meaning that this change is backwards
    compatible.
  * Classes aren't marked as interfaces anymore, in the `type` attribute.
  * Class.has_dynamic_getattr doesn't return True for special methods
    which aren't implemented in pure Python, as it is the case for extension modules.

    Since most likely the methods were coming from a live object, this implies
    that all of them will have __getattr__ and __getattribute__ present and it
    is wrong to consider that those methods were actually implemented.
  * Add `igetattr` method to scoped_nodes.Function.
  * Add support for Python 3.5's MatMul operation: see PEP 465 for more
    details.
  * NotImplemented is detected properly now as being part of the
    builtins module. Previously trying to infer the Name(NotImplemented)
    returned an YES object.
  * Add proper grammatical names for `infered` and `ass_type` methods,
    namely `inferred` and `assign_type`.

    The old methods will raise PendingDeprecationWarning, being slated
    for removal in astroid 2.0.
  * Add new AST names in order to be similar to the ones
    from the builtin ast module.

    With this change, Getattr becomes Attributes, Backquote becomes
    Repr, Class is ClassDef, Function is FunctionDef,  Discard is Expr,
    CallFunc is Call, From is ImportFrom, AssName is AssignName
    and AssAttr is AssignAttr. The old names are maintained for backwards
    compatibility and they are interchangeable, in the sense that using
    Discard will use Expr under the hood and the implemented visit_discard
    in checkers will be called with Expr nodes instead. The AST does not
    contain the old nodes, only the interoperability between them hides this
    fact. Recommandations to move to the new nodes are emitted accordingly,
    the old names will be removed in astroid 2.0.
  * Star unpacking in assignments returns properly a list,
    not the individual components. Closes issue #138.
  * Lambdas found at class level, which have a `self` argument, are considered
  * Add annotation support for function.as_string(). Closes issue #37.
  * Add support for indexing bytes on Python 3.
    BoundMethods when accessing them from instances of their class.
  * Add support for inferring subscript on instances, which will
    use __getitem__. Closes issue #124.
  * Understand metaclasses added with six.add_metaclass decorator. Closes issue #129.
  * Add a new convenience API, `astroid.parse`, which can be used to retrieve
    an astroid AST from a source code string, similar to how ast.parse can be
    used to obtain a Python AST from a source string. This is the test_utils.build_module
    promoted to a public API.
  * do_import_module passes the proper relative_only flag if the level is higher
    than 1. This has the side effect that using `from .something import something`
    in a non-package will finally result in an import-error on Pylint's side.
    Until now relative_only was ignored, leading to the import of `something`,
    if it was globally available.
  * There's a new separate step for transforms.

    Until now, the transforms were applied at the same time the tree was
    being built. This was problematic if the transform functions were
    using inference, since the inference was executed on a partially
    constructed tree, which led to failures when post-building
    information was needed (such as setting the _from_names
    for the From imports).
    Now there's a separate step for transforms, which are applied
    using transform.TransformVisitor.
    There's a couple of other related changes:
    + astroid.parse and AstroidBuilder gained a new parameter
      `apply_transforms`, which is a boolean flag, which will
      control if the transforms are applied. We do this because
      there are uses when the vanilla tree is wanted, without
      any implicit modification.
    + the transforms are also applied for builtin modules,
      as a side effect of the fact that transform visiting
      was moved in AstroidBuilder._post_build from
      AstroidBuilder._data_build.
    Closes issue #116.
  * Add a new node, DictUnpack, which is used to represent the unpacking
    of a dictionary into another dictionary, using PEP 448 specific syntax
    ({1:2, **{2:3})

    This is a different approach than what the builtin ast module does,
    since it just uses None to represent this kind of operation,
    which seems conceptually wrong, due to the fact the AST contains
    non-AST nodes. Closes issue #206.
  * Add a new type of node, called *inference objects*. Inference objects are similar with
    AST nodes, but they can be obtained only after inference, so they can't be found
    inside the AST tree. Their purpose is to handle at astroid level
    some operations which can't be handled when using brain transforms.
    For instance, the first object added is FrozenSet, which can be manipulated
    at astroid's level (inferred, itered etc). Code such as this 'frozenset((1,2))'
    will not return an Instance of frozenset, without having access to its
    content, but a new objects.FrozenSet, which can be used just as a nodes.Set.
  * Add a new *inference object* called Super, which also adds support for understanding
    super calls. astroid understands the zero-argument form of super, specific to
    Python 3, where the interpreter fills itself the arguments of the call. Also, we
    are understanding the 2-argument form of super, both for bounded lookups
    (super(X, instance)) as well as for unbounded lookups (super(X, Y)),
    having as well support for validating that the object-or-type is a subtype
    of the first argument. The unbounded form of super (one argument) is not
    understood, since it's useless in practice and should be removed from
    Python's specification. Closes issue #89.
  * astroid.utils.ASTWalker and astroid.utils.LocalsVisitor
    were moved to pylint.pyreverse.utils.
- update to version 1.3.8:
  * Backport of  40e3176, which fixes issue #84.
- update to version 1.3.7:
  * Improve the inference of six.moves, especially when using `from
    ... import ...` syntax. Also, we added a new fail import hook for
    six.moves, which fixes the import-error false positive from
    pylint. Closes issue #107.
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 16 12:20:32 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

-  Update to 1.3.6:
    * Class.slots raises NotImplementedError for old style classes.
      Closes issue #67.
    * Add a new option to AstroidManager, `optimize_ast`, which
      controls if peephole optimizer should be enabled or not.
      This prevents a regression, where the visit_binop method
      wasn't called anymore with astroid 1.3.5, due to the differences
      in the resulting AST. Closes issue #82.
    * Add the ability to optimize small ast subtrees,
      with the first use in the optimization of multiple
      BinOp nodes. This removes recursivity in the rebuilder
      when dealing with a lot of small strings joined by the
      addition operator. Closes issue #59.
    * Obtain the methods for the nose brain tip through an
      unittest.TestCase instance. Closes Pylint issue #457.
    * Fix a crash which occurred when a class was the ancestor
      of itself. Closes issue #78.
    * Improve the scope_lookup method for Classes regarding qualified
      objects, with an attribute name exactly as one provided in the
      class itself.
      For example, a class containing an attribute 'first',
      which was also an import and which had, as a base, a qualified name
      or a Gettattr node, in the form 'module.first', then Pylint would
      have inferred the `first` name as the function from the Class,
      not the import. Closes Pylint issue #466.
    * Implement the assigned_stmts operation for Starred nodes,
      which was omitted when support for Python 3 was added in astroid.
      Closes issue #36.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 18 13:04:51 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.3.4:
    * Get the first element from the method list when obtaining
      the functions from nose.tools.trivial. Closes Pylint issue #448.
    * Restore file_stream to a property, but deprecate it in favour of
      the newly added method Module.stream. By using a method instead of a
      property, it will be easier to properly close the file right
      after it is used, which will ensure that no file descriptors are
      leaked. Until now, due to the fact that a module was cached,
      it was not possible to close the file_stream anywhere.
      file_stream will start emitting PendingDeprecationWarnings in
      astroid 1.4, DeprecationWarnings in astroid 1.5 and it will
      be finally removed in astroid 1.6.
    * Add inference tips for 'tuple', 'list', 'dict' and 'set' builtins.
    * Add brain definition for most string and unicode methods
    * Changed the API for Class.slots. It returns None when the class
      doesn't define any slots. Previously, for both the cases where
      the class didn't have slots defined and when it had an empty list
      of slots, Class.slots returned an empty list.
    * Add a new method to Class nodes, 'mro', for obtaining the
      the method resolution order of the class.
    * Add brain tips for six.moves. Closes issue #63.
    * Improve the detection for functions decorated with decorators
      which returns static or class methods.
    * .slots() can contain unicode strings on Python 2.
    * Add inference tips for nose.tools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  8 12:11:48 UTC 2014 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.3.2:
    * Fixed a crash with invalid subscript index.
    * Implement proper base class semantics for Python 3, where
      every class derives from object.
    * Allow more fine-grained control over C extension loading
      in the manager.
    * Fixed a crash issue with the pytest brain module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 21 08:53:09 UTC 2014 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.3.0:
    * Fix a maximum recursion error occured during the inference,
      where statements with the same name weren't filtered properly.
      Closes pylint issue #295.
    * Check that EmptyNode has an underlying object in
      EmptyNode.has_underlying_object.
    * Simplify the understanding of enum members.
    * Fix an infinite loop with decorator call chain inference,
      where the decorator returns itself. Closes issue #50.
    * Various speed improvements. Patch by Alex Munroe.
    * Add pytest brain plugin. Patch by Robbie Coomber.
    * Support for Python versions < 2.7 has been dropped, and the
      source has been made compatible with Python 2 and 3. Running
      2to3 on installation for Python 3 is not needed anymore.
    * astroid now depends on six.
    * modutils._module_file opens __init__.py in binary mode.
      Closes issues #51 and #13.
    * Only C extensions from trusted sources (the standard library)
      are loaded into the examining Python process to build an AST
      from the live module.
    * Path names on case-insensitive filesystems are now properly
      handled. This fixes the stdlib detection code on Windows.
    * Metaclass-generating functions like six.with_metaclass
      are now supported via some explicit detection code.
    * astroid.register_module_extender has been added to generalize
      the support for module extenders as used by many brain plugins.
    * brain plugins can now register hooks to handle failed imports, 
      as done by the gobject-introspection plugin.
    * The modules have been moved to a separate package directory,
      `setup.py develop` now works correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  4 16:24:17 UTC 2014 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 1.2.1:
    * Fix a crash occurred when inferring decorator call chain.
      Closes issue #42.
    * Set the parent of vararg and kwarg nodes when inferring them.
      Closes issue #43.
    * namedtuple inference knows about '_fields' attribute.
    * enum members knows about the methods from the enum class.
    * Name inference will lookup in the parent function
      of the current scope, in case searching in the current scope
      fails.
    * Inference of the functional form of the enums takes into
      consideration the various inputs that enums accepts.
    * The inference engine handles binary operations (add, mul etc.)
      between instances.
    * Fix an infinite loop in the inference, by returning a copy
      of instance attributes, when calling 'instance_attr'.
      Closes issue #34 (patch by Emile Anclin).
    * Don't crash when trying to infer unbound object.__new__ call.
      Closes issue #11.
- Use upstream zip for packaging as .tar.gz is no longer provided

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 12 09:24:19 UTC 2014 - mcihar@suse.com

- Update to 1.2.0
    * Function nodes can detect decorator call chain and see if they are
      decorated with builtin descriptors (`classmethod` and `staticmethod`).
    * infer_call_result called on a subtype of the builtin type will now
      return a new `Class` rather than an `Instance`.
    * `Class.metaclass()` now handles module-level __metaclass__ declaration
      on python 2, and no longer looks at the __metaclass__ class attribute on
      python 3.
    * Function nodes can detect if they are decorated with subclasses
      of builtin descriptors when determining their type
      (`classmethod` and `staticmethod`).
    * Add `slots` method to `Class` nodes, for retrieving
      the list of valid slots it defines.
    * Expose function annotation to astroid: `Arguments` node
      exposes 'varargannotation', 'kwargannotation' and 'annotations'
      attributes, while `Function` node has the 'returns' attribute.
    * Backported most of the logilab.common.modutils module there, as
      most things there are for pylint/astroid only and we want to be
      able to fix them without requiring a new logilab.common release
    * Fix names grabed using wildcard import in "absolute import mode" 
      (ie with absolute_import activated from the __future__ or with 
      python 3). Fix pylint issue #58.
    * Add support in pylint-brain for understanding enum classes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 10 13:12:12 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.1.1
    * `Class.metaclass()` looks in ancestors when the current class
      does not define explicitly a metaclass.
    * Do not cache modules if a module with the same qname is already
      known, and only return cached modules if both name and filepath
      match. Fixes pylint Bitbucket issue #136.
