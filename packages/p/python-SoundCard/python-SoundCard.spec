%description
SoundCard is a library for playing and recording audio without
resorting to a CPython extension. Instead, it is implemented using
CFFI and the native audio libraries of Linux, Windows and macOS.

SoundCard is cross-platform, and supports Linux/pulseaudio,
Mac/coreaudio, and Windows/WASAPI. While the interface is identical
across platforms, naming schemes and block sizes can vary between
devices and platforms.
