Tue Oct 17 19:43:21 UTC 2017 - sean.marlow@suse.com

- Update to 0.11.0:
  * Simplify Travis CI configuration for OS X.
  * Add asyncio connection adapter for Python 3.4 and newer.
  * Connection failures that occur after the socket is opened and
    before the AMQP connection is ready to go are now reported by
    calling the connection error callback. Previously these were
    not consistently reported.
  * In BaseConnection.close, call _handle_ioloop_stop only if the
    connection is already closed to allow the asynchronous close
    operation to complete gracefully.
  * Pass error information from failed socket connection to user
    callbacks on_open_error_callback and on_close_callback with
    result_code=-1.
  * ValueError is raised when a completion callback is passed to an
    asynchronous (nowait) Channel operation. It's an application
    error to pass a non-None completion callback with an
    asynchronous request, because this callback can never be
    serviced in the asynchronous scenario.
  * Channel.basic_reject fixed to allow delivery_tag to be of type
    long as well as int. (by quantum5)
  * Implemented support for blocked connection timeouts in
    pika.connection.Connection. This feature is available to all
    pika adapters. See pika.connection.ConnectionParameters
    docstring to learn more about blocked_connection_timeout
    configuration.
  * Deprecated the heartbeat_interval arg in
    pika.ConnectionParameters in favor of the heartbeat arg for
    consistency with the other connection parameters classes
    pika.connection.Parameters and pika.URLParameters.
  * When the port arg is not set explicitly in ConnectionParameters
    constructor, but the ssl arg is set explicitly, then set the
    port value to to the default AMQP SSL port if SSL is enabled,
    otherwise to the default AMQP plaintext port.
  * URLParameters will raise ValueError if a non-empty URL scheme
    other than {amqp | amqps | http | https} is specified.
  * InvalidMinimumFrameSize and InvalidMaximumFrameSize exceptions
    are deprecated. pika.connection.Parameters.frame_max property
    setter now raises the standard ValueError exception when the
    value is out of bounds.
  * Removed deprecated parameter type in Channel.exchange_declare
    and BlockingChannel.exchnage_declare in favor of the
    exchange_type arg that doesn't overshadow the builtin type
    keyword.
  * Channel.close() on OPENING channel transitions it to CLOSING
    instead of raising ChannelClosed.
  * Channel.close() on CLOSING channel raises
    ChannelAlreadyClosing; used to raise ChannelClosed.
  * Connection.channel() raises ConnectionClosed if connection is
    not in OPEN state.
  * When performing graceful close on a channel and Channel.Close
    from broker arrives while waiting for CloseOk, don't release
    the channel number until CloseOk arrives to avoid race
    condition that may lead to a new channel receiving the CloseOk
    that was destined for the closing channel.
  * The backpressure_detection option of ConnectionParameters and
    URLParameters property is DEPRECATED in favor of
    Connection.Blocked and Connection.Unblocked. See
    Connection.add_on_connection_blocked_callback.

    outside of their internal use, make sure to check out the new constants.
