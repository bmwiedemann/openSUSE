<package name="perl-Date-Calc" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Perl Date-Calc Module</title>
  <description>This package consists of a C library and a Perl module (which uses the
C library, internally) for all kinds of date calculations based on the
Gregorian calendar (the one used in all western countries today),
thereby complying with all relevant norms and standards: ISO/R
2015-1971, DIN 1355 and, to some extent, ISO 8601 (where applicable).

(See also http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/Date-Calc/DIN1355/
for a scan of part of the &quot;DIN 1355&quot; document (in German)).

The module of course handles year numbers of 2000 and above correctly
(&quot;Year 2000&quot; or &quot;Y2K&quot; compliance) -- actually all year numbers from 1
to the largest positive integer representable on your system (which is
at least 32767) can be dealt with.

Note that this package EXTRAPOLATES the Gregorian calendar BACK until
the year 1 A.D. -- even though the Gregorian calendar was only adopted
in 1582 by most (not all) European countries, in obedience to the
corresponding decree of catholic pope Gregor I in that year.

Some (mainly protestant) countries continued to use the Julian calendar
(used until then) until as late as the beginning of the 20th century.

Finally, note that this package is not intended to do everything you
could ever imagine automagically for you; it is rather intended to
serve as a toolbox (in the best of UNIX spirit and traditions) which
should, however, always get you where you want to go.</description>
