%description
'Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ' provides a simple wrapper around the librabbitmq
library that allows connecting, declaring exchanges and queues, binding and
unbinding queues, publishing, consuming and receiving events.

Error handling in this module is primarily achieve by 'Perl_croak' (die).
You should be making good use of 'eval' around these methods to ensure that
you appropriately catch the errors.
