- Update to 0.13.2
  * Fix a regression in reading from local file URIs (file://..)
    using geopandas.read_file (#2948).
  * Fix a regression in reading from URLs using geopandas.read_file
    (#2908). This restores the behaviour to download all data
    up-front before passing it to the underlying engine (fiona or
    pyogrio), except if the server supports partial requests (to
    support reading a subset of a large file).
- Relese 0.13
  ## New methods:
  * Added sample_points method to sample random points from Polygon
    or LineString geometries (#2860).
  * New hilbert_distance() method that calculates the distance
    along a Hilbert curve for each geometry in a
    GeoSeries/GeoDataFrame (#2297).
  * Support for sorting geometries (for example, using
    sort_values()) based on the distance along the Hilbert curve
    (#2070).
  * Added get_coordinates() method from shapely to
    GeoSeries/GeoDataframe (#2624).
  * Added minimum_bounding_circle() method from shapely to
    GeoSeries/GeoDataframe (#2621).
  * Added minimum_bounding_radius() as GeoSeries method (#2827).
  ## Other new features and improvements:
  * The Parquet and Feather IO functions now support the latest
    1.0.0-beta.1 version of the GeoParquet specification
    (<geoparquet.org>) (#2663).
  * Added support to fill missing values in GeoSeries.fillna via
    another GeoSeries (#2535).
  * Support specifying min_zoom and max_zoom inside the map_kwds
    argument for .explore() (#2599).
  * Added support for append (mode="a" or append=True) in to_file()
    using engine="pyogrio" (#2788).
  * Added a to_wgs84 keyword to to_json allowing automatic
    re-projecting to follow the 2016 GeoJSON specification (#416).
  * to_json output now includes a "crs" field if the CRS is not the
    default WGS84 (#1774).
  * Improve error messages when accessing the geometry attribute of
    GeoDataFrame without an active geometry column related to the
    default name "geometry" being provided in the constructor
    (#2577)
  ## Deprecations and compatibility notes:
  * Added warning that unary_union will return 'GEOMETRYCOLLECTION
    EMPTY' instead of None for all-None GeoSeries. (#2618)
  * The query_bulk() method of the spatial index .sindex property
    is deprecated in favor of query() (#2823).
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Ensure that GeoDataFrame created from DataFrame is a copy, not
    a view (#2667)
  * Fix mismatch between geometries and colors in plot() if an
    empty or missing geometry is present (#2224)
  * Escape special characters to avoid TemplateSyntaxError in
    explore() (#2657)
  * Fix to_parquet/to_feather to not write an invalid bbox (with
    NaNs) in the metadata in case of an empty GeoDataFrame (#2653)
  * Fix to_parquet/to_feather to use correct WKB flavor for 3D
    geometries (#2654)
  * Fix read_file to avoid reading all file bytes prior to calling
    Fiona or Pyogrio if provided a URL as input (#2796)
  * Fix copy() downcasting GeoDataFrames without an active geometry
    column to a DataFrame (#2775)
  * Fix geometry column name propagation when GeoDataFrame columns
    are a multiindex (#2088)
  * Fix iterfeatures() method of GeoDataFrame to correctly handle
    non-scalar values when na='drop' is specified (#2811)
  * Fix issue with passing custom legend labels to plot (#2886)
  ## Notes on (optional) dependencies:
  * GeoPandas 0.13 drops support pandas 1.0.5 (the minimum
    supported pandas version is now 1.1). Further, the minimum
    required versions for the listed dependencies have now changed
    to shapely 1.7.1, fiona 1.8.19, pyproj 3.0.1 and matplotlib
    3.3.4 (#2655)
- Release 0.12.2
  * Correctly handle geometries with Z dimension in to_crs() when
    using PyGEOS or Shapely >= 2.0 (previously the z coordinates
    were lost) (#1345).
  * Assign Crimea to Ukraine in the naturalearth_lowres built-in
    dataset (#2670)
- Release 0.12
  * The highlight of this release is the support for Shapely 2.0.
    This makes it possible to test Shapely 2.0 (currently 2.0b1)
    alongside GeoPandas.
  * Note that if you also have PyGEOS installed, you need to set an
    environment variable (USE_PYGEOS=0) before importing geopandas
    to actually test Shapely 2.0 features instead of PyGEOS. See
    https://geopandas.org/en/latest/getting_started/install.html#using-the-optional-pygeos-dependency
    for more details.
  ## New features and improvements:
  * Added normalize() method from shapely to GeoSeries/GeoDataframe
    (#2537).
  * Added make_valid() method from shapely to
    GeoSeries/GeoDataframe (#2539).
  * Added where filter to read_file (#2552).
  * Updated the distributed natural earth datasets
    (naturalearth_lowres and naturalearth_cities) to version 5.1
    (#2555).
  ## Deprecations and compatibility notes:
  * Accessing the crs of a GeoDataFrame without active geometry
    column was deprecated and this now raises an AttributeError
    (#2578).
  * Resolved colormap-related warning in .explore() for recent
    Matplotlib versions (#2596).
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fix cryptic error message in geopandas.clip() when clipping
    with an empty geometry (#2589).
  * Accessing gdf.geometry where the active geometry column is
    missing, and a column named "geometry" is present will now
    raise an AttributeError, rather than returning gdf["geometry"]
    (#2575).
  * Combining GeoSeries/GeoDataFrames with pandas.concat will no
    longer silently override CRS information if not all inputs have
    the same CRS (#2056).
