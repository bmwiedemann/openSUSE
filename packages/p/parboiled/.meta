  <title>Java/Scala library providing parsing of input text based on PEGs</title>
  <description>parboiled is a mixed Java/Scala library providing for lightweight and
easy-to-use, yet powerful and elegant parsing of arbitrary input text
based on Parsing expression grammars (PEGs). PEGs are an alternative to
context free grammars (CFGs) for formally specifying syntax, they
make a good replacement for regular expressions and generally have quite
a few advantages over the &quot;traditional&quot; way of building parser via CFGs.
