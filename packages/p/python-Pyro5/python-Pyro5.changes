- Update to Pyro 4.72
  * (source files: normalized line endings to LF)
  * the -k command line option to supply a HMAC encryption key on the command line for the name server, nsc,
    echoserver, flameserver and httpgateway tools is now deprecated (and will print a warning if used).
    It is a security issue because the key used is plainly visible.
    If you require proper security, use Pyro's 2-way SSL feature. Alternatively, set the HMAC key in the (new) environment
    variable PYRO_HMAC_KEY if you still have to use it before launching the aforementioned tools.
- Update to Pyro 4.71
  * updated ``msgpack`` dependency (was ``msgpack-python`` but that name is now deprecated)
  * fixed restart and force reload commands of the contrib/init.d/pyro4-nsd script, and changed its port binding
    from 9999 back to 9090 which is Pyro's default.
  * serpent 1.24 library now required to fix some api deprecation warnings when using Python 3.7 or newer.
  * updated sphinx documentation theme
- Update to Pyro 4.70
  * **incompatible API change** for python 3.7 compatibility: renaming of ``async`` function and keyword arguments in the API:
    Renamed ``Pyro4.core.async`` to ``Pyro4.core.asyncproxy`` (and its occurrence in ``Pyro4``)
    and the ``async`` keyword argument in some methods to ``asynchronous``.
    This had to be done because ``async`` (and ``await``) are now parsed as keywords in Python 3.7 and using them otherwise will result
    in a SyntaxError when loading the module.
    It is suggested you stop using the ``asyncproxy`` function and instead create asynchronous proxies using the ``_pyroAsync``
    method on the regular proxy.
  * For existing code running on Python *older than 3.7*, a backwards compatibility feature is present to still provide the
    ``async`` function and keyword arguments as they were supported on previous Pyro versions.
    But also for that older environments, it's advised to migrate away from them and start using the new names.
  * Proxy and Daemon have a new 'connected_socket' parameter. You can set it to a user-supplied connected socket that must
    be used by them instead of creating a new socket for you. Connected sockets can be created using the socket.socketpair()
    function for instance, and allow for easy and efficient communication over an internal socket between
    parent-child processes or threads, using Pyro.  Also see the new 'socketpair' example.
  * dropped support for Python 3.3 (which has reached end-of-life status). Supported Python versions are now 2.7, and 3.4 or newer.
    (the life cycle status of the Python versions can be seen here https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches)
