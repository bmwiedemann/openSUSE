  - Fix CLDR formatting of 'S' pattern with more than 9 digits of
    precision. While we only store nanoseconds in the DateTime object we should
    still be able to handle an arbitrary number of digits properly. Fixed by

  - Added a small optimization for boolification overloading. Rather than
    relying on a fallback to stringification, we now return true directly, which
    is a little faster in cases like "if ($might_be_dt) { ... }".
  
  - The datetime() method now accepts a single argument to use as the separate
    between the date and time portion. This defaults to "T".

  - Switched from RT to the GitHub issue tracker.
  
  
  1.39   2016-09-17
  
  - Bump minimum required Perl to 5.8.4 from 5.8.1. Looking at CPAN Testers,
    this distro hasn't actually passed with earlier Perl versions since
    1.35. I'm not explicitly testing with anything earlier than 5.8.8
  
  
  1.38   2016-09-16
  
  - This release includes changes from past trial releases to switch from
    Params::Validate and Params::ValidationCompiler. Relevant release notes from
    those trial releases are repeated here for clarity.
  
  - Replaced Params::Validate with Params::ValidationCompiler and Specio. In my
    benchmarks this makes constructing a new DateTime object about 14%
    faster. However, it slows down module load time by about 100 milliseconds
    (1/10 of a second) on my desktop system with a primed cache (so really
    measuring compile time, not disk load time).
  
  - When you pass a locale to $dt->set you will now get a warning suggesting you
    should use $dt->set_locale instead. The previous trial releases didn't allow
    locale to be passed at all, which broke a lot of modules. I've sent PRs, but
    for now the parameter should be allowed (but discouraged). Reported by
    Slaven Rezić. RT #115420.
  
  - Removed the long-deprecated DateTime->DefaultLanguage method. Use
    DefaultLocale instead.
  
  - Removed the long-deprecated "language" constructor parameter. Use "locale"
    instead.
  
  
  1.37   2016-08-14 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Require the latest Params::ValidationCompiler (0.11).

  1.35   2016-08-05
  
  - Use namespace::autoclean in all packages which import anything. Without
    cleaning the namespace, DateTime ends up with "methods" like try and catch
    (from Try::Tiny), which can lead to very confusing bugs. Reported by Mischa
    Schwieger. RT #115983.

  1.33   2016-06-29
  
  - Fixed the $dt->set docs to say that you cannot pass a locale (even though
    you can but you'll get a warning) and added more docs for $dt->set_locale.
  
  - Require DateTime::Locale 1.05.
  
  - Require DateTime::TimeZone 2.00.
  
  
  1.32   2016-06-28
  
  - This release *does not* include any of the changes in the 1.29-1.30 TRIAL
    releases.
  
  - When you pass a locale to $dt->set you will now get a warning suggesting you
    should use $dt->set_locale instead. If you have DateTime::Format::Mail
    installed you should upgrade to 0.0403 or later, since that module will
    trigger this warning.
  
  - Added support for $dt->truncate( to => 'quarter' ). Implemented by Michael
    Conrad. GitHub #17.
  
  
  1.31   2016-06-18 (TRIAL RELEASE)

  1.28   2016-05-21
  
  - Fixed handling of some floating point epochs. Because DateTime treated the
    epoch like a string instead of a number, certain epochs with a non-integer
    value ended up treated like integers (Perl is weird). Patch by Christian
    Hansen. GitHub #15. This also addresses the problem that GitHub #6 brought
    up.
  
  
  1.27   2016-05-13
  
  - Added an environment variable PERL_DATETIME_DEFAULT_TZ to globally set the
    default time zone. Using this is very dangerous! Be careful!. Patch by

  - DateTime->from_object would die if given a DateTime::Infinite object. Now it
    returns another DateTime::Infinite object. Reported by Greg Oschwald. RT
    #112712.
  
  
  1.24   2016-02-29
  
  - The last release partially broke $dt->time. If you passed a value to use as
    unit separator, this was ignored. Reported by Sergiy Zuban. RT #112585.
  
  
  1.23   2016-02-28
  
  - Make all DateTime::Infinite objects return the system's representation of
    positive or negative infinity for any method which returns a number of
    string representation (year(), month(), ymd(), iso8601(), etc.). Previously
    some of these methods could return "Nan", "-Inf--Inf--Inf", and other
    confusing outputs. Reported by Greg Oschwald. RT #110341.
  
  
  1.22   2016-02-21 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Fixed several issues with the handling of non-integer values passed to
    from_epoch().
  
    This method was simply broken for negative values, which would end up being
    incremented by a full second, so for example -0.5 became 0.5.
  
    The method did not accept all valid float values. Specifically, it did not
    accept values in scientific notation.
  
    Finally, this method now rounds all non-integer values to the nearest
    millisecond. This matches the precision we can expect from Perl itself (53
    bits) in most cases.

    new version (currently still in trial releases).
  
  
  1.20   2015-07-01
  
  - The 1.18 release added the June 30, 2015 leap second to the XS code, but I
    forgot to update the corresponding pure Perl implementation in
    DateTime::LeapSecond.

  - If you compared a DateTime object to an undef value, you might have received
    a warning pointing to code inside DateTime.pm, instead of in your own
    code. Fixed by Jason McIntosh. GH #7.
  
  - The 30future-tz.t could fail if run at certain very specific times. This
    should now be much less likely, unless a time zone being tested implements a
    DST change at noon (which would even more insane than DST already is by a
    huge factor). Reported by Karen Etheridge and diagnosed by Slaven Rezic. RT
    #102925.

 - No code changes from the 1.16 release.
 
 
 1.16   2015-01-04 (TRIAL RELEASE)
 
 - Test fix for systems where IVs are 4 bytes long.
 
 
 1.15   2015-01-03 (TRIAL RELEASE)
 
 - Trying this again ... Experimental fix for adding very large numbers of
   days. Previously, trying to add more than around 2^28 days could cause
   errors if the result ended up in a leap year. This is being released as a
   trial release because I'm not sure how this change will behave on a 32-bit
   Perl. Reported by KMX. RT #97046.
 
 
 1.14   2015-01-03
 
 - Accidentally released 1.13 as a non-TRIAL release. Releasing 1.13 minus the
   integer change so there's a known-safe stable release on CPAN for people to
   install.

 - The last release had the wrong repo info in the metadata.
 
 - The latest historical changes in DateTime::TimeZone 1.74 caused some tests
   to fail. Reported by Slaven Rezic. RT #98483.
 
 - This release of DateTime.pm now requires the DateTime::TimeZone 1.74.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 25 09:32:09 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.10
 
 - Some tests added in 1.09 would fail on a Perl without a 64-bit
   gmtime(). Reported by Jerome Eteve. RT #95345.
 
 
 1.09   2014-05-03
 
 - A call to ->truncate( to => 'week' ) could fail but leave the object
   changed. RT #93347.
 
 - The value of ->jd() is now calculated based on ->mjd() instead of the other
   way around. This reduces floating point errors a bit when calculating MJD,
   and should have a neglible impact on the accuracy of JD. Reported by Anye
   Li. RT #92972. See the ticket for a more detailed description of what this
   fixes.
 
 - Attempting to construct a DateTime object with a year >= 5000 and a time
   zone other than floating or DST now issues a warning. This warning may go
   away once DateTime::TimeZone is made much faster. Inspired by a bug report
   from Lloyd Fournier. RT #92655.
 
 
 1.08   2014-03-11
 
 - DateTime now calls DateTime->_core_time() instead of calling Perl's time()
   built-in directly. This makes it much easier to override the value of time()
   that DateTime sees. This may make it easier to write tests for code that
   uses DateTime .

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  7 09:10:06 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.07
 - Added a hack to get this module working on Android. RT #92671.
 - DateTime's attempt to generate infinity by calculating 9**9**9 actually got
   a number on some platforms, like powerpcspe. Reported by Gregor Hermann. RT
   #91696.
 - Added a new CLDR ZZZZZ specifier, which is like ZZZ but inserts a
   colon. Patch by Ricardo Signes.
 - Added a new option for the truncate() method to truncate to the
   "local_week". This truncates to the locale's notion of the first day of the
   week, rather than always truncating to Monday. Patch by Christian Hansen.

Mon Dec  9 11:18:09 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.04
 - Calling set_locale() or set_formatter() on an object with an ambiguous local
   time could change the underlying UTC time for that object. Reported by Marta
   Cuaresma Saturio. RT #90583.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  4 08:12:54 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.03
 - The set_time_zone() method was not returning the object when caalled with a
   name that matched the current zone. Reported by Noel Maddy. RT #84699.
 
 - When a constructor method like new() or today() was called on an object,
   you'd get an error message like 'Can't locate object method
   "_normalize_nanoseconds" via package "2013-04-15T00:00:00"'. This has been
   fixed to provide a sane error message. Patch by Doug Bell.
 
 - When set_time_zone() is called with a name that matches the current time
   zone, DateTime now short circuits and avoids a lot of work. Patch by Mark
   Stosberg.
 
 - Fixed test failures on older Perls.
 
 - Bumped the version to 1.00. This is mostly because my prior use of both X.YY
   and X.YYYY versions causes trouble for some packaging systems. Plus after 10
   years it's probably ready to be called 1.00. Requested by Adam. RT #82800. 
 
 - The %j specifier for strftime was not zero-padding 1 and 2 digit
   numbers. Fixed by Christian Hansen. RT #84310.
 
 - The truncate method was sloppy about validating its "to" parameter, so you
   could pass things like "years" or "month whatever anything goes". The method
   would accept the parameter but then not actually truncate the object. RT
   #84229.
 
 - Previously, if a call to $dt->set_time_zone() failed it would still change
   the time zone of the object, leaving it in a broken state. Reported by Bill
   Moseley. RT #83940.
 
 - DateTime::Infinite objects should no longer die when methods that require a
   locale are called. Instead, these methods return undef for names and
   Inf/-Inf for numbers. This affects methods such as day_name() as well as
   CLDR and strftime formats. When a locale-specific format is used (like the
   "full" datetime format) it uses the en_US format. Reported by Paul
   Boldra. RT #67550.
 
 - Reverted the change to round nanoseconds up or down in various
   situtations. Now we always round down. This avoids the case where rounding
   up would require us to then increment the second value (which could then
   require us to increment the minute, which could then require us to increment

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 20:25:12 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.68:
  * the tests for %N in the last release relied on the vagaries of floating
    point math on a 64-bit system; now the from_epoch() method just uses string
    operations to separate the epoch into an integer value and a mantissa; this
    avoids floating point insanity (RT#67736)

- changes from 0.67:
  * the %N strftime specifier simply truncated nanoseconds, rather than
    rounding them (RT#66744)
  * the %U strftime specifier was off by one in years where January 1st was a
    Sunday (RT#67631)
  * the %W strftime specifier was off by one in years where January 1st was a
    Sunday or Monday (RT#67631)
  * some small optimizations; the biggest impact is for calculating
    week_of_month, week_number, and week_year
  * now requires Perl 5.8.1+ (it implicitly did this anyway now that
    Params::Validate is 5.8.1+)

- update to 0.65
 * All the constructors besides new() ended up calling new(), which meant that
   these constructors went through the parameter validation code
   twice. Avoiding this should make everything that constructs a new object
   (besides new() itself) a little faster.
 * The t/39no-so.t test failed for some people. I can't reproduce it, but this
   release will hopefully fix the problem. Patch by Tokuhiro Matsuno. RT
   #62061.
 * Added a section on the DateTime Project ecosystem to the docs. Addresses RT
   #60930.
 * Fixed wiki links in the docs now that the wiki has moved to a new wiki
   platform.
 * Restored some of the dzil-ification. The repo now has a very minimal
   Build.PL file which is just enough to build the XS code and run the
   tests. This fixes the total lack of prereqs in the META.* files. Reported by
   Bjørn-Olav. RT #62427.

  - By default, Dist::Zilla generates a Build.PL that requires Module::Build
    0.3601+, but this distro really doesn't need any particular version.
- hence removed MB patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  2 12:15:13 UTC 2010 - chris@computersalat.de

- update to 0.59
  - More packaging fixes. This release makes sure that POD only shows up in the
    right files. In 0.56 through 0.58, some POD in the wrong place confused the
    search.cpan.org POD display code, and the main module's documentation wasn't
    viewable.
- 0.58   2010-06-28
  - Versions 0.56 and 0.57 did not build XS properly when installing.
- 0.57   2010-06-26
  - Make DateTime::LeapSecond have the same $VERSION as every other .pm file.
- 0.56   2010-06-26
  - The set_formatter() method did not return the DateTime object, and did not
    actually validate the value provided for the formatter. Based on a patch by
    Andrew Whatson. RT #58506.
  - Improved docs on floating time zone. Based on suggestions by Michael
    Svoboda. RT #56389.
  - Added mention of end-of-month algorithms to docs on DateTime math. Based on
    a patch by Michael R. Davis. RT #58533.
  - License is now Artistic 2.0.
- added MB patch
  o Author Requires Module::Build >= 0.3601
    but 1120 does not provide it, and builds just fine with Module::Build 0.280801

- update to 0.55
  - Get all tests passing on 5.6.2. Thanks to Zefram for help spotting the
    problems.
  - Moved code to my hg repo at http://hg.urth.org/hg/DateTime.pm.
- 0.54   2010-03-14
  - Bumped the DateTime::TimeZone prereq to 1.09 to force people to use a modern
    version. Previously the minimum version was 0.59, and there have been a lot
    of bug fixes since then.
  - String overloading now extends to string comparison, so a DateTime object
    can be compared to any string. In other words
      if ( $dt eq $string ) { ... }

      will simply stringify $dt and then do a normal string-is-equals
      check. Previously, this would blow up unless both operands were a DateTime
      object.

      Note that future versions of Test::More (0.95_01+) will no longer stringify
      arguments to is(), which means that older versions of DateTime may cause new
      test failures when you upgrade Test::More. It is highly recommended that you
      upgrade DateTime before upgrading to Test::More 0.95_01+.

      Patch by Michael Schwern. RT #55453.
  - Allow passing end_of_month setting to $duration->inverse(). Requested by
    John Siracusa. RT #53985.
- fixed deps
  - perl-macros < 1120
  - perl(Test::Exception)
  - perl(Test::More) >= 0.88
  - perl(DateTime::TimeZone) >= 1.09
- split package to DateTime_0_53 for suse_version < 1120

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 11 21:50:08 UTC 2010 - chris@computersalat.de

- update to 0.53
  - Added Test::Exception to build_requires.
- 0.52   2009-12-05
  - Numeric to ->new() are now all validated to make sure they are
    integers. Previously, things like "month => 11.2" would have been
    allowed. Based on a bug report from Max Kanat-Alexandar. RT #45767.
  - Added a warning to the docs suggesting that you cache the locale time zone
    if you need to make many DateTime objects in the local zone. Looking up the
    local zone can be fairly expensive. RT #46753.
- 0.51   2009-11-01
  - Switched to Module::Build. To force a non-XS build, start the build
    process with "perl Build.PL --pp".
  - POD-related tests are only run for the maintainer now.
  - Fixed handling of negative years in CLDR formatting for "y" and "u"
    patterns. Note that the LDML spec says nothing about how this should work,
    so I took my best guess.
- cleanup spec
  o removed useless comments
  o fixed Header
  o update License, Url, description
  o moved changelog to changes file
  o macro usage
  o Makefile.PL > Build.PL
  o changelog to changes file

- update to 0.50
  - 0.50   2009-05-11
    - Tests were failing on Win32 because they attempted to use a negative
      epoch. Fixed so that these tests are skipped. Fixes RT #45966.
  - 0.49   2009-05-04
    - A bug in the test code for handling overloaded objects in from_epoch
      resulted in a test failure on Perl 5.8.x. This release contains no
      changes besides a test code fix.
  - 0.48   2009-05-04
    - Some of the accessors (the "main" ones like year(), month(), day(),
      etc) now warn if they are passed a value. Patch from Shawn
      Moore. Fixes RT #6979.
    - DateTime::Duration expected DateTime to be loaded and used some
      constants from it, but did not explicitly "use DateTime". Reported
      by Jeff Kubina. RT #44740.
    - The CLDR formatting for "c" and "cc" was incorrectly using the local
      day of the week. This meant that it gave the wrong result for
      locales where Monday is not considered the first day of the
      week. Reported by Maros Kollar. RT #45007.
    - DateTime->from_epoch did not allow an object which overloaded
      numification as the epoch value. Patch by Michael Schwern. RT
      #45653.
    - Fixed how datetime subtraction is handled for some cases around DST
      changes. This had been improved back in 0.30, but there were still
      bugs. RT #45235.
  - 0.47   2009-03-01
    - The handling of CLDR format 'j' and 'jj' was backwards, using 24
      hour time for locales that wanted 12 hour, and vice versa. Reported
      by Maros Kollar.
    - The CLDR formatting was missing support for lower-case "q"
      patterns. Reported by Maros Kollar.
  - 0.46   2009-02-28
    - Added a duration_class method for the benefit of DateTime.pm
      subclasses. Patch by Shawn Moore.
  - 0.4501 2008-11-25
    - The epoch() method got broken in the recent shuffling between
      Time::Local and Time::y2038. Unfortunately, the tests to catch this
      also got lost in the shuffle. Reported by Avianna Chao.
  - 0.45   2008-11-11
    - Reverted the changes to use Time::y2038, on the recommendation of
      Michael Schwern (the author of said module), because it is not yet
      stable. This may come back in a future release.
  - 0.4401 2008-11-03
    - In order to handle epochs > 2**32 properly on a 32-bit machine, we
      also need to import gmtime from Time::y2038. This changes fixes a
      whole bunch of test failures seen with 0.44.
  - 0.44   2008-11-01
    - XS-capable DateTime.pm now uses Time::y2038 instead of
      Time::Local. This lets it handle epochs up to 142 million years
      before and after the Unix epoch.
    - Fixed a compiler warning with Perl 5.10.0.
    - Fixed docs for year_with_era, which had AD and BC
      backwards. Reported by Vynce Montgomery. RT #39923.
    - The format_cldr() method did not format the "yy" format properly
      when the year ended in "0X". Reported by Wilson Santos. RT #40555.
  - 0.4305 2008-10-03
    - The pure Perl version of this module did not know about the end of
      2008 leap second. Reported by James T Monty.
  - 0.4304 2008-07-13
    - Fix test failures when tests are run with DateTime::Locale
      0.41. Reported by David Cantrell via CPAN Testers.
  - 0.4303 2008-07-12
    - There is a new leap second coming at the end of 2008. 
- added perl-macros
  o autogen filelist with perl_gen_filelist
- spec mods
  o added header
  o fixed deps
