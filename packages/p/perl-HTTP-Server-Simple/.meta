  <title>Lightweight HTTP server</title>
  <description>This is a simple standalone HTTP server. By default, it doesn't thread or fork.
It does, however, act as a simple frontend which can be used to build a
standalone web-based application or turn a CGI into one.

It is possible to use Net::Server classes to create forking, pre-forking, and
other types of more complicated servers; see &quot;net_server&quot;.
