Subject: [PATCH 1/4] bpo-36260: Add pitfalls to zipfile module documentation

We saw vulnerability warning description (including zip bomb) in Doc/library/xml.rst file.
This gave us the idea of documentation improvement.

So, we moved a little bit forward :P
And the doc patch can be found (pr).

+Decompression pitfalls
+----------------------
 
+The extraction in zipfile module might fail due to some pitfalls
+listed below.
+
+From file itself
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Decompression may fail due to incorrect password / CRC checksum
+/ ZIP format or unsupported compression method / decryption.
+
+File System limitations
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Exceeding limitations on different file systems can cause
+decompression failed. Such as allowable characters in the
+directory entries, length of the file name, length of the
+pathname, size of a single file, and number of files, etc.
+
+Resources limitations
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The lack of memory or disk volume would lead to decompression
+failed. For example, decompression bombs (aka `ZIP bomb`_) apply
+to zipfile library that can cause disk volume exhaustion.
+
+Interruption
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Interruption during the decompression, such as pressing control-C
+or killing the decompression process may result in incomplete
+decompression of the archive.
+
+Default behaviors of extraction
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Not knowing the default extraction behaviors can cause unexpected
+decompression results. For example, when extracting the same
+archive twice, it overwrites files without asking.
