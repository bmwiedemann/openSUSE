- updated to 2.24
        - Test with Test::More V 1.001002 rather than V 1.302019, and all tests still pass.
                See RT#115236. Thanx to Kent Fredric for again (sorry!) prompting me over this.
                Lowering the version of Test::More in Makefile.PL is the only change in this version.

        - Add no_xxe to XML::Twig instantiation. See RT#118972. Many thanx to Lisa Hare for a
                very well-crafted set of patches provided via github.

        - Revert change so we use Test::More instead of Test2::Bundle::Extended.
                See RT#115236. Thanx to ribasushi for this report, and my apologies for not acting sooner.

        - Escape a '{' in a regexp in t/foo.t. See RT#114551. Thanx to Slaven Rezic.
        - Fix a typo in a comment, as provided by Gregor Herrmann in RT#111385.
        - See http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html for notes on the
                modernization of the repo.
                This includes updating Makefile.PL and removing Build.PL, MANIFEST and *META.*.
        - Bail out cleanly if 'dot' is not installed. See RT#105575. Thanx Karen Etheridge.
        - Update docs to point to a copy of the Perl licence.
        - Update docs in GraphViz.pm to point to the github repo.
        - Move t/pod.t into xt/author/.

        - Merge patch from ntyni via github. This concerned use of defined(@some_array). With thanx.

        - Accept pull request from Patrice Clement to add the x_deprecated flag to both META.json and
                META.yml. The docs already had various references to 'deprecated', including directing users
                to GraphViz2, so no change is needed there. Thanx Patrice.
        - Add .gitignore to MANIFEST.SKIP.

        - All patches to this version are from chrony, via a github pull request. With thanx.
        - Use File::Which on Windows to detect if Graphviz is present.
        - Clean up the code, including Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

- update to 2.15
  * fixes build on Factory
  * changes:
    - Fix double-quote escaping bug in GraphViz's _attributes() method. See RT#90528.
    - Patch t/foo.t to not assume text appears on specific lines of the output test files.
    - Re-package distro because users get errors during testing. See RT#80709.
    - For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
	Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.
    - Add VDX as an output format.
    - Accept a patch kindly supplied by Alexander Kriegisch, to change handling of the rankdir attribute.

Fri Nov 18 11:28:01 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.com

- update to 2.08
    - Wind back pre-reqs for various modules to match what was shipped with Perl V 5.8.1.
      Many thanx to Brian Cassidy for the error report: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72068.

    - Rewrite Build.PL and Makefile.PL to try loading File::Which rather than assuming it is installed.
      This avoids the chicken-and-egg problem whereby these 2 programs need File::Which::which to find 'dot'.
      Many thanx to Richard Clamp for the error report: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=71971.

    - Add File::Which to the pre-reqs in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

    - Add 'Deprecated. See GraphViz2' to the docs.
    - Add Build.PL.
    - Add ability to set ORIENTATION. Thanx to Christian Lackas for the patch. See RT#71787.
    - Add Changelog.ini.
    - Add META.json, MYMETA.json and MYMETA.yml.
    - Add MANIFEST.SKIP.
    - Ensure all modules contain a version number.
    - Update the docs regarding the list of modules shipped in this distro.
    - Remove examples/remote.pl because GraphViz::Remote is no longer shipped.
    - Clean up examples/clusters2.pl.
    - Clean up Makefile.PL.
