  <title>Variable ties made easier: much, much, much easier...</title>
  <description>This module adds the ability to quickly create new types of tie objects without creating a complete class. It does so in such a way as to try and make the programmers life easier when it comes to single-use ties.

The 'Tie::Simple' package is actually a front-end to other classes which really do all the work once tied, but this package does the work to automatically figure out what you're trying to do.
