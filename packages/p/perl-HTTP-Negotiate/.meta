  <title>choose a variant to serve</title>
  <description>This module provides a complete implementation of the HTTP content
negotiation algorithm specified in _draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-00.ps_ chapter
12. Content negotiation allows for the selection of a preferred content
representation based upon attributes of the negotiable variants and the
value of the various Accept* header fields in the request.</description>
