  <title>Merge, split, rotate, crop, and rearrange pages of PDF documents</title>
  <description>pdfarranger is a small python-gtk application, which helps the user
to merge or split pdf documents and rotate, crop and rearrange their
pages using a graphical interface. It is a frontend for pikepdf.

pdfarranger is a fork of Konstantinos Pouliosâ€™s pdfshuffler. It is
a humble attempt to make the project a bit more active.
