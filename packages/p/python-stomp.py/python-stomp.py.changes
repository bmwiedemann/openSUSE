- update to version 8.0.1:
 * Change code to use cryptography lib rather than PyOpenSSL (which is not recommended for use any more - discussed here: https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/issues/378)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 14 11:22:18 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  6 08:23:36 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- remove need for two source tarballs, use only the github one with pyproject macros
- update to version 8.0.0:
 * Add support for backwards compatible CONNECT in 1.1 and 1.2 protocols (https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/pull/348)
 * Flip DEFAULT_SSL_VERSION to use ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS rather than ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1
 * Check SSL certificate for expiry if PyOpenSSL is installed
 * Remove deprecated constructor params (use_ssl, and other ssl params)
 * Minor cleanup (remove debian packaging config, since it didn't work any more)
 * Add log_to_stdout method to force command line logging to stdout (useful for testing)
 * Various updates for docker testing
 * Add mac keepalive functionality
 * Minor update to daemon attribute (https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/pull/361)
 * Fix issue with heartbeat listener disconnecting the socket (https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/issues/219 - https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/pull/369)

Mon Apr 12 15:26:52 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 7.0.0:
(from v6.1.1):
 * Add host bind port patch (https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/issues/331)
 * Tidy up based on pycharm suggestions
 * Change quotes to be consistent (" rather than ')
(from v6.1.0):
 * Remove traceback logging (https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/pull/290)
 * Add support for \r\n EOL handling (as per [stomp protocol v1.2](http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html#Augmented_BNF))
 * Remove heartbeat loop sleep (issue https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/issues/297, https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/pull/298)
 * Update version number using the makefile and the poetry version command
 * Add `original_headers` access to the Frame so that you can get the original value of a header even if a listener modifies it (issue: https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/issues/300, PR https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/pull/309)
 * Fix for reconnect failures (https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/pull/295)
 * Fix for double disconnect notifications causing issues with reconnection
 * Add 'verbose' to stomp.logging (and defaulting the value to False). Log lines which dump the stacktrace now use that variable - except for a couple of cases (set stomp.logging.verbose = True to change back to the previous behaviour)
