%description
RtMidi is a set of C++ classes which provides an API for realtime
MIDI I/O across Linux (ALSA & JACK), macOS (CoreMIDI & JACK),
and Windows (MultiMedia System) operating systems.

python-rtmidi is a Python binding for RtMidi implemented using
Cython and provides a thin wrapper around the RtMidi C++ interface.
The API is basically the same as the C++ one but with the naming
scheme of classes, methods and parameters adapted to the Python
PEP-8 conventions and requirements of the Python package naming
structure.
