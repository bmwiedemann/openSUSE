%description
Distob will take your existing python objects, or a sequence of
objects, and scatter them onto many IPython parallel engines, which
may be running on a single computer or on a cluster.

In place of the original objects, proxy objects are kept on the client
computer that provide the same interface as the original objects. You
can continue to use these as if the objects were still local. All
methods are passed through to the remote objects, where computation is
done.

In particular, sending numpy arrays to the cluster is supported.

A numpy array can also be scattered across the cluster, along a
particular axis. Operations on the array can then be automatically
done in parallel.
