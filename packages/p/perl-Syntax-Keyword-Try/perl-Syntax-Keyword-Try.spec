%description
This module provides a syntax plugin that implements exception-handling
semantics in a form familiar to users of other languages, being built on a
block labeled with the 'try' keyword, followed by at least one of a 'catch'
or 'finally' block.

As well as providing a handy syntax for this useful behaviour, this module
also serves to contain a number of code examples for how to implement
parser plugins and manipulate optrees to provide new syntax and behaviours
for perl code.
