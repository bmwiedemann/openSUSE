%description
This package provides a few basic methods that behave similarly to the
same-named core perl functions relating to IO operations, but yield their
results asynchronously via Future instances.

This is provided primarily as a decoupling mechanism, to allow modules to
be written that perform IO in an asynchronous manner to depend directly on
this, while allowing asynchronous event systems to provide an
implementation of these operations.
