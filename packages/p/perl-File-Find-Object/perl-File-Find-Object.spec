%description
File::Find::Object does the same job as File::Find but works like an object
and with an iterator. As File::Find is not object oriented, one cannot
perform multiple searches in the same application. The second problem of
File::Find is its file processing: after starting its main loop, one cannot
easily wait for another event and so get the next result.

With File::Find::Object you can get the next file by calling the next()
function, but setting a callback is still possible.
