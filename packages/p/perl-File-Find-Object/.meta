  <title>An object oriented File::Find replacement</title>
  <description>File::Find::Object does the same job as File::Find but works like an object and with an iterator. As File::Find is not object oriented, one cannot perform multiple searches in the same application. The second problem of File::Find is its file processing: after starting its main loop, one cannot easily wait for another event and so get the next result.

With File::Find::Object you can get the next file by calling the next() function, but setting a callback is still possible.</description>
