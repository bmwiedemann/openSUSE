Sat Dec  3 20:18:38 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.2.0:
  * Several changes were made to accommodate our migration from hg on our own
    Mercurial server to git and GitHub.
  * Tons of important fixes going back to Sep 27, 2017. Including static analysis
    fixes, platform compatibility improvements, etc.
  * Added PHYSFS_setRoot, to mount a subset of an archive.
  * Support for HOG2 (Descent 3) archives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 29 16:39:40 UTC 2020 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Update to 3.0.2:
  * physfsrwops: Patched to compile for use with SDL 1.2
  * 7zip: don't forget to destroy the PHYSFS_Io when closing the archive
  * ignorecase: Don't crash if enumeration returned a NULL pointer.
  * Fix up physfs.h for compilers that are sensitive about preprocessor
    defines.
  * PHYSFS_setWriteDir() shouldn't create an empty file if the dir
    doesn't exist.
  * PHYSFS_flush() no longer calls PHYSFS_Io::flush()
- Spec cleanup.
- Drop physfs-empty_dir_fix.patch. Merged upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 11 15:12:57 UTC 2018 - buckyballreaction@gmail.com

- Add physfs-empty_dir_fix.patch (hg a29fef4a20fd, fixes creation 
  of empty files when a directory doesn't exist)
- Removed physfs-gcc7.patch (fixed in upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 10 17:24:33 UTC 2018 - buckyballreaction@gmail.com

- Notable changes in 3.0.1:
  * Trying to use the new mount functions (PHYSFS_mountIo, 
    PHYSFS_mountMemory, PHYSFS_mountHandle) with a NULL filename 
    would cause several problems. This now reports an error without
    mounting. Docs have been corrected to reflect this reality. 
  * Trying to mounting an archive inside a .zip file with 
    PHYSFS_mountHandle() would crash with a NULL pointer 
    dereference. Fixed. 
  * Trying to access a file in the search path named "." or 
    ".." no longer succeeds. Previously, this bug meant you could 
    enumerate (but not access) files in the parent of a mounted 
    native directory. Trying to open "." or ".." might have crashed 
    or hung PhysicsFS. This only applies to the literal string "." 
    or ".."; if there was a '/' char in the path, PhysicsFS would 
    correctly reject a path with an element named as such. 
  * Trying to mount a symlink to a directory would 
    (incorrectly) fail on Unix and Apple platforms instead of 
    mounting the directory the symlink points to. Fixed. 
  * Fixed several crashes/hangs that a maliciously-crafted .iso 
    file could trigger.
- Notable changes in 3.0.0:
  * PhysicsFS now is super-easy to build. You can usually just 
    drop all the C files into your project and compile it with 
    everything else without any magic configuration step. The CMake
    file is still there and useful for packaging, etc, but it's 
    100% optional. 
  * ZIP files can now use the newer zip64 format. 
  * ZIP files may be password-protected. As the PkWare specs 
    specify, each file in the .zip may have a different password, 
    so you call PHYSFS_openRead(a, "file_that_i_want.txt$PASSWORD")
    to make it work. Note that this is a wildly insecure way to 
    protect your app's data, both in how you'd have to manage 
    passwords and that "traditional" PkWare crypto is not really 
    hardened anyhow. But if you have a basic password-protected 
    archive, PhysicsFS can get into it now! 
  * 7zip support has been rewritten and improved. 
  * ISO9660 archives are now supported. 
  * VDF (Gothic/Gothic2) archives are now supported. 
  * SLB (Independence War) archives are now supported. 
  * Everything behind the scenes now uses an abstract i/o 
    interface (PHYSFS_Io) instead of talking directly to files, and 
    this interface is available to applications. This allows you to 
    mount anything as an archive that you can wrap in a PHYSFS_Io, 
    through the new PHYSFS_mountIo() function. The obvious and most 
    useful implementations are already implemented for you behind 
    the scenes on top of PHYSFS_Io: PHYSFS_mountMemory() to mount 
    an archive that's in a block of RAM, and PHYSFS_mountHandle() 
    to mount from a PHYSFS_File*...that is to say: you now have an 
    interface to do archives inside archives. 
  * The abstract interface that PhysicsFS uses to talk to 
    archives (PHYSFS_Archiver) is now public, so apps can implement 
    their own archivers and register them into the system. If you 
    have a custom archive format for your app, you can plug it into 
    PhysicsFS at runtime without modifying PhysicsFS itself. 
  * There's now a PHYSFS_getPrefDir() to figure out where it is 
    safe to write files on a given platform. This is usually a 
    per-user, per-application space, and should be used instead of 
    PHYSFS_getUserDir(). It might report something under 
    ~/Library/Application Support on a Mac, somewhere under AppData 
    for Windows, or ~/.local/share on Linux, etc. 
  * There's now a PHYSFS_unmount() to match 2.0.0's 
    PHYSFS_mount(). 
  * There's now a PHYSFS_utf8FromUtf16(), so stop using 
    PHYSFS_utf8FromUcs2().   :) 
  * There's now PHYSFS_utf8stricmp() for case-insensitive UTF-8 
    string comparison, in case you need to compare filenames. 
  * Enumerating files can now report errors, instead of quietly 
    dropping files when there were problems. Enumeration callbacks 
    can now return results too ("keep going", "stop enumerating, no 
    error I just got what I needed", "something went wrong, stop 
    and return an error to the app"). 
  * There is now a PHYSFS_stat() call that returns metadata on 
    a specific file as a whole instead of using 
    PHYSFS_isDirectory(), PHYSFS_getLastModTime(), etc 
    separately). 
  * There's now a PHYSFS_readBytes() function that operates 
    more like Unix read()...the older PHYSFS_read() operates more 
    like ANSI C's fread(), but had undefined behavior if it reads 
    half an object. There is also an equivalent 
    PHYSFS_writeBytes(). 
  * Errors are now reported by numeric codes your app can 
    process (there's a function to turn them into human readable 
    strings). Apps can set the per-thread error code now, too, 
    which is useful if you're writing an PHYSFS_Archiver or 
    PHYSFS_Io. 
  * The OS/2 port has Unicode support now. 
  * The Windows port now uses UTF-16 for Unicode instead of 
    UCS-2, and dropped the ANSI fallbacks (so among other hurdles, 
    you'll need to bring your own UNICOWS.DLL if you want Win95 
    support still). 
  * Lots of improvements, redesigns, bug fixes, corner cases, 
    and optimizations. 
  * There's now a buildbot that makes sure this builds across 
    two dozen different targets on every commit: 
    https://physfs-buildbot.icculus.org/waterfall 
  * New platforms: iOS, Android, Emscripten, WinRT (UWP, 
    Windows Phone, Windows Store), Win64, QNX, Solaris, Hurd, 
    Debian/kFreeBSD, ArcaOS, probably others. 
  * Dropped platforms: BeOS (Haiku is still supported), Windows 
    CE (Windows Phone is supported), Windows 95/98/ME (WinXP and 
    later are supported) MacOS Classic (macOS and iOS are 
    supported). Even these might work with minor patches if there's 
    an urgent demand. 
  * Probably many other things. This work encompasses many 
    years of effort and quite a bit of internal redesign.
