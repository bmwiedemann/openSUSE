- Add a workaround to fix building against perl-5.40.0 which added
  a warning for accidental usage of UNIVERSAL::import()
  * new patch: po4a.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 22 18:28:32 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.73:
  + Try to not fail when writing UTF po files with old Perl
    versions.
  + Improve various error messages to help users debugging encoding
    issues.
- Changes from version 0.72:
  + TransTractor:
    - Remove one source of supirious error reports when writing
      files.
  + Asciidoc:
    - Support a cleanspaces option to remove extra spaces in
      wrapped lines.
  + Man/Groff:
    - Handle ~ as non-breaking space.
    - Properly handle \c escape sequence in .TP parameters.
  + Markdown:
    - Treat tables as verbatim paragraphs.
  + All scripts:
    - Add an option -w/--width to rewrap text on an arbitrary
      column.
  + po4a main script only:
    - Fix the behavior of --translate-only.
  + Documentation:
    - Fix typos.
    - Kill outdated documentation on Pod parameters.
- Changes from version 0.71:
  + po4a main script:
    - Fix the parsing of nested simple and double quotes mixed with
      escaped spaces.
    - Properly parse config files iteratively redefining the same
      alias to enrich it.
    - Don't eat up quotes around parameters containing spaces, as
      they are needed later on when passing parameters to msgmerge
      and friends.
  + Gemtext:
    - New module.
  + Documentation:
    - Fix many typos introduced in previous release.
  + General:
    - Better error messages on encoding errors. It remains fragile,
      but at least we try to display an error message.
- Changes from version 0.70:
  + Major cleanup:
    - Greatly simplify the code by using PerlIO instead of messing
      up with encodings manually. This is a very intrusive change,
      and even if all tests of our comprehensive suite pass, expect
      issues with this on some corner cases, such as projects not
      using UTF-8 but a mixture of encodings.

Mon Jan 16 07:06:48 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to v0.69:
  * Parts of a fenced divs are now translated separately (GitHub's #381)
  * Use the implementation of YFM to parse YAML files too.
  * Numbers and arrays are not quoted anymore in Yaml files, as it should
    be.
  * This adds the yfm_paths option to Markdown and Asciidoc YFM,
  * fixing GitHub's #392 along the way.
  * Please note that '-o keys' is now case-sensitive in Yaml documents.
  * Do not translate nor quote booleans, so that they are not treated as
    string.
  * Correctly handle placeholders of empty elements (GitHub's #389)
  * Translate attributes within attribute-folded inline and placeholder (GH
    #391)
  * alt attribute of  can be properly handled with:  -o
    'attributes=<image>alt' -o 'inline=<image>' -o foldattributes
  * Thanks k-yaegashi for the pull request fixing both issues
  * Add a deprecation warning to po4a-translate and po4a-updatepo stating
    that po4a is the prefered interface.
  * Rewrite the po4a-gettextize documentation (Debian's #1016695) [Mt].
  * Rewrite the intro of po4a doc, and add a Quick start tutorial [Mt].

Fri Jul 15 12:21:58 UTC 2022 - Luiz Fernando Ranghetti <elchevive@opensuse.org>

 * Support line breaks (GitHub's #199) [J.N. Avila]

gettextization:
 * Deduplicate the msgids, to prevent the structure desynchronizations
   when the same string is used at several locations, with mismatching types.
   (GitHub's #334) [mquinson]
 * Add some tests for the gettextization feature. [mquinson]
 
po4a-translate:
 * Do not check whether the po file is uptodate, as it's impossible to do
   that correctly when several master files are merged in the same POT.
   (GitHub's #156) [mquinson]

Man:
 * Improve the error message when using '.de', '.if', '.ie' to hint about
   the option 'groff_code=verbatim|translate' (GitHub's #361) [mquinson]
 * Implement '.el' (else branch) as translate_joined [mquinson]
 * Implement '.de1' (define with no check) as '.de' [mquinson]

 * Implement '.it' (input trap) as untranslated (GitHub's #339) [mquinson]
 * Make a sensible warning when user-defined macros are not explained to po4a
   with the 'untranslated' option and friends. [mquinson]

Markdown:
 * New option 'yfm_lenient' to proceed even if the YAML Front Matter parser fails.
   Useful when your file starts with an horizontal ruler that is not a YFM.
   (GitHub's #365) [mquinson]
 * This introduces a NEW DEPENDENCY: Syntax::Keyword::Try
 * Do not quote the YFM lists to not break them (GitHub's #304) [mquinson].
   Thanks @dbaio for the analysis and @ynojima for an initial patch in doc-l10n-kit.

xHTML:

   (GitHub's #366, thanks Petter Reinholdtsen).

Other bug fixes:
 * Hide an ugly warning about uninitialized string (GitHub's #360) [mquinson]

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Asciidoc:

 * Support empty cells in tablecells mode (GitHub's #343) [J.N. Avila]
 * Disable tablecells when table is not in PSV format (GitHub's #343 too) [J.N. Avila]

Yaml:

 * New option "paths" to select the full paths to extract.
 * The old "key" option (that allows to select any path ending with the given
   key) still works as previously (thanks Oliver Rahner).

Tests:

 * Make the SGML tests use valid input files to fix brekages on paranoid OSes
   (GitHub's#327 -- thanks newbluemoon for report and fix).
 * Add a new tests that fixes the weird permission settings of the other tests,
   and prevent the users from running the tests as root (GitHub's #332 -- thanks
   Oliver Rahner for stepping on that trap).
 * Fix the testsuite so that it works even if the source is checkouted in an
   arbitrary directory (GitHub's #338).

po4a-gettextize:

 * Use UTF-8 by default for localized charset.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 11 15:55:45 UTC 2022 - Luiz Fernando Ranghetti <elchevive@opensuse.org>

   structure (Github's #307 and #308). Thanks Jean-Noël Avila for the fix!
 * Add an "nolinting" option to disable lint messages.

po4a runner:
 * In split mode, allow to group several files within the same POT file.
 * Rename the option 'master:file' to 'pot' for clarity. The old name still works
   (with a warning).

Tex:
 * Don't use the full absolute file path in #: references of PO files. (Debian's #998196,
   Github's #281)
