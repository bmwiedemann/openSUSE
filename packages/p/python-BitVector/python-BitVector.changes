- Update to 3.4.9:
   * Version 3.4.9, in addition to implementing __iadd__, also includes a
     significantly faster implementation for __add__.  For extending a given
     instance of BitVector, the implementation for __iadd__ adds bits to the
     existing instance as opposed to creating a new instance.  These changes
     to the module should make it easier to solve larger problems more
     quickly with BitVector.
