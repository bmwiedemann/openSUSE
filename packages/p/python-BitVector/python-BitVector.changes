- Update to 3.5.0:
  * Version 3.5.0 makes the module ready for Python 3.9.  The methods
    "array.fromstring" and "array.tostring" will not exist in Python 3.9.
    One additional change that I have made is that I have gone back to my
    older implementation for __add__ on account of a bug in the new
    implementation that I had incorporated in Version 3.4.9.

- Update to 3.4.9:
   * Version 3.4.9, in addition to implementing __iadd__, also includes a
     significantly faster implementation for __add__.  For extending a given
     instance of BitVector, the implementation for __iadd__ adds bits to the
     existing instance as opposed to creating a new instance.  These changes
     to the module should make it easier to solve larger problems more
     quickly with BitVector.
