%description
A high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations.
The goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps
the entire Kerberos.framework, and instead offer a limited set of
functions that do what is needed for client/server Kerberos
authentication based on <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt>.
