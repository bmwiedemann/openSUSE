- updated to 1.35
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Time-Local/Changes

  1.35     2023-04-29
  - This is the same as 1.34.
  - The code now explicitly handles non-integer seconds values. This fixes the
    confusing things that timelocal() does with non-integer seconds but does not
    turn the seconds value into an integer. Based on a bug report from Dmitriy
    Shamatrin. GH #18.
  1.34     2023-03-25 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  - Fix for test failures seen on 32-bit systems with older Perl versions.
  1.33     2023-02-12 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  - Fix for breakage on (some?) 32-bit platforms. If an integer calculation done
    internally overflowed all calls to this module's subs could error with "Day
    too big - 105412 > -2147483648". This fix reduces the range of acceptable
    epochs but should make the module usable again on such systems.
  1.32     2023-02-12 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  - This is an alternative to the changes in the 1.31 release. Instead of
    restoring "use integer", the code now explicitly handles non-integer seconds
    values. This fixes the confusing things that timelocal() does with
    non-integer seconds but does not turn the seconds value into an
    integer. Based on a bug report from Dmitriy Shamatrin. GH #18.
  1.31     2021-11-09 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  - Restored the use of "use integer", which was removed in 2010 as part of the
    change to support a 64-bit time_t in Perl, regardless of the platform. The
    timelocal() sub does very confusing things with non-integer seconds because
    internally it calls the system's localtime() function. And that localtime()
    function may strip off the non-integer portion of the seconds value. This
    leads to extremely confusing results because of the math that this module
    does on the return value of localtime() internally.
    With "use integer" back in effect the results are much more
    predictable. Based on a bug report from Dmitriy Shamatrin. GH #18.

Mon Jan 27 03:09:01 UTC 2020 -  <timueller+perl@suse.de>

- updated to 1.30
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Time-Local/Changes

  1.30     2020-01-26
  
  - Identical to 1.30.
  
  
  1.29     2020-01-18 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Added timelocal_posix() and timegm_posix() subs. These are _exact_ opposites
    of Perl's localtime() and gmtime(), meaning that a round trip between the
    two pairs always produces the same value.
