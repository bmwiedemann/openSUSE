- update to version 3.0.0
 - The following is a major release of the `rt` library.
  - There is support for the REST API version 1 as well as version 2.
  - Please note that this release contains breaking changes and requires adaptations to existing code, even if you are sticking to version 1 of the API.
  - These changes were necessary in order to properly support both API versions.
 - Added
  - RT REST2 support was added and is mostly on par with the REST1 support (differences are a result of the REST2 API implementation differences in RT).
  - REST2 is a modern API based on JSON exchanges and thus the complex parsing of responses and request construction are no longer needed.
 - Changes
  - Existing exception classes were renamed to adhere to the naming convention (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#exception-names).
   - In case you do catch specific `rt` exceptions, a simple search/replace will do, see the changelog page in the documentation for details.
  - Importing the `rt` class changed in order to better accommodate the new `rest2` implementation.
   - Where one use to be able to import `rt` using:
     `from rt import Rt`
     you now have to use the following syntax:
     `from rt.rest1 import Rt`
  - Importing the `rt` module does no longer import all exceptions but only the core `RtError` exception.
  - If you require other exceptions, please import them from `rt.exceptions`.
  - Use pytest instead of nose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 27 10:11:12 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 2.2.1:
 - Fix bug in get_attachment_content which was a workaround for a bug in RT <=4.2 (trailing new-lines) but which was fixed in RT >=4.2. This made tests fail and return falsely stripped attachment content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 15 20:53:35 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 2.2.0:
