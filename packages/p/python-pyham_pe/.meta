  <title>Client implementation of the AGWPE protocol for packet radio</title>
  <description>This package provides a client implementation of the AGWPE protocol, enabling
and simplifying the creation of applications using that protocol in order to
communicate with servers such as Direwolf or ldsped.

A lower level API provides access to the protocol at a level close to that of
individual AGWPE frames (not to be confused with AX.25 frames), enabling the
ultimate level of control over communication with the server.

A higher level API provides abstractions helpful in building more complex
applications, transparently taking care of some of the details, such as
connection management and monitoring.

The AGWPE protocol, and thus this package, has the advantage, over other
commonly used protocols such as KISS, that it can be easily used to create
connected-mode sessions. As such, it can be used to create many types of ham
radio software, from simple beaconing to full-fledged packet radio terminal
applications akin to Linpac. (See PyHam’s Paracon software for an example of
the latter.)</description>
