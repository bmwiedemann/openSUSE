- skip python36: NEP 29 makes python36-numpy and -scipy unavailable
  in TW
- Don't build inplace for tests, drop deprecated setup.py test
  command

Sun Feb  2 18:02:39 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.12.0:
  + scipy.fft interface This interface operates like the existing
    scipy.fftpack interface, but matches the API of the newer
    scipy.fft module introduced in SciPy 1.4.
  + test suite was updated to be compatible with more recent dask
    (gh#pyFFTW/pyFFTW#278).
  + Cython variable _N was renamed to avoid a name conflict with a
    preprocessor token on some platforms (gh#pyFFTW/pyFFTW#259).
  + Cython code has been updated to explicitly use
    `language_level=3str` for compatibility with a future Cython
    3.0 release.
- Drop 265.patch: Incorporated upstream.
- Update URL and Source URL to point to new github repository.

  * 265.patch (Fix Factory builds)

Sat Dec 22 02:44:02 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.11.1
  + New features
    * Dask interface
    * Fast transform planning utility
    * Expanded support for norm keyword argument in the numpy interfaces
    * Support for norm keyword argument in FFTW builders
    * Dynamic library detection at build and run time
    * OpenMP threading support
    * Custom Configuration of Planners and Interfaces
  + Bugs Fixed
    * A platform-dependent bug that results in potentially overwriting a previously
      computed output upon repeated calls to the numpy interfaces was fixed (#199).
    * Fix to potential platform-dependent integer overflow in empty_aligned (#192).
    * rfftfreq is now present in the numpy fft interfaces for numpy >= 1.8 (#207)
  + Other changes
    * float16 inputs are now transformed using single rather than double precision.
    * The default planning for the numpy and scipy interfaces has changed from
      FFTW_MEASURE to FFTW_ESTIMATE.  This results in faster planning.  In cases
      where the same transform is to be repeated many times, it is likely
      advantageous to manually specify FFTW_MEASURE instead (or use the FFTW builders
      to pre-plan the FFT).
    * FutureWarnings related to NumPy multiindexing in NumPy 1.15 are avoided by
      using more modern indexing conventions.
    * version number handling is now automatically handled by versioneer
    * All documentation is now built and hosted at Read the Docs (
      http://pyfftw.readthedocs.io).

- Implement single-spec version
- Update to version 0.10.4
  + Fixed bugs:
    * Numpy interface can fail with non-writeable arrays.
    * undefined symbol: simd\_alignment with gcc 5.3.0
    * FTBFS: TypeError: can't pickle Cython.Compiler.FlowControl.NameAssignment objects
  + Closed issues:
    * pyfftw fails with ImportError/undefined symbol fftwl\_plan\_with\_nthreads
    * pyfftw does not appear to be using available wisdom files
    * Accuracy of non-power 2 data
    * Cannot find fftw3l when installing from pip

    * Release GIL during planning?
    * Merging/sharing wisdom
    * scipy interface patching.
    * very slow test suite
    * setup: some targets should not require numpy to be installed
    * 2x margin on the planning timelimit test is inadequate in windows on Complex64
