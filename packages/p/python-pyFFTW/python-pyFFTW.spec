%description
pyFFTW is a pythonic wrapper around the FFTW libary.
An interface for all the possible transforms that FFTW can perform is provided.

Both the complex DFT and the real DFT are supported, as well as arbitrary
axes of abitrary shaped and strided arrays, which makes it almost
feature equivalent to standard and real FFT functions of ``numpy.fft``
(indeed, it supports the ``clongdouble`` dtype which ``numpy.fft`` does not).

Operating FFTW in multithreaded mode is supported.

A comprehensive unittest suite can be found with the source on the github
repository.
