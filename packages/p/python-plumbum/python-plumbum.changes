  * If you install from the auto-generated tarball for Git
    releases, you should either use
    SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=${pkgver} pip install . (where
    pkgver is the package version, 1.7.0 in this case), or (not
    recommended) install setuptools_scm before running
    SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=${pkgver} python setup.py
    install. PyPI SDists have the version file already, and git
    checkouts will get the version from git tags.
