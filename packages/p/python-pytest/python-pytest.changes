  * Fix regression in 8.2.2 that did not allow test case reruns.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  6 11:48:38 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 8.2.2
  * Support for Python 3.13 (beta1 at the time of writing).
  * Fix `PermissionError` crashes arising from directories which are not 
    selected on the command-line.
  * Keyboard interrupts and system exits are now properly handled during 
    the test collection.
  * Fixed handling of 'Function not implemented' error under squashfuse_ll, 
    which is a different way to say that the mountpoint is read-only.

    automatically-created .pytest_cache directories became rwx------ 
    instead of the expected rwxr-xr-x.
  * Fix possible catastrophic performance slowdown on a certain 
    parametrization pattern involving many higher-scoped parameters.
  * Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where unittest class instances were 
    not released promptly on test teardown but only on session teardown.
  * Fix possible “Directory not empty” crashes arising from concurent cache 
    dir (.pytest_cache) creation. Regressed in pytest 8.2.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  6 05:24:11 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 8.2.0:
  * A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the
    following hooks request a deprecated py.path.local parameter.
  * Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the
    prefix character @.
  * Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where test classes containing
    setup_method and tests using @staticmethod or @classmethod would crash
    with AttributeError.
  * pluggy>=1.5.0 is now required.
  * Added PYTEST_VERSION environment variable which is defined at the start
    of the pytest session and undefined afterwards.

    control of test execution verbosity.
  * --import-mode=importlib <import-mode-importlib> now tries to import
    modules using the standard import mechanism.
  * Added support for sys.last_exc for post-mortem debugging on Python>=3.12.
  * Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 that would cause test collection to
    fail due to permission errors when using --pyargs.
  * Fix the stacklevel used when warning about marks used on fixtures.
  * Fix an edge case where ExceptionInfo._stringify_exception could crash.
  * Fix an IndexError crash raising from getstatementrange_ast.
  * PytestRemovedIn8Warning deprecation warnings are now errors by default.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.7.

Mon Feb 19 09:15:31 UTC 2024 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- Add python version constraints to Requires & BuildRequires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 08:23:53 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.4.4:
  * Fix non-string constants at the top of file being detected as
    docstrings on Python>=3.8.
  * Handle an edge case where :data:`sys.stderr` and
    :data:`sys.__stderr__` might already be closed when
    :ref:`faulthandler` is tearing down.
  * Fixed tracebacks from collection errors not getting pruned.
  * Removed unhelpful error message from assertion rewrite
    mechanism when exceptions are raised in ``__iter__`` methods.
    Now they are treated un-iterable instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  7 12:01:50 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.4.3:
  * Markers are now considered in the
    reverse mro order to ensure base  class markers are
    considered first -- this resolves a regression.
  * Fixed ``:=`` in asserts impacting unrelated test cases.
  * Handled an edge case where :data:`sys.stderr` might already
    be closed when :ref:`faulthandler` is tearing down.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 18 15:04:41 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.4.2:
  * Fix doctest collection of
    `functools.cached_property` objects.
  * Fixed bug using
    ``--importmode=importlib`` which would cause package
    ``__init__.py`` files to be imported more than once in some
    cases.
  * Fixed bug where `user_properties`
    where not being saved in the JUnit XML file if a fixture
    failed during teardown.
  * Fixed crash when parsing long
    command line arguments that might be interpreted as files.
  * Improved Documentation
  * Improved disclaimer on pytest
    plugin reference page to better indicate this is an
    automated, non-curated listing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 08:50:26 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.4.1:
  * Fixed bug where fake intermediate
    modules generated by ``--import-mode=importlib`` would not
    include the child modules as attributes of the parent modules.
  * Fixed error assertion handling in
    :func:`pytest.approx` when ``None`` is an expected or
    received value when comparing dictionaries.
  * Fixed issue when using
    ``--import-mode=importlib`` together with ``--doctest-
    modules`` that caused modules to be imported more than once,
    causing problems with modules that have import side effects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 15 15:04:08 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.4.0:
  *  Added
    :func:`ExceptionInfo.from_exception()
    <pytest.ExceptionInfo.from_exception>`, a simpler way to
    create an :class:`~pytest.ExceptionInfo` from an exception.
    This can replace :func:`ExceptionInfo.from_exc_info()
    <pytest.ExceptionInfo.from_exc_info()>` for most uses.
  * Update test log report annotation
    to named tuple and fixed inconsistency in docs for
    :hook:`pytest_report_teststatus` hook.
  * When an exception traceback to be
    displayed is completely filtered out (by mechanisms such as
    ``__tracebackhide__``, internal frames, and similar), now
    only the exception string and the following message are
    shown:
      "All traceback entries are hidden. Pass `--full-trace` to see
      hidden and internal frames.".
  * Improved verbose output (``-vv``)
    of ``skip`` and ``xfail`` reasons by performing text wrapping
    while leaving a clear margin for progress output.
  * Added ``TerminalReporter.wrap_write()`` as a helper for that.
  * Added handling of ``%f``
    directive to print microseconds in log format options, such
    as ``log-date-format``.
  * Added the underlying exception to the cache provider's path
    creation and write warning messages.
  * Added warning when :confval:`testpaths` is set, but paths are
    not found by glob.
    In this case, pytest will fall back to searching from the
    current directory.
  * When `--confcutdir` is not
    specified, and there is no config file present, the conftest
    cutoff directory (`--confcutdir`) is now set to the
    :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>`.
  * Previously in such cases, `conftest.py` files would be probed
    all the way to the root directory of the filesystem.
  * If you are badly affected by this change, consider adding an
    empty config file to your desired cutoff directory, or
    explicitly set `--confcutdir`.
  * The :confval:`norecursedirs`
    check is now performed in a :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect`
    implementation, so plugins can affect it.
  * If after updating to this version you see that your
    `norecursedirs` setting is not being respected,
  * it means that a conftest or a plugin you use has a bad
    `pytest_ignore_collect` implementation.
  * Most likely, your hook returns `False` for paths it does not
    want to ignore which ends the processing and doesn't allow
    other plugins, including pytest itself, to ignore the path.
  * The fix is to return `None` instead of `False` for paths your
    hook doesn't want to ignore.
  * :func:`caplog.set_level()
    <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>` and
    :func:`caplog.at_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.at_level>`
    will temporarily enable the requested ``level`` if ``level``
    was disabled globally via ``logging.disable(LEVEL)``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 19 20:12:27 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.3.2:
  * Fix bug where very long option
    names could cause pytest to break with ``OSError: [Errno 36]
    File name too long`` on some systems.
  * Support for Python 3.12
  * honored to load root ``conftests``.
  * The `monkeypatch` `setitem`/`delitem` type annotations now
    allow `TypedDict` arguments.
  * Fixed bug in assertion rewriting
    where a variable assigned with the walrus operator could not
    be used later in a function call.
  * Fixed ``--last-failed``'s
    "(skipped N files)" functionality for files inside of
    packages (directories with `__init__.py` files).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 13 10:35:00 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- update to 7.3.1:
  * Python 3.12 support
- update to 7.3.0:
  *  --log-disable CLI option added to disable individual loggers.
  * Added tmp_path_retention_count and tmp_path_retention_policy
    configuration options to control how directories created by

  * For list of omprovements and bugfixes, please read
    https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html#pytest-7-3-0-2023-04-08

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 23:01:07 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.2.2:
  * Fixed :func:`pytest.approx`
    handling of dictionaries containing one or more values of
    `0.0`.
  * Fixed crash if `--cache-show` and `--help` are passed at the
    same time.
  * Fixed bug where a fixture method named ``teardown`` would
    be called as part of ``nose`` teardown stage.
  * Fixed crash if ``--fixtures`` and ``--help`` are passed
    at the same time.
  * Fixed :py:func:`pytest.raises` to
    return a 'ContextManager' so that type-checkers could narrow
    :code:`pytest.raises(...) if ... else nullcontext()` down to
    'ContextManager' rather than 'object'.
  * Fix 'importlib.abc.TraversableResources' deprecation warning in
    Python 3.12.
  * If a test is skipped from inside a fixture, the test summary
    now shows the test location instead of the fixture location.
  * Fix a race condition when creating junitxml reports,
    which could occur when multiple instances of pytest execute
    in parallel.
  * Fix a race condition when
    creating or updating the stepwise plugin's cache, which could
    occur when multiple xdist worker nodes try to simultaneously
    update the stepwise plugin's cache.

Tue Nov 29 13:09:22 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Remove python_module macro definition
- Update to 7.2.0:
  # Deprecations
  - #10012: Update pytest.PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning{.interpreted-text
    role="class"} to a deprecation; it will raise an error in pytest 8.
  - #10396: pytest no longer depends on the py library. pytest provides a
    vendored copy of py.error and py.path modules but will use the py library
    if it is installed. If you need other py.* modules, continue to install the
    deprecated py library separately, otherwise it can usually be removed as a
    dependency.
  - #4562: Deprecate configuring hook specs/impls using attributes/marks.
  - Instead use :pypytest.hookimpl{.interpreted-text role="func"} and
    :pypytest.hookspec{.interpreted-text role="func"}.
    For more details, see the docs
    <legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
  - #9886: The functionality for running tests written for nose has been
    officially deprecated.
    This includes:
     * Plain setup and teardown functions and methods: this might catch users
       by surprise, as setup() and teardown() are not pytest idioms, but part
       of the nose support.
     * Setup/teardown using the @with_setup decorator.
    For more details, consult the deprecation docs
    <nose-deprecation>{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
  # Features
  -  #9897: Added shell-style wildcard support to testpaths.
  # Improvements
  - #10218: @pytest.mark.parametrize() (and similar functions) now accepts any
    Sequence[str] for the argument names, instead of just list[str] and
    tuple[str, ...].
    (Note that str, which is itself a Sequence[str], is still treated as a
    comma-delimited name list, as before).
  - #10381: The --no-showlocals flag has been added. This can be passed
    directly to tests to override --showlocals declared through addopts.
  - #3426: Assertion failures with strings in NFC and NFD forms that normalize
    to the same string now have a dedicated error message detailing the issue,
    and their utf-8 representation is expresed instead.
  - #7337: A warning is now emitted if a test function returns something other
    than [None]{.title-ref}. This prevents a common mistake among beginners
    that expect that returning a [bool]{.title-ref} (for example [return foo(a,
    b) == result]{.title-ref}) would cause a test to pass or fail, instead of
    using [assert]{.title-ref}.
  - #8508: Introduce multiline display for warning matching via
    :pypytest.warns{.interpreted-text role="func"} and enhance match comparison
    for :py_pytest._code.ExceptionInfo.match{.interpreted-text role="func"} as
    returned by :pypytest.raises{.interpreted-text role="func"}.
  - #8646: Improve :pypytest.raises{.interpreted-text role="func"}. Previously
    passing an empty tuple would give a confusing error. We now raise
    immediately with a more helpful message.
  - #9741: On Python 3.11, use the standard library's tomllib{.interpreted-text
    role="mod"} to parse TOML.  tomli{.interpreted-text role="mod"}` is no
    longer a dependency on Python 3.11.
  - #9742: Display assertion message without escaped newline characters with
    -vv.
  - #9823: Improved error message that is shown when no collector is found for
    a given file.
  - #9873: Some coloring has been added to the short test summary.
  - #9883: Normalize the help description of all command-line options.
  - #9920: Display full crash messages in short test summary info, when runng
    in a CI environment.
  - #9987: Added support for hidden configuration file by allowing .pytest.ini
    as an alternative to pytest.ini.
  # Bug Fixes
  - #10150: sys.stdin{.interpreted-text role="data"} now contains all expected
    methods of a file-like object when capture is enabled.
  - #10382: Do not break into pdb when raise unittest.SkipTest() appears
    top-level in a file.
  - #7792: Marks are now inherited according to the full MRO in test classes.
    Previously, if a test class inherited from two or more classes, only marks
    from the first super-class would apply.

    When inheriting marks from super-classes, marks from the sub-classes are
    now ordered before marks from the super-classes, in MRO order. Previously
    it was the reverse.

    When inheriting marks from super-classes, the [pytestmark]{.title-ref}
    attribute of the sub-class now only contains the marks directly applied to
    it. Previously, it also contained marks from its super-classes. Please note
    that this attribute should not normally be accessed directly; use
    pytest.Node.iter_markers{.interpreted-text role="func"} instead.

  - #9159: Showing inner exceptions by forcing native display in
    ExceptionGroups even when using display options other than --tb=native. A
    temporary step before full implementation of pytest-native display for
    inner exceptions in ExceptionGroups.

  - #9877: Ensure caplog.get_records(when) returns current/correct data after
    invoking caplog.clear().

  # Improved Documentation
  - #10344: Update information on writing plugins to use pyproject.toml instead
    of setup.py.
  - #9248: The documentation is now built using Sphinx 5.x (up from 3.x
    previously).
  - #9291: Update documentation on how pytest.warns{.interpreted-text
    role="func"} affects DeprecationWarning{.interpreted-text role="class"}.
- pytest 7.1.3 (2022-08-31)
  # Bug Fixes
  - #10060: When running with --pdb, TestCase.tearDown is no longer called for
    tests when the class has been skipped via unittest.skip or
    pytest.mark.skip.
  - #10190: Invalid XML characters in setup or teardown error messages are now
    properly escaped for JUnit XML reports.
  - #10230: Ignore .py files created by pyproject.toml-based editable builds
    introduced in pip 21.3.
  - #3396: Doctests now respect the --import-mode flag.
  - #9514: Type-annotate FixtureRequest.param as Any as a stop gap measure
    until 8073{.interpreted-text role="issue"} is fixed.
  - #9791: Fixed a path handling code in rewrite.py that seems to work fine,
    but was incorrect and fails in some systems.
  - #9917: Fixed string representation for pytest.approx{.interpreted-text
    role="func"} when used to compare tuples.
  # Improved Documentation
  - #9937: Explicit note that tmpdir{.interpreted-text role="fixture"} fixture
    is discouraged in favour of tmp_path{.interpreted-text role="fixture"}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 11:36:38 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.1.2
  * #9726: An unnecessary numpy import inside
    pytest.approx{.interpreted-text role="func"} was removed.
  * #9820: Fix comparison of dataclasses with InitVar.
  * #9869: Increase stacklevel for the NODE_CTOR_FSPATH_ARG
    deprecation to point to the user's code, not pytest.
  * #9871: Fix a bizarre (and fortunately rare) bug where the
    [temp_path]{.title-ref} fixture could raise an internal error
    while attempting to get the current user's username.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 25 23:39:31 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.1.1

    conftest.py files outside of the source tree (e.g. in the
   [site-packages]{.title-ref} directory) were not picked up.
- python-pytest5 is gone. Remove the libalts stopgap

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 13 08:38:16 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.1.0
  * Big changelog for 7.x series, see
    https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/changelog.html for details
- Breaking changes:
  * #8838: As per our policy, the following features have been
    deprecated in the 6.X series and are now removed:
    + pytest._fillfuncargs function.
    + pytest_warning_captured hook - use pytest_warning_recorded
      instead.
    + -k -foobar syntax - use -k 'not foobar' instead.
    + -k foobar: syntax.
    * pytest.collect module - import from pytest directly.
  * #9437: Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached
    end-of-life at 2021-12-23.
  * #7259: The Node.reportinfo() function first return value type
    has been expanded from py.path.local | str to os.PathLike[str]
    | str.
    Most plugins which refer to reportinfo() only define it as part
    of a custom pytest.Item implementation. Since py.path.local is
    a os.PathLike[str], these plugins are unaffacted.

    Plugins and users which call reportinfo(), use the first return
    value and interact with it as a py.path.local, would need to
    adjust by calling py.path.local(fspath). Although preferably,
    avoid the legacy py.path.local and use pathlib.Path, or use
    item.location or item.path, instead.

    Note: pytest was not able to provide a deprecation period for
    this change.
  * #8246: --version now writes version information to stdout
    rather than stderr.
  * #8733: Drop a workaround for pyreadline that made it work with
    --pdb. The workaround was introduced in #1281 in 2015, however
    since then pyreadline seems to have gone unmaintained, is
    generating warnings, and will stop working on Python 3.10.
  * #9061: Using pytest.approx() in a boolean context now raises an
    error hinting at the proper usage.

    It is apparently common for users to mistakenly use
    pytest.approx like this:

        assert pytest.approx(actual, expected)

    While the correct usage is:

        assert actual == pytest.approx(expected)

    The new error message helps catch those mistakes.
  * #9277: The pytest.Instance collector type has been removed.
    Importing pytest.Instance or _pytest.python.Instance returns a
    dummy type and emits a deprecation warning. See The
    pytest.Instance collector for details.
  * If you have concerns about the removal of a specific feature,
    please add a comment to issue #9308.

- Update to 6.2.4
  * pytest used to create directories under /tmp with world-readable
    permissions. This means that any user in the system was able to
    read information written by tests in temporary directories (such
    as those created by the tmp_path/tmpdir fixture). Now the
    directories are created with private permissions.
  * Fixed assertion rewriting on Python 3.10.

  * Handle exit.Exception raised in notify_exception (via pytest_internalerror), e.g. when quitting pdb from post mortem.
  * default value of junit_family option will change to xunit2 in
    pytest 6.0, given that this is the version supported by default in
    modern tools that manipulate this type of file.
  * In order to smooth the transition, pytest will issue a warning in
    case the --junitxml option is given in the command line but
    junit_family is not explicitly configured in pytest.ini.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 18 08:14:19 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 5.1.1
 * Removed:
   + Request.getfuncargvalue: use Request.getfixturevalue instead.
   + pytest.raises and pytest.warns no longer support strings as the second argument.
   + message parameter of pytest.raises.
   + pytest.raises, pytest.warns and ParameterSet.param now use native keyword-only
     syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but
     they still raise TypeError on unknown keyword arguments as before.
   + pytest.config global variable.
   + tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp method.
   + pytest_logwarning hook.
   + RemovedInPytest4Warning warning type.
   + request is now a reserved name for fixtures.
   + Removed unused support code for unittest2.
   + pytest.fail, pytest.xfail and pytest.skip no longer support bytes
     for the message argument.
 * New Config.invocation_args attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to pytest.main().
 * New NUMBER option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers
 * JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.
 * Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with “__init__.py” only.
 * Warnings issued during pytest_configure are explicitly not treated as errors,
    even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.
 * The XML file produced by --junitxml now correctly contain a <testsuites> root element.
 * Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example -vs) in Python 3.8+.
 * Fix issue where tmp_path and tmpdir would not remove directories containing
    files marked as read-only, which could lead to pytest crashing when executed
    a second time with the --basetemp option.
 * Replace importlib_metadata backport with importlib.metadata from the standard
    library on Python 3.8+.
 * Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (pytest.xfail,
    pytest.skip, etc) so they provide better error messages when users meant
    to use marks (for example @pytest.xfail instead of @pytest.mark.xfail).
 * Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot
    be compared for truth values against others, like numpy arrays.
 * pytest.exit is now correctly handled in unittest cases. This makes unittest
    cases handle quit from pytest’s pdb correctly.
 * Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.
 * Fix collection of staticmethod objects defined with functools.partial.
 * Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer
    to async def functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  5 08:13:05 UTC 2018 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 3.10.0
 * Resume capturing output after continue with __import__("pdb").set_trace().
 * Add -sw, --stepwise as an alternative to --lf -x for stopping at the first
    failure, but starting the next test invocation from that test.
 * Make --color emit colorful dots when not running in verbose mode.
 * Improve performance with collection reporting in non-quiet mode with terminals.
 * The "collecting …" message is only printed/updated every 0.5s.
 * Fix false RemovedInPytest4Warning: usage of Session... is deprecated,
    please use pytest warnings.
 * Fix problems with running tests in package __init__.py files.
 * Swallow warnings during anonymous compilation of source.
 * Fix access denied error when deleting stale directories
    created by tmpdir / tmp_path.
 * Naming a fixture request will now raise a warning: the request fixture
    is internal and should not be overwritten as it will lead to internal errors.
 * Handle (ignore) exceptions raised during collection, e.g.
    with Django's LazySettings proxy class.
 * Added missing documentation about the fact that module names passed
    to filter warnings are not regex-escaped.
 * Display cachedir also in non-verbose mode if non-default.
 * pdb: improve message about output capturing with set_trace.
 * Do not display "IO-capturing turned off/on" when -s is used to avoid confusion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 26 10:59:13 UTC 2018 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 3.9.2
 * Improve error message when a recursive dependency between fixtures is detected.
 * Fix logging messages not shown in hooks pytest_sessionstart() and pytest_sessionfinish().
 * Fix unescaped XML raw objects in JUnit report for skipped tests
 * Python 2: safely format warning message about passing unicode strings to
    warnings.warn, which may cause surprising MemoryError exception when monkey
    patching warnings.warn itself.
 * Improve error message when it is not possible to determine a function’s signature.
 * Pin setuptools>=40.0 to support py_modules in setup.cfg
 * Restore the tmpdir behaviour of symlinking the current test run.
 * Fix filename reported by warnings.warn when using recwarn under python2.
 * For test-suites containing test classes, the information about the subclassed
    module is now output only if a higher verbosity level is specified (at least “-vv”).
 * The following accesses have been documented as deprecated for years, but are now
    actually emitting deprecation warnings.
 * Add a Deprecation warning for pytest.ensuretemp as it was deprecated since a while.
 * Improve usage errors messages by hiding internal details which can
    be distracting and noisy.
    This has the side effect that some error conditions that previously raised
    generic errors (such as ValueError for unregistered marks) are now raising
    Failed exceptions.
 * Log messages generated in the collection phase are shown when live-logging
    is enabled and/or when they are logged to a file.
 * Introduce tmp_path as a fixture providing a Path object.
 * Deprecation warnings are now shown even if you customize the warnings
    filters yourself. In the previous version any customization would override
    pytest’s filters and deprecation warnings would fall back to being hidden by default.
 * Allow specification of timeout for Testdir.runpytest_subprocess() and Testdir.run().
 * Add returncode argument to pytest.exit() to exit pytest with a specific return code.
 * Reimplement pytest.deprecated_call using pytest.warns so it supports
    the match='...' keyword argument.
    This has the side effect that pytest.deprecated_call now raises
    pytest.fail.Exception instead of AssertionError.
 * Improve error message when test functions of unittest.TestCase subclasses
    use a parametrized fixture.
 * request.fixturenames now correctly returns the name of fixtures
    created by request.getfixturevalue().
 * Warning filters passed as command line options using -W now take precedence
    over filters defined in ini configuration files.
 * Fix source reindenting by using textwrap.dedent directly.
 * pytest.warn will capture previously-warned warnings in Python 2.
    Previously they were never raised.
 * Resolve symbolic links for args.
    This fixes running pytest tests/test_foo.py::test_bar, where tests is
    a symlink to project/app/tests: previously project/app/conftest.py would be
    ignored for fixtures then.
 * Fix duplicate printing of internal errors when using --pdb.
 * pathlib based tmpdir cleanup now correctly handles symlinks in the folder.
 * Display the filename when encountering SyntaxWarning.
 * Update usefixtures documentation to clarify that it can’t be used
    with fixture functions.
 * Update fixture documentation to specify that a fixture can be invoked twice
    in the scope it’s defined for.
 * According to unittest.rst, setUpModule and tearDownModule were not implemented,
    but it turns out they are. So updated the documentation for unittest.
 * Add tempir testing example to CONTRIBUTING.rst guide
 * The internal MarkerError exception has been removed.
 * Port the implementation of tmpdir to pathlib.
 * Exclude 0.00 second entries from --duration output unless -vv is passed
    on the command-line.
 * Fixed formatting of string literals in internal tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 24 10:43:29 UTC 2018 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 3.8.1
- drop remove_mock.patch
 * .pytest_cache directory is now automatically ignored by Git
 * Fix the following error during collection of tests inside packages:
    'TypeError: object of type 'Package' has no len()'
 * Fix bug where indirect parametrization would consider the scope of all
     fixtures used by the test function to determine the parametrization scope,
     and not only the scope of the fixtures being parametrized.
 * Fix crash of the assertion rewriter if a test changed the current working
     directory without restoring it afterwards.
 * Fix issue that prevented some caplog properties (for example record_tuples)
     from being available when entering the debugger with --pdb.
 * Fix UnicodeDecodeError in python2.x when a class returns a non-ascii binary
     __repr__ in an assertion which also contains non-ascii text.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 17 09:39:03 UTC 2018 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 3.8.0
 * Config.warn has been deprecated, it should be replaced by calls
    to the standard warnings.warn.
 * Node.warn now supports two signatures:
     + node.warn(PytestWarning("some message")): is now the recommended way
        to call this function. The warning instance must be a PytestWarning
        or subclass instance.
     + node.warn("CI", "some message"): this code/message form is now deprecated
        and should be converted to the warning instance form above.
 * RemovedInPytest4Warning and PytestExperimentalApiWarning are now part
     of the public API and should be accessed using pytest.RemovedInPytest4Warning
     and pytest.PytestExperimentalApiWarning.
 * @pytest.mark.filterwarnings second parameter is no longer regex-escaped,
     making it possible to actually use regular expressions to check the warning message.
    + Note: regex-escaping the match string was an implementation oversight
        that might break test suites which depend on the old behavior.
 * Internal pytest warnings are now issued using the standard warnings module,
     making it possible to use the standard warnings filters to manage those
     warnings. This introduces PytestWarning, PytestDeprecationWarning
     and RemovedInPytest4Warning warning types as part of the public API.
 * DeprecationWarning and PendingDeprecationWarning are now shown by default
     if no other warning filter is configured. This makes pytest more compliant
     with PEP-0506. See the docs for more info.
 * Warnings are now captured and displayed during test collection.
 * PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD environment variable disables
    plugin auto-loading when set.
 * Added the count option to console_output_style to enable displaying
    the progress as a count instead of a percentage.
 * Added support for ‘xfailed’ and ‘xpassed’ outcomes
    to the pytester.RunResult.assert_outcomes signature.

Thu Aug  2 12:57:23 UTC 2018 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

-  update to 3.7.0
 * pytest_namespace has been deprecated.
 * Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test
    function, now issues a RemovedInPytest4Warning.
 * New package fixture scope: fixtures are finalized when the last test of
    a package finishes. This feature is considered experimental, so use it sparingly.
 * Node.add_marker now supports an append=True/False parameter to determine
    whether the mark comes last (default) or first.
 * Fixture caplog now has a messages property, providing convenient access
    to the format-interpolated log messages without the extra data provided by the formatter/handler.
 * New --trace option to enter the debugger at the start of a test.
 * Introduce pytester.copy_example as helper to do acceptance tests
   against examples from the project.

Thu May 31 04:42:41 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.6.0
  + Features
    * Revamp the internals of the ``pytest.mark`` implementation with correct per
      node handling which fixes a number of long standing bugs caused by the old
      design. This introduces new ``Node.iter_markers(name)`` and
      ``Node.get_closest_mark(name)`` APIs. Users are **strongly encouraged** to
      read the `reasons for the revamp in the docs
      <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.html#marker-revamp-and-iteration>`_,
      or jump over to details about `updating existing code to use the new APIs
      <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.html#updating-code>`_. (`#3317
      <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3317>`_)
    * Now when ``@pytest.fixture`` is applied more than once to the same function a
      ``ValueError`` is raised. This buggy behavior would cause surprising problems
      and if was working for a test suite it was mostly by accident. (`#2334
      <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2334>`_)
    * Support for Python 3.7's builtin ``breakpoint()`` method, see `Using the
      builtin breakpoint function
      <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html#breakpoint-builtin>`_ for
      details. (`#3180 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3180>`_)
    * ``monkeypatch`` now supports a ``context()`` function which acts as a context
      manager which undoes all patching done within the ``with`` block. (`#3290
      <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3290>`_)
    * The ``--pdb`` option now causes KeyboardInterrupt to enter the debugger,
      instead of stopping the test session. On python 2.7, hitting CTRL+C again
      exits the debugger. On python 3.2 and higher, use CTRL+D. (`#3299
      <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3299>`_)
    * pytest not longer changes the log level of the root logger when the
      ``log-level`` parameter has greater numeric value than that of the level of
      the root logger, which makes it play better with custom logging configuration
      in user code. (`#3307 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3307>`_)
  + Bug Fixes
    * A rare race-condition which might result in corrupted ``.pyc`` files on
      Windows has been hopefully solved. (`#3008
      <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008>`_)
    * Also use iter_marker for discovering the marks applying for marker
      expressions from the cli to avoid the bad data from the legacy mark storage.
      (`#3441 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3441>`_)
    * When showing diffs of failed assertions where the contents contain only
      whitespace, escape them using ``repr()`` first to make it easy to spot the
      differences. (`#3443 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3443>`_)
  + Improved Documentation
    * Change documentation copyright year to a range which auto-updates itself each
      time it is published. (`#3303
      <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3303>`_)
  + Trivial/Internal Changes
    * ``pytest`` now depends on the `python-atomicwrites
      <https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites>`_ library. (`#3008
      <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3008>`_)
    * Update all pypi.python.org URLs to pypi.org. (`#3431
      <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3431>`_)
    * Detect `pytest_` prefixed hooks using the internal plugin manager since
      ``pluggy`` is deprecating the ``implprefix`` argument to ``PluginManager``.
      (`#3487 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3487>`_)
    * Import ``Mapping`` and ``Sequence`` from ``_pytest.compat`` instead of
      directly from ``collections`` in ``python_api.py::approx``. Add ``Mapping``
      to ``_pytest.compat``, import it from ``collections`` on python 2, but from
      ``collections.abc`` on Python 3 to avoid a ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python
      3.7 or newer. (`#3497 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3497>`_)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 28 19:38:40 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.5.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Reset sys.last_type, sys.last_value and sys.last_traceback
      before each test executes. Those attributes are added by pytest
      during the test run to aid debugging, but were never reset so
      they would create a leaking reference to the last failing test’s
      frame which in turn could never be reclaimed by the garbage
      collector. (#2798)
    + pytest.raises now raises TypeError when receiving an unknown
      keyword argument. (#3348)
    + pytest.raises now works with exception classes that look like
      iterables. (#3372)
  * Improved Documentation
    + Fix typo in caplog fixture documentation, which incorrectly
      identified certain attributes as methods. (#3406)
  * Trivial/Internal Changes
    + Added a more indicative error message when parametrizing a
      function whose argument takes a default value. (#3221)
    + Remove internal _pytest.terminal.flatten function in favor of
      more_itertools.collapse. (#3330)
    + Import some modules from collections.abc instead of collections
      as the former modules trigger DeprecationWarning in Python
      3.7. (#3339)
    + record_property is no longer experimental, removing the warnings
      was forgotten. (#3360)
    + Mention in documentation and CLI help that fixtures with leading
      _ are printed by pytest --fixtures only if the -v option is
      added. (#3398)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 29 13:22:39 UTC 2018 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- update to 3.5.0
- new install dependency python-more-itertools
- more changes in CHANGELOG.rst

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  9 08:37:51 UTC 2018 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

* Refactor check of bindir from exists to isdir.
* Fix TypeError issue when using approx with a Decimal value.
* Fix reference cycle generated when using the request fixture.
* [tool:pytest] sections in *.cfg files passed by the
   -c option are now properly recognized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  2 09:07:52 UTC 2018 - chris@computersalat.de

- fix dependencies for attrs, pluggy, py, six

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 22 20:37:25 UTC 2018 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- update to 3.4.1
* Move import of doctest.UnexpectedException to top-level to avoid possible
  errors when using --pdb.
* Added printing of captured stdout/stderr before entering pdb, and improved a
  test which was giving false negatives about output capturing.
* Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures
  being created more than necessary.
* Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of "test run" hooks would
  cause an internal error.
* Detect arguments injected by unittest.mock.patch decorator correctly when
  pypi mock.patch is installed and imported.
* Errors shown when a pytest.raises() with match= fails are now cleaner
  on what happened: When no exception was raised, the "matching '...'" part got
  removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn't
  match. When a wrong exception was raised, it's now thrown
  instead of complaining about the unmatched text.
* Add Sphinx parameter docs for match and message args to pytest.raises
* Rename ParameterSet._for_parameterize() to _for_parametrize() in
    order to comply with the naming convention.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 10 17:59:11 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.4.0:
  * Deprecations and Removals
    + All pytest classes now subclass object for better Python 2/3
      compatibility. This should not affect user code except in very
      rare edge cases. (#2147)
  * Features
    + Introduce empty_parameter_set_mark ini option to select which
      mark to apply when @pytest.mark.parametrize is given an empty
      set of parameters. Valid options are skip (default) and
      xfail. Note that it is planned to change the default to xfail in
      future releases as this is considered less error prone. (#2527)
    + Incompatible change: after community feedback the logging
      functionality has undergone some changes. Please consult the
      logging documentation for details. (#3013)
    + Console output falls back to “classic” mode when capturing is
      disabled (-s), otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of
      being useless. (#3038)
    + New pytest_runtest_logfinish hook which is called when a test
      item has finished executing, analogous to
      pytest_runtest_logstart. (#3101)
    + Improve performance when collecting tests using many
      fixtures. (#3107)
    + New caplog.get_records(when) method which provides access to the
      captured records for the "setup", "call" and "teardown" testing
      stages. (#3117)
    + New fixture record_xml_attribute that allows modifying and
      inserting attributes on the <testcase> xml node in JUnit
      reports. (#3130)
    + The default cache directory has been renamed from .cache to
      .pytest_cache after community feedback that the name .cache did
      not make it clear that it was used by pytest. (#3138)
    + Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (#3142)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix hanging pexpect test on MacOS by using flush() instead of
      wait(). (#2022)
    + Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
      pytester plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
      pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global
      interpreter changes. (#3016)
    + Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before
      plugin setup hook. (#3074)
    + Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during
      teardown. (#3088)
    + Incompatible change: -o/--override option no longer eats all the
      remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for
      example, pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py would fail because
      /path/to/test.py would be considered as part of the -o
      command-line argument. One consequence of this is that now
      multiple configuration overrides need multiple -o flags: pytest
      -o foo=1 -o bar=2. (#3103)
  * Improved Documentation
    + Document hooks (defined with historic=True) which cannot be used
      with hookwrapper=True. (#2423)
    + Clarify that warning capturing doesn’t change the warning filter
      by default. (#2457)
    + Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup
      with fixture functions that return None. (#2698)
    + Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in
      pytest. (#3076)
    + Prefer https://*.readthedocs.io over http://*.rtfd.org for links
      in the documentation. (#3092)
    + Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide
      (#3131)
    + Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same
      process is not recommended because of import caching. (#3143)
  * Trivial/Internal Changes
    + Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a
      syntax error (for example, "-k foo and import" will show an
      error that you can not use the import keyword in
      expressions). (#2953)
    + Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the
      __name__ attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument
      name plus counter. (#2976)
    + Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (#3067)
    + Corrected ‘you’ to ‘your’ in logging docs. (#3129)

- update to version 3.3.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    + pytester: ignore files used to obtain current user metadata in
      the fd leak detector. (#2784)
    + Fix memory leak where objects returned by fixtures were never
      destructed by the garbage collector. (#2981)
    + Fix conversion of pyargs to filename to not convert symlinks and
      not use deprecated features on Python 3. (#2985)
    + PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE is now checked for plugins too rather than
      only for test modules. (#2995)
  * Improved Documentation
    + Add clarifying note about behavior of multiple parametrized
      arguments (#3001)
  * Trivial/Internal Changes

    + Clean up code by replacing imports and references of _ast to

    + Fix regression with warnings that contained non-strings in their
      arguments in Python 2. (#2956)
    + Always escape null bytes when setting
      PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST. (#2957)
    + Fix ZeroDivisionError when using the testmon plugin when no
      tests were actually collected. (#2971)
    + Bring back TerminalReporter.writer as an alias to
      TerminalReporter._tw. This alias was removed by accident in the
      3.3.0 release. (#2984)
    + The pytest-capturelog plugin is now also blacklisted, avoiding
      errors when running pytest with it still installed. (#3004)

Tue Nov 28 18:58:11 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * add requirement for attr and pluggy
  * add requirement for funcsigs for python2 only

- update to version 3.3.0:
  * Deprecations and Removals
    + Pytest no longer supports Python 2.6 and 3.3. Those Python
      versions are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and
      compatibility costs on the pytest core team, and following up
      with the rest of the community we decided that they will no
      longer be supported starting on this version. Users which still
      require those versions should pin pytest to <3.3. (#2812)
    + Remove internal _preloadplugins() function. This removal is part
      of the pytest_namespace() hook deprecation. (#2636)
    + Internally change CallSpec2 to have a list of marks instead of a
      broken mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute
      of the internal CallSpec2 class. (#2672)
    + Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api
      and the lack of the underscore was a naming error. (#2675)
    + Remove the internal multi-typed attribute Node._evalskip and
      replace it with the boolean Node._skipped_by_mark. (#2767)
  * Features
    + pytest_fixture_post_finalizer hook can now receive a request
      argument. (#2124)
    + Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines
      the available arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on
      Python 3 and funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect
      __signature__ declarations on functions. (#2267)
    + Report tests with global pytestmark variable only once. (#2549)
    + Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running
      tests. The previous output style can be set by configuring the
      console_output_style setting to classic. (#2657)
    + Match warns signature to raises by adding match keyword. (#2708)
    + Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard
      logging module. The user can control the logging level to be
      captured by specifying options in pytest.ini, the command line
      and also during individual tests using markers. Also, a caplog
      fixture is available that enables users to test the captured log
      during specific tests (similar to capsys for example). For more
      information, please see the logging docs. This feature was
      introduced by merging the popular pytest-catchlog plugin, thanks
      to Thomas Hisch. Be advised that during the merging the backward
      compatibility interface with the defunct pytest-capturelog has
      been dropped. (#2794)
    + Add allow_module_level kwarg to pytest.skip(), enabling to skip
      the whole module. (#2808)
    + Allow setting file_or_dir, -c, and -o in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (#2824)
    + Return stdout/stderr capture results as a namedtuple, so out and
      err can be accessed by attribute. (#2879)
    + Add capfdbinary, a version of capfd which returns bytes from
      readouterr(). (#2923)
    + Add capsysbinary a version of capsys which returns bytes from
      readouterr(). (#2934)
    + Implement feature to skip setup.py files when run with
      --doctest-modules. (#502)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Resume output capturing after capsys/capfd.disabled() context
      manager. (#1993)
    + pytest_fixture_setup and pytest_fixture_post_finalizer hooks are
      now called for all conftest.py files. (#2124)
    + If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer
      hides the original traceback. In python2 it will show the
      original traceback with a new message that explains in which
      plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized exceptions, the
      original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
      exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (#2491)
    + capsys and capfd can now be used by other fixtures. (#2709)
    + Internal pytester plugin properly encodes bytes arguments to
      utf-8. (#2738)
    + testdir now uses use the same method used by tmpdir to create
      its temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the
      testdir directory slightly, but should not affect usage in
      normal scenarios and avoids a number of potential
      problems. (#2751)
    + Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages
      being non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible
      messages. As a result of this, warnings with unicode messages
      are converted first to an ascii representation for
      safety. (#2809)
    + Change return value of pytest command when --maxfail is reached
      from 2 (interrupted) to 1 (failed). (#2845)
    + Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite
      modules which should not be rewritten. (#2939)
    + Handle marks without description in pytest.ini. (#2942)
  * Trivial/Internal Changes
    + pytest now depends on attrs for internal structures to ease code
      maintainability. (#2641)
    + Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use
      six. (#2642)
    + Stop vendoring pluggy - we’re missing out on its latest changes
      for not much benefit (#2719)
    + Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the
      backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3
      versions. (#2734)
    + Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (#2767)
    + Calls to Metafunc.addcall now emit a deprecation warning. This
      function is scheduled to be removed in pytest-4.0. (#2876)
    + Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more
      maintainable place. (#2877)
    + Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (#2910)
    + Configure pytest to prevent pip from installing pytest in
      unsupported Python versions. (#2922)

      source of the call. (#2681)
    - Allow tests declared as @staticmethod to use fixtures. (#2699)
    - Fixed edge-case during collection: attributes which raised
      pytest.fail when accessed would abort the entire collection.
      (#2707)
    - Fix ReprFuncArgs with mixed unicode and UTF-8 args. (#2731)
  * Improved Documentation
    - In examples on working with custom markers, add examples
      demonstrating the usage of pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args
      in comparison with pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.__call__ (#2604)
    - In one of the simple examples, use
      pytest_collection_modifyitems() to skip tests based on a
      command-line option, allowing its sharing while preventing a
      user error when acessing pytest.config before the argument
      parsing. (#2653)
  * Trivial/Internal Changes
    - Fixed minor error in 'Good Practices/Manual Integration' code
      snippet. (#2691)
    - Fixed typo in goodpractices.rst. (#2721)
    - Improve user guidance regarding --resultlog deprecation.
      (#2739)

- Replace sensationalist wording.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 25 10:01:40 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to 3.2.1, shortened changelogs:
 * Pytest 3.2.1 (2017-08-08)
  * Bug Fixes
   - Fixed small terminal glitch when collecting a single test item. (#2579)
   - Correctly consider / as the file separator to automatically mark plugin
  files for rewrite on Windows. (#2591)
   - Properly escape test names when setting PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST environment
  variable. (#2644)
   - Fix error on Windows and Python 3.6+ when sys.stdout has been replaced
  with a stream-like object which does not implement the full io module
  buffer protocol. In particular this affects pytest-xdist users on the
  aforementioned platform. (#2666)
  * Improved Documentation
   - Explicitly document which pytest features work with unittest. (#2626)
 * Pytest 3.2.0 (2017-07-30)
  * Deprecations and Removals
   - pytest.approx no longer supports >, >=, < and <=
  operators to avoid surprising/inconsistent behavior. See the docs
  <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/builtin.html#pytest.approx> for more
  information. (#2003)
   - All old-style specific behavior in current classes in the pytest's API is
  considered deprecated at this point and will be removed in a future release.
  This affects Python 2 users only and in rare situations. (#2147)
   - A deprecation warning is now raised when using marks for parameters
  in pytest.mark.parametrize. Use pytest.param to apply marks to
  parameters instead. (#2427)
  * Features
   - Add support for numpy arrays (and dicts) to approx. (#1994)
   - Now test function objects have a pytestmark attribute containing a list
  of marks applied directly to the test function, as opposed to marks inherited
  from parent classes or modules. (#2516)
   - Collection ignores local virtualenvs by default; `--collect-in-virtualenv`
  overrides this behavior. (#2518)
   - Allow class methods decorated as @staticmethod to be candidates for
  collection as a test function. (Only for Python 2.7 and above. Python 2.6
  will still ignore static methods.) (#2528)
   - Introduce mark.with_args in order to allow passing functions/classes as
  sole argument to marks. (#2540)
   - New cache_dir ini option: sets the directory where the contents of the
  cache plugin are stored. Directory may be relative or absolute path: if relative path, then
  directory is created relative to rootdir, otherwise it is used as is.
  Additionally path may contain environment variables which are expanded during
  runtime. (#2543)
   - Introduce the PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST environment variable that is set with
  the nodeid and stage (setup, call and teardown) of the test
  being currently executed. See the documentation
  <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html#pytest-current-test-
  environment-variable> for more info. (#2583)
   - Introduced @pytest.mark.filterwarnings mark which allows overwriting the
  warnings filter on a per test, class or module level. See the docs
  <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html#pytest-mark-
  filterwarnings> for more information. (#2598)
   - --last-failed now remembers forever when a test has failed and only
  forgets it if it passes again. This makes it easy to fix a test suite by
  selectively running files and fixing tests incrementally. (#2621)
   - New pytest_report_collectionfinish hook which allows plugins to add
  messages to the terminal reporting after collection has been finished
  successfully. (#2622)
   - Added support for PEP-415's <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0415/>
  Exception.__suppress_context__. Now if a raise exception from None is
  caught by pytest, pytest will no longer chain the context in the test report.
  The behavior now matches Python's traceback behavior. (#2631)
   - Exceptions raised by pytest.fail, pytest.skip and pytest.xfail
  now subclass BaseException, making them harder to be caught unintentionally
  by normal code. (#580)
  * Bug Fixes
   - Set stdin to a closed PIPE in pytester.py.Testdir.popen() for
  avoid unwanted interactive pdb (#2023)
   - Add missing encoding attribute to sys.std* streams when using
  capsys capture mode. (#2375)
   - Fix terminal color changing to black on Windows if colorama is imported
  in a conftest.py file. (#2510)
   - Fix line number when reporting summary of skipped tests. (#2548)
   - capture: ensure that EncodedFile.name is a string. (#2555)
   - The options --fixtures and --fixtures-per-test will now keep
  indentation within docstrings. (#2574)
   - doctests line numbers are now reported correctly, fixing pytest-sugar#122
  <https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar/issues/122>. (#2610)
   - Fix non-determinism in order of fixture collection. Adds new dependency
  (ordereddict) for Python 2.6. (#920)
  * Improved Documentation
   - Clarify pytest_configure hook call order. (#2539)
   - Extend documentation for testing plugin code with the pytester plugin.
  (#971)
 * Pytest 3.1.3 (2017-07-03)
  * Bug Fixes
   - Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (#2434)
   - Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (#2440)
   - Fix incorrect "collected items" report when specifying tests on the command-
  line. (#2464)
   - deprecated_call in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, deprecated_call
  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (#2469)
   - Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading /
  characters. (#2475)
   - Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
  (#2486)
  * Improved Documentation
   - Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
  result. (#2493)
 * Pytest 3.1.2 (2017-06-08)
  * Bug Fixes
   - Required options added via pytest_addoption will no longer prevent using
  --help without passing them. (#1999)
   - Respect python_files in assertion rewriting. (#2121)
   - Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
     that can't be compared (like numpy arrays). (#2459)
   - UnicodeWarning is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
     when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (#2463)
   - Added a workaround for Python 3.6 WindowsConsoleIO breaking due to Pytests's
     FDCapture. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
     very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. colorama.
     (#2467)
  * Improved Documentation
   - Fix internal API links to pluggy objects. (#2331)
   - Make it clear that pytest.xfail stops test execution at the calling point
  and improve overall flow of the skipping docs. (#810)
 * Pytest 3.1.1 (2017-05-30)
  * Bug Fixes
   - pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
     previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
     suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
     side-effect of this is that DeprecationWarning and
     PendingDeprecationWarning are no longer shown by default. (#2430)
   - Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (#2434)
   - Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (#2436)
   - pytest.deprecated_call now captures PendingDeprecationWarning in
  context manager form. (#2441)
  * Improved Documentation
   - Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (#2390)
 * 3.1.0 (2017-05-22)
  * New Features
   * The pytest-warnings plugin has been integrated into the core and now pytest automatically
     captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.
     .. warning::
       This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be
       disabled in your pytest.ini:
       .. code-block:: ini
         [pytest]
         addopts = -p no:warnings
       See the warnings documentation page <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html> for more
       information.
     Thanks @nicoddemus for the PR.
   * Added junit_suite_name ini option to specify root <testsuite> name for JUnit XML reports (#533).
   * Added an ini option doctest_encoding to specify which encoding to use for doctest files.
     Thanks @wheerd for the PR (#2101).
   * pytest.warns now checks for subclass relationship rather than
     class equality. Thanks @lesteve for the PR (#2166)
   * pytest.raises now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex
     with the match keyword argument. Thanks @Kriechi for the PR.
   * pytest.param can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids.
     Thanks @RonnyPfannschmidt for the PR.
  * Changes
   * remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,
     this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0
     Thanks to @RonnyPfannschmidt for the PR.
   * pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks @fogo for the PR.
   * It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a
     __test__ attribute to False in the class body (#2007). Thanks
     to @syre for the report and @lwm for the PR.
   * Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.
     If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown
     we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other
     the failure. (#2228) Thanks to @kkoukiou for the PR.
   * Testcase reports with a url attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.
     Thanks @fushi for the PR (#1874).
   * Remove common items from dict comparision output when verbosity=1. Also update
     the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all
     assertion messages if verbosity < 2 (#1512).
     Thanks @mattduck for the PR
   * --pdbcls no longer implies --pdb. This makes it possible to use
     addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass on pytest.ini. Thanks @davidszotten for
     the PR (#1952).
   * fix #2013: turn RecordedWarning into namedtuple,
     to give it a comprehensible repr while preventing unwarranted modification.
   * fix #2208: ensure a iteration limit for _pytest.compat.get_real_func.
     Thanks @RonnyPfannschmidt for the report and PR.
   * Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This
     makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the
     pytest_plugins special variable (#1821).
     Thanks @nicoddemus for the PR.
   * Modify pytest_make_parametrize_id() hook to accept argname as an
     additional parameter.
     Thanks @unsignedint for the PR.
   * Add venv to the default norecursedirs setting.
     Thanks @The-Compiler for the PR.
   * PluginManager.import_plugin now accepts unicode plugin names in Python 2.
     Thanks @reutsharabani for the PR.
   * fix #2308: When using both --lf and --ff, only the last failed tests are run.
     Thanks @ojii for the PR.
   * Replace minor/patch level version numbers in the documentation with placeholders.
     This significantly reduces change-noise as different contributors regnerate
     the documentation on different platforms.
     Thanks @RonnyPfannschmidt for the PR.
   * fix #2391: consider pytest_plugins on all plugin modules
     Thanks @RonnyPfannschmidt for the PR.
  * Bug Fixes
   * Fix AttributeError on sys.stdout.buffer / sys.stderr.buffer
     while using capsys fixture in python 3. (#1407).
     Thanks to @asottile.
   * Change capture.py's DontReadFromInput class to throw io.UnsupportedOperation errors rather
     than ValueErrors in the fileno method (#2276).
     Thanks @metasyn and @vlad-dragos for the PR.
   * Fix exception formatting while importing modules when the exception message
     contains non-ascii characters (#2336).
     Thanks @fabioz for the report and @nicoddemus for the PR.
   * Added documentation related to issue (#1937)
     Thanks @skylarjhdownes for the PR.
   * Allow collecting files with any file extension as Python modules (#2369).
     Thanks @Kodiologist for the PR.
   * Show the correct error message when collect "parametrize" func with wrong args (#2383).
     Thanks @The-Compiler for the report and @robin0371 for the PR.

- skip creating a python3 symlink when only python2.x is being built

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 30 09:29:28 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version  3.0.7
  * Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules
    silently discarding other modules when importing fails
    Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed.
    (`#2248`_). Thanks `@pfhayes`_ for the PR.
  * junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag
    occured twice per testcase element in the XML report.
    Thanks `@kkoukiou`_ for the PR.
  * Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run
    with ``--pdb`` (`#2137`_). Thanks to `@gst`_ for the report
    and `@mbyt`_ for the PR.
  * Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g.
    properties) during Python test collection (`#2234`_).
    Thanks to `@bluetech`_.
  * ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some
    fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`#2238`_).
    Thanks `@sirex`_ for the report and `@nicoddemus`_ for the
    PR.
  * Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by
    simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to
    `PEP-479`_ (`#2160`_). Thanks `@tgoodlet`_ for the report
    and `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
  * Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError``
    is raised inside a test. Thanks `@omerhadari`_ for the PR.
  * Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated
    by custom collectors (`#2231`_).  Thanks to `@vidartf`_.
  * Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file
    presented (`#2281`_). Thanks `@fbjorn`_ for the PR.
  * Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the
    underlying test item being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``,
    and can therefore apply to tests not collected by the
    built-in python test collector. Thanks `@barneygale`_ for
    the PR.

- update to version 3.0.2
  * Improve error message when passing non-string ids to ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` (`#1857`_).
    Thanks `@okken`_ for the report and `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
  * Add ``buffer`` attribute to stdin stub class ``pytest.capture.DontReadFromInput``
    Thanks `@joguSD`_ for the PR.
  * Fix ``UnicodeEncodeError`` when string comparison with unicode has failed. (`#1864`_)
    Thanks `@AiOO`_ for the PR.
  * ``pytest_plugins`` is now handled correctly if defined as a string (as opposed as
    a sequence of strings) when modules are considered for assertion rewriting.
    Due to this bug, much more modules were being rewritten than necessary
    if a test suite uses ``pytest_plugins`` to load internal plugins (`#1888`_).
    Thanks `@jaraco`_ for the report and `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR (`#1891`_).
  * Do not call tearDown and cleanups when running tests from
    ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses with ``--pdb``
    enabled. This allows proper post mortem debugging for all applications
    which have significant logic in their tearDown machinery (`#1890`_). Thanks
    `@mbyt`_ for the PR.
  * Fix use of deprecated ``getfuncargvalue`` method in the internal doctest plugin.
    Thanks `@ViviCoder`_ for the report (`#1898`_).
- update to version 3.0.1
  * Fix regression when ``importorskip`` is used at module level (`#1822`_).
    Thanks `@jaraco`_ and `@The-Compiler`_ for the report and `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
  * Fix parametrization scope when session fixtures are used in conjunction
    with normal parameters in the same call (`#1832`_).
    Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the report, `@Kingdread`_ and `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
  * Fix internal error when parametrizing tests or fixtures using an empty ``ids`` argument (`#1849`_).
    Thanks `@OPpuolitaival`_ for the report and `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
  * Fix loader error when running ``pytest`` embedded in a zipfile.
    Thanks `@mbachry`_ for the PR.
- update to version 3.0.0
  + Incompatible changes
    * Reinterpretation mode has now been removed.  Only plain and rewrite
      mode are available, consequently the ``--assert=reinterp`` option is
      no longer available.  Thanks `@flub`_ for the PR.
    * The following deprecated commandline options were removed:
    * ``--genscript``: no longer supported;
      > ``--no-assert``: use ``--assert=plain`` instead;
      > ``--nomagic``: use ``--assert=plain`` instead;
      > ``--report``: use ``-r`` instead;
    * ImportErrors in plugins now are a fatal error instead of issuing a
      pytest warning (`#1479`_). Thanks to `@The-Compiler`_ for the PR.
    * Removed support code for Python 3 versions < 3.3 (`#1627`_).
    * Removed all ``py.test-X*`` entry points. The versioned, suffixed entry points
      were never documented and a leftover from a pre-virtualenv era. These entry
      points also created broken entry points in wheels, so removing them also
      removes a source of confusion for users (`#1632`_).
      Thanks `@obestwalter`_ for the PR.
    * ``pytest.skip()`` now raises an error when used to decorate a test function,
      as opposed to its original intent (to imperatively skip a test inside a test function). Previously
      this usage would cause the entire module to be skipped (`#607`_).
      Thanks `@omarkohl`_ for the complete PR (`#1519`_).
    * Exit tests if a collection error occurs. A poll indicated most users will hit CTRL-C
      anyway as soon as they see collection errors, so pytest might as well make that the default behavior (`#1421`_).
      A ``--continue-on-collection-errors`` option has been added to restore the previous behaviour.
      Thanks `@olegpidsadnyi`_ and `@omarkohl`_ for the complete PR (`#1628`_).
    * Renamed the pytest ``pdb`` module (plugin) into ``debugging`` to avoid clashes with the builtin ``pdb`` module.
    * Raise a helpful failure message when requesting a parametrized fixture at runtime,
      e.g. with ``request.getfixturevalue``. Previously these parameters were simply
      never defined, so a fixture decorated like ``@pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1, 2])``
      only ran once (`#460`_).
      Thanks to `@nikratio`_ for the bug report, `@RedBeardCode`_ and `@tomviner`_ for the PR.
    * ``_pytest.monkeypatch.monkeypatch`` class has been renamed to ``_pytest.monkeypatch.MonkeyPatch``
      so it doesn't conflict with the ``monkeypatch`` fixture.
    * ``--exitfirst / -x`` can now be overridden by a following ``--maxfail=N``
      and is just a synonym for ``--maxfail=1``.
    + New Features
    * Support nose-style ``__test__`` attribute on methods of classes,
      including unittest-style Classes. If set to ``False``, the test will not be
      collected.
    * New ``doctest_namespace`` fixture for injecting names into the
      namespace in which doctests run.
      Thanks `@milliams`_ for the complete PR (`#1428`_).
    * New ``--doctest-report`` option available to change the output format of diffs
      when running (failing) doctests (implements `#1749`_).
      Thanks `@hartym`_ for the PR.
    * New ``name`` argument to ``pytest.fixture`` decorator which allows a custom name
      for a fixture (to solve the funcarg-shadowing-fixture problem).
      Thanks `@novas0x2a`_ for the complete PR (`#1444`_).
    * New ``approx()`` function for easily comparing floating-point numbers in
      tests.
      Thanks `@kalekundert`_ for the complete PR (`#1441`_).
    * Ability to add global properties in the final xunit output file by accessing
      the internal ``junitxml`` plugin (experimental).
      Thanks `@tareqalayan`_ for the complete PR `#1454`_).
    * New ``ExceptionInfo.match()`` method to match a regular expression on the
      string representation of an exception (`#372`_).
      Thanks `@omarkohl`_ for the complete PR (`#1502`_).
    * ``__tracebackhide__`` can now also be set to a callable which then can decide
      whether to filter the traceback based on the ``ExceptionInfo`` object passed
      to it. Thanks `@The-Compiler`_ for the complete PR (`#1526`_).
    * New ``pytest_make_parametrize_id(config, val)`` hook which can be used by plugins to provide
      friendly strings for custom types.
      Thanks `@palaviv`_ for the PR.
    * ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` now have a ``disabled()`` context-manager method, which
      can be used to temporarily disable capture within a test.
      Thanks `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
    * New cli flag ``--fixtures-per-test``: shows which fixtures are being used
      for each selected test item. Features doc strings of fixtures by default.
      Can also show where fixtures are defined if combined with ``-v``.
      Thanks `@hackebrot`_ for the PR.
    * Introduce ``pytest`` command as recommended entry point. Note that ``py.test``
      still works and is not scheduled for removal. Closes proposal
      `#1629`_. Thanks `@obestwalter`_ and `@davehunt`_ for the complete PR
      (`#1633`_).
    * New cli flags:
      > ``--setup-plan``: performs normal collection and reports
          the potential setup and teardown and does not execute any fixtures and tests;
      > ``--setup-only``: performs normal collection, executes setup and teardown of
        fixtures and reports them;
      > ``--setup-show``: performs normal test execution and additionally shows
          setup and teardown of fixtures;
      > ``--keep-duplicates``: py.test now ignores duplicated paths given in the command
        line. To retain the previous behavior where the same test could be run multiple
        times by specifying it in the command-line multiple times, pass the ``--keep-duplicates``
        argument (`#1609`_);
    Thanks `@d6e`_, `@kvas-it`_, `@sallner`_, `@ioggstream`_ and `@omarkohl`_ for the PRs.
    * New CLI flag ``--override-ini``/``-o``: overrides values from the ini file.
      For example: ``"-o xfail_strict=True"``'.
      Thanks `@blueyed`_ and `@fengxx`_ for the PR.
    * New hooks:
      > ``pytest_fixture_setup(fixturedef, request)``: executes fixture setup;
      > ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer(fixturedef)``: called after the fixture's
        finalizer and has access to the fixture's result cache.
    Thanks `@d6e`_, `@sallner`_.
    * Issue warnings for asserts whose test is a tuple literal. Such asserts will
      never fail because tuples are always truthy and are usually a mistake
      (see `#1562`_). Thanks `@kvas-it`_, for the PR.
    * Allow passing a custom debugger class (e.g. ``--pdbcls=IPython.core.debugger:Pdb``).
      Thanks to `@anntzer`_ for the PR.
  + Changes
    * Plugins now benefit from assertion rewriting.  Thanks
      `@sober7`_, `@nicoddemus`_ and `@flub`_ for the PR.
    * Change ``report.outcome`` for ``xpassed`` tests to ``"passed"`` in non-strict
      mode and ``"failed"`` in strict mode. Thanks to `@hackebrot`_ for the PR
      (`#1795`_) and `@gprasad84`_ for report (`#1546`_).
    * Tests marked with ``xfail(strict=False)`` (the default) now appear in
      JUnitXML reports as passing tests instead of skipped.
      Thanks to `@hackebrot`_ for the PR (`#1795`_).
    * Highlight path of the file location in the error report to make it easier to copy/paste.
      Thanks `@suzaku`_ for the PR (`#1778`_).
    * Fixtures marked with ``@pytest.fixture`` can now use ``yield`` statements exactly like
      those marked with the ``@pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator. This change renders
      ``@pytest.yield_fixture`` deprecated and makes ``@pytest.fixture`` with ``yield`` statements
      the preferred way to write teardown code (`#1461`_).
      Thanks `@csaftoiu`_ for bringing this to attention and `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
    * Explicitly passed parametrize ids do not get escaped to ascii (`#1351`_).
      Thanks `@ceridwen`_ for the PR.
    * Fixtures are now sorted in the error message displayed when an unknown
      fixture is declared in a test function.
      Thanks `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
    * ``pytest_terminal_summary`` hook now receives the ``exitstatus``
      of the test session as argument. Thanks `@blueyed`_ for the PR (`#1809`_).
    * Parametrize ids can accept ``None`` as specific test id, in which case the
      automatically generated id for that argument will be used.
      Thanks `@palaviv`_ for the complete PR (`#1468`_).
    * The parameter to xunit-style setup/teardown methods (``setup_method``,
      ``setup_module``, etc.) is now optional and may be omitted.
      Thanks `@okken`_ for bringing this to attention and `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
    * Improved automatic id generation selection in case of duplicate ids in
      parametrize.
      Thanks `@palaviv`_ for the complete PR (`#1474`_).
    * Now pytest warnings summary is shown up by default. Added a new flag
      ``--disable-pytest-warnings`` to explicitly disable the warnings summary (`#1668`_).
    * Make ImportError during collection more explicit by reminding
      the user to check the name of the test module/package(s) (`#1426`_).
      Thanks `@omarkohl`_ for the complete PR (`#1520`_).
    * Add ``build/`` and ``dist/`` to the default ``--norecursedirs`` list. Thanks
      `@mikofski`_ for the report and `@tomviner`_ for the PR (`#1544`_).
    * ``pytest.raises`` in the context manager form accepts a custom
      ``message`` to raise when no exception occurred.
      Thanks `@palaviv`_ for the complete PR (`#1616`_).
    * ``conftest.py`` files now benefit from assertion rewriting; previously it
      was only available for test modules. Thanks `@flub`_, `@sober7`_ and
      `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR (`#1619`_).
    * Text documents without any doctests no longer appear as "skipped".
      Thanks `@graingert`_ for reporting and providing a full PR (`#1580`_).
    * Ensure that a module within a namespace package can be found when it
      is specified on the command line together with the ``--pyargs``
      option.  Thanks to `@taschini`_ for the PR (`#1597`_).
    * Always include full assertion explanation during assertion rewriting. The previous behaviour was hiding
      sub-expressions that happened to be ``False``, assuming this was redundant information.
      Thanks `@bagerard`_ for reporting (`#1503`_). Thanks to `@davehunt`_ and
      `@tomviner`_ for the PR.
    * ``OptionGroup.addoption()`` now checks if option names were already
      added before, to make it easier to track down issues like `#1618`_.
      Before, you only got exceptions later from ``argparse`` library,
      giving no clue about the actual reason for double-added options.
    * ``yield``-based tests are considered deprecated and will be removed in pytest-4.0.
      Thanks `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
    * ``[pytest]`` sections in ``setup.cfg`` files should now be named ``[tool:pytest]``
      to avoid conflicts with other distutils commands (see `#567`_). ``[pytest]`` sections in
      ``pytest.ini`` or ``tox.ini`` files are supported and unchanged.
      Thanks `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
    * Using ``pytest_funcarg__`` prefix to declare fixtures is considered deprecated and will be
      removed in pytest-4.0 (`#1684`_).
      Thanks `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
    * Passing a command-line string to ``pytest.main()`` is considered deprecated and scheduled
      for removal in pytest-4.0. It is recommended to pass a list of arguments instead (`#1723`_).
    * Rename ``getfuncargvalue`` to ``getfixturevalue``. ``getfuncargvalue`` is
      still present but is now considered deprecated. Thanks to `@RedBeardCode`_ and `@tomviner`_
      for the PR (`#1626`_).
    * ``optparse`` type usage now triggers DeprecationWarnings (`#1740`_).
    * ``optparse`` backward compatibility supports float/complex types (`#457`_).
    * Refined logic for determining the ``rootdir``, considering only valid
      paths which fixes a number of issues: `#1594`_, `#1435`_ and `#1471`_.
      Updated the documentation according to current behavior. Thanks to
      `@blueyed`_, `@davehunt`_ and `@matthiasha`_ for the PR.
    * Always include full assertion explanation. The previous behaviour was hiding
      sub-expressions that happened to be False, assuming this was redundant information.
      Thanks `@bagerard`_ for reporting (`#1503`_). Thanks to `@davehunt`_ and
      `@tomviner`_ for PR.
    * Better message in case of not using parametrized variable (see `#1539`_).
      Thanks to `@tramwaj29`_ for the PR.
    * Updated docstrings with a more uniform style.
    * Add stderr write for ``pytest.exit(msg)`` during startup. Previously the message was never shown.
      Thanks `@BeyondEvil`_ for reporting `#1210`_. Thanks to `@JonathonSonesen`_ and
      `@tomviner`_ for the PR.
    * No longer display the incorrect test deselection reason (`#1372`_).
      Thanks `@ronnypfannschmidt`_ for the PR.
    * The ``--resultlog`` command line option has been deprecated: it is little used
      and there are more modern and better alternatives (see `#830`_).
      Thanks `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
    * Improve error message with fixture lookup errors: add an 'E' to the first
      line and '>' to the rest. Fixes `#717`_. Thanks `@blueyed`_ for reporting and
      a PR, `@eolo999`_ for the initial PR and `@tomviner`_ for his guidance during
      EuroPython2016 sprint.
  + Bug Fixes
    * Parametrize now correctly handles duplicated test ids.
    * Fix internal error issue when the ``method`` argument is missing for
      ``teardown_method()`` (`#1605`_).
    * Fix exception visualization in case the current working directory (CWD) gets
      deleted during testing (`#1235`_). Thanks `@bukzor`_ for reporting. PR by
      `@marscher`_.

      Thanks `@DRMacIver`_ for reporting and `@RedBeardCode`_ for the PR.
    * Create correct diff for strings ending with newlines (`#1553`_).
      Thanks `@Vogtinator`_ for reporting and `@RedBeardCode`_ and
      `@tomviner`_ for the PR.
    * ``ConftestImportFailure`` now shows the traceback making it easier to
      identify bugs in ``conftest.py`` files (`#1516`_). Thanks `@txomon`_ for
      the PR.
    * Text documents without any doctests no longer appear as "skipped".
      Thanks `@graingert`_ for reporting and providing a full PR (`#1580`_).
    * Fixed collection of classes with custom ``__new__`` method.
      Fixes `#1579`_. Thanks to `@Stranger6667`_ for the PR.

      Thanks to `@Stranger6667`_ for the PR.
    * Fixed the total tests tally in junit xml output (`#1798`_).
      Thanks to `@cryporchild`_ for the PR.
    * Fixed off-by-one error with lines from ``request.node.warn``.
      Thanks to `@blueyed`_ for the PR.

- update to version 2.9.1:
  * Improve error message when a plugin fails to load. Thanks
    @nicoddemus for the PR.
  * Fix (#1178): pytest.fail with non-ascii characters raises an
    internal pytest error. Thanks @nicoddemus for the PR.
  * Fix (#469): junit parses report.nodeid incorrectly, when params
    IDs contain ::. Thanks @tomviner for the PR (#1431).

    parameterize attempt to decode it as utf-8 ignoring errors.
  * Fix (#649): parametrized test nodes cannot be specified to run on
    the command line.
- update to version 2.9.0:
  * New Features
    + New pytest.mark.skip mark, which unconditionally skips marked
      tests. Thanks @MichaelAquilina for the complete PR (#1040).
    + --doctest-glob may now be passed multiple times in the
      command-line. Thanks @jab and @nicoddemus for the PR.
    + New -rp and -rP reporting options give the summary and full
      output of passing tests, respectively. Thanks to @codewarrior0 for
      the PR.
    + pytest.mark.xfail now has a strict option which makes XPASS
      tests to fail the test suite, defaulting to False. There’s also a
      xfail_strict ini option that can be used to configure it
      project-wise. Thanks @rabbbit for the request and @nicoddemus for
      the PR (#1355).
    + Parser.addini now supports options of type bool. Thanks
      @nicoddemus for the PR.
    + New ALLOW_BYTES doctest option strips b prefixes from byte
      strings in doctest output (similar to ALLOW_UNICODE). Thanks
      @jaraco for the request and @nicoddemus for the PR (#1287).
    + give a hint on KeyboardInterrupt to use the –fulltrace option to
      show the errors, this fixes #1366. Thanks to @hpk42 for the report
      and @RonnyPfannschmidt for the PR.
    + catch IndexError exceptions when getting exception source
      location. This fixes pytest internal error for dynamically
      generated code (fixtures and tests) where source lines are fake by
      intention
  * Changes
    + Important: py.code has been merged into the pytest repository as
      pytest._code. This decision was made because py.code had very few
      uses outside pytest and the fact that it was in a different
      repository made it difficult to fix bugs on its code in a timely
      manner. The team hopes with this to be able to better refactor out
      and improve that code. This change shouldn’t affect users, but it
      is useful to let users aware if they encounter any strange
      behavior.
    + Keep in mind that the code for pytest._code is private and
      experimental, so you definitely should not import it explicitly!
    + Please note that the original py.code is still available in
      pylib.
    + pytest_enter_pdb now optionally receives the pytest config
      object. Thanks @nicoddemus for the PR.
    + Removed code and documentation for Python 2.5 or lower versions,
      including removal of the obsolete _pytest.assertion.oldinterpret
      module. Thanks @nicoddemus for the PR (#1226).
    + Comparisons now always show up in full when CI or BUILD_NUMBER
      is found in the environment, even when -vv isn’t used. Thanks
      @The-Compiler for the PR.
    + --lf and --ff now support long names: --last-failed and
      --failed-first respectively. Thanks @MichaelAquilina for the PR.
    + Added expected exceptions to pytest.raises fail message
    + Collection only displays progress (“collecting X items”) when in
      a terminal. This avoids cluttering the output when using
      --color=yes to obtain colors in CI integrations systems (#1397).
  * Bug Fixes
    + The -s and -c options should now work under xdist;
      Config.fromdictargs now represents its input much more
      faithfully. Thanks to @bukzor for the complete PR (#680).
    + Fix (#1290): support Python 3.5’s @ operator in assertion
      rewriting. Thanks @Shinkenjoe for report with test case and
      @tomviner for the PR.
    + Fix formatting utf-8 explanation messages (#1379). Thanks @biern
      for the PR.
    + Fix traceback style docs to describe all of the available
      options (auto/long/short/line/native/no), with auto being the
      default since v2.6. Thanks @hackebrot for the PR.
    + Fix (#1422): junit record_xml_property doesn’t allow multiple
      records with same name.
- update to version 2.8.7:
  * fix #1338: use predictable object resolution for monkeypatch

    regression failing plugins combinations like pytest-pep8 +
    pytest-flakes

    call raises an ImportError.
  * fix #1292: monkeypatch calls (setattr, setenv, etc.) are now
    O(1). Thanks David R. MacIver for the report and Bruno Oliveira
    for the PR.
  * fix #1223: captured stdout and stderr are now properly displayed
    before entering pdb when --pdb is used instead of being thrown
    away. Thanks Cal Leeming for the PR.

    are now properly displayed. Thanks Ionel Maries Cristian for the
    report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

    unicode. Thanks Jason R. Coombs for the report and Bruno Oliveira
    for the PR.

    collection could break pytest.
    fix #1074: precompute junitxml chunks instead of storing the
    whole tree in objects
    fix #1238: fix pytest.deprecated_call() receiving multiple
    arguments (Regression introduced in 2.8.4).
- update to version 2.8.4:
  * fix #1190: deprecated_call() now works when the deprecated
    function has been already called by another test in the same
    module. Thanks Mikhail Chernykh for the report and Bruno Oliveira
    for the PR.
  * fix #1198: --pastebin option now works on Python 3. Thanks Mehdy
    Khoshnoody for the PR.
  * fix #1219: --pastebin now works correctly when captured output
    contains non-ascii characters. Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  * fix #1204: another error when collecting with a nasty
    __getattr__(). Thanks Florian Bruhin for the PR.
  * fix the summary printed when no tests did run. Thanks Florian
    Bruhin for the PR.
  * a number of documentation modernizations wrt good
    practices. Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
- update to version 2.8.3:
  * fix #1169: add __name__ attribute to testcases in TestCaseFunction
    to support the @unittest.skip decorator on functions and methods.
    Thanks Lee Kamentsky for the PR.
  * fix #1035: collecting tests if test module level obj has
    __getattr__().  Thanks Suor for the report and Bruno Oliveira /
    Tom Viner for the PR.
  * fix #331: don't collect tests if their failure cannot be reported
    correctly e.g. they are a callable instance of a class.
  * fix #1133: fixed internal error when filtering tracebacks where
    one entry belongs to a file which is no longer available.  Thanks
    Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  * enhancement made to highlight in red the name of the failing tests
    so they stand out in the output.  Thanks Gabriel Reis for the PR.
  * add more talks to the documentation
  * extend documentation on the --ignore cli option
  * use pytest-runner for setuptools integration
  * minor fixes for interaction with OS X El Capitan system integrity
    protection (thanks Florian)
- Update to 2.8.2:
  - fix #1085: proper handling of encoding errors when passing encoded byte
    strings to pytest.parametrize in Python 2.
    Thanks Themanwithoutaplan for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix #1087: handling SystemError when passing empty byte strings to
    pytest.parametrize in Python 3.
    Thanks Paul Kehrer for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix #995: fixed internal error when filtering tracebacks where one entry
    was generated by an exec() statement.
    Thanks Daniel Hahler, Ashley C Straw, Philippe Gauthier and Pavel Savchenko
    for contributing and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
- Update to 2.8.1
  - fix #1034: Add missing nodeid on pytest_logwarning call in
    addhook.  Thanks Simon Gomizelj for the PR.
  - 'deprecated_call' is now only satisfied with a DeprecationWarning or
    PendingDeprecationWarning. Before 2.8.0, it accepted any warning, and 2.8.0
    made it accept only DeprecationWarning (but not PendingDeprecationWarning).
    Thanks Alex Gaynor for the issue and Eric Hunsberger for the PR.
  - fix issue #1073: avoid calling __getattr__ on potential plugin objects.
    This fixes an incompatibility with pytest-django.  Thanks Andreas Pelme,
    Bruno Oliveira and Ronny Pfannschmidt for contributing and Holger Krekel
    for the fix.
  - Fix issue #704: handle versionconflict during plugin loading more
    gracefully.  Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - Fix issue #1064: ""--junitxml" regression when used with the
    "pytest-xdist" plugin, with test reports being assigned to the wrong tests.
    Thanks Daniel Grunwald for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - (experimental) adapt more SEMVER style versioning and change meaning of
    master branch in git repo: "master" branch now keeps the bugfixes, changes
    aimed for micro releases.  "features" branch will only be be released
    with minor or major pytest releases.
  - Fix issue #766 by removing documentation references to distutils.
    Thanks Russel Winder.
  - Fix issue #1030: now byte-strings are escaped to produce item node ids
    to make them always serializable.
    Thanks Andy Freeland for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - Python 2: if unicode parametrized values are convertible to ascii, their
    ascii representation is used for the node id.
  - Fix issue #411: Add __eq__ method to assertion comparison example.
    Thanks Ben Webb.
  - fix issue 877: properly handle assertion explanations with non-ascii repr
    Thanks Mathieu Agopian for the report and Ronny Pfannschmidt for the PR.
  - fix issue 1029: transform errors when writing cache values into pytest-warnings
- Update to 2.8.0
  - new ``--lf`` and ``-ff`` options to run only the last failing tests or
    "failing tests first" from the last run.  This functionality is provided
    through porting the formerly external pytest-cache plugin into pytest core.
    BACKWARD INCOMPAT: if you used pytest-cache's functionality to persist
    data between test runs be aware that we don't serialize sets anymore.
    Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt for most of the merging work.
  - "-r" option now accepts "a" to include all possible reports, similar
    to passing "fEsxXw" explicitly (isse960).
    Thanks Abhijeet Kasurde for the PR.
  - avoid python3.5 deprecation warnings by introducing version
    specific inspection helpers, thanks Michael Droettboom.
  - fix issue562: @nose.tools.istest now fully respected.
  - fix issue934: when string comparison fails and a diff is too large to display
    without passing -vv, still show a few lines of the diff.
    Thanks Florian Bruhin for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue736: Fix a bug where fixture params would be discarded when combined
    with parametrization markers.
    Thanks to Markus Unterwaditzer for the PR.
  - fix issue710: introduce ALLOW_UNICODE doctest option: when enabled, the
    ``u`` prefix is stripped from unicode strings in expected doctest output. This
    allows doctests which use unicode to run in Python 2 and 3 unchanged.
    Thanks Jason R. Coombs for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - parametrize now also generates meaningful test IDs for enum, regex and class
    objects (as opposed to class instances).
    Thanks to Florian Bruhin for the PR.
  - Add 'warns' to assert that warnings are thrown (like 'raises').
    Thanks to Eric Hunsberger for the PR.
  - Fix issue683: Do not apply an already applied mark.  Thanks ojake for the PR.
  - Deal with capturing failures better so fewer exceptions get lost to
    /dev/null.  Thanks David Szotten for the PR.
  - fix issue730: deprecate and warn about the --genscript option.
    Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt for the report and Christian Pommranz for the PR.
  - fix issue751: multiple parametrize with ids bug if it parametrizes class with
    two or more test methods. Thanks Sergey Chipiga for reporting and Jan
    Bednarik for PR.
  - fix issue82: avoid loading conftest files from setup.cfg/pytest.ini/tox.ini
    files and upwards by default (--confcutdir can still be set to override this).
    Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue768: docstrings found in python modules were not setting up session
    fixtures. Thanks Jason R. Coombs for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - added `tmpdir_factory`, a session-scoped fixture that can be used to create
    directories under the base temporary directory. Previously this object was
    installed as a `_tmpdirhandler` attribute of the `config` object, but now it
    is part of the official API and using `config._tmpdirhandler` is
    deprecated.
    Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue808: pytest's internal assertion rewrite hook now implements the
    optional PEP302 get_data API so tests can access data files next to them.
    Thanks xmo-odoo for request and example and Bruno Oliveira for
    the PR.
  - rootdir and inifile are now displayed during usage errors to help
    users diagnose problems such as unexpected ini files which add
    unknown options being picked up by pytest. Thanks to Pavel Savchenko for
    bringing the problem to attention in #821 and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - Summary bar now is colored yellow for warning
    situations such as: all tests either were skipped or xpass/xfailed,
    or no tests were run at all (this is a partial fix for issue500).
  - fix issue812: pytest now exits with status code 5 in situations where no
    tests were run at all, such as the directory given in the command line does
    not contain any tests or as result of a command line option filters
    all out all tests (-k for example).
    Thanks Eric Siegerman (issue812) and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - Summary bar now is colored yellow for warning
    situations such as: all tests either were skipped or xpass/xfailed,
    or no tests were run at all (related to issue500).
    Thanks Eric Siegerman.
  - New `testpaths` ini option: list of directories to search for tests
    when executing pytest from the root directory. This can be used
    to speed up test collection when a project has well specified directories
    for tests, being usually more practical than configuring norecursedirs for
    all directories that do not contain tests.
    Thanks to Adrian for idea (#694) and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue713: JUnit XML reports for doctest failures.
    Thanks Punyashloka Biswal.
  - fix issue970: internal pytest warnings now appear as "pytest-warnings" in
    the terminal instead of "warnings", so it is clear for users that those
    warnings are from pytest and not from the builtin "warnings" module.
    Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - Include setup and teardown in junitxml test durations.
    Thanks Janne Vanhala.
  - fix issue735: assertion failures on debug versions of Python 3.4+
  - new option ``--import-mode`` to allow to change test module importing
    behaviour to append to sys.path instead of prepending.  This better allows
    to run test modules against installated versions of a package even if the
    package under test has the same import root.  In this example::
          testing/__init__.py
          testing/test_pkg_under_test.py
          pkg_under_test/
    the tests will run against the installed version
    of pkg_under_test when ``--import-mode=append`` is used whereas
    by default they would always pick up the local version.  Thanks Holger Krekel.
  - pytester: add method ``TmpTestdir.delete_loaded_modules()``, and call it
    from ``inline_run()`` to allow temporary modules to be reloaded.
    Thanks Eduardo Schettino.
  - internally refactor pluginmanager API and code so that there
    is a clear distinction between a pytest-agnostic rather simple
    pluginmanager and the PytestPluginManager which adds a lot of
    behaviour, among it handling of the local conftest files.
    In terms of documented methods this is a backward compatible
    change but it might still break 3rd party plugins which relied on
    details like especially the pluginmanager.add_shutdown() API.
    Thanks Holger Krekel.
  - pluginmanagement: introduce ``pytest.hookimpl`` and
    ``pytest.hookspec`` decorators for setting impl/spec
    specific parameters.  This substitutes the previous
    now deprecated use of ``pytest.mark`` which is meant to
    contain markers for test functions only.
  - write/refine docs for "writing plugins" which now have their
    own page and are separate from the "using/installing plugins`` page.
  - fix issue732: properly unregister plugins from any hook calling
    sites allowing to have temporary plugins during test execution.
  - deprecate and warn about ``__multicall__`` argument in hook
    implementations.  Use the ``hookwrapper`` mechanism instead already
    introduced with pytest-2.7.
  - speed up pytest's own test suite considerably by using inprocess
    tests by default (testrun can be modified with --runpytest=subprocess
    to create subprocesses in many places instead).  The main
    APIs to run pytest in a test is "runpytest()" or "runpytest_subprocess"
    and "runpytest_inprocess" if you need a particular way of running
    the test.  In all cases you get back a RunResult but the inprocess
    one will also have a "reprec" attribute with the recorded events/reports.
  - fix monkeypatch.setattr("x.y", raising=False) to actually not raise
    if "y" is not a pre-existing attribute. Thanks Florian Bruhin.
  - fix issue741: make running output from testdir.run copy/pasteable
    Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - add a new ``--noconftest`` argument which ignores all ``conftest.py`` files.
  - add ``file`` and ``line`` attributes to JUnit-XML output.
  - fix issue890: changed extension of all documentation files from ``txt`` to
    ``rst``. Thanks to Abhijeet for the PR.
  - fix issue714: add ability to apply indirect=True parameter on particular argnames.
    Thanks Elizaveta239.
  - fix issue890: changed extension of all documentation files from ``txt`` to
    ``rst``. Thanks to Abhijeet for the PR.
  - fix issue957: "# doctest: SKIP" option will now register doctests as SKIPPED
    rather than PASSED.
    Thanks Thomas Grainger for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - issue951: add new record_xml_property fixture, that supports logging
    additional information on xml output. Thanks David Diaz for the PR.
  - issue949: paths after normal options (for example `-s`, `-v`, etc) are now
    properly used to discover `rootdir` and `ini` files.
    Thanks Peter Lauri for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
- Update to 2.7.3 (compared to 2.7.2)
  - Allow 'dev', 'rc', or other non-integer version strings in `importorskip`.
    Thanks to Eric Hunsberger for the PR.
  - fix issue856: consider --color parameter in all outputs (for example
    --fixtures). Thanks Barney Gale for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue855: passing str objects as `plugins` argument to pytest.main
    is now interpreted as a module name to be imported and registered as a
    plugin, instead of silently having no effect.
    Thanks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue744: fix for ast.Call changes in Python 3.5+.  Thanks
    Guido van Rossum, Matthias Bussonnier, Stefan Zimmermann and
    Thomas Kluyver.
  - fix issue842: applying markers in classes no longer propagate this markers
    to superclasses which also have markers.
    Thanks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - preserve warning functions after call to pytest.deprecated_call. Thanks
    Pieter Mulder for PR.
  - fix issue854: autouse yield_fixtures defined as class members of
    unittest.TestCase subclasses now work as expected.
    Thannks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue833: --fixtures now shows all fixtures of collected test files, instead of just the
    fixtures declared on the first one.
    Thanks Florian Bruhin for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue863: skipped tests now report the correct reason when a skip/xfail
    condition is met when using multiple markers.
    Thanks Raphael Pierzina for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - optimized tmpdir fixture initialization, which should make test sessions
    faster (specially when using pytest-xdist). The only visible effect
    is that now pytest uses a subdirectory in the $TEMP directory for all
    directories created by this fixture (defaults to $TEMP/pytest-$USER).
    Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
- Update to 2.7.2
  - fix issue767: pytest.raises value attribute does not contain the exception
    instance on Python 2.6. Thanks Eric Siegerman for providing the test
    case and Bruno Oliveira for PR.
  - Automatically create directory for junitxml and results log.
    Thanks Aron Curzon.
  - fix issue713: JUnit XML reports for doctest failures.
    Thanks Punyashloka Biswal.
  - fix issue735: assertion failures on debug versions of Python 3.4+
    Thanks Benjamin Peterson.
  - fix issue114: skipif marker reports to internal skipping plugin;
    Thanks Floris Bruynooghe for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue748: unittest.SkipTest reports to internal pytest unittest plugin.
    Thanks Thomas De Schampheleire for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue718: failed to create representation of sets containing unsortable
    elements in python 2. Thanks Edison Gustavo Muenz.
  - fix issue756, fix issue752 (and similar issues): depend on py-1.4.29
    which has a refined algorithm for traceback generation.
- Move %check to -doc subpackage to avoid dependency loop
  with new python3-hypothesis test dependency.

- Update to version 2.7.1:
  * fix issue731: do not get confused by the braces which may be
    present and unbalanced in an object's repr while collapsing
    False explanations.  Thanks Carl Meyer for the report and test
    case.
  * fix issue553: properly handling inspect.getsourcelines
    failures in FixtureLookupError which would lead to to an
    internal error, obfuscating the original problem. Thanks
    talljosh for initial diagnose/patch and Bruno Oliveira for
    final patch.
  * fix issue660: properly report scope-mismatch-access errors
    independently from ordering of fixture arguments.  Also
    avoid the pytest internal traceback which does not provide
    information to the user. Thanks Holger Krekel.
  * streamlined and documented release process.  Also all
    versions (in setup.py and documentation generation) are now
    read from _pytest/__init__.py. Thanks Holger Krekel.
  * fixed docs to remove the notion that yield-fixtures are
    experimental. They are here to stay :)  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  * Support building wheels by using environment markers for the
    requirements.  Thanks Ionel Maries Cristian.
  * fixed regression to 2.6.4 which surfaced e.g. in lost stdout
    capture printing when tests raised SystemExit. Thanks
    Holger Krekel.
  * reintroduced _pytest fixture of the pytester plugin which
    is used at least by pytest-xdist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  5 05:51:50 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 2.7.0:
  - fix issue435: make reload() work when assert rewriting is active.
    Thanks Daniel Hahler.
  - fix issue616: conftest.py files and their contained fixutres are now
    properly considered for visibility, independently from the exact
    current working directory and test arguments that are used.
    Many thanks to Eric Siegerman and his PR235 which contains
    systematic tests for conftest visibility and now passes.
    This change also introduces the concept of a ``rootdir`` which
    is printed as a new pytest header and documented in the pytest
    customize web page.
  - change reporting of "diverted" tests, i.e. tests that are collected
    in one file but actually come from another (e.g. when tests in a test class
    come from a base class in a different file).  We now show the nodeid
    and indicate via a postfix the other file.
  - add ability to set command line options by environment
    variable PYTEST_ADDOPTS.
  - added documentation on the new pytest-dev teams on bitbucket and
    github.  See https://pytest.org/latest/contributing.html .
    Thanks to Anatoly for pushing and initial work on this.
  - fix issue650: new option ``--docttest-ignore-import-errors`` which
    will turn import errors in doctests into skips.  Thanks Charles Cloud
    for the complete PR.
  - fix issue655: work around different ways that cause python2/3
    to leak sys.exc_info into fixtures/tests causing failures in 3rd party code
  - fix issue615: assertion re-writing did not correctly escape % signs
    when formatting boolean operations, which tripped over mixing
    booleans with modulo operators.  Thanks to Tom Viner for the report,
    triaging and fix.
  - implement issue351: add ability to specify parametrize ids as a callable
    to generate custom test ids.  Thanks Brianna Laugher for the idea and
    implementation.
  - introduce and document new hookwrapper mechanism useful for plugins
    which want to wrap the execution of certain hooks for their purposes.
    This supersedes the undocumented ``__multicall__`` protocol which
    pytest itself and some external plugins use.  Note that pytest-2.8
    is scheduled to drop supporting the old ``__multicall__``
    and only support the hookwrapper protocol.
  - majorly speed up invocation of plugin hooks
  - use hookwrapper mechanism in builtin pytest plugins.
  - add a doctest ini option for doctest flags, thanks Holger Peters.
  - add note to docs that if you want to mark a parameter and the
    parameter is a callable, you also need to pass in a reason to disambiguate
    it from the "decorator" case.  Thanks Tom Viner.
  - "python_classes" and "python_functions" options now support glob-patterns
   for test discovery, as discussed in issue600. Thanks Ldiary Translations.
  - allow to override parametrized fixtures with non-parametrized ones and
    vice ver  sa (bubenkoff).
  - fix issue463: raise specific error for 'parameterize' misspelling
    (pfctdayelise  ).
  - On failure, the ``sys.last_value``, ``sys.last_type`` and
    ``sys.last_traceback`` are set, so that a user can inspect the error
    via postmortem debugging (almarklein).
- Bump Requires/BuildRequires for python-py

- Add optional dependencies for testsuite as BuildRequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 13:48:01 UTC 2015 - mcihar@suse.cz

- Update to 2.6.4:
  - Improve assertion failure reporting on iterables, by using ndiff and pprint.
  - removed outdated japanese docs from source tree.
  - docs for "pytest_addhooks" hook.  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - updated plugin index docs.  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - fix issue557: with "-k" we only allow the old style "-" for negation
    at the beginning of strings and even that is deprecated.  Use "not" instead.
    This should allow to pick parametrized tests where "-" appeared in the parameter.
  - fix issue604: Escape % character in the assertion message.
  - fix issue620: add explanation in the --genscript target about what
    the binary blob means. Thanks Dinu Gherman.
  - fix issue614: fixed pastebin support.

- Update to 2.6.3
  - No longer show line numbers in the –verbose output, the output
    is now purely the nodeid. The line number is still shown in
    failure reports. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.
  - fix issue437 where assertion rewriting could cause pytest-xdist
    slaves to collect different tests.
    Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - fix issue555: add “errors” attribute to capture-streams to
    satisfy some distutils and possibly other code accessing sys.stdout.errors.
  - fix issue547 capsys/capfd also work when output capturing (“-s”)
    is disabled.
  - address issue170: allow pytest.mark.xfail(...) to specify expected
    exceptions via an optional “raises=EXC” argument where EXC can be
    a single exception or a tuple of exception classes.
    Thanks David Mohr for the complete PR.
  - fix integration of pytest with unittest.mock.patch decorator when
    it uses the “new” argument.
    Thanks Nicolas Delaby for test and PR.
  - fix issue with detecting conftest files if the arguments contain
    ”::” node id specifications (copy pasted from “-v” output)
  - fix issue544 by only removing “@NUM” at the end of ”::” separated
    parts and if the part has an ”.py” extension  don’t use py.std
    import helper, rather import things directly.
    Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

Wed Jul 30 07:38:02 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 2.6.0
  - Cache exceptions from fixtures according to their scope (issue 467).
  - fix issue537: Avoid importing old assertion reinterpretation code by default.
  - fix issue364: shorten and enhance tracebacks representation by default.
    The new "--tb=auto" option (default) will only display long tracebacks
    for the first and last entry.  You can get the old behaviour of printing
    all entries as long entries with "--tb=long".  Also short entries by
    default are now printed very similarly to "--tb=native" ones.
  - fix issue514: teach assertion reinterpretation about private class attributes
  - change -v output to include full node IDs of tests.  Users can copy
    a node ID from a test run, including line number, and use it as a
    positional argument in order to run only a single test.
  - fix issue 475: fail early and comprehensible if calling
    pytest.raises with wrong exception type.
  - fix issue516: tell in getting-started about current dependencies.
  - cleanup setup.py a bit and specify supported versions. Thanks Jurko
    Gospodnetic for the PR.
  - change XPASS colour to yellow rather then red when tests are run
    with -v.
  - fix issue473: work around mock putting an unbound method into a class
    dict when double-patching.
  - fix issue498: if a fixture finalizer fails, make sure that
    the fixture is still invalidated.
  - fix issue453: the result of the pytest_assertrepr_compare hook now gets
    it's newlines escaped so that format_exception does not blow up.
  - internal new warning system: pytest will now produce warnings when
    it detects oddities in your test collection or execution.
    Warnings are ultimately sent to a new pytest_logwarning hook which is
    currently only implemented by the terminal plugin which displays
    warnings in the summary line and shows more details when -rw (report on
    warnings) is specified.
  - change skips into warnings for test classes with an __init__ and
    callables in test modules which look like a test but are not functions.
  - fix issue436: improved finding of initial conftest files from command
    line arguments by using the result of parse_known_args rather than
    the previous flaky heuristics.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for tests
    and initial fixing approaches in this area.
  - fix issue #479: properly handle nose/unittest(2) SkipTest exceptions
    during collection/loading of test modules.  Thanks to Marc Schlaich
    for the complete PR.
  - fix issue490: include pytest_load_initial_conftests in documentation
    and improve docstring.
  - fix issue472: clarify that ``pytest.config.getvalue()`` cannot work
    if it's triggered ahead of command line parsing.
  - merge PR123: improved integration with mock.patch decorator on tests.
  - fix issue412: messing with stdout/stderr FD-level streams is now
    captured without crashes.
  - fix issue483: trial/py33 works now properly.  Thanks Daniel Grana for PR.
  - improve example for pytest integration with "python setup.py test"
    which now has a generic "-a" or "--pytest-args" option where you
    can pass additional options as a quoted string.  Thanks Trevor Bekolay.
  - simplified internal capturing mechanism and made it more robust
    against tests or setups changing FD1/FD2, also better integrated
    now with pytest.pdb() in single tests.
  - improvements to pytest's own test-suite leakage detection, courtesy of PRs
    from Marc Abramowitz
  - fix issue492: avoid leak in test_writeorg.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.
  - fix issue493: don't run tests in doc directory with ``python setup.py test``
    (use tox -e doctesting for that)
  - fix issue486: better reporting and handling of early conftest loading failures
  - some cleanup and simplification of internal conftest handling.
  - work a bit harder to break reference cycles when catching exceptions.
    Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic.
  - fix issue443: fix skip examples to use proper comparison.  Thanks Alex
    Groenholm.
  - support nose-style ``__test__`` attribute on modules, classes and
    functions, including unittest-style Classes.  If set to False, the
    test will not be collected.
  - fix issue512: show "<notset>" for arguments which might not be set
    in monkeypatch plugin.  Improves output in documentation.

- Update to version 2.5.2:
  - fix issue409 -- better interoperate with cx_freeze by not
    trying to import from collections.abc which causes problems
    for py27/cx_freeze.  Thanks Wolfgang L. for reporting and tracking it down.
  - fixed docs and code to use "pytest" instead of "py.test" almost everywhere.
    Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic for the complete PR.
  - fix issue425: mention at end of "py.test -h" that --markers
    and --fixtures work according to specified test path (or current dir)
  - fix issue413: exceptions with unicode attributes are now printed
    correctly also on python2 and with pytest-xdist runs. (the fix
    requires py-1.4.20)
  - copy, cleanup and integrate py.io capture
    from pylib 1.4.20.dev2 (rev 13d9af95547e)
  - address issue416: clarify docs as to conftest.py loading semantics
  - fix issue429: comparing byte strings with non-ascii chars in assert
    expressions now work better.  Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  3 08:43:16 UTC 2014 - mvyskocil@suse.com

- Update to 2.5.1:
  + merge new documentation styling PR from Tobias Bieniek.
  + fix issue403: allow parametrize of multiple same-name functions within
    a collection node.
  + Allow parameterized fixtures to specify the ID of the parameters by
    adding an ids argument to pytest.fixture() and pytest.yield_fixture().
  + fix issue404 by always using the binary xml escape in the junitxml
    plugin.
  + fix issue407: fix addoption docstring to point to argparse instead of
    optparse.
  * 2.5.0:
  + dropped python2.5 from automated release testing of pytest itself
    which means it's probably going to break soon
  + simplified and fixed implementation for calling finalizers when
    parametrized fixtures or function arguments are involved.  finalization
    is now performed lazily at setup time instead of in the "teardown phase".
  + PR90: add --color=yes|no|auto option to force terminal coloring
    mode ("auto" is default).
  + fix issue319 - correctly show unicode in assertion errors. Also means
    we depend on py>=1.4.19 now.
  + fix issue396 - correctly sort and finalize class-scoped parametrized
    tests independently from number of methods on the class.
  + refix issue323 in a better way -- parametrization should now never
    cause Runtime Recursion errors because the underlying algorithm
    for re-ordering tests per-scope/per-fixture is not recursive
    anymore
  + fix issue290 - there is preliminary support now for parametrizing
    with repeated same values (sometimes useful to to test if calling
    a second time works as with the first time).
  + close issue240 - document precisely how pytest module importing
    works, discuss the two common test directory layouts, and how it
    interacts with PEP420-namespace packages.
  + fix issue246 fix finalizer order to be LIFO on independent fixtures
    depending on a parametrized higher-than-function scoped fixture.
    (was quite some effort so please bear with the complexity of
    this sentence :)
  + fix issue244 by implementing special index for parameters to only use
    indices for paramentrized test ids
  + fix issue287 by running all finalizers but saving the exception
    from the first failing finalizer and re-raising it so teardown will
    still have failed.  We reraise the first failing exception because
    it might be the cause for other finalizers to fail.
  + fix ordering when mock.patch or other standard decorator-wrappings
    are used with test methods.  This fixues issue346 and should
    help with random "xdist" collection failures.  Thanks to
    Ronny Pfannschmidt and Donald Stufft for helping to isolate it.
  + and many more, see CHANGELOG for details

  + issue250 unicode/str mixes in parametrization names and values now works
  + issue257, assertion-triggered compilation of source ending in a

  + fix --genscript option to generate standalone scripts that also
    work with python3.3 (importer ordering)
  + issue171 - in assertion rewriting, show the repr of some
    global variables
  + fix option help for "-k"
  + move long description of distribution into README.rst
  + improve docstring for metafunc.parametrize()
  + fix bug where using capsys with pytest.set_trace() in a test
    function would break when looking at capsys.readouterr()
  + allow to specify prefixes starting with "_" when
    customizing python_functions test discovery. (thanks Graham Horler)
  + improve PYTEST_DEBUG tracing output by puting
    extra data on a new lines with additional indent
  + ensure OutcomeExceptions like skip/fail have initialized exception attributes
  + issue 260 - don't use nose special setup on plain unittest cases
  + fix issue134 - print the collect errors that prevent running specified test items
