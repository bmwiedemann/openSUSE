      - rt.cpan.org 107567: edges() missing on undirected multiedged graph:
        was broken in 0.96, had been fixed somewhere there and here,
        added the test case
      - rt.cpan.org 107600: no modify Storable $VERSION

      - document (at user level) the openbsd random problem
      - using the 5.22+ Inf was done the wrong way:

      - rt.cpan.org 107394 $Storable::VERSION may contain underscores
      - follow-up to rt.cpan.org 104687: more docs, fixes, and tests for
        diameter/radius/shortest_path/center_vertices/vertex_eccentricity
        for corner cases like empty graph, single-vertex graphs, and
        in general unconnected graphs
      - for perl 5.22 or later one should be able to use Inf for Infinity
      - openbsd before perl 5.20 had nondeterministic rand()

      * Address rt.cpan.org #85449:
        "Graph-0.94 tests fail under perl 5.18.0"

      * Address rt.cpan.org #82324:
        "Test failures due to hash randomisation in perl 5.17.6"

      The two above fixes were the same: the biconnectedness
      code was rewritten from scratch.  The new code behaves
      differently (but I believe more correctly) on certain
      edge cases, in general it will generate more biconnected
      components and bridges, for example for "a=b=c" it will
      now return the same two biconnected components and bridges
      (cut edges), namely "a=b" and "b=c", the "b" of course being
      the articulation point (cut vertex).

      * Address rt.cpan.org #67213:
        "[PATCH] pod fixes"

      * Remove the t/u_bo.t and t/u_bo1.t since they die in 5.18 due
        to some strange failure, looks unrelated to Graph as such,
        probably some fix/change made by newer Perls. 

      * Release as 0.95.
