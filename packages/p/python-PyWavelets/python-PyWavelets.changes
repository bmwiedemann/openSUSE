- Update to version 1.0.3
  PyWavelets 1.0.3 is functionally equivalent to the 1.0.2 release.
  It was made to archive the JOSS paper about PyWavelets to the
  1.0.x branch and serve as a reference corresponding to the
  version that was peer reviewed.

- Update to version 1.0.2:
  PyWavelets 1.0.2 is a bug-fix and maintenance release with no
  new features compared to 1.0.1.
  * Bugs Fixed
    - A bug in iswtn when using some combinations of
      user-specified axes was fixed.
    - A potential error related to coefficient shape mismatch
      during WaveletPacket or WaveletPacket2D reconstruction was
      fixed.
  * Other Changes
    - A deprecated import of Iterable was fixed.
    - The spelling of "Garrote" was fixed in the wavelet
      thresholding documentation. For backwards compatibility
      with 1.0.0, the incorrect ("garotte") spelling is also
      accepted for the mode parameter of pywt.threshold.
    - The spelling of "supported" was fixed in one of the
      ValueError messages that can be returned by pywt.cwt.
    - Cython language compatibility has been pinned to
      language_level = '2'. This is in contrast to the master
      branch which is now using language_level = '3'. To support
      this, the minimum supported Cython version has been raised
      to 0.23.5.

- Update to version 1.0.1
  * Key-based assignment of coefficients to a ``FswavedecnResult`` object (i.e. via
    its __setitem__ method) has been fixed.
  * The order that the individual subband coefficients were stacked by the
    function ``pywt.ravel_coeffs`` is now guaranteed to be consistent across all
    supported Python versions. Explicit alphabetic ordering of subband coefficient
    names is used for consitent ordering regardless of Python version
- Update to version 1.0.0
  + New features
    * New 1D test signals
    * C99 complex support
    * complex-valued CWT
    * More flexible specification of some continuous wavelets
    * Fully Separable Discrete Wavelet Transfrom
    * New thresholding methods
    * New anti-symmetric boundary modes
    * New functions to ravel and unravel wavedecn coefficients
    * New functions to determine multilevel DWT coefficient shapes and sizes
  + Deprecated features
    * The continous wavelets with names ``"cmor"``, ``"shan"`` and ``"fbsp"``
      should now be modified to include formerly hard-coded attributes such as their
      center frequency and bandwidth. Use of the bare names "cmor". "shan" and
      "fbsp"  is now deprecated. For "cmor" (and "shan"), the form of the wavelet
      name is now "cmorB-C" ("shanB-C") where B and C are floats representing the
      bandwidth frequency and center frequency. For "fbsp" the form should now
      incorporate three floats as in "fbspM-B-C" where M is the spline order and B
      and C are the bandwidth and center frequencies.
  + Backwards incompatible changes
    * Python 2.6, 3.3 and 3.4 are no longer supported.
    * The order of coefficients returned by ``swt2`` and input to ``iswt2`` have been
      reversed so that the decomposition levels are now returned in descending rather
      than ascending order. This makes these 2D stationary wavelet functions
      consistent with all of the other multilevel discrete transforms in PyWavelets.
    * For ``wavedec``, ``wavedec2`` and ``wavedecn``, the ability for the user to
      specify a ``level`` that is greater than the value returned by
      ``dwt_max_level``  has been restored. A ``UserWarning`` is raised instead of a
      ``ValueError`` in this case.
  + Bugs Fixed
    * Assigning new data to the ``Node`` or ``Node2D`` no longer forces a cast to
      ``float64`` when the data is one of the other dtypes supported by the dwt
      (``float32``, ``complex64``, ``complex128``).
    * Calling ``pywt.threshold`` with ``mode='soft'`` now works properly for
      complex-valued inputs.
    * A segfault when running multiple `swt2` or `swtn` transforms concurrently has
      been fixed.
    * Several instances of deprecated numpy multi-indexing that caused warnings in
      numpy >=1.15 have been resolved.
    * The 2d inverse stationary wavelet transform, `iswt2`, now supports non-square
      inputs (an unnecessary check for square inputs was removed).
    * Wavelet packets no longer convert float32 to float64 upon assignment to nodes.
    * Doctests have been updated to also work with NumPy >= 1.14,
    * Indexing conventions have been updated to avoid FutureWarnings in NumPy 1.15.
  + Other changes
    * Python 3.7 is now officially supported.
