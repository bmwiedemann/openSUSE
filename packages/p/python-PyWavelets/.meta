  <title>PyWavelets is a Python wavelet transforms module</title>
  <description>PyWavelets is a Python wavelet transforms module that can do:

  * 1D and 2D Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT and IDWT)
  * 1D and 2D Stationary Wavelet Transform (Undecimated Wavelet Transform)
  * 1D and 2D Wavelet Packet decomposition and reconstruction
  * Computing Approximations of wavelet and scaling functions
  * Over seventy built-in wavelet filters and support for custom wavelets
  * Single and double precision calculations
  * Results compatibility with Matlab Wavelet Toolbox</description>
