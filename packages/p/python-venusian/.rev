    <comment>- Update to version 1.1.0
  *  Updated to using py.test instead of nosetest, and added
     support for Python 3.4 -&gt; 3.6
  *  Make scanning more resilient of metaclasses that return
     proxies for any attribute access.
  *  Fix bug where using the same venusian decorator on both a
     class and its methods would cause the method decorations to be
     ignored. See https://github.com/Pylons/venusian/issues/40
  *  Drop support for Python 2.6.
  *  Drop support for Python 3.2: it is no longer supported by
     current packaging / CI tools.
  *  Support loaders that require the module name as argument to
     their get_filename() method. This fixes problems with zipped
     packages on Python 3.
  *  Micro-optimization when ignores are used (see
     https://github.com/Pylons/venusian/pull/20).
  *  A tox run now combines coverage between Py2 and Py3.
- Split docs and tests into separate package to make the
  latter work
- Converted to single-spec
- update to version 1.0
  - Fix an issue under PyPy &gt; 2.0 where attached decorators may not be found.
  - Drop support of Python 2.4 / 2.5 / Jython.
  - Add lift and onlyliftedfrom class decorators to allow for inheritance of
    venusian decorators attached to superclass methods. See the API
    documentation for more information.
  - Fix bug where otherwise undecorated subclass of a superclass that had
    venusian decorators on it would inherit its superclass' decorations.
    Venusian decorators should have never been inherited implicitly. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/venusian/issues/11#issuecomment-4977352
- license update: SUSE-Repoze
  See LICENSE
- Use tarball from pypi.python.org/ as source
- Change license to get it SPDX compliant;
  In general, python packages are licensed under BSD derived; the
  most closed license is BSD-2-Clause
- Simplify macro usage
- version 1.0a8: initial release
- Clean up SPEC file
- Enable tests and make docs work again
- singlespec auto-conversion
