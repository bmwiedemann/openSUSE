  <title>comma-separated values manipulator (using XS or PurePerl)</title>
  <description>Text::CSV provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of
comma-separated values using the Text::CSV_XS manpage or its pure Perl
version.

An instance of the Text::CSV class can combine fields into a CSV string and
parse a CSV string into fields.

The module accepts either strings or files as input and can utilize any
user-specified characters as delimiters, separators, and escapes so it is
perhaps better called ASV (anything separated values) rather than just CSV.</description>
