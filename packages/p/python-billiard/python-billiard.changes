Wed Nov 13 16:56:40 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.3.0.6
  + Now works without C extension again.
  + New ``_billiard.read(fd, buffer, [len, ])` function
    implements os.read with buffer support (new buffer API)
  + New pure-python implementation of ``Connection.send_offset``.
- Changes from 3.3.0.5
  + All platforms except for Windows/PyPy/Jython now requires the C extension.
- Changes from 3.3.0.4
  + Fixed problem with Python3 and setblocking.
- Changes from 3.3.0.3
  + Now works on Windows again.
- Changes from 3.3.0.2
  + ApplyResult.terminate() may be set to signify that the job
    must not be executed.  It can be used in combination with
    Pool.terminate_job.
  + Pipe/_SimpleQueue: Now supports rnonblock/wnonblock arguments
    to set the read or write end of the pipe to be nonblocking.
  + Pool: Log message included exception info but exception happened
    in another process so the resulting traceback was wrong.
  + Pool: Worker process can now prepare results before they are sent
    back to the main process (using ``Worker.prepare_result``).
- Changes from 3.3.0.1
  + Pool: New ``correlation_id`` argument to ``apply_async`` can be
    used to set a related id for the ``ApplyResult`` object returned:
      >>> r = pool.apply_async(target, args, kwargs, correlation_id='foo')
      >>> r.correlation_id
      'foo'
  + Pool: New callback `on_process_exit` is called when a pool
    process exits, with signature ``(pid, exitcode)``.
  + Pool: Improved the too many restarts detection.
- Changes from 3.3.0.0
  + Dual code base now runs on Python 2.6+ and Python 3.
  + No longer compatible with Python 2.5
  + Includes many changes from multiprocessing in 3.4.
  + Now uses ``time.monotonic`` when available, also including
    fallback implementations for Linux and OS X.
  + No longer cleans up after receiving SIGILL, SIGSEGV or SIGFPE
  + ``Finalize`` and ``register_after_fork`` is now aliases to multiprocessing.
    It's better to import these from multiprocessing directly now
    so that there aren't multiple registries.
  + New `billiard.queues._SimpleQueue` that does not use semaphores.
  + Pool: Can now be extended to support using multiple IPC queues.
  + Pool: Can now use async I/O to write to pool IPC queues.
  + Pool: New ``Worker.on_loop_stop`` handler can be used to add actions
    at pool worker process shutdown.
    Note that, like all finalization handlers, there is no guarantee that
    this will be executed.

Fri Mar 22 16:17:18 UTC 2013 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.7.3.23:
  - Windows: Now catches SystemExit from setuptools while trying to
    build the C extension (Issue #41).
- Aditional changes from 2.7.3.22:
  - Pool: apply_async now supports a callbacks_propagate keyword
    argument that can be a tuple of exceptions to propagate in
    callbacks. (callback, errback, accept_callback, timeout_callback).
  - Errors are no longer logged for OK and recycle exit codes.
    This would cause normal maxtasksperchild recycled process
    to log an error.
  - Fixed Python 2.5 compatibility problem (Issue #33).
  - FreeBSD: Compilation now disables semaphores if Python was built
    without it (Issue #40).
    Contributed by William Grzybowski

    Fix contributed by xentac.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 25 21:10:36 UTC 2013 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 2.7.3.19:
  * Fixes problem at shutdown when gc has collected symbols.
  * Pool now always uses _kill for Py2.5 compatibility on Windows (Issue
    #32).
  * Fixes Python 3 compatibility issues

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 13 20:56:40 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 2.7.3.18:
  * [Pool] Fix for check_timeouts if not set.
      Fix contributed by Dmitry Sukhov
  * Fixed pickle problem with Traceback.
      Code.frame.__loader__ is now ignored as it may be set to an unpickleable
      object.
  * The Django old-layout warning was always showing.
2.7.3.17 - 2012-09-26
  * Fixes typo
2.7.3.16 - 2012-09-26
  * Windows: Fixes for SemLock._rebuild (Issue #24).
  * Pool: Job terminated with terminate_job now raises
    billiard.exceptions.Terminated.
2.7.3.15 - 2012-09-21
  * Windows: Fixes unpickling of SemLock when using fallback.
  * Windows: Fixes installation when no C compiler.
2.7.3.14 - 2012-09-20
  * Installation now works again for Python 3.
2.7.3.13 - 2012-09-14
  * Merged with Python trunk (many authors, many fixes: see Python changelog
    in trunk).
  * Using execv now also works with older Django projects using setup_environ
    (Issue #10).
  * Billiard now installs with a warning that the C extension could not be
    built if a compiler is not installed or the build fails in some other way.
      It really is recommended to have the C extension installed when running
      with force execv, but this change also makes it easier to install.
  * Pool: Hard timeouts now sends KILL shortly after TERM so that C extensions
    cannot block the signal.
      Python signal handlers are called in the interpreter, so they cannot be
      called while a C extension is blocking the interpreter from running.
  * Now uses a timeout value for Thread.join that doesn't exceed the maximum
    on some platforms.
  * Fixed bug in the SemLock fallback used when C extensions not installed.
      Fix contributed by Mher Movsisyan.
  * Pool: Now sets a Process.index attribute for every process in the pool.
      This number will always be between 0 and concurrency-1, and can be used
      to e.g. create a logfile for each process in the pool without creating a
      new logfile whenever a process is replaced.
2.7.3.12 - 2012-08-05
  * Fixed Python 2.5 compatibility issue.
  * New Pool.terminate_job(pid) to terminate a job without raising
    WorkerLostError
2.7.3.11 - 2012-08-01
  * Adds support for FreeBSD 7+
      Fix contributed by koobs.
  * Pool: New argument allow_restart is now required to enable the pool
    process sentinel that is required to restart the pool.
      It's disabled by default, which reduces the number of file descriptors/
      semaphores required to run the pool.
  * Pool: Now emits a warning if a worker process exited with error-code.
      But not if the error code is 155, which is now returned if the worker
      process was recycled (maxtasksperchild).
  * Python 3 compatibility fixes.
  * Python 2.5 compatibility fixes.
2.7.3.10 - 2012-06-26
  * The TimeLimitExceeded exception string representation only included the
    seconds as a number, it now gives a more human friendly description.
  * Fixed typo in LaxBoundedSemaphore.shrink.
  * Pool: ResultHandler.handle_event no longer requires any arguments.
  * setup.py bdist now works
2.7.3.9 - 2012-06-03
  * Environment variable MP_MAIN_FILE envvar is now set to the path of the
    __main__ module when execv is enabled.
  * Pool: Errors occurring in the TaskHandler are now reported.
2.7.3.8 - 2012-06-01
  * Can now be installed on Py 3.2
  * Issue #12091: simplify ApplyResult and MapResult with threading.Event
      Patch by Charles-Francois Natali
  * Pool: Support running without TimeoutHandler thread.
    * The with_*_thread arguments has also been replaced with a single
      threads=True argument.
    * Two new pool callbacks:
      * on_timeout_set(job, soft, hard)
          Applied when a task is executed with a timeout.
      * on_timeout_cancel(job)
          Applied when a timeout is cancelled (the job completed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 23 22:17:05 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 2.7.3.7
  * Fixes Python 2.5 support.
- 2.7.3.6 - 2012-05-21
  * Pool: Can now be used in an event loop, without starting the supporting
    threads (TimeoutHandler still not supported)
  * Pool: Process too frequent restart protection now only counts if the
    process had a non-successful exitcode.
  * Pool: New options max_restart + max_restart_freq
  * Pool: The ``WorkerLostError`` message now includes the exitcode of the
    process that disappeared.
- Build HTML docs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 17 23:40:18 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 2.7.3.5
  * Now always cleans up after sys.exc_info() to avoid cyclic references.
  * ExceptionInfo without arguments now defaults to sys.exc_info.
  * Forking can now be disabled using the MULTIPROCESSING_FORKING_DISABLE
    environment variable.
      Also this envvar is set so that the behavior is inherited after execv.
  * The semaphore cleanup process started when execv is used now sets a useful
    process name if the setproctitle module is installed.
  * Sets the FORKED_BY_MULTIPROCESSING environment variable if forking is
    disabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 27 22:54:35 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 2.7.3.4
  * Added billiard.ensure_multiprocessing() - Raises NotImplementedError if
    the platform does not support multiprocessing (e.g. Jython).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 25 19:09:15 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Generate new spec
- Update to 2.7.3.3
  * PyPy now falls back to using its internal _multiprocessing module, so
    everything works except for forking_enable(False) (which silently degrades)
  * Fixed Python 2.5 compat issues.
  * Uses more with statements
  * Merged some of the changes from the Python 3 branch.
- 2.7.3.2 - 2012-04-20
  * Now installs on PyPy/Jython (but does not work).
- 2.7.3.1 - 2012-04-20
  * Python 2.5 support added.
- 2.7.3.0 - 2012-04-20
  * Updated from Python 2.7.3
  * Python 2.4 support removed, now only supports 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7. (may
    consider py3k support at some point).
  * Pool improvments from Celery.
  * no-execv patch added (http://bugs.python.org/issue8713)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 25 07:55:37 UTC 2011 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 0.3.1
  * Fixed broken bool evaluation in supervisor. Thanks to jonozzz
    The bug originated from a ``a if x else b`` vs. ``x and a or bz``
    confusion when porting code to Python 2.4.
  * ``ApplyResult._set`` can't delete the result if it's not been accepted.
    This also means ``ApplyResult._ack`` needs to delete the result if the job
    has been marked ready.
- 0.3.0
  * Added support for accept callbacks.
- 0.2.3
  * Python 2.4 support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
