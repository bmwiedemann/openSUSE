  <title>Module for splitting text into sentences.</title>
  <description>The 'Lingua::EN::Sentence' module contains the function get_sentences,
which splits text into its constituent sentences, based on a regular
expression and a list of abbreviations (built in and given).

Certain well know exceptions, such as abreviations, may cause incorrect
segmentations. But some of them are already integrated into this code and
are being taken care of. Still, if you see that there are words causing the
get_sentences() to fail, you can add those to the module, so it notices
them.</description>
