  4.025 Thr Jul 28, 2022
      * Release with build fixes for the Decoder under threaded
        perls and MANIFEST update.

  4.024 Wed Jul 27, 2022
      * Changes to the FREEZE/THAW mechanism. Remove the part that
        says that FREEZE cannot return a list. It can, and we have
        supported it for a very long time, although I have not checked
        how far back this support goes. If you use the FREEZE/THAW
        API's you should upgrade to this version or later.
      * Test fixes for t/020_sort_keys.t hanging on some perls
        which do not come bundled with Hash::Util.

      * Make it possible to upgrade with passing tests when using
        Sereal::Decoder 4.015 - 4.019 on threaded debugging perls.
        IF YOU USE THREADED PERLS YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO UPDATE
        TO THIS VERSION OR LATER. *UPGRADE THE DECODER IMMEDIATELY*.
  4.022 Sat Feb 19, 2022
  4.021 Fri Feb 18, 2022
      * Early but incomplete versions of 4.023, skip these releases.
  4.020 Thurs Feb 17, 2022
      * Fix "panic: free from wrong pool" errors on threaded builds.
        This error is only visible on DEBUGGING perls however it exists
        regardless. If you are using a threaded build upgrade to this!
        Thanks to Andreas J. Koenig for finding the bug, and Nicholas Clark
        for suggesting valgrind to debug and fix it.

  3.006 Nov 14 2015
    * [DECODER] fix segfaults from heavily corrupted data. Guards
      against various pathological cases which could cause segfaults
      fixed. Thanks to Damian Gryski and "fuzzing sereal with afl"
      for finding these cases.
    * [ENCODER] Various subtle fixes to how we choose whether to serialize
      the string or numeric version of a value, in particular to
      ensure that "00" always round trips as "00", and related issues.
      Note this fix has correctness and performance consequences. In
      some cases values that used to serialized as integers (arguably
      incorrectly) will be serialized as strings instead, and some code
      maybe be slower to serialize.
      NOTE: Some issues related to this subject are not fixable without
      a protocol change. In particular this change may affect the behavior
      of code that uses binary logical operators on values serialized
      with Perl.
      Thanks to Zefram, Tom, and others for help with this issue.
    * Fixups for cast warnings under -Wint-to-ptr builds by using
      using PTR2INT and INT2PTR for casting our objects.
    * Win32 fixes
    * Build improvements
    * Changes to how we generate constants
