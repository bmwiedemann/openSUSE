Sun Mar 21 10:13:42 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 0.9.0
  * Version 0.9.0 of the Python Control Toolbox
    (python-control) contains a number of enhanced features
    and changes to functions. Some of these changes may
    require modifications to existing user code and, in
    addition, some default settings have changed that may
    affect the appearance of plots or operation of certain
    functions.
  * Significant new additions including improvements in the
    I/O systems modules that allow automatic interconnection
    of signals having the same name (via the interconnect
    function), generation and plotting of describing functions
    for closed loop systems with static nonlinearities, and a
    new optimal control module that allows basic computation
    of optimal controls (including model predictive
    controllers). Some of the changes that may break use code
    include the deprecation of the NumPy matrix type (2D NumPy
    arrays are used instead), changes in the return value for
    Nyquist plots (now returns number of encirclements rather
    than the frequency response), switching the default
    timebase of systems to be 0 rather than None (no
    timebase), and changes in the processing of return values
    for time and frequency responses (to make them more
    consistent). In many cases, the earlier behavior can be
    restored by calling use_legacy_defaults('0.8.4').
  New Features:
  * Optimal control module, including rudimentary MPC
    control (#549 by murrayrm)
  * Describing functions plots (#521 by murrayrm)
  * MIMO impulse and step response (#514 by murrayrm)
  * I/O system improvements:
  * linearize() retains signal names plus new interconnect()
    function (#497 by murrayrm)
  * Add summing junction + implicit signal interconnection (#517
    by murrayrm)
  * Implementation of initial_phase, wrap_phase keywords for
    bode_plot (#494 by murrayrm)
  * Added IPython LaTeX representation method for StateSpace
    objects (#450 by roryyorke)
  * New dynamics() and output() methods in StateSpace (#566 by
    sawyerbfuller)
  * FRD systems can now be created from a discrete time LTI system
    (#568 by bnavigator)
  * Cost and constraints are now allowed for
    flatsys.point_to_point() (#569 by murrayrm)
