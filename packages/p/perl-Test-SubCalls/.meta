  <title>Track the number of times subs are called</title>
  <description>There are a number of different situations (like testing caching code)
where you want to want to do a number of tests, and then verify that some
underlying subroutine deep within the code was called a specific number of
times.

This module provides a number of functions for doing testing in this way in
association with your normal the Test::More manpage (or similar) test
scripts.</description>
