  1.15     2015-09-19
  
  - Fix the Makefile.PL so that we don't install the LibMagic.xs and typemap
    files. Based on a patch from Petr Pisar. RT #107081.
  
  
  1.14     2015-09-16
  
  - Fixed handling of extra include dirs passed to Makefile.PL via the -I
    flag. This wasn't working properly in previous releases. Reported by Andy
    Jack. GH #6.
  
  
  1.13     2015-07-12
  
  - Fix failing tests with some versions of libmagic. PR #5 by E. Choroba.
  
  
  1.12     2015-03-07
  
  - The constructor now accepts named params. In addition to a magic_file param,
    it now accepts follow_symlinks and uncompress params. These do what you'd
    expect, tell the object to follow symlinks and/or uncompress files when
    getting info from them. The old single parameter constructor is still
    supported, but is no longer documented.
  
  - The old APIs are now called "discouraged" rather than "deprecated" in the
    documentation. I have no plan to remove these APIs any time soon or to make
    them warn, so "deprecated" was too strong a word.
  
  - Changed a test to hopefully skip rather than fail on OpenBSD systems.
  
  
  1.11     2015-03-01
  
  - The info_from_handle() method did not handle binary data correctly, which
    could lead to incorrect results.
  
  - The info_from_*() methods returned a full mime type with encoding in the
    "mime_type" key rather than just the mime type alone.
  
  - Allow File::LibMagic->new() to accept an array reference containing multiple
    magic file paths.

- updated to 1.10

  * Added yet another OO API to File::LibMagic. This provides a simpler and more
    future-proof API which can be expanded on later. The new methods are
    info_from_string(), info_from_filename(), and info_from_handle(). The latter
    method allows you to get info about an open filehandle. These new methods
    return the description, MIME type, and character encoding in one call. This
    addresses RT #54843 and partially addresses RT #99470.
  * Switched from using Devel::CheckLib to Config::AutoConf with the hope that
    the latter will work with more compilers. Requested by Jens Rehsack. RT
    #46543.
  * Switched the primary git repo to github
    (https://github.com/autarch/File-LibMagic).
  * A File::LibMagic object would not close one of the handles it might have
    opened, leading to leaks. Reported by Alexander Zaitsev. RT #93512.

- cleaned up spec-file, added example subdir
  My tests show, that this is the best of all. File::MimeInfo::Magic comes second.
  Thanks Christos!

- initial check in, 0.96
  File::Type, File::MMagic, File::MMagic::XS, File::MimeInfo::Magic need some more competition
