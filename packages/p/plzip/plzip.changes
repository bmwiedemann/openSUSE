Thu Feb  8 13:34:29 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.11
  * The option -o/--output now preserves dates, permissions, and
    ownership of the file when (de)compressing exactly one file.

    directories when writing to a file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 13 22:37:24 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.10
  * In case of error in a numerical argument to a command line
    option, plzip now shows the name of the option and the range

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 12 20:51:45 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.9:
  * main.cc (main): Report an error if a file name is empty.
    Make '-o' behave like '-c', but writing to file instead of stdout.
    Make '-c' and '-o' check whether the output is a terminal only once.
    Do not open output if input is a terminal.
  * main.cc: New option '--check-lib'.
  * Replace 'decompressed', 'compressed' with 'out', 'in' in output.
  * decompress.cc, dec_stream.cc, dec_stdout.cc:
    Continue testing if any input file fails the test.
    Show the largest dictionary size in a multimember file.
  * main.cc: Show final diagnostic when testing multiple files.
  * decompress.cc, dec_stream.cc [LZ_API_VERSION >= 1012]: Avoid
    copying decompressed data when testing with lzlib 1.12 or newer.
  * compress.cc, dec_stream.cc: Start only the worker threads required.
  * dec_stream.cc: Splitter stops reading when trailing data is found.
    Don't include trailing data in the compressed size shown.
    Use plain comparison instead of Boyer-Moore to search for headers.
  * lzip_index.cc: Improve messages for corruption in last header.
  * decompress.cc: Shorten messages 'Data error' and 'Unexpected EOF'.
  * main.cc: Set a valid invocation_name even if argc == 0.
  * Document extraction from tar.lz in manual, '--help', and man page.
  * plzip.texi (Introduction): Mention tarlz as an alternative.
  * plzip.texi: Several fixes and improvements.
  * testsuite: Add 8 new test files.

Mon Jan  7 21:18:14 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.8
  * No functional changes; just a version bump.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 14 11:59:01 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 1.8~rc1
  * The new options '--in-slots' and '--out-slots', setting the
    number of input and output packets buffered during streamed
    decompression, have been added. Increasing the number of
    packets may increase decompression speed, but requires more
    memory.
  * The default number of input packets buffered per worker
    thread when decompressing from non-seekable input has been
    increased from 2 to 4.
  * The default number of output packets buffered per worker
    thread when decompressing to non-seekable output has been
    increased from 32 to 64.
  * Detection of forbidden combinations of characters in trailing
    data has been improved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  5 19:39:23 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.7
  * The option "--loose-trailing" has been added.
  * The test used by clzip to discriminate trailing data from a
    corrupt header in multimember or concatenated files has been
    improved to a Hamming distance of 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 11 10:12:18 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 1.6:
  * The option '-l, --list' has been ported from lziprecover.
  * It is now an error to specify two or more different operations
    in the command line (--decompress, --list or --test).
  * In test mode, plzip now continues checking the rest of the
    files if any input file is a terminal.
- Update dependecies and sections for info file handling

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 08:18:48 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.5
* The option "-a, --trailing-error", which makes plzip exit with
  error status 2 if any remaining input is detected after
  decompressing the last member, has been added.
* When decompressing, the file specified with the "--output" option
  is now deleted if the input is a terminal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  6 08:17:37 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.4
* The option "-0" has been modified to use the new fast encoder of
  lzlib 1.7, which achieves a compression speed and ratio
  comparable to those of pigz's default compression level.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  8 14:39:20 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.3
* Testing of a non-seekable file or of standard input now uses up
  to 30 MiB less memory per thread.
* "-dvvv" and "-tvvv" now show the dictionary size of the first
  member, producing the same output as lzip for single-member
  files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  1 11:51:34 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.2
* Copying of file dates, permissions, and ownership now behaves
  like `cp -p`. (If the user ID or the group ID cannot be
  duplicated, the file permission bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID are
  cleared).
* Individual limits have been set on the number of packets produced
  by each decompresor worker thread to limit the amount of memory
  used in all cases.
* The license has been changed to GPL version 2 or later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 23 16:55:53 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Drop gpg-offline build-time requirement; this is now handled by
  the local source validator

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 29 20:50:14 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.1
* Plzip now shows the progress of compression at verbosity
  level 2 (-vv).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  5 21:57:22 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.0
* Scalability of compression (max number of useful worker threads)
  has been increased. Scalability when decompressing from/to
  regular files has been increased.
* The number of worker threads is now limited to the number of
  members in the input file when decompressing from a regular file.
- Do signature verification
- Wrap description at 70 cols
- Remove redundant %clean section

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 26 17:10:24 UTC 2012 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

  * the option "-F, --recompress", which forces recompression of files whose
    name already has the ".lz" or ".tlz" suffix, has been added
  * the options "-d, --decompress" and "-t, --test" now also show compression
    ratio
  * inability to change output file attributes has been downgraded from error
    to warning
  * quote characters in messages have been changed as advised by GNU Coding
    Standards

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    platforms defining the O_BINARY macro
