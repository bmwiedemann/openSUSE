%description
Plzip is a parallel version of the lzip data compressor. The files
produced by plzip are fully compatible with lzip-1.4 or newer. Plzip
is intended for faster compression/decompression of big files on
multiprocessor machines.

Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with
very safe integrity checking and a user interface similar to the one
of gzip or bzip2. Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and
compresses better than bzip2, which makes it well suited for software
distribution and data archiving.
