%description
This module reads a file backwards line by line. It is simple to use,
memory efficient and fast. It supports both an object and a tied handle
interface.

It is intended for processing log and other similar text files which
typically have their newest entries appended to them. By default files are
assumed to be plain text and have a line ending appropriate to the OS. But
you can set the input record separator string on a per file basis.
