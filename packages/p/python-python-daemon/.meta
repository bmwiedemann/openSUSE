  <title>Library to implement a well-behaved Unix daemon process</title>
  <description>This library implements the well-behaved daemon specification of PEP 3143, &quot;Standard daemon
process library&quot;.

A well-behaved Unix daemon process is tricky to get right, but the required steps are much the
same for every daemon program. A DaemonContext instance holds the behaviour and configured
process environment for the program; use the instance as a context manager to enter a daemon state.</description>
