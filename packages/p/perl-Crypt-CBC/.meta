  <title>Encrypt Data with Cipher Block Chaining Mode</title>
  <description>This module is a Perl-only implementation of the cryptographic cipher block
chaining mode (CBC). In combination with a block cipher such as DES or
IDEA, you can encrypt and decrypt messages of arbitrarily long length. The
encrypted messages are compatible with the encryption format used by the
*OpenSSL* package.</description>
