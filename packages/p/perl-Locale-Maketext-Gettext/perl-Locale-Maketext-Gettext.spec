%description
Locale::Maketext::Gettext joins the GNU gettext and Maketext frameworks. It
is a subclass of Locale::Maketext(3) that follows the way GNU gettext
works. It works seamlessly, _both in the sense of GNU gettext and
Maketext_. As a result, you _enjoy both their advantages, and get rid of
both their problems, too._

You start as a usual GNU gettext localization project: Work on PO files
with the help of translators, reviewers and Emacs. Turn them into MO files
with _msgfmt_. Copy them into the appropriate locale directory, such as
_/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/myapp.mo_.

Then, build your Maketext localization class, with your base class changed
from Locale::Maketext(3) to Locale::Maketext::Gettext. That is all.
