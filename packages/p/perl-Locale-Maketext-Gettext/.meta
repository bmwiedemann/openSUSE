  <title>Joins the gettext and Maketext frameworks</title>
  <description>Locale::Maketext::Gettext joins the GNU gettext and Maketext frameworks. It
is a subclass of Locale::Maketext(3) that follows the way GNU gettext
works. It works seamlessly, both in the sense of GNU gettext and Maketext.
As a result, you enjoy both their advantages, and get rid of both their
problems, too.</description>
