%description
A small Python library to parse various kinds of time expressions,
inspired by a StackOverflow question.

The single function pytimeparse.timeparse.timeparse defined in the
library (also available as pytimeparse.parse) parses time expressions
like the following:

  * 32m
  * 2h32m
  * 3d2h32m
  * 1w3d2h32m
  * 1w 3d 2h 32m
  * 1 w 3 d 2 h 32 m
  * ...

It returns the time as a number of seconds (an integer value if
possible, otherwise a floating-point number)

A number of seconds can be converted back into a string using the
datetime module in the standard library.
