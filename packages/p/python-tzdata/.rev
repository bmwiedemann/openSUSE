    <comment>- update to 2024.1:
  * Upstream version 2024a
  * Kazakhstan unifies on UTC+5 beginning 2024-03-01. Palestine
    springs forward a week later after Ramadan.
    zic no longer pretends to support indefinite-past DST.
  * localtime no longer mishandles Ciudad Ju√°rez in 2422.
  * Kazakhstan unifies on UTC+5.  This affects Asia/Almaty and
    Asia/Qostanay which together represent the eastern portion
    of the country that will transition from UTC+6 on
    2024-03-01 at 00:00 to join the western portion.
  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously
    predicted in 2024 and 2025.
  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00
    not 00:00.
  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at
    02:00 not 00:00.
  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May
    15.
  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members
    affect which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.</comment>
