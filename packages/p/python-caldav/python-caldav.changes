Mon Jun 15 06:29:32 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.7.1:
  * Some tweaks to support newer versions of Zimbra and other caldav server implementations with slightly twisted support for the RFC.
  * API change: add_event, add_todo and add_journal methods are now deprecated and aliases of save_. New attributes no_create and no_overwrite if one wants to be sure the save_-methods does the right thing.
  * Calendars can now be created without a display name
  * Quite some minor bugfixes
  * Some code refactoring, removing some duplicated code
  * library will gracefully create an UID if fed with caldav data missing the UID field
  * the code for calendar searches has been reorganized making it possible for "power users" to do custom calendar searches.
- Drop nose from BuildRequires/Requires, we don't run the testsuite, and it
  isn't listed in the requirements.

- update to 0.6.2
  * caldav/lib/error.py - ProppatchError was not defined, ref https://github.com/python-caldav/caldav/issues/54.

    added to DAVClient.
  * caldav/elements/cdav.py - fixing a retention problem - the 
    timezone fixes done recently was not compatible with python 2.7 nor 3.5.
