    <comment>- Update to 0.7.1:
  * Some tweaks to support newer versions of Zimbra and other caldav server implementations with slightly twisted support for the RFC.
  * API change: add_event, add_todo and add_journal methods are now deprecated and aliases of save_. New attributes no_create and no_overwrite if one wants to be sure the save_-methods does the right thing.
  * Calendars can now be created without a display name
  * Quite some minor bugfixes
  * Some code refactoring, removing some duplicated code
  * library will gracefully create an UID if fed with caldav data missing the UID field
  * the code for calendar searches has been reorganized making it possible for &quot;power users&quot; to do custom calendar searches.
- Drop nose from BuildRequires/Requires, we don't run the testsuite, and it
  isn't listed in the requirements.</comment>

    <comment>- update to 0.8.2:
  * urllib.quote on uuids before including it in a new URL on object creation
  * Principal.calendar (and CalendarSet.calendar) now accepts an URL as &quot;cal_id&quot;
  * Minor workaround for problem with cloud.global/e.email: urllib.quote the
    calendar_home_set_url if it's a path and it contains the character '@'
  * Minor fixes to improve support for SOGo
  * Bugfix for non-ascii in the password
  * timezones ... the API of tzlocal was changed for a short while,
    pytz is deprecated, but icalendar only supports timestamps localized with pytz.  What a mess!
  * Added supported-report-set to the tags (but so far no code for using it)
  * Multiget didn't work
  * Silly spelling mistake in one of the error classes
  * Attempts to resolve broken ical issues with X-APPLE-STRUCTURED-EVENT
    and X-APPLE-STRUCTURED-LOCATION (#37, ...)
  * Compatibility issue with e.email</comment>

    <time>1667499311</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Add drop-python2-support.patch to remove python-six dependency
  gh#python-caldav/caldav#228
- Remove python_module macro definition
- Update to 0.10.0
  ## Quick summary
  * Work on a universal search method
    * Refactoring, consolidated lots of slightly duplicated code into one
      method to rule them all
    * Support for things needed by the calendar-cli utility, like search by
      categories
  * Support for completion of recurring tasks
  * More utilities for tasks
    * Uncomplete-method ... for undoing the complete (recurrences not supported
      though)
    * get/set duration/dtstart/dtend (arguably this belongs to vobject and/or
      icalendar)
  * Other improvements:
    * picklable URLs
    * display_name convenience method
    * possible to set child/parent relationships
  * Potential bugfix: sequence number may need to be increased when saving
    something to the calendar (not backported, this may have side effects)
  ## Search method
  Calendar now has a method search.  Here is some information from the
  docstring:
  Parameters supported:
  * xml - use this search query, and ignore other filter parameters
  * comp_class - set to event, todo or journal to restrict search to this
    resource type.  Some server implementations require this to be set.
  * todo - sets comp_class to Todo, and restricts search to pending tasks,
    unless the next parameter is set ...
  * include_completed - include completed tasks
  * event - sets comp_class to event
  * text attribute search parameters: category, uid, summary, omment,
    description, location, status
  * expand - do server side expanding of recurring events/tasks
  * start, stop: do a time range search
  * filters - other kind of filters (in lxml tree format)
  * sort_keys - list of attributes to use when sorting
  not supported yet:
  * negated text match
  * attribute not set
  ## Completed tasks
  While the RFCs do support recurring tasks, they are not very clear on the
  details.  In v0.10 there are three different ways to complete a task.  The
  first one is to ignore the RRULE property and mark the task as completed.
  This is the backwards-compatibility mode - though, according to my
  understanding of a &quot;recurring task&quot; this is the wrong way to do it.
  The two other modes considers the task to be &quot;interval based&quot; is no BY-rules
  are specified in the RRULE - meaning that if a task is supposed to be done
  weekly, then a week should pass from it was completed and until one needs to
  start with it again - no matter the DTSTART of the original instance - but
  the standards may also be interpreted so that if the original task was to be
  started at a Tuesday 10:00, then all recurrences should be started at a
  Tuesday 10:00.
  Both the modes stores a copy of the completed task, for the record.  The
  &quot;safe&quot; mode stores the copy as a completely independent task, and modifies
  the DTSTART/DUE of the original task - so the completed task is not linked up
  to the recurring task.  (One may eventually try to make a link by
  establishing a &quot;parent task&quot;).
  The &quot;thisandfuture&quot;-mode will establish the completed task as a separate
  recurrence in a recurrence set.  The non-completed task is also duplicated
  with a new DTSTART set and range set to THISANDFUTURE. As I understand the
  RFC, this is the way to handle interval-based tasks, future recurrences will
  then base their starting time on the DTSTART of the THISANDFUTURE task.  For
  fixed tasks the THISANDFUTURE recurrence is moot, so I'm considering to
  create a third mode as well.
