  <title>A selection of general-utility list subroutines</title>
  <description>List::Util contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed would
be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high enough
to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such that being
individual extensions would be wasteful.
