  <title>Utilities to test STDOUT and STDERR messages.</title>
  <description>Test::Output provides a simple interface for testing output sent to STDOUT
or STDERR. A number of different utilities are included to try and be as
flexible as possible to the tester.

Originally this module was designed not to have external requirements,
however, the features provided by the Sub::Exporter manpage over what the
Exporter manpage provides is just to great to pass up.

Test::Output ties STDOUT and STDERR using Test::Output::Tie.</description>
