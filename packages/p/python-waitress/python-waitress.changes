Sun Jun 30 07:59:06 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.0.0:
  * Fixed testing of vendored asyncore code to not rely on
    particular naming for errno's.
  * HTTP Request methods and versions are now validated to meet
    the HTTP standards thereby dropping invalid requests on the floor.
  * No longer close the connection when sending a HEAD request
    response.
  * Always attempt to send the Connection: close response header
    when we are going to close the connection to let the remote
    know in more instances.
  * Document that trusted_proxy may be set to a wildcard value to
    trust all proxies.
  * clear_untrusted_proxy_headers is set to True by default.

- update to version 2.1.2 (bsc#1200126, CVE-2022-31015):
  * Bugfix
    + When expose_tracebacks is enabled waitress would fail to
      properly encode unicode thereby causing another error during
      error handling. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/378
    + Header length checking had a calculation that was done
      incorrectly when the data was received across multple socket
      reads. This calculation has been corrected, and no longer will
      Waitress send back a 413 Request Entity Too Large. See
      https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/376
  * Security Bugfix
    + in 2.1.0 a new feature was introduced that allowed the WSGI
      thread to start sending data to the socket. However this
      introduced a race condition whereby a socket may be closed in
      the sending thread while the main thread is about to call
      select() therey causing the entire application to be taken down.
      Waitress will no longer close the socket in the WSGI thread,
      instead waking up the main thread to cleanup. See
      https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/377

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 17 17:42:42 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.1 (bsc#1197255, CVE-2022-24761):
  * Waitress now validates that chunked encoding extensions are valid, and don’t
    contain invalid characters that are not allowed. They are still skipped/not
    processed, but if they contain invalid data we no longer continue in and return
    a 400 Bad Request. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request smuggling.
    Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36
  * Waitress now validates that the chunk length is only valid hex digits when
    parsing chunked encoding, and values such as 0x01 and +01 are no longer
    supported. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request smuggling. Thanks
    to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36
  * Waitress now validates that the Content-Length sent by a remote contains only
    digits in accordance with RFC7230 and will return a 400 Bad Request when the
    Content-Length header contains invalid data, such as +10 which would
    previously get parsed as 10 and accepted. This stops potential HTTP
    desync/HTTP request smuggling Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 11:27:31 UTC 2021 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.0.0
  - Friendly Reminder
    This release still contains a variety of deprecation notices about defaults
    that can be set for a variety of options.
    Please note that this is your last warning, and you should update your
    configuration if you do NOT want to use the new defaults.
    See the arguments documentation page for all supported options, and pay
    attention to the warnings:
    https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/arguments.html
  - Fix a crash on startup when listening to multiple interfaces.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/332
  - Waitress no longer attempts to guess at what the ``server_name`` should be for
    a listen socket, instead it always use a new adjustment/argument named
    ``server_name``.
    Please see the documentation for ``server_name`` in
    https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/arguments.html and
    see https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/329
  - Allow tasks to notice if the client disconnected.
    This inserts a callable ``waitress.client_disconnected`` into the environment
    that allows the task to check if the client disconnected while waiting for
    the response at strategic points in the execution and to cancel the
    operation.
    It requires setting the new adjustment ``channel_request_lookahead`` to a value
    larger than 0, which continues to read requests from a channel even if a
    request is already being processed on that channel, up to the given count,
    since a client disconnect is detected by reading from a readable socket and
    receiving an empty result.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/310
  - Drop Python 2.7 and 3.5 support
  - The server now issues warning output when it there are enough open
    connections (controlled by "connection_limit"), that it is no longer
    accepting new connections. This situation was previously difficult to
    diagnose.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/322

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  1 13:33:24 UTC 2020 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to version 1.4.4 (2020-06-01)
  + Fix an issue with keep-alive connections in which memory usage
    was higher than expected because output buffers were being
    reused across requests on a long-lived connection and each
    buffer would not be freed until it was full or the connection
    was closed. Buffers are now rotated per-request to stabilize
    their behavior.
  + See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/300
  + Waitress threads have been updated to contain their thread
    number. This will allow loggers that use that information to
    print the thread that the log is coming from.
  + See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/302
- Switch to pytest, disable one test, that requires network

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  6 17:29:20 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.3
  * Waitress did not properly validate that the HTTP headers it received
    were properly formed, thereby potentially allowing a front-end server
    to treat a request different from Waitress. This could lead to HTTP
    request smuggling/splitting.
- drop patch local-intersphinx-inventories.patch
  * it was commented out, anyway

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 20 18:28:24 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.0:
  - Waitress used to slam the door shut on HTTP pipelined requests without
  setting the ``Connection: close`` header as appropriate in the response. This
  is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when
  responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500
  Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the
  connection after the response is sent.

  - Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name
  and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not
  vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent
  back a 400 Bad Request. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273

  - CRLR handling Security fixes

    starts with a double slash

- version update to 1.3.0
  Deprecations
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - The ``send_bytes`` adjustment now defaults to ``1`` and is deprecated
    pending removal in a future release.
    and https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/246
  Features
  ~~~~~~~~
  - Add a new ``outbuf_high_watermark`` adjustment which is used to apply
    backpressure on the ``app_iter`` to avoid letting it spin faster than data
    can be written to the socket. This stabilizes responses that iterate quickly
    with a lot of data.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/242
  - Stop early and close the ``app_iter`` when attempting to write to a closed
    socket due to a client disconnect. This should notify a long-lived streaming
    response when a client hangs up.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/238
    and https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/240
    and https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/241
  - Adjust the flush to output ``SO_SNDBUF`` bytes instead of whatever was
    set in the ``send_bytes`` adjustment. ``send_bytes`` now only controls how
    much waitress will buffer internally before flushing to the kernel, whereas
    previously it used to also throttle how much data was sent to the kernel.
    This change enables a streaming ``app_iter`` containing small chunks to
    still be flushed efficiently.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/246
  Bugfixes
  ~~~~~~~~
  - Upon receiving a request that does not include HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 we will
    no longer set the version to the string value "None". See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/252 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/110
  - When a client closes a socket unexpectedly there was potential for memory
    leaks in which data was written to the buffers after they were closed,
    causing them to reopen.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/239
  - Fix the queue depth warnings to only show when all threads are busy.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/243
    and https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/247
  - Trigger the ``app_iter`` to close as part of shutdown. This will only be
    noticeable for users of the internal server api. In more typical operations
    the server will die before benefiting from these changes.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/245
  - Fix a bug in which a streaming ``app_iter`` may never cleanup data that has
    already been sent. This would cause buffers in waitress to grow without
    bounds. These buffers now properly rotate and release their data.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/242
  - Fix a bug in which non-seekable subclasses of ``io.IOBase`` would trigger
    an exception when passed to the ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` callback.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/249

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 13 00:49:45 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 1.1.0:
  * Features
    + Waitress now has a __main__ and thus may be called with "python
      -mwaitress"
  * Bugfixes
    + Waitress no longer allows lowercase HTTP verbs. This change was
      made to fall in line with most HTTP servers. See
      https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/170
    + When receiving non-ascii bytes in the request URL, waitress will
      no longer abruptly close the connection, instead returning a 400
      Bad Request. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/162 and
      https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  1 16:38:04 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.0.2
  * Python 3.6 is now officially supported in Waitress
  * Add a work-around for libc issue on Linux not following the
    documented standards. If getnameinfo() fails because of DNS not
    being available it should return the IP address instead of the
    reverse DNS entry, however instead getnameinfo() raises. We
    catch this, and ask getnameinfo() for the same information
    again, explicitly asking for IP address instead of reverse
    DNS hostname.
- Implement single-spec version.
- Fix source URL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 15 14:49:27 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 1.0.1:
  - IPv6 support on Windows was broken due to missing constants in the socket
    module. This has been resolved by setting the constants on Windows if they
    are missing. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/138
  - A ValueError was raised on Windows when passing a string for the port, on
    Windows in Python 2 using service names instead of port numbers doesn't work
    with `getaddrinfo`. This has been resolved by attempting to convert the port
    number to an integer, if that fails a ValueError will be raised. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/139
  - Removed `AI_ADDRCONFIG` from the call to `getaddrinfo`, this resolves an
    issue whereby `getaddrinfo` wouldn't return any addresses to `bind` to on
    hosts where there is no internet connection but localhost is requested to be
    bound to. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/131 for more
    information.
- disable tests. need network access.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 20 11:27:26 UTC 2016 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.9.0:
  * Security/Protections
    - Building on the changes made in pull request 117, add in checking for line
      feed/carriage return HTTP Response Splitting in the status line, as well as
      the key of a header. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/124 and
      https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/122.
    - Waitress will no longer accept headers or status lines with
      newline/carriage returns in them, thereby disallowing HTTP Response
      Splitting.
  * Bugfixes
    - FileBasedBuffer and more important ReadOnlyFileBasedBuffer no longer report
      False when tested with bool(), instead always returning True, and becoming
      more iterator like.
    - Call prune() on the output buffer at the end of a request so that it doesn't
      continue to grow without bounds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 12 22:08:09 UTC 2014 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 0.8.9:
  - Fix tests under Windows.  NB: to run tests under Windows, you cannot run
    "setup.py test" or "setup.py nosetests".  Instead you must run ``python.exe
    -c "import nose; nose.main()"``.  If you try to run the tests using the
    normal method under Windows, each subprocess created by the test suite will
    attempt to run the test suite again.  See
    https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/issues/407 for more information.
  - Give the WSGI app_iter generated when ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` is used
    (ReadOnlyFileBasedBuffer) a ``close`` method.  Do not call ``close`` on an
    instance of such a class when it's used as a WSGI app_iter, however.  This is
    part of a fix which prevents a leakage of file descriptors; the other part of
    the fix was in WebOb
    (https://github.com/Pylons/webob/commit/951a41ce57bd853947f842028bccb500bd5237da).
  - Allow trusted proxies to override ``wsgi.url_scheme`` via a request header,
    ``X_FORWARDED_PROTO``.  Allows proxies which serve mixed HTTP / HTTPS
    requests to control signal which are served as HTTPS.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/42.
  - Fix some cases where the creation of extremely large output buffers (greater
    than 2GB, suspected to be buffers added via ``wsgi.file_wrapper``) might
    cause an OverflowError on Python 2.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/47.
  - When the ``url_prefix`` adjustment starts with more than one slash, all
    slashes except one will be stripped from its beginning.  This differs from
    older behavior where more than one leading slash would be preserved in
    ``url_prefix``.
  - If a client somehow manages to send an empty path, we no longer convert the
    empty path to a single slash in ``PATH_INFO``.  Instead, the path remains
    empty.  According to RFC 2616 section "5.1.2 Request-URI", the scenario of a
    client sending an empty path is actually not possible because the request URI
    portion cannot be empty.
  - If the ``url_prefix`` adjustment matches the request path exactly, we now
    compute ``SCRIPT_NAME`` and ``PATH_INFO`` properly.  Previously, if the
    ``url_prefix`` was ``/foo`` and the path received from a client was ``/foo``,
    we would set *both* ``SCRIPT_NAME`` and ``PATH_INFO`` to ``/foo``.  This was
    incorrect.  Now in such a case we set ``PATH_INFO`` to the empty string and
    we set ``SCRIPT_NAME`` to ``/foo``.  Note that the change we made has no
    effect on paths that do not match the ``url_prefix`` exactly (such as
    ``/foo/bar``); these continue to operate as they did.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/46
  - Preserve header ordering of headers with the same name as per RFC 2616.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/44
  - When waitress receives a ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` request, we no longer
    send the ``TRANSFER_ENCODING`` nor the ``HTTP_TRANSFER_ENCODING`` value to
    the application in the environment.  Instead, we pop this header.  Since we
    cope with chunked requests by buffering the data in the server, we also know
    when a chunked request has ended, and therefore we know the content length.
    We set the content-length header in the environment, such that applications
    effectively never know the original request was a T-E: chunked request; it
    will appear to them as if the request is a non-chunked request with an
    accurate content-length.
  - Cope with the fact that the ``Transfer-Encoding`` value is case-insensitive.
  - When the ``--unix-socket-perms`` option was used as an argument to
    ``waitress-serve``, a ``TypeError`` would be raised.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/50.
- Enable testsuite during build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 21:14:23 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.8.7:
  - The HTTP version of the response returned by waitress when it catches an
  exception will now match the HTTP request version.
  - Fix: CONNECTION header will be HTTP_CONNECTION and not CONNECTION_TYPE
  (see https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/13)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 13 10:15:30 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.8.6:
 - Do alternate type of checking for UNIX socket support, instead of checking
   for platform == windows.

 - Functional tests now use multiprocessing module instead of subprocess module,
   speeding up test suite and making concurrent execution more reliable.

 - Runner now appends the current working directory to ``sys.path`` to support
   running WSGI applications from a directory (i.e., not installed in a
   virtualenv).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 11:28:09 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.8.5:
 - Fix runner multisegment imports in some Python 2 revisions (see
   https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/34).
 - For compatibility, WSGIServer is now an alias of TcpWSGIServer. The
   signature of BaseWSGIServer is now compatible with WSGIServer pre-0.8.4.
 - Add a command-line runner called ``waitress-serve`` to allow Waitress
   to run WSGI applications without any addional machinery. This is
   essentially a thin wrapper around the ``waitress.serve()`` function.
 - Allow parallel testing (e.g., under ``detox`` or ``nosetests --processes``)
   using PID-dependent port / socket for functest servers.
 - Fix integer overflow errors on large buffers. Thanks to Marcin Kuzminski
   for the patch.  See: https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/22
 - Add support for listening on Unix domain sockets.
