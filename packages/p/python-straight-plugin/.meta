  <description>straight.plugin is a Python plugin loader inspired by twisted.plugin with two
important distinctions:

 - Fewer dependencies
 - Python 3 compatible

The system is used to allow multiple Python packages to provide plugins within
a namespace package, where other packages will locate and utilize. The plugins
themselves are modules in a namespace package where the namespace identifies
the plugins in it for some particular purpose or intent.
