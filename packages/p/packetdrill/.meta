  <title>Testing tool for kernel networking stack</title>
  <description>The packetdrill scripting tool enables quick, precise tests for entire
TCP/UDP/IPv4/IPv6 network stacks, from the system call layer down to the
NIC hardware. packetdrill currently works on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and
NetBSD. It can test network stack behavior over physical NICs on a LAN, or
on a single machine using a tun virtual network device.
