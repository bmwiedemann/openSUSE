- Update to 0.3.0
  * Provide both the requirements and their parents as exceptiondata for the
    ``ResolutionImpossible`` exception, via a ``causes`` attribute that replaces
    the previous ``requirements`` attribute.
  * Make resolver backtrack when none of the candidates requested for a package
    are able to resolve due to them requesting unworkable requirements, or a
    package has no candidates at all. Previously the resolver would give up on the
    spot.
  * Ensure the result returned by the resolver only contains candidates that are
    actually needed. This is done by tracing the graph after resolution completes,
    snipping nodes that donâ€™t have a route to the root.
