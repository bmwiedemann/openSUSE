          + Fix : [RT #123411] : Compatibility with CV-in-stash optimisation
                  Thanks Father Chrysostomos for reporting and contributing a
                  patch.
          + Fix : [RT #122956] : strict/warn flags seem to simply do nothing
                  The documentation has been amended to clarify how these two
                  options are supposed to be used.
                  Thanks Christian Walde for reporting.

          + Chg : A large chunk of boilerplate XS code, which is also used in
                  other XS modules, has been factored out of the main .xs file
                  to a collection of .h files in the xsh subdirectory.
          + Fix : The new optimization in perl 5.27.3 for scalar(keys(%$hashref))
                  is now correcty supported.

          + Chg : The new environment variable to enable thread tests on older
                  perls is PERL_FORCE_TEST_THREADS. Note that this variable
                  should only be turned on by authors.
          + Fix : The module has been taught about the new multideref
                  optimization, and will function properly on perl 5.21.11 and
                  above.
          + Fix : The module will no longer crash or behave erratically when it
                  is loaded by several threads (or Windows emulated processes)
                  ran in parallel.
          + Fix : Update the Windows ActivePerl + gcc 3.4 workaround for
                  ExtUtils::MakeMaker 7.04. Thanks Christian Walde for reporting
                  and feedback on this issue.
          + Fix : Be really compatible with the optional OP_PARENT feature.
          + Tst : $ENV{$Config{ldlibpthname}} is now preserved on all platforms,
                  which will address failures of t/43-peep.t and
                  t/51-threads-teardown.t with unusual compilers (like icc) that
                  link all their compiled objects to their own libraries.

          + Fix : [RT #99458] : AnyEvent::Loop hangs if autovivification 0.13 is
                  loaded
                  [RT #99904] : 'no autovivification' breaks Lingua::EN::Inflect
                  from a distance
                  This was a regression in 0.13 which caused the peephole
                  optimizer to loop infinitely on "... while 1" constructs.
                  However, the Lingua::EN::Inflect problem only occured in perl
                  5.20 and above.
                  Thanks Toshio Ito and Kent Fredric for reporting.

          This release contains a change that, while being very likely to be safe,
          can potentially cause freezes during code compilation. Every release
          should be carefully tested before being put in production, but this is
          especially true for this one.
          + Add : Support for the PERL_OP_PARENT optional feature introduced in
                  perl 5.21.2.
          + Doc : The CAVEATS section now warns about the global slowdown during
                  compilation caused by this pragma.
          + Fix : [RT #97703] : Android support
                  t/51-threads-teardown.t will no longer fail on Android.
                  Thanks Brian Fraser for reporting.
          + Fix : Segfaults in eval in an END block of a Win32 pseudo-fork.
          + Fix : Segfaults during global destruction of a thread or a
                  pseudo-fork.
          + Opt : The global slowdown caused by this module has been greatly
                  reduced.
                  Thanks Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason for reporting and testing the
                  change.

- updated to 0.12
      + Fix : Check functions are now replaced and restored in a thread-safe
              manner, either by using the wrap_op_checker() function from perl
              when it is available (starting from perl 5.16) or by taking the
              OP_REFCNT mutex on older perls.
      + Tst : Author tests are no longer bundled with this distribution.
              They are only made available to authors in the git repository.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 11:11:33 UTC 2013 - werner@suse.de

- Update to version 0.11
  + Doc : POD tweaks and clarifications.
  + Tst : Threads tests will not fail anymore if resources constraints
          prevent the system from creating all the required threads.
  + Tst : Author tests overhaul.
  + Fix : The pragma no longer vivifies the "autovivification" entry
          in the hints hash %^H on perl 5.8.
