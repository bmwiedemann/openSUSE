- Update to 1.2.1
  * feat: Split up MultipartError into more specific exceptions and add HTTP status code hints. All exceptions are subclasses of MultipartError.
  * feat: New parse_form_data(ignore_errors) parameter to throw exceptions in non-strict mode, or suppress exceptions in strict mode. Default behavior does not change (throw in strict-mode, ignore in non-strict mode).
  * feat: New is_form_request(environ) helper.
  * feat: New specialized content_disposition_[un]quote functions.
  * feat: parse_options_header() can now use different unquote functions. The default does not change.
  * fix: parse_form_data() no longer checks the request method and the new is_form_request function also ignores it. All methods can carry parse-able form data, including unknown methods. The only reliable way is to check the Content-Type header, which both functions do.
  * fix: First boundary not detected if separated by chunk border.
  * fix: Allow CRLF in front of first boundary, even in strict mode.
  * fix: Fail fast if first boundary is broken or part of the preamble.
  * fix: Fail if stream ends without finding any boundary at all.
  * fix: Use modern WHATWG quoting rules for field names and filenames (#60). Legacy quoting is still supported as a fallback.
  * fix: MultiDict.get(index=999) should return default value, not throw IndexError.
  * build: Require Python 3.8
