%description
This module provides multiple parsers for RFC-7578 multipart/form-data, both
low-level for framework authors and high-level for WSGI application developers:

* PushMultipartParser: A low-level incremental SansIO <https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/>
  (non-blocking) parser suitable for asyncio and other time or memory constrained
  environments.
* MultipartParser: A streaming parser emitting memory- and disk-buffered
  MultipartPart instances.
* parse_form_data: A helper function to parse both multipart/form-data
  and application/x-www-form-urlencoded form submissions from a
  WSGI environment.
