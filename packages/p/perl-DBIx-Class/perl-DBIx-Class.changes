      * Fixes
          - Adjust tests to account for DBD::SQLite's column_info() no longer
            being case-preserving in recent versions
          - Fix t/storage/replicated.t relying on no-longer-available module
          - Adjust t/53lean_startup.t to work around spurious changes in
            Perl5 core (GH#143)

      * New Features
          - An on_connect rebase_sqlmaker call allowing experimentation with
            non-core SQL generators on a per-$schema-instance basis
            https://is.gd/DBIC_rebase_sqlmaker
          - Automatically detect and use multi-column IN on recent versions of
            libsqlite: ... WHERE ( foo, bar ) IN ( SELECT foo, bar FROM ... )

      * Fixes
          - Fix silent failure to retrieve a primary key (RT#80283) or worse:
            returning an incorrect value (RT#115381) in case a rdbms-side autoinc
            column is declared as PK with the is_auto_increment attribute unset
          - Fix overly-aggressive condition unrolling, corrupting custom ops with
            array arguments (RT#132390)
          - Fix docs on how to properly use Moo(se) in ResultSet's, and fix a
            corner case of ->count not functioning properly when the old recipe
            was being used (GH#105)
          - Fix incorrect ::Storage->_ping() behavior under Sybase (RT#114214)
          - Work around breakage in Hash::Merge by soft-requiring Clone as part
            of the replicated subsystem (RT#124321)

      * Misc
          - DBIC_TRACE_PROFILE=... now uses a ::Storage::Statistics subclass
            DBIx::Class::Storage::Debug::PrettyTrace which properly ships as a
            part of this distrinbution
          - Switch out SQL::Abstract dependency with a slower moving dist
          - Remove Data::Page dependency by inlining its entirety into the core
            DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Pager (RT#130686)

  0.082841 2018-01-29 08:10 (UTC)
      * Test-suite fixup changes only - no reason to upgrade, wait for 0.082850
  
      * Misc
          - Unblock DBD::SQLite (RT#118395)
          - Fix missing ORDER BY leading to failures of t/prefetch/grouped.t
            under upcoming libsqlite (RT#117271)
          - Temporarily disable a non-critical portion of test failing on
            upcoming libsqlite, proper fix coming in 0.082850 (RT#119845)
          - Add test workaround for ( largely irrelevant ) RT#120129
          - Add temporary test-workaround for a devrel of DBD::SQLite
            RT#124227 / https://twitter.com/dbix_class/status/957271153751527424
          - Add workaround for one of the most damaging "improvements" made
            during the modern-perl-era (RT#120827)
          - Fix malformed README file encoding (RT#122028)

  0.082840 2016-06-20 07:02 (UTC)
      * New Features
          - When using non-scalars (e.g. arrays) as literal bind values it is no
            longer necessary to explicitly specify a bindtype (this turned out
            to be a mostly useless overprotection)
  
      * Fixes
          - Ensure leaving an exception stack via Return::MultiLevel or something
            similar produces a large warning
          - Another relatively invasive set of ::FilterColumn changes, covering
            potential data loss (RT#111567). Please run your regression tests!
          - Ensure failing on_connect* / on_disconnect* are dealt with properly,
            notably on_connect* failures now properly abort the entire connect
          - Fix use of ::Schema::Versioned combined with a user-supplied
            $dbh->{HandleError} (GH#101)
          - Fix parsing of DSNs containing driver arguments (GH#99)
          - Fix silencing of exceptions thrown by custom inflate_result() methods
          - Fix complex prefetch when ordering over foreign boolean columns
            ( Pg can't MAX(boolcol) despite being able to ORDER BY boolcol )
          - Fix infinite loop on ->svp_release("nonexistent_savepoint") (GH#97)
          - Fix spurious ROLLBACK statements when a TxnScopeGuard fails a commit
            of a transaction with deferred FK checks: a guard is now inactivated
            immediately before the commit is attempted (RT#107159)
          - Fix the Sybase ASE storage incorrectly attempting to retrieve an
            autoinc value when inserting rows containing blobs (GH#82)
          - Remove spurious exception warping in ::Replicated::execute_reliably
            (RT#113339)
          - Work around unreliable $sth->finish() on INSERT ... RETURNING within
            DBD::Firebird on some compiler/driver combinations (RT#110979)
          - Fix leaktest failures with upcoming version of Sub::Quote
          - Really fix savepoint rollbacks on older DBD::SQLite (fix in 0.082800
            was not sufficient to cover up RT#67843)
  
      * Misc
          - Test suite is now officially certified to work under very high random
            parallelism: META x_parallel_test_certified set to true accordingly
          - Typo fixes from downstream debian packagers (RT#112007)

      * Fixes
          - Fix t/52leaks.t failures on compilerless systems (RT#104429)
          - Fix t/storage/quote_names.t failures on systems with specified Oracle
            test credentials while missing the optional Math::Base36
          - Fix test failures when DBICTEST_SYBASE_DSN is set (unnoticed change
            in error message wording during 0.082800 and a bogus test)
          - Remove largely obsolete test of SQLite view deployment (RT#111916)
  
      * Misc
          - Work around rare test deadlock under heavy parallelism (RT#108390)

      * Fixes
          - Protect destructors from rare but possible double execution, and
            loudly warn the user whenever the problem is encountered (GH#63)
          - Relax the 'self_result_object' argument check in the relationship
            resolution codepath, restoring exotic uses of inflate_result
            http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/dbix-class/2015-January/011876.html
          - Fix updating multiple CLOB/BLOB columns on Oracle
          - Fix exception on complex update/delete under a replicated setup
            http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/dbix-class/2015-January/011903.html
          - Fix uninitialized warnings on empty hashes passed to join/prefetch
            https://github.com/vanstyn/RapidApp/commit/6f41f6e48 and
            http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/dbix-class/2015-February/011921.html
          - Fix hang in t/72pg.t when run against DBD::Pg 3.5.0. The ping()
            implementation changes due to RT#100648 made an alarm() based
            timeout lock-prone.
  
      * Misc
          - Remove warning about potential side effects of RT#79576 (scheduled)
          - Various doc improvements (GH#35, GH#62, GH#66, GH#70, GH#71, GH#72)
          - Depend on newer Moo, to benefit from a safer runtime (RT#93004)
          - Fix intermittent failures in the LeakTracer on 5.18+
          - Fix failures of t/54taint.t on Windows with spaces in the $^X
            executable path (RT#101615)

- updated to 0.082810
     * Fixes
         - Fix incorrect collapsing-parser source being generated in the
           presence of unicode data among the collapse-points
         - Fix endless loop on BareSourcelessResultClass->throw_exception(...)
 
     * Misc
         - Depend on newer SQL::Abstract (fixing overly-aggressive parenthesis
           opener: RT#99503)
         - Depend on newer Moo, fixing some interoperability issues:
           http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/dbix-class/2014-October/011787.html
 
 0.082801 2014-10-05 23:55 (UTC)
     * Known Issues
         - Passing large amounts of objects with stringification overload
           directly to DBIx::Class may result in strange action at a distance
           exceptions. More info (and a workaround description) can be found
           under "Note" at https://metacpan.org/pod/SQL::Abstract#is_plain_value
         - The relationship condition resolution fixes come with the side effect
           of returning more complete data, tripping up *some* users of an
           undocumented but widely used internal function. In particular
           https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91375#txn-1407239
 
     * Notable Changes and Deprecations
         - DBIC::FilterColumn now properly bypasses \'' and \[] literals, just
           like the rest of DBIC
         - DBIC::FilterColumn "from_storage" handler is now invoked on NULLs
           returned from storage
         - find() now throws an exception if some of the supplied values are
           managed by DBIC::FilterColumn (RT#95054)
         - Custom condition relationships are now invoked with a slightly
           different signature (existing coderefs will continue to work)
         - Add extra custom condition coderef attribute 'foreign_values'
           to allow for proper reverse-relationship-like behavior
           (i.e. $result->set_from_related($custom_rel, $foreign_result_object)
         - When in a transaction, DBIC::Ordered now seamlesly handles result
           objects that went out of sync with the storage (RT#96499)
         - CDBICompat::columns() now supports adding columns through supplied
           Class::DBI::Column instances (GH#52)
         - Deprecate { col1 => col2 } expressions in manual {from} structures
           (at some point of time manual {from} will be deprecated entirely)
 
     * Fixes
         - Fix Resultset delete/update affecting *THE ENTIRE TABLE* in cases
           of empty (due to conditions) resultsets with multi-column keys
         - Fix on_connect_* not always firing in some cases - a race condition
           existed between storage accessor setters and the determine_driver
           routines, triggering a connection before the set-cycle is finished
         - Fix collapse being ignored on single-origin selection (RT#95658)
         - Fix incorrect behavior on custom result_class inflators altering
           the amount of returned results
         - Fix failure to detect stable order criteria when in iterator
           mode of a has_many prefetch off a search_related chain
         - Prevent erroneous database hit when accessing prefetched related
           resultsets with no rows
         - Proper exceptions on malformed relationship conditions (RT#92234)
         - Fix incorrect handling of custom relationship conditions returning
           SQLA literal expressions
         - Fix long standing bug with populate() missing data from hashrefs with
           different keysets: http://is.gd/2011_dbic_populate_gotcha (RT#92723)
         - Fix multi-value literal populate not working with simplified bind
           specifications
         - Massively improve the implied resultset condition parsing - now all
           applicable conditions within a resultset should be properly picked
           up by create() and populate()
         - Ensure definitive condition extractor handles bizarre corner cases
           without bombing out (RT#93244)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  7 09:15:18 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.08270
     * Fixes
         - Fix 0.08260 regression in DBD::SQLite bound int handling. Inserted
           data was not affected, but any function <=> integer comparison would
           have failed (originally fixed way back in 0e773352)
         - Fix failure to load DateTime formatter when connecting to Firebird
           over ODBC
 
     * Misc
         - All drivers based on ::Storage::DBI::Firebird::Common now return the
           same sqlt_type value (affects ::DBI::Interbase, ::DBI::Firebird and
           ::DBI::ODBC::Firebird)
 
     * New Features
         - A new zero-to-DBIC style manual: DBIx::Class::Manual::QuickStart
 
     * Notable Changes and Deprecations
         - Explicitly deprecate combination of distinct and selecting a
           non-column via $rs->get_column()
 
     * Fixes
         - More robust handling of circular relationship declarations by loading
           foreign classes less frequently (should resolve issues like
           http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/dbix-class/2013-June/011374.html)
           Note that none of this is a manifestations of a DBIC bug, but rather
           unexpected (but correct) behavior of load-order-dependent (hence
           logically broken) Resultclass hierarchies. In order to deal with this
           DBIC is scaling back a large number of sanity checks, which are to be
           reintroduce pending a better framework for source registration
         - Fix multiple edge cases of complex prefetch combining incorrectly
           with correlated subquery selections
         - Fix multiple edge cases stemming from interaction of a non-selecting
           order_by specification and distinct and/or complex prefetch
         - Fix unbound growth of a resultset during repeated execute/exhaust
           cycles (GH#29)
         - Work around (and be very vocal about the fact) when DBIC encounters
           an exception object with broken string overloading
         - Clarify ambiguous behavior of distinct when used with ResultSetColumn
           i.e. $rs->search({}, { distinct => 1 })->get_column (...)
         - Setting quote_names propagates to SQL::Translator when producing
           SQLite DDL (it is one of the few producers *NOT* quoting by default)
         - Fix incorrect binding of large integers on old versions of
           DBD::SQLite (now DBIC simply always binds SQLite ints as BIGINT)
         - Silence (harmless) warnings on recent DBD::SQLite versions, when
           inserting/updating large integers on 32bit ivsize systems (RT#76395)
         - Back out self-cleaning from DBIx::Class::Carp for the time being
           (as a side effect fixes RT#86267)
         - Fix incorrect internal use of implicit list context in copy()
         - Fix 0.08250 regression in driver determination when DBI_DSN is used
         - Tests no longer fail if $ENV{DBI_DSN} is set
         - Throw clearer exception on ->new_related() with a non-existent
           relationship
         - Fix incorrect parethesis unroll with multicolumn in, (never noticed
           before fixing false positive in SQLA::Test 1.77)
         - Fix t/storage/replicated.t class loading problem
         - Stop using the deprecated Class::MOP::load_class()
         - Fix warning in t/54taint.t with explicitly unset PERL5LIB (RT#91972)
         - Fix t/54taint.t failing under a local::lib with installed earlier
           DBIC version (RT#92486)
