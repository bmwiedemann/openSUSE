  <title>Pytest plugin for testing console scripts</title>
  <description>Pytest-console-scripts is a `Pytest`_ plugin for testing python scripts
installed via ``console_scripts`` entry point of ``setup.py``. It can run the
scripts under test in a separate process or using the interpreter that's
running the test suite.  The former mode ensures that the script will run in an
environment that is identical to normal execution whereas the latter one allows
much quicker test runs during development while simulating the real runs as
much as possible.
