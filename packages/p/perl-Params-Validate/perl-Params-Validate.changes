  1.22    2016-02-13
  
  - Fixed a bug when a callback failed but did not die. The resulting error
    message had a pointless colon in it. Reported by Slaven Rezic. RT #111036.
  
  - Made the pure Perl version use Carp's croak rather than confess. The XS
    version has never included a stack trace in errors. You can use the on_fail
    setting to get a stack trace if you prefer. Reported by Slaven Rezic. RT
    #111036.
  
  - The pure Perl code now uses "(unknown)" when it cannot determine the sub
    that failed, instead of "N/A". Reported by Slaven Rezic. RT #111036.
  
  - Documented the PARAMS_VALIDATE_IMPLEMENTATION environment
    variable. Requested by Slaven Rezic. RT #111035.

- updated to 1.20
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Params-Validate/Changes

  1.20    2015-06-28
  
  - Fixed a bug with stack handling in the XS code. If a callback sub caused
    Perl to reallocate the stack this could trigger weird errors of the form
    "Bizarre copy of ARRAY" from Perl itself. Fixed by Noel Maddy. GH #5.
  
  - Fixed use of inlining in the XS code to work when "gcc -std=c89" is
    specified. Fixed by Vincent Pit. GH #6.
  
  - Previously, Params::Validate would eagerly stringify all values it was
    validating, even though this stringification was only needed for error
    messages that are used when a parameter fails. For objects which overload
    stringification and do real work, this added an unnecessary
    slowdown. Stringification is now delayed until it is needed. Reported by
    Klaus. RT #105326.

- updated to 1.18

  1.18    2015-02-13
  
  - We no longer attempt to save and restore an existing $SIG{__DIE__} hook
    before calling a validation callback. This uses undocumented black magic
    poking at the Perl interpreter guts, which seems to cause sporadic
    segfaults. Reported by David Wheeler with help from Andreas Koenig. RT
    #102112.
  
  
  1.17    2015-01-08
  
  - More XS fixes. Simplified how we localize $@ in the XS code and fixed error
    with Perls compiled with -DDEBUGGING. Reported by Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ. RT #101416.
  
  
  1.16    2015-01-07
  
  - The changes in 1.14 introduced a memory leak any time a callback was called
    and it did not throw an error that was a reference. This affected the
    DateTime constructor and probably many other things. Reported by David
    Kayal. RT #101380.
  
  
  1.15    2015-01-01
  
  - No changes from 1.14
  
  
  1.14    2014-12-20 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Callbacks can now die to provide a custom error message or exception
    object. Requested by multiple people. Addresses RT #95701 and will allow
    MooseX::Params::Validate to use messages provided by the type object.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 30 08:15:16 UTC 2014 - ncutler@suse.com

- updated to 1.13 (excerpt from upstream Changes file):

1.13    2014-06-28
- Fix my brain damage so that this code compiles with Perl 5.14.

1.12    2014-06-27
- Temporarily skip tests that use Readonly with Readonly 1.50+ until various
  bugs are worked out in Readonly.

1.11    2014-06-26
- Fixes for MSVC compilation. Patch by J.R. Mash. PR #1.

1.10    2014-05-11
- Require Readonly 1.03+ and Scalar::Util 1.20 for testing with
  Readonly. AFAICT, earlier versions of Readonly worked very differently,
  and/or this is related to Scalar::Util. Either way, this test isn't that
  important anyway. RT #95402.

1.09    2014-05-04
- A call to validate() where the spec was a reference to a Readonly hash would
  segfault. Reported by Salvatore Bonaccorso. RT #80572.
- When using the XS implementation, attempting to validate parameters with
  tainted values would cause an "Insecure dependency in eval_sv() while
  running with -T switch" exception from Perl *if the validation failed*. This
  is fixed, but only for Perl 5.14+. Older Perls do not include the necessary
  XS API. RT #70174.
- Fixed some potential segfaults from the XS implementation including the one
  reported by Анатолий Гришаев in RT #50412. However, the XS code in general
  is pretty crufty and tends to assume that values which could be NULL aren't.
- Fixed bad example of state() in POD. Reported by Salvatore Bonaccorso. RT
  #80250.

1.08    2013-06-07
- The handling of defaults in the XS version of validate_pos was broken. The
  default were simply pushed into the returned array, rather than being
  explicitly stored in the right index based on the order of the specs passed
  to validate_pos(). RT #83780.

1.07    2012-10-26
- Params::Validate's XS implementation would overwrite $@ when validation subs
  were called. Patch by Salvador Fandino. RT #80124.
- The use of state in the POD was broken. It only works with scalars. Reported
  by Salvatore Bonaccorso. RT #80250.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 13 02:34:45 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.06
- Shut up warnings when XS is loaded on older 5.8.x Perl versions. Reported by
  Aaron James Trevena. RT #74742.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 10 02:34:18 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.05
  * The XS code had a code path where it could pass the contents of a Perl
    variable as the first argument to the XS croak() subroutine. This subroutine
    is like printf(), and should receive a format string as its first
    argument. According to RT #74777, this can lead to segfaults on some systems.

    This could in theory be a security bug, but it's very unlikely that
    untrusted user input could end up being passed to this croak(). It is called
    when a spec specifies a "depend" value on another parameter. The value of
    the "depend" parameter was passed in the first argument to croak().
  1.04    2012-02-08
  * Use the latest Module::XSOrPP dzil plugin to generate a saner Build.PL. No
    need update if you're using an earlier version.
  * This release uses Module::Implementation to handle loading the XS or pure
    Perl implementation of Params::Validate.
  1.02    2012-02-06
  * The previous release never loaded the XS implementation, even if it had been
    compiled.
  * With newer versions of Perl, the pure Perl implementation treated regexp
    objects differently than the XS implementation. They should be treated as
    belonging to the SCALARREF type for backwards compatibility.
  * These two bugs combined managed to break the test suites of a number of
    modules on CPAN. This release should fix them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  6 10:06:56 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.01
- The generated Build.PL detects whether or not the machine it's run on has a
  working compiler, and disables XS automatically if it doesn't. Fixes RT
  #44719.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 26 07:37:31 UTC 2011 - vcizek@novell.com

- update to 0.98
- Attribute::Params::Validate's $VERSION regressed in 0.96. 
  It's now manually set to 1.07.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 21 12:47:54 UTC 2011 - vcizek@novell.com

- update to 0.97
- The XS version of the code always called Carp::confess, regardless of
  whether you provided your own on_fail callback. Reported by Scott Bolte. RT
  #66359.
- There were a couple spots that called eval without localizing $@ first. RT
  #58087.
- The parameters for each key validation (can, isa, regex) are now checked,
  and an error is thrown if any of the keys are not valid. Basically, we
  validate the validation spec. Based on a patch by Andreas Faafeng. RT
  #57831.
- This module now requires Perl 5.8.1.
- Switched to version 2.0 of the Artistic License.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Jan 25 13:40:15 CET 2010 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 0.94
 * Removed the Makefile.PL entirely. If it was used then the XS 
   code was never built, because I'm using the Module::Build XS 
   layout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 19 16:26:06 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 0.91
 * The fix for handling @_'s readonly-ness introduced a refcounting
   bug. One symptom of this was a failing Log::Dispatch test.
 * Make the XS version of Params::Validate recognize regexp objects
   with Perl 5.11.0-to-be.
 * With the XS version, when you passed @_ directly to validate() and
   then got a hash reference back, the values of that hash reference
   would be marked readonly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  1 15:35:49 CET 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 0.89
 * With validation turned off, the pure Perl version incorrectly
   ignored an odd number of parameters when a hash was expected (no
   validation still does the bare minimum of checks needed to set
   defaults).
 * Added pod & pod coverage tests.
 * Modernized test suite to use Test::More and fixed some test suite
   bugs along the way.
 * Attribute::Params::Validate would die when given a ValidatePos
   attribute containing one element.
 * More tests are skipped on 5.6.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  8 14:28:02 CET 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 0.88
  * The XS version threw an error when it attempted to do "isa" or 
    "can" validation on a value that was not a string or object, 
    such as undef or a number.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 25 18:24:00 CET 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 0.87
  * When determining the caller of a function in the XS version, use
    Perl's caller() function rather than CopSTASHPV. The caller()
    function apparently ignores the DB package, whereas the latter
    doesn't. This caused validate_options to be ignored when running
    under profiling (and probably the debugger as well).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  5 11:39:54 CEST 2006 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 0.86
  * Only turn inlining on if __GNUC__ is defined
  * Removed spaces in #define, #ifdef, etc
  * If a type is specified as a string ('SCALAR', not SCALAR), 
    this is now caught and a useful error is thrown.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 29 14:09:21 CEST 2006 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 0.84 
  * XS version uses Carp::confess instead of Carp::croak
