  <title>Attributes with aliases for constructor arguments.</title>
  <description>If you've ever wanted to be able to call an attribute any number of things
while you're passing arguments to your object constructor, Now You Can.

The primary motivator is that I have some attributes that were named
inconsistently, and I wanted to rename them without breaking backwards
compatibility with my existing API.</description>
