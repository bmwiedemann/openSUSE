%description
The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using https schemed
URLs with LWP. This module is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to
access sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.

If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's 'ssl_opts', and
neither 'SSL_ca_file' nor 'SSL_ca_path' is set, then 'SSL_ca_file' is
implied to be the one provided by Mozilla::CA. If the Mozilla::CA module
isn't available SSL requests will fail. Either install this module, set up
an alternative 'SSL_ca_file' or disable hostname verification.

This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was unbundled
in v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the
CPAN tool-chain. Applications that need https support can just declare
their dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know
what underlying modules to install.
