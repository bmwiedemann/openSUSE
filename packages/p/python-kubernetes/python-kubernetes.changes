- Update to version 8.0.1
  + Bug Fix:
    - Refresh GCP auth tokens on API retrieval
    - Fix kubeconfig loading failure when server uri contains trailing slash
  + Security Fix:
    - Bump urllib3 version to pick up security fix for CVE-2018-20060
- Update to version 8.0.0
  + New Feature:
    - Add utility to create API resource from yaml file
- Update to version 8.0.0b1
  + Bug Fix:
    - Update ExecProvider to use safe\_get() to tolerate kube-config file that sets
  `args: null` and `env: null`
    - Properly deserialize API server's response when posting a deployment rollback
  + API Change:
    - dry-run: CREATE/UPDATE/PATCH methods now support dryRun parameter
- Update to version 8.0.0a1
  + New Feature:
    - Add exec-plugins support in kubeconfig
  + Bug Fix:
    - Fix reading kubeconfig data with bytes in Python 3
  + API Change:
    - Upon receiving a LIST request with expired continue token, the apiserver now returns a continue token together with the 410 "the from parameter is too old " error. If the client does not care about getting a list from a consistent snapshot, the client can use this token to continue listing from the next key, but the returned chunk will be from the latest snapshot
    - Introduces autoscaling/v2beta2 and custom\_metrics/v1beta2, which implement metric selectors for Object and Pods metrics, as well as allowing AverageValue targets on Objects, similar to External metrics
    - Create "coordination.k8s.io" api group with "Lease" api in it
    - Added support to restore a volume from a volume snapshot data source: adds TypedLocalObjectReference in the core API and adds DataSource in PersistentVolumeClaimSpec
    - ProcMount added to SecurityContext and AllowedProcMounts added to
      PodSecurityPolicy to allow paths in the container's /proc to not be masked
    - Support both directory and block device for local volume plugin FileSystem
      VolumeMode
    - SCTP is now supported as additional protocol (alpha) alongside TCP and UDP in
      Pod, Service, Endpoint, and NetworkPolicy
    - RuntimeClass is a new API resource for defining different classes of runtimes
      that may be used to run containers in the cluster. Pods can select a
      RunitmeClass to use via the RuntimeClassName field. This feature is in alpha,
      and the RuntimeClass feature gate must be enabled in order to use it
    - The PodShareProcessNamespace feature to configure PID namespace sharing within
      a pod has been promoted to beta
    - To address the possibility dry-run requests overwhelming admission webhooks that rely on side effects and a reconciliation mechanism, a new field is being added to admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.MutatingWebhookConfiguration so that webhooks can explicitly register as having dry-run support. If a dry-run request is made on a resource that triggers a non dry-run supporting webhook, the request will be completely rejected, with "400: Bad Request". Additionally, a new field is being added to the admission.k8s.io/v1beta1.AdmissionReview API object, exposing to webhooks whether or not the request being reviewed is a dry-run
    - Add custom object status and scale api
    - dry-run: DELETE operations now support dryRun parameter
    - Default extensions/v1beta1 Deployment's ProgressDeadlineSeconds to MaxInt32
- Update to version 7.0.0
  + New Features:
    - Add support for refreshing Azure tokens
- Update to version 7.0.0b1
  + New Features:
    - Add Azure support to authentication loading
- Update to version 7.0.0a1
  + Breaking Change:
    - **ACTION REQUIRED** Rename the currently being-used `async` parameter to `async_req` to support Python 3.7 because it's a reserved keyword in Python 3.7
  + Bug Fix:
    - Watch now properly deserializes custom resource objects and updates resource version
    - `idp-certificate-authority-data` in kubeconfig is now optional instead of required for OIDC token refresh
  + API Change:
    - ApiextensionsV1beta1Api: Add PATCH and GET to custom_resource_definition_status
    - ApiregistrationV1Api and ApiregistrationV1beta1Api: Add PATCH and GET to api_service_status
    - CertificatesV1beta1Api: Add PATCH and GET to certificate_signing_request_status
    - SchedulingV1beta1Api: Promote priority_class to beta
    - PodSecurityPolicy now supports restricting hostPath volume mounts to be readOnly and under specific path prefixes
    - The Sysctls experimental feature has been promoted to beta (enabled by default via the `Sysctls` feature flag). PodSecurityPolicy and Pod objects now have fields for specifying and controlling sysctls. Alpha sysctl annotations will be ignored by 1.11+ kubelets. All alpha sysctl annotations in existing deployments must be converted to API fields to be effective.
    - Add CRD Versioning with NOP converter
    - Volume topology aware dynamic provisioning
    - Fixed incorrect OpenAPI schema for CustomResourceDefinition objects with a validation schema
- Update to version 6.0.0
    - Config loader now supports OIDC auth
    - Bug fix: fix expiry time checking in API token refresh
- Update to version 6.0.0b1
    - Update to Kubernetes 1.10 cluster
    - Config loader now raises exception on duplicated name in kubeconfig
  + API change:
    - CustomObjectsApi: Add PATCH to CustomObjectsApi
    - Promoting the apiregistration.k8s.io (aggregation) to GA (ApiregistrationV1Api)
    - CoreV1Api: remove /proxy legacy API (deprecated since kubernetes v1.2). Use the /proxy subresources on objects that support HTTP proxying
    - The `PodSecurityPolicy` API has been moved to the `policy/v1beta1` API group. The `PodSecurityPolicy` API in the `extensions/v1beta1` API group is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Authorizations for using pod security policy resources should change to reference the `policy` API group after upgrading to 1.11
    - StorageV1beta1Api: Introduce new `VolumeAttachment` API Object
    - V1FlexPersistentVolumeSource: PersistentVolume flexVolume sources can now reference secrets in a namespace other than the PersistentVolumeClaim's namespace
    - ACTION REQUIRED: VolumeScheduling and LocalPersistentVolume features are beta and enabled by default.  The PersistentVolume NodeAffinity alpha annotation is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
    - Allows HorizontalPodAutoscaler to use global metrics not associated with any Kubernetes object (for example metrics from a hoster service running outside of Kubernetes cluster)
    - v1.Pod now has a field to configure whether a single process namespace should be shared between all containers in a pod. This feature is in alpha preview.
    - delete_namespaced_service() now takes an required body (delete option) parameter. Refactor service storage to remove registry wrapper
  + Documentation update:
    - Never let cluster-scoped resources skip webhooks
    - Clarify that ListOptions.Timeout is not conditional on inactivity
    - Indicate endpoint subsets are an optional field

    validating. The kinds have changed completely and old code must be ported to
