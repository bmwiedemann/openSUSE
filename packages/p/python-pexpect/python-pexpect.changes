-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 24 15:49:37 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.6.0:
  * The pxssh.login() method now supports an ssh_config parameter,
    which can be used to specify a file path to an SSH config file (PR
    #490).
  * Improved compatability for the crlf parameter of PopenSpawn (PR
    #493)
  * Fixed an issue in read timeout handling when using spawn and
    fdspawn with the use_poll parameter (PR #492).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 19 11:58:18 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Fix typo and make sure the tests will pass

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 14 17:14:36 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * enable tests

- update to version 4.5.0:
  * spawn and fdspawn now have a use_poll parameter. If this is True,
    they will use select.poll() instead of select.select(). poll()
    allows file descriptors above 1024, but it must be explicitly
    enabled due to compatibility concerns (PR #474).
  * The pxssh.login() method has several new and changed options:
    + The option password_regex allows changing the password prompt
      regex, for servers that include password: in a banner before
      reaching a prompt (PR #468).
    + login() now allows for setting up SSH tunnels to be requested
      once logged in to the remote server. This option is ssh_tunnels
      (PR #473). The structure should be like this:
        {
          'local': ['2424:localhost:22'],   # Local SSH tunnels
          'remote': ['2525:localhost:22'],  # Remote SSH tunnels
          'dynamic': [8888],                # Dynamic/SOCKS tunnels
        }

    + The option spawn_local_ssh=False allows subsequent logins from
      the remote session and treats the session as if it was local (PR
      #472).
    + Setting sync_original_prompt=False will prevent changing the
      prompt to something unique, in case the remote server is
      sensitive to new lines at login (PR #468).
    + If ssh_key=True is passed, the SSH client forces forwarding the
      authentication agent to the remote server instead of providing a
      key (PR #473).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 10 17:29:45 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 4.4.0:
  * PopenSpawn now has a preexec_fn parameter, like spawn and
    subprocess.Popen, for a function to be called in the child process
    before executing the new command. Like in Popen, this works only
    in POSIX, and can cause issues if your application also uses
    threads (PR #460).
  * Significant performance improvements when processing large amounts
    of data (PR #464).
  * Ensure that spawn.closed gets set by close(), and improve an
    example for passing SIGWINCH through to a child process (PR #466).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 16 23:13:25 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.3.1:
  * When launching bash for pexpect.replwrap, load the system bashrc
    from a couple of different common locations (PR #457), and then
    unset the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable, which can interfere
    with the prompt we’re expecting (PR #459).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 10 22:59:10 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 4.3.0:
  * The async= parameter to integrate with asyncio has become async_=
    (PR #431), as async is becoming a Python keyword from Python
    3.6. Pexpect will still recognise async as an alternative
    spelling.
  * Similarly, the module pexpect.async became pexpect._async (PR
    #450). This module is not part of the public API.
  * Fix problems with asyncio objects closing file descriptors during
    garbage collection (#347, PR #376).
  * Set the .pid attribute of a PopenSpawn object (PR #417).
  * Fix passing Windows paths to PopenSpawn (PR #446).
  * PopenSpawn on Windows can pass string commands through to Popen
    without splitting them into a list (PR #447).
  * Stop shlex trying to read from stdin when PopenSpawn is passed
    cmd=None (#433, PR #434).
  * Ensure that an error closing a Pexpect spawn object raises a
    Pexpect error, rather than a Ptyprocess error (#383, PR #386).
  * Cleaned up invalid backslash escape sequences in strings (PR #430,
    PR #445).
  * The pattern for a password prompt in pexpect.pxssh changed from
    password to password: (PR #452).
  * Correct docstring for using unicode with spawn (PR #395).
  * Various other improvements to documentation.

Wed Apr 19 17:57:01 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Implement single-spec version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 22:52:06 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- update to version 4.2.1:
  * Fix to allow running ``env`` in replwrap-ed bash.
  * Raise more informative exception from pxssh if it fails to connect.
  * Change ``passmass`` example to not log passwords entered.
- update to version 4.2.0:
  * Change: When an "env" parameter is specified to the
    :class:`~.spawn` or :class:`~.run` family of calls containing a
    value for "PATH", its value is used to discover the target
    executable from a relative path, rather than the current process's
    environment "PATH".  This mirrors the behavior of
    :func:`subprocess.Popen` in the standard library (:ghissue:`348`).
  * Regression: Re-introduce capability for :meth:`read_nonblocking`
    in class :class:`fdspawn` as previously supported in version 3.3
    (:ghissue:`359`).
- update to version 4.1.0:
  * No upstream changelog
- update to version 4.0.1:
  * Integration with :mod:`asyncio`: passing "async=True" to :meth:`~.spawn.expect`,
    :meth:`~.spawn.expect_exact` or :meth:`~.spawn.expect_list` will make them return a
    coroutine. You can get the result using "yield from", or wrap it in an
    :class:`asyncio.Task`. This allows the event loop to do other things while
    waiting for output that matches a pattern.
  * Experimental support for Windows (with some caveats)—see :ref:`windows`.
  * Enhancement: allow method as callbacks of argument "events" for
    :func:`pexpect.run` (:ghissue:`176`).
  * It is now possible to call :meth:`~.spawn.wait` multiple times, or after a process
    is already determined to be terminated without raising an exception
    (:ghpull:`211`).
  * New :class:`pexpect.spawn` keyword argument, "dimensions=(rows, columns)"
    allows setting terminal screen dimensions before launching a program
    (:ghissue:`122`).
  * Fix regression that prevented executable, but unreadable files from
    being found when not specified by absolute path -- such as
    /usr/bin/sudo (:ghissue:`104`).
  * Fixed regression when executing pexpect with some prior releases of
    the multiprocessing module where stdin has been closed (:ghissue:`86`).
  * Deprecated "pexpect.screen" and "pexpect.ANSI". Please use other packages
    such as `pyte <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyte>`__ to emulate a terminal.
  * Removed the independent top-level modules ("pxssh fdpexpect FSM screen ANSI")
    which were installed alongside Pexpect. These were moved into the Pexpect
    package in 3.0, but the old names were left as aliases.
  * Child processes created by Pexpect no longer ignore SIGHUP by default: the
    "ignore_sighup" parameter of :class:`pexpect.spawn` defaults to False. To
    get the old behaviour, pass "ignore_sighup=True".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 27 14:24:59 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 3.3:
  * Added a mechanism to wrap REPLs, or shells, in an object which can
    conveniently be used to send commands and wait for the output
    (:mod:`pexpect.replwrap`).
  * Fixed issue where pexpect would attempt to execute a directory because
    it has the 'execute' bit set (:ghissue:`37`).
  * Removed the ``pexpect.psh`` module. This was never documented, and we found
    no evidence that people use it. The new :mod:`pexpect.replwrap` module
    provides a more flexible alternative.
  * Fixed ``TypeError: got <type 'str'> ('\r\n') as pattern`` in
    :meth:`spawnu.readline`
    method (:ghissue:`67`).
  * Fixed issue where EOF was not correctly detected in :meth:`~.interact`,
    causing a repeating loop of output on Linux, and blocking before EOF
    on BSD and Solaris (:ghissue:`49`).
  * Several Solaris (SmartOS) bugfixes, preventing :exc:`IOError` exceptions,
    especially when used with cron(1) (:ghissue:`44`).
  * Added new keyword argument ``echo=True`` for :class:`spawn`.  On SVR4-like
    systems, the method :meth:`~.isatty` will always return *False*: the child
    pty does not appear as a terminal.  Therefore, :meth:`~.setecho`,
    :meth:`~.getwinsize
  * Fix exception handling from :func:`select.select` on Python 2 (:ghpull:`38`)
    This was accidentally broken in the previous release when it was fixed for
    Python 3.
  * Removed a workaround for ``TIOCSWINSZ`` on very old systems, which was
    causing issues on some BSD systems (:ghpull:`40`).
  * Fixed an issue with exception handling in :mod:`~pexpect.pxssh`
    (:ghpull:`43`)

  * Fix handling exceptions from :func:`select.select` on Python 3
  * A new :ref:`unicode API <unicode>` was introduced.
  * Python 3 is now supported, using a single codebase.
  * Pexpect now requires at least Python 2.6 or 3.2.
  * The modules other than pexpect, such as :mod:`pexpect.fdpexpect` and
  * Ignoring ``SIGHUP`` is now optional
