  <title>OpenSSL support for LWP</title>
  <description>This Perl module provides support for the HTTPS protocol under LWP, to
allow an 'LWP::UserAgent' object to perform GET, HEAD and POST requests.
Please see LWP for more information on POST requests.

The 'Crypt::SSLeay' package provides 'Net::SSL', which is loaded by
'LWP::Protocol::https' for https requests and provides the necessary SSL
glue.

This distribution also makes following deprecated modules available:

    Crypt::SSLeay::CTX
    Crypt::SSLeay::Conn
    Crypt::SSLeay::X509

Work on Crypt::SSLeay has been continued only to provide https support for
the LWP (libwww-perl) libraries.</description>
