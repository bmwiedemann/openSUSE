Thu Jul 11 10:38:36 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.11.2 (bsc#1224474, CVE-2024-1968):
  * Redirects to non-HTTP protocols are no longer followed.
    Please, see the 23j4-mw76-5v7h security advisory for more
    information. (:issue:`457`)
  * The Authorization header is now dropped on redirects to a
    different scheme (http:// or https://) or port, even if the
    domain is the same. Please, see the 4qqq-9vqf-3h3f security
    advisory for more information.
  * When using system proxy settings that are different for
    http:// and https://, redirects to a different URL scheme
    will now also trigger the corresponding change in proxy
    settings for the redirected request. Please, see the
    jm3v-qxmh-hxwv security advisory for more information.
    (:issue:`767`)
  * :attr:`Spider.allowed_domains
    <scrapy.Spider.allowed_domains>` is now enforced for all
    requests, and not only requests from spider callbacks.
  * :func:`~scrapy.utils.iterators.xmliter_lxml` no longer
    resolves XML entities.
  * defusedxml is now used to make
    :class:`scrapy.http.request.rpc.XmlRpcRequest` more secure.
  * Restored support for brotlipy_, which had been dropped in
    Scrapy 2.11.1 in favor of brotli. (:issue:`6261`)  Note
    brotlipy is deprecated, both in Scrapy and upstream. Use
    brotli instead if you can.
  * Make :setting:`METAREFRESH_IGNORE_TAGS` ["noscript"] by
    default. This prevents :class:`~scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.
    redirect.MetaRefreshMiddleware` from following redirects that
    would not be followed by web browsers with JavaScript
    enabled.
  * During :ref:`feed export <topics-feed-exports>`, do not close
    the underlying file from :ref:`built-in post-processing
    plugins <builtin-plugins>`.
  * :class:`LinkExtractor
    <scrapy.linkextractors.lxmlhtml.LxmlLinkExtractor>` now
    properly applies the unique and canonicalize parameters.
  * Do not initialize the scheduler disk queue if
    :setting:`JOBDIR` is an empty string.
  * Fix :attr:`Spider.logger <scrapy.Spider.logger>` not logging
    custom extra information.
  * robots.txt files with a non-UTF-8 encoding no longer prevent
    parsing the UTF-8-compatible (e.g. ASCII) parts of the
    document.
  * :meth:`scrapy.http.cookies.WrappedRequest.get_header` no
    longer raises an exception if default is None.
    :func:`scrapy.utils.response.get_base_url` to determine the
    base URL of a given :class:`~scrapy.http.Response`.
  * :class:`~scrapy.selector.Selector` now uses
    :func:`scrapy.utils.response.get_base_url` to determine the
    base URL of a given :class:`~scrapy.http.Response`.
    (:issue:`6265`)
  * The :meth:`media_to_download` method of :ref:`media pipelines
    <topics-media-pipeline>` now logs exceptions before stripping
    them.
  * When passing a callback to the :command:`parse` command,
    build the callback callable with the right signature.
  * Add a FAQ entry about :ref:`creating blank requests <faq-
    blank-request>`.
  * Document that :attr:`scrapy.selector.Selector.type` can be
    "json".
  * Make builds reproducible.
  * Packaging and test fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  9 15:21:20 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to v2.6.2
  Security bug fix:
  * When HttpProxyMiddleware processes a request with proxy metadata, and that proxy metadata includes proxy credentials,
    HttpProxyMiddleware sets the Proxy-Authentication header, but only if that header is not already set.
  * There are third-party proxy-rotation downloader middlewares that set different proxy metadata every time they process a request.
  * Because of request retries and redirects, the same request can be processed by downloader middlewares more than once,
    including both HttpProxyMiddleware and any third-party proxy-rotation downloader middleware.
  * These third-party proxy-rotation downloader middlewares could change the proxy metadata of a request to a new value,
    but fail to remove the Proxy-Authentication header from the previous value of the proxy metadata, causing the credentials of one
    proxy to be sent to a different proxy.
  * To prevent the unintended leaking of proxy credentials, the behavior of HttpProxyMiddleware is now as follows when processing a request:
    + If the request being processed defines proxy metadata that includes credentials, the Proxy-Authorization header is always updated
    to feature those credentials.
    + If the request being processed defines proxy metadata without credentials, the Proxy-Authorization header is removed unless
    it was originally defined for the same proxy URL.
    + To remove proxy credentials while keeping the same proxy URL, remove the Proxy-Authorization header.
    + If the request has no proxy metadata, or that metadata is a falsy value (e.g. None), the Proxy-Authorization header is removed.
    + It is no longer possible to set a proxy URL through the proxy metadata but set the credentials through the Proxy-Authorization header.
    Set proxy credentials through the proxy metadata instead.
  * Also fixes the following regressions introduced in 2.6.0:
    + CrawlerProcess supports again crawling multiple spiders (issue 5435, issue 5436)
    + Installing a Twisted reactor before Scrapy does (e.g. importing twisted.internet.reactor somewhere at the module level)
    no longer prevents Scrapy from starting, as long as a different reactor is not specified in TWISTED_REACTOR (issue 5525, issue 5528)
    + Fixed an exception that was being logged after the spider finished under certain conditions (issue 5437, issue 5440)
    + The --output/-o command-line parameter supports again a value starting with a hyphen (issue 5444, issue 5445)
    + The scrapy parse -h command no longer throws an error (issue 5481, issue 5482)

Thu Oct  7 14:35:57 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.5.1, Security bug fix
  * boo#1191446, CVE-2021-41125
  * If you use HttpAuthMiddleware (i.e. the http_user and
    http_pass spider attributes) for HTTP authentication,
    any request exposes your credentials to the request
    target.
  * To prevent unintended exposure of authentication
    credentials to unintended domains, you must now
    additionally set a new, additional spider attribute,
    http_auth_domain, and point it to the specific domain to
    which the authentication credentials must be sent.
  * If the http_auth_domain spider attribute is not set, the
    domain of the first request will be considered the HTTP
    authentication target, and authentication credentials
    will only be sent in requests targeting that domain.
  * If you need to send the same HTTP authentication
    credentials to multiple domains, you can use
    w3lib.http.basic_auth_header instead to set the value of
    the Authorization header of your requests.
  * If you really want your spider to send the same HTTP
    authentication credentials to any domain, set the
    http_auth_domain spider attribute to None.
  * Finally, if you are a user of scrapy-splash, know that
    this version of Scrapy breaks compatibility with
    scrapy-splash 0.7.2 and earlier. You will need to upgrade
    scrapy-splash to a greater version for it to continue to
    work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 28 09:29:08 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.5.0:
  * Official Python 3.9 support
  * Experimental HTTP/2 support
  * New get_retry_request() function to retry requests from spider
    callbacks
  * New headers_received signal that allows stopping downloads
    early
  * New Response.protocol attribute
- Release 2.4.1:
  * Fixed feed exports overwrite support
  * Fixed the asyncio event loop handling, which could make code
    hang
  * Fixed the IPv6-capable DNS resolver CachingHostnameResolver
    for download handlers that call reactor.resolve
  * Fixed the output of the genspider command showing placeholders
    instead of the import part of the generated spider module
    (issue 4874)
- Release 2.4.0:
  * Python 3.5 support has been dropped.
  * The file_path method of media pipelines can now access the
    source item.
  * This allows you to set a download file path based on item data.
  * The new item_export_kwargs key of the FEEDS setting allows to
    define keyword parameters to pass to item exporter classes.
  * You can now choose whether feed exports overwrite or append to
    the output file.
  * For example, when using the crawl or runspider commands, you
    can use the -O option instead of -o to overwrite the output
    file.
  * Zstd-compressed responses are now supported if zstandard is
    installed.
  * In settings, where the import path of a class is required, it
    is now possible to pass a class object instead.
- Release 2.3.0:
  * Feed exports now support Google Cloud Storage as a storage
    backend
  * The new FEED_EXPORT_BATCH_ITEM_COUNT setting allows to deliver
    output items in batches of up to the specified number of items.
  * It also serves as a workaround for delayed file delivery,
    which causes Scrapy to only start item delivery after the
    crawl has finished when using certain storage backends (S3,
    FTP, and now GCS).
  * The base implementation of item loaders has been moved into a
    separate library, itemloaders, allowing usage from outside
    Scrapy and a separate release schedule
- Release 2.2.1:
  * The startproject command no longer makes unintended changes to
    the permissions of files in the destination folder, such as
    removing execution permissions.

Thu Feb 14 11:48:09 UTC 2019 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to 1.6.0 (2019-01-30):
  + Highlights:
    * better Windows support
    * Python 3.7 compatibility
    * big documentation improvements, including a switch from
      .extract_first() + .extract() API to .get() + .getall() API
    * feed exports, FilePipeline and MediaPipeline improvements
    * better extensibility: :signal:`item_error` and
      :signal:`request_reached_downloader` signals; from_crawler
      support for feed exporters, feed storages and dupefilters.
    * scrapy.contracts fixes and new features
    * telnet console security improvements, first released as a
      backport in :ref:`release-1.5.2`
    * clean-up of the deprecated code
    * various bug fixes, small new features and usability
      improvements across the codebase.
  + Selector API changes
  + While these are not changes in Scrapy itself, but rather in the
    parsel library which Scrapy uses for xpath/css selectors, these
    changes are worth mentioning here. Scrapy now depends on parsel
    >= 1.5, and Scrapy documentation is updated to follow recent
    parsel API conventions.
  + Most visible change is that .get() and .getall() selector
    methods are now preferred over .extract_first() and .extract().
    We feel that these new methods result in a more concise and
    readable code. See :ref:`old-extraction-api` for more details.
  + Note
  + There are currently no plans to deprecate .extract() and
    .extract_first() methods.
  + Another useful new feature is the introduction of
    Selector.attrib and SelectorList.attrib properties, which make
    it easier to get attributes of HTML elements. See
    :ref:`selecting-attributes`.
  + CSS selectors are cached in parsel >= 1.5, which makes them
    faster when the same CSS path is used many times. This is very
    common in case of Scrapy spiders: callbacks are usually called
    several times, on different pages.
    * If you're using custom Selector or SelectorList subclasses, a
      backwards incompatible change in parsel may affect your code.
      See parsel changelog for a detailed description, as well as
      for the full list of improvements.
  + Telnet console
    * Backwards incompatible: Scrapy's telnet console now requires
      username and password. See :ref:`topics-telnetconsole` for
      more details. This change fixes a security issue; see
      :ref:`release-1.5.2` release notes for details.
  + New extensibility features
    * from_crawler support is added to feed exporters and feed
      storages. This, among other things, allows to access Scrapy
      settings from custom feed storages and exporters
      (:issue:`1605`, :issue:`3348`).
    * from_crawler support is added to dupefilters (:issue:`2956`);
      this allows to access e.g. settings or a spider from a
      dupefilter.
    * :signal:`item_error` is fired when an error happens in a
      pipeline (:issue:`3256`)
    * :signal:`request_reached_downloader` is fired when Downloader
      gets a new Request; this signal can be useful e.g. for custom
      Schedulers (:issue:`3393`).
    * new SitemapSpider :meth:`~.SitemapSpider.sitemap_filter`
      method which allows to select sitemap entries based on their
      attributes in SitemapSpider subclasses (:issue:`3512`).
    * Lazy loading of Downloader Handlers is now optional; this
      enables better initialization error handling in custom
      Downloader Handlers (:issue:`3394`).
  + New FilePipeline and MediaPipeline features
    * Expose more options for S3FilesStore:
      :setting:`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, :setting:`AWS_USE_SSL`,
      :setting:`AWS_VERIFY`, :setting:`AWS_REGION_NAME`. For
      example, this allows to use alternative or self-hosted AWS-
      compatible providers (:issue:`2609`, :issue:`3548`).
    * ACL support for Google Cloud Storage:
      :setting:`FILES_STORE_GCS_ACL` and
      :setting:`IMAGES_STORE_GCS_ACL` (:issue:`3199`).
  + scrapy.contracts improvements
    * Exceptions in contracts code are handled better
      (:issue:`3377`)
    * dont_filter=True is used for contract requests, which allows
      to test different callbacks with the same URL (:issue:`3381`)
    * request_cls attribute in Contract subclasses allow to use
      different Request classes in contracts, for example
      FormRequest (:issue:`3383`).
    * Fixed errback handling in contracts, e.g. for cases where a
      contract is executed for URL which returns non-200 response
      (:issue:`3371`).
  + Usability improvements
    * more stats for RobotsTxtMiddleware (:issue:`3100`)
    * INFO log level is used to show telnet host/port
      (:issue:`3115`)
    * a message is added to IgnoreRequest in RobotsTxtMiddleware
      (:issue:`3113`)
    * better validation of url argument in Response.follow
      (:issue:`3131`)
    * non-zero exit code is returned from Scrapy commands when
      error happens on spider inititalization (:issue:`3226`)
    * Link extraction improvements: "ftp" is added to scheme list
      (:issue:`3152`); "flv" is added to common video extensions
      (:issue:`3165`)
    * better error message when an exporter is disabled

- Update to 1.5.2 (2019-01-22):
  + Security bugfix: Telnet console extension can be easily
    exploited by rogue websites POSTing content to
    http://localhost:6023, we haven't found a way to exploit it
    from Scrapy, but it is very easy to trick a browser to do so
    and elevates the risk for local development environment.
  + The fix is backwards incompatible, it enables telnet user-
    password authentication by default with a random generated
    password. If you can't upgrade right away, please consider
    setting :setting:`TELNET_CONSOLE_PORT` out of its default
    value.
  + See :ref:`telnet console <topics-telnetconsole>` documentation
    for more info
  + Backport CI build failure under GCE environemnt due to boto
    import error.

- Update to 1.5.1 (2018-07-12):
  + This is a maintenance release with important bug fixes, but no
    new features:
    * O(N^2) gzip decompression issue which affected Python 3 and
      PyPy is fixed (:issue:`3281`)
    * skipping of TLS validation errors is improved (:issue:`3166`)
    * Ctrl-C handling is fixed in Python 3.5+ (:issue:`3096`)
    * testing fixes (:issue:`3092`, :issue:`3263`)
    * documentation improvements (:issue:`3058`, :issue:`3059`,
      :issue:`3089`, :issue:`3123`, :issue:`3127`, :issue:`3189`,
      :issue:`3224`, :issue:`3280`, :issue:`3279`, :issue:`3201`,

    + Support kwargs with response.xpath() to use XPath variables and ad-hoc namespaces declarations ; this requires at least Parsel v1.1 (issue 2457).
    + Add support for Python 3.6 (issue 2485).
    + Run tests on PyPy (warning: some tests still fail, so PyPy is not supported yet).

    + MailSender now accepts single strings as values for to and cc arguments (issue 2272)
    + scrapy fetch url, scrapy shell url and fetch(url) inside scrapy shell now follow HTTP redirections by default (issue 2290); See fetch and shell for details.
    + HttpErrorMiddleware now logs errors with INFO level instead of DEBUG; this is technically backwards incompatible so please check your log parsers.
    + By default, logger names now use a long-form path, e.g. [scrapy.extensions.logstats], instead of the shorter “top-level” variant of prior releases (e.g. [scrapy]); this is backwards incompatible if you have log parsers expecting the short logger name part. You can switch back to short logger names using LOG_SHORT_NAMES set to True.
  * Dependencies & Cleanups
    + Scrapy now requires Twisted >= 13.1 which is the case for many Linux distributions already.
    + As a consequence, we got rid of scrapy.xlib.tx.* modules, which copied some of Twisted code for users stuck with an “old” Twisted version

    + startproject command now supports an optional destination directory to override the default one based on the project name (issue 2005).
    + New SCHEDULER_DEBUG setting to log requests serialization failures (issue 1610).
    + JSON encoder now supports serialization of set instances (issue 2058).
    + Interpret application/json-amazonui-streaming as TextResponse (issue 1503).
    + scrapy is imported by default when using shell tools (shell, inspect_response) (issue 2248).
  * Bug fixes
    + DefaultRequestHeaders middleware now runs before UserAgent middleware (issue 2088). Warning: this is technically backwards incompatible, though we consider this a bug fix.
    + HTTP cache extension and plugins that use the .scrapy data directory now work outside projects (issue 1581). Warning: this is technically backwards incompatible, though we consider this a bug fix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  2 19:22:04 UTC 2016 - jacobwinski@gmail.com

- Update to 1.1.0
  * Most important features and bug fixes:
    + Scrapy 1.1 has beta Python 3 support (requires Twisted >= 15.5). See Beta Python 3 Support for more details and some limitations.
    + Hot new features:
      - Item loaders now support nested loaders (issue 1467).
      - FormRequest.from_response improvements (issue 1382, issue 1137).
      - Added setting AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY and improved AutoThrottle docs (issue 1324).
      - Added response.text to get body as unicode (issue 1730).
      - Anonymous S3 connections (issue 1358).
      - Deferreds in downloader middlewares (issue 1473). This enables better robots.txt handling (issue 1471).
      - HTTP caching now follows RFC2616 more closely, added settings HTTPCACHE_ALWAYS_STORE and HTTPCACHE_IGNORE_RESPONSE_CACHE_CONTROLS (issue 1151).
      - Selectors were extracted to the parsel library (issue 1409). This means you can use Scrapy Selectors without Scrapy and also upgrade the selectors engine without needing to upgrade Scrapy.
      - HTTPS downloader now does TLS protocol negotiation by default, instead of forcing TLS 1.0. You can also set the SSL/TLS method using the new DOWNLOADER_CLIENT_TLS_METHOD.
    + These bug fixes may require your attention:
      - Don’t retry bad requests (HTTP 400) by default (issue 1289). If you need the old behavior, add 400 to RETRY_HTTP_CODES.
      - Fix shell files argument handling (issue 1710, issue 1550). If you try scrapy shell index.html it will try to load the URL http://index.html, use scrapy shell ./index.html to load a local file.
      - Robots.txt compliance is now enabled by default for newly-created projects (issue 1724). Scrapy will also wait for robots.txt to be downloaded before proceeding with the crawl (issue 1735). If you want to disable this behavior, update ROBOTSTXT_OBEY in settings.py file after creating a new project.
      - Exporters now work on unicode, instead of bytes by default (issue 1080). If you use PythonItemExporter, you may want to update your code to disable binary mode which is now deprecated.
      - Accept XML node names containing dots as valid (issue 1533).
      - When uploading files or images to S3 (with FilesPipeline or ImagesPipeline), the default ACL policy is now “private” instead of “public” Warning: backwards incompatible!. You can use FILES_STORE_S3_ACL to change it.
      - We’ve reimplemented canonicalize_url() for more correct output, especially for URLs with non-ASCII characters (issue 1947). This could change link extractors output compared to previous scrapy versions. This may also invalidate some cache entries you could still have from pre-1.1 runs. Warning: backwards incompatible!.
  * Beta Python 3 Support with the following limitations:
    + Scrapy has not been tested on Windows with Python 3
    + Sending emails is not supported
    + FTP download handler is not supported
    + Telnet console is not supported
  * Additional New Features and Enhancements:
    + Scrapy now has a Code of Conduct (issue 1681).
    + Command line tool now has completion for zsh (issue 934).
    + Improvements to scrapy shell:
      - Support for bpython and configure preferred Python shell via SCRAPY_PYTHON_SHELL (issue 1100, issue 1444).
      - Support URLs without scheme (issue 1498) Warning: backwards incompatible!
      - Bring back support for relative file path (issue 1710, issue 1550).
    + Added MEMUSAGE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS setting to change default check interval (issue 1282).
    + Download handlers are now lazy-loaded on first request using their scheme (issue 1390, issue 1421).
    + HTTPS download handlers do not force TLS 1.0 anymore; instead, OpenSSL’s SSLv23_method()/TLS_method() is used allowing to try negotiating with the remote hosts the highest TLS protocol version it can (issue 1794, issue 1629).
    + RedirectMiddleware now skips the status codes from handle_httpstatus_list on spider attribute or in Request‘s meta key (issue 1334, issue 1364, issue 1447).
    + Form submission:
      - now works with <button> elements too (issue 1469).
      - an empty string is now used for submit buttons without a value (issue 1472)
    + Dict-like settings now have per-key priorities (issue 1135, issue 1149 and issue 1586).
    + Sending non-ASCII emails (issue 1662)
    + CloseSpider and SpiderState extensions now get disabled if no relevant setting is set (issue 1723, issue 1725).
    + Added method ExecutionEngine.close (issue 1423).
    + Added method CrawlerRunner.create_crawler (issue 1528).
    + Scheduler priority queue can now be customized via SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_QUEUE (issue 1822).
    + .pps links are now ignored by default in link extractors (issue 1835).
    + temporary data folder for FTP and S3 feed storages can be customized using a new FEED_TEMPDIR setting (issue 1847).
    + FilesPipeline and ImagesPipeline settings are now instance attributes instead of class attributes, enabling spider-specific behaviors (issue 1891).
    + JsonItemExporter now formats opening and closing square brackets on their own line (first and last lines of output file) (issue 1950).
    + If available, botocore is used for S3FeedStorage, S3DownloadHandler and S3FilesStore (issue 1761, issue 1883).
    + Tons of documentation updates and related fixes (issue 1291, issue 1302, issue 1335, issue 1683, issue 1660, issue 1642, issue 1721, issue 1727, issue 1879).
    + Other refactoring, optimizations and cleanup (issue 1476, issue 1481, issue 1477, issue 1315, issue 1290, issue 1750, issue 1881).
  * Deprecations and Removals:
    + Added to_bytes and to_unicode, deprecated str_to_unicode and unicode_to_str functions (issue 778).
    + binary_is_text is introduced, to replace use of isbinarytext (but with inverse return value) (issue 1851)
    + The optional_features set has been removed (issue 1359).
    + The --lsprof command line option has been removed (issue 1689). Warning: backward incompatible, but doesn’t break user code.
    + The following datatypes were deprecated (issue 1720):
      - scrapy.utils.datatypes.MultiValueDictKeyError
      - scrapy.utils.datatypes.MultiValueDict
      - scrapy.utils.datatypes.SiteNode
    + The previously bundled scrapy.xlib.pydispatch library was deprecated and replaced by pydispatcher.
  * Relocations:
    + telnetconsole was relocated to extensions/ (issue 1524).
      - Note: telnet is not enabled on Python 3 (https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1524#issuecomment-146985595)
  * Bugfixes:
    + Scrapy does not retry requests that got a HTTP 400 Bad Request response anymore (issue 1289). Warning: backwards incompatible!
    + Support empty password for http_proxy config (issue 1274).
    + Interpret application/x-json as TextResponse (issue 1333).
    + Support link rel attribute with multiple values (issue 1201).
    + Fixed scrapy.http.FormRequest.from_response when there is a <base> tag (issue 1564).
    + Fixed TEMPLATES_DIR handling (issue 1575).
    + Various FormRequest fixes (issue 1595, issue 1596, issue 1597).
    + Makes _monkeypatches more robust (issue 1634).
    + Fixed bug on XMLItemExporter with non-string fields in items (issue 1738).
    + Fixed startproject command in OS X (issue 1635).
    + Fixed PythonItemExporter and CSVExporter for non-string item types (issue 1737).
    + Various logging related fixes (issue 1294, issue 1419, issue 1263, issue 1624, issue 1654, issue 1722, issue 1726 and issue 1303).
    + Fixed bug in utils.template.render_templatefile() (issue 1212).
    + sitemaps extraction from robots.txt is now case-insensitive (issue 1902).
    + HTTPS+CONNECT tunnels could get mixed up when using multiple proxies to same remote host (issue 1912).

- Update to 0.14.0.2841
  - New features and settings
    - Support for AJAX crawleable urls
    - New persistent scheduler that stores requests on disk, allowing to
      suspend and resume crawls (r2737)
    - added -o option to scrapy crawl, a shortcut for dumping scraped items
      into a file (or standard output using -)
    - Added support for passing custom settings to Scrapyd schedule.json api
      (r2779, r2783)
    - New ChunkedTransferMiddleware (enabled by default) to support chunked
      transfer encoding (r2769)
    - Add boto 2.0 support for S3 downloader handler (r2763)
    - Added marshal to formats supported by feed exports (r2744)
    - In request errbacks, offending requests are now received in
      failure.request attribute (r2738)
    - Big downloader refactoring to support per domain/ip concurrency limits
      (r2732)
    - CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_SPIDER setting has been deprecated and replaced
      by:
        CONCURRENT_REQUESTS, CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN,
        CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP
      check the documentation for more details
    - Added builtin caching DNS resolver (r2728)
    - Moved Amazon AWS-related components/extensions (SQS spider queue,
      SimpleDB stats collector) to a separate project: scaws (r2706, r2714)
    - Moved spider queues to scrapyd: scrapy.spiderqueue ->
      scrapyd.spiderqueue (r2708)
    - Moved sqlite utils to scrapyd: scrapy.utils.sqlite -> scrapyd.sqlite
      (r2781)
    - Real support for returning iterators on start_requests() method. The
      iterator is now consumed during the crawl when the spider is getting
      idle (r2704)
    - Added REDIRECT_ENABLED setting to quickly enable/disable the redirect
      middleware (r2697)
    - Added RETRY_ENABLED setting to quickly enable/disable the retry
      middleware (r2694)
    - Added CloseSpider exception to manually close spiders (r2691)
    - Improved encoding detection by adding support for HTML5 meta charset
      declaration (r2690)

      be processed by spiders, before closing the spider (r2688)
    - Added SitemapSpider (see documentation in Spiders page) (r2658)
    - Added LogStats extension for periodically logging basic stats (like
      crawled pages and scraped items) (r2657)
    - Make handling of gzipped responses more robust (#319, r2643). Now Scrapy
      will try and decompress as much as possible from a gzipped response,
      instead of failing with an IOError.
    - Simplified !MemoryDebugger extension to use stats for dumping memory
      debugging info (r2639)
    - Added new command to edit spiders: scrapy edit (r2636) and -e flag to
      genspider command that uses it (r2653)
    - Changed default representation of items to pretty-printed dicts.
      (r2631). This improves default logging by making log more readable in
      the default case, for both Scraped and Dropped lines.
    - Added spider_error signal (r2628)
    - Added COOKIES_ENABLED setting (r2625)
    - Stats are now dumped to Scrapy log (default value of STATS_DUMP setting

    - Added namespace support to xmliter_lxml (r2552)
    - Improved cookies middleware by making COOKIES_DEBUG nicer and
      documenting it (r2579)
    - Several improvements to Scrapyd and Link extractors
  - Code rearranged and removed
    - Merged item passed and item scraped concepts, as they have often proved
      confusing in the past. This means: (r2630)
    - original item_scraped signal was removed
    - original item_passed signal was renamed to item_scraped
    - old log lines Scraped Item... were removed
    - old log lines Passed Item... were renamed to Scraped Item... lines and
      downgraded to DEBUG level
    - Reduced Scrapy codebase by striping part of Scrapy code into two new
      libraries:
      - w3lib (several functions from
        scrapy.utils.{http,markup,multipart,response,url}, done in r2584)
      - scrapely (was scrapy.contrib.ibl, done in r2586)
    - Removed unused function: scrapy.utils.request.request_info() (r2577)
    - Removed googledir project from examples/googledir. There's now a new
      example project called dirbot available on github:
      https://github.com/scrapy/dirbot
    - Removed support for default field values in Scrapy items (r2616)
    - Removed experimental crawlspider v2 (r2632)
    - Removed scheduler middleware to simplify architecture. Duplicates filter
      is now done in the scheduler itself, using the same dupe fltering class
      as before (DUPEFILTER_CLASS setting) (r2640)
    - Removed support for passing urls to scrapy crawl command (use scrapy
      parse instead) (r2704)
    - Removed deprecated Execution Queue (r2704)
    - Removed (undocumented) spider context extension (from
      scrapy.contrib.spidercontext) (r2780)
    - removed CONCURRENT_SPIDERS setting (use scrapyd maxproc instead) (r2789)
    - Renamed attributes of core components: downloader.sites ->
      downloader.slots, scraper.sites -> scraper.slots (r2717, r2718)
    - Renamed setting CLOSESPIDER_ITEMPASSED to CLOSESPIDER_ITEMCOUNT (r2655).
      Backwards compatibility kept.
