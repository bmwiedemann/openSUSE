Thu Nov 21 10:01:31 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 9.4.2:
  * Internal type assertion error messages from qpdf that previously
    triggered a RuntimeError will now raise a PdfError. Generally
    these errors only occur in corrupted files.
  * When we are updating XMP in the processing of saving, errors
    from updating XML are wrapped differently to clarify the
    context in which the error occurs.
  * Fixed a process abort in JBIG2 handling related to cleanup of
    Python objects owned by C++ code.
  * Fixed inconsistent behavior when setting metadata records to an
    empty value.  :issue:`622`
  * Added missing Python 3.13 wheels for a few platforms that were
    missing them, mainly ARM Linux, musllinux/Alpine, and Windows.
  * Since Homebrew has ended support for macOS 12, macOS 13 is now
    the minimum requirement for Intel macOS.
  * Suppressed some spurious warnings during build tests.
  * Integrated OSS Fuzz.
  * Prevented generation of PDF date strings with invalid trailing
    apostrophes, while still accepting them.
  * Improved error message on parsing invalid date strings.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.8 (end of life October 2024).
  * Fixed some inconsistencies with the pikepdf.Rectangle class.
  * Python 3.13 with free-threading added to test matrix.
  * Removed wheel package as build requirement since modern packing
    no longer needs it.
  * Updated C++/Python exception translation to new pybind11
    2.12.0+ protocol, fixing possible undefined behavior in
    multithreaded applications.
  * pybind11 2.12.0 is now required.
  * qpdf 11.9.1 is now used to build wheels.
  * Modernized copyright information to REUSE.toml specification.
  * Added a new test file for a rare case, CCITT with EndOfLine=True.
  * Fixed handling of CalRGB and CalGray images with palettes.
  * Fixed a test suite failure when numpy 2.1 is installed. :issue:`603`
  * Prevented use of setuptools 72+ since it seems to introduce build errors.
  * Added a missing #include header. :issue:`600`
  * Fixed an issue where small floating point values would be recorded in
    scientific notation, contrary to the PDF specification. :issue:`598`
  * Fixed some false positive warnings on Windows C++ compilers.
  * Improved support for Python 3.13 pre-release.
  * Fixed a potential resource leak if we opened a file to read it
    as a PDF but it was not a valid PDF.
  * When overwriting an existing PDF with ``Pdf.save()``, pikepdf
    now attempts to retain the original file permissions and
    ownership.
  * Fixed missing return type for PageList.Extend. :issue:`592`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  2 08:23:18 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 8.15.1:
  * Reformat with ruff.
  * Various updates to build procedures and wheel generation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 15 09:03:05 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 8.15.0:
  * Rebuild wheels with QPDF 11.9.0.
  * Relaxed dependency requirements on lxml, now that that project
    is publishing wheels for less common platforms again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 10:43:33 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 8.14.0:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 22 22:41:11 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 8.11.2:
  * Fixed handling of XMP metadata when metadata contains objects
    in a default namespace.
  * Replaced all relative imports with absolute imports.
  * Rebuilt with QPDF 11.7.0.
  * Added support for setting page boxes to a rectangle directly,
    e.g. ``page.mediabox = rectangle`` - previously rectangle had
    to manually converted to an array.
  * Fixed rendering of PDF and individual pages in Jupyter/IPython.
    Newer versions of these tools are now pickier about what types
    of data they render, and don't render PDFs directly; we now
    provide SVG which works well. Requires installation of MuPDF
    as before.
  * Fixed rendering of inline images in Jupyter/IPython, which was
    not implemented.
  * Fixed build process to use new artifacts v4 actions on GitHub.

    Object.parse(bytes).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 13 14:43:49 UTC 2023 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 8.9.0
  - Overhauled documentation. Previously the documentation could only
    be generated in an environment where pikepdf was compiled and installed,
    since generating the final result depended on executing pikepdf.
    Now, these dynamic features are removed and the documentation is static.
    All documentation that was defined in C++ has been pulled out and defined
    in Python stub files instead, which means compiled binaries are no longer
    needed to access documentation. This change simplifies the generation of
    documentation and makes it easier for IDEs to look up function signatures.
  - Similarly, typing is now defined only in Python stub files.
- Update to 8.8.0
  - Added new pikepdf.canvas module with rudimentary content stream creation functions.
- Update to 8.7.1
  - Fixed pikepdf.Matrix.rotated() so it now rotates in the advertised direction.
- Update to 8.7.0
  - pikepdf.PdfMatrix is now deprecated, in favor of pikepdf.Matrix.
    The former, unfortunately, implemented some operations backwards
    compared to the PDF reference manual. The new class fixes these issues,
    and adds more functionality, promoting transformation matrix to first class objects.
    PdfMatrix is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
  - Improve behavior around truthiness of pikepdf.Name.
- Update to 8.6.0
  - Implemented Page.artbox and Page.bleedbox to access these page dimension boxes.
- Update to 8.5.3
  - Fixed exception on certain PdfImage.__repr__ when the image's mode was invalid.
  - Fixed some minor issues that caused code coverage to miss some covered lines.
  - Removed some unused code.

    to decompress very long
  * Removed uses of deprecated function datetime.utcnow()
  * Adjusted timeline of potentially flaky hypothesis test.
  * PyPy 3.10 is now supported on some platforms.
  * PyPy 3.8 support will be dropped in the next major release

    no longer provide it.
  * Fixed some tests that randomly failed on Windows due to newline
    handling issues.

Sun Mar 27 15:05:43 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.1.0:
  * Rebuild against QPDF 10.6.3.
  * Improvements to Makefile for Apple Silicon wheels.
  * Fix issue where Pdf.check() would report a failure if JBIG2 decoder was not
    installed and the PDF contains JBIG2 content.
  * Some errors and inconsistencies are in the "pdfdoc" encoding provided by pikepdf
    have been corrected, in conjunction with fixes in libqpdf.
  * libqpdf 10.6.2 is required.
  * Previously, looking up the number of a page, given the page, required a linear
    search of all pages. We now use a newer QPDF API that allows quicker lookups.
  * Fixed gcc linker error with linking to a source-compiled version of qpdf. Thanks @jerkenbilt.
  * Fixed dead/obsolete link to old QPDF manual. Thanks @m-holger.
  * Rebuild binary wheels against qpdf 10.5.0. Note 10.6.0 has been released but
    requires further changes so does not work yet.
  * Removed some workarounds to support now-unsupported versions of pybind11.
  * Adjusted hypothesis test settings so it does not randomly fail on PyPy.
  * Mention vector vs raster images in documentation.
  * JBIG2 decoding is now more tightly integrated. In particular, we can now decode
    more types of JBIG2 image and they can be decoded using either the object or
    image interface.
  * Switch to tomli for TOML parsing.
  * Refactor image tests to use hypothesis more effectively and use more random issues,
    fixing many errors along the way.
  * Fixed two instances of a Python object being copied without the GIL held.
    May have caused some instability. Thanks @rwgk.
  * Further improvements to handling of 2- and 4-bit per component images. Major
    refactoring of relevant code and improved testing.
  * Mark pybind11 2.9 as supported. Thanks @QuLogic.
  * Improved support for images with bits per component set to values between 2 and 7
    inclusive.
  * Additional types of runtime errors produced by libqpdf are now resolved to
     ``DataDecodingError`` for improved error message clarity.
  * Improved typing and documentation for several modules.
  * Replaced all internal uses of deprecated standard library module distutils
    with the third party packaging library. This was all for version number checking.
  * Maintainers: python3-packaging is now required for installation.
    Fixed incorrect default rectangle handling in ``Page.add_overlay`` and
     ``Page.add_underlay``. Thanks @sjahu. :issue:`277`.
  * Fixed ``Page.add_overlay`` not scaling to larger target sizes automatically.
  * ``pikepdf._qpdf.ObjectHelper`` is now registered as a base class from which other
     helper classes are derived such as ``pikepdf.Page``.
  * Prevented implicit conversion of ObjectHelper to Object through their inclusion
    as for example, parameters to a ``pikepdf.Array``. This functionality was never
    intended, and was a side effect of certain ObjectHelper subclasses defining an
    iterable interface that made their conversion possible. :issue:`282`
  * Declared support for pybind11 2.8.x.
  * Wheels are now built against libqpdf 10.4.0.
  * Wheels are now built for macOS Apple Silicon and Python 3.10.
  * Fixed equality and copy operators for ``pikepdf.Page``. :issue:`271`
  * Fixed equality test on ``pikepdf.Stream`` objects - objects that are not identical
    but have equal data now compare as equal.
  * Deprecated the use of ``copy_foreign`` for copying ``pikepdf.Page``.
  * Fixed documentation build reproducibility. (Thanks to Chris Lamb and Sean Whitton.)
  * Fixed issue where file attachments not located in the current working directory
  * Removed some references to Python 3.6.
  * Added some fixes to typing hints from @cherryblossom000.
  * Python 3.10 is supported.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6, since it is reaching end of life soon. We will
    backport critical fixes to pikepdf 3.x until Python 3.6 reaches end of life in
    December 2021.
  * We now require C++17 and generate wheels for manylinux2014 Linux targets. We had
    to drop support for manylinux2010, our previous target, since some of our
    dependencies like Pillow are no longer supporting manylinux2010.
  * libqpdf 10.3.1 is now required and other requirements were adjusted.
  * pybind11 2.7.1 is now required.

    reference counting problem.
- Update to version 2.11.3
  * Check for versions of jbig2dec that are too old to be
    supported (lacking the necessary command line arguments to
    extract an image from a PDF).

    occur.
- Update to version 2.9.0
  * We now issue a warning when attempting to use pikepdf.open
    on a bytes object where it could be either a PDF loaded into
    memory or a filename.
  * pikepdf.Page.label will now return the "ordinary" page number
    if no special rules for pages are defined.

    exception, in keeping with Python semantics.
- Update to version 2.7.0
  * Added an option to tell Pdf.save to recompress flate streams,
    and a global option to set the flate compression level. This
    option can be use to force the recompression of flate streams
    if they are not well compressed.
  * Fixed "TypeError: only pages can be inserted" when attempting
    to an insert an unowned page using QPDF 10.2.0 or later.
