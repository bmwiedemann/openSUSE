- Update to version 2.11.0
  * Add new functions: Pdf.generate_appearance_streams and
    Pdf.flatten_annotations, to support common work with PDF forms.
- Update to version 2.10.0
  * Fixed a XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability in
    PDF XMP metadata parsing (CVE-2021-29421)
  * Bind new functions to check, when a PDF is opened, whether
    the password used to open the PDF matched the owner password,
    user password, or both: Pdf.user_password_matched and
    Pdf.owner_password_matched.
- Update to version 2.9.2
  * Further expansion of test coverage of several functions, and
    minor bug fixes along the way.
  * Improve parameter validation for some outline-related functions.
  * Fixed overloaded __repr__ functions in _methods.py not being
    applied.
- Update to version 2.9.1
  * Fixed function signatures for _repr_mimebundle_ functions to
    match IPython's spec.
  * Fixed some error messages regarding attempts to do strange
    things with pikepdf.Name, like pikepdf.Name.Foo = 3.
  * Eliminated code to handle an exception that provably does not
    occur.
- Update to version 2.9.0
  * We now issue a warning when attempting to use pikepdf.open
    on a bytes object where it could be either a PDF loaded into
    memory or a filename.
  * pikepdf.Page.label will now return the "ordinary" page number
    if no special rules for pages are defined.
  * Many improvements to tests and test coverage.
  * An obsolete private function Object._roundtrip was removed.

- Update to version 2.8.0
  * Fixed an issue with extracting data from images that had their
    DecodeParms structured as a list of dictionaries.
  * Fixed an issue where a dangling stream object is created if we
    fail to create the requested stream dictionary.
  * Calling Dictionary() and Array() on objects which are already
    of that type returns a shallow copy rather than throwing an
    exception, in keeping with Python semantics.
- Update to version 2.7.0
  * Added an option to tell Pdf.save to recompress flate streams,
    and a global option to set the flate compression level. This
    option can be use to force the recompression of flate streams
    if they are not well compressed.
  * Fixed "TypeError: only pages can be inserted" when attempting
    to an insert an unowned page using QPDF 10.2.0 or later.
- Update to version 2.6.0
  * Rebuild wheels against QPDF 10.2.0.
