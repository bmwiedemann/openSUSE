- Update to version 2.8.0
  * Fixed an issue with extracting data from images that had their
    DecodeParms structured as a list of dictionaries.
  * Fixed an issue where a dangling stream object is created if we
    fail to create the requested stream dictionary.
  * Calling Dictionary() and Array() on objects which are already
    of that type returns a shallow copy rather than throwing an
    exception, in keeping with Python semantics.
- Update to version 2.7.0
  * Added an option to tell Pdf.save to recompress flate streams,
    and a global option to set the flate compression level. This
    option can be use to force the recompression of flate streams
    if they are not well compressed.
  * Fixed "TypeError: only pages can be inserted" when attempting
    to an insert an unowned page using QPDF 10.2.0 or later.
- Update to version 2.6.0
  * Rebuild wheels against QPDF 10.2.0.
