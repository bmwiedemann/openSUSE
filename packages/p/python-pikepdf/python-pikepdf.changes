Sun Mar 27 15:05:43 UTC 2022 - Dirk M端ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.1.0:
  * Rebuild against QPDF 10.6.3.
  * Improvements to Makefile for Apple Silicon wheels.
  * Fix issue where Pdf.check() would report a failure if JBIG2 decoder was not
    installed and the PDF contains JBIG2 content.
  * Some errors and inconsistencies are in the "pdfdoc" encoding provided by pikepdf
    have been corrected, in conjunction with fixes in libqpdf.
  * libqpdf 10.6.2 is required.
  * Previously, looking up the number of a page, given the page, required a linear
    search of all pages. We now use a newer QPDF API that allows quicker lookups.
  * Fixed gcc linker error with linking to a source-compiled version of qpdf. Thanks @jerkenbilt.
  * Fixed dead/obsolete link to old QPDF manual. Thanks @m-holger.
  * Rebuild binary wheels against qpdf 10.5.0. Note 10.6.0 has been released but
    requires further changes so does not work yet.
  * Removed some workarounds to support now-unsupported versions of pybind11.
  * Adjusted hypothesis test settings so it does not randomly fail on PyPy.
  * Mention vector vs raster images in documentation.
  * JBIG2 decoding is now more tightly integrated. In particular, we can now decode
    more types of JBIG2 image and they can be decoded using either the object or
    image interface.
  * Switch to tomli for TOML parsing.
  * Refactor image tests to use hypothesis more effectively and use more random issues,
    fixing many errors along the way.
  * Fixed two instances of a Python object being copied without the GIL held.
    May have caused some instability. Thanks @rwgk.
  * Further improvements to handling of 2- and 4-bit per component images. Major
    refactoring of relevant code and improved testing.
  * Mark pybind11 2.9 as supported. Thanks @QuLogic.
  * Improved support for images with bits per component set to values between 2 and 7
    inclusive.
  * Additional types of runtime errors produced by libqpdf are now resolved to
     ``DataDecodingError`` for improved error message clarity.
  * Improved typing and documentation for several modules.
  * Replaced all internal uses of deprecated standard library module distutils
    with the third party packaging library. This was all for version number checking.
  * Maintainers: python3-packaging is now required for installation.
    Fixed incorrect default rectangle handling in ``Page.add_overlay`` and
     ``Page.add_underlay``. Thanks @sjahu. :issue:`277`.
  * Fixed ``Page.add_overlay`` not scaling to larger target sizes automatically.
  * ``pikepdf._qpdf.ObjectHelper`` is now registered as a base class from which other
     helper classes are derived such as ``pikepdf.Page``.
  * Prevented implicit conversion of ObjectHelper to Object through their inclusion
    as for example, parameters to a ``pikepdf.Array``. This functionality was never
    intended, and was a side effect of certain ObjectHelper subclasses defining an
    iterable interface that made their conversion possible. :issue:`282`
  * Declared support for pybind11 2.8.x.
  * Wheels are now built against libqpdf 10.4.0.
  * Wheels are now built for macOS Apple Silicon and Python 3.10.
  * Fixed equality and copy operators for ``pikepdf.Page``. :issue:`271`
  * Fixed equality test on ``pikepdf.Stream`` objects - objects that are not identical
    but have equal data now compare as equal.
  * Deprecated the use of ``copy_foreign`` for copying ``pikepdf.Page``.
  * Fixed documentation build reproducibility. (Thanks to Chris Lamb and Sean Whitton.)
  * Fixed issue where file attachments not located in the current working directory
  * Removed some references to Python 3.6.
  * Added some fixes to typing hints from @cherryblossom000.
  * Python 3.10 is supported.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6, since it is reaching end of life soon. We will
    backport critical fixes to pikepdf 3.x until Python 3.6 reaches end of life in
    December 2021.
  * We now require C++17 and generate wheels for manylinux2014 Linux targets. We had
    to drop support for manylinux2010, our previous target, since some of our
    dependencies like Pillow are no longer supporting manylinux2010.
  * libqpdf 10.3.1 is now required and other requirements were adjusted.
  * pybind11 2.7.1 is now required.

    file streams and cases that can lead to poor performance.

    unreachable code removal, more coverage.
- Update to version 2.11.4
  * Fix issue #160, 'Tried to call pure virtual function
    "TokenFilter::handle_token"'; this was a Python/C++
    reference counting problem.
- Update to version 2.11.3
  * Check for versions of jbig2dec that are too old to be
    supported (lacking the necessary command line arguments to
    extract an image from a PDF).
  * Fix setup.py typo: cmd_class changed to cmdclass.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    user password, or both: Pdf.user_password_matched and
    Pdf.owner_password_matched.
- Update to version 2.9.2
  * Further expansion of test coverage of several functions, and
    minor bug fixes along the way.
  * Improve parameter validation for some outline-related functions.
  * Fixed overloaded __repr__ functions in _methods.py not being
    applied.
- Update to version 2.9.1
  * Fixed function signatures for _repr_mimebundle_ functions to
    match IPython's spec.
  * Fixed some error messages regarding attempts to do strange
    things with pikepdf.Name, like pikepdf.Name.Foo = 3.
  * Eliminated code to handle an exception that provably does not
    occur.
- Update to version 2.9.0
  * We now issue a warning when attempting to use pikepdf.open
    on a bytes object where it could be either a PDF loaded into
    memory or a filename.
  * pikepdf.Page.label will now return the "ordinary" page number
    if no special rules for pages are defined.
  * Many improvements to tests and test coverage.
  * An obsolete private function Object._roundtrip was removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    of that type returns a shallow copy rather than throwing an
    exception, in keeping with Python semantics.
- Update to version 2.7.0
  * Added an option to tell Pdf.save to recompress flate streams,
    and a global option to set the flate compression level. This
    option can be use to force the recompression of flate streams
    if they are not well compressed.
  * Fixed "TypeError: only pages can be inserted" when attempting
    to an insert an unowned page using QPDF 10.2.0 or later.
