- Add versions to build requieres so Leap 15.3 can build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 17 09:25:21 UTC 2021 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 2.12.2
  - Rebuild wheels against libqpdf 10.3.2.
  - Enabled building Linux PyPy x86_64 wheels.
  - Fixed a minor issue where the inline images would have their
    abbreviations expanded when unparsed. While unlikely to be
    problematic, inline images usually use abbreviations in their
    metadata and should be kept that way.
  - Added notes to documentation about loading PDFs through Python
    file streams and cases that can lead to poor performance.
- Fix build error for Leap and Tumblweed.

- Update to version 2.12.1
  * Fixed documentation typo and updated precommit settings.
  * Ongoing improvements to code coverage: now related to image
    handling.
- Update to version 2.12.0
  * Complete bindings for ``pikepdf.Annotation`` (useful for
    interpreting PDF form widgets, comments, etc.)
  * Ongoing improvements to code coverage: minor bug fixes,
    unreachable code removal, more coverage.
- Update to version 2.11.4
  * Fix issue #160, 'Tried to call pure virtual function
    "TokenFilter::handle_token"'; this was a Python/C++
    reference counting problem.
- Update to version 2.11.3
  * Check for versions of jbig2dec that are too old to be
    supported (lacking the necessary command line arguments to
    extract an image from a PDF).
  * Fix setup.py typo: cmd_class changed to cmdclass.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 23 06:29:22 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.11.2
  * Added missing documentation for ``Pdf.is_encrypted``.
- Update to version 2.11.1
  * Fixed an issue with ``Object.emplace()`` not retaining the
    original object's /Parent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  7 15:49:49 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.11.0
  * Add new functions: Pdf.generate_appearance_streams and
    Pdf.flatten_annotations, to support common work with PDF forms.
- Update to version 2.10.0
  * Fixed a XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability in
    PDF XMP metadata parsing (CVE-2021-29421)
  * Bind new functions to check, when a PDF is opened, whether
    the password used to open the PDF matched the owner password,
    user password, or both: Pdf.user_password_matched and
    Pdf.owner_password_matched.
- Update to version 2.9.2
  * Further expansion of test coverage of several functions, and
    minor bug fixes along the way.
  * Improve parameter validation for some outline-related functions.
  * Fixed overloaded __repr__ functions in _methods.py not being
    applied.
- Update to version 2.9.1
  * Fixed function signatures for _repr_mimebundle_ functions to
    match IPython's spec.
  * Fixed some error messages regarding attempts to do strange
    things with pikepdf.Name, like pikepdf.Name.Foo = 3.
  * Eliminated code to handle an exception that provably does not
    occur.
- Update to version 2.9.0
  * We now issue a warning when attempting to use pikepdf.open
    on a bytes object where it could be either a PDF loaded into
    memory or a filename.
  * pikepdf.Page.label will now return the "ordinary" page number
    if no special rules for pages are defined.
  * Many improvements to tests and test coverage.
  * An obsolete private function Object._roundtrip was removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  4 19:17:02 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.8.0
  * Fixed an issue with extracting data from images that had their
    DecodeParms structured as a list of dictionaries.
  * Fixed an issue where a dangling stream object is created if we
    fail to create the requested stream dictionary.
  * Calling Dictionary() and Array() on objects which are already
    of that type returns a shallow copy rather than throwing an
    exception, in keeping with Python semantics.
- Update to version 2.7.0
  * Added an option to tell Pdf.save to recompress flate streams,
    and a global option to set the flate compression level. This
    option can be use to force the recompression of flate streams
    if they are not well compressed.
  * Fixed "TypeError: only pages can be inserted" when attempting
    to an insert an unowned page using QPDF 10.2.0 or later.
- Update to version 2.6.0
