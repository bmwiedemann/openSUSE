%description
brewer2mpl is a pure Python package for accessing colorbrewer2.org
color maps from Python. With brewer2mpl, the raw RGB colors of all 165
colorbrewer2.org color maps can be retrieved. The color map data ships with
brewer2mpl, so that no network connection is required.

For more information and to view some of the color maps, see the wiki at
https://github.com/jiffyclub/brewer2mpl/wiki.
