- update to version 0.9.6
  * This release fixes these two recent issues:
    * "Failed to get sync_sequence_id" (#449) Facebook increased the 
      version number requirement for a significant fraction of users 
      (but not everyone, at least not yet)
    * "Failed to read fixed header" (#410 for nss, #444 for gnutls) 
      NSS and GnuTLS, the two TLS/SSL libraries that libpurple supports, 
      enabled TLS 1.3 support in recent versions, and so did facebook. 
      There were some incompatibilities with libpurple 2.12.0 (fixed 
      in 2.13.0) and a subtle race condition on our side.

- Update to version 0.9.3 (changes since 0.9.0):
  * This is now the minimum required version. It fixes connection
    errors after facebook discontinued support for old versions of
    facebook messenger for android. While most of the protocol
    implementation was already above that version, there was a
    subtle change that broke fetching of sync_sequence_id, and the
    previously empty MQTT user agent string is now considered an
    old version too.
  * Set the MQTT user agent to look like Orca-Android 38.0.0.22.155
    Fixes errors when trying to send messages.
  * Use the new ThreadListQuery hash for seq id only, not for
    thread queries.
  * Fixes groupchat join errors.
  * Send orca-formatted user agent for all HTTP requests too. Fixes
    "Failed to parse thread information" errors when joining channels.
