  <title>TUI framework for Python</title>
  <description>Textual is a Python framework for creating interactive applications that run in your terminal.

It adds interactivity to Rich with a Python API inspired by modern web development.

On modern terminal software (installed by default on most systems), Textual apps can use 16.7 million colors with mouse support and smooth flicker-free animation. A layout engine and re-usable components make it possible to build apps that resemble the desktop and web experience.</description>
