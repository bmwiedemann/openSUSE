Wed Aug 20 13:02:53 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 5.3.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v5.3.0

    - Added Content.simplify #6023
    - Added textual.reactive.Initialize #6023
  * Fixed
    - Fixed issue with IDs in markdown #6019 #6023
- update to 5.2.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v5.2.0
  * Added
    - Added a 'stream' layout, which is a lot like vertical but
      with fewer supported rules (which is why it is faster), will
      remain undocumented for now. #6013
- update to 5.1.1:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v5.1.1
  For some reason I still don't understand, poetry included pycache
  files in the last PyPi release. After updating Poetry, the build
  is a more sensible size. There are no code changes in this
  release.
- update to 5.1.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v5.1.0
  This release adds an :empty pseudo-class which matches widgets
  with no children. You could use this to hide a container that
  doesn't have any children, for example:

    .container:empty {
        display: none;
    }

  Also in this release, support for scrolling left and right via
  the trackpad or a mouse that supports it. This was a contribution
  from @fancidev
  * Added
    - Added empty pseudo class, which applies when a widget has no
      displayed children #5999
    - Added Screen.action_focus #5999
    - Added support for left and right mouse scroll for terminals
      and input devices which support it #5995
  * Changed
    - last-child, last-of-type, first-child, and first-of-type
      apply to displayed children only #5999
    - textual.compose is now public #5999
- update to 5.0.1:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v5.0.1
  * Fixed
    - Fixed appending to Markdown widgets that were constructed
      with an existing document #5990
- update to 5.0.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v5.0.0
  This is quite a large release! Fueled in part by my work on Toad.
  Markdown rendering has been improved, with full text selection,
  prettier code blocks and tables. Plus streaming support.Plenty of
  other fixes and additions. Thats to everyone who contributed code
  and issues!
  There are two breaking changes (see below). These are unlikely to
  affect anyone, but Semver requires bumping the major version
  number.
  * Added
    - Added get_minimal_width to Visual protocol #5962
    - Added expand and shrink attributes to GridLayout #5962
    - Added Markdown.get_stream #5966
    - Added textual.highlight module for syntax highlighting #5966
    - Added MessagePump.wait_for_refresh method #5966
    - Added Widget.container_scroll_offset e84600c
    - Added Markdown.source attribute to MarkdownBlocks e84600c
    - Added extension mechanism to Markdown e84600c
    - Added index to ListView.Selected event #5973
    - Added layout switch to Static.update #5973
  * Fixed
    - Fixed TextArea issue with the css theme, where the background
      color was stuck from the previous theme #5964
  * Changed
    - Improved rendering of Markdown tables (replace Rich table
      with grid) which allows text selection #5962
    - Change look of command palette, to drop accented borders
      #5966
    - Some style tweaks to Markdown e84600c
    - Content markup can now accept component classes when preceded
      by a dot, e.g. "Hello [.my_custo_style]World[/]!" #5981
    - Breaking change: Visual.render_strips has a new signature. If
      you aren't explicitly building Visuals then this won't effect
      you. #5981
    - Breaking change: The component classes on Markdown have been
      moved to MarkdownBlock. This won't affect you unless you have
      customize the Markdown CSS #5981
    - The textual-speedups library will now be imported
      automatically if it is installed. Set TEXTUAL_SPEEDUPS=0 to
      disable.
- update to 4.0.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v4.0.0 The
  highlight of this release is the new Markdown.append method which
  can be used to efficiently stream markdown content (like you
  might get from an LLM).
  The Widget.anchor method has changed semantics (and also works
  much better), which is the reason for the major version bump.
  This will only impact you if you are actually using that method.
  And there are a few fixes and additions. Thanks to the community
  for these contributions.
  * Fixed
    - Fixed query_one and query_exactly_one not raising documented
      WrongType exception. #5945
    - Fixed logging to a file on Windows #5941
    - Fixed eight bit colors crashing when applying dim style #5957
  * Changed
    - Breaking change: Widget.anchor now has different semantics.
      It should be applied to a container and anchors to the bottom
      of the scroll position. #5950
  * Added
    - Added Markdown.append #5950
    - Added Widget.release_anchor #5950
    - Added compact parameter to MaskedInput #5952
- update to 3.7.1:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.7.1
  * Fixed
    - Fixed broken text selection with soft_wrap=False #5940
- update to 3.7.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.7.0
  A few enhancements, including a handy getters module for creating
  properties to get widgets.
  Also a potentially breaking change, see below for the details...
  * Added
    - Added textual.getters #5930
    - Added a show_cursor boolean to TextArea #5934
  * Changed
    - Potential breaking change: Changed default query_one and
      query_exactly_one search to breadth first #5930
    - Cursor is now visible by default when in read only mode
      (restoring pre 3.6.0 behavior) #5934
  * Fixed
    - Fixed issue with Keylines not scrolling #5936
- update to 3.6.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.6.0
  * Fixed
    - Fixed issue with the "transparent" CSS value not being
      transparent when set using python #5890
    - Fixed issue with pushing screens when Input has mouse
      captured #5900
    - Implemented workaround for Ghostty bug which produces
      negative mouse coordinates #5926
  * Changed
    - Widget.release_mouse will now only release the mouse, if it
      was captured by self #5900
    - Some optimizations to TextArea, which may be noticeable
      during scrolling (note: may break snapshots with a TextArea)
      #5925
    - Selecting in the TextArea now hides the cursor until you
      release the mouse #5925
    - Read only TextAreas will no longer display a cursor #5925
  * Added
    - Added TextArea.highlight_cursor_line toggle #5924
- update to 3.5.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.5.0
  This release contains some optimizations to startup time, which
  may be significant if you create a lot of widgets. There are also
  some visual updates to Markdown.
  This release will break your snapshots, although I don't expect
  any visual changes. If you are using the snapshot plugin, you
  will need to regenerate those snapshots. Even if you give them a
  quick scan, this should only take a few minutes.
  * Changed
    - Optimized startup #5869
    - New blank visual which makes background faster to render
      (note this will break snapshots tests this version) #5869
    - Exposed code_indent_guides boolean on Markdown widget #5874
    - Changed code fence background to use CSS background rather
      than its code theme #5874
- update to 3.4.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.4.0
  Mostly fixes, although there is a notable change to markup.
  Previously anything in square brackets was considered a tag,
  which resulted in markup errors with Python list literals. i.e.
  [1,2,3] would be interpreted as a tag. The Content markup parser
  has been made more lenient in these cases, and treats them as
  literal text.
  * Fixed
    - Fixed issues with initial flicker in TextArea rendering
      https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/5841vcomm
    - Fixed issue with workers that have large parameter lists
      breaking dev tools #5850
    - Fixed post_message failing on 3.8 #5848
    - Fixed log not working from threads #5863
  * Added
    - Added experimental opt-in support for
      https://github.com/willmcgugan/textual-speedups
  * Changed
    - Content markup is now more lenient; if a 'tag' doesn't
      contain a valid style it will be included verbatim. #5851
- update to 3.3.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.3.0
  The first community supported release.
  Mostly fixes and a few helpful additions. See below for details...
  * Fixed
    - Fixed VERTICAL_BREAKPOINTS doesn't work #5785
    - Fixed Button allowing text selection #5770
    - Fixed running App.run after asyncio.run #5799
    - Fixed triggering a deprecation warning in py >= 3.10 #5799
    - Fixed Input invalid cursor position after updating the value
      #5811
    - Fixed DEFAULT_CLASSES when applied to App #5827
    - Fixed order of implicit content tag closing #5823
  * Added
    - Exposed CollapsibleTitle #5810
    - Added Color.hsv property and Color.from_hsv class method
      #5803
    - Added cursor_at_start and cursor_at_end properties to the
      Input widget #5830
  * Changed
    - Added a few features to python -m textual.markup playground
      #5823
- update to 3.2.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.2.0
  There are a few interesting features in this release.
  Many widgets have grown a compact reactive. If you set this to
  True then the widget will have a compact (borderless) style.
  Reactives have a new toggle_class attribute, that toggles a TCSS
  classname according to the truthyness of its value. If that
  sounds complicated, it really isn't in practice. Let's see it in
  action:
    class MyWidget(Widget):
        compact = reactive(False, toggle_class="-textual-compact")

  This adds a boolean attribute to the widget. If you set
  compact=True then it will add the class "-textual-compact". If
  you set compact=False it will remove the class. Simples.
  We also have breakpoint support, so you can build UIs that adjust
  to the dimensions of the screen. This was always possible, but it
  was a pattern before. Now it is a first class feature. See the
  breakpoints.py example.
  We also have two new pseudo classes: :first-child and
  :last-child, which have the same meaning as browser CSS.
  Contributed by @sponsfreixes
  There is one potential breaking change. RadioSet now has a
  default width of 1fr, meaning they will take up the full
  available space. This makes RadioSet size like other widgets. If
  you want the original behavior, then set the width to "auto"
  * Fixed
    - Fixed OptionList causing excessive redrawing #5766
    - Log messages could be written to stdout when there was no
      app, which could happen when using run_async or threads. Now
      they will be suppressed, unless the env var TEXTUAL_DEBUG is
      set #5782
  * Added
    - Added :first-child and :last-child pseudo classes #5776
    - Added toggle_class parameter to reactives #5778
    - Added compact parameter and reactive to Button, Input,
      ToggleButton, RadioSet, OptionList, TextArea #5778
    - Added HORIZONTAL_BREAKPOINTS and VERTICAL_BREAKPOINTS to App
      and Screen #5779
  * Changed
    - RadioSet now has a default width of 1fr #5778
- update to 3.1.1:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.1.1
  * Fixed

    - Fixed a crash when setting keymap before app mount #5742
- update to 3.1.0:

    - Fixed allow_focus method not overriding can_focus() #5737
    - Fixed overlap of Input / TextArea selection with arbitrary
      text selection #5739
  * Changed
    - Collapsible title now accepts str, Text, or Content #5697
    - Rich Text objects will be converted to Content in OptionList
      and other widgets #5712
    - Textual will always convert dim attributes to RGB by default
      #5715
    - Notifications will now use content markup (previously they
      used Console markup) #5719
  * Added
    - Added TEXTUAL_DIM_FACTOR env var to set the opacity of the
      'dim' ANSI attribute #5715
    - notify() now accepts a markup parameter to disable rendering
      the message as markup #5719
    - Added Screen.text_selection_started_signal #5739
    - Added App.clear_selection() helper method to clear arbitrary
      text selection of active screen #5739
- update to 3.0.1:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.0.1
  Fixes an issue with modal dialogs not refreshing.
  * Fixed
    - Fixed issue with modal dialog not refreshing #5696
- update to 3.0.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v3.0.0
  Mostly small enhancements, and fixes. This is a major version
  bump, due to a change in how app.query works. Previously this
  would query the active screen, but this would yield surprising
  results if you push a screen. Now app.query, gets results from
  the default screen.
  This is unlikely to impact many apps. If it does, use
  app.screen.query where you previously used app.query.
  * Changed
    - Breaking change: App.query and friends will now always query
      the default (first) screen, not necessarily the active
      screen.
    - Content now has a default argument of an empty string, so
      Content() is equivalent to Content("")
    - Assigned names to Textual-specific threads: textual-input,
      textual-output. These should become visible in monitoring
      tools (ps, top, htop) as of Python 3.14. #5654
    - Tabs now accept Content or content markup #5657
    - Breaking change: Buttons will now use Textual markup rather
      than console markup
    - tree-sitter languages are now loaded lazily, improving
      cold-start time #563
  * Fixed
    - Static and Label now accept Content objects, satisfying type
      checkers #5618
    - Fixed click selection not being disabled when allow_select
      was set to false #5627
    - Fixed crash on clicking line API border #5641
    - Fixed Select.selection now correctly returns None if
      Select.BLANK is selected instead of an AssertionError
    - Fixed additional spaces after text-wrapping #5657
    - Added missing scroll_end parameter to the Log.write_line
      method #5672
    - Restored support for blink #5675
    - Fixed scrolling breaking on DataTable with overflow: hidden
      #5681
  * Added
    - Added Widget.preflight_checks to perform some debug checks
      after a widget is instantiated, to catch common errors. #5588
    - Added text-padding style #5657
    - Added Content.first_line property #5657
    - Added Content.from_text constructor #5657
    - Added Content.empty constructor #5657
    - Added Content.pad method #5657
    - Added Style.has_transparent_foreground property #5657
- update to 2.1.2:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v2.1.2
  A fix for the command palette's fuzzy search. Will not affect
  most people.
  * Fixed
    - Fixed command palette fuzzy search bailing too early #5579
- update to 2.1.1:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v2.1.1
  Mostly fixes here. There is a small change to behavior around
  scroll_end. Changes below...
  * Fixed
    - Fixed Link binding to open the link #5564
    - Fixed IndexError in OptionList #5574
    - Fixed issue with clear_panes breaking tabbed content #5573
  * Changed
    - The user can now interrupt a scroll to end by grabbing the
      scrollbar or scrolling in any other way. Press ++end++ or
      scroll to the end to restore default behavior. This is more
      intuitive that it may sound.
- update to 2.1.0:
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v2.1.0
  Mostly fixes in this release, and a small feature.
  The mouse event adds pointer_* attributes which contain the
  pointer coordinates in pixel resolution (if supported by your
  terminal).
  * Fixed
    - Fixed smooth scrolling broken on iTerm over SSH #5551
    - Fixed height of auto container which contains auto height
      children #5552
    - Fixed Content.from_markup not stripping control codes #5557

  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v2.0.0
  * This is a big release!
    Arbitrary text selection. You can now select text, and hit
    ctrl+c to copy it to the clipboard. This works just about
    everywhere, although there a re a few widgets were it isn't yet
    implemented.
  * Breaking change: Strings returned from render() and other
    places will now be interpreted with Content.from_markup, rather
    than Rich.from_markup. This may result in slightly different
    colors, and emoji codes (like ":smiley:") will no longer be
    processed automatically. If you want to restore the old
    behavior you can return Rich.from_markup("Your output here")
    rather than string literal.
  * Why 2.0.0 ?
    It took us more than 3 years to get to 1.0. But a couple of
    months to get to 2.0? Why?
    We follow Semver which says that after 1.0, all breaking
    changes bump the major version number. We have some breaking
    changes here, which will be trivial to fix -- if they effect
    you at all. But a breaking change is a breaking change!
