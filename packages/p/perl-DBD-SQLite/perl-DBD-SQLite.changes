      - Updated to SQLite 3.10.1, which fixed an old bug that could

        to use the block sorting optimization.
  
  1.49_05 2016-01-11
      *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
      - Updated to SQLite 3.10.0.
        Because of the addition of LIKE/GLOB/REGEXP support on
        virtual tables, previous ::PerlData virtual table got broken.
        This is hopefully fixed by adding strlike/strglob functions
        to DBD::SQLite but if you use this virtual table, please
        test it carefully.
      - Now you can make a database connection read-only if you
        turn on the ReadOnly attribute when you connect. (RT #110439)
        If you set it after you connect to a database, DBD::SQLite
        warns because the database doesn't actually become read-only.
  
      - Improved ::Constants
        - to load DBD::SQLite by itself
        - to expose SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER
        - introduced a few new (shorter) tags
  
  1.49_04 2015-11-24
      - Updated ::Constants
      - Fixed a sqlite version number in a test (GH-14; NANIS++)

  1.49_02 2015-10-10
      - Added a workaround to resolve #106950 Extra warnings
        with savepoints (hopefully)
      - Not to run tests for table_column_metadata unless
        ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA is set
  
  1.49_01 2015-08-04
      - Updated to SQLite 3.8.11.1
      - Resolved #106151 SAVEPOINT bug
      - Made sure to keep what's left in unprepared_statements when
        allow_multiple_statements is set. (GH #11)

    - Removed previous Cygwin hack as SQLite 3.8.9 compiles well again
    - Now create_function/aggregate accepts an extra bit
      (SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC) for better performance.
  
  1.47_01 2015-02-17
      *** (EXPERIMENTAL) CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
      - Commented OPTIMIZE out of WriteMakefile (RT #94207).
        If your perl is not compiled with -O2, your DBD::SQLite may
        possibly behave differently under some circumstances.
        (This release is to find notable examples from CPAN Testers).
      - Set THREADSAFE to 0 under Cygwin to cope with an upstream
        regression since 3.8.7 (GH #7).

     *** NOTICE ON NEXT GENERATION QUERY PLANNER ***
     - As of SQLite 3.8.0, SQLite's query planner has been rewritten.
       According to the author, the new query planner should give
       exactly the same result (though perhaps with a little less CPU
       time spent planning) for simple queries, and for complex
       queries, it can in many cases provide a much faster answer.
       See http://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner-ng.html for details.
 
     *** NOTICE ON PARTIAL INDICES ***
     - Database files created by SQLite 3.8.0 are still readable and
       writable by prior versions, but if you use partial indices
       introduced in SQLite 3.8.0, those files become unreadable and
       unwritable by older versions of (DBD::)SQLite. They'll be
       readable/writable again by dropping partial indices.

    - Tweaked Makefile.PL to behave better during the Bsymbolic
      check (HMBRAND)
    - Added SQLITE_WITHOUT_ZONEMALLOC for older MacOS X (ISHIGAKI)

      condition issue (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Fix integer overflow in passing argument to perl function
    - Convert unsigned -> int64 when possible (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Turned datatype mismatch error (introduced in 1.34_02) into
      a warning (you can disable this warning by setting PrintWarn
      attribute to false). (ISHIGAKI)
    - Refactored sqlite_is_number to fix various corner cases
    - Downgraded SQLite to 3.7.9, as 3.7.10 turned out to be
      broken on the latest MacOS X (due to a missing symbol),
      and broke other modules that typically use temporary tables
      under a few environments too. As of this writing, would-be
      3.7.11 seems fine, but it would take another month to be
      released. (ISHIGAKI)

      number, that means newly created database files will be
      unreadable by SQLite version prior to 3.3.0 (2006-01-10)
      (or DBD::SQLite prior to 1.12) unless you explicitly issue
      "PRAGMA legacy_file_format=ON".
    - Enabled SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4

      on 1.34_02 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Implemented sqlite_trace and sqlite_profile methods for simpler
      tracing/profiling; use DBI_TRACE/DBI_PROFILE for more
      complicated cases (ISHIGAKI)

    - resolved RT#67581: bind_param SQL_INTEGER numifies value;
      now DBD::SQLite croaks if you explicitly specify datatype
      (with bind_param) and datatype mismatch happens
    - datatype set in the bind_param(_array) becomes sticky now
      (as per DBI spec); this potentially affects code depending on
      current undocumented and broken behavior
  * resolved RT#71311: binding output columns as SQL_BLOB returns nothing
  * fixed binding named parameters
  * moved check for bind_ph/is_inout so it always error-out
  * don't set imp_sth->stmt to NULL on error path
  * explained an issue of rollback with unfinished statements
  * made util/getsqlite.pl work properly for SQLite 3.7.5+
  * Cookbook: don't use globals
  * resolved RT#70135 and hopefully other mod_perl/CentOS issues like RT#63873
    and RT#47983
