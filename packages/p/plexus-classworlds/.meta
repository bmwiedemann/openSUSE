  <title>Plexus Classworlds Classloader Framework</title>
  <description>Classworlds is a framework for container developers
who require complex manipulation of Java's ClassLoaders.
Java's native ClassLoader mechanisms and classes can cause
much headache and confusion for certain types of
application developers. Projects which involve dynamic
loading of components or otherwise represent a 'container'
can benefit from the classloading control provided by
classworlds.
