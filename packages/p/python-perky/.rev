    <comment>- update to 0.9.2:
  * Added GitHub Actions integration.  Tests and
    coverage are run in the cloud after every checkin.
    Thanks to [Dan Pope](https://github.com/lordmauve)
    for gently walking me through this!
  * Fixed metadata in the `pyproject.toml` file.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.5.  (I assumed I already
    had, but it was still listed as being supported
    in the project metadata.)
  * Added badges for testing, coverage,
    and supported Python versions.
  * API change: the `Parser` attribute `breadcrumbs` has been
    renamed to `stack`.  It was previously undocumented anyway,
    though as of 0.9.1 it's now documented.  The previous name
    `breadcrumbs` has been kept as an alias for now, but will
    be removed before 1.0.
  * Added the `line_number` and `source` attributes to the
    `Parser` object, for the convenience of pragma handlers.
  * Refactored `parser_include` slightly.  No change to
    functionality or behavior, just a small code cleanup pass.
  * Added a &quot;lines per second&quot; output metric to the
    benchmark program.
  * From this point forward, Perky only supports reading and
    writing files in
    [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).
    If you need to work with a different encoding, you'll have
    to handle loading it form and saving it to disk yourself.
    You'll have to use `loads` and `dumps` to handle converting
    between Perky string format and native Python objects.
  * Optimized Perky some more.  It's roughly 11% faster than 0.8.1.</comment>
