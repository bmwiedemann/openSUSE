  <title>Implementation of a &quot;Singleton&quot; class</title>
  <description>This is the &quot;Class::Singleton&quot; module. A Singleton describes an object
class that can have only one instance in any system. An example of a
Singleton might be a print spooler or system registry. This module
implements a Singleton class from which other classes can be derived. By
itself, the &quot;Class::Singleton&quot; module does very little other than manage
the instantiation of a single object. In deriving a class from
&quot;Class::Singleton&quot;, your module will inherit the Singleton instantiation
method and can implement whatever specific functionality is required.

For a description and discussion of the Singleton class, see &quot;Design
Patterns&quot;, Gamma et al, Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-201-63361-2.
