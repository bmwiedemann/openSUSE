- Minimize Recommends and Suggests, dep chain is too big
  (WebEngine, Qt3D) for the TW DVD

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 09:30:26 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch so the renaming of QtDataVisualization doesn't cause
  a problem on applications using the old name
  (gh#spyder-ide/qtpy#228):
  * 0001-Add-QtDatavisualization-alias-to-QtDataVisualization.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 14 09:12:53 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add also BuildRequires for qt3d-qt5 and qtdatavis3d-qt5 so
  those tests are not skipped.
- qtcharts-qt5 is not added because the python-qt5 package is
  always pulled in automatically and QtPy uses it by default
  while QtCharts is only available with PySide2.
- Replace the Requires with Recommends since not even PyQt is
  really required (PySide2 can also be used with QtPy, and is now
  added as a Suggested package).
- Rename QtDatavisualization.py to QtDataVisualization.py
  (uppercase v) to fix the test which was skipped because the
  imported module didn't exist and to keep the name consistent
  with both PyQt and PySide2 (gh#spyder-ide/qtpy#228)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 13 15:55:35 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- BuildRequires (and Require) the webengine bindings so it uses
  them (which is the default) instead of using qtwebkit (which
  was used only as a fallback).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Jul 29 07:57:44 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.9.0
  * Add the FORCE_QT_API environment variable to keep using the Qt
    bindings selected with the QT_API variable and avoid switching
    to the currently imported bindings. This allows to have
    applications that import PySide and PyQt bindings at the same
    time (which is possible if both bindings are compiled for the
    same Qt version).
  * Errors in the Qt3D modules with PySide2 5.12.4+ and Python 2
  * Binding Selection Logic
