  <title>PDF parser and analyzer</title>
  <description>Fork of PDFMiner using six for Python3 compatibility.

PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting
and analyzing text data. PDFMiner allows to obtain the exact
location of texts in a page, as well as other information such
as fonts or lines. It includes a PDF converter that can transform
PDF files into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an
extensible PDF parser that can be used for other purposes instead
of text analysis.
