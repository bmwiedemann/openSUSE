- Update to version 0.35.0:
  * Added nullString(), nullInt(), nullFloat(), nullBool,
    nullArray(), nullObject() JSVM helpers for scanning nullable
    columns.
  * Store the correct image/png as attrs content type when
    generating a thumb fallback (e.g. for webp).
  * Trimmed custom uploaded file name and extension from leftover
    . characters after filesystem.File normalization.

- Update to version 0.34.0:
  * Added @request.body.someField:changed modifier.
  * Updated the backup restore popup with a short info about the
    performed restore steps.

- Update to version 0.33.0:
  * Added extra id characters validation in addition to the user
    specified regex pattern.
  * Added {ALERT_INFO} placeholder to the auth alert mail template.

- Update to version 0.32.0:
  * Added extra List/Search API rules checks for the client-side
    filter/sort relations. This is continuation of the effort to
    eliminate the risk of information disclosure (and eventually
    the side-channel attacks that may originate from that).
  * Increased the default SQLite PRAGMA cache_size to ~32MB.
  * Fixed deadlock when manually triggering the OnTerminate hook.

- Update to version 0.31.0:
  * Display presentable multiple relation fields.
  * Support Ed25519 in the optional OIDC id_token signature
    validation.
  * Disallow client-side filtering and sorting of relations where
    the collection of the last targeted relation field has
    superusers-only List/Search API rule to further minimize the
    risk of eventual side-channel attack.
