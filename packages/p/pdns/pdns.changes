  the huge performance improvement of the internal caches."

Sat Apr 21 18:44:53 CEST 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.9.21:
  - Bugs:
    - Multi-part TXT records weren't supported. This has been
      fixed, and regression tests have been added. Code in commits
      1016, 996, 994.
    - Email addresses with embedded dots in SOA records were not
      parsed correctly, nor were other embedded dots. Noted by
      'Bastiaan', fixed in commit 1026.
    - BIND backend treated the 'm' TTL modifier as 'months' and not
      'minutes'. Closes Debian bug 406462. Addressed in commit
      1026.
    - Our snapshots were built against a static version of
      PosgreSQL that was incompatible with many Linux
      distributions, leading to instant crashes on startup. Fixed
      in 1022 and 1023.
    - CNAME referrals to child zones gave improper responses. Noted
      by Augie Schwer in ticket 123, fixed in commit 992.
    - When passing a port number with the recursor setting, this
      would sometimes generate errors during additional processing.
      Switched off overly helpful additional processing for
      recursive queries to remove this problem. Implemented in
      commit 1031, spotted by Ralf van der Enden.
    - NS to a nameserver with the name of the zone itself generated
      problems. Spotted by Augie Schwer, fixed in commit 947.
    - Multi-line records in the BIND backend were not always parsed
      correctly. Fixed in commit 1014.
    - The LOC-record had problems operating outside of the eastern
      hemisphere of the northern part of the world! Fixed in commit
      1011.
    - Backends were compiled without multithreading preprocessor
      flags. As far as we can determine, this would only cause
      problems for the BIND backend, but we cannot rule out this
      caused instability in other backends. Fixed in commit 1001.
    - The BIND backend was highly unstable under reloads, and
      leaked memory and file descriptors. Thanks to Mark Bergsma
      and Massimo Bandinelli for respectively pointing this out to
      us and testing large amounts of patches to fix the problem.
      The fixes have resulted in better performance, less code, and
      a remarkable simplification of this backend. Commits 1039,
      1034, 1035, 1006, 999, 905 and previous.
    - BIND backend gave convincing NXDOMAINS on unloaded zones in
      some cases. Spotted and fixed by Daniel Bilik in commit 984.
    - SOA records in zone transfers sometimes contained the wrong
      SOA TTL. Spotted by Christian Kuehn, fixed in commit 902.
    - PowerDNS could get confused by very high SOA serial numbers.
      Spotted and fixed by Dan Billik, fixed in commit 626.
    - Some versions of FreeBSD perform very strict checks on socket
      address sizes passed to 'connect', which could lead to
      problems retrieving zones over AXFR. Fixed in commit 891.
    - Some versions of FreeBSD perform very strict checks on IPv6
      socket addresses, leading to problems. Discovered by Sten
      Spans, fixed in commit 885 and commit 886.
    - IXFR requests were not logged properly. Noted by Ralf van der
      Enden, fixed in commit 990.
    - Some NAPTR records needed an additional space character to
      encode correctly. Spotted by Heinrich Ruthensteiner, fixed in
      commit 1029.
    - Many bugs in the TCP nameserver, leading to a PowerDNS
      process that did not respond to TCP queries over time. Many
      fixes provided by Dan Bilik, other problems were fixed by
      rewriting our TCP handling code. Commits 982 and 980, 950,
      924, 889, 874, 869, 685, 684.
    - Fix crashes on the ARM processor due to alignment errors.
      Thanks to Sjoerd Simons. Closes Debian bug 397031.
    - Missing data in generic SQL backends would sometimes lead to
      faked SOA serial data. Spotted by Leander Lakkas from True.
      Fix in commit 866.
    - When receiving two quick notifications in succession, the
      packet cache would sometimes "process" the second one,
      leading PowerDNS to ignore it. Spotted by Dan Bilik, fixed in
      commit 686.
    - Geobackend (by Mark Bergsma) did not properly override the
      getSOA method, breaking non-overlay operation of this fine
      backend. The geobackend now also skips '.hidden'
      configuration files, and now properly disregards empty
      configuration files. Additionally, the overlapping abilities
      were improved. Details available in commit 876, by Mark.
  - Features:
    - Thanks to EasyDNS, PowerDNS now supports multiple masters per
      domain. For configuration details, see Section 13.2.
      Implemented in commit 1018, commit 1017.
    - Thanks to EasyDNS, PowerDNS now supports the KEY record type,
      as well the SPF record. In commit 976.
    - Added support for CERT, SSHFP, DNSKEY, DS, NSEC, RRSIG record
      types, as part of the move to the new DNS parsing/generating
      code.
    - Support for the AFSDB record type, as requested by 'Bastian'.
      Implemented in commit 978, closing ticket 129.
    - Support for the MR record type. Implemented in commit 941 and
      commit 1019.
    - Gsqlite3 backend was added by Antony Lesuisse in commit 942;
    - Added the ability to send out light-weight root-referrals
      that save bandwidth yet still placate mediocre resolver
      implementations. Implemented in commit 912, enable with
      'root-referral=lean'.
  - Improvements:
    - Miscellaneous OpenDBX and LDAP backend improvements by
      Norbert Sendetzky. Applied in commit 977 and commit 1040.
    - SGML source of the documentation was cleaned up by Ruben
      Kerkhof in commit 936.
    - Speedups in core DNS label processing code. Implemented in
      commit 928, commit 654, commit 1020.
    - When communicating with master servers and encountering
      errors, more useful details are logged. Reported by Stefan
      Arentz in ticket 137, closed by commit 1015.
    - Database errors are now logged with more details. Addressed
      in commit 1004.
    - pdns_control problems are now logged more verbosely. Change
      in commit 910.
    - Erroneous address configuration was logged unclearly. Spotted
      by River Tarnell, fixed in commit 888.
    - Example configuration shipped with PowerDNS was very old.
      Noted by Leen Besselink, fixed in commit 946.
    - PowerDNS neglected to chdir to the root when chrooted. This
      closes ticket 110, fixed in commit 944.
    - Microsoft resolver had problems with responses we generated
      for CNAMEs pointing out of our bailiwick. Fixed in commit 983
          and expedited by Locaweb.com.br.
    - Built-in webserver logs errors more verbosely. Closes ticket
      82, gixed in commit 991.
    - Queries containing '@' no longer flood the logs. Addressed in
      commit 1014.
    - The build process now looks for PostgreSQL in more places.
      Implemented in commit 998, closes ticket 90.
    - Speedups in the BIND backend now mean large installations
      enjoy startup times up to 30 times faster than with the
      original BIND nameserver. Many thanks to Massimo Bandinelli.
    - BIND backend now offers full support for query logging,
      implemented in commit 1026, commit 1029.
    - BIND backend named.conf parsing is now fully case-insensitive
      for domain names. This closes Debian bug 406461, fixed in
          commit 1027.
    - IPv6 and IPv4 address parsing routines have been replaced,
      which should result in prettier output in some cases. commit
      962, commit 1012 and others.
    - 5 new regression tests have been added to insure old bugs do
      not return.
    - Fix small issues with very modern compilers and BOOST
      snapshots. Noted by Marcus Rueckert, addressed in commit 954,
      commit 964 commit 965, commit 1003.
