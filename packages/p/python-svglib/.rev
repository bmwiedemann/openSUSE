  * Final fix to conversion from shorthand quadratic to cubic bézier.

  * Fix conversion from shorthand quadratic to cubic bézier.
  * Include tests/samples/others/*.svg in source distribution.
  * Render leading and trailing text content in text nodes.
  * Better integration with cssselect2 to support a wider range of CSS
    selectors.
  * Support mmult import from reportlab &lt; 3.5.61.
  * Make zero-length Line, PolyLine and Polygon appear in PDFs when their
    stroke value is non-zero.
  * &lt;symbol&gt; nodes now only appears in documents when they are referenced,
    not on their initial appearance.
  * If only rx or ry is defined on a &lt;rect&gt;, the value is used for both.
  * Support non-prefixed href attribute added in SVG 2.
  * Fixed parsing of empty SVG style nodes.
  * Handle content of multiple SVG style nodes.
  * Better font caching for some font names.
  * Revert to scripts usage instead of console_scripts during setup.
  * dropped support for Python 3.6 and added official support for Python
    3.10.
  * improved support for scientific notation in paths
  * if some path has a color with alpha value, it also sets the default fill
    or stroke opacity of the resulting object.
  * matrix transforms on groups are combined with other transforms instead
    of replacing them.
