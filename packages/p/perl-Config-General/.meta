  <title>Generic Config Module</title>
  <description>This module opens a config file and parses its contents for you. The *new*
method requires one parameter which needs to be a filename. The method
*getall* returns a hash which contains all options and its associated
values of your config file.

The format of config files supported by *Config::General* is inspired by
the well known Apache config format, in fact, this module is 100%
compatible to Apache configs, but you can also just use simple name/value
pairs in your config files.

In addition to the capabilities of an Apache config file it supports some
enhancements such as here-documents, C-style comments or multiline options.</description>
