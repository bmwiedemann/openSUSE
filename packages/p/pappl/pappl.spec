%description
PAPPL is a C-based framework/library for developing CUPS Printer
Applications, which are the recommended replacement for printer
drivers. PAPPL supports LPrint and a Gutenprint Printer Application,
but it is sufficiently general purpose to support any kind of printer
or driver that can be used on desktops, servers and in embedded
environments.

PAPPL supports JPEG, PNG, PWG Raster, Apple Raster, and "raw"
printing to printers connected via USB and network
(AppSocket/JetDirect) connections. PAPPL provides access to the
printer via its embedded IPP Everywhere service, either local to the
computer or on your whole network, which can then be discovered and
used by any application.
