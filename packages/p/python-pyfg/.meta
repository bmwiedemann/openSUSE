  <title>Python API for fortigate</title>
  <description>This API allows you to interact with a device runnine FortiOS in a sane way.
With this API you can:

 * Connect to the device, retrieve the running config (the entire config or
   some blocks, whatever you want) and build a model
 * Build the same model from a file
 * Do changes in the candidate configuration locally
 * Create a candidate configuration from a file
 * Do a diff between the running config and the local candidate config
 * Generate the necessary commands to go from the running configuration to
   the candidate configuration
