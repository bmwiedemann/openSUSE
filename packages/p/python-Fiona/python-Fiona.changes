- Skip two failing tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 06:33:43 UTC 2022 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Update to v1.8.21
  * Driver mode support tests have been made more general and less
     susceptible to driver quirks involving feature fields and
     coordinate values.
  * OSError is raised on attempts to open a dataset in a Python
    file object in "a" mode.
  * Upgrade attrs, cython, etc to open up Python 3.10 support
  * Allow FieldSkipLogFilter to handle exception messages as well as strings
  * Clean up VSI files left by MemoryFileBase
  * Hard-coded "utf-8" collection encoding has been removed
- from v1.8.20
  * Allow use with click 8 and higher
- from v1.8.19
  * In fiona/env.py the GDAL data path is now configured using
    set_gdal_config instead by setting the GDAL_DATA environment variable
  * Spurious iterator reset warnings have been eliminated.
- from v1.8.18
  * The precision option of transform has been fixed for the case of
    GeometryCollections
  * Added missing --co (creation) option to fio-load
  * If the certifi package can be imported, its certificate store
    location will be passed to GDAL during import of fiona._env unless
    CURL_CA_BUNDLE is already set.
  * Warn when feature fields named "" are found
- from v1.8.17
  * To fix issue #952 the fio-cat command no longer cuts feature
    geometries at the anti-meridian by default. A --cut-at-antimeridian
    option has been added to allow cutting of geometries in a geographic
    destination coordinate reference system.
- from v1.8.16
  * More OGR errors and warnings arising in calls to GDAL C API functions
    are surfaced.
  * A circular import introduced in some cases in 1.8.15 has been fixed
- from v1.8.15
  * Change shim functions to not return tuples
  * Raise a Python exception when VSIFOpenL fails.
- from v1.8.14
  * When creating a new Collection in a MemoryFile with a default (random) name
    Fiona will attempt to use a format driver-supported file extension.
    When initializing a MemoryFile with bytes of data formatted for a vector
    driver that requires a certain file name or extension, the user should
    continue to pass an appropriate filename and/or extension.
  * Read support for FlatGeobuf has been enabled in the drvsupport module.
  * The MemoryFile implementation has been improved so that it can support multi-part
    S3 downloads (#906). This is largely a port of code from rasterio.
  * Axis ordering for results of fiona.transform was wrong when CRS were
    passed in the "EPSG:dddd" form.
  * Allow implicit access to the only dataset in a ZipMemoryFile.
    The path argument of ZipMemoryFile.open() is now optional
  * Improve support for datetime types: support milliseconds, timezones
    and improve warnings if type is not supported by driver
  * Fix "Failed to commit transaction" TransactionError for FileGDB driver.
  * Load GDAL DLL dependencies on Python 3.8+ / Windows with add_dll_directory()
  * Do not require optional properties
  * Ensure that slice does not overflow available data
  * Resolve issue when "ERROR 4: Unable to open EPSG support file gcs.csv."
    is raised on importing fiona.
  * Resolve issue resulting in possible mixed up fields names (affecting
    only DXF, GPX, GPSTrackMacker and DGN driver)
  * Ensure crs_wkt is passed when writing to MemoryFile

Sat Mar 14 17:15:49 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- update to version 1.18.13.post1
  + improve binary wheel compatibility with shapely 1.7.0
  + All update are referenced online or in the package
    https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/blob/master/CHANGES.txt
- Fix tests error with proj.db (datadir instead libdir)
- Make only python3 as we don't have anymore python2-pyproj
- spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 12 20:55:22 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Fix dependencies.
- Enable unit tests
- Ran spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  1 15:30:57 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Split executable into own module to avoid conflicts with fio.
  fio is a Linux Kernel project so we probably don't want to make
  fiona conflict with it completely.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Trim bias from description. Use noun phrase in summary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 18:34:55 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to last version 1.8.6
  * The advertisement for JSON driver enablement in 1.8.5 was false (#176), but
    in this release they are ready for use.
- Update to last version 1.8.5
  * GDAL seems to work best if GDAL_DATA is set as early as possible. Ideally it
    is set when building the library or in the environment before importing
    Fiona, but for wheels we patch GDAL_DATA into os.environ when fiona.env
    is imported. This resolves #731.
  * A combination of bugs which allowed .cpg files to be overlooked has been
    fixed (#726).
  * On entering a collection context (Collection.__enter__) a new anonymous GDAL
    environment is created if needed and entered. This makes `with
    fiona.open(...) as collection:` roughly equivalent to `with fiona.open(...)
    as collection, Env():`. This helps prevent bugs when Collections are created
    and then used later or in different scopes.
  * Missing GDAL support for TopoJSON, GeoJSONSeq, and ESRIJSON has been enabled
    (#721).
  * A regression in handling of polygons with M values (#724) has been fixed.
  * Per-feature debug logging calls in OGRFeatureBuilder methods have been
    eliminated to improve feature writing performance (#718).
  * Native support for datasets in Google Cloud Storage identified by "gs"
    resource names has been added (#709).
  * Support has been added for triangle, polyhedral surface, and TIN geometry
    types (#679).
  * Notes about using the MemoryFile and ZipMemoryFile classes has been added to
    the manual (#674).

- Rename package to python-Fiona
- Install license and documentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  6 09:05:08 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to last version 1.8.4
  + There are no known breaking changes in 1.8.0. Python warnings
    should be expected in several cases of class and method
    deprecation.
  + The fiona.drivers() context manager is being replaced by
    fiona.Env(), which also registers format drivers and has the
    same properties as the GDAL configuration manager in Rasterio.
  + Collection slicing will be disallowed in a future version of
    Fiona to remove the confusion between mapping and list semantics
    for Collection objects. Code such as
    fiona.open(“example.shp”)[1:10]
    should be changed to list(fiona.open(“example.shp”))[1:10].
- Packaging: Minimal spec-cleaner
  + Remove unneeded requires: python
