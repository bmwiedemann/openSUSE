  2.002000	2023-01-01	Happy Fibonacci Day! 1/1/23
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - When Foo is a parameterized StrMatch type, ensure is_Foo always returns
     a single boolean value, even in list context.
     Diab Jerius++
   [ Documentation ]
   - Update NEWS.
   - Update copyright dates to 2023.
   [ Packaging ]
   - Repackage as stable.
  2.001_002	2022-12-03
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Test `t/20-modules/Type-Tiny-Enum/exporter_lexical.t` will now run on
     older versions of Perl, provided Lexical::Sub is installed.
   [ Packaging ]
   - Depend on Exporter::Tiny 1.006000 which offers lexical export support
     for older versions of Perl, provided Lexical::Sub is installed.
   [ Other ]
   - If Type::Params signatures receive multiple unrecognized named
     arguments, the error message now lists them using
     Type::Utils::english_list() instead of just joining them with commas.
     This means that the error message will include 'and' before the last
     unrecognized named argument. If Type::Tiny::AvoidCallbacks is set to
     true while the signature is compiled, the old behaviour will be
     retained.
   - Type::Params no longer attempts to figure out the maximum number of
     expected arguments to functions which take key-value pairs. This allows
     `yourfunc(y=>1,y=>2)` to behave more intuitively, with the function just
     seeing the second value for `y`, instead of it throwing an exception
     complaining about too many arguments.
  2.001_001	2022-10-19
   [ Documentation ]
   - Typo fix in Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithMoo.
   [ Other ]
   - Type::Library will better detect if two types result in functions with
     the same name.
   - Type::Tiny::XS will now provide XS implementations of some parameterized
     ArrayLike/HashLike types.
   - When importing `use Type::Library -util`, Type::Library will now pass
     some relevant import options to Type::Utils.
  2.001_000	2022-09-29
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Avoid uninitialized warnings when creating a union between an Enum type
     and a non-Enum type.
     Diab Jerius++
   [ Documentation ]
   - Clearer documentation of Types::TypeTiny::to_TypeTiny.
   [ Test Suite ]
   - No longer report Type::Tie version at start of test suite, as Type::Tie
     is now bundled.
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Type::Library now has an undocumented, but tested and hopefully
     stable `_remove_type` method.
   - Added: Type::Tiny now has a `definition_context` attribute/method
     indicating the file and line number where a type constraint was first
     defined.
   - The list of packages Type::Tiny considers to be 'internal' has been
     moved from Error::TypeTiny to Type::Tiny.
   - Type::Tiny will now mark particular parts of its guts as readonly.
     Currently this is mainly used to prevent people pushing to and popping
     from type constraints which overload `@{}`.

   - Minor fix for Class::Plain-related tests.
   [ Packaging ]
   - Repackage Type-Tiny 1.999_013 as a stable release.
  1.999_013	2022-09-23	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview N
   [ Documentation ]
   - Document usage with Class::Plain.
   - Fix pod typo in manual.
     Florian Schlichting++
   - Improvements to Type::Params documentation.
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Test usage with Class::Plain.
   [ Other ]
   - Type::Params signature_for will respect inheritance when looking for
     methods to wrap, when the `method` option is true.
  1.999_012	2022-09-21	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview M
   [ Documentation ]
   - Document in Type::Tie that Type::Tie is implicitly loaded when you tie a
     variable to a Type::Tiny type constraint. (It was already documented in
     the manual.)
   - Document the Type::Tie::BASE `type` method.
   - Removed stub pod from a bunch of internal modules. They're internal, so
     nobody should be expecting pod.
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Bundle a (renamed) copy of Type::Nano in the test suite for some tests
     combining Type::Nano and Type::Tiny type constraints, and converting
     Type::Nano to Type::Tiny.
   - Improved test cases for Type::Tie with an aim at 100% coverage.
   [ Packaging ]
   - Add Class::XSAccessor to Type::Tiny's recommendations.
   [ Other ]
   - Adding a type constraint to a type library will now also add it to the
     library's type registry. (Even though this registry is unlikely to be
     used.)
   - Rewrite much of Type::Tie to no longer use inside-out objects and avoid
     a dependency on Hash::Util::FieldHash or alternative implementations of
     fieldhashes.
   - Type::Parser's internal packages now have version numbers.
   - Type::Tie now supports variables being cloned with Clone::clone(). It
     already supported Storable::dclone().
   - Type::Tie will now try to load Class::XSAccessor::Array for a speed-up.
   - Using Type::Utils to declare a named type will now automatically add the
     type to the caller's type registry.
  1.999_011	2022-09-20	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview L
   - Added: Bundle Type::Tie which was previously in a separate distribution
     on the CPAN.
  1.999_010	2022-09-18	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview K
   [ Test Suite ]
   - More tests.
   [ Other ]
   - Eval::TypeTiny::CodeAccumulator now supports $coderef->compile(alias =>
     1).
   - If the `ws parameter is set to true in parameterized DelimitedStr type
     constraints, leading and trailing whitespace will now be permitted.
   - Non-parameterized DelimitedStr now has a coercion from ArrayRef[Str].
   - The ${^TYPE_PARAMS_MULTISIG} magic global variable is now called
     ${^_TYPE_PARAMS_MULTISIG}. The old name will still be supported for at
     least six months after the next stable release.
  1.999_009	2022-09-16	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview J
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Another test for `-base`.
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Types::Common::String now has a DelimitedStr type.
   - Improve cache key generation for parameterized types.
   - Minor improvements to the default name generator, used to generate the
     display_name for parameterized type constraints.
  1.999_008	2022-09-14	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview I
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - More sensible error message trying to import a type constraint using
     -declare outside a type library.
     Diab Jerius++
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Type::Tiny now has an exportables_by_tag method.
   - Added: Type::Tiny::_DeclaredType is now a separate module. (It was
     previously defined inline in Type/Library.pm.)
   - Eval::TypeTiny::type_to_coderef() can now handle being passed undef as a
     type constraint and will create a Type::Tiny::_DeclaredType object to
     wrap instead.
   - If a type library has been made immutable, you can no longer add new
     types and coercions to it.
   - Type::Params `signature_for` will now delay most of the signature
     compilation until the function is called for the first time, like
     `wrap_subs`/`wrap_methods` used to do. It still does enough up-front to
     detect some common errors in signatures.
   - Various Type::Library cleanups.
  1.999_007	2022-09-13	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview H
   [ Documentation ]
   - Fix pod formatting issue in Type::Params.
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Improved test cases; now 100% coverage on coveralls.io.
   [ Other ]
   - Minor refactoring, mostly to make things more easily testable.
  1.999_006	2022-09-12	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview G
   [ BACK COMPAT ]
   - If none of a multisig's alternative sigs match the parameter list
     ${^TYPE_PARAMS_MULTISIG} will be explicitly set to undef, instead of
     being left as-is.
   - The Eval::TypeTiny::HAS_LEXICAL_VARS constant no longer exists. It was
     deprecated in Type-Tiny-1.004000 (2018-07-27).
   [ Other ]
   - Get the `multiple` option working with the `signature_for` function from
     Type::Params.
   - Improved test cases and miscellaneous small bugfixes for slurpy
     parameters in Type::Params.
  1.999_005	2022-09-11	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview F
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - What was supposed to be a warning for slurpy+default in Type::Params was
     throwing an exception. Corrected to be a warning.
   [ Documentation ]
   - Minor improvements to Type::Params documentation.
   [ Other ]
   - The functionality provided by Type::Params::multisig() is now provided
     in the Type::Params v2 API. (And is slightly more functional!)
  1.999_004	2022-09-09	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview E
   [ Documentation ]
   - Minor documentation clarifications around new constructor methods for
     Type::Tiny subclasses.
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Add versions of tests for the new Type::Params v2 API which don't rely
     on Perl 5.20 features.
   - More tests for Type::Tiny::{Class,Duck,Enum,Role} exporting.
   [ Packaging ]
   - Require Exporter::Tiny 1.004001.
   [ Other ]
   - Type::Tiny::{Class,Duck,Enum,Role} subclass Exporter::Tiny instead of
     handling exports manually.
  1.999_003	2022-09-09	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview D
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Setting a default for a slurpy parameter in Type::Params now warns and
     ignores the default instead of failing to compile because of a syntax
     error.
     Zhtwn++
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Move two helper subs out of Type::Library and into
     Eval::TypeTiny, clean them up, and document them as part of the API
     (set_subname and type_to_coderef).
   - Added: Type::Tiny now has an `exportables` method which provides a list
     of functions that the type can export. Type libraries now defer to this
     when deciding what they can export.
   - Added: Type::Tiny::Class is now an exporter.
   - Added: Type::Tiny::Duck is now an exporter.
   - Added: Type::Tiny::Enum has an is_word_safe method which indicates
     whether all values in the enumeration are 'words' (i.e. contain only
     word characters).
   - Added: Type::Tiny::Enum is now an exporter.
   - Added: Type::Tiny::Role is now an exporter.
   - Added: Word-safe enumerations export constants for each value.
     Branislav Zahradník++
   - Major simplifications of Type::Library internals.
   - The NICE_PROTOTYPES constant has been moved from Type::Library to
     Eval::TypeTiny, though a copy of it is still available in Type::Library
     for backwards compatibility.
   - The intersection of two Type::Tiny::Enum objects is now a
     Type::Tiny::Enum instead of a Type::Tiny::Intersection.
     Branislav Zahradník++
   - The union of two Type::Tiny::Enum objects is now a Type::Tiny::Enum
     instead of a Type::Tiny::Union.
   - Type::Params will call default coderefs as a method for signatures where
     method => 1.
  1.999_002	2022-09-07	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview C
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Types::Common was not correctly handling the -sigs export tag.
   [ Documentation ]
   - Fix up some heading levels in the pod for Type::Params.
   - Update NEWS.
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Better tests for `strictness` option in Type::Params.
   - Improved tests for slurpy handling in Type::Params.
   - The internal module Type::Params::Signature now has some tests of its
     own.
   [ Other ]
   - Minor bugfixes and improvements to slurpy handling in Type::Params.
   - The type_default method will accept parameters, and sort-of curry them.
  1.999_001	2022-09-05	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview B
   [ Documentation ]
   - Fix misspelling of 'GitHub' in documentation.
   - Further revisions of Type::Manual.
   - Update the SYNOPSIS for Types::Standard and Type::Tiny.
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Tests for the `type_default` of all builtin types.
   [ Other ]
   - Changes to the `type_default` for a few parameterized types.
   - Types::Common now also extends Types::TypeTiny.
  1.999_000	2022-09-04	Type::Tiny 2.0 Preview A
   [ Documentation ]
   - Updated Type::Tiny::Manual to cover new features.
   [ Other ]
   - %Error::TypeTiny::CarpInternal is now an alias for %Carp::CarpInternal.
   - Added: Type::Tiny `type_default` method.
   - Added: Type::Tiny overloads `/`.
   - Added: Types::Common module.
   - The Type::Params API has had a major overhaul, introducing `signature`
     and `signature_for` functions. The `compile`, `compile_named`,
     `compile_named_oo`, `validate`, `validate_named`, `wrap_subs`, and
     `wrap_methods` functions are now considered the legacy API. There are no
     plans to drop support for the legacy API in the foreseeable future.
   - Updated: Dropping support for Perl 5.6.1 (which was released in April
     2001), 5.6.2 (November 2003), and Perl 5.8.0 (July 2002). Type::Tiny now
     requires at least Perl 5.8.1.
   - Updated: Require Exporter::Tiny 1.004000+. (Previously required
     Exporter::Tiny 1.000000.)

   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Parameterizable type constraints have a name generator, which is a
     coderef that generates the names of their parameterized child type
     constraints. The default name generator now strips ASCII control
     characters (such as null, tab, and new line) from names it generates.

Mon Aug 15 03:09:19 UTC 2022 - Tina Müller <timueller+perl@suse.de>

- updated to 1.016008
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Type-Tiny/Changes

  1.016008	2022-08-14
   - Added: Type::Params now has a `goto_next` option, which if set to a
     coderef will generate a signature which on success, instead of returning
     @_, passes @_ to the coderef. If `goto_next` is set to true, the
     signature instead expects to be passed such a coderef as its first
     argument.
   - Eval::TypeTiny::CodeAccumulator now better handles placeholders.
   - Type::Params `wrap_subs` and `wrap_methods` internally use `goto_next`.
  1.016007	2022-08-04
   - Added: Type::Params now has a `strictness` option, which if set to false
     (or certain strings of Perl code that evaluate to false) will skip type
     checks apart from when needed for coercions, skip parameter count
     checks, and skip checks for unknown named parameters. You generally
     don't want to set it to false or indeed set it at all.
  1.016006	2022-07-25
   [ Documentation ]
   - Added a new page to the manual: Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithMite.
   [ Other ]
   - Type::Tiny now overloads 0+ to return a unique number per type
     constraint.
  1.016005	2022-07-23
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Minor bugfix in Type::Tiny::cmp where in some cases it was returning '0'
     instead of '0E0'; unlikely to affect anything.
   [ Other ]
   - Updated: Updated Type::Params benchmarking scripts.
   - When Type::Registry/Type::Parser has to create a class or role type
     constraint, use Types::Standard InstanceOf/ConsumerOf instead of
     creating new anonymous Type::Tiny::Class/Type::Tiny::Role constraints.
  1.016004	2022-07-22
   - Added: Type::Params now allows named parameters to have aliases.
  1.016003	2022-07-22
   - Catalyst was relying on the internals of the old slurpy function. Next
     release of Catalyst should fix that, but this version of Types::Standard
     introduces a workaround for the issue without going back to implementing
     Slurpy the old way. (The Catalyst test suite passes at least!)
   - In most places that accept a Slurpy, happily accept a child of a child
     of a child of Slurpy.
   - Rename Type::Params::Coderef to Eval::TypeTiny::CodeAccumulator as it's
     not really Type::Params-specific. Add test cases for it and make it part
     of the public API.
   - Use Eval::TypeTiny::CodeAccumulator in compile_match_on_type.
   - When Type::Tiny's is_subtype_of, etc methods are called passing a string
     as a parameter, pay attention to calling package's type registry.
  1.016002	2022-07-19
   [ BACK COMPAT ]
   - The slurpy(Foo) function from Types::Standard has been replaced by a new
     Slurpy parameterized type, so you can use Slurpy[Foo] instead. A
     slurpy() function is still provided for backwards compatibility, but if
     you were relying on the internal detail that this used to return an
     unblessed hashref, this release might break that assumption.
  1.016001	2022-07-18
   - Allow Type::Utils::extends to extend Type::Library::Compiler libraries.
   - Allow the add_types method of Type::Registry to consume
     Type::Library::Compiler libraries.
   - Improved coercion of Type::Library::Compiler's type constraints to
     Type::Tiny.
  1.016000	2022-07-16
   - Add a clone option to parameters in Type::Params to clone them with
     Storable::dclone(). This is mostly a test of how much easier improving
     Type::Params is since it was refactored.
  1.015_003	2022-07-16
   - The simple case of compile() with no parameters was broken by
     refactoring. It should now work.
  1.015_002	2022-07-16
   - Defaults for Type::Params parameters can now be a reference to a string
     of Perl code (like Mite).
  1.015_001	2022-07-16
   - Type::Params::Signature now avoids using the word `return` in its
     generated source code, as MooX::Press was using that as a talisman. Also
     avoid using the `return` keyword to return the final results of the
     signature check, as falling through performs better on older Perls, plus
     it enables MooX::Press to convert the coderef into a do{} block.
  1.015_000	2022-07-16
   [ BACK COMPAT ]
   - Type::Params is now smarter at calculating the expected $#_ for
     functions which take named parameters, so it can 'fail early' more often
     when there are extra parameters or missing required parameters. This
     means you may get errors indicating the wrong number of parameters when
     you were previously getting errors indicating particular unrecognized or
     missing required parameters. This may break test suites which were
     looking for particular error messages.
   [ Other ]
   - Major refactoring of Type::Params, splitting out signature compilation
     into separate backend OO-modules which Type::Params now acts as a
     frontend for. Compiling signature checks is probably now a little
     slower, but once they're compiled Type::Params is still the fastest Perl
     implementation of typed parameter checks. This refactor should make the
     code easier to work with, add new features to, and tweak the performance
     of.

  1.012000	2020-10-28
   [ Documentation ]
   - Update NEWS file.
  1.011_011	2020-10-16
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Bugs in old versions of Return::Type prevent integration tests from
     passing on Perl 5.8.x; those tests now require Return::Type 0.007 or
     above.
   - More tests for Type::Coercion::FromMoose.
   [ Packaging ]
   - If the EXTENDED_TESTING environment variable is true, Perl 5.8.9 or
     above is being used, and either Type::Tiny's version contains '_' or
     testing is running on Travis CI, then Makefile.PL will add extra testing
     dependencies.
   [ Other ]
   - Remove unnecessary BEGIN block in Eval::TypeTiny.
  1.011_010	2020-10-16
   - Simple useful coercions from Str for Type::Tiny::Enum (and

     distribution and edge cases.
   [ Other ]
   - More efficient use of Type::Tiny::XS by Types::TypeTiny.
   - Refactoring of Types::TypeTiny.
   - Where various parts of Type::Tiny internally use type constraints to
     check values, prefer is_* and assert_* functions over method calls.
  1.011_008	2020-10-07
   [ Documentation ]
   - Some minor tidyups and updates to Type::Tiny::Manual.
   [ Test Suite ]

     Type::Library -declare flag.
   - Test integration with Type::Nano as an example of a generic
     non-Type::Tiny type constraint class.
   - Test that $type->() works with subclasses that override the
     assert_return method.
   - Write tests for some internal undocumented methods.
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Type::Utils::assert() function.
  1.011_007	2020-10-06
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - ArgsObject inlining was closing over a coderef in a way that didn't work
     on archaic versions of Perl. Resolve by calling the coderef outside the
     closure.
  1.011_006	2020-10-02
   [ Documentation ]
   - Include JSONCapable type example.
   [ Test Suite ]

   - Improved test coverage for Type::Params.
   - Improved test coverage for Type::Registry.
   - Improved test coverage for Type::Tiny::Union.

   - Test::TypeTiny's should_pass and should_fail exercise type constraints
     in even more ways in EXTENDED_TESTING mode.
  1.011_005	2020-09-30
   - Added: Type::Library import now supports -extends and -utils flags.
   - Type::Library -base import flag now marks the caller package as loaded
     in %INC.

   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Make predeclared type constraints work better for Zydeco.
   [ Documentation ]
   - Document that ArrayLike and HashLike are now parameterizable.
   [ Test Suite ]
   - Make test suite work better with App::Yath.
  1.011_003	2020-09-25
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Old versions of Data::Dumper would sometimes die when dumping certain
     overloaded objects. Type::Tiny::_dd() now catches this in an eval {}.
   - Types::Standard would sometimes complain about very old versions of
     Scalar::Util.
   [ Other ]
   - ArrayLike and HashLike are now parameterizable, though the
     implementation for the parameterized version is in pure Perl, not XS.
   - Type::Tiny::Enum better caches regexps.
   - Updated: ArrayLike, HashLike, CodeLike, and StringLike type constraints
     can use XS if Type::Tiny::XS 0.022 is installed.
  1.011_002	2020-09-22
   - Added: Type::Utils now exports an `is` function but it needs to be
     requested explicitly.

   [ Documentation ]
   - Update the NEWS file.
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Add new list processing functions to Type::Tiny.

   [ Other ]
   - Better handling of coercions for pre-declared types in Type::Library.
     The type objects created before the type was properly defined will now
     lazily attempt to find coercions from the properly defined type once it
     becomes available.

   [ Documentation ]
   - Mention MooX::Pression.
  
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Type::Params now supports `head` and `tail` options for
     `compile`, `compile_named`, and `compile_named_oo`.
   - Parameterized `Ref` type constraint in Types::Standard now checks its
     parameter is a known Perl ref type.

   [ Test Suite ]
   - More tests for recursively defined type constraints.

   - Subclasses of Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint are now converted to the
     appropriate subclasses of Type::Tiny by Types::TypeTiny::to_TypeTiny,
     instead of always being converted to the base class. This improves
     inlining amongst other things.
   - When types are declared by Type::Library's -declare import parameter,
     the temporary subs installed can now generate placeholder type
     constraints which allow the types to be used in recursive type
     definitions.

   - When possible, inject `package Type::Tiny` in generated inline code that
     has an appropriate lexical scope to insert it into. This will (mostly)
     avoid inline code mistakenly using overridden versions of CORE::

     <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=101582>
     <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/pull/16>
   - StrMatch changes in previous release broke the ability to check type
     equality between two parameterized StrMatch types under some
     circumstances. Changed how the hash key for stashing regexp references
     gets built — is now closer to the old way. This doesn't revert the
     change in 1.001_012 where regexp checks can be inlined better, but only
     applies to those regexp references that can't easily be inlined.
  
  1.001_012	2017-05-17
  
   [ BACK COMPAT ]
   - RegexpRef now accepts blessed objects if $object->isa('Regexp') returns
     true.
  
   [ Other ]
   - StrMatch will use Regexp::Util (if available) to inline regular
     expressions more sensibly.
  
  1.001_011	2017-05-17
  
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Type constraints like Tuple[Int] shouldn't report they have a coercion
     if Int doesn't have a coercion.
  
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Types::Standard now has a CycleTuple type.
  
  1.001_010	2017-05-16	Puppiversary
  
   [ Test Suite ]
   - t/00-begin.t will now work around ANDK's apparently broken XS testing
     environment.
  
  1.001_009	2017-05-13
  
   - Rewrite some benchmarking scripts to use
     Benchmark::Featureset::ParamCheck.
   - Use Ref::Util::XS (if it's installed) to speed up certain type checks.
  
  1.001_008	2017-05-10
  
   [ Bug Fixes ]
   - Type::Params should make sure Type::Utils is loaded before calling
     english_list().
  
   [ Documentation ]
   - Rearrange the examples directory in the distribution.
  
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Named parameter validation benchmarking script.
   - Added: Reduce scope of local $SIG{__DIE__} in Type::Registry.
     Graham Knop++
  
  1.001_007	2017-05-04	May the fourth be with you
  
   [ Documentation ]
   - Comparison of Type::Params with new(ish) CPAN module
     Params::ValidationCompiler.
   - Show example of how to set defaults for parameters with Type::Params.
  
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Type::Params' `multisig` function now sets a variable
     `${^TYPE_PARAMS_MULTISIG}` to indicate which signature succeeded.
   - Optimization of Type::Params positional parameter checking for simple
     cases with no slurpy parameter and no coercions.
   - Optimizations for Tuple and StrMatch type constraints from
     Types::Standard.
  
  1.001_006	2017-04-30
  
   - Allow Type::Tiny's `constraint` parameter to be a string of Perl code.
   - Localize $SIG{__DIE__} in Type::Registry.
     Fixes RT#100780.
     <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=100780>

     versions of Moose and Moo than we were testing before.
  
   [ Other ]
   - Added: Type::Params now provides `compile_named` and `validate_named`
     functions which do the same thing as `compile` and `validate` but are
     better for named arguments.
