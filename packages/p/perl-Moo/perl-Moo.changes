  2.005005 - 2023-01-05
    - drop dependency on Test::Fatal

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- updated to 2.005004
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Moo/Changes

  2.005004 - 2021-03-29
    - fix file set in %INC in create_class_with_roles (RT#134845)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 22 03:08:19 UTC 2021 - Tina Müller <timueller+perl@suse.de>

- updated to 2.005003
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Moo/Changes

  2.005003 - 2021-03-21
    - silence 'once' warnings from Moo::_Utils
  2.005_002 - 2021-01-22
    - fix C3 test skipping properly when MRO::Compat not available on perl < 5.10
  2.005_001 - 2021-01-20
    - fix perl version check in global destruction code
  2.005_000 - 2021-01-20
    - remove MooseX::Types from developer prereqs
    - recommend Sub::Util rather than Sub::Name, since Sub::Util is in core
    - fix line numbers when using oo module (perl -Moo)
    - adjust some author tests to rely less on external modules
    - lower Exporter prereq to any version
    - bump Role::Tiny prereq to 2.003004
    - refactor and simplify role application code, as allowed by new Role::Tiny
      version
    - switch to using normal strict+warnings rather than strictures for authors
    - remove strictures from recommends, as Moo does not use it anywhere
    - remove Task::Weaken prereq, as it served no purpose
    - remove MRO::Compat prereq, using it only when user code does
    - remove use of Devel::GlobalDestruction in code, only using
      Devel::GlobalDestruction::XS when it is available. Devel::GlobalDestruction
      is still a dependency on perl < 5.14 to facilitate the installation of the
      ::XS module.
    - Moo now has no mandatory perl version specific dependencies. The version
      specific modules are now optional or not used. This means code using Moo can
      be fatpacked on a new perl version without special cases, and it will work
      on older perl versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 23 06:42:40 UTC 2016 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.002002
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Moo/Changes

  2.002002 - 2016-06-21
    - fix handling of Carp < 1.12
  
  2.002_001 - 2016-06-17
    - added Sub::Quote::sanitize_identifier to generate an identifier from an
      arbitrary string.
    - Sub::Defer::defer_info is now exportable.
    - improved documentation for Sub::Quote.
    - fix quoted subs with no_defer ignoring no_install option. (RT#114605)
    - internals of Sub::Quote were refactored.
    - error message when @ISA changes now includes the location that the
      constructor was generated.
    - original invoker will be used when calling a non-Moo parent constructor.
      (RT#115189)
    - added testing for preserving context into quote_sub subs. (RT#114511)
    - quote_sub context options will be used even when zero. (RT#114512)
    - Sub::Defer::defer_sub gained attributes option to specify sub attributes.
    - Sub::Quote::quote_sub gained attributes option to specify sub attributes.
  
  2.002_000 - 2016-05-18
    - Use Carp::croak rather than die to improve reported error locations
      (RT#109844, RT#109632, RT#102622)
    - removed Method::Inliner module.  It was never intended to ship with Moo,
      and was undocumented, untested, and unused on CPAN.
    - require Role::Tiny 2.000002 for fixes to method modifiers being applied
      via multiple role composition paths (RT#106668)
    - Delay loading Class::Method::Modifiers until we actually need it
    - Fix an explosion that could happen if meta inflation was attempted part way
      through Moo's bootstrapping process, which was possible via a
      CORE::GLOBAL::bless override (RT#113743)
    - Accessor subs will be generated immediately, rather than being partially
      deferred.  The deferal added extra sub layers and the delayed compilation
      didn't provide any real benefit for them.
    - Numeric values used as defaults will be inlined as numbers rather than
      strings.
    - Numerous test cleanups and additional test coverage
    - Fixed a typo in Sub::Defer docs (RT#113416)
    - Deferred subs (including constructors) will always be named properly, even
      if neither Sub::Name nor Sub::Util are available.  This improves
      compatibility with namespace::autoclean, among other things.  Once the sub
      is undeferred, it may not be given a correct name if Sub::Name or Sub::Util
      aren't available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  7 10:25:21 UTC 2016 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.001001
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Moo/Changes

  2.001001 - 2016-03-04
    - Fixed order of attribute value being set and trigger running when there is
      an isa check present. (RT#112677)
    - Corrected LIFECYCLE METHODS to be a head1 section rather than head2.
  
  2.001000 - 2016-02-29
    * Documentation
      - Added documentation for has's ability to accept an arrayref of attribute
        names to create with the same options.
      - Removed mention that we may not call BUILDARGS, since that behavior was
        removed in 2.000002.
      - Reorganized documentation of class methods to separate those provided as a
        public API (new/does/meta) from those used by Moo in the object lifecycle
        (BUILDARGS/FOREIGNBUILDARGS/BUILD/DEMOLISH).
      - Updated documentation of most class methods for clarity.
      - Updated BUILDARGS documentation to show an around rather than just
        overriding.
      - Added examples to FOREIGNBUILDARGS and BUILD.
      - Added explicit documentation for DOES and meta methods.
  
    * Fixes
      - Fixed grammar in error message when @ISA is changed unexpectedly before
        a constructor is fully generated.
      - Fixed Moo classes and Sub::Quote subs in packages that are nearly 252
        characters long.
      - Fixed Sub::Defer::undefer_package emitting warnings.
      - Fixed detection of constructors that have already been inlined.
  
    * Performance
      - The generated code in constructors and setters has had a number of
        microoptimizations applied.
      - Deferred subs (and quoted subs like some accessors) in roles will be
        undefered before copying them to classes.  This prevents the need for a
        goto on every call that would slow down the subs.
      - Fixed Moose inflation code resulting in constructors with deferred
        wrappers.
  
    * Other
      - Recommend Sub::Name 0.08, which fixes a memory leak.
      - The values given to BUILD subs will be the original values passed to new,
        rather than after coercions have been applied.  This brings the behavior
        in line with Moose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 25 08:54:22 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.000002
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Moo/Changes

  2.000002 - 2015-07-24
    - BUILDARGS will now always be called on object creation, even if no
      attributes exist
    - fix required attributes with spaces or other odd characters in init_arg
    - fix (is => 'lazy', required => 1, init_arg => undef), which previously
      didn't think it provided a builder
    - under 'no Moo::sification', prevent automatic Moose metaclass inflation
      from ->meta calls
    - don't load Moo::Role for a ->does check if no roles could exist
    - make global destruction test more robust from outside interference
    - fix false default values satisfying required attributes
    - Fix Moose attribute delegation to a Moo class via a wildcard
    - work around case where Sub::Util is loadable but doesn't provide
      Sub::Util::set_subname
    - skip thread tests on perl 5.8.4 and below where threads are extremely
      unreliable
    - Allow stub methods (e.g. sub foo;) to be overwritten by accessors or other
      generated methods. (RT#103804)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 14 20:56:43 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.000001
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Moo/Changes

  2.000001 - 2015-03-16
    - Fix how we pick between Sub::Name and Sub::Util if they are both loaded.
      This fixes how we interact with Moose in some cases. (RT#102729) (GH#15)
  
  2.000000 - 2015-03-02
    * Incompatible Changes
      - Fatal warnings and the other additional checks from the strictures
        module will no longer be applied to modules using Moo or Moo::Role.  We
        now only apply strict and (non-fatal) warnings, matching the behavior of
        Moose.
      - Classes without attributes used to store everything passed to ->new
        in the object.  This has been fixed to not store anything in the object,
        making it consistent with classes that had attributes.
      - Moo will now pass __no_BUILD__ to parent constructors when inheriting
        from a Moose or Class::Tiny class, to prevent them from calling BUILD
        functions.  Moo calls the BUILD functions itself, which previously led
        to them being called multiple times.
      - Attempting to replace an existing constructor, or modify one that has
        been used, will throw an error.  This includes adding attributes.
        Previously, this would result in some attributes being silently ignored
        by the constructor.
      - If a class's @ISA is modified without using 'extends' in a way that
        affects object construction, Moo will detect this and throw an error.
        This can happen in code that uses ->load_components from
        Class::C3::Componentised, which is common in DBIx::Class modules.
  
    * Bug Fixes
      - Fix calling class methods on Moo::HandleMoose::FakeMetaClass, such as
        modules scanning all classes
  
    * Miscellaneous
      - use Sub::Util instead of Sub::Name if available
  
  1.007000 - 2015-01-21
    - fix Moose metaclass inflation of Method::Generate::Constructor (RT#101111)
    - clarify behavior of clearers for non-lazy attribute defaults
    - add Sub::Defer::undefer_package to undefer all subs from a given package
    - existing attributes will no longer be overwritten when composing roles.
      Previously, the attribute configuration used by the constructor would be
      overridden, but the attribute methods would not be.  This caused a mismatch
      in attribute behavior.
    - link to Type::Tiny in docs rather than MooX::Types::MooseLike
    - document exports of Sub::Defer
    - fix capture_unroll usage in inlinify example
    - fix needless re-assigning of variables in generated Sub::Quote subs
    - fix global destruction test to work when perl path has spaces

   - always maintain source of quoted subs for the lifetime of the sub
   - fix Sub::Quote and Sub::Defer leaking memory
   - Class::XSAccessor is now listed as a recommended prerequisite
   - fix generating a subclass with roles when using a non-standard accessor
   - use alternate quoting routine, which is faster and saves memory by not
     loading B.pm
   - fix default of undef
   - fix inheriting from a class with a prototype on new
   - use ->is_role internally to check if a package is a role

  - fix handling of type inflation when used with threads
  - don't include meta method when consuming Mouse roles
  - inhale Moose roles for has attr => ( handles => "RoleName" )

    init_arg => undef
  - document that BUILDARGS isn't called when there are no attributes
  - omit sub imported before use Moo from Moose method inflation
  - check for FOREIGNBUILDARGS only once per class instead of on each

Tue Jun  4 08:46:21 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.002000
   - add 'moosify' attribute key to provide code for inflating to Moose
   - fix warnings about unknown attribute parameters on metaclass inflation
   - don't pass 'handles' down when doing 'has +' to avoid unDWIMmy explosions
   - throw a useful exception when typemap doesn't return a value
   - avoid localising @_ when not required for Sub::Quote
   - successfully inflate a metaclass for attributeless classes (RT#86415)
   - fix false default values used with non-lazy accessors
   - stop built values that fail isa checks still getting stored in the object
   - stop lazy+weak_ref accessors re-building their value on every call
   - make lazy+weak_ref accessors return undef if built value isn't already
     stored elsewhere (Moose compatibility)
   - stop isa checks being called on every access for lazy attributes
   - bump Devel::GlobalDestruction dependency to fix warning on cleanup
     when run under -c (RT#78617)
   - document Moose type constraint creation for roles and classes
     (actually fixed in 1.001000)
 
 1.001000 - 2013-03-16
   - add support for FOREIGNBUILDARGS when inheriting from non-Moo classes
   - non-ref default values are allowed without using a sub
   - has will refuse to overwrite locally defined subs with generated
     accessors.
   - added more meta resources and added more support relevant links into
     the POD documentation
   - clarify in docs that default and built values won't call triggers
     (RT#82310)
   - expand is => 'lazy' doc to make it clear that you can make rw lazy
     attributes if you really want to
   - handles => "RoleName" tries to load the module
   - fix delegation to false/undef attributes (RT#83361)
 
 1.000008 - 2013-02-06
   - Re-export on 'use Moo' after 'no Moo'
   - Export meta() into roles (but mark as non-method to avoid composing it)
   - Don't generate an accessor for rw attributes if reader+writer both set
   - Support builder => sub {} ala MooseX::AttributeShortcuts
   - Fix 'no Moo;' to preserve non-sub package variables
   - Switch to testing for Mouse::Util->can('find_meta') to avoid
     exploding on ancient Mouse installs
   - Fix loading order bug that results in _install_coderef being treated
     as indirect object notation
 
 1.000007 - 2012-12-15
   - Correctly handle methods dragged along by role composition
   - Die if Moo and Moo::Role are imported into the same package
 
 1.000006 - 2012-11-16
   - Don't use $_ as loop variable when calling arbitrary code (RT#81072)
   - Bump Role::Tiny prereq to fix method modifier breakage on 5.10.0
 
 1.000005 - 2012-10-23
   - fix POD typo (RT#80060)
   - include init_arg name in constructor errors (RT#79596)
   - bump Class::Method::Modifiers dependency to avoid warnings on 5.8

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 11 12:20:22 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.009013
  - fix up Class::XSAccessor version check to be more robust
  - improved documentation
  - fix failures on perls < 5.8.3
  - fix test failures on cygwin

  - make Method::Generate::Constructor handle $obj->new
  - fix bug where constants containing a reference weren't handled correctly
    (ref(\[]) is 'REF' not 'SCALAR', ref(\v1) is 'VSTRING')

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 11 12:15:56 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- update to 0.009011:

    subclasses with a BUILD method but no attributes get it honoured
  - add coerce handling
