%description
'Moo' is an extremely light-weight Object Orientation system. It allows one
to concisely define objects and roles with a convenient syntax that avoids
the details of Perl's object system. 'Moo' contains a subset of Moose and
is optimised for rapid startup.

'Moo' avoids depending on any XS modules to allow for simple deployments.
The name 'Moo' is based on the idea that it provides almost -- but not
quite -- two thirds of Moose. As such, the Moose::Manual can serve as an
effective guide to 'Moo' aside from the MOP and Types sections.

Unlike Mouse this module does not aim at full compatibility with Moose's
surface syntax, preferring instead to provide full interoperability via the
metaclass inflation capabilities described in MOO AND MOOSE.

For a full list of the minor differences between Moose and Moo's surface
syntax, see INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH MOOSE.
