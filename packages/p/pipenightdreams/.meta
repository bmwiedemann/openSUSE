  <title>Puzzle game similar to PipeMania</title>
  <description>PipeNightDreams is a PipeDream style game. The objetive of the game
is to carry liquid from some point to the exit using different kinds
of pipes. On each level there is a minimum number of required pipes
that should be at least reached for it to be completed.

The score is increased by using as many pipes as possible an by
collecting various bonus tokens making the liquid pass through their
pipes. There are also life bonus and, hopefully soon, &quot;freeze tokens&quot;.</description>
