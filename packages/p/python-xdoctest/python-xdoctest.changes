- version update to 1.1.1
  ## Version 1.1.1
  ### Changed
  * Binary tests are now only run on "full" installs to reduce minimal dependencies.
  * Support for Python 3.11
  * Minor typing fixes

  ## Version 1.1.0 - Released 2022-09-05
  ### Fixed
  * Can now handle basic versions of the new `__editable__` package finder mechanism.
  * Parsing bug where directives were incorrectly flagged as inline if they were
    directly followed by a function with a decorator.
  ### Removed
  * Dropped 2.7 and 3.5 support. Now supporting 3.6+ Use xdoctest<=1.0.2 for 2.7
    or 3.5 support.
  ### Changed
  * Improved the "dump" functionality of converting doctests to unit tests.

  ## Version 1.0.2 - Released 2022-08-19
  ### Added
  * Environs as options:
    `XDOCTEST_VERBOSE`, `XDOCTEST_OPTIONS`, `XDOCTEST_GLOBAL_EXEC`, `XDOCTEST_REPORT`,
    `XDOCTEST_STYLE`, and `XDOCTEST_ANALYSIS` environment variables can now be used
    to specify configuration defaults.
  ### Changed
  * Added experimental hidden feature `--insert-skip-directive-above-failures`
    that can be used to modify your code such that failing doctests are marked as
    skip.
  * Disabled traceback suppression on module import errors (this is is
    configurable via the `supress_import_errors` option).
  * Xdoctest will no longer try to pre-import the module if none of its doctests
    have any enabled lines. This also means global-exec statements will NOT run
    for those tests, which means you can no longer use global-exec to
    force enabling tests.

  ## Version 1.0.1 - Released 2022-07-10
  ### Added
  * Add type stubs
  * Basic support for pyproject.toml under `tool.xdoctest`. Currently only
    supports options in the native runner.
  ### Fixed
  * Corner case bug in error reporting
  * Doctests that never run any code are now correctly marked as skipped
  * Issue where the "dumps" command was undocumented and has an error.
  ### Changed
  * Moved some globals into a new module called `global_state` and allowed
    environs to enable debug print statements.
  * Added `util_deprecation` module to robustly mark features as deprecated.
  * Modified the google style return type parser to return a type if the
    only content is some parsable python code.
  * Modified docscrape google to allow for parsing of `*args` and `**kwargs` in
    args blocks. This has also moved to the standalone package `googledoc`
  * Overhaul of repo structure in an effort to modernize and to agree with
    templates defined by xcookie
  * Module code now lives in the "src" directory to remove install vs develop
    ambiguity.

  ## Version 1.0.0 - Released 2022-03-25
  ### Added
  * Support for Python 3.10
  ### Fixed
  * Warning in pytest8
  * Spelling errors in documentation
* added patches
