    <comment>- update to 1.0.2:
  * Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This required changes
    in several areas including dependent packages used for testing and
    coverage. This did not cause any changes on dependent packages used for the
    installation of the package.</comment>

    <comment>- update to 1.0.3:
  * Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning coveralls-python to &lt;3.0.0 (issue #55).
  * Fixed issues raised by new Pylint 2.9 and 2.10.
  * Fixed a dependency error that caused importlib-metadata to be installed on
    Python 3.8, while it is included in the Python base.
  * Disabled new Pylint issue 'consider-using-f-string', since f-strings were
    introduced only in Python 3.6.
  * Fixed install error of wrapt 1.13.0 on Python 2.7 on Windows due to lack of
    MS Visual C++ 9.0 on GitHub Actions, by pinning it to &lt;1.13.
  * Fixed potential issue with Sphinx/docutils versions on Python 2.7.
  * Fixed error when installing virtualenv in install test on Python 2.7.
  * Fixed that the added setup.py commands (test, leaktest, installtest) were
    not displayed. They are now displayed at verbosity level 1 (using '-v').
  * Support for Python 3.10: Added Python 3.10 in GitHub Actions tests, and in package metadata.
  * Removed old tools that were needed for travis and Appveyor but no longer on</comment>
