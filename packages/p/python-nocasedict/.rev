    <comment>- update to 1.0.2:
  * Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This required changes
    in several areas including dependent packages used for testing and
    coverage. This did not cause any changes on dependent packages used for the
    installation of the package.</comment>

    <comment>- update to 1.0.3:
  * Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning coveralls-python to &lt;3.0.0 (issue #55).
  * Fixed issues raised by new Pylint 2.9 and 2.10.
  * Fixed a dependency error that caused importlib-metadata to be installed on
    Python 3.8, while it is included in the Python base.
  * Disabled new Pylint issue 'consider-using-f-string', since f-strings were
    introduced only in Python 3.6.
  * Fixed install error of wrapt 1.13.0 on Python 2.7 on Windows due to lack of
    MS Visual C++ 9.0 on GitHub Actions, by pinning it to &lt;1.13.
  * Fixed potential issue with Sphinx/docutils versions on Python 2.7.
  * Fixed error when installing virtualenv in install test on Python 2.7.
  * Fixed that the added setup.py commands (test, leaktest, installtest) were
    not displayed. They are now displayed at verbosity level 1 (using '-v').
  * Support for Python 3.10: Added Python 3.10 in GitHub Actions tests, and in package metadata.
  * Removed old tools that were needed for travis and Appveyor but no longer on</comment>

    <comment>- update to 2.1.0:
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 because they are out
    of service and to simplify development dependencies. (issue
    #214)
  * Dev: Changed 'make install' to no longer perform an editable
    install, but a standalone install, since pip will remove
    support for editable installs. (related to issue #180)
  * Dev: Removed support for the env.var TEST_INSTALLED that used
    the installed package for testing, for simplicity. Now, the
    local package in the repository main directory is always used
    for testing.
  * Test: Python 3.13 was pinned to 3.13.0 to work around a
    pylint issue on Python 3.13.1.
  * Addressed safety issues up to 2025-04-27.
  * Dev: Added missing dependencies for development.
  * Test: Fixed the issue that coveralls was not found in the
    test workflow on MacOS with Python 3.9-3.11, by running it
    without login shell. Added Python 3.11 on MacOS to the normal
    tests.
  * Added support for Python 3.13. This required increasing the
    minimum version of several packages needed for development.
    (issue #225)
  * Added '__version_tuple__' with the integer versions. (related
    to issue #180)
  * Dev: Changed from setup.py to using pyproject.toml. (issue
    #180)
  * Dev: Split safety policy files into one for installation
    dependencies and one for development dependencies. (issue
    #205, related to issue #180)
  * Dev: Split minimum-constraints.txt file into one for</comment>
