- update to 2.1.0:
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 because they are out
    of service and to simplify development dependencies. (issue
    #214)
  * Dev: Changed 'make install' to no longer perform an editable
    install, but a standalone install, since pip will remove
    support for editable installs. (related to issue #180)
  * Dev: Removed support for the env.var TEST_INSTALLED that used
    the installed package for testing, for simplicity. Now, the
    local package in the repository main directory is always used
    for testing.
  * Test: Python 3.13 was pinned to 3.13.0 to work around a
    pylint issue on Python 3.13.1.
  * Addressed safety issues up to 2025-04-27.
  * Dev: Added missing dependencies for development.
  * Test: Fixed the issue that coveralls was not found in the
    test workflow on MacOS with Python 3.9-3.11, by running it
    without login shell. Added Python 3.11 on MacOS to the normal
    tests.
  * Added support for Python 3.13. This required increasing the
    minimum version of several packages needed for development.
    (issue #225)
  * Added '__version_tuple__' with the integer versions. (related
    to issue #180)
  * Dev: Changed from setup.py to using pyproject.toml. (issue
    #180)
  * Dev: Split safety policy files into one for installation
    dependencies and one for development dependencies. (issue
    #205, related to issue #180)
  * Dev: Split minimum-constraints.txt file into one for
    installation dependencies and one for development
    dependencies. (related to issue #180)
  * Dev: Cleanup in the Makefile. (related to issue #180)
  * Docs: Changed versions shown for the documentation to be
    master and the latest fix version of each minor version.
    Changed documentation links in README file to reference the
    master version.

    eliminate warnings about node v16.

- Update to 2.0.3:
  * Installation of this package using “setup.py” is no longer supported.
  * Fixed issues resulting from removal of support for pytest.warns(None)
    in pytest version 8.
  * Added support for Python 3.12.
- Switch to pyproject macros.

Thu Sep 14 11:43:21 UTC 2023 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.0.1
  * Fixed coveralls issues with KeyError and HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity.
  * Removed support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5. The minimum required Python version
    is now 3.6. This was needed in order to add Python type hints (issue #123).
  * Enabled Github Actions for stable branches.
  * Addressed new issues of Pylint 2.16.
  * Added type hints and type checking with MyPy (issue #123).
  * Resurrected support for byte string keys that was removed in version 1.1.0.
    (issue #139)
  * The default casefolding method on Python 3 was changed from `str.lower()`
    to `str.casefold()`. This changes the matching of the case-insensitive keys.
    This shold normally be an improvement, but in case you find that you are
    negatively affected by this change, you can go back to the `str.lower()`
    method by overriding the `NocaseDict.__casefold__()` method with a method
    that calls `str.lower()`. (issue #122)
  * Added support for Python 3.11.
  * Changed the default casefolding method on Python 3 to be `str.casefold()`
    in order to improve Unicode support. On Python 2, it remains `str.lower()`.
    Added support for user-defined casefolding. (issue #122)
- drop python-six dependency

  * Fixed recursion issue with flake8 5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  8 19:53:47 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.0.3:
  * Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning coveralls-python to <3.0.0 (issue #55).
  * Fixed issues raised by new Pylint 2.9 and 2.10.
  * Fixed a dependency error that caused importlib-metadata to be installed on
    Python 3.8, while it is included in the Python base.
  * Disabled new Pylint issue 'consider-using-f-string', since f-strings were
    introduced only in Python 3.6.
  * Fixed install error of wrapt 1.13.0 on Python 2.7 on Windows due to lack of
    MS Visual C++ 9.0 on GitHub Actions, by pinning it to <1.13.
  * Fixed potential issue with Sphinx/docutils versions on Python 2.7.
  * Fixed error when installing virtualenv in install test on Python 2.7.
  * Fixed that the added setup.py commands (test, leaktest, installtest) were
    not displayed. They are now displayed at verbosity level 1 (using '-v').
  * Support for Python 3.10: Added Python 3.10 in GitHub Actions tests, and in package metadata.
  * Removed old tools that were needed for travis and Appveyor but no longer on

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  1 18:13:39 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.0.2:
  * Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This required changes
    in several areas including dependent packages used for testing and
    coverage. This did not cause any changes on dependent packages used for the
    installation of the package.
