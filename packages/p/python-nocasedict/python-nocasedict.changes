- version update to 2.0.1
  * Fixed coveralls issues with KeyError and HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity.
  * Removed support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5. The minimum required Python version
    is now 3.6. This was needed in order to add Python type hints (issue #123).
  * Enabled Github Actions for stable branches.
  * Addressed new issues of Pylint 2.16.
  * Added type hints and type checking with MyPy (issue #123).
  * Resurrected support for byte string keys that was removed in version 1.1.0.
    (issue #139)
  * The default casefolding method on Python 3 was changed from `str.lower()`
    to `str.casefold()`. This changes the matching of the case-insensitive keys.
    This shold normally be an improvement, but in case you find that you are
    negatively affected by this change, you can go back to the `str.lower()`
    method by overriding the `NocaseDict.__casefold__()` method with a method
    that calls `str.lower()`. (issue #122)
  * Added support for Python 3.11.
  * Changed the default casefolding method on Python 3 to be `str.casefold()`
    in order to improve Unicode support. On Python 2, it remains `str.lower()`.
    Added support for user-defined casefolding. (issue #122)
- drop python-six dependency

- update to 1.0.3:
  * Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning coveralls-python to <3.0.0 (issue #55).
  * Fixed issues raised by new Pylint 2.9 and 2.10.
  * Fixed a dependency error that caused importlib-metadata to be installed on
    Python 3.8, while it is included in the Python base.
  * Disabled new Pylint issue 'consider-using-f-string', since f-strings were
    introduced only in Python 3.6.
  * Fixed install error of wrapt 1.13.0 on Python 2.7 on Windows due to lack of
    MS Visual C++ 9.0 on GitHub Actions, by pinning it to <1.13.
  * Fixed potential issue with Sphinx/docutils versions on Python 2.7.
  * Fixed error when installing virtualenv in install test on Python 2.7.
  * Fixed that the added setup.py commands (test, leaktest, installtest) were
    not displayed. They are now displayed at verbosity level 1 (using '-v').
  * Support for Python 3.10: Added Python 3.10 in GitHub Actions tests, and in package metadata.
  * Removed old tools that were needed for travis and Appveyor but no longer on

- update to 1.0.2:
  * Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This required changes
    in several areas including dependent packages used for testing and
    coverage. This did not cause any changes on dependent packages used for the
    installation of the package.
