  <title>Recursive mkdir and rmdir</title>
  <description>The goal here is simply to provide recursive versions of mkdir() and
rmdir() with as little code and overhead as possible.
This module is in no way meant to derogate File::Path and is in no way an
endorsement to go out and replace all use of File::Path with
File::Path::Tiny.
