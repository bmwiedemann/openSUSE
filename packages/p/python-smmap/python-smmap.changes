- update to version 0.9.0:
  * Fixed issue with resources never being freed as mmaps were
    never closed
  * Client counting is now done manually, instead of relying on
    pyton's reference count
- additional changes from version 0.8.5:
  * Fixed Python 3.0-3.3 regression, which also causes smmap to
    become about 3 times slower depending on the code path. It's
    related to this bug (http://bugs.python.org/issue15958), which
    was fixed in python 3.4
- additional changes from version 0.8.4:
  * Fixed Python 3 performance regression
- additional changes from version 0.8.3:
  * Cleaned up code and assured it works sufficiently well with
    python 3
- update project URL
- add fdupes as BuildRequires and call it after install
- add dependencies (nose, nosexcover) for the tests
- add delete_platform_specific_test.patch: fix tests on powerpc
- pass -q to the test to avoid spamming the build log
