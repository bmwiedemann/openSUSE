- update to 1.608

    Fail and set errstr on parameter count mismatch in execute ()
 * Fixed two small memory leaks when running in mod_perl
    one in DBI->connect and one in DBI::Gofer::Execute.
    Both due to "local $ENV{...};" leaking memory.
 * Fixed DBD_ATTRIB_DELETE macro for driver authors
    and updated DBI::DBD docs thanks to Martin J. Evans.
 * Fixed 64bit issues in trace messages thanks to Charles Jardine.
 * Fixed FETCH_many() method to work with drivers that incorrectly
   return an empty list from $h->FETCH. Affected gofer.

- update to 1.605 
  * Fixed broken DBIS macro with threads on big-endian machines
    with 64bit ints but 32bit pointers.
  * Fixed the selectall_arrayref, selectrow_arrayref, and 
    selectrow_array methods that get embedded into compiled drivers
    to use the inner sth handle when passed a $sth instead of an
    sql string. Drivers will need to be recompiled to pick up 
    this change.
  * Fixed leak in neat() for some kinds of values
  * Fixed DBI::PurePerl neat() to behave more like XS neat().
  * Increased default $DBI::neat_maxlen from 400 to 1000.
  * Increased timeout on tests to accomodate very slow systems.
