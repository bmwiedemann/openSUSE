%description
The DBI is a database access module for the Perl programming language. It
defines a set of methods, variables, and conventions that provide a
consistent database interface, independent of the actual database being
used.

It is important to remember that the DBI is just an interface. The DBI is a
layer of "glue" between an application and one or more database _driver_
modules. It is the driver modules which do most of the real work. The DBI
provides a standard interface and framework for the drivers to operate
within.

This document often uses terms like _references_, _objects_, _methods_. If
you're not familiar with those terms then it would be a good idea to read
at least the following perl manuals first: perlreftut, perldsc, perllol,
and perlboot.
