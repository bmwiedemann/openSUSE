  <title>Write Perl subroutines in other programming languages</title>
  <description>Inline lets you write Perl subroutines in other programming languages,
like C, C++, Java, Python, Tcl and even Assembly. You don't need to
compile anything. All the details are handled transparently, so you can
just run your Perl script like normal.</description>
