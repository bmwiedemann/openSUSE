  <title>A simple interface to subversion's editor interface</title>
  <description>SVN::Simple::Edit wraps the subversion delta editor with a perl
friendly interface and then you could easily drive it for describing
changes to a tree. A common usage is to wrap the commit editor, so you
could make commits to a subversion repository easily.</description>
