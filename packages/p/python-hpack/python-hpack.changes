Sat Apr 22 08:11:31 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 3.0.0
  API Changes (Backward Incompatible):
  * Removed nghttp2 support. This support had rotted and was 
    essentially non-functional, so it has now been removed until 
    someone has time to re-add the support in a functional form.
  * Attempts by the encoder to exceed the maximum allowed header 
    table size via dynamic table size updates (or the absence
    thereof) are now forbidden.
  API Changes (Backward Compatible):
  * Added a new InvalidTableSizeError thrown when the encoder does 
    not respect the maximum table size set by the user.
  * Added a Decoder.max_allowed_table_size field that sets the 
    maximum allowed size of the decoder header table. See the 
    documentation for an indication of how this should be used.
  Bugfixes:
  * Up to 25% performance improvement decoding HPACK-packed 
    integers, depending on the platform.
  * HPACK now tolerates receiving multiple header table size 
    changes in sequence, rather than only one.
  * HPACK now forbids header table size changes anywhere but first 
    in a header block, as required by RFC 7541 § 4.2.
  * Other miscellaneous performance improvements.
  Version 2.3.0
  Security Fixes:
  * CVE-2016-6581: HPACK Bomb. This release now enforces a maximum 
    value of the decompressed size of the header list. This is to 
    avoid the so-called “HPACK Bomb” vulnerability, which is caused 
    when a malicious peer sends a compressed HPACK body that 
    decompresses to a gigantic header list size.
    This also adds a OversizedHeaderListError, which is thrown by 
    the decode method if the maximum header list size is being 
    violated. This places the HPACK decoder into a broken state: it 
    must not be used after this exception is thrown.
    This also adds a max_header_list_size to the Decoder object. This 
    controls the maximum allowable decompressed size of the header 
    list. By default this is set to 64kB.

- Converted to single-spec

- Enabled tests

- Fixed messy changelog. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 11:16:50 UTC 2016 - freitag@owncloud.com

- Update to version 2.2.0:
  API Changes (Backward Compatible)
  * Added HeaderTuple and NeverIndexedHeaderTuple classes that signal
    whether a given header field may ever be indexed in HTTP/2 header
    compression.
  * Changed Decoder.decode() to return the newly added HeaderTuple 
    class and subclass. These objects behave like two-tuples, so this 
    change does not break working code.
  Bugfixes
  * Improve Huffman decoding speed by 4x using an approach borrowed 
    from nghttp2.
  * Improve HPACK decoding speed by 10% by caching header table sizes.

- Bugfixes since 2.1.1:
  * When passing a dictionary or dictionary subclass to Encoder.encode, 
    HPACK now ensures that HTTP/2 special headers (headers whose names 
    begin with `:` characters) appear first in the header block.

- Changes in 2.1.0 (2016-02-02)
  API Changes (Backward Compatible)
  * Added new InvalidTableIndex exception, a subclass of 
    HPACKDecodingError.
  * Instead of throwing IndexError when encountering invalid encoded 
    integers HPACK now throws HPACKDecodingError.
  * Instead of throwing UnicodeDecodeError when encountering headers 
    that are not UTF-8 encoded, HPACK now throws HPACKDecodingError.
  * Instead of throwing IndexError when encountering invalid table 
    offsets, HPACK now throws InvalidTableIndex.
  * Added raw flag to decode, allowing decode to return bytes instead
    of attempting to decode the headers as UTF-8.
  Bugfixes
  * memoryview objects are now used when decoding HPACK, improving 
    the performance by avoiding unnecessary data copies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  6 19:43:13 UTC 2016 - freitag@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.0.1
  * Fixed a bug where the Python HPACK implementation would only 
    emit header table size changes for the total change between one 
    header block and another, rather than for the entire sequence 
    of changes.

- Additional changes from version 2.0.0 (2015-10-12)
  * Remove unused HPACKEncodingError.
  * Add the shortcut ability to import the public API (Encoder, 
    Decoder, HPACKError, HPACKDecodingError) directly, rather than 
    from hpack.hpack.
