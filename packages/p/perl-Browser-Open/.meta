  <title>Open a browser in a given URL</title>
  <description>The functions optionaly exported by this module allows you to open URLs in
the user browser.
A set of known commands per OS-name is tested for presence, and the first
one found is executed. With an optional parameter, all known commands are
checked.
The &quot;open_browser&quot; uses the &quot;system()&quot; function to execute the command. If
you want more control, you can get the command with the &quot;open_browser_cmd&quot;
or &quot;open_browser_cmd_all&quot; functions and then use whatever method you want
to execute it.
