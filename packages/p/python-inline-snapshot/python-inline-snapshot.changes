Tue Sep 30 04:27:54 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.29.1:
  * Added
    + Added get_snapshot_value()
    + Added inline_snapshot.extra.Transformed and
      inline_snapshot.extra.transformation which can be used to transform
      values inside of snapshots.
    + exposed `@declare_unmanaged` which allows you to create your own
      unmanaged types.
    + New `external()` implementation with support for different data
      formats.
    + Ability to declare custom external formats with @register_format.
    + external() can now be used without snapshot().
    + Add/fix reproducible standard repr for functions
  * Changed
    + You now have to specify test-dir in your pyproject.toml when you save
      your tests in a folder other than `tests/` in your project root.
    + **BREAKING CHANGE**: You now have to declare format aliases if you used
      outsource() with a different suffix than .txt or .bin in the past.
    + Added extra information to the reported failure when snapshots are
      fixed or created.
  * Fixed
    + handle cases where pytest_unconfigure is called but not
      pytest_configure
    + pyproject.toml is now also located based on the current directory and
      the pytest-root.
    + Terminal with is preserved.
    + solved incompatibility with pytest_pretty.
    + external_file() now follows the aliases defined by
      register_format_alias().
    + fixed the representation of empty strings in sub-snapshots from
      triple-quotes to single-quotes.
    + fix: changed format-command default to "".
    + The readline module doesn't have to be installed on non-windows
      systems.
- Dropped patch no-readline.patch, included upstream.

Mon May 26 14:14:35 UTC 2025 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 0.23.1
  * pytest assert rewriting works now together with inline-snapshot
    if you use cpython>=3.11
  * ... is now a special value to create snapshot values. The value
    change in assert [5,4] == snapshot([5,...]) is now a create
    (previously it was a fix)
  * Tests with failed snapshot comparisons now always result in a
    pytest Error, even if snapshots have been fixed or created.
  * inline-snapshot uses now --inline-snapshot=disable during CI runs
    by default
  * The default flags have changed for cpython >= 3.11
  * The categories in the terminal output are now links to the documentation
    if it is supported by the terminal
  * You can now use the config option skip-snapshot-updates-for-now
    to skip the reporting of updates
  * snapshot updates are now disabled by default. They be enabled with
    show-updates=true in your config
- Add no-readline.patch to fix test error in pydantic-core

- Inject multibuild to break a build cycle. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 16 05:40:01 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.19.3:
  * Added
    + added the optional inline-snapshot[dirty-equals] dependency to depend
      on the dirty-equals version which works in combination with
      inline-snapshot.
    + You can now specify which tool you want to use to format your code by
      setting a format-command in your configuration.
    + Support for a new storage-dir configuration option, to tell
      inline-snapshot where to store data files such as external snapshots.
    + attrs can now contain unmanaged values
    + inline_snapshot.extra.warns to captures warnings and compares them
      against expected warnings.
    + snapshots inside snapshots are now supported.
    + runtime values can now be part of snapshots.
    + f-strings can now also be used within snapshots, but are currently not
      fixed by inline-snapshot.
  * Changed
    + BREAKING-CHANGE you have to install inline-snapshot[black] now if you
      want to format your code like in the previous versions. This option is
      not required if you use a format-command.
    + dirty-equals expressions are now treated like runtime values or
      snapshots within snapshots and are not modified by inline-snapshot.
  * Fixed
    + raise no assertion for positional arguments inside constructor methods.
    + fixed a crash when you changed the snapshot to use a custom constructoro
      method for dataclass/pydantic models.
    + snapshots with pydantic models can now be compared multiple times
    + Load default config values even if [tool.inline-snapshot] is missing.
    + use '.model_fields' on pydantic model class and not instance.
    + pydantic v1 is supported again.
    + Code generation for sets is now deterministic.
    + solved a bug caused by a variable inside a snapshot
    + inline-snapshot checks now if the given command line flags
      (--inline-snapshot=...) are valid
    + do not crash when handling raw f-strings (rf"",RF"",...)
    + Don't crash for snapshots like snapshot(f"")
    + skip formatting if black returns an error

Wed Nov 13 15:46:47 UTC 2024 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 0.14.0
  * Removed the "Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy"
    classifier which was incorrect, because inline-snapshot can not fix
    snapshots on pypy. inline-snapshot now enforces --inline-snapshot=disable
    when used with an implementation other than cpython, which allows
    it to be used in packages that want to support pypy.
  * Command line shortcuts can be defined to simplify your workflows.
    --review and --fix are defined by default. See the documentation
    for details.
  * --inline-snapshot=create/fix/trim/update will no longer show reports
    for other categories. You can use --inline-snapshot=create,report
    if you want to use the old behaviour.
- from version to 0.13.4
  * Use tomli instead of toml

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 29 08:12:20 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.13.3:
  * removed non-optional dirty-equals dependency
  * star-expressions in list or dicts where never valid and cause
    a warning now.
  * A snapshot which contains an dirty-equals expression can now
    be compared multiple times.
  * Use tomllib instead of PyPI toml on Python 3.11 and later
  * added extra.prints
  * 3.13 support
  * strings with one line-break at the end become no multiline
    strings
