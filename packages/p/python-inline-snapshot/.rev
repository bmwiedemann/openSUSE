    <comment>- Update to 0.19.3:
  * Added
    + added the optional inline-snapshot[dirty-equals] dependency to depend
      on the dirty-equals version which works in combination with
      inline-snapshot.
    + You can now specify which tool you want to use to format your code by
      setting a format-command in your configuration.
    + Support for a new storage-dir configuration option, to tell
      inline-snapshot where to store data files such as external snapshots.
    + attrs can now contain unmanaged values
    + inline_snapshot.extra.warns to captures warnings and compares them
      against expected warnings.
    + snapshots inside snapshots are now supported.
    + runtime values can now be part of snapshots.
    + f-strings can now also be used within snapshots, but are currently not
      fixed by inline-snapshot.
  * Changed
    + BREAKING-CHANGE you have to install inline-snapshot[black] now if you
      want to format your code like in the previous versions. This option is
      not required if you use a format-command.
    + dirty-equals expressions are now treated like runtime values or
      snapshots within snapshots and are not modified by inline-snapshot.
  * Fixed
    + raise no assertion for positional arguments inside constructor methods.
    + fixed a crash when you changed the snapshot to use a custom constructoro
      method for dataclass/pydantic models.
    + snapshots with pydantic models can now be compared multiple times
    + Load default config values even if [tool.inline-snapshot] is missing.
    + use '.model_fields' on pydantic model class and not instance.
    + pydantic v1 is supported again.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.23.1
  * pytest assert rewriting works now together with inline-snapshot
    if you use cpython&gt;=3.11
  * ... is now a special value to create snapshot values. The value
    change in assert [5,4] == snapshot([5,...]) is now a create
    (previously it was a fix)
  * Tests with failed snapshot comparisons now always result in a
    pytest Error, even if snapshots have been fixed or created.
  * inline-snapshot uses now --inline-snapshot=disable during CI runs
    by default
  * The default flags have changed for cpython &gt;= 3.11
  * The categories in the terminal output are now links to the documentation
    if it is supported by the terminal
  * You can now use the config option skip-snapshot-updates-for-now
    to skip the reporting of updates
  * snapshot updates are now disabled by default. They be enabled with
    show-updates=true in your config
- Add no-readline.patch to fix test error in pydantic-core</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.29.1:
  * Added
    + Added get_snapshot_value()
    + Added inline_snapshot.extra.Transformed and
      inline_snapshot.extra.transformation which can be used to transform
      values inside of snapshots.
    + exposed `@declare_unmanaged` which allows you to create your own
      unmanaged types.
    + New `external()` implementation with support for different data
      formats.
    + Ability to declare custom external formats with @register_format.
    + external() can now be used without snapshot().
    + Add/fix reproducible standard repr for functions
  * Changed
    + You now have to specify test-dir in your pyproject.toml when you save
      your tests in a folder other than `tests/` in your project root.
    + **BREAKING CHANGE**: You now have to declare format aliases if you used
      outsource() with a different suffix than .txt or .bin in the past.
    + Added extra information to the reported failure when snapshots are
      fixed or created.
  * Fixed
    + handle cases where pytest_unconfigure is called but not
      pytest_configure
    + pyproject.toml is now also located based on the current directory and
      the pytest-root.
    + Terminal with is preserved.
    + solved incompatibility with pytest_pretty.
    + external_file() now follows the aliases defined by
      register_format_alias().
    + fixed the representation of empty strings in sub-snapshots from</comment>
