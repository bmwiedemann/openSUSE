%description
Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. Most
or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they aren't
always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level of Perl
wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. Class::Inspector attempts to
provide an easier, more friendly interface to this information.
