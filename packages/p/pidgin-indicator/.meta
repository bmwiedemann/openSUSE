  <title>StatusNotifierItem plugin for Pidgin</title>
  <description>This plugin provides a StatusNotifierItem icon, for use in KDE Frameworks 5, Unity, Elementary and other environments.

It provides all the same functionality as the original tray icon but not in exactly the same way:
 * The 'smart' click behaviour that either shows the buddy list or unread messages is now activated by a middle-click â€“ because left click on an libappindicator always opens the menu.
 * As the SNI-icon is a separate process from pidgin itself, there are sometimes conflicts with Focus Stealing Prevention when you use the indicator to go to unread messages. You may need to disable FSP for Pidgin to get around this.
 * Due to how libappindicator work, the middle-click action must also be a menu item, so it's the new Show/Hide item at the top of the menu.
 * Due to libappindicator limitations, some of the special icons can't be shown next to menu items any more.</description>
