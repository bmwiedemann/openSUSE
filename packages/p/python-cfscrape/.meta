  <title>Python module to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot page</title>
  <description>A simple Python module to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot page (also known as &quot;I'm Under Attack Mode&quot;, or IUAM), implemented with Requests.

This can be useful if you wish to scrape or crawl a website protected with Cloudflare. Cloudflare's anti-bot page currently just checks if the client supports Javascript, though they may add additional techniques in the future.

Due to Cloudflare continually changing and hardening their protection page, cfscrape requires Node.js to solve Javascript challenges. This allows the script to easily impersonate a regular web browser without explicitly deobfuscating and parsing Cloudflare's Javascript.

Note: This only works when regular Cloudflare anti-bots is enabled (the &quot;Checking your browser before accessing...&quot; loading page). If there is a reCAPTCHA challenge, you're out of luck. Thankfully, the Javascript check page is much more common.</description>
