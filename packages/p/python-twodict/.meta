  <title>Simple two way ordered dictionary for Python</title>
  <description>TwoWayOrderedDict is a custom dictionary in which one can get the
key:value relationship but can also get the value:key relationship.
It also remembers the order in which the items were inserted and
supports almost all the features of the built-in dict.
