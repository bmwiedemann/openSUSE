  <title>A pure-python version of lalLIGOTimeGPS</title>
  <description>This module provides a pure-python version of the `LIGOTimeGPS` class,
used to represent GPS times (number of seconds elapsed since GPS
epoch) with nanoseconds precision.

This module is primarily for use as a drop-in replacement for the
'official' `lal.LIGOTimeGPS` class (provided by the SWIG-python
bindings of [LAL](//wiki.ligo.org/DASWG/LALSuite)) for use on those
environments where LAL is not available, or building LAL is
unnecessary for the application (e.g. testing).

The code provided here is much slower than the C-implementation
provided by LAL, so if you really care about performance, don't use
this module.
