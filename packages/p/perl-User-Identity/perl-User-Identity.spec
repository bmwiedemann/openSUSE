%description
The 'User-Identity' distribution is created to maintain a set of
informational objects which are related to one user. The 'User::Identity'
module tries to be smart providing defaults, conversions and often required
combinations.

The identities are not implementing any kind of storage, and can therefore
be created by any simple or complex Perl program. This way, it is more
flexible than an XML file to store the data. For instance, you can decide
to store the data with Data::Dumper, Storable, DBI, AddressBook or
whatever. Extension to simplify this task are still to be developed.

If you need more kinds of user information, then please contact the module
author.
