%description
Pympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the
memory behavior of Python objects in a running Python application.

By pympling a Python application, detailed insight in the size and
the lifetime of Python objects can be obtained.  Undesirable or
unexpected runtime behavior like memory bloat and other "pymples"
can easily be identified.
