    <comment>- Fix build with uring for post SLE15 code streams.

- Use %product_libs_llvm_ver to determine the LLVM version.
- Remove conditionals for obsolete PostgreSQL releases.

- Update to 18.1:
  * https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/p-3171/
  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/18.1/
  * bsc#1253332, CVE-2025-12817: Missing check for CREATE
    privileges on the schema in CREATE STATISTICS allowed table
    owners to create statistics in any schema, potentially leading
    to unexpected naming conflicts.
  * bsc#1253333, CVE-2025-12818: Several places in libpq were not
    sufficiently careful about computing the required size of a
    memory allocation. Sufficiently large inputs could cause
    integer overflow, resulting in an undersized buffer, which
    would then lead to writing past the end of the buffer.</comment>
