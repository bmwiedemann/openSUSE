    These features are intended for use inside Espressif:
    - Support for ESP32-S3-beta3 & ESP32-C6-beta have been added. These SoCs are not generally available,
      so they are unsupported in this release. Official support will be added in a later esptool release.

- version 3.0
  * Breaking changes
    + The default esptool.py write_flash --flash_size argument has changed from detect to keep.
      This means that if no --flash_size argument is passed when flashing a bootloader, the value
      in the bootloader .bin file header is kept instead of detecting the actual flash size and
      updating the header. To keep the old behaviour, add the argument esptool.py [...] write_flash [...] -fs detect
    + espefuse.py command line arguments for ESP32 have changed:
      - BLK1, BLK2, BLK3 is now BLOCK1, BLOCK2, BLOCK3`
      - The key usage secure_boot has been replaced with secure_boot_v1, secure_boot_v2.
        Secure Boot V2 is the new RSA-based Secure Boot mechanism supported on ESP32 V3.
  * New Features
    + Support for ESP32-S2 SoC has been added
    + Support for detecting ESP32-PICO-V3-02 and ESP32-U4WDH have been added
    + New --connect-attempts argument (#464)
    + Fixed scrolling problems when output is redirected (for example in Arduino IDE, see discussion at #482)
    + Produce a meaningful error if the SoC we connect to doesn't match the --chip argument
    + Support different capitalization and spelling for --chip argument (ie -c ESP32, -c esp32-s2, etc.
    + Added dedicated program esp_rfc_2217_server.py for flashing via RFC2217 (i.e. flashing over the network, #383)
  * espsecure.py
    + Added support for Secure Boot V2 (ESP32 V3, ESP32-S2)
    + Secure Boot V1: PKCS8 formatted ECDSA keys are now supported via ecdsa library (not including password protected keys)
  * espefuse.py
    + Added ESP32 ECO3 efuse UART_DOWNLOAD_DIS
    + Added new batch burn mode, support burning more than one eFuse on a single command line
    + espefuse.py internals have been refactored to support multiple chips, produce more information about
      which eFuses are being written to which values.
    + "Virtual" mode added for host-based testing, allows updating eFuse values on a "virtual" chip inside the host.
  * Internal features
    + These features are intended for use inside Espressif:
      Support for ESP32-S3beta2 & ESP32-C3 have been added. These SoCs are not currently available
      outside Espressif, so these SoCs are unsupported in this release. Official support will be
      added in a later esptool release.
      esptool.py --no-stub read_flash is now supported on ESP32 and later. This option
      is slower than using the default stub option to read flash, so it's generally not useful for production SoCs.
  * Bug Fixes
    + Added temporary workaround for a pyserial failure on macOS Big Sur Preview (#540)
    + Fixed gcc9 warning in the stub (#501)
    + Fixed some memory types printed in the memory map output
    + Fixed the check for zero bytes before applying an ELF SHA-256 with elf2image --elf-sha256-offset option (#560)
    + Fixed displaying some single core ESP32 features incorrectly, i.e. ESP32-S0WD
    + Fixed exception on Python 3 if the same flash address was repeated twice (#558)
  * Miscellanous Changes
    + Updated miniz to v2.1.0 (#500)
    + Moved ESP32 stub loader location to facilitate loading large applications direct to IRAM
    + Vendored modules ecdsa, pyaes and optional pycrypto have been removed. Pyaes has been replaced
      with the pyca-cryptography library

      main(...) can take an optional argument with a command line formatted
      as a list.)
    + (ESP32) Support for reading/writing efuses when 3/4 Coding Scheme is set
      details
    + (ESP32) espefuse.py supports displaying and setting a custom MAC address
      in BLK3 of efuse
    + (ESP32) espsecure.py can now verify signatures with raw binary key file
      as well as PEM formatted key file
  * Bug Fixes/Changes
    + Fix crash due to unimplemented write timeout on RFC2217 ports
    + elf2image no longer adds empty ELF sections (zero length) to the .bin file
    + elf2image fails with a proper error if an ELF file contains more than
      16 loadable sections
    + Improve error message if list_ports is missing from pyserial
    + Fix some write_flash timeouts writing large but highly compressible payloads
    + (ESP8266) Fix bug where flashing with stub would fail if ESP8266 was in
      deep sleep immediately beforehand.
    + (ESP32) Workaround a mapping bug in the ESP-IDF bootloader
      (if IROM/DROM segment ended less than 0x20 bytes after a page boundary,
      older ESP-IDF bootloaders would not map the final page correctly).
    + (ESP32) Reformat espefuse.py summary output (includes: read-only efuses
      now display value ? not 0, byte order of keys shown for BLK1,BLK2 are now
      shown in software order not the reversed byte order used by hardware
      cryptographical modules.)
    + (ESP32) espsecure.py: Fix Python 3 compatibility issues
- from v2.5.1
  * Errors during chip detection are now formatted correctly.
  * OSError is handled correctly while scanning for a port
  * Update link to flashrom repo for SPI flash chip IDs
  * read_flash command: Error out immediately if an invalid length
    packet is received (common symptom of bad serial link)
  * (ESP32) espefuse.py: Disable burning key efuses when 3/4 Coding Scheme
    is set (support for burning keys with 3/4 Coding Scheme will be addedr
    in a future update).
- from v2.5.0
  * Set a write timeout in pyserial (prevents hanging in sync process if
    port is unavailable).
  * (ESP32) New option elf2image --secure-pad to pad the output binary
    so once signed it will align to an flash cache page boundary (64KB).
    Prevents unsigned data from being mapped into the instruction space
    via the flash cache.
  * Fix exception if no --port is specified but no serial ports are found
    in the system.
  * (ESP32) espsecure: Fix bug where digest_secure_bootloader could produce
    an incorrect digest.
- from v2.4.1
  * --port argument was not correctly handled in v2.4.0
  * Corrected pyserial dependency to require pyserial v3.0 or newer
- from v2.4.0
  * ESP8266 & ESP32 changes
    + If no serial port is specified, try all serial ports until an Espressif
      device responds.
    + Print device MAC on every command, after connecting.
    + New option --before no_reset_no_sync for use when immediately reusing the
      serial port with an already-running loader.
    + Fix spurious load_ram error when executed code immediately resets the UART
      baud rate..
    + Produce an error if load_ram is going to clobber bootloader stub memory
      (can use --no-stub to work around this).
    + Display a helpful error if the incompatible 'serial' module was installed
      instead of 'pyserial'.
    + Explicitly close the serial port at end of main() function (allows calling
      esptool.main() from another Python program for basic scripting.)
    + Workaround Windows usbser.sys (USB CDC-ACM device) driver bug setting DTR & RTS
    + Flasher stub build updates to work with recent ESP-IDF & ESP8266 SDK headers
    + Flasher stub now sends correct length field in protocol responses
      (esptool.py was ignoring this field, but some other tools were not).
  * ESP8266 changes
    + Move the loader stub to the very end of IRAM (useful when using load_ram command).
    + elf2image --version=2 is now compatible with recent ESP8266 SDK bootloader
      and produces the same binary output as ESP8266 SDK gen_app.py.
    + Remove unsupported flash size 4MB-c2
  * ESP32 changes
    + Print chip frequency rating values in Features list, for chips where
      these are set.
    + Working load_ram command.
    + espefuse.py: Support setting the baud rate.
    + New --override-vddsdio option allows setting the VDDSDIO regulator to 1.8V,
      1.9V or "OFF" when connecting (to override the default value read from efuse).
    + To avoid hardware damage, forcing VDDSDIO to 3.3V is not supported.
