  <title>Linux Distribution - a Linux OS platform information API</title>
  <description>distro (for: Linux Distribution) provides information about the Linux distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or version information.

It is a renewed alternative implementation for Python's original platform.linux_distribution function, but it also provides much more functionality which isn't necessarily Python bound like a command-line interface.
