%description
Traceback serialization library.

It allows you to:

* Pickle  tracebacks and raise exceptions with pickled tracebacks in
  different processes. This allows better error handling when running
  code over multiple processes (imagine multiprocessing, billiard,
  futures, celery etc).
* Create traceback objects from strings (the ``from_string`` method).
  *No pickling is used*.
* Serialize tracebacks to/from plain dicts (the ``from_dict`` and
  ``to_dict`` methods). *No pickling is used*.
* Raise the tracebacks created from the aforementioned sources.

Again, note that using the pickle support is completely optional. You
are solely responsible for security problems should you decide to use
the pickle support.
