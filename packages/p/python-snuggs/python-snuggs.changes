- Update to 1.4.7
  The snuggs tests of syntax errors no longer assert a specific pyparsing
  exception message as the format of these messages is not stable (#15).
  Previous versions of snuggs had no other issues with pyparsing 2.3 or 2.4. 
  + 1.4.6 (2019-05-15)
    * Tests were failing on Python 2.7 (#20, #21) due to loss of precision in
    str(num). This has been fixed by using repr(num).
  + 1.4.5 (2019-05-14)
    + Replace custom integer and real parsers with pyparsing_common's number (#19).
  + 1.4.4 (2019-05-14)
    + Fix for a reported bug in parsing negative real numbers (#16) and for an
    unreported bug in parsing numbers in exponential notation (thank you,
    hypothesis!).
    + Add a "test" dependency on hypothesis.
- Packaging
  + Add hypothesis buildrequire
  + spec-cleaner minimal
  + Fix build errors on TW
