Wed Nov 20 14:58:13 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.17.1:
  * Update tests to work with newly released pyproject-metadata
    0.9.0.
  * Fix tests to work when not executed in a git work tree.
  * Refuse to build wheels targeting the limited API and free-
    threaded CPython: the free-threaded CPython build does not
    support the limited API yet.
  * Always use UTF-8 encoding for writing Meson native and cross
    files. Always use UTF-8 encoding for reading read Meson
    introspection data and pyproject.toml.
  * Do not include uncommitted changes when creating source
    distributions. Previously, uncommitted changes to files under
    version control were included, but not untracked files. There
    was no strong use case for this behavior and it was too
    surprising to keep it.
  * Make source distribution reproducible: use the modification
    time of pyproject.toml for the generated files in the source
    distribution archives.
  * Disable the abi3 wheel tag for PyPy when building wheels
    targeting the limited API: PyPy supports the limited API but
    not the stable ABI.
  * Raise ImportError when the package rebuild fails when
    importing an editable install.
  * Fix the wheel platform tag for GraalPy.
  * Add .gitignore and .hgignore files to build directory if it
    is empty.
  * Allow install_subdir() of missing directories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 29 11:22:59 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Add mesonpy-reproducible.patch gh#openSUSE/python-rpm-macros#182
  initiated by Bernhard Wiedemann @bmwiedemann

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 22 04:20:32 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 0.16.0:
  * Correctly detect a wheel shipping shared libraries as being
    platform dependent also when it does not ship compiled
    executables or Python extension modules.
  * Improve parsing of the $ARCHFLAGS environment variable.
    Correctly handle repeated -arch flags.
  * Do not break when trying to log filename containing Unicode
    characters that cannot be encoded in the encoding used by the
    standard output stream.
  * Suppress all uses of ANSI terminal escapes when logging to a
    stream that does not support them.
  * Fix ANSI escape coloring of error messages.
  * Respect the exclude_dirs and exclude_files arguments passed to
    the install_subdir() Meson function in editable installs too.
  * Make pkgutil.iter_packages() work properly for modules loaded
    from editable installs.
  * Add support for the custom_target() Meson function installing a
    directory.
  * In editable installs, when a rebuild is triggered on module
    import, emit a message indicating that the package is being
    rebuilt but suppress any output when there is no work to do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 16 19:27:36 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.15.0
  * Enable compression for wheel files. The may result in several
    times smaller wheels.
  * Require Meson 1.2.3 or later on Python 3.12 or later. Meson
    1.2.3 does not require anymore ``distutils``, allowing to
    remove the dependency on ``setuptools`` on Python 3.12 or
    later.
  * Unconditionally require ``patchelf`` on Linux.  The
    ``patchelf`` package is added to the build dependencies if a
    suitable ``patchelf`` executable is not find on the ``$PATH``.
    This avoids cases where ``meson setup`` was run twice during
    the build process to determine whether ``patchelf`` is
    required.
  * Allow to configure the ``meson`` executable to use for the
    build process through the ``$MESON`` environment variable or
    the ``meson`` key under ``[tool.meson-python]`` in
    ``pyproject.toml``.
  * Fix wheel platform tag generation on FreeBSD.
  * Extend support to other UNIX-like systems and make the tests
    pass on FreeBSD.
  * Fix package name normalization in package metadata and improve
    package name validation.
  * Fix ``RPATH`` handling when the build ``RPATH`` points to
    subdirectories of the build directory.
  * Fix support for the Python limited C API when compiling for
    PyPy.
  * Rename the ``builddir`` config-setting to ``build-dir``. For
    backwards compatibility, the ``buildir`` config-setting remains
    supported as an alias.
- Drop no longer needed test patches and test wheels
  * no-build-isolation-in-test.patch
  * mesonpy-no-wheel-rebuild.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 21 06:01:08 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.14.0:
  * Do not run ``meson install`` to build a wheel.
  * Obey the ``--skip-subprojects`` when specified for the ``meson
    install`` command.
  * Implement support for the ``exclude_directories`` and
    ``exclude_files`` arguments to Meson ``install_subdir()`` function
    and similar installation functions. This requires Meson version
    1.1.0 or later.
  * Implement support for building wheels targeting the Python limited API.
  * When ``pyproject.toml`` does not contain a ``version`` field and
    ``version`` is not declared dynamic, raise an error instead of
    silently using the version declared in ``meson.build``.
  * Fix the mtime of source files in the sdist tarball.
  * Add ``objc`` and ``objcpp`` compilers to the cross file generated
    when the ``$ARCHFLAGS`` is set.
- Add patch no-build-isolation-in-test.patch, don't use an isolated
  environment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 17 12:57:55 UTC 2023 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 0.13.2
  * Add support for editable installs.
  * Adjust the default build options passed to meson setup.
  * Make sure that the directory where the wheel or sdist build artifacts are
    created exists. Fixes building with PDM.
  * Fix the specification of the C++ compiler for cross-compilation with
    $ARCHFLAGS on macOS.
  * Pass the --reconfigure option to meson setup if and only if the specified
    build directory exists and is a valid Meson build directory.
  * Pass the --no-rebuild option to meson install.
  * Allow to select the files to be included in the wheel via Meson install
    tags passing the --tags option to meson install via pyproject.toml or
    config settings.
  * Do not use the meson compile indirection to build the project, except on
    Windows, where it is required to setup the Visual Studio environment.
  * Do not add ninja to the build dependencies if $NINJA is set but it does not
    point to a ninja executable with the required minimum version.
  * Verify at run time that Meson satisfies the minimum required version.
  * Place native and cross files in the build directory instead of in the source directory.
  * Drop the typing-extensions package dependency.
  * Add dependency on setuptools on Python 3.12 and later. This fixes build
    error due to Meson depending on the distutils standard library module
    removed in Python 3.12.
  * Bump the required pyproject-metadata version to 0.7.1.
  * Allows some more cross-compilation setups by not checking extension modules
    filename suffixes against the suffixes accepted by the current interpreter.
  * Raise an error when a file that would be installed by Meson cannot be
    mapped to a wheel location.
  * Raise an error when a package is split between platlib and purelib.
  * Do not generate a warning when pyproject.toml does not contain a project
    section and Python package metadata is derived from meson.build.
  * Improve reporting of pyproject.toml validation errors.
  * Fix validation of tool specific options in pyproject.toml. In particular,
    allows to specify an incomplete set of options in the
    tool.meson-python.args table.
  * Add the --quiet option when invoking meson install. The installation paths
    are a detail of the meson-python implementation and are generally not
    interesting for the user.

  * Allow users to pass options directly to Meson via the
    tools.meson-python.args.{dist,setup,compile,install}
    pyproject.toml keys, and the {dist,setup,compile,install}-args
    frontend config options
