  <title>Log formatting with colors!</title>
  <description>colorlog.ColoredFormatter is a formatter for use with pythons logging module.

It allows colors to be placed in the format string, which is mostly useful when paired with a StreamHandler that is outputting to a terminal. This is accomplished by added a set of terminal color codes to the record before it is used to format the string.
