%description
colorlog.ColoredFormatter is a formatter for use with Python's logging module.
It allows colors to be placed in the format string, which is mostly useful
when paired with a StreamHandler that is outputting to a terminal.
This is accomplished by added a set of terminal color codes to the record
before it is used to format the string.
