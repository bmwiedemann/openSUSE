%description
'File::Temp' can be used to create and open temporary files in a safe way.
There is both a function interface and an object-oriented interface. The
File::Temp constructor or the tempfile() function can be used to return the
name and the open filehandle of a temporary file. The tempdir() function
can be used to create a temporary directory.

The security aspect of temporary file creation is emphasized such that a
filehandle and filename are returned together. This helps guarantee that a
race condition can not occur where the temporary file is created by another
process between checking for the existence of the file and its opening.
Additional security levels are provided to check, for example, that the
sticky bit is set on world writable directories. See "safe_level" for more
information.

For compatibility with popular C library functions, Perl implementations of
the mkstemp() family of functions are provided. These are, mkstemp(),
mkstemps(), mkdtemp() and mktemp().

Additionally, implementations of the standard POSIX tmpnam() and tmpfile()
functions are provided if required.

Implementations of mktemp(), tmpnam(), and tempnam() are provided, but
should be used with caution since they return only a filename that was
valid when function was called, so cannot guarantee that the file will not
exist by the time the caller opens the filename.

Filehandles returned by these functions support the seekable methods.
