  <title>MPRIS command-line controller and library for media players</title>
  <description>Playerctl is a command-line utility and library for controlling
media players that implement the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification.
Playerctl makes it easy to bind player actions, such as play and pause,
to media keys.

For more advanced users, Playerctl provides an introspectable library
available in your favorite scripting language that allows more detailed
control like the ability to subscribe to media player events or get metadata,
such as artist and title for the playing track.
