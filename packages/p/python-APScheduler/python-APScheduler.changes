  * Pinned ``tzlocal`` to a version compatible with pytz
  * Ensured that jitter is always non-negative to prevent triggers from firing
    more often than intended

    to prevent situations where the scheduler won't run because it's using a
    different event loop than then one currently running

  * Fixed inability to schedule wrapped functions with extra arguments when the wrapped function
    cannot accept them but the wrapper can (original PR by Egor Malykh)
  * Fixed potential ``where`` clause error in the SQLAlchemy job store when a subclass uses more than
    one search condition
  * Fixed a problem where bound methods added as jobs via textual references were called with an
    unwanted extra ``self`` argument (PR by Pengjie Song)
  * Fixed ``BrokenPoolError`` in ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` so that it will automatically replace the
    broken pool with a fresh instance

  + Fixed ValueError when the target callable has a default keyword
    argument that wasn’t overridden
  + Fixed wrong job sort order in some job stores
  + Fixed exception when loading all jobs from the redis job store when
    there are paused jobs in it
  + Fixed AttributeError when printing a job list when there were pending jobs
  + Added setuptools as an explicit requirement in install requirements
  + A wider variety of target callables can now be scheduled so that the
    jobs are still serializable (static methods on Python 3.3+, unbound
    methods on all except Python 3.2)
  + Attempting to serialize a non-serializable Job now raises a helpful
    exception during serialization. Thanks to Jeremy Morgan for pointing
    this out.
  + Fixed table creation with SQLAlchemyJobStore on MySQL/InnoDB
  + Fixed start date getting set too far in the future with a timezone
    different from the local one
  + Fixed _run_job_error() being called with the incorrect number of
    arguments in most executors
  + Added support for timezones (special thanks to Curtis Vogt for help
    with this one)

    BackgroundScheduler and added integration for asyncio (PEP 3156), Gevent,
    Tornado, Twisted and Qt event loops
  + Overhauled the job store system for much better scalability
  + Added the ability to modify, reschedule, pause and resume jobs
  + Dropped the Shelve job store because it could not work with the new
    job store system
  + Dropped the max_runs option and run counting of jobs since it could
    not be implemented reliably
  + Adding jobs is now done exclusively through add_job() – the shortcuts
    to triggers were removed
  + Added the end_date parameter to cron and interval triggers
  + It is now possible to add a job directly to an executor without
    scheduling, by omitting the trigger argument
  + Replaced the thread pool with a pluggable executor system
  + Added support for running jobs in subprocesses (via the processpool
    executor)
  + Switched from nose to py.test for running unit tests

2.0.2
-----

* Removed the unique constraint from the "name" column in the SQLAlchemy
  job store

* Fixed output from Scheduler.print_jobs() which did not previously output
  a line ending at the end


2.0.1
-----

* Fixed cron style jobs getting wrong default values


2.0.0
-----

* Added configurable job stores with several persistent back-ends
  (shelve, SQLAlchemy and MongoDB)

* Added the possibility to listen for job events (execution, error, misfire,
  finish) on a scheduler

* Added an optional start time for cron-style jobs

* Added optional job execution coalescing for situations where several
  executions of the job are due

* Added an option to limit the maximum number of concurrenctly executing
  instances of the job

* Allowed configuration of misfire grace times on a per-job basis

* Allowed jobs to be explicitly named

* All triggers now accept dates in string form (YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS)

* Jobs are now run in a thread pool; you can either supply your own PEP 3148
  compliant thread pool or let APScheduler create its own

* Maximum run count can be configured for all jobs, not just those using
  interval-based scheduling

* Fixed a v1.x design flaw that caused jobs to be executed twice when the
  scheduler thread was woken up while still within the allowable range of their
  previous execution time (issues #5, #7)

* Changed defaults for cron-style jobs to be more intuitive -- it will now
  default to all minimum values for fields lower than the least significant
  explicitly defined field


1.3.1
-----

* Fixed time difference calculation to take into account shifts to and from
  daylight saving time


1.3.0
-----

* Added __repr__() implementations to expressions, fields, triggers, and jobs
  to help with debugging

* Added the dump_jobs method on Scheduler, which gives a helpful listing of
  all jobs scheduled on it

* Fixed positional weekday (3th fri etc.) expressions not working except in
  some edge cases (fixes #2)

* Removed autogenerated API documentation for modules which are not part of
  the public API, as it might confuse some users

.. Note:: Positional weekdays are now used with the **day** field, not
   **weekday**.


1.2.1
-----

* Fixed regression: add_cron_job() in Scheduler was creating a CronTrigger with
  the wrong parameters (fixes #1, #3)

* Fixed: if the scheduler is restarted, clear the "stopped" flag to allow
  jobs to be scheduled again


1.2.0
-----

* Added the ``week`` option for cron schedules

* Added the ``daemonic`` configuration option

* Fixed a bug in cron expression lists that could cause valid firing times
  to be missed

* Fixed unscheduling bound methods via unschedule_func()

* Changed CronTrigger constructor argument names to match those in Scheduler


1.01
----

* Fixed a corner case where the combination of hour and day_of_week parameters
  would cause incorrect timing for a cron trigger
