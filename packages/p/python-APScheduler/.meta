  <title>In-process task scheduler with Cron-like capabilities</title>
  <description>Advanced Python Scheduler (APScheduler) is a light but powerful in-process task scheduler that lets you schedule jobs (functions or any python callables) to be executed at times of your choosing.

This can be a far better alternative to externally run cron scripts for long-running applications (e.g. web applications), as it is platform neutral and can directly access your application's variables and functions.</description>
