- update to version 4.3.1
  * Fix the decimal.Decimal checker, __truediv__ was missing 
    causing ForbiddenAttribute on a ProxyFactory(Decimal('1')) / 1 
    operation
  4.3.0
  * Add the interface ISystemPrincipal and make 
    zope.security.management.system_user a regular object that 
    implements this interface.
  4.2*
  * Add support for Python 3.7.
  * Make the pure-Python proxy on Python 2 not check permissions for
    __unicode__ just like the C implementation. Note that __str__ is 
    checked for both implementations on both Python 2 and 3, but if 
    there is no __unicode__ method defined, Python 2’s automatic 
    fallback to __str__ is not checked when unicode is called.
  * Fix the default values for Permission fields title and 
    description under Python 2.
  * Change the IPermission.id from Text (unicode) to a 
    NativeStringLine.
  * Fix the extremely rare potential for a crash when the C 
    extensions are in use.
  * The pure-Python proxy didn’t propagate TypeError from __repr__ 
    and __str__ like the C implementation did.
  * Iteration of zope.interface.providedBy() is now allowed by 
    default on all versions of Python.
  * Drop support for Python 3.3.
  * Respect PURE_PYTHON at runtime. 
  * Fix watching checkers (ZOPE_WATCH_CHECKERS=1) in pure-Python 
    mode.
- Fix tests using multibuild (can be dropped in the future).

- Update to version 4.1.1
  * Fix issue 23: iteration of collections.OrderedDict and its
    various views is now allowed by default on all versions of
    Python.
  * As a further fix for issue 20, iteration of BTree itself is
    now allowed by default.
  4.1.0:
  * When testing PURE_PYTHON environments under tox, avoid
    poisoning the user’s global wheel cache.
  * Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.
  * Add support for Python 3.5 and 3.6.
  * Fix issue 20: iteration of pure-Python BTrees.items(), and
    also creating a list from BTrees.items() on Python 3. The same
    applies for keys() and values().
  4.0.3:
  * Fix iteration over security proxies in Python 3 using the
    pure-Python implementation.
  4.0.2:
  * Fix compatibility with zope.proxy 4.1.5 under PyPy.
  * Fix the very first call to removeSecurityProxy returning
    incorrect results if given a proxy under PyPy.
  4.0.1:
  * Add support for Python 3.4.

- Split docs and tests into separate -doc package to avoid
  dependency loop and other zope-related problems, see 
  (gh#/zopefoundation/zope.proxy#18)

- Converted to single-spec
