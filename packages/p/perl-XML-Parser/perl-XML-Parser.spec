%description
This module provides ways to parse XML documents. It is built on top of
XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's expat
library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance of
XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be
given as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override
options given at XML::Parser creation time.

The behavior of the parser is controlled either by 'STYLES' and/or
'HANDLERS' options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms
for XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If
neither 'Style' nor 'Handlers' are specified, then parsing just checks the
document for being well-formed.

When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
the _Expat_ object, not the Parser object.
