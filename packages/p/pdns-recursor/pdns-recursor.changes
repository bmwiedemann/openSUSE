Mon Dec 12 13:20:47 UTC 2022 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 4.8.0 with these major changes:
  * Structured Logging has been implemented for almost all
    subsystems.
  * Optional Serve Stale functionality has been implemented,
    providing resilience against connectivity problems towards
    authoritative servers.
  * Optional Record Locking has been implemented, providing an extra
    layer of protection against spoofing attempts at the price of
    reduced cache efficiency.
  * Internal tables used to track information about authoritative
    servers are now shared instead of per-thread, resulting in
    better performance and lower memory usage.
  * EDNS padding of outgoing DoT queries has been implemented,
    providing better privacy protection.
  * Metrics have been added about the protobuf and dnstap logging
    subsystems and the rcodes received from authoritative
    servers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 30 17:15:50 UTC 2022 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 4.7.0
   * A configurable way of adding Additional records to answers sent
     to the client, so the client does not have to ask for these
     records.
   * The step sizes for Query Minimization are now computed following to
     guidelines in [2]RFC 9156.
   * The Recursor now schedules tasks to resolve IPv6 addresses of name
     servers not learned by glue records. This has the consequence that,
     if applicable, name servers will be contacted over IPv6 more often.
   * An experimental implementation of unilateral [3]DoT probing. This
     allows the Recursor to learn if a an authoritative servers supports
     DoT.
   * Recursor has gained a way to fall back to the parent NS set if
     contacting servers in the child NS set does not lead to an answer.
     This works around some broken authoritative servers configurations.
   * ZONEMD validation of the zones retrieved by the [5]Zone to Cache,
     providing integrity guarantees for the zone retrieved.
   * The table recording round trip times of authoritative server IP
     addresses is now shared between threads to make it more effective
     and to reduce its memory footprint.
   * A Lua FFI hook for post-resolve interception: [6]postresolve_ffi,
     providing a very fast way to do post-resolve Lua scripting.

  fixes incomplete validation of incoming IXFR transfer in
  the Recursor. It applies to setups retrieving one or more RPZ
  zones from a remote server if the network path to the server
  is not trusted. (bsc#1197525, CVE-2022-27227)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 17 16:08:44 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 4.6.0
  Compared to the previous major (4.5) release of PowerDNS Recursor, this
  release contains several sets of changes:
    * The ability to flush records from the caches on a incoming
      notify requests.
    * A rewrite of the outgoing TCP code, adding both re-use of
      connections and support for DoT to authoritative servers or
      forwarders.
    * Many improvements in the area of metrics: more metrics are
      collected and more metrics are now exported in a Prometheus
      friendly way.
    * A new Zone to Cache function that will retrieve a zone (using
      AXFR, HTTP, HTTPS or a local file) periodically and insert the
      contents into the record cache, allowing the cache to be always hot
      for a zone. This can be used for the root or any other zone.
    * An experimental Event Tracing function, providing insight into
      the time taken by the steps in the process of resolving a name.

  * default value of nsec3-max-iterations[1] has been lowered to 150
  * fixed issue affecting the "refresh almost expired" function

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 11 16:10:50 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 4.5.1:
- Main changes:
  * Dropped support for 32-bit platforms!
  * Rewrite of the way zone cuts are determined, reducing the number of
    outgoing queries by up to 17% when doing DNSSEC validation while reducing
    the CPU usage more than 20% .
  * Added implementation of EDNS0 padding (RFC 7830) for answers sent to clients.
  * Added implementation of RFC 8198[2]: Aggressive use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache.
  * Added a cache of non-resolving nameservers.
  * Re-worked negative cache that is shared between threads.
  * Added support for Extended DNS Errors (RFC 8914[5]).
  * A "refresh almost expired records" (also called "refetch") mechanism[8]
    has been introduced to keep the record cache warm.
- Other new features and improvements:
  * The complete protobuf and dnstap logging code has been rewritten to
    have much smaller performance impact.
  * We have introduced non-offensive synonyms for words used in
    settings. See the upgrade[9] guide.
  * The default minimum TTL[10] override has been changed from 0 to 1.
  * The spoof-nearmiss-max setting[11]'s default has been changed to 1.
    This has the consequence that the Recursor will switch to do TCP
    queries to authoritative nameservers sooner as an effective measure
    against many spoofing attacks.
  * Incoming queries over TCP now also use the packet cache, providing
    another performance increase.
  * File written to by the rec_control command are new opened by the
    command itself. It is also possible to write the content to the
    standard output stream by using a hyphen as file name.
  * TCP FastOpen (RFC 7413[12]) support for outgoing TCP connections to
    authoritative servers and forwarders.

    processing.
  * More detailed information about RPZ handling is now available while
    tracing, in Lua and in the protobuf logging messages.
  * To allow more efficient use, the record cache is now shared between
    threads.
  * A routing tag[3] can be added in Lua code, which will be used as an
    additional record cache key instead of an EDNS subnet mask,
    enabling for a simpler record cache structure which will enhance
    query processing where the EDNS subnet mask is relevant.
  * The Proxy Protocol version 2 has been implemented to allow for a
    structured exchange of information between a client (typically
    dnsdist) and the Recursor.

    query load. Fixed in 76f190f2a0877cd79ede2994124c1a58dc69ae49
    and beyond.
  - rec_control gave incorrect output on a timeout
    12997e9d800734da51b808767e1e2477244c30eb

  - The 'remotes' ringbuffer was sized incorrectly
    f8f243b01215d6adcb59389f09ef494f1309041f
  - Cache sizes had an off-by-one scaling problem, with the wrong
    number of entries allocated per thread
    f8f243b01215d6adcb59389f09ef494f1309041f
  - Our automatic file descriptor limit raising was attempted
    *after* setuid, which made it a lot less effective. Found and
    fixed by Aki Tuomi a6414fdce9b0ec32c340d1f2eea2254f3fedc1c1
  - Timestamps used for dropping packets were occasionaly wrong
    183eb8774e4bc2569f06d5894fec65740f4b70b6 and
    4c4765c104bacc146533217bcc843efb244a8086 (RC2) with thanks to
    Winfried for debugging.
  - In RC1, our new DoS protection measures would crash the
    Recursor if too many root servers were unreachable.

- update to upstream release 3.6.2 (boo# 906583) CVE-2014-8601

This is a bugfix update to 3.6.1.

 A list of changes since 3.6.1 follows.

     * gab14b4f: expedite servfail generation for ezdns-like
       failures (fully abort query resolving if we hit more than
       50 outqueries)

     * g42025be: PowerDNS now polls the security status of a
       release at startup and periodically. More detail on this
       feature, and how to turn it off, can be found in Section 2,
       "Security polling".

     * g5027429: We did not transmit the right 'local' socket
       address to Lua for TCP/IP queries in the recursor. In
       addition, we would attempt to lookup a filedescriptor that
       wasn't there in an unlocked map which could conceivably
       lead to crashes. Closes t1828, thanks Winfried for

- update to version 3.2
  The 3.2 release is the first major release of the PowerDNS
  Recursor in a long time. Partly this is because 3.1.7.*
  functioned very well, and delivered satisfying performance,
  partly this is because in order to really move forward, some
  heavy lifting had to be done.
  This version of the PowerDNS Recursor contains a rather novel
  form of lock-free multithreading, a situation that comes close to
  the old '--fork' trick, but allows the Recursor to fully utilize
  multiple CPUs, while delivering unified statistics and
  operational control.
  In effect, this delivers the best of both worlds: near linear
  scaling, with almost no administrative overhead.

  CVE-2009-4009

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 11 17:34:48 CET 2009 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 3.1.7.1
  This release consists entirely of fixes for tiny bugs that have
  been reported over the past year. In addition, compatibility has
  been restored with the latest versions of the gcc compiler and
  the 'boost' libraries.
  No features have been added, but some debugging code that very
  slightly impacted performance (and polluted the console when
  operating in the foreground) has been removed. 
  - Improved error messages when parsing zones for authoritative
    serving (commit 1235).
  - Better resilience against whitespace in configuration
    (changesets 1237, 1240, 1242)
  - Slight performance increase (commit 1378)
  - Fix rare case where timeouts were not being reported to the
    right query-thread (commit 1260)
  - Fix compilation against newer versions of the Boost C++
    libraries (commit 1381)
  - Close very rare issue with TCP/IP close reporting ECONNRESET on
    FreeBSD. Reported by Andrei Poelov in ticket 192.
  - Silence debugging output (commit 1286).
  - Fix compilation against newer versions of gcc (commit 1384)
  - No longer set export-etc-hosts to 'on' on reload-zones.
    Discovered by Paul Cairney, closes ticket 225.
  - Sane default for the maximum cache size in the Recursor,
    suggested by Roel van der Made (commit 1354).
  - No longer exit because of the changed behaviour of the Solaris
    'completion ports' in more recent versions of Solaris. Fix in
    commit 1372, reported by Jan Gyselinck
- update to version 3.1.7
  This version contains powerful scripting abilities, allowing
  operators to modify DNS responses in many interesting ways. Among
  other things, these abilities can be used to filter out malware
  domains, to perform load balancing, to comply with legal and
  other requirements and finally, to implement 'NXDOMAIN'
  redirection.
  It is hoped that the addition of Lua scripting will enable
  responsible DNS modification for those that need it.
  For more details about the Lua scripting, which can be modified,
  loaded and unloaded at runtime, see Section 12.6. Many thanks are
  due to the #lua irc channel, for excellent near-realtime Lua
  support. In addition, a number of PowerDNS users have been
  enthousiastically testing prereleases of the scripting support,
  and have found and solved many issues. 
  - In 3.1.5 and 3.1.6, an authoritative server could continue to
    renew its authority, even though a domain had been delegated to
    other servers in the meantime.
  - In the rare cases where this happened, and the old servers were
    not shut down, the observed effect is that users were fed
    outdated data.
  - Bug spotted and analysed by Darren Gamble, fix in commit 1182
    and commit 1183.
  - Thanks to long time PowerDNS contributor Stefan Arentz, for the
    first time, Mac OS X 10.5 users can compile and run the
    PowerDNS Recursor! Patch in commit 1185.
  - Sten Spans spotted that for outgoing TCP/IP queries, the
    query-local-address setting was not honored. Fixed in commit
    1190.
  - rec_control wipe-cache now also wipes domains from the negative
    cache, hurrying up the expiry of negatively cached records.
    Suggested by Simon Kirby, implemented in commit 1204.
  - When a forwarder server is configured for a domain, using the
    forward-zones setting, this server IP address was filtered
    using the dont-query setting, which is generally not what is
    desired: the server to which queries are forwarded will often
    live in private IP space, and the operator should be trusted to
    know what he is doing. Reported and argued by Simon Kirby, fix
    in commit 1211.
  - Marcus Rueckert of OpenSUSE reported that very recent gcc
    versions emitted a (correct) warning on an overly complicated
    line in syncres.cc, fixed in commit 1189.
  - Stefan Schmidt discovered that the netmask matching code, used
    by the new Lua scripts, but also by all other parts of
    PowerDNS, had problems with explicit '/32' matches. Fixed in
    commit 1205.
