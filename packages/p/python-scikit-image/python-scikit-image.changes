  * API Changes
    + Deprecated subpackage "skimage.novice" has been removed.
    + Default value of "multichannel" parameters has been set to False
      in `skimage.transform.rescale`,
      `skimage.transform.pyramid_reduce`,
      `skimage.transform.pyramid_laplacian`,.transform.pyramid_gaussian`,
      and `skimage.transform.pyramid_expand`. Guessing is no longer
      performed for 3D.
    + Deprecated argument "visualise" has been removed
      from.feature.hog`. Use "visualize" instead.¨
    + `skimage.transform.seam_carve` has been completely removed from
      the library due to licensing restrictions.
    + Parameter "as_grey" has been removed from `skimage.data.load`
      and `skimage.io.imread`. Use "as_gray" instead.
    + Parameter "min_size" has been removed from
      `skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes`. Use "area_threshold"
      instead.
    + Deprecated "correct_mesh_orientation" in `skimage.measure` has
      been removed.
    + `skimage.measure._regionprops` has been completely switched to
      using-column coordinates. Old x-y interface is not longer
      available.
    + Default value of "behavior" parameter has been set to "ndimage"
      in `skimage.filters.median`.
    + Parameter "flatten" in `skimage.io.imread` has been removed in
      favor of "as_gray".
    + Parameters "Hxx, Hxy, Hyy" have been removed from
      `skimage.feature.corner.hessian_matrix_eigvals` in favor of
      "H_elems".
    + Default value of "order" parameter has been set to "rc" in
      `skimage.feature.hessian_matrix`.
    + "skimage.util.img_as_*" functions no longer raise precision
      and/or loss warnings.
  * Bugfixes
    + Corrected error with scales attribute in ORB.detect_and_extract
      (#2835) The scales attribute wasn't taking into account the
      mask, and thus was using an incorrect array size.
    + Correct for bias in Inverse Randon Transform
      (`skimage.transform.irandon`) (#3067) Fixed by using the Ramp
      filter equation in the spatial domain as described in the
      reference
    + Fix a rounding issue that caused a rotated image to have a
      different size than the input (`skimage.transform.rotate`)
      (#3173)
    + RANSAC uses random subsets of the original data and not
      bootstraps. (#3901, #3915)
    + Canny now produces the same output regardless of dtype (#3919)
    + Geometry Transforms: avoid division by zero & some degenerate
      cases (#3926)
    + Fixed float32 support in denoise_bilateral and
      denoise_tv_bregman (#3936)
    + Fixed computation of Meijering filter and avoid
      ZeroDivisionError (#3957)
    + Fixed `skimage.filters.threshold_li` to prevent being stuck on
      stationnary points, and thus at local minima or maxima (#3966)
    + Edited `skimage.exposure.rescale_intensity` to return input
      image instead of nans when all 0 (#4015)
    + Fixed `skimage.morphology.medial_axis`. A wrong indentation in
      Cython caused the function to not behave as intended. (#4060)
    + Fixed `skimage.restoration.denoise_bilateral` by correcting the
      padding in the gaussian filter(#4080)
    + Fixed `skimage.measure.find_contours` when input image contains
      NaN.  Contours interesting NaN will be left open (#4150)
    + Fixed `skimage.feature.blob_log` and `skimage.feature.blob_dog`
      for 3D images and anisotropic data (#4162)
    + Fixed `skimage.exposure.adjust_gamma`,
      `skimage.exposure.adjust_log`, and
      `skimage.exposure.adjust_sigmoid` such that when provided with a
      1 by 1 ndarray, it returns 1 by 1 ndarrays and not single number
      floats (#4169)
  * Deprecations
    + Parameter "neighbors" in `skimage.measure.convex_hull_object`
      has been deprecated in favor of "connectivity" and will be
      removed in version 0.18.0.
    + The following functions are deprecated in favor of the
      `skimage.metrics` module (#4025):
        - `skimage.measure.compare_mse`
        - `skimage.measure.compare_nrmse`
        - `skimage.measure.compare_psnr`
        - `skimage.measure.compare_ssim`
    + The function `skimage.color.guess_spatial_dimensions` is
      deprecated and will be removed in 0.18 (#4031)
    + The argument "bc" in `skimage.segmentation.active_contour` is
      deprecated.
    + The function `skimage.data.load` is deprecated and will be
      removed in 0.18 (#4061)
    + The function `skimage.transform.match_histogram` is deprecated
      in favor of `skimage.exposure.match_histogram` (#4107)
    + The parameter "neighbors" of
      `skimage.morphology.convex_hull_object` is deprecated.
    + The `skimage.transform.randon_tranform` function will convert
      input image of integer type to float by default in 0.18. To
      preserve current behaviour, set the new argument
      "preserve_range" to True. (#4131)

  + New Features
    * N-dimensional flood fill, with tolerance
    * Attribute operators
    * Extension of register_translation to enable subpixel precision in 3D and
      optionally disable error calculation
    * unsharp mask filtering
    * New options ``connectivity``, ``indices`` and ``allow_borders`` for
      ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``local_minima``.
    * Image translation registration for masked data
      (``skimage.feature.masked_register_translation``)
    * Frangi (vesselness), Meijering (neuriteness), and Sato (tubeness) filters
    * Allow float->float conversion of any range
    * Let lower precision float arrays pass through ``img_as_float``
    * Lazy apply_parallel (allows optimization of dask array operations)
    * Add range option for histogram.
    * Add histogram matching
  + Improvements
    * Replace ``morphology.local_maxima`` with faster flood-fill based Cython
      version
    * ``skivi`` is now using ``qtpy`` for Qt4/Qt5/PySide/PySide2 compatibility (a
      new optional dependency).
    * Performance is now monitored by
      `Airspeed Velocity <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Benchmark
      results will appear at https://pandas.pydata.org/speed/
    * Speed up inner loop of GLCM
    * Allow tuple to define kernel in threshold_niblack and threshold_sauvola
    * Add support for anisotropic blob detection in blob_log and blob_dog
  + API Changes
    * ``skimage.transform.seam_carve`` has been removed because the algorithm is
      patented.
    * Parameter ``dynamic_range`` in ``skimage.measure.compare_psnr`` has been
      removed. Use parameter ``data_range`` instead.
    * imageio is now the preferred plugin for reading and writing images.
    * imageio is now a dependency of scikit-image.
    * ``regular_grid`` now returns a tuple instead of a list for compatibility
      with numpy 1.15
    * ``colorconv.separate_stains`` and ``colorconv.combine_stains`` now uses
      base10 instead of the natural logarithm as discussed in issue #2995.
    * Default value of ``clip_negative`` parameter in ``skimage.util.dtype_limits``
      has been set to ``False``.
    * Default value of ``circle`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.radon``
      has been set to ``True``.
    * Default value of ``circle`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.iradon``
      has been set to ``True``.
    * Default value of ``mode`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.swirl``
      has been set to ``reflect``.
    * Deprecated ``skimage.filters.threshold_adaptive`` has been removed.
      Use ``skimage.filters.threshold_local`` instead.
    * Default value of ``multichannel`` parameter in
      ``skimage.restoration.denoise_bilateral`` has been set to ``False``.
    * Default value of ``multichannel`` parameter in
      ``skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means`` has been set to ``False``.
    * Default value of ``mode`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.resize``
      and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` has been set to ``reflect``.
    * Default value of ``anti_aliasing`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.resize``
      and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` has been set to ``True``.
    * Removed the ``skimage.test`` function. This functionality can be achieved
      by calling ``pytest`` directly.
    * ``morphology.local_maxima`` now returns a boolean array
  + Bugfixes
    * Correct bright ridge detection for Frangi filter
    * ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``skimage.morphology.local_minima``
      no longer raise an error if any dimension of the image is smaller 3 and
      the keyword ``allow_borders`` was false.
    * ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``skimage.morphology.local_minima``
      will return a boolean array instead of an array of 0s and 1s if the
      parameter ``indices`` was false.
    * When ``compare_ssim`` is used with ``gaussian_weights`` set to True, the
      boundary crop used when computing the mean structural similarity will now
      exactly match the width of the Gaussian used. The Gaussian filter window is
      also now truncated at 3.5 rather than 4.0 standard deviations to exactly match
      the original publication on the SSIM. These changes should produce only a very
      small change in the computed SSIM value. There is no change to the existing
      behavior when ``gaussian_weights`` is False.
    * erroneous use of cython wrap around
    * Speed up block reduce by providing the appropriate parameters to numpy
    * Add urllib.request again
    * Repeat pixels in reflect mode when image has dimension 1
    * Improve Li thresholding
  + Deprecations
    * Python 2 support has been dropped. Users should have Python >= 3.5.
    * ``skimage.util.montage2d`` has been removed. Use ``skimage.util.montage`` instead.
    * ``skimage.novice`` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.16.
    * ``skimage.transform.resize`` and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` option
      ``anti_aliasing`` has been enabled by default.
    * ``regionprops`` will use row-column coordinates in 0.16. You can start
      using them now with ``regionprops(..., coordinates='rc')``. You can silence
      warning messages, and retain the old behavior, with
      ``regionprops(..., coordinates='xy')``. However, that option will go away
      in 0.16 and result in an error. This change has a number of consequences.
      Specifically, the "orientation" region property will measure the
      anticlockwise angle from a *vertical* line, i.e. from the vector (1, 0) in
      row-column coordinates.
    * ``skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes`` ``min_size`` argument is deprecated
      and will be removed in 0.16. Use ``area_threshold`` instead.
    * ``skimage.filters.median`` will change behavior in the future to have an
      identical behavior as ``scipy.ndimage.median_filter``. This behavior can be
      set already using ``behavior='ndimage'``. In 0.16, it will be the default
      behavior and removed in 0.17 as well as the parameter of the previous
      behavior (i.e., ``mask``, ``shift_x``, ``shift_y``) will be removed.

Sun Sep  2 16:58:45 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year
  * TASKS file not in tar-ball anymore, removed it, added CONTRIBUTING.txt file

- update to version 0.14.0:
  * New Features
    + Lookfor function to search across the library:
      skimage.lookfor. (#2713)
    + nD support for skimage.transform.rescale,
      skimage.transform.resize, and skimage.transform.pyramid_*
      transforms. (#1522)
    + Chan-Vese segmentation algorithm. (#1957)
    + Manual segmentation with matplotlib for fast data annotation:
      skimage.future.manual_polygon_segmentation,
      skimage.future.manual_lasso_segmentation. (#2584)
    + Hysteresis thresholding:
      skimage.filters.apply_hysteresis_threshold. (#2665)
    + Segmentation with morphological snakes:
      skimage.segmentation.morphological_chan_vese (2D),
      skimage.segmentation.morphological_geodesic_active_contour (2D
      and 3D). (#2791)
    + nD support for image moments: skimage.measure.moments_central,
      skimage.measure.moments_central,
      skimage.measure.moments_normalized,
      skimage.measure.moments_hu. This change leads to 3D/nD
      compatibility for many regionprops. (#2603)
    + Image moments from coordinate input:
      skimage.measure.moments_coords,
      skimage.measure.moments_coords_central. (#2859)
    + Added 3D support to blob_dog and blob_log. (#2854)
    + Inertia tensor and its eigenvalues can now be computed outside
      of regionprops; available in
      skimage.measure.inertia_tensor. (#2603)
    + Cycle-spinning function for approximating shift-invariance by
      averaging results from a series of spatial shifts:
      skimage.restoration.cycle_spin. (#2647)
    + Haar-like feature: skimage.feature.haar_like_feature,
      skimage.feature.haar_like_feature_coord,
      skimage.feature.draw_haar_like_feature. (#2848)
    + Data generation with random_shapes function:
      skimage.draw.random_shapes. (#2773)
    + Subset of LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) database:
      skimage.data.cbcl_face_database. (#2905)
    + Fully reworked montage function (now with a better padding
      behavior): skimage.util.montage. (#2626)
    + YDbDr colorspace conversion routines: skimage.color.rgb2ydbdr,
      skimage.color.ydbdr2rgb. (#3018)
  * Improvements
    + VisuShrink method for
      skimage.restoration.denoise_wavelet. (#2470)
    + New max_ratio parameter for
      skimage.feature.match_descriptors. (#2472)
    + skimage.transform.resize and skimage.transform.rescale have a
      new anti_aliasing option to avoid aliasing artifacts when
      down-sampling images. (#2802)
    + Support for multichannel images for skimage.feature.hog. (#2870)
    + Non-local means denoising (skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means)
      has a new optional parameter, sigma, that can be used to specify
      the noise standard deviation. This enables noise-robust patch
      distance estimation. (#2890)
    + Mixed dtypes support for skimage.measure.compare_ssim,
      skimage.measure.compare_psnr, etc. (#2893)
    + New alignment parameter in skimage.feature.plot_matches. (#2955)
    + New seed parameter in
      skimage.transform.probabilistic_hough_line. (#2960)
    + Various performance improvements. (#2821, #2878, #2967, #3035,
      #3056, #3100)
  * Bugfixes
    + Fixed skimage.measure.regionprops.bbox_area returning incorrect
      value. (#2837)
    + Changed gradient and L2-Hys norm computation in
      skimage.feature.hog to closely follow the paper. (#2864)
    + Fixed skimage.color.convert_colorspace not working for YCbCr,
      YPbPr. (#2780)
    + Fixed incorrect composition of projective tranformation with
      inverse transformation. (#2826)
    + Fixed bug in random walker appearing when seed pixels are
      isolated inside pruned zones. (#2946)
    + Fixed rescale not working properly with different rescale
      factors in multichannel case. (#2959)
    + Fixed float and integer dtype support in
      skimage.util.invert. (#3030)
    + Fixed skimage.measure.find_contours raising StopIteration on
      Python 3.7. (#3038)
    + Fixed platform-specific issues appearing in Windows and/or
      32-bit environments. (#2867, #3033)
  * API Changes
    + skimage.util.montage. namespace has been removed, and
      skimage.util.montage.montage2d function is now available as
      skimage.util.montage2d.
    + skimage.morphology.binary_erosion now uses True as border value,
      and is now consistent with skimage.morphology.erosion.
  * Deprecations
    + freeimage plugin has been removed from skimage.io.
    + skimage.util.montage2d is deprecated and will be removed in
      0.15. Use skimage.util.montage function instead.
    + skimage.novice is deprecated and will be removed in 0.16.
    + skimage.transform.resize and skimage.transform.rescale have a
      new anti_aliasing option that avoids aliasing artifacts when
      down-sampling images. This option will be enabled by default in
      0.15.
    + regionprops will use row-column coordinates in 0.16. You can
      start using them now with regionprops(...,
      coordinates='rc'). You can silence warning messages, and retain
      the old behavior, with regionprops(...,
      coordinates='xy'). However, that option will go away in 0.16 and
      result in an error. This change has a number of
      consequences. Specifically, the "orientation" region property
      will measure the anticlockwise angle from a vertical line,
      i.e. from the vector (1, 0) in row-column coordinates.
    + skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes min_size argument is
      deprecated and will be removed in 0.16. Use area_threshold
      instead.
