-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  5 14:31:34 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.23.2
  ## Bug Fixes
  * Make sure skimage.util.img_as_ubyte supports the edge case
    where dtype('uint64').type of the provided image is
    np.ulonglong instead of np.uint64 (#7392).
  ## Documentation
  * Add date to 0.23.1 release notes (#7384).
  * Fix docstring of connectivity parameter in
    skimage.segmentation.watershed (#7360).
  ## Infrastructure
  * Ignore Sphinx warning about unpickable cache (#7400).
  * Simplify instructions on changelist in PR template (#7401).
  ## Maintenance
  * Use numpy.inf instead of deprecated numpy.infty (#7386).
  * Update Ruff config (#7387).
  * Update matrix and names of Azure pipelines configuration
    (#7390).
  * Use upload- and download-artifact v4 (#7389).
  * Ignore arch specific cast warnings originating from astype in
    tests (#7393).
  * Update link to numpydoc example.py (#7395).
- Release 0.23.1/0.23.0
  ## Highlights
  * Ensure skimage.morphology.closing and
    skimage.morphology.opening are extensive and anti-extensive,
    respectively, if the footprint is not mirror symmetric (#6695).
  * Add parameter mode to binary_erosion, binary_dilation,
    binary_opening and binary_closing in skimage.morphology. These
    new parameters determine how array borders are handled (#6695).
  * Add parameters mode and cval to erosion, dilation, opening,
    closing, white_tophat, and black_tophat in skimage.morphology.
    These new parameters determine how array borders are handled
    (#6695).
  * Speedup skimage.util.map_array by parallelization with Cython's
    prange (#7266).
  ## New Features
  * Add new intensity_std property to skimage.measure.regionprops
    which computes the standard deviation of the intensity in a
    region (#6712).
  * Add parameter mode to binary_erosion, binary_dilation,
    binary_opening and binary_closing in skimage.morphology. These
    new parameters determine how array borders are handled (#6695).
  * Add functions mirror_footprint and pad_footprint to
    skimage.morphology (#6695).
  * Add parameters mode and cval to erosion, dilation, opening,
    closing, white_tophat, and black_tophat in skimage.morphology.
    These new parameters determine how array borders are handled
    (#6695).
  * Add new parameter spacing to segmentation.expand_labels to
    support anisotropic images (#7080).
  ## API Changes
  * Drop support for Python 3.9 (#7217).
  * Parameters shift_x and shift_y in skimage.morphology.erosion
    and skimage.morphology.dilation are deprecated. Use
    pad_footprint or modify the footprint manually instead (#6695).
  * Remove unexpected value scaling in
    skimage.morphology.skeletonize_3d for non-binary input images.
    skeletonize_3d now always returns a binary array like similar
    functions (#7095).
  * Deprecate function skimage.feature.plot_matches in favor of
    skimage.feature.plot_matched_features (#7255).
  * Deprecate skimage.morphology.skeletonize_3d in favor of just
    skimage.morphology.skeletonize (#7094).
  * Deprecate parameter output in skimage.filters.gaussian; use out
    instead (#7225).
  * Change the default value of the parameters shift_x, shift_y and
    shift_z from False to 0 in the skimage.filters.rank functions.
    This has not impact on the results. Warn in case boolean shifts
    are provided from now on (#7320).
  * Performance
  * Add lazy loading to skimage.metrics module (#7211).
  * Speedup skimage.util.map_array by parallelization with Cython's
    prange (#7266).
  ## Bug Fixes
  * Add exception to avoid surprising result when image is too
    small for the given parameters in skimage.feature.hog (#7153).
  * Ensure skimage.morphology.closing and
    skimage.morphology.opening are extensive and anti-extensive,
    respectively, if the footprint is not mirror symmetric (#6695).
  * Avoid a TypeError in
    skimage.registration.phase_cross_correlation when the real-time
    shift cannot be determined (disambiguate=True). Display a
    warning instead (#7259).
  * Fix logic in skimage.graph.pixel_graph which raised a TypeError
    when the parameter edge_function was provided without a mask
    (#7310).
  * Ensure cache stays empty when cache=False is passed to
    skimage.measure.regionprops (#7333).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  1 09:19:38 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.19.3
  * Revert unintentional change to default multichannel behavior
    introduced in v0.19.0 for skimage.restoration.cycle_spin (now
    defaults to single channel again)
  * Fix corner case with an optimal angle of 0 degrees in
    hough_line_peaks
  * Fixed the gallery example involving registration with log-polar
    transformations
  * Update test suite for compatibility with the most recent
    tifffile release.
  * warp/rotate: fixed a bug with clipping when cval is not in the
    input range
  * Fix computation of histogram bins for multichannel
    integer-valued images
  * Update skimage.future.manual_polygon_segmentation to work with
    Matplotlib 3.5.
  * Update skimage.io.imread to avoid warnings when using
    imageio>=2.16.2.
  * Now compatible with Pillow >= 9.1 (palette may contain <256
    entries)
  * Added support for NumPy 1.23
- Release 0.19.2
  * This is primarily a bug fix release, although there is one new
    gallery example related to detection of fluorescence at the
    nuclear envelope of mammalian cells.
- Release 0.19.1
  * This is a small bug fix release that resolves a couple of
    backwards compatibility issues.
- Release 0.19.0
  * A highlight of this release is the addition of the popular
    scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) feature detector and
    descriptor. This release also introduces a perceptual blur
    metric, new pixel graph algorithms, and most functions now
    operate in single-precision when single-precision inputs are
    provided. Many other bug fixes, enhancements and performance
    improvements are detailed below.
  * A significant change in this release is in the treatment of
    multichannel images. The existing multichannel argument to
    functions has been deprecated in favor of a new channel_axis
    argument. channel_axis can be used to specify which axis of an
    array contains channel information (with channel_axis=None
    indicating a grayscale image).
  * scikit-image now uses "lazy loading", which enables users to
    access the functions from all skimage submodules without the
    overhead of eagerly importing all submodules. As a concrete
    example, after calling "import skimage" a user can directly
    call a function such as skimage.transform.warp whereas
    previously it would have been required to first "import
    skimage.transform".
  * An exciting change on the development side is the introduction
    of support for Pythran as an alternative to Cython for
    generating compiled code. We plan to keep Cython support as
    well going forward, so developers are free to use either one as
    appropriate. For those curious about Pythran, a good overview
    was given in the SciPy 2021 presentation, "Building SciPy
    Kernels with Pythran"
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a9D9WL6ZjQ).
  * This release now supports Python 3.7-3.10.
- Release 0.18.3
  * This is a small bugfix release for compatibility with Pooch 1.5
    and SciPy 1.7.
- Release 0.18.2
  * This release fixes a couple of minor bugs.
- Add skimage-fix-module-install.patch
  * gh#scikit-image/scikit-image#6428

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 22 19:18:32 UTC 2021 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

  * Fix indexing error for labelling in large (>2GB) arrays (#5143,
    #5151)
  * Only use retry_if_failed with recent pooch (#5148)
- Announcement: scikit-image 0.18.0
  * We're happy to announce the release of scikit-image v0.18.0!
  * scikit-image is an image processing toolbox for SciPy
    that includes algorithms for segmentation, geometric
    transformations, color space manipulation, analysis,
    filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.
  * This release of scikit-image drops support for Python
    3.6 in accordance with the NEP-29 Python and Numpy
    version support community standard
    <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>_:
    Python 3.7 or
    newer is required to run this version.
  * For more information, examples, and documentation,
    please visit our website: https://scikit-image.org

    has been changed due to copyright issues (#4913).
  * skimage.feature.structure_tensor now supports 3D (and nD) 
    images as input (#5002)
  * Many thresholding methods can now receive a precomputed 
    histogram as input, resulting in significant speedups if 
    multiple methods are tried on the same image, or if a fast 
    histogram method is used. (#5006)
  * measure.regionprops now supports multichannel intensity images 
    (#5037)
  Documentation
  * Add an example to the flood fill tutorial (#4619)
  * Docstring enhancements for marching cubes and find_contours 
    (#4641)
  * A new tutorial presenting a cell biology example has been

  * A new example demonstrates interactive exploration of 
    regionprops results using the PyData stack (pandas, seaborn) 
    at https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_regionprops.html
    (#5010).
  * Documentation has been added to explain how to download 
    example datasets <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/install.html#downloading-all-demo-datasets>_
    which are not installed with scikit-image (#4984). Similarly, 
    the contributor guide has been updated to mention how to host 
    new datasets in a gitlab repository (#4892).
  * The benchmarking section of the developer documentation 
    <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/contribute.html#benchmarks>_
    has been expanded (#4905).
  * Added links to the image.sc forum in example pages (#5094, 
    #5096)
  * Added missing datasets to gallery examples (#5116, #5118)
  * Add farid filters in all, to populate the documentation 
    (#5128, #5129)

  Improvements
  * float32 support for SLIC (#4683), ORB (#4684, #4697), BRIEF 
    (#4685),
  * pyramid_gaussian (#4696), Richardson-Lucy deconvolution (#4880)
  * In skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy, computations are now 
    done in single-precision when the input image is single-
    precision. This can give a substantial performance improvement 
    when working with single precision data.
  * Richardson-Lucy deconvolution now has a filter_epsilon keyword 
    argument to avoid division by very small numbers (#4823)
  * Add default level parameter (max-min) / 2 in 
    measure.find_contours (#4862)
  * The performance of the SLIC superpixels algorithm 
    (skimage.segmentation.slice) was improved for the case where a 
    mask is supplied by the user (#4903). The specific superpixels 
    produced by masked SLIC will not be identical to those 
    produced by prior releases.
  * exposure.adjust_gamma has been accelerated for uint8 images by 
    using a look-up table (LUT) (#4966).
  * measure.label has been accelerated for boolean input images, 
    by using scipy.ndimage's implementation for this case (#4945).
  * util.apply_parallel now works with multichannel data (#4927).
  * skimage.feature.peak_local_max supports now any Minkowski 
    distance.
  * We now use sparse cross-correlation to accelerate local 
    thresholding functions (#4912)
  * morphology.convex_hull_image now uses much less memory by 
    checking hull inequalities in sequence (#5020)
  * Polygon rasterization is more precise and will no longer 
    potentially exclude input vertices. (#5029)
  * Add data optional requirements to allow pip install scikit-
    image[data] (#5105, #5111)
  * OpenMP support in MSVC (#4924, #5111)
  * Restandardize handling of Multi-Image files (#2815, #5132)
  * Consistent zoom boundary behavior across SciPy versions (#5131, 
    #5133)
  API Changes
  * skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy returns a single-precision 
    output when the input is single-precision. Prior to this 
    release, double-precision was always used. (#4880)
  * The default value of threshold_rel in skimage.feature.corner 
    has changed from 0.1 to None, which corresponds to letting
  * skimage.feature.peak_local_max decide on the default. This is 
    currently equivalent to threshold_rel=0.
  * In measure.label, the deprecated neighbors parameter has been
    removed. (#4942)
  * The image returned by data.camera has changed because of 
    copyright issues (#4913).
  Bug fixes
  * A bug in label2rgb has been fixed when the input image had 
    np.uint8 dtype (#4661)
  * Fixed incorrect implementation of skimage.color.separate_stains 
    (#4725)
  * Many bug fixes have been made in peak_local_max (#2592, #4756, 
    #4760, #5047)
  * Fix bug in random_walker when input labels have negative values 
    (#4771)
  * PSF flipping is now correct for Richardson-Lucy deconvolution 
    work in >2D (#4823)
  * Fix equalize_adapthist (CLAHE) for clip value 1.0 (#4828)
  * For the RANSAC algorithm, improved the case where all data 
    points are outliers, which was previously raising an error
    (#4844)
  * An error-causing bug has been corrected for the bg_color 
    parameter in label2rgb when its value is a string (#4840)
  * A normalization bug was fixed in 
    metrics.variation_of_information (#4875)
  * Euler characteristic property of skimage.measure.regionprops 
    was erroneous for 3D objects, since it did not take tunnels 
    into account. A new implementation based on integral geometry
    fixes this bug (#4380).
  * In skimage.morphology.selem.rectangle the height argument
    controlled the width and the width argument controlled the 
    height. They have been replaced with nrow and ncol. (#4906)
  * skimage.segmentation.flood_fill and skimage.segmentation.flood
    now consistently handle negative values for seed_point.
  * Segmentation faults in segmentation.flood have been fixed 
    (#4948, #4972)
  * A segfault in draw.polygon for the case of 0-d input has been   
    fixed (#4943).
  * In registration.phase_cross_correlation, a ValueError is raised 
    when NaNs are found in the computation (as a result of NaNs in 
    input images). Before this fix, an incorrect value could be 
    returned where the input images had NaNs (#4886).
  * Fix edge filters not respecting padding mode (#4907)
  * Use v{} for version tags with pooch (#5104, #5110)
  * Fix compilation error in XCode 12 (#5107, #5111)
  Deprecations
  * The indices argument in skimage.feature.peak_local_max has been
    deprecated. Indices will always be returned. (#4752)
  * In skimage.feature.structure_tensor, an order argument has been
    introduced which will default to 'rc' starting in version 0.20. 
    (#4841)
  * skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigvals has been deprecated 
    and will be removed in version 0.20. Use 
    skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigenvalues instead.
  * The skimage.viewer subpackage and the skivi script have been   
    deprecated and will be removed in version 0.20. For interactive 
    visualization we recommend using dedicated tools such as napari 
    <https://napari.org>_ or plotly <https://plotly.com>_. In a 
    similar vein, the qt and skivi plugins of skimage.io have been 
    deprecated and will be removed in version 0.20. (#4941, #4954)
  * In skimage.morphology.selem.rectangle the arguments width and
    height have been deprecated. Use nrow and ncol instead.
  * The explicit setting threshold_rel=0` was removed from the 
    Examples of the following docstrings: skimage.feature.BRIEF, 
    skimage.feature.corner_harris, 
    skimage.feature.corner_shi_tomasi, 
    skimage.feature.corner_foerstner, skimage.feature.corner_fast, 
    skimage.feature.corner_subpix, skimage.feature.corner_peaks, 
    skimage.feature.corner_orientations, and 
    skimage.feature._detect_octave``.
  * In skimage.restoration._denoise, the warning regarding
    rescale_sigma=None was removed.
  * In skimage.restoration._cycle_spin, the # doctest: +SKIP was 
    removed.

- update to version 0.17.1:
  * fixed bug in label2rgb

- changes from version 0.17.0:
  * New Features
    + Hyperparameter calibration of denoising algorithms with
      restoration.calibrate_denoiser (#3824), with corresponding
      gallery example and tutorial.
    + measure.profile_line has a new reduce_func parameter to accept a
      reduction operation to be computed on pixel values along the
      profile (#4206)
    + nD windows for reducing spectral leakage when computing the FFT
      of n-dimensional images, with filters.window (#4252) (with new
      gallery example)
    + Add Minkowski distance metric support to corner_peak (#4218)
    + util.map_array was introduced to map a set of pixel values to
      another one (for example to map region labels to the size of
      regions in an image of labels) #4612 and #4646
    + Masked marching cubes (#3829)
    + The SLIC superpixel algorithm now accepts a mask to exclude some
      parts of the image and force the superpixel boundaries to follow
      the boundary of the mask (#3850)
    + Pooch -- on the fly download of datasets from github: we
      introduced the possibility to include larger datasets in the
      data submodule, thanks to the pooch library. data.download_all
      fetches all datasets. (#3945)
    + Starting with this version, our gallery examples now have links
      to run the example notebook on a binder instance. (#4543)
    + New doc tutorials and gallery examples have been added to the
      use of regionprops_table (#4348) geometrical transformations
      (#4385), and the registration of rotation and scaling with no
      shared center (#4515). A new section on registration has been
      added to the gallery (#4575).
  * Improvements
    + scikit-image aims at being fully compatible with 3D arrays, and
      when possible with nD arrays. nD support has been added to color
      conversion functions (#4418), to the CLAHE
      exposure.equalize_adapthist algorithm (#4598) and to the Sobel,
      Scharr, and Prewitt filters (#4347).
    + Multichannel support for denoise_tv_bregman (#4446)
    + The memory footprint of segmentation.relabel_sequential has been
      reduced in the case of labels much larger than the number of
      labels (#4612)
    + Random ellipses are now possible in draw.random_shapes (#4493)
    + Add border conditions to ridge filters (#4396)
    + segmentation.random_walker new Jacobi preconditioned conjugate
      gradient mode (#4359) and minor corrections #4630
    + Warn when rescaling with NaN in exposure.intensity_range (#4265)
    + We have also improved the consistency of several functions
      regarding the way they handle data types
    + Make dtype consistent in filters.rank functions (#4289)
    + Fix colorconv float32 to double cast (#4296)
    + Prevent radon from upcasting float32 arrays to double (#4297)
    + Manage iradon_sart input and output data type (#4300)
  * API Changes
    + When used with floating point inputs, denoise_wavelet no longer
      rescales the range of the data or clips the output to the range
      [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. For non-float inputs, rescaling and clipping
      still occurs as in prior releases (although with a bugfix
      related to the scaling of sigma).
    + For 2D input, edge filters (Sobel, Scharr, Prewitt, Roberts, and
      Farid) no longer set the boundary pixels to 0 when a mask is not
      supplied. This was changed because the boundary mode for
      scipy.ndimage.convolve is now 'reflect', which allows meaningful
      values at the borders for these filters. To retain the old
      behavior, pass mask=np.ones(image.shape, dtype=bool) (#4347)
    + When out_range is a range of numbers and not a dtype in
      :func:`skimage.exposure.rescale_intensity`, the output data type
      will always be float (#4585)
    + The values returned by
      :func:`skimage.exposure.equalize_adapthist` will be slightly
      different from previous versions due to different rounding
      behavior (#4585)
    + Move masked_register_translation from feature to registration
      (#4503)
    + Move register_translation from skimage.feature to
      skimage.registration (#4502)
    + Move watershed from morphology to segmentation (#4443)
    + Rename draw.circle() to draw.disk() (#4428)
    + The forward and backward maps returned by
      :func:`skimage.segmentation.relabel_sequential` are no longer
      NumPy arrays, but more memory-efficient ArrayMap objects that
      behave the same way for mapping. See the relabel_sequential
      documentation for more details. To get NumPy arrays back, cast
      it as a NumPy array: np.asarray(forward_map) (#4612)
  * Bugfixes
    + denoise_wavelet: For user-supplied sigma, if the input image
      gets rescaled via img_as_float, the same scaling will be applied
      to sigma to preserve the relative scale of the noise
      estimate. To restore the old, behaviour, the user can manually
      specify rescale_sigma=False.
    + Fix Frangi artefacts around the image (#4343)
    + Fix Negative eigenvalue in inertia_tensor_eigvals due to
      floating point precision (#4589)
    + Fix morphology.flood for F-ordered images (#4556)
    + Fix h_maxima/minima strange behaviors on floating point image
      input (#4496)
    + Fix peak_local_max coordinates ordering (#4501)
    + Sort naturally peaks coordinates of same amplitude in
      peak_local_max (#4582)
    + Fix denoise_nl_means data type management (#4322)
    + Update rescale_intensity to prevent under/overflow and produce
      proper output dtype (#4585)
  * Deprecations
    + The minimal supported Python version by this release is 3.6.
    + Parameter inplace in skimage.morphology.flood_fill has been
      deprecated in favor of in_place and will be removed in version
      scikit-image 0.19.0 (#4250).
    + skimage.segmentation.circle_level_set has been deprecated and
      will be removed in 0.19. Use skimage.segmentation.disk_level_set
      instead.
    + skimage.draw.circle has been deprecated and will be removed in
      0.19. Use skimage.draw.disk instead.
    + Deprecate filter argument in iradon due to clash with python
      keyword (#4158)
    + Deprecate marching_cubes_classic (#4287)
    + Change label2rgb default background value from -1 to 0 (#4614)

    + Complete deprecation of circle in morphsnakes (#4467)

  * API Changes
    + Deprecated subpackage "skimage.novice" has been removed.
    + Default value of "multichannel" parameters has been set to False
      in `skimage.transform.rescale`,
      `skimage.transform.pyramid_reduce`,
      `skimage.transform.pyramid_laplacian`,.transform.pyramid_gaussian`,
      and `skimage.transform.pyramid_expand`. Guessing is no longer

    + `skimage.transform.seam_carve` has been completely removed from
      the library due to licensing restrictions.
    + Parameter "as_grey" has been removed from `skimage.data.load`
      and `skimage.io.imread`. Use "as_gray" instead.
    + Parameter "min_size" has been removed from
      `skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes`. Use "area_threshold"
      instead.
    + Deprecated "correct_mesh_orientation" in `skimage.measure` has
      been removed.
    + `skimage.measure._regionprops` has been completely switched to

      `skimage.feature.hessian_matrix`.
    + "skimage.util.img_as_*" functions no longer raise precision
      and/or loss warnings.
  * Bugfixes
    + Corrected error with scales attribute in ORB.detect_and_extract
      (#2835) The scales attribute wasn't taking into account the
      mask, and thus was using an incorrect array size.
    + Correct for bias in Inverse Randon Transform
      (`skimage.transform.irandon`) (#3067) Fixed by using the Ramp
      filter equation in the spatial domain as described in the
      reference
    + Fix a rounding issue that caused a rotated image to have a
      different size than the input (`skimage.transform.rotate`)
      (#3173)
    + RANSAC uses random subsets of the original data and not
      bootstraps. (#3901, #3915)
    + Canny now produces the same output regardless of dtype (#3919)
    + Geometry Transforms: avoid division by zero & some degenerate
      cases (#3926)
    + Fixed float32 support in denoise_bilateral and
      denoise_tv_bregman (#3936)
    + Fixed computation of Meijering filter and avoid
      ZeroDivisionError (#3957)
    + Fixed `skimage.filters.threshold_li` to prevent being stuck on
      stationnary points, and thus at local minima or maxima (#3966)
    + Edited `skimage.exposure.rescale_intensity` to return input
      image instead of nans when all 0 (#4015)
    + Fixed `skimage.morphology.medial_axis`. A wrong indentation in
      Cython caused the function to not behave as intended. (#4060)
    + Fixed `skimage.restoration.denoise_bilateral` by correcting the
      padding in the gaussian filter(#4080)
    + Fixed `skimage.measure.find_contours` when input image contains
      NaN.  Contours interesting NaN will be left open (#4150)
    + Fixed `skimage.feature.blob_log` and `skimage.feature.blob_dog`
      for 3D images and anisotropic data (#4162)
    + Fixed `skimage.exposure.adjust_gamma`,
      `skimage.exposure.adjust_log`, and
      `skimage.exposure.adjust_sigmoid` such that when provided with a
      1 by 1 ndarray, it returns 1 by 1 ndarrays and not single number
      floats (#4169)
  * Deprecations
    + Parameter "neighbors" in `skimage.measure.convex_hull_object`
      has been deprecated in favor of "connectivity" and will be
      removed in version 0.18.0.
    + The following functions are deprecated in favor of the
      `skimage.metrics` module (#4025):
        - `skimage.measure.compare_mse`
        - `skimage.measure.compare_nrmse`
        - `skimage.measure.compare_psnr`
        - `skimage.measure.compare_ssim`
    + The function `skimage.color.guess_spatial_dimensions` is
      deprecated and will be removed in 0.18 (#4031)
    + The argument "bc" in `skimage.segmentation.active_contour` is
      deprecated.
    + The function `skimage.data.load` is deprecated and will be
      removed in 0.18 (#4061)
    + The function `skimage.transform.match_histogram` is deprecated
      in favor of `skimage.exposure.match_histogram` (#4107)
    + The parameter "neighbors" of
      `skimage.morphology.convex_hull_object` is deprecated.
    + The `skimage.transform.randon_tranform` function will convert
      input image of integer type to float by default in 0.18. To
      preserve current behaviour, set the new argument
      "preserve_range" to True. (#4131)

  + New Features
    * N-dimensional flood fill, with tolerance
    * Attribute operators
    * Extension of register_translation to enable subpixel precision in 3D and
      optionally disable error calculation
    * unsharp mask filtering
    * New options ``connectivity``, ``indices`` and ``allow_borders`` for
      ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``local_minima``.
    * Image translation registration for masked data
      (``skimage.feature.masked_register_translation``)
    * Frangi (vesselness), Meijering (neuriteness), and Sato (tubeness) filters
    * Allow float->float conversion of any range
    * Let lower precision float arrays pass through ``img_as_float``
    * Lazy apply_parallel (allows optimization of dask array operations)
    * Add range option for histogram.
    * Add histogram matching
  + Improvements
    * Replace ``morphology.local_maxima`` with faster flood-fill based Cython
      version
    * ``skivi`` is now using ``qtpy`` for Qt4/Qt5/PySide/PySide2 compatibility (a
      new optional dependency).
    * Performance is now monitored by
      `Airspeed Velocity <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Benchmark
      results will appear at https://pandas.pydata.org/speed/
    * Speed up inner loop of GLCM
    * Allow tuple to define kernel in threshold_niblack and threshold_sauvola
    * Add support for anisotropic blob detection in blob_log and blob_dog
  + API Changes
    * ``skimage.transform.seam_carve`` has been removed because the algorithm is
      patented.
    * Parameter ``dynamic_range`` in ``skimage.measure.compare_psnr`` has been
      removed. Use parameter ``data_range`` instead.
    * imageio is now the preferred plugin for reading and writing images.
    * imageio is now a dependency of scikit-image.
    * ``regular_grid`` now returns a tuple instead of a list for compatibility
      with numpy 1.15
    * ``colorconv.separate_stains`` and ``colorconv.combine_stains`` now uses
      base10 instead of the natural logarithm as discussed in issue #2995.
    * Default value of ``clip_negative`` parameter in ``skimage.util.dtype_limits``
      has been set to ``False``.
    * Default value of ``circle`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.radon``
      has been set to ``True``.
    * Default value of ``circle`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.iradon``
      has been set to ``True``.
    * Default value of ``mode`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.swirl``
      has been set to ``reflect``.
    * Deprecated ``skimage.filters.threshold_adaptive`` has been removed.
      Use ``skimage.filters.threshold_local`` instead.
    * Default value of ``multichannel`` parameter in
      ``skimage.restoration.denoise_bilateral`` has been set to ``False``.
    * Default value of ``multichannel`` parameter in
      ``skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means`` has been set to ``False``.
    * Default value of ``mode`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.resize``
      and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` has been set to ``reflect``.
    * Default value of ``anti_aliasing`` parameter in ``skimage.transform.resize``
      and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` has been set to ``True``.
    * Removed the ``skimage.test`` function. This functionality can be achieved
      by calling ``pytest`` directly.
    * ``morphology.local_maxima`` now returns a boolean array
  + Bugfixes
    * Correct bright ridge detection for Frangi filter
    * ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``skimage.morphology.local_minima``
      no longer raise an error if any dimension of the image is smaller 3 and
      the keyword ``allow_borders`` was false.
    * ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``skimage.morphology.local_minima``
      will return a boolean array instead of an array of 0s and 1s if the
      parameter ``indices`` was false.
    * When ``compare_ssim`` is used with ``gaussian_weights`` set to True, the
      boundary crop used when computing the mean structural similarity will now
      exactly match the width of the Gaussian used. The Gaussian filter window is
      also now truncated at 3.5 rather than 4.0 standard deviations to exactly match
      the original publication on the SSIM. These changes should produce only a very
      small change in the computed SSIM value. There is no change to the existing
      behavior when ``gaussian_weights`` is False.
    * erroneous use of cython wrap around
    * Speed up block reduce by providing the appropriate parameters to numpy
    * Add urllib.request again
    * Repeat pixels in reflect mode when image has dimension 1
    * Improve Li thresholding
  + Deprecations
    * Python 2 support has been dropped. Users should have Python >= 3.5.
    * ``skimage.util.montage2d`` has been removed. Use ``skimage.util.montage`` instead.
    * ``skimage.novice`` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.16.
    * ``skimage.transform.resize`` and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` option
      ``anti_aliasing`` has been enabled by default.
    * ``regionprops`` will use row-column coordinates in 0.16. You can start
      using them now with ``regionprops(..., coordinates='rc')``. You can silence
      warning messages, and retain the old behavior, with
      ``regionprops(..., coordinates='xy')``. However, that option will go away
      in 0.16 and result in an error. This change has a number of consequences.
      Specifically, the "orientation" region property will measure the
      anticlockwise angle from a *vertical* line, i.e. from the vector (1, 0) in
      row-column coordinates.
    * ``skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes`` ``min_size`` argument is deprecated
      and will be removed in 0.16. Use ``area_threshold`` instead.
    * ``skimage.filters.median`` will change behavior in the future to have an
      identical behavior as ``scipy.ndimage.median_filter``. This behavior can be
      set already using ``behavior='ndimage'``. In 0.16, it will be the default
      behavior and removed in 0.17 as well as the parameter of the previous
      behavior (i.e., ``mask``, ``shift_x``, ``shift_y``) will be removed.

Sun Sep  2 16:58:45 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year
  * TASKS file not in tar-ball anymore, removed it, added CONTRIBUTING.txt file

- update to version 0.14.0:
  * New Features
    + Lookfor function to search across the library:
      skimage.lookfor. (#2713)
    + nD support for skimage.transform.rescale,
      skimage.transform.resize, and skimage.transform.pyramid_*
      transforms. (#1522)
    + Chan-Vese segmentation algorithm. (#1957)
    + Manual segmentation with matplotlib for fast data annotation:
      skimage.future.manual_polygon_segmentation,
      skimage.future.manual_lasso_segmentation. (#2584)
    + Hysteresis thresholding:
      skimage.filters.apply_hysteresis_threshold. (#2665)
    + Segmentation with morphological snakes:
      skimage.segmentation.morphological_chan_vese (2D),
      skimage.segmentation.morphological_geodesic_active_contour (2D
      and 3D). (#2791)
    + nD support for image moments: skimage.measure.moments_central,
      skimage.measure.moments_central,
      skimage.measure.moments_normalized,
      skimage.measure.moments_hu. This change leads to 3D/nD
      compatibility for many regionprops. (#2603)
    + Image moments from coordinate input:
      skimage.measure.moments_coords,
      skimage.measure.moments_coords_central. (#2859)
    + Added 3D support to blob_dog and blob_log. (#2854)
    + Inertia tensor and its eigenvalues can now be computed outside
      of regionprops; available in
      skimage.measure.inertia_tensor. (#2603)
    + Cycle-spinning function for approximating shift-invariance by
      averaging results from a series of spatial shifts:
      skimage.restoration.cycle_spin. (#2647)
    + Haar-like feature: skimage.feature.haar_like_feature,
      skimage.feature.haar_like_feature_coord,
      skimage.feature.draw_haar_like_feature. (#2848)
    + Data generation with random_shapes function:
      skimage.draw.random_shapes. (#2773)
    + Subset of LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) database:
      skimage.data.cbcl_face_database. (#2905)
    + Fully reworked montage function (now with a better padding
      behavior): skimage.util.montage. (#2626)
    + YDbDr colorspace conversion routines: skimage.color.rgb2ydbdr,
      skimage.color.ydbdr2rgb. (#3018)
  * Improvements
    + VisuShrink method for
      skimage.restoration.denoise_wavelet. (#2470)
    + New max_ratio parameter for
      skimage.feature.match_descriptors. (#2472)
    + skimage.transform.resize and skimage.transform.rescale have a
      new anti_aliasing option to avoid aliasing artifacts when
      down-sampling images. (#2802)
    + Support for multichannel images for skimage.feature.hog. (#2870)
    + Non-local means denoising (skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means)
      has a new optional parameter, sigma, that can be used to specify
      the noise standard deviation. This enables noise-robust patch
      distance estimation. (#2890)
    + Mixed dtypes support for skimage.measure.compare_ssim,
      skimage.measure.compare_psnr, etc. (#2893)
    + New alignment parameter in skimage.feature.plot_matches. (#2955)
    + New seed parameter in
      skimage.transform.probabilistic_hough_line. (#2960)
    + Various performance improvements. (#2821, #2878, #2967, #3035,
      #3056, #3100)
  * Bugfixes
    + Fixed skimage.measure.regionprops.bbox_area returning incorrect
      value. (#2837)
    + Changed gradient and L2-Hys norm computation in
      skimage.feature.hog to closely follow the paper. (#2864)
    + Fixed skimage.color.convert_colorspace not working for YCbCr,
      YPbPr. (#2780)
    + Fixed incorrect composition of projective tranformation with
      inverse transformation. (#2826)
    + Fixed bug in random walker appearing when seed pixels are
      isolated inside pruned zones. (#2946)
    + Fixed rescale not working properly with different rescale
      factors in multichannel case. (#2959)
    + Fixed float and integer dtype support in
      skimage.util.invert. (#3030)
    + Fixed skimage.measure.find_contours raising StopIteration on
      Python 3.7. (#3038)
    + Fixed platform-specific issues appearing in Windows and/or
      32-bit environments. (#2867, #3033)
  * API Changes
    + skimage.util.montage. namespace has been removed, and
      skimage.util.montage.montage2d function is now available as
      skimage.util.montage2d.
    + skimage.morphology.binary_erosion now uses True as border value,
      and is now consistent with skimage.morphology.erosion.
  * Deprecations
    + freeimage plugin has been removed from skimage.io.
    + skimage.util.montage2d is deprecated and will be removed in
      0.15. Use skimage.util.montage function instead.
    + skimage.novice is deprecated and will be removed in 0.16.
    + skimage.transform.resize and skimage.transform.rescale have a
      new anti_aliasing option that avoids aliasing artifacts when
      down-sampling images. This option will be enabled by default in
      0.15.
    + regionprops will use row-column coordinates in 0.16. You can
      start using them now with regionprops(...,
      coordinates='rc'). You can silence warning messages, and retain
      the old behavior, with regionprops(...,
      coordinates='xy'). However, that option will go away in 0.16 and
      result in an error. This change has a number of
      consequences. Specifically, the "orientation" region property
      will measure the anticlockwise angle from a vertical line,
      i.e. from the vector (1, 0) in row-column coordinates.
    + skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes min_size argument is
      deprecated and will be removed in 0.16. Use area_threshold
      instead.
