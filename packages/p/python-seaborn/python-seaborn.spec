%description
Seaborn is a library for making attractive and informative
statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of
matplotlib and tightly integrated with the PyData stack,
including support for numpy and pandas data structures and
statistical routines from scipy and statsmodels.

Some of the features that seaborn offers are:
- Several built-in themes that improve on the default matplotlib
  aesthetics
- Tools for choosing color palettes to make beautiful plots that
  reveal patterns in your data
- Functions for visualizing univariate and bivariate distributions
  or for comparing them between subsets of data
- Tools that fit and visualize linear regression models for different
  kinds of independent and dependent variables
- Functions that visualize matrices of data and use clustering
  algorithms to discover structure in those matrices
- A function to plot statistical timeseries data with flexible
  estimation and representation of uncertainty around the estimate
- High-level abstractions for structuring grids of plots that let you
  easily build complex visualizations
