  <title>A lightweight GTK+ clipboard manager</title>
  <description>Parcellite is a stripped down, basic-features-only clipboard manager with a 
small memory footprint for those who like simplicity.

In GNOME and Xfce the clipboard manager will be started automatically. For 
other desktops or window managers you should also install a panel with a 
system tray or notification area if you want to use this package.</description>
