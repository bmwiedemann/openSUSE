  <title>Adds support for NTLM authentication to the requests library</title>
  <description>This package allows for HTTP NTLM authentication using
python-requests, the HTTP library for humans.  HttpNtlmAuth extends
requests' AuthBase, so it can be dropped directly in place, or used
in conjunction with a Session to make use of connection pooling.
