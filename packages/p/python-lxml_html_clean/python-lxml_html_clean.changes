  * Bugs fixed
    - The Cleaner() now scans for hidden JavaScript code embedded
      within CSS comments. In certain contexts, such as within
      <svg> or <math> tags, <style> tags may lose their intended
      function, allowing comments like /* foo */ to potentially be
      executed by the browser. If a suspicious content is detected,
      only the comment is removed.
