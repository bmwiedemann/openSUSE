- Update to 0.4.1
  * Bugs fixed
    - Removed superfluous debug prints.
- Changes from 0.4.0
  * Bugs fixed
    - The Cleaner() now scans for hidden JavaScript code embedded
      within CSS comments. In certain contexts, such as within
      <svg> or <math> tags, <style> tags may lose their intended
      function, allowing comments like /* foo */ to potentially be
      executed by the browser. If a suspicious content is detected,
      only the comment is removed.
- Changes from 0.3.1
  * Features added
    - Do not parse URL addresses when it is not necessary.

- Changes from 0.2.0
  * Features added
    - ASCII control characters (except HT, VT, CR and LF) are now
      removed from string inputs before they're parsed by lxml/libxml2.
