  1.2.25.5  Sun Feb 27 23:46:46 UTC 2022
  	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
  	- The exception fix in 1.2.25.3 unintentionally broke the build with
  	  xapian-core < 1.4.10.  To fix this we now generate the exception
  	  handling code at build time, and enable the new exceptions based on
  	  the version of xapian-core we're building against.

  1.2.25.4  Thu Nov 19 23:37:21 UTC 2020
  	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
  	- Add exception-related files which were new in 1.2.25.3 to MANIFEST
  	  so they're shipped.  Reported by Tina Müller and Leah Neukirchen.
  	- Add metadata links to homepage, bugtracker and VCS.  Suggested by
  	  Gabor Szabo.

  1.2.25.3  Tue Nov 17 00:33:44 UTC 2020
  	[Changes contributed by Alyssa Ross]
  	- Allow AUTOMATED_TESTING builds against xapian-core 1.4.x.
  	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
  	- Properly handle newer exceptions.  The C++ exception class
  	  WildcardError wasn't known to the Perl bindings, and would result in
  	  croak("something terrible happened").  The C++ exception classes
  	  DatabaseClosedError and DatabaseNotFoundError also weren't known, but
  	  these would instead be reported as their base classes DatabaseError
  	  and DatabaseOpeningError respectively.  Reported by Adam Sjøgren.
  	- README: Update to reflect that the SWIG-generated Perl bindings are
  	  stable since xapian-bindings 1.4.16.

  1.2.25.1  Mon Jul  9 03:29:14 UTC 2018
  	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
  	- Skip testcase t/parser.t if we're using xapian-core < 1.2.21 which
  	  doesn't support character '!' in the start of a range.  Reported by
  	  melmothx on #xapian.
  	- Add compatibility with Xapian git master.

  	- Backport some improvements to the POD documentation from the
  	  SWIG-based bindings in xapian-bindings 1.4.x.

  	  Test::More.
  	- Suppress dummy warning using undef value when building against
  	  xapian-core 1.4.x.

  	[Changes contributed by Val Rosca, updated by Andreas Marienborg]

  	- Wrap Enquire's add_matchspy and clear_matchspies methods, keeping
  	  track of references to Perl MatchSpy objects to avoid leaks.
  	- t/facets.t

  	  running "perl Makefile.PL".
  1.2.20.0  Wed Mar  4 00:30:08 UTC 2015
  	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
  	- Remove TODO for wrapping MatchAll and MatchNothing - these were added
  	  in 1.2.13.0.  Reported by Will Crawford.
  	- Wrap Xapian::BAD_VALUENO.
  	- Fix "make test" to use the Xapian.so we just built, rather than an
  	  installed version.
  1.2.19.0  Tue Oct 21 00:35:35 UTC 2014
  	[Changes contributed by Dmitry Karasik]

  	  (ticket#647)
  	[Changes contributed by Olly Betts]
