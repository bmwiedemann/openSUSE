  <title>AuthCookie module backed by a DBI database</title>
  <description>This module is an authentication handler that uses the basic mechanism
provided by Apache2::AuthCookie with a DBI database for ticket-based
protection. It is based on two tokens being provided, a username and
password, which can be any strings (there are no illegal characters for
either). The username is used to set the remote user as if Basic
Authentication was used.</description>
