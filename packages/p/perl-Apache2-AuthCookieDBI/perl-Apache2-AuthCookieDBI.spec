%description
This module is an authentication handler that uses the basic mechanism
provided by Apache2::AuthCookie with a DBI database for ticket-based
protection. It is based on two tokens being provided, a username and
password, which can be any strings (there are no illegal characters for
either). The username is used to set the remote user as if Basic
Authentication was used.

On an attempt to access a protected location without a valid cookie being
provided, the module prints an HTML login form (produced by a CGI or any
other handler; this can be a static file if you want to always send people
to the same entry page when they log in). This login form has fields for
username and password. On submitting it, the username and password are
looked up in the DBI database. The supplied password is checked against the
password in the database; the password in the database can be plaintext, or
a crypt() or md5_hex() checksum of the password. If this succeeds, the user
is issued a ticket. This ticket contains the username, an issue time, an
expire time, and an MD5 checksum of those and a secret key for the server.
It can optionally be encrypted before returning it to the client in the
cookie; encryption is only useful for preventing the client from seeing the
expire time. If you wish to protect passwords in transport, use an
SSL-encrypted connection. The ticket is given in a cookie that the browser
stores.

After a login the user is redirected to the location they originally wished
to view (or to a fixed page if the login "script" was really a static
file).

On this access and any subsequent attempt to access a protected document,
the browser returns the ticket to the server. The server unencrypts it if
encrypted tickets are enabled, then extracts the username, issue time,
expire time and checksum. A new checksum is calculated of the username,
issue time, expire time and the secret key again; if it agrees with the
checksum that the client supplied, we know that the data has not been
tampered with. We next check that the expire time has not passed. If not,
the ticket is still good, so we set the username.

Authorization checks then check that any "require valid-user" or "require
user jacob" settings are passed. Finally, if a "require group foo"
directive was given, the module will look up the username in a groups
database and check that the user is a member of one of the groups listed.
If all these checks pass, the document requested is displayed.

If a ticket has expired or is otherwise invalid it is cleared in the
browser and the login form is shown again.
