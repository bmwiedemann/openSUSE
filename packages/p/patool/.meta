  <title>Portable Command Line Archive File Manager</title>
  <description>patool is a portable command line archive file manager. Various archive types
can be created, extracted, tested and listed by patool.
The advantage of patool is its simplicity in handling archive files without
having to remember a myriad of programs and options.
The archive format is determined by the file(1) program and as a fallback by
the archive file extension.

patool supports 7z (.7z), ACE (.ace), ALZIP (.alz), AR (.a), ARC (.arc), ARJ
(.arj), BZIP2 (.bz2), CAB (.cab), compress (.Z), CPIO (.cpio), DEB (.deb), GZIP
(.gz), LRZIP (.lrz), LZH (.lha, .lzh), LZIP (.lz), LZMA (.lzma), LZOP (.lzo),
RPM (.rpm), RAR (.rar), TAR (.tar), XZ (.xz), and ZIP (.zip, .jar) formats.

It relies on helper applications to handle those archive formats.
