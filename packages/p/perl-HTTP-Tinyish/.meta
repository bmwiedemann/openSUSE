  <title>perl-HTTP-Tinyish - HTTP::Tiny compatible HTTP client wrappers</title>
  <description>HTTP::Tinyish is a wrapper module for HTTP client modules LWP, HTTP::Tiny and HTTP client software 'curl' and 'wget'.

It provides an API compatible to HTTP::Tiny, and the implementation has been extracted out of App::cpanminus. This module can be useful in a restrictive environment where you need to be able to download CPAN modules without an HTTPS support in built-in HTTP library.
