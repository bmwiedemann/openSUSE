%description
HTTP::Tinyish is a wrapper module for HTTP client modules LWP, HTTP::Tiny
and HTTP client software 'curl' and 'wget'.

It provides an API compatible to HTTP::Tiny, and the implementation has
been extracted out of App::cpanminus. This module can be useful in a
restrictive environment where you need to be able to download CPAN modules
without an HTTPS support in built-in HTTP library.
