  <title>Boolean support for Perl</title>
  <description>Most programming languages have a native 'Boolean' data type. Perl does
not.

Perl has a simple and well known Truth System. The following scalar values
are false:

    $false1 = undef;
    $false2 = 0;
    $false3 = 0.0;
    $false4 = '';
    $false5 = '0';

Every other scalar value is true.

This module provides basic Boolean support, by defining two special
objects: 'true' and 'false'.</description>
