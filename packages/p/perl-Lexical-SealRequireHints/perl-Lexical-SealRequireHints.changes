- updated to 0.012
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Lexical-SealRequireHints/Changes

  version 0.012; 2023-03-10
    * bugfix: comprehensive set of preemptive loads of modules for which
      a delayed load might have been compiled while loading this module
    * bugfix: if AutoLoader was loaded during (or before) loading this
      module, flush its compiled code and reload it, to make subsequent
      autoloads of *.al files not leak hints
    * bugfix: if utf8_heavy.pl was loaded during (or before) loading this
      module, flush its compiled code and reload it, to make subsequent
      loads of Unicode data files not leak hints
    * bugfix: perform preemptive loads, of modules for which a delayed
      load might have been compiled while loading this module, regardless
      of whether XS module loading was successful
    * bugfix: also work around hint leakage affecting do-file, which
      suffers exactly the same problem as require
    * correct thread behaviour: make the XS implementation behave the way
      the pure Perl implementation already did, by not applying workaround
      until it has been requested in a particular thread (including being
      requested pre-cloning in a thread from which this thread was cloned)
    * be more conservative about maintaining op tree structure
    * port to Perl 5.33.1, which defines a PERL_VERSION_GE() macro that
      clashes with the one this module previously had
    * delay the preemptive module loads, of modules potentially subject
      to early-compiled delayed loads, until applying the fix
    * update swash test for Perl 5.27.11, which avoids actually loading
      swashes most of the time
    * skip thread tests on some old versions of Perl (around 5.10.0) where
      a core bug makes thread creation violate an internal assertion and
      causes crashes
    * skip thread tests on pre-5.8.9 Perls where a core bug makes thread
      creation corrupt memory
    * skip thread tests on pre-5.8.3 Perls where a core bug makes thread
      completion break the global PL_sv_placeholder
    * in t/override.t, make the test overrides of require() provide the
      correct context to the file scope of each file being loaded
    * test the point at which the workaround goes into effect
    * in documentation, describe the bug affecting "do" on Perls 5.15.{5..7}
    * in documentation, use four-column indentation for all verbatim
      material
    * in META.{yml,json}, point to public bug tracker
    * use full stricture in the module, now that delayed module loads
      compiled while loading this module are properly handled so there's
      no need to try avoiding them entirely
    * in XS, better argument parenthesisation in a macro
    * avoid some compiler warnings that arise on Perl 5.6
    * fix indentation in the reserve definition of wrap_op_checker()

- updated to 0.011
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Lexical-SealRequireHints/Changes

  version 0.011; 2017-07-15
  
    * update test suite to not rely on . in @INC, which is no longer
      necessarily there from Perl 5.25.7
  
    * no longer include a Makefile.PL in the distribution
  
    * update op-munging code to the PERL_OP_PARENT-compatible style
      (though none of it is actually used on Perls new enough to support
      PERL_OP_PARENT)
  
    * rename internal gen_*_op() functions into a better style
  
    * consistently use THX_ prefix on internal function names

- updated to 0.010
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Lexical-SealRequireHints/Changes

  version 0.010; 2016-03-18
  
    * skip test with lexical $_ on Perl 5.23.4+ where that feature has
      been removed

Mon Apr 13 19:32:52 UTC 2015 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.009
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Lexical-SealRequireHints/Changes

  version 0.009; 2015-03-20
  
    * in test of require for version checking, work around [perl #124135]
      which was introduced in Perl 5.21.4
  
  version 0.008; 2015-03-20
  
    * bugfix: don't localise hints around a version-number require, so that
      "use v5.10.0" can have its intentional effect of setting feature flags
  
    * bugfix: in pure Perl implementation, use a ($) prototype on
      CORE::GLOBAL::require, so that the argument expression will be in
      the correct context
  
    * better error message for refusing to use pure Perl implementation
      on Perl 5.9.4 to 5.10.0
  
    * document that the pure Perl implementation breaks the use of the
      implicit $_ parameter with require
  
    * in swash test, don't fail if utf8.pm was loaded unexpectedly early,
      as has been seen to happen on some systems
  
    * test idempotence
  
    * fix test for thread safety, which risked false negatives
  
    * when preemptively loading Carp and Carp::Heavy, avoid the Perl core
      bug regarding the context applied to file scope of required modules,
      in case of future versions of those modules becoming vulnerable and
      running on an old Perl
  
    * declare correct version for Test::More dependency
  
    * typo fix in documentation
  
    * typo fix in a comment
