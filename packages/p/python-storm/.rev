    <comment>- Update to version 0.20
  + A new CaptureTracer has been added to storm.testing, for capturing all SQL
    statements executed by Storm. It can be used like this:
    with CaptureTracer() as tracer:
      # Run queries
      pass
    print tracer.queries  # Print all queries run in the context manager block

    You will need the python-fixtures package in order to use this feature.
  + Setuptools &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools&gt; is now required
    to run setup.py. This makes it much easier to install the majority
    of the dependencies required to run the test suite in its entirety.
  + Disconnection errors arising from PostgreSQL are now more reliably
    detected, especially with regard to recent libpq updates in Ubuntu.
    There are also disconnection tests that simulate sudden termination
    of pgbouncer &lt;http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgbouncer/&gt;.
  + Insert expressions now support multi-row and subquery INSERT
    statements.
  + Support in the postgres backend to use the RETURNING extension for UPDATE
    statement, optionally specifying the columns to return.
    (PostgreSQL &gt;= 8.2 only)
  + Add a new Distinct expression for pre-pending the 'DISTINCT' token to
    SQL expressions that support it (like columns).
  + Switch to REPEATABLE READ as isolation level for Postgres. If you use
    psycopg2 &lt; 2.4, it doesn't change anything. For psycopg2 2.4 and newer, it
    will keep the same behavior on Postgres &lt; 9 as it's equivalent to
    SERIALIZABLE, but it will be less strict on Postgres &gt;= 9.
  + Add support for two-phase commits, using the DB API version 2.0, which
    is only supported by PostgreSQL.
  + ZStormResourceManager now has a schema_stamp_dir optional instance attribute
    that, if set, will be used to to save timestamps of the schema's patch
    packages, so schema upgrades will be performed only when needed.
  + When a SQLObjectResultSet object was sliced with slice.start and
    slice.end both zero (sqlobject[0:0]), the full, unsliced resultset
    was returned (bug #872086).
  + Fixes some test failures around Django disconnections from
    PostgreSQL stores.
  + Some of the proxy-less disconnection tests were causing segfaults,
    so they're now run in a subprocess via subunit's IsolatedTestCase,
    when it's available.
  + Fix a few non-uses of super() in TestHelper.
  + Abort the transaction and reset ZStorm at the end of
    tests/zope/README.txt.
  + Fix the ./test script to not import tests until after local eggs
    have been added to sys.path. This ensures that all possible features
    are available to the tests.
  + If transaction.commit() fails, call transaction.abort() to rollback
    everything and leave the transaction in a clean state when using Django's
    ZopeTransactionMiddleware and DatabaseWrapper.
  + It's now again possible to use the Desc() expression when passing an
    order_by parameter to a ReferenceSet (bug #620369).

    <comment>Clean up SPEC file and converstion to the single spec (py3k switched
off, though)
Don't package tests/ directory
New patch, storm-0.20-remove-ez_setup.patch ... ez_setup breaks py3k
and it is unnecessary, so I just remove it from setup.py</comment>
