  <title>Utilities for interactive I/O</title>
  <description>This module provides three utility subroutines that make it easier to
develop interactive applications...

* 'is_interactive()'

  This subroutine returns true if '*ARGV' and the currently selected
  filehandle (usually '*STDOUT') are connected to the terminal. The test is
  considerably more sophisticated than:

      -t *ARGV &amp;&amp; -t *STDOUT

  as it takes into account the magic behaviour of '*ARGV'.

  You can also pass 'is_interactive' a writable filehandle, in which case
  it requires that filehandle be connected to a terminal (instead of the
  currently selected). The usual suspect here is '*STDERR':

      if ( is_interactive(*STDERR) ) {
          carp $warning;
      }

* 'interactive()'

  This subroutine returns '*STDOUT' if 'is_interactive' is true. If
  'is_interactive()' is false, 'interactive' returns a filehandle that does
  not print.

  This makes it easy to create applications that print out only when the
  application is interactive:

      print {interactive} &quot;Please enter a value: &quot;;
      my $value = &lt;&gt;;

  You can also pass 'interactive' a writable filehandle, in which case it
  writes to that filehandle if it is connected to a terminal (instead of
  writinbg to '*STDOUT'). Once again, the usual suspect is '*STDERR':

      print {interactive(*STDERR)} $warning;

* 'busy {...}'

  This subroutine takes a block as its single argument and executes that
  block. Whilst the block is executed, '*ARGV' is temporarily replaced by a
  closed filehandle. That is, no input from '*ARGV' is possible in a 'busy'
  block. Furthermore, any attempts to send input into the 'busy' block
  through '*ARGV' is intercepted and a warning message is printed to
  '*STDERR'. The 'busy' call returns a filehandle that contains the
  intercepted input.

  A 'busy' block is therefore useful to prevent attempts at input when the
  program is busy at some non-interactive task.</description>
