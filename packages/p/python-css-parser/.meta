  <description>A fork of the cssutils project based on version 1.0.2. This fork includes general bug fixes and extensions specific to editing and working with ebooks.

The main python source code has been modified so that it will run without further conversion on both Python &gt;= 2.7 and Python 3.X without any further modules required. All required modifications are handled local to each file

For more information on usage, please see the cssutils documentation
