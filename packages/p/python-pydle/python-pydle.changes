- Update to version 0.9.1
  Breaking:
  * pydle.async library removed in its entirety.

    and must be awaited.
  * Minimum Python version increased to 3.5

  Features:
  * Python 3.7 support
  * Added IRCv3.2 account-tag , message-tag echo_message and
    invite-notify support.
  * added IRCv3.3 message-tags support
  * added SASL-External authentication
  * raw irc messages are now logged at level logging.DEBUG

  Fixes:
  * Fixed various reconnection issues
  * Fixed any tornado-related issues by removing the tornado
    from the house.
  * Pydle will once again connect to password-protected servers.
  * Resolve deadlock issues relating to .whois and other blocking
    IRC methods

Fri Jun 29 00:53:04 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update to version 0.8.4

    of pydle will use asyncio instead, hence no effort is being
    made to support newer versions of Tornado.

  * Fix typo where self.channels was using the self.users dict
  * Fix reconnecting
