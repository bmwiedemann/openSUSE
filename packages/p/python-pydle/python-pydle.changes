  enough yet to be applied gh#Shizmob/pydle#180

- Add python-pydle-poetry-syntax.patch: Fix version limiation in
  pyprojects.toml. NOTE: I changed to < 3.11 even though upstream
  declares < 3.10; but since this limiation was simply ignored by
  poetry < 1.2 and we provide already packages for python 3.10
  (which seem to work?) this seemed most suitable workaround for
  now (https://github.com/Shizmob/pydle/issues/181).

- Update to version 0.9.1
  Breaking:

    and must be awaited.
  * Minimum Python version increased to 3.5

  Features:
  * Python 3.7 support
  * Added IRCv3.2 account-tag , message-tag echo_message and
    invite-notify support.
  * added IRCv3.3 message-tags support
  * added SASL-External authentication

  Fixes:
  * Fixed various reconnection issues
  * Fixed any tornado-related issues by removing the tornado
    from the house.
  * Pydle will once again connect to password-protected servers.
  * Resolve deadlock issues relating to .whois and other blocking
    IRC methods
