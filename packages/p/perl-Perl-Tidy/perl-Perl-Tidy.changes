- updated to 20221112
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2022 11 12
      - Fix rt #145095, undef warning in Perl before 5.12. Version 20221112 is
        identical to 2022111 except for this fix for older versions of Perl.
      - No significant bugs have been found since the last release to CPAN.
        Several minor issues have been fixed, and some new parameters have been
        added, as follows:
      - Fixed rare problem with irregular indentation involving --cuddled-else,
        usually also with the combination -xci and -lp.  Reported in rt #144979.
      - Add option --weld-fat-comma (-wfc) for issue git #108. When -wfc
        is set, along with -wn, perltidy is allowed to weld an opening paren
        to an inner opening container when they are separated by a hash key
        and fat comma (=>).  For example:
          # perltidy -wn
          elf->call_method(
              method_name_foo => {
                  some_arg1       => $foo,
                  some_other_arg3 => $bar->{'baz'},
              }
          );
          # perltidy -wn -wfc
          elf->call_method( method_name_foo => {
              some_arg1       => $foo,
              some_other_arg3 => $bar->{'baz'},
          } );
        This flag is off by default.
      - Fix issue git #106. This fixes some edge cases of formatting with the
        combination -xlp -pt=2, mainly for two-line lists with short function
        names. One indentation space is removed to improve alignment:
          # OLD: perltidy -xlp -pt=2
          is($module->VERSION, $expected,
              "$main_module->VERSION matches $module->VERSION ($expected)");
          # NEW: perltidy -xlp -pt=2
          is($module->VERSION, $expected,
             "$main_module->VERSION matches $module->VERSION ($expected)");
      - Fix for issue git #105, incorrect formatting with 5.36 experimental
        for_list feature.
      - Fix for issue git #103. For parameter -b, or --backup-and-modify-in-place,
        the default backup method has been changed to preserve the inode value
        of the file being formatted.  If this causes a problem, the previous
        method is available and can be used by setting -backup-mode='move', or
        -bm='move'.  The new default corresponds to -bm='copy'.  The difference
        between the two methods is as follows.  For the older method,
        -bm='move', the input file was moved to the backup, and a new file was
        created for the formatted output.  This caused the inode to change.  For
        the new default method, -bm='copy', the input is copied to the backup
        and then the input file is reopened and rewritten. This preserves the
        file inode.  Tests have not produced any problems with this change, but
        before using the --backup-and-modify-in-place parameter please verify
        that it works correctly in your environment and operating system. The
        initial update for this had an error which was caught and fixed
        in git #109.
      - Fix undefined value message when perltidy -D is used (git #104)
      - Fixed an inconsistency in html colors near pointers when -html is used.
        Previously, a '->' at the end of a line got the 'punctuation color', black
        by default but a '->' before an identifier got the color of the following
        identifier. Now all pointers get the same color, which is black by default.
        Also, previously a word following a '->' was given the color of a bareword,
        black by default, but now it is given the color of an identifier.
      - Fixed incorrect indentation of any function named 'err'.  This was
        due to some old code from when "use feature 'err'" was valid.
              # OLD:
              my ($curr) = current();
                err (@_);
              # NEW:
              my ($curr) = current();
              err(@_);
      - Added parameter --delete-repeated-commas (-drc) to delete repeated
        commas. This is off by default. For example, given:
              ignoreSpec( $file, "file",, \%spec, \%Rspec );
        # perltidy -drc:
              ignoreSpec( $file, "file", \%spec, \%Rspec );
      - Add continuation indentation to long C-style 'for' terms; i.e.
              # OLD
              for (
                  $j = $i - $shell ;
                  $j >= 0
                  && ++$ncomp
                  && $array->[$j] gt $array->[ $j + $shell ] ;
                  $j -= $shell
                )
              # NEW
              for (
                  $j = $i - $shell ;
                  $j >= 0
                    && ++$ncomp
                    && $array->[$j] gt $array->[ $j + $shell ] ;
                  $j -= $shell
                )
        This will change some existing formatting with very long 'for' terms.
      - The following new parameters are available for manipulating
        trailing commas of lists. They are described in the manual.
             --want-trailing-commas=s, -wtc=s
             --add-trailing-commas,    -atc
             --delete-trailing-commas, -dtc
             --delete-weld-interfering-commas, -dwic
      - Files with errors due to missing, extra or misplaced parens, braces,
        or square brackets are now written back out verbatim, without any
        attempt at formatting.
      - This version runs 10 to 15 percent faster than the previous
        release on large files due to optimizations made with the help of
        Devel::NYTProf.
      - This version was stress-tested for over 200 cpu hours with random
        input parameters. No failures to converge, internal fault checks,
        undefined variable references or other irregularities were seen.

- updated to 20220613
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2022 06 13
      - No significant bugs have been found since the last release but users
        of programs which call the Perl::Tidy module should note the first
        item below, which changes a default setting.  The main change to
        existing formatting is the second item below, which adds vertical
        alignment to 'use' statements.
      - The flag --encode-output-strings, or -eos, is now set 'on' by default.
        This has no effect on the use of the 'perltidy' binary script, but could
        change the behavior of some programs which use the Perl::Tidy module on
        files encoded in UTF-8.  If any problems are noticed, an emergency fix
        can be made by reverting to the old default by setting -neos.  For
        an explanation of why this change needs to be made see:
        https://github.com/perltidy/perltidy/issues/92
        https://github.com/perltidy/perltidy/blob/master/docs/eos_flag.md
      - Added vertical alignment for qw quotes and empty parens in 'use'
        statements (see issue #git 93).  This new alignment is 'on' by default
        and will change formatting as shown below. If this is not wanted it can
        be turned off with the parameter -vxl='q' (--valign-exclude-list='q').
          # old default, or -vxl='q'
          use Getopt::Long qw(GetOptions);
          use Fcntl qw(O_RDONLY O_WRONLY O_EXCL O_CREAT);
          use Symbol qw(gensym);
          use Exporter ();
          # new default
          use Getopt::Long qw(GetOptions);
          use Fcntl        qw(O_RDONLY O_WRONLY O_EXCL O_CREAT);
          use Symbol       qw(gensym);
          use Exporter     ();
      - The parameter -kbb (--keep-break-before) now ignores a request to break
        before an opening token, such as '('.  Likewise, -kba (--keep-break-after)
        now ignores a request to break after a closing token, such as ')'. This
        change was made to avoid a rare instability discovered in random testing.
      - Previously, if a -dsc command was used to delete all side comments,
        then any special side comments for controlling non-indenting braces got
        deleted too. Now, these control side comments are retained when -dsc is
        set unless a -nnib (--nonon-indenting-braces) flag is also set to
        deactivate them.
      - This version runs about 10 percent faster on large files than the previous
        release due to optimizations made with the help of Devel::NYTProf.  Much
        of the gain came from faster processing of blank tokens and comments.
      - This version of perltidy was stress-tested for many cpu hours with
        random input parameters. No failures to converge, internal fault checks,
        undefined variable references or other irregularities were seen.

Wed Feb 16 03:07:20 UTC 2022 - Tina Müller <timueller+perl@suse.de>

- updated to 20220217
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2022 02 17
      - A new flag, --encode-output-strings, or -eos, has been added to resolve
        issue git #83. This issue involves the interface between Perl::Tidy and
        calling programs, and Code::TidyAll (tidyall) in particular.  The problem
        is that perltidy by default returns decoded character strings, but
        tidyall expects encoded strings.  This flag provides a fix for that.
        So, tidyall users who process encoded (utf8) files should update to this
        version of Perl::Tidy and use -eos for tidyall.  For further info see:
        https://github.com/houseabsolute/perl-code-tidyall/issues/84, and
        https://github.com/perltidy/perltidy/issues/83
        If there are other applications having utf8 problems at the interface
        with Perl::Tidy, this flag probably may need to be set.
      - The default value of the new flag, --encode-output-strings, -eos, is currently
        -neos BUT THIS MAY CHANGE in a future release because the current
        default is inconvenient.  So authors of programs which receive character
        strings back from Perl::Tidy should set this flag, if necessary,
        to avoid any problems when the default changes.  For more information see the
        above links and the Perl::Tidy man pages for example coding.
      - The possible values of the string 's' for the flag '--character-encoding=s'
        have been limited to 'utf8' (or UTF-8), 'none', or 'guess'.  Previously an
        arbitrary encoding could also be specified, but as a result of discussions
        regarding git #83 it became clear that this could cause trouble
        since the output encoding was still restricted to UTF-8. Users
        who need to work in other encodings can write a short program calling
        Perl::Tidy with pre- and post-processing to handle encoding/decoding.
      - A new flag --break-after-labels=i, or -bal=i, was added for git #86.  This
        controls line breaks after labels, to provide a uniform style, as follows:
              -bal=0 follows the input line breaks [DEFAULT]
              -bal=1 always break after a label
              -bal=2 never break after a label
        For example:
            # perltidy -bal=1
            INIT:
              {
                  $xx = 1.234;
              }
            # perltidy -bal=2
            INIT: {
                  $xx = 1.234;
              }
      - Fix issue git #82, an error handling something like ${bareword} in a
        possible indirect object location. Perl allows this, now perltidy does too.
      - The flags -kbb=s or --keep-old-breakpoints-before=s, and its counterpart
        -kba=s or --keep-old-breakpoints-after=s have expanded functionality
        for the container tokens: { [ ( } ] ).  The updated man pages have
        details.
      - Two new flags have been added to provide finer vertical alignment control,
        --valign-exclusion-list=s (-vxl=s) and  --valign-inclusion-list=s (-vil=s).
        This has been requested several times, most recently in git #79, and it
        finally got done.  For example, -vil='=>' means just align on '=>'.
      - A new flag -gal=s, --grep-alias-list=s, has been added as suggested in
        git #77.  This allows code blocks passed to list operator functions to
        be formatted in the same way as a code block passed to grep, map, or sort.
        By default, the following list operators in List::Util are included:
          all any first none notall reduce reductions
        They can be changed with the flag -gaxl=s, -grep-alias-exclusion-list=s
      - A new flag -xlp has been added which can be set to avoid most of the
        limitations of the -lp flag regarding side comments, blank lines, and
        code blocks.  See the man pages for more info. This fixes git #64 and git #74.
        The older -lp flag still works.
      - A new flag -lpil=s, --line-up-parentheses-inclusion-list=s, has been added
        as an alternative to -lpxl=s, --line-up-parentheses-exclusion-list=s.
        It supplies equivalent information but is much easier to describe and use.
        It works for both the older -lp version and the newer -xlp.
      - The coding for the older -lp flag has been updated to avoid some problems
        and limitations.  The new coding allows the -lp indentation style to
        mix smoothly with the standard indentation in a single file.  Some problems
        where -lp and -xci flags were not working well together have been fixed, such
        as happened in issue rt140025.  As a result of these updates some minor
        changes in existing code using the -lp style may occur.
      - This version of perltidy was stress-tested for many cpu hours with
        random input parameters. No failures to converge, internal fault checks,
        undefined variable references or other irregularities were seen.
      - Numerous minor fixes have been made, mostly very rare formatting
        instabilities found in random testing.

- updated to 20211029
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2021 10 29
      - No significant bugs have been found since the last release, but several
        minor issues have been fixed.  Vertical alignment has been improved for
        lists of call args which are not contained within parens (next item).
      - Vertical alignment of function calls without parens has been improved with
        the goal of making vertical alignment essentially the same with or
        without parens around the call args.  Some examples:
          # OLD
          mkTextConfig $c, $x, $y, -anchor => 'se', $color;
          mkTextConfig $c, $x + 30, $y, -anchor => 's',  $color;
          mkTextConfig $c, $x + 60, $y, -anchor => 'sw', $color;
          mkTextConfig $c, $x, $y + 30, -anchor => 'e', $color;
          # NEW
          mkTextConfig $c, $x,      $y,      -anchor => 'se', $color;
          mkTextConfig $c, $x + 30, $y,      -anchor => 's',  $color;
          mkTextConfig $c, $x + 60, $y,      -anchor => 'sw', $color;
          mkTextConfig $c, $x,      $y + 30, -anchor => 'e',  $color;
          # OLD
          is id_2obj($id), undef, "unregistered object not retrieved";
          is scalar keys %$ob_reg, 0, "object registry empty";
          is register($obj), $obj, "object returned by register";
          is scalar keys %$ob_reg, 1, "object registry nonempty";
          is id_2obj($id), $obj, "registered object retrieved";
          # NEW
          is id_2obj($id),         undef, "unregistered object not retrieved";
          is scalar keys %$ob_reg, 0,     "object registry empty";
          is register($obj),       $obj,  "object returned by register";
          is scalar keys %$ob_reg, 1,     "object registry nonempty";
          is id_2obj($id),         $obj,  "registered object retrieved";
        This will cause some changes in alignment, hopefully for the better,
        particularly in test code which often uses numerous parenless function
        calls with functions like 'ok', 'is', 'is_deeply', ....
      - Two new parameters were added to control the block types to which the
        -bl (--opening-brace-on-new-line) flag applies.  The new parameters are
        -block-left-list=s, or -bll=s, and --block-left-exclusion-list=s,
        or -blxl=s.  Previously the -bl flag was 'hardwired' to apply to
        nearly all blocks. The default values of the new parameters
        retain the the old default behavior but allow it to be changed.
      - The default behavior of the -bli (-brace-left-and-indent) flag has changed
        slightly.  Previously, if you set -bli, then the -bl flag would also
        automatically be set.  Consequently, block types which were not included
        in the default list for -bli would get -bl formatting.  This is no longer done,
        and these two styles are now controlled independently.  The manual describes
        the controls.  If you want to recover the exact previous default behavior of
        the -bli then add the -bl flag.
      - A partial fix was made for issue for git #74. The -lp formatting style was
        being lost when a one-line anonymous sub was followed by a closing brace.
      - Fixed issue git #73, in which the -nfpva flag was not working correctly.
        Some unwanted vertical alignments of spaced function perens
        were being made.
      - Updated the man pages to clarify the flags -valign and -novalign
        for turning vertical alignment on and off (issue git #72).
        Added parameters -vc -vsc -vbc for separately turning off vertical
        alignment of code, side comments and block comments.
      - Fixed issue git #68, where a blank line following a closing code-skipping
        comment, '#>>V', could be lost.
      - This version runs 10 to 15 percent faster on large files than the
        previous release due to optimizations made with the help of NYTProf.
      - This version of perltidy was stress-tested for many cpu hours with
        random input parameters. No instabilities,  internal fault checks,
        undefined variable references or other irregularities were seen.
      - Numerous minor fixes have been made, mostly very rare formatting instabilities
        found in random testing. An effort has been made to minimize changes to
        existing formatting that these fixes produce, but occasional changes
        may occur. Many of these updates are listed at:

- updated to 20210717
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2021 07 17
      - This release is being made mainly because of the next item, in which an
        error message about an uninitialized value error message could be produced
        in certain cases when format-skipping is used.  The error message was
        annoying but harmless to formatting.
      - Fixed an undefined variable message, see git #67. When a format skipping
        comment '#<<' is placed before the first line of code in a script, a
        message 'Use of uninitialized value $Ktoken_vars in numeric ...' can
        occur.
      - A warning will no longer be given if a script has an opening code-skipping
        comment '#<<V' which is not terminated with a closing comment '#>>V'. This
        makes code-skipping and format-skipping behave in a similar way: an
        opening comment without a corresponding closing comment will cause
        the rest of a file to be skipped.  If there is a question about which lines
        are skipped, a .LOG file can be produced with the -g flag and it will have
        this information.
      - Removed the limit on -ci=n when -xci is set, reference: rt #136415.
        This update removes a limit in the previous two versions in which the
        value of -ci=n was limited to the value of -i=n when -xci was set.
        This limit had been placed to avoid some formatting instabilities,
        but recent coding improvements allow the limit to be removed.
      - The -wn and -bbxx=n flags were not working together correctly. This has
        been fixed.
      - This version may produce occasional differences in formatting compared to
        previous versions, mainly for lines which are near the specified line
        length limit.  This is due to ongoing efforts to eliminate edge cases of
        formatting instability.
      - Numerous minor fixes have been made. A complete list is at:
             https://github.com/perltidy/perltidy/blob/master/local-docs/BugLog.pod

- updated to 20210625
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2021 06 25
      - This release adds several new requested parameters.  No significant bugs have
        been found since the last release, but a number of minor problems have been
        corrected.
      - Added a new option '--code-skipping', requested in git #65, in which code
        between comment lines '#<<V' and '#>>V' is passed verbatim to the output
        stream without error checking.  It is simmilar to --format-skipping
        but there is no error checking of the skipped code. This can be useful for
        skipping past code which employs an extended syntax.
      - Added a new option for closing paren placement, -vtc=3, requested in rt #136417.
      - Added flag -atnl, --add-terminal-newline, to help issue git #58.
        This flag tells perltidy to terminate the last line of the output stream
        with a newline character, regardless of whether or not the input stream
        was terminated with a newline character.  This is the default.
        If this flag is negated, with -natnl, then perltidy will add a terminal
        newline character to the the output stream only if the input
        stream is terminated with a newline.
      - Some nested structures formatted with the -lp indentation option may have
        some changes in indentation.  This is due to updates which were made to
        prevent formatting instability when line lengths are limited by the maximum line
        length. Most scripts will not be affected. If this causes unwanted formatting
        changes, try increasing the --maximum-line-length by a few characters.
      - Numerous minor fixes have been made. A complete list is at:

  ## 2021 04 02
      - This release fixes several non-critical bugs which have been found since the last
      release.  An effort has been made to keep existing formatting unchanged.
      - Fixed issue git #57 regarding uninitialized warning flag.
      - Added experimental flag -lpxl=s requested in issue git #56 to provide some
      control over which containers get -lp indentation.
      - Fixed issue git #55 regarding lack of coordination of the --break-before-xxx
      flags and the --line-up-parens flag.
      - Fixed issue git #54 regarding irregular application of the --break-before-paren
      and similar --break-before-xxx flags, in which lists without commas were not
      being formatted according to these flags.
      - Fixed issue git #53. A flag was added to turn off alignment of spaced function
      parens.  If the --space-function-paren, -sfp flag is set, a side-effect is that the
      spaced function parens may get vertically aligned.  This can be undesirable,
      so a new parameter '--function-paren-vertical-alignment', or '-fpva', has been
      added to turn this vertical alignment off. The default is '-fpva', so that
      existing formatting is not changed.  Use '-nfpva' to turn off unwanted
      vertical alignment.  To illustrate the possibilities:
          # perltidy [default]
          myfun( $aaa, $b, $cc );
          mylongfun( $a, $b, $c );
          # perltidy -sfp
          myfun     ( $aaa, $b, $cc );
          mylongfun ( $a, $b, $c );
          # perltidy -sfp -nfpva
          myfun ( $aaa, $b, $cc );
          mylongfun ( $a, $b, $c );
      - Fixed issue git #51, a closing qw bare paren was not being outdented when
      the -nodelete-old-newlines flag was set.
      - Fixed numerous edge cases involving unusual parameter combinations which
        could cause alternating output states.  Most scripts will not be
        changed by these fixes.

- updated to 20210111
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2021 01 11
      - Fixed issue git #49, -se breaks warnings exit status behavior.
      The exit status flag was not always being set when the -se flag was set.
      - Some improvements have been made in the method for aligning side comments.
      One of the problems that was fixed is that there was a tendency for side comment
      placement to drift to the right in long scripts.  Programs with side comments
      may have a few changes.
      - Some improvements have been made in formatting qw quoted lists.  This
      fixes issue git #51, in which closing qw pattern delimiters not always
      following the settings specified by the --closing-token-indentation=n settings.
      Now qw closing delimiters ')', '}' and ']' follow these flags, and the
      delimiter '>' follows the flag for ')'.  Other qw pattern delimiters remain
      indented as the are now.  This change will cause some small formatting changes
      in some existing programs.
      - Another change involving qw lists is that they get full indentation,
      rather than just continuation indentation, if
           (1) the closing delimiter is one of } ) ] > and is on a separate line,
           (2) the opening delimiter  (i.e. 'qw{' ) is also on a separate line, and
           (3) the -xci flag (--extended-continuation-indentation) is set.
      This improves formatting when qw lists are contained in other lists. For example,
              # OLD: perltidy
              foreach $color (
                  qw(
                  AntiqueWhite3 Bisque1 Bisque2 Bisque3 Bisque4
                  SlateBlue3 RoyalBlue1 SteelBlue2 DeepSkyBlue3
                  ),
                  qw(
                  LightBlue1 DarkSlateGray1 Aquamarine2 DarkSeaGreen2
                  SeaGreen1 Yellow1 IndianRed1 IndianRed2 Tan1 Tan4
                  )
                )
              # NEW, perltidy -xci
              foreach $color (
                  qw(
                      AntiqueWhite3 Bisque1 Bisque2 Bisque3 Bisque4
                      SlateBlue3 RoyalBlue1 SteelBlue2 DeepSkyBlue3
                  ),
                  qw(
                      LightBlue1 DarkSlateGray1 Aquamarine2 DarkSeaGreen2
                      SeaGreen1 Yellow1 IndianRed1 IndianRed2 Tan1 Tan4
                  )
                )
      - Some minor improvements have been made to the rules for formatting
      some edge vertical alignment cases, usually involving two dissimilar lines.

Thu Dec  3 03:07:54 UTC 2020 - Tina Müller <timueller+perl@suse.de>

- updated to 20201202
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2020 12 02
      - This release is being made primarily to make available a several new formatting
        parameters, in particular -xci, -kbb=s, -kba=s, and -wnxl=s. No significant
        bugs have been found since the previous release, but numerous minor issues have
        been found and fixed as listed below.
      - This version is about 20% faster than the previous version due to optimizations
        made with the help of Devel::NYTProf.
      - Added flag -wnxl=s, --weld-nested-exclusion-list=s, to provide control which containers
        are welded with the --weld-nested-containers parameter.  This is related to issue git #45.
      - Merged pull request git #46 which fixes the docs regarding the -fse flag.
      - Fixed issue git #45, -vtc=n flag was ignored when -wn was set.
      - implement request RT #133649, delete-old-newlines selectively. Two parameters,
        -kbb=s or --keep-old-breakpoints-before=s, and
        -kba=s or --keep-old-breakpoints-after=s
        were added to request that old breakpoints be kept before or after
        selected token types.  For example, -kbb='=>' means that newlines before
        fat commas should be kept.
      - Fix git #44, fix exit status for assert-tidy/untidy.  The exit status was
        always 0 for --assert-tidy if the user had turned off all error messages with
        the -quiet flag.  This has been fixed.
      - Add flag -maxfs=n, --maximum-file-size-mb=n.  This parameter is provided to
        avoid causing system problems by accidentally attempting to format an
        extremely large data file. The default is n=10.  The command to increase
        the limit to 20 MB for example would be  -mfs=20.  This only applies to
        files specified by filename on the command line.
      - Skip formatting if there are too many indentation level errors.  This is
        controlled with -maxle=n, --maximum-level-errors=n.  This means that if
        the ending indentation differs from the starting indentation by more than
        n levels, the file will be output verbatim. The default is n=1.
        To skip this check, set n=-1 or set n to a large number.
      - A related new flag, --maximum-unexpected-errors=n, or -maxue=n, is available
        but is off by default.
      - Add flag -xci, --extended-continuation-indentation, regarding issue git #28
        This flag causes continuation indentation to "extend" deeper into structures.
        Since this is a fairly new flag, the default is -nxci to avoid disturbing
        existing formatting.  BUT you will probably see some improved formatting
        in complex data structures by setting this flag if you currently use -ci=n
        and -i=n with the same value of 'n' (as is the case if you use -pbp,
        --perl-best-practices, where n=4).
      - Fix issue git #42, clarify how --break-at-old-logical-breakpoints works.
        The man page was updated to note that it does not cause all logical breakpoints
        to be replicated in the output file.
      - Fix issue git #41, typo in manual regarding -fsb.
      - Fix issue git #40: when using the -bli option, a closing brace followed by
        a semicolon was not being indented.  This applies to braces which require
        semicolons, such as a 'do' block.
      - Added 'state' as a keyword.
      - A better test for convergence has been added. When iterations are requested,
        the new test will stop after the first pass if no changes in line break
        locations are made.  Previously, file checksums were used and required at least two
        passes to verify convergence unless no formatting changes were made.  With the new test,
        only a single pass is needed when formatting changes are limited to adjustments of
        indentation and whitespace on the lines of code.  Extensive testing has been made to
        verify the correctness of the new convergence test.
      - Line breaks are now automatically placed after 'use overload' to
        improve formatting when there are numerous overloaded operators.  For
        example
          use overload
            '+' => sub {
            ...
      - A number of minor problems with parsing signatures and prototypes have
        been corrected, particularly multi-line signatures. Some signatures
        had previously been parsed as if they were prototypes, which meant the
        normal spacing rules were not applied.  For example
        OLD:
          sub echo ($message= 'Hello World!' ) {
              ...;
          }
        NEW:
          sub echo ( $message = 'Hello World!' ) {
              ...;
          }
      - Numerous minor issues that the average user would not encounter were found
        and fixed. They can be seen in the more complete list of updates at

- updated to 20201001
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2020 10 01
      - Robustness of perltidy has been significantly improved.  Updating is recommended. Continual
        automated testing runs began about 1 Sep 2020 and numerous issues have been found and fixed.
        Many involve references to uninitialized variables when perltidy is fed random text and random
        control parameters. A complete list is given in the file
             https://github.com/perltidy/perltidy/blob/master/local-docs/BugLog.pod
      - Added the token '->' to the list of alignment tokens, as suggested in git
        #39, so that it can be vertically aligned if a space is placed before them with -wls='->'.
      - Added parameters -bbhb=n (--break-before-hash-brace=n), -bbsb=n (--break-before-square-bracket=n),
        and -bbp=n (--break-before-paren=n) suggested in git #38.  These provide control over the
        opening container token of a multiple-line list.  Related new parameters -bbhbi=n, -bbsbi=n, -bbpi=n
        control indentation of these tokens.
      - Added keyword 'isa'.

  ## 2020 09 07
      - Fixed bug git #37, an error when the combination -scbb -csc was used.
        It occurs in perltidy versions 20200110, 20200619, and 20200822.  What happens is
        that when two consecutive lines with isolated closing braces had new side
        comments generated by the -csc parameter, a separating newline was missing.
        The resulting script will not then run, but worse, if it is reformatted with
        the same parameters then closing side comments could be overwritten and data
        lost.
        This problem was found during automated random testing.  The parameter
        -scbb is rarely used, which is probably why this has not been reported.  Please
        upgrade your version.
      - Added parameter --non-indenting-braces, or -nib, which prevents
        code from indenting one level if it follows an opening brace marked
        with a special side comment, '#<<<'.  For example,
                      { #<<<   a closure to contain lexical vars
                      my $var;  # this line does not indent
                      }
                      # this line cannot 'see' $var;
        This is on by default.  If your code happens to have some
        opening braces followed by '#<<<', and you
        don't want this, you can use -nnib to deactivate it.
      - Side comment locations reset at a line ending in a level 0 open
        block, such as when a new multi-line sub begins.  This is intended to
        help keep side comments from drifting to far to the right.

  ## 2020 08 22
      - Fix RT #133166, encoding not set for -st.  Also reported as RT #133171
        and git #35.
        This is a significant bug in version 20200616 which can corrupt data if
        perltidy is run as a filter on encoded text.
  **Please upgrade**
      - Fix issue RT #133161, perltidy -html was not working on pod
      - Fix issue git #33, allow control of space after '->'
      - Vertical alignment has been improved. Numerous minor issues have
        been fixed.
      - Formatting with the -lp option is improved.
      - Fixed issue git #32, misparse of bare 'ref' in ternary
      - When --assert-tidy is used and triggers an error, the first difference
        between input and output files is shown in the error output. This is
        a partial response to issue git #30.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 20 03:10:23 UTC 2020 - Tina Müller <timueller+perl@suse.de>

- updated to 20200619
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2020 06 19
      - Added support for Switch::Plain syntax, issue git #31.
      - Fixed minor problem where trailing 'unless' clauses were not
        getting vertically aligned.
      - Added a parameter --logical-padding or -lop to allow logical padding
        to be turned off.  Requested by git #29. This flag is on by default.
        The man pages have examples.
      - Added a parameter -kpit=n to control spaces inside of parens following
        certain keywords, requested in git#26. This flag is off by default.
      - Added fix for git#25, improve vertical alignment for long lists with
        varying numbers of items per line.
      - calls to the module Perl::Tidy can now capture any output produced
        by a debug flag or one of the 'tee' flags through the new 'debugfile' and
        'teefile' call parameters.  These output streams are rarely used but
        they are now treated the same as any 'logfile' stream.
      - add option --break-at-old-semicolon-breakpoints', -bos, requested
        in RT#131644.  This flag will keep lines beginning with a semicolon.
      - Added --use-unicode-gcstring to control use of Unicode::GCString for
        evaluating character widths of encoded data.  The default is
        not to use this (--nouse-unicode-gcstring). If this flag is set,
        perltidy will look for Unicode::GCString and, if found, will use it
        to evaluate character display widths.  This can improve displayed
        vertical alignment for files with wide characters.  It is a nice
        feature but it is off by default to avoid conflicting formatting
        when there are multiple developers.  Perltidy installation does not
        require Unicode::GCString, so users wanting to use this feature need
        set this flag and also to install Unicode::GCString separately.
      - Added --character-encoding=guess or -guess to have perltidy guess
        if a file (or other input stream) is encoded as -utf8 or some
        other single-byte encoding. This is useful when processing a mixture
        of file types, such as utf8 and latin-1.
        Please Note: The default encoding has been set to be 'guess'
        instead of 'none'. This seems like the best default, since
        it allows perltidy work properly with both
        utf8 files and older latin-1 files.  The guess mode uses Encode::Guess,
        which is included in standard perl distributions, and only tries to
        guess if a file is utf8 or not, never any other encoding.  If the guess is
        utf8, and if the file successfully decodes as utf8, then it the encoding
        is assumed to be utf8.  Otherwise, no encoding is assumed.
        If you do not want to use this new default guess mode, or have a
        problem with it, you can set --character-encoding=none (the previous
        default) or --character-encoding=utf8 (if you deal with utf8 files).
      - Specific encodings of input files other than utf8 may now be given, for
        example --character-encoding=euc-jp.
      - Fix for git#22, Preserve function signature on a single line. An
        unwanted line break was being introduced when a closing signature paren
        followed a closing do brace.
      - Fix RT#132059, the -dac parameter was not working and caused an error exit
      - When -utf8 is used, any error output is encoded as utf8
      - Fix for git#19, adjust line break around an 'xor'
      - Fix for git#18, added warning for missing comma before unknown bare word.

  ## 2020 01 10
  
      - This release adds a flag to control the feature RT#130394 (allow short nested blocks)
        introduced in the previous release.  Unfortunately that feature breaks 
        RPerl installations, so a control flag has been introduced and that feature is now
        off by default.  The flag is:
  
        --one-line-block-nesting=n, or -olbn=n, where n is an integer as follows: 
  
        -olbn=0 break nested one-line blocks into multiple lines [new DEFAULT]
        -olbn=1 stable; keep existing nested-one line blocks intact [previous DEFAULT]
  
        For example, consider this input line:
  
          foreach (@list) { if ($_ eq $asked_for) { last } ++$found }
  
        The new default behavior (-olbn=0), and behavior prior to version 20191203, is to break it into multiple lines:
  
          foreach (@list) {
              if ( $_ eq $asked_for ) { last }
              ++$found;
          }
  
        To keep nested one-line blocks such as this on a single line you can add the parameter -olbn=1.
  
      - Fixed issue RT#131288: parse error for un-prototyped constant function without parenthesized
        call parameters followed by ternary.
  
      - Fixed issue RT#131360, installation documentation.  Added a note that the binary 
        'perltidy' comes with the Perl::Tidy module. They can both normally be installed with 
        'cpanm Perl::Tidy'

  ## 2019 12 03
  
      - Fixed issue RT#131115: -bli option not working correctly.
        Closing braces were not indented in some cases due to a glitch
        introduced in version 20181120.
  
      - Fixed issue RT#130394: Allow short nested blocks.  Given the following
  
          $factorial = sub { reduce { $a * $b } 1 .. 11 };
     
        Previous versions would always break the sub block because it
        contains another block (the reduce block).  The fix keeps
        short one-line blocks such as this intact.
  
      - Implement issue RT#130640: Allow different subroutine keywords.
        Added a flag --sub-alias-list=s or -sal=s, where s is a string with
        one or more aliases for 'sub', separated by spaces or commas.
        For example,
  
          perltidy -sal='method fun' 
  
        will cause the perltidy to treat the words 'method' and 'fun' to be
        treated the same as if they were 'sub'.
  
      - Added flag --space-prototype-paren=i, or -spp=i, to control spacing 
        before the opening paren of a prototype, where i=0, 1, or 2:
        i=0 no space
        i=1 follow input [current and default]
        i=2 always space
  
        Previously, perltidy always followed the input.
        For example, given the following input 
  
           sub usage();
  
        The result will be:
          sub usage();    # i=0 [no space]
          sub usage();    # i=1 [default; follows input]
          sub usage ();   # i=2 [space]
  
      - Fixed issue git#16, minor vertical alignment issue.
  
      - Fixed issue git#10, minor conflict of -wn and -ce
  
      - Improved some vertical alignments involving two lines.

  ## 2019 09 15
  
      - fixed issue RT#130344: false warning "operator in print statement" 
        for "use lib". 
  
      - fixed issue RT#130304: standard error output should include filename.
        When perltidy error messages are directed to the standard error output 
        with -se or --standard-error-output, the message lines now have a prefix 
        'filename:' for clarification in case multiple files 
        are processed, where 'filename' is the name of the input file.  If 
        input is from the standard input the displayed filename is '<stdin>', 
        and if it is from a data structure then displayed filename 
        is '<source_stream>'.
  
      - implement issue RT#130425: check mode.  A new flag '--assert-tidy'
        will cause an error message if the output script is not identical to
        the input script. For completeness, the opposite flag '--assert-untidy'
        has also been added.  The next item, RT#130297, insures that the script
        will exit with a non-zero exit flag if the assertion fails.
  
      - fixed issue RT#130297; the perltidy script now exits with a nonzero exit 
        status if it wrote to the standard error output. Prevously only fatal
        run errors produced a non-zero exit flag. Now, even non-fatal messages
        requested with the -w flag will cause a non-zero exit flag.  The exit
        flag now has these values:
  
           0 = no errors
           1 = perltidy could not run to completion due to errors
           2 = perltidy ran to completion with error messages
  
      - added warning message for RT#130008, which warns of conflicting input
        parameters -iob and -bom or -boc.
  
      - fixed RT#129850; concerning a space between a closing block brace and
        opening bracket or brace, as occurs before the '[' in this line:
  
         my @addunix = map { File::Spec::Unix->catfile( @ROOT, @$_ ) } ['b'];
  
        Formerly, any space was removed. Now it is optional, and the output will
        follow the input.
  
      - fixed issue git#13, needless trailing whitespace in error message
  
      - fixed issue git#9: if the -ce (--cuddled-else) flag is used,
        do not try to form new one line blocks for a block type 
        specified with -cbl, particularly map, sort, grep
  
      - iteration speedup for unchanged code.  Previously, when iterations were
        requested, at least two formatting passes were made. Now just a single pass
        is made if the formatted code is identical to the input code.
  
      - some improved vertical alignments

  ## 2019 06 01
  
      - rt #128477: Prevent inconsistent owner/group and setuid/setgid bits. 
        In the -b (--backup-and-modify-in-place) mode, an attempt is made to set ownership
        of the output file equal to the input file, if they differ.
        In all cases, if the final output file ownership differs from input file, any setuid/setgid bits are cleared.
  
      - Added option -bom  (--break-at-old-method-breakpoints) by
        merrillymeredith which preserves breakpoints of method chains. Modified to also handle a cuddled call style.
  
      - Merged patch to fix Windows EOL translation error with UTF-8 written by
        Ron Ivy. This update prevents automatic conversion to 'DOS' CRLF line
        endings.  Also, Windows system testing at the appveyor site is working again.
  
      - RT #128280, added flag --one-line-block-semicolons=n (-olbs=n) 
        to control semicolons in one-line blocks.  The values of n are:
          n=0 means no semicolons termininating simple one-line blocks
          n=1 means stable; do not change from input file [DEFAULT and current]
          n=2 means always add semicolons in one-line blocks
        The current behavior corresponds to the default n=1.
  
      - RT #128216, Minor update to prevent inserting unwanted blank line at
        indentation level change.  This should not change existing scripts.
  
      - RT #81852: Improved indentation when quoted word (qw) lists are 
        nested within other containers using the --weld-nested (-wn) flag.
        The example given previously (below) is now closer to what it would
        be with a simple list instead of qw:
  
        # perltidy -wn
        use_all_ok( qw{
            PPI
            PPI::Tokenizer
            PPI::Lexer
            PPI::Dumper
            PPI::Find
            PPI::Normal
            PPI::Util
            PPI::Cache
        } );
  
      - RT#12764, introduced new feature allowing placement of blanks around
        sequences of selected keywords. This can be activated with the -kgb* 
        series of parameters described in the manual.
  
      - Rewrote vertical algnment module.  It is better at finding
        patterns in complex code. For example,
  
  	OLD:
             /^-std$/ && do { $std       = 1;     next; };
             /^--$/   && do { @link_args = @argv; last; };
             /^-I(.*)/ && do { $path = $1 || shift @argv; next; };
  
  	NEW:
             /^-std$/  && do { $std       = 1;                 next; };
             /^--$/    && do { @link_args = @argv;             last; };
             /^-I(.*)/ && do { $path      = $1 || shift @argv; next; };
  
      - Add repository URLs to META files 
  
      - RT #118553, "leave only one newline at end of file". This option was not 
        added because of undesirable side effects, but a new filter script
        was added which can do this, "examples/delete_ending_blank_lines.pl".

        - RT #124469, #124494, perltidy often making empty files.  The previous had
          an index error causing it to fail, particularly in version 5.18 of Perl.

    2018 02 19
        - RT #79947, cuddled-else generalization. A new flag -cb provides
          'cuddled-else' type formatting for an arbitrary type of block chain. The
          default is try-catch-finally, but this can be modified with the 
          parameter -cbl. 
  
        - Fixed RT #124298: add space after ! operator without breaking !! secret 
          operator
  
        - RT #123749: numerous minor improvements to the -wn flag were made.  
  
        - Fixed a problem with convergence tests in which iterations were stopping 
          prematurely. 
  
        - Here doc targets for <<~ type here-docs may now have leading whitespace.
  
        - Fixed RT #124354. The '-indent-only' flag was not working correctly in the 
          previous release. A bug in version 20180101 caused extra blank lines 
          to be output.
  
        - Issue RT #124114. Some improvements were made in vertical alignment
          involving 'fat commas'.

   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES

    2018 01 01
        - Added new flag -wn (--weld-nested-containers) which addresses these issues:
          RT #123749: Problem with promises; 
          RT #119970: opening token stacking strange behavior;
          RT #81853: Can't stack block braces
  
          This option causes closely nested pairs of opening and closing containers
          to be "welded" together and essentially be formatted as a single unit,
          with just one level of indentation.
  
          Since this is a new flag it is set to be "off" by default but it has given 
          excellent results in testing. 
  
          EXAMPLE 1, multiple blocks, default formatting:
              do {
                  {
                      next if $x == $y;    # do something here
                  }
              } until $x++ > $z;
  
          perltidy -wn
              do { {
                  next if $x == $y;
              } } until $x++ > $z;
  
           EXAMPLE 2, three levels of wrapped function calls, default formatting:
                  p(
                      em(
                          conjug(
                              translate( param('verb') ), param('tense'),
                              param('person')
                          )
                      )
                  );
  
              # perltidy -wn
                  p( em( conjug(
                      translate( param('verb') ),
                      param('tense'), param('person')
                  ) ) );
  
              # EXAMPLE 3, chained method calls, default formatting:
              get('http://mojolicious.org')->then(
                  sub {
                      my $mojo = shift;
                      say $mojo->res->code;
                      return get('http://metacpan.org');
                  }
              )->then(
                  sub {
                      my $cpan = shift;
                      say $cpan->res->code;
                  }
              )->catch(
                  sub {
                      my $err = shift;
                      warn "Something went wrong: $err";
                  }
              )->wait;
  
              # perltidy -wn
              get('http://mojolicious.org')->then( sub {
                  my $mojo = shift;
                  say $mojo->res->code;
                  return get('http://metacpan.org');
              } )->then( sub {
                  my $cpan = shift;
                  say $cpan->res->code;
              } )->catch( sub {
                  my $err = shift;
                  warn "Something went wrong: $err";
              } )->wait;
  
  
        - Fixed RT #114359: Missparsing of "print $x ** 0.5;
  
        - Deactivated the --check-syntax flag for better security.  It will be
          ignored if set.  
  
        - Corrected minimum perl version from 5.004 to 5.008 based on perlver
          report.  The change is required for coding involving wide characters.
  
        - For certain severe errors, the source file will be copied directly to the
          output without formatting. These include ending in a quote, ending in a
          here doc, and encountering an unidentified character.

    2017 12 14
        - RT #123749, partial fix.  "Continuation indentation" is removed from lines 
          with leading closing parens which are part of a call chain. 
          For example, the call to pack() is is now outdented to the starting 
          indentation in the following experession:  
  
              # OLD
              $mw->Button(
                  -text    => "New Document",
                  -command => \&new_document
                )->pack(
                  -side   => 'bottom',
                  -anchor => 'e'
                );
  
              # NEW
              $mw->Button(
                  -text    => "New Document",
                  -command => \&new_document
              )->pack(
                  -side   => 'bottom',
                  -anchor => 'e'
              );
  
          This modification improves readability of complex expressions, especially
          when the user uses the same value for continuation indentation (-ci=n) and 
          normal indentation (-i=n).  Perltidy was already programmed to
          do this but a minor bug was preventing it.
  
        - RT #123774, added flag to control space between a backslash and a single or
          double quote, requested by Robert Rothenberg.  The issue is that lines like
  
             $str1=\"string1";
             $str2=\'string2';
  
          confuse syntax highlighters unless a space is left between the backslash and
          the quote.
  
          The new flag to control this is -sbq=n (--space-backslash-quote=n), 
          where n=0 means no space, n=1 means follow existing code, n=2 means always
          space.  The default is n=1, meaning that a space will be retained if there
          is one in the source code.
  
        - Fixed RT #123492, support added for indented here doc operator <<~ added 
          in v5.26.  Thanks to Chris Weyl for the report.
  
        - Fixed docs; --closing-side-comment-list-string should have been just
          --closing-side-comment-list.  Thanks to F.Li.
  
        - Added patch RT #122030] Perl::Tidy sometimes does not call binmode.
          Thanks to Irilis Aelae.
  
        - Fixed RT #121959, PERLTIDY doesn't honor the 'three dot' notation for 
          locating a config file using environment variables.  Thanks to John 
          Wittkowski.
  
        - Minor improvements to formatting, in which some additional vertical
          aligmnemt is done. Thanks to Keith Neargarder.
  
        - RT #119588.  Vertical alignment is no longer done for // operator.

        - Fixed debian #862667: failure to check for perltidy.ERR deletion can lead 
          to overwriting abritrary files by symlink attack. Perltidy was continuing 
          to write files after an unlink failure.  Thanks to Don Armstrong 
          for a patch.
  
        - Fixed RT #116344, perltidy fails on certain anonymous hash references:
          in the following code snippet the '?' was misparsed as a pattern 
          delimiter rather than a ternary operator.
              return ref {} ? 1 : 0;
  
        - Fixed RT #113792: misparsing of a fat comma (=>) right after 
          the __END__ or __DATA__ tokens.  These keywords were getting
          incorrectly quoted by the following => operator.
  
        - Fixed RT #118558. Custom Getopt::Long configuration breaks parsing 
          of perltidyrc.  Perltidy was resetting the users configuration too soon.
  
        - Fixed RT #119140, failure to parse double diamond operator.  Code to
          handle this new operator has been added.
  
        - Fixed RT #120968.  Fixed problem where -enc=utf8 didn't work 
          with --backup-and-modify-in-place. Thanks to Heinz Knutzen for this patch.
  
        - Fixed minor formatting issue where one-line blocks for subs with signatures 
          were unnecesarily broken
  
        - RT #32905, patch to fix utf-8 error when output was STDOUT. 
  
        - RT #79947, improved spacing of try/catch/finally blocks. Thanks to qsimpleq
          for a patch.
  
        - Fixed #114909, Anonymous subs with signatures and prototypes misparsed as
          broken ternaries, in which a statement such as this was not being parsed
          correctly:
              return sub ( $fh, $out ) : prototype(*$) { ... }
  
        - Implemented RT #113689, option to introduces spaces after an opening block
          brace and before a closing block brace. Four new optional controls are
          added. The first two define the minimum number of blank lines to be
          inserted 
  
           -blao=i or --blank-lines-after-opening-block=i
           -blbc=i or --blank-lines-before-closing-block=i
  
          where i is an integer, the number of lines (the default is 0).  
  
          The second two define the types of blocks to which the first two apply 
  
           -blaol=s or --blank-lines-after-opening-block-list=s
           -blbcl=s or --blank-lines-before-closing-block-list=s
      
          where s is a string of possible block keywords (default is just 'sub',
          meaning a named subroutine).
  
          For more information please see the documentation.
  
        - The method for specifying block types for certain input parameters has
          been generalized to distinguish between normal named subroutines and
          anonymous subs.  The keyword for normal subroutines remains 'sub', and
          the new keyword for anonymous subs is 'asub'. 
  
        - Minor documentation changes. The BUGS sections now have a link
          to CPAN where most open bugs and issues can be reviewed and bug reports
          can be submitted.  The information in the AUTHOR and CREDITS sections of
          the man pages have been removed from the man pages to streamline the
          documentation. This information is still in the source code.

          was placed before the closing brace of an anonymous sub with 
          a signature, if it was in a list.  Thanks to Dmytro Zagashev.
  
        - Corrected a minor problem in which occasional extra indentation was
          given to the closing brace of an anonymous sub in a list when the -lp 
          parameter was set.
  
    2016 03 01
        - RT #104427. Added support for signatures.
  
        - RT #111512.  Changed global warning flag $^W = 1 to use warnings;
          Thanks to Dmytro Zagashev.
  
        - RT #110297, added support for new regexp modifier /n
          Thanks to Dmytro Zagashev.
  
        - RT #111519.  The -io (--indent-only) and -dac (--delete-all-comments)
          can now both be used in one pass. Thanks to Dmitry Veltishev.
  
        - Patch to avoid error message with 'catch' used by TryCatch, as in
             catch($err){
                # do something
             }
          Thanks to Nick Tonkin.
  
        - RT #32905, UTF-8 coding is now more robust. Thanks to qsimpleq
          and Dmytro for patches.
  
        - RT #106885. Added string bitwise operators ^. &. |. ~. ^.= &.= |.=
   
        - Fixed RT #107832 and #106492, lack of vertical alignment of two lines
          when -boc flag (break at old commas) is set.  This bug was 
          inadvertantly introduced in previous bug fix RT #98902. 
  
        - Some common extensions to Perl syntax are handled better.
          In particular, the following snippet is now foratted cleanly:
  
            method deposit( Num $amount) {
                $self->balance( $self->balance + $amount );
            }
  
          A new flag -xs (--extended-syntax) was added to enable this, and the default
          is to use -xs. 
  
          In previous versions, and now only when -nxs is set, this snippet of code
          generates the following error message:
  
          "syntax error at ') {', didn't see one of: case elsif for foreach given if switch unless until when while"

   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES

    2015 08 15
        - Fixed RT# 105484, Invalid warning about 'else' in 'switch' statement.  The
          warning happened if a 'case' statement did not use parens.
  
        - Fixed RT# 101547, misparse of // caused error message.  Also..
  
        - Fixed RT# 102371, misparse of // caused unwated space in //=
  
        - Fixed RT# 100871, "silent failure of HTML Output on Windows". 
          Changed calls to tempfile() from:
            my ( $fh_tmp, $tmpfile ) = tempfile();
          to have the full path name:
            my ( $fh_tmp, $tmpfile ) = File::Temp::tempfile()
          because of problems in the Windows version reported by Dean Pearce.
  
        - Fixed RT# 99514, calling the perltidy module multiple times with 
          a .perltidyrc file containing the parameter --output-line-ending 
          caused a crash.  This was a glitch in the memoization logic. 
  
        - Fixed RT#99961, multiple lines inside a cast block caused unwanted
          continuation indentation.  
  
        - RT# 32905, broken handling of UTF-8 strings. 
          A new flag -utf8 causes perltidy assume UTF-8 encoding for input and 
          output of an io stream.  Thanks to Sebastian Podjasek for a patch.  
          This feature may not work correctly in older versions of Perl. 
          It worked in a linux version 5.10.1 but not in a Windows version 5.8.3 (but
          otherwise perltidy ran correctly).
  
        - Warning files now report perltidy VERSION. Suggested by John Karr.
   
        - Fixed long flag --nostack-closing-tokens (-nsct has always worked though). 
          This was due to a typo.  This also fixed --nostack-opening-tokens to 
          behave correctly.  Thanks to Rob Dixon.

- updated to 20140711
       - Fixed RT #94902: abbreviation parsing in .perltidyrc files was not
         working for multi-line abbreviations.  Thanks to Eric Fung for 
         supplying a patch. 
   
       - Fixed RT #95708, misparsing of a hash when the first key was a perl
         keyword, causing a semicolon to be incorrectly added.
 
       - Fixed RT #94338 for-loop in a parenthesized block-map.  A code block within
         parentheses of a map, sort, or grep function was being mistokenized.  In 
         rare cases this could produce in an incorrect error message.  The fix will
         produce some minor formatting changes.  Thanks to Daniel Trizen 
         discovering and documenting this.
 
       - Fixed RT #94354, excess indentation for stacked tokens.  Thanks to 
         Colin Williams for supplying a patch.
 
       - Added support for experimental postfix dereferencing notation introduced in
         perl 5.20. RT #96021.
 
       - Updated documentation to clarify the behavior of the -io flag
         in response to RT #95709.  You can add -noll or -l=0 to prevent 
         long comments from being outdented when -io is used.
 
       - Added a check to prevent a problem reported in RT #81866, where large
         scripts which had been compressed to a single line could not be formatted
         because of a check for VERSION for MakeMaker. The workaround was to 
         use -nvpl, but this shouldn't be necessary now.
 
       - Fixed RT #96101; Closing brace of anonymous sub in a list was being
         indented.  For example, the closing brace of the anonymous sub below 
         will now be lined up with the word 'callback'.  This problem 
         occured if there was no comma after the closing brace of the anonymous sub.  
         This update may cause minor changes to formatting of code with lists 
         of anonymous subs, especially TK code.

Fri Oct  4 09:11:17 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 20130922
    - Fixed RT #88020. --converge was not working with wide characters.
    - Fixed RT #78156. package NAMESPACE VERSION syntax not accepted.
    - First attempt to fix RT #88588.  INDEX END tag change in pod2html breaks 
      perltidy -html. I put in a patch which should work but I don't yet have
      a way of testing it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  6 17:49:08 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 20130806
      - Fixed RT #87107, spelling

      - Fixed RT #87502, incorrect of parsing of smartmatch before hash brace
  
      - Added feature request RT #87330, trim whitespace after POD.
        The flag -trp (--trim-pod) will trim trailing whitespace from lines of POD

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 27 11:58:42 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 20130717
      - Fixed RT #86929, #86930, missing lhs of assignment.
      - Fixed RT #84922, moved pod from Tidy.pm into Tidy.pod

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  9 14:59:59 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 20121207
    - The flag -cab=n or --comma-arrow-breakpoints=n has been generalized
      to give better control over breaking open short containers.  The
      possible values are now:

        n=0 break at all commas after =>  
        n=1 stable: break at all commas after => if container is open,
            EXCEPT FOR one-line containers
        n=2 break at all commas after =>, BUT try to form the maximum
            maximum one-line container lengths
        n=3 do not treat commas after => specially at all 
        n=4 break everything: like n=0 but also break a short container with
            a => not followed by a comma
        n=5 stable: like n=1 but ALSO break at open one-line containers (default)

      New values n=4 and n=5 have been added to allow short blocks to be
      broken open.  The new default is n=5, stable.  It should more closely
      follow the breaks in the input file, and previously formatted code
      should remain unchanged.  If this causes problems use -cab=1 to recover 
      the former behavior.  Thanks to Tony Maszeroski for the suggestion.

      To illustrate the need for the new options, if perltidy is given
      the following code, then the old default (-cab=1) was to close up 
      the 'index' container even if it was open in the source.  The new 
      default (-cab=5) will keep it open if it was open in the source.

       our $fancypkg = {
           'ALL' => {
               'index' => {
                   'key' => 'value',
               },
               'alpine' => {
                   'one'   => '+',
                   'two'   => '+',
                   'three' => '+',
               },
           }
       };

    - New debug flag --memoize (-mem).  This version contains a 
      patch supplied by Jonathan Swartz which can significantly speed up
      repeated calls to Perl::Tidy::perltidy in a single process by caching
      the result of parsing the formatting parameters.  A factor of up to 10
      speedup was achieved for masontidy (https://metacpan.org/module/masontidy).
      The memoization patch is on by default but can be deactivated for 
      testing with -nmem (or --no-memoize).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 19 10:50:16 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.de

- update to 20101217
   - added new flag -it=n or --iterations=n
   - A configuration file pathname begins with three dots, e.g.
     ".../.perltidyrc", indicates that the file should be searched for starting
     in the current directory and working upwards. 
   - Added flag --notidy which disables all formatting and causes the input to be
     copied unchanged. 
   - Added prefilters and postfilters in the call to the Tidy.pm module.
   - The starting indentation level of sections of code entabbed with -et=n
     is correctly guessed if it was also produced with the same -et=n flag.  This
     keeps the indentation stable on repeated formatting passes within an editor.
     Thanks to Sam Kington and Glenn.
   - Functions with prototype '&' had a space between the function and opening peren.
   - Patch to never put spaces around a bare word in braces beginning with ^
