  ## 2020 09 07
      - Fixed bug git #37, an error when the combination -scbb -csc was used.
        It occurs in perltidy versions 20200110, 20200619, and 20200822.  What happens is
        that when two consecutive lines with isolated closing braces had new side
        comments generated by the -csc parameter, a separating newline was missing.
        The resulting script will not then run, but worse, if it is reformatted with
        the same parameters then closing side comments could be overwritten and data
        lost.
        This problem was found during automated random testing.  The parameter
        -scbb is rarely used, which is probably why this has not been reported.  Please
        upgrade your version.
      - Added parameter --non-indenting-braces, or -nib, which prevents
        code from indenting one level if it follows an opening brace marked
        with a special side comment, '#<<<'.  For example,
                      { #<<<   a closure to contain lexical vars
                      my $var;  # this line does not indent
                      }
                      # this line cannot 'see' $var;
        This is on by default.  If your code happens to have some
        opening braces followed by '#<<<', and you
        don't want this, you can use -nnib to deactivate it.
      - Side comment locations reset at a line ending in a level 0 open
        block, such as when a new multi-line sub begins.  This is intended to
        help keep side comments from drifting to far to the right.

  ## 2020 08 22
      - Fix RT #133166, encoding not set for -st.  Also reported as RT #133171
        and git #35.
        This is a significant bug in version 20200616 which can corrupt data if
        perltidy is run as a filter on encoded text.
  **Please upgrade**
      - Fix issue RT #133161, perltidy -html was not working on pod
      - Fix issue git #33, allow control of space after '->'
      - Vertical alignment has been improved. Numerous minor issues have
        been fixed.
      - Formatting with the -lp option is improved.
      - Fixed issue git #32, misparse of bare 'ref' in ternary
      - When --assert-tidy is used and triggers an error, the first difference
        between input and output files is shown in the error output. This is
        a partial response to issue git #30.

- updated to 20200619
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2020 06 19
      - Added support for Switch::Plain syntax, issue git #31.
      - Fixed minor problem where trailing 'unless' clauses were not
        getting vertically aligned.
      - Added a parameter --logical-padding or -lop to allow logical padding
        to be turned off.  Requested by git #29. This flag is on by default.
        The man pages have examples.
      - Added a parameter -kpit=n to control spaces inside of parens following
        certain keywords, requested in git#26. This flag is off by default.
      - Added fix for git#25, improve vertical alignment for long lists with
        varying numbers of items per line.
      - calls to the module Perl::Tidy can now capture any output produced
        by a debug flag or one of the 'tee' flags through the new 'debugfile' and
        'teefile' call parameters.  These output streams are rarely used but
        they are now treated the same as any 'logfile' stream.
      - add option --break-at-old-semicolon-breakpoints', -bos, requested
        in RT#131644.  This flag will keep lines beginning with a semicolon.
      - Added --use-unicode-gcstring to control use of Unicode::GCString for
        evaluating character widths of encoded data.  The default is
        not to use this (--nouse-unicode-gcstring). If this flag is set,
        perltidy will look for Unicode::GCString and, if found, will use it
        to evaluate character display widths.  This can improve displayed
        vertical alignment for files with wide characters.  It is a nice
        feature but it is off by default to avoid conflicting formatting
        when there are multiple developers.  Perltidy installation does not
        require Unicode::GCString, so users wanting to use this feature need
        set this flag and also to install Unicode::GCString separately.
      - Added --character-encoding=guess or -guess to have perltidy guess
        if a file (or other input stream) is encoded as -utf8 or some
        other single-byte encoding. This is useful when processing a mixture
        of file types, such as utf8 and latin-1.
        Please Note: The default encoding has been set to be 'guess'
        instead of 'none'. This seems like the best default, since
        it allows perltidy work properly with both
        utf8 files and older latin-1 files.  The guess mode uses Encode::Guess,
        which is included in standard perl distributions, and only tries to
        guess if a file is utf8 or not, never any other encoding.  If the guess is
        utf8, and if the file successfully decodes as utf8, then it the encoding
        is assumed to be utf8.  Otherwise, no encoding is assumed.
        If you do not want to use this new default guess mode, or have a
        problem with it, you can set --character-encoding=none (the previous
        default) or --character-encoding=utf8 (if you deal with utf8 files).
      - Specific encodings of input files other than utf8 may now be given, for
        example --character-encoding=euc-jp.
      - Fix for git#22, Preserve function signature on a single line. An
        unwanted line break was being introduced when a closing signature paren
        followed a closing do brace.
      - Fix RT#132059, the -dac parameter was not working and caused an error exit
      - When -utf8 is used, any error output is encoded as utf8
      - Fix for git#19, adjust line break around an 'xor'
      - Fix for git#18, added warning for missing comma before unknown bare word.

   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2020 01 10
  
      - This release adds a flag to control the feature RT#130394 (allow short nested blocks)
        introduced in the previous release.  Unfortunately that feature breaks 
        RPerl installations, so a control flag has been introduced and that feature is now
        off by default.  The flag is:
  
        --one-line-block-nesting=n, or -olbn=n, where n is an integer as follows: 
  
        -olbn=0 break nested one-line blocks into multiple lines [new DEFAULT]
        -olbn=1 stable; keep existing nested-one line blocks intact [previous DEFAULT]
  
        For example, consider this input line:
  
          foreach (@list) { if ($_ eq $asked_for) { last } ++$found }
  
        The new default behavior (-olbn=0), and behavior prior to version 20191203, is to break it into multiple lines:
  
          foreach (@list) {
              if ( $_ eq $asked_for ) { last }
              ++$found;
          }
  
        To keep nested one-line blocks such as this on a single line you can add the parameter -olbn=1.
  
      - Fixed issue RT#131288: parse error for un-prototyped constant function without parenthesized
        call parameters followed by ternary.
  
      - Fixed issue RT#131360, installation documentation.  Added a note that the binary 
        'perltidy' comes with the Perl::Tidy module. They can both normally be installed with 
        'cpanm Perl::Tidy'

- updated to 20191203
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2019 12 03
  
      - Fixed issue RT#131115: -bli option not working correctly.
        Closing braces were not indented in some cases due to a glitch
        introduced in version 20181120.
  
      - Fixed issue RT#130394: Allow short nested blocks.  Given the following
  
          $factorial = sub { reduce { $a * $b } 1 .. 11 };
     
        Previous versions would always break the sub block because it
        contains another block (the reduce block).  The fix keeps
        short one-line blocks such as this intact.
  
      - Implement issue RT#130640: Allow different subroutine keywords.
        Added a flag --sub-alias-list=s or -sal=s, where s is a string with
        one or more aliases for 'sub', separated by spaces or commas.
        For example,
  
          perltidy -sal='method fun' 
  
        will cause the perltidy to treat the words 'method' and 'fun' to be
        treated the same as if they were 'sub'.
  
      - Added flag --space-prototype-paren=i, or -spp=i, to control spacing 
        before the opening paren of a prototype, where i=0, 1, or 2:
        i=0 no space
        i=1 follow input [current and default]
        i=2 always space
  
        Previously, perltidy always followed the input.
        For example, given the following input 
  
           sub usage();
  
        The result will be:
          sub usage();    # i=0 [no space]
          sub usage();    # i=1 [default; follows input]
          sub usage ();   # i=2 [space]
  
      - Fixed issue git#16, minor vertical alignment issue.
  
      - Fixed issue git#10, minor conflict of -wn and -ce
  
      - Improved some vertical alignments involving two lines.

- updated to 20190915
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2019 09 15
  
      - fixed issue RT#130344: false warning "operator in print statement" 
        for "use lib". 
  
      - fixed issue RT#130304: standard error output should include filename.
        When perltidy error messages are directed to the standard error output 
        with -se or --standard-error-output, the message lines now have a prefix 
        'filename:' for clarification in case multiple files 
        are processed, where 'filename' is the name of the input file.  If 
        input is from the standard input the displayed filename is '<stdin>', 
        and if it is from a data structure then displayed filename 
        is '<source_stream>'.
  
      - implement issue RT#130425: check mode.  A new flag '--assert-tidy'
        will cause an error message if the output script is not identical to
        the input script. For completeness, the opposite flag '--assert-untidy'
        has also been added.  The next item, RT#130297, insures that the script
        will exit with a non-zero exit flag if the assertion fails.
  
      - fixed issue RT#130297; the perltidy script now exits with a nonzero exit 
        status if it wrote to the standard error output. Prevously only fatal
        run errors produced a non-zero exit flag. Now, even non-fatal messages
        requested with the -w flag will cause a non-zero exit flag.  The exit
        flag now has these values:
  
           0 = no errors
           1 = perltidy could not run to completion due to errors
           2 = perltidy ran to completion with error messages
  
      - added warning message for RT#130008, which warns of conflicting input
        parameters -iob and -bom or -boc.
  
      - fixed RT#129850; concerning a space between a closing block brace and
        opening bracket or brace, as occurs before the '[' in this line:
  
         my @addunix = map { File::Spec::Unix->catfile( @ROOT, @$_ ) } ['b'];
  
        Formerly, any space was removed. Now it is optional, and the output will
        follow the input.
  
      - fixed issue git#13, needless trailing whitespace in error message
  
      - fixed issue git#9: if the -ce (--cuddled-else) flag is used,
        do not try to form new one line blocks for a block type 
        specified with -cbl, particularly map, sort, grep
  
      - iteration speedup for unchanged code.  Previously, when iterations were
        requested, at least two formatting passes were made. Now just a single pass
        is made if the formatted code is identical to the input code.
  
      - some improved vertical alignments

   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES.md

  ## 2019 06 01
  
      - rt #128477: Prevent inconsistent owner/group and setuid/setgid bits. 
        In the -b (--backup-and-modify-in-place) mode, an attempt is made to set ownership
        of the output file equal to the input file, if they differ.
        In all cases, if the final output file ownership differs from input file, any setuid/setgid bits are cleared.
  
      - Added option -bom  (--break-at-old-method-breakpoints) by
        merrillymeredith which preserves breakpoints of method chains. Modified to also handle a cuddled call style.
  
      - Merged patch to fix Windows EOL translation error with UTF-8 written by
        Ron Ivy. This update prevents automatic conversion to 'DOS' CRLF line
        endings.  Also, Windows system testing at the appveyor site is working again.
  
      - RT #128280, added flag --one-line-block-semicolons=n (-olbs=n) 
        to control semicolons in one-line blocks.  The values of n are:
          n=0 means no semicolons termininating simple one-line blocks
          n=1 means stable; do not change from input file [DEFAULT and current]
          n=2 means always add semicolons in one-line blocks
        The current behavior corresponds to the default n=1.
  
      - RT #128216, Minor update to prevent inserting unwanted blank line at
        indentation level change.  This should not change existing scripts.
  
      - RT #81852: Improved indentation when quoted word (qw) lists are 
        nested within other containers using the --weld-nested (-wn) flag.
        The example given previously (below) is now closer to what it would
        be with a simple list instead of qw:
  
        # perltidy -wn
        use_all_ok( qw{
            PPI
            PPI::Tokenizer
            PPI::Lexer
            PPI::Dumper
            PPI::Find
            PPI::Normal
            PPI::Util
            PPI::Cache
        } );
  
      - RT#12764, introduced new feature allowing placement of blanks around
        sequences of selected keywords. This can be activated with the -kgb* 
        series of parameters described in the manual.
  
      - Rewrote vertical algnment module.  It is better at finding
        patterns in complex code. For example,
  
  	OLD:
             /^-std$/ && do { $std       = 1;     next; };
             /^--$/   && do { @link_args = @argv; last; };
             /^-I(.*)/ && do { $path = $1 || shift @argv; next; };
  
  	NEW:
             /^-std$/  && do { $std       = 1;                 next; };
             /^--$/    && do { @link_args = @argv;             last; };
             /^-I(.*)/ && do { $path      = $1 || shift @argv; next; };
  
      - Add repository URLs to META files 
  
      - RT #118553, "leave only one newline at end of file". This option was not 
        added because of undesirable side effects, but a new filter script
        was added which can do this, "examples/delete_ending_blank_lines.pl".

        - RT #124469, #124494, perltidy often making empty files.  The previous had
          an index error causing it to fail, particularly in version 5.18 of Perl.
  
          Please avoid version 20180219.

    2018 02 19
        - RT #79947, cuddled-else generalization. A new flag -cb provides
          'cuddled-else' type formatting for an arbitrary type of block chain. The
          default is try-catch-finally, but this can be modified with the 
          parameter -cbl. 
  
        - Fixed RT #124298: add space after ! operator without breaking !! secret 
          operator
  
        - RT #123749: numerous minor improvements to the -wn flag were made.  
  
        - Fixed a problem with convergence tests in which iterations were stopping 
          prematurely. 
  
        - Here doc targets for <<~ type here-docs may now have leading whitespace.
  
        - Fixed RT #124354. The '-indent-only' flag was not working correctly in the 
          previous release. A bug in version 20180101 caused extra blank lines 
          to be output.
  
        - Issue RT #124114. Some improvements were made in vertical alignment
          involving 'fat commas'.

- updated to 20180101
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Perl-Tidy/CHANGES

    2018 01 01
        - Added new flag -wn (--weld-nested-containers) which addresses these issues:
          RT #123749: Problem with promises; 
          RT #119970: opening token stacking strange behavior;
          RT #81853: Can't stack block braces
  
          This option causes closely nested pairs of opening and closing containers
          to be "welded" together and essentially be formatted as a single unit,
          with just one level of indentation.
  
          Since this is a new flag it is set to be "off" by default but it has given 
          excellent results in testing. 
  
          EXAMPLE 1, multiple blocks, default formatting:
              do {
                  {
                      next if $x == $y;    # do something here
                  }
              } until $x++ > $z;
  
          perltidy -wn
              do { {
                  next if $x == $y;
              } } until $x++ > $z;
  
           EXAMPLE 2, three levels of wrapped function calls, default formatting:
                  p(
                      em(
                          conjug(
                              translate( param('verb') ), param('tense'),
                              param('person')
                          )
                      )
                  );
  
              # perltidy -wn
                  p( em( conjug(
                      translate( param('verb') ),
                      param('tense'), param('person')
                  ) ) );
  
              # EXAMPLE 3, chained method calls, default formatting:
              get('http://mojolicious.org')->then(
                  sub {
                      my $mojo = shift;
                      say $mojo->res->code;
                      return get('http://metacpan.org');
                  }
              )->then(
                  sub {
                      my $cpan = shift;
                      say $cpan->res->code;
                  }
              )->catch(
                  sub {
                      my $err = shift;
                      warn "Something went wrong: $err";
                  }
              )->wait;
  
              # perltidy -wn
              get('http://mojolicious.org')->then( sub {
                  my $mojo = shift;
                  say $mojo->res->code;
                  return get('http://metacpan.org');
              } )->then( sub {

                  warn "Something went wrong: $err";
              } )->wait;
  
  
        - Fixed RT #114359: Missparsing of "print $x ** 0.5;
  
        - Deactivated the --check-syntax flag for better security.  It will be
          ignored if set.  
  
        - Corrected minimum perl version from 5.004 to 5.008 based on perlver
          report.  The change is required for coding involving wide characters.
  
        - For certain severe errors, the source file will be copied directly to the
          output without formatting. These include ending in a quote, ending in a
          here doc, and encountering an unidentified character.

        - RT #123749, partial fix.  "Continuation indentation" is removed from lines 
          with leading closing parens which are part of a call chain. 
          For example, the call to pack() is is now outdented to the starting 
          indentation in the following experession:  
  
              # OLD
              $mw->Button(
                  -text    => "New Document",
                  -command => \&new_document
                )->pack(
                  -side   => 'bottom',
                  -anchor => 'e'
                );
  
              # NEW
              $mw->Button(
                  -text    => "New Document",
                  -command => \&new_document
              )->pack(
                  -side   => 'bottom',
                  -anchor => 'e'
              );
  
          This modification improves readability of complex expressions, especially
          when the user uses the same value for continuation indentation (-ci=n) and 
          normal indentation (-i=n).  Perltidy was already programmed to
          do this but a minor bug was preventing it.
  
        - RT #123774, added flag to control space between a backslash and a single or
          double quote, requested by Robert Rothenberg.  The issue is that lines like
  
             $str1=\"string1";
             $str2=\'string2';
  
          confuse syntax highlighters unless a space is left between the backslash and
          the quote.
  
          The new flag to control this is -sbq=n (--space-backslash-quote=n), 
          where n=0 means no space, n=1 means follow existing code, n=2 means always
          space.  The default is n=1, meaning that a space will be retained if there
          is one in the source code.
  
        - Fixed RT #123492, support added for indented here doc operator <<~ added 
          in v5.26.  Thanks to Chris Weyl for the report.
  
        - Fixed docs; --closing-side-comment-list-string should have been just
          --closing-side-comment-list.  Thanks to F.Li.
  
        - Added patch RT #122030] Perl::Tidy sometimes does not call binmode.
          Thanks to Irilis Aelae.
  
        - Fixed RT #121959, PERLTIDY doesn't honor the 'three dot' notation for 
          locating a config file using environment variables.  Thanks to John 
          Wittkowski.
  
        - Minor improvements to formatting, in which some additional vertical
          aligmnemt is done. Thanks to Keith Neargarder.
  
        - RT #119588.  Vertical alignment is no longer done for // operator.

    2017 05 21
        - Fixed debian #862667: failure to check for perltidy.ERR deletion can lead 
          to overwriting abritrary files by symlink attack. Perltidy was continuing 
          to write files after an unlink failure.  Thanks to Don Armstrong 
          for a patch.
  
        - Fixed RT #116344, perltidy fails on certain anonymous hash references:
          in the following code snippet the '?' was misparsed as a pattern 
          delimiter rather than a ternary operator.
              return ref {} ? 1 : 0;
  
        - Fixed RT #113792: misparsing of a fat comma (=>) right after 
          the __END__ or __DATA__ tokens.  These keywords were getting
          incorrectly quoted by the following => operator.
  
        - Fixed RT #118558. Custom Getopt::Long configuration breaks parsing 
          of perltidyrc.  Perltidy was resetting the users configuration too soon.
  
        - Fixed RT #119140, failure to parse double diamond operator.  Code to
          handle this new operator has been added.
  
        - Fixed RT #120968.  Fixed problem where -enc=utf8 didn't work 
          with --backup-and-modify-in-place. Thanks to Heinz Knutzen for this patch.
  
        - Fixed minor formatting issue where one-line blocks for subs with signatures 
          were unnecesarily broken
  
        - RT #32905, patch to fix utf-8 error when output was STDOUT. 
  
        - RT #79947, improved spacing of try/catch/finally blocks. Thanks to qsimpleq
          for a patch.
  
        - Fixed #114909, Anonymous subs with signatures and prototypes misparsed as
          broken ternaries, in which a statement such as this was not being parsed
          correctly:
              return sub ( $fh, $out ) : prototype(*$) { ... }
  
        - Implemented RT #113689, option to introduces spaces after an opening block
          brace and before a closing block brace. Four new optional controls are
          added. The first two define the minimum number of blank lines to be
          inserted 
  
           -blao=i or --blank-lines-after-opening-block=i
           -blbc=i or --blank-lines-before-closing-block=i
  
          where i is an integer, the number of lines (the default is 0).  
  
          The second two define the types of blocks to which the first two apply 
  
           -blaol=s or --blank-lines-after-opening-block-list=s
           -blbcl=s or --blank-lines-before-closing-block-list=s
      
          where s is a string of possible block keywords (default is just 'sub',
          meaning a named subroutine).
  
          For more information please see the documentation.
  
        - The method for specifying block types for certain input parameters has
          been generalized to distinguish between normal named subroutines and
          anonymous subs.  The keyword for normal subroutines remains 'sub', and
          the new keyword for anonymous subs is 'asub'. 
  
        - Minor documentation changes. The BUGS sections now have a link
          to CPAN where most open bugs and issues can be reviewed and bug reports
          can be submitted.  The information in the AUTHOR and CREDITS sections of
          the man pages have been removed from the man pages to streamline the
          documentation. This information is still in the source code.

        - RT #112534. Corrected a minor problem in which an unwanted newline
          was placed before the closing brace of an anonymous sub with 
          a signature, if it was in a list.  Thanks to Dmytro Zagashev.
  
        - Corrected a minor problem in which occasional extra indentation was
          given to the closing brace of an anonymous sub in a list when the -lp 
          parameter was set.
  
    2016 03 01
        - RT #104427. Added support for signatures.
  
        - RT #111512.  Changed global warning flag $^W = 1 to use warnings;
          Thanks to Dmytro Zagashev.
  
        - RT #110297, added support for new regexp modifier /n
          Thanks to Dmytro Zagashev.
  
        - RT #111519.  The -io (--indent-only) and -dac (--delete-all-comments)
          can now both be used in one pass. Thanks to Dmitry Veltishev.
  
        - Patch to avoid error message with 'catch' used by TryCatch, as in
             catch($err){
                # do something
             }
          Thanks to Nick Tonkin.
  
        - RT #32905, UTF-8 coding is now more robust. Thanks to qsimpleq
          and Dmytro for patches.
  
        - RT #106885. Added string bitwise operators ^. &. |. ~. ^.= &.= |.=
   
        - Fixed RT #107832 and #106492, lack of vertical alignment of two lines
          when -boc flag (break at old commas) is set.  This bug was 
          inadvertantly introduced in previous bug fix RT #98902. 
  
        - Some common extensions to Perl syntax are handled better.
          In particular, the following snippet is now foratted cleanly:
  
            method deposit( Num $amount) {
                $self->balance( $self->balance + $amount );
            }
  
          A new flag -xs (--extended-syntax) was added to enable this, and the default
          is to use -xs. 
  
          In previous versions, and now only when -nxs is set, this snippet of code
          generates the following error message:
  
          "syntax error at ') {', didn't see one of: case elsif for foreach given if switch unless until when while"

    2015 08 15
        - Fixed RT# 105484, Invalid warning about 'else' in 'switch' statement.  The
          warning happened if a 'case' statement did not use parens.
  
        - Fixed RT# 101547, misparse of // caused error message.  Also..
  
        - Fixed RT# 102371, misparse of // caused unwated space in //=
  
        - Fixed RT# 100871, "silent failure of HTML Output on Windows". 
          Changed calls to tempfile() from:
            my ( $fh_tmp, $tmpfile ) = tempfile();
          to have the full path name:
            my ( $fh_tmp, $tmpfile ) = File::Temp::tempfile()
          because of problems in the Windows version reported by Dean Pearce.
  
        - Fixed RT# 99514, calling the perltidy module multiple times with 
          a .perltidyrc file containing the parameter --output-line-ending 
          caused a crash.  This was a glitch in the memoization logic. 
  
        - Fixed RT#99961, multiple lines inside a cast block caused unwanted
          continuation indentation.  
  
        - RT# 32905, broken handling of UTF-8 strings. 
          A new flag -utf8 causes perltidy assume UTF-8 encoding for input and 
          output of an io stream.  Thanks to Sebastian Podjasek for a patch.  
          This feature may not work correctly in older versions of Perl. 
          It worked in a linux version 5.10.1 but not in a Windows version 5.8.3 (but
          otherwise perltidy ran correctly).
  
        - Warning files now report perltidy VERSION. Suggested by John Karr.
   
        - Fixed long flag --nostack-closing-tokens (-nsct has always worked though). 
          This was due to a typo.  This also fixed --nostack-opening-tokens to 
          behave correctly.  Thanks to Rob Dixon.

Mon Sep 15 15:44:35 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 20140711
       - Fixed RT #94902: abbreviation parsing in .perltidyrc files was not
         working for multi-line abbreviations.  Thanks to Eric Fung for 
         supplying a patch. 
   
       - Fixed RT #95708, misparsing of a hash when the first key was a perl
         keyword, causing a semicolon to be incorrectly added.
 
       - Fixed RT #94338 for-loop in a parenthesized block-map.  A code block within
         parentheses of a map, sort, or grep function was being mistokenized.  In 
         rare cases this could produce in an incorrect error message.  The fix will
         produce some minor formatting changes.  Thanks to Daniel Trizen 
         discovering and documenting this.
 
       - Fixed RT #94354, excess indentation for stacked tokens.  Thanks to 
         Colin Williams for supplying a patch.
 
       - Added support for experimental postfix dereferencing notation introduced in
         perl 5.20. RT #96021.
 
       - Updated documentation to clarify the behavior of the -io flag
         in response to RT #95709.  You can add -noll or -l=0 to prevent 
         long comments from being outdented when -io is used.
 
       - Added a check to prevent a problem reported in RT #81866, where large
         scripts which had been compressed to a single line could not be formatted
         because of a check for VERSION for MakeMaker. The workaround was to 
         use -nvpl, but this shouldn't be necessary now.
 
       - Fixed RT #96101; Closing brace of anonymous sub in a list was being
         indented.  For example, the closing brace of the anonymous sub below 
         will now be lined up with the word 'callback'.  This problem 
         occured if there was no comma after the closing brace of the anonymous sub.  
         This update may cause minor changes to formatting of code with lists 
         of anonymous subs, especially TK code.

    - Fixed RT #88020. --converge was not working with wide characters.
    - Fixed RT #78156. package NAMESPACE VERSION syntax not accepted.
    - First attempt to fix RT #88588.  INDEX END tag change in pod2html breaks 
      perltidy -html. I put in a patch which should work but I don't yet have
      a way of testing it.

Sun Jun  9 14:59:59 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 20121207
    - The flag -cab=n or --comma-arrow-breakpoints=n has been generalized
      to give better control over breaking open short containers.  The
      possible values are now:

        n=0 break at all commas after =>  
        n=1 stable: break at all commas after => if container is open,
            EXCEPT FOR one-line containers
        n=2 break at all commas after =>, BUT try to form the maximum
            maximum one-line container lengths
        n=3 do not treat commas after => specially at all 
        n=4 break everything: like n=0 but also break a short container with
            a => not followed by a comma
        n=5 stable: like n=1 but ALSO break at open one-line containers (default)

      New values n=4 and n=5 have been added to allow short blocks to be
      broken open.  The new default is n=5, stable.  It should more closely
      follow the breaks in the input file, and previously formatted code
      should remain unchanged.  If this causes problems use -cab=1 to recover 
      the former behavior.  Thanks to Tony Maszeroski for the suggestion.

      To illustrate the need for the new options, if perltidy is given
      the following code, then the old default (-cab=1) was to close up 
      the 'index' container even if it was open in the source.  The new 
      default (-cab=5) will keep it open if it was open in the source.

       our $fancypkg = {
           'ALL' => {
               'index' => {
                   'key' => 'value',
               },
               'alpine' => {
                   'one'   => '+',
                   'two'   => '+',
                   'three' => '+',
               },
           }
       };

    - New debug flag --memoize (-mem).  This version contains a 
      patch supplied by Jonathan Swartz which can significantly speed up
      repeated calls to Perl::Tidy::perltidy in a single process by caching
      the result of parsing the formatting parameters.  A factor of up to 10
      speedup was achieved for masontidy (https://metacpan.org/module/masontidy).
      The memoization patch is on by default but can be deactivated for 
      testing with -nmem (or --no-memoize).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 19 10:50:16 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.de

- update to 20101217
   - added new flag -it=n or --iterations=n
   - A configuration file pathname begins with three dots, e.g.
     ".../.perltidyrc", indicates that the file should be searched for starting
     in the current directory and working upwards. 
   - Added flag --notidy which disables all formatting and causes the input to be
     copied unchanged. 
   - Added prefilters and postfilters in the call to the Tidy.pm module.
   - The starting indentation level of sections of code entabbed with -et=n
     is correctly guessed if it was also produced with the same -et=n flag.  This
     keeps the indentation stable on repeated formatting passes within an editor.
     Thanks to Sam Kington and Glenn.
   - Functions with prototype '&' had a space between the function and opening peren.
   - Patch to never put spaces around a bare word in braces beginning with ^
