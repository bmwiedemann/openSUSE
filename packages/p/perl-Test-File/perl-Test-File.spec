%description
This modules provides a collection of test utilities for file attributes.

Some file attributes depend on the owner of the process testing the file in
the same way the file test operators do. For instance, root (or super-user
or Administrator) may always be able to read files no matter the
permissions.

Some attributes don't make sense outside of Unix, either, so some tests
automatically skip if they think they won't work on the platform. If you
have a way to make these functions work on Windows, for instance, please
send me a patch. :) IF you want to pretend to be Windows on a non-Windows
machine (for instance, to test 'skip()'), you can set the
'PRETEND_TO_BE_WINDOWS' environment variable.

The optional NAME parameter for every function allows you to specify a name
for the test. If not supplied, a reasonable default will be generated.
