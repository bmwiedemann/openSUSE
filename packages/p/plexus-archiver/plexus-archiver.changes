    + Fix path traversal vulnerability (#261)
      The vulnerability affects only directories whose name begins
      with the same prefix as the destination directory. For example
      malicious archive may extract file in /opt/directory instead
      of /opt/dir.
- Changes of 4.6.2
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix regression in handling symbolic links. See
      codehaus-plexus/plexus-io#89
- Changes of 4.6.1
  * Bug Fixes

      was set and the existing files were older than the archive
      entry.
      Now it works as documented: older files are always overridden;
      when UnArchiver#isOverwrite is true, existing files are always
      overridden regardless if they are older or not.

    + Fix use of a mismatching Unicode path extra field in zip
      unarchiving (#167)
      In some cases zip archiver may update the file path but not
      the Unicode path extra field. This would result in Plexus
      Archiver extracting the file using wrong (obsolete) path.
      Now Plexus Archiver follows the specification and in this
      case will ignore the extra filed and extract the file in the
      correct location.

      (#155)

      getLoggerManager() method is not a method of the
      PlexusContainer interface, but of the DefaultPlexusContainer
      implementation
