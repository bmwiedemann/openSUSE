- Changes of 4.6.3
  * New features and improvements
    + Fix path traversal vulnerability (#261)
      The vulnerability affects only directories whose name begins
      with the same prefix as the destination directory. For example
      malicious archive may extract file in /opt/directory instead
      of /opt/dir.
- Changes of 4.6.2
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix regression in handling symbolic links. See
      codehaus-plexus/plexus-io#89
- Changes of 4.6.1
  * Bug Fixes
    + Normalize file separators before warning about equal archive
      entries (#249)

      Existing files were overridden only if UnArchiver#isOverwrite
      was set and the existing files were older than the archive
      entry.
      Now it works as documented: older files are always overridden;
      when UnArchiver#isOverwrite is true, existing files are always
      overridden regardless if they are older or not.

    + Speed improvements (#157)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix use of a mismatching Unicode path extra field in zip
      unarchiving (#167)
      In some cases zip archiver may update the file path but not
      the Unicode path extra field. This would result in Plexus
      Archiver extracting the file using wrong (obsolete) path.
      Now Plexus Archiver follows the specification and in this
      case will ignore the extra filed and extract the file in the
      correct location.

  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix unjustified warning about casing for directory entries
      (#155)
- Changes of 4.2.2

    + DirectoryArchiver fails for symlinks if a parent directory
      doesn't exist (#131)

    + rediff to changed context

Fri Mar  8 07:53:43 UTC 2019 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Initial packaging of plexus-archiver 3.6.0
- Generate and customize ant build file
- Make running of tests optional
- Added patches:
  * 0001-Remove-support-for-snappy.patch
    + When built without snappy support and trying to use Snappy,
      throw UnsupportedOperationException
  * logger-level.patch
    + Cast the result of getContainer() call, because the
      getLoggerManager() method is not a method of the
      PlexusContainer interface, but of the DefaultPlexusContainer
      implementation
