Tue Jan 30 17:57:19 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2024.0:
  * Add hook for ``cel-python``.
  * Add hook for ``eth_keys`` that collects package metadata for
    ``eth-keys >= 0.5.0``.
  * Add hook for ``fairscale`` to collect its source .py files for
    TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hook for ``pygwalker`` that collects data files from the package.
  * Add hook for ``PyTaskbar``
  * Add hook for ``detectron2`` to collect its source .py files for
    TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hook for ``fastai`` to collect its source .py files for
    TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hook for ``fvcore.nn`` to collect its source .py files for
    TorchScript/JIT. (`#676
  * Add hook for ``langchain`` that collects data files from the
    package.
  * Add hook for ``lightning`` (PyTorch Lightning) to ensure that
    its ``version.info`` data file is collected.
  * Add hook for ``linear_operator`` to collect its source .py
    files for TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hook for ``seedir`` that collects the ``words.txt`` data
    file from the package.
  * Add hook for ``timm`` (Hugging Face PyTorch Image Models) to
    collect its source .py files for TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hook for ``torchaudio`` that collects dynamically-loaded
    extensions, as well as source .py files for TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hook for ``torchtext`` that collects dynamically-loaded
    extensions, as well as source .py files for TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hook for ``torchvision.io.image`` to ensure that
    dynamically-loaded extension, required by this module, is
    collected.
  * Add hook for ``VADER``.
  * Add hook for Hugging Face ``datasets`` to collect its source
    .py files for TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hook for Hugging Face ``transformers``. The hook attempts
    to automatically collect the metadata of all dependencies (as
    declared in `deps` dictionary in the
    `transformers.dependency_versions_table` module), in order to
    make dependencies available at build time visible to
    ``transformers`` at run time. The hook also collects source .py
    files as some of the package's functionality uses
    TorchScript/JIT.
  * Add hooks for ``bitsandbytes``, and its dependency ``triton``.
    Both packages have dynamically-loaded extension libraries that
    need to be collected, and both require collection of source .py
    files for (``triton``'s) JIT module. Some submodules of
    ``triton`` need to be collected only as source .py files
    (bypassing PYZ archive), because the code naively assumes that
    ``__file__`` attribute points to the source .py file.
  * Add hooks for ``nvidia.*`` packages, which provide a way of
    installing CUDA via PyPI wheels

    requires PyInstaller >= 5.3 to work properly.
  * Many new hooks and hook updates, see upstream changelog

  * Updated hooks
  Extend the sounddevice and soundfile hooks to collect system-installed shared libraries in cases when the libraries are
  not bundled with the package (i.e., linux PyPI wheels, Anaconda on all OSes). (#487)
  Fix a TypeError raised by the clr hook when pythonnet dist lacks the file list metadata. (#486)
  Have clr hook check for availability of the pythonnet before trying to query its metadata. Fixes an importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError
  raised by the clr hook when the hook is triggered by a module or a package named clr other than the clr extension module from pythonnet. (#486)
  Have the pyqtgraph hook collect the colormap files and their license files from the package. (#501)
  Implement preliminary support for handling subprocesses used by pyqtgraph.multiprocess, for example in pyqtgraph RemoteGraphicsView widget.
  The user is still required to ensure that stdlib's multiprocessing.freeze_support is called in the entry-point script before using pyqtgraph.
  In addition, with onefile builds, the user must set the _MEIPASS2 environment variable to the value of sys._MEIPASS before using pyqtgraph. (#501)
  In clr hook for pythonnet collect the Python.Runtime.dll as a data file on non-Windows OSes to prevent errors during binary dependency analysis. (#500)
