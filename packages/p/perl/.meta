  <description>perl - Practical Extraction and Report Language

Perl is optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting
information from those text files, and printing reports based on that
information.  It is also good for many system management tasks. Perl is
intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, and complete) rather
than beautiful (tiny, elegant, and minimal).

Some of the modules available on CPAN can be found in the &quot;perl&quot;
series.</description>
