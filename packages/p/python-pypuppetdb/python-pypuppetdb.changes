  * Fix bug with parsing results from inventory endpoint

- Build version 0.3.2

  * Fixed noop puppet runs reporting unchanged instead of noop.
  * Fixed unreported nodes shown as 'noop' in puppetdb > 4.1.0.
  * Add Inventory API endpoint for PuppetDB 4.2.0.
  * Support for producer field on catalogs, facts and report types.

- Build version 0.3.1

  * Fixed a datetime related bug in :func:`pypuppetdb.api.nodes()` that caused
    all returned nodes to be an unreported status

- Build version 0.3.0

  * New QueryBuilder module allows users to build PuppetDB queries in an
    Object-Oriented fashion.
  * Adding support for new fields provided in PuppetDB 4.1.0.

- Build version 0.2.3

  * Removed deprecation of :func:`pypuppetdb.types.Report.events()`. Expanded
    resource events data timestamps are not parseable.
  * Escaping additional path parameters passed to _url() with urllib.quote

- Build version 0.2.2

  * Fixed URL Encoding found when querying the specific value of a macaddress
    fact.
  * Adding support for PuppetDB 4.0.0 information. Namely Adding a catalog_uuid
    attribute to the Catalog type object. Adding code_id, catalog_uuid and
    cached_catalog_status attributes to the Report type object.
  * Removing unneeded sudo option from .travis.yml, this gave unnecessary
    warning in the test environment.
  * Updating the files under docs/ so https://pypuppetdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

    None but is given a real value from the field of the same name in the
    Nodes endpoint available in PuppetDB 3.2 or higher.
  * Allowing support for 'GET' AND 'POST' requests in the api _query()
    function. This will allow clients to send requests to the PuppetDB that
    are too long for a GEt request query string
  * Adding a node field, code_id, to the Catalog object using the field of
    the same name from the Catalogs endpoint (currently unused as of
    PuppetDB 3.2.2)
  * Adding test cases for new features EXCEPT the GET and POST update.

- Build version 0.2.0

  * Version bump to 0.2.0
  * Adding support for v4 of the Query API
  * Removing v2 and v3 api functions as per changelog
  * pypuppetdb will no longer support multiple API versions, removing the
    api_version attribute from pypuppetdb.connect()
  * All clients must remove the api_version attribute from the connect function,
    or the starting number, since it is no longer supported
  * Removing all NotImplemented errors in the function of BaseAPI and filled
    them with the real code
