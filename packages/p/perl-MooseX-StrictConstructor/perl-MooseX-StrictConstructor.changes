- updated to 0.21
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-MooseX-StrictConstructor/Changes

  0.21     2017-02-09
  
  - The last release accidentally added Moo as a hard prereq when it's only
    needed for testing. Patched by Karen Etheride (GH #4).
  
  
  0.20     2017-02-09
  
  - Repository has moved to the GitHub Moose organization
  
  - Added support for __no_BUILD__ as a constructor argument to skip calling any
    BUILD subs (used internally by modules like Moo that have their own
    implementation of calling BUILD). Reported and patched by Karen Etheridge
    (RT#120124, GH #1).

Sat Jul 27 11:58:34 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.19
 - The 0.17 release broke compatibility with pre-2.0 versions of Moose.
 - A small internal tweak which prevents the MooseX::ClassCompositor tests from
   failing.
 - Added a small optimization for an immutable constructor when used with Moose
   2.00+. The list of valid attributes is only generated once, rather than each
   time the constructor is run. Reported by Chip Salzenberg. RT #73664.

Sat Apr 30 00:08:51 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.16:
  * don't wrap BUILDALL, since this breaks if the object doesn't inherit from
    Moose::Object

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 22 07:30:49 UTC 2011 - coolo@opensuse.org

- updated to 0.15
  - The fix in 0.14 only worked with Moose 2.0, causing failures with earlier
    versions.
  
  - Using extends caused strictness to be lost. Fixed by Karen Etheridge.
  
  - This release provides forward compatibility with Moose 1.99+. It will still
    work with Moose 1.23 as well. Most of the work was done by Jesse Luehrs.
  
  - Switched tests to use Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception.
