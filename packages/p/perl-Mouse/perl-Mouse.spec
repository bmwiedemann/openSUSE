%description
Moose is a postmodern object system for Perl5. Moose is wonderful.

Unfortunately, Moose has a compile-time penalty. Though significant
progress has been made over the years, the compile time penalty is a
non-starter for some very specific applications. If you are writing a
command-line application or CGI script where startup time is essential, you
may not be able to use Moose (we recommend that you instead use persistent
Perl executing environments like 'FastCGI' for the latter, if possible).

Mouse is a Moose compatible object system, which aims to alleviate this
penalty by providing a subset of Moose's functionality.

We're also going as light on dependencies as possible. Mouse currently has
*no dependencies* except for building/testing modules. Mouse also works
without XS, although it has an XS backend to make it much faster.
