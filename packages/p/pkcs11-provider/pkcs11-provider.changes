- Update to 1.0:
  * Improved compatibility with PKCS#11 spec and historical module behavior in
    interpreting CKA_EC_POINT, thie handled incompatibilities in ECDSA/ECDH
    keys.
  * Added full RSA-PSS support
  * Fixed several issues with using keypairs after generation and loading of
    related public keys, espcially with the way OpenSSL handles ECDH peer key
    creation.
  * Fixed issues with EdDSA signatures
  * Expanded CI/testsuite with tlsfuzzer and more teting for Ed448 and other
    key types/operations
  * We test three different software tokens with 4 different test
    configurations
  * For a full list of changes see: https://github.com/latchset/pkcs11-provider/releases/tag/v1.0
- Remove patch explicit-EC-test-option.patch

Tue Dec 17 16:48:03 UTC 2024 - Lucas Mulling <lucas.mulling@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6:
  * TLS 1.3 is now supported via token handling (KDFs etc..)
  * A new feature to prevent PIN lockouts when the token correctly signals
    authentication attempts depletion via token info.
  * Several issues with handling keys related to run a full end-to-end TLS
    connection on the token have been fixed
  * Most cases when early loading was needed have been resolved, HTTP and Bind
    for example work without specifying early loading for the provider
  * Several memory leaks have been resolved
  * Several new tests including a whole new token (kryoptic) are tested now, as
    well as tlsfuzzer against a TLS server deferring all operations to the
    tokens.
  * For a full list of changes see: https://github.com/latchset/pkcs11-provider/releases/tag/v0.6
- Includes changes from 0.5 and 0.4
  * We moved the build system to Meson
  * A feature to embed pkcs11- URIs into "fake" PEM files has been added which
    makes it possible to transparently use the provider with many tools that
    accept keys only as PEM files.
  * For a full list of changes see:
    https://github.com/latchset/pkcs11-provider/releases/tag/v0.5
    https://github.com/latchset/pkcs11-provider/releases/tag/v0.4
- Add pkcs11-provider.keyring
- Enable unit testing for softokn and softhsm
- Add patch
