  <title>Python 3 compatible Python 2 random Module</title>
  <description>This package provides a Python 3 ported version of Python 2.7's random module. It has also been back-ported to work in Python 2.6.

In Python 3, the implementation of randrange() was changed, so that even with the same seed you get different sequences in Python 2 and 3. Note that several high-level functions such as randint() and choice() use randrange().

In my testing code I heavily rely on stable random generator results and it makes porting code to Python 3 a lot harder, if all those tests have to be adjusted. This package fixes that.</description>
