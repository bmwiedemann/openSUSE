%description
This package provides a Python 3 ported version of Python 2.7's random module.
It has also been back-ported to work in Python 2.6.

In Python 3, the implementation of randrange() was changed, so that even with
the same seed you get different sequences in Python 2 and 3. Note that several
high-level functions such as randint() and choice() use randrange().

In my testing code I heavily rely on stable random generator results and it
makes porting code to Python 3 a lot harder, if all those tests have to be
adjusted. This package fixes that.
