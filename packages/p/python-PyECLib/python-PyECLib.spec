%description
This library makes use of Jesasure for Reed-Solomon as implemented by the
liberasurecode library and provides its' own flat XOR-based erasure code
encoder and decoder.  Currently, it implements a specific class of HD
Combination Codes (see "Flat XOR-based erasure codes in storage systems:
Constructions, efficient recovery, and tradeoffs" in IEEE MSST 2010).  These
codes are well-suited to archival use-cases, have a simple construction and
require a minimum number of participating disks during single-disk
reconstruction (think XOR-based LRC code).
