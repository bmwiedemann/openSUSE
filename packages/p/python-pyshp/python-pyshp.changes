- Update to version 2.1.0
  + New Features:
    * Added back read/write support for unicode field names. 
    * Improved Record representation
    * More support for geojson on Reader, ShapeRecord, ShapeRecords, and shapes()
  + Bug fixes:
    * Fixed error when reading optional m-values
    * Fixed Record attribute autocomplete in Python 3
    * Misc readme cleanup
- Update to version 2.0.1
  + Fix pip install setup.py README decoding error. 
- Update to version 2.0.0
  + New Features:
    * Full support for unicode text, with custom encoding, and exception handling. 
      > Means that the Reader returns unicode, and the Writer accepts unicode. 
    * PyShp has been simplified to a pure input-output library using the Reader and Writer classes, dropping the Editor class. 
    * Switched to a new streaming approach when writing files, keeping memory-usage at a minimum:
      > Specify filepath/destination and text encoding when creating the Writer. 
      > The file is written incrementally with each call to shape/record. 
      > Adding shapes is now done using dedicated methods for each shapetype. 
    * Reading shapefiles is now more convenient:
      > Shapefiles can be opened using the context manager, and files are properly closed. 
      > Shapefiles can be iterated, have a length, and supports the geo interface. 
      > New ways of inspecing shapefile metadata by printing. [@megies]
      > More convenient accessing of Record values as attributes. [@philippkraft]
      > More convenient shape type name checking. [@megies] 
    * Add more support and documentation for MultiPatch 3D shapes. 
    * The Reader "elevation" and "measure" attributes now renamed "zbox" and "mbox", to make it clear they refer to the min/max values. 
    * Better documentation of previously unclear aspects, such as field types. 
  + Bug Fixes:
    * More reliable/robust:
      > Fixed shapefile bbox error for empty or point type shapefiles. [@mcuprjak]
      > Reading and writing Z and M type shapes is now more robust, fixing many errors, and has been added to the documentation. [@ShinNoNoir]
      > Improved parsing of field value types, fixed errors and made more flexible. 
      > Fixed bug when writing shapefiles with datefield and date values earlier than 1900 [@megies]
    * Fix some geo interface errors, including checking polygon directions.
    * Bug fixes for reading from case sensitive file names, individual files separately, and from file-like objects. [@gastoneb, @kb003308, @erickskb]
    * Enforce maximum field limit. [@mwtoews]
- Update to version 1.2.11

  * Fixed misc data type errors.
  * Fixed error when reading files with wrong record length.
  * Use max field precision when saving decimal numbers. 
  * Improved shapetype detection.
