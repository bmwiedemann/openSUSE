- Update to 5.6.0

    (:ghpull:`10813`).

    to allow a smoother transition to new input processing machinery planned for
    IPython 7 (:ghpull:`11044`).
  * IPython should start faster, as it no longer looks for all available pygments
    styles on startup (:ghpull:`10859`).

- Update to IPython 5.0
  + IPython 5 features a major upgrade to the terminal interface, bringing live
    syntax highlighting as you type, proper multiline editing and multiline paste,
    and tab completions that don't clutter up your history.
  + Backwards incompatible changes
    * The ``%install_ext`` magic function, deprecated since 4.0, has now been deleted.
      You can distribute and install extensions as packages on PyPI.
    * Callbacks registered while an event is being handled will now only be called
      for subsequent events; previously they could be called for the current event.
      Similarly, callbacks removed while handling an event *will* always get that
      event. See :ghissue:`9447` and :ghpull:`9453`.
    * Integration with pydb has been removed since pydb development has been stopped
      since 2012, and pydb is not installable from PyPI.
    * The ``autoedit_syntax`` option has apparently been broken for many years.
      It has been removed.
    * The overhaul of the terminal interface will probably cause a range of minor
      issues for existing users.
    * IPython no longer uses readline configuration (``~/.inputrc``). We hope that
      the functionality you want (e.g. vi input mode) will be available by configuring
      IPython directly (see :doc:`/config/options/terminal`).
    * The ``PromptManager`` class has been removed, and the prompt machinery simplified.
    * There are new options to configure the colours used in syntax highlighting.
      We have tried to integrate them with our classic  ``--colors`` option and
     ``%colors`` magic, but there's a mismatch in possibilities, so some configurations
     may produce unexpected results. See :ref:`termcolour` for more information.
    * The new interface is not compatible with Emacs 'inferior-shell' feature. To
      continue using this, add the ``--simple-prompt`` flag to the command Emacs
      runs. This flag disables most IPython features, relying on Emacs to provide
      things like tab completion.
  + Provisional Changes
    * When running via the Jupyter notebook interfaces, or other compatible client,
      you can enable rich documentation experimental functionality:
      When the ``docrepr`` package is installed setting the boolean flag
      ``InteractiveShell.sphinxify_docstring`` to ``True``, will process the various
      object through sphinx before displaying them (see the ``docrepr`` package
      documentation for more information.
  + Deprecated Features
    * ``hooks.fix_error_editor`` seems unused and is pending deprecation.
    * `IPython/core/excolors.py:ExceptionColors` is  deprecated.
    * `IPython.core.InteractiveShell:write()` is deprecated; use `sys.stdout` instead.
    * `IPython.core.InteractiveShell:write_err()` is deprecated; use `sys.stderr` instead.
    * The `formatter` keyword argument to `Inspector.info` in `IPython.core.oinspec` has no effect.
    * The `global_ns` keyword argument of IPython Embed was deprecated, and has no effect. Use `module` keyword argument instead.
- Update to IPython 4.2
  * Fix ``ipython -i`` on errors, which was broken in 4.1.
  * The delay meant to highlight deprecated commands that have moved to jupyter has been removed.
  * Improve compatibility with future versions of traitlets and matplotlib.
  * Use stdlib :func:`python:shutil.get_terminal_size` to measure terminal width when displaying tracebacks
    (provided by ``backports.shutil_get_terminal_size`` on Python 2).
- Update to IPython 4.1.2
  * fixes installation issues with some versions of setuptools.
