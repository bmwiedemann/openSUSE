Tue Jun  4 03:19:44 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 8.25.0:
  * Rplaces the unicode micro symbol with greek letter mu, visually
    identical but should fix nfkc normalisations issues.
  * Introduces intersphinx_registry as a new dependency which is recommended
    only to build documentation.
  * Improve inference from return type annotations in completer and the
    introduction of the optional target ipython[matplotlib] to explicitly
    request the matplotlib optional dependencies.
  * Move of the matplotlib backend handling from IPython to matplotlib.
  * pytest 8 compatibility.
  * typing-extension now needs 4.6 or newer. It was already the case, but
    not explicated.
  * Attempt to speed running code under debugger in some cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 29 17:16:13 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.22.2
  * Fix recently introduced bug with the store magic.
  * Fix issues with multiple call to
    matplotlib.pyplot.switch_backend
  * Fix crashing IPython when some tracebacks encounter dynamically
    evaluated code.
  * IPython 8.22.1 increase the minimal traitlets version, and
    8.22.2 fix a critical bug on emscripten preventing to use some
    magics like %matplotlib on jupyter-light.
  * As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under the
    8.22 milestone.
  ## API changes
  * One of the largest change is the update the mimehooks and
    inspector API, see 14342. It should be backward compatible, but
    many hooks now receive a single object with many fields
    allowing us flexibility to update the API later.
  ## Packaging changes
  * Thanks to @mkoppe, we are slowly getting rid of setup.py
    finally migrating to pyproject.toml. There is still quite a bit
    of work, and please open an issue if you encounter any problem.
  ## Deprecation
  * A number of unused functions have been marked deprecated or
    pending deprecation. Please let us know if you encounter any of
    those deprecation messages for us to adjust the removal
    timeline.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 15:55:42 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.21.0
  * Few new features are present, but the codebase has been
    cleaned, and a couple of API are _considered_ for deprecation.
    They are not deprecated yet, but as they do not seem to be
    quite used, they may emit a warning, in which case please
    comment on the relevant issue to inform me of _which_ project
    use those feature and how you use them. Depending on the
    feedback I might change the timeline for deprecation.
  ## Deprecations
  * PR #14307 Pending Deprecation of
    ColorSchemeTable.set_active_scheme(...)’s case_sensitive
    Parameter.
  * PR #14305 Pending Deprecation of constructing ColorScheme via
    kwargs, in favor passing a single dict.
  ## Fixes
  * PR #14284 TerminalIPythonApp’s would warn that auto_create
    option is not recognized.
  * PR #14286 Fix a crash with NotOneValueFound when rendering
    complex tracebacks.
  * PR #14287 Partial Python 3.13 compatibility
  * PR #14290 Docs/Typos.
  * PR #14289 ipdb.set_trace() now accepts header= for better
    compatibility with pdb.set_trace()
  ## Changes
  * PR #14300 and PR #14301 Add hooking ability to produce
    mimebundle. It is now possible to extend the ?/?? operator to
    return more mimetypes to render richer help in frontends that
    support it. In particular you could send a json representation
    of the help that could be displayed in a customizable way.
- Release 8.20.0
  * The crux of this release is PR #14274 (Inspect continuation
    prompt signature and pass only viable arguments), the rest of
    the changes are mostly type annotation, and a few compatibility
    issues with Python 3.13 that are getting addressed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 23 18:49:41 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.19.0
  * New release of IPython a bit before the end of the month, and
    end of the year.
  * Mostly cleanup and deprecation, due to upstream deprecation and
    removal.
  * A bit later than originally plan, IPython 8.19 does not support
    Python 3.9 anymore, as well as the few conditional code that
    were executing only on Python 3.9. #14254
  * We used the opportunity to deprecate IPython.utils.tz #14256,
    due to upstream deprecation of some timezone utilities. It will
    be removed at a later date.
  * Thanks to the contribution of cohml, IPython CLI now support
    absolute and relative line numbers in both vi and emacs prompt,
    use for example
    c.TerminalInteractiveShell
     .prompt_line_number_format='{line:4d}/{rel_line:+03d} | '
    configuration option to display both in a custom format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 26 15:34:52 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.18.0
  * Small release of IPython that fixes a small number of
    inconveniences.
  * PR #14251 Fix a memory leak in qt event loop integration by
    setting the Loop parent to None.
  * PR #14252 Pickleshare was made an optional dependency in 8.17,
    this leads to warnings in some installations when using modules
    completions. The warning has been silenced.
  * PR #14241 Update event loop code for compatibility with more
    recent prompt_toolkit due to deprecations in Python 3.12.
  * PR #14245 Fix doc example on Pygments styles
  * PR #14238 Remove dependency on app_nope, this is actually only
    a dependency of IPykernel.
- Release 8.17, 8.17.1
  * Medium-sized release of IPython that includes some cleanup
    (backcall, python2 leftovers) and some refactoring improvements
    (typing, pathlib) and a fix on completion.
  * PR #14216 remove backcall dependency
  * PR #14217 make pickleshare dependency optional
  * PR #14185 support completion based on type annotations of calls
  * Reverted in 8.17.1:PR #14190 remove support for python 2 in
    lexers (reverted in  8.17.1 as it is imported by
    qtconsole/spyder)
  * Mamba and Micromamba magic: In addition to the conda command to
    manage conda environment, mamba and micromamba can now be used
    using the corresponding magic in IPython. Since these commands
    are compatible with conda, they are following the same logic.
    These two magic require to have the corresponding commands
    available either in the conda environment or system wide. PR
    #14191

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 11 19:44:22 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.14.0
  * PR #14080 fixes some shortcuts issues.
  * PR #14056 Add option to %autoreload to hide errors when
    reloading code.
  * PR #14039 (and PR #14040) to show exception notes in
    tracebacks.
  * PR #14076 Add option to EventManager to prevent printing
  ## SPEC 0 and SPEC 4
  * You’ve heard about the NEPs, (NumPy enhancement Proposal),
    having a NEP for something non-numpy specific was sometime
    confusing. Long live the SPECs.
  * We are now trying to follow SPEC 0 (aka old NEP 29) for of
    support of upstream libraries.
  * We also now try to follow SPEC 4 (test and publish nightly on a
    centralized nightly repository). We encourage you to do so as
    well in order to report breakage, and contribute to the SPEC
    process !
  ## Python 3.12 compatibility ?
  * Python 3.12 changed its tokenizer to have better support for
    f-strings and allow arbitrary expression. This is a great new
    feature and performance improvement in python 3.12.
  * Unfortunately this means the new tokenizer does not support
    incomplete or invalid Python which will break many features of
    IPython. Thus compatibility of IPython with Python 3.12 is not
    guarantied. It is unclear to which extent IPython is affected,
    and whether we can/should try to still support magics, shell
    escape (! ....), …, as well as how to do it if we can.
  * In addition even if we there is technical feasibility to do so,
    it is no clear we have the resources to do it. We are thus
    looking for your help if you can _test_ on Python 3.12 to see
    to which extent this affects users and which features are
    critical.
  * We are not going to pin IPython to Python <3.12 as otherwise on
    install pip would downgrade/resolve to IPython 8.13, so if you
    plan to update to Python 3.12 after its release, we encourage
    for extra care.

   * PR #13973 We are slowly migrating IPython internals to use
     proper type objects/dataclasses instead of dictionaries to
     allow static typing checks. These are technically public API
     and could lead to breakage, so please let us know if that’s
     the case and I’ll mitigate.

Sun Feb  5 15:17:20 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.9.0
  * Second release of IPython in 2023, last Friday of the month, we
    are back on track. This is a small release with a few
    bug-fixes, and improvements, mostly with respect to terminal
    shortcuts.
  * The biggest improvement for 8.9 is a drastic amelioration if
    the auto-suggestions sponsored by D.E. Shaw and implemented by
    the more and more active contributor @krassowski.
    - right accepts a single character from suggestion
    - ctrl+right accepts a semantic token (macos default shortcuts
      take precedence and need to be disabled to make this work)
    - backspace deletes a character and resumes hinting
      autosuggestions
    - ctrl-left accepts suggestion and moves cursor left one
      character.
    - backspace deletes a character and resumes hinting
      autosuggestions
    - down moves to suggestion to later in history when no lines
      are present below the cursors.
    - up moves to suggestion from earlier in history when no lines
      are present above the cursor.
  * This is best described by the Gif posted by @krassowski, and in
    the PR itself PR gh#ipython/ipython#13888.
  * Please report any feedback in order for us to improve the user
    experience. In particular we are also working on making the
    shortcuts configurable.
  * If you are interested into better terminal shortcut, I also
    invite you to participate in issue gh#ipython/iüythpn#13879.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  5 19:43:48 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 8.6.0:
  * The install_ext and related functions have been removed after
    being deprecated for years. You can use pip to install
    extensions. pip did not exists when install_ext was
    introduced. You can still load local extensions without installing
    them. Just set your sys.path for example. :ghpull:`13744`
  * The completer matcher API have been improved. See
    :ghpull:`13745`. This should improve the type inference and
    improve dict keys completions in many use case. Tanks @krassowski
    for all the works, and the D.E. Shaw group for sponsoring it.
  * The color of error nodes in tracebacks can now be customized. See
    :ghpull:`13756`. This is a private attribute until someone find
    the time to properly add a configuration option. Note that with
    Python 3.11 that also show the relevant nodes in traceback, it
    would be good to leverage this informations (plus the "did you
    mean" info added on attribute errors). But that's likely work I
    won't have time to do before long, so contributions welcome.
  * As we follow NEP 29, we removed support for numpy 1.19
    :ghpull:`13760`.
  * The open() function present in the user namespace by default will
    now refuse to open the file descriptors 0,1,2 (stdin, out, err),
    to avoid crashing IPython. This mostly occurs in teaching context
    when incorrect values get passed around.
  * The ?, ??, and corresponding pinfo, pinfo2 magics can now find
    objects insides arrays. That is to say, the following now works:
     >>> def my_func(*arg, **kwargs):pass
     >>> container = [my_func]
     >>> container[0]?
  * If container define a custom getitem, this __will__ trigger the
    custom method. So don't put side effects in your getitems. Thanks
    the D.E. Shaw group for the request and sponsoring the work.

- specfile:
  * remove patch ipython-pr13714-xxlimited.patch; included upstream
  * update required versions

- update to version 8.5.0:
  * Added shortcut for accepting auto suggestion. The End key shortcut
    for accepting auto-suggestion This binding works in Vi mode too,
    provided TerminalInteractiveShell.emacs_bindings_in_vi_insert_mode
    is set to be True :ghpull:`13566`.
  * No popup in window for latex generation w hen generating latex
    (e.g. via _latex_repr_) no popup window is shows under
    Windows. :ghpull:`13679`
  * Fixed error raised when attempting to tab-complete an input string
    with consecutive periods or forward slashes (such as
    "file:///var/log/..."). :ghpull:`13675`
  * Relative filenames in Latex rendering : The latex_to_png_dvipng
    command internally generates input and output file arguments to
    latex and dvipis. These arguments are now generated as relative
    files to the current working directory instead of absolute file
    paths. This solves a problem where the current working directory
    contains characters that are not handled properly by latex and
    dvips. There are no changes to the user API. :ghpull:`13680`
  * Stripping decorators bug: Fixed bug which meant that ipython code
    blocks in restructured text documents executed with the
    ipython-sphinx extension skipped any lines of code containing
    python decorators. :ghpull:`13612`
  * Allow some modules with frozen dataclasses to be

Thu Jan 20 10:19:48 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.0.1
  * Security fix CVE-2022-21699: change some default values in
    order to prevent potential Execution with Unnecessary
    Privileges.
  * Almost all version of IPython looks for configuration and
    profiles in current working directory. Since IPython was
    developed before pip and environments existed it was used a
    convenient way to load code/packages in a project dependant
    way.
  * In 2022, it is not necessary anymore, and can lead to confusing
    behavior where for example cloning a repository and starting
    IPython or loading a notebook from any Jupyter-Compatible
    interface that has ipython set as a kernel can lead to code
    execution.
  * The current working directory is not searched anymore for
    profiles or configurations files.
  * Added a __patched_cves__ attribute (set of strings) to IPython
    module that contain the list of fixed CVE. This is
    informational only.

Sun Dec 19 19:24:08 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.30.1
  * IPython 7.30 fixes a couple of bugs introduce in previous
    releases (in particular with respect to path handling), and
    introduce a few features and improvements:
  * Notably we will highlight PR #13267 “Document that %run can
    execute notebooks and ipy scripts.”, which is the first commit
    of Fernando Pérez since mid 2016 (IPython 5.1). If you are new
    to IPython, Fernando created IPython in 2001. The other most
    recent contribution of Fernando to IPython itself was May 2018,
    by reviewing and merging PRs. I want to note that Fernando is
    still active but mostly as a mentor and leader of the whole
    Jupyter organisation, but we’re still happy to see him
    contribute code !
  * PR #13290 “Use sphinxify (if available) in object_inspect_mime
    path” should allow richer Repr of docstrings when using
    jupyterlab inspector.
  * PR #13311 make the debugger use ThreadPoolExecutor for debugger
    cmdloop. This should fix some issues/infinite loop, but let us
    know if you come across any regressions. In particular this
    fixes issues with kmaork/madbg, a remote debugger for IPython.
  * Note that this is likely the ante-penultimate release of
    IPython 7.x as a stable branch, as I hope to release IPython
    8.0 as well as IPython 7.31 next month/early 2022.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 12 21:30:44 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.29.0
  * IPython 7.29 brings a couple of new functionalities to IPython
    and a number of bugfixes. It is one of the largest recent
    release, relatively speaking, with close to 15 Pull Requests.
  * fix an issue where base64 was returned instead of bytes when
    showing figures
  * fix compatibility with PyQt6, PySide 6. This
    may be of interest if you are running on Apple Silicon as only
    qt6.2+ is natively compatible.
  * fix matplotlib qtagg eventloop
  * Multiple docs fixes, typos, ... etc.
  * Debugger will now exit by default on SigInt
    this will be useful in notebook/lab if you forgot to exit the
    debugger. "Interrupt Kernel" will now exist the debugger.
  * It give Pdb the ability to skip code in decorators. If
    functions contain a special value names __debuggerskip__ =
    True|False, the function will not be stepped into, and Pdb will
    step into lower frames only if the value is set to False. The
    exact behavior is still likely to have corner cases and will be
    refined in subsequent releases. Feedback welcome. See the
    debugger module documentation for more info. Thanks to the D.
    E. Shaw group for funding this feature.

  * Add support for GTK4 :ghpull:`131011`
  * Add support for Qt6 :ghpull:`13085`
  * Fix an issue with pip magic on windows :ghpull:`13093`

- changes from version 7.26.0:
  * We'll highlight this issue
    <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/13039> pointing out we
    were including and refereeing to code from Stack Overflow which
    was CC-BY-SA, hence incompatible with the BSD license of
    IPython. This lead us to a rewriting of the corresponding logic
    which in our case was done in a more efficient way (in our case we
    were searching string prefixes instead of full strings).
  * You will notice also a number of documentation improvements and
    cleanup.
  * Of particular interest are the following Pull-requests:
    + The IPython directive now uses Sphinx logging for
      warnings. :ghpull:`13030`.
    + Add expiry days option to pastebin magic and change http
      protocol to https. :ghpull:`13056`

    + Minimum jedi version is now 0.16. :ghpull:`12488`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  1 22:10:57 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 7.17.0:
  * IPython 7.17 brings a couple of new improvements to API and a
    couple of user facing changes to make the terminal experience more
    user friendly.
  * :ghpull:`12407` introduces the ability to pass extra argument to
    the IPython debugger class; this is to help a new project from
    kmaork (https://github.com/kmaork/madbg) to feature a fully remote
    debugger.
  * :ghpull:`12410` finally remove support for 3.6, while the codebase
    is still technically compatible; IPython will not install on
    Python 3.6.
  * lots of work on the debugger and hidden frames from @impact27 in
    :ghpull:`12437`, :ghpull:`12445`, :ghpull:`12460` and in
    particular :ghpull:`12453` which make the debug magic more robust
    at handling spaces.
  * Biggest API addition is code transformation which is done before
    code execution; IPython allows a number of hooks to catch
    non-valid Python syntax (magic, prompt
    stripping...etc). Transformers are usually called many time;
    typically:
    + When trying to figure out whether the code is complete and valid
      (should we insert a new line or execute ?)
    + During actual code execution pass before giving the code to
      Python's exec.
  * This lead to issues when transformer might have had side effects;
    or do external queries. Starting with IPython 7.17 you can expect
    your transformer to be called less time.
  * Input transformers are now called only once in the execution path
    of InteractiveShell, allowing to register transformer that
    potentially have side effects (note that this is not
    recommended). Internal methods should_run_async, and
    run_cell_async now take a recommended optional transformed_cell,
    and preprocessing_exc_tuple parameters that will become mandatory
    at some point in the future; that is to say cells need to be
    explicitly transformed to be valid Python syntax ahead of trying
    to run them. :ghpull:`12440`;
  * input_transformers can now also have an attribute has_side_effects
    set to True, when this attribute is present; this will prevent the
    transformers from being ran when IPython is trying to guess
    whether the user input is complete. Note that this may means you
    will need to explicitly execute in some case where your
    transformations are now not ran; but will not affect users with no
    custom extensions.

- Update to 7.11.1
  * A couple of deprecated functions (no-op) have been reintroduces in py3compat as
   Cython was still relying on them, and will be removed in a couple of versions.
- Update to 7.11.0
  * A number of function in the ``py3compat`` have been removed; a number of types
    in the IPython code base are now non-ambiguous and now always ``unicode``
    instead of ``Union[Unicode,bytes]``; many of the relevant code path have thus
    been simplified/cleaned and types annotation added.
  * IPython support several verbosity level from exceptions. ``xmode plain`` now
    support chained exceptions.
  * We are starting to remove ``shell=True`` in some usages of subprocess. While not directly
    a security issue (as IPython is made to run arbitrary code anyway) it is not good
    practice and we'd like to show the example.
  * Work around some bugs in Python 3.9 tokenizer
  * IPython will now print its version after a crash.
- Update to 7.10.2
  * IPython 7.10.2 fix a couple of extra incompatibility between IPython, ipdb,
    asyncio and Prompt Toolkit 3.
- Update to IPython 7.10.1

  * Previously, we provided completion for a unicode name with its
    relative symbol.With this, now IPython provides complete
    suggestions to unicode name symbols.
  * Make audio normalization optional
  * Miscelanious
    + Fix improper acceptation of "return" outside of
      functions. :ghpull:`11641`.

      failure.  :ghpull:`11613`.
    + Fix Bug where "type?" woudl crash IPython. :ghpull:`1608`.

Fri Mar  1 18:00:07 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 7.3.0:
  * The biggest change to this release is the implementation of the
    "%conda" and "%pip" magics, that will attempt to install packages
    in the **current environment**. You may still need to restart your
    interpreter or kernel for the change to be taken into account, but
    it should simplify installation of packages into remote
    environment. Installing using pip/conda from the command line is
    still the prefer method.
  * The "%pip" magic was already present, but was only printing a
    warning; now it will actually forward commands to pip.
  * Misc bug fixes and improvements:
    + Compatibility with Python 3.8.
    + Do not expand shell variable in execution magics, and added the
      "no_var_expand" decorator for magic requiring a similar
      functionality :ghpull:`11516`
    + Add "%pip" and "%conda" magic :ghpull:`11524`
    + Re-initialize posix aliases after a "%reset" :ghpull:`11528`
    + Allow the IPython command line to run "*.ipynb" files
      :ghpull:`11529`

  + Notable Changes
    * Major update of "latex to unicode" tab completion map (see below)
  + Notable New Features:
    * Restore functionality and documentation of the **sphinx directive**, which
      is now stricter (fail on error by daefault), has new configuration options,
      has a brand new documentation page :ref:`ipython_directive` (which needs
      some cleanup). It is also now *tested* so we hope to have less regressions.
     :ghpull:`11402`
    * ``IPython.display.Video`` now supports ``width`` and ``height`` arguments,
      allowing a custom width and height to be set instead of using the video's
      width and height. :ghpull:`11353`
    * Warn when using ``HTML('<iframe>')`` instead of ``IFrame`` :ghpull:`11350`
    * Allow Dynamic switching of editing mode between vi/emacs and show
      normal/input mode in prompt when using vi. :ghpull:`11390`. Use ``%config
      TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode = 'vi'`` or ``%config
      TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode = 'emacs'`` to dynamically switch
      between modes.
  + Notable Fixes:
    * Fix entering of **multi-line blocks in terminal** IPython, and various
      crashes in the new input transformation machinery :ghpull:`11354`,
      :ghpull:`11356`, :ghpull:`11358`. These also fix a **Compatibility bug
      with Python 3.7.1**.
    * Fix moving through generator stack in ipdb :ghpull:`11266`

      mode. :ghpull:`11382`
    * Fix mishandling of magics and ``= !`` assignment just after a dedent in
      nested code blocks :ghpull:`11418`
    * Fix instructions for custom shortcuts :ghpull:`11426`
  + Notable Internals improvements:
    * Use of ``os.scandir`` (Python 3 only) to speed up some file system operations.
      :ghpull:`11365`
    * use ``perf_counter`` instead of ``clock`` for more precise
      timing results with ``%time`` :ghpull:`11376`
- Remove upstream-included fix_test_history.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 16 01:17:20 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 7.0.1
  Highlights
  * IPython 7.0+ now uses prompt_toolkit 2.0
  * IPython can automatically await code at top level, you should
    not need to access an event loop or runner yourself.
  * The magic %autoreload 2 now captures new methods added to
    classes. Earlier, only methods existing as of the initial
    import were being tracked and updated.
  * The autoindent feature that was deprecated in 5.x was
    re-enabled and un-deprecated.
  * Make %run -n -i ... work correctly. Earlier, if %run was
    passed both arguments, -n would be silently ignored.
  * The %%script (as well as %%bash, %%ruby, ... ) cell magics
    now raise by default if the return code of the given code is
    non-zero (thus halting execution of further cells in a
    notebook). The behavior can be disable by passing the 
    --no-raise-error flag.
- Add fix_test_history.patch
  Fixes failure in test_history.py for sqlite >= 3.25
  Should be fixed in next release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 12 20:43:21 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 6.3.1:
  * This is a bugfix release to switch the default completions back to
    IPython's own completion machinery. We discovered some problems
    with the completions from Jedi, including completing column names
    on pandas data frames.

- changes from version 6.3:
  * A new display class :class:`IPython.display.Code` can be used to
    display syntax highlighted code in a notebook (:ghpull:`10978`).
  * The :cellmagic:`html` magic now takes a "--isolated" option to put
    the content in an iframe (:ghpull:`10962`).
  * The code to find completions using the Jedi library has had
    various adjustments. This is still a work in progress, but we hope
    this version has fewer annoyances (:ghpull:`10956`,
    :ghpull:`10969`, :ghpull:`10999`, :ghpull:`11035`,
    :ghpull:`11063`, :ghpull:`11065`).
  * The *post* event callbacks are now always called, even when the
    execution failed (for example because of a "SyntaxError").
  * The execution info and result objects are now made available in
    the corresponding *pre* or *post* "*_run_cell" :doc:`event
    callbacks </config/callbacks>` in a backward compatible manner
    (:ghissue:`10774` and :ghpull:`10795`).
  * Performance with very long code cells (hundreds of lines) is
    greatly improved (:ghpull:`10898`). Further improvements are
    planned for IPython 7.

- Implement single-spec version
- Update to version 6.1.0
  * Quotes in a filename are always escaped during tab-completion on non-Windows.
    :ghpull:`10069`
  * Variables now shadow magics in autocompletion. See :ghissue:`4877` and :ghpull:`10542`.
  * Added the ability to add parameters to alias_magic.
  * To suppress log state messages, you can now either use ``%logstart -q``, pass
    ``--LoggingMagics.quiet=True`` on the command line, or set
    ``c.LoggingMagics.quiet=True`` in your configuration file.
  * An additional flag ``--TerminalInteractiveShell.term_title_format`` is
    introduced to allow the user to control the format of the terminal title.  It
    is specified as a python format string, and currently the only variable it
    will format is ``{cwd}``.
  * ``??``/``%pinfo2`` will now show object docstrings if the source can't be retrieved. :ghpull:`10532`

  * Completion on keyword arguments does not duplicate ``=`` sign if already present. :ghpull:`10547`
  * ``%run -m <module>`` now ``<module>`` passes extra arguments to ``<module>``. :ghpull:`10546`
  * completer now understand "snake case auto complete": if ``foo_bar_kittens`` is
    a valid completion, I can type ``f_b<tab>`` will complete to it. :ghpull:`10537`

  * Execution heuristics improve for single line statements
  * ``display()`` can now return a display id to update display areas.
- Update to version 6.0.0

    only 5.x branch. 
  * Configurable TerminalInteractiveShell, readline interface
  * The :cellmagic:`capture` magic can now capture the result of a cell (from
    an expression on the last line), as well as printed and displayed output.
  * Pressing Ctrl-Z in the terminal debugger now suspends IPython, as it
    already does in the main terminal prompt.
  * Autoreload can now reload ``Enum``.
  * IPython.display has gained a :any:`GeoJSON <IPython.display.GeoJSON>`
    object.

    :ghpull:`10313`
  * Add a config option ``TerminalInteractiveShell.extra_open_editor_shortcuts``
    to enable extra shortcuts to open the input in an editor. These are :kbd:`v`
    in vi mode, and :kbd:`C-X C-E` in emacs mode (:ghpull:`10330`).
    The :kbd:`F2` shortcut is always enabled.

- Update to IPython 5.0
  + IPython 5 features a major upgrade to the terminal interface, bringing live
    syntax highlighting as you type, proper multiline editing and multiline paste,
    and tab completions that don't clutter up your history.
  + Backwards incompatible changes
    * The ``%install_ext`` magic function, deprecated since 4.0, has now been deleted.
      You can distribute and install extensions as packages on PyPI.
    * Callbacks registered while an event is being handled will now only be called
      for subsequent events; previously they could be called for the current event.
      Similarly, callbacks removed while handling an event *will* always get that
      event. See :ghissue:`9447` and :ghpull:`9453`.
    * Integration with pydb has been removed since pydb development has been stopped
      since 2012, and pydb is not installable from PyPI.
    * The ``autoedit_syntax`` option has apparently been broken for many years.
      It has been removed.
    * The overhaul of the terminal interface will probably cause a range of minor
      issues for existing users.
    * IPython no longer uses readline configuration (``~/.inputrc``). We hope that
      the functionality you want (e.g. vi input mode) will be available by configuring
      IPython directly (see :doc:`/config/options/terminal`).
    * The ``PromptManager`` class has been removed, and the prompt machinery simplified.
    * There are new options to configure the colours used in syntax highlighting.
      We have tried to integrate them with our classic  ``--colors`` option and
     ``%colors`` magic, but there's a mismatch in possibilities, so some configurations
     may produce unexpected results. See :ref:`termcolour` for more information.
    * The new interface is not compatible with Emacs 'inferior-shell' feature. To
      continue using this, add the ``--simple-prompt`` flag to the command Emacs
      runs. This flag disables most IPython features, relying on Emacs to provide
      things like tab completion.
  + Provisional Changes
    * When running via the Jupyter notebook interfaces, or other compatible client,
      you can enable rich documentation experimental functionality:
      When the ``docrepr`` package is installed setting the boolean flag
      ``InteractiveShell.sphinxify_docstring`` to ``True``, will process the various
      object through sphinx before displaying them (see the ``docrepr`` package
      documentation for more information.
  + Deprecated Features
    * ``hooks.fix_error_editor`` seems unused and is pending deprecation.
    * `IPython/core/excolors.py:ExceptionColors` is  deprecated.
    * `IPython.core.InteractiveShell:write()` is deprecated; use `sys.stdout` instead.
    * `IPython.core.InteractiveShell:write_err()` is deprecated; use `sys.stderr` instead.
    * The `formatter` keyword argument to `Inspector.info` in `IPython.core.oinspec` has no effect.
    * The `global_ns` keyword argument of IPython Embed was deprecated, and has no effect. Use `module` keyword argument instead.
- Update to IPython 4.2
  * Fix ``ipython -i`` on errors, which was broken in 4.1.
  * The delay meant to highlight deprecated commands that have moved to jupyter has been removed.
  * Improve compatibility with future versions of traitlets and matplotlib.
  * Use stdlib :func:`python:shutil.get_terminal_size` to measure terminal width when displaying tracebacks
    (provided by ``backports.shutil_get_terminal_size`` on Python 2).
- Update to IPython 4.1.2
  * fixes installation issues with some versions of setuptools.
