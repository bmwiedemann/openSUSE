Sat Aug 29 16:14:09 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 7.18.0:
  * IPython 7.18 is a minor release that mostly contains bugfixes.
    + CRLF is now handled by magics my default; solving some issues
      due to copy pasting on windows. :ghpull:`12475`
    + Requiring pexpect >=4.3 as we are Python 3.7+ only and earlier
      version of pexpect will be incompatible. :ghpull:`12510`
    + Minimum jedi version is now 0.16. :ghpull:`12488`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  1 22:10:57 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 7.17.0:
  * IPython 7.17 brings a couple of new improvements to API and a
    couple of user facing changes to make the terminal experience more
    user friendly.
  * :ghpull:`12407` introduces the ability to pass extra argument to
    the IPython debugger class; this is to help a new project from
    kmaork (https://github.com/kmaork/madbg) to feature a fully remote
    debugger.
  * :ghpull:`12410` finally remove support for 3.6, while the codebase
    is still technically compatible; IPython will not install on
    Python 3.6.
  * lots of work on the debugger and hidden frames from @impact27 in
    :ghpull:`12437`, :ghpull:`12445`, :ghpull:`12460` and in
    particular :ghpull:`12453` which make the debug magic more robust
    at handling spaces.
  * Biggest API addition is code transformation which is done before
    code execution; IPython allows a number of hooks to catch
    non-valid Python syntax (magic, prompt
    stripping...etc). Transformers are usually called many time;
    typically:
    + When trying to figure out whether the code is complete and valid
      (should we insert a new line or execute ?)
    + During actual code execution pass before giving the code to
      Python's exec.
  * This lead to issues when transformer might have had side effects;
    or do external queries. Starting with IPython 7.17 you can expect
    your transformer to be called less time.
  * Input transformers are now called only once in the execution path
    of InteractiveShell, allowing to register transformer that
    potentially have side effects (note that this is not
    recommended). Internal methods should_run_async, and
    run_cell_async now take a recommended optional transformed_cell,
    and preprocessing_exc_tuple parameters that will become mandatory
    at some point in the future; that is to say cells need to be
    explicitly transformed to be valid Python syntax ahead of trying
    to run them. :ghpull:`12440`;
  * input_transformers can now also have an attribute has_side_effects
    set to True, when this attribute is present; this will prevent the
    transformers from being ran when IPython is trying to guess
    whether the user input is complete. Note that this may means you
    will need to explicitly execute in some case where your
    transformations are now not ran; but will not affect users with no
    custom extensions.

  subpackage.  This greatly simplifies the spec file and makes
  updating the package much easier.
- Drop doc subpackage due to rapid changes in readthedocs download
  urls.  This was only around to let the tests be run in a
  separate subpackage to avoid dependency loops.

Wed Jan 15 15:41:15 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 7.11.1
  * A couple of deprecated functions (no-op) have been reintroduces in py3compat as
   Cython was still relying on them, and will be removed in a couple of versions.
- Update to 7.11.0
  * A number of function in the ``py3compat`` have been removed; a number of types
    in the IPython code base are now non-ambiguous and now always ``unicode``
    instead of ``Union[Unicode,bytes]``; many of the relevant code path have thus
    been simplified/cleaned and types annotation added.
  * IPython support several verbosity level from exceptions. ``xmode plain`` now
    support chained exceptions.
  * We are starting to remove ``shell=True`` in some usages of subprocess. While not directly
    a security issue (as IPython is made to run arbitrary code anyway) it is not good
    practice and we'd like to show the example.
  * Work around some bugs in Python 3.9 tokenizer
  * IPython will now print its version after a crash.
- Update to 7.10.2
  * IPython 7.10.2 fix a couple of extra incompatibility between IPython, ipdb,
    asyncio and Prompt Toolkit 3.
- Update to IPython 7.10.1
  * IPython 7.10.1 fix a couple of incompatibilities with Prompt toolkit 3 (please
    update Prompt toolkit to 3.0.2 at least), and fixes some interaction with
    headless IPython.
- Update to IPython 7.10.0
  * Stop Support for Python 3.5 – Adopt NEP 29

- Update to 7.6.0
  IPython 7.6.0 contains a couple of bug fixes and number of small features
  additions as well as some compatibility with the current development version of
  Python 3.8.
  * Add a ``-l`` option to :magic:`psearch` to list the available search
    types.
  * Support ``PathLike`` for ``DisplayObject`` and ``Image``.
  * Configurability of timeout in the test suite for slow platforms.
  * Accept any casing for matplotlib backend.
  * Properly skip test that requires numpy to be installed
  * More support for Python 3.8 and positional only arguments (pep570)
  * Unicode names for the completion are loaded lazily on first use which
    should decrease startup time.
  * Autoreload now update the types of reloaded objects; this for example allow
    pickling of reloaded objects.
  * Fix a big where ``%%time`` magic would suppress cell output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 25 20:45:20 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 7.5.0
  * IPython 7.5.0 consist mostly of bug-fixes, and documentation updates,
    with one minor new feature. The Audio display element can now be
    assigned an element id when displayed in browser.
  * The major outstanding bug fix correct a change of behavior that was
    introduce in 7.4.0 where some cell magics would not be able to access
    or modify global scope when using the @needs_local_scope decorator.
    This was typically encountered with the %%time and %%timeit magics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 25 01:59:57 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Rename package to follow python package guidelines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 18:00:07 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 7.3.0:
  * The biggest change to this release is the implementation of the
    "%conda" and "%pip" magics, that will attempt to install packages
    in the **current environment**. You may still need to restart your
    interpreter or kernel for the change to be taken into account, but
    it should simplify installation of packages into remote
    environment. Installing using pip/conda from the command line is
    still the prefer method.
  * The "%pip" magic was already present, but was only printing a
    warning; now it will actually forward commands to pip.
  * Misc bug fixes and improvements:
    + Compatibility with Python 3.8.
    + Do not expand shell variable in execution magics, and added the
      "no_var_expand" decorator for magic requiring a similar
      functionality :ghpull:`11516`
    + Add "%pip" and "%conda" magic :ghpull:`11524`
    + Re-initialize posix aliases after a "%reset" :ghpull:`11528`
    + Allow the IPython command line to run "*.ipynb" files
      :ghpull:`11529`

- Update to version 7.1.0
  + Notable Changes
    * Major update of "latex to unicode" tab completion map (see below)
  + Notable New Features:
    * Restore functionality and documentation of the **sphinx directive**, which
      is now stricter (fail on error by daefault), has new configuration options,
      has a brand new documentation page :ref:`ipython_directive` (which needs
      some cleanup). It is also now *tested* so we hope to have less regressions.
     :ghpull:`11402`
    * ``IPython.display.Video`` now supports ``width`` and ``height`` arguments,
      allowing a custom width and height to be set instead of using the video's
      width and height. :ghpull:`11353`
    * Warn when using ``HTML('<iframe>')`` instead of ``IFrame`` :ghpull:`11350`
    * Allow Dynamic switching of editing mode between vi/emacs and show
      normal/input mode in prompt when using vi. :ghpull:`11390`. Use ``%config
      TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode = 'vi'`` or ``%config
      TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode = 'emacs'`` to dynamically switch
      between modes.
  + Notable Fixes:
    * Fix entering of **multi-line blocks in terminal** IPython, and various
      crashes in the new input transformation machinery :ghpull:`11354`,
      :ghpull:`11356`, :ghpull:`11358`. These also fix a **Compatibility bug
      with Python 3.7.1**.
    * Fix moving through generator stack in ipdb :ghpull:`11266`
    * %Magic command arguments now support quoting. :ghpull:`11330`
    * Re-add ``rprint`` and ``rprinte`` aliases. :ghpull:`11331`
    * Remove implicit dependency on ``ipython_genutils`` :ghpull:`11317`
    * Make ``nonlocal`` raise ``SyntaxError`` instead of silently failing in async
      mode. :ghpull:`11382`
    * Fix mishandling of magics and ``= !`` assignment just after a dedent in
      nested code blocks :ghpull:`11418`
    * Fix instructions for custom shortcuts :ghpull:`11426`
  + Notable Internals improvements:
    * Use of ``os.scandir`` (Python 3 only) to speed up some file system operations.
      :ghpull:`11365`
    * use ``perf_counter`` instead of ``clock`` for more precise
      timing results with ``%time`` :ghpull:`11376`
- Remove upstream-included fix_test_history.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 16 01:17:20 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 7.0.1
  Highlights
  * IPython 7.0+ now uses prompt_toolkit 2.0
  * IPython can automatically await code at top level, you should
    not need to access an event loop or runner yourself.
  * The magic %autoreload 2 now captures new methods added to
    classes. Earlier, only methods existing as of the initial
    import were being tracked and updated.
  * The autoindent feature that was deprecated in 5.x was
    re-enabled and un-deprecated.
  * Make %run -n -i ... work correctly. Earlier, if %run was
    passed both arguments, -n would be silently ignored.
  * The %%script (as well as %%bash, %%ruby, ... ) cell magics
    now raise by default if the return code of the given code is
    non-zero (thus halting execution of further cells in a
    notebook). The behavior can be disable by passing the 
    --no-raise-error flag.
- Add fix_test_history.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 12 20:43:21 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 6.3.1:
  * This is a bugfix release to switch the default completions back to
    IPython's own completion machinery. We discovered some problems
    with the completions from Jedi, including completing column names
    on pandas data frames.

- changes from version 6.3:
  * A new display class :class:`IPython.display.Code` can be used to
    display syntax highlighted code in a notebook (:ghpull:`10978`).
  * The :cellmagic:`html` magic now takes a "--isolated" option to put
    the content in an iframe (:ghpull:`10962`).
  * The code to find completions using the Jedi library has had
    various adjustments. This is still a work in progress, but we hope
    this version has fewer annoyances (:ghpull:`10956`,
    :ghpull:`10969`, :ghpull:`10999`, :ghpull:`11035`,
    :ghpull:`11063`, :ghpull:`11065`).
  * The *post* event callbacks are now always called, even when the
    execution failed (for example because of a "SyntaxError").
  * The execution info and result objects are now made available in
    the corresponding *pre* or *post* "*_run_cell" :doc:`event
    callbacks </config/callbacks>` in a backward compatible manner
    (:ghissue:`10774` and :ghpull:`10795`).
  * Performance with very long code cells (hundreds of lines) is
    greatly improved (:ghpull:`10898`). Further improvements are
    planned for IPython 7.

- Implement single-spec version
- Update to version 6.1.0
  * Quotes in a filename are always escaped during tab-completion on non-Windows.
    :ghpull:`10069`
  * Variables now shadow magics in autocompletion. See :ghissue:`4877` and :ghpull:`10542`.
  * Added the ability to add parameters to alias_magic.
  * To suppress log state messages, you can now either use ``%logstart -q``, pass
    ``--LoggingMagics.quiet=True`` on the command line, or set
    ``c.LoggingMagics.quiet=True`` in your configuration file.
  * An additional flag ``--TerminalInteractiveShell.term_title_format`` is
    introduced to allow the user to control the format of the terminal title.  It
    is specified as a python format string, and currently the only variable it
    will format is ``{cwd}``.
  * ``??``/``%pinfo2`` will now show object docstrings if the source can't be retrieved. :ghpull:`10532`
  * ``IPython.display`` has gained a ``%markdown`` cell magic. :ghpull:`10563`
  * ``%config`` options can now be tab completed. :ghpull:`10555`
  * ``%config`` with no arguments are now unique and sorted. :ghpull:`10548`
  * Completion on keyword arguments does not duplicate ``=`` sign if already present. :ghpull:`10547`
  * ``%run -m <module>`` now ``<module>`` passes extra arguments to ``<module>``. :ghpull:`10546`

- Update to IPython 5.0
  + IPython 5 features a major upgrade to the terminal interface, bringing live
    syntax highlighting as you type, proper multiline editing and multiline paste,
    and tab completions that don't clutter up your history.
  + Backwards incompatible changes
    * The ``%install_ext`` magic function, deprecated since 4.0, has now been deleted.
      You can distribute and install extensions as packages on PyPI.
    * Callbacks registered while an event is being handled will now only be called
      for subsequent events; previously they could be called for the current event.
      Similarly, callbacks removed while handling an event *will* always get that
      event. See :ghissue:`9447` and :ghpull:`9453`.
    * Integration with pydb has been removed since pydb development has been stopped
      since 2012, and pydb is not installable from PyPI.
    * The ``autoedit_syntax`` option has apparently been broken for many years.
      It has been removed.
    * The overhaul of the terminal interface will probably cause a range of minor
      issues for existing users.
    * IPython no longer uses readline configuration (``~/.inputrc``). We hope that
      the functionality you want (e.g. vi input mode) will be available by configuring
      IPython directly (see :doc:`/config/options/terminal`).
    * The ``PromptManager`` class has been removed, and the prompt machinery simplified.
    * There are new options to configure the colours used in syntax highlighting.
      We have tried to integrate them with our classic  ``--colors`` option and
     ``%colors`` magic, but there's a mismatch in possibilities, so some configurations
     may produce unexpected results. See :ref:`termcolour` for more information.
    * The new interface is not compatible with Emacs 'inferior-shell' feature. To
      continue using this, add the ``--simple-prompt`` flag to the command Emacs
      runs. This flag disables most IPython features, relying on Emacs to provide
      things like tab completion.
  + Provisional Changes
    * When running via the Jupyter notebook interfaces, or other compatible client,
      you can enable rich documentation experimental functionality:
      When the ``docrepr`` package is installed setting the boolean flag
      ``InteractiveShell.sphinxify_docstring`` to ``True``, will process the various
      object through sphinx before displaying them (see the ``docrepr`` package
      documentation for more information.
  + Deprecated Features
    * ``hooks.fix_error_editor`` seems unused and is pending deprecation.
    * `IPython/core/excolors.py:ExceptionColors` is  deprecated.
    * `IPython.core.InteractiveShell:write()` is deprecated; use `sys.stdout` instead.
    * `IPython.core.InteractiveShell:write_err()` is deprecated; use `sys.stderr` instead.
    * The `formatter` keyword argument to `Inspector.info` in `IPython.core.oinspec` has no effect.
    * The `global_ns` keyword argument of IPython Embed was deprecated, and has no effect. Use `module` keyword argument instead.
- Update to IPython 4.2
  * Fix ``ipython -i`` on errors, which was broken in 4.1.
  * The delay meant to highlight deprecated commands that have moved to jupyter has been removed.
  * Improve compatibility with future versions of traitlets and matplotlib.
  * Use stdlib :func:`python:shutil.get_terminal_size` to measure terminal width when displaying tracebacks
    (provided by ``backports.shutil_get_terminal_size`` on Python 2).
- Update to IPython 4.1.2
  * fixes installation issues with some versions of setuptools.
