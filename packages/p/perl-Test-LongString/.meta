  <title>Tests strings for equality, with more helpful failures</title>
  <description>
This module provides some drop-in replacements for the string comparison
functions of Test::More, but which are more suitable when you test against long
strings. If you've ever had to search for text in a multi-line string like an
HTML document, or find specific items in binary data, this is the module for
you.
