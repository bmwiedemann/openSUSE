  <description>Backport of Python 3 csv module.

The API of the csv module in Python 2 is drastically different from the csv module in Python 3.
This is due, for the most part, to the difference between str in Python 2 and Python 3.

The semantics of Python 3's version are more useful because they support unicode natively,
while Python 2's csv does not.</description>
