- Update to v1.19.2
  * Fixed #1388. Fixed intermittent memory corruption when insert or
    updating annotations.
  * Fixed #1375. Inconsistencies between line numbers as returned
    by the “words” and the “dict” options of `Page.get_text()` have
    been corrected.
  * Fixed #1364. The check for being a "rawdict" span in
    `recover_span_quad()` now works correctly.
  * Fixed #1342. Corrected the check for rectangle infiniteness in
    `Page.show_pdf_page()`.
  * Changed `Page.get_drawings()`, `Page.get_cdrawings()` to return
    an indicator on the area orientation covered by a rectangle. This
    implements #1355. Also, the recognition rate for rectangles and
    quads has been significantly improved.
  * Changed all text search and extraction methods to set the new
    flags option TEXT_MEDIABOX_CLIP to ON by default. That bit causes
    the automatic suppression of all characters that are completely
    outside a page’s mediabox (in as far as that notion is supported
    for a document type). This eliminates the need for using
    clip=page.rect or similar for omitting text outside the visible
    area.
  * Added parameter "dpi" to `Page.get_pixmap()` and
    `Annot.get_pixmap()`. When given, parameter "matrix" is ignored,
    and a Pixmap with the desired dots per inch is created.
  * Added attributes `Pixmap.is_monochrome` and `Pixmap.is_unicolor`
    allowing fast checks of pixmap properties. Addresses #1397.
  * Added method `Pixmap.color_count()` to determine the unique
    colors in the pixmap.
  * Added boolean parameter "compress" to PDF document method
    `Document.update_stream()`. Addresses / enables solution for
    #1408.
- from v1.19.1
  * Fixed #1328. “words” text extraction again returns correct (x0,
    y0) coordinates.
  * Changed `Page.get_textpage_ocr()`: it now supports parameter
    dpi to control OCR quality. It is also possible to choose whether
    the full page should be OCRed or only the images displayed by the
    page.
  * Changed `Page.get_drawings()` and `Page.get_cdrawings()` to
    automatically convert colors to RGB color tuples. Implements
    #1332. Similar change was applied to `Page.get_texttrace()`.
  * Changed `Page.get_text()` to support a parameter sort. If set
    to True the output is conveniently sorted.
- from v1.19.0
  * Supports MuPDF 1.19.*
  * Changed terminology and meaning of important geometry concepts:
    Rectangles are now characterized as finite, valid or empty, while
    the definitions of these terms have also changed. Rectangles
    specifically are now thought of being “open”: not all corners and sides are considered part of the retangle. Please do read the Rect section for details.
  * Added new parameter “no_new_id” to `Document.save()` /
    `Document.tobytes()` methods. Use it to suppress updating the
    second item of the document /ID which in PDF indicates that the
    original file has been updated. If the PDF has no /ID at all yet,
    then no new one will be created either.
  * Added a journalling facility for PDF updates. This allows logging
    changes, undoing or redoing them, or saving the journal for later
    use. Refer to `Document.journal_enable()` and friends.
  * Added new Pixmap methods `Pixmap.pdfocr_save()` and
    `Pixmap.pdfocr_tobytes()`, which generate a 1-page PDF containing
    the pixmap as PNG image with OCR text layer.
  * Added `Page.get_textpage_ocr()` which executes optical character
    recognition for the page, then extracts the results and stores
    them together with “normal” page content in a TextPage. Use or
    reuse this object in subsequent text extractions and text
    searches to avoid multiple efforts. The existing text search
    and text extraction methods have been extended to support a
    separately created textpage – see next item.
  * Added a new parameter textpage to text extraction and text search
    methods. This allows reuse of a previously created TextPage and
    thus achieves significant runtime benefits – which is especially
    important for the new OCR features. But “normal” text extractions
    can definitely also benefit.
  * Added `Page.get_texttrace()`, a technical method delivering
    low-level text character properties. It was present before as a
    private method, but the author felt it now is mature enough to be
    officially available. It specifically includes a “sequence
    number” which indicates the page appearance build operation that
    painted the text.
  * Added `Page.get_bboxlog()` which delivers the list of
    rectangles of page objects like text, images or drawings. Its
    significance lies in its sequence: rectangles intersecting areas
    with a lower index are covering or hiding them.
  * Changed methods `Page.get_drawings()` and
    `Page.get_cdrawings()` to include a “sequence number” indicating
    the page appearance build operation that created the drawing.
  * Fixed #1311. Field values in comboboxes should now be handled
    correctly.
  * Fixed #1290. Error was caused by incorrect rectangle emptiness
    check, which is fixed due to new geometry logic of this version.
  * Fixed #1286. Text alignment for redact annotations is working
    again.
  * Fixed #1287. Infinite loop issue for non-Windows systems when
    applying some redactions has been resolved.
  * Fixed #1284. Text layout destruction after applying redactions in
    some cases has been resolved.
- from v1.18.19
  * Fixed issue #1266. Failure to set `Pixmap.samples` in important
    cases, was hotfixed in a new version 1.18.19.
- from v1.18.18
  * Fixed issue #1257. Removing the read-only flag from PDF fields
    is now possible.
  * Fixed issue #1252. Now correctly specifying the zoom value for
    PDF link annotations.
  * Fixed issue #1244. Now correctly computing the transform matrix
    in `Page.get_image__bbox()`.
  * Fixed issue #1241. Prevent returning artifact characters in
    `Page.get_textbox()`, which happened in certain constellations.
  * Fixed issue #1234. Avoid creating infinite rectangles in corner
    cases – `Page.get_drawings()`, `Page.get_cdrawings()`.
  * Added test data and test scripts to the source PyPI source
    distribution.
- from v1.18.17
  * Fixed issue #1199. Using a non-existing page number in
    `Document.get_page_images()` and friends will no longer lead to
    segfaults.
  * Changed `Page.get_drawings()` to now differentiate between
    “stroke”, “fill” and combined paths. Paths containing more than
    one rectangle (i.e. “re” items) are now supported. Extracting
    “clipped” paths is now available as an option.
  * Added `Page.get_cdrawings()`, performance-optimized version of
    `Page.get_drawings()`.
  * Added `Pixmap.samples_mv`, memoryview of a pixmap’s pixel area.
    Does not copy and thus always accesses the current state of that
    area.
  * Added `Pixmap.samples_ptr`, Python “pointer” to a pixmap’s pixel
    area. Allows much faster creation (factor 800+) of Qt images.
- from v1.18.16
  * Fixed issue #1184. Existing PDF widget fonts in a PDF are now
    accepted (i.e. not forcedly changed to a Base-14 font).
  * Fixed issue #1154. Text search hits should now be correct when
    clip is specified.
  * Fixed issue #1152.
  * Fixed issue #1146.
  * Added `Link.flags` and `Link.set_flags()` to the Link class.
    Implements enhancement requests #1187.
  * Added option to simulate `TextWriter.fill_textbox() output for
    predicting the number of lines, that a given text would occupy in
    the textbox.
  * Added text output support as subcommand gettext to the fitz CLI
    module. Most importantly, original physical text layout
    reproduction is now supported.
- from v1.18.15
  * Fixed issue #1088. Removing an annotation’s fill color should now
    work again both ways, using the fill_color=[] argument in
    `Annot.update()` as well as fill=[] in `Annot.set_colors()`.
  * Fixed issue #1081. `Document.subset_fonts()`: fixed an error
    which created wrong character widths for some fonts.
  * Fixed issue #1078. `Page.get_text()` and other methods related to
    text extraction: changed the default value of the TextPage flags
    parameter. All whitespace and ligatures are now preserved.
  * Fixed issue #1085. The old snake_cased alias of
    `fitz.detTextlength` is now defined correctly.
  * Changed `Document.subset_fonts()` will now correctly prefix font
    subsets with an appropriate six letter uppercase tag, complying
    with the PDF specification.
  * Added new method `Widget.button_states()` which returns the
    possible values that a button-type field can have when being set
    to “on” or “off”.
  * Added support of text with Small Capital letters to the Font and
    TextWriter classes. This is reflected by an additional bool
    parameter small_caps in various of their methods.
- from v1.18.14
  * Finished implementing new, “snake_cased” names for methods and
    properties, that were “camelCased” and awkward in many aspects.
    At the end of this documentation, there is section Deprecated
    Names with more background and a mapping of old to new names.
  * Fixed issue #1053. `Page.insert_image()`: when given, include
    image mask in the hash computation.
  * Fixed issue #1043. Added `Pixmap.getPNGdata` to the aliases of
    `Pixmap.tobytes()`.
  * Fixed an internal error when computing the envelopping
    rectangle of drawn paths as returned by `Page.get_drawings()`.
  * Fixed an internal error occasionally causing loops when
    outputting text via `TextWriter.fill_textbox()`.
  * Added `Font.char_lengths()`, which returns a tuple of character
    widths of a string.
  * Added more ways to specify pages in `Document.delete_pages()`.
    Now a sequence (list, tuple or range) can be specified, and the
    Python del statement can be used. In the latter case, Python
    slices are also accepted.
  * Changed `Document.del_toc_item()`, which disables a single item
    of the TOC: previously, the title text was removed. Instead, now
    the complete item will be shown grayed-out by supporting viewers.
- from v1.18.13
  * Fixed issue #1014
  * Fixed an internal memory leak when computing image bboxes –
    `Page.get_image_bbox()`.
  * Added support for low-level access and modification of the PDF
    trailer. Applies to `Document.xref_get_keys()`,
    `Document.xref_get_key(), and Document.xref_set_key()`.
  * Added documentation for maintaining private entries in PDF
    metadata.
  * Added documentation for handling transparent image insertions,
    `Page.insert_image()`.
  * Added `Page.get_image_rects()`, an improved version of
    `Page.get_image_bbox()`.
  * Changed `Document.delete_pages()` to support various ways of
    specifying pages to delete.
  * Changed `Page.insert_image()` to also accept the xref of an
    existing image in the file. This allows “copying” images between
    pages, and extremely fast mutiple insertions.
  * Changed `Page.insert_image()` to also accept the integer
    parameter alpha. To be used for performance improvements.
  * Changed `Pixmap.set_alpha()` to support new parameters for
    pre-multiplying colors with their alpha values and setting a
    specific color to fully transparent (e.g. white).
  * Changed `Document.embfile_add()` to automatically set creation
    and modification date-time. Correspondingly,
    `Document.embfile_upd()` automatically maintains modification
    date-time (/ModDate PDF key), and `Document.embfile_info()`
    correspondingly reports these data. In addition, the embedded
    file’s associated “collection item” is included via its xref.
    This supports the development of PDF portfolio applications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 10 12:56:40 UTC 2021 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Update to v1.18.11
  * Improved layout of source distribution material.
  * Stabilized Linux distribution detection for generating PyMuPDF
    from sources.
  * Page.get_xobjects delivers the result of Document.get_page_xobjects.
  * Page.get_image_info delivers meta information for all images shown
    on the page.
  * Tools.mupdf_display_warnings allows setting on / off the display
    of MuPDF-generated warnings. The default is off.
  * Document.ez_save convenience alias of :meth:`Document.save`
    with some different defaults.
  * Image extractions of document pages now also contain the image's
    **transformation matrix**. This concerns `Page.get_image_bbox`
    and the DICT, JSON, RAWDICT, and RAWJSON variants of `Page.get_text`.
- from v1.18.10
  * Added old aliases for `DisplayList.get_pixmap` and
    `DisplayList.get_textpage`.
  * Stabilized removal of JavaScript objects with `Document.scrub`.
  * Removed a loop in the reworked `TextWriter.fill_textbox`.
  * `Document.xref_get_keys` and `Document.xref_get_key` to also allow
    accessing the PDF trailer dictionary. This can be done by using
    `-1` as the xref number argument.
  * Added a number of functions for reconstructing the quads for text
    lines, spans and characters extracted by `Page.get_text` options
    "dict" and "rawdict".
  * Added `Tools.unset_quad_corrections` to suppress character quad
    corrections (occasionally required for erroneous fonts).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 27 00:04:25 UTC 2021 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Revised License to be AGPL-3.0-only
- Add %doc
- Remove COPYING now provided in tarball
- Update to v1.18.9
  * Removed ambiguous statements concerning PyMuPDF's license,
    which is now clearly stated to be GNU AGPL V3
  * Fixed issue 895
  * Since v1.17.6 PyMuPDF suppresses the font subset tags and only
    reports the base fontname in text extraction outputs
    "dict" / "json" / "rawdict" / "rawjson".
    Now a new global parameter can request the old behaviour,
    `Tools.set_subset_fontnames`.
  * Pixmap creation now also works with filenames given as pathlib.
  * Changed `Document.subset_fonts`: Text is not rewritten any more
    and should therefore retain all its origial properties -- like
    being hidden or being controlled by Optional Content mechanisms.
  * `TextWriter.fill_textbox`, `TextWriter.append` now accept a new
    boolean parameter `right_to_left`, which is *False* by default.
  * Changed `TextWriter.fill_textbox` to return all lines of text,
    that did not fit in the given rectangle. Also changed the default
    of the `warn` parameter to no longer print a warning message
    in overflow situations.
  * Added a utility function `recover_quad`, which computes the
    quadrilateral of a span. This function can be used for correctly
    marking text extracted with the "dict" or "rawdict"
    options of `Page.get_text`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 06:24:36 UTC 2021 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Remove doc sub-package, fixing builds
- Switch to using PyPI, adding COPYING from upstream
- Update URL
- Add build dependency openSUSE-release, needed by setup.py
- Remove fix-library-linking.patch no longer needed
- Fix %check for single-spec
- Update to v1.18.8
  * Fixed a memory leak in Page.insert_image when inserting
    images from files or memory
  * pathlib.Path objects should now correctly handle file path
    hierarchies
- from v1.18.7
  * Added an experimental Document.subset_fonts which reduces
    the size of eligible fonts based on their use by text in the PDF
  * Document.convert_to_pdf now also supports PDF documents
  * Renamed Document.write to Document.tobytes for greater clarity.
    But the deprecated name remains available for some time.
  * Document.tobytes` now supports linearized PDF output
  * Document.save` now also supports writing to Python file objects.
    In addition, the open function now supports Python file objects.
  * Fixed issue #844.
  * Fixed issue #838.
  * More logic for better support of OCR-ed text output
    (Tesseract, ABBYY).
  * Fixed issue #818.
  * Fixed issue #814.
  * Added Document.get_page_labels which returns a list of page
    label definitions of a PDF.
  * Added :meth:`Document.has_annots and Document.has_links to check
    whether these object types are present anywhere in a PDF.
  * Added expert low-level functions to simplify inquiry and
    modification of PDF object sources:
    + Document.xref_get_keys lists the keys of object `xref`
    + Document.xref_get_key returns type and content of a key
    + Document.xref_set_key modifies the key's value
  * Added parameter thumbnails to Document.scrub to also allow
    removing page thumbnail images
  * Improved documentation for how to add valid text marker
    annotations for non-horizontal text
- from v1.18.6
  * Introduced Python type hinting
  * Fixed issue #812.
  * Invalid document metadata previously prevented opening some
    documents at all. This error has been removed.
  * Text search and text extraction will make no rectangle
    containment checks at all if the default clip=None is used.
  * Fixed issue #785.
  * Corrected a parameter check error.
  * Added an option to set the desired line height for text boxes
  * Changed text position retrieval to better cope with Tesseract's
    glyphless font.
  * Added an option to choose the prefix of new annotations,
    fields and links for providing unique annotation ids
  * Added getting and setting color and text properties for
    Table of Contents items for PDFs
  * Added PDF page label handling: Page.get_label() returns the
    page label, Document.get_page_numbers return all page numbers
    having a specified label, and Document.set_page_labels adds
    or updates a PDF's page label definition.
- from v1.18.5
  * Apart from several fixes, this version also focusses on several
    minor, but important feature improvements.
    Among the latter is a more precise computation of proper line
    heights and insertion points for writing / inserting text.
    As opposed to using font-agnostic constants, these values are
    now taken from the font's properties.
  * By using "small glyph heights" option, the full page text can
    be extracted.
  * Fixed issue #768.
  * Fixed issue #750.
  * The "dict", "rawdict" and corresponding JSON output variants
    now have two new span keys: "ascender" and "descender".
    These floats represent special font properties which can be
    used to compute bboxes of spans or characters of exactly
    fontsize height (as opposed to the default line height).
    An example algorithm is shown in section "Span Dictionary"
    here. Also improved the detection and correction of
    ill-specified ascender / descender values encountered
    in some fonts.
  * Added a new, experimental Tools.set_small_glyph_heights. This
    method sets or unsets a global parameter to always compute
    bboxes with fontsize height. If "on", text searching and all
    text extractions will returned rectangles, bboxes and quads
    with a smaller height.
  * Fixed issue #728.
  * Changed fill color logic of 'Polyline' annotations: this
    parameter now only pertains to line end symbols --
    the annotation itself can no longer have a fill color
  * Changed Page.getImageBbox to also compute the bbox if the image
    is contained in an XObject.
  * Changed Shape.insertTextbox, resp. Page.insertTextbox, resp.
    TextWriter.fillTextbox to respect font's properties "ascender" /
    "descender" when computing line height and insertion point.
    This should no longer lead to line overlaps for multi-line output.
    These methods used to ignore font specifics and used constant
    values instead.
- from v1.18.4
  * Adds several features to support PDF Optional Content, including
    OCMDs (Optional Content Membership Dictionaries) with the full
    scope of "visibility expressions" (PDF key /VE), text insertions
    (including the TextWriter class) and drawings.
  * Freetext annotations now support an uncolored rectangle when
    fill_color=None.
  * UTF-8 encoding errors are now handled for HTML / XML Page.getText.
  * Empty values are no longer stored in the PDF /Info metadata
    dictionary.
  * Added new methods Document.set_oc and Document.get_oc to set or
    get optional content references for existing image and form
    XObjects. These methods are similar to the same-named methods
    of Annot.
  * Added Document.set_ocmd, Document.get_ocmd for handling OCMDs.
  * Added Optional Content support for text insertion and drawing.
  * Added new method Page.deleteWidget, which deletes a form field
    from a page. This is analogous to deleting annotations.
  * Added support for Popup annotations. This includes defining
    the Popup rectangle and setting the Popup to open or closed.
    Methods / attributes Annot.set_popup, Annot.set_open,
    Annot.has_popup, Annot.is_open, Annot.popup_rect, Annot.popup_xref
  * Annot methods and attributes converted to lower case with
    underscores, while keeping UPPERCASE for the constants.
    Old names will remain available to prevent code breaks, but they
    will no longer be mentioned in the documentation.
- from v1.18.3
  * Introduces support for PDF's Optional Content concept.
    This includes several new Document methods for inquiring and setting
    optional content status and adding optional content
    configurations and groups. In addition, images, form XObjects
    and annotations now can be bound to optional content specifications.
  * Fixed issue #714.
  * Fixed issue #711.
  * If a PDF user password, but no owner password is supplied nor
    present, then the user password is also used as the owner password.
  * Fixed expand and deflate parameters of methodsDocument.save
    and Document.write. Individual image and font compression should
    now finally work.
- from v1.18.2
  * Contains some interesting improvements for text searching: any
    number of search hits is now returned and the hit_max parameter
    was removed. The new clip parameter in addition allows to restrict
    the search area. Searching now detects hyphenations at line breaks
    and accordingly finds hyphenated words.
  * If using quads=False in text searching, then overlapping rectangles
    on the same line are joined. Previously, parts of the search string,
    which belonged to different "marked content" items, each generated
    their own rectangle -- just as if occurring on separate lines.
  * Added Document.isRepaired, which is true if the PDF was
    repaired on open.
  * Added Document.setXmlMetadata which either updates or creates
    PDF XML metadata
  * Added Document.getXmlMetadata returns PDF XML metadata.
  * Changed creation of PDF documents: they will now always carry a
    PDF identification (/ID field) in the document trailer
  * Changed Page.searchFor: a new parameter clip is accepted to
    restrict the search to this rectangle. Correspondingly, the
    attribute TextPage.rect is now respected by TextPage.search.
  * Changed parameter hit_max in Page.searchFor and TextPage.search
    is now obsolete: methods will return all hits.
  * Changed character selection criteria in Page.getText: a character
    is now considered to be part of a clip if its bbox is fully
    contained. Before this, a non-empty intersection was sufficient.
  * Changed Document.scrub to support a new option redact_images.
- from v1.18.1
  * Detects and recovers from more cyclic resource dependencies
    in PDF pages and for the first time reports them in the
    MuPDF warnings store.
  * Fixed issue #686.
  * Added opacity options for the Shape class: Stroke and fill
    colors can now be set to some transparency value.
    This means that all Page draw methods, methods
    Page.insertText, Page.insertTextbox, Shape.finish,
    Shape.insertText, and Shape.insertTextbox support two
    new parameters: stroke_opacity and fill_opacity.
  * Added new parameter mask to Page.insertImage for
    optionally providing an external image mask
  * Added Annot.soundGet for extracting the sound of an audio
    annotation.
- from v1.18.0
  * Supports MuPDF v1.18
  * An upstream bug occurred occasionally for some pages only
    and seems to be fixed now: page layout should no longer
    be ruined in these cases.
  * Unsuccessful storage allocations should now always lead to
    exceptions (circumvention of an upstream bug intermittently
    crashing the interpreter).
  * Pixmap size is now based on size_t instead of int in C and
    should be correct even for extremely large pixmaps
  * Specification of dashes for PDF drawing insertion should now
    correctly reflect the PDF spec
  * A memory leakage in Page.insert_pdf has been removed
  * Added keyword "images" to Page.apply_redactions for
    fine-controlling the handling of images
  * Added Annot.getText and Annot.getTextbox, which offer
    the same functionality as the Page versions
  * Added key "number" to the block dictionaries of Page.getText /
    Annot.getText for options "dict" and "rawdict"
  * Added glyph_name_to_unicode and unicode_to_glyph_name.
    Both functions do not really connect to a specific font and
    are now independently available, too.
    The data are now based on the Adobe Glyph List.
  * Added convenience functions adobe_glyph_names and
    adobe_glyph_unicodes which return the respective available data
  * Added Page.getDrawings which returns details of drawing
    operations on a document page. Works for all document types
  * Improved performance of Document.insert_pdf.
    Multiple object copies are now also suppressed across multiple
    separate insertions from the same source. This saves time,
    memory and target file size. Previously this mechanism was only
    active within each single method execution. The feature can also
    be suppressed with the new method bool parameter final=1,
    which is the default.
  * For PNG images created from pixmaps, the resolution (dpi) is
    now automatically set from the respective Pixmap.xres and
    Pixmap.yres values

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 12:34:51 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.17.4:
  * 4th bugfix release over 1.17, which provided these highlights:
  **Added** extended language support for annotations and widgets: a mixture of
  Latin, Greece, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters can now be
  used in 'FreeText' annotations and text widgets. No special arrangement is
  required to use it.
  * Faster page access is implemented for documents supporting a "chapter"
  structure. This applies to EPUB documents currently. This comes with several
  new :ref:`Document` methods and changes for :meth:`Document.loadPage` and the
  "indexed" page access *doc[n]*: In addition to specifying a page number as
  before, a tuple *(chaper, pno)* can be specified to identify the desired
  page.

  * **Changed:** Improved support of redaction annotations: images overlapped by
  redactions are **permanantly modified** by erasing the overlap areas. Also
  links are removed if overlapped by redactions. This is now fully in sync with
  PDF specifications.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 27 09:27:34 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.16.14
  * Added JavaScript support to PDF form fields
  * Added a new form field method, which resets the field value to its default.
  * Added :meth:`Page.setMediaBox` for changing the physical PDF page size.
  * Added method which returns a list of Form XObjects of the page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  6 07:58:25 UTC 2019 - Yunhe Guo <i@guoyunhe.me>

- Version 1.14.17
  * Added method Document.fullcopyPage to make full page copies within
    a PDF (not just copied references as Document.copyPage does).
  * Changed methods Page.getPixmap, Document.getPagePixmap to now use
    alpha=False as default.
  * Changed text extraction: the span dictionary now (again) contains
    its rectangle under the bbox key.
  * Changed methods Document.movePage and Document.copyPage to use
    direct functions instead of wrapping Document.select - similar to
    Document.deletePage in v1.14.16.
  * The GitHub repo no longer contains interface files generated by SWIG
    (fitz.py, fitz_wrap.c). This allows easier tracking of inter-version
    source differences which is needed by providers of various Linux
    platforms. The PyPI source distribution still has the previous
    structure which includes those generated files.
- Add swig and libpng16 build requires
- Removed Python2 package since upstream doesn't support it anymore.
