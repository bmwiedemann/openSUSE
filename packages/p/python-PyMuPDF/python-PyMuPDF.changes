- update to 1.17.4:
  * 4th bugfix release over 1.17, which provided these highlights:
  **Added** extended language support for annotations and widgets: a mixture of
  Latin, Greece, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters can now be
  used in 'FreeText' annotations and text widgets. No special arrangement is
  required to use it.
  * Faster page access is implemented for documents supporting a "chapter"
  structure. This applies to EPUB documents currently. This comes with several
  new :ref:`Document` methods and changes for :meth:`Document.loadPage` and the
  "indexed" page access *doc[n]*: In addition to specifying a page number as
  before, a tuple *(chaper, pno)* can be specified to identify the desired
  page.

  * **Changed:** Improved support of redaction annotations: images overlapped by
  redactions are **permanantly modified** by erasing the overlap areas. Also
  links are removed if overlapped by redactions. This is now fully in sync with
  PDF specifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  6 07:58:25 UTC 2019 - Yunhe Guo <i@guoyunhe.me>

- Version 1.14.17
  * Added method Document.fullcopyPage to make full page copies within
    a PDF (not just copied references as Document.copyPage does).
  * Changed methods Page.getPixmap, Document.getPagePixmap to now use
    alpha=False as default.
  * Changed text extraction: the span dictionary now (again) contains
    its rectangle under the bbox key.
  * Changed methods Document.movePage and Document.copyPage to use
    direct functions instead of wrapping Document.select - similar to
    Document.deletePage in v1.14.16.
  * The GitHub repo no longer contains interface files generated by SWIG
    (fitz.py, fitz_wrap.c). This allows easier tracking of inter-version
    source differences which is needed by providers of various Linux
    platforms. The PyPI source distribution still has the previous
    structure which includes those generated files.
- Add swig and libpng16 build requires
- Removed Python2 package since upstream doesn't support it anymore.
