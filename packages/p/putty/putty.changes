-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 15 20:04:57 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.81

    signatures are no longer generated with biased values of k.
    The previous bias compromises private keys.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 18 21:52:22 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.80
  * Fix CVE-2023-48795 [boo#1218128]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 27 10:27:17 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.79
  * Terminal mouse tracking: support for mouse movements which are
    not drags, and support for horizontal scroll events (e.g.
    generated by trackpads).
  * Fixed: PuTTY could fail an assertion if a resize control
    sequence was sent by the server while the window was docked to
    one half of the screen in KDE.
  * Fixed: PuTTY could fail an assertion if you tried to change the
    font size while the window was maximised.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 30 19:54:34 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.78
  * Support for OpenSSH certificates, for both user
    authentication keys and host keys.
  * New SSH proxy modes, for running a custom shell command or
    subsystem on the proxy server instead of forwarding a port
    through it.
  * New plugin system to allow a helper program to provide
    responses in keyboard-interactive authentication, intended to
    automate one-time password systems.
  * Support for NTRU Prime post-quantum key exchange,
  * Support for AES-GCM (in the OpenSSH style rather than
    RFC 5647).
  * Support for more forms of Diffie-Hellman key exchange: new
    larger integer groups (such as group16 and group18), and
    support for using those and ECDH with GSSAPI.
  * Bug fix: server-controlled window title setting now works
    again even if the character set is ISO 8859 (or a few other
    affected single-byte character sets).
  * Bug fix: certain forms of OSC escape sequences (sent by some
    real servers) could cause PuTTY to crash.
  * Bug fix: the -pwfile/-pw options no longer affect local key
    passphrase prompts, and no longer suppress Plink's
    anti-spoofing measures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 28 19:42:12 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.77
  * Major improvements to network proxy support:
  * Support for interactively prompting the user if the proxy
    server requires authentication.
  * Built-in support for proxying via another SSH server, so that
    PuTTY will SSH to the proxy and then automatically forward a
    port through it to the destination host. (Similar to running
    plink -nc as a subprocess, but more convenient to set up, and
    allows you to answer interactive prompts presented by the
    proxy.)
  * Support for HTTP Digest authentication, when talking to HTTP
    proxies.
  * New configuration options for keyboard handling:
  * Option to control handling of Shift + arrow keys
  * Extra mode in the function-keys option, for modern xterm
    (v216 and above).
  * Crypto update: added side-channel resistance in probabilistic
    RSA key generation.
  * Crypto update: retired the use of short Diffie-Hellman
    exponents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 18 22:20:49 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.76
  * New option to abandon an SSH connection if the server allows
    you to authenticate in a trivial manner.
  * Bug fix: server colour-palette reconfigurations were
    sometimes lost.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 10 12:02:38 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.75
  * Upgraded default SSH key fingerprint format to OpenSSH-style
    SHA-256.
  * Upgraded private key file format to PPK3, with improved
    passphrase hashing and no use of SHA-1.
  * Terminal now supports ESC [ 9 m for strikethrough text.
  * New protocols: bare ssh-connection layer for use over
    already-secure IPC channels, and SUPDUP for talking to very
    old systems such as PDP-10s.
  * PuTTYgen now supports alternative provable-prime generation
    algorithm for RSA and DSA.
  * The Unix tools can now connect directly to a Unix-domain
    socket.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 28 11:02:18 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.74
  * Fixed a possible vulnerability [boo#1173442]
  * Added a new configuration option to mitigate a minor
    information leak in SSH host key policy.
- Remove empty %post/%postun (says rpmlint)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  1 07:43:23 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.73
  * In bracketed paste mode, the terminal escape sequences that
    should delimit the pasted data were appearing together on one
    side of it, making it possible to misidentify pasted data as
    manual keyboard input. [CVE-2019-17068, boo#1152753]
  * An SSH-1 server sending a disconnection message could cause
    an access to freed memory. [CVE-2019-17069]
  * Tweaked terminal handling to prevent lost characters at the
    ends of lines in gcc's colored error messages.
  * Removed a bad interaction between the "clear scrollback"
    operation and mouse selection that could give rise to the
    dreaded "line==NULL" assertion box.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 12 15:24:18 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 0.72 [boo#1144547, boo#1144548]
  * Fixed two separate vulnerabilities affecting the obsolete
    SSH-1 protocol, both available before host key checking.
  * Fixed a vulnerability in all the SSH client tools (PuTTY,
    Plink, PSFTP and PSCP) if a malicious program can impersonate
    Pageant.
  * Fixed a crash in GSSAPI / Kerberos key exchange triggered if
    the server provided an ordinary SSH host key as part of the
    exchange.

  * Fixed a remotely triggerable memory overwrite in RSA key
    exchange, which can occur before host key verification
    potential recycling of random numbers used in cryptography.
  * Fixed a remotely triggerable buffer overflow in any kind of
    server-to-client forwarding.

Tue Aug  6 19:09:06 UTC 2013 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- update to 0.63
  * Security fix: prevent a nefarious SSH server or network attacker
    from crashing PuTTY at startup in three different ways by 
    presenting a maliciously constructed public key and signature.
    [bnc#833567] CVE-2013-4852
  * Security fix: PuTTY no longer retains the private half of users' 
    keys in memory by mistake after authenticating with them.
  * Revamped the internal configuration storage system to remove all 
    fixed arbitrary limits on string lengths. In particular, there 
    should now no longer be an unreasonably small limit on the number 
    of port forwardings PuTTY can store.
  * Forwarded TCP connections which close one direction before the
    other should now be reliably supported, with EOF propagated 
    independently in the two directions. This also fixes some instances 
    of forwarding data corruption (if the corruption consisted of
    losing data from the very end of the connection) and some instances
    of PuTTY failing to close when the session is over (because it 
    wrongly thought a forwarding channel was still active when it was 
    not).
  * The terminal emulation now supports xterm's bracketed paste mode 
    (allowing aware applications to tell the difference between typed
    and pasted text, so that e.g. editors need not apply inappropriate
    auto-indent).
  * You can now choose to display bold text by both brightening the 
    foreground colour and changing the font, not just one or the other.
  * PuTTYgen will now never generate a 2047-bit key when asked for 2048 
    (or more generally n−1 bits when asked for n).
  * Some updates to default settings: PuTTYgen now generates 2048-bit 
    keys by default (rather than 1024), and PuTTY defaults to UTF-8 
    encoding and 2000 lines of scrollback (rather than ISO 8859-1 and
    200).
  * Unix: PSCP and PSFTP now preserve the Unix file permissions, on 
    copies in both directions.
  * Unix: dead keys and compose-character sequences are now supported.
  * Unix: PuTTY and pterm now permit font fallback (where glyphs not 
    present in your selected font are automatically filled in from other 
    fonts on the system) even if you are using a server-side X11 font 
    rather than a Pango client-side one.
  * Bug fixes too numerous to list, mostly resulting from running the 
    code through Coverity Scan which spotted an assortment of memory
    and resource leaks, logic errors, and crashes in various circumstances. 
- packaging changes:
  * run make from base directory
  * run tests
  * remove putty-01-werror.diff (currently not needed)
  * remove putty-02-remove-gtk1.diff, putty-05-glib-deprecated.diff,
    putty-06-gtk2-indivhdr.diff (no longer needed)
  * refresh putty-03-config.diff
  * remove autoconf calls and requirements
  * package HTML documentation
  * package LICENCE file

* Bug fix: PuTTY no longer prints a spurious "Access denied"
  message when GSSAPI authentication fails.
* Bug fix: PSCP and PSFTP now honour nonstandard port numbers in
  SSH saved sessions.
* Bug fix: Pageant no longer leaks a file handle when an
  authentication fails.
* Bug fix: PuTTYtel no longer crashes when saving a session.
* Bug fix: PuTTY now draws underlines under the underlined text
  instead of sometimes putting them somewhere off to the right.
* Bug fix: PuTTY now should not draw VT100 line drawing characters
  at the wrong vertical offset.
