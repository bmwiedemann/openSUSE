Tue Oct  1 07:43:23 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.73
  * In bracketed paste mode, the terminal escape sequences that
    should delimit the pasted data were appearing together on one
    side of it, making it possible to misidentify pasted data as
    manual keyboard input. [CVE-2019-17068, boo#1152753]
  * An SSH-1 server sending a disconnection message could cause
    an access to freed memory. [CVE-2019-17069]
  * Tweaked terminal handling to prevent lost characters at the
    ends of lines in gcc's colored error messages.
  * Removed a bad interaction between the "clear scrollback"
    operation and mouse selection that could give rise to the
    dreaded "line==NULL" assertion box.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixed a vulnerability in all the SSH client tools (PuTTY,
    Plink, PSFTP and PSCP) if a malicious program can impersonate
    Pageant.
  * Fixed a crash in GSSAPI / Kerberos key exchange triggered if
    the server provided an ordinary SSH host key as part of the
    exchange.

    exchange, which can occur before host key verification
    potential recycling of random numbers used in cryptography.
  * Fixed a remotely triggerable buffer overflow in any kind of
    server-to-client forwarding.
  * Fixed multiple denial-of-service attacks that can be triggered

  PuTTY to the same host can share a single SSH connection instead
  of all having to log in independently.
* Bug fix: IPv6 literals are handled sensibly throughout the suite,
  if you enclose them in square brackets to prevent the colons
  being mistaken for a :port suffix.

Tue Aug  6 19:09:06 UTC 2013 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- update to 0.63
  * Security fix: prevent a nefarious SSH server or network attacker
    from crashing PuTTY at startup in three different ways by 
    presenting a maliciously constructed public key and signature.
    [bnc#833567] CVE-2013-4852
  * Security fix: PuTTY no longer retains the private half of users' 
    keys in memory by mistake after authenticating with them.
  * Revamped the internal configuration storage system to remove all 
    fixed arbitrary limits on string lengths. In particular, there 
    should now no longer be an unreasonably small limit on the number 
    of port forwardings PuTTY can store.
  * Forwarded TCP connections which close one direction before the
    other should now be reliably supported, with EOF propagated 
    independently in the two directions. This also fixes some instances 
    of forwarding data corruption (if the corruption consisted of
    losing data from the very end of the connection) and some instances
    of PuTTY failing to close when the session is over (because it 
    wrongly thought a forwarding channel was still active when it was 
    not).
  * The terminal emulation now supports xterm's bracketed paste mode 
    (allowing aware applications to tell the difference between typed
    and pasted text, so that e.g. editors need not apply inappropriate
    auto-indent).
  * You can now choose to display bold text by both brightening the 
    foreground colour and changing the font, not just one or the other.
  * PuTTYgen will now never generate a 2047-bit key when asked for 2048 
    (or more generally nâˆ’1 bits when asked for n).
  * Some updates to default settings: PuTTYgen now generates 2048-bit 
    keys by default (rather than 1024), and PuTTY defaults to UTF-8 
    encoding and 2000 lines of scrollback (rather than ISO 8859-1 and
    200).
  * Unix: PSCP and PSFTP now preserve the Unix file permissions, on 
    copies in both directions.
  * Unix: dead keys and compose-character sequences are now supported.
  * Unix: PuTTY and pterm now permit font fallback (where glyphs not 
    present in your selected font are automatically filled in from other 
    fonts on the system) even if you are using a server-side X11 font 
    rather than a Pango client-side one.
  * Bug fixes too numerous to list, mostly resulting from running the 
    code through Coverity Scan which spotted an assortment of memory
    and resource leaks, logic errors, and crashes in various circumstances. 
- packaging changes:
  * run make from base directory
  * run tests
  * remove putty-01-werror.diff (currently not needed)
  * remove putty-02-remove-gtk1.diff, putty-05-glib-deprecated.diff,
    putty-06-gtk2-indivhdr.diff (no longer needed)
  * refresh putty-03-config.diff
  * remove autoconf calls and requirements
  * package HTML documentation
  * package LICENCE file

Sun Dec 11 14:04:30 UTC 2011 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- update to upstream 0.62:
* Security fix: PuTTY no longer retains passwords in memory by
  mistake.
* Bug fix: Pageant now talks to both new-style clients (0.61 and
  above) and old-style (0.60 and below).
* Bug fix: PuTTY no longer prints a spurious "Access denied"
  message when GSSAPI authentication fails.
* Bug fix: PSCP and PSFTP now honour nonstandard port numbers in
  SSH saved sessions.
* Bug fix: Pageant no longer leaks a file handle when an
  authentication fails.
* Bug fix: PuTTYtel no longer crashes when saving a session.
* Bug fix: PuTTY now draws underlines under the underlined text
  instead of sometimes putting them somewhere off to the right.
* Bug fix: PuTTY now should not draw VT100 line drawing characters
  at the wrong vertical offset.
