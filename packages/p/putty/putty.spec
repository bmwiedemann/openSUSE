%description
PuTTY is a suite of terminal emulator application and client for
serial consoles, raw TCP connections, and the computing protocols
SSH, Telnet and rlogin.

The "pterm" program is just the graphical terminal emulator similar
to xterm, "plink" is just the (console-based) SSH client similar to
openssh, and "putty" is the program that combines both in one.
