  <description>Cmapfile is a Python library and console script to write Chimera Map (CMAP) files, HDF5 files containing series of 3D XYZ datasets.

CMAP files can be created from numpy arrays and various file formats containing volume data, e.g. BIN, TIFF, LSM, OIF, and OIB.

CMAP files can be visualized using UCSF Chimera [2], a highly extensible program for interactive visualization and analysis of molecular structures and related data.</description>
