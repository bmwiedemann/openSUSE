%description
IMAPClient is a Pythonic IMAP client library.

Features:
    * Arguments and return values are natural Python types.
    * IMAP server responses are parsed and readily usable.
    * IMAP unique message IDs (UIDs) and internationalised
      mailbox names are handled transparently.
    * Time zones are handled.
    * Convenience methods are provided for commonly used functionality.
    * Exceptions are raised when errors occur.

IMAPClient includes comprehensive units tests and automated
functional tests that can be run against a live IMAP server.
