Wed Nov 17 08:15:44 UTC 2021 - Andreas Schneider <asn@cryptomilk.org>

- Update to 3.3.5, which provides many bug fixes and also these new features:
  - There is a new bounce_notify_admin_on_bounce_increment list
    setting and a corresponding list:admin:notice:increment
    template for the notice. This setting, if True, will cause a
    notice to be sent to the list admins when a member's bounce
    score is incremented, but doesn't disable delivery.
  - There is a new moderator_request_life setting in the
    [mailman] section of mailman.cfg that controls the lifetime
    of pending moderator requests as opposed to pending user
    confirmations.  Default is 180 days.
  - There is a new task runner to do periodic tasks.  The current
    implementation evicts expired pendings and cache entries
    and removes orphaned workflows and orphaned message store
    messages.  It does these tasks at intervals defined by the
    new run_tasks_every setting in the [mailman] section of
    mailman.cfg. Default is 1 hour.
  - There is a new list:admin:notice:pending template for the
    notice from the mailman notify command.
  - The nntp runner will now run the gatenews subcommand at
    intervals defined by a new gatenews_every setting in the
    [nntp] section of mailman.cfg. Default is 5 every minutes.
  - Check the REST API password in a way that is resistant to
    timing attacks. (CVE-2021-34337)
- Added support-alembic-1-7.patch
- Removed obsolete support-click-8-0.patch
- Added rpmlintrc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 30 01:57:56 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

Tue May  4 09:23:40 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

  packages.

Mon Mar 22 08:09:48 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- dropped obsolete gl823_exclude_failing_tests.patch
- Update to 3.3.4
  * Bugs
    * Require aiosmtpd >= 1.4.1 to allow address local parts longer than 64 bytes
      in the lmtp runner.  (Closes #836)
    * The email join command now honors the digest=<no|mime|plain> option.
      (Closes #19)
    * Folded ``Message-ID`` headers no longer cause folded smtp.log messages.
      (Closes #844)
    * Removal of headers from posts to anonymous lists that can reveal the poster
      or the poster's domain has been improved.  (Closes #848)
  * Command line
    * The ``notify`` subcommand will now decode an RFC 2047 encoded Subject: for
      the report of held messages.  (Closes #831)
    * The deprecated options ``--add``, ``--del`` and ``--sync`` are now disabled
      on the ``mailman members`` command.
  * REST
    * Improve the speed of Members lookup via REST API. (Related to #700)
    * Allow specifying ``delivery_mode`` and ``delivery_status`` when creating a
      new Member. (Closes #828)
    * Allow filtering members in ``/members/find`` API using ``delivery_status``,
      ``delivery_mode`` and ``moderation_action``. (See #827)
  * New Features
    * There is a new setting ``filter_report`` in the ``[mailman]`` section of
      mailman.cfg.  If this is set to ``yes``, a report of changes by content
      filtering will be added to the outgoing message.  (Closes #833)
    * There is a new setting ``check_max_size_on_filtered_message`` in the
      ``[mailman]`` section of mailman.cfg.  If this is set to ``yes`` and the
      list does content filtering, the ``max_message_size`` hold will be based
      on the size of the content filtered message.  (Closes #377)
    * There is a new setting ``anonymous_list_keep_headers`` in the ``[mailman]``
      section of mailman.cfg.  This is part of improved removal of headers from
      posts to anonymous lists.  This setting is a space separated list of regexp
      patterns.  After anonomyzing removes the headers which are known to reveal
      the poster or poster's domain, it then removes all headers whose names do
      not match (case-insensitively) one of these patterns.  The default setting
      keeps non X- headers, those X- headers added by Mailman and any X-Spam-
      headers.
