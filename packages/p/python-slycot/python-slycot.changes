Wed Dec 21 09:38:17 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.5.3
  * This patch release updates the build system to be compatible
    with NumPy 1.24.0 -- gh#python-control/Slycot#187
- Drop rpmlintc: python-tests-in-package has been dropped

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 23 21:15:35 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v0.5.2
  * Drop Support for Python 3.7
- Release v0.5.1
  * This release is a minor change in the build system. There are
    no new wrappers or code changes of existing SLICOT wrappers.
  * Use FindPython instead of deprecated FindPythonLibs by
    @bnavigator in #181
  * Use setuptools_scm instead of custom version determination code
    by @bnavigator in #180
  * Support Python 3.11 by @bnavigator in #182

- Restore finding correctly flavored f2py during build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  9 12:04:37 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.5.0
  * We've switched our Fortran SLICOT base from the older,
    GPL-licensed version 5.0 to the now BSD-licensed version of
    SLICOT hosted on Github. This specific version of Slycot is
    based on SLICOT v5.8.
  * Slycot itself remains GPL-licensed for the time being.
  * We've added a wrapper for SLICOT AB13MD (#171), which computes
    the upper bound for the structured singular value of a system
    and given uncertainty structure.
  * SB03OD used to raise an error if the Schur factor supplied in
    array A was unstable; now, a warning is raised, and the
    eigenvalues are still returned (via #176, which updates to
    SLICOT v5.8).
  * MB03RD correctly handles X=None, the default (#139).
  * In SB03MD, the LDWORK value computed for discrete-time case was
    corrected (#166).
  * AG08BD testing was made more numerically robust.
  * A test for XERBLA behaviour was fixed.
- Switch to PEP517 build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 28 20:16:23 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Use the correct alternative for f2py during build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 18 01:35:19 UTC 2021 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Skip python36 because of SciPy 1.6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  2 11:19:24 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- remove pytest_arch PYTHONPATH workaround, fixed in python-rpm-macros

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 30 09:36:05 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Remove the ppc workaround and skip the failing test entirely.
- Remove openblas configuration; link to Generic implementation.
  This lets update-alternatives select the implementation at runtime.
  Optimized packages are pulled in by numpy-devel and scipy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 26 15:59:21 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- break test loop before test matrices are too ill-conditioned for
  the ppc architecture
- remove python2 support: there is no python2-scikit-build
- requires cmake >= 3.11 (no leap 15.1)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 30 14:03:41 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 0.4.0.0 
  * Added periodic Schur decomposition functions mb03vd, mb03vy, and mb03wd
  * Added ab08nz, allowing one to find zeros of complex-valued state-space models
  * Added mb03rd, Schur to block-diagonal transform
  * Added sb01fd H-infinity solver
    Already present sb10ad searches for a minimum gamma value for a given 
    H-infinity problem; sb10fd, by contrast, only attempts to solve for a given 
    gamma value. This can be used to test for admissible gamma values, which 
    could be useful for problems like python-control/python-control#367.
  * New Slycot exception hierarchy; greatly improved Slycot error handling.
    Slycot routines now raise SlycotValueError where they would previously have 
    raised ValueError, and SlycotArithmeticError where they would have raised 
    ArithmeticError.
    These changes are backwardly compatible: SlycotValueError is a subclasss of 
    ValueError, and SlycotArithmeticError is a subclass of ArithmeticError.
    As part of this, many of the Slycot function docstrings were changed to 
    conform to numpydoc conventions.
    This supersedes an earlier fix for python-control#347 made during 0.4.0 
    development.
  * Override XERBLA
    Overrode the BLAS error function XERBLA that SLICOT routines use to report 
    errors; the BLAS-provided XERBLA can terminate the whole Python process.
  * Correct application of DGEBAL in TB01TD and TB05AD
  * Fixed ab01nd for jobz='N' case
  * conda build recipes no longer use pip
  * added conda recipes for MKL and Apple
  * removed conda recipes for Windows; no developer is using them, and they 
    weren't working
  * the signature files (.pyf files) are now a dependency of wrapper generation
    Testing
  * Tests added for mb05nd, mc01td, ab08nd, ab08nz, mb03vd, mb03vy, mb03wd.
  * Tests fixed or expanded for mb05md, sg03ad, td04ad.
  * Switched to pytest; Slycot CI now uses pytest for both the Slycot and 
     python-control test suites.
  * CI now builds and tests for Linux and macOS. The Linux builds include 
    OpenBLAS and MKL variants.
  * Examples are run as part of tests. Outputs are not checked, but errors and 
    warnings are.
  * CI coveralls.io integration fixed.
  * General test clean-up.
  * Test files are no longer executable.
  * Fix for mb05nd.
  * Lots of clean-up: removal of unused mathematical.pyf, many docstring fixes, 
    and some PEP 8 conformance changes to Python code.
  * Fix for Fortran-compiler dependence on machine value used to represent 
    logical values .TRUE. and .FALSE.
  * @repagh fired up his time machine and ensured punch-card compatibility of 
    the SLICOT Fortran code by limiting line lengths to 72 characters.
