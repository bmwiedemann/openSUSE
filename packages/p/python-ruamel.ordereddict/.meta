  <title>Python ordered dict</title>
  <description>This is an implementation of an ordered dictionary with Key Insertion Order (KIO: updates of values do not affect the position of the key), Key Value Insertion Order (KVIO, an existing keyâ€™s position is removed and put at the back). The standard library module OrderedDict, implemented later, implements a subset of ordereddict functionality.

Sorted dictionaries are also provided. Currently only with Key Sorted Order (KSO, no sorting function can be specified, but you can specify a transform to apply on the key before comparison (e.g. string.lower)).</description>
