%description
This is an implementation of an ordered dictionary with Key Insertion Order
(KIO: updates of values do not affect the position of the key), Key Value
Insertion Order (KVIO, an existing keyâ€™s position is removed and put at the
back). The standard library module OrderedDict, implemented later, implements
a subset of ordereddict functionality.

Sorted dictionaries are also provided. Currently only with Key Sorted Order
(KSO, no sorting function can be specified, but you can specify a transform to
apply on the key before comparison (e.g. string.lower)).
