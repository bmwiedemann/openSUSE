  <title>parallel virsh command to manage selected group of Virtual Machine</title>
  <description>This wrapper is a parallel virsh command to manage a selected group of Virtual Machine. This provides an easy way to execute the same command on a selected group of Virtual Machine. If you want to manage more than 1 VM you need to script your action and this will be done in a sequential way (most of the time).</description>
