<package name="perl-Net-SMTP-SSL" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>SSL support for Net::SMTP</title>
  <description>Implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL for its
network operations. Due to the nature of 'Net::SMTP''s 'new' method, it is
not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service. Perhaps
future versions will be smart like that. Port '465' is usually what you
want, and it's not a pain to specify that.

For interface documentation, please see Net::SMTP.</description>
