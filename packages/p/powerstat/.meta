  <title>Laptop power measuring tool</title>
  <description>Powerstat measures the power consumption of a mobile PC that has a battery
power source. The output is like vmstat but also shows power consumption
statistics. At the end of a run, powerstat will calculate the average,
standard deviation and min/max of the gathered data.
