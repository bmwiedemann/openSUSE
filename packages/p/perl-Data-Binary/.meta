  <title>Simple detection of binary versus text in strings</title>
  <description>This simple module provides string equivalents to the -T / -B operators. Since these only work on file names and file handles, this module provides the same functions but on strings.

Note that the actual implementation is currently different, basically because the -T / -B functions are in C/XS, and this module is written in pure Perl. For now, anyway.</description>
