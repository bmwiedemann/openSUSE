- Update to 2.8.0:

    the need for plugin_pack.py.
  * Set the glib dependency to versions >= 2.32.0.
  * Set the gtk dependency to versions >= 2.10.0.
  * Removed the irssi happy new year easter egg.
  * Removed xmms-remote as XMMS 1.x has been dead for quite some time.
  * Removed the autoprofile plugin as it was incomplete and unlikely to be
    completed.
  * Removed the infopane plugin as it wasn't very useful.
  * Removed the talkfilters plugin as its dependencies are not typically
    packaged by distributions anymore.
  * Removed the Napster plugin as opennap hasn't been updated in 20 years.
  * Removed the xchat-chats plugin as it's kind of hacky and bundles a very
    old version of the xchat widget.

    completed.
  * Removed the buddy icon tools plugin as it was incomplete and unlikely to be completed.
  * Removed the buddytime plugin as it was incomplete and unlikely to be

    completed.
  * Removed the nomobility plugin as it was incomplete and unlikely to be
    completed.
  * Removed the msglen plugin as it was incomplete and unlikely to be completed.

    completed.
  * Removed the hideconv plugin as its functionality is in pidgin 2.3.0 and
    newer.

  * Removed the stress plugin as it didn't build by default.

Mon Mar 19 15:12:01 UTC 2018 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Add a missing build dependency: python2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 23 11:13:30 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Replace purple-plugin_pack-autoprofile-crash.patch with
  purple-plugin-pack-fix-autoprofile-crash.patch, a very simple
  patch to do the job.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 19 15:38:25 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Add pkgconfig(json-glib-1.0) BuildRequires to build new Ning,
  OkCupid and Omegle protocol plugins.
- Create extras subpackages:
  + The main reason is to mitigate the risk of license
    incompatibilities between GPL-3.0+ plugins and other plugins
    that could be non-GPL-3.0-compatible.
  + Move the GPL-3.0+ plugins to extras subpackages.
  + Clearly document in summaries and descriptions why we have
    extras subpackages.
  + This should fix bnc#741195.

  + Added icon-override plugin
  + Added translate plugin
  + Added Ning protocol plugin
  + Added OkCupid protocol plugin

  + Support new Freenode IDENTIFY syntax in IRC Helper so users can
    log into services even when using an alternate or new nick.
  + IRC Helper now properly supports and suppresses new Freenode
    welcome and identified messages.
  + Updated website string to reflect project move from Trac to
    Redmine
  + Changed package name from purple-plugin_pack to
    purple-plugin-pack.
  + The Album plugin should no longer crash on non-buddies.
- Renamed source package from purple-plugin_pack to
  purple-plugin-pack, following upstream change. This also results
  in:

    (see below for why it's purple-plugin_pack
  + pidgin-plugin_pack Provides/Obsoletes in pidgin-plugin-pack.

  purple-plugin_pack-fix-localedir.patch: fixed upstream.
