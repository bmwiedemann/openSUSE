  <title>Build and install Perl modules</title>
  <description>`Module::Build' is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl modules. It is meant to be an alternative to `ExtUtils::MakeMaker'. Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a much more straightforward way than with `MakeMaker'. It also does not require a `make' on your system - most of the `Module::Build' code is
pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way. In fact, you don`t even need a shell, so even platforms like MacOS (traditional) can use it fairly easily. Its only prerequisites are modules that are included with perl 5.6.0, and it works fine on perl 5.005 if you can install a few additional modules.
