  <title>Spiffy Framework with No Source Filtering</title>
  <description>&quot;Class::Spiffy&quot; is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented
(OO) programming in Perl. Class::Spiffy combines the best parts of
Exporter.pm, base.pm, mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation
class. It attempts to fix all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in
a clean, straightforward and (perhaps someday) standard way.</description>
