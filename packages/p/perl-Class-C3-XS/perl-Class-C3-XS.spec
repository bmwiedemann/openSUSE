%description
This contains XS performance enhancers for Class::C3 version 0.16 and
higher. The main Class::C3 package will use this package automatically if
it can find it. Do not use this package directly, use Class::C3 instead.

The test suite here is not complete, although it does verify a few basic
things. The best testing comes from running the Class::C3 test suite
*after* this module is installed.

This module won't do anything for you if you're running a version of
Class::C3 older than 0.16. (It's not a dependency because it would be
circular with the optional dependency from that package to this one).
