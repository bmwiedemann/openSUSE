- Update to Version 0.13
  - Port to Python >= 3.3 (requiring Python 2.6/2.7 for 2.x).
  - Fixed bug with using per-memoize timeouts greater than the default timeout
  - Added better support for per-instance memoization.
  - Various bug fixes
- Update to Version 0.12
  - Changes jinja2 cache templates to use stable predictable keys. Previously
    the key for a cache tag included the line number of the template, which made
    it difficult to predict what the key would be outside of the application.
  - Adds config variable `CACHE_NO_NULL_WARNING` to silence warning messages
    when using 'null' cache as part of testing.
  - Adds passthrough to clear entire cache backend.
- Update to Version 0.11.1
  - Bugfix for using memoize on instance methods.
  The previous key was id(self), the new key is repr(self)
- Update to Version 0.11
  - Fail gracefully in production if cache backend raises an exception.
  - Support for redis DB number
  - Jinja2 templatetag cache now concats all args together into a single key
    instead of treating each arg as a separate key name.
  - Added delete memcache version hash function
  - Support for multiple cache objects on a single app again.
  - Added SpreadSASLMemcached, if a value is greater than the memcached threshold
    which defaults to 1MB, this splits the value across multiple keys.
  - Added support to use URL to connect to redis.
- Update to Version 0.10.1
  - Added warning message when using cache type of 'null'
  - Changed imports to relative instead of absolute for AppEngine compatibility
- Update to Version 0.10.0
  - Added `saslmemcached` backend to support Memcached behind SASL authentication.
  - Fixes a bug with memoize when the number of args != number of kwargs
- Update to Version 0.9.2
  - Bugfix with default kwargs
- Update to Version 0.9.1- Update to 
  - Fixes broken memoized on functions that use default kwargs
- Update to Version 0.9.0
  - Fixes memoization to work on methods.
- Update to Version 0.8.0
  - Migrated to the new flask extension naming convention of flask_cache instead of flaskext.cache
  - Removed unnecessary dependencies in setup.py file.
  - Documentation updates
- Update to Version 0.7.0
  - Allows multiple cache objects to be instantiated with different configuration values.
- Update to Version 0.6.0
  - Memoization is now safer for multiple applications using the same backing store.
  - Removed the explicit set of NullCache if the Flask app is set testing=True
  - Swapped Conditional order for key_prefix
- Update to Version 0.5.0
  - Deleting memoized functions now properly functions in production
    environments where multiple instances of the application are running.
  - get_memoized_names and get_memoized_keys have been removed.
  - Added ``make_name`` to memoize, make_name is an optional callable that can be passed
    to memoize to modify the cache_key that gets generated.
  - Added ``unless`` to memoize, this is the same as the unless parameter in ``cached``
  - memoization now converts all kwargs to positional arguments, this is so that
    when a function is called multiple ways, it would evaluate to the same cache_key
