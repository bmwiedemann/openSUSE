- Update to version 1.3.6
  - Security:
    - Check that a user owns the email address they are trying
      to unsubscribe. This fixes a bug in which any logged-in
      user could unsubscribe any email address from any mailing
      list, leaking whether that address was subscribed
      originally. (CVE-2021-40347)
  - UI:
    - Add 'Delivery Mode' and 'Moderation Action' columns to
    - List members page.  Add support to list and handle pending
      un-subscription requests.
    - Add support to specify a reason when handling
      (un)subscription requests
    - Success messages to mass subscribes now properly
      distinguish subscription from invitation and indicate
      possible pending confirmation or approval.
    - User profile dropdown no longer is too far right.
    - Expose archive_rendering_mode in Archiver settings to
      choose between plaintext and rich text rendering of emails
      in Hyperkitty.
    - Allow choosing delivery_mode and delivery_status when
      subscribing to a List.
    - Redirect to domain_index after domain_edit succeeds.
    - Expose new bounce_notify_owner_on_bounce_increment list
      setting on Bounce Processing settings, and expose the
      corresponding template.
    - Expose the forward_unrecognized_bounces_to setting on
      Bounce Processing settings.
    - Clarified the description of Maximum number of recipients.

      subscriptions with delivery_mode and delivery_status.

    - Allow searching for users in list user views.
    - Show both display name and email in user management
      interface if available,
    - Allow list:admin:notice:pending template to be set in
      Postorius.

      Members.
    - Fix a bug where users with multiple subscriptions to a List
      couldn't view their Preferences for all addresses.
    - Check for pending unsubscription requests and notify user
      when the request is pending approval.
    - Improve the performance of Members' page by skipping an API
      call.
    - Improve the performance of List index page for Superuser.
    - Skip looking up choosable_domains for non-superuser to
      reduce API calls.
    - Improve the performance of List owner access checks.
    - Add a new APICountingMiddleware to performance testing
      purposes.
    - Use user_id as subscriber instead of addresses to improve
      the efficiency of list index page.
    - AUTOCREATE_MAILMAN_USER setting is now removed and
      a Mailman user is always created when a User object in
      created in Django. Also remove duplicate implementation of
      get_mailman_user from MailmanUserManager so that we can use
      a single implementation that uses caching for efficient
      lookups. Bump bundled jQuery to 3.6.0.slim version.
    - Use the full jQuery not the slim version.
    - Do not show Ownerships and Moderator roles in the
      'Subscriptions' page under mange new user interface.
  - Ascessibility:
    - Move the focus to the textarea in mass subscribe page if
      there are errors in the form.
