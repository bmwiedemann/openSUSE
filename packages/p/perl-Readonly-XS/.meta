  <title>Companion module for Readonly.pm, to speed up read-only scalar variables</title>
  <description>This is a companion module to Readonly.pm.  You do not use
Readonly::XS directly.  Instead, once it is installed, Readonly.pm
will detect this and will use it for creating read-only scalars.  This
results in a significant speed improvement.  This does not speed up
read-only arrays or hashes.</description>
