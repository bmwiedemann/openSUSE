%description
This module implements the C3 algorithm. I have broken this out into it's
own module because I found myself copying and pasting it way too often for
various needs. Most of the uses I have for C3 revolve around class building
and metamodels, but it could also be used for things like dependency
resolution as well since it tends to do such a nice job of preserving local
precedence orderings.

Below is a brief explanation of C3 taken from the Class::C3 module. For
more detailed information, see the SEE ALSO section and the links there.
