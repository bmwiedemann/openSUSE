- Updated to version 8
  * You can now use the time variable in window shaders to get a
    timestamp. An example usage is to create animated effects,
    e.g. https://streamable.com/e0x7r
  * --max-brightness, which allows you to dim windows that are
    too bright. When enabled, all windows' average brightness will
    be clamped to the set value.
  * Automatic configuration file reloading after it's changed.
  * A lot of the artifacts seen with blur and use-damage enabled
    are fixed.
  * _NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR property are now handled.
    (Related to i3/i3lock#204)
  * Completely transparent windows won't have a blurred background
    anymore.
  * Improved fullscreen window detection. Now EWMH is used to
    detect fullscreen windows as well. You can turn it off with
    --no-ewmh-fullscreen
  * Various improvments to the inverter.sh script
  * wintype notify has been renamed to notification to match the
    EWMH names. (Old name still works)
  * picom no longer sets the opacity property on windows based on
    opacity rules. This is to fix the problem where picom "forgets"
    it set the opacity property after, e.g., window manager
    restarts.
  * libxdg-basedir is no longer a dependency
  * Fixed wrong client window detection after i3wm restarts
  * Fixed wallpaper disappearing after screen resolution changes.
  * Fixed crashing when a really big window is created with shadow
  * Fixed --frame-opacity with the experimental backends
  * --blur-* command line options are now handled properly
  * Various build fixes
  * Various memory leakage fixes
  * Various documentation fixes and improvments
  * Various other crash, assertion failure fixes
  * Fixed some left over problems related to terminals in floating
    scratchpads losing transparency after restarting i3
  * Using these options is now an error: alpha-step, -d, -S,
    --no-named-pixmap xrender-sync. They were deprecated in v5.
    paint-on-overlay, --dbe. They were deprecated in v4.
  * Error messages will no longer be printed for these removed
    options: glx-use-copysubbuffermesa, glx-copy-from-front.
    They were removed in v7
