- Update to version 10
  * picom now needs libEGL to build
Notable changes:
  * experimental-backends is now the default. Everything should
    keep working, except the --glx-fshader-win option. The old
    window shader support has been replaced by --window-shader-fd.
    This new shader support has a different interface, so you have
    to adapt your existing shaders.
    gh#yshui/picom#875
  * legacy-backends option has been added so you can go back to the
    old backends, which will eventually be removed.
  * picom.desktop is installed to /etc/xdg/autostart/.
    picom should autostart now.
    gh#yshui/picom#791
  * Shadows and blur now match the shape of the window.
    This includes windows using the XShape extension, and windows
    with rounded corners.
    gh#yshui/picom#882
  * New option: --transparent-clipping-exclude, for excluding
    windows that doesn't play well with transparent-clipping,
    such as screenshot tool windows.
    gh#yshui/picom#663
    gh#yshui/picom#738
  * New backend: egl. It should behave exactly the same as the glx
    backend. Give it a try!
    gh#yshui/picom#878
Other changes:
  * --help messages have been refactored, leading to clearer code.
    gh#yshui/picom#877
  * picom tries to detect and act on GPU resets. But because of the
    limitation of the X server, this ended up not being very
    useful.

- Updated to version 8
  * You can now use the time variable in window shaders to get a
    timestamp. An example usage is to create animated effects,
    e.g. https://streamable.com/e0x7r
  * --max-brightness, which allows you to dim windows that are
    too bright. When enabled, all windows' average brightness will
    be clamped to the set value.
  * Automatic configuration file reloading after it's changed.
  * A lot of the artifacts seen with blur and use-damage enabled
    are fixed.
  * _NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR property are now handled.
    (Related to i3/i3lock#204)
  * Completely transparent windows won't have a blurred background
    anymore.
  * Improved fullscreen window detection. Now EWMH is used to
    detect fullscreen windows as well. You can turn it off with
    --no-ewmh-fullscreen
  * Various improvments to the inverter.sh script
  * wintype notify has been renamed to notification to match the
    EWMH names. (Old name still works)
  * picom no longer sets the opacity property on windows based on
    opacity rules. This is to fix the problem where picom "forgets"
    it set the opacity property after, e.g., window manager
    restarts.
  * libxdg-basedir is no longer a dependency
  * Fixed wrong client window detection after i3wm restarts
  * Fixed wallpaper disappearing after screen resolution changes.
  * Fixed crashing when a really big window is created with shadow
  * Fixed --frame-opacity with the experimental backends
  * --blur-* command line options are now handled properly
  * Various build fixes
  * Various memory leakage fixes
  * Various documentation fixes and improvments
  * Various other crash, assertion failure fixes
  * Fixed some left over problems related to terminals in floating
    scratchpads losing transparency after restarting i3
  * Using these options is now an error: alpha-step, -d, -S,
    --no-named-pixmap xrender-sync. They were deprecated in v5.
    paint-on-overlay, --dbe. They were deprecated in v4.
  * Error messages will no longer be printed for these removed
    options: glx-use-copysubbuffermesa, glx-copy-from-front.
    They were removed in v7
