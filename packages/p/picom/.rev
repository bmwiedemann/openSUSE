    <comment>- Since it requires dbus, use dbus by default. 
- Updated to version 8
  * You can now use the time variable in window shaders to get a
    timestamp. An example usage is to create animated effects,
    e.g. https://streamable.com/e0x7r
  * --max-brightness, which allows you to dim windows that are
    too bright. When enabled, all windows' average brightness will
    be clamped to the set value.
  * Automatic configuration file reloading after it's changed.
  * A lot of the artifacts seen with blur and use-damage enabled
    are fixed.
  * _NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR property are now handled.
    (Related to i3/i3lock#204)
  * Completely transparent windows won't have a blurred background
    anymore.
  * Improved fullscreen window detection. Now EWMH is used to
    detect fullscreen windows as well. You can turn it off with
    --no-ewmh-fullscreen
  * Various improvments to the inverter.sh script
  * wintype notify has been renamed to notification to match the
    EWMH names. (Old name still works)
  * picom no longer sets the opacity property on windows based on
    opacity rules. This is to fix the problem where picom &quot;forgets&quot;
    it set the opacity property after, e.g., window manager
    restarts.
  * libxdg-basedir is no longer a dependency
  * Fixed wrong client window detection after i3wm restarts
  * Fixed wallpaper disappearing after screen resolution changes.
  * Fixed crashing when a really big window is created with shadow
  * Fixed --frame-opacity with the experimental backends
  * --blur-* command line options are now handled properly
  * Various build fixes
  * Various memory leakage fixes
  * Various documentation fixes and improvments
  * Various other crash, assertion failure fixes
  * Fixed some left over problems related to terminals in floating
    scratchpads losing transparency after restarting i3
  * Using these options is now an error: alpha-step, -d, -S,
    --no-named-pixmap xrender-sync. They were deprecated in v5.
    paint-on-overlay, --dbe. They were deprecated in v4.
  * Error messages will no longer be printed for these removed
    options: glx-use-copysubbuffermesa, glx-copy-from-front.
    They were removed in v7

    <comment>- Update to version 10
  * picom now needs libEGL to build
Notable changes:
  * experimental-backends is now the default. Everything should
    keep working, except the --glx-fshader-win option. The old
    window shader support has been replaced by --window-shader-fd.
    This new shader support has a different interface, so you have
    to adapt your existing shaders.
    gh#yshui/picom#875
  * legacy-backends option has been added so you can go back to the
    old backends, which will eventually be removed.
  * picom.desktop is installed to /etc/xdg/autostart/.
    picom should autostart now.
    gh#yshui/picom#791
  * Shadows and blur now match the shape of the window.
    This includes windows using the XShape extension, and windows
    with rounded corners.
    gh#yshui/picom#882
  * New option: --transparent-clipping-exclude, for excluding
    windows that doesn't play well with transparent-clipping,
    such as screenshot tool windows.
    gh#yshui/picom#663
    gh#yshui/picom#738
  * New backend: egl. It should behave exactly the same as the glx
    backend. Give it a try!
    gh#yshui/picom#878
Other changes:
  * --help messages have been refactored, leading to clearer code.
    gh#yshui/picom#877
  * picom tries to detect and act on GPU resets. But because of the</comment>
