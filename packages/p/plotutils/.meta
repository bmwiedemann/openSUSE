  <title>GNU Plotting Utilities</title>
  <description>The GNU plotting utilities consist of seven command line programs: the
graphics programs `graph', `plot', `tek2plot', and `plotfont', and the
mathematical programs `spline', `ode', and `double'.  GNU `libplot' is
distributed with these programs; it is the library on which the
graphics programs are based. `Libplot' is a function library for
device-independent two-dimensional vector graphics, including vector
graphics animations under the X Window System.</description>
