  <title>Manages IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets</title>
  <description>This module provides an object-oriented abstraction on top of IP addresses
or IP subnets, that allows for easy manipulations. Version 4.xx of
NetAdder::IP will will work older versions of Perl and does *not* use
Math::BigInt as in previous versions.

The internal representation of all IP objects is in 128 bit IPv6 notation.
IPv4 and IPv6 objects may be freely mixed.</description>
