%description
File::Which finds the full or relative paths to executable programs on the
system. This is normally the function of 'which' utility. 'which' is
typically implemented as either a program or a built in shell command. On
some platforms, such as Microsoft Windows it is not provided as part of the
core operating system. This module provides a consistent API to this
functionality regardless of the underlying platform.

The focus of this module is correctness and portability. As a consequence
platforms where the current directory is implicitly part of the search path
such as Microsoft Windows will find executables in the current directory,
whereas on platforms such as UNIX where this is not the case executables in
the current directory will only be found if the current directory is
explicitly added to the path.

If you need a portable 'which' on the command line in an environment that
does not provide it, install App::pwhich which provides a command line
interface to this API.
