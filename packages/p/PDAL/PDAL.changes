  * The Zstandard compression library is no longer required in order to build PDAL.
  * The Ubuntu conda image now installs all of PDAL under /usr.
  * The default type of the ClusterID dimension has changed from uint64_t to int64_t.

    arrays of dimensions, rather than arrays of point data. This can improve the
    performance of some operations substantially. Generally, this change should
    not be noticeable to users.
  * Normal refinement (refine option) in filters.normal is now off by default. (#3133)
  * All filters now accept a where option to allow points to skip the filters. (#3118)
  * PDAL now searches for plugins in the same directory containing the PDAL library. (#3181)

- Upstream release 1.1.0
  * Enhancements:
    Add support for the LAZperf LAS compressor in decoding/encoding
     LAS files. LAZperf can be enabled with the 'compression' option
     in readers.las and writers.las.
    Add PCL functionality as filters (filters.greedyprojection,
     filters.gridprojection, filters.ground filters.movingleastsquares,
     filters.poisson, filters.radiusoutlier, filters.statisticaloutlier,
     filters.voxelgrid, filters.height, filters.dartsample)
    Add readers.gdal to support reading raster sets as point clouds
    Update writers.geowave and readers.geowave to work with the latest
     version of GeoWave software.
    Add readers.ilvis2 to support the Icebridge ILVIS2 format.
    Disallow nested options. Check stage documentation for changes in
     option names and handling. (filters.ferry, filters.colorization,
     filters.attribute, filters.crop). Change filters.attribute to
     handle only a single dimension.
    Add 'output_dims' options in writers.bpf to allow control of the
     dimensions that should be written.
    Add 'all' keyword in 'extra_dims' options of writers.las to cause
     all dimensions to be written to either the standard or extra
     dimensions of a LAS point.
    Add filters.randomize to allow randomized order of points.
    Add filters.divider to split a set of points into subsets of a
     fixed number or into subsets containing a specific number
     of points.
    Update to version 1.1.4 of rply in readers.rply.
    Change the logic of the range filter to allow multiple ranges
     for a single dimension and support a simple boolean logic.
    Change the default scaling on writer.bpf to 'auto'.
    Add support for smoothing boundaries generated by filters.hexbin.
    Add readers.tindex to allow vector-filtered input of point
     cloud files.
    Allow merging of datasets with non-matching spatial references.
    Many, many documentation enhancements.

  * Fixes:
    Handle error with Pgpointcloud when pointcloud extension is not
     installed on postgres server. Skip tests if extension is missing.
    Set precision on output of doubles to metadata.
    Fix a divide-by-zero error in readers.faux when the point count
     was 1. (#1015)
    Fix fatal error loading numpy library that occurred when running
     filters.predicate or filters.programmable. (#1010)
    Correct readers.las to properly check WKT bit when choosing spatial
     reference VLR. (#1040)
    Correct writer.las to emit only WKT or GeoTiff VLR, not both.
     (#1040)
    Check object ID against table column id (attrelid) to ensure correct
     PCID retrieval in readers.pgpointcloud. (#1051)
