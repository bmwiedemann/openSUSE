- Fix package builds for Leap 15.2 and 15.3, requires python-xml

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  1 17:56:21 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- remove fix_tests_setupcfg.patch, included upstream
- update to version 2.3.0:
 - Added:
    - `textx generate`. Documented passing in arbitrary parameters which can be
      used in the generator function. Also, implemented passing of model
      parameters defined in the meta-model (`model_param_defs` and
      `_tx_model_params`) ([#299])
    - `get_location` function for producing `line/col/filename` from any textX
      object. ([#294])
    - `builtin_models` of type `ModelRepository` to meta-model constructor. Used
      to supply pre-loaded models for `ImportURI` based scoping providers as a
      fallback to search into. ([#284])
    - Initial implementation of TEP-001 ([#111]) allowing to specify scope
      provider behavior within the grammar itself. [#274] and [#287] introduce
      the RREL (reference resolving expression language) to define how
      references are resolved. Details see `rrel.md`.
    - Parameter `should_follow` of callable type to `get_children` and
      `get_children_of_type` model API calls to decide if the element should be
      traversed. ([#281])
 - Fixed:
    - Fixed bug with Falsy user classes in `get_children` ([#288])
    - Fixed bug with unhashable objects during dot export ([#283])
    - Fixed bug where (Ext)RelativeName scope providers accepted any referenced
      object that contained the lookup name in its name. Thanks ipa-mdl@GitHub
      ([#267])
    - Fixed bug in `flow_dsl` test project causing static files not being included
      in package build/installation. Thanks sebix@GitHub ([#272]).
    - Fixed bug, where user classes not used in the grammar caused exceptions
      ([#270]): now, when passing a list of user classes, you need to use them in
      your grammar. You can alternatively also pass a callable (see metamodel.md;
      [#273]). Also, using base classes for rules from imported grammars in 
      conjunction with user classes is not allowed and results in an exception.
    - Fixed bug in `export.py` concerning html escaping in the dot export of a
      textx meta-model ([#276]).
 - Changed:
    - `_tx_model_param_definitions` deprecated in favor of `model_param_defs` ([#298]).
    - `click` is now an optional dependency, only when CLI is needed ([#292])
    - Make warning about not overwriting generated file more visible
      ([01341ec3](https://github.com/textX/textX/commit/01341ec381bfb4c8c27bcec5d2998a34d207f430))
    - Truncate long strings during dot export for better diagram readability ([#282]).
    - Changed `unhashable type` exception when a list is used for `name` attributes by
      raising a more informative exception and extending docs to document the issue
      and a proper way to solve it ([#40], [#266]).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  6 13:16:43 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.2.0:
 - Added:
  - Initial docs for Jinja code generator support (from
    [textX-jinja](https://github.com/textX/textX-jinja)) ([#264]).
  - Analyzing grammars programmatically as plain textX models
    (`grammar_model_from_str/file`) ([#235])
  - Initial `startproject` scaffolding (from
    [textX-dev](https://github.com/textX/textX-dev)) docs ([#234])
  - Generator helper functions `get_output_filename` and `gen_file` ([#233])
  - `textx version` command ([#219])
  - Versions for languages/packages in `list-languages` and `list-generators`
    commands ([#228])
  - Added the ability to specify extra parameters during `model_from_file` or
    `model_from_str` and to define which extra parameters exist in the
    meta-model ([#243]).
 - Fixed:
  - Fixed several instances of invalid truthiness checking. Thanks
    markusschmaus@GitHub ([#250])
  - Fixed applying multiple grammar rule modifiers ([#246])
  - Fixed exception on calling `check` CLI command with relative path name.
  - Fixed return value of textx generate and check commands: we return a failure
    on error now ([#222])
  - Fixed type checking for references to builtin elements ([#218])
 - Changed:
  - User classes can now be immutable (e.g. `attr.frozen`) or can use
    `__slots__`. Thanks markusschmaus@GitHub ([#256, #260, #261])
  - Cleanup of setup configuration and install scripts [#231]
  - Dot/PlantUML rendering of meta-models: remove rendering of base types,
    improve rendering of required/optional, render match rules as a single
    table. ([#225])
  - Allow passing kwargs in `metamodel_for_file/language` registration API
    calls. ([#224])
- Add patch to fix tests:
  * fix_tests_setupcfg.patch

- %python3_only -> %python_alternative

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 11 11:27:12 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.1.0
  ### Added
  - Added new function `textx.scoping.is_file_included` ([#197]).
  ### Changed
  - Allow passing kwargs (specially - file_name) argument when loading metamodel
    from string (needed for `textX-LS v0.1.0`) ([#211]).
  - Changed the parser rule for regex matches. Spaces are not stripped any more
    from the beginning and the end of the regexp-pattern. This could be possible
    **BIC** for some special cases [#208].
  - Changed function name `textx.scoping.get_all_models_including_attached_models`
    to `textx.scoping.get_included_models` (marked old function
    as deprecated) ([#197]).
  - Delete all models touched while loading a model, when an error occurs
    while loading in all repositories (strong exception safety guarantee) ([#200]).

Sun Jun  2 15:22:59 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.0.1:
 - Added:
  - [Registration and discovery] of languages and generators ([#187])
  - New textx CLI commands for listing generators and languages
    (`list-generators`, `list-languages`) and calling a generator (`generate`) ([#187])
  - Meta-models may now [reference other registered meta-models] using the
    `reference` statement ([#187])
  - Adding examples and documentation related to scope providers (related to
    model modification through scope providers) ([#168])
  - metamodel export feature for [PlantUML] ([#165])
  - `textx_isinstance` from `textx.scoping.tools` made available in `textx`
    ([#164], [#157])
  - CLI extensibility ([#162], [#161])
  - An initial version of FAQ page ([#138]). Thanks Aluriak@GitHub
  - A version of `calc.py` exercises usage of
    `text.scoping.tools.textx_isinstance()` to inspect model objects types
    during traversal. ([#136], [#123]). Thanks dkrikun@GitHub
  - A version of `calc.py` in expression example that exercises dynamically adding
    properties to object classes ([#126]). Thanks dkrikun@GitHub
  - python like imports (named import rules, scope providers affected) ([#114])
  - Added `STRICTFLOAT` as buildin type to allow to distinguish ints from floats
    in `NUMBER`. Fixed docu link ([#98]). Possible **(BIC)**
  - Added [flake8] and [coverage] checking ([#92])
 - Changed:
  - All textX commands implemented using textX CLI extensibility. `check`
    command reworked to support the new registration feature ([#187]) **(BIC)**
  - (Meta-)model visualization reworked as a set of textX generators ([#187]).
    **(BIC)**
  - Made scope provider implementation of `RelativeName` and `ExtRelativeName`
    more readable ([#186]). Minor functional changes, not very probable to have
    any impact (only affects model-paths containing a list not at the end of the
    path; see [#186]). Possible **(BIC)**.
  - Improved handling of abstract rules references. Improved the definition of
    rules for various cases. Docs + tests ([#185], [#166]) **(BIC)**
  - Changed the time of call of match rule object processors to be during the
    model construction. This enable proper override of base types processors and
    calls on nested match rules ([#183], [#182], [#96]). Possible **(BIC)**
  - CLI migrated to the [click] library ([#162])
  - Docs improvements ([#146], [#153], [#151]). Thanks simkimsia@GitHub.
  - `FQN` constuctor param `follow_loaded_models` removed and introduced
    callback `scope_rediction_logic` to implement arbitrary logic on FQN
    resolution ([#133], [#114], [#103]) **(BIC)**
  - Changed attribute name for the meta-model object (from `metamodel._parser`
    to `metamodel._parser_blueprint`). ([#93]) **(BIC)**
  - Started using _[Keep a Changelog][keepachangelog]_ ([#174])
  - Started using _[Semantic Versioning][semver]_ ([#174])
  - Dropped support for Python 3.3
 - Fixed:
  - White-spaces in string matches were erroneously stripped ([#188])
  - Calling of match rule object processors ([#183], [#182], [#96])
  - Circular rule references in grammars ([#173], [#159], [#155])
  - Assertion error while calling object processors with multi meta models
    (extended grammars) and custom types ([#141], [#140])
  - Using a sequence of matches and rule reference in an abstract rule choice
    alternative, and explicitly disallowing referencing more than one rule in an
    abstract rule choice alternative ([#134])
  - Unicode requirement for (meta)-model strings API parameters made strict.
    This should prevent common errors with Python 2.x. ([#120]) (related: [#99],
    [#105], [#117]). Possible **(BIC)**
  - OS incompatibility fixes (path separator). ([#114])
  - Object processors called twice for imported models ([#108], [#118])
  - Documentation and examples regarding `NUMBER` base type ([#97], [#100]).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  6 20:48:57 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 1.7.0:
  - A major feature of this release is multi-(meta-)model support with
    configurable resolving techniques. Thanks Pierre Bayerl (goto40@GitHub)!

    The docs sections are [here](http://www.igordejanovic.net/textX/scoping/)
    and [here](http://www.igordejanovic.net/textX/multimetamodel/).

    Details follow:
    - added new function textx.get_model.children to search arbritrary children
      using a lambda predicate.
    - remapped textx.model.get_children_of_type to the new children function
    (changed the logic, such that the root node is also checked to be model
    object).
    - added new metamodel function to register scope providers. Scope providers
    are callables, which return the referenced object.
    - added optional attribute "_tx_model_repository", see metamodel.py
      documentation
    - added attribute "scope_provider" like "obj_processors" to organize scope
      providers
    - added an optional argument to model_from_str and model_from_file:
      "pre_ref_resolution_callback": this is required internally to prepare the
      loading of other model files.
    - changed reference resolution in model.py
      - moved default resolution to textx.scoping.py
      - select the scope provider based on rule and rule-attribute (see
        scoping.py documentation)
      - added a Postponed type to postpone the resolution
      - introduced a multi-pass resolution (implemented at the end of
        parse_tree_to_objgraph; introduced new helper argument, e.g., a new
        optional argument "is_this_the_main_model" and
        "pre_ref_resolution_callback" (see metamodel.py above) to support
        reference resolution in the presence of different model files.
    - added a new module textx.scoping, to provide some scope providers (e.g. a
      fully qualified name provider) - see scoping.py:
      - full qualified names for reference names (e.g. package.package.class)
      - global scope (model distributed over different files - loaded globally)
      - import scope (model distributed over different files - loaded when
        imported)
      - relative scopes (e.g. instance.method where method is defined for the
        class of the instance in a model of classes, methods and instances)
      - selecting the metamodel based on a file pattern when loading models
    - added tests (mostly scope related - some of them also test other stuff,
      like buildins)
    - exceptions where adapted to include a file name (makes errors more
      visible)
    - The metamodel now allows to specify a global model repository. With this
      you can now share models across metamodels (before you could only do this
      within one metamodel or language).
    - The metamodel clones the parser when parsing a model file. The meta model
      holds one parser, which is clone for every model to be parsed.
    - TextXModelParser now has a clone method.
      (TBC: is the clone ok: see responsibility of the method)
    - model.py: the resolution loop logic now mostly moved to a separate object
      ReferenceResolver, which holds the parser.
      - The reference resolver are build from all model files affected (loaded).
        This may involve multiple meta models.
      - Then all references are resolved in one loop.
      - Finally the helper objects (ReferenceResolver) are purged.
    - The MetaModelProvider has a clear-method now (useful for tests).
  - Backward incompatible change: match filters and object processors unified.
    Now there are only object processors but they are called for any type of
    rule and the returned value if exists is used instead of the original
    object. See [the
    docs](http://www.igordejanovic.net/textX/metamodel/#object-processors). In
    order to migrate your match filters just register them as object processors.
  - Fixing FLOAT regex. Thanks Boris Marin (borismarin@GitHub)!
  - Fixing position info on obj cross ref. Thanks Daniel Elero (danixeee@GitHub)!
