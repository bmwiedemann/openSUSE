    <comment>- Update to 2.0:
  * New: Waveform is loaded on-the-fly, there is no blocking progress
    dialog. This brings an API bump in libparlatype.
  * New: Waveform can be changed continuously instead of in bumps.
  * New: Application ID has been changed to org.parlatype.Parlatype and the
    homepage moved to https://www.parlatype.org.
  * New: LibreOffice helpers (macros) have been split from the main
    repository and turned into a LibreOffice extension.
    The extension is released at
    https://github.com/gkarsay/parlatype-libreoffice-extension/releases/tag/v2.0
  * New: New D-Bus method GetURI to get currently playing file's URI.
  * New: Internal modularization (PtController objects control Parlatype).
  * New: Event handling is more compatible with GTK 4.
  * New: Parlatype builds on Windows, there is no feature parity though.

    <comment>- Update to 2.1:
  * New: Mute/unmute volume by clicking on the volume icon with the pointer’s
    secondary button (usually right mouse button).
  * New: With Pulseaudio Parlatype doesn’t change the system volume anymore,
    just its own application specific volume.
  * New: With Pulseaudio Parlatype picks up the last used volume level.
  * New: Volume icon/button is insensitive as long as there is no media loaded.
  * New: Don’t reopen already opened files.
  * New: Set a default window height and in Preferences default to “Remember
    window’s size”.
  * Fix: ASR assistant dialog could not be used at all, a regression introduced
    in version 2.0. However, ASR is not recommended in its current state
    and plans are to rewrite it.
  * Fix: D-Bus interface for decreasing speed was doing the opposite.
  * Fix: Many fixes to Windows (win32) port, achieving feature parity with the
    Linux/UNIX version:
    - Fix: Parlatype icon not loaded
    - Fix: Help pages not displayed
    - Fix: Don’t show mediakeys help page (Linux only)
    - Fix: Volume changes delayed for a few seconds
    - New: Ensure there is only one instance running.
    - New: Added hotkeys support (hardcoded for dedicated keyboard buttons
    Play/Pause, Stop, Previous Track, Next Track)
    - New: Added win32 specific interprocess communication, thus enabling
    the LibreOffice extension
  * Update translations
- Remove parlatype-2.0-asr.patch: contained in release</comment>
