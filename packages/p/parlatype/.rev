    <comment>- Update to 2.0:
  * New: Waveform is loaded on-the-fly, there is no blocking progress
    dialog. This brings an API bump in libparlatype.
  * New: Waveform can be changed continuously instead of in bumps.
  * New: Application ID has been changed to org.parlatype.Parlatype and the
    homepage moved to https://www.parlatype.org.
  * New: LibreOffice helpers (macros) have been split from the main
    repository and turned into a LibreOffice extension.
    The extension is released at
    https://github.com/gkarsay/parlatype-libreoffice-extension/releases/tag/v2.0
  * New: New D-Bus method GetURI to get currently playing file's URI.
  * New: Internal modularization (PtController objects control Parlatype).
  * New: Event handling is more compatible with GTK 4.
  * New: Parlatype builds on Windows, there is no feature parity though.
- Add parlatype-2.0-asr.patch: Fix regression in the ASR assistant dialog.</comment>
