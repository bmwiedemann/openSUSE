- Update to 4.2:
  * This release of Parlatype and Parlatype LibreOffice Extension
    is triggered by the move to a new website, www.parlatype.xyz.
  * The website also the app ID has changed (xyz.parlatype.Parlatype)
    and the DBUS interface name. Because of that previous versions
    of Parlatype LibreOffice Extension are incompatible with this
    version of Parlatype.

  * New: ASR plugin for Mozilla DeepSpeech (needs DeepSpeech at compile time)
  * New: Removed possibility to output ASR results to random applications using
         assistive technologies and removed internal textpad. ASR results are
         emitted through D-Bus only and applications like Parlatype LibreOffice
         Extension can listen to them. Removed (now unnecessary option)
         --with-asr.
  * New: Rewritten ASR preferences page with Configs per model.
  * New: Internal GStreamer plugins are now private to the lib, which should
         eliminate all errors related to GStreamer registry.
  * New: Flatpak builds Mozilla DeepSpeech 0.9.
  * New: New App Icon by Tobias Bernard
  * New: Many preparations for GTK 4, maintenance work, modularizing and
         refactoring code, increased test coverage, fixed memory leaks.
  * New: Main development branch is now called "main".
  * New: Version string includes git commit if applicable
  * Fix: Don't mirror waveform in RTL layouts, they expect it to be like in LTR.

    - Removed atspi-2
    - Added iso-codes
    - Raised glib-2.0 to 2.58
    - Added optional deepspeech

Mon Jun 22 08:23:44 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.1:
  * New: Mute/unmute volume by clicking on the volume icon with the pointer’s
    secondary button (usually right mouse button).
  * New: With Pulseaudio Parlatype doesn’t change the system volume anymore,
    just its own application specific volume.
  * New: With Pulseaudio Parlatype picks up the last used volume level.
  * New: Volume icon/button is insensitive as long as there is no media loaded.
  * New: Don’t reopen already opened files.
  * New: Set a default window height and in Preferences default to “Remember
    window’s size”.
  * Fix: ASR assistant dialog could not be used at all, a regression introduced
    in version 2.0. However, ASR is not recommended in its current state
    and plans are to rewrite it.
  * Fix: D-Bus interface for decreasing speed was doing the opposite.
  * Fix: Many fixes to Windows (win32) port, achieving feature parity with the
    Linux/UNIX version:
    - Fix: Parlatype icon not loaded
    - Fix: Help pages not displayed
    - Fix: Don’t show mediakeys help page (Linux only)
    - Fix: Volume changes delayed for a few seconds
    - New: Ensure there is only one instance running.

    Play/Pause, Stop, Previous Track, Next Track)

    the LibreOffice extension

    dialog. This brings an API bump in libparlatype.

  * New: Application ID has been changed to org.parlatype.Parlatype and the
    homepage moved to https://www.parlatype.org.
  * New: LibreOffice helpers (macros) have been split from the main
    repository and turned into a LibreOffice extension.
    The extension is released at

  * New: New D-Bus method GetURI to get currently playing file's URI.
