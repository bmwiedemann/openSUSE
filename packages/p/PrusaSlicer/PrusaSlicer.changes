Sun Dec  8 16:40:40 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Changelog for 2.8.1
  * When using the wipe tower with "No sparse layers" option
    enabled, there would still be travels to the wipe tower
    location even for the skipped layers. This is a regression
    introduced in 2.8.1-rc1 (#13384).
  * A warning about inconsistent color profiles in PNGs used as
    Prusa Account avatar is now silently ignored (#12920).
  ## Improvements with respect to 2.8.0
  * Based on the feedback received after 2.8.0 release, the menu
    bar was reinstated and the menu no longer hides under a button.
    Thanks everyone for the feedback, it was very helpful and it
    will be taken into consideration during possible UI-related
    decisions in the future. #12943
  * When logging-in with the PrusaAccount using third party
    authorization (Google, Apple, Facebook), an external browser
    window is opened so the user is not forced to enter their
    credentials into windows created by PrusaSlicer.
  * The built-in web engine no longer remembers the user after
    logout.
  * There are two new parameters: Filaments->Advanced->Abrasive
    material and Printers->Extruder->High flow nozzle. Both flags
    will be used to check whether a sliced G-code is compatible
    with the given printer (abrasive material requires hardened
    nozzle) and also to ensure that "Set as current" function in
    PrusaSlicer-embedded Prusa Connect will select the suitable
    profile for the given configuration.
  * Note that this feature is supported since MINI/MK4/XL firmware
    version 6.2.0-alpha1, and that the implementation in Prusa
    Connect is not completely finished yet, meaning that the dialog
    where printer is selected does not use this information - it
    will later start working without the need to download a new
    slicer version.
  * Automatic orientation of bridges has been improved. Issues with
    unanchored bridges caused by inconvenient choice of their angle
    should now occur less frequently, although there is still a
    large class of scenarios where the solution is suboptimal.
  * The output of --query-printer-models command line option was
    extended to contain bed shape and dimensions. Note that custom
    bed shapes are currently not supported.
  * The 'new version available' notification can now be used to
    direct the user to our website, instead of just downloading the
    executable. As of now, we release two different Linux
    AppImages, so the user needs to be able to choose which one
    they want to download.
  * A new infill type called Zig-zag was created. It behaves the
    same as Rectilinear, except that the pattern is aligned between
    layers (Rectilinear is optimized for short travels, which leads
    to inconsistencies). The new infill may thus take slightly
    longer to print because of that, although the effect will be
    negligible in most prints. It is possible that Rectilinear and
    Zig-zag will be merged into a single infill type in one of the
    upcoming releases. #12613
  ## Bugs fixed with respect to 2.8.0
  * General improvement of Prusa Connect / PrusaAccount session
    stability. There were scenarios which led to uncommanded
    logouts from PrusaAccount, some resulting in partially blank
    Prusa Connect screen and requiring application restart to fix.
    The problems occurred after being logged on for a long time,
    after waking the PC up from sleep, or when internet connection
    was unstable.
  * Fixed missing G-code preview on setups using older GPUs
    (#12908).
  * Some settings were not applied when overridden per object
    (#12916).
  * Fixed adding SVGs as parts/modifiers. This was broken in 2.8.0
    (#12915).
  * Fixed UI glitch resulting in disappearing text in edit boxes
    after editing (#12932).
  * Fixed incorrect capture of keyboard input, which led to some
    keys being ignored (#13043).
  * Physical printer configured to use username/password
    authentication no longer asks the user for the credentials when
    opening the Physical Printer page (#12921, #12933).
  * Notification informing about the user having logged in into
    PrusaAccount occasionally showed even when the user was in fact
    logged in for a long time already (#12963, #13166).
  * Object shells incorrectly stayed visible after switching from
    FFF to SLA and back.
  * Fixed rotation slider in SVG tool when "Use surface" option was
    active (it incorrectly reverted to original position when
    released).
  * Changing Dynamic overhang speeds settings did not trigger
    G-code regeneration as is should have.
  * Fixed loading of specific OBJ files (#12157).
  * Fixed a crash when scaling to fit in specific cases (circular
    bed and objects with parts).
  * Fixed an infinite loop during infill generation stage occurring
    in rare cases (#11426).
  * 'Export Plate as STL/OBJ Including Supports' no longer exports
    non-printable objects.
  * Fixed zero velocity G-code commands when the pressure equalizer
    was combined with spiral vase mode. This bugfix was ported from
    OrcaSlicer. Thanks to @Noisyfox, @SoftFever and everyone
    involved.
  * Fixed incorrect Color Changes placement after reslicing in
    certain cases (#13008).
  * Reduced number of emitted M106 G-codes when dynamic fan speed
    on overhangs is enabled. Too many commands were generated even
    when the fan speed barely changed or did not change at all.
    #11981, #11856
  * Fixed missing update when adding Color Change with supports
    enabled.
  * Fixed crash when loading specific 3MFs containing Color Changes
    (#13038).
  * Adaptive layer height feature did not work when Z shrinkage
    compensation was used.
  * Fixed unexpected autoselection of SLA printer in Configuration
    Wizard in certain cases (#13058).
  * Fixed couple of usability issues with the vertical slider in
    preview (hovered ticks selection and reaction to mouse wheel)
    (#12944).
  * Fixed unexpected deceleration on overhangs with dynamic
    overhangs speed enabled.
  * Line infill did not generate at all when maximum anchor length
    was set to zero.
  * When seam position was set to Random, the algorithm would
    occasionally place the seam on a bridging perimeter.
  * Fixed erratic placement of seams occassionally happening with
    specific object geometry.
  * Fixed a problem in STEP file loading, which resulted in errors
    in the geometry of the loaded model (#12271, #12122).
  * Using certain fonts for the text embossing led to project files
    which PrusaSlicer was not able to open anymore (#13123).
  * Custom G-codes are not allowed to contain certain keywords
    which PrusaSlicer uses for internal purposes. The check that
    these keywords are not present was not working in the previous
    version. It is now fixed.
  * Fixed artifacts sometimes appearing in the "Actual speed"
    preview. The artifacts were a result of long-existing bug in
    the G-code processor, the "Actual speed" preview just made them
    visible. The bug could have led to incorrect time estimates for
    specific G-codes.
  * Fixed three distinct crashes in Configuration Wizard occurring
    after a specific sequence of steps.
  * Fixed a long-existing bug in the cooling logic, which resulted
    in zero or possibly negative extrusion commands in very rare
    cases.
  * Downloading from Printables did not work when the download
    folder contained non-ASCII characters.
  * Fixed selection of print host type in Physical Printer dialog.
    PrusaLink was missing in the list for several printers which
    actually support it. This also caused several other glitches
    (#13286).
  * The Connect status dots in the Printer Settings dropdown did
    not show for SLA printers.
  * Custom printer profile created in Config Wizard could be saved
    under a name clashing with a system profile name.
  * "Rename preset" button was inadvertently not shown in the UI
    when physical printer profile was selected.
  * Number of toolchanges did not show in the "Sliced info" box
    when wipe tower was disabled (#6832).

- Update to 2.7.4
  * Objects from 3MFs generated by BambuStudio now retain
    multimaterial painting when loaded. BambuStudio saves the data
    under a changed name, but because both the location and meaning
    are the same, PrusaSlicer now tries to load the data under the
    new name when it fails to find the attribute that PrusaSlicer
    has always used. #12502
  * Fix: Downloading files from Printables did not work correctly
    (#12521).
- Fixes in 2.7.3
  ## Bug fixes with respect to 2.7.3-beta1
  * Removed negligible deretractions sometimes emitted into the
    G-code after the recently introduced spiral vase mode
    improvements. While they did not present actual issues with the
    print, they were confusingly shown in the G-code preview.
  ## Bug fixes with respect to 2.7.3-alpha1
  * The z offset configuration option was not correctly accounted
    for when doing the last filament unload above the wipe tower.
  * Fixed crash when importing a specific config bundle while in
    SLA mode.
  * Linux specific: When changing active profile using the dropdown
    in the right panel, the dropdown would stay open when Unsaved
    Changes dialog was shown.
  * The improvements of spiral vase mode handling introduced in the
    previous alpha did not work correctly with absolute extruder
    addressing (#2841 (comment)). They are now only applied with
    relative extruder addressing, otherwise it falls back to the
    old behaviour.
  * After performing a toolchange on the wipe tower, a G-code to
    set layer z is now always emitted. This is to make sure that
    the layer z is correct and that it was not changed in custom
    toolchange G-code. While the user is expected to pass such
    information in the custom G-code, the "z-ensuring" G-code was
    present in previous versions and removing it in 2.7.2 was
    therefore a needless breaking change (#12361).
  * Fixed blobs on the first layer when using ramping travels with
    absolute extruder addressing enabled.
  * Fixed issues with 'avoid crossing perimeters' function
    (#12432). This problem was actually fixed in 2.7.3-alpha1
    already.
  ## Major improvements first seen in 2.7.3-alpha1
  * See
    https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.7.3-alpha1
    for the full description
  * Improvements of multi-material printing
  * Purging volumes
  * Spiral vase mode improvements
  ## Other improvements with respect to 2.7.2
  * PrusaSlicer is now able to open 3MF files generated by
    BambuStudio and load geometry from them. (#10718, PR #10808,
    thanks to @cmguo). Please note that BambuStudio allows to save
    a 3MF containing G-code only, which is not supported by
    PrusaSlicer and loading of such 3MFs will fail.
  * Metadata of binary G-code have a new item named objects_info,
    which lists all the objects in the print and their boundary
    polygons. The same info was added into the comments at the end
    of ASCII G-codes.
  ## Bugfixes with respect to 2.7.2
  * Pressure equalizer limits were not respected when Dynamic speed
    on overhangs was used (#9485). This is now fixed. Pressure
    equalizer is also not applied after long travels. Many thanks
    to @MGunlogson for providing a fix in his pull request #9622.
  * Fixed a bug resulting in inadequate anchoring of bridging
    extrusions. This bug was introduced in PrusaSlicer 2.6.0.
    #10231, #11500, #11633, #11173, #11117, #9999, #10313, #11150,
    #10493
  * When using Cancel object feature, the marks denoting where one
    object ends and another starts were placed incorrectly. As a
    result, there was a missing deretraction after all travels to
    objects which would normally be printed following the cancelled
    object. The issue was even worse with sequential printing,
    where the uncompensated retractions on the cancelled object
    summed up and could result in filament being unloaded past the
    driving gears.
  * When arcs (G2 and G3 G-codes) were enabled, PrusaSlicer
    generated toolpaths outside the print area in certain cases
    (#12381).
- Increase memory and disk space for building constraints

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 13 19:02:19 UTC 2024 - Frank Kunz <mailinglists@kunz-im-inter.net>

- Update to 2.7.2
  ## Improvements with respect to 2.7.1
  * Multi-material segmentation improvements
  * Color change (M600) improvements
  * Ramping travel improvements
  * SLA overrides
  * Windows specific: The cut tool sometimes produces non-manifold
    meshes. This situation is now detected and the user is advised
    to use Windows repair algorithm on the resulting objects.
  ## Bugs fixes with respect to 2.7.1
  * Fixed incorrect partial arrange in certain cases.
  * Fixing arrange issues with aligning to unprintable objects when
    doing Shift+A.
  * Fixed arrange which sometimes put the wipe tower slightly out of
    bed
  * Fixed UI glitch when setting object dimensions to extremely high
    values.
  * Fixed a bug in generation of brim and skirt preview in the
    preliminary G-code preview (#11821, thanks to @supermerill)
  * Fixed an issue Ctrl+Shift+Tab shortcut, which incorrectly
    collapsed sidebar.
  * Fixed wiggling of Rotate gizmo when moving an object in certain
    cases.
  * Fixed missing updated when moving through dropdown items using
    keyboard arrows.
  * Improve filtering of special characters on Klipper
    EXCLUDE_OBJECT labels (#11802, PR#11813 by @jschuh - thank
    you).
  * Fixed layer change color dialog opening off screen.
  * Fixed occasional crash during thumbnail generation for SLA
    printers.
  * Fixed slicing issues such as missing infills and similar on
    multi part models when sliced with object-specific settings.
  * In SLA mode, it was not possible to use custom file extension
    (configured in Output Settings).
  * Fixed incorrect calculation of wipe length in certain cases,
    leading to shorter wipes than configured.
  * Fixed various issues and UI glitches in text/SVG embossing.
  * Fixed missing update when a new printer was added while a
    physical printer preset was selected.
  * Scrolling of the window was incorrectly performed when using
    mouse wheel over a dropdown.
  * Windows specific: Drop down menus appeared outside of
    PrusaSlicer and could not be opened again.
  * When loading an object from a 3MF, the suggestion to rescale
    the model is not shown, because 3MFs store the information
    about the correct unit (unlike STL files).
  * Fixed an incorrect check of supported OpenGL version, which led
    to a hard crash when OpenGL 3.2 was not available.
  * When loading a 3MF for MM printer, PrusaSlicer offers to load
    individual models as parts of a single object. This dialog did
    not show up for specific geometries.
  * PrusaSlicer did not start on some Windows Server installations
    due to a missing DLL (wlanapi.dll). The library is now loaded
    in runtime and the respective features.
  * Travels with standard lifts (non-ramping) were incorrectly
    generated.
  * With option "Retract on layer change" disabled, there was a
    retraction missing before the first travel on each layer.
  * Variable layer height limits were not applied correctly when
    using multi-extruder printer with different values of min and
    max layer height.
  * When z travel speed was set to zero, it was incorrectly
    exported into the G-code, effectively stopping the print.
    Instead, regular travel speed should have been used for the z
    travel.
  * When Print / Filament / Printer profiles contained different
    values for the same key (which should normally not happen,
    providing the profiles are correct), the misplaced keys could
    have been used instead of the correct ones.
  * Fixed incorrectly applied retraction in vase mode when ramping
    travels were enabled.
  * When using the "No sparse layers" wipe tower, the print head
    sometimes lowered before travelling to the wipe tower, digging
    into an object and destroying the print.
  * Fixed a crash when loading certain AMF files.
  * When specific extruder was set for the wipe tower and z
    position has changed in custom toolchange G-code, the z
    position was not correctly accounted for.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 25 13:59:05 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.7.1
  ## Improvements fixed with respect to 2.7.0
  * The option Export as binary G-code was removed from Print
    Settings. Instead, there is a new option in Printer Settings
    named Supports binary G-code so it can be set at printer level.
    There is also a new global switch in Preferences->Other, which
    controls whether binary G-code will be generated for printers
    which support it. It is therefore easy to turn the feature on
    or off without doing any changes in profiles (#11734, #11873).
  * Wipe tower weight was added into G-code metadata so it can be
    easily displayed in the print statistics on the printer's
    display.
  ## Bugs fixed with respect to 2.7.0
  * When ramping travels were enabled, sometimes a perimeter was
    missing at the layer where the spiral starts.
  * Fixed a crash when selecting embossed text while an SVG tool is
    opened (#11759).
  * Helical layer changes could result in out of bed moves
    (#11754).
  * Helical layer change was enabled even when there was no
    retraction on layer change (#11709, #11761).
- Release 2.7.0
  * This is the stable release of PrusaSlicer 2.7.0, introducing
    SVG emboss, binary G-codes, ramping travels, support for G2/G3
    G-codes, support for Cancel object function and much more. It
    also fixes many bugs.
  * Important note for Original Prusa MINI, MK4 and XL owners: The
    new configuration update of our system profiles will enable
    binary G-code and G2/G3 features. Users using older firmware
    need to update to 5.1.0-alpha2 or later or manually turn these
    features off. On older firmware, new binary G-code is not
    visible or recognized and the G2/G3 G-codes may not work
    perfectly.
  * Travel moves improvements
  * SVG embossing tool (#6916, #9373)
  * G2 and G3 G-code support #4352
  * Binary G-code
  * Improved user interface
  * Custom G-code editor
  * Cancel object (Marlin, RRF and Klipper)

Mon Sep  5 17:17:49 UTC 2022 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Quoting Lucas Matena (see gh#prusa3d/PrusaSlicer#8299, issue 2): 
  if you link PrusaSlicer 2.5.x with wxWidgets 3.2, you will most
  likely break it: link against wxWidgets 3.0.5

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  1 15:42:40 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 2.4.2
  * SLA mode incorrectly handled 3MFs from 3rd party software,
    resulting in misplaced SLA support points and holes in some
    cases (#6100, #7359, #7189, #7826, #7659). This is very old
    issue.
  * Vase mode preview did not show in cases when Custom Start
    G-Code lacked moves in Z #8032
  * When loading a 3rd party 3MF using drag and drop. PrusaSlicer
    no longer asks if the 3MF shall be loaded as a project (which
    makes no sense since it contains no config) and loads the
    geometry only
  * Using the Layer Height Modifier with the wipe tower was
    impossible with multiple objects. The wipe tower reported that
    the layer height profile is different, even though it was in
    fact set the same on all objects (#7711, #7903, #8044)
  * Fixed a crash on "Convert from/to units" when several objects
    were selected
  * Automatic color change for logo crashed PrusaSlicer in certain
    cases (when a one-layer object was present) #8156
  * Linux specific: Fixed a crash on opening projects in some cases
    (#8078, #8097)
  * Added Snapmaker bundle (Snapmaker A250, Snapmaker A350). Based
    on https://github.com/nivekmai/snapmaker-prusa by @nivekmai,
    @WilliamBosacker, @mrworf
  * Added profiles for Zonestar printers (Z5, Z6, Z5X, Z8, Z9),
    based on slic3r/slic3r-profiles#19 by @ZONESTAR3D
  * Fixed a crash when Unsaved Changes dialog attempted to show a
    modified config option which is not available in current mode
    (e.g. Start G-Code in Simple mode). #7905
  * Fixed a bug that when the user was closing the application and
    replied 'Yes' in the dialog asking about unsaved project while
    also checking 'Remember my choice', it made it impossible to
    close PrusaSlicer in the next runs when there were no objects
    in the plater #8076, #8122
  * Loading of a G-Code in G-Code Viewer or loading config from
    G-Code file sometimes failed because of a bug in parsing of the
    configuration block at the end.
  * Fixed incorrect rendering of some characters used in the
    recently updated Simplified Chinese translation #8171
  * Fixed incorrect number of toolchanges reported in "Sliced Info"
    box when wipe tower was used. The annotations of toolchanges in
    G-Code were also numbered wrong #8186
  * Fixed a crash when using the "Import SL1 Archive" function and
    either cancelling the dialog or confirming a non-existing file
    #8175
  * Recycling symbols in Shape Gallery were mirrored so the user
    does not have to flip them when using them as negative volumes
    at the base of the print (which is the usual use case). Also,
    PLA recycling symbol was added #7800

- Switch to bundled GLEW -- gh#prusa3d/PrusaSlicer#6396

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 20 10:50:45 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v2.3.1
  New 3rd party printer profiles
  * Multiple Creality printers profiles were added (Ender-3 Max,
    Ender-4, Ender-6, CR-5 Pro, CR-5 Pro H, CR-6 SE, CR-6 Max,
    CR-10 Max, CR-200B, CR-8), thanks @pmjdebruijn.

    potential security issues in loading invalid and potentially
    malicious AMF and 3MF files, see their vulnerability reports
    TALOS-2020-1222 and TALOS-2020-1218. We fixed these two
    potential security issues with this release of PrusaSlicer.
  Bugs fixed with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.3.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 20 20:12:40 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Remove extra PrusaSlicer.desktop. Use upstream's desktop files. 
  Graphics;3DGraphics seems to be the consensus now.

  gh#prusa3d/PrusaSlicer#4691

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 20 15:50:07 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- revert the memoryperjob change. The build process really acquires
  that much memory per job and the workers cannot provide 3GB per
  CPU core. Sadly, we are limited by memory not by CPU cores.
- require 11 GB of RAM. This allows us to run 3 jobs in parallel and
  can be provided by all architectures

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 20 09:03:33 UTC 2020 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Use memoryperjob constraint instead of %limit_build macro.
- Use only 1GB for memoryperjob.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 10 08:12:10 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Use wxGTK3 instead of wxWidgets (GTK2), for better HiDPI and
  Wayland support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 16 12:09:13 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- This is mainly a cosmetic update so that the package gets rebuilt
  in Factory. Rebuild is needed because of wxWidgets - boo#1172750
- Add openvdb-tools package for better cmake reporting.
- Make the 32-bit floating point workaround more readable.
  gh#prusa3d/PrusaSlicer#3781

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 24 07:24:26 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- BuildRequire pkgconfig(libudev) instead of libudev-devel: allow
  OBS to shortcut through -mini flavors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 21 22:08:07 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- update to version 2.2.0

  printer vendors, 3Dconnexion support, automatic variable layer height, 
  macOS dark mode support, greatly improved ColorPrint feature and much, 
  much more.
  See https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.2.0
  and the changelogs for the release candidates, betas and alphas since
  2.1.1 for a complete list of changes.
- reactivate parallel builds, but need strong enough workers and reserve 
  4G of memory per thread (memory-constraints, %limit_build)
- new build dependencies: cgal, ilmbase, more of boost, libudev, openvdb


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 11 10:24:01 UTC 2019 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- update to version 2.1.1
