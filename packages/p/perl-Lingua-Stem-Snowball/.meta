  <title>Perl interface to Snowball stemmers</title>
  <description>Stemming reduces related words to a common root form -- for instance,
&quot;horse&quot;, &quot;horses&quot;, and &quot;horsing&quot; all become &quot;hors&quot;. Most commonly, stemming
is deployed as part of a search application, allowing searches for a given
term to match documents which contain other forms of that term.</description>
