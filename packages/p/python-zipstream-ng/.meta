  <title>A modern and easy to use streamable zip file generator</title>
  <description>A modern and easy to use streamable zip file generator. It can package and stream many files and folders into a zip on the fly without needing temporary files or excessive memory. It can also calculate the final size of the zip file before streaming it.
Features:

 * Generates zip data on the fly as it's requested.
 * Can calculate the total size of the resulting zip file before generation even begins.
 * Low memory usage: Since the zip is generated as it's requested, very little has to be kept in memory (peak usage of less than 20MB is typical, even for TBs of files).
 * Flexible API: Typical use cases are simple, complicated ones are possible.
 * Supports zipping data from files, bytes, strings, and any other iterable objects.
 * Keeps track of the date of the most recently modified file added to the zip file.
 * Threadsafe: Won't mangle data if multiple threads concurrently add data to the same stream.
 * Includes a clone of Python's http.server module with zip support added. Try python -m zipstream.server.
 * Automatically uses Zip64 extensions, but only if they are required.
 * No external dependencies.</description>
