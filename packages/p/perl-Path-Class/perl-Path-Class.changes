- updated to 0.33
  - New copy_to() and move_to() methods. [Robert Rothenberg & Ken Williams]
 
  - As advised in the utime() docs, pass undef as the time for touch().
 
  - Do a better job cleaning up temp files in the tests.
 
  - Optimization: use parent.pm instead of base.pm. [Olivier Mengué]
 
  - Changed the docs to show that file() and dir() are exported by
    default.
 
  - Fixed spelling error in POD. [Salvatore Bonaccorso]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  9 14:52:47 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.32
  - Updated dependency on File::Spec to 3.26, fixing RT #83143.
 
  - Fixed bug with leading empty string in dir() - became unintentional
    UNC path on Cygwin. [David Golden and MITHUN@cpan.org]
 
  - Fixed "Unterminated C<...> sequence" in Pod. [Olaf Alders]
 
 0.31  Tue Feb  5 11:51:59 CST 2013
 
  - Optimization: stringify variables passed to canonpath [David Golden]
 
  - Optimization: Use internal guts when constructing Dirs from
    Dirs, instead of concatenating and splitting them again with
    File::Spec. [David Golden]
 
  - Fix grammar error in docs. [Karen Etheridge]
 
  - Implement a 'split' parameter for the slurp() method [suggested by Yanick Champoux]
 
  - In docs, replace unicode MINUS SIGN with ascii HYPHEN-MINUS [Randy Stauner]
 
 0.29  Mon Dec 17 23:55:07 CST 2012
 
  - Add components() method, which returns directory names (and
    filename, if this is a File object) as a list.
 
  - Fix a test failure on non-Unix platforms, the 07-recurseprune.t
    test was written in a Unix-specific way.
 
 0.28  Sat Dec 15 21:40:17 CST 2012
 
  - Fix test failures when run as root - they were relying on
    permissions failures, but permissions never fail as root. [Spotted
    by AAR and Chris Williams]
 
  - Add links in docs to the other modules we rely on & talk about in
    the docs.  Makes for easier viewing through search.cpan.org /
    MetaCPAN. [David Precious]
 
  - Fixed some misleading variable names in docs. [RT#81795] [Pau Amma]
 
 0.27  Sat Dec  8 19:24:15 CST 2012
 
  - Added pruning support in dir->recurse(). If recurse callback
    returns $item->PRUNE, no children of this item will be
    analyzed. [Marcin Kasperski]
 
  - Documented 'basename' method for directories. [Fabrice Gabolde]
 
  - Added traverse_if() function, which allows one to filter children

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 29 15:28:20 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- it should work with all Module::Build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 27 09:04:53 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.25
 - resolve() now croak()s instead of die()s on non-existent file. [Danijel Tašov]
 - Added a traverse() method for directories, based on the fmap_cont()
   method of Forest::Tree::Pure.  It's an alternative to ->recurse,
   which allows for more control over how the recursion
   happens. [Jesse Luehrs]
 - Fixed a grammar error in the docs. [Shlomi Fish]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 30 15:21:07 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- updated to 0.24
 - Added a tempfile() method for Dir objects, which provides an
   interface to File::Temp. [RT#60485]

 - Fixed a non-helpful fatal error message when calling resolve() on a
   path that doesn't exist.  Now dies with the proper "No such file or
   directory" message & exit status. [GRAF]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  2 19:30:15 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- update to 0.23:
 - Fixed a bunch of problems with the distribution (e.g. in META.yml)
   that I introduced in the switch to Dist::Zilla.  No code changes
   from 0.22.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 26 14:25:07 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.22:
  * added a basename() method for directory objects

- changes from 0.21:
  * don't test the 'iomode' option under 5.6, because layers aren't supported yet
  * fixes to spelling errors in the docmuentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 30 19:20:37 UTC 2010 - coolo@novell.com

- switch to perl_requires macro

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  9 09:34:47 UTC 2010 - chris@computersalat.de

- update to 0.19
  - slurp() now accepts an 'iolayers' option to control how the file is
    opened. [Graham Barr]
  - In the openr() and openw() file methods, we now croak() instead of
    die() so that the error messages are more useful. [Ian Sillitoe]
  - Allow subclassing, by adding dir_class() and file_class() static
    methods, allowing them to be overridden. [Matt Trout & John LoVerso
    & Michael Schwern]
  - Fixed a testing failure that could occur whenever testing in a
    directory path that contains symlinks (e.g. /tmp on Mac OS X).
  - Added a 'no_hidden' parameter for children() [EDENC <EDENC@cpan.org>]
  - Fixed the heading for the is_relative() POD section. [CUB <cub.uanic@gmail.com>]
- 0.18 - Sun Dec 20 10:11:02 CST 2009
  - Similar to the next() bug for files/directories named "0" or "0.0"
    in the previous release, the children() and recurse() methods have
    now been fixed in the same way. [spotted by ARTHAS, MSISK]
- 0.17 - Sun Jun 14 21:42:16 2009
  - dir(undef) now returns undef rather than the rootdir, because undef
    was probably a mistake by the caller, and the rootdir is too scary
    a default. [Suggested by John Goulah]
  - Temporary files during testing are now created in the system temp
    directory, rather than somewhere in t/ .  See RT #31382. [Suggested
    by Alex Page]
  - Added is_relative() as the obvious complement to the existing
    is_absolute() method.
  - Added a resolve() method to clean up paths much more thoroughly
    than cleanup(), e.g. resolving symlinks, collapsing foo/../bar
    sections, etc. [Suggested by David Garamond]
  - Fixed a problem in which a file/directory called "0" or "0.0" would
    end a loop prematurely when using the idiom 'while($x =
    $dir->next) {...}'.  See http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29374
    [Spotted by Daniel Lo]
  - Fixed an exists($array[$i]) that prevented compatibility with perl
    5.005.
  - Moved the repository from my personal CVS repo to Google Code.
- recreated by cpanspec 1.78
- noarch pkg
