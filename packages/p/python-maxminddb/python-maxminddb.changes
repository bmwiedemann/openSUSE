  - Minor performance improvements in the pure Python reader.

- update to version 1.5.1:
  - Fix a possible segfault due to not correctly incrementing the reference
    on a returned object.
- update to version 1.5.0:
  - Python 3.3 and 3.4 are no longer supported.
  - The extension source directory was moved to prevent an ``ImportWarning``
    when importing the module on Python 2 with ``-Wdefault`` set. Reported by
    David Szotten and Craig de Stigter. GitHub #31.
  - The ``get`` method now accepts ``ipaddress.IPv4Address`` and
    ``ipaddress.IPv6Address`` objects in addition to strings.  This works with
    both the pure Python implementation as well as the extension. Based on a
    pull request #48 by Eric Pruitt. GitHub #50.
  - A new method, ``get_with_prefix_len``, was added. This method returns a
    tuple containing the record and the prefix length.

- Update to 1.4.1:
  * Fixes for python 3.7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 27 08:30:23 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 1.4.0:
 * IMPORTANT: Previously, the pure Python reader would allow
   `ipaddress.IPv4Address` and `ipaddress.IPv6Address` objects when calling
   `.get()`. This would fail with the C extension. The fact that these objects
   worked at all was an implementation detail and has varied with different
   releases. This release makes the pure Python implementation consistent
   with the extension. A `TypeError` will now be thrown if you attempt to
   use these types with either the pure Python implementation or the
   extension. The IP address passed to `.get()` should be a string type.
 * Fix issue where incorrect size was used when unpacking some types with the
   pure Python reader. Reported by Lee Symes. GitHub #30.
 * You may now pass in the database via a file descriptor rather than a file
   name when creating a new ``maxminddb.Reader`` object using ``MODE_FD``.
   This will read the database from the file descriptor into memory. Pull
   request by nkinkade. GitHub #33.
