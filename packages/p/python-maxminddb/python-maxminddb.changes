- update to version 2.6.3:
 - The vendored ``libmaxminddb`` has been updated to 1.12.0. This fixes a
   memory leak when opening a database fails.
 - Binary wheels are now built for Python 3.13.
- update to version 2.6.2:
 - The vendored ``libmaxminddb`` has been updated to 1.10.0. This fixes a
   bug that would cause incorrect results on databases that had search
   trees greater than 4 GB.
- update to version 2.6.1:
 - This release includes no source code changes. The only changes are to
   the release workflow.
 - Binary wheels are now built on Linux for aarch64. Pull request by Kevin
   Park. GitHub #160.
 - Binary wheels are now built on macOS for Apple silicon. Requested by
   Kevin Park. GitHub #152.
- update to version 2.6.0:
 - Added type annotations for instance variables on ``Metadata``
 - Updated type stubs for ``maxminddb.extension``.
 - ``setuptools`` is no longer listed as a runtime dependency. Pull request
   by Lewis Collard. GitHub #155.
- update to version 2.5.2:
 - The vendored ``libmaxminddb`` version was updated to 1.9.0. This fixes
   an issue when reading databases with a search tree exceeding 2 GB.
   Reported by Sami Salonen. GitHub #146.
- update to version 2.5.1:
 - This is a re-release of 2.5.0 to address missing files from the sdist.
   Reported by Lumír 'Frenzy' Balhar. GitHub #132.
- update to version 2.5.0:
 - IMPORTANT: Python 3.8 or greater is required. If you are using an older
   version, please use an earlier release.
 - Windows is now supported by the C extension.
 - The ``Reader`` class now implements the ``__iter__`` method. This will
   return an iterator that iterates over all records in the database,
   excluding repeated aliased of the IPv4 network. Requested by
   Jean-Baptiste Braun and others. GitHub #23.
 - The multiprocessing test now explicitly uses ``fork``. This allows it
   to run successfully on macOS. Pull request by Theodore Ni. GitHub #116.
 - A vendored copy of ``libmaxminddb`` will now be used by default when
   building the extension. If you wish to continue using the system shared
   library, you may set the ``MAXMINDDB_USE_SYSTEM_LIBMAXMINDDB`` environment
   variable to a true value when building the extension. 
 - The C extension now builds on Python 3.13.
 - The C extension will now be built for PyPy.

- update to version 2.2.0:
 - The return type for ``maxminddb.open_database()`` has been simplified
   to be just the ``Reader`` class as opposed to a union of that with
   the extension class. This is done by casting the extension to
   ``Reader``. The extension class has the same public API as the
   pure Python implementation. This simplifies type checking for users of
   this library. The ``Reader`` class is exposed as ``maxminddb.Reader``.
   Pull request by wouter bolsterlee. GitHub #88.
 - ``maxminddb.__all__`` is now set to define a public API. Pull request
   by wouter bolsterlee. GitHub #88.
 - Fix minor regression in ``repr`` output of ``maxminddb.reader.Metadata``
   in 2.1.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 18 20:19:51 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.1.0:
 - The C extension now correctly supports objects that implement the
   ``os.PathLike`` interface.
 - When opening a database fails due to an access issue, the correct
   ``OSError`` subclass will now be thrown.
 - The ``Metadata`` class object is now available from the C extension
   module as ``maxminddb.extension.Metadata`` rather than
   ``maxminddb.extension.extension``.
 - Type stubs have been added for ``maxminddb.extension``.

Sun Nov  1 18:30:49 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

  - The 2.0.0 release unintentionally required Python to be compiled with
    ``mmap`` support for the module to work. ``mmap`` is now optional
    again. Reported by john-heasman-cg. GitHub #76.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  1 11:06:52 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 1.5.2:
  - Minor performance improvements in the pure Python reader.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  6 18:06:53 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 1.5.1:
  - Fix a possible segfault due to not correctly incrementing the reference
    on a returned object.
- update to version 1.5.0:
  - Python 3.3 and 3.4 are no longer supported.
  - The extension source directory was moved to prevent an ``ImportWarning``
    when importing the module on Python 2 with ``-Wdefault`` set. Reported by
    David Szotten and Craig de Stigter. GitHub #31.
  - The ``get`` method now accepts ``ipaddress.IPv4Address`` and
    ``ipaddress.IPv6Address`` objects in addition to strings.  This works with
    both the pure Python implementation as well as the extension. Based on a
    pull request #48 by Eric Pruitt. GitHub #50.
  - A new method, ``get_with_prefix_len``, was added. This method returns a
    tuple containing the record and the prefix length.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 29 12:31:26 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Update to 1.4.1:
  * Fixes for python 3.7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 27 08:30:23 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 1.4.0:
 * IMPORTANT: Previously, the pure Python reader would allow
   `ipaddress.IPv4Address` and `ipaddress.IPv6Address` objects when calling
   `.get()`. This would fail with the C extension. The fact that these objects
   worked at all was an implementation detail and has varied with different
   releases. This release makes the pure Python implementation consistent
   with the extension. A `TypeError` will now be thrown if you attempt to
   use these types with either the pure Python implementation or the
   extension. The IP address passed to `.get()` should be a string type.
 * Fix issue where incorrect size was used when unpacking some types with the
   pure Python reader. Reported by Lee Symes. GitHub #30.
 * You may now pass in the database via a file descriptor rather than a file
   name when creating a new ``maxminddb.Reader`` object using ``MODE_FD``.
   This will read the database from the file descriptor into memory. Pull
   request by nkinkade. GitHub #33.
