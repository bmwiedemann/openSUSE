  <title>Optimized module loading for forking or non-forking processes</title>
  <description>The &quot;prefork&quot; pragma is intended to allow module writers to optimise
module loading for both scenarios with as little additional code as
possible.

prefork.pm is intended to serve as a central and optional marshalling
point for state detection (are we running in compile-time or run-time
mode) and to act as a relatively light-weight module loader.
