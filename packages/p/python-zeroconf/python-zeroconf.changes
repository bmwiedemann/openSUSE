Mon Sep  6 09:19:13 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.36.2:
  * Include NSEC records for non-existent types when responding
    with addresses
  * Implements RFC6762 sec 6.2
    (http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-6.2)

- Update to 0.36.1:
  * Skip goodbye packets for addresses when there is another
    service registered with the same name (#968) @bdraco
  * If a ServiceInfo that used the same server name as another
    ServiceInfo was unregistered, goodbye packets would be sent for
    the addresses and would cause the other service to be seen as
    offline.
  * Fixed equality and hash for dns records with the unique bit
    (#969)
  * These records should have the same hash and equality since
    the unique bit (cache flush bit) is not considered when adding
    or removing the records from the cache.

- Update to 0.36.0:
  * Technically backwards incompatible:
  * Fill incomplete IPv6 tuples to avoid WinError on windows (#965)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 16 01:39:16 UTC 2021 - Fusion Future <qydwhotmail@gmail.com>

- Update to 0.35.1:
  * Only reschedule types if the send next time changes (#958)
    @bdraco
  * When the PTR response was seen again, the timer was being
    canceled and rescheduled even if the timer was for the same
    time. While this did not cause any breakage, it is quite
    inefficient.
  * Cache DNS record and question hashes (#960) @bdraco
  * The hash was being recalculated every time the object was
    being used in a set or dict. Since the hashes are effectively
    immutable, we only calculate them once now.
- Changes from 0.35.0:
  * Reduced chance of accidental synchronization of ServiceInfo
    requests (#955) @bdraco
  * Sort aggregated responses to increase chance of name compression
    (#954) @bdraco
  Technically backwards incompatible:
    * Send unicast replies on the same socket the query was received
      (#952) @bdraco
    * When replying to a QU question, we do not know if the sending
      host is reachable from all of the sending sockets. We now
      avoid this problem by replying via the receiving socket. This
      was the existing behavior when InterfaceChoice.Default is set.
    * This change extends the unicast relay behavior to used with
      InterfaceChoice.Default to apply when InterfaceChoice.All
      or interfaces are explicitly passed when instantiating a
      Zeroconf instance.
    * Fixes #951
- Changes from 0.34.3:
  * Fix sending immediate multicast responses (#949) @bdraco
- Changes from 0.34.2:
  * Coalesce aggregated multicast answers (#945) @bdraco
  * When the random delay is shorter than the last scheduled
    response, answers are now added to the same outgoing time group.
  * This reduces traffic when we already know we will be sending
    a group of answers inside the random delay window described
    in datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-6.3
  * Ensure ServiceInfo requests can be answered inside the default
    timeout with network protection (#946) @bdraco
  * Adjust the time windows to ensure responses that have triggered
    the protection against against excessive packet flooding due to
    software bugs or malicious attack described in RFC6762 section
    6 can respond in under 1350ms to ensure ServiceInfo can ask
    two questions within the default timeout of 3000ms
- Changes from 0.34.1:
  * Ensure multicast aggregation sends responses within 620ms
    (#942) @bdraco
  * Responses that trigger the protection against against
    excessive packet flooding due to software bugs or malicious
    attack described in RFC6762 section 6 could cause the multicast
    aggregation response to be delayed longer than 620ms (The maximum
    random delay of 120ms and 500ms additional for aggregation).
  * Only responses that trigger the protection are delayed longer
    than 620ms
- Changes from 0.34.0:
  * Implemented Multicast Response Aggregation (#940) @bdraco
  * Responses are now aggregated when possible per rules in RFC6762
    section 6.4
  * Responses that trigger the protection against against
    excessive packet flooding due to software bugs or malicious
    attack described in RFC6762 section 6 are delayed instead of
    discarding as it was causing responders that implement Passive
    Observation Of Failures (POOF) to evict the records.
  * Probe responses are now always sent immediately as there were
    cases where they would fail to be answered in time to defend
    a name.
- Changes from 0.33.4:
  * Ensure zeroconf can be loaded when the system disables IPv6
    (#933) @che0
- Changes from 0.33.3:
  * Added support for forward dns compression pointers (#934) @bdraco
  * Provide sockname when logging a protocol error (#935) @bdraco
- Changes from 0.33.2:
  * Handle duplicate goodbye answers in the same packet (#928)
    @bdraco
  * Solves an exception being thrown when we tried to remove the
    known answer from the cache when the second goodbye answer in
    the same packet was processed
  * Fixed #926
  * Skip ipv6 interfaces that return ENODEV (#930) @bdraco
- Changes from 0.33.1:
  * Version number change only with less restrictive directory
    permissions
  * Fixed #923
- Changes from 0.33.0:
  This release eliminates all threading locks as all non-threadsafe
  operations now happen in the event loop.
  * Let connection_lost close the underlying socket (#918) @bdraco
  * The socket was closed during shutdown before asyncio's
    connection_lost handler had a chance to close it which resulted
    in a traceback on windows.
  * Fixed #917
  Technically backwards incompatible:
    * Removed duplicate unregister_all_services code (#910) @bdraco
    * Calling Zeroconf.close from same asyncio event loop zeroconf
      is running in will now skip unregister_all_services and log
      a warning as this a blocking operation and is not async safe
      and never has been.
    * Use AsyncZeroconf instead, or for legacy code call
      async_unregister_all_services before Zeroconf.close
- Changes from 0.32.1:
  * Increased timeout in ServiceInfo.request to handle loaded systems
    (#895) @bdraco
  * It can take a few seconds for a loaded system to run the
    async_request coroutine when the event loop is busy, or the
    system is CPU bound (example being Home Assistant startup). We
    now add an additional _LOADED_SYSTEM_TIMEOUT (10s) to the
    run_coroutine_threadsafe calls to ensure the coroutine has
    the total amount of time to run up to its internal timeout
    (default of 3000ms).
  * Ten seconds is a bit large of a timeout; however, it is only
    used in cases where we wrap other timeouts. We now expect the
    only instance the run_coroutine_threadsafe result timeout will
    happen in a production circumstance is when someone is running
    a ServiceInfo.request() in a thread and another thread calls
    Zeroconf.close() at just the right moment that the future
    is never completed unless the system is so loaded that it is
    nearly unresponsive.
  * The timeout for run_coroutine_threadsafe is the maximum time
    a thread can cleanly shut down when zeroconf is closed out in
    another thread, which should always be longer than the underlying
    thread operation.
- Changes from 0.32.0:
  This release offers 100% line and branch coverage.
  * Made ServiceInfo first question QU (#852) @bdraco
  * We want an immediate response when requesting with ServiceInfo
    by asking a QU question; most responders will not delay the
    response and respond right away to our question. This also
    improves compatibility with split networks as we may not have
    been able to see the response otherwise. If the responder has
    not multicast the record recently, it may still choose to do
    so in addition to responding via unicast
  * Reduces traffic when there are multiple zeroconf instances
    running on the network running ServiceBrowsers
  * If we don't get an answer on the first try, we ask a QM question
    in the event, we can't receive a unicast response for some reason
  * This change puts ServiceInfo inline with ServiceBrowser which
    also asks the first question as QU since ServiceInfo is commonly
    called from ServiceBrowser callbacks
  * Limited duplicate packet suppression to 1s intervals (#841)
    @bdraco
  * Only suppress duplicate packets that happen within the same
    second. Legitimate queriers will retry the question if they
    are suppressed. The limit was reduced to one second to be in
    line with rfc6762
  * Made multipacket known answer suppression per interface (#836)
    @bdraco
  * The suppression was happening per instance of Zeroconf instead
    of per interface. Since the same network can be seen on multiple
    interfaces (usually and wifi and ethernet), this would confuse
    the multi-packet known answer supression since it was not
    expecting to get the same data more than once
  * New ServiceBrowsers now request QU in the first outgoing when
    unspecified (#812) @bdraco
  * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-5.4 When
    we start a ServiceBrowser and zeroconf has just started up,
    the known answer list will be small. By asking a QU question
    first, it is likely that we have a large known answer list
    by the time we ask the QM question a second later (current
    default which is likely too low but would be a breaking change
    to increase). This reduces the amount of traffic on the network,
    and has the secondary advantage that most responders will answer
    a QU question without the typical delay answering QM questions.
  * IPv6 link-local addresses are now qualified with scope_id
    (#343) @ibygrave
  * When a service is advertised on an IPv6 address where the scope
    is link local, i.e. fe80::/64 (see RFC 4007) the resolved IPv6
    address must be extended with the scope_id that identifies
    through the "%" symbol the local interface to be used when
    routing to that address. A new API parsed_scoped_addresses()
    is provided to return qualified addresses to avoid breaking
    compatibility on the existing parsed_addresses().
  * Network adapters that are disconnected are now skipped (#327)
    @ZLJasonG
  * Fixed listeners missing initial packets if Engine starts too
    quickly (#387) @bdraco
  * When manually creating a zeroconf.Engine object, it is no longer
    started automatically. It must manually be started by calling
    .start() on the created object.
  * The Engine thread is now started after all the listeners have
    been added to avoid a race condition where packets could be
    missed at startup.
  * Fixed answering matching PTR queries with the ANY query (#618)
    @bdraco
  * Fixed lookup of uppercase names in the registry (#597) @bdraco
  * If the ServiceInfo was registered with an uppercase name and
    the query was for a lowercase name, it would not be found
    and vice-versa.
  * Fixed unicast responses from any source port (#598) @bdraco
  * Unicast responses were only being sent if the source port was
    53, this prevented responses when testing with dig:
        dig -p 5353 @224.0.0.251 media-12.local
    The above query will now see a response
  * Fixed queries for AAAA records not being answered (#616) @bdraco
  * Removed second level caching from ServiceBrowsers (#737) @bdraco
  * The ServiceBrowser had its own cache of the last time it saw
    a service that was reimplementing the DNSCache and presenting
    a source of truth problem that lead to unexpected queries when
    the two disagreed.
  * Fixed server cache not being case-insensitive (#731) @bdraco
  * If the server name had uppercase chars and any of the matching
    records were lowercase, and the server would not be found
  * Fixed cache handling of records with different TTLs (#729)
    @bdraco
  * There should only be one unique record in the cache at a time as
    having multiple unique records will different TTLs in the cache
    can result in unexpected behavior since some functions returned
    all matching records and some fetched from the right side of
    the list to return the newest record. Instead we now store
    the records in a dict to ensure that the newest record always
    replaces the same unique record, and we never have a source of
    truth problem determining the TTL of a record from the cache.
  * Fixed ServiceInfo with multiple A records (#725) @bdraco
  * If there were multiple A records for the host, ServiceInfo would
    always return the last one that was in the incoming packet,
    which was usually not the one that was wanted.
  * Fixed stale unique records expiring too quickly (#706) @bdraco
  * Records now expire 1s in the future instead of instant removal.
    tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762#section-10.2 Queriers receiving a
    Multicast DNS response with a TTL of zero SHOULD NOT immediately
    delete the record from the cache, but instead record a TTL of
    1 and then delete the record one second later. In the case of
    multiple Multicast DNS responders on the network described in
    Section 6.6 above, if one of the responders shuts down and
    incorrectly sends goodbye packets for its records, it gives
    the other cooperating responders one second to send out their
    own response to "rescue" the records before they expire and
    are deleted.
  * Fixed exception when unregistering a service multiple times
    (#679) @bdraco
  * Added an AsyncZeroconfServiceTypes to mirror ZeroconfServiceTypes
    to zeroconf.asyncio (#658) @bdraco
  * Fixed interface_index_to_ip6_address not skiping ipv4 adapters
    (#651) @bdraco
  * Added async_unregister_all_services to AsyncZeroconf (#649)
    @bdraco
  * Fixed services not being removed from the registry when calling
    unregister_all_services (#644) @bdraco
  * There was a race condition where a query could be answered for
    a service in the registry, while goodbye packets which could
    result in a fresh record being broadcast after the goodbye if
    a query came in at just the right time. To avoid this, we now
    remove the services from the registry right after we generate
    the goodbye packet
  * Fixed zeroconf exception on load when the system disables IPv6
    (#624) @bdraco
  * Fixed the QU bit missing from for probe queries (#609) @bdraco
  * The bit should be set per
    datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-8.1
  * Fixed the TC bit missing for query packets where the known
    answers span multiple packets (#494) @bdraco
  * Fixed packets not being properly separated when exceeding
    maximum size (#498) @bdraco
  * Ensure that questions that exceed the max packet size
    are moved to the next packet. This fixes DNSQuestions
    being sent in multiple packets in violation of:
    datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-7.2
  * Ensure only one resource record is sent when a record exceeds
    _MAX_MSG_TYPICAL datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-17
  * Fixed PTR questions asked in uppercase not being answered
    (#465) @bdraco
  * Added Support for context managers in Zeroconf and AsyncZeroconf
    (#284) @shenek
  * Implemented an AsyncServiceBrowser to compliment the sync
    ServiceBrowser (#429) @bdraco
  * Added async_get_service_info to AsyncZeroconf and async_request
    to AsyncServiceInfo (#408) @bdraco
  * Implemented allowing passing in a sync Zeroconf instance to
    AsyncZeroconf (#406) @bdraco
  * Fixed IPv6 setup under MacOS when binding to "" (#392) @bdraco
  * Fixed ZeroconfServiceTypes.find not always cancels the
    ServiceBrowser (#389) @bdraco
  * There was a short window where the ServiceBrowser thread could
    be left running after Zeroconf is closed because the .join()
    was never waited for when a new Zeroconf object was created
  * Fixed duplicate packets triggering duplicate updates (#376)

    * Implements RFC 6762 sec 5.4: Questions Requesting Unicast
      Responses datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-5.4
    * Implemented protect the network against excessive packet

  Technically backwards incompatible:
    * Update internal version check to match docs (3.6+) (#491)
      @bdraco
    * Python version earlier then 3.6 were likely broken with
      zeroconf already, however, the version is now explicitly
      checked.
    * Update python compatibility as PyPy3 7.2 is required (#523)
      @bdraco
  Backwards incompatible:
    * Drop oversize packets before processing them (#826) @bdraco
    * Oversized packets can quickly overwhelm the system and deny
      service to legitimate queriers. In practice, this is usually
      due to broken mDNS implementations rather than malicious
      actors.
    * Guard against excessive ServiceBrowser queries from PTR
      records significantly lowerthan recommended (#824) @bdraco
    * We now enforce a minimum TTL for PTR records to avoid
      ServiceBrowsers generating excessive queries refresh
      queries. Apple uses a 15s minimum TTL, however, we do not
      have the same level of rate limit and safeguards, so we use
      1/4 of the recommended value.
    * RecordUpdateListener now uses async_update_records instead
      of update_record (#419, #726) @bdraco
      This allows the listener to receive all the records that
      have been updated in a single transaction such as a packet
      or cache expiry.
    * update_record has been deprecated in favor of
      async_update_records A compatibility shim exists to ensure
      classes that use RecordUpdateListener as a base class continue
      to have update_record called, however, they should be updated
      as soon as possible.
    * A new method async_update_records_complete is now called on
      each listener when all listeners have completed processing
      updates and the cache has been updated. This allows
      ServiceBrowsers to delay calling handlers until they are sure
      the cache has been updated as its a common pattern to call
      for ServiceInfo when a ServiceBrowser handler fires.
    * The async_ prefix was chosen to make it clear that these
      functions run in the eventloop and should never do blocking
      I/O. Before 0.32+ these functions ran in a select() loop and
      should not have been doing any blocking I/O, but it was not
      clear to implementors that I/O would block the loop.
    * Pass both the new and old records to async_update_records
      (#792) @bdraco
    * Pass the old_record (cached) as the value and the new_record
      (wire) to async_update_records instead of forcing each consumer
      to check the cache since we will always have the old_record
      when generating the async_update_records call. This avoids
      the overhead of multiple cache lookups for each listener.

- update to 0.31.0:
  * Separated cache loading from I/O in ServiceInfo and fixed cache
    lookup (#356), thanks to J. Nick Koston.
    The ServiceInfo class gained a load_from_cache() method to only
    fetch information from Zeroconf cache (if it exists) with no IO
    performed. Additionally this should reduce IO in cases where
    cache lookups were previously incorrectly failing.

- update to 0.30.0:
  * Some nice refactoring work including removal of the Reaper
    thread, thanks to J. Nick Koston.
  * Fixed a Windows-specific The requested address is not valid in
    its context regression, thanks to Timothee ‘TTimo’ Besset and

- update to 0.27.1
  * Improved the logging situation
  * Large multi-resource responses are now split into separate packets which fixes a bad
    mdns-repeater/ChromeCast Audio interaction ending with ChromeCast Audio crash (and possibly
    some others) and improves RFC 6762 compliance, thanks to Greg Badros
  * Added a warning presented when the listener passed to ServiceBrowser lacks update_service()

    Matt Saxon and Hmmbob were also involved in debugging it.
  * Added support for multiple types to ServiceBrowser, thanks to J. Nick Koston
  * Fixed a race condition where a listener gets a message before the lock is created
  * Fixed a performance regression introduced in 0.26.0, thanks to J. Nick Koston (this is close in
    spirit to an optimization made in 0.24.5 by the same author)
  * Fixed a regression where service update listener wasn't called on IP address change (it's called
    on SRV/A/AAAA record changes now), thanks to Matt Saxon

- Remove patch which was breaking zeroconf dependency check with python3
  (it was making pkg_resources generate a DistributionNotFound exception
  because enum34 wasn't found). enum34 is only required by the python2
  package, which is what the enum-compat  package is all about.
  * python-zeroconf-0.19.1-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch

- Require python-enum-compat to require python-enum34 on python2 and
  nothing on python3, just as the egg's requires.txt file does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  7 22:47:48 UTC 2017 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.19.1:
  * Remove outdated example
  * On Windows, python-netifaces 0.10.5 triggers a bug - This has
    no impact for us, therefore there is no need for us to add a
    version requirement on this dependency as upstream did.
- Rebase patch:
  * Remove
    python-zeroconf-0.17.4-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch.
  * Add python-zeroconf-0.19.1-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch.
