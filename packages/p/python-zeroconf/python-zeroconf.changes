Thu Feb 15 19:04:17 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Remove patch which was breaking zeroconf dependency check with python3
  (it was making pkg_resources generate a DistributionNotFound exception
  because enum34 wasn't found). enum34 is only required by the python2
  package, which is what the enum-compat  package is all about.
  * python-zeroconf-0.19.1-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch 

- Require python-enum-compat to require python-enum34 on python2 and
  nothing on python3, just as the egg's requires.txt file does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  7 22:47:48 UTC 2017 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.19.1:
  * Remove outdated example
  * On Windows, python-netifaces 0.10.5 triggers a bug - This has
    no impact for us, therefore there is no need for us to add a
    version requirement on this dependency as upstream did.
- Rebase patch:
  * Remove
    python-zeroconf-0.17.4-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch.
  * Add python-zeroconf-0.19.1-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch.
