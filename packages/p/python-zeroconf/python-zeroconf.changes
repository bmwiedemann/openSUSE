- update to 0.27.1
  * Improved the logging situation
  * Large multi-resource responses are now split into separate packets which fixes a bad
    mdns-repeater/ChromeCast Audio interaction ending with ChromeCast Audio crash (and possibly
    some others) and improves RFC 6762 compliance, thanks to Greg Badros

    callback

    would deadlock, timeout and incorrectly return None, fix thanks to Erik Montnemery, but
    Matt Saxon and Hmmbob were also involved in debugging it.
  * Added support for multiple types to ServiceBrowser, thanks to J. Nick Koston
  * Fixed a race condition where a listener gets a message before the lock is created
  * Fixed a performance regression introduced in 0.26.0, thanks to J. Nick Koston (this is close in
    spirit to an optimization made in 0.24.5 by the same author)
  * Fixed a regression where service update listener wasn't called on IP address change (it's called
    on SRV/A/AAAA record changes now), thanks to Matt Saxon

- Update requirements based on upstream requires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 15 19:04:17 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Remove patch which was breaking zeroconf dependency check with python3
  (it was making pkg_resources generate a DistributionNotFound exception
  because enum34 wasn't found). enum34 is only required by the python2
  package, which is what the enum-compat  package is all about.
  * python-zeroconf-0.19.1-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch 

- Require python-enum-compat to require python-enum34 on python2 and
  nothing on python3, just as the egg's requires.txt file does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  7 22:47:48 UTC 2017 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.19.1:
  * Remove outdated example
  * On Windows, python-netifaces 0.10.5 triggers a bug - This has
    no impact for us, therefore there is no need for us to add a
    version requirement on this dependency as upstream did.
- Rebase patch:
  * Remove
    python-zeroconf-0.17.4-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch.
  * Add python-zeroconf-0.19.1-enum34-instead-of-enum-compat.patch.
