    and certbot.reverter.Reverter.view_config_changes have been

Tue Jun 18 09:41:01 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 0.35.1
  * Renewal parameter webroot_path is always saved.
  * Scripts in Certbot hook directories are no longer executed when

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 18 23:21:26 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.34.2:
  * Apache plugin now tries to restart httpd on Fedora using systemctl if a
    configuration test error is detected. This has to be done due to the way
    Fedora now generates the self signed certificate files upon first
    restart.
  * Updated Certbot and its plugins to improve the handling of file system permissions
    on Windows as a step towards adding proper Windows support to Certbot.
  * Updated urllib3 to 1.24.2 in certbot-auto.
  * Removed the fallback introduced with 0.32.0 in `acme` to retry a challenge response
    with a `keyAuthorization` if sending the response without this field caused a
    `malformed` error to be received from the ACME server.
  * Linode DNS plugin now supports api keys created from their new panel
    at [cloud.linode.com](https://cloud.linode.com)
  * Adding a warning noting that future versions of Certbot will automatically configure the
    webserver so that all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. You can control this
    behavior and disable this warning with the --redirect and --no-redirect flags.
  * certbot-auto now prints warnings when run as root with insecure file system
    permissions. If you see these messages, you should fix the problem by
    following the instructions at
    https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/certbot-auto-deployment-best-practices/91979/,
    however, these warnings can be disabled as necessary with the flag
    --no-permissions-check.
  * `acme` module uses now a POST-as-GET request to retrieve the registration
    from an ACME v2 server
  * Convert the tsig algorithm specified in the certbot_dns_rfc2136 configuration file to
    all uppercase letters before validating. This makes the value in the config case
    insensitive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 12:20:54 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Add migration script from old certbot to the new one (boo#1119619).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:33:15 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.32.0
  * If possible, Certbot uses built-in support for OCSP from recent 
    cryptography versions instead of the OpenSSL binary: as a 
    consequence Certbot does not need the OpenSSL binary to be 
    installed anymore if cryptography>=2.5 is installed.
  * Certbot and its acme module now depend on josepy>=1.1.0.
  * Apache plugin now respects CERTBOT_DOCS environment variable when 
    adding command line defaults.
  * The running of manual plugin hooks is now always included in 
    Certbot's log output.
  * Tests execution now relies on pytest.
  * An ACME CA server may return a "Retry-After" HTTP header on
    authorization polling, as specified in the ACME protocol, to
    indicate when the next polling should occur. Certbot now reads
    this header if set and respect its value.
  * The acme module avoids sending the keyAuthorization field in
    the JWS payload when responding to a challenge as the field is
    not included in the current ACME protocol. To ease the migration
    path for ACME CA servers, Certbot and its acme module will first
    try the request without the keyAuthorization field but will
    temporarily retry the request with the field included if a
    malformed error is received. This fallback will be removed in
    version 0.34.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 14 10:13:31 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Provide certbot namespace on py2 too to avoid migration conflict

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  8 10:32:10 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.31.0
  * Avoid reprocessing challenges that are already validated when 
    a certificate is issued.
  * Certbot's official Docker images are now based on Alpine Linux 3.9 
    rather than 3.7.
  * Clarify behavior for deleting certs as part of revocation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 29 11:39:30 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.30.2:
  * Update the version of setuptools pinned in certbot-auto to 40.6.3 to
    solve installation problems on newer OSes.
  * Always download the pinned version of pip in pipstrap to address breakages
  * Rename old,default.conf to old-and-default.conf to address commas in filenames
    breaking recent versions of pip.
  * Add VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD=1 to all calls to virtualenv to address breakages
    from venv downloading the latest pip
  * Added the `update_account` subcommand for account management commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 15 06:34:38 UTC 2018 - Thomas Bechtold <tbechtold@suse.com>

- update to 0.29.1:
  * The default work and log directories have been changed back
    to /var/lib/letsencrypt and /var/log/letsencrypt respectively.
  * Noninteractive renewals with `certbot renew` (those not started
    from a terminal) now randomly sleep 1-480 seconds before beginning
    work in order to spread out load spikes on the server side.
  * Added External Account Binding support in cli and acme library.
    Command line arguments --eab-kid and --eab-hmac-key added.
  * Private key permissioning changes: Renewal preserves existing group mode
    & gid of previous private key material. Private keys for new
    lineages (i.e. new certs, not renewed) default to 0o600.
  * Update code and dependencies to clean up Resource and Deprecation Warnings.
  * Only depend on imgconverter extension for Sphinx >= 1.6
