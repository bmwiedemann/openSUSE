Wed Oct  7 08:15:42 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.9.0
  * certbot-auto was deprecated on all systems except for those based on Debian or RHEL.
  * Update the packaging instructions to promote usage of python -m pytest to test Certbot
    instead of the deprecated python setup.py test setuptools approach.
  * Reduced CLI logging when handling some kinds of errors.
  * The minimum version of the acme library required by Certbot was corrected.
    In the previous release, Certbot said it required acme>=1.6.0 when it
    actually required acme>=1.8.0 to properly support removing contact
    information from an ACME account.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 13:57:39 UTC 2020 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to version 1.8.0
  + Added
    * Added the ability to remove email and phone contact
      information from an account
    * using update_account --register-unsafely-without-email
  + Changed
    * Support for Python 3.5 has been removed.
  + Fixed
    * The problem causing the Apache plugin in the Certbot snap on
      ARM systems to
    * fail to load the Augeas library it depends on has been fixed.
    * The acme library can now tell the ACME server to clear
      contact information by passing an empty
    * tuple to the contact field of a Registration message.
    * Fixed the *** stack smashing detected *** error in the
      Certbot snap on some systems.
    * More details about these changes can be found on our GitHub
      repo.
- Add certbot keyring and hash file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 21 08:37:38 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.7.0
  * Third-party plugins can be used without prefix (plugin_name instead of dist_name:plugin_name):
    this concerns the plugin name, CLI flags, and keys in credential files.
    The prefixed form is still supported but is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.
  * We deprecated support for Python 3.5 in Certbot and its ACME library.
    Support for Python 3.5 will be removed in the next major release of Certbot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 13 08:34:32 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.6.0
  * Certbot snaps are now available for the arm64 and armhf architectures.
  * Make Certbot snap find externally snapped plugins
  * Function certbot.compat.filesystem.umask is a drop-in replacement for 
    os.umask implementing umask for both UNIX and Windows systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 11 12:10:12 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.5.0
  * Require explicit confirmation of snap plugin permissions before connecting.
  * Add support for OCSP responses which use a public key hash ResponderID, 
    fixing interoperability with Sectigo CAs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 14 08:28:51 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.4.0
  * Added serial number of certificate to the output of certbot certificates
  * Expose two new environment variables in the authenticator and cleanup scripts used by
    the manual plugin: CERTBOT_REMAINING_CHALLENGES is equal to the number of challenges
    remaining after the current challenge, CERTBOT_ALL_DOMAINS is a comma-separated list
    of all domains challenged for the current certificate.
  * Added minimal proxy support for OCSP verification.
  * mock dependency is now conditional on Python 2 in all of our packages.
  * Fix hanging OCSP queries during revocation checking - added a 10 second timeout.
  * Standalone servers now have a default socket timeout of 30 seconds, fixing
    cases where an idle connection can cause the standalone plugin to hang.
  * Parsing of the RFC 8555 application/pem-certificate-chain now tolerates CRLF line
    endings. This should fix interoperability with Buypass' services.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to version 1.3.0
  * Added
    - Added certbot.ocsp Certbot's API. The certbot.ocsp module can be used to
    - determine the OCSP status of certificates.
    - Don't verify the existing certificate in HTTP01Response.simple_verify, for
    - compatibility with the real-world ACME challenge checks.

  * Changed
    - Certbot will now renew certificates early if they have been revoked according
    - to OCSP.
    - Fix acme module warnings when response Content-Type includes params (e.g. charset).
    - Fixed issue where webroot plugin would incorrectly raise Read-only file system
    - error when creating challenge directories (issue #7165).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 21 15:31:05 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

Fri Jan  3 11:16:34 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 1.0.0 (boo#1160066)
  * certbot-auto has deprecated support for systems using OpenSSL 1.0.1 
    that are not running on x86-64.
  * Certbot's config_changes subcommand has been removed
  * certbot.plugins.common.TLSSNI01 has been removed.
  * The functions certbot.client.view_config_changes,

    certbot.plugins.common.Installer.view_config_changes,
    certbot.reverter.Reverter.view_config_changes, and
    certbot.util.get_systemd_os_info have been removed
  * Certbot's register --update-registration subcommand has been removed
  * When possible, default to automatically configuring the webserver so all requests
    redirect to secure HTTPS access. This is mostly relevant when running Certbot
    in non-interactive mode. Previously, the default was to not redirect all requests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 14 12:19:12 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.40.1

    their filenames end in a tilde.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 18 23:21:26 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.34.2:
  * Apache plugin now tries to restart httpd on Fedora using systemctl if a
    configuration test error is detected. This has to be done due to the way
    Fedora now generates the self signed certificate files upon first
    restart.
  * Updated Certbot and its plugins to improve the handling of file system permissions
    on Windows as a step towards adding proper Windows support to Certbot.
  * Updated urllib3 to 1.24.2 in certbot-auto.
  * Removed the fallback introduced with 0.32.0 in `acme` to retry a challenge response
    with a `keyAuthorization` if sending the response without this field caused a
    `malformed` error to be received from the ACME server.
  * Linode DNS plugin now supports api keys created from their new panel
    at [cloud.linode.com](https://cloud.linode.com)
  * Adding a warning noting that future versions of Certbot will automatically configure the
    webserver so that all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. You can control this
    behavior and disable this warning with the --redirect and --no-redirect flags.
  * certbot-auto now prints warnings when run as root with insecure file system
    permissions. If you see these messages, you should fix the problem by
    following the instructions at
    https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/certbot-auto-deployment-best-practices/91979/,
    however, these warnings can be disabled as necessary with the flag
    --no-permissions-check.
  * `acme` module uses now a POST-as-GET request to retrieve the registration
    from an ACME v2 server
  * Convert the tsig algorithm specified in the certbot_dns_rfc2136 configuration file to
    all uppercase letters before validating. This makes the value in the config case
    insensitive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 12:20:54 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Add migration script from old certbot to the new one (boo#1119619).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:33:15 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.32.0
  * If possible, Certbot uses built-in support for OCSP from recent 
    cryptography versions instead of the OpenSSL binary: as a 
    consequence Certbot does not need the OpenSSL binary to be 
    installed anymore if cryptography>=2.5 is installed.
  * Certbot and its acme module now depend on josepy>=1.1.0.
  * Apache plugin now respects CERTBOT_DOCS environment variable when 
    adding command line defaults.
  * The running of manual plugin hooks is now always included in 
    Certbot's log output.
  * Tests execution now relies on pytest.
  * An ACME CA server may return a "Retry-After" HTTP header on
    authorization polling, as specified in the ACME protocol, to
    indicate when the next polling should occur. Certbot now reads
    this header if set and respect its value.
  * The acme module avoids sending the keyAuthorization field in
    the JWS payload when responding to a challenge as the field is
    not included in the current ACME protocol. To ease the migration
    path for ACME CA servers, Certbot and its acme module will first
    try the request without the keyAuthorization field but will
    temporarily retry the request with the field included if a
    malformed error is received. This fallback will be removed in
    version 0.34.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 14 10:13:31 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Provide certbot namespace on py2 too to avoid migration conflict

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  8 10:32:10 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.31.0
  * Avoid reprocessing challenges that are already validated when 
    a certificate is issued.
  * Certbot's official Docker images are now based on Alpine Linux 3.9 
    rather than 3.7.
  * Clarify behavior for deleting certs as part of revocation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 29 11:39:30 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.30.2:
  * Update the version of setuptools pinned in certbot-auto to 40.6.3 to
    solve installation problems on newer OSes.
  * Always download the pinned version of pip in pipstrap to address breakages
  * Rename old,default.conf to old-and-default.conf to address commas in filenames
    breaking recent versions of pip.
  * Add VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD=1 to all calls to virtualenv to address breakages
    from venv downloading the latest pip
  * Added the `update_account` subcommand for account management commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 15 06:34:38 UTC 2018 - Thomas Bechtold <tbechtold@suse.com>

- update to 0.29.1:
  * The default work and log directories have been changed back
    to /var/lib/letsencrypt and /var/log/letsencrypt respectively.
  * Noninteractive renewals with `certbot renew` (those not started
    from a terminal) now randomly sleep 1-480 seconds before beginning
    work in order to spread out load spikes on the server side.
  * Added External Account Binding support in cli and acme library.
    Command line arguments --eab-kid and --eab-hmac-key added.
  * Private key permissioning changes: Renewal preserves existing group mode
    & gid of previous private key material. Private keys for new
    lineages (i.e. new certs, not renewed) default to 0o600.
  * Update code and dependencies to clean up Resource and Deprecation Warnings.
  * Only depend on imgconverter extension for Sphinx >= 1.6
