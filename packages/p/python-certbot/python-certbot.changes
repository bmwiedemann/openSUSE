Tue Dec  3 14:46:41 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.1
  * The update_symlinks command was removed.
  * The csr_dir and key_dir attributes on 
    certbot.configuration.NamespaceConfig were removed.
  * The --manual-public-ip-logging-ok command line flag was removed.
  * Support for Python 3.8 was deprecated and will be removed in our 
    next planned release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 12:15:06 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to 2.11.0
  * Fixed a bug in Certbot where a CSR's SANs did not always follow 
    the order of the domain names that the user requested interactively. 
    In some cases, the resulting cert's common name might seem picked 
    up randomly from the SANs when it should be the first item the user 
    had in mind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  9 13:49:35 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.10.0:
  * We no longer publish our beta Windows installer as was
    originally announced

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  9 13:21:24 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.9.0:
  * Support for Python 3.12 was added.
  * Updates `joinpath` syntax to only use one addition per call,
    because the multiple inputs version was causing mypy errors
    on Python 3.10.
  * Makes the `reconfigure` verb actually use the staging server
    for the dry run to check the new configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  7 12:09:38 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Add %{?sle15_python_module_pythons}

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  7 10:40:28 UTC 2023 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.8.0
  * Support for Python 3.7 was removed.
  * Stop using the deprecated pkg_resources API included in setuptools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 16 12:56:34 UTC 2023 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.7.4
  * Fixed a bug introduced in version 2.7.0 that caused interactively entered
    webroot plugin values to not be saved for renewal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 30 15:37:44 UTC 2023 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.7.3
  * Add certbot.util.LooseVersion class. See GH #9489.
  * NamespaceConfig now tracks how its arguments were set via a dictionary, allowing us to remove a bunch
    of global state previously needed to inspect whether a user set an argument or not.
  * Support for Python 3.7 was deprecated and will be removed in our next planned release.
  * Added RENEWED_DOMAINS and FAILED_DOMAINS environment variables for consumption by post renewal hooks.
  * Do not call deprecated datetime.utcnow() and datetime.utcfromtimestamp()

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  7 15:37:48 UTC 2023 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.6.0
  * Support for Python 3.11 was added to Certbot and all of its components.
  * The default key type for new certificates is now ECDSA secp256r1 (P-256). It was
    previously RSA 2048-bit. Existing certificates are not affected.
  * acme and Certbot no longer support versions of ACME from before the RFC 8555 standard.
  * acme and Certbot no longer support the old urn:acme:error: ACME error prefix.
  * Removed the deprecated certbot-dns-cloudxns plugin.
  * Certbot will now error if a certificate has --reuse-key set and a conflicting --key-type,
    --key-size or --elliptic-curve is requested on the CLI. Use --new-key to change the key
    while preserving --reuse-key.
  * The zope based interfaces in certbot.interfaces have been removed in favor of the abc
    based interfaces found in the same module.
  * Certbot no longer depends on zope.
  * Removed some deprecated functions and attributes from certbot(.display)?.(crypto_)?util
  * Removed deprecated functions certbot.tests.util.patch_get_utility*. Plugins should now patch
    certbot.display.util themselves in their tests or use certbot.tests.util.patch_display_util
    as a temporary workaround.
  * Fixes a bug where the certbot working directory has unusably restrictive permissions on
    systems with stricter default umasks.
  * Requests to subscribe to the EFF mailing list now time out after 60 seconds.
  * Certbot will no longer respect very long challenge polling intervals, which may be suggested
    by some ACME servers. Certbot will continue to wait up to 90 seconds by default, or up to
    a total of 30 minutes if requested by the server via Retry-After.
  * Allow a user to modify the configuration of a certificate without renewing it using the new
    reconfigure subcommand. See certbot help reconfigure for details.
  * certbot show_account now displays the ACME Account Thumbprint.
  * Certbot will no longer save previous CSRs and certificate private keys to /etc/letsencrypt/csr
    and /etc/letsencrypt/keys, respectively. These directories may be safely deleted.
  * Certbot will now only keep the current and 5 previous certificates in the /etc/letsencrypt/archive
    directory for each certificate lineage. Any prior certificates will be automatically deleted upon
    renewal. This number may be further lowered in future releases.
  * certbot.configuration.NamespaceConfig.key_dir and .csr_dir are now deprecated.
  * We deprecated support for the update_symlinks command. Support will be removed in a following
    version of Certbot.
  * Packaged tests for all Certbot components besides josepy were moved inside the _internal/tests module.
  * Optionally sign the SOA query for dns-rfc2136, to help resolve problems with split-view DNS setups
    and hidden primary setups.
  * There is now a new Other annotated challenge object to allow plugins to support entirely novel challenges.
  * Certbot will no longer try to invoke plugins which do not subclass from the proper certbot.interfaces.{Installer,Authenticator}
    interface (e.g. certbot -i standalone will now be ignored). See GH-9664.
- Drop the signature (last was certbot-1.31.0.tar.gz.asc) and python-certbot.keyring
  * PyPI currently hides the signatures and plans to drop support
  * https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/9707

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  4 15:32:12 UTC 2022 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to 1.31.0
  * If Certbot exits before setting up its usual log files, the temporary
    directory created to save logging information will begin with the name
    certbot-log- rather than a generic name. This should not be considered a
    stable aspect of Certbot and may change again in the future.
  * Fixed an incompatibility in the certbot-dns-cloudflare plugin and the
    Cloudflare library which was introduced in the Cloudflare library version
    2.10.1. The library would raise an error if a token was specified in the
    Certbot --dns-cloudflare-credentials file as well as the cloudflare.cfg
    configuration file of the Cloudflare library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 21 17:47:20 UTC 2022 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.30.0
  * The certbot-dns-cloudxns plugin is now deprecated and will be
    removed in the next major release of Certbot.
  * Lots of deprecations in the acme module.
  * Add UI text suggesting users create certs for multiple domains,
    when possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 11 13:07:42 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.29.0:
  * --allow-subset-of-names will now additionally retry in cases where domains
    are rejected while creating or finalizing orders. This requires subproblem
    support from the ACME server
  * The show_account subcommand now uses the "newAccount" ACME endpoint to
    fetch the account data, so it doesn't rely on the locally stored account URL.
    This fixes situations where Certbot
    would use old ACMEv1 registration info with non-functional account URLs.
  * The generated Certificate Signing Requests are now generated as version 1
    instead of version 3. This resolves situations in where strict enforcement
    of PKCS#10 meant that CSRs that were generated as version 3 were rejected

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 24 19:24:23 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.28.0:
  * Updated Apache/NGINX TLS configs to document contents are based on ssl-config.mozilla.org
  * A change to order finalization has been made to the `acme` module and Certbot:
    - An order's `certificate` field will only be processed if the order's `status` is `valid`.
    - An order's `error` field will only be processed if the order's `status` is `invalid`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 30 09:13:58 UTC 2022 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.27.0
  * The PGP key F2871B4152AE13C49519111F447BF683AA3B26C3 was added
    as an additional trusted key to sign our PyPI packages
  * When certonly is run with an installer specified (e.g. --nginx),
    certonly will now also run restart for that installer
- Refreshed python-certbot.keyring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  7 15:22:22 UTC 2022 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.26.0
  * Added a check whether OCSP stapling is supported by the installer when requesting
    a certificate with the run subcommand in combination with the --must-staple option.
    If the installer does not support OCSP and the --must-staple option is used, Certbot
    will raise an error and quit.
  * Certbot and its acme module now depend on josepy>=1.13.0 due to better type annotation support.
  * Updated dependencies to use new version of cryptography that uses OpenSSL 1.1.1.
  * When the --debug-challenges option is used in combination with -v, Certbot now
    displays the challenge URLs (for http-01 challenges) or FQDNs (for dns-01 challenges)
    and their expected return values.
  * Support for Python 3.6 was removed.
  * All Certbot components now require setuptools>=41.6.0.
  * Certbot and its acme library now require pytz>=2019.3.
  * Revoking a certificate based on an ECDSA key can now be done with --key-path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 21 18:16:52 UTC 2021 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.22.0
  * Support for Python 3.10 was added to Certbot and all of its components.
  * The function certbot.util.parse_loose_version was added to parse version
    strings in the same way as the now deprecated distutils.version.LooseVersion
    class from the Python standard library.
  * Added --issuance-timeout. This option specifies how long (in seconds) Certbot will wait
    for the server to issue a certificate.
  * The function certbot.util.get_strict_version was deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release.
- Refreshed python-certbot.keyring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 13 17:24:10 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 1.20.0
  * Added --no-reuse-key. This remains the default behavior, but
    the flag may be useful to unset the --reuse-key option on
    existing certificates.
- Update to version 1.19.0
  * Several attributes in certbot.display.util and zope based
    interfaces in certbot.interfaces module are deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release of Certbot.
  * Fixed a relatively harmless crash when issuing a certificate
    with --quiet/-q.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 10 13:23:09 UTC 2021 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.18.0
  * New functions that Certbot plugins can use to interact with the user have
    been added to certbot.display.util. We plan to deprecate using IDisplay
    with zope in favor of these new functions in the future.
  * The Plugin, Authenticator and Installer classes are added to
    certbot.interfaces module as alternatives to Certbot's current zope based
    plugin interfaces. The API of these interfaces is identical, but they are
    based on Python's abc module instead of zope. Certbot will continue to
    detect plugins that implement either interface, but we plan to drop support
    for zope based interfaces in a future version of Certbot.
  * The class certbot.configuration.NamespaceConfig is added to the Certbot's
    public API
  * When self-validating HTTP-01 challenges using
    acme.challenges.HTTP01Response.simple_verify, we now assume that the response
    is composed of only ASCII characters. Previously we were relying on the
    default behavior of the requests library which tries to guess the encoding of
    the response which was error prone
  * In order to simplify the transition to Certbot's new plugin interfaces, the
    classes Plugin and Installer in certbot.plugins.common module and
    certbot.plugins.dns_common.DNSAuthenticator now implement Certbot's new
    plugin interfaces. The Certbot plugins based on these classes are now
    automatically detected as implementing these interfaces.
  * The Apache authenticator no longer crashes with "Unable to insert label"
    when encountering a completely empty vhost. This issue affected Certbot 1.17.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 30 08:40:46 UTC 2021 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to version 1.17.0
  * We changed how dependencies are specified between Certbot packages. For this
    and future releases, higher level Certbot components will require that lower
    level components are the same version or newer. More specifically, version X
    of the Certbot package will now always require acme>=X and version Y of a
    plugin package will always require acme>=Y and certbot=>Y. Specifying
    dependencies in this way simplifies testing and development.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 24 08:51:38 UTC 2021 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to version 1.16.0
  * Use UTF-8 encoding for renewal configuration files
  * This release contains a substantial command-line UX overhaul,
    based on previous user research. The main goal was to streamline
    and clarify output. If you would like to see more verbose output, use
    the -v or -vv flags. UX improvements are an iterative process and
    the Certbot team welcomes constructive feedback.
  * Functions certbot.crypto_util.init_save_key and certbot.crypto_util.init_save_csr,
    whose behaviors rely on the global Certbot config singleton, are deprecated and will
    be removed in a future release. Please use certbot.crypto_util.generate_key and
    certbot.crypto_util.generate_csr instead.
  * Installers (e.g. nginx, Apache) were being restarted unnecessarily after dry-run renewals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 12 12:03:50 UTC 2021 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to version 1.15.0
  * Remove further references to certbot-auto in the repo

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 14 15:12:55 UTC 2021 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to version 1.14.0
  * certbot-auto no longer checks for updates on any operating system.
  * Don't output an empty line for a hidden certificate when certbot certificates
    is being used in combination with --cert-name or -d.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  8 08:22:31 UTC 2021 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to version 1.13.0
  * The `--preferred-chain` flag now only checks the Issuer Common Name of the
    topmost (closest to the root) certificate in the chain, instead of checking
    every certificate in the chain.
    See [#8577](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/8577).
  * Support for Python 2 has been removed.
  * CLI flags `--os-packages-only`, `--no-self-upgrade`, `--no-bootstrap` and `--no-permissions-check`,
    which are related to certbot-auto, are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  * Certbot no longer conditionally depends on an external mock module. Certbot's
    test API will continue to use it if it is available for backwards
    compatibility, however, this behavior has been deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release.
  * Certbot and all of its components no longer depend on the library `six`.
  * The update of certbot-auto itself is now disabled on all RHEL-like systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  8 10:19:34 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- update to version 1.11.0
  + Added
    * We deprecated support for Python 2 in Certbot and its ACME
      library. Support for Python 2 will be removed in the next
      planned release of Certbot.
    * certbot-auto was deprecated on all systems. For more
      information about this change, see
      https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/certbot-auto-no-longer-works-on-debian-based-systems/139702/7.
    * We deprecated support for Apache 2.2 in the certbot-apache
      plugin and it will be removed in a future release of Certbot.
  + Fixed
    * The Certbot snap no longer loads packages installed via pip
      install --user. This was unintended and DNS plugins should be
      installed via snap instead.
    * certbot-dns-google would sometimes crash with HTTP 409/412
      errors when used with very large zones. See #6036.
    * certbot-dns-google would sometimes crash with an HTTP 412
      error if preexisting records had an unexpected TTL, i.e.:
      different than Certbot's default TTL for this plugin.
      See #8551.

- update to version 1.10.1
  + Fixed
    * Fixed a bug in certbot.util.add_deprecated_argument that
      caused the deprecated --manual-public-ip-logging-ok flag to
      crash Certbot in some scenarios.

- update to version 1.10.0
  + Added
    * Added timeout to DNS query function calls for dns-rfc2136
      plugin.
    * Confirmation when deleting certificates
    * CLI flag --key-type has been added to specify 'rsa' or
      'ecdsa' (default 'rsa').
    * CLI flag --elliptic-curve has been added which takes an
      NIST/SECG elliptic curve. Any of secp256r1, secp284r1 and
      secp521r1 are accepted values.
    * The command certbot certficates lists the which type of the
      private key that was used for the private key.
    * Support for Python 3.9 was added to Certbot and all of its
      components.
  + Changed
    * certbot-auto was deprecated on Debian based systems.
    * CLI flag --manual-public-ip-logging-ok is now a no-op,
      generates a deprecation warning, and will be removed in a
      future release.
  + Fixed
    * Fixed a Unicode-related crash in the nginx plugin when
      running under Python 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  7 08:15:42 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.9.0
  * certbot-auto was deprecated on all systems except for those based on Debian or RHEL.
  * Update the packaging instructions to promote usage of python -m pytest to test Certbot
    instead of the deprecated python setup.py test setuptools approach.
  * Reduced CLI logging when handling some kinds of errors.
  * The minimum version of the acme library required by Certbot was corrected.
    In the previous release, Certbot said it required acme>=1.6.0 when it
    actually required acme>=1.8.0 to properly support removing contact
    information from an ACME account.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 13:57:39 UTC 2020 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to version 1.8.0
  + Added
    * Added the ability to remove email and phone contact
      information from an account
    * using update_account --register-unsafely-without-email
  + Changed
    * Support for Python 3.5 has been removed.
  + Fixed
    * The problem causing the Apache plugin in the Certbot snap on
      ARM systems to
    * fail to load the Augeas library it depends on has been fixed.
    * The acme library can now tell the ACME server to clear
      contact information by passing an empty
    * tuple to the contact field of a Registration message.
    * Fixed the *** stack smashing detected *** error in the
      Certbot snap on some systems.
    * More details about these changes can be found on our GitHub
      repo.
- Add certbot keyring and hash file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 21 08:37:38 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.7.0
  * Third-party plugins can be used without prefix (plugin_name instead of dist_name:plugin_name):
    this concerns the plugin name, CLI flags, and keys in credential files.
    The prefixed form is still supported but is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.
  * We deprecated support for Python 3.5 in Certbot and its ACME library.
    Support for Python 3.5 will be removed in the next major release of Certbot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 13 08:34:32 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.6.0
  * Certbot snaps are now available for the arm64 and armhf architectures.
  * Make Certbot snap find externally snapped plugins
  * Function certbot.compat.filesystem.umask is a drop-in replacement for
    os.umask implementing umask for both UNIX and Windows systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 11 12:10:12 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.5.0
  * Require explicit confirmation of snap plugin permissions before connecting.
  * Add support for OCSP responses which use a public key hash ResponderID,
    fixing interoperability with Sectigo CAs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 14 08:28:51 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.4.0
  * Added serial number of certificate to the output of certbot certificates
  * Expose two new environment variables in the authenticator and cleanup scripts used by
    the manual plugin: CERTBOT_REMAINING_CHALLENGES is equal to the number of challenges
    remaining after the current challenge, CERTBOT_ALL_DOMAINS is a comma-separated list
    of all domains challenged for the current certificate.
  * Added minimal proxy support for OCSP verification.
  * mock dependency is now conditional on Python 2 in all of our packages.
  * Fix hanging OCSP queries during revocation checking - added a 10 second timeout.
  * Standalone servers now have a default socket timeout of 30 seconds, fixing
    cases where an idle connection can cause the standalone plugin to hang.
  * Parsing of the RFC 8555 application/pem-certificate-chain now tolerates CRLF line
    endings. This should fix interoperability with Buypass' services.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 21 08:13:52 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Fix build without python2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 10 09:23:44 UTC 2020 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to version 1.3.0
  * Added
    - Added certbot.ocsp Certbot's API. The certbot.ocsp module can be used to
    - determine the OCSP status of certificates.
    - Don't verify the existing certificate in HTTP01Response.simple_verify, for
    - compatibility with the real-world ACME challenge checks.

  * Changed
    - Certbot will now renew certificates early if they have been revoked according
    - to OCSP.
    - Fix acme module warnings when response Content-Type includes params (e.g. charset).
    - Fixed issue where webroot plugin would incorrectly raise Read-only file system
    - error when creating challenge directories (issue #7165).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * certbot.plugins.common.TLSSNI01 has been removed.
  * The functions certbot.client.view_config_changes,
    certbot.main.config_changes,
    certbot.plugins.common.Installer.view_config_changes,
    certbot.reverter.Reverter.view_config_changes, and
    certbot.util.get_systemd_os_info have been removed
  * Certbot's register --update-registration subcommand has been removed
  * When possible, default to automatically configuring the webserver so all requests
    redirect to secure HTTPS access. This is mostly relevant when running Certbot
    in non-interactive mode. Previously, the default was to not redirect all requests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 14 12:19:12 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.40.1
  * --server may now be combined with --dry-run.
  * --dry-run now requests fresh authorizations every time, fixing
    the issue where it was prone to falsely reporting success.
  * The OS detection logic again uses distro library for Linux OSes

    removed in a future release.
  * CLI flags --tls-sni-01-port and --tls-sni-01-address have been removed.
  * The values tls-sni and tls-sni-01 for the --preferred-challenges
    flag are no longer accepted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 18 23:21:26 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.34.2:
  * Apache plugin now tries to restart httpd on Fedora using systemctl if a
    configuration test error is detected. This has to be done due to the way
    Fedora now generates the self signed certificate files upon first
    restart.
  * Updated Certbot and its plugins to improve the handling of file system permissions
    on Windows as a step towards adding proper Windows support to Certbot.
  * Updated urllib3 to 1.24.2 in certbot-auto.
  * Removed the fallback introduced with 0.32.0 in `acme` to retry a challenge response
    with a `keyAuthorization` if sending the response without this field caused a
    `malformed` error to be received from the ACME server.
  * Linode DNS plugin now supports api keys created from their new panel
    at [cloud.linode.com](https://cloud.linode.com)
  * Adding a warning noting that future versions of Certbot will automatically configure the
    webserver so that all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. You can control this
    behavior and disable this warning with the --redirect and --no-redirect flags.
  * certbot-auto now prints warnings when run as root with insecure file system
    permissions. If you see these messages, you should fix the problem by
    following the instructions at
    https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/certbot-auto-deployment-best-practices/91979/,
    however, these warnings can be disabled as necessary with the flag
    --no-permissions-check.
  * `acme` module uses now a POST-as-GET request to retrieve the registration
    from an ACME v2 server
  * Convert the tsig algorithm specified in the certbot_dns_rfc2136 configuration file to
    all uppercase letters before validating. This makes the value in the config case
    insensitive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 12:20:54 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Add migration script from old certbot to the new one (boo#1119619).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:33:15 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.32.0
  * If possible, Certbot uses built-in support for OCSP from recent
    cryptography versions instead of the OpenSSL binary: as a
    consequence Certbot does not need the OpenSSL binary to be
    installed anymore if cryptography>=2.5 is installed.
  * Certbot and its acme module now depend on josepy>=1.1.0.
  * Apache plugin now respects CERTBOT_DOCS environment variable when
    adding command line defaults.
  * The running of manual plugin hooks is now always included in
    Certbot's log output.
  * Tests execution now relies on pytest.
  * An ACME CA server may return a "Retry-After" HTTP header on
    authorization polling, as specified in the ACME protocol, to
    indicate when the next polling should occur. Certbot now reads
    this header if set and respect its value.
  * The acme module avoids sending the keyAuthorization field in
    the JWS payload when responding to a challenge as the field is
    not included in the current ACME protocol. To ease the migration
    path for ACME CA servers, Certbot and its acme module will first
    try the request without the keyAuthorization field but will
    temporarily retry the request with the field included if a
    malformed error is received. This fallback will be removed in
    version 0.34.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 14 10:13:31 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Provide certbot namespace on py2 too to avoid migration conflict

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  8 10:32:10 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 0.31.0
  * Avoid reprocessing challenges that are already validated when
    a certificate is issued.
  * Certbot's official Docker images are now based on Alpine Linux 3.9
    rather than 3.7.
  * Clarify behavior for deleting certs as part of revocation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 29 11:39:30 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.30.2:
  * Update the version of setuptools pinned in certbot-auto to 40.6.3 to
    solve installation problems on newer OSes.
  * Always download the pinned version of pip in pipstrap to address breakages
  * Rename old,default.conf to old-and-default.conf to address commas in filenames
    breaking recent versions of pip.
  * Add VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD=1 to all calls to virtualenv to address breakages
    from venv downloading the latest pip
  * Added the `update_account` subcommand for account management commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 15 06:34:38 UTC 2018 - Thomas Bechtold <tbechtold@suse.com>

- update to 0.29.1:
  * The default work and log directories have been changed back
    to /var/lib/letsencrypt and /var/log/letsencrypt respectively.
  * Noninteractive renewals with `certbot renew` (those not started
    from a terminal) now randomly sleep 1-480 seconds before beginning
    work in order to spread out load spikes on the server side.
  * Added External Account Binding support in cli and acme library.
    Command line arguments --eab-kid and --eab-hmac-key added.
  * Private key permissioning changes: Renewal preserves existing group mode
    & gid of previous private key material. Private keys for new
    lineages (i.e. new certs, not renewed) default to 0o600.
  * Update code and dependencies to clean up Resource and Deprecation Warnings.
  * Only depend on imgconverter extension for Sphinx >= 1.6
