Granting users access for mouse configuration
=============================================

Piper utilises the ratbagd daemon to access the mice for configuration.
Access to that daemon is restricted to users in the group "games".
Thus, any user that should be able to utilise Piper needs to be added
to that group. Otherwise Piper will show the following error message on
start: "Cannot connect to ratbagd. Please make sure ratbagd is running
and your user is in the required group."
