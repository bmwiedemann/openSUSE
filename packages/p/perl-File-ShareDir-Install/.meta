  <title>Install shared files</title>
  <description>File::ShareDir::Install allows you to install read-only data files from a
distribution. It is a companion module to the File::ShareDir manpage, which
allows you to locate these files after installation.

It is a port the Module::Install::Share manpage to the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
manpage with the improvement of only installing the files you want; '.svn'
and other source-control junk will be ignored.</description>
