- version update to 0.12.1
  Features
  * If you have a `~trio.abc.ReceiveStream` object, you can now use
    ``async for data in stream: ...`` instead of calling
    `~trio.abc.ReceiveStream.receive_some`. Each iteration gives an
    arbitrary sized chunk of bytes. And the best part is, the loop
    automatically exits when you reach EOF, so you don't have to check for
    it yourself anymore. Relatedly, you no longer need to pick a magic
    buffer size value before calling
    `~trio.abc.ReceiveStream.receive_some`; you can ``await
    stream.receive_some()`` with no arguments, and the stream will
    automatically pick a reasonable size for you. (`#959 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/959>`__)
  * Threading interfaces have been reworked:
    ``run_sync_in_worker_thread`` is now `trio.to_thread.run_sync`, and
    instead of ``BlockingTrioPortal``, use `trio.from_thread.run` and
    `trio.from_thread.run_sync`. What's neat about this is that these
    cooperate, so if you're in a thread created by `to_thread.run_sync`,
    it remembers which Trio created it, and you can call
    ``trio.from_thread.*`` directly without having to pass around a
    ``BlockingTrioPortal`` object everywhere. (`#810 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/810>`__)
  * We cleaned up the distinction between the "abstract channel interface"
    and the "memory channel" concrete implementation.
    `trio.abc.SendChannel` and `trio.abc.ReceiveChannel` have been slimmed
    down, `trio.MemorySendChannel` and `trio.MemoryReceiveChannel` are now
    public types that can be used in type hints, and there's a new
    `trio.abc.Channel` interface for future bidirectional channels. (`#719 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/719>`__)
  * Add :func:`trio.run_process` as a high-level helper for running a process
    and waiting for it to finish, like the standard :func:`subprocess.run` does. (`#822 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/822>`__)
  * On Linux, when wrapping a bare file descriptor in a Trio socket object,
    Trio now auto-detects the correct ``family``, ``type``, and ``protocol``.
    This is useful, for example, when implementing `systemd socket activation
    <http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html>`__. (`#251 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/251>`__)
  * Trio sockets have a new method `~trio.socket.SocketType.is_readable` that allows
    you to check whether a socket is readable. This is useful for HTTP/1.1 clients. (`#760 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/760>`__)
  * We no longer use runtime code generation to dispatch core functions
    like `current_time`. Static analysis tools like mypy and pylint should
    now be able to recognize and analyze all of Trio's top-level functions
    (though some class attributes are still dynamic... we're working on it). (`#805 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/805>`__)
  * Add `trio.hazmat.FdStream` for wrapping a Unix file descriptor as a `~trio.abc.Stream`. (`#829 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/829>`__)
  * Trio now gives a reasonable traceback and error message in most cases
    when its invariants surrounding cancel scope nesting have been
    violated. (One common source of such violations is an async generator
    that yields within a cancel scope.) The previous behavior was an
    inscrutable chain of TrioInternalErrors. (`#882 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/882>`__)
  * MultiError now defines its ``exceptions`` attribute in ``__init__()``
    to better support linters and code autocompletion. (`#1066 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/1066>`__)
  * Use ``__slots__`` in more places internally, which should make Trio slightly faster. (`#984 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/984>`__)
  * In v0.12.0, we accidentally moved ``BlockingTrioPortal`` from ``trio``
    to ``trio.hazmat``. It's now been restored to its proper position.
    (It's still deprecated though, and will issue a warning if you use it.) (`#1167 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/1167>`__)
  Bugfixes
  * Destructor methods (``__del__``) are now protected against ``KeyboardInterrupt``. (`#676 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/676>`__)
  * The :class:`trio.Path` methods :meth:`~trio.Path.glob` and
    :meth:`~trio.Path.rglob` now return iterables of :class:`trio.Path`
    (not :class:`pathlib.Path`). (`#917 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/917>`__)
  * Inspecting the :attr:`~trio.CancelScope.cancel_called` attribute of a
    not-yet-exited cancel scope whose deadline is in the past now always
    returns ``True``, like you might expect. (Previously it would return
    ``False`` for not-yet-entered cancel scopes, and for active cancel
    scopes until the first checkpoint after their deadline expiry.) (`#958 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/958>`__)
  * The :class:`trio.Path` classmethods, :meth:`~trio.Path.home` and
    :meth:`~trio.Path.cwd`, are now async functions.  Previously, a bug
    in the forwarding logic meant :meth:`~trio.Path.cwd` was synchronous
    and :meth:`~trio.Path.home` didn't work at all. (`#960 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/960>`__)
  * An exception encapsulated within a :class:`MultiError` doesn't need to be
    hashable anymore.
