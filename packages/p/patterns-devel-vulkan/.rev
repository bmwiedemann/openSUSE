    <comment>Just talked to Frederic Crozat and he thinks it's a good idea to have a &quot;Vulkan Development&quot; a pattern.

Recently I wrote a short blog article [1] about this topic, but of course it's
easier to just install a Vulkan development pattern.

I will open a pull-request on github [2] for the pattern icon, if my SR gets accepted.
