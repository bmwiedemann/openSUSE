  <title>Modern Perl Interactive Shell</title>
  <description>This is an interactive shell for Perl, commonly known as a REPL - Read,
Evaluate, Print, Loop. The shell provides for rapid development or testing of
code without the need to create a temporary source code file.

Through a plugin system, many features are available on demand. You can also
tailor the environment through the use of profiles and run control files, for
example to pre-load certain Perl modules when working on a particular project.
