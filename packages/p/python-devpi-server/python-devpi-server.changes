- Update to 5.4.1
  * This is the last feature release with Python 2.7 support!
  * Import won't abort anymore when a base index was removed. 
    The bases setting will be imported as is.
  * The ``requires_python`` metadata is now included in version 
    data on mirror indexes.
  * Downloaded files from mirrors can be included in exports with 
    the ``--include-mirrored-files`` option.
  * On import files for mirror indexes are now imported when they 
    were included in the dump (see ``--include-mirrored-files``).
  * Fix ``--no-root-pypi`` option when importing devpi data.
  * Fix pushing from mirror to an index when the file was removed 
    and ``mirror_use_external_urls`` is active.
- Drop Python2 anyway because of pyramid dropping Python2
