- Require python-setuptools instead of distribute (upstreams merged)

- Initial python3 support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 13 20:45:18 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 1.9.1:
  * Just bump version to final, sorry
- Version 1.9
  * Reorganize and update documentation.
  * Add a new way of using versiontools that does not require using
    setup_requires. This way is based on bundling a small helper module to
    help you bootstrap your project when installed from source.
  * Add versiontools.Version.from_expression() that creates a Version object
    from a python import expression (and an optional variable identifer)
  * Move and rename private function versiontools.handle_version to
    versiontools.setuptools_hooks:version().
  * Move and rename private function versiontools.get_exception_message to
    versiontools._get_exception_message().
  * Remove private function versiontools.isstring.

- Simplified macro usage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 24 21:37:26 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 1.8.3:
  * Fix incorrectly specified line in git support. Previosuly a KeyError
    may bleed to the outside calling code, depending on python version. 
  * Fix incorrectly specified line in bzr support. Previously a non-bzr
    directory could be associated as a malformed bzr branch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to 1.8.2:
 * Improve git support by adding code paths compatible with python-git 0.1.6
   (which is easier to get on Debian)
 * Change git support to default to short commit id. If you want to access the
   long commit id you need to access it directly as GitIntegration.commit_id
- Version 1.8.1
 * Improve performance when working with checkouts. The use of branch.nick has
   been replaced with branch._get_nick(local=True). This avoids network
   operations and is much more responsive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 21 18:24:32 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to 1.8:
  * Fixed all pep8 issues (prettier syntax)
  * Fixed an issue with using __import__ on Python 2.4.
  * Fixed an issue with using :versiontools:path.to.symbol with nested modules
  * Fixed an issue with using exceptions on Python 3.x
  * Added test that demostrated that exception handling works on all Python versions.
  * Unified error handling across version control plugins.
  * General documentation improvements, installation, usage, code refrerence,
    and writing additional plug-ins.
  * Added a *backwards incompatible* constraint on serial to be greater than
    zero on alpha, beta and release candidates as required by :pep:`386`.
- Fixed non-executable scripts rpmlint warning

- Update to 1.7:
  * Add support for Mercurial repositories
  * Fix a bug in exception handling that affected 1.6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 23 00:43:54 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.6:
  * Add support for python2.4 and python2.5 thanks to Janis Leidel (thanks!).
  * Add tox (http://codespeak.net/~hpk/tox/) configuration file for easier
    testing.
- Aditional changes from 1.5:
  * Added Git support, contributed by Jannis Leidel (thanks!). To use it you need
    GitPython >= 0.3.2.RC1.
- Aditional changes from 1.4:
  * Work harder to figure out the source tree a __version__ object comes from.
    This is possible with a new function
    :meth:`versiontools.Version.from_tuple_and_hint`.
  * Allow people to omit the version identifier in setup.py (defaulting to
    ``__version__``) 
- Aditional changes from 1.3.2:
  * Change version string produced by :meth:`versiontools.Version.__str__` and
    `versiontools.format_version` to be more useful when vcs integration is not
    available and the release is not final.
- Aditional changes from 1.3.1:
  * To make `setup.py test` work in third party components we cannot use
    versiontools in our own setup.
- Aditional changes from 1.3:
  * Add integration with setuptools (or more accurately, distribute) so that you
    no longer have to try-import versiontools. This means that you may finally
    install your packages with pip and everything will work correctly.
  * Prevent an unexplained crash when following the backtrace in
    ``Version._find_source_tree()``.
- Aditional changes from 1.2:
  * Change how vcs objects are constructed. With this change they are only
    constructed lazily when needed.  This speeds up common operations, delays the
    time any additional modules are imported (if any) and retains backwards comp
    ability.
  * Updated documentation on installation instructions to point to the new PPA
  * Updated recommended usage guide so that installed programs do not depend on
    versiontools. This allows you to use versiontools in setup.py and still
    benefit from the smart version formatting and keep your deployment
    lightweight.
  * Added basic unit tests
  * Fixed most PEP8 issues
