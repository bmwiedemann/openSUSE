  <title>First Class try catch Semantics for Perl</title>
  <description>This module aims to provide a nicer syntax and method to catch errors in
Perl, similar to what is found in other languages (such as Java, Python or
C++). The standard method of using &quot;eval {}; if ($@) {}&quot; is often prone to
subtle bugs, primarily that its far too easy to stomp on the error in
error handlers. And also eval/if isn't the nicest idiom.
