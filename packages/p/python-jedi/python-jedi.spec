%description
Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in
IDEs/editors. Its focus is autocompletion and static
analysis.

Jedi has support for two different goto functions. It's possible to
search for related names and to list all names in a Python file and
infer them. Jedi understands docstrings and you can use Jedi
autocompletion in your REPL as well.

Jedi uses an API to connect with IDEs. There is a reference
implementation as a VIM plugin which uses Jedi's autocompletion.
