Wed Apr 15 10:03:54 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v0.17.0
  * Added ``Project`` support. This allows a user to specify which
    folders Jedi should work with.
  * Added support for Refactoring. The following refactorings have
    been implemented: ``Script.rename``, ``Script.inline``,
    ``Script.extract_variable`` and ``Script.extract_function``.
  * Added ``Script.get_syntax_errors`` to display syntax errors in
    the current script.
  * Added code search capabilities both for individual files and
    projects. The new functions are ``Project.search``,
    ``Project.complete_search``,  ``Script.search`` and
    ``Script.complete_search``.
  * Added ``Script.help`` to make it easier to display a help
    window to people. Now returns pydoc information as well for
    Python keywords/operators.  This means that on the class 
    keyword it will now return the docstring of Python's builtin
    function ``help('class')``.
  * The API documentation is now way more readable and complete.
    Check it out under https://jedi.readthedocs.io. A lot of it
    has been rewritten.
  * Removed Python 3.4 support
  * Many bugfixes

Thu Apr  9 18:59:55 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- reenable (most) unittests

Sat Mar 14 10:16:25 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Remove patches from git in preparation to switch to git service:
  * delete.patch
  * typing.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  6 11:55:48 UTC 2020 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- add typing.patch - fix test_sys_getwindowsversion with new parso 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  4 09:38:03 UTC 2020 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 0.16.0
- add delete.patch
 * Added Script.get_context to get information where you currently are.
 * Completions/type inference of Pytest fixtures.
 * Tensorflow, Numpy and Pandas completions should now be about 4-10x faster after the first time they are used.
 * Dict key completions are working now. e.g. d = {1000: 3}; d[10 will expand to 1000.
 * Completion for “proxies” works now. These are classes that have a __getattr__(self, name) method that does a return getattr(x, name). after loading them initially.
 * Goto on a function/attribute in a class now goes to the definition in its super class.
 * Big Script API Changes:
   + The line and column parameters of jedi.Script are now deprecated
   + completions deprecated, use complete instead
   + goto_assignments deprecated, use goto instead
   + goto_definitions deprecated, use infer instead
   + call_signatures deprecated, use get_signatures instead
   + usages deprecated, use get_references instead
   + jedi.names deprecated, use jedi.Script(...).get_names()
 * BaseDefinition.goto_assignments renamed to BaseDefinition.goto
 * Add follow_imports to Definition.goto. Now its signature matches Script.goto.
 * Python 2 support deprecated. For this release it is best effort. Python 2 has reached the end of its life and now it’s just about a smooth transition. Bugs for Python 2 will not be fixed anymore and a third of the tests are already skipped.
 * Removed settings.no_completion_duplicates. It wasn’t tested and nobody was probably using it anyway.
 * Removed settings.use_filesystem_cache and settings.additional_dynamic_modules, they have no usage anymore. Pretty much nobody was probably using them. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 28 15:02:12 UTC 2019 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 0.15.2
- skip tests based on bundled typeshed
- refreshed unbundle.patch
 * Call signatures are now detected a lot better
 * Add fuzzy completions with Script(...).completions(fuzzy=True)
 * Files bigger than one MB (about 20kLOC) get cropped to avoid
    getting stuck completely.
 * A big refactoring around contexts/values

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 17:06:14 CET 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- So, this is completely boring, non-offensive changelog record,
  which says, that I have also add previously missing skip over
  test_compiled_signature test case, because of
  gh#davidhalter/jedi#1429

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 24 20:07:37 CEST 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Skip TestSetupReadline.test_import because of gh#davidhalter/jedi#1429

Sun Aug 25 17:56:17 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 0.15.1:
  * Small bugfix and removal of a print statement

- changes from version 0.15.0:
  * Added file path completions, there's a new "Completion.type" path,
    now. Example: '/ho -> '/home/
  * *args/**kwargs resolving. If possible Jedi replaces the parameters
    with the actual alternatives.
  * Better support for enums/dataclasses
  * When using Interpreter, properties are now executed, since a lot
    of people have complained about this. Discussion in #1299, #1347.
  * New APIs:
    + Definition.get_signatures() -> List[Signature]. Signatures are
      similar to CallSignature. Definition.params is therefore
      deprecated.
    + Signature.to_string() to format call signatures.
    + Signature.params -> List[ParamDefinition], ParamDefinition has
      the following additional attributes infer_default(),
      infer_annotation(), to_string(), and kind.
    + Definition.execute() -> List[Definition], makes it possible to
      infer return values of functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 16 10:41:56 UTC 2019 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 0.14.1
 * CallSignature.index should now be working a lot better

- Disable tests as it is not working at all on python 3.7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 26 10:48:44 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Do not bother condition for typing, on 3.7+ it is provided by base

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  2 15:12:14 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.13.3:
  * Fixed an issue with embedded Python see https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/issues/870

- update to version 0.13.1
  * Bugfixes, because tensorflow completions were still slow.
- update to version 0.13.0
  * A small release. Some bug fixes.
  * Remove Python 3.3 support. Python 3.3 support has been dropped by the Python
    foundation.
  * Default environments are now using the same Python version as the Python
    process. In 0.12.x, we used to load the latest Python version on the system.
  * Added ``include_builtins`` as a parameter to usages.
  * ``goto_assignments`` has a new ``follow_builtin_imports`` parameter that
    changes the previous behavior slightly.
- Remove test_requrements.patch, no longer needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  2 01:09:29 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * require parso >= 0.3.0
  * remove python-devel requirement

- update to version 0.12.1:
  * This release forces you to upgrade parso. If you don't, nothing
    will work anymore. Otherwise changes should be limited to bug
    fixes. Unfortunately Jedi still uses a few internals of parso that
    make it hard to keep compatibility over multiple releases. Parso
    >=0.3.0 is going to be needed.

- Add new test_requrements.patch to avoid limit on pytest version.
- Disable tests, they don't work in most situations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 16:34:44 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 0.9.0:
  * The import logic has been rewritten to look more like Python's.
    There is now an Evaluator.modules import cache, which resembles
    sys.modules.
  * Integrated the parser of 2to3. This will make refactoring
    possible. It will also be possible to check for error messages
    (like compiling an AST would give) in the future.
  * With the new parser, the evaluation also completely changed.
    It's now simpler and more readable.
  * Completely rewritten REPL completion.
  * Added jedi.names, a command to do static analysis. Thanks to
    that sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!
  * Alpha version of the linter.

- Update to version 0.8.1
  * Bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that 
    improve autocompletion for builtin libraries. Fixed.
- Update to version 0.8.0
  * Memory Consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) 
    has been reduced drastically. Loading times are down as well 
    (it takes basically as long as an import).
  * REPL completion is starting to become usable.
  * Various small API changes. Generally this released focuses on 
    stability and refactoring of internal APIs.
  * Introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating 
    correct Array indices and __getattr__ strings possible.
