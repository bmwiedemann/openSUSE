    <comment>- fix tarball: use the one from PyPI...
- Update to 3.7.2
  - Resolved issues
    * GH#242: Fixed compilation problem on ARM platforms.
- Update to 3.7.1
  - New features
    * Added type stubs to enable static type checking with mypy.
      Thanks to Michael Nix.
    * New ``update_after_digest`` flag for CMAC.
  - Resolved issues
    * GH#232: Fixed problem with gcc 4.x when compiling
      ``ghash_clmul.c``.
    * GH#238: Incorrect digest value produced by CMAC after cloning
      the object.
    * Method ``update()`` of an EAX cipher object was returning the
      underlying CMAC object, instead of the EAX object itself.
    * Method ``update()`` of a CMAC object was not throwing an
      exception after the digest was computed (with ``digest()`` or
      ``verify()``).
- checked in python-pycrytodomex as separate package on request of
  Dirk Müller
- fixed source url
- Update to 3.7.0
  - New features
    * Added support for Poly1305 MAC (with AES and ChaCha20 ciphers
      for key derivation).
    * Added support for ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD cipher.
    * New parameter output for Crypto.Util.strxor.strxor, 
      Crypto.Util.strxor.strxor_c, encrypt and decrypt methods in 
      symmetric ciphers (Crypto.Cipher package). output is a 
      pre-allocated buffer (a bytearray or a writeable memoryview) 
      where the result must be stored. This requires less memory for 
      very large payloads; it is also more efficient when encrypting 
      (or decrypting) several small payloads.
  - Resolved issues
    * GH#266: AES-GCM hangs when processing more than 4GB at a time
      on x86 with PCLMULQDQ instruction.
  - Breaks in compatibility
    * Drop support for Python 3.3.
    * Remove Crypto.Util.py3compat.unhexlify and
      Crypto.Util.py3compat.hexlify.
    * With the old Python 2.6, use only ctypes (and not cffi) to
      interface to native code.
- Clean up spec
- pycryptodomex package spec added
- remove pycryptodomex copy in this package container
- Update to 3.6.6
  - Resolved issues:
    * Fix vulnerability on AESNI ECB with payloads smaller than 
      16 bytes.
- Update to 3.5.5
  - Resolved issues
    * Fixed incorrect AES encryption/decryption with AES 
      acceleration on x86 due to gcc’s optimization and strict 
      aliasing rules.
    * More prime number candidates than necessary where discarded 
      as composite due to the limited way D values were searched 
      in the Lucas test.
    * Fixed ResouceWarnings and DeprecationWarnings.
- Update to 3.5.4
  - New features:
    * Build Python 3.7 wheels on Linux, Windows and Mac.
  - Resolved issues:
    * More meaningful exceptions in case of mismatch in IV length 
      (CBC/OFB/CFB modes).
- Update to 3.6.3 (21 June 2018)
  - Resolved issues
    * GH#175: Fixed incorrect results for CTR encryption/decryption
      with more than 8 blocks.
- Update to 3.6.2 (19 June 2018)
  - New features
    * ChaCha20 accepts 96 bit nonces (in addition to 64 bit nonces)
      as defined in RFC7539.
    * Accelerate AES-GCM on x86 using PCLMULQDQ instruction.
    * Accelerate AES-ECB and AES-CTR on x86 by pipelining AESNI
      instructions.
    * As result of the two improvements above, on x86 (Broadwell):
      - AES-ECB and AES-CTR are 3x faster
      - AES-GCM is 9x faster
  - Resolved issues
    * On Windows, MPIR library was stilled pulled in if renamed to
      ``gmp.dll``.
  - Breaks in compatibility
    * In ``Crypto.Util.number``, functions ``floor_div`` and
      ``exact_div`` have been removed. Also, ``ceil_div`` is limited
      to non-negative terms only.
- suggesting libgmp10 and python-cffi
- add license file tag
- Provide/obsolete also python-crypto for py2 package
- fix condition to act as drop in replacement for python-pycrypto
- Update to 3.6.1 (15 April 2018)
  - New features
    * Added Google Wycheproof tests (https://github.com/google/wycheproof)
      for RSA, DSA, ECDSA, GCM, SIV, EAX, CMAC.
    * New parameter ``mac_len`` (length of MAC tag) for CMAC.
  - Resolved issues
    * In certain circumstances (at counter wrapping, which happens on average after
      32 GBi) AES GCM produced wrong ciphertexts.
    * Method ``encrypt()`` of AES SIV cipher could be still called,
      whereas only ``encrypt_and_digest()`` should be allowed.
- Update to 3.6.0 (8 April 2018)
  - New features
    * Introduced ``export_key`` and deprecated ``exportKey`` for DSA and RSA key
      objects.
    * Ciphers and hash functions accept ``memoryview`` objects in input.
    * Added support for SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256.
  - Resolved issues
    * Reintroduced `Crypto.__version__` variable as in PyCrypto.
    * Fixed compilation problem with MinGW.
- Update to 3.5.1 (8 March 2018)
  - Resolved issues
    * GH#142. Fix mismatch with declaration and definition of addmul128.
- Update to 3.5.0 (7 March 2018)
  - New features
    * Import and export of ECC curves in compressed form.
    * The initial counter for a cipher in CTR mode can be a byte string
      (in addition to an integer).
    * Faster PBKDF2 for HMAC-based PRFs (at least 20x for short passwords,
      more for longer passwords). Thanks to Christian Heimes for pointing
      out the implementation was under-optimized.
    * The salt for PBKDF2 can be either a string or bytes (GH#67).
    * Ciphers and hash functions accept data as `bytearray`, not just
      binary strings.
    * The old SHA-1 and MD5 hash functions are available even when Python's
      own `hashlib` does not include them.
  - Resolved issues
    * Without libgmp, modular exponentiation (since v3.4.8) crashed
      on 32-bit big-endian systems.
  - Breaks in compatibility
    * Removed support for Python &lt; 2.6.
- Update to 3.4.12 (5 February 2018)
  - Resolved issues
    * GH#129. pycryptodomex could only be installed via wheels.
- Update to 3.4.11 (5 February 2018)
  - Resolved issues
    * GH#121. the record list was still not correct due to PEP3147
      and __pycache__ directories. Thanks again to John O'Brien.
- Update to 3.4.10 (2 February 2018)
  - Resolved issues
    * When creating ElGamal keys, the generator wasn't a square residue:
      ElGamal encryption done with those keys cannot be secure under
      the DDH assumption. Thanks to Weikeng Chen.
- Update to 3.4.9 (1 February 2018)
  - New features
    * More meaningful error messages while importing an ECC key.
  - Resolved issues
    * GH#123 and #125. The SSE2 command line switch was not always passed on
      32-bit x86 platforms.
    * GH#121. The record list (--record) was not always correctly filled for
      the pycryptodomex package. Thanks to John W. O'Brien.
- Update to 3.4.8 (27 January 2018)
  - New features
    * Added a native extension in pure C for modular exponentiation, optimized
      for SSE2 on x86.
      In the process, we drop support for the arbitrary arithmetic library MPIR
      on Windows, which is painful to compile and deploy.
      The custom  modular exponentiation is 130% (160%) slower on an Intel CPU
      in 32-bit (64-bit) mode, compared to MPIR. Still, that is much faster
      that CPython's own `pow()` function which is 900% (855%) slower than MPIR.
      Support for the GMP library on Unix remains.
    * Added support for *manylinux* wheels.
    * Support for Python 3.7.
  - Resolved issues
    * The DSA parameter 'p' prime was created with 255 bits cleared
      (but still with the correct strength).
    * GH#106. Not all docs were included in the tar ball.
      Thanks to Christopher Hoskin.
    * GH#109. ECDSA verification failed for DER encoded signatures.
      Thanks to Alastair Houghton.
    * Human-friendly messages for padding errors with ECB and CBC.
- provide python-crypto 2.6.1
- Initial version

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 3.10.1:
  * Python 3 wheels use ``abi3`` ABI tag.
  * Remove Appveyor CI.
  
  3.10.0 (6 February 2021)
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
  Resolved issues
  ---------------
  * Fixed a potential memory leak when initializing block ciphers.
  * GH#466: ``Crypto.Math.miller_rabin_test()`` was still using the system random
    source and not the one provided as parameter.
  * GH#469: RSA objects have the method ``public_key()`` like ECC objects.
    The old method ``publickey()`` is still available for backward compatibility.
  * GH#476: ``Crypto.Util.Padding.unpad()`` was raising an incorrect exception
    in case of zero-length inputs. Thanks to Captainowie.
  * GH#491: better exception message when ``Counter.new()`` is called with an integer
    ``initial_value`` than doesn't fit into ``nbits`` bits.
  * GH#496: added missing ``block_size`` member for ECB cipher objects. Thanks to willem.
  * GH#500: ``nonce`` member of an XChaCha20 cipher object was not matching the original nonce.
    Thanks to Charles Machalow.
  
  Other changes
  -------------
  * The bulk of the test vectors have been moved to the separate
    package ``pycryptodome-test-vectors``. As result, packages ``pycryptodome`` and
    ``pycryptodomex`` become significantly smaller (from 14MB to 3MB).
  * Moved CI tests and build service from Travis CI to GitHub Actions.

    <version>3.11.0</version>
    <time>1634587149</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 3.11.0:
  * GH#512: Especially for very small bit sizes, ``Crypto.Util.number.getPrime()`` was
    occasionally generating primes larger than given the bit size.
  * GH#552: Correct typing annotations for ``PKCS115_Cipher.decrypt()``.
  * GH#555: ``decrypt()`` method of a PKCS#1v1.5 cipher returned a ``bytearray`` instead of ``bytes``.
  * GH#557: External DSA domain parameters were accepted even when the modulus (``p``) was not prime.
    This affected ``Crypto.PublicKey.DSA.generate()`` and ``Crypto.PublicKey.DSA.construct()``.
  * Added cSHAKE128 and cSHAKE256 (of SHA-3 family).
  * GH#558: The flag RTLD_DEEPBIND passed to ``dlopen()`` is not well supported by
    `address sanitizers &lt;https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/611&gt;`_.
    It is now possible to set the environment variable ``PYCRYPTDOME_DISABLE_DEEPBIND``
    to drop that flag and allow security testing.</comment>
