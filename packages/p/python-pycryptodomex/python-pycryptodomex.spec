%description
PyCryptodomex is a self-contained Python package of low-level
cryptographic primitives.

Unlike PyCryptodome, it resides in its own namespace `Cryptodome`.

PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
for instance:

* Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
* Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
* First class support for PyPy
* Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256 curve only)
* Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for
  ciphers, automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified
  CTR cipher mode, and more)
* SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs), SHA-512/t and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
* Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
* Poly1305 MAC
* ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated cipher
* scrypt and HKDF
* Deterministic (EC)DSA
* Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
* Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
* Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a
  CSPRNG in userspace)
* Simplified install process, including better support for Windows
* Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
* Major clean ups and simplification of the code base

PyCryptodomex is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure
Python. Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance
(e.g. block ciphers) are implemented as C extensions.
