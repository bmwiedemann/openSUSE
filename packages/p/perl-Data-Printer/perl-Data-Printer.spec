%description
The ever-popular Data::Dumper is a fantastic tool, meant to stringify data
structures in a way they are suitable for being "eval"'ed back in. The
thing is, a lot of people keep using it (and similar ones, like Data::Dump)
to print data structures and objects on screen for inspection and
debugging, and while you _can_ use those modules for that, it doesn't mean
you _should_.

This is where Data::Printer comes in. It is meant to do one thing and one
thing only:

_format Perl variables and objects to be inspected by a human_

If you want to serialize/store/restore Perl data structures, this module
will NOT help you. Try Storable, Data::Dumper, JSON, or whatever. CPAN is
full of such solutions!

Whenever you type 'use Data::Printer' or 'use DDP', we export two functions
to your namespace:

%prep
%autosetup  -n %{cpan_name}-%{version}

%build
perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
%make_build

%check
make test

%install
%perl_make_install
%perl_process_packlist
%perl_gen_filelist

%files -f %{name}.files
%doc Changes CONTRIBUTING.md examples README.md
