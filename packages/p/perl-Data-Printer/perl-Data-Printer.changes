          - 'resolve_scalar_refs' option to show values instead of just

          - 'dump' mode working as expected again;
      OTHER:

          - fix Panda::Date test when en_US locale not present (Slaven Rezić)
  0.99_008 2018-05-20
      NEW FEATURES:

            and string values of a variable are set to a different thing
            (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
          - maybe_colorize() accepts a 'default color' so filters can use it.

          - extra debug info on test failures
          - cleanup on unreachable code
  0.99_001 2018-04-21
      BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
          - new format for the .dataprinterrc file
      NEW FEATURES:
          - Data::Printer::Object available for public usage!
            (big thanks to frew && rjbs)
          - use DDP; p $foo, as => 'this is a label';
            Hopefully this helps people tag their debug code without having
            to write caller_info => 1, caller_message => '...'
          - theme => 'XXX' will try and load Data::Printer::Theme::XXX,
            which you can create to share your colour scheme with the world!
          - speaking of colours, you can now use up to 256 of them
            (if your terminal supports them, of course)
          - print only a slice of arrays and hashes with:
             - array_max => 10 (default is 50, set it to 0 for unlimited)
             - array_overflow => '(...skipping __SKIPPED__ items...)'
             - array_preserve => 'begin'
               if the array has more than array_max elements, preserve the first
               array_max elements and replace the rest with '(...skipping XX items...)'.
               Other available options are 'end', 'middle', 'extremes', and 'none'.
             - hash_max / hash_overflow / hash_preserve (same! note however that
               preserved keys will only be the same if hash keys are sorted)
               Defaults to 50.
          - ignore_keys to skip their dump (feature by Eugen Konkov)
          - string_max/string_overflow/string_preserve to limit string entries (scalars),
            just like arrays and hashes. Defaults to 1024 and 'begin'. Set it
            to 0 for unlimited size.
          - new 'separator', 'brackets' and 'overflow' colors to control
          - unicode_charnames, when set to 1 (together with escape_chars)
            will try and use the Unicode name when escaping strings.
            So `$s = "\x{2603}"; p $s` will output "\N{SNOWMAN}"
          - show_refcount => 1 exposes the reference count for the data structure
            (and inner data) if the count is greater than 1. (default 0, showing no refcounts).
          - show_memsize => 1 shows the (approximated) amount of memory the variable
            occupies for all variables on that level. This means that '1' will show
            the size of the entire data structure, while 2 will also show sizes of
            inner data, 3 will go even deeper and so on. To get the size of everything,
            use 'all' - though usually you'll probably want to just use '1'.
            This requires Devel::Size, so the default is 0 for none.
          - memsize_unit defined in which unit to show the memory usage. Can be
            set to 'b'(ytes), 'k'(ilobytes), 'm'(egabytes) or 'auto' (the default).
          - new property 'format_inheritance', defaults to "lines", a shiny and much
            clearer new way to displays methods per inherited package. You may also
            set it to 'string' to preserve the old behaviour.
          - inheritance tree is considered when filtering objects unless you disable
            it with 'parent_filters => 0' (Ovid)
          - new option 'stringify' (default: 1) will return the stringified version
            of the object, if one is available. It will try overloaded strings/numbers,
            as_string() and stringify() calls, respectively. Note that this will efectivelly
            ignore all other class details you may have chosen.
            (Sergey Aleynikov, Benct Philip Jonsson)
          - new option show_overloads (default: 1) will list all overloads
            from the object's class.
          - the standard class filter is now able to show internals in blessed subs
          - support for faster natural sorting via Sort::Key::Natural
            if the user has it installed (feature request by @grr on github)
      BUG FIXES:
          - fix array subelement alignment when index is shown (GARU)
          - show UNIVERSAL in linear ISA if it's on (GARU)
          - use "\n" instead of $/ as default line separator (Håkon Hægland && Chung-Kuan Tsai)
          - less magic added to internal Perl representation of variables
            (Jarrod Funnell, Sergey Aleynikov, Michael Conrad, Nicolas R.)
          - show_methods is now independent from show_inherited, meaning you can
            check all inherited methods and no local ones, or any combination thereof.
            This is the expected behaviour from the documentation, but was not happening.

  0.36 2015-05-29
      Bumping 0.35_01 to stable. Below is the (repeated) changelog,
      with the single addition of the 'scalar_quotes' patch.
  
      BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
          - p()'s return value now defaults to 'pass'. Please see
            https://github.com/garu/Data-Printer/issues/16 for the
            full discussion. THIS WILL BREAK CODE RELYING ON p() TO
            RETURN A STRING. To fix your code, please set 'return_value'
            to 'dump' explicitly, or use the experimental np() function.
  
      NEW HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE:
          - np(), a version of p() that always returns the string instead
            of printing it.
  
      NEW FEATURES:
          - Add 'escape_chars' to allow \x{...} printing for chars
            (patch by Mark Fowler)
          - 'scalar_quotes' let you specify the quote to use when,
            well, quoting (Ivan Bessarabov)
          - Class::Date support in the DateTime filter (Ivan Bessarabov)
  
      BUG FIXES:
          - fixed crash in esoteric classes (github issue #41, thanks
            Ivan Bessarabov for reporting)
          - removed support for Digest::Haval256, as it can't really be
            observed without damaging the original data. If future versions
            provide a clone() function, it can be added again.
          - Being extra loud when rc files fail to load (RT#89203, thanks
            Caleb Cushing for reporting).
          - Prevents PERL5OPT from interfering with deparse tests (github
            issue #55, thanks David Precious for reporting)
  
      OTHER:
          - more tests
          - new external filter indexed: PDL
  
  0.35_01 2014-12-22
      BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
          - p()'s return value now defaults to 'pass'. Please see
            https://github.com/garu/Data-Printer/issues/16 for the
            full discussion. THIS WILL BREAK CODE RELYING ON p() TO
            RETURN A STRING. To fix your code, please set 'return_value'
            to 'dump' explicitly, or use the experimental np() function.
  
      NEW HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE:
          - np(), a version of p() that always returns the string instead
            of printing it.
