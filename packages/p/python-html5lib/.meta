  <title>HTML parser based on the WHAT-WG Web Applications</title>
  <description>HTML parser designed to follow the WHATWG HTML5 specification. The parser is designed to handle all
flavours of HTML and parses invalid documents using well-defined error handling rules compatible
with the behaviour of major desktop web browsers.
Output is to a tree structure; the current release supports output to ElementTree (including
cElementTree and lxml.etree), minidom, and a custom simpletree format.
html5lib also includes a HTML sanitizer, &quot;treewalkers&quot; for converting various tree formats into
streams and filters and serializers to operate on those streams.
