Sat Oct 29 12:01:57 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.6:
  * https://github.com/tartley/colorama/pull/139 Add alternative to 'init()',
    called 'just_fix_windows_console'. This fixes many longstanding problems
    with 'init', such as working incorrectly on modern Windows terminals, and
    wonkiness when init gets called multiple times. The intention is that it
    just makes all Windows terminals treat ANSI the same way as other terminals
    do. Many thanks the njsmith for fixing our messes. 
  * https://github.com/tartley/colorama/pull/352 Support Windows 10's ANSI/VT
    console. This didn't exist when Colorama was created, and avoiding us
    causing havok there is long overdue. Thanks to segeviner for the initial
    approach, and to njsmith for getting it merged.
  * https://github.com/tartley/colorama/pull/338 Internal overhaul of package
    metadata declaration, which abolishes our use of the now heavily
    discouraged setuptools (and hence setup.py, setup.cfg and MANIFEST.in), in
    favor of hatchling (and hence pyproject.toml), generously contributed by
    ofek (author of hatchling). This includes dropping support Python3.5 and
    3.6, which are EOL, and were already dropped from setuptools, so this
    should not affect our users.
  * https://github.com/tartley/colorama/pull/353 Attention to detail award to
    LqdBcnAtWork for a spelling fix in demo06
