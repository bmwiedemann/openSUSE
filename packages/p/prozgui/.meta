  <title>GUI Advanced Linux Download Manager</title>
  <description>This is the GUI version of ProZilla. It uses libprozilla and the GUI is
created and designed with the Fast Light Tool Kit (fltk).

ProZilla is a download accelerator program written for Linux to speed
up the normal file download process. It often gives speed increases of
around 200% to 300%. It supports both the FTP and HTTP protocols, and
the theory behind it is very simple. The program opens multiple
connections to a server, and each of the connections downloads a part
of the file, thus defeating existing Internet congestion prevention
methods which slow down a single connection based download.</description>
