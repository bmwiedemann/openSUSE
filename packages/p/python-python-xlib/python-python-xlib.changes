    and possible crashes when unpacking text data
  * add support for error handlers to the Composite extension

Tue Nov 27 09:04:39 UTC 2018 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 0.23 (changes since 0.19):
  * Fix unclosed file in Xauth implementation.
  * Fix support for Window.set_wm_transient_for.
  * Fix support for Drawable.put_image / Drawable.get_image.
  * Use Latin-1 for decoding strings in Python 3 (same as Python 2).
  * Fix Python 3 warnings about array.tostring() (deprecated).
  * When DISPLAY does not specify a protocol, and the implicit Unix
    socket connection fails, fallback to TCP (mimicking XCB's
    behaviour).
  * Fix Display.change_pointer_control implementation.
  * Fix Drawable.put_pil_image implementation.
  * Don't bundle a copy of texi2html to build the HTML
    documentation, but use the currently installed version instead.
  * Improve response processing performance: reduce the number of
    `socket.recv` calls needed to receive a full response.
- Remove python-xlib-0.14-increase-receiving-buffer.patch: no
  longer needed, see commit 1958a82.

- Update to Version 0.19
  + Bug Fixes
    * don't throw an exception if $XAUTHFILE / ~/.Xauthority is missing
    * fix authentication work-around for SSH forwarding under Python 3
    * improve $DISPLAY handling: support optional protocol prefix, and
      correctly handle `unix:0.0` as `:0.0`
- Update to  Version 0.18
  + Bug Fixes
    * fix Python 3 buffer abstraction
    * fix interrupted select handling for Python 3.3/3.4
    * fix Unix socket support when only an abstract address is available
- Update to  Version 0.17
  + Bug Fixes
    * fix Xauth handling when using Python 2 and DISPLAY contains a remote IP
    * fix String16 request field handling when using Python 3
    * fix RECORD extension and example when using Python 3
    * fix handling of properties: use byte strings for all X11 8-bits
      strings, as not all of them are text properties (the window
      getters/setters for wm_name, wm_icon_name, wm_class, and
      wm_client_machine still return/expect Unicode strings)
  + API Changes
    * Core:
      > new window getter/setter for text properties: get_full_text_property
        and change_text_property; with automatic conversion to/from Unicode
        when the property type encoding is supported (STRING and UTF8_STRING)
    * Composite extension:
      > support for GetOverlayWindow request
- Update to  Version 0.16
  + Licensing
    * The project is now licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
      v2.1 or later (see the LICENSE file for details).
  + Compatibility
    * Support for Python versions older than 2.7 has been dropped. Support for
      Python 3 (3.3, 3.4 and 3.5) has been added. Note that Python-Xlib now
      depends on the six package (>=1.10) for combined Python 2 / 3 support.
  + API Changes
    * With the change of license, and no way to contact the original author of
      the SHAPE extension, the code had to be rewritten from scratch. This
      resulted in a few minor API changes (see examples/shapewin.py).
    * Partial support for the SECURITY. XInput, and XFIXES extensions has been
      added.
  + Bug Fixes
    *  fix RECORD extension
    *  fixed OS X socket path
    *  fix handling of generic events
    *  fix handling of KeymapNotify events
    *  several fixes for the RandR extension
- Update to Version 0.15rc1
  + Composite extension
    * Support for the composite extension, used to implement a composition
      manager (added for plcm work in plwm).
  + XF86 special function keysyms
    * Keysym definitions for special function keys found on modern
      keyboards, e.g. raise and lower volume, start specific applications,
      etc.  Have a look in Xlib/keysymdef/xf86.py to see what there are and
      experiment with xev to see what your keyboard generates.  These
      definitions aren't brought in by default, so you must do this after
      importing Xlib.XK:
    * Xlib.XK.load_keysym_group('xf86')
  + RANDR extension
    * The RANDR extension complements XINERAMA as a way of getting data about the
      physical screens making up a virtual screen in X. An example of usage can
      be found in examples/xrandr.py.
- Rename to python-python-xlib to follow python package
  naming rules.
- Change license to LGPL-2.1+
- Remove upstream-included patches:
  * python-xlib-0.14-fix-unix-socket-in-display.patch
  * python-xlib-0.14-xauthlocalhostname.patch
- Rebase python-xlib-0.14-increase-receiving-buffer.patch
