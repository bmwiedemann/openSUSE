%description
This is a factored out version of ``unparse`` found in the Python
source distribution; under Demo/parser in Python 2 and under
Tools/parser in Python 3.

This library is single-source compatible with Python 2.6 through
Python 3.5. It is authored by the Python core developers; I have
simply merged the Python 2.7 and the Python 3.5 source and test
suites, and added a wrapper. This factoring out is to provide a
library implementation that supports both versions.

Added to this is a pretty-printing dump utility function.
