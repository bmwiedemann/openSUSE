Sat Nov 23 11:04:14 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to yt-4.4.0:
  * the frontend previously known as boxlib was renamed to AMReX
  * this release contains a brand new frontend for Parthenon
    datasets.
  * off-axis projections are now supported
  * improved convergence with grid resolution
  * improved mass conservation
  * fixed a critical bug where column densities estimates were
    incorrect by a factor x3
    calculation for Ramses, by @cphyc

  * Change in the way cooling tables are used. If "self-
    shielding" is detected from the namelist or is set by the
    user with `ds=yt.load("output_12345", self_shielding=True)`,
    the hydrogen number density used to obtain cooling, heating
    and $$\mu$$ from the cooling tables are multiplied by an
    exponential prefactor, consistently with what RAMSES is doing
    internally. This will change the values of the cooling and
    heating rates, as well as $$\mu$$ and temperature at high-
    densities (above 0.01 mp/cm³).

- Upgrade to 4.1.3:
  This is the third bugfix release in the yt 4.1.x series. It
  contains fixes to bugs discovered since the 4.1.2 release. Most
  importantly, it reverts a unstable patch that was accidentally
  included in yt 4.1.2 (#4198). EWAH files should now behave as
  in yt 4.1.1, and we're aiming at re-releasing the new behaviour
  (with fixes) in yt 4.2.0
  - Bug fixes
    - #4231 Fix pixel size calculation for density option in
      particle projection plots and FITS images, by @jzuhone
    - #4239 Fix a broken docs example, by @neutrinoceros
  - Build and testing
    - #4247 ignore a deprecation warning triggered from cartopy,
      by @neutrinoceros
    - #4250 Revert "Backport PR #4198 on branch yt-4.1.x
      (Automatically find EWAH files with increased
      index_order2)", by @neutrinoceros
    - #4258 on branch yt-4.1.x, by @neutrinoceros
  - There are no new features or deprecations in this version,
    all users are encouraged to upgrade.

DO NOT SUBMIT TO FACTORY, CFLAGS includes "-freport-bug"

- Upgrade to 4.1.2:
  It contains fixes to bugs discovered since the 4.1.1
  release. There are no new features or deprecations in this
  version, all users are encouraged to upgrade.
- Upgrade to 4.1.1:
  It contains a couple of critical fixes to bugs discovered since
  the 4.1.0 release. Most importantly, it resolves a memory leak
  that was affecting octree-based frontends (RAMSES and ART).
  There are no new features or deprecations in this version, all
  users are encouraged to upgrade.
- Upgrade to 4.1.0:
  It contains about a year of work by many contributors, with
  many new features and improvements to the code base. It is also
  the first release to officially supported Python 3.11.
  Some deprecations from yt < 4 are now expired, some minor
  backwards incompatibilities are expected. Anything broken on
  purpose in this version should correspond to a warning in yt
  4.0.x, anything beyond that should be considered a regression;
  please report any unexpected breaking change.

    data using the ``dynamic`` kwarg. `PR 2149 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2149>`__.
  * show/hide colorbar and show/hide axes are now available for
    ``ProfilePlot`` s. These functions were also moved from the PlotWindow to the

    including above and below values, inside or outside regions, equal values, or nans.
    See `PR 1964 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/1964>`__ and supporting
    documentation fix at `PR 2262 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2262>`__.

    smoothed grids) to ``xarray`` `PR 2294 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2294>`__.
  * add automatic loading of ``namelist.txt``, which contains the parameter file
    RAMSES uses to produce output `PR 2347 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2347>`__.
  * adds support for a nearest neighbor value field, accessible with
    the ``add_nearest_neighbor_value_field`` function for particle fields. See
    `PR 2301 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2301>`__.
