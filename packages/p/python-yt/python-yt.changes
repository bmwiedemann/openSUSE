- Upgrade to 4.1.3:
  This is the third bugfix release in the yt 4.1.x series. It
  contains fixes to bugs discovered since the 4.1.2 release. Most
  importantly, it reverts a unstable patch that was accidentally
  included in yt 4.1.2 (#4198). EWAH files should now behave as
  in yt 4.1.1, and we're aiming at re-releasing the new behaviour
  (with fixes) in yt 4.2.0
  - Bug fixes
    - #4231 Fix pixel size calculation for density option in
      particle projection plots and FITS images, by @jzuhone
    - #4239 Fix a broken docs example, by @neutrinoceros
  - Build and testing
    - #4247 ignore a deprecation warning triggered from cartopy,
      by @neutrinoceros
    - #4250 Revert "Backport PR #4198 on branch yt-4.1.x
      (Automatically find EWAH files with increased
      index_order2)", by @neutrinoceros
    - #4258 on branch yt-4.1.x, by @neutrinoceros
  - There are no new features or deprecations in this version,
    all users are encouraged to upgrade.

DO NOT SUBMIT TO FACTORY, CFLAGS includes "-freport-bug"

- Upgrade to 4.1.2:
  It contains fixes to bugs discovered since the 4.1.1
  release. There are no new features or deprecations in this
  version, all users are encouraged to upgrade.
- Upgrade to 4.1.1:
  It contains a couple of critical fixes to bugs discovered since
  the 4.1.0 release. Most importantly, it resolves a memory leak
  that was affecting octree-based frontends (RAMSES and ART).
  There are no new features or deprecations in this version, all
  users are encouraged to upgrade.
- Upgrade to 4.1.0:
  It contains about a year of work by many contributors, with
  many new features and improvements to the code base. It is also
  the first release to officially supported Python 3.11.
  Some deprecations from yt < 4 are now expired, some minor
  backwards incompatibilities are expected. Anything broken on
  purpose in this version should correspond to a warning in yt
  4.0.x, anything beyond that should be considered a regression;
  please report any unexpected breaking change.

- update to version 3.6.1
  * The angular momentum has been reversed compared to previous versions of yt. 
    See `PR 2043 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/2043>`__.
  * New frontend support for the code AMRVAC. Many thanks to Clement Robert 
    and Niels Claes who were major contributors to this initiative. Relevant PRs include:
  * Support for the AdaptaHOP halo finder code 
    `PR 2385 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2385>`__.
  * yt now supports geographic transforms and projections of data with 
    cartopy with support from `PR 1966 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/1966>`__.
  * annotations used to work for only a single point, they now work for multiple points 
    on a plot, see `PR 2122 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2122>`__.
  * cosmology calculations now have support for the relativistic energy density of the 
    universe, see `PR 1714 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/1714>`__. 
    This feature is accessible to cosmology datasets and was added to the Enzo frontend. 
  * the eps writer now allows for arrow rotation. this is accessible with 
    the ``rotate`` kwarg in the ``arrow`` function. 
    See `PR 2151 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2151>`__.
  * allow for dynamic load balancing with parallel loading of timeseries 
    data using the ``dynamic`` kwarg. `PR 2149 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2149>`__.
  * show/hide colorbar and show/hide axes are now available for 
    ``ProfilePlot`` s. These functions were also moved from the PlotWindow to the 
    PlotContainer class. `PR 2169 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2169>`__.
  * add support for ipywidgets with an ``__ipython_display__`` method on the 
    FieldTypeContainer. Field variables, source, and the field array can be 
    viewed with this widget. See PRs `PR 1844 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/1844>`__ 
    and `PR 1848 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/1848>`__, 
    or try ``display(ds.fields)`` in a Jupyter notebook.
  * cut regions can now be made with ``exclude_`` and ``include_`` on a number of objects, 
    including above and below values, inside or outside regions, equal values, or nans. 
    See `PR 1964 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/1964>`__ and supporting 
    documentation fix at `PR 2262 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2262>`__.
  * previously aliased fluid vector fields in curvilinear geometries were not 
    converted to curvilinear coordinates, this was addressed in 
    `PR 2105 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2105>`__.
  * 2d polar and 3d cylindrical geometries now support annotate_quivers, 
    streamlines, line integral convolutions, see 
    `PR 2105 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2105>`__.
  * add support for exporting data to firefly `PR 2190 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/2190>`__.
  * gradient fields are now supported in curvilinear geometries. See 
    `PR 2483 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2483>`__.
  * plotwindow colorbars now utilize mathtext in their labels, 
    from `PR 2516 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2516>`__.
  * raise deprecation warning when using ``mylog.warn``. Instead use 
    ``mylog.warning``. See `PR 2285 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2285>`__.
  * extend support of the ``marker``, ``text``, ``line`` and ``sphere`` annotation 
    callbacks to polar geometries  `PR 2466 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2466>`__.
  * Support MHD in the GAMER frontend  `PR 2306 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/2306>`__.
  * Export data container and profile fields to AstroPy QTables and 
    pandas DataFrames  `PR 2418 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2418>`__.
  * Add turbo colormap, a colorblind safe version of jet.  See 
    `PR 2339 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2339>`__.
  * Enable exporting regular grids (i.e., covering grids, arbitrary grids and 
    smoothed grids) to ``xarray`` `PR 2294 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2294>`__.
  * add automatic loading of ``namelist.txt``, which contains the parameter file 
    RAMSES uses to produce output `PR 2347 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2347>`__.
  * adds support for a nearest neighbor value field, accessible with 
    the ``add_nearest_neighbor_value_field`` function for particle fields. See 
    `PR 2301 <https://github.com/yt*project/yt/pull/2301>`__.
  * speed up mesh deposition (uses caching) `PR 2136 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/2136>`__.
  * speed up ghost zone generation.  `PR 2403 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/2403>`__.
  * ensure that a series dataset has kwargs passed down to data objects `PR 2366 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/2366>`__.
