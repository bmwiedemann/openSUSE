          - The log colorization code was trying to use 24-bit color even when
            the installed Term::ANSIColor couldn't support it.  This has been
            fixed by requiring Term::ANSIColor v5.  Thanks, Robert Rothenberg,

  6.004     2016-05-14 09:14:19-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  6.003     2016-04-24 19:23:46+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)
          - leading BOM (FEFF) is stripped on UTF-8 content

            non-comments in your source
  
  6.002     2016-04-23 17:50:26+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)

  6.001     2016-04-23 13:21:56+01:00 Europe/London
          [THIS RELEASE MIGHT BREAK YOUR BUILD]
          - Using a Dist::Zilla::Path like a Path::Class object now issues a
            deprecation warning ("this will be removed") once per call site.
  
  6.000     2016-04-23 11:35:28+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)
          [THIS RELEASE MIGHT BREAK YOUR BUILD]
          - Path::Class has been excised in favor of Path::Tiny, exposed as
            Dist::Zilla::Path; it will still respond to ->subdir and ->file, but
            only until Dist::Zilla v7 -- fix your plugins by then!
  
          - The --verbose switch to dzil is now strictly on/off.  To set
            verbosity on a per-plugin basis, use the -V switch.  Unfortunately,
            per-plugin verbosity seems to have been broken for some time, anyway.
  
          - The plugins [Prereq] and [AutoPrereq] and [BumpVersion] have been
            removed.  These were long deprecated.  (Don't confuse Prereq, for
            example, with the plural Prereqs, which is the correct plugin.)
  
          - [PkgVersion] now supports a use_package argument which will put the
            version in the package statement.  (Remember that this syntax was
            introduced in perl v5.12.0.)
  
          - Dist::Zilla now requires perl v5.14.0.  It will still happily build
            dists that run on whatever version of perl you like.

          - META.json is now emitted in ASCII (using \u... for non-ASCII

          - "dzil build --in ." no longer allows you to blow away your cwd

- buildrequire timezone to fix test suite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 24 08:50:45 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 5.013
         - META.json is now a UTF-8 file, rather than ASCII
         - document the use of filefinders in [PkgVersion], and remove
           filtering out of .t, .pod files; do skip non-text files, though
         - always load modules in "extra tests" like pod-coverage.t
         - PruneCruft also prunes ./fatlib
         - avoid being tricked by statements in __END__ section when looking for
           variable assignments
         - if "dzil install" fails due to exception, it is now propagated
         - provide a better error when terminal encoding can't be determined
 
 5.012     2014-01-15 09:58:00-05:00 America/New_York
         - when handling a multi-line abstract, fold the lines on whitespace;
           previously, the newlines had been left in, which caused downstream

         - ->VERSION is again defined in the tester forms of Builder and Minter

 5.010     2014-01-11 22:06:04-05:00 America/New_York
         - stop sharing a reference to cached PPI docs, which led to spooky
           action at a distance
         - PkgVersion no longer surrounds the new $VERSION assignment with a
           bare block
         - if there's a blank line after the package statement (and any number
           of comment-only lines), PkgVersion will use that for a $VERSION
           assignment, rather than insert a new line; this can be made mandatory
           with die_on_line_insertion
 
 5.009     2014-01-07 20:21:17-05:00 America/New_York
         - include time offset by default in NextRelease

           building inside the dist dir
           (in other words, no `perl Makefile.PL && make`)
         - Archive::Tar::Wrapper added as a recommended prereq
         - fix :ShareFiles (thanks, Christopher J. Madsen and Karen Etheridge)
         - new :AllFiles and :NoFiles filefinders (thanks, Karen Etheridge)
         - most files generated by dzil plugins now self-identify with comments

-------------------------------------------------------------------

       - add --keep-build-dir to "dzil test" and "dzil install"

       [THIS RELEASE MIGHT BREAK YOUR BUILD]

       - by default, NextRelease now adds a trial release marker on trial
         releases
       - dzil setup will not echo password during setup

       - typo fixes (thanks, David Steinbrunner)
       - all files now have content, encoded_content, and encoding attributes
       - the Encoding plugin and EncodingProvider role have been added to
         allow you to set the encoding on files; the default is UTF-8
       - config.ini is assumed to be in UTF-8
       - Data::Section sections are assumed to be UTF-8
       - the Term chrome should encode input and output

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- updated to 4.300039
         - tweak metafile generator to keep CPAN::Meta validator happy (thanks,
           David Golden)
 
 4.300038  2013-09-08 09:18:34 America/New_York
         - add horrible hack to avoid generating non-UTF-8 META.yml; seriously,
           don't look at the code!  Thanks, David Golden, whose code was simple
           and probably much, much saner, but didn't cover as many cases as rjbs
           wanted to cover.
 
 4.300037  2013-08-28 21:43:36 America/New_York

 4.300036  2013-08-25 21:41:21 America/New_York
         - read CPAN::Uploader config with CPAN::Uploader, to work with new
           trial releases supporting encrypted credential (thanks, Mike Doherty)
 
         - improve tester tests (thanks, Dave O'Neill!)
 
         - use Class::Load instead of Class::MOP
 
         - better error messages when a bundle can't be loaded by @Filter
 
         - make dynamic_config distmeta sticky; once one plugin sets it, it
           stays stuck
 
         - add a die_on_existing_version option to PkgVersion
 
         - switch (for now?) "dzil install" to use cpanm
 
         - PkgVersion won't rewrite file contents if nothing was changed
           (thanks, Mike Doherty!)

           check fails (thanks, Karen Etheridge!)
 
           add 'dzil listdeps --json', which lists all prerequisites broken up
           by phase and type, in readable JSON format (thanks, Karen Etheridge!)
 
           improve errors when there's not enough configuration and no global
           config file can be found (thanks, Dimitar Petrov)
 
           delay loading yet more libraries until needed (thanks, Olivier

 4.300029  2013-01-14 20:03:15 America/New_York
           allow :version directive in root section to require a given version

 4.300028  2012-10-19 10:50:42 America/New_York
           when picking modules to treat as "part of the dist," be more lax in
           understanding libraries under ./t:  ./t/lib/Foo.pm is now treated as
           providing t::lib::Foo, lib::Foo, and Foo
 
 4.300027  2012-10-16 21:07:06 America/New_York

           Alexei Znamensky!)
