- Update to 0.7.7:
  * Fixed a bug in Earley where running it from different threads 
    produced bad results
  * Improved error reporting when using LALR
  * Added 'edit_terminals' option, to allow programmatical manipulation
    of terminals, for example to support keywords in different languages.

- Drop no longer necessary disable_test.patch
- Replace %doc entry docs/ with docs/* to avoid extra sub-directory
- Added Suggests: python-Js2Py for optional runtime dependency
- Update to v0.7.3
  * Added a new tool called Serialize, that stores Lark's internal
    state as JSON. That will allow for integration with other languages.
  * Minor bugfix regarding line-counting and the \s regex
- from v0.7.2
  * Lark now allows you to specify the start symbol when calling
    Lark.parse() (requires pre-declaration of all possible start states,
    see the start option)
  * Negative priority now allowed in rules and terminals
  * Also includes many minor bugfixes, optimizations, and improvements
    to documentation

- version update to 0.7.1
    Lark can now serialize its parsers, resulting in simplified stand-alone code.
    Bugfix for v_args (Issue #350)
    Improvements and bugfixes for importing rules from grammar files
    Performance improvement for the reconstructor feature
    New Earley implementation with SPPF support
    Added support for importing rules between grammars. The import mechanism
      is namespace-aware.
    Added the maybe_placeholders option, which causes optionals of the form
     [expr] to return None when not matched, instead of just not appearing.
     (optionals of the form expr? maintain the previous behavior of not
     appearing unless matched)
    Plenty of bugfixes, better errors, and better docs
