  <title>OpenGL driver testing framework</title>
  <description>Piglit is a collection of automated tests for OpenGL and OpenCL
implementations.

The goal of Piglit is to help improve the quality of open source
OpenGL drivers by providing developers with means to perform
regression tests.

It contains the Glean tests, some tests adapted from Mesa, as well as
some specific regression tests for certain bugs. HTML summaries can
be generated, including the ability to compare different test runs.
