- Update to 1.0.1:
  - Fix failing tests when using netCDF4 4.9.0.
  - Add HSDS pytest-fixture, make tests work with h5ypd. By
    Aleksandar Jelenak.
  - Remove _NCProperties from existing file if writing invalid
    netcdf features. Warn users if .nc file extension is used
    writing invalid netcdf features. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Remove deprecated code (eg. remove deprecated code (eg.
    handling mode, chunking_heuristics, decode_vlen_strings),
    adapt LICENSE/AUTHOR.txt, prepare repository for release
    1.0. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Add documentation to h5netcdf, merging current available
    documentation available as .rst-files, in the repo-wiki
    and new API-docs into one document using sphinx-doc and
    sphinx-book-theme. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Directly return non-string Empty-type attributes as empty
    numpy-ndarray. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Add chunking_heuristic keyword and custom heuristic
    chunking_heuristic="h5netcdf" with better handling of
    unlimited dimensions. By Dion Häfner.
  - Return group name instead of full group path for legacy
    API. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Add endian keyword argument
    legacyapi.Dataset.createVariable. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Resize Dimensions when writing to variables (legacy API
    only), return padded arrays. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Allow 1D boolean indexers in legacy API. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Revert order tracking by default to avoid a bug in h5py
    (Closes Issue #136). By Mark Harfouche.
  - Implement Dimension-class. By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Return items from 0-dim and one-element 1-dim array
    attributes. Return multi-element attributes as lists. Return
    string attributes as Python strings decoded from their
    respective encoding (utf-8, ascii). By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Assign dimensions at creation time, instead of at sync/flush
    (file-close). By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Create/attach dimension scales on the fly, instead of at
    sync/flush (file-close). By Kai Mühlbauer.
  - Ensure order tracking is true for newly created netcdf4 files
    as required by the netcdf4 standard. This enables files
    created by h5netcdf to be appended to by netCDF4 library
    users (Closes Issue #128). By Mark Harfouche.

    files. By Ryan Grout.

    Mühlbauer.

    features. By Kai Mühlbauer.
