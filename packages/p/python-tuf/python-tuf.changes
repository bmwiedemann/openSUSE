- Update to 6.0:
  * ngclient: urllib3 is used as the HTTP library by default instead of
    requests.

    operating system certificate store instead of certifi.
  * ngclient: The updater can now initialize from embedded initial root
    metadata every time.
  * Test infrastructure has improved and should now be more usable externally.
- Remove duplicate BuildRequires on fdupes.
