  <title>Monospaced Fonts for Minority Languages of Russia</title>
  <description>PT Mono was developed for the special needs — for use in forms, tables,
work sheets etc. Equal widths of characters are very helpful in setting
complex documents, with such font you may easily calculate size of entry
fields, column widths in tables and so on. One of the most important
area of use is Web sites of “electronic governments“ where visitors have
to fill different request forms. Currently PT Mono consists of just one
Regular style.
 
The fonts beside standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic code
pages contain characters of all title languages of Russian Federation
that make them unique and very important tool of the modern digital
communications.
