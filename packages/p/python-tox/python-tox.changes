- update to 3.18.0
  * Add allowlist_externals alias to whitelist_externals (whitelist_externals is now deprecated). - by :user:`dajose`
  * Fix tests when the ``HOSTNAME`` environment variable is set, but empty string - by :user:`hroncok`
  * The long arguments ``--verbose`` and ``--quiet`` (rather than only their short forms, ``-v`` and ``-q``) are now accepted.
  * The ``ResultLog`` now prefers ``HOSTNAME`` environment variable value (if set) over the full qualified domain name of localhost.
    This makes it possible to disable an undesired DNS lookup,
    which happened on all ``tox`` invocations, including trivial ones * by :user:`hroncok`
  * Update packaging information for Flit.
  * Fixed the support for using ``{temp_dir}`` in ``tox.ini`` - by :user:`webknjaz`
  * Allow skipping the package and installation step when passing the ``--skip-pkg-install``.

  - When using --parallel with --result-json the test results are
    now included the same way as with serial runs
  - Turns out the output of the py -0p is not stable yet and
    varies depending on various edge cases. Instead now we read
    the interpreter values directly from registry via PEP-514
  - Adding TOX_PARALLEL_NO_SPINNER environment variable to
    disable the spinner in parallel mode for the purposes of
    clean output when using CI tools

- Update to 3.11.0:
  * --showconfig overhaul 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 23:22:47 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.0:
  * Please see changelog.rst

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 14:59:11 CET 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.8.1:
  - Bugfixes
    - The -eALL command line argument now expands the envlist key
      and includes all its environment. #1155
    - Isolated build environment dependency overrides were not
      taken in consideration (and such it inherited the deps from
      the testenv section)
    - --result-json puts the command into setup section instead
      of test (pre and post commands are now also correctly put
      into the commands section)
    - Set setup.cfg encoding to UTF-8 as it contains Unicode
      characters. #1212
    - Fix tox CI, better error reporting when locating via the py
      fails
    - In a posix shell, setting the PATH environment variable to
      an empty value is equivalent to not setting it at all;
      therefore we no longer if the user sets PYTHONPATH an empty
      string on python 3.4 or later
    - Fixed bug of children process calls logs clashing (log
      already exists)
    - Interpreter discovery and virtualenv creation process calls
      that failed will now print out on the screen their output
      (via the logfile we automatically save)
    - Using py2 and py3 with a specific basepython will no longer
      raise a warning unless the major version conflicts
    - Fix missing error for tox -e unknown when tox.ini declares
      envlist.
    - Resolve symlinks with toxworkdir.
    - Interrupting a tox call (e.g. via CTRL+C) now will ensure
      that spawn child processes (test calls, interpreter
      discovery, parallel sub-instances, provisioned hosts) are
      correctly stopped before exiting (via the pattern of
      INTERRUPT - 300 ms, TERMINATE - 200 ms, KILL signals)
    - Fix a ResourceWarning: unclosed file in Action
    - Fix deadlock when using --parallel and having environments
      with lots of output
    - Removed code that sometimes caused a difference in results
      between --parallel and -p when using posargs
  - Features
    - tox now auto-provisions itself if needed (see
      :ref:`auto-provision`). Plugins or minimum version of tox
      no longer need to be manually satisfied by the user,
      increasing their ease of use.
    - tox will inject the TOX_PARALLEL_ENV environment variable,
      set to the current running tox environment name, only when
      running in parallel mode.
    - Parallel children now save their output to a disk logfile
    - Parallel children now are added to --result-json
    - Display pattern and sys.platform with platform mismatch
    - Setting the environment variable TOX_REPORTER_TIMESTAMP to
      1 will enable showing for each output line its delta since
      the tox startup. This can be especially handy when
      debugging parallel runs.
  - Documentation
    - Add a poetry examples to packaging
- Switch build macros to PEP-518 compatible ones

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 12 11:46:09 CET 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.7.0:
  - Parallel mode added (alternative to detox which is being
    deprecated), for more details see `parallel_mode`
  - Added command line shortcut -s for
    --skip-missing-interpreters
  - Whitelisting of externals will be mandatory in tox 4: issue
    a deprecation warning as part of the already existing warning
  - Clarify explanations in examples and avoid unsupported end
    line comments
  - Set to PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md use relative instead of
    absolute URLs
  - if the packaging phase successfully builds a package set it
    as environment variable under TOX_PACKAGE (useful to make
    assertions on the built package itself, instead of just how
    it ends up after installation)
  - On windows, check sys.executable before others for
    interpreter version lookup. This matches what happens on
    non-windows.
  - Don't rewrite {posargs} substitution for absolute paths.
  - Correctly fail tox --notest when setup fails.
  - Link to related projects (Invoke and Nox) from the
    documentation
- Obsoletes python-detox.

Fri Oct 12 03:14:03 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * require filelock
  * CHANGELOG.rst ->changelog.rst, added CONTRIBUTORS CONTRIBUTING.rst to doc
  * add fdupes

- update to version 3.5.2:
  * Bugfixes
    + session packages are now put inside a numbered directory
      (instead of prefix numbering it, because pip fails when wheels
      are not named according to `PEP-491
      <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0491/#id9>`_, and prefix
      numbering messes with this) - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1042
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1042>`_)
  * Features
    + level three verbosity ("-vvv") show the packaging output - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1047
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1047>`_)

- changes from version 3.5.1:
  * Bugfixes
    + fix regression with "3.5.0": specifying "--installpkg" raises
      "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'basename'"
      (`#1042 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1042>`_)

- changes from version 3.5.0:
  * Bugfixes
    + intermittent failures with "--parallel--safe-build", instead of
      mangling with the file paths now uses a lock to make the package
      build operation thread safe and is now on by default
      ("--parallel--safe-build" is now deprecated) - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1026
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1026>`_)
  * Features
    + Added "temp_dir" folder configuration (defaults to
      "{toxworkdir}/.tmp") that contains tox temporary files. Package
      builds now create a hard link (if possible, otherwise copy -
      notably in case of Windows Python 2.7) to the built file, and
      feed that file downstream (e.g. for pip to install it). The hard
      link is removed at the end of the run (what it points though is
      kept inside "distdir"). This ensures that a tox session operates
      on the same package it built, even if a parallel tox run builds
      another version. Note "distdir" will contain only the last built
      package in such cases. - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1026
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1026>`_)
  * Documentation
    + document tox environment recreate rules (:ref:`recreate`) - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#93
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/93>`_)
    + document inside the "--help" how to disable colorized output via
      the "PY_COLORS" operating system environment variable - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#163
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/163>`_)
    + document all global tox flags and a more concise format to
      express default and type - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#683
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/683>`_)
    + document command line interface under the config section `cli
      <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html?highlight=cli#cli>`_
      - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#829
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/829>`_)

- changes from version 3.4.0:
  * Bugfixes
    + add "--exists-action w" to default pip flags to handle better
      VCS dependencies (`pip documentation on this
      <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip/#exists-action-option>`_)
      - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#503
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/503>`_)
    + instead of assuming the Python version from the base python name
      ask the interpreter to reveal the version for the
      "ignore_basepython_conflict" flag - by :user:`gaborbernat`
      (`#908 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/908>`_)
    + PEP-517 packaging fails with sdist already exists, fixed via
      ensuring the dist folder is empty before invoking the backend
      and `pypa/setuptools 1481
      <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/1481>`_ - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1003
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1003>`_)
  * Features
    + add "commands_pre" and "commands_post" that run before and after
      running the "commands" (setup runs always, commands only if
      setup suceeds, teardown always - all run until the first failing
      command) - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#167
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/167>`_)
    + "pyproject.toml" config support initially by just inline the
      tox.ini under "tool.tox.legacy_tox_ini" key; config source
      priority order is "pyproject.toml", "tox.ini" and then
      "setup.cfg" - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#814
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/814>`_)
    + use the os environment variable "TOX_SKIP_ENV" to filter out tox
      environment names from the run list (set by "envlist") - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#824
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/824>`_)
    + always set "PIP_USER=0" (do not install into the user site
      package, but inside the virtual environment created) and
      "PIP_NO_DEPS=0" (installing without dependencies can cause
      broken package installations) inside tox - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#838
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/838>`_)
    + tox will inject some environment variables that to indicate a
      command is running within tox: "TOX_WORK_DIR" env var is set to
      the tox work directory, "TOX_ENV_NAME" is set to the current
      running tox environment name, "TOX_ENV_DIR" is set to the
      current tox environments working dir - by :user:`gaborbernat`
      (`#847 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/847>`_)
    + While running tox invokes various commands (such as building the
      package, pip installing dependencies and so on), these were
      printed in case they failed as Python arrays. Changed the
      representation to a shell command, allowing the users to quickly
      replicate/debug the failure on their own - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#851
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/851>`_)
    + skip missing interpreters value from the config file can now be
      overridden via the "--skip-missing-interpreters" cli flag - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#903
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/903>`_)
    + keep additional environments config order when listing them - by
      :user:`gaborbernat` (`#921
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/921>`_)
    + allow injecting config value inside the ini file dependent of
      the fact that we're connected to an interactive shell or not -
      by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#947
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/947>`_)
    + do not build sdist if skip install is specified for the envs to
      be run - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#974
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/974>`_)
    + when verbosity level increases above two start passing through
      verbosity flags to pip - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#982
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/982>`_)
    + when discovering the interpreter to use check if the tox host
      Python matches and use that if so - by :user:`gaborbernat`
      (`#994 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/994>`_)
    + "-vv" will print out why a virtual environment is re-created
      whenever this operation is triggered - by :user:`gaborbernat`
      (`#1004 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1004>`_)
  * Documentation
    + clarify that "python" and "pip" refer to the virtual
      environments executable - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#305
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/305>`_)
    + add Sphinx and mkdocs example of generating documentation via
      tox - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#374
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/374>`_)
    + specify that "setup.cfg" tox configuration needs to be inside
      the "tox:tox" namespace - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#545
      <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/545>`_)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 11 16:55:01 UTC 2018 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 3.3.0:
  - fix ``TOX_LIMITED_SHEBANG`` when running under python3 - by :user:`asottile` (`#931 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/931>`_)
  - `PEP-517 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/>`_ source distribution support (create a
    ``.package`` virtual environment to perform build operations inside) by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#573 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/573>`_)
  - `flit <https://flit.readthedocs.io>`_ support via implementing ``PEP-517`` by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#820 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/820>`_)
  - packaging now is exposed as a hook via ``tox_package(session, venv)`` - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#951 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/951>`_)
  - Updated the VSTS build YAML to use the latest jobs and pools syntax - by :user:`davidstaheli` (`#955 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/955>`_)
  - ``--parallel--safe-build`` no longer cleans up its folders (``distdir``, ``distshare``, ``log``). - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#849 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/849>`_)
  - Switch pip invocations to use the module ``-m pip`` instead of direct invocation. This could help
    avoid some of the shebang limitations.  - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#935 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/935>`_)
  - Ability to specify package requirements for the tox run via the ``tox.ini`` (``tox`` section under key ``requires`` - PEP-508 style): can be used to specify both plugin requirements or build dependencies. - by :user
  :`gaborbernat` (`#783 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/783>`_)
  - Allow to run multiple tox instances in parallel by providing the
    ``--parallel--safe-build`` flag. - by :user:`gaborbernat` (`#849 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/849>`_)
  - A caching issue that caused the ``develop-inst-nodeps`` action, which
    reinstalls the package under test, to always run has been resolved. The
    ``develop-inst-noop`` action, which, as the name suggests, is a no-op, will now
    run unless there are changes to ``setup.py`` or ``setup.cfg`` files that have
    not been reflected - by @stephenfin (`#909 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/909>`_)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 16:58:52 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 2.3.1:
  * fix issue294: re-allow cross-section substitution for setenv.
  * DEPRECATE use of "indexservers" in tox.ini.  It complicates
    the internal code and it is recommended to rather use the
    devpi system for managing indexes for pip.
  * fix issue285: make setenv processing fully lazy to fix regressions
    of tox-2.2.X and so that we can now have testenv attributes like
    "basepython" depend on environment variables that are set in
    a setenv section. Thanks Nelfin for some tests and initial
    work on a PR.
  * allow "#" in commands.  This is slightly incompatible with commands
    sections that used a comment after a "\" line continuation.
    Thanks David Stanek for the PR.
  * fix issue289: fix build_sphinx target, thanks Barry Warsaw.
  * fix issue252: allow environment names with special characters.
    Thanks Julien Castets for initial PR and patience.
  * introduce experimental tox_testenv_create(venv, action) and
    tox_testenv_install_deps(venv, action) hooks to allow
    plugins to do additional work on creation or installing
    deps.  These hooks are experimental mainly because of
    the involved "venv" and session objects whose current public
    API is not fully guranteed.
  * internal: push some optional object creation into tests because
    tox core doesn't need it.
  * fix bug where {envdir} substitution could not be used in setenv
    if that env value is then used in {basepython}. Thanks Florian Bruhin.
  * fix issue265 and add LD_LIBRARY_PATH to passenv on linux by default
    because otherwise the python interpreter might not start up in
    certain configurations (redhat software collections).  Thanks David Riddle.
  * fix issue246: fix regression in config parsing by reordering
    such that {envbindir} can be used again in tox.ini. Thanks Olli Walsh.
  * fix issue99: the {env:...} substitution now properly uses environment
    settings from the ``setenv`` section. Thanks Itxaka Serrano.
  * fix issue281: make --force-deps work when urls are present in
    dependency configs.  Thanks Glyph Lefkowitz for reporting.
  * fix issue174: add new ``ignore_outcome`` testenv attribute which
    can be set to True in which case it will produce a warning instead
    of an error on a failed testenv command outcome.
    Thanks Rebecka Gulliksson for the PR.
  * fix issue280: properly skip missing interpreter if
    {envsitepackagesdir} is present in commands. Thanks BB:ceridwenv
- Refresh tox-disable-env-tests.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 13:18:44 UTC 2015 - rhafer@suse.com

- (Build)Require python-pluggy
- refreshed tox-disable-env-tests.patch
- Update to 2.1.1: 
  * fix platform skipping for detox
  * report skipped platforms as skips in the summary
- additional changes from version 2.1.0
  * fix issue258, fix issue248, fix issue253: for non-test commands 
    (installation, venv creation) we pass in the full invocation environment.
  * remove experimental --set-home option which was hardly used and
    hackily implemented (if people want home-directory isolation we should
    figure out a better way to do it, possibly through a plugin)
  * fix issue259: passenv is now a line-list which allows to intersperse
    comments.  Thanks stefano-m.
  * allow envlist to be a multi-line list, to intersperse comments
    and have long envlist settings split more naturally.  Thanks Andre Caron.
  * introduce a TOX_TESTENV_PASSENV setting which is honored
    when constructing the set of environment variables for test environments.
    Thanks Marc Abramowitz for pushing in this direction.
- additional changes from version 2.0.2
  * fix issue247: tox now passes the LANG variable from the tox invocation 
    environment to the test environment by default.
  * add SYSTEMDRIVE into default passenv on windows to allow pip6 to work.
    Thanks Michael Krause.
- additional changes from version 2.0.1
  * fix wheel packaging to properly require argparse on py26.
- additional changes from version 2.0.0
  * (new) introduce environment variable isolation:
    tox now only passes the PATH and PIP_INDEX_URL variable from the tox
    invocation environment to the test environment and on Windows 
    also ``SYSTEMROOT``, ``PATHEXT``, ``TEMP`` and ``TMP`` whereas
    on unix additionally ``TMPDIR`` is passed.  If you need to pass 
    through further environment variables you can use the new ``passenv`` setting,
    a space-separated list of environment variable names.  Each name
    can make use of fnmatch-style glob patterns.  All environment
    variables which exist in the tox-invocation environment will be copied
    to the test environment.
  * a new ``--help-ini`` option shows all possible testenv settings and
    their defaults.
  * (new) introduce a way to specify on which platform a testenvironment is to
    execute: the new per-venv "platform" setting allows to specify 
    a regular expression which is matched against sys.platform.
    If platform is set and doesn't match the platform spec in the test 
    environment the test environment is ignored, no setup or tests are attempted.
  * (new) add per-venv "ignore_errors" setting, which defaults to False.
     If ``True``, a non-zero exit code from one command will be ignored and
     further commands will be executed (which was the default behavior in tox <
     2.0).  If ``False`` (the default), then a non-zero exit code from one command
     will abort execution of commands for that environment.
  * show and store in json the version dependency information for each venv
  * remove the long-deprecated "distribute" option as it has no effect these days.
  * fix issue233: avoid hanging with tox-setuptools integration example. Thanks simonb.
  * fix issue120: allow substitution for the commands section.  Thanks
    Volodymyr Vitvitski.
  * fix issue235: fix AttributeError with --installpkg.  Thanks
    Volodymyr Vitvitski.
  * tox has now somewhat pep8 clean code, thanks to Volodymyr Vitvitski.
  * fix issue240: allow to specify empty argument list without it being
    rewritten to ".".  Thanks Daniel Hahler.
  * introduce experimental (not much documented yet) plugin system
    based on pytest's externalized "pluggy" system.
    See tox/hookspecs.py for the current hooks.
  * introduce parser.add_testenv_attribute() to register an ini-variable
    for testenv sections.  Can be used from plugins through the 
    tox_add_option hook.
  * rename internal files -- tox offers no external API except for the
    experimental plugin hooks, use tox internals at your own risk.
  * DEPRECATE distshare in documentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  2 18:55:15 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 1.9.2:
  * backout ability that --force-deps substitutes name/versions in
    requirement files due to various issues. This fixes issue228,
    fixes issue230, fixes issue231 which popped up with 1.9.1.
- additional changes from version 1.9.1:
  * use a file instead of a pipe for command output in
    "--result-json". Fixes some termination issues with python2.6.
  * allow --force-deps to override dependencies in "-r"
    requirements files.  Thanks Sontek for the PR.
  * fix issue227: use "-m virtualenv" instead of "-mvirtualenv" to
    make it work with pyrun.  Thanks Marc-Andre Lemburg.
- additional changes from version 1.9.0:
  * fix issue193: Remove ``--pre`` from the default
    ``install_command``; by default tox will now only install final
    releases from PyPI for unpinned dependencies. Use ``pip_pre =
    true`` in a testenv or the ``--pre`` command-line option to
    restore the previous behavior.
  * fix issue199: fill resultlog structure ahead of virtualenv
    creation
  * refine determination if we run from Jenkins, thanks Borge Lanes.
  * echo output to stdout when ``--report-json`` is used
  * fix issue11: add a ``skip_install`` per-testenv setting which
    prevents the installation of a package. Thanks Julian Krause.
  * fix issue124: ignore command exit codes; when a command has a
    "-" prefix, tox will ignore the exit code of that command
  * fix issue198: fix broken envlist settings, e.g.
    {py26,py27}{-lint,}
  * fix issue191: lessen factor-use checks
- additional changes from version 1.8.1:
  * fix issue190: allow setenv to be empty.
  * allow escaping curly braces with "\".  Thanks Marc Abramowitz
    for the PR.
  * allow "." names in environment names such that "py27-django1.7"
    is a valid environment name.  Thanks Alex Gaynor and Alex
    Schepanovski.
  * report subprocess exit code when execution fails.  Thanks
    Marius Gedminas.
- additional changes from version 1.8.0:
  * new multi-dimensional configuration support.  Many thanks to
    Alexander Schepanovski for the complete PR with docs. And to
    Mike Bayer and others for testing and feedback.
  * fix issue148: remove "__PYVENV_LAUNCHER__" from os.environ when
    starting subprocesses. Thanks Steven Myint.
  * fix issue152: set VIRTUAL_ENV when running test commands,
    thanks Florian Ludwig.
  * better report if we can't get version_info from an interpreter
    executable. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.

- Update to version 1.7.2:
  * fix issue150: parse {posargs} more like we used to do it pre
    1.7.0.
  * fix issue59: add a config variable skip-missing-interpreters as
    well as command line option --skip-missing-interpreters
  * fix issue164: better traceback info in case of failing test commands
  * support optional env variable substitution.
  * limit python hashseed to 1024 on Windows to prevent possible
    memory errors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  3 11:13:09 UTC 2014 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 1.7.1:
  - fix issue162: don't list python 2.5 as compatibiliy/supported
  - fix issue158 and fix issue155: windows/virtualenv properly works now:
    call virtualenv through "python -m virtualenv" with the same 
    interpreter which invoked tox.  Thanks Chris Withers, Ionel Maries Cristian.
- Add tox-disable-env-tests.patch: Disable tests that need network-access
  and that depend on /usr/bin/tox (which is only added via u-a in %post)
- Remove tox-disable-network-accessing-tests.patch: Obsoleted by the above patch
- Implement update-alternatives to allow parallel installation with python3-tox

Thu Sep  5 07:29:06 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  + fix issue119: {envsitepackagesdir} is now correctly computed and has
    a better test to prevent regression.
  + fix issue116: make 1.6 introduced behaviour of changing to a 
    per-env HOME directory during install activities dependent 
    on "--set-home" for now.  Should re-establish the old behaviour
    when no option is given.
  + fix issue118: correctly have two tests use realpath(). Thanks Barry
    Warsaw.
  + fix test runs on environments without a home directory
    (in this case we use toxinidir as the homedir)
  + fix issue117: python2.5 fix: don't use ``--insecure`` option because 
    its very existence depends on presence of "ssl".  If you
    want to support python2.5/pip1.3.1 based test environments you need 
    to install ssl and/or use PIP_INSECURE=1 through ``setenv``. section.
  + fix issue102: change to {toxinidir} when installing dependencies.
    this allows to use relative path like in "-rrequirements.txt".
- Changes from version 1.6.0:
  + fix issue35: add new EXPERIMENTAL "install_command" testenv-option to
    configure the installation command with options for dep/pkg install.
    Thanks Carl Meyer for the PR and docs.
  + fix issue91: python2.5 support by vendoring the virtualenv-1.9.1 
    script and forcing pip<1.4. Also the default [py25] environment 
    modifies the default installer_command (new config option)
    to use pip without the "--pre" option which was introduced 
    with pip-1.4 and is now required if you want to install non-stable 
    releases.  (tox defaults to install with "--pre" everywhere).
  + during installation of dependencies HOME is now set to a pseudo
    location ({envtmpdir}/pseudo-home).  If an index url was specified
    a .pydistutils.cfg file will be written with an index_url setting
    so that packages defining ``setup_requires`` dependencies will not
    silently use your HOME-directory settings or https://pypi.python.org.
  + fix issue1: empty setup files are properly detected, thanks Anthon van
    der Neuth
  + remove toxbootstrap.py for now because it is broken.
  + fix issue109 and fix issue111: multiple "-e" options are now combined
    (previously the last one would win). Thanks Anthon van der Neut.
  + add --result-json option to write out detailed per-venv information
    into a json report file to be used by upstream tools.
  + add new config options ``usedevelop`` and ``skipsdist`` as well as a
    command line option ``--develop`` to install the package-under-test in develop mode.
    thanks Monty Tailor for the PR.
  + always unset PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTE because newer setuptools doesn't like it
  + if a HOMEDIR cannot be determined, use the toxinidir.
  + refactor interpreter information detection to live in new
    tox/interpreters.py file, tests in tests/test_interpreters.py.
- Add tox-disable-network-accessing-tests.patch: Disable tests that insist on
  downloading dependencies over network

    was considered a comment
  + tweak and improve reporting
  + refactor reporting and virtualenv manipulation 
    to be more accessible from 3rd party tools
  + support value substitution from other sections
    with the {[section]key} syntax

  + add python3.3 to the default env list, so early adopters can test
  + drop python2.4 support (you can still have your tests run on
    python-2.4, just tox itself requires 2.5 or higher.
