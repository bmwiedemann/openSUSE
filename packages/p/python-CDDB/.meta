  <title>Python CDDB module</title>
  <description>The dynamic duo of CDDB.py and DiscID.py, along with their side-kick C
module cdrommodule.so, provide an easy way for Python programs to
fetch information on audio CDs from CDDB (http://www.cddb.com/) -- a
very large online database of track listings and other information on
audio CDs. UNIX platforms and Windows are both supported.
