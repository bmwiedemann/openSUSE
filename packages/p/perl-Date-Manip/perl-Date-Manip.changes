    -  Change warn to carp
           All warnings are now issued with the carp command rather than warn.
           Requested in GitHup pull request #18, but that request was not used
           because it only changed the uses in the Date::Manip::Date module.
    -  Bug fixes
           Fixed a bug where the next/prev Date::Manip::Recur methods gave
           incorrect results when there are no dates that match the criteria.

    -  Removed travis file from the tarball
          The tarball had a .travis.yml file in it that wasn't in the MANIFEST
          file. Since the MANIFEST file is automatically generated by the perl
          mkmanifest tool, since it didn't see the .travis.yml file, I have
          excluded it from the tarball. Reported by Mohammad S Anwar on GitHub

    -  Fixed math on non-64-bit architectures
          Much of the math in Date::Manip::Base is in a 'use integer' section.
          This math can overflow in some cases in non-64-bit architectures.
          Fixed the cases where this would reasonably occur. Reported by
          Daniel Albers (GitHub #22). Also reported and tested in RT 126052.
  
    -  Bug in normalizing estimated business deltas
          While working on the non-64-bit issue, it uncovered a bug where
          normalizing estimated business deltas was wrong. It had never been
          reported, and it was only off by a couple seconds in some rare
          situations.
- do not exclude 32-bit platforms from build, the issue is solved
  via RT bug 126052 [bsc#1086297]

    -  Fixed recurrence bug
          The fix in the previous version for a rare recurrence problem broke
          another recurrence form. It is now corrected. Michael Schout (GitHub
          #20)
  
    -  Fixed version problem
          The wrong version was included in two files for some reason. This is
          fixed.
  
    -  Documentation fixes
          Fixed a grammatical error reported by Xavier Guimard (GitHub #19).
  
  6.71  2018-06-01
    -  Fixed an extremely rare problem with recurrences
          It is possible to specify a recurrence that never produces a valid
          date. In these cases, looking for dates went into an infinite loop.
          The MaxRecurAttempts config variable was added which will stop that
          from happening. If no occurrence was found, an error condition will
          be set. Dean Hamstead (RT 123708)
  
    -  Changes file supported
          It was requested that I include a valid Changes file. I wrote a
          simple script to convert the Change6.pod file into a valid Change
          file. The Changes6.pod file is still the canonical source of this
          information! Requested by H. Merijn Brand
  
    -  Fix for timezone determination
          On MacOS X High Sierra, some of the timezone files were symlinks,
          but not properly followed. This was fixed by Stu Tomlinson (GitHub
          #15).

Time zone fixes:
Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2011b).
Fixed a bug where the gmtoff method of getting the local timezone was broken.
Fixed the 'env' method of determining the local time zone to allow the
value to be an offset of seconds since UTC.  This allows the VMS
SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL variable to work correctly.  Martin Zinser.
Removed the SYS$TIMEZONE_RULE method from VMS since the value stored there
is not the name of a timezone (it's a rule in a non-standard format).  Based
on discussion with Martin Zinser.

Language fixes:
The module will now die if a language module cannot be loaded (most
likely due to a YAML::Syck issue).  Based on discussion with Martin Zinser.

Documentation fixes:
Added a sample config file document.  Based on discussion with Rich Duzenbury.
