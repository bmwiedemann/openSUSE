  <title>Automated accessor generation</title>
  <description>This module automatically generates accessor/mutators for your class. Most of
the time, writing accessors is an exercise in cutting and pasting. 

If you make your module a subclass of Class::Accessor and declare your accessor
fields with mk_accessors() then you'll find yourself with a set of
automatically generated accessors which can even be customized!</description>
