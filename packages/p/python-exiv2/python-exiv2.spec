%description
python3-exiv2 is a Python 3 binding to exiv2, the C++ library for manipulation
of EXIF, IPTC and XMP image metadata. It is a python 3 module that allows your
scripts to read and write metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, thumbnails) embedded in
image files (JPEG, TIFF, ...).

It is designed as a high-level interface to the functionalities offered by
libexiv2. Using pythonâ€™s built-in data types and standard modules, it provides
easy manipulation of image metadata.
