%description
hatch_fancy_pypi_readme is a Hatch metadata plugin for everyone who cares about
the first impression of their project's PyPI landing page. It allows you to
define your PyPI project description in terms of concatenated fragments that
are based on static strings, files, and most importantly: parts of files
defined using cut-off points or regular expressions.

Once you've assembled your readme, you can additionally run regular
expression-based substitutions over it. For instance to make relative links
absolute or to linkify users and issue numbers in your changelog.

Do you want your PyPI readme to be the project readme, but without badges,
followed by the license file, and the changelog section for only the last
release? You've come to the right place!
