<package name="perl-Test-Unit-Lite" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Unit testing without external dependencies</title>
  <description>This framework provides lighter version of Test::Unit framework. It implements some of the Test::Unit classes and methods needed to run test units. The Test::Unit::Lite tries to be compatible with public API of Test::Unit. It doesn't implement all classes and methods at 100% and only those necessary to run tests are available.

The Test::Unit::Lite can be distributed as a part of package distribution, so the package can be distributed without dependency on modules outside standard Perl distribution. The Test::Unit::Lite is provided as a single file.</description>
