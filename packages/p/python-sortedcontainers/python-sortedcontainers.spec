%description
SortedContainers is an Apache2 licensed containers library, written in
pure-Python, and fast as C-extensions.

Python's standard library is great until you need a sorted container type. Many
will attest that you can get really far without one, but the moment you **really
need** a sorted list, dict, or set, you're faced with a dozen different
implementations, most using C-extensions without great documentation and
benchmarking.

SortedContainers takes all of the work out of Python sorted types - making your
deployment and use of Python easy. There's no need to install a C compiler or
pre-build and distribute custom extensions. Performance is a feature and testing
has 100% coverage with unit tests and hours of stress.
