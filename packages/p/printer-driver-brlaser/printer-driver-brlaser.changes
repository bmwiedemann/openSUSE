Thu Jan 28 15:24:15 CET 2016 - jsmeix@suse.de

- Make it build for SLE12 with traditional CUPS 1.5.4 to ensure
  it works on SLE12 both with CUPS 1.7.5 and CUPS 1.5.4 because
  for SLE12 by default CUPS 1.7.5 is provided and alternatively
  CUPS 1.5.4 is provided in the "legacy" module, cf.
  https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86_64/SUSE-SLES/12/
- Prepare building it for SLE11 via "BuildRequires cupsddk"
  because on SLE11 with its CUPS 1.3.9 there is the separated
  package cupsddk (otherwise use cups-ddk a sub-package of cups).
- For SLE11 redefine _libexecdir to be "/usr/lib" in any case
  because on SLE11 x86_64 it evaluates to "/usr/lib64" which
  is wrong in particular for CUPS filters and backends, cf.
  https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=575544#c2
- Prepare building it for SLE10 (cf. "SLE10" spec file comments).
- Have Source0 as .tar.gz (instead .tar.xz) because .tar.gz
  "just works" on SLE11 and SLE10 and the .tar.gz is only 2K
  bigger than the .tar.xz (25K versus 23K as of this writing).
- Regardless that it is prepared for building on SLE11 and SLE10
  (see gutenprint.spec and hplip.spec how to do that)
  currently it cannot build for SLE11 and SLE10
  because "autoreconf -fi" fails with
  "error: Autoconf version 2.68 or higher is required".
  On SLE11 there is autoconf-2.63 and on SLE10 there is
  autoconf-2.59 so that currently building for SLE11 and SLE10
  is still disabled.
