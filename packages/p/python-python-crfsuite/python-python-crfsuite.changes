  * make it easier for distributions to have a reproducible build
    (thanks @bmwiedemann)
  * Python 3.7 support (thanks @fgregg, @danmacnaughtan and
    @fuhrysteve).
  * Python 3.3 support is dropped.
  * new Tagger.open_inmemory method which allows to load tagger
    data without having a file on-disk (thanks @lucywang000).
  * license information is added to setup.py (thanks @nils-
    werner).
  * Python 3.6 wheels for Windows (thanks @fgregg).
  * Packaging fix (thanks @fgregg).
  * Fixed compatibility with Python 3.5+ on Windows (thanks
    @fgregg);
  * CRFSuite C++ library is updated to latest version, this fixes
    several memory leaks and improves performance (thanks
    @fgregg);
  * extension is rebuilt with Cython 0.26.1.
  * binary wheels for OS X and Linux (thanks @jeancochrane).
  * Repository is moved to https://github.com/scrapinghub/python-
    crfsuite;
  * We're now providing Windows wheels for Python 2.7, 3.3. and
    3.4.
  * Python 2.6 support is dropped;
  * CRFSuite C++ library is updated to a more recent commit;
  * improved Windows support (thanks @fgregg);
  * fixed building with gcc < 5.0.0 (thanks @kantan2015);
  * extension is rebuilt with Cython 0.25.1; this improves PyPy
    compatibility (but we're not quite there yet).
  * docs: trainer.logparser example is added to the notebook
    (thanks @samgalen).
  * the wrapper is rebuilt with Cython 0.23.4;
  * declared Python 3.5 compatibility;
  * fixed an issue with feature names ending with white spaces.
  * fix build on Windows. (thanks @fgregg)
  * memory leak is fixed by updating the bundled CRFsuite C++
    library;
  * the wrapper is rebuilt with Cython 0.21.2.
  * fix packaging issues with 0.8 release.
  * :class:`~ItemSequence` wrapper is added;
  * tox tests are fixed.
  * More data formats for xseq: {"prefix": {feature_dict}} and
    {"key": set(["key1",...])} feature dicts are now accepted by
    :class:`pycrfsuite.Trainer` and :class:`pycrfsuite.Tagger`;
  * feature separator changed from "=" to ":" (it looks better in
    case of multi-level features);
  * small doc and README fixes.
  * Switch to setuptools;
  * wheels are uploaded to pypi for faster installation.
  * More data formats for xseq: {"key": "value"} and {"key":
    bool_value} feature dicts are now accepted by
    :class:`pycrfsuite.Trainer` and :class:`pycrfsuite.Tagger`.
  * Exceptions in logging message handlers are now propagated and
    raised. This allows, for example, to stop training earlier by
    pressing Ctrl-C.
  * It is now possible to customize :class:`pycrfsuite.Trainer`
    logging more easily by overriding the following methods:
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.on_start`,
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.on_featgen_progress`,
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.on_featgen_end`,
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.on_prepared`,
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.on_prepare_error`,
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.on_iteration`,
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.on_optimization_end`
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.on_end`. The feature is implemented
    by parsing CRFsuite log. There is
    :class:`pycrfsuite.BaseTrainer` that is not doing this.
  * :meth:`pycrfsuite.Tagger.info()` is fixed.
  * (backwards-incompatible) training parameters are now passed
    using params argument of  :class:`pycrfsuite.Trainer`
    constructor instead of **kwargs;
  * (backwards-incompatible) logging support is dropped;
  * verbose argument for :class:`pycrfsuite.Trainer` constructor;
  * :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.get_params` and
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.set_params` for getting/setting
    multiple training parameters at once;
  * string handling in Python 3.x is fixed by rebuilding the
    wrapper with Cython 0.21dev;
  * algorithm names are normalized to support names used by
    crfsuite console utility and documented in crfsuite manual;
  * type conversion for training parameters is fixed:
    feature.minfreq now works, and boolean arguments become
    boolean.
  * Trainer.append_stringslists and Trainer.append_dicts methods
    are replaced with a single :meth:`pycrfsuite.Trainer.append`
    method;
  * Tagger.set_stringlists and Tagger.set_dicts methods are
    removed in favor of :meth:`pycrfsuite.Tagger.set` method;
  * feature_format arguments in :class:`pycrfsuite.Tagger`
    methods and constructor are dropped.
  * :meth:`pycrfsuite.Tagger.dump()` and
    :meth:`pycrfsuite.Tagger.info()` methods for model debugging;
  * a memory leak in Trainer is fixed (trainer instances were
    never garbage collected);
  * documentation and testing improvements.
