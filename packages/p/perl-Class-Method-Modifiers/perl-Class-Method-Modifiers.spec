%description
Method modifiers are a convenient feature from the CLOS (Common Lisp Object
System) world.

In its most basic form, a method modifier is just a method that calls
'$self->SUPER::foo(@_)'. I for one have trouble remembering that exact
invocation, so my classes seldom re-dispatch to their base classes. Very
bad!

'Class::Method::Modifiers' provides three modifiers: 'before', 'around',
and 'after'. 'before' and 'after' are run just before and after the method
they modify, but can not really affect that original method. 'around' is
run in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call that
original method. See the MODIFIERS section for more details on how the
particular modifiers work.

One clear benefit of using 'Class::Method::Modifiers' is that you can
define multiple modifiers in a single namespace. These separate modifiers
don't need to know about each other. This makes top-down design easy. Have
a base class that provides the skeleton methods of each operation, and have
plugins modify those methods to flesh out the specifics.

Parent classes need not know about 'Class::Method::Modifiers'. This means
you should be able to modify methods in _any_ subclass. See
Term::VT102::ZeroBased for an example of subclassing with
'Class::Method::Modifiers'.

In short, 'Class::Method::Modifiers' solves the problem of making sure you
call '$self->SUPER::foo(@_)', and provides a cleaner interface for it.

As of version 1.00, 'Class::Method::Modifiers' is faster in some cases than
Moose. See _benchmark/method_modifiers.pl_ in the Moose distribution.

'Class::Method::Modifiers' also provides an additional "modifier" type,
'fresh'; see below.
