    modules to traitsui.qt.*. As with Pyface 8.0 we include a
    backwards-compatibility mode which allows importing from the
    'qt4' namespace via:
    - setting the ETS toolkit to "qt4"
    - setting the ETS_QT4_IMPORTS environment variable
    - manually adding appropriate finders to sys.meta_path
    - Be strict about 'handler.init()' return values
    - Move 'traitsui.qt4.' to 'traitsui.qt.'

    PySide6 version to < 6.4.0 due to incompatibilities with the
    new enum system, which should improve the install experience.
    - Fix RangeTextEditor handling of None for low/high
    - Pin PySide6 to < 6.4

Sun Jan 16 15:11:23 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.2.1
  * Explicitly require traits 6.2 and pyface 7.3 (#1666, #1668)
- Release 7.2.0
  * TraitsUI 7.2.0 is a minor release which includes numerous bug
    fixes, documentation improvements, code maintenance changes,
    and enhancements.
  * The migration from on_trait_change to observe is underway. As a
    result, TraitsUI now requires Traits >= 6.2.
  * New display-only VideoEditor (currently only on Qt backend).
    Exapnsion of features for the new UITester including the
    ability to inspect UI object visibility / enabledness. Also
    documentation for testing has been updated.
  * Notes on upgrading: This release of TraitsUI now depends on
    Traits 6.2+ and pyface 7.2+. Also, deprecated code / modules
    have been removed. Namely, the :mod:traitsui.image
    <traitsui.image> module which was moved to pyface.image,
    editors_gen modules, Editor and EditorFactory factory methods
    on Toolkit objects, and more. For a complete list, see PRs in
    the "Removals" section. These were all generally unused /
    deprecated for sometime. Also, importing directly from
    traitsui.editors has been deprecated. Please update imports to
    import directly from :mod:traitsui.api or
    :mod:traitsui.editors.api.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 23 19:50:25 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.1.1
  * Fix scrollable trait of a Group not being implemented on Qt
    (#1406)
  * Fix icon button's clickable area too small for FileEditor and
    RangeEditor on Qt and OSX (#1383)
  * Fix missing minimize and maximize buttons for dialogs opened
    on certain Linux platforms (#1409)
- Release 7.1.0
  Highlights of this release
  * A new traitsui.testing.api module has been introduced for
    testing GUI applications built using TraitsUI. See Testing
    TraitsUI Applications for an introduction. Builtin support has
    been added for testing several TraitsUI editors. More support
    will be added in the future.
  * On OSX and Qt, there have been reports of missing UI view
    updates after a push button is clicked. While this is
    suspected to be a Qt issue, changes have been made to
    ButtonEditor, SetEditor and ImageEnumEditor to mitigate the
    situation.
  * The internal logic for disposing an instance traitsui.ui.UI is
    changed as an attempt to resolve AttributeError that occurs
    while a nested UI is removed.
  Notes on upgrading
  * On the issue about Qt button not causing views to update on
    OSX, projects that have been working around the issue by
    adding GUI().process_events() (or similar) in their
    applications may now try to remove those workarounds. However,
    the change that mitigates the issue in a production
    environment has implications for tests: The button's click
    slot is no longer invoked immediately but always invoked by
    the Qt GUI event loop. Tests that used to call the Qt button
    click method directly and rely on the event to happen
    immediately will now need to update their tests to ensure that
    the click slot is processed by the Qt GUI event loop in the
    same order as before. Consider using the new testing library
    which automatically runs the GUI event loop after each
    interaction (e.g. mouse click).
  Future removals
  * traitsui.image has been moved to pyface.image more than 3
    years ago and has since been deprecated. Previously it was
    scheduled to be removed in TraitsUI 6.0. This planned removal
    is now deferred to TraitsUI 7.2.
