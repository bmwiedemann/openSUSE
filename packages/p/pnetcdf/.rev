    <comment>- Update to version 1.12.2:
  * Updated utility program
    * ncvalidator now reports the name of variable that violates the NetCDF
      limitation on large variables for CDF-2 files
    * add corrupted file bad_large_fixed_var.nc2 that contains one large
      fixed-size variables that is not defined last
    * add corrupted file bad_large_rec_2_vars.nc2 that contains 2 large record
      variables
    * add corrupted file bad_large_rec_var.nc2 that contains 1 large record
      variable that is not defined last
    * add URLs of NetCDF limitations on large variables for CDF-1 and 2 file
      formats
  * Other updates:
    * When calling ncmpi_create() with NC_CLOBBER flag, PnetCDF now calls
      access() to check whether file exists first. If the file does not exist,
      successive calls to truncate() or unlink() can be skipped.
    * Improve detection of HDF5 signature. The HDF5 signature is located at the
      beginning of the HDF5 superblock, but the location of HDF5 superblock may
      not be at the beginning of the file. It is located at byte offset 0, byte
      offset 512, and at successive locations in the file, each a multiple of two
      of the previous location; in other words, at these byte offsets: 0, 512,
      1024, 2048, and so on.
  * Bug fixes
    * Fix NC_CLOBBER mode for ncmpi_create() when files are existing symbolic
      links. Prior to this release, symbolic links, like other regular files, was
      first deleted and then created. This can result in an unexpected outcome,
      i.e. the deletion of symbolic link. NetCDF-4 library implements this
      differently, by adding O_TRUNC flag when calling open() to truncate the
      file to length 0. Historically, PnetCDF did not adopt the same approach
      because MPI does not define a similar flag to O_TRUNC and the only way to</comment>
