  <title>A collection of low-level debug facilities</title>
  <description>Data::Peek started off as 'DDumper' being a wrapper module over the
Data::Dumper manpage, but grew out to be a set of low-level data
introspection utilities that no other module provided yet, using the lowest
level of the perl internals API as possible.</description>
