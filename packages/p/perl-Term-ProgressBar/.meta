  <title>Perl Module that provides a Progress Meter on a standard Terminal</title>
  <description>Term::ProgressBar provides a simple progress bar on the terminal, to let the user know that something is happening, roughly how much stuff has been done, and maybe an estimate at how long remains.

A typical use sets up the progress bar with a number of items to do, and then calls update to update the bar whenever an item is processed.
