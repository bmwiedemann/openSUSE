%description
Searches upward from the calling module for a directory _t_ with a _lib_
directory inside it, and adds it to the module search path. Looks upward up
to 5 directories. This is intended to be used in test modules either
directly in _t_ or in a subdirectory to find their included testing
libraries located in _t/lib_.
