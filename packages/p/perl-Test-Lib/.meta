  <title>Use libraries from a t/lib directory</title>
  <description>Searches upward from the calling module for a directory _t_ with a _lib_ directory inside it, and adds it to the module search path. Looks upward up to 5 directories. This is intended to be used in test modules either directly in _t_ or in a subdirectory to find their included testing libraries located in _t/lib_.</description>
