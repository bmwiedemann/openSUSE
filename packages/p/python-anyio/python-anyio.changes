-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 21 21:04:03 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.6.2:
  - Pinned Trio to < 0.22 to avoid incompatibility with AnyIO's ``ExceptionGroup`` class
    causing ``AttributeError: 'NonBaseMultiError' object has no attribute '_exceptions'``
    (AnyIO 4 is unaffected)
  - Fixed exception handler in the asyncio test runner not properly handling a context
    that does not contain the ``exception`` key
  - Fixed ``TypeError`` in ``get_current_task()`` on asyncio when using a custom ``Task`` factory
  - Updated type annotations on ``run_process()`` and ``open_process()``:
    * ``command`` now accepts accepts bytes and sequences of bytes
    * ``stdin``, ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` now accept file-like objects
  - Changed the pytest plugin to run both the setup and teardown phases of asynchronous
    generator fixtures within a single task to enable use cases such as cancel scopes and
    task groups where a context manager straddles the ``yield``
- drop anyio-pytest7.patch (upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 27 18:32:27 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Add anyio-pytest7.patch -- gh#agronholm/anyio#420

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 15 16:06:39 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- skip some tests for older distros (lack of TLSv1.3 support) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 15 16:36:24 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.5.0:
  - Added ``start_new_session`` keyword argument to ``run_process()`` and ``open_process()``
  - Fixed deadlock in synchronization primitives on asyncio which can happen if a task acquiring a
    primitive is hit with a native (not AnyIO) cancellation with just the right timing, leaving the
    next acquiring task waiting forever
  - Added workaround for bpo-46313_ to enable compatibility with OpenSSL 3.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 29 12:01:51 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.4.0:
  * Added context propagation to/from worker threads in ``to_thread.run_sync()``,
  ``from_thread.run()`` and ``from_thread.run_sync()``
  * Fixed race condition in ``Lock`` and ``Semaphore`` classes when a task waiting on ``acquire()``
  is cancelled while another task is waiting to acquire the same primitive
  * Fixed async context manager's ``__aexit__()`` method not being called in
  ``BlockingPortal.wrap_async_context_manager()`` if the host task is cancelled
  * Fixed worker threads being marked as being event loop threads in sniffio
  * Fixed task parent ID not getting set to the correct value on asyncio
  * Enabled the test suite to run without IPv6 support, trio or pytest plugin autoloading

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 26 20:18:21 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.3.4:
  * Fixed ``BrokenResourceError`` instead of ``EndOfStream`` being raised in
   ``TLSStream`` when the peer abruptly closes the connection while
   ``TLSStream`` is receiving data with ``standard_compatible=False`` set

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 16 21:03:37 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.3.3:
  * Fixed UNIX socket listener not setting accepted sockets to non-blocking
    mode on asyncio
  * Changed unconnected UDP sockets to be always bound to a local port (on
    "any" interface) to avoid errors on asyncio + Windows
  * Fixed cancellation problem on asyncio where level-triggered cancellation
    for **all** parent cancel scopes would not resume after exiting a 
    shielded nested scope

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 17 19:23:22 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v3.3.1
  * Added missing documentation for the ExceptionGroup.exceptions
   attribute
  * Changed the asyncio test runner not to use uvloop by default
    (to match the behavior of anyio.run())
  * Fixed RuntimeError on asyncio when a CancelledError is raised
    from a task spawned through a BlockingPortal (#357)
  * Fixed asyncio warning about a Future with an exception that
    was never retrieved which happened when a socket was already
    written to but the peer abruptly closed the connection
- Release 3.3.0
  * Added asynchronous Path class
  * Added the wrap_file() function for wrapping existing files as
    asynchronous file objects
  * Relaxed the type of the path initializer argument to
    FileReadStream and FileWriteStream so they accept any
    path-like object (including the new asynchronous Path class)
  * Dropped unnecessary dependency on the async_generator library
  * Changed the generics in AsyncFile so that the methods
    correctly return either str or bytes based on the argument to
    open_file()
  * Fixed an asyncio bug where under certain circumstances, a
    stopping worker thread would still accept new assignments,
    leading to a hang
- Release 3.2.1
  * Fixed idle thread pruning on asyncio sometimes causing an
    expired worker thread to be assigned a task
- Release 3.2.0
  * Added Python 3.10 compatibility
  * Added the ability to close memory object streams synchronously
    (including support for use as a synchronous context manager)
  * Changed the default value of the use_uvloop asyncio backend
    option to False to prevent unsafe event loop policy changes in
    different threads
  * Fixed to_thread.run_sync() hanging on the second call on
    asyncio when used with loop.run_until_complete()
  * Fixed to_thread.run_sync() prematurely marking a worker thread
    inactive when a task await on the result is cancelled
  * Fixed ResourceWarning about an unclosed socket when UNIX
    socket connect fails on asyncio
  * Fixed the type annotation of open_signal_receiver() as a
    synchronous context manager
  * Fixed the type annotation of DeprecatedAwaitable(|List|Float).
    __await__ to match the typing.Awaitable protocol
- Unskip python36: uvloop is only optional

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 17 06:59:56 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Do not build for python 3.6: the required dependency uvloop does
  no longer support Python 3.6 since version 0.16.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 09:17:54 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.0:
  * Added env and cwd keyword arguments to run_process() and
    open_process.
  * Added support for mutation of CancelScope.shield
    (PR by John Belmonte)
  * Added the sleep_forever() and sleep_until() functions
  * Changed asyncio task groups so that if the host and child tasks
    have only raised CancelledErrors, just one CancelledError will
    now be raised instead of an ExceptionGroup, allowing asyncio to
    ignore it when it propagates out of the task
  * Changed task names to be converted to str early on asyncio
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed sniffio._impl.AsyncLibraryNotFoundError: unknown async
    library, or not in async context on asyncio and Python 3.6 when
    to_thread.run_sync() is used from loop.run_until_complete()
  * Fixed odd ExceptionGroup: 0 exceptions were raised in the task
    group appearing under certain circumstances on asyncio
  * Fixed wait_all_tasks_blocked() returning prematurely on asyncio
    when a previously blocked task is cancelled
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed declared return type of TaskGroup.start() (it was
    declared as None, but anything can be returned from it)
  * Fixed TextStream.extra_attributes raising AttributeError
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed await maybe_async(current_task()) returning None
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed: pickle.dumps(current_task()) now correctly raises
    TypeError instead of pickling to None (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed return type annotation of Event.wait() (bool → None)
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed return type annotation of RunVar.get() to return either
    the type of the default value or the type of the contained
    value (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed a deprecation warning message to refer to maybe_async()
    and not maybe_awaitable() (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Filled in argument and return types for all functions and
    methods previously missing them (PR by Thomas Grainger)

- Update to 3.0.1:
  * Fixed to_thread.run_sync() raising RuntimeError on asyncio
    when no "root" task could be found for setting up a cleanup
    callback. This was a problem at least on Tornado and possibly
    also Twisted in asyncio compatibility mode. The life of worker
    threads is now bound to the the host task of the topmost cancel
    scope hierarchy starting from the current one, or if no cancel
    scope is active, the current task.

- Update to 3.0.0:
  * Curio support has been dropped (see the :doc:`FAQ <faq>` as for
    why)
  * API changes:
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Submodules under anyio.abc. have been
      made private (use only anyio.abc from now on).
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE The following method was previously a
      coroutine method and has been converted into a synchronous
      one:
      * MemoryObjectReceiveStream.receive_nowait()
    - The following functions and methods are no longer
      asynchronous but can still be awaited on (doing so will emit
      a deprecation warning):
      * current_time()
      * current_effective_deadline()
      * get_current_task()
      * get_running_tasks()
      * CancelScope.cancel()
      * CapacityLimiter.acquire_nowait()
      * CapacityLimiter.acquire_on_behalf_of_nowait()
      * Condition.release()
      * Event.set()
      * Lock.release()
      * MemoryObjectSendStream.send_nowait()
      * Semaphore.release()
    - The following functions now return synchronous context
      managers instead of asynchronous context managers (and emit
      deprecation warnings if used as async context managers):
      * fail_after()
      * move_on_after()
      * open_cancel_scope() (now just CancelScope(); see below)
      * open_signal_receiver()
    - The following functions and methods have been renamed/moved
      (will now emit deprecation warnings when you use them by
      their old names):
      * create_blocking_portal() →
        anyio.from_thread.BlockingPortal()
      * create_capacity_limiter() → anyio.CapacityLimiter()
      * create_event() → anyio.Event()
      * create_lock() → anyio.Lock()
      * create_condition() → anyio.Condition()
      * create_semaphore() → anyio.Semaphore()
      * current_default_worker_thread_limiter() →
        anyio.to_thread.current_default_thread_limiter()
      * open_cancel_scope() → anyio.CancelScope()
      * run_sync_in_worker_thread() → anyio.to_thread.run_sync()
      * run_async_from_thread() → anyio.from_thread.run()
      * run_sync_from_thread() → anyio.from_thread.run_sync()
      * BlockingPortal.spawn_task → BlockingPortal.start_task_soon
      * CapacityLimiter.set_total_tokens() → limiter.total_tokens
        = ...
      * TaskGroup.spawn() → TaskGroup.start_soon()
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE start_blocking_portal() must now be
      used as a context manager (it no longer returns a
      BlockingPortal, but a context manager that yields one)
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE The
      BlockingPortal.stop_from_external_thread() method (use
      portal.call(portal.stop) instead now)
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE The SocketStream and SocketListener
      classes were made non-generic
    - Made all non-frozen dataclasses hashable with eq=False
    - Removed __slots__ from BlockingPortal
    See the :doc:`migration documentation <migration>` for
    instructions on how to deal with these changes.
  * Improvements to running synchronous code:
    - Added the run_sync_from_thread() function
    - Added the run_sync_in_process() function for running code in
      worker processes (big thanks to Richard Sheridan for his help
      on this one!)
  * Improvements to sockets and streaming:
    - Added the UNIXSocketStream class which is capable of sending
      and receiving file descriptors
    - Added the FileReadStream and FileWriteStream classes
    - create_unix_listener() now removes any existing socket at the
      given path before proceeding (instead of raising OSError:
      Address already in use)
  * Improvements to task groups and cancellation:
    - Added the TaskGroup.start() method and a corresponding
      BlockingPortal.start_task() method
    - Added the name argument to BlockingPortal.start_task_soon()
      (renamed from BlockingPortal.spawn_task())
    - Changed CancelScope.deadline to be writable
    - Added the following functions in the anyio.lowlevel module:
      * checkpoint()
      * checkpoint_if_cancelled()
      * cancel_shielded_checkpoint()
  * Improvements and changes to synchronization primitives:
    - Added the Lock.acquire_nowait(), Condition.acquire_nowait()
      and Semaphore.acquire_nowait() methods
    - Added the statistics() method to Event, Lock, Condition,
      Semaphore, CapacityLimiter, MemoryObjectReceiveStream and
      MemoryObjectSendStream
    - Lock and Condition can now only be released by the task that
      acquired them. This behavior is now consistent on all
      backends whereas previously only Trio enforced this.
    - The CapacityLimiter.total_tokens property is now writable and
      CapacityLimiter.set_total_tokens() has been deprecated
    - Added the max_value property to Semaphore
  * Asyncio specific improvements (big thanks to Thomas Grainger
    for his effort on most of these!):
    - Cancel scopes are now properly enforced with native asyncio
      coroutine functions (without any explicit AnyIO checkpoints)
    - Changed the asyncio CancelScope to raise a RuntimeError if a
      cancel scope is being exited before it was even entered
    - Changed the asyncio test runner to capture unhandled
      exceptions from asynchronous callbacks and unbound native
      tasks which are then raised after the test function (or async
      fixture setup or teardown) completes
    - Changed the asyncio TaskGroup.start_soon() (formerly spawn())
      method to call the target function immediately before
      starting the task, for consistency across backends
    - Changed the asyncio TaskGroup.start_soon() (formerly spawn())
      method to avoid the use of a coroutine wrapper on Python 3.8+
      and added a hint for hiding the wrapper in tracebacks on
      earlier Pythons (supported by Pytest, Sentry etc.)
    - Changed the default thread limiter on asyncio to use a RunVar
      so it is scoped to the current event loop, thus avoiding
      potential conflict among multiple running event loops
    - Thread pooling is now used on asyncio with
      run_sync_in_worker_thread()
    - Fixed current_effective_deadline() raising KeyError on
      asyncio when no cancel scope is active
  * Added the RunVar class for scoping variables to the running
    event loop

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 15 05:57:41 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.2.0:
  * Added the ``maybe_async()`` and ``maybe_async_cm()`` functions to facilitate forward compatibility with AnyIO 3
  * Fixed socket stream bug on asyncio where receiving a half-close from the peer would shut down the entire connection
  * Fixed native task names not being set on asyncio on Python 3.8+
  * Fixed ``TLSStream.send_eof()`` raising ``ValueError`` instead of the expected ``NotImplementedError``
  * Fixed ``open_signal_receiver()`` on asyncio and curio hanging if the cancel scope was cancelled before the function could run
  * Fixed Trio test runner causing unwarranted test errors on ``BaseException``s
  * Fixed formatted output of ``ExceptionGroup`` containing too many newlines
  * Added the ``spawn_task()`` and ``wrap_async_context_manager()`` methods to ``BlockingPortal``
  * Added the ``handshake_timeout`` and ``error_handler`` parameters to ``TLSListener``
  * Fixed ``Event`` objects on the trio backend not inheriting from ``anyio.abc.Event``
  * Fixed ``run_sync_in_worker_thread()`` raising ``UnboundLocalError`` on asyncio when cancelled
  * Fixed ``send()`` on socket streams not raising any exception on asyncio, and an unwrapped
  * ``BrokenPipeError`` on trio and curio when the peer has disconnected
  * Fixed ``MemoryObjectSendStream.send()`` raising ``BrokenResourceError`` when the last receiver is closed right after receiving the item
  * Fixed ``ValueError: Invalid file descriptor: -1`` when closing a ``SocketListener`` on asyncio
