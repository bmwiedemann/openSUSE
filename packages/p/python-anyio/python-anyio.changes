-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 10 09:17:39 UTC 2025 - Nico Krapp <nico.krapp@suse.com>

- Update to 4.8.0:
  * Added experimental support for running functions in 
    subinterpreters on Python 3.13 and later
  * Added support for the copy(), copy_into(), move() and move_into() 
    methods in anyio.Path, available in Python 3.14
  * Changed TaskGroup on asyncio to always spawn tasks non-eagerly, 
    even if using a task factory created 
    via asyncio.create_eager_task_factory(), to preserve expected 
    Trio-like task scheduling semantics (PR by @agronholm and @graingert)
  * Configure SO_RCVBUF, SO_SNDBUF and TCP_NODELAY on the selector 
    thread waker socket pair (this should improve the performance of 
    wait_readable() and wait_writable() when using the ProactorEventLoop) 
    (#836; PR by @graingert)
  * Fixed AssertionError when using nest-asyncio (#840)
  * Fixed return type annotation of various context managers' 
    __exit__ method (#847; PR by @Enegg)
- from 4.7.0:
  * Updated TaskGroup to work with asyncio's eager task factories (#764)
  * Added the wait_readable() and wait_writable() functions which will 
    accept an object with a .fileno() method or an integer handle, and 
    deprecated their now obsolete versions (wait_socket_readable() and 
    wait_socket_writable()) (PR by @davidbrochart)
  * Changed EventAdapter (an Event with no bound async backend) to allow 
    set() to work even before an async backend is bound to it (#819)
  * Added support for wait_readable() and wait_writable() on 
    ProactorEventLoop (used on asyncio + Windows by default)
  * Fixed a misleading ValueError in the context of DNS failures

    asyncio.Task.uncancel when propagating a CancelledError on exit 
    to a cancelled parent scope (#790; PR by @gschaffner)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 22 16:00:48 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.6.2:
  * Fixed regression caused by (\#807) that prevented the use
    of parametrized async fixtures
- update to 4.6.1:
  * Fixed TaskGroup and CancelScope producing cyclic references
    in tracebacks when raising exceptions (\#806) (PR by
    @graingert)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  2 18:02:06 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- update to 4.6.0:
  * Dropped support for Python 3.8 (as #698 cannot be resolved
    without cancel message support)
  * Fixed 100% CPU use on asyncio while waiting for an exiting task
    group to finish while said task group is within a cancelled
    cancel scope (#695)
  * Fixed cancel scopes on asyncio not propagating CancelledError
    on exit when the enclosing cancel scope has been effectively
    cancelled (#698)
  * Fixed asyncio task groups not yielding control to the event
    loop at exit if there were no child tasks to wait on
  * Fixed inconsistent task uncancellation with asyncio cancel
    scopes belonging to a task group when said task group has child
    tasks running
- update to 4.5.0:
  * Improved the performance of anyio.Lock and anyio.Semaphore on
    asyncio (even up to 50 %)
  * Added the fast_acquire parameter to anyio.Lock and
    anyio.Semaphore to further boost performance at the expense of
    safety (acquire() will not yield control back if there is no
    contention)
  * Added support for the from_uri(), full_match(), parser
    methods/properties in anyio.Path, newly added in Python 3.13
    (#737)
  * Added support for more keyword arguments for run_process() and
    open_process(): startupinfo, creationflags, pass_fds, user,
    group, extra_groups and umask (#742)
  * Improved the type annotations and support for PathLike in
    run_process() and open_process() to allow for path-like
    arguments, just like subprocess.Popen
  * Changed the ResourceWarning from an unclosed memory object
    stream to include its address for easier identification
  * Changed start_blocking_portal() to always use daemonic threads,
    to accommodate the "loitering event loop" use case
  * Bumped the minimum version of Trio to v0.26.1
  * Fixed __repr__() of MemoryObjectItemReceiver, when item is not
    defined (#767; PR by @Danipulok)

    __main__.__file__ pointed to a file in a nonexistent directory
    (#696)
  * Fixed AssertionError: feed_data after feed_eof on asyncio when
    a subprocess is closed early, before its output has been read
    (#490)
  * Fixed TaskInfo.has_pending_cancellation() on asyncio not
    respecting shielded scopes (#771; PR by @gschaffner)
  * Fixed SocketStream.receive() returning bytearray instead of
    bytes when using asyncio with ProactorEventLoop (Windows)
    (#776)
  * Fixed quitting the debugger in a pytest test session while in
    an active task group failing the test instead of exiting the
    test session (because the exit exception arrives in an
    exception group)
  * Fixed support for Linux abstract namespaces in UNIX sockets
    that was broken in v4.2 (#781; PR by @tapetersen)
  * Fixed KeyboardInterrupt (ctrl+c) hanging the asyncio pytest
    runner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 12 09:21:08 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.4.0:
  * Added the BlockingPortalProvider class to aid with
    constructing synchronous counterparts to asynchronous
    interfaces that would otherwise require multiple blocking
    portals
  * Added __slots__ to AsyncResource so that child classes can
    use __slots__
  * Added the TaskInfo.has_pending_cancellation() method
  * Fixed erroneous RuntimeError: called 'started' twice on the
    same task status when cancelling a task in a TaskGroup
    created with the start() method before the first checkpoint
    is reached after calling task_status.started()
  * Fixed two bugs with TaskGroup.start() on asyncio: Fixed
    erroneous RuntimeError: called 'started' twice on the same
    task status when cancelling a task in a TaskGroup created
    with the start() method before the first checkpoint is
    reached after calling task_status.started() (#706; PR by
    Dominik Schwabe) Fixed the entire task group being cancelled
    if a TaskGroup.start() call gets cancelled (#685, #710)
  * Fixed erroneous RuntimeError: called 'started' twice on the
    same task status when cancelling a task in a TaskGroup
    created with the start() method before the first checkpoint
    is reached after calling task_status.started()
  * Fixed the entire task group being cancelled if a
    TaskGroup.start() call gets cancelled
  * Fixed a race condition that caused crashes when multiple
    event loops of the same backend were running in separate
    threads and simultaneously attempted to use AnyIO for their
    first time
  * Fixed cancellation delivery on asyncio incrementing the wrong
    cancel scope's cancellation counter when cascading a cancel
    operation to a child scope, thus failing to uncancel the host
    task
  * Fixed erroneous TypedAttributeLookupError if a typed
    attribute getter raises KeyError
  * Fixed the asyncio backend not respecting the
    PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG environment variable when setting the
    debug flag in anyio.run()
  * Fixed SocketStream.receive() not detecting EOF on asyncio if
    there is also data in the read buffer
  * Fixed MemoryObjectStream dropping an item if the item is
    delivered to a recipient that is waiting to receive an item
    but has a cancellation pending
  * Emit a ResourceWarning for MemoryObjectReceiveStream and
    MemoryObjectSendStream that were garbage collected without
    being closed (PR by Andrey Kazantcev)
  * Fixed MemoryObjectSendStream.send() not raising
    BrokenResourceError when the last corresponding
    MemoryObjectReceiveStream is closed while waiting to send a
    falsey item

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 11 23:36:15 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 4.3.0:
  * Added support for the Python 3.12 ``walk_up`` keyword argument in
    ``anyio.Path.relative_to()``
  * Fixed passing ``total_tokens`` to ``anyio.CapacityLimiter()`` as a
    keyword argument not working on the ``trio`` backend
  * Fixed ``Process.aclose()`` not performing the minimum level of
    necessary cleanup when cancelled
  * Fixed ``Process.stdin.aclose()``, ``Process.stdout.aclose()``, and
    ``Process.stderr.aclose()``
- Add exceptiongroup to {Build,}Requires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 20:50:56 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.2.0:
  * Add support for byte-based paths in connect_unix,
    create_unix_listeners, create_unix_datagram_socket, and
    create_connected_unix_datagram_socket. (PR by Lura Skye)
  * Enabled the Event and CapacityLimiter classes to be
    instantiated outside an event loop thread
  * Broadly improved/fixed the type annotations. Among other
    things, many functions and methods that take variadic
    positional arguments now make use of PEP 646 TypeVarTuple to
    allow the positional arguments to be validated by static type
    checkers. These changes affected numerous methods and
    functions, including: * anyio.run() * TaskGroup.start_soon()
    * anyio.from_thread.run() * anyio.from_thread.run_sync() *
    anyio.to_thread.run_sync() * anyio.to_process.run_sync() *
    BlockingPortal.call() * BlockingPortal.start_task_soon() *
    BlockingPortal.start_task() (also resolves #560)
  * Fixed various type annotations of anyio.Path to match
    Typeshed: * anyio.Path.__lt__() * anyio.Path.__le__() *
    anyio.Path.__gt__() * anyio.Path.__ge__() *
    anyio.Path.__truediv__() * anyio.Path.__rtruediv__() *
    anyio.Path.hardlink_to() * anyio.Path.samefile() *
    anyio.Path.symlink_to() * anyio.Path.with_segments() (PR by
    Ganden Schaffner)
  * Fixed adjusting the total number of tokens in a
    CapacityLimiter on asyncio failing to wake up tasks waiting
    to acquire the limiter in certain edge cases (fixed with help
    from Egor Blagov)
  * Fixed loop_factory and use_uvloop options not being used on
    the asyncio backend
  * Fixed cancellation propagating on asyncio from a task group
    to child tasks if the task hosting the task group is in a
    shielded cancel scope

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 16:52:20 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.1.0:
  * Adapted to API changes made in Trio v0.23
  * Removed a checkpoint when exiting a task group
  * Renamed the ``cancellable`` argument in
    ``anyio.to_thread.run_sync()`` to
  * ``abandon_on_cancel`` (and deprecated the old parameter name)
  * Added support for voluntary thread cancellation via
  * ``anyio.from_thread.check_cancelled()``
  * Bumped minimum version of trio to v0.23
  * Exposed the ``ResourceGuard`` class in the public API
  * Fixed ``RuntimeError: Runner is closed`` when running higher-
    scoped async generator fixtures in some cases
  * Fixed discrepancy between ``asyncio`` and ``trio`` where
    reraising a cancellation exception in an ``except*`` block
    would incorrectly bubble out of its cancel scope
  * Any exceptions raising out of a task groups are now nested
    inside an ``ExceptionGroup`` (or ``BaseExceptionGroup`` if one
    or more ``BaseException`` were included)
  * Fixed task group not raising a cancellation exception on
    asyncio at exit if no child tasks were spawned and an outer
    cancellation scope had been cancelled before
  * Ensured that exiting a ``TaskGroup`` always hits a yield
    point, regardless of whether there are running child tasks to
    be waited on
  * On asyncio, cancel scopes will defer cancelling tasks that
    are scheduled to resume with a finished future
  * On asyncio and Python 3.9/3.10, cancel scopes now only
    suppress cancellation exceptions if the cancel message matches
    the scope
  * Task groups on all backends now raise a single cancellation
    exception when an outer cancel scope is cancelled, and no
    exceptions other than cancellation exceptions are raised in
    the group
  * **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Changes the pytest plugin to run
    all tests and fixtures in the same task, allowing fixtures to
    set context variables for tests and other fixtures
    ``anyio.Path.relative_to()`` and
  * ``anyio.Path.is_relative_to()`` to only accept one argument,
    as passing multiple arguments is deprecated as of Python 3.12
  * **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Dropped support for spawning tasks
    from old-style coroutine functions (``@asyncio.coroutine``)
  * **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** The ``policy`` option on the
    ``asyncio`` backend was changed to ``loop_factory`` to
    accommodate ``asyncio.Runner``
  * Dropped support for Python 3.7
  * Added support for Python 3.12
  * Fixed ``from_thread.run`` failing when used to call sniffio-
    dependent functions on asyncio from a thread running trio or curio
  * Fixed deadlock when using
    ``from_thread.start_blocking_portal(backend="asyncio")``
  * in a thread running trio or curio (PR by Ganden Schaffner)
  * Improved type annotations:
  * The ``item_type`` argument of ``create_memory_object_stream``
    was deprecated.
  * To indicate the item type handled by the stream, use
  * ``create_memory_object_stream[T_Item]()`` instead. Type
    checking should no longer fail when annotating memory object
- drop tests-test_fileio.py-don-t-follow-symlinks-in-dev.patch
  (upstream)

    asyncio
  * Fixed several minor documentation issues (broken links to
    classes, missing classes or attributes)
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6
  * Improved type annotations:
  * Several functions and methods that were previously annotated
    as accepting ``Coroutine[Any, Any, Any]`` as the return type
    of the callable have been amended to accept ``Awaitable[Any]``
    instead, to allow a slightly broader set of coroutine-like
    inputs, like ``async_generator_asend`` objects returned from
    the ``asend()`` method of async generators, and to match
    the ``trio`` annotations:
    * ``anyio.run()``
    * ``anyio.from_thread.run()``
    * ``TaskGroup.start_soon()``
    * ``TaskGroup.start()``
    * ``BlockingPortal.call()``
    * ``BlockingPortal.start_task_soon()``
    * ``BlockingPortal.start_task()``
  * Changed ``TLSAttribute.shared_ciphers`` to match the
    documented semantics of ``SSLSocket.shared_ciphers``
    of always returning ``None`` for client-side streams
  * Fixed ``CapacityLimiter`` on the asyncio backend to order
    waiting tasks in the FIFO order (instead of LIFO)
  * Fixed ``CancelScope.cancel()`` not working on asyncio if
    called before entering the scope
  * Fixed ``open_signal_receiver()`` inconsistently yielding
    integers instead of ``signal.Signals`` instances on the
    ``trio`` backend
  * Fixed ``to_thread.run_sync()`` hanging on asyncio if the
    target callable raises ``StopIteration``
  * Fixed ``start_blocking_portal()`` raising an unwarranted
  * ``RuntimeError: This portal is not running`` if a task raises
    an exception that causes the event loop to be closed
  * Fixed ``current_effective_deadline()`` not returning ``-inf``
    on asyncio when the currently active cancel scope has been
    cancelled (PR by Ganden Schaffner)
  * Fixed the ``OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF`` flag in an SSL context
    created by default in ``TLSStream.wrap()`` being inadvertently
    set on Python 3.11.3 and 3.10.11
  * Fixed ``CancelScope`` to properly handle asyncio task
    uncancellation on Python 3.11
  * Fixed ``OSError`` when trying to use
    ``create_tcp_listener()`` to bind to a link-local
  * IPv6 address (and worked around related bugs in ``uvloop``)
  * Worked around a `PyPy bug
    <https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3938>`_
    when using ``anyio.getaddrinfo()`` with for IPv6 link-local
    addresses containing interface names

    mode on asyncio
  * Changed unconnected UDP sockets to be always bound to a local port (on
    "any" interface) to avoid errors on asyncio + Windows
  * Fixed cancellation problem on asyncio where level-triggered cancellation
    for **all** parent cancel scopes would not resume after exiting a
    shielded nested scope

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Added asynchronous Path class
  * Added the wrap_file() function for wrapping existing files as
    asynchronous file objects

    path-like object (including the new asynchronous Path class)
  * Dropped unnecessary dependency on the async_generator library
  * Changed the generics in AsyncFile so that the methods
    correctly return either str or bytes based on the argument to
    open_file()
  * Fixed an asyncio bug where under certain circumstances, a
    stopping worker thread would still accept new assignments,
    leading to a hang
- Release 3.2.1
  * Fixed idle thread pruning on asyncio sometimes causing an
    expired worker thread to be assigned a task
- Release 3.2.0
  * Added Python 3.10 compatibility
  * Added the ability to close memory object streams synchronously
    (including support for use as a synchronous context manager)
  * Changed the default value of the use_uvloop asyncio backend
    option to False to prevent unsafe event loop policy changes in
    different threads
  * Fixed to_thread.run_sync() hanging on the second call on
    asyncio when used with loop.run_until_complete()
  * Fixed to_thread.run_sync() prematurely marking a worker thread
    inactive when a task await on the result is cancelled
  * Fixed ResourceWarning about an unclosed socket when UNIX
    socket connect fails on asyncio
  * Fixed the type annotation of open_signal_receiver() as a
    synchronous context manager
  * Fixed the type annotation of DeprecatedAwaitable(|List|Float).
    __await__ to match the typing.Awaitable protocol
- Unskip python36: uvloop is only optional

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 17 06:59:56 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Do not build for python 3.6: the required dependency uvloop does
  no longer support Python 3.6 since version 0.16.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 09:17:54 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.0:
  * Added env and cwd keyword arguments to run_process() and
    open_process.
  * Added support for mutation of CancelScope.shield
    (PR by John Belmonte)
  * Added the sleep_forever() and sleep_until() functions
  * Changed asyncio task groups so that if the host and child tasks
    have only raised CancelledErrors, just one CancelledError will
    now be raised instead of an ExceptionGroup, allowing asyncio to
    ignore it when it propagates out of the task
  * Changed task names to be converted to str early on asyncio
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed sniffio._impl.AsyncLibraryNotFoundError: unknown async
    library, or not in async context on asyncio and Python 3.6 when
    to_thread.run_sync() is used from loop.run_until_complete()
  * Fixed odd ExceptionGroup: 0 exceptions were raised in the task
    group appearing under certain circumstances on asyncio
  * Fixed wait_all_tasks_blocked() returning prematurely on asyncio
    when a previously blocked task is cancelled
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed declared return type of TaskGroup.start() (it was
    declared as None, but anything can be returned from it)
  * Fixed TextStream.extra_attributes raising AttributeError
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed await maybe_async(current_task()) returning None
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed: pickle.dumps(current_task()) now correctly raises
    TypeError instead of pickling to None (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed return type annotation of Event.wait() (bool → None)
    (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed return type annotation of RunVar.get() to return either
    the type of the default value or the type of the contained
    value (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Fixed a deprecation warning message to refer to maybe_async()
    and not maybe_awaitable() (PR by Thomas Grainger)
  * Filled in argument and return types for all functions and
    methods previously missing them (PR by Thomas Grainger)

- Update to 3.0.1:
  * Fixed to_thread.run_sync() raising RuntimeError on asyncio
    when no "root" task could be found for setting up a cleanup
    callback. This was a problem at least on Tornado and possibly
    also Twisted in asyncio compatibility mode. The life of worker
    threads is now bound to the the host task of the topmost cancel
    scope hierarchy starting from the current one, or if no cancel
    scope is active, the current task.

- Update to 3.0.0:
  * Curio support has been dropped (see the :doc:`FAQ <faq>` as for
    why)
  * API changes:
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE Submodules under anyio.abc. have been
      made private (use only anyio.abc from now on).
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE The following method was previously a
      coroutine method and has been converted into a synchronous
      one:
      * MemoryObjectReceiveStream.receive_nowait()
    - The following functions and methods are no longer
      asynchronous but can still be awaited on (doing so will emit
      a deprecation warning):
      * current_time()
      * current_effective_deadline()
      * get_current_task()
      * get_running_tasks()
      * CancelScope.cancel()
      * CapacityLimiter.acquire_nowait()
      * CapacityLimiter.acquire_on_behalf_of_nowait()
      * Condition.release()
      * Event.set()
      * Lock.release()
      * MemoryObjectSendStream.send_nowait()
      * Semaphore.release()
    - The following functions now return synchronous context
      managers instead of asynchronous context managers (and emit
      deprecation warnings if used as async context managers):
      * fail_after()
      * move_on_after()
      * open_cancel_scope() (now just CancelScope(); see below)
      * open_signal_receiver()
    - The following functions and methods have been renamed/moved
      (will now emit deprecation warnings when you use them by
      their old names):
      * create_blocking_portal() →
        anyio.from_thread.BlockingPortal()
      * create_capacity_limiter() → anyio.CapacityLimiter()
      * create_event() → anyio.Event()
      * create_lock() → anyio.Lock()
      * create_condition() → anyio.Condition()
      * create_semaphore() → anyio.Semaphore()
      * current_default_worker_thread_limiter() →
        anyio.to_thread.current_default_thread_limiter()
      * open_cancel_scope() → anyio.CancelScope()
      * run_sync_in_worker_thread() → anyio.to_thread.run_sync()
      * run_async_from_thread() → anyio.from_thread.run()
      * run_sync_from_thread() → anyio.from_thread.run_sync()
      * BlockingPortal.spawn_task → BlockingPortal.start_task_soon
      * CapacityLimiter.set_total_tokens() → limiter.total_tokens
        = ...
      * TaskGroup.spawn() → TaskGroup.start_soon()
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE start_blocking_portal() must now be
      used as a context manager (it no longer returns a
      BlockingPortal, but a context manager that yields one)
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE The
      BlockingPortal.stop_from_external_thread() method (use
      portal.call(portal.stop) instead now)
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE The SocketStream and SocketListener
      classes were made non-generic
    - Made all non-frozen dataclasses hashable with eq=False
    - Removed __slots__ from BlockingPortal
    See the :doc:`migration documentation <migration>` for
    instructions on how to deal with these changes.
  * Improvements to running synchronous code:
    - Added the run_sync_from_thread() function
    - Added the run_sync_in_process() function for running code in
      worker processes (big thanks to Richard Sheridan for his help
      on this one!)
  * Improvements to sockets and streaming:
    - Added the UNIXSocketStream class which is capable of sending
      and receiving file descriptors
    - Added the FileReadStream and FileWriteStream classes
    - create_unix_listener() now removes any existing socket at the
      given path before proceeding (instead of raising OSError:
      Address already in use)
  * Improvements to task groups and cancellation:
    - Added the TaskGroup.start() method and a corresponding
      BlockingPortal.start_task() method
    - Added the name argument to BlockingPortal.start_task_soon()
      (renamed from BlockingPortal.spawn_task())
    - Changed CancelScope.deadline to be writable
    - Added the following functions in the anyio.lowlevel module:
      * checkpoint()
      * checkpoint_if_cancelled()
      * cancel_shielded_checkpoint()
  * Improvements and changes to synchronization primitives:
    - Added the Lock.acquire_nowait(), Condition.acquire_nowait()
      and Semaphore.acquire_nowait() methods
    - Added the statistics() method to Event, Lock, Condition,
      Semaphore, CapacityLimiter, MemoryObjectReceiveStream and
      MemoryObjectSendStream
    - Lock and Condition can now only be released by the task that
      acquired them. This behavior is now consistent on all
      backends whereas previously only Trio enforced this.
    - The CapacityLimiter.total_tokens property is now writable and
      CapacityLimiter.set_total_tokens() has been deprecated
    - Added the max_value property to Semaphore
  * Asyncio specific improvements (big thanks to Thomas Grainger
    for his effort on most of these!):
    - Cancel scopes are now properly enforced with native asyncio
      coroutine functions (without any explicit AnyIO checkpoints)
    - Changed the asyncio CancelScope to raise a RuntimeError if a
      cancel scope is being exited before it was even entered
    - Changed the asyncio test runner to capture unhandled
      exceptions from asynchronous callbacks and unbound native
      tasks which are then raised after the test function (or async
      fixture setup or teardown) completes
    - Changed the asyncio TaskGroup.start_soon() (formerly spawn())
      method to call the target function immediately before
      starting the task, for consistency across backends
    - Changed the asyncio TaskGroup.start_soon() (formerly spawn())
      method to avoid the use of a coroutine wrapper on Python 3.8+
      and added a hint for hiding the wrapper in tracebacks on
      earlier Pythons (supported by Pytest, Sentry etc.)
    - Changed the default thread limiter on asyncio to use a RunVar
      so it is scoped to the current event loop, thus avoiding
      potential conflict among multiple running event loops
    - Thread pooling is now used on asyncio with
      run_sync_in_worker_thread()
    - Fixed current_effective_deadline() raising KeyError on
      asyncio when no cancel scope is active
  * Added the RunVar class for scoping variables to the running
    event loop

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 15 05:57:41 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.2.0:
  * Added the ``maybe_async()`` and ``maybe_async_cm()`` functions to facilitate forward compatibility with AnyIO 3
  * Fixed socket stream bug on asyncio where receiving a half-close from the peer would shut down the entire connection
  * Fixed native task names not being set on asyncio on Python 3.8+
  * Fixed ``TLSStream.send_eof()`` raising ``ValueError`` instead of the expected ``NotImplementedError``
  * Fixed ``open_signal_receiver()`` on asyncio and curio hanging if the cancel scope was cancelled before the function could run
  * Fixed Trio test runner causing unwarranted test errors on ``BaseException``s
  * Fixed formatted output of ``ExceptionGroup`` containing too many newlines
  * Added the ``spawn_task()`` and ``wrap_async_context_manager()`` methods to ``BlockingPortal``
  * Added the ``handshake_timeout`` and ``error_handler`` parameters to ``TLSListener``
  * Fixed ``Event`` objects on the trio backend not inheriting from ``anyio.abc.Event``
  * Fixed ``run_sync_in_worker_thread()`` raising ``UnboundLocalError`` on asyncio when cancelled
  * Fixed ``send()`` on socket streams not raising any exception on asyncio, and an unwrapped
  * ``BrokenPipeError`` on trio and curio when the peer has disconnected
  * Fixed ``MemoryObjectSendStream.send()`` raising ``BrokenResourceError`` when the last receiver is closed right after receiving the item
  * Fixed ``ValueError: Invalid file descriptor: -1`` when closing a ``SocketListener`` on asyncio
