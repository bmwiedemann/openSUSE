%description
'B::Keywords' supplies several arrays of exportable keywords: '@Scalars',
'@Arrays', '@Hashes', '@Filehandles', '@Symbols', '@Functions',
'@Barewords', '@TieIOMethods', '@UNIVERSALMethods' and '@ExporterSymbols'.

The '@Symbols' array includes the contents of each of '@Scalars',
'@Arrays', '@Hashes', '@Functions' and '@Filehandles'.

Similarly, '@Barewords' adds a few non-function keywords and operators to
the '@Functions' array.

All additions and modifications are welcome.

The perl parser uses a static list of keywords from _regen/keywords.pl_
which constitutes the strict list of keywords @Functions and @Barewords,
though some @Functions are not functions in the strict sense. Several
library functions use more special symbols, handles and methods.
