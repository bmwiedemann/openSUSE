  <title>Simple CPAN package extractor</title>
  <description>This is a fork of Archive::Any by Michael Schwern and Clint Moore. The main difference is this works properly even when you fork(), and may require less memory to extract a tarball. On the other hand, this isn't pluggable (this only supports file formats used in the CPAN toolchains), and this doesn't check mime types (at least as of this writing).</description>
