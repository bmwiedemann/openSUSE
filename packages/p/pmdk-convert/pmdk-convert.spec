# By design, NVML does not support any 32-bit architecture.
# Due to dependency on xmmintrin.h and some inline assembly, it can be
# compiled only for x86_64 at the moment.
# Other 64-bit architectures could also be supported, if only there is
# a request for that, and if somebody provides the arch-specific
# implementation of the low-level routines for flushing to persistent
# memory.
ExclusiveArch:  x86_64

%description
