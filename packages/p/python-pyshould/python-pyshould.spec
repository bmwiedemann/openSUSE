%description
PyShould is a Python DSL allowing to write expectations or assertions
in almost natural language. The goal is to offer an expressive yet
readable syntax to define the expectations in detail.

Under the hood it uses the PyHamcrest library of matchers to build
complex matching predicates and great explanations when there is a
mismatch.

Its primary use case is in unit testing, replacing the need for
Python's native assertX methods. Its use is completely transparent
to the unit testing runner used, since mismatches are reported using
the standard AssertionError.
