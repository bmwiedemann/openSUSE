%description
JsonSlicer performs a stream or iterative, pull JSON parsing, which
means it does not load whole JSON into memory and is able to parse
very large JSON files or streams. The module is written in C and uses
YAJL JSON parsing library.

JsonSlicer takes a path of JSON map keys or array indexes, and
provides iterator interface which yields JSON data matching
given path as complete Python objects.
