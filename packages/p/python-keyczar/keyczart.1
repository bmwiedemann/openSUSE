.TH kEYCZART "1" "April 2013" "http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
keyczart \- A Cryptographic Toolkit.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B keyczart
\fR[\fIcommand\fR] \fR[\fIflags\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Keyczar's goal is to make it easier for application developers to safely use
cryptography. Keyczar defaults to safe algorithms, key lengths, and
modes, and prevents developers from inadvertently exposing key material. It
uses a simple, extensible key versioning system that allows developers to
easily rotate and retire keys.

.SH COMMANDS and FLAGS
\fBcreate\fR \fB\-\-location=\fR/path/to/keys \fB\-\-purpose=\fR(crypt|sign) [\fB\-\-name=\fR"A name"] [\fB\-\-asymmetric=\fR(dsa|rsa)]
.br
  Creates a new, empty key set in the given location.
  This key set must have a purpose of either "crypt" or "sign"
  and may optionally be given a name. The optional asymmetric
  flag will generate a public key set of the given algorithm.
  The "dsa" asymmetric value is valid only for sets with "sign" 
  purpose.
.PP
\fBaddkey\fR \fB\-\-location=\fR/path/to/keys [\fB\-\-status=\fR(active|primary)] [\fB\-\-size=\fRsize] [\fB\-\-crypter=\fRcrypterLocation]
.br
  Adds a new key to an existing key set. Optionally
  specify a purpose, which is active by default. Optionally
  specify a key size in bits. Also optionally specify the
  location of a set of crypting keys, which will be used to
  encrypt this key set.
.PP
\fBpubkey\fR \fB\-\-location=\fR/path/to/keys \fB\-\-destination=\fR/destination
.br
  Extracts public keys from a given key set and writes them
  to the destination. The "pubkey" command Only works for
  key sets that were created with the "--asymmetric" flag.
.PP
\fBpromote\fR \fB\-\-location=\fR/path/to/keys \fB\-\-version=\fRversionNumber
.br
  Promotes the status of the given key version in the given 
  location. Active keys are promoted to primary (which demotes 
  any existing primary key to active). Keys scheduled for 
  revocation are promoted to be active.
.PP
\fBdemote\fR \fB\-\-location=\fR/path/to/keys \fB\-\-version=\fRversionNumber
.br
  Demotes the status of the given key version in the given
  location. Primary keys are demoted to active. Active keys
  are scheduled for revocation.
.PP
\fBrevoke\fR \fB\-\-location=\fR/path/to/keys \fB\-\-version=\fRversionNumber
.br
  Revokes the key of the given version number.
  This key must have been scheduled for revocation by the
  promote command. WARNING: The key will be destroyed.
.br
.PP
Optional flags are in [brackets]. The notation (a|b|c) means "a", "b", and "c"
are the valid choices
