  <title>Provide commonly requested regular expressions</title>
  <description>By default, this module exports a single hash ('%RE') that stores or
generates commonly needed regular expressions (see the &quot;List of available
patterns&quot; manpage).

There is an alternative, subroutine-based syntax described in the
&quot;Subroutine-based interface&quot; manpage.</description>
