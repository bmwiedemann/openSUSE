Mon Nov 17 08:51:56 UTC 2025 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.316:
  * The DIRE parton shower is no longer supported and consequently
    has been removed in this release.
  * The reorganization of fragmentation models, begun in 8.313,
    continues. 
  * New code for the cross section of the production of t-tbar
    pairs in hadron collisions near the threshold, both above and
    below it. 
  * New options to add non-singular and higher-order terms to the
    splitting kernels for timelike showers, along with a new
    example program main303.cc.
  * New options to regulate the running of alphaS in the infrared,
    by freezing it at a maximum value, and/or by shifting the
    argument by a number of order LambdaQCD.
  * Improved version of DIS kinematics reconstruction. Namely the
    lepton mass is appropriately accounted and phase-space cut for
    Q2min accounts also masses for final-state partons.
  * Introduction of parameters StringFragmentation:eJunctionCutoff
    and StringFragmentation:mJunctionCutoff allows for the
    modification of stopping conditions on the fragmentation of
    the first two junction legs.
  * The default value of StringFragmentation:stopMass has been
    changed from 1.0 GeV to 0.8 GeV, the same value as used in
    PYTHIA 6.4. 
  * Added the Detroit tune (Agu22) to the list of available tune
    presets.
  * RandomState of the random-number generator is now saved before
    the generation of each event starts.
  * Support has been added for parallel running of plugins.
  * New RivetHooks plugin allows for Rivet analyses to be run via
    the plugin structure with Init:plugins =
    {libpythia8rivet.so::RivetHooks}, including in parallel.
  * The new plugin HepMC3Hooks allows users to write output to
    HepMC3 by loading.
  * Added the ability to include purely Pythonic code in the
    pythia8 Python module.
  * Updates to the Hist class:
    - Introduced new methods: getBinCenter(int iBin),
      getBinError(int iBin), and getBinError2(). Equivalent
      versions getBinCenters(), etc., return a vector of doubles
      for all bins.
    - Added an optional third argument to the Hist::fill() method,
      to allow for weighted uncertainties that are not purely
      stochastic. Thanks to Claire Bergman.
    - Added new method Hist::getXPercentile() to extract
      percentiles from histograms.
    - Added the method Hist::yodaTable to enable printing a Hist
      to the ESTIMATE1D_V3 format from YODA.
  * New particle data method(s) mSelInRange selects the mass of a
    particle according to a Breit-Wigner shape, but within a range
    that is determined event-by-event.
  * A small internal analysis of differential jet rates has been
    added to main164. Also, legacy HepMC2 support has been added
    to main164.
  * The SigmaTotal::calc(...) code has been rearranged so as to
    provide a clean abort when the energy is too low, rather than
    a segmentation fault.
  * Moved -pthread option to the Makefile.
  * Updated many of the references to now include hyperlinks to a
    publicly accessible version of the reference.
  * Fixed an issue where the post-hoc and in-situ flavor
    variations for hadronization, see Hadronization Variations,
    did not match if particle decays were turned on, as the
    in-situ weights did not account for flavor variations in the
    hadron decays.
  * Fixed a bug where tuning parameters are incorrectly loaded
    when specified inside a subrun in a .cmnd file.
  * Fix trial hadron generation in
    StringFragmentation::kinematicsHadronTmp used in the
    closepacking and thermal string breaking frameworks.
  * The introduction of StringZ:deriveLundPars inadvertently broke
    the behaviour for when only bLund is derived,
    StringZ:deriveLundPars = 1. This has now been fixed.
  * Fixed the spelling of the addAtribute method of the
    PythiaToHepMC class to addAttribute. Also, added a
    specialization for this method for integer attributes, as is
    already done for double attributes.
  * Fixed an issue with the toString helper method which formatted
    numbers greater than 1e+6 with an exponent ending in zero
    incorrectly, e.g. 1e+10 would be returned as "1e+1".
  * Fixed issue with Settings::readFile where for some systems an
    empty line could cause a std::out_of_range crash.
  * A bug was fixed that led to a pointer to the wrong
    ParticleData object when a Pythia object was created from the
    Settings and ParticleData of another Pythia instance.
  * Tiny cosmetic fix so that a total cross section is not
    attempted to be initialized if not both incoming particles are
    hadrons (or photons). 
- Minor rebase of patches for update:
  * pythia-honour-env-cxxflags.patch
  * pythia-remove-rpaths.patch
- Split off new shared lib packages for new libraries:
  libpythia8hepmc3 and libpythia8rivet (for Leap 16 and newer).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 15 04:20:08 UTC 2025 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.315:
  * Fix bug in the Lund symmetric fragmentation function (LSFF).
    It concerns the case where diquarks or strange quarks are
    assumed to be produced at a later average time than the up and
    down quarks.
  * Some changes in the Hidden Valley machinery. Several automatic
    rescalings of (safety) parameters and constants to allow a
    broader range of HV mass scales, including ones below the QCD
    one.
  * The prefix for custom weights can now be specified with the
    setting Weights:prefix which is by default empty.
  * The logic behind the construction of parton-shower histories
    in CKKW-L merging has been improved.
  * Fixed two bugs in PartonLevel.cc:
    - When checking if beams are point-like (to determine if ISR
      and beam remnants), a lepton check was not performed for the
      second beam (B).
    - An incorrect check was made when calculating maximum weights
      for FSR decays with W/Z.
  * Fixed a rare bug in StringFragmentation::setHadronVertices
    that caused a segmentation fault when the string endpoints are
    c or b quarks, and a quark mass offset correction is
    introduced.
  * Fixed typos in the documentation for Hadronization Variations
    that do not effect that results of Pythia.
  * Reverted beam particles back to raw pointers for technical
    reasons.
  * An incorrect type declaration in 8.314 invalidated the new
    option to derive the a and b parameters from the average and
    RMS width of the Lund FF, causing this option to fail for any
    choice of input parameters, corrected now.
  * Fixed a typo in the MPI initialization when using saved grid
    which caused an out-of-access memory read.
- Minor re-base of reproducible.patch for update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 10 18:39:27 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.311:
  * Too many changes to list, see https://pythia.org/history/.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 26 22:12:11 UTC 2023 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.310:
  * Production of quarkonia is now available via the simple
    timelike shower, see Onia Showers for details.
  * Added a new feature that allows producing user-defined
    resonances in hadronic rescattering. Newly added particles can
    be produced as resonances if they set varWidth = on.
  * A number of changes have been made to the heavy ion machinery.
  * Included possibility to sample intermediate photon virtuality
    also for externally provided events using built-in photon flux
    for protons.
  * Included possibility to generate DIS events with a
    (anti-)neutrino beam.
  * The TopRecoilHook, formerly available separately, has now been
    integrated into the SimpleTimeShower.
  * Introduced a new use plugin system, see Plugins for details.
  * The arguments to the setSigmaPtr method are now shared
    pointers. Additionally, addSigmaPtr has been introduced with
    the previous behaviour of setSigmaPtr, and the new setSigmaPtr
    overrides all previously added pointers.
  * A similar change has been made for the setResonancePtr method
    with the addition of the addResonancePtr method.
  * The new Logger class now handles printing such as
    initialization information and diagnostic messages. For more
    information about this class, see the Logging page.
  * The new BeamSetup class has been introduced to handle the beam
    configuration, including initializing and changing beam
    identities, kinematics and parton distributions.
  * Modified interface to LHAPDF6 to allow for multi-threading.
  * Updated the Python interface to use pybind11 version 2.10.4
    which is compatible with Python 3.11.
  * Fix for the Python interface working with gcc13.
  * Fixed a bug in the Python interface which prevented main162.py
    from running correctly when passing a custom function for
    initialization.
  * Updated the Lambda_b0 lifetime to c*tau = 0.44 mm. The value
    was rounded to two significant digits since PDG and HFLAV do
    not quite agree to three digits.
  * Included several small fixes in response to running an LLVM
    static code analysis.
  * Fixed out-of-range access when calling Hist::getYMin and
    Hist::getYMax for a histogram that has not been booked.
  * Fixed BeamRemnants:unresolvedHadron option that was broken and
    had no effect since 8.307.
  * Removed use of simple-template-ids in SusyLesHouches.h to make
    compliant with C++20.
  * Fixed dipole sorting behaviour in ColourReconnection which
    resulted in an ordering that depended on the current memory
    state of the program.
  * Changed the default for Parallelism:balanceLoad to on and
    updated the documentation. This ensures each thread will
    always generate the same number of events.
  * Added the += notation for settings vectors, as well as the
    include = fileName directive, which allows for additional
    settings files to be directly read in.
  * Fixed a bug in the bookkeeping the number of hadrons in the
    string fragmentation.
- Major rebase of pythia-remove-rpaths.patch for updated version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 27 23:05:39 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.307:
  * Extensions to the hadronic cross sections and beam types used
    for hadronic rescattering and cascades in the atmosphere.
  * Improvements for hidden valley scenarios.
  * A new framework for parallelisation (in addition to the
    existing openMP option).
  * A number of other technical improvements and bug fixes (full
    list here: https://pythia.org/history/index.html).
- Minor rebase of patches to apply cleanly, without fuzz.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  5 16:00:14 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Drop HepMC2 dependency and build without hepmc2 support; largely
  superseded by HepMC(3) and this change allows Leap 15.x builds
  to proceed without HepMC2-HepMC conflicts.
- Add BuildRequires: fastjet-plugin-siscone-devel which is needed
  for one of the tests (test number 111).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 12 21:15:04 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.306:
  * Fixed the incorrect scale being set when applying the POWHEG
    veto, i.e. main31.cc. Note that the number of emissions is
    correct in 8.303, but is incorrect in 8.304 and 8.305.
  * Fixed repeated initialization causing an ever expanding
    physics pointer list in the main Pythia class.
  * Fixed issue for HepMC output from Vincia, which would
    previously issue warnings about inconsistent mother/daughter
    relationships.
  * Removed assert statements from Angantyr.
  * Shortened Pythia constructor header.
- Rebase pythia-honour-env-cxxflags.patch and
  pythia-makefile-destdir-support.patch to apply cleanly.
- Major rebase of pythia-remove-rpaths.patch for updated version.
- Drop patch not required any more:
  * pythia-disable-example23-req-MixMax_h.patch: Examples can now
    be disabled by passing options to the run script.
- Change BuildRequires to pkgconfig based ones wherever
  appropriate. 
- More examples need linking against gmp explicitly: add fixes for
  all necessary examples to patch pythia-example71-link-gmp.patch
  and rename it to pythia-examples-link-gmp.patch.
- Build with Rivet and HepMC(3) support: add HepMC-devel,
  pkgconfig(rivet) BuildRequires.
- Update URL and source URL in keeping with upstream.
- Minor improvements to package summaries.
- Run spec-cleaner for minor cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  3 17:56:27 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.245:
  * Significant speedup of parton distribution handling.
  * Several fixes to avoid out-of-bound evaluation of vectors in
    the merging code.
  * Several fixes to correctly handle CKKW-L merging of EWkino-
    and higgsino-processes have been included.
  * Include the functionality for MC@NLO-Delta matching with
    aMC@NLO.
  * Further bug fixes for the hard process name handling for
    weak-boson-fusion-like processes, that led to an incorrect
    counting of additional emissions.
  * Small fixes to history construction in the presence of
    multiple resonances.
  * The primordial kT for LHE files is now set by the
    BeamRemnants:primordialKThard average value, rather than the
    LHE scale, since the latter may be quite low e.g. in the
    POWHEG approach.
  * The problem of "dangling" gluons causing changing color flows
    in SimpleTimeShower for top decays is now fixed.
  * Extra check added to SimpleSpaceShower for the case where a
    small daughter PDF value can lead to an infinite loop if PDF
    variations are switched on.
  * Bug fixed in the new possibility to let particles with narrow
    widths (such as onia states) obtain a simple Breit-Wigner
    distribution, specifically for MPIs, introduced in 8.240.
  * An indexing bug, for the scattering lepton in DIS events with
    photon radiation allowed, has been fixed.
  * Added a few copy constructors to match corresponding
    assignment operators, to avoid warnings for some compilers.
  * Small fix in cross section calculation of main89.cc.
  * Fixes in configure and examples/Makefile to have ROOT examples
    work again.
  * main**.cmnd, ** = 81-84, 87-88 have been slightly modified
    such that linking to LHAPDF6 is not required by default.
  * A bug in the XML-to-HTML conversion has led to the
    indiscriminate removal of "more" from the HTML manual, notably
    in Pythia::moreDecays().
- Add patches:
  * pythia-example71-link-gmp.patch: Fix building example 71 by
    adding -lgmp to the linker flag.
  * pythia-disable-example23-req-MixMax_h.patch: Drop a test that
    requires the non-free MixMax.h header (which we delete).
- Use autopatch to setup source dir and apply patches
  automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  1 11:10:02 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 8.244:
  * The combination of weight variations, within the context of
    uncertainty bands, has not been well documented and therefore
    prone to misunderstandings. Now the behaviour of
    Info::getGroupWeight() has been made transparent, and the
    documentation in Variations has been improved. The main121.cc
    example has been modified accordingly.
  * Restore the capability to set width and lifetime of a
    resonance separately (see change in 8.240). Now the lifetime
    is set from the width only if the allowCalc() method of the
    resonance class returns true.
  * Updated handling of Powheg files, such that files with
    multiple/variable number of real emissions can be handled. The
    default value of the POWHEG:nFinalparameter has been changed
    to -1, see the POWHEG Merging documentation.
  * Limit the amount by which transverse smearing of the
    space-time quark-antiquark string breakup vertices can give
    large shifts, which may translate into unreasonably long
    invariant times being assigned to primary hadron production
    vertices. This is regulated by the new HadronVertex:maxSmear
    parameter. Even so, large hadron production invariant times
    may still occur occasionally by imperfections in the
    reconstruction around multiple gluon corners, so
    HadronVertex:maxTau gives the possibility to reject the
    hadrons of such a parton system and try again. Also some other
    related changes.
  * Fixes for consistent storage of production vertices in units
    of mm. Thanks to Christopher Plumberg.
  * Number of weights in info reset to 1 for each new init call.
- Drop manual fixes in specfile that are no longer needed:
  * No unusual hidden files to delete.
  * Buildroot doesn't get copied into config files.
  * No more spurious exec permissions in plain files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  needed when compiling against LHAPDF >= 6.2.
- Remove unnecessary hidden files not cleaned up by build.
- Cleanups using spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 30 22:09:08 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.235:
  + See
    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia82html/UpdateHistory.html
- Rebase pythia-remove-rpaths.patch 
- Drop bundled header file MixMax.h which is not used by pythia
  directly and violates GPL copyright.
- Update License to GPL-2.0-or-later in keeping with upstream
  change.
- Use %%license to install COPYING file instead of %%doc.
- Remove no-longer needed post-install mosifications:
  + The correct permission for pythia8-config binary is set by
    install script; stop setting it manually
  + Rpaths are already removed from the shared libraries; don't
    execute chrpath to do this. Also drop BuildRequires: chrpath.
  + Don't remove non-existent backup file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 10:20:22 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.230:

    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html.
- Drop python-dont-force-std-cxx98.patch, incorporated into
  upstream sources.
- Rebase existing patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 31 22:16:11 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

  against HepMC-devel >= 3. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 31 16:21:15 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.226:
  + See list of changes at:
    http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia82html/UpdateHistory.html
- Rebase patches for update.
- Add python-dont-force-std-cxx98.patch to prevent usage of
  --std=c++98 and instead inherit default compiler flags; using
  c++98 causes conflicts with dependencies such as fastjet which
  are built using default compiler std, leading to build failures
  for openSUSE > 1320 (where fastjet is compiled with --std=c+=14
  support). Tests in the check section show that this does not
  have any untoward repercussions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  5 16:42:33 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

    or locally at
    /usr/share/doc/packages/pythia/htmldoc/UpdateHistory.html.
- Pass "-std=c++14" to CXXFLAGS as it is required for building
  with fastjet support.
- Move installation of shell env definitions to %install section;
  this avoids an rpmlint warning and is a better place to do the
  installation rather than the %build section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  1 13:06:18 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

  issue (mentioned in previous entry) for all cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  2 03:22:30 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update pythia-honour-env-cxxflags.patch to fix a minor issue
  with the pythia8-config script when system CXXFLAGS are passed
  during compilation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 23:52:54 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Fix the location pointed to by PYTHIA8DATA env variable saved in
  /etc/profile.d/pythia.*; remove %{appname} macro as nothing uses
  it any more.
- Use %configure instead of ./configure (remove duplicate
  specification of "--prefix=PATH").
- Add pythia-honour-env-cxxflags.patch to allow compilation with
  CXXFLAGS set by env appended to default compilation flags; this
  allows the build to honour RPM_OPT_FLAGS.
- Fix some unusual characters in the descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 11:44:09 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Verify installation by running select bundled tests in a %check
  section.

- Change postinstall scripts to run ldconfig directly 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 05:18:52 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 8.210:  
  + Bug fix in CKKW-L merging for LHE files, such that the
    factorization and renormalization scales are set by the SCALUP
    value if the muf2 and mur2 LHEF3 attributes have not been set,
    and the user has not set any explicit values; this change
    restores the PYTHIA 8.1 behaviour.
  + Various technical improvements in the machinery for hard
    diffraction.
  + Correct quark flavour selection when a string spanned directly
    between two junctions is split up.
  + Check that SK-I and SK-II colour reconnection machineries only
    are called for event topologies they are set up to handle.
  + Bug fixes in partial widths of the W' boson. Results are
    correct when the W' is a simply rescaled copy of the W, but
    not for more general couplings. Thanks to Mihail Chizhov.
  + Minor fix in default location of PDF data files in the
    constructors. No practical consequence since correct
    non-default values are used.
  + Tiny fix in the configure script, so that CXX options
    containing an equal sign are parsed correctly.
- Changes from version 8.202 through 8.209:
  + See /usr/share/doc/packages/pythia/htmldoc/UpdateHistory.html.
- Add pythia-makefile-destdir-support.patch to enable DESTDIR
  support in the Makefile; makes configure stage buildroot-free
  and prevents an ugly BUILDROOT trace in the shlib.
- Enable additional bindings now that all necessary deps are in
  Factory; new subpackage: libpythia8lhapdf6.
- Add BuildRequires: chrpath; required to cleanup rpath in
  libpythia8lhapdf6.so.

- Update to version 8.201:
  + Undocumented changes
- Changes from version 8.200:
  + Long list of changes, see announcement here:
    https://www.hepforge.org/lists-archive/pythia8-announce/2014/000009.html
- Packaging changes:
  + Rename pythia-libs to libpythia8 to satisfy rpmlint (although
    the package only includes one unversioned shlib)
  + Documentation files moved from toplevel dir in source to
    "share" subdir, adapt specfile accordingly
  + pythia8-config.in is now replaced by the script pythia8-config
    and does not require any tweaking in specfile to get right
    paths
  + configure options changed, allowing to automatically install
    to libdir where it needed to be manually copied to /usr/lib64
    for the x86_64 arch
  + Package new headers directory: %{_includedir}/Pythia8Plugins/
  + Package new pdf documentation: %{_docdir}/%{name}/pdfdoc/.

- Update to version 8.186:
  + New user hook to help experimentation with colour
    reconnection, in particular in relation to resonance decays
  + New set of parameters StringFlav:probQQ1toQQ0join, used to
    pick diquark spin when two already produced quarks are to be
    joined into a diquark
  + Possibility to map the bookkeeping of exotic unresolved
    incoming beams in Les Houches event files onto neutrino beams,
    see LesHouches:idRenameBeams; primarily intended for dark
    matter annihilation
  + A correction to the graviton (G^*) + parton hard processes
    (5003-5005) to account for off-shell G^* production; the
    previous formula assumed the graviton was on-shell and
    could greatly overestimate the low-mass tail of the G^*.
  + Bug fixes in examples/JetMatching.h, for uninitialized
    boolean, and number of partons to match for heavy flavour
    handling. The former bug was introduced with the new
    matching schemes in version 8.185 and affected matching to
    ALPGEN, since no events were rejected
  + Differentiate the reading of ALPGEN masses, so that vanishing
    c or b masses in ALPGEN are not unwittingly used where
    inappropriate; also protect the c and b masses from being set
    too low in TimeShower and SpaceShower, so that flavour
    thresholds are not messed up
  + Reduce number of maximum violation warnings in SpaceShower by
    leaving some headroom for branching weights
  + Bug fix that hasVetoed in Pythia.cc was not reset correctly in
    some specific cases
  + Bug fix in PartonLevel.cc where a reference could become
    invalid
  + Improvements and bug fixes in junction handling
  + Bug fix to not reuse colour indices in double diffraction
  + Bug fix in the calculation of the average mass threshold of
    open decay channels of a resonance; reduced
    ResonanceWidths::MASSMIN parameter value.
  + Correct typo in left-right symmetry documentation
  + Other minor fixes.
