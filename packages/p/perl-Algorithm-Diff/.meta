  <title>Compute 'Intelligent' Differences Between Two Files or Lists</title>
  <description>This is a module for computing the difference between two files, two
strings, or any other two lists of things.  It uses an intelligent
algorithm similar to (or identical to) the one used by the Unix &quot;diff&quot;
program.  It is guaranteed to find the *smallest possible* set of
differences.</description>
