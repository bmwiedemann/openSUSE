          - made the exported is_Foo and to_Foo subs much faster, especially for
            type constraints which can be inlined. (Dave Rolsky)

          - reverted is_Foo and to_Foo refactoring [from 0.47] for now, so they

  0.47      2016-12-07 00:40:34Z

            combined with MooseX::Types::Combine. (GH #1, Mark Fowler).
          - made the exported is_Foo and to_Foo subs much faster, especially for
            type constraints which can be inlined [reverted in 0.48]

- updated to 0.44
         - full respect for namespaces: declared types are now properly
           installed into the proper package, so they survive
           namespace::autoclean; however, types imported from the declaration
           class are still properly cleaned by namespace::autoclean (as
           implemented in trial versions 0.40-0.43)
         - line numbers in shipped code are now almost the same (within 3) as
           the repository source, for easier debugging
         - skipped new namespacing tests that fail with older Moose versions,
           due to an inability to install blessed subs
         - declared (not imported) types are now properly installed into the
           proper package, so they survive namespace::autoclean (fixed this
           time)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  9 13:31:11 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.41
        - reversed changes in 0.40, until compatibility issues with older
          Moose versions are figured out
        - types are now properly installed into the proper package, so they
          survive namespace::autoclean

- updated to 0.35
     - The new delegation code could fail when a type had no
       parent. Attempting to subtype Any was one way to trigger the
       bug. (Dave Rolsky)
     - The new delegation code broke calling ->can or ->isa on
       MooseX::Types::TypeDecorator as a class method. (Dave Rolsky)
     - Special case new to avoid unexpected exceptions on unloaded classes
     - Switch delegation order to prioritise type over class except for new
     - Support delegation of methods to the class for class types
     - Factor out _try_delegate method

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to 0.30:
    - Fix a bug in the tests that caused failures with Moose HEAD. (doy)
    - Require namespace::clean 0.19. Tests fail with 0.18. Reported by
      Ruslan Zakirov. RT #67923.
    - Fixed git and bug tracking info in META.{yml,json}. Reported by

- update to 0.27:
  - A better fix for type constraint changes in Moose 2.0100. (doy)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 05 21:17:24 UTC 2011 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.26:
  * small changes for forward compatibility with Moose 2.0100, when it is
    released
  * some small doc cleanup and improvements

- changes from 0.25:
  * the test suite now uses Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception
  * modernized tests to use Test::Requires and done_testing
  * MooseX::Types::Combine is a little more efficient, and only tries to load
    the libraries it's combining when that list is set. It also checks that
    each lib in the list actually provides types


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  1 13:33:58 UTC 2010 - coolo@novell.com

- switch to perl_requires macro

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  4 21:58:21 UTC 2010 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 0.24 (no user-visible changes)

- changes from 0.22:
  * ypdate docs to mention MRO::Compat rather than Class::C3
  * added '0+' overloading to solve the type constraint equality regression introduced when Moose 1.05 tightened the rules determing type constraint equality

- changes from 0.21:
  * attempting to import a non-existent type from a combined type library gave a very confusing error message from the MooseX::Types::Combined internals. Now it gives you a much more useful message
  * bump up Moose dep (RT#53016)
