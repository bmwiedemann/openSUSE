%description
Mojo::Redis is a Redis driver that use the Mojo::IOLoop, which makes it
integrate easily with the Mojolicious framework.

It tries to mimic the same interface as Mojo::Pg, Mojo::mysql and
Mojo::SQLite, but the methods for talking to the database vary.

This module is in no way compatible with the 1.xx version of Mojo::Redis
and this version also tries to fix a lot of the confusing methods in
Mojo::Redis2 related to pubsub.

This module is currently EXPERIMENTAL, and bad design decisions will be
fixed without warning. Please report at
https://github.com/jhthorsen/mojo-redis/issues if you find this module
useful, annoying or if you simply find bugs. Feedback can also be sent to
'jhthorsen@cpan.org'.
