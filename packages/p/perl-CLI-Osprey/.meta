  <title>MooX::Options + MooX::Cmd + Sanity</title>
  <description>CLI::Osprey is a module to assist in writing commandline applications with M* OO modules (Moose, Moo, Mo). With it, you structure your app as one or more modules, which get instantiated with the commandline arguments as attributes. Arguments are parsed using Getopt::Long::Descriptive, and both long and short help messages as well as complete manual pages are automatically generated. An app can be a single command with options, or have sub-commands (like 'git'). Sub-commands can be defined as modules (with options of their own) or as simple coderefs.
