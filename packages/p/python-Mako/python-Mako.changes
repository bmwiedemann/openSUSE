Sat Dec  3 03:26:25 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to 1.2.4 
  [bug] [codegen] Fixed issue where unpacking nested tuples in a for loop using would raise a
  "couldn't apply loop context" error if the loop context was used. The regex
  used to match the for loop expression now allows the list of loop variables
  to contain parenthesized sub-tuples. Pull request courtesy Matt Trescott.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 19:44:07 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.2.3:
  * Fixed issue in lexer in the same category as that of :ticket:`366` where
    the regexp used to match an end tag didn't correctly organize for matching
    characters surrounded by whitespace, leading to high memory / interpreter
    hang if a closing tag incorrectly had a large amount of unterminated space
    in it. Credit to Sebastian Chnelik for locating the issue.
  * As Mako templates inherently render and directly invoke arbitrary Python
    code from the template source, it is **never** appropriate to create
    templates that contain untrusted input.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 11 07:28:33 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.2.2:
  * Fixed issue in lexer where the regexp used to match tags would not
    correctly interpret quoted sections individually 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 18 13:39:44 UTC 2022 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 1.2.1:
  * [bug] [tests] Various fixes to the test suite in the area of exception
    message rendering to accommodate for variability in Python versions as
    well as Pygments.
  * [performance] Optimized some codepaths within the lexer/Python code
    generation process, improving performance for generation of templates
    prior to their being cached. Pull request courtesy Takuto Ikuta.
  * [changed] [py3k] Corrected "universal wheel" directive in setup.cfg so
    that building a wheel does not target Python 2.
  * [changed] [py3k] The bytestring_passthrough template argument is removed,
    as this flag only applied to Python 2.
  * [changed] [py3k] With the removal of Python 2's cStringIO, Mako now uses
    its own internal FastEncodingBuffer exclusively.
  * [changed] Refactored test utilities into mako.testing module. Removed
    unittest.TestCase dependency in favor of pytest.
  * [changed] [setup] Replaced the use of pkg_resources with the importlib
    library. For Python < 3.8 the library importlib_metadata is used.
  * [changed] [py3k] Removed support for Python 2 and Python 3.6. Mako now
    requires Python >= 3.7.
  * [bug] [py3k] Mako now performs exception chaining using raise from,
    correctly identifying underlying exception conditions when it raises its
    own exceptions. Pull request courtesy Ram Rachum.

 * Replaced usage of the long-superseded “parser.suite” module in the mako.util
   package for parsing the python magic encoding comment with the “ast.parse” function
 * Added “babel” and “lingua” dependency entries to the setuptools entrypoints
   for the babel and lingua extensions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  5 11:42:51 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.1.0
  * Removed the "python setup.py test" feature in favor
  * Replaced usage of ``inspect.getfullargspec()`` with the vendored version
    used by SQLAlchemy, Alembic to avoid future deprecation warnings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 07:36:52 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.0.14
  * The n filter is now supported in the <%page> tag. This allows a template to omit the default expression filters throughout a whole template, for those cases where a
    template-wide filter needs to have default filtering disabled.
  * Fixed issue where the correct file URI would not be shown in the template-formatted exception traceback if the template filename were not known. Additionally fixes an issue
    where stale filenames would be displayed if a stack trace alternated between different templates.
  * Improved the line-number tracking for source lines inside of Python <% ... %> blocks, such that text- and HTML-formatted exception traces such as that of
    html_error_template() now report the correct source line inside the block, rather than the first line of the block itself. Exceptions in <%! ... %> blocks which get raised
    while loading the module are still not reported correctly, as these are handled before the Mako code is generated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 18 08:40:22 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.12:
  * Fixed regression where import refactors in Mako 1.0.11 caused broken imports on Python 3.8.
  * Updated for additional project metadata in setup.py. Additionally, the code has been reformatted using Black and zimports.

Fri Feb 10 16:06:00 UTC 2017 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to version 1.0.6
  * [feature] Added new parameter Template.include_error_handler .
    This works like Template.error_handler but indicates the
    handler should take place when this template is included within
    another template via the <%include> tag. Pull request courtesy
    Huayi Zhang.
  * [bug] Updated the Sphinx documentation builder to work with recent
    versions of Sphinx.

Fri Sep 16 04:04:40 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- update to version 1.0.4:
  * [test] [feature] The default test runner is now py.test. Running
    “python setup.py test” will make use of py.test instead of
    nose. nose still works as a test runner as well, however.
  * [lexer] [bug] Major improvements to lexing of intricate Python
    sections which may contain complex backslash sequences, as well as
    support for the bitwise operator (e.g. pipe symbol) inside of
    expression sections distinct from the Mako “filter” operator,
    provided the operator is enclosed within parentheses or
    brackets. Pull request courtesy Daniel Martin.
  * [feature] Added new method Template.list_defs(). Pull request
    courtesy Jonathan Vanasco.
- update to version 1.0.3:
  * Fixed an issue where the Babel plugin would not handle a
    translation symbol that contained non-ascii characters. Pull
    request courtesy Roman Imankulov.
- Update to version 1.0.2
  * The "universal wheel" marker is removed from setup.cfg, because
    our setup.py currently makes use of conditional dependencies.
    In :ticket:`249`, the discussion is ongoing on how to correct our
    setup.cfg / setup.py fully so that we can handle the per-version
    dependency changes while still maintaining optimal wheel settings,
    so this issue is not yet fully resolved.
  * Repair some calls within the ast module that no longer work on Python3.5;
    additionally replace the use of ``inspect.getargspec()`` under
    Python 3 (seems to be called from the TG plugin) to avoid deprecation
    warnings.
  * Update the Lingua translation extraction plugin to correctly
    handle templates mixing Python control statements (such as if,
    for and while) with template fragments. Pull request courtesy
    Laurent Daverio.
  * Added ``STOP_RENDERING`` keyword for returning/exiting from a
    template early, which is a synonym for an empty string ``""``.
    Previously, the docs suggested a bare
    ``return``, but this could cause ``None`` to appear in the
    rendered template result.

- update to 0.9.1:
  - [bug] Fixed bug in Babel plugin where translator comments
    would be lost if intervening text nodes were encountered.
    Fix courtesy Ned Batchelder.  [ticket:225]
  
  - [bug] Fixed TGPlugin.render method to support unicode template
    names in Py2K - courtesy Vladimir Magamedov.
  
  - [bug] Fixed an AST issue that was preventing correct operation
    under alpha versions of Python 3.4.  Pullreq courtesy Zer0-.
  
  - [bug] Changed the format of the "source encoding" header output
    by the code generator to use the format ``# -*- coding:%s -*-``
    instead of ``# -*- encoding:%s -*-``; the former is more common
    and compatible with emacs.  Courtesy Martin Geisler.
  
  - [bug] Fixed issue where an old lexer rule prevented a template line
    which looked like "#*" from being correctly parsed.  [ticket:224]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  3 08:20:48 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.9.0:
  - [bug] The Context.locals_() method becomes a private underscored
    method, as this method has a specific internal use. The purpose
    of Context.kwargs has been clarified, in that it only delivers
    top level keyword arguments originally passed to template.render().
    [ticket:219]
  
  - [bug] Fixed the babel plugin to properly interpret ${} sections
    inside of a "call" tag, i.e. <%self:some_tag attr="${_('foo')}"/>.
    Code that's subject to babel escapes in here needs to be
    specified as a Python expression, not a literal.  This change
    is backwards incompatible vs. code that is relying upon a _('')
    translation to be working within a call tag.
  
  - [bug] The Babel plugin has been repaired to work on Python 3.
    [ticket:187]
  
  - [bug] Using <%namespace import="*" module="somemodule"/> now
    skips over module elements that are not explcitly callable,
    avoiding TypeError when trying to produce partials.
    [ticket:207]
  
  - [bug] Fixed Py3K bug where a "lambda" expression was not
    interpreted correctly within a template tag; also
    fixed in Py2.4.  [ticket:190]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 11:58:53 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.8.1:
 - [bug] Changed setup.py to skip installing markupsafe
   if Python version is < 2.6 or is between 3.0 and
   less than 3.3, as Markupsafe now only supports 2.6->2.X,
   3.3->3.X. [ticket:216]
 
 - [bug] Fixed regression where "entity" filter wasn't
   converted for py3k properly (added tests.)
   [ticket:214]
 
 - [bug] Fixed bug where mako-render script wasn't
   compatible with Py3k.  [ticket:212]
 
 - [bug] Cleaned up all the various deprecation/
   file warnings when running the tests under
   various Pythons with warnings turned on.
   [ticket:213]
 
 - [feature] Performance improvement to the
   "legacy" HTML escape feature, used for XML
   escaping and when markupsafe isn't present,
   courtesy George Xie.
 
 - [bug] Fixed bug whereby an exception in Python 3
   against a module compiled to the filesystem would
   fail trying to produce a RichTraceback due to the
   content being in bytes. [ticket:209]
 
 - [bug] Change default for compile()->reserved_names
   from tuple to frozenset, as this is expected to be
   a set by default.  [ticket:208]
 
 - [feature] Code has been reworked to support Python 2.4->
   Python 3.xx in place.  2to3 no longer needed.
 
 - [feature] Added lexer_cls argument to Template,
   TemplateLookup, allows alternate Lexer classes
   to be used.
 
 - [feature] Added future_imports parameter to Template
   and TemplateLookup, renders the __future__ header
   with desired capabilities at the top of the generated
   template module.  Courtesy Ben Trofatter.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 22 14:53:41 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 0.7.3:
  + [bug] legacy_html_escape function, used when
    Markupsafe isn't installed, was using an inline-compiled
    regexp which causes major slowdowns on Python 3.3;
    is now precompiled.
  + [bug] AST supporting now supports tuple-packed
    function arguments inside pure-python def
    or lambda expressions.
  + [bug] Fixed Py3K bug in the Babel extension.
  + [bug] Fixed the "filter" attribute of the
    <%text> tag so that it pulls locally specified
    identifiers from the context the same
    way as that of <%block> and <%filter>.
  + [bug] Fixed bug in plugin loader to correctly
    raise exception when non-existent plugin
    is specified.
- Changes from version 0.7.2:
  + [bug] Fixed regression in 0.7.1 where AST
    parsing for Py2.4 was broken.
- Changes from version 0.7.1:
  + [feature] Control lines with no bodies will
    now succeed, as "pass" is added for these
    when no statements are otherwise present.
  + [bug] Fixed some long-broken scoping behavior
    involving variables declared in defs and such,
    which only became apparent when
    the strict_undefined flag was turned on.
  + [bug] Can now use strict_undefined at the
    same time args passed to def() are used
    by other elements of the <%def> tag.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 23 05:57:47 UTC 2012 - highwaystar.ru@gmail.com

- python3 package added 
- Update to 0.7.0
  - Added new "loop" variable to templates, is provided within a % 
    for block to provide info about the loop such as index, 
    first/last, odd/even, etc.  A migration path is also provided 
    for legacy templates via the "enable_loop" argument available 
    on Template, TemplateLookup, and <%page>. 
  - Added a real check for "reserved" names, that is names which 
    are never pulled from the context and cannot be passed to the 
    template.render() method.  Current names are "context", "loop",
    "UNDEFINED".
  - The html_error_template() will now apply Pygments highlighting 
    to the source code displayed in the traceback, if Pygments if 
    available.
  - Added support for context managers, 
    i.e. "% with x as e:/ % endwith" support.
  - Added class-level flag to CacheImpl "pass_context"; when True, 
    the keyword argument 'context' will be passed to 
    get_or_create() containing the Mako Context object.
  - Added Jinja2 to the example benchmark suite
  - Bugfixes
- Update to 0.6.2
  - Bugfixes
- Update to 0.6.1
  - Bugfixes
- Update to 0.6.0
  - Template caching has been converted into a plugin system, 
    whereby the usage of Beaker is just the default plugin. 
    Template and TemplateLookup now accept a string "cache_impl" 
    parameter which refers to the name of a cache plugin, 
    defaulting to the name 'beaker'. New plugins can be registered 
    as pkg_resources entrypoints under the group "mako.cache", or 
    registered directly using mako.cache.register_plugin().  The 
    core plugin is the mako.cache.CacheImpl class.
  - Added support for Beaker cache regions in templates. Usage of 
    regions should be considered as superseding the very obsolete 
    idea of passing in backend options, timeouts, etc. within 
    templates.
  - The 'put' method on Cache is now 'set'. 'put' is there for 
    backwards compatibility.
  - The <%def>, <%block> and <%page> tags now accept any argument 
    named "cache_*", and the key minus the "cache_" prefix will be 
    passed as keyword arguments to the CacheImpl methods.
  - Template and TemplateLookup now accept an argument cache_args, 
    which refers to a dictionary containing cache parameters. The 
    cache_dir, cache_url, cache_type, cache_timeout arguments are 
    deprecated (will probably never be removed, however) and can be
    passed now as cache_args={'url':<some url>, 'type':'memcached',
    'timeout':50, 'dir':'/path/to/some/directory'}
  - Can now refer to context variables within extra arguments to 
    <%block>, <%def>, 
    i.e. <%block name="foo" cache_key="${somekey}">. Filters can 
    also be used in this way, 
    i.e. <%def name="foo()" filter="myfilter"> then 
    template.render(myfilter=some_callable)
  - Added "--var name=value" option to the mako-render script, 
    allows passing of kw to the template from the command line.
  - Added module_writer argument to Template, TemplateLookup, 
    allows a callable to be passed which takes over the writing of 
    the template's module source file, so that special 
    environment-specific steps can be taken.

  * Fixed the babel plugin to accommodate <%block> [ticket:169]
- Simpler spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  1 18:24:17 UTC 2010 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 0.3.4
  - Now using MarkupSafe for HTML escaping,
    i.e. in place of cgi.escape().  Faster
    C-based implementation and also escapes
    single quotes for additional security.
    Supports the __html__ attribute for
    the given expression as well.

    When using "disable_unicode" mode,
    a pure Python HTML escaper function
    is used which also quotes single quotes.

    Note that Pylons by default doesn't
    use Mako's filter - check your
    environment.py file.

  - Fixed call to "unicode.strip" in
    exceptions.text_error_template which
    is not Py3k compatible.  [ticket:137]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 12:26:28 UTC 2009 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 0.2.5
  - Added a "decorator" kw argument to <%def>, allows custom decoration
    functions to wrap rendering callables.  Mainly intended for custom caching
    algorithms, not sure what other uses there may be (but there may be).
    Examples are in the "filtering" docs.
  - When Mako creates subdirectories in which to store templates, it uses the
    more permissive mode of 0775 instead of 0750, helping out with certain
    multi-process scenarios. Note that the mode is always subject to the
    restrictions of the existing umask. [ticket:101]
  - Fixed namespace.__getattr__() to raise AttributeError on attribute not
    found instead of RuntimeError.  [ticket:104]
  - Added last_modified accessor to Template, returns the time.time() when the
    module was created. [ticket:97]
  - Fixed lexing support for whitespace around '=' sign in defs. [ticket:102]
  - Removed errant "lower()" in the lexer which was causing tags to compile
    with case-insensitive names, thus messing up custom <%call> names.
    [ticket:108]
  - added "mako.__version__" attribute to the base module.  [ticket:110]
