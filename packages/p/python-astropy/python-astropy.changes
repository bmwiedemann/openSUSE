- Update to 6.1.0
  ## Highlights
  * Updated minimum Python version to 3.10
  * Order-dependent angular separations now come with warnings
  * io.ascii uses 64-integers by default for integer columns
  * Changes to semantics of copy= keyword arguments
  * Cosmology is now a dataclass()
  ## New Features
  ### astropy.coordinates
  * BaseCoordinateFrame now has a position_angle() method, which is
    the same as the position_angle method of SkyCoord instances.
    [#15737]
  * By default the SkyCoord and BaseCoordinateFrame separation()
    methods now emit a warning if they have to perform a coordinate
    transformation that is not a pure rotation to inform the user
    that the angular separation can depend on the direction of the
    transformation. It is possible to modify this behaviour with
    the new optional keyword-only origin_mismatch argument.
    Specifying origin_mismatch="ignore" allows any transformation
    to succeed without warning, which has been the behaviour so
    far. origin_mismatch="error" forbids all transformations that
    are not pure rotations. [#16246]
  ### astropy.io.ascii
  * Clearer error message in reading ASCII tables when there is a
    mismatch between converter type and column type. [#15991]
  ### astropy.io.registry
  * The module astropy.io.typing has been added to provide type
    annotations for I/O-related functionality. [#15916]
  ### astropy.samp
  * SAMP web profile CORS HTTP server implements Private Network
    Access proposal. [#16193]
  ### astropy.table
  * Table now has a setdefault() method, analogous to
    dict.setdefault(). [#16188]
  ### astropy.units
  * Added a new module astropy.units.typing that provides support
    for type annotations related to astropy.units. [#15860]
  * Added a new CGS unit Oersted. [#15962]
  * Added “surface brightness”, “surface brightness wav”, “photon
    surface brightness”, and “photon surface brightness wav” to
    recognized physical types. [#16032]
  * Added magnetic helicity as a physical type. [#16101]
  ### astropy.utils
  * For gufuncs on Masked instances, add support for the axes
    argument. [#16121]
  * Masked instances now support the various numpy array set
    operations, such as np.unique and np.isin. [#16224]
  ### astropy.wcs
  * Added support for slicing WCS objects containing cpdis or
    det2im distortions, which previously were ignored. [#16163]
  ## API Changes
  ### astropy.coordinates
  * The astropy.coordinates.transformations module has been
    refactored into a module. There should be no user-visible
    changes, but if you notice any, please open an Issue. [#15895]
  * Changed the default value of the copy argument in
    astropy.coordinates.representation.CylindricalDifferential.__init__
    from False to True, which is the intended behaviour for all
    subclasses of
    astropy.coordinates.representation.BaseDifferential. [#16198]
  ### astropy.cosmology
  * Cosmology and its subclasses are now frozen dataclass objects.
    [#15484]
  * The argument verbose in the function z_at_value is now
    keyword-only. [#15855]
  ### astropy.io.ascii
  * The io.ascii Python and C table readers were updated to use a
    64-bit integer field by default when reading a column of
    integer numeric data. This changes the default behavior on
    Windows and potentially 32-bit architectures. Previously on
    those platforms, table columns with any long integers which
    overflowed the 32-bit integer would be returned as string
    columns. The new default behavior is consistent with numpy v2
    and pandas. [#16005]
  * The parallel fast-reader parser for reading ASCII files has
    been removed. Since astropy v4.0.4 requesting this option has
    issued a warning that this option is broken and that the serial
    parser will be used. The parallel key in the fast_reader
    argument for reading ASCII tables is no longer available.
    [#16103]
  ### astropy.table
  * show_in_notebook is deprecated and it is recommended to use
    dedicated tools in the Jupyter ecosystem to create interactive
    plots in notebooks. [#15905]
  * A warning is now emitted when Quantity values are inserted into
    empty Column objects via Table.insert_row or Table.add_row.
    [#16038]
  * show_in_browser is deprecated (pending feedback from the
    community). Please use astropy/astropy#16067 if you are
    actively using the function. [#16068]
  * TableColumns.setdefault() and TableColumns.update() methods
    (which would typically be called as Table.columns.setdefault()
    and Table.columns.update()) have been deprecated because they
    can easily corrupt the Table instance the TableColumns instance
    is attached to. The Table.setdefault() and Table.update()
    methods are safe. [#16154]
  ### astropy.time
  * TIME_FORMATS and TIME_DELTA_FORMATS in astropy.time.formats are
    changed from OrderedDict to Python dict. [#15491]
  * A FutureWarning is now emitted when mutating Time.location
    post-initialization. [#16063]
  * Following the removal of np.ndarray.ptp in Numpy v2, Time.ptp
    is now deprecated in favor of np.ptp. [#16212]
  ### astropy.units
  * If any iterable such as a list of tuple was input to Quantity,
    a check was done to see if they contained only quantities, and,
    if so, the quantities were concatenated. This makes sense for
    list and tuple, but is not necessarily logical for all
    iterables and indeed was broken for those that do not have a
    length (such as array_api array instances). Hence, the check
    will now be done only for values where it makes sense, i.e.,
    instances of list and tuple. [#15752]
  * Units now exposes get_converter which returns a function that
    will convert a scalar or array from one unit to another. This
    can be useful to speed up code that converts many quantities
    with the same unit to another one, especially if the quantity
    has not many elements, so that the overhead of creating a
    conversion function is relatively large. [#16139]
  ### astropy.utils
  * Deprecate importing ErfaError and ErfaWarning from
    astropy.utils.exceptions. They should be imported directly from
    erfa instead. [#15777]
  * introspection.isinstancemethod() and
    introspection.find_mod_objs() are deprecated. [#15934]
  * astropy.utils.console.terminal_size is now deprecated in favour
    of shutil.get_terminal_size from the standard library. [#16045]
  * indent() is deprecated. Use textwrap.indent() from Python
    standard library instead. [#16223]
  * Unmasked Masked scalar instances are now considered hashable,
    to match the implicit behaviour of regular arrays, where if an
    operation leads to a scalar, a hashable array scalar is
    returned. [#16224]
  ### astropy.visualization
  * Renamed the min_cut and max_cut keywords in simple_norm and
    fits2bitmap to vmin and vmax. The old names are deprecated.
    [#15621]
  * If vmin == vmax, the ImageNormalize class now maps the input
    data to 0. If vmin > vmax, the ImageNormalize class now raises
    a ValueError. [#15622]
  ## Bug Fixes
  ### astropy.convolution
  * Avoid a segfault when calling astropy.convolution.convolve on
    an empty array. An exception is now raised instead. [#15840]
  ### astropy.coordinates
  * Previously passing a SkyCoord instance to the
    BaseCoordinateFrame separation() or separation_3d() methods
    could produce wrong results, depending on what additional frame
    attributes were defined on the SkyCoord, but now SkyCoord input
    can be used safely. [#15659]
  * Distance now accepts as parallax any angle-like value. This
    includes types like Column which have a unit but are not
    Quantity subclasses. [#15712]
  * The new default for the class method SkyCoord.from_name() is to
    look for coordinates first in SIMBAD, then in NED, and then in
    VizieR, instead of having no specific order. [#16046]
  * Fix Angle.to_string() for angles in degrees represented in
    ‘hms’ and angles in hours represented in ‘dms’. [#16085]
  * Fix a bug where SkyCoord.spherical_offsets_by would crash when
    a wrap was needed. [#16241]
  * search_around_3d() now always raises a UnitConversionError if
    the units of the distances in coord1 and coord2 and the unit of
    distlimit do not agree. Previously the error was not raised if
    at least one of the coordinates was empty. [#16280]
  ### astropy.cosmology
  * Fixed a bug where the attribute ParametersAttribute.attr_name
    could be None instead of a string. [#15882]
  ### astropy.io.ascii
  * Reading of CDS header files with multi-line descriptions where
    the continued line started with a number was broken. This is
    now fixed. [#15617]
  * Ensure that the names of mixin columns are properly propagated
    as labels for the MRT format. [#15848]
  * Fixed reading IPAC tables for long column type on some
    platforms, e.g., Windows. [#16005]
  ### astropy.io.fits
  * Avoid WinError 1455 in opening some large files with memory
    mapping on windows. [#15388]
  * Fix TDISP parsing for floating numbers. [#16007]
  * Fix a crash when calling FITS writeto methods with stdout as
    the output stream. [#16008]
  * Fix TDISP parsing for floating numbers in formats ES / EN.
    [#16015]
  * Fix conversion of Table to BinTableHDU with
    character_as_bytes=True. [#16358]
  * Improved error message when instantiating a fits table with an
    ill-formed array. [#16363]
  ### astropy.io.misc
  * Reading an empty table stored in parquet format now creates an
    empty table instead of raising an unexpected error. [#16237]
  ### astropy.io.votable
  * When reading a VOTable, if some user-requested columns were not
    present then the resulting error message previously listed all
    the requested column names. Now only columns that are actually
    missing are shown. [#15956]
  ### astropy.stats
  * Fix a spurious warning when calling sigma_clipped_stats on a
    MaskedColumn. [#15844]
  ### astropy.table
  * Fix a Table bug when setting items (via slice or index list) in
    a bytes type MaskedColumn would cause the column mask to be set
    to all False. A common way to trigger this bug was reading a
    FITS file with masked string data and then sorting the table.
    [#15669]
  * Fix slicing logic for Row. Previously, slicing a
    astropy.table.row.Row object would incorrectly return a column,
    now it correctly returns a list of values from that row.
    [#15733]
  * Fix a ValueError raised by table.join when fed with large
    tables. This would typically happen in situations when the
    result joined table would be too large to fit in memory. In
    those situations, the error message is now much more clearly
    about the necessary memory size. [#15734]
  * Fix an unintended exception being raised when attempting to
    compare two unequal Table instances. [#15845]
  * Ensure that if a Column is initialized with a Quantity it will
    use by default a possible name defined on the quantity’s .info.
    [#15848]
  * Fix a bug where columns with dtype=object wouldn’t be properly
    deep-copied using copy.deepcopy. [#15871]
  * Fix hasattr(Table, "iloc") raising an exception, preventing use
    of tables e.g. with scikit-learn. [#15913]
  * Calling Table.group_by on an empty table no longer raises an
    exception. [#16093]
  * The unit conversion convert_unit_to with MaskedColumn was
    broken as it was storing the old unit in a dictionary attached
    to underlying np.ma.MaskedArray. This fixes it by overwriting
    the old unit after unit conversion. [#16118]
  * astropy.table.vstack will no longer modify the input list even
    when it contains non-Table objects like astropy.table.Row.
    [#16130]
  * Update old dataTables.js version. This should not affect the
    end user. [#16315]
  ### astropy.time
  * Fix comparing NaN Quantity with TimeDelta object. [#15830]
  * Scalar Time instances are now hashable if they are not masked,
    also if one uses Masked internally, matching the behaviour
    prior to astropy 6.0 (and the current behaviour when masking
    using np.ma.MaskedArray). [#16224]
  ### astropy.units
  * Fix rare signature incompatibilities between helper and helped
    array functions. Most involve cases where the corresponding
    numpy function has had its arguments renamed between numpy
    versions. Since all those generally changed the first
    arguments, which are typically passed as positional arguments,
    this should not affect user code. Affected functions: -
    numpy.array_str - numpy.choose - numpy.convolve -
    numpy.correlate - numpy.histogram - numpy.histogramdd -
    numpy.histogram2d - numpy.isin - numpy.inner - numpy.nanmedian
    - numpy.unique - numpy.matrix_rank - numpy.unwrap - numpy.vdot
    - numpy.lib.recfunctions.unstructured_to_structured [#15710]
  * Fix an issue with unicode string representations of units shown
    as superscripts (like degree) when raised to some power. Like
    for LaTeX representations, now the superscript unicode
    character is replaced by the literal short name before adding
    the power. [#15755]
  * Fix a missing Sun unit in the list of VOUnits simple_units.
    [#15832]
  * Fix an unhelpful TypeError when attempting truediv, lshift (<<)
    or mul (*) or truediv (/) with a Unit for right operand and a
    numpy array with non-numerical dtype for left operand. [#15883]
  * Fix write/read roundtrips with empty Table dumped to ECSV.
    [#15885]
  * Fix a bug where LaTeX formatter would return empty strings for
    unity (1) input. [#15923]
  * Fix extraneous space in LaTeX repr for Quantity objects with
    superscript units (e.g. angles or temperatures in degree
    Celsius). [#16043]
  * Ensure powers of units are consistently as simple as possible.
    So, an integer if possible, otherwise a float, or a fraction if
    the float is really close to that. This also ensures the hash
    of a unit is unique for any given unit (previously, the same
    power could be represented as float, int or fraction, which
    made the hash different). [#16058]
  * Ensure that find_equivalent_units only returns actual units,
    not units that raised to some power match the requested one.
    With this fix, (u.m**-3).find_equivalent_units() properly finds
    nothing, rather than all units of length. [#16127]
  * Using a dimensionless Quantity as an exponent works anew. In
    astropy 6.0.1 an exception was erroneously raised. [#16261]
  ### astropy.utils
  * Fix rare signature incompatibilities between helper and helped
    array functions. These typically cover corner cases and should
    not affect user code. Some arguments weren’t being re-exposed
    correctly or at all, depending on numpy’s version. Affected
    functions: - numpy.broadcast_arrays - numpy.median -
    numpy.quantile - numpy.empty_like - numpy.ones_like -
    numpy.zeros_like - numpy.full_like [#16025]
  * Fix a bug where astropy.utils.console.Spinner would leak
    newlines for messages longer than terminal width. [#16040]
  * Update report_diff_values so the diff no longer depends on the
    console terminal size. [#16065]
  * Fix support in Masked for generalized ufuncs with more than a
    single core dimension (such as erfa.rxp). [#16120]
  * Masked array instances now deal more properly with structured
    dtypes, combining field masks to get element masks for
    generalized ufuncs, and allowing .view() any time the mask can
    be viewed as well. This allows a larger number of erfa routines
    to work with masked data. [#16125]
  ### astropy.visualization
  * WCSAxes will correctly set certain defaults when
    wcs.world_axis_physical_types contains custom: prefixes.
    [#15626]
  * Fix an edge case where quantity_support would produce duplicate
    tick labels for small data ranges. [#15841]
  * Fix a bug where AngleFormatterLocator and
    ScalarFormatterLocator wouldn’t respect matplotlib.rc’s
    axes.unicode_minus parameter. [#15902]
  * Fixed a bug in CoordinateHelper.grid method to properly handle
    draw_grid=False and draw_grid=None, ensuring grid lines are
    controlled correctly even when not explicitly called. [#15985]
  ### astropy.wcs
  * Updated bundled WCSLIB version to 8.2.2. This update fixes
    character buffer overflows in the comment string for the
    longitude and latitude axes triggered by some projections in
    wcshdo(), and also the formatting for generic coordinate
    systems. For a full list of changes - see
    http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/CHANGES or
    astropy/cextern/wcslib/CHANGES [#15795]
  * Fixed a bug in fit_wcs_from_points that does not set the
    default value of the cdelt of the returned WCS object. [#16027]
  * Fixed a bug in DistortionLookupTable (which implements cpdis
    and det2im projection corrections to a WCS) in which image
    pixels received an incorrect distortion value, from a location
    in the lookup table incorrectly offset by about 1 table pixel.
    [#16163]
  ## Other Changes and Additions
  * Update minimum supported Python version to 3.10 [#15603]
  * The minimum required NumPy version is now 1.23 and the minimum
    required SciPy version is 1.8. [#15706]
  * Fix loading parser tabs on pyc-only installations.
  * Fix a bug in the wrappers for the lex and yacc wrappers that
    are used for parsing Astropy units so that they work on
    pyc-only installations.
  * According to the Python module loading flow chart, when
    evaluating import foo and foo.py is not found, Python then
    reads foo.pyc.
  * One can take advantage of this fact to strip source files and
    leave only Python bytecode files for deployment
    inspace-constrained execution environments such as AWS Lambda.
    Astropy is now compatible with pyc-only deployments. [#16159]
  * Change the default value of copy arguments in public APIs from
    False to None if Numpy 2.0 or newer is installed. For details,
    see the “Copy semantics” section on the What’s New page for
    Astropy 6.1 . [#16181]

- Update to 6.0.1
  ## Bug Fixes
  ### astropy.coordinates
  * Previously passing a SkyCoord instance to the
    BaseCoordinateFrame separation() or separation_3d() methods
    could produce wrong results, depending on what additional frame
    attributes were defined on the SkyCoord, but now SkyCoord input
    can be used safely. [#15659]
  * Distance now accepts as parallax any angle-like value. This
    includes types like Column which have a unit but are not
    Quantity subclasses. [#15712]
  * The new default for the class method SkyCoord.from_name() is to

  * The new ConfigNamespace.help() method provides a convenient way
    to get information about configuration items. [#13499]
  ### astropy.coordinates
  * Support has been added to create geodetic representations not
    just for existing ellipsoids from ERFA, but also with
    explicitly provided values, by defining a subclass of
    BaseGeodeticRepresentation with the equatorial radius and
    flattening assigned to _equatorial_radius and _flattening
    attributes. [#14763]
  * Add BaseBodycentricRepresentation, a new spheroidal
    representation for bodycentric latitudes and longitudes.
    [#14851]
  * Support Numpy broadcasting over frame data and attributes.
    [#15121]
  ### astropy.cosmology
  * Registered a latex writer for exporting a Cosmology object to a
    LaTex table. [#14701]
  * Added argument rename to Cosmology’s I/O, allowing for input
    and output symbols to be renamed. [#14780]
  * All non-abstract Cosmology subclasses are now automatically
    registered to work with Astropy’s YAML serialization. [#14979]
  * Cosmology I/O now auto-identifies the ‘.tex’ suffix with the
    ‘ascii.latex’ format. [#15088]
  * The Cosmology class now has a new property to access the
    parameters of the cosmology: .parameters. This property return
    a read-only dictionary of all the non-derived parameter values
    on the cosmology object. When accessed from the class (not an
    instance) the dictionary contains Parameter instances, not the
    values. [#15168]
  * The field default has been added to Parameter. This can be used
    to introspect the default value of a parameter on a cosmology
    class e.g. LambdaCDM.H0.default. [#15400]
  ### astropy.io.fits
  * Add new option decompress_in_memory to fits.open, to decompress
    the whole file in memory at once, instead of decompressing the
    file progressively as data is needed. Default behavior is
    better for memory usage but sometimes slow, especially for
    files with many small HDUs. [#15501]
  ### astropy.io.votable
  * Add support for Parquet serialization of VOTables. Writing of
    this serialization is available with using the new
    'votable.parquet' format. [#15281]
  * Added MIVOT feature through the MivotBlock class that allows
    model annotations reading and writing in VOTable. [#15390]
  ### astropy.modeling
  * Added a GeneralSersic2D model that can have “boxy” or “disky”
    isophotes. [#15545]
  ### astropy.nddata
  * A more flexible and/or compact string representation is now
    available for NDData objects which visually indicates masked
    entries, and provides for better for dask array support.
    [#14438]
  ### astropy.table
  * The new Row.get() method, analogous to dict.get(), returns the
    value of the specified column from the row if the column
    present, otherwise it returns a fallback value, which by
    default is None. [#14878]
  ### astropy.time
  * Masked Time instances now use astropy’s own Masked class
    internally. This means that Masked input is now properly
    recognized, and that masks get propagated also to Quantity
    output (such as from a TimeDelta converted to a unit of time),
    creating MaskedQuantity instances. [#15231]
  * Added a TimeDelta format quantity_str that represents the time
    delta as a string with one or more Quantity components. This
    format provides a human-readable multi-scale string
    representation of a time delta. The default output sub-format
    is not considered stable in this release, please see
    astropy/astropy#15485 for more information. [#15264]
  ### astropy.uncertainty
  * Uncertainty Distribution now support structured data types, and
    as a result it now works also with EarthLocation. [#15304]
  * Uncertainty Distribution can now be used inside
    representations, which also allows basic support in SkyCoord.
    While most calculations work, there are remaining issues. For
    instance, the repr does not show that the coordinates are
    distributions. [#15395]
  ### astropy.units
  * Add support for gc2gde and gd2gce erfa functions to allow
    geodetic representations using equatorial radius and
    flattening. [#14729]
  ### astropy.utils
  * The astropy.utils.metadata.MetaData default dictionary can now
    be set with the default_factory keyword argument. [#15265]
  * astropy.utils.decorators.deprecated now adds the __deprecated__
    attribute to the objects it wraps, following the practice in
    https://peps.python.org/pep-0702/. [#15310]
  ### astropy.visualization
  * Add WCSAxes.text_coord method to print text using SkyCoord
    objects parallel to plotting data points with
    WCSAxes.plot_coord. [#14661]
  ### astropy.wcs
  * Support WCS descriptions of basic planetary coordinate frames.
    [#14820]
  * Updated bundled WCSLIB version to 8.1. This update adds support
    planetary keywords A_RADIUS, B_RADIUS, C_RADIUS, BLON_OBS,
    BLAT_OBS, and BDIS_OBS in auxprm and adds wcsprm::time to the
    wcsprm struct to record the TIME axis. This update also
    includes several bug fixes. For a full list of changes - see
    http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/CHANGES [#15035]
  ## API Changes
  ### astropy.config
  * Removed deprecated ConfigurationMissingWarning class and
    update_default_config function; There are no replacements as
    they should no be used anymore. [#15466]
  ### astropy.convolution
  * Invalid kernel arithmetic operations now raise a
    KernelArithmeticError instead of a bare Exception. [#14728]
  * Added base KernelError error class and removed
    DiscretizationError error class (a ValueError will be raised
    instead). [#14732]
  * discretize_model will now raise a ValueError if
    mode='oversample' and factor does not have an integer value.
    [#14794]
  ### astropy.coordinates
  * Removed deprecated angle parsing and formatting utilities from
    angle_utilities. Use the functions from angle_formats instead.
    [#14675]
  * The deprecated functionality of initializing Angle or Longitude
    from a tuple is no longer supported. [#15205]
  * Angle-related classes and functions have been moved within
    astropy.coordinates. There is no change to public API as
    everything moved should still be imported from
    astropy.coordinates, not a sub-module. If you are using private
    API, try importing from astropy.coordinates instead. If you
    need something that has been moved and is not available in
    astropy.coordinates, please open an issue on the Astropy issue
    tracker. [#15220]
  * It is no longer possible to pass frame classes to the
    transform_to() method of a low-level coordinate-frame class. It
    is still possible to pass frame instances. The transform_to()
    method of the high-level SkyCoord class is unaffected. [#15500]
  ### astropy.cosmology
  * Removed support of importing private constants and functions
    from astropy.cosmology.flrw. [#14672]
  * Removed deprecated Cosmology Parameter argument fmt. [#14673]
  * Removed deprecated vectorize_if_needed and inf_like from
    cosmology.utils. [#14677]
  * Removed deprecated import paths from astropy.cosmology.core.
    [#14782]
  * Cosmology Parameter is now a dataclass, and can work with all
    of Python’s dataclasses machinery, like field introspection and
    type conversion. [#14874]
  * A new property – scale_factor0 – has been added to Cosmology
    objects. This is the scale factor at redshift 0, and is defined
    to be 1.0. [#14931]
  * Added registration label ascii.latex to Cosmology IO. [#14938]
  * The private module astropy.cosmology.utils has been deprecated.
    [#14980]
  * Removed deprecated get_cosmology_from_string class method in
    default_cosmology; use get instead. [#15467]
  ### astropy.io.ascii
  * Several arguments in functions within astropy.io.ascii have
    been deprecated and are either renamed or scheduled to be
    removed.
  * read(): - Reader will be removed. Instead supply the equivalent
    format argument. - Inputter has been renamed to inputter_cls. -
    Outputter has been renamed to outputter_cls.
  * get_reader(): - Reader has been renamed to reader_cls. -
    Inputter has been renamed to inputter_cls. - Outputter has been
    renamed to outputter_cls.
  * write(): - Writer will be removed. Instead supply the
    equivalent format argument.
  * get_writer(): - Writer has been renamed to writer_cls. [#14914]
  * Removed deprecated astropy.io.ascii.tests.common.raises test
    helper; use pytest.raises instead. [#15470]
  ### astropy.io.fits
  * Deprecate _ExtensionHDU and _NonstandardExtHDU (use
    ExtensionHDU or NonstandardExtHDU instead). [#15396]
  * Remove special handling of TCTYP TCUNI TCRPX TCRVL TCDLT TRPOS
    (#7157). [#15396]
  * Rename and deprecate TableHDU.update to TableHDU.update_header,
    for consistency with ImageHDU. [#15396]
  ### astropy.io.misc
  * Removed deprecated astropy.io.misc.asdf subpackage. Use
    asdf-astropy package instead. [#14668]
  * fnunpickle and fnpickle are deprecated because they are not
    used anywhere within astropy. If you must, use the module from
    Python standard library but be advised that pickle is insecure
    so you should only unpickle data that you trust. [#15418]
  ### astropy.io.votable
  * Removed deprecated pedantic option from the
    astropy.io.votable.table.parse() function and the corresponding
    configuration setting. Use the verify option instead. [#14669]
  * Class astropy.io.votable.tree.Table has been renamed to
    TableElement to avoid sharing the name with
    astropy.table.Table. [#15372]
  * Fully removed support for version = ‘1.0’ on
    VOTableFile__init__() and changed its tests to check correctly.
    It was raising a DeprecationWarning and now is raising a
    ValueError. [#15490]
  ### astropy.modeling
  * Removed the AliasDict class from modeling.utils. [#12943]
  * Creating a model instance with parameters that have
    incompatible shapes will now raise a ValueError rather than an
    IncompatibleShapeError. [#15209]
  * Removal of deprecated code _model_to_fit_params and
    _fitter_to_model_params from fitting.py. [#15461]
  ### astropy.stats
  * The BoxLeastSquares, BoxLeastSquaresResults and LombScargle
    classes are not available from astropy.stats anymore, they are
    now available only from astropy.timeseries. [#15530]
  ### astropy.tests
  * Removed deprecated deprecation, warning, and exception handling
    functionality provided by astropy.tests.helper. [#14670]
  * astropy.tests.command.FixRemoteDataOption and
    astropy.tests.command.AstropyTest are deprecated. They are no
    longer necessary after sunsetting astropy-helpers. [#15204]
  ### astropy.time
  * Time has switched to use Masked arrays internally, instead of
    indicating masked values using NaN in the internal jd2
    attribute. As a result, any output from instances, such as one
    gets with, say, the .isot format, will also use Masked by
    default.
  * For backwards compatibility, a new configuration item,
    astropy.time.conf.masked_array_type is introduced which is set
    to “astropy” by default (which indicates one wants to use
    Masked), but can also be set to “numpy”, in which case
    numpy.ma.MaskedArray will be used where possible (essentially,
    for all but Quantity). [#15231]
  * Changed the TimeDelta init signature to be consistent with that
    of Time. Previously the argument order was val, val2, format,
    scale, copy. Now the order is val, val2, format, scale, *,
    precision, in_subfmt, out_subfmt, copy, where the arguments
    after the * must be specified by keyword. [#15264]
  ### astropy.timeseries
  * Removed deprecated midpoint_epoch in fold function; use
    epoch_time instead. [#15462]
  ### astropy.uncertainty
  * The .dtype attribute exposed by Distribution is now that of the
    samples, rather than one that has a “samples” entry. This makes
    quantities with structured data types and units easier to
    support, and generally makes the Distribution appear more
    similar to regular arrays. It should have little effect on
    code. For instance, distribution["samples"] still will return
    the actual distribution.
  * As a consequence of this refactoring, most arrays that are not
    C-contiguous can now be viewed and will thus not be copied on
    input any more. The only exceptions are arrays for which the
    strides are negative.
  * Note that the true data type is considered an implementation
    detail. But for reference, it now is a structured data type
    with a single field, “samples”, which itself is an array of
    “sample” fields, which contain the actual data. [#15304]
  ### astropy.units
  * Like np.ndarray, under numpy 2.0 Quantity and all its
    subclasses (Angle, Masked, etc.) will no longer support the
    .ptp() method. Use np.ptp(...) instead.
  * Similarly, support for the much less frequently used
    .newbyteorder() and .itemset() methods has been removed.
    [#15378]
  * The following deprecated functionality has been removed:
    - littleh unit and with_H0 equivalency. They are still
      available from cosmology.units.
    - brightness_temperature equivalency no longer automatically
      swaps the order of its arguments if it does not match the
      expectation.
    - PhysicalType no longer supports str methods and attributes.
      [#15514]
  ### astropy.utils
  * Removed deprecated OrderedDescriptor,
    OrderedDescriptorContainer, and set_locale in
    astropy.utils.misc. [#14679]
  * is_path_hidden() and walk_skip_hidden() are deprecated.
    [#14759]
  * The structure of utils.metadata has been refactored, but all
    the available functions and classes are still present and
    should be imported as before. [#15166]
  * The astropy.utils.metadata.MetaData class, which is used
    throughout astropy to carry metadata on tables, columns, etc.,
    can now also be used on dataclasses.
  * When accessing the meta attribute on a class
    astropy.utils.metadata.MetaData now returns None instead of
    itself. [#15237]
  * The astropy.utils.metadata.MetaData class, which is used
    throughout astropy to carry metadata on tables, columns, etc.,
    can now also be used on frozen dataclasses. [#15404]
  * Removed deprecated version_path in minversion function; it is
    no longer used. [#15468]
  ### astropy.visualization
  * The bboxes, ticklabels_bbox, and tick_out_size arguments to
    astropy.visualization.wcaxes.ticklabels.TickLabels.draw() now
    have no effect and are deprecated. This is to allow rasterized
    ticks to be drawn correctly on WCSAxes. [#14760]
  * It is now not possible to pass any keyword arguments to
    astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes.draw(). Previously
    passing any keyword arguments would have errored anyway, as
    matplotlib.axes.Axes.draw() does not accept keyword arguments.
    [#14772]
  * Deprecated the exp attribute in the LogStretch,
    InvertedLogStretch, PowerDistStretch, and
    InvertedPowerDistStretch stretch classes, and the power
    attribute in the PowerStretch. Instead, use the a attribute,
    which matches the input keyword. [#15538]
  * Removed the maximum value of the a parameter in the
    AsinhStretch and SinhStretch stretch classes. [#15539]
  ### astropy.wcs
  * Removed deprecated accuracy from all_world2pix method in WCS;
    use tolerance instead. [#15464]
  * NoConvergence no longer accepts arbitrary keyword arguments.
    [#15504]
  ## Bug Fixes
  ### astropy.coordinates
  * Fixed minor bug when getting solar system positions of objects
    from Type 3 SPICE kernel files. [#15612]
  ### astropy.cosmology
  * The exponent in w0wzCDM.de_density_scale has been corrected to
    3, from -3. This correction has also been made to the scalar
    inv_efunc cpython functions. [#14991]
  * pandas.Series are now uniformly converted to their underlying
    data type when given as an argument to a Cosmology method.
    [#15600]
  ### astropy.io.fits
  * Reading a table from FITS now respects the TNULL property of a
    column, passing it into the column’s fill_value. [#14723]
  * Fix crash when a PrimaryHDU has a GROUPS keyword with a
    non-boolean value (i.e. not a random-groups HDU). [#14998]
  * Fixed a bug that caused Cutout2D to not work correctly with
    CompImageHDU.section [#14999]
  * Fixed a bug that caused compressed images with TFORM missing
    the optional ‘1’ prefix to not be readable. [#15001]
  * Ensure that tables written to FITS with both masked and
    unmasked columns roundtrip properly (previously, all integer
    columns would become masked if any column was masked). [#15473]
  * Fix segfault with error report in tile decompression. [#15489]
  ### astropy.io.votable
  * Output of repr for VOTable instance now clearly shows it is a
    VOTable and not generic astropy Table. [#14702]
  ### astropy.modeling
  * All models can be pickled now. [#14902]
  ### astropy.nddata
  * Restore bitmask propagation behavior in NDData.mask, plus a fix
    for arithmetic between masked and unmasked NDData objects.
    [#14995]
  ### astropy.table
  * Table.as_array now respects the fill_value property of masked
    columns. [#14723]
  * Fix a bug where table indexes were not using a stable sort
    order. This was causing the order of rows within groups to not
    match the original table order when an indexed table was
    grouped. [#14907]
  * Fixed issue #14964 that when grouping a Table on a mixin column
    such as Quantity or Time, the grouped table keys did not
    reflect the original column values. For Quantity this meant
    that the key values were pure float values without the unit,
    while for Time the key values were the pair of jd1 and jd2
    float values. [#14966]
  ### astropy.time
  * Ensure that the Time caches of formats and scales do not get
    out of sync with the actual data, even if another instance,
    holding a view of the data is written to. E.g., if one does t01
    = t[:2], and sets t[0] after, it is now guaranteed that
    t01.value will correctly reflect that change in value. [#15453]
  ### astropy.units
  * In VOunits, “pix”, “au”, “a”, and “ct” are removed from the
    list of deprecated units. [#14885]
  ### astropy.utils
  * Ufuncs with more than 2 operands (such as erfa.dtf2d) now work
    also if all inputs are scalars and more than two inputs have
    masks. [#15450]
  * Ensured that str(masked_array) looks like str(unmasked_array)
    also for array scalars. Thus, like regular array scalars, the
    precision is ignored for float, and strings do not include
    extra quoting. [#15451]
  ### astropy.visualization
  * The location of ticklabels on a WCSAxes is now correctly
    calculated when the figure is rasterized. [#14760]
  * Fixed a bug where a ValueError would be raised in the
    AsinhStretch and SinhStretch classes for valid a parameter
    values. [#15539]
  ### astropy.wcs
  * wcs.validate(filename) now properly closes the file handler.
    [#15054]
  * Fix a regression in custom WCS mapping due to the recent
    introduction of Solar System frames. [#15630]
  ## Other Changes and Additions
  * The minimum supported version of NumPy is now 1.22. [#15006]
  * Moved International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS)
    and Leap Second files out into standalone astropy-iers-data
    package, maintaining full backward-compatibility in the
    astropy.utils.iers API. Deprecation warnings may be issued when
    certain files are accessed directly. [#14819]
  * Switch from using setup.cfg for project configuration to using
    pyproject.toml. [#15247]
  * Update bundled expat to 2.5.0. [#15585]

- Update to 5.3.4
  ## Bug Fixes
  ### astropy.io.misc
  * Updated ``astropy.io.misc.yaml`` so ``dump()` with a numpy
    object array or ``load()`` with YAML representing a Numpy
    object array both raise ``TypeError``. This prevents problems
    like a segmentation fault. [#15373]
  ### astropy.io.votable
  * Fixed a bug in ``convert_to_writable_filelike`` where
    ``GzipFile`` was not closed properly. [#15359]
  ### astropy.units
  * In VOUnit, the spaces around the slash were removed in the
    formatting of fractions, and fractional powers now also use the
    "**" operator. [#15282]
  * We now ensure that the unit ``u.cgs.cm`` is just an alias of
    ``u.si.cm``, instead of a redefinition.  This ensures that
    ``u.Unit("cm") / u.cm`` will reliably cancel to dimensionless
    (instead of some "cm / cm"). [#15368]
  ### astropy.utils
  * For ``Masked``, ``np.ptp`` and the ``.ptp()`` method now
    properly account for the mask, ensuring the result is identical
    to subtracting the maximum and minimum (with the same
    arguments). [#15380]
  ## Other Changes and Additions
  * Compatibility with Python 3.12. [#14784]
  * Replaced the URL of ``IETF_LEAP_SECOND_URL`` because the
    original is now defunct and IETF now defers to IANA for such
    look-up. [#15421]

  ### astropy.cosmology
  * The exponent of w0wzCDM functions in inv_efunc has been
    corrected to 3, from -3. [#15224]
  ### astropy.modeling
  * Astropy modeling can filter non-finite data values using the
    filter_non_finite keyword argument in a fitter call. Now when
    filter_non_finite is True, non-finite weights will also be
    filtered to prevent crashes in LevMarLSQFitter. [#15215]
  ### astropy.units
  * Fixed astropy.units.Quantity’s implementation of
    numpy.nanmedian(), where for Numpy >= 1.25 an exception was
    raised for some array shapes and axis combinations. [#15228]

    divisions, such as km/s/Mpc now parse correctly as being equal
    to km/(s.Mpc). [#14369]
  ### astropy.io.fits

    column. This now works as expected where previously this caused
    an exception. [#14357]
  ### astropy.units
  * CDS units with multiple divisions, such as km/s/Mpc now parse
    correctly as being equal to km/(s.Mpc). [#14369]
  ### astropy.wcs
  * Fixed a bug that caused subclasses of BaseHighLevelWCS and
    HighLevelWCSMixin to not work correctly under certain
    conditions if they did not have world_n_dim and pixel_n_dim
    defined on them. [#14495]

- Update to 5.2.1
  ## Bug Fixes
  ### astropy.coordinates
  * Fix to ITRS frame earth_location attribute to give the correct
    result for a topocentric frame. [#14180]
  ### astropy.cosmology
  * Bounds are no longer passed to the scipy minimizer for methods
    Brent and Golden. The scipy minimizer never used the bounds but
    silently accepted them. In scipy v1.11.0.dev0+ an error is
    raised, so we now pass None as the bounds to the minimizer.
    Users should not be affected by this change. [#14232]
  ### astropy.io.fits
  * Tables with multidimensional variable length array can now be
    properly read and written. [#13417]
  ### astropy.units
  * Modified the behavior of numpy.histogram(),
    numpy.histogram_bin_edges(), numpy.histogram2d(), and
    numpy.histogramdd() so that the range argument must a
    compatible instance of astropy.units.Quantity if the other
    arguments are instances of astropy.units.Quantity. [#14213]
  ### astropy.visualization
  * Improved the performance of drawing WCSAxes grids by skipping
    some unnecessary computations. [#14164]
  * Fixed WCSAxes sometimes triggering a NumPy RuntimeWarning when
    determining the coordinate range of the axes. [#14211]
  ## Other Changes and Additions
  * Fix compatibility with Numpy 1.24. [#14193]

- Update to 5.1.1
  # API Changes
  ## astropy.wcs
  * The pixel argument to
    astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.ticklabels.TickLabels.add no
    longer does anything, is deprecated, and will be removed in a
    future astropy version. It has been replaced by a new required
    data argument, which should be used to specify the data
    coordinates of the tick label being added.
  * This changes has been made because it is (in general) not
    possible to correctly calculate pixel coordinates before
    Matplotlib is drawing a figure. [#12630]
  # Bug Fixes
  ## astropy.coordinates
  * Fixed a bug that prevented SkyOffsetFrame instances to be
    pickled by adding a custom __reduce__ method to the class (see
    issue #9249). [#13305]
  * Fixed the check for invalid Latitude values for float32 values.
    Latitude now accepts the float32 value of pi/2, which was
    rejected before because a comparison was made using the
    slightly smaller float64 representation. See issue #13708.
    [#13745]
  ## astropy.io.ascii
  * Fixed confusing chained exception messages of read() function
    when it fails. [#13170]
  * When writing out a :class:`~astropy.table.Table` to HTML
    format, the formats keyword argument to the
    :meth:`~astropy.table.Table.write` method will now be applied.
    [#13453]
  ## astropy.io.fits
  * heapsize is now checked for VLA tables. An error is thrown
    whether P format is used but the heap size is bigger than what
    can be indexed with a 32 bit signed int. [#13429]
  * Fix parsing of ascii TFORM when precision is missing. [#13520]
  * A compressed image HDU created from the header of a PRIMARY
    HDU, now correctly updates 'XTENSION' and 'SIMPLE' keywords.
    [#13557]
  * Empty variable-length arrays are now properly handled when
    pathological combinations of heapoffset and heapsize are
    encountered. [#13621]
  * PCOUNT and GCOUNT keywords are now removed from an uncompressed
    Primary header, for compliancy with fitsverify behavior.
    [#13753]
  ## astropy.modeling
  * Bugfix for using MagUnit units on model parameters. [#13158]
  * Fix bug in using non-linear fitters to fit 0-degree polynomials
    using weights. [#13628]
  ## astropy.table
  * Fix a problem where accessing one field of a structured column
    returned a Column with the same info as the original column.
    This resulted in unintuitive behavior in general and an
    exception if the format for the column was set. [#13269]
  * Tables with columns with structured data can now be properly
    stacked and joined. [#13306]
  * Update jQuery to 3.6.0, to pick up security fixes. [#13438]
  * Fix a Python 3.11 compatibility issue. Ensure that when
    removing a table column that the pprint_include_names or
    pprint_exclude_names attributes get updated correctly. [#13639]
  * When using add_columns with same indexes in indexes option or
    without specifying the option, the order of the new columns
    will now be kept. [#13783]
  * Fix a bug when printing or getting the representation of a
    multidimensional table column that has a zero dimension.
    [#13838]
  * Ensure that mixin columns and their info are not shared between
    tables even when their underlying data is shared with
    copy=False. [#13842]
  ## astropy.time
  * Fix Time.insert() on times which have their out_subfmt set.
    [#12732]
  * Prevent Time() from being initialized with an invalid precision
    leading to incorrect results when representing the time as a
    string. [#13068]
  * Fix a bug in Time where a date string like "2022-08-01.123" was
    being parsed as an ISO-format time "2022-08-01 00:00:00.123".
    The fractional part at the end of the string was being taken as
    seconds. Now this raises an exception because the string is not
    in ISO format. [#13731]
  ## astropy.units
  * Significantly improved the performance of parsing composite
    units with the FITS format, by ensuring the detailed_exception
    argument is properly passed on and thus used. [#12699]
  * Ensure that np.concatenate on quantities can take a dtype
    argument (added in numpy 1.20). [#13323]
  * Ensure that the units of any initial argument to reductions
    such as np.add.reduce (which underlies np.sum) are properly
    taken into account. [#13340]
  ## astropy.utils
  * Ensure that np.concatenate on masked data can take a dtype
    argument (added in numpy 1.20). [#13323]
  * Fix error when suppressing download progress bar while using
    non-default sys.stdout stream. [#13352]
  * Ensure str and repr work properly for Masked versions of
    structured subarrays. [#13404]
  * If an attribute is created using deprecated_attribute() with
    the alternative argument then getting or setting the value of
    the deprecated attribute now accesses its replacement. [#13824]
  ## astropy.visualization
  * Fixed calling .tight_layout() on a WCSAxes. [#12418]
  ## astropy.wcs
  * WCS.pixel_to_world now creates an EarthLocation object using
    MJD-AVG if present before falling back to the old behaviour of
    using MJD-OBS. [#12598]
  * The locations of WCSAxes ticks and tick-labels are now
    correctly calculated when the DPI of a figure changes between a
    WCSAxes being created and the figure being drawn, or when a
    rasterized artist is added to the WCSAxes. [#12630]
  * Fix a bug where SlicedLowLevelWCS.world_to_pixel_values would
    break when the result of the transform is dependent on the
    coordinate of a sliced out pixel. [#13579]
  * Updated bundled WCSLIB version to 7.12. This update includes
    bug fixes to wcssub() in how it handles temporal axes with -TAB
    and fixes handling of status returns from linp2x() and linx2p()
    relating to distortion functions, in particular affecting TPV
    distortions - see #13509. For a full list of changes - see
    http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/CHANGES or
    astropy/cextern/wcslib/CHANGES. [#13635]
  * Fixed WCS validation not working properly if HDUList is needed
    for multi-extension FITS file. [#13668]

  # Bug Fixes
  ## astropy.modeling
  * Fixed the Gaussian2D bounding_box when theta is an angular
    Quantity. [#13021]
  ## astropy.utils
  * Reverted astropy.utils.iers.iers.IERS_A_URL to
    maia.usno.navy.mil domain instead of NASA FTP to work around
    server issues. [#13004]
  # Other Changes and Additions
  * Updated bundled WCSLIB to version 7.9 with several bugfixes and
    added support for time coordinate axes in wcsset() and
    wcssub(). The four-digit type code for the time axis will have
    the first digit set to 4, i.e., four digit code will be 4xxx
    where x is a digit 0-9. For a full list of bug fixes see

    (when building --without system_wcslib)
- Release 5.0.3
  # Bug Fixes
  ## astropy.convolution
  * Bugfix in astropy.convolution.utils.discretize_model which
    allows the function to handle a CompoundModel. Before this fix,
    discretize_model was confusing CompoundModel with a callable
    function. [#12959]
  ## astropy.io.fits
  * Fix write and read FITS tables with multidimensional items,
    using from_columns without previousely defined ColDefs
    structure. [#12863]
  ## astropy.io.votable
  * Fix VOTable linting to avoid use of shell option. [#12985]
   astropy.utils
  * Fix XML linting to avoid use of shell option. [#12985]
  # Other Changes and Additions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 13 08:10:02 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 5.0.2
  astropy.io.ascii
  * Bugfix to add backwards compatibility for reading ECSV version
    0.9 files with non-standard column datatypes (such as `object`,
    `str`, `datetime64`, etc.), which would raise a ValueError in
    ECSV version 1.0. [#12880]
  * astropy.io.misc
  * Bugfix for `units_mapping` schema's property name conflicts.
    Changes:
    - `inputs` to `unit_inputs`
    - `outputs` to `unit_outputs` [#12800]
  astropy.io.votable
  * Fixed a bug where `astropy.io.votable.validate` was printing
    output to `sys.stdout` when the `output` paramter was set to
    `None`. `validate` now returns a string when `output` is set to
    `None`, as documented. [#12604]
  astropy.modeling
  * Fix handling of units on `scale` parameter in BlackBody model.
    [#12318]
  * Indexing on models can now be used with all types of integers
    (like `numpy.int64`) instead of just `int`. [#12561]
  * Fix computation of the separability of a `CompoundModel` where
    another `CompoundModel` is on the right hand side of the `&`
    operator. [#12907]
  * Provide a hook (`Model._calculate_separability_matrix`) to
    allow subclasses of `Model` to define how to compute their
    separability matrix. [#12900]
  astropy.stats
  * Fixed a bug in which running
    `kuiper_false_positive_probability(D,N)` on distributions with
    many data points could produce NaN values for the false
    positive probability of the Kuiper statistic. [#12896]
  astropy.wcs
  * Fixed a bug due to which `naxis`, `pixel_shape`, and
    `pixel_bounds` attributes of `astropy.wcs.WCS` were not
    restored when an `astropy.wcs.WCS` object was unpickled. This
    fix also eliminates `FITSFixedWarning` warning issued during
    unpiclikng of the WCS objects related to the number of axes.
    This fix also eliminates errors when unpickling WCS objects
    originally created using non-default values for `key`,
    `colsel`, and `keysel` parameters. [#12844]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 28 19:27:20 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 5.0.1
  astropy.coordinates
  * Trying to create an instance of astropy.coordinates.Distance by
    providing both z and parallax now raises the expected
    ValueError. [#12531]
  * Fixed a bug where changing the wrap angle of the longitude
    component of a representation could raise a warning or error in
    certain situations. [#12556]
  * astropy.coordinates.Distance constructor no longer ignores the
    unit keyword when parallax is provided. [#12569]
  astropy.cosmology
  * astropy.cosmology.utils.aszarr can now convert Column objects.
    [#12525]
  * Reading a cosmology from an ECSV will load redshift and Hubble
    parameter units from the cosmology units module. [#12636]
  astropy.io.fits
  * Fix formatting issue in _dump_coldefs and add tests for
    tabledump and tableload convenience functions. [#12526]
  astropy.io.misc
  * YAML can now also represent quantities and arrays with
    structured dtype, as well as structured scalars based on
    np.void. [#12509]
  astropy.modeling
  * Fixes error when fitting multiplication or division based
    compound models where the sub-models have different output
    units. [#12475]
  * Bugfix for incorrectly initialized and filled parameters data
    for Spline1D model. [#12523]
  * Bugfix for keyerror thrown by Model.input_units_equivalencies
    when used on fix_inputs models which have no set unit
    equivalencies. [#12597]
  astropy.table
  * astropy.table.Table.keep_columns() and
    astropy.table.Table.remove_columns() now work with generators
    of column names. [#12529]
  * Avoid duplicate storage of info in serialized columns if the
  column used to serialize already can hold that information.
  [#12607] astropy.timeseries
  * Fixed edge case bugs which emerged when using
    aggregate_downsample with custom bins. [#12527]
  astropy.units
  * Structured units can be serialized to/from yaml. [#12492]
  * Fix bad typing problems by removing interaction with
    NDArray.__class_getitem__. [#12511]
  * Ensure that Quantity.to_string(format='latex') properly
    typesets exponents also when
    u.quantity.conf.latex_array_threshold = -1 (i.e., when the
    threshold is taken from numpy). [#12573]
  * Structured units can now be copied with copy.copy and
    copy.deepcopy and also pickled and unpicked also for protocol
    >= 2. This does not work for big-endian architecture with older
    numpy<1.21.1. [#12583]
  astropy.utils
  * Ensure that a Masked instance can be used to initialize (or
    viewed as) a numpy.ma.Maskedarray. [#12482]
  * Ensure Masked also works with numpy >=1.22, which has a keyword
    argument name change for np.quantile. [#12511]
  * astropy.utils.iers.LeapSeconds.auto_open() no longer emits
    unnecessary warnings when astropy.utils.iers.conf.auto_max_age
    is set to None. [#12713]

  astropy.units
  * Ensure that unpickling quantities and units in new sessions
    does not change hashes and thus cause problems with (de)

  astropy.cosmology
  * Fixed an issue where specializations of the comoving distance
    calculation for certain cosmologies could not handle redshift
    arrays. [#10980]
  astropy.io.fits
  * Fix bug where manual fixes to invalid header cards were not
    preserved when saving a FITS file. [#11108]
  astropy.io.votable
  * NumericArray converter now properly broadcasts scalar mask to
    array. [#11157]
  astropy.table
  * Fix bug when initializing a Table subclass that uses
    TableAttribute's. If the data were an instance of the table
    then attributes provided in the table initialization call
    could be ignored. [#11217]
  astropy.time
  * Change epoch of TimeUnixTAI ("unix_tai") from
    1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC to 1970-01-01T00:00:00 TAI to match
    the intended and documented behaviour. This essentially
    changes the resulting times by 8.000082 seconds, the initial
    offset between TAI and UTC. [#11249]
  astropy.units
  * Fixed a bug with the quantity_input decorator where allowing
    dimensionless inputs for an argument inadvertently disabled
    any checking of compatible units for that argument. [#11283]
  astropy.utils

- Update to 4.0.2
  New Features
  * astropy.utils
    astropy.utils.data.download_file now supports FTPS/FTP over 
    TLS. [#9964]
    astropy.utils.data now uses a lock-free mechanism for caching. 
    This new mechanism uses a new cache layout and so ignores 
    caches created using earlier mechanisms (which were causing 
    lockups on clusters). The two cache formats can coexist but do 
    not share any files. [#10437, #10683]
    astropy.utils.data now ignores the config item 
    astropy.utils.data.conf.download_cache_lock_attempts since no 
    locking is done. [#10437, #10683]
    astropy.utils.data.download_file and related functions now 
    interpret the parameter or config file setting timeout=0 to 
    mean they should make no attempt to download files. [#10437, 
    #10683]
    astropy.utils.import_file_to_cache now accepts a keyword-only 
    argument replace, defaulting to True, to determine whether it 
    should replace existing files in the cache, in a way as close 
    to atomic as possible. [#10437, #10683]
    astropy.utils.data.download_file and related functions now 
    treat http://example.com and http://example.com/ as equivalent. 
    [#10631]
  * astropy.wcs
    The new auxiliary WCS parameters added in WCSLIB 7.1 are now 
    exposed as the aux attribute of Wcsprm. [#10333]
    Updated bundled version of WCSLIB to v7.3. [#10433]
  Bug fixes
  * astropy.config
    Added an extra fallback to os.expanduser('~') when trying to 
    find the user home directory. [#10570]
  * astropy.constants
    Corrected definition of parsec to 648 000 / pi AU following IAU 
    2015 B2 [#10569]
  * astropy.convolution
    Fixed a bug where a float-typed integers in the argument 
    x_range of astropy.convolution.utils.discretize_oversample_1D 
    (and the 2D version as well) fails because it uses 
    numpy.linspace, which requires an int. [#10696]
  * astropy.coordinates
    Ensure that for size-1 array SkyCoord and coordinate frames the 
    attributes also properly become scalars when indexed with 0. 
    [#10113]
    Fixed a bug where SkyCoord.separation() and 
    SkyCoord.separation_3d were not accepting a frame object. 
    [#10332]
    Ensure that the lon values in SkyOffsetFrame are wrapped 
    correctly at 180 degree regardless of how the underlying data 
    is represented. [#10163]
    Fixed an error in the obliquity of the ecliptic when 
    transforming to/from the *TrueEcliptic coordinate frames. The 
    error would primarily result in an inaccuracy in the ecliptic 
    latitude on the order of arcseconds. [#10129]
    Fixed an error in the computation of the location of solar 
    system bodies where the Earth location of the observer was 
    ignored during the correction for light travel time. [#10292]
    Ensure that coordinates with proper motion that are transformed 
    to other coordinate frames still can be represented properly. 
    [#10276]
    Improve the error message given when trying to get a cartesian 
    representation for coordinates that have both proper motion and 
    radial velocity, but no distance. [#10276]
    Fixed an error where SkyCoord.apply_space_motion would return 
    incorrect results when no distance is set and proper motion is 
    high. [#10296]
    Make the parsing of angles thread-safe so that Angle can be 
    used in Python multithreading. [#10556]
    Fixed reporting of EarthLocation.info which previously raised 
    an exception. [#10592]
  * astropy.io.ascii
    Fixed a bug with the C fast_reader not correctly parsing 
    newlines when delimiter was also set to \n or \r; ensured 
    consistent handling of input strings without newline 
    characters. [#9929]
  * astropy.io.fits
    Fix integer formats of TFORMn=Iw columns in ASCII tables to 
    correctly read values exceeding int32 - setting int16, int32 or 
    int64 according to w. [#9901]
    Fix unclosed memory-mapped FITS files in FITSDiff when 
    difference found. [#10159]

    Fix handling of 1-dimensional arrays with a single element in 
    BinTableHDU [#10768]
  * astropy.io.misc
    Fix id URL in baseframe-1.0.0 ASDF schema. [#10223]
    Write keys to ASDF only if the value is present, to account for 
    a change in behavior in asdf 2.8. [#10674]
  * astropy.io.registry
    Fix Table.(read|write).help when reader or writer has no 
    docstring. [#10460]
  * astropy.io.votable
    Fixed parsing failure of VOTable with no fields. When detecting 
    a non-empty table with no fields, the following warning/
    exception is issued: E25 "No FIELDs are defined; DATA section 
    will be ignored." [#10192]
  * astropy.modeling
    Fixed a problem with mapping input_units and return_units of a 
    CompoundModel to the units of the constituent models. [#10158]
    Removed hard-coded names of inputs and outputs. [#10174]
    Fixed a problem where slicing a CompoundModel by name will 
    crash if there fix_inputs operators are present. [#10224]
    Removed a limitation of fitting of data with units with 
    compound models without units when the expression involves 
    operators other than addition and subtraction. [#10415]
    Fixed a problem with fitting Linear1D and Planar2D in model 
    sets. [#10623]
    Fixed reported module name of math_functions model classes. 
    [#10694]
    Fixed reported module name of tabular model classes. [#10709]
    Do not create new math_functions models for ufuncs that are 
    only aliases (divide and mod). [#10697]
    Fix calculation of the Moffat2D derivative with respect to 
    gamma. [#10784]
  * astropy.stats
    Fixed an API regression where SigmaClip.__call__ would convert 
    masked elements to nan and upcast the dtype to float64 in its 
    output MaskedArray when using the axis parameter along with the 
    defaults masked=True and copy=True. [#10610]
    Fixed an issue where fully masked MaskedArray input to 
    sigma_clipped_stats gave incorrect results. [#10099]
    Fixed an issue where sigma_clip and SigmaClip.__call__ would 
    return a masked array instead of a ndarray when masked=False 
    and the input was a full-masked MaskedArray. [#10099]
    Fixed bug with funcs.poisson_conf_interval where an integer for 
    N with interval='kraft-burrows-nousek' would throw an error 
    with mpmath backend. [#10427]
    Fixed bug in funcs.poisson_conf_interval with interval='kraft-
    burrows-nousek' where certain combinations of source and 
    background count numbers led to ValueError due to the choice of 
    starting value for numerical optimization. [#10618]
  * astropy.table
    Fixed a bug when writing a table with mixin columns to FITS, 
    ECSV or HDF5. If one of the data attributes of the mixin (e.g. 
    skycoord.ra) had the same name as one of the table column names 
    (ra), the column (ra) would be dropped when reading the table 
    back. [#10222]
    Fixed a bug when sorting an indexed table on the indexed column 
    after first sorting on another column. [#10103]
    Fixed a bug in table argsort when called with reverse=True for 
    an indexed table. [#10103]
    Fixed a performance regression introduced in #9048 when 
    initializing a table from Python lists. Also fixed incorrect 
    behavior (for data types other than float) when those lists 
    contain np.ma.masked elements to indicate masked data. [#10636]
    Avoid modifying .meta when serializing columns to FITS. 
    [#10485]
    Avoid crash when reading a FITS table that contains mixin info 
    and PyYAML is missing. [#10485]
  * astropy.time
    Ensure that for size-1 array Time, the location also properly 
    becomes a scalar when indexed with 0. [#10113]
  * astropy.units
    Refined test_parallax to resolve difference between 2012 and 
    2015 definitions. [#10569]
  * astropy.utils
    The default IERS server has been updated to use the FTPS server 
    hosted by CDDIS. [#9964]
    Fixed memory allocation on 64-bit systems within xml.iterparse 
    [#10076]
    Fix case where None could be used in a numerical computation.

    Fixed a bug where the ImageNormalize clip keyword was ignored 
    when used with calling the object on data. [#10098]
    Fixed a bug where axes.xlabel/axes.ylabel where not correctly 
    set nor returned on an EllipticalFrame class WCSAxes plot.
    [#10446]
  * astropy.wcs
    Handled WCS 360 -> 0 deg crossover in fit_wcs_from_points 
    [#10155]
    Do not issue DATREF warning when MJDREF has default value. 
    [#10440]
    Fixed a bug due to which naxis argument was ignored if header 
    was supplied during the initialization of a WCS object. 
    [#10532]
  Other Changes and Additions
  * Improved the speed of sorting a large Table on a single column 
    by a factor of around 5. [#10103]

    [gh#astropy/astropy#9969]
    Fixed bug where the location attribute was lost when creating a new ``Time``
    object from an existing ``Time`` or list of ``Time`` objects.

    if the ``val1`` argument was a regular double and the ``val2`` argument
    was a ``longdouble``.   
  * astropy.timeseries
    [gh#astropy/astropy#10013]
    Fixed issue with reference time for the ``transit_time`` parameter returned by
    the ``BoxLeastSquares`` periodogram. Now, the ``transit_time`` will be within
    the range of the input data and arbitrary time offsets/zero points no longer
    affect results.   
  * astropy.units
    [gh#astropy/astropy#9948]
    Fix for ``quantity_input`` annotation raising an exception on iterable
    types that don't define a general ``__contains__`` for checking if ``None``

  + New Features
    > astropy.config
      * The config and cache directories and the name of the config file are now
        customizable. This allows affiliated packages to put their configuration
        files in locations other than ``CONFIG_DIR/.astropy/``.
    > astropy.constants
      * The version of constants can be specified via ScienceState in a way
        that ``constants`` and ``units`` will be consistent.
      * Default constants now use CODATA 2018 and IAU 2015 definitions.
      * Constants can be pickled and unpickled.
    > astropy.convolution
      * Fixed a bug where having a kernel defined using unitless astropy
        quantity objects would result in a crash
    > astropy.coordinates
      * Changed ``coordinates.solar_system_ephemeris`` to also accept local files
        as input. The ephemeris can now be selected by either keyword (e.g. 'jpl',
        'de430'), URL or file path.
      * Added a ``cylindrical`` property to ``SkyCoord`` for shorthand access to a
        ``CylindricalRepresentation`` of the coordinate, as is already available
        for other common representations.
      * The default parameters for the ``Galactocentric`` frame are now controlled by
        a ``ScienceState`` subclass, ``galactocentric_frame_defaults``. New
        parameter sets will be added to this object periodically to keep up with
        ever-improved measurements of the solar position and motion.
      * Coordinate frame classes can now have multiple aliases by assigning a list
        of aliases to the class variable ``name``.  Any of the aliases can be used
        for attribute-style access or as the target of ``tranform_to()`` calls.

      * Passing a NaN to ``Distance`` no longer raises a warning.
    > astropy.cosmology
      * The pre-publication Planck 2018 cosmological parameters are included as the
        ``Planck2018_arXiv_v2`` object.  Please note that the values are preliminary,
        and when the paper is accepted a final version will be included as
        ``Planck18``.
    > astropy.io.ascii
      * Removed incorrect warnings on ``Overflow`` when reading in
        ``FloatType`` 0.0 with ``use_fast_converter``; synchronised
        ``IntType`` ``Overflow`` warning messages.
    > astropy.io.misc
      * Eliminate deprecated compatibility mode when writing ``Table`` metadata to
        HDF5 format.
      * Add support for orthogonal polynomial models to ASDF.
    > astropy.io.fits
      * Changed the ``fitscheck`` and ``fitsdiff`` script to use the ``argparse``
        module instead of ``optparse``.
      * Allow writing of ``Table`` objects with ``Time`` columns that are also table
        indices to FITS files.
    > astropy.io.votable
      * Support VOTable version 1.4.  The main addition is the new element, TIMESYS,
        which allows defining of metadata for temporal coordinates much like COOSYS
        defines metadata for celestial coordinates.
    > astropy.logger
      * Added a configuration option to specify the text encoding of the log file,
        with the default behavior being the platform-preferred encoding.
    > astropy.modeling
      * Major rework of modeling internals. `See modeling documentation for details.
        <https://docs.astropy.org/en/v4.0.x/modeling/changes_for_4.html>`_ .
      * Add ``Tabular1D.inverse``.
      * ``Model.rename`` was changed to add the ability to rename ``Model.inputs``
        and ``Model.outputs``.
      * New function ``fix_inputs`` to generate new models from others by fixing
        specific inputs variable values to constants.
      * ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` are now model instance attributes, and ``n_inputs``
        and ``n_outputs`` are class attributes. Backwards compatible default
        values of ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` are generated. ``Model.inputs`` and
        ``Model.outputs`` are now settable which allows renaming them on per user
        case.
      * Add a new model representing a sequence of rotations in 3D around an
        arbitrary number of axes.
      * Add many of the numpy ufunc functions as models.
      * Add ``BlackBody`` model.
      * Add ``Drude1D`` model.
      * Added analytical King model (KingProjectedAnalytic1D).
      * Added Exponential1D and Logarithmic1D models.
    > astropy.nddata
      * Add a way for technically invalid but unambiguous units in a fits header
        to be parsed by ``CCDData``.
      * ``NDData`` now only accepts WCS objects which implement either the high, or
        low level APE 14 WCS API. All WCS objects are converted to a high level WCS
        object, so ``NDData.wcs`` now always returns a high level APE 14 object. Not
        all array slices are valid for wcs objects, so some slicing operations which
        used to work may now fail.
    > astropy.stats
      * The ``biweight_location``, ``biweight_scale``, and
        ``biweight_midvariance`` functions now allow for the ``axis``
        keyword to be a tuple of integers.
      * Added an ``ignore_nan`` option to the ``biweight_location``,
        ``biweight_scale``, and ``biweight_midvariance`` functions.
      * A numpy ``MaskedArray`` can now be input to the ``biweight_location``,
        ``biweight_scale``, and ``biweight_midvariance`` functions.
      * Removed the warning related to p0 in the Bayesian blocks algorithm. The
        caveat related to p0 is described in the docstring for ``Events``.
    > astropy.table
      * Improved the implementation of ``Table.replace_column()`` to provide
        a speed-up of 5 to 10 times for wide tables.  The method can now accept
        any input which convertible to a column of the correct length, not just
        ``Column`` subclasses.
      * Improved the implementation of ``Table.add_column()`` to provide a speed-up
        of 2 to 10 (or more) when adding a column to tables, with increasing benefit
        as the number of columns increases.  The method can now accept any input
        which is convertible to a column of the correct length, not just ``Column``
        subclasses.
      * Changed the implementation of ``Table.add_columns()`` to use the new
        ``Table.add_column()`` method.  In most cases the performance is similar
        or slightly faster to the previous implemenation.
      * ``MaskedColumn.data`` will now return a plain ``MaskedArray`` rather than
        the previous (unintended) ``masked_BaseColumn``.
      * Added depth-wise stacking ``dstack()`` in higher level table operation.
        It help will in stacking table column depth-wise.
      * Added a new table equality method ``values_equal()`` which allows comparison
        table values to another table, list, or value, and returns an
        element-by-element equality table.
      * Added new ``join_type='cartesian'`` option to the ``join`` operation.
      * Allow adding a table column as a list of mixin-type objects, for instance
        ``t['q'] = [1 * u.m, 2 * u.m]``.
      * Allow table ``join()`` using any sortable key column (e.g. Time), not
        just ndarray subclasses. A column is considered sortable if there is a
        ``<column>.info.get_sortable_arrays()`` method that is implemented.
      * Added ``Table.iterrows()`` for making row-wise iteration faster.
      * Allow table to be initialized with a list of dict where the dict keys
        are not the same in every row. The table column names are the set of all keys
        found in the input data, and any missing key/value pairs are turned into
        missing data in the table.
      * Prevent unnecessary ERFA warnings when indexing by ``Time`` columns.
      * Added support for sorting tables which contain non-mutable mixin columns
        (like ``SkyCoord``) for which in-place item update is not allowed.
      * Ensured that inserting ``np.ma.masked`` (or any other value with a mask) into
        a ``MaskedColumn`` causes a masked entry to be inserted.
      * Fixed a bug that caused an exception when initializing a ``MaskedColumn`` from
        another ``MaskedColumn`` that has a structured dtype.
    > astropy.tests
      * The plugin that handles the custom header in the test output has been
        moved to the ``pytest-astropy-header plugin`` package. `See the README at
        <https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy-header>`__ for information about
        using this new plugin.
    > astropy.time
      * Added a new time format ``ymdhms`` for representing times via year, month,
        day, hour, minute, and second attributes.
      * ``TimeDelta`` gained a ``to_value`` method, so that it becomes easier to
        use it wherever a ``Quantity`` with units of time could be used.
      * Made scalar ``Time`` and ``TimeDelta`` objects hashable based on JD, time
        scale, and location attributes.
      * Improved error message when bad input is used to initialize a ``Time`` or
        ``TimeDelta`` object and the format is specified.
      * Allow numeric time formats to be initialized with numpy ``longdouble``,
        ``Decimal`` instances, and strings.  One can select just one of these
        using ``in_subfmt``.  The output can be similarly set using ``out_subfmt``.

      * Introduce a new ``.to_value()`` method for ``Time`` (and adjusted the
        existing method for ``TimeDelta``) so that one can get values in a given
        ``format`` and possible ``subfmt`` (e.g., ``to_value('mjd', 'str')``.
      * Prevent unecessary ERFA warnings when sorting ``Time`` objects.
    > astropy.timeseries
      * Addig ``epoch_phase``, ``wrap_phase`` and ``normalize_phase`` keywords to
        ``TimeSeries.fold()`` to control the phase of the epoch and to return
        normalized phase rather than time for the folded TimeSeries.
    > astropy.uncertainty
      * ``Distribution`` was rewritten such that it deals better with subclasses.
        As a result, Quantity distributions now behave correctly with ``to`` methods
        yielding new distributions of the kind expected for the starting
        distribution, and ``to_value`` yielding ``NdarrayDistribution`` instances.

      * The ``pdf_*`` properties that were used to calculate statistical properties
        of ``Distrubution`` instances were changed into methods. This allows one
        to pass parameters such as ``ddof`` to ``pdf_std`` and ``pdf_var`` (which
        generally should equal 1 instead of the default 0), and reflects that these
        are fairly involved calcuations, not just "properties".
    > astropy.units
      * Support for unicode parsing. Currently supported superscripts are Ohm,
        Ångström, and the micro-sign.
      * Accept non-unit type annotations in @quantity_input.
      * For numpy 1.17 and later, the new ``__array_function__`` protocol is used to
        ensure that all top-level numpy functions interact properly with
        ``Quantity``, preserving units also in operations like ``np.concatenate``.

      * Add equivalencies for surface brightness units to spectral_density.
    > astropy.utils
      * ``astropy.utils.data.download_file`` and
        ``astropy.utils.data.get_readable_fileobj`` now provides an ``http_headers``
        keyword to pass in specific request headers for the download. It also now
        defaults to providing ``User-Agent: Astropy`` and ``Accept: */*``
        headers. The default ``User-Agent`` value can be set with a new
        ``astropy.data.conf.default_http_user_agent`` configuration item.

      * Added a new ``astropy.utils.misc.unbroadcast`` function which can be used
        to return the smallest array that can be broadcasted back to the initial
        array.
      * The specific IERS Earth rotation parameter table used for time and
        coordinate transformations can now be set, either in a context or per
        session, using ``astropy.utils.iers.earth_rotation_table``.
      * Added ``export_cache`` and ``import_cache`` to permit transporting
        downloaded data to machines with no Internet connection. Several new
        functions are available to investigate the cache contents; e.g.,
        ``check_download_cache`` can be used to confirm that the persistent
        cache has not become damaged.
      * A new ``astropy.utils.iers.LeapSeconds`` class has been added to track
        leap seconds.
    > astropy.visualization
      * Added a new ``time_support`` context manager/function for making it easy to
        plot and format ``Time`` objects in Matplotlib.
      * Added support for plotting any WCS compliant with the generalized (APE 14)
        WCS API with WCSAxes.
      * Improved display of information when inspecting ``WCSAxes.coords``.
      * Improved error checking for the ``slices=`` argument to ``WCSAxes``.
      * Added support for more solar frames in WCSAxes.
      * Add support for one dimensional plots to ``WCSAxes``.
      * Add a ``get_format_unit`` to ``wcsaxes.CoordinateHelper``.
      * ``WCSAxes`` now, by default, sets a default label for plot axes which is the
        WCS physical type (and unit) for that axis. This can be disabled using the
        ``coords[i].set_auto_axislabel(False)`` or by explicitly setting an axis
        label.
      * Fixed the display of tick labels when plotting all sky images that have a
        coord_wrap less than 360.
    > astropy.wcs
      * Added a ``astropy.wcs.wcsapi.pixel_to_pixel`` function that can be used to
        transform pixel coordinates in one dataset with a WCS to pixel coordinates
        in another dataset with a different WCS. This function is designed to be
        efficient when the input arrays are broadcasted views of smaller
        arrays.
      * Added a ``local_partial_pixel_derivatives`` function that can be used to
        determine a matrix of partial derivatives of each world coordinate with
        respect to each pixel coordinate.
      * Updated wcslib to v6.4.
      * Improved the  ``SlicedLowLevelWCS`` class in ``astropy.wcs.wcsapi`` to avoid
        storing chains of nested ``SlicedLowLevelWCS`` objects when applying multiple
        slicing operations in turn.
      * Added a ``wcs_info_str`` function to ``astropy.wcs.wcsapi`` to show a summary
        of an APE-14-compliant WCS as a string.
      * Added two new optional attributes to the APE 14 low-level WCS:
        ``pixel_axis_names`` and ``world_axis_names``.
      * Updated the WCS class to now correctly take and return ``Time`` objects in
        the high-level APE 14 API (e.g. ``pixel_to_world``.
      * ``SlicedLowLevelWCS`` now raises ``IndexError`` rather than ``ValueError`` on
        an invalid slice.
      * Added ``fit_wcs_from_points`` function to ``astropy.wcs.utils``. Fits a WCS
        object to set of matched detector/sky coordinates.
      * Fix various bugs in ``SlicedLowLevelWCS`` when the WCS being sliced was one
        dimensional.
  + API Changes
    > astropy.constants
      * Deprecated ``set_enabled_constants`` context manager. Use
        ``astropy.physical_constants`` and ``astropy.astronomical_constants``.

    > astropy.convolution
      * Removed the deprecated keyword argument ``interpolate_nan`` from
        ``convolve_fft``.
      * Removed the deprecated keyword argument ``stddev`` from
        ``Gaussian2DKernel``.
      * Deprecated and renamed ``MexicanHat1DKernel`` and ``MexicanHat2DKernel``
        to ``RickerWavelet1DKernel`` and ``RickerWavelet2DKernel``.
    > astropy.coordinates
      * Removed the ``recommended_units`` attribute from Representations; it was
        deprecated since 3.0.
      * Removed the deprecated frame attribute classes, ``FrameAttribute``,
        ``TimeFrameAttribute``, ``QuantityFrameAttribute``,
        ``CartesianRepresentationFrameAttribute``; deprecated since 3.0.
      * Removed ``longitude`` and ``latitude`` attributes from ``EarthLocation``;
        deprecated since 2.0.
      * The ``DifferentialAttribute`` for frame classes now passes through any input
        to the ``allowed_classes`` if only one allowed class is specified, i.e. this
        now allows passing a quantity in for frame attributes that use
        ``DifferentialAttribute``.
      * Removed the deprecated ``galcen_ra`` and ``galcen_dec`` attributes from the
        ``Galactocentric`` frame.
    > astropy.extern
      * Remove the bundled ``six`` module.
    > astropy.io.ascii
      * Masked column handling has changed, see ``astropy.table`` entry below.

    > astropy.io.misc
      * Masked column handling has changed, see ``astropy.table`` entry below.

      * Removed deprecated ``usecPickle`` kwarg from ``fnunpickle`` and
        ``fnpickle``.
    > astropy.io.fits
      * Masked column handling has changed, see ``astropy.table`` entry below.

      * ``io.fits.Header`` has been made safe for subclasses for copying and slicing.
        As a result of this change, the private subclass ``CompImageHeader``
        now always should be passed an explicit ``image_header``.
      * Removed the deprecated ``tolerance`` option in ``fitsdiff`` and
        ``io.fits.diff`` classes.
      * Removed deprecated keyword arguments for ``CompImageHDU``:
        ``compressionType``, ``tileSize``, ``hcompScale``, ``hcompSmooth``,
        ``quantizeLevel``.
    > astropy.io.votable
      * Changed ``pedantic`` argument to ``verify`` and change it to have three
        string-based options (``ignore``, ``warn``, and ``exception``) instead of
        just being a boolean. In addition, changed default to ``ignore``, which means
        that warnings will not be shown by default when loading VO tables.
    > astropy.modeling
      * Eliminates support for compound classes (but not compound instances!)
      * Slicing compound models more restrictive.
      * Shape of parameters now includes n_models as dimension.
      * Parameter instances now hold values instead of models.
      * Compound model parameters now share instance and value with
        constituent models.
      * No longer possible to assign slices of parameter values to model parameters
        attribute (it is possible to replace it with a complete array).
      * Many private attributes and methods have changed (see documentation).
      * Deprecated ``BlackBody1D`` model and ``blackbody_nu`` and
        ``blackbody_lambda`` functions.
      * The deprecated ``rotations.rotation_matrix_from_angle`` was removed.
      * Deprecated and renamed ``MexicanHat1D`` and ``MexicanHat2D``
        to ``RickerWavelet1D`` and ``RickerWavelet2D``.
      * Deprecated ``modeling.utils.ExpressionTree``.
    > astropy.stats
      * Removed the ``iters`` keyword from sigma clipping stats functions.
      * Renamed the ``a`` parameter to ``data`` in biweight stat functions.
      * Renamed the ``a`` parameter to ``data`` in ``median_absolute_deviation``.

      * Renamed the ``conflevel`` keyword to ``confidence_level`` in
        ``poisson_conf_interval``. Usage of ``conflevel`` now issues
        ``AstropyDeprecationWarning``.
      * Renamed the ``conf`` keyword to ``confidence_level`` in
        ``binom_conf_interval`` and ``binned_binom_proportion``. Usage of ``conf``
        now issues ``AstropyDeprecationWarning``.
      * Renamed the ``conf_lvl`` keyword to ``confidence_level`` in
        ``jackknife_stats``. Usage of ``conf_lvl`` now issues
        ``AstropyDeprecationWarning``.
    > astropy.table
      * The handling of masked columns in the ``Table`` class has changed in a way
        that may impact program behavior. Now a ``Table`` with ``masked=False``
        may contain both ``Column`` and ``MaskedColumn`` objects, and adding a
        masked column or row to a table no longer "upgrades" the table and columns
        to masked.  This means that tables with masked data which are read via
        ``Table.read()`` will now always have ``masked=False``, though specific
        columns will be masked as needed. Two new table properties
        ``has_masked_columns`` and ``has_masked_values`` were added. See the
        `Masking change in astropy 4.0 section within
        <https://docs.astropy.org/en/v4.0.x/table/masking.html>`_ for
        details.
      * Table operation functions such as ``join``, ``vstack``, ``hstack``, etc now
        always return a table with ``masked=False``, though the individual columns
        may be masked as necessary.
      * Changed implementation of ``Table.add_column()`` and ``Table.add_columns()``
        methods.  Now it is possible add any object(s) which can be converted or
        broadcasted to a valid column for the table.  ``Table.__setitem__`` now
        just calls ``add_column``.
      * Changed default table configuration setting ``replace_warnings`` from
        ``['slice']`` to ``[]``.  This removes the default warning when replacing
        a table column that is a slice of another column.
      * Removed the non-public method
        ``astropy.table.np_utils.recarray_fromrecords``.
    > astropy.tests
      * In addition to ``DeprecationWarning``, now ``FutureWarning`` and
        ``ImportWarning`` would also be turned into exceptions.
      * ``warnings_to_ignore_by_pyver`` option in
        ``enable_deprecations_as_exceptions()`` has changed. Please refer to API
        documentation.
      * Default settings for ``warnings_to_ignore_by_pyver`` are updated to remove
        very old warnings that are no longer relevant and to add a new warning
        caused by ``pytest-doctestplus``.
    > astropy.time
      * ``Time.get_ut1_utc`` now uses the auto-updated ``IERS_Auto`` by default,
        instead of the bundled ``IERS_B`` file.
      * Time formats that do not use ``val2`` now raise ValueError instead of
        silently ignoring a provided value.
      * Custom time formats can now accept floating-point types with extended
        precision. Existing time formats raise exceptions rather than discarding
        extended precision through conversion to ordinary floating-point.
      * Time formats (implemented in subclasses of ``TimeFormat``) now have
        their input and output routines more thoroughly validated, making it more
        difficult to create damaged ``Time`` objects.
      * The ``TimeDelta.to_value()`` method now can also take the ``format`` name
        as its argument, in which case the value will be calculated using the
        ``TimeFormat`` machinery. For this case, one can also pass a ``subfmt``
        argument to retrieve the value in another form than ``float``.
    > astropy.timeseries
      * Keyword ``midpoint_epoch`` is renamed to ``epoch_time``.
    > astropy.uncertainty
      * ``Distribution`` was rewritten such that it deals better with subclasses.
        As a result, Quantity distributions now behave correctly with ``to`` methods
        yielding new distributions of the kind expected for the starting distribution,
        and ``to_value`` yielding ``NdarrayDistribution`` instances.
    > astropy.units
      * For consistency with ``ndarray``, scalar ``Quantity.value`` will now return
        a numpy scalar rather than a python one.  This should help keep track of
        precision better, but may lead to unexpected results for the rare cases
        where numpy scalars behave differently than python ones (e.g., taking the
        square root of a negative number).
      * Removed the ``magnitude_zero_points`` module, which was deprecated in
        favour of ``astropy.units.photometric`` since 3.1.
      * ``EquivalentUnitsList`` now has a ``_repr_html_`` method to output a HTML
        table on a call to ``find_equivalent_units`` in Jupyter notebooks.
    > astropy.utils
      * ``download_file`` and related functions now accept a list of fallback
        sources, and they are able to update the cache at the user's request.
      * Allow ``astropy.utils.console.ProgressBarOrSpinner.map`` and
        ``.map_unordered`` to take an argument ``multiprocessing_start_method`` to
        control how subprocesses are started; the different methods (``fork``,
        ``spawn``, and ``forkserver``) have different implications in terms of
        security, efficiency, and behavioural anomalies. The option is useful in
        particular for cross-platform testing because Windows supports only ``spawn``
        while Linux defaults to ``fork``.
      * All operations that act on the astropy download cache now take an argument
        ``pkgname`` that allows one to specify which package's cache to use.

      * Removed deprecated ``funcsigs`` and ``futures`` from
        ``astropy.utils.compat``.
      * Removed the deprecated ``astropy.utils.compat.numpy`` module.
      * Deprecated ``InheritDocstrings`` as it is natively supported by
        Sphinx 1.7 or higher.
      * Deprecated ``astropy.utils.timer`` module, which has been moved to
        ``astroquery.utils.timer`` and will be part of ``astroquery`` 0.4.0.
      * Deprecated ``astropy.utils.misc.set_locale`` function, as it is meant for
        internal use only.
      * The implementation of ``data_info.DataInfo`` has changed (for a considerable
        performance boost). Generally, this should not affect simple subclasses, but
        because the class now uses ``__slots__`` any attributes on the class have to
        be explicitly given a slot.
      * ``IERS`` tables now use ``nan`` to mark missing values
        (rather than ``1e20``).
    > astropy.visualization
      * The default ``clip`` value is now ``False`` in ``ImageNormalize``.
      * The default ``clip`` value is now ``False`` in ``simple_norm``.

      * Infinite values are now excluded when calculating limits in
        ``ManualInterval`` and ``MinMaxInterval``.  They were already excluded in
        all other interval classes.
  + Bug Fixes
    > astropy.coordinates
      * The ``QuantityAttribute`` class now supports a None default value if a unit
        is specified.
      * When ``Representation`` classes with the same name are defined, this no
        longer leads to a ``ValueError``, but instead to a warning and the removal
        of both from the name registry (i.e., one either has to use the class itself
        to set, e.g., ``representation_type``, or refer to the class by its fully
        qualified name).
    > astropy.io.fits
      * Implemented skip (after warning) of header cards with reserved
        keywords in ``table_to_hdu``.
      * Add ``AstropyDeprecationWarning`` to ``read_table_fits`` when ``hdu=`` is
        selected, but does not match single present table HDU.
    > astropy.io.votable
      * Ignore BINARY2 null mask bits for string values
        on parsing a VOTable.  In this way, the reader should never create masked
        values for string types.
      * Corrected a spurious warning issued for the ``value`` attribute of the
        ``<OPTION>`` element in VOTable, as well as a test that erroneously
        treated the warning as acceptable.
    > astropy.nddata
      * ``Cutout2D`` will now get the WCS from its first argument if that argument
        has with WCS property.
      * ``overlap_slices`` will now raise a ``ValueError`` if the input
        position contains any non-finite values (e.g. NaN or inf).
    > astropy.stats
      * Fixed a bug where ``bayesian_blocks`` returned a single edge.
      * Fixed input data type validation for ``bayesian_blocks`` to work int
        arrays.
    > astropy.table
      * Fix bug where adding a column consisting of a list of masked arrays was
        dropping the masks.
      * ``Quantity`` columns with custom units can now round-trip via FITS tables,
        as long as the custom unit is enabled during reading (otherwise, the unit
        will become an ``UnrecognizedUnit``).
      * Fix bug where string values could be truncated when inserting into a
        ``Column`` or ``MaskedColumn``, or when adding or inserting a row containing
        string values.
    > astropy.time
      * Fix bug when ``Time`` object is created with only masked elements.
      * Fix inaccuracy when converting between TimeDelta and datetime.timedelta.

    > astropy.units
      * Ensure that output from test functions of and comparisons between quantities
        can be stored into pre-allocated output arrays (using ``out=array``)
    > astropy.utils
      * For the default ``IERS_Auto`` table, which combines IERS A and B values, the
        IERS nutation parameters "dX_2000A" and "dY_2000A" are now also taken from
        the actual IERS B file rather than from the B values stored in the IERS A
        file.  Any differences should be negligible for any practical application,
        but this may help exactly reproducing results.
    > astropy.visualization
      * Calling ``WCSAxes.set_axis_off()`` now correctly turns off drawing the Axes.

      * Fix incorrect transformation behavior in ``WCSAxes.plot_coord`` and correctly
        handle when input coordinates are not already in spherical representations.

      * Fixed ``ImageNormalize`` so that when it is intialized without
        ``data`` it will still use the input ``interval`` class.
      * Fixed ``ImageNormalize`` to handle input data with non-finite
        values.
    > astropy.wcs
      * Fix incorrect value returned by
        ``wcsapi.HighLevelWCSWrapper.axis_correlation_matrix``.
      * Fix NaN-masking of world coordinates when some but not all of the coordinates
        were flagged as invalid by WCSLIB. This occurred for example with WCS with >2
        dimensions where two of the dimensions were celestial coordinates and pixel
        coordinates ouside of the 'sky' were converted to world coordinates -
        previously all world coordinates were masked even if uncorrelated with the
        celestial axes, but this is no longer the case.
      * The default WCS to celestial frame mapping for world coordinate systems that
        specify ``TLON`` and ``TLAT`` coordinates will now return an ITRS frame with
        the representation class set to ``SphericalRepresentation``. This fixes a bug
        that caused ``WCS.pixel_to_world`` to raise an error for such world
        coordinate systems.
      * ``FITSWCSAPIMixin`` now returns tuples not lists from ``pixel_to_world`` and
        ``world_to_pixel``.
  + Other Changes and Additions
    * Versions of Python <3.6 are no longer supported.
    * Matplotlib 2.1 and later is now required.
    * Versions of Numpy <1.16 are no longer supported.
    * Updated the bundled CFITSIO library to 3.470. See
      ``cextern/cfitsio/docs/changes.txt`` for additional information.
    * The bundled ERFA was updated to version 1.7.0. This is based on
      SOFA 20190722. This includes a fix to avoid precision loss for negative
      JDs, and also includes additional routines to allow updates to the
      leap-second table.
    * The default server for the IERS data files has been updated to reflect
      long-term downtime of the canonical USNO server.

  + Bug fixes
    * astropy.convolution
      > Fixed a bug in ``discretize_oversample_1D/2D()`` from

        are not compatible with a containing representation's units.
      > Changed the timescale in ICRS to CIRS from 'tdb' to 'tt' conversion and
        vice-versa, as the erfa function that gets called in the process, pnm06a
        accepts time in TT.
    * astropy.io.ascii
      > Fixed the fast reader when used in parallel and with the multiprocessing
        'spawn' method (which is the default on MacOS X with Python 3.8 and later),
        and enable parallel fast reader on Windows.
    * astropy.io.fits
      > Fixes bug where an invalid TRPOS<n> keyword was being generated for FITS
        time column when no location was available.
      > Fixed a wrong exception when converting a Table with a unit that is not FITS
        compliant and not convertible to a string using ``format='fits'``.
      > Fixed an issue with A3DTABLE extension that could not be read.
      > Fixed the update of the header when creating GroupsHDU from data.
    * astropy.nddata
      > Fix to ``add_array``, which now accepts ``array_small`` having dimensions
        equal to ``array_large``, instead of only allowing smaller sizes of
        arrays.
    * astropy.stats
      > Fixed ``median_absolute_deviation`` for the case where ``ignore_nan=True``
        and an input masked array contained both NaNs and infs.
    * astropy.table
      > Comparisons between ``Column`` instances and ``Quantity`` will now
        correctly take into account the unit (as was already the case for
        regular operations such as addition).
    * astropy.time
      > Allow ``Time`` to be initialized with an empty value for all formats.
      > Fixed a troubling bug in which ``Time`` could loose precision, with deviations
        of 300 ns.
    * astropy.timeseries
      > Fixed handling of ``Quantity`` input data for all methods of
        ``LombScarge.false_alarm_probabilty``.
    * astropy.units
      > Allow conversion of ``Column`` with logarithmic units to a suitable
        ``Quantity`` subclass if ``subok=True``.
      > Ensured that we simplify powers to smaller denominators if that is
        consistent within rounding precision.
      > Ensured that the powers shown in a unit's repr are always correct,
        not oversimplified.
    * astropy.utils
      > Fixed ``find_api_page`` access by using custom request headers and HTTPS
        when version is specified.
      > Make ``download_file`` (and by extension ``get_readable_fileobj`` and others)
        check the size of downloaded files against the size claimed by the server.
      > Fix ``find_current_module`` so that it works properly if astropy is being used
        inside a bundle such as that produced by PyInstaller.
      > Fix path to renamed classes, which previously included duplicate path/module
        information under certain circumstances.
    * astropy.visualization
      > Silence numpy runtime warnings in ``WCSAxes`` when drawing grids.
    * astropy.wcs
      > Fixed equality test between ``cunit`` where the first element was equal but
        the following elements differed.
      > Fixed a crash while loading a WCS from headers containing duplicate SIP
        keywords.
      > Fixed a possible buffer overflow when using too large negative indices for
        ``cunit`` or ``ctype``
      > Fixed reference counting in ``WCSBase.__init__``
      > Fix ``SlicedLowLevelWCS`` ``world_to_pixel_values`` and

      > Fixed a bug that caused ``WCS.array_shape``, ``WCS.pixel_shape`` and
        ``WCS.pixel_bounds`` to be incorrect after using ``WCS.sub``.
  + Other Changes and Additions
    * Fixed a bug that caused files outside of the astropy module directory to be
      included as package data, resulting in some cases in errors when doing
      repeated builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 23 01:55:47 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 3.2.1
  + Bug fixes
    * astropy.io.fits
      > Avoid reporting a warning with ``BinTableHDU.from_columns`` with keywords that
        are not provided by the user.  
      > Fix ``Header.fromfile`` to work on FITS files. 
      > Fix reading of empty ``BinTableHDU`` when stored in a gzip-compressed file.
    * astropy.table
      > Fix a problem where mask was dropped when creating a ``MaskedColumn``
        from a list of ``MaskedArray`` objects. 
    * astropy.wcs
      > Added ``None`` to be displayed as a ``world_axis_physical_types`` in
        the ``WCS`` repr, as ``None`` values are now supported in ``APE14``. 
- Update to 3.2
  + New Features
    * astropy.constants
      > Add CODATA 2018 constants but not make them default because the
        redefinition of SI units that will follow has not been implemented
        yet. 
    * astropy.coordinates
      > New ``BarycentricMeanEcliptic``, ``HeliocentricTrueEcliptic`` and
        ``GeocentricTrueEcliptic`` frames.
        The ecliptic frames are no longer considered experimental. 
      > The default time scale for epochs like 'J2000' or 'B1975' is now "tt",
        which is the correct one for 'J2000' and avoids leap-second warnings
        for epochs in the far future or past. 
    * astropy.extern
      > Bundled ``six`` now emits ``AstropyDeprecationWarning``. It will be removed
        in 4.0. 
    * astropy.io.ascii
      > IPAC tables now output data types of ``float`` instead of ``double``, or
        ``int`` instead of ``long``, based on the column ``dtype.itemsize``. 
      > Update handling of MaskedColumn columns when using the 'data_mask' serialization
        method.  This can make writing ECSV significantly faster if the data do not
        actually have any masked values. 
      > Fixed a bug that caused newlines to be incorrect when writing out ASCII tables
        on Windows (they were ``\r\r\n`` instead of ``\r\n``). 
    * astropy.io.misc
      > Implement serialization of ``TimeDelta`` in ASDF. 
      > Implement serialization of ``EarthLocation`` in ASDF. 
      > Implement serialization of ``SkyCoord`` in ASDF. 
      > Support serialization of Astropy tables with mixin columns in ASDF. 
      > No warnings when reading HDF5 files with only one table and no ``path=``
        argument 
      > The HDF5 writer will now create a default table instead of raising an
        exception when ``path=`` is not specified and when writing to empty/new HDF5
        files. 
    * astropy.io.fits
      > Optimize parsing of cards within the ``Header`` class. 
      > Optimize the parsing of headers to get the structural keywords that are
        needed to find extensions. Thanks to this, getting a random HDU from a file
        with many extensions is much faster than before, in particular when the
        extension headers contain many keywords. 
      >  Change behavior of FITS undefined value in ``Header`` such that ``None``
              is used in Python to represent FITS undefined when using dict interface.
              ``Undefined`` can also be assigned and is translated to ``None``.
              Previously setting a header card value to ``None`` resulted in an
              empty string field rather than a FITS undefined value. 
      > Allow ``Header.fromstring`` and ``Card.fromstring`` to accept ``bytes``.
    * astropy.io.registry
      > Implement ``Table`` reader and writer for ``ASDF``. 
      > Implement ``Table`` reader and writer methods to wrap ``pandas`` I/O methods
        for CSV, Fixed width format, HTML, and JSON. 
      > Add ``help()`` and ``list_formats()`` methods to unified I/O ``read`` and
        ``write`` methods. For example ``Table.read.help()`` gives help on available
        ``Table`` read formats and ``Table.read.help('fits')`` gives detailed
        help on the arguments for reading FITS table file. 
    * astropy.table
      > Initializing a table with ``Table(rows=...)``, if the first item is an ``OrderedDict``,
        now uses the column order of the first row. 
      > Added new pprint_all() and pformat_all() methods to Table. These two new
        methods print the entire table by default. 
      > Removed restriction of initializing a Table from a dict with copy=False. 
      > Improved speed of table row access by a factor of about 2-3.  Improved speed
        of Table len() by a factor of around 3-10 (depending on the number of columns).
      > Improved the Table - pandas ``DataFrame`` interface (``to_pandas()`` and
        ``from_pandas()``).  Mixin columns like ``Time`` and ``Quantity`` can now be
        converted to pandas by flattening the columns as necessary to plain
        columns.  ``Time`` and ``TimeDelta`` columns get converted to
        corresponding pandas date or time delta types.  The ``DataFrame``
        index is now handled in the conversion methods. 
      > Added ``rename_columns`` method to rename multiple columns in one call.
      > Improved Table performance by reducing unnecessary calls to copy and deepcopy,
        especially as related to the table and column ``meta`` attributes.  Changed the
        behavior when slicing a table (either in rows or with a list of column names)
        so now the sliced output gets a light (key-only) copy of ``meta`` instead of a
        deepcopy.  Changed the ``Table.meta`` class-level descriptor so that assigning
        directly to ``meta``, e.g. ``tbl.meta = new_meta`` no longer does a deepcopy
        and instead just directly assigns the ``new_meta`` object reference.  Changed
        Table initialization so that input ``meta`` is copied only if ``copy=True``.
      > Improved Table slicing performance with internal implementation changes
        related to column attribute access and certain input validation. 
      > Added ``reverse`` argument to the ``sort`` and ``argsort`` methods to allow
        sorting in reverse order. 
      > Improved ``Table.sort()`` performance by removing ``self[keys]`` from code
        which is creating deep copies of ``meta`` attribute and adding a new keyword
        ``names`` in ``get_index()`` to get index by using a list or tuple containing
        names of columns. 
      > Expose ``represent_mixins_as_columns`` as a public function in the
        ``astropy.table`` subpackage.  This previously-private function in the
        ``table.serialize`` module is used to represent mixin columns in a Table as
        one or more plain Column objects. 
    * astropy.timeseries
      > Added a new astropy.timeseries sub-package to represent and manipulate
        sampled and binned time series. 
      > The ``BoxLeastSquares`` and ``LombScargle`` classes have been moved to
        ``astropy.timeseries.periodograms`` from ``astropy.stats``. 
      > Added the ability to provide absolute ``Time`` objects to the
        ``BoxLeastSquares`` and ``LombScargle`` periodogram classes. 
      > Added model inspection methods (``model_parameters()``, ``design_matrix()``,
        and ``offset()``) to ``astropy.timeseries.LombScargle`` class .
    * astropy.units
      > ``Quantity`` overrides of ``ndarray`` methods such as ``sum``, ``min``,
        ``max``, which are implemented via reductions, have been removed since they
        are dealt with in ``Quantity.__array_ufunc__``. This should not affect
        subclasses, but they may consider doing similarly.   Note that this
        does not include methods that use more complicated python code such as
        ``mean``, ``std`` and ``var``. 
    * astropy.visualization
      > Added ``CompositeStretch``, which inherits from ``CompositeTransform`` and
        also ``BaseStretch`` so that it can be used with ``ImageNormalize``. 
      > Added a ``log_a`` argument to the ``simple_norm`` method. Similar to the
        exposing of the ``asinh_a`` argument for ``AsinhStretch``, the new
        ``log_a`` argument is now exposed for ``LogStretch``. 
    * astropy.wcs
      > WCSLIB was updated to v 6.2.
        This adds support for time-related WCS keywords (WCS Paper VII).
        FITS headers containing ``Time`` axis are parsed and the axis is included in
        the WCS object. 
      > The ``OBSGEO`` attribute as expanded to 6 members - ``XYZLBH``. 
      > Added a new class ``SlicedLowLevelWCS`` in ``astropy.wcs.wcsapi`` that can be
        used to slice any WCS that conforms to the ``BaseLowLevelWCS`` API. 
      > Updated implementation of ``WCS.__getitem__`` and ``WCS.slice`` to now return
        a ``SlicedLowLevelWCS`` rather than raising an error when reducing the
        dimensionality of the WCS. 
  + API Changes
    * astropy.coordinates
      > ``QuantityAttribute`` no longer has a default value for ``default``.  The
        previous value of None was misleading as it always was an error. 
      > The default J2000 has been changed to use be January 1, 2000 12:00 TT instead
        of UTC.  This is more in line with convention. 
    * astropy.io.ascii
      > IPAC tables now output data types of ``float`` instead of ``double``, or
        ``int`` instead of ``long``, based on the column ``dtype.itemsize``. 
    * astropy.io.misc
      > Unit equivalencies can now be serialized to ASDF. 
    * astropy.modeling
      > Composition of model classes is deprecated and will be removed in 4.0.
        Composition of model instances remain unaffected.
    * astropy.stats
      > The ``BoxLeastSquares`` and ``LombScargle`` classes have been moved to the
        ``astropy.timeseries.periodograms`` module and will now emit a deprecation
        warning when imported from ``astropy.stats``. 
    * astropy.table
      > Converting an empty table to an array using ``as_array`` method now returns
        an empty array instead of ``None``. 
      > Changed the behavior when slicing a table (either in rows or with a list of column
        names) so now the sliced output gets a light (key-only) copy of ``meta`` instead of
        a deepcopy.  Changed the ``Table.meta`` class-level descriptor so that assigning
        directly to ``meta``, e.g. ``tbl.meta = new_meta`` no longer does a deepcopy
        and instead just directly assigns the ``new_meta`` object reference. Changed
        Table initialization so that input ``meta`` is copied only if ``copy=True``.
      > Added a keyword ``names`` in ``Table.as_array()``.  If provided this specifies
        a list of column names to include for the returned structured array. 
    * astropy.tests
      > Removed ``pytest_plugins`` as they are completely broken for ``pytest>=4``.
      > Removed the ``astropy.tests.plugins.config`` plugin and removed the
        ``--astropy-config-dir`` and ``--astropy-cache-dir`` options from
        testing. Please use caching functionality that is natively in ``pytest``.
    * astropy.time
      > The default time scale for epochs like 'J2000' or 'B1975' is now "tt",
        which is the correct one for 'J2000' and avoids leap-second warnings
        for epochs in the far future or past. 
    * astropy.units
      > Unit equivalencies can now be introspected. 
    * astropy.wcs
      > The ``world_to_pixel``, ``world_to_array_index*``, ``pixel_to_world*`` and
        ``array_index_to_world*`` methods now all consistently return scalars, arrays,
        or objects not wrapped in a one-element tuple/list when only one scalar,
        array, or object (as was previously already the case for ``WCS.pixel_to_world``
        and ``WCS.array_index_to_world``). 
    * astropy.utils
      > It is now possible to control the number of cores used by ``ProgressBar.map``
        by passing a positive integer as the ``multiprocess`` keyword argument. Use
        ``True`` to use all cores. 
  + Bug Fixes
    * astropy.coordinates
      > ``BarycentricTrueEcliptic``, ``HeliocentricTrueEcliptic`` and
        ``GeocentricTrueEcliptic`` now use the correct transformation
        (including nutation), whereas the new ``*MeanEcliptic`` classes
        use the nutation-free transformation. 
      > Representations with ``float32`` coordinates can now be transformed,
        although the output will always be ``float64``. 
      > Fixed bug that prevented using differentials with HCRS<->ICRS
        transformations. 
    * astropy.io.ascii
      > Fixed a bug where an exception was raised when writing a table which includes
        mixin columns (e.g. a Quantity column) and the output format was specified
        using the ``formats`` keyword. 
    * astropy.io.misc
      > Fixed bug in ASDF tag that inadvertently introduced dependency on ``pytest``.
    * astropy.modeling
      > Fixed slowness for certain compound models consisting of large numbers
        of multi-input models
      > Fixed bugs in fitting of compound models with units. 
    * astropy.nddata
      > Fixed bug in reading multi-extension FITS files written by earlier versions
        of ``CCDData``. 
      > Fixed two errors in the way ``CCDData`` handles FITS files with WCS in the
        header. Some of the WCS keywords that should have been removed from the
        header were not, potentially leading to FITS files with inconsistent
        WCS. 
    * astropy.table
      > Fixed a bug when initializing from an empty list: ``Table([])`` no longer
        results in a crash. 
      > Fixed a bug when initializing from an existing ``Table``.  In this case the
        input ``meta`` argument was being ignored.  Now the input ``meta``, if
        supplied, will be used as the ``meta`` for the new ``Table``. 
      > Fix the conversion of bytes values to Python ``str`` with ``Table.tolist``.
    * astropy.time
      > Fixed a number of issues to ensure a consistent output type resulting from
        multiplication or division involving a ``TimeDelta`` instance. The output is
        now always a ``TimeDelta`` if the result is a time unit (like u.s or u.d),
        otherwise it will be a ``Quantity``. 
      > Multiplication between two ``TimeDelta`` instances is now possible, resulting
        in a ``Quantity`` with units of time squared (division already correctly
        resulted in a dimensionless ``Quantity``). 
      > Like for comparisons, addition, and subtraction of ``Time`` instances with
        with non-time instances, multiplication and division of ``TimeDelta``
        instances with incompatible other instances no longer immediately raise an
        ``UnitsError`` or ``TypeError`` (depending on the other instance), but
        rather go through the regular Python mechanism of ``TimeDelta`` returning
        ``NotImplemented`` (which will lead to a regular ``TypeError`` unless the
        other instance can handle ``TimeDelta``). 
      > Corrected small rounding errors that could cause the ``jd2`` values in
        ``Time`` to fall outside the range of -0.5 to 0.5. 
    * astropy.units
      > Added a ``Quantity.to_string`` method to add flexibility to the string formatting
        of quantities. It produces unadorned or LaTeX strings, and accepts two different
        sets of delimiters in the latter case: ``inline`` and ``display``. 
      > Ensure classes that mimic quantities by having a ``unit`` attribute and/or
        ``to`` and ``to_value`` methods can be properly used to initialize ``Quantity``
        or set ``Quantity`` instance items. 
      > Add support for ``<<`` to create logarithmic units. 
      > Add support for the ``clip`` ufunc, which in numpy 1.17 is used to implement
        ``np.clip``.  As part of that, remove the ``Quantity.clip`` method under
        numpy 1.17. 
      > Fix parsing of numerical powers in FITS-compatible units. 
    * astropy.wcs
      > Added a ``PyUnitListProxy_richcmp`` method in ``UnitListProxy`` class to enable
        ``WCS.wcs.cunit`` equality testing. It helps to check whether the two instances of
        ``WCS.wcs.cunit`` are equal or not by comparing the data members of
        ``UnitListProxy`` class 
      > Fixed ``SlicedLowLevelWCS`` when ``array_shape`` is ``None``. 
      > Do not attempt to delete repeated distortion keywords multiple times when
        loading distortions with ``_read_distortion_kw`` and
        ``_read_det2im_kw``. 
  + Other Changes and Additions
      > Update bundled expat to 2.2.6. 
      > Added instructions for uploading releases to Zenodo. 
      > The bug fixes to the behaviour of ``TimeDelta`` for multiplcation and
        division, which ensure that the output is now always a ``TimeDelta`` if the
        result is a time unit (like u.s or u.d) and otherwise a ``Quantity``, imply
        that sometimes the output type will be different than it was before. 
      > For types unrecognized by ``TimeDelta``, multiplication and division now
        will consistently return a ``TypeError`` if the other instance cannot handle
        ``TimeDelta`` (rather than ``UnitsError`` or ``TypeError`` depending on
        presumed abilities of the other instance). 
      > Multiplication between two ``TimeDelta`` instances will no longer result in
        an ``OperandTypeError``, but rather result in a ``Quantity`` with units of
        time squared (division already correctly resulted in a dimensionless
        ``Quantity``). 
      > Made running the tests insensitive to local user configuration when running
        the tests in parallel mode or directly with pytest. 
      > Added a narrative style guide to the documentation for contributor reference.
      > Ensure we call numpy equality functions in a way that reduces the number
        of ``DeprecationWarning``. 
  + Installation
      > We now require setuptools 30.3.0 or later to install the core astropy
        package. 
      > We now define groups of dependencies that can be installed with pip, e.g.
        ``pip install astropy[all]`` (to install all optional dependencies).

  + New Features
    > astropy.convolution
      * ``convolve`` now accepts any array-like input, not just ``numpy.ndarray`` or
        lists. [#7303]
      * ``convolve`` Now raises AstropyUserWarning if nan_treatment='interpolate' and
        preserve_nan=False and NaN values are present post convolution. [#8088]
    > astropy.coordinates
      * The ``SkyCoord.from_name`` constructor now has the ability to create
        coordinate objects by parsing object catalogue names that have embedded
        J-coordinates. [#7830]
      * The new function ``make_transform_graph_docs`` can be used to create a
        docstring graph from a custom ``TransformGraph`` object. [#7135]
      * ``KDTree`` for catalog matching is now built with sliding midpoint rule
        rather than standard.  In code, this means setting ``compact_nodes=False``
        and ``balanced_tree=False`` in ``cKDTree``. The sliding midpoint rule is much
        more suitable for catalog matching, and results in 1000x speedup in some
        cases. [#7324]
      * Additional information about a site loaded from the Astropy sites registry is
        now available in ``EarthLocation.info.meta``. [#7857]
      * Added a ``concatenate_representations`` function to combine coordinate
        representation data and any associated differentials. [#7922]
      * ``BaseCoordinateFrame`` will now check for a method named
        ``_astropy_repr_in_frame`` when constructing the string forms of attributes.
        Allowing any class to control how ``BaseCoordinateFrame`` represents it when
        it is an attribute of a frame. [#7745]
      * Some rarely-changed attributes of frame classes are now cached, resulting in
        speedups (up to 50% in some cases) when creating new scalar frame or
        ``SkyCoord`` objects. [#7949, #5952]
      * Added a ``directional_offset_by`` method to ``SkyCoord`` that computes a new
        coordinate given a coordinate, position angle, and angular separation [#5727]
    > astropy.cosmology
      * The default cosmology has been changed from ``WMAP9`` to ``Planck15``. [#8123]
      * Distance calculations with ``LambaCDM`` with no radiation (T_CMB0=0)
        are now 20x faster by using elliptic integrals for non-flat cases. [#7155]
      * Distance calculations with ``FlatLambaCDM`` with no radiation (T_CMB0=0)
        are now 20x faster by using the hypergeometric function solution
        for this special case. [#7087]
      * Age calculations with ``FlatLambdaCDM`` with no radiation (Tcmb0=0)
        are now 1000x faster by using analytic solutions instead of integrating.
        [#7117]
    > astropy.io.ascii
      * Latex reader now ignores ``\toprule``, ``\midrule``, and ``\bottomrule``
        commands. [#7349]
      * Added the RST (Restructured-text) table format and the fast version of the
        RDB reader to the set of formats that are guessed by default. [#5578]
      * The read trace (used primarily for debugging) now includes guess argument
        sets that were skipped entirely e.g. for not supporting user-supplied kwargs.
        All guesses thus removed from ``filtered_guess_kwargs`` are now listed as
        "Disabled" at the beginning of the trace. [#5578]
      * Emit a warning when reading an ECSV file without specifying the ``format``
        and without PyYAML installed.  Previously this silently fell through to
        parsing as a basic format file and the file metadata was lost. [#7580]
      * Optionally allow writing masked columns to ECSV with the mask explicitly
        specified as a separate column instead of marking masked elements with ""
        (empty string).  This allows handling the case of a masked string column
        with "" data rows.  [#7481]
    > astropy.io.misc
      * Added support for saving all representation classes and many coordinate
        frames to the asdf format. [#7079]
      * Added support for saving models with units to the asdf format. [#7237]
      * Added a new ``character_as_bytes`` keyword to the HDF5 Table reading
        function to control whether byte string columns in the HDF5 file
        are left as bytes or converted to unicode.  The default is to read
        as bytes (``character_as_bytes=True``). [#7024, #8017]
    > astropy.io.fits
      * ``HDUList.pop()`` now accepts string and tuple extension name
        specifications. [#7236]
      * Add an ``ignore_hdus`` keyword to ``FITSDiff`` to allow ignoring HDUs by
        NAME when diffing two FITS files [#7538]
      * Optionally allow writing masked columns to FITS with the mask explicitly
        specified as a separate column instead of using the FITS standard of
        certain embedded null values (``NaN`` for float, ``TNULL`` for integers).
        This can be used to work around limitations in the FITS standard. [#7481]
      * All time coordinates can now be written to and read from FITS binary tables,
        including those with vectorized locations. [#7430]
      * The ``fitsheader`` command line tool now supports a ``dfits+fitsort`` mode,
        and the dotted notation for keywords (e.g. ``ESO.INS.ID``). [#7240]
      * Fall back to reading arrays using mode='denywrite' if mode='readonly' fails
        when using memory-mapping. This solves cases on some platforms when the
        available address space was less than the file size (even when using memory
        mapping). [#7926]
    > astropy.modeling
      * Add a ``Multiply`` model which preserves unit through evaluate, unlike
        ``Scale`` which is dimensionless. [#7210]
      * Add a ``uses_quantity`` property to ``Model`` which allows introspection of if
        the ``Model`` can accept ``Quantity`` objects. [#7417]
      * Add a ``separability_matrix`` function which returns the correlation matrix
        of inputs and outputs. [#7803]
      * Fixed compatibility of ``JointFitter`` with the latest version of Numpy. [#7984]
      * Add ``prior`` and ``posterior`` constraints to modeling parameters. These are
        not used by any current fitters, but are provided to allow user code to
        experiment with Bayesian fitters.  [#7558]
    > astropy.nddata
      * ``NDUncertainty`` objects now have a ``quantity`` attribute for simple
        conversion to quantities. [#7704]
      * Add a ``bitmask`` module that provides functions for manipulating bitmasks
        and data quality (DQ) arrays. [#7944]
    > astropy.stats
      * Add an ``astropy.stats.bls`` module with an implementation of the "box least
        squares" periodogram that is commonly used for discovering transiting
        exoplanets and eclipsing binaries. [#7391]
    > astropy.table
      * Added support for full use of ``Time`` mixin column for join, hstack, and
        vstack table operations. [#6888]
      * Added a new table index engine, ``SCEngine``, based on the Sorted Containers
        package. [#7574]
      * Add a new keyword argument ``serialize_method`` to ``Table.write`` to
        control how ``Time`` and ``MaskedColumn`` columns are written. [#7481]
      * Allow mixin columns to be used in table ``group`` and ``unique``
        functions. This applies to both the key columns and the other data
        columns. [#7712]
      * Added support for stacking ``Column``, mixin column (e.g. ``Quantity``,
        ``Time``) or column-like objects. [#7674]
      * Added support for inserting a row into a Table that has ``Time`` or
        ``TimeDelta`` column(s). [#7897]
    > astropy.tests
      * Added an option ``--readonly`` to the test command to change the
        permissions on the temporary installation location to read-only. [#7598]
    > astropy.time
      * Allow array-valued ``Time`` object to be modified in place. [#6028]
      * Added support for missing values (masking) to the ``Time`` class. [#6028]
      * Added supper for a 'local' time scale (for free-running clocks, etc.),
        and round-tripping to the corresponding FITS time scale. [#7122]
      * Added `datetime.timedelta` format class for ``TimeDelta``. [#7441]
      * Added ``strftime`` and ``strptime`` methods to ``Time`` class.
        These methods are similar to those in the Python standard library
        `time` package and provide flexible input and output formatting. [#7323]
      * Added ``datetime64`` format to the ``Time`` class to support working with
        ``numpy.datetime64`` dtype arrays. [#7361]
      * Add fractional second support for ``strftime`` and ``strptime`` methods
        of ``Time`` class. [#7705]
      * Added an ``insert`` method to allow inserting one or more values into a
        ``Time`` or ``TimeDelta`` object. [#7897]
      * Remove timescale from string version of FITS format time string.
        The timescale is not part of the FITS standard and should not be included.
        This change may cause some compatibility issues for code that relies on
        round-tripping a FITS format string with a timescale. Strings generated
        from previous versions of this package are still understood but a
        DeprecationWarning will be issued. [#7870]
    > astropy.uncertainty
      * This sub-package was added as a "preview" (i.e. API unstable), containing
        the ``Distribution`` class and associated convenience functions. [#6945]
    > astropy.units
      * Add complex numbers support for ``Quantity._repr_latex_``. [#7676]
      * Add ``thermodynamic_temperature`` equivalency to convert between
        Jy/beam and "thermodynamic temperature" for cosmology. [#7054]
      * Add millibar unit. [#7863]
      * Add maggy and nanomaggy unit, as well as associated ``zero_point_flux``
        equivalency. [#7891]
      * ``AB`` and ``ST`` are now enabled by default, and have alternate names
        ``ABflux`` and ``STflux``. [#7891]
      * Added ``littleh`` unit and associated ``with_H0`` equivalency. [#7970]
    > astropy.visualization
      * Added ``imshow_norm`` function, which combines imshow and creation of a
        ``ImageNormalize`` object. [#7785]
    > astropy.visualization.wcsaxes
      * Add support for setting ``set_separator(None)`` in WCSAxes to use default
        separators. [#7570]
      * Added two keyword argument options to ``CoordinateHelper.set_format_unit``:
        ``decimal`` can be used to specify whether to use decimal formatting for the
        labels (by default this is False for degrees and hours and True otherwise),
        and ``show_decimal_unit`` can be used to determine whether the units should be
        shown for decimal labels. [#7318]
      * Added documentation for ``transform=`` and ``coord_meta=``. [#7698]
      * Allow ``coord_meta=`` to optionally include ``format_unit=``. [#7848]
      * Add support for more rcParams related to the grid, ticks, and labels, and
        should work with most built-in Matplotlib styles. [#7961]
      * Improved rendering of outward-facing ticks. [#7961]
      * Add support for ``tick_params`` (which is a standard Matplotlib
        function/method) on both the ``WCSAxes`` class and the individual
        ``CoordinateHelper`` classes. Note that this is provided for compatibility
        with Matplotlib syntax users may be familiar with, but it is not the
        preferred way to change settings. Instead, methods such as ``set_ticks``
        should be preferred. [#7969]
      * Moved the argument ``exclude_overlapping`` from ``set_ticks`` to
        ``set_ticklabel``. [#7969]
      * Added a ``pad=`` argument to ``set_ticklabel`` to provide a way to control
        the padding between ticks and tick labels. [#7969]
      * Added support for setting the tick direction in ``set_ticks`` using the
        ``direction=`` keyword argument. [#7969]
    > astropy.wcs
      * Map ITRS frames to terrestrial WCS coordinates. This will make it possible to
        use WCSAxes to make figures that combine both celestial and terrestrial
        features. An example is plotting the coordinates of an astronomical transient
        over an all- sky satellite image to illustrate the position relative to the
        Earth at the time of the event. The ITRS frame is identified with WCSs that
        use the ``TLON-`` and ``TLAT-`` coordinate types. There are several examples
        of WCSs where this syntax is used to describe terrestrial coordinate systems:
        Section 7.4.1 of `WCS in FITS "Paper II" <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...395.1077C>`_
        and the `WCSTools documentation <http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/wcstools.multiwcs.html>`_.
        [#6990]
      * Added the abstract base class for the low-level WCS API described in APE 14
        (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1188875). [#7325]
      * Add ``WCS.contains()`` function to check if the WCS footprint contains a given sky coordinate. [#7273]
      * Added the abstract base class for the high-level WCS API described in APE 14
        (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1188875). [#7325]
      * Added the high-level wrapper class for low-level WCS objects as described in
        APE 14 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1188875). [#7326]
      * Added a new property ``WCS.has_distortion``. [#7326]
      * Deprecated ``_naxis1`` and ``_naxis2`` in favor of ``pixel_shape``. [#7973]
      * Added compatibility to wcslib version 6. [#8093]
  + API Changes
    > astropy.convolution
      * ``kernel`` can now be a tuple. [#7561]
      * Not technically an API changes, however, the docstring indicated that ``boundary=None``
        was the default when actually it is ``boundary='fill'``. The docstring has been corrected,
        however, someone may interpret this as an API change not realizing that nothing has actually
        changed. [#7293]
      * ``interpolate_replace_nans()`` can no longer accept the keyword argument
        ``preserve_nan``. It is explicitly set to ``False``. [#8088]
    > astropy.coordinates
      * Fixed ``astropy.coordinates.concatenate`` to include velocity data in the
        concatenation. [#7922]
      * Changed the name of the single argument to ``Frame.realize_frame()`` from the
        (incorrect) ``representation_type`` to ``data``. [#7923]
      * Negative parallaxes passed to ``Distance()`` now raise an error by default
        (``allow_negative=False``), or are converted to NaN values with a warning
        (``allow_negative=True``). [#7988]
      * Negating a ``SphericalRepresentation`` object now changes the angular
        coordinates (by rotating 180º) instead of negating the distance. [#7988]
      * Creation of new frames now generally creates copies of frame attributes,
        rather than inconsistently either copying or making references. [#8204]
      * The frame class method ``is_equivalent_frame`` now checks for equality of
        components to determine if a frame is the same when it has frame attributes
        that are representations, rather than checking if they are the same
        object. [#8218]
    > astropy.io.ascii
      * If a fast reader is explicitly selected (e.g. ``fast_reader='force'``) and
        options which are incompatible with the fast reader are provided
        (e.g. ``quotechar='##'``) then now a ``ParameterError`` exception will be
        raised. [#5578]
      * The fast readers will now raise ``InconsistentTableError`` instead of
        ``CParserError`` if the number of data and header columns do not match.
        [#5578]
      * Changed a number of ``ValueError`` exceptions to ``InconsistentTableError``
        in places where the exception is related to parsing a table which is
        inconsistent with the specified table format.  Note that
        ``InconsistentTableError`` inherits from ``ValueError`` so no user code
        changes are required. [#7425]
    > astropy.io.fits
      * The ``fits.table_to_hdu()`` function will translate any column ``format``
        attributes to a TDISPn format string, if possible, and store it as a TDISPn
        keyword in the ``HDU`` header. [#7226]
    > astropy.modeling
      * Change the order of the return values from ``FittingWithOutlierRemoval``,
        such that ``fitted_model`` comes first, for consistency with other fitters.
        For the second value, return only a boolean outlier ``mask``, instead of the
        previous ``MaskedArray`` (which included a copy of the input data that was
        both redundant and inadvertently corrupted at masked points). Return a
        consistent type for the second value when ``niter=0``. [#7407]
      * Set the minimum value for the ``bolometric_flux`` parameter of the
        ``BlackBody1D`` model to zero. [#7045]
    > astropy.nddata
      * Add two new uncertainty classes, ``astropy.nddata.VarianceUncertainty`` and
        ``astropy.nddata.InverseVariance``. [#6971]
    > astropy.stats
      * String values can now be used for the ``cenfunc`` and ``stdfunc``
        keywords in the ``SigmaClip`` class and ``sigma_clip`` and
        ``sigma_clipped_stats`` functions. [#7478]
      * The ``SigmaClip`` class and ``sigma_clip`` and
        ``sigma_clipped_stats`` functions now have a ``masked`` keyword,
        which can be used to return either a masked array (default) or an
        ndarray with the min/max values. [#7478]
      * The ``iters`` keyword has been renamed (and deprecated) to
        ``maxiters`` in the ``SigmaClip`` class and ``sigma_clip`` and
        ``sigma_clipped_stats`` functions. [#7478]
    > astropy.table
      * ``Table.read()`` on a FITS binary table file will convert any TDISPn header
        keywords to a Python formatting string when possible, and store it in the
        column ``format`` attribute. [#7226]
      * No values provided to stack will now raise ``ValueError`` rather than
        ``TypeError``. [#7674]
    > astropy.tests
      * ``from astropy.tests.helper import *`` no longer includes
        ``quantity_allclose``. However,
        ``from astropy.tests.helper import quantity_allclose`` would still work.
        [#7381]
      * ``warnings_to_ignore_by_pyver`` option in
        ``enable_deprecations_as_exceptions()`` now takes ``None`` as key.
        Any deprecation message that is mapped to ``None`` will be ignored
        regardless of the Python version. [#7790]
    > astropy.time
      * Added the ability to use ``local`` as time scale in ``Time`` and
        ``TimeDelta``. [#6487]
      * Comparisons, addition, and subtraction of ``Time`` instances with non-time
        instances will now return ``NotImplemented`` rather than raise the
        ``Time``-specific ``OperandTypeError``.  This will generally lead to a
        regular ``TypeError``.  As a result, ``OperandTypeError`` now only occurs if
        the operation is between ``Time`` instances of incompatible type or scale.
        [#7584]
    > astropy.units
      * In ``UnitBase.compose()``, if a sequence (list|tuple) is passed in to
        ``units``, the default for ``include_prefix_units`` is set to
        `True`, so that no units get ignored. [#6957]
      * Negative parallaxes are now converted to NaN values when using the
        ``parallax`` equivalency. [#7988]
    > astropy.utils
      * ``InheritDocstrings`` now also works on class properties. [#7166]
      * ``diff_values()``, ``report_diff_values()``, and ``where_not_allclose()``
        utility functions are moved from ``astropy.io.fits.diff``. [#7444]
      * ``invalidate_caches()`` has been removed from the
        ``astropy.utils.compat`` namespace, use it directly from ``importlib``. [#7872]
    > astropy.visualization
      * In ``ImageNormalize``, the default for ``clip`` is set to ``True``. [#7800]
      * Changed ``AsymmetricPercentileInterval`` and ``MinMaxInterval`` to
        ignore NaN values in arrays. [#7360]
      * Automatically default to using ``grid_type='contours'`` in WCSAxes when using
        a custom ``Transform`` object if the transform has no inverse. [#7847]
  + Performance Improvements
      * Reduced import time by more cautious use of the standard library. [#7647]
    > astropy.convolution
      * Major performance overhaul to ``convolve()``. [#7293]
      * ``convolve()``: Boundaries ``fill``, ``extend``, and ``wrap`` now use a single
        implementation that pads the image with the correct boundary values before convolving.
        The runtimes of these three were significantly skewed. They now have
        equivalent runtimes that are also faster than before due to performant contiguous
        memory access. However, this does increase the memory footprint as an entire
        new image array is required plus that needed for the padded region.[#7293]
      * ``convolve()``: Core computation ported from Cython to C. Several optimization
        techniques have been implemented to achieve performance gains, e.g. compiler
        hoisting, and vectorization, etc. Compiler optimization level ``-O2`` required for
        hoisting and ``-O3`` for vectorization. [#7293]
      * ``convolve()``: ``nan_treatment=‘interpolate’`` was slow to compute irrespective of
        whether any NaN values exist within the array. The input array is now
        checked for NaN values and interpolation is disabled if non are found. This is a
        significant performance boost for arrays without NaN values. [#7293]
    > astropy.coordinates
      * Sped up creating SkyCoord objects by a factor of ~2 in some cases. [#7615]
      * Sped up getting xyz vectors from ``CartesianRepresentation`` (which
        is used a lot internally). [#7638]
      * Sped up transformations and some representation methods by replacing
        python code with (compiled) ``erfa`` ufuncs. [#7639]
      * Sped up adding differential (velocity) data to representations by a factor of
        ~20, which improves the speed of frame and SkyCoord initialization. [#7924]
      * Refactored ``SkyCoord`` initializer to improve performance and code clarity.
        [#7958]
      * Sped up initialization of ``Longitude`` by ~40%. [#7616]
    > astropy.stats
      * The ``SigmaClip`` class and ``sigma_clip`` and
        ``sigma_clipped_stats`` functions are now significantly faster. [#7478]
      * A Cython implementation for `astropy.stats.kuiper_two` and a vectorized
        implementation for `astropy.stats.kuiper_false_positive_probability` have
        been added, speeding up both functions.  [#8104]
    > astropy.units
      * Sped up creating new composite units, and raising units to some power
        [#7549, #7649]
      * Sped up Unit.to when target unit is the same as the original unit.
        [#7643]
      * Lazy-load ``scipy.special`` to shorten ``astropy.units`` import time. [#7636]
    > astropy.visualization
      * Significantly sped up drawing of contours in WCSAxes. [#7568]
  + Bug Fixes
    > astropy.convolution
      * Fixed bug in ``convolve_fft`` where masked input was copied with
        ``numpy.asarray`` instead of ``numpy.asanyarray``.
        ``numpy.asarray`` removes the mask subclass causing
        ``numpy.ma.ismasked(input)`` to fail, causing ``convolve_fft``
        to ignore all masked input. [#8137]
      * Remove function side-effects of input data from ``convolve_fft``.
        It was possible for input data to remain modified if particular exceptions
        were raised. [#8152]
    > astropy.coordinates
      * ``EarthLocation.of_address`` now uses the OpenStreetMap geocoding API by
        default to retrieve coordinates, with the Google API (which now requires an
        API key) as an option. [#7918]
      * Fixed a bug that caused frame objects with NaN distances to have NaN sky
        positions, even if valid sky coordinates were specified. [#7988]
      * Fixed ``represent_as()`` to not round-trip through cartesian if the same
        representation class as the instance is passed in. [#7988]
    > astropy.io.ascii
      * Fixed a problem when ``guess=True`` that ``fast_reader`` options
        could be dropped after the first fast reader class was tried. [#5578]
      * Units in CDS-formatted tables are now parsed correctly by the units
        module. [#7348]
    > astropy.io.misc
      * Fixed bug when writing a table with masked columns to HDF5. Previously
        the mask was being silently dropped.  If the ``serialize_meta`` option is
        enabled the data mask will now be written as an additional column and the
        masked columns will round-trip correctly. [#7481]
      * Fixed a bug where writing to HDF5 failed for for tables with columns of
        unicode strings.  Now those columns are first encoded to UTF-8 and
        written as byte strings. [#7024, #8017]
      * Fixed a bug with serializing the bounding_box of models initialized
        with ``Quantities`` . [#8052]
    > astropy.io.fits
      * Added support for ``copy.copy`` and ``copy.deepcopy`` for ``HDUList``. [#7218]
      * Override ``HDUList.copy()`` to return a shallow HDUList instance. [#7218]
    > astropy.modeling
      * Fix behaviour of certain models with units, by making certain unit-related
        attributes readonly. [#7210]
      * Fixed an issue with validating a ``bounding_box`` whose items are
        ``Quantities``. [#8052]
      * Fix ``Moffat1D`` and ``Moffat2D`` derivatives. [#8108]
    > astropy.nddata
      * Fixed rounding behavior in ``overlap_slices`` for even-sized small
        arrays. [#7859]
      * Added support for pickling ``NDData`` instances that have an uncertainty.
        [#7383]
    > astropy.stats
      * Fix errors in ``kuiper_false_positive_probability``. [#7975]
    > astropy.tests
      * Fixing bug that prevented to run the doctests on only a single rst documentation
        file rather than all of them. [#8055]
    > astropy.time
      * Fix a bug when setting a ``TimeDelta`` array item with plain float value(s).
        This was always interpreted as a JD (day) value regardless of the
        ``TimeDelta`` format. [#7990]
    > astropy.units
      * To simplify fast creation of ``Quantity`` instances from arrays, one can now
        write ``array << unit`` (equivalent to ``Quantity(array, unit, copy=False)``).
        If ``array`` is already a ``Quantity``, this will convert the quantity to the
        requested units; in-place conversion can be done with ``quantity <<= unit``.
        [#7734]
    > astropy.utils
      * Fixed a bug due to which ``report_diff_values()`` was reporting incorrect
        number of differences when comparing two ``numpy.ndarray``. [#7470]
      * The download progress bar is now only displayed in terminals, to avoid
        polluting piped output. [#7577]
      * Ignore URL mirror caching when there is no internet. [#8163]
    > astropy.visualization
      * Right ascension coordinates are now shown in hours by default, and the
        ``set_format_unit`` method on ``CoordinateHelper`` now works correctly
        with angle coordinates. [#7215]
  + Other Changes and Additions
      * The documentation build now uses the Sphinx configuration from sphinx-astropy
        rather than from astropy-helpers. [#7139]
      * Versions of Numpy <1.13 are no longer supported. [#7058]
      * Running tests now suppresses the output of the installation stage by default,
        to allow easier viewing of the test results. To re-enable the output as
        before, use ``python setup.py test --verbose-install``. [#7512]
      * The ERFA functions are now wrapped in ufuncs instead of custom C code,
        leading to some speed improvements, and setting the stage for allowing
        overrides with ``__array_ufunc__``. [#7502]
      * Updated the bundled CFITSIO library to 3.450. See
        ``cextern/cfitsio/docs/changes.txt`` for additional information. [#8014]
      * The ``representation`` keywords in coordinate frames are now deprecated in
        favor of the ``representation_type`` keywords (which are less
        ambiguously named). [#8119]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  5 09:01:00 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to astropy 2.0.3
  * Bugfixes:
    * astropy.coordinates
      - Ecliptic frame classes now support attributes v_x, v_y, v_z when using
        with a Cartesian representation.
      - Added a nicer error message when accidentally calling
        frame.representation instead of frame.data in the context of methods
        that use ._apply().
      - Creating a new SkyCoord from a list of multiple SkyCoord objects now
        yield the correct type of frame, and works at all for non-equatorial
        frames.
      - Improved accuracy of velocity calculation in
        EarthLocation.get_gcrs_posvel.
      - Improved accuracy of radial velocity corrections in
        SkyCoord.radial_velocity_correction`.
      - The precision of ecliptic frames is now much better, after removing the
        nutation from the rotation and fixing the computation of the position
        of the Sun.
    * astropy.extern
      - Version 0.2.1 of pytest-astropy is included as an external package.
    * astropy.io.fits
      - Fix writing the result of fitsdiff to file with --output-file.
      - Fix a minor bug where FITS_rec instances can not be indexed with tuples
        and other sequences that end up with a scalar.
    * astropy.io.misc
      - Fix ImportError when hdf5 is imported first in a fresh Python
        interpreter in Python 3.
    * astropy.nddata
      - Suppress errors during WCS creation in CCDData.read().
      - Fixed a problem with CCDData.read when the extension wasn't given and
        the primary HDU contained no data but another HDU did. In that case the
        header were not correctly combined.
    * astropy.stats
      - Fixed an issue where the biweight statistics functions would sometimes
        cause runtime underflow/overflow errors for float32 input arrays.
    * astropy.table
      - Fixed a problem when printing a table when a column is deleted and
        garbage-collected, and the format function caching mechanism happens to
        re-use the same cache key.
      - Fixed a problem when comparing a unicode masked column (on left side)
        to a bytes masked column (on right side).
      - Fixed a problem in comparing masked columns in bytes and unicode when
        the unicode had masked entries.
    * astropy.tests
      - Fixed a bug that causes tests for rst files to not be run on certain
        platforms.
      - Fixed a bug that caused the doctestplus plugin to not work nicely with
        the hypothesis package.
      - Fixed a bug that meant that the data.astropy.org mirror could not be
        used when using --remote-data=astropy.
      - Support compatibility with new pytest-astropy plugins.
      - When testing, astropy (or the package being tested) is now installed to
        a temporary directory instead of copying the build. This allows entry
        points to work correctly.
    * astropy.time
      - Initialization of Time instances now is consistent for all formats to
        ensure that -0.5 <= jd2 < 0.5.
    * astropy.units
      - Ensure that Quantity slices can be set with objects that have a unit
        attribute (such as Column).
    * astropy.utils
      - download_files_in_parallel now respects the given timeout value.
      - Fixed bugs in remote data handling and also in IERS unit test related
        to path URL, and URI normalization on Windows.
      - Fixed a bug that caused get_pkg_data_fileobj to not work correctly when
        used with non-local data from inside packages.
      - Make sure get_pkg_data_fileobj fails if the URL can not be read, and
        correctly falls back on the mirror if necessary.
      - Fix the finddiff option in find_current_module to properly deal with
        submodules.
      - Fixed pyreadline import in utils.console.isatty for older IPython
        versions on Windows.
    * astropy.visualization
      - Fixed the vertical orientation of the fits2bitmap output bitmap image
        to match that of the FITS image.
      - Added a workaround for a bug in matplotlib so that the fits2bitmap
        script generates the correct output file type.
  * Other Changes and Additions
    * No longer require LaTeX to build the documentation locally and use
      mathjax instead.
    * Fixed broken links in the documentation.
    * Ensured that all tests use the Astropy data mirror if needed.

- update to version 1.1.1
  + New Features
    - ``astropy.io.registry``
      * Allow ``pathlib.Path`` objects (available in Python 3.4 and later) for
        specifying the file name in registry read / write functions. [#4405]
    - ``astropy.utils``
      * ``console.human_file_size`` now accepts quantities with byte-equivalent
        units [#4373]
  + Bug Fixes
    - ``astropy.analytic_functions``
      * Fixed the blackbody functions' handling of overflows on some platforms
        (Windows with MSVC, older Linux versions) with a buggy ``expm1`` function.
        [#4393]
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      * Fixed an bug where updates to string columns in FITS tables were not saved
        on Python 3. [#4452]
  + Other Changes and Additions
    - Updated bundled astropy-helpers to v1.1.1. [#4413]
- update to version 1.1
  + New Features
    - ``astropy.config``
      - Added new tools ``set_temp_config`` and ``set_temp_cache`` which can be
        used either as function decorators or context managers to temporarily
        use alternative directories in which to read/write the Astropy config
        files and download caches respectively.  This is especially useful for
        testing, though ``set_temp_cache`` may also be used as a way to provide
        an alternative (application specific) download cache for large data files,
        rather than relying on the default cache location in users' home
        directories. [#3975]
    - ``astropy.constants``
      - Added the Thomson scattering cross-section. [#3839]
    - ``astropy.convolution``
      - Added Moffat2DKernel. [#3965]
    - ``astropy.coordinates``
      - Added ``get_constellation`` function and ``SkyCoord.get_constellation``
        convenience method to determine the constellation that a coordinate
        is in. [#3758]
      - Added ``PrecessedGeocentric`` frame, which is based on GCRS, but precessed
        to a specific requested mean equinox. [#3758]
      - Added ``Supergalactic`` frame to support de Vaucouleurs supergalactic
        coordinates. [#3892]
      - ``SphericalRepresentation`` now has a ``._unit_representation`` class attribute to specify
        an equivalent UnitSphericalRepresentation. This allows subclasses of
        representations to pair up correctly. [#3757]
      - Added functionality to support getting the locations of observatories by
        name. See ``astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation.of_site``. [#4042]
      - Added ecliptic coordinates, including ``GeocentricTrueEcliptic``,
        ``BarycentricTrueEcliptic``, and ``HeliocentricTrueEcliptic``. [#3749]
    - ``astropy.cosmology``
      - Add Planck 2015 cosmology [#3476]
      - Distance calculations now > 20-40x faster for the supplied
        cosmologies due to implementing Cython scalar versions of
        ``FLRW.inv_efunc``.[#4127]
    - ``astropy.io.ascii``
      - Automatically use ``guess=False`` when reading if the file ``format`` is
        provided and the format parameters are uniquely specified.  This update
        also removes duplicate format guesses to improve performance. [#3418]
      - Calls to ascii.read() for fixed-width tables may now omit one of the keyword
        arguments ``col_starts`` or ``col_ends``. Columns will be assumed to begin and
        end immediately adjacent to each other. [#3657]
      - Add a function ``get_read_trace()`` that returns a traceback of the
        attempted read formats for the last call to ``astropy.io.ascii.read``. [#3688]
      - Supports LZMA decompression via ``get_readable_fileobj`` [#3667]
      - Allow ``-`` character is Sextractor format column names. [#4168]
      - Improve DAOphot reader to read multi-aperture files [#3535, #4207]
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      - Support reading and writing from bzip2 compressed files. i.e. ``.fits.bz2``
        files. [#3789]
      - Included a new command-line script called ``fitsinfo`` to display
        a summary of the HDUs in one or more FITS files. [#3677]
    - ``astropy.io.misc``
      - Support saving all meta information, description and units of tables and columns
        in HDF5 files [#4103]
    - ``astropy.io.votable``
      - A new method was added to ``astropy.io.votable.VOTable``,
        ``get_info_by_id`` to conveniently find an ``INFO`` element by its
        ``ID`` attribute. [#3633]
      - Instances in the votable tree now have better ``__repr__``
        methods. [#3639]
    - ``astropy.logger.py``
      - Added log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, CRITICAL) to ``astropy.log`` [#3947]
    - ``astropy.modeling``
      - Added a new ``Parameter.validator`` interface for setting a validation
        method on individual model parameters.  See the ``Parameter``
        documentation for more details. [#3910]
      - The projection classes that are named based on the 3-letter FITS
        WCS projections (e.g. ``Pix2Sky_TAN``) now have aliases using
        longer, more descriptive names (e.g. ``Pix2Sky_Gnomonic``).
        [#3583]
      - All of the standard FITS WCS projection types have been
        implemented in ``astropy.modeling.projections`` (by wrapping
        WCSLIB). [#3906]
      - Added ``Sersic1D`` and ``Sersic2D`` model classes. [#3889]
      - Added the Voigt profile to existing models. [#3901]
      - Added ``bounding_box`` property and ``render_model`` function [#3909]
    - ``astropy.nddata``
      - Added ``block_reduce`` and ``block_replicate`` functions. [#3453]
      - ``extract_array`` now offers different options to deal with array
        boundaries [#3727]
      - Added a new ``Cutout2D`` class to create postage stamp image cutouts
        with optional WCS propagation. [#3823]
    - ``astropy.stats``
      - Added ``sigma_lower`` and ``sigma_upper`` keywords to
        ``sigma_clip`` to allow for unsymmetric clipping. [#3595]
      - Added ``cenfunc``, ``stdfunc``, and ``axis`` keywords to
        ``sigma_clipped_stats``. [#3792]
      - ``sigma_clip`` automatically masks invalid input values (NaNs, Infs) before
        performing the clipping [#4051]
      - Added the ``histogram`` routine, which is similar to ``np.histogram`` but
        includes several additional options for automatic determination of optimal
        histogram bins. Associated helper routines include ``bayesian_blocks``,
        ``friedman_bin_width``, ``scott_bin_width``, and ``knuth_bin_width``.
        This functionality was ported from the astroML_ library. [#3756]
      - Added the ``bayesian_blocks`` routine, which implements a dynamic algorithm
        for locating change-points in various time series. [#3756]
      - A new function ``poisson_conf_interval()`` was added to allow easy calculation
        of several standard formulae for the error bars on the mean of a Poisson variable
        estimated from a single sample.
    - ``astropy.table``
      - ``add_column()`` and ``add_columns()`` now have ``rename_duplicate``
        option to rename new column(s) rather than raise exception when its name
        already exists. [#3592]
      - Added ``Table.to_pandas`` and ``Table.from_pandas`` for converting to/from
        pandas dataframes. [#3504]
      - Initializing a ``Table`` with ``Column`` objects no longer requires
        that the column ``name`` attribute be defined. [#3781]
      - Added an ``info`` property to ``Table`` objects which provides configurable
        summary information about the table and its columns. [#3731]
      - Added an ``info`` property to column classes (``Column`` or mixins).  This
        serves a dual function of providing configurable summary information about
        the column, and acting as a manager of column attributes such as
        name, format, or description. [#3731]
      - Updated table and column representation to use the ``dtype_info_name``
        function for the dtype value.  Removed the default "masked=False"
        from the table representation. [#3868, #3869]
      - Updated row representation to be consistent with the corresponding
        table representation for that row.  Added HTML representation so a
        row displays nicely in IPython notebook.
      - Added a new table indexing engine allowing for the creation of
        indices on one or more columns of a table using ``add_index``. These
        indices enable new functionality such as searching for rows by value
        using ``loc`` and ``iloc``, as well as increased performance for
        certain operations. [#3915]
      - Added capability to include a structured array or recarray in a table
        as a mixin column.  This allows for an approximation of nested tables.
        [#3925]
      - Added ``keep_byteorder`` option to ``Table.as_array()``.  See the
        "API Changes" section below. [#4080]
      - Added a new method ``Table.replace_column()`` to replace an existing
        column with a new data column. [#4090]
      - Added a ``tableclass`` option to ``Table.pformat()`` to allow specifying
        a list of CSS classes added to the HTML table. [#4131]
      - New CSS for jsviewer table [#2917, #2982, #4174]
      - Added a new ``Table.show_in_notebook`` method that shows an interactive view
        of a Table (similar to ``Table.show_in_browser(jsviewer=True)``) in an
        Python/Jupyter notebook. [#4197]
    - ``astropy.tests``
      - Added new test config options, ``config_dir`` and ``cache_dir``  (these
        can be edited in ``setup.cfg`` or as extra command-line options to
        py.test) for setting the locations to use for the Astropy config files
        and download caches (see also the related ``set_temp_config/cache``
        features added in ``astropy.config``). [#3975]
    - ``astropy.time``
      - Add support for FITS standard time strings. [#3547]
      - Allow the ``format`` attribute to be updated in place to change the
        default representation of a ``Time`` object. [#3673]
      - Add support for shape manipulation (reshape, ravel, etc.). [#3224]
      - Add argmin, argmax, argsort, min, max, ptp, sort methods. [#3581]
      - Add ``Time.to_datetime`` method for converting ``Time`` objects to
        timezone-aware datetimes. [#4119]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - Added furlong to imperial units. [#3529]
      - Added mil to imperial units. [#3716]
      - Added stone to imperial units. [#4192]
      - Added Earth Mass (``M_earth``) and Jupiter mass (``M_jup``) to units [#3907]
      - Added support for functional units, in particular the logarithmic ones
        ``Magnitude``, ``Decibel``, and ``Dex``. [#1894]
      - Quantities now work with the unit support in matplotlib.  See
        :ref:`plotting-quantities`. [#3981]
    - ``astropy.utils``
      - Added new ``OrderedDescriptor`` and ``OrderedDescriptorContainer`` utility
        classes that make it easier to implement classes with declarative APIs,
        wherein class-level attributes have an inherit "ordering" to them that is
        specified by the order in which those attributes are defined in the class
        declaration (by defining them using special descriptors that have
        ``OrderedDescriptor`` as a base class).  See the API documentation for
        these classes for more details. Coordinate frames and models now use this
        interface. [#3679]
      - The ``get_pkg_data_*`` functions now take an optional ``package`` argument
        which allows specifying any package to read package data filenames or
        content out of, as opposed to only being able to use data from the package
        that the function is called from. [#4079]
      - Added function ``dtype_info_name`` to the ``data_info`` module to provide
        the name of a ``dtype`` for human-readable informational purposes. [#3868]
      - Added ``classproperty`` decorator--this is to ``property`` as
        ``classmethod`` is to normal instance methods. [#3982]
      - ``iers.open`` now handles network URLs, as well as local paths. [#3850]
      - The ``astropy.utils.wraps`` decorator now takes an optional
        ``exclude_args`` argument not shared by the standard library ``wraps``
        decorator (as it is unique to the Astropy version's ability of copying
        the wrapped function's argument signature).  ``exclude_args`` allows
        certain arguments on the wrapped function to be excluded from the signature
        of the wrapper function.  This is particularly useful when wrapping an
        instance method as a function (to exclude the ``self`` argument). [#4017]
      - ``get_readable_fileobj`` can automatically decompress LZMA ('.xz')
        files using the ``lzma`` module of Python 3.3+ or, when available, the
        ``backports.lzma`` package on earlier versions. [#3667]
      - The ``resolve_name`` utility now accepts any number of additional
        positional arguments that are automatically dotted together with the
        first ``name`` argument. [#4083]
      - Added ``is_url_in_cache`` for resolving paths to cached files via URLS
        and checking if files exist. [#4095]
      - Added a ``step`` argument to the ``ProgressBar.map`` method to give
        users control over the update frequency of the progress bar. [#4191]
    - ``astropy.visualization``
      - Added a function / context manager ``quantity_support`` for enabling
        seamless ploting of ``Quantity`` instances in matplotlib. [#3981]
      - Added the ``hist`` function, which is similar to ``plt.hist`` but
        includes several additional options for automatic determination of optimal
        histogram bins. This functionality was ported from the astroML_ library.
        [#3756]
    - ``astropy.wcs``
      - The included version of wcslib has been upgraded to 5.10. [#4239]
        The minimum required version of wcslib in the 4.x series remains 4.24.
        The minimum required version of wcslib in the 5.x series is
        5.8.  Building astropy against a wcslib 5.x prior to 5.8
        will raise an ``ImportError`` when ``astropy.wcs`` is imported.
        The wcslib changes relevant to astropy are:
        - The FITS headers returned by ``astropy.wcs.WCS.to_header`` and
          ``astropy.wcs.WCS.to_header_string`` now include values with
          more precision.  This will result in numerical differences in
          your results if you convert ``astropy.wcs.WCS`` objects to FITS
          headers and use the results.
        - ``astropy.wcs.WCS`` now recognises the ``TPV``, ``TPD``,
          ``TPU``, ``DSS``, ``TNX`` and ``ZPX`` polynomial distortions.
        - Added relaxation flags to allow ``PC0i_0ja``, ``PV0j_0ma``, and
          ``PS0j_0ma`` (i.e. with leading zeroes on the index).
        - Tidied up error reporting, particularly relating to translating
          status returns from lower-level functions.
        - Changed output formatting of floating point values in
          ``to_header``.
      - Enhanced text representation of ``WCS`` objects. [#3604]
    - The ``astropy.tests.helper`` module is now part of the public API (and has a
      documentation page).  This module was in previous releases of astropy,
      but was not considered part of the public API until now. [#3890]
    - There is a new function ``astropy.online_help`` to search the
      astropy documentation and display the result in a web
      browser. [#3642]
  + API changes
    - ``astropy.cosmology``
      - ``FLRW._tfunc`` and ``FLRW._xfunc`` are marked as deprecated.  Users
        should use the new public interfaces ``FLRW.lookback_time_integrand``
        and ``FLRW.abs_distance_integrand`` instead. [#3767]
    - ``astropy.io.ascii``
      - The default header line processing was made to be consistent with data line
        processing in that it now ignores blank lines that may have whitespace
        characters.  Any code that explicitly specifies a ``header_start`` value
        for parsing a file with blank lines in the header containing whitespace will
        need to be updated. [#2654]
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      - The ``uint`` argument to ``fits.open`` is now True by default; that is,
        arrays using the FITS unsigned integer convention will be detected, and
        read as unsigned integers by default.  A new config option for
        ``io.fits``, ``enable_uint``, can be changed to False to revert to the
        original behavior of ignoring the ``uint`` convention unless it is
        explicitly requested with ``uint=True``. [#3916]
      - The ``ImageHDU.NumCode`` and ``ImageHDU.ImgCode`` attributes (and same
        for other classes derived from ``_ImageBaseHDU``) are deprecated.  Instead,
        the ``astropy.io.fits`` module-level constants ``BITPIX2DTYPE`` and
        ``DTYPE2BITPIX`` can be used. [#3916]
    - ``astropy.modeling``
      - Note: Comparisons of model parameters with array-like values now
        yields a Numpy boolean array as one would get with normal Numpy
        array comparison.  Previously this returned a scalar True or False,
        with True only if the comparison was true for all elements compared,
        which could lead to confusing circumstances. [#3912]
      - Using ``model.inverse = None`` to reset a model's inverse to its
        default is deprecated.  In the future this syntax will explicitly make
        a model not have an inverse (even if it has a default).  Instead, use
        ``del model.inverse`` to reset a model's inverse to its default (if it
        has a default, otherwise this just deletes any custom inverse that has
        been assigned to the model and is still equivalent to setting
        ``model.inverse = None``). [#4236]
      - Adds a ``model.has_user_inverse`` attribute which indicates whether or not
        a user has assigned a custom inverse to ``model.inverse``.  This is just
        for informational purposes, for example, for software that introspects
        model objects. [#4236]
      - Renamed the parameters of ``RotateNative2Celestial`` and
        ``RotateCelestial2Native`` from ``phi``, ``theta``, ``psi`` to
        ``lon``, ``lat`` and ``lon_pole``. [#3578]
      - Deprecated the ``Pix2Sky_AZP.check_mu`` and ``Sky2Pix_AZP.check_mu``
        methods (these were obscure "accidentally public" methods that were
        probably not used by anyone). [#3910]
      - Added a phase parameter to the Sine1D model. [#3807]
    - ``astropy.stats``
      - Renamed the ``sigma_clip`` ``sig`` keyword as ``sigma``. [#3595]
      - Changed the ``sigma_clip`` ``varfunc`` keyword to ``stdfunc``. [#3595]
      - Renamed the ``sigma_clipped_stats`` ``mask_val`` keyword to
        ``mask_value``. [#3595]
      - Changed the default ``iters`` keyword value to 5 in both the
        ``sigma_clip`` and ``sigma_clipped_stats`` functions. [#4067]
    - ``astropy.table``
      - ``Table.as_array()`` always returns a structured array with each column in
        the system's native byte order.  The optional ``keep_byteorder=True``
        option will keep each column's data in its original byteorder. [#4080]
      - ``Table.simple_table()`` now creates tables with int64 and float64 types
        instead of int32 and float64. [#4114]
    - ``astropy.time``
      - The ``astropy_time`` attribute and time format has been removed from the
        public interface.  Existing code that instantiates a new time object using
        ``format='astropy_time'`` can simply omit the ``format``
        specification. [#3857]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - Single-item ``Quantity`` instances with record ``dtype`` will now have
        their ``isscalar`` property return ``True``, consistent with behaviour for
        numpy arrays, where ``np.void`` records are considered scalar. [#3899]
      - Three changes relating to the FITS unit format [#3993]:
        - The FITS unit format will no longer parse an arbitrary number as a
          scale value.  It must be a power of 10 of the form ``10^^k``,
          ``10^k``, ``10+k``, ``10-k`` and ``10(k)``. [#3993]
        - Scales that are powers of 10 can be written out.  Previously, any
          non-1.0 scale was rejected.
        - The ``*`` character is accepted as a separator between the scale
          and the units.
      - Unit formatter classes now require the ``parse`` and ``to_string``
        methods are now required to be classmethods (and the formatter
        classes themselves are assumed to be singletons that are not
        instantiated).  As unit formatters are mostly an internal implementation
        detail this is not likely to affect any users. [#4001]
      - CGS E&M units are now defined separately from SI E&M units, and have
        distinct physical types. [#4255]
    - ``astropy.utils``
      - All of the ``get_pkg_data_*`` functions take an optional ``package``
        argument as their second positional argument.  So any code that previously
        passed other arguments to these functions as positional arguments might
        break.  Use keyword argument passing instead to mitigate this. [#4079]
      - ``astropy.utils.iers`` now uses a ``QTable`` internally, which means that
        the numerical columns are stored as ``Quantity``, with full support for
        units.  Furthermore, the ``ut1_utc`` method now returns a ``Quantity``
        instead of a float or an array (as did ``pm_xy`` already). [#3223]
      -  ``astropy.utils.iers`` now throws an ``IERSRangeError``, a subclass
         of ``IndexError``, rather than a raw ``IndexError``.  This allows more
         fine-grained catching of situations where a ``Time`` is beyond the range
         of the loaded IERS tables. [#4302]
    - ``astropy.wcs``
      - When compiled with wcslib 5.9 or later, the FITS headers returned
        by ``astropy.wcs.WCS.to_header`` and
        ``astropy.wcs.WCS.to_header_string`` now include values with more
        precision.  This will result in numerical differences in your
        results if you convert ``astropy.wcs.WCS`` objects to FITS headers
        and use the results.
      - If NAXIS1 or NAXIS2 is not passed with the header object to
        WCS.calc_footprint, a ValueError is raised. [#3557]
  + Bug fixes
    - ``astropy.constants``
      - The constants ``Ry`` and ``u`` are now properly used inside the
        corresponding units.  The latter have changed slightly as a result. [#4229]
    - ``astropy.coordinates``
      - Internally, ``coordinates`` now consistently uses the appropriate time
        scales for using ERFA functions. [#4302]
    - ``astropy.io.ascii``
      - Fix a segfault in the fast C parser when one of the column headers
        is empty [#3545].
      - Fix several bugs that prevented the fast readers from being used
        when guessing the file format.  Also improved the read trace
        information to better understand format guessing. [#4115]
      - Fix an underlying problem that resulted in an uncaught TypeError
        exception when reading a CDS-format file with guessing enabled. [#4120]
    - ``astropy.modeling``
      - ``Simplex`` fitter now correctly passes additional keywords arguments to
        the scipy solver. [#3966]
      - The keyword ``acc`` (for accuracy) is now correctly accepted by
        ``Simplex``. [#3966]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - The units ``Ryd`` and ``u`` are no longer hard-coded numbers, but depend
        on the appropriate values in the ``constants`` module.  As a result, these
        units now imply slightly different conversions.  [#4229]
  + Other Changes and Additions
    - The ``./setup.py test`` command is now implemented in the ``astropy.tests``
      module again (previously its implementation had been moved into
      astropy-helpers).  However, that made it difficult to synchronize changes
      to the Astropy test runner with changes to the ``./setup.py test`` UI.
      astropy-helpers v1.1 and above will detect this implementation of the
      ``test`` command, when present, and use it instead of the old version that
      was included in astropy-helpers (most users will not notice any difference
      as a result of this change). [#4020]
    - The repr for ``Table`` no longer displays ``masked=False`` since tables
      are not masked by default anyway. [#3869]
    - The version of ``PLY`` that ships with astropy has been updated to 3.6.
    - WCSAxes is now required for doc builds. [#4074]
    - Updated ``astropy.tests`` test runner code to work with Coverage v4.0 when
      generating test coverage reports. [#4176]
    - The migration guide from pre-v0.4 coordinates has been removed to avoid
      cluttering the ``astropy.coordinates`` documentation with increasingly
      irrelevant material.  To see the migration guide, we recommend you simply look
      to the archived documentation for previous versions, e.g.
      http://docs.astropy.org/en/v1.0/coordinates/index.html#migrating-from-pre-v0-4-coordinates
      [#4203]
    - In ``astropy.coordinates``, the transformations between GCRS, CIRS,
      and ITRS have been adjusted to more logically reflect the order in
      which they actually apply.  This should not affect most coordinate
      transformations, but may affect code that is especially sensitive to
      machine precision effects that change when the order in which
      transformations occur is changed. [#4255]
- update to version 1.0.8 (2016-01-08)
  + Bug Fixes
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      - Fixed an bug where updates to string columns in FITS tables were not saved
        on Python 3. [#4452]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - In-place peak-to-peak calculations now work on ``Quantity``. [#4442]
    - ``astropy.utils``
      - Fixed ``find_api_page`` to work correctly on python 3.x [#4378]
- update to version 1.0.7:
  * New Features
    + astropy.time
      Fix incorrect value attribute for epoch formats like "unix" when
      scale is different from the class epoch_scale. [#4313]
  * Bug Fixes
    + astropy.coordinates
       Pickling of EarthLocation instances now also works on Python
      2. [#4304]
    + astropy.io.fits
      o Fixed a regression that could cause writes of large FITS files
        to be truncated. [#4307]
      o Astropy v1.0.6 included a fix (#4228) for an obscure case where
        the TDIM of a table column is smaller than the repeat count of
        its data format. This updates that fix in such a way that it
        works with Numpy 1.10 as well. [#4266]
      o Fix fast writer so bytestring column output is not prefixed by
        'b' in Python 3. [#4350]
    + astropy.table
      o Fix a bug when pickling a Table with mixin columns
        (e.g. Time). [#4098]
    + astropy.utils
      o Fixed an issue where if ipython is installed but ipykernel is
        not installed then importing astropy from the ipython console
        gave an IPython.kernel deprecation warning. [#4279]
      o Fixed crash that could occur in ProgressBar when astropy is
        imported in an IPython startup script. [#4274]
- update to version 1.0.6:
  * astropy.analytic_functions
    + Fixed blackbody analytic functions to properly support arrays of
      temperatures. [#4251]
  * astropy.coordinates
    + Fixed errors in transformations for objects within a few AU of
      the Earth. Included substansive changes to transformation
      machinery that may change distances at levels ~machine precision
      for other objects. [#4254]
  * astropy.io.fits
    + fitsdiff and related functions now do a better job reporting
      differences between values that are different types but have the
      same representation (ex: the string '0' versus the number
      0). [#4122]
    + Miscellaneous fixes for supporting Numpy 1.10. [#4228]
    + Fixed an issue where writing a column of unicode strings to a
      FITS table resulted in a quadrupling of size of the column
      (i.e. the format of the FITS column was 4 characters for every
      one in the original strings). [#4228]
    + Added support for an obscure case (but nonetheless allowed by the
      FITS standard) where a column has some TDIMn keyword, but a
      repeat count in the TFORMn column greater than the number of
      elements implied by the TDIMn. For example TFORMn = 100I, but
      TDIMn = '(5,5)'. In this case the TDIMn implies 5x5 arrays in the
      column, but the TFORMn implies a 100 element 1-D array in the
      column. In this case the TDIM takes precedence, and the remaining
      bytes in the column are ignored. [#4228]
  * astropy.io.votable
    + Fixed crash with Python compiler optimization level = 2. [#4231]
  * astropy.vo
    + Fixed check_conesearch_sites with parallel=True on Python >= 3.3
      and on Windows (it was broken in both those cases for separate
      reasons). [#2970]
  * All tests now pass against Numpy v1.10.x. This implies nominal
    support for Numpy 1.10.x moving forward (but there may still be
    unknown issues). For example, there is already a known performance
    issue with tables containing large multi-dimensional columns--for
    example, tables that contain entire images in one or more of their
    columns. This is a known upstream issue in Numpy. [#4259]
- Update to 1.0.5
  + Bug Fixes
    * ``astropy.constants``
      > Rename units -> unit and error -> uncertainty in the ``repr`` and ``str``
        of constants to match attribute names. [#4147]
    * ``astropy.coordinates``
      > Fix string representation of ``SkyCoord`` objects transformed into
        the ``AltAz`` frame [#4055]

      > Fix the ``search_around_sky`` function to allow ``storekdtree`` to be 
        ``False`` as was intended. [#4082]
    * ``astropy.io.fits``
      > Fix bug when extending one header (without comments) with another
        (with comments). [#3967]
      > Somewhat improved resource usage for FITS data--previously a new ``mmap``
        was opened for each HDU of a FITS file accessed through an ``HDUList``.
        Each ``mmap`` used up a single file descriptor, causing problems with
        system resource limits for some users.  Now only a single ``mmap`` is
        opened, and shared for the data of all HDUs.  Note: The problem still
        persists with using the "convenience" functions.  For example using
        ``fits.getdata`` will create one ``mmap`` per HDU read this way (as
        opposed to opening the file with ``fits.open`` and accessing the HDUs
        through the ``HDUList`` object). [#4097]
      > Fix bug where reading a file without a newline failed with an
        unrelated / unhelpful exception. [#4160]
    * ``astropy.modeling``
      > Cleaned up ``repr`` of models that have no parameters. [#4076]
    * ``astropy.nddata``
      > Initializing ``NDDataArray`` from another instance now sets ``flags`` as
        expected and no longer fails when ``uncertainty`` is set [#4129].
        Initializing an ``NDData`` subclass from a parent instance
        (eg. ``NDDataArray`` from ``NDData``) now sets the attributes other than
        ``data`` as it should [#4137].
    * ``astropy.table``
      > Fix bug when doing outer join on multi-dimensional columns. [#4060]
      > Fix an issue with setting fill value when column dtype is changed. [#4088]
      > Fix bug when unpickling a bare Column where the _parent_table
        attribute was not set.  This impacted the Column representation. [#4099]
      > Fix issue with the web browser opening with an empty page, and ensure that
        the url is correctly formatted for Windows. [#4132]
      > Fix NameError in table stack exception message. [#4213]
    * ``astropy.utils``
      > ``resolve_name`` no longer causes ``sys.modules`` to be cluttered with
        additional copies of modules under a package imported like
        ``resolve_name('numpy')``. [#4084]
      > ``console`` was updated to support IPython 4.x and Jupyter 1.x.
        This should supress a ShimWarning that was appearing at
        import of astropy with IPython 4.0 or later. [#4078]
      > Temporary downloaded files created by ``get_readable_fileobj`` when passed
        a URL are now deleted immediately after the file is closed. [#4198]
    * ``astropy.visualization``
      > The color for axes labels was set to white. Since white labels on white
        background are hard to read, the label color has been changed to black. 
        [#4143]
      > ``ImageNormalize`` now automatically determines ``vmin``/``vmax``
        (via the ``autoscale_None`` method) when they have not been set
        explicitly. [#4117]
    * ``astropy.vo``
      > Cone Search validation no longer crashes when the provider gives an
        incomplete test query. It also ensures search radius for a test query
        is not too large to avoid timeout. [#4158, #4159]
  + Other Changes and Additions
    - Astropy now supports Python 3.5. [#4027]
    - Updated bundled version of astropy-helpers to 1.0.5. [#4215]
    - Updated tests to support py.test 2.7, and upgraded the bundled copy of
      py.test to v2.7.3. [#4027]
- Update to 1.0.4
  + New Features
    * ``astropy.convolution``
      > Modified Cython functions to release the GIL. This enables convolution
        to be parallelized effectively and gives large speedups when used with
        multithreaded task schedulers such as Dask. [#3949]
  + API Changes
    * ``astropy.coordinates``
      > Some transformations for an input coordinate that's a scalar now correctly
        return a scalar.  This was always the intended behavior, but it may break
        code that has been written to work-around this bug, so it may be viewed as
        an unplanned API change [#3920]
    * ``astropy.visualization``
      > The ``astropy_mpl_style`` no longer sets ``interactive`` to ``True``, but
        instead leaves it at the user preference.  This makes using the style
        compatible with building docs with Sphinx, and other non-interactive
        contexts. [#4030]
  + Bug Fixes
    * ``astropy.coordinates``
      > Fix bug where coordinate representation setting gets reset to default value
        when coordinate array is indexed or sliced. [#3824]
      > Fixed confusing warning message shown when using dates outside current IERS
        data. [#3844]
      > ``get_sun`` now yields a scalar when the input time is a scalar (this was a
        regression in v1.0.3 from v1.0.2) [#3998]
      > Fixed bug where some scalar coordinates were incorrectly being changed to
        length-1 array coordinates after transforming through certain frames.
        [#3920]
      > Fixed bug causing the ``separation`` methods of ``SkyCoord`` and frame
        classes to fail due to infinite recursion [#4033]
      > Made it so that passing in a list of ``SkyCoord`` objects that are in
        UnitSphericalRepresentation to the ``SkyCoord`` constructor appropriately
        yields a new object in UnitSphericalRepresentation [#3938]
    * ``astropy.cosmology``
      > Fixed wCDM to not ignore the Ob0 parameter on initialization. [#3934]
    * ``astropy.io.fits``
      > Fixed crash when updating data in a random groups HDU opened in update
        mode. [#3730]
      > Fixed incorrect checksum / datasum being written when re-writing a scaled
        HDU (i.e. non-trivial BSCALE and/or BZERO) with
        ``do_not_scale_image_data=False``. [#3883]
      > Fixed stray deprecation warning in ``BinTableHDU.copy()``. [#3789]
      > Better handling of the ``BLANK`` keyword when auto-scaling scaled image
        data.  The ``BLANK`` keyword is now removed from the header after
        auto-scaling is applied, and it is restored properly (with floating point
        NaNs replaced by the filler value) when updating a file opened with the
        ``scale_back=True`` argument.  Invalid usage of the ``BLANK`` keyword is
        also better warned about during validation. [#3865]
      > Reading memmaped scaled images won't fail when
        ``do_not_scale_image_data=True`` (that is, since we're just reading the raw
        / physical data there is no reason mmap can't be used). [#3766]
      > Fixed a reference cycle that could sometimes cause FITS table-related
        objects (``BinTableHDU``, ``ColDefs``, etc.) to hang around in memory
        longer than expected. [#4012]
    * ``astropy.modeling``
      > Added missing default values for ``Ellipse2D`` parameters. [#3903]
      > Improved support for pickling of compound models, including both compound
        model instances, and new compound model classes. [#3867]
    * ``astropy.table``
      > Added missing default values for ``Ellipse2D`` parameters. [#3903]
    * ``astropy.time``
      > Fixed iteration of scalar ``Time`` objects so that ``iter()`` correctly
        raises a ``TypeError`` on them (while still allowing ``Time`` arrays to be
        iterated). [#4048]
    * ``astropy.units``
      > Added frequency-equivalency check when declaring doppler equivalencies
        [#3728]
      > Define ``floor_divide`` (``//``) for ``Quantity`` to be consistent
        ``divmod``, such that it only works where the quotient is dimensionless.
        This guarantees that ``(q1 // q2) * q2 + (q1 % q2) == q1``. [#3817]
      > Fixed the documentation of supported units to correctly report support for
        SI prefixes.  Previously the table of supported units incorrectly showed
        several derived unit as not supporting prefixes, when in fact they do.
        [#3835]
      > Fix a crash when calling ``astropy.units.cds.enable()``.  This will now
        "set" rather than "add" units to the active set to avoid the namespace
        clash with the default units. [#3873]
      > Ensure in-place operations on ``float32`` quantities work. [#4007]
    * ``astropy.utils``
      > The ``deprecated`` decorator did not correctly wrap classes that have a
        custom metaclass--the metaclass could be dropped from the deprecated
        version of the class. [#3997]
      > The ``wraps`` decorator would copy the wrapped function's name to the
        wrapper function even when ``'__name__'`` is excluded from the ``assigned``
        argument. [#4016]
    * Misc
      > ``fitscheck`` no longer causes scaled image data to be rescaled when 
        adding checksums to existing files. [#3884]
      > Fixed an issue where running ``import astropy`` from within the source
        tree did not automatically build the extension modules if the source is
        from a source distribution (as opposed to a git repository). [#3932]
      > Fixed multiple instances of a bug that prevented Astropy from being used
        when compiled with the ``python -OO`` flag, due to it causing all
        docstrings to be stripped out. [#3923]
      > Removed source code template files that were being installed
        accidentally alongside installed Python modules. [#4014]
      > Fixed a bug in the exception logging that caused a crash in the exception
        handler itself on Python 3 when exceptions do not include a message.
        [#4056]
- update to version 1.0.3:
  * New Features
    + astropy.table
      o Greatly improved the speed of printing a large table to the
        screen when only a few rows are being displayed. [#3796]
    + astropy.time
      o Add support for the 2015-Jun-30 leap second. [#3794]
  * API Changes
    + astropy.io.ascii
      o Note that HTML formatted tables will not always be found with
        guess mode unless it passes certain heuristics that strongly
        suggest the presence of HTML in the input. Code that expects
        to read tables from HTML should specify format='html'
        explicitly. See bug fixes below for more details. [#3693]
  * Bug Fixes
    + astropy.convolution
      o Fix issue with repeated normalizations of Kernels. [#3747]
    + astropy.coordinates
      o Fixed get_sun to yield frames with the obstime set to what's
        passed into the function (previously it incorrectly always had
        J2000). [#3750]
      o Fixed get_sun to account for aberration of light. [#3750]
      o Fixed error in the GCRS->ICRS transformation that gave
        incorrect distances. [#3750]
    + astropy.io.ascii
      o Remove HTML from the list of automatically-guessed formats
        when reading if the file does not appear to be HTML. This was
        necessary to avoid a commonly-encountered segmentation fault
        occurring in the libxml parser on MacOSX. [#3693]
    + astropy.io.fits
      o Fixes to support the upcoming Numpy 1.10. [#3419]

    + astropy.modeling
      o Polynomials are now scaled when used in a compound
        model. [#3702]
      o Fixed the Ellipse2D model to be consistent with Disk2D in how
        pixels are included. [#3736]
      o Fixed crash when evaluating a model that accepts no
        inputs. [#3772]
    + astropy.testing
      o The Astropy py.test plugins that disable unintential internet
        access in tests were also blocking use of local UNIX sockets
        in tests, which prevented testing some multiprocessing
        code--fixed. [#3713]
    + astropy.units
      o Supported full SI prefixes for the barn unit ("picobarn",
        "femtobarn", etc.) [#3753]
      o Fix loss of precision when multiplying non-whole-numbered
        powers of units together. For example, before this change,
        (u.m ** 1.5) ** Fraction(4, 5) resulted in an inaccurate
        floating-point power of 1.2000000000000002. After this change,
        the exact rational number of Fraction(6, 5) is
        maintained. [#3790]
      o Fixed printing of object ndarrays containing multiple Quantity
        objects with differing / incompatible units. Note: Unit
        conversion errors now cause a UnitConversionError exception to
        be raised. However, this is a subclass of the UnitsError
        exception used previously, so existing code that catches
        UnitsError should still work. [#3778]
  * Other Changes and Additions
    - Added a new astropy.__bibtex__ attribute which gives a citation
      for Astropy in bibtex format. [#3697]
    - The bundled version of ERFA was updated to v1.2.0 to address
      leapscond updates. [#3802]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 21 14:08:38 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- update to version 1.0.2:
  * New Features
    + "astropy.modeling"
      o Added support for polynomials with degree 0 or degree greater
        than 15.  [#3574, 3589]
  * Bug Fixes
    + "astropy.config"
      o The pre-astropy-0.4 configuration API has been fixed. It was
        inadvertently broken in 1.0.1. [#3627]
    + "astropy.io.fits"
      o Fixed handling of BINTABLE with TDIMn of size 1. [#3580]
      o Fixed a severe memory leak that occurred when reading tile
        compressed images. [#3680]
      o Fixed bug where column data could be unintentionally
        byte-swapped when copying data from an existing FITS file to a
        new FITS table with a TDIMn keyword for that column. [#3561]
      o The "ColDefs.change_attrib", "ColDefs.change_name", and
        "ColDefs.change_unit" methods now work as advertised.  It is
        also possible (and preferable) to update attributes directly
        on "Column" objects (for example setting "column.name"), and
        the change will be accurately reflected in any associated
        table data and its FITS header.  [#3283, #1539, #2618]
      o Fixes an issue with the "FITS_rec" interface to FITS table
        data, where a "FITS_rec" created by copying an existing FITS
        table but adding new rows could not be sliced or masked
        correctly.  [#3641]
    + "astropy.io.votable"
      o Loading a "TABLE" element without any "DATA" now correctly
        creates a 0-row array. [#3636]
    + "astropy.modeling"
      o Added workaround to support inverses on compound models when
        one of the sub-models is itself a compound model with a
        manually-assigned custom inverse. [#3542]
      o Fixed instantiation of polynomial models with constraints for
        parameters (constraints could still be assigned after
        instantiation, but not during).  [#3606]
      o Fixed fitting of 2D polynomial models with the
        "LeVMarLSQFitter". [#3606]
    + "astropy.table"
      o Ensure "QTable" can be pickled [#3590]
      o Some corner cases when instantiating an "astropy.table.Table"
        with a Numpy array are handled [#3637]. Notably:
      o a zero-length array is the same as passing "None"
      o a scalar raises a "ValueError"
      o a one-dimensional array is treated as a single row of a table.
    + "astropy.time"
      o Ensure a "Column" without units is treated as an "array", not
        as an
      o Ensure a "Column" without units is treated as an "array", not
        as an dimensionless "Quantity". [#3648]
    + "astropy.units"
      o Ensure equivalencies that do more than just scale a "Quantity"
        are properly handled also in "ufunc" evaluations. [#2496,
        #3586]
      o The LaTeX representation of the Angstrom unit has changed from
        "\overset{\circ}{A}" to "\mathring{A}", which should have
        better support across regular LaTeX, MathJax and matplotlib
        (as of version 1.5) [#3617]
    + "astropy.vo"
      o Using HTTPS/SSL for communication between SAMP hubs now works
        correctly on all supported versions of Python [#3613]
    + "astropy.wcs"
      o When no "relax" argument is passed to "WCS.to_header()" and
        the result omits non-standard WCS keywords, a warning is
        emitted. [#3652]
  * Other Changes and Additions
    + Nothing changed yet.
    + "astropy.units"
      o Clarified imperial mass measurements and added pound force
        (lbf), kilopound (kip), and pound per square inch
        (psi). [#3409]
    + "astropy.vo"
      o The number of retries for connections in "astropy.vo.samp" can
        now be configured by a "n_retries" configuration
        option. [#3612]
    + Testing
      o Running "astropy.test()" from within the IPython prompt has
        been provisionally re-enabled. [#3184]
- update to version 1.0.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    - astropy.constants
      + Ensure constants can be turned into Quantity safely. [#3537, #3538]
    - astropy.io.ascii
      + Fix a segfault in the fast C parser when one of the column headers is empty [#3545].
      + Fixed support for reading inf and nan values with the fast
        reader in Windows. Also fixed in the case of using
        use_fast_converter=True with the fast reader. [#3525]
      + Fixed use of mmap in the fast reader on Windows. [#3525]
      + Fixed issue where commented header would treat comments
        defining the table (i.e. column headers) as purely information
        comments, leading to problems when trying to round-trip the
        table. [#3562]
    - astropy.modeling
      + Fixed propagation of parameter constraints ('fixed', 'bounds',
        'tied') between compound models and their components. There is
        may still be some difficulty defining 'tied' constraints
        properly for use with compound models, however. [#3481]
    - astropy.nddata
      + Restore several properties to the compatibility class
        NDDataArray that were inadvertently omitted [#3466].
    - astropy.time
      + Time objects now always evalutate to True, except when
        empty. [#3530]
  * Other Changes and Additions
    - Updated bundled astropy-helpers version to v1.0.1 to address
      installation issues with some packages that depend on
      Astropy. [#3541]
  * Miscellaneous
    - astropy._erfa
      + The ERFA wrappers are now written directly in the Python/C API
        rather than using Cython, for greater performance. [#3521]
    - Improve import time of astropy [#3488].
- specfile: added fits2bitmap binary
- update to version 1.0:
  * General
    - Astropy now requires a Numpy 1.6.0 or later.
  * New Features
    - astropy.analytic_functions
      + The astropy.analytic_functions was added to contain analytic
        functions useful for astronomy [#3077].
    - astropy.coordinates
      + astropy.coordinates now has a full stack of frames allowing
        transformations from ICRS or other celestial systems down to
        Alt/Az coordinates. [#3217]
      + astropy.coordinates now has a get_sun function that gives the
        coordinates of the Sun at a specified time. [#3217]
      + SkyCoord now has to_pixel and from_pixel methods that convert
        between celestial coordinates as SkyCoord objects and pixel
        coordinates given an astropy.wcs.WCS object. [#3002]
      + SkyCoord now has search_around_sky and search_around_3d
        convenience methods that allow searching for all coordinates
        within a certain distance of another SkyCoord. [#2953]
      + SkyCoord can now accept a frame instance for the frame= keyword
        argument. [#3063]
      + SkyCoord now has a guess_from_table method that can be used to
        quickly create SkyCoord objects from an astropy.table.Table
        object. [#2951]
      + astropy.coordinates now has a Galactocentric frame, a coordinate
        frame centered on a (user specified) center of the Milky
        Way. [#2761, #3286]
      + SkyCoord now accepts more formats of the coordinate string when
        the representation has ra and dec attributes. [#2920]
      + SkyCoord can now accept lists of SkyCoord objects, frame
        objects, or representation objects and will combine them into a
        single object.  [#3285]
      + Frames and SkyCoord instances now have a method
        is_equivalent_frame that can be used to check that two frames
        are equivalent (ignoring the data).  [#3330]
      + The __repr__ of coordinate objects now shows scalar coordinates
        in the same format as vector coordinates. [#3350, 3448]
    - astropy.cosmology
      + Added lookback_distance, which is c * lookback_time. [#3145]
      + Add baryonic matter density and dark matter only density
        parameters to cosmology objects [#2757].
      + Add a clone method to cosmology objects to allow copies of
        cosmological objects to be created with the specified variables
        modified [#2592].
      + Increase default numerical precision of z_at_value following the
        accurate by default, fast by explicit request model [#3074].
      + Cosmology functions that take a single (redshift) input now
        broadcast like numpy ufuncs.  So, passing an arbitrarily shaped
        array of inputs will produce an output of the same
        shape. [#3178, #3194]
    - astropy.io.ascii
      + Simplify the way new Reader classes are defined, allowing custom
        behavior entirely by overriding inherited class attributes
        instead of setting instance attributes in the Reader __init__
        method. [#2812]
      + There is now a faster C/Cython engine available for reading and
        writing simple ASCII formats like CSV. Both are enabled by
        default, and fast reading will fall back on an ordinary reader
        in case of a parsing failure. Their behavior can be altered with
        the parameter fast_reader in read and fast_writer in
        write. [#2716]
      + Make Latex/AASTex tables use unit attribute of Column for
        output. [#3064]
      + Store comment lines encountered during reading in metadata of
        the output table via meta['comment_lines']. [#3222]
      + Write comment lines in Table metadata during output for all
        basic formats, IPAC, and fast writers. This functionality can be
        disabled with comment=False. [#3255]
      + Add reader / writer for the Enhanced CSV format which stores
        table and column meta data, in particular data type and
        unit. [#2319]
      + Automatically use guess=False when reading if the file format is
        provided and the format parameters are uniquely specified.  This
        update also removes duplicate format guesses to improve
        performance. [#3418]
    - astropy.io.fits
      + The fitsdiff script ignores some things by default when
        comparing fits files (e.g. empty header lines). This adds a
        --exact option where nothing is ignored. [#2782, #3110]
      + The fitsheader script now takes a --keyword option to extract a
        specific keyword from the header of a FITS file, and a --table
        option to export headers into any of the data formats supported
        by astropy.table. [#2555, #2588]
      + Section now supports all advanced indexing features ndarray does
        (slices with any steps, integer arrays, boolean arrays, None,
        Ellipsis).  It also properly returns scalars when this is
        appropriate. [#3148]
    - astropy.io.votable
      + astropy.io.votable.parse now takes a datatype_mapping keyword
        argument to map invalid datatype names to valid ones in order to
        support non-compliant files. [#2675]
    - astropy.modeling
      + Added the capability of creating new "compound" models by
        combining existing models using arithmetic operators.  See the
        "What's New in 1.0" page in the Astropy documentation for more
        details. [#3231]
      + A new custom_model decorator/factory function has been added for
        converting normal functions to Model classes that can work
        within the Astropy modeling framework.  This replaces the old
        custom_model_1d function which is now deprecated.  The new
        function works the same as the old one but is less limited in
        the types of models it can be used to created.  [#1763]
      + The Model and Fitter classes have .registry attributes which
        provide sets of all loaded Model and Fitter classes (this is
        useful for building UIs for models and fitting). [#2725]
      + A dict-like meta member was added to Model. it is to be used to
        store any optional information which is relevant to a project
        and is not in the standard Model class. [#2189]
      + Added Ellipse2D model. [#3124]
    - astropy.nddata
      + New array-related utility functions in astropy.nddata.utils for
        adding and removing arrays from other arrays with different
        sizes/shapes. [#3201]
      + New metaclass NDDataBase for enforcing the nddata interface in
        subclasses without restricting implementation of the data
        storage. [#2905]
      + New mixin classes NDSlicingMixin for slicing, NDArithmeticMixin
        for arithmetic operations, and NDIOMixin for input/ouput in
        NDData. [#2905]
      + Added a decorator support_nddata that can be used to write
        functions that can either take separate arguments or NDData
        objects. [#2855]
    - astropy.stats
      + Added mad_std() function. [#3208]
      + Added gaussian_fwhm_to_sigma and gaussian_sigma_to_fwhm
        constants. [#3208]
      + New function sigma_clipped_stats which can be used to quickly
        get common statistics for an array, using sigma clipping at the
        same time.  [#3201]
    - astropy.table
      + Changed the internal implementation of the Table class changed
        so that it no longer uses numpy structured arrays as the core
        table data container.  [#2790, #3179]
      + Tables can now be written to an html file that includes
        interactive browsing capabilities. To write out to this format,
        use Table.write('filename.html', format='jsviewer'). [#2875]
      + A quantity property and to method were added to Table columns
        that allow the column values to be easily converted to
        astropy.units.Quantity objects. [#2950]
      + Add unique convenience method to table. [#3185]
    - astropy.tests
      + Added a new Quantity-aware assert_quantity_allclose. [#3273]
    - astropy.time
      + Time can now handle arbitrary array dimensions, with operations
        following standard numpy broadcasting rules. [#3138]
    - astropy.units
      + Support for VOUnit has been updated to be compliant with version
        1.0 of the standard. [#2901]
      + Added an insert method to insert values into a Quantity object.
        This is similar to the numpy.insert function. [#3049]
      + When viewed in IPython, Quantity objects with array values now
        render using LaTeX and scientific notation. [#2271]
      + Added units.quantity_input decorator to validate quantity inputs
        to a function for unit compatibility. [#3072]
      + Added units.astronomical_unit as a long form for
        units.au. [#3303]
    - astropy.utils
      + Added a new decorator astropy.utils.wraps which acts as a
        replacement for the standard library's functools.wraps, the only
        difference being that the decorated function also preserves the
        wrapped function's call signature. [#2849]
      + astropy.utils.compat.numpy has been revised such that it can
        include patched versions of routines from newer numpy versions.
        The first addition is a version of broadcast_arrays that can be
        used with Quantity and other ndarray subclasses (using the
        subok=True flag). [#2327]
      + Added astropy.utils.resolve_name which returns a member of a
        module or class given the fully qualified dotted name of that
        object as a string. [#3389]
      + Added astropy.utils.minversion which can be used to check
        minimum version requirements of Python modules (to test for
        specific features and/ or bugs and the like). [#3389]
    - astropy.visualization
      + Created astropy.visualization module and added functionality
        relating to image normalization (i.e. stretching and scaling) as
        well as a new script fits2bitmap that can produce a bitmap image
        from a FITS file.  [#3201]
      + Added dictionary
        astropy.visualization.mpl_style.astropy_mpl_style which can be
        used to set a uniform plotstyle specifically for tutorials that
        is improved compared to matplotlib defaults. [#2719, #2787,
        #3200]
    - astropy.wcs
      + wcslib has been upgraded to version 4.25.  This brings a single
        new feature:
      + equinox and radesys will now be given default values conforming
        with the WCS specification if EQUINOXa and RADESYa,
        respectively, are not present in the header.
      + The minimum required version of wcslib is now 4.24. [#2503]
      + Added a new function wcs_to_celestial_frame that can be used to
        find the astropy.coordinates celestial frame corresponding to a
        particular WCS.  [#2730]
      + astropy.wcs.WCS.compare now supports a tolerance keyword
        argument to allow for approximate comparison of floating-point
        values. [#2503]
      + added pixel_scale_matrix, celestial, is_celestial, and
        has_celestial convenience attributes. Added
        proj_plane_pixel_scales, proj_plane_pixel_area, and
        non_celestial_pixel_scales utility functions for retrieving WCS
        pixel scale and area information [#2832, #3304]
      + Added two functions pixel_to_skycoord and skycoord_to_pixel that
        make it easy to convert between SkyCoord objects and pixel
        coordinates. [#2885]
      + all_world2pix now uses a much more sophisticated and complete
        algorithm to iteratively compute the inverse WCS
        transform. [#2816]
      + Add ability to use WCS object to define projections in
        Matplotlib, using the WCSAxes package. [#3183]
      + Added is_proj_plane_distorted for testing if pixels are
        distorted. [#3329]
    - Misc
      + astropy._erfa was added as a new subpackage wrapping the
        functionality of the ERFA library in python.  This is primarily
        of use for other astropy subpackages, but the API may be made
        more public in the future. [#2992]
  * API Changes
    - astropy.coordinates
      + Subclasses of BaseCoordinateFrame which define a custom repr
        should be aware of the format expected in SkyCoord.__repr__(),
        which changed in this release. [#2704, #2882]
      + The CartesianPoints class (deprecated in v0.4) has now been
        removed.  [#2990]
      + The previous astropy.coordinates.builtin_frames module is now a
        subpackage.  Everything that was in the
        astropy.coordinates.builtin_frames module is still accessible
        from the new package, but the classes are now in separate
        modules.  This should have no direct impact at the user
        level. [#3120]
      + Support for passing a frame as a positional argument in the
        SkyCoord class has now been deprecated, except in the case where
        a frame with data is passed as the sole positional
        argument. [#3152]
      + Improved __repr__ of coordinate objects representing a single
        coordinate point for the sake of easier copy/pasting. [#3350]
    - astropy.cosmology
      + The functional interface to the cosmological routines as well as
        set_current and get_current (deprecated in v0.4) have now been
        removed. [#2990]
    - astropy.io.ascii
      + Added a new argument to htmldict in the HTML reader named
        parser, which allows the user to specify which parser
        BeautifulSoup should use as a backend. [#2815]
      + Add FixedWidthTwoLine reader to guessing. This will allows to
        read tables that a copied from screen output like print my_table
        to be read automatically. Discussed in #3025 and #3099 [#3109]
    - astropy.io.fits
      + A new optional argument cache has been added to
        astropy.io.fits.open().  When opening a FITS file from a URL,
        cache is a boolean value specifying whether or not to save the
        file locally in Astropy's download cache (True by
        default). [#3041]
    - astropy.modeling
      + Model classes should now specify inputs and outputs class
        attributes instead of the old n_inputs and n_outputs.  These
        should be tuples providing human-readable *labels* for all
        inputs and outputs of the model.  The length of the tuple
        indicates the numbers of inputs and outputs.  See "What's New in
        Astropy 1.0" for more details. [#2835]
      + It is no longer necessary to include __init__ or __call__
        definitions in Model subclasses if all they do is wrap the
        super-method in order to provide a nice call signature to the
        docs.  The inputs class attribute is now used to generate a nice
        call signature, so these methods should only be overridden by
        Model subclasses in order to provide new functionality. [#2835]
      + Most models included in Astropy now have sensible default values
        for most or all of their parameters.  Call help(ModelClass) on
        any model to check what those defaults are.  Most of them time
        they should be overridden, but some of them are useful (for
        example spatial offsets are always set at the origin by
        default). Another rule of thumb is that, where possible, default
        parameters are set so that the model is a no-op, or close to it,
        by default. [#2932]
      + The Model.inverse method has been changed to a *property*, so
        that now accessing model.inverse on a model returns a new model
        that implements that model's inverse, and *calling*
        model.inverse(...)` on some independent variable computes the
        value of the inverse (similar to what the old Model.invert()
        method was meant to do).  [#3024]
      + The Model.invert() method has been removed entirely (it was
        never implemented and there should not be any existing code that
        relies on it).  [#3024]
      + custom_model_1d is deprecated in favor of the new custom_model
        (see "New Features" above).  [#1763]
      + The Model.param_dim property (deprecated in v0.4) has now been
        removed.  [#2990]
      + The Beta1D and Beta2D models have been renamed to Moffat1D and
        Moffat2D. [#3029]
    - astropy.nddata
      + flags, shape, size, dtype and ndim properties removed from
        astropy.nddata.NDData. [#2905]
      + Arithmetic operations, uncertainty propagation, slicing and
        automatic conversion to a numpy array removed from
        astropy.nddata.NDData. The class astropy.nddata.NDDataArray is
        functionally equivalent to the old NDData.  [#2905]
    - astropy.table
      + The Column.units property (deprecated in v0.3) has now been
        removed.  [#2990]
      + The Row.data and Table._data attributes have been deprecated
        related to the change in Table implementation.  They are
        replaced by Row.as_void() and Table.as_array() methods,
        respectively. [#2790]
      + The Table.create_mask method has been removed.  This
        undocumented method was a development orphan and would cause
        corruption of the table if called. [#2790]
      + The return type for integer item access to a Column
        (e.g. col[12] or t['a'][12]) is now always a numpy scalar, numpy
        ndarray, or numpy MaskedArray.  Previously if the column was
        multidimensional then a Column object would be returned. [#3095]
      + The representation of Table and Column objects has been changed
        to be formatted similar to the print output. [#3239]
    - astropy.time
      + The Time.val and Time.vals properties (deprecated in v0.3) and
        the Time.lon, and Time.lat properties (deprecated in v0.4) have
        now been removed. [#2990]
      + Add decimalyear format that represents time as a decimal
        year. [#3265]
    - astropy.units
      + Support for VOUnit has been updated to be compliant with version
        1.0 of the standard. This means that some VOUnit strings that
        were rejected before are now acceptable. [#2901] Notably:
        - SI prefixes are supported on most units
        - Binary prefixes are supported on "bits" and "bytes"
        - Custom units can be defined "inline" by placing them between single
          quotes.
      + Unit.get_converter has been deprecated.  It is not strictly
        necessary for end users, and it was confusing due to lack of
        support for Quantity objects. [#3456]
    - astropy.utils
      + Some members of astropy.utils.misc were moved into new
        submodules.  Specifically:
        - deprecated, deprecated_attribute, and lazyproperty ->
          astropy.utils.decorators
        - find_current_module, find_mod_objs ->
          astropy.utils.introspection
        All of these functions can be imported directly from
        astropy.utils which should be preferred over referencing
        individual submodules of astropy.utils.  [#2857]
      + The ProgressBar.iterate class method (deprecated in v0.3) has
        now been removed. [#2990]
      + Updated astropy/utils/console.py ProgressBar() module to display
        output to IPython notebook with the addition of an interactive
        kwarg. [#2658] [#2789]
    - astropy.wcs
      + The WCS.calcFootprint method (deprecated in v0.4) has now been
        removed.  [#2990]
      + An invalid unit in a CUNITn keyword now displays a warning and
        returns a UnrecognizedUnit instance rather than raising an
        exception [#3190]
  * Bug Fixes
    - astropy.convolution
      + astropy.convolution.discretize_model now handles arbitrary
        callables correctly [#2274].
    - astropy.coordinates
      + Angle.to_string now outputs unicode arrays instead of object
        arrays.  [#2981]
      + SkyCoord.to_string no longer gives an error when used with an
        array coordinate with more than one dimension. [#3340]
      + Fixed support for subclasses of UnitSphericalRepresentation and
        SphericalRepresentation [#3354, #3366]
      + Fixed latex display of array angles in IPython notebook. [#3480]
    - astropy.io.ascii
      + In the CommentedHeader the data_start parameter now defaults to
        0, which is the first uncommented line. Discussed in
        #2692. [#3054]
      + Position lines in FixedWidthTwoLine reader could consist of many
        characters.  Now, only one character in addition to the
        delimiter is allowed. This bug was discovered as part of [#3109]
      + The IPAC table writer now consistently uses the fill_values
        keyword to specify the output null values.  Previously the
        behavior was inconsistent or incorrect. [#3259]
      + The IPAC table reader now correctly interprets abbreviated
        column types.  [#3279]
      + Tables that look almost, but not quite like DAOPhot tables could
        cause guessing to fail. [#3342]
    - astropy.io.fits
      + Fixed the problem in fits.open of some filenames with colon (:)
        in the name being recognized as URLs instead of file
        names. [#3122]
      + Setting memmap=True in fits.open and related functions now
        raises a ValueError if opening a file in memory-mapped mode is
        impossible. [#2298]
      + CONTINUE cards no longer end the value of the final card in the
        series with an ampersand, per the specification of the CONTINUE
        card convention. [#3282]
      + Fixed a crash that occurred when reading an ASCII table
        containing zero-precision floating point fields. [#3422]
      + When a float field for an ASCII table has zero-precision a
        decimal point (with no digits following it) is still written to
        the field as long as there is space for it, as recommended by
        the FITS standard.  This makes it less ambiguous that these
        columns should be interpreted as floats. [#3422]
    - astropy.logger
      + Fix a bug that occurred when displaying warnings that produced
        an error message dictionary changed size during
        iteration. [#3353]
    - astropy.modeling
      + Fixed a bug in SLSQPLSQFitter where the maxiter argument was not
        passed correctly to the optimizer. [#3339]
    - astropy.table
      + Fix a problem where table.hstack fails to stack multiple
        references to the same table, e.g. table.hstack([t, t]). [#2995]
      + Fixed a problem where table.vstack and table.hstack failed to
        stack a single table, e.g. table.vstack([t]). [#3313]
      + Fix a problem when doing nested iterators on a single
        table. [#3358]
      + Fix an error when an empty list, tuple, or ndarray is used for
        item access within a table.  This now returns the table with no
        rows. [#3442]
    - astropy.time
      + When creating a Time object from a datetime object the time zone
        info is now correctly used. [#3160]
      + For Time objects, it is now checked that numerical input is
        finite. [#3396]
    - astropy.units
      + Added a latex_inline unit format that returns the units in LaTeX
        math notation with negative exponents instead of fractions
        [#2622].
      + When using a unit that is deprecated in a given unit format,
        non-deprecated alternatives will be suggested. [#2806] For
        example::
        >>> import astropy.units as u
        >>> u.Unit('Angstrom', format='fits')
        WARNING: UnitsWarning: The unit 'Angstrom' has been deprecated
        in the FITS standard. Suggested: nm (with data multiplied by
        0.1).  [astropy.units.format.utils]
    - astropy.utils
      + treat_deprecations_as_exceptions has been fixed to recognize
        Astropy deprecation warnings. [#3015]
    - astropy.wcs
      + astropy.wcs.WCS.sub now accepts unicode strings as input on
        Python 2.x [#3356]
    - Misc
      + Some modules and tests that would crash upon import when using a
        non-final release of Numpy (e.g. 1.9.0rc1). [#3471]
  * Other Changes and Additions
    - The bundled copy of astropy-helpers has been updated to
      v1.0. [#3515]
    - The bundled copy of astropy-helpers has been updated to
      v1.0. [#3513]
    - Updated astropy.extern.configobj to Version 5. Version 5 uses
      six and the same code covers both Python 2 and Python 3. [#3149]
    - astropy.coordinates
      + The repr of SkyCoord and coordinate frame classes now separate
        frame attributes and coordinate information.  [#2704, #2882]
    - astropy.io.fits
      + Overwriting an existing file using the clobber=True option no
        longer displays a warning message. [#1963]
      + fits.open no longer catches OSError exceptions on missing or
        unreadable files-- instead it raises the standard Python
        exceptions in such cases. [#2756, #2785]
    - astropy.table
      + Sped up setting of Column slices by an order of
        magnitude. [#2994, #3020]
    - Updated the bundled six module to version 1.7.3 and made 1.7.3
      the minimum acceptable version of six. [#2814]
    - The version of ERFA included with Astropy is now v1.1.1 [#2971]
    - The code base is now fully Python 2 and 3 compatible and no
      longer requires 2to3. [#2033]
    - `funcsigs <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/funcsigs>`_ is included
      in utils.compat, but defaults to the inspect module components
      where available (3.3+) [#3151].
    - The list of modules displayed in the pytest header can now be
      customized.  [#3157]
    - `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`_>=2.7 is now
      required to build the source code from the git repository, in
      order to allow the ERFA wrappers to be generated. [#3166]
- update to version 0.4.4:
  * astropy.vo.samp
    + astropy.vo.samp is now usable on Python builds that do not
      support the SSLv3 protocol (which depends both on the version of
      Python and the version of OpenSSL or LibreSSL that it is built
      against.) [#3308]
    + The default SSL protocol used is now determined from the default
      used in the Python ssl standard library. This default may be
      different depending on the exact version of Python you are
      using. [#3308]
  * astropy.wcs
    + WCS allows slices of the form slice(None, x, y), which
      previously resulted in an unsliced copy being returned (note:
      this was previously incorrectly reported as fixed in v0.4.3)
      [#2909]
- changes from version 0.4.3:
  * astropy.coordinates
    + The Distance class has been fixed to no longer rely on the
      deprecated cosmology functions. [#2991]
    + Ensure float32 values can be used in coordinate
      representations. [#2983]
    + Fix frame attribute inheritance in SkyCoord.transform_to()
      method so that the default attribute value (e.g. equinox) for
      the destination frame gets used if no corresponding value was
      explicitly specified. [#3106]
    + Angle accepts hours:mins or deg:mins initializers (without
      seconds). In these cases float minutes are also accepted.
    + astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord objects are now copyable. [#2888 ]
    + astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord object attributes are now
      immutable. It is still technically possible to change the
      internal data for an array-valued coordinate object but this
      leads to inconsistencies [#2889] and should not be done. [#2888]
  * astropy.cosmology
    + The ztol keyword argument to z_at_value now works correctly
      [#2993].
  *  astropy.io.ascii
    + Fix a bug in Python 3 when guessing file format using a file
      object as input. Also improve performance in same situation for
      Python 2. [#3132]
    + Fix a problem where URL was being downloaded for each
      guess. [#2001]
  * astropy.io.fits
    + The in operator now works correctly for checking if an extension
      is in an HDUList (as given via EXTNAME, (EXTNAME, EXTVER)
      tuples, etc.) [#3060]
    + Added workaround for bug in MacOS X <= 10.8 that caused
      np.fromfile to fail. [#3078]
    + Added support for the RICE_ONE compression type synonym. [#3115]
  * astropy.modeling
    + Fixed a test failure on Debian/PowerPC and Debian/s390x. [#2708]
    + Fixed crash in evaluating models that have more outputs than
      inputs--this case may not be handled as desired for all
      conceivable models of this format (some may have to implement
      custom prepare_inputs and prepare_outputs methods). But as long
      as all outputs can be assumed to have a shape determined from
      the broadcast of all inputs with all parameters then this can be
      used safely. [#3250]
  * astropy.table
    + Fix a bug that caused join to fail for multi-dimensional
      columns. [#2984]
    + Fix a bug where MaskedColumn attributes which had been changed
      since the object was created were not being carried through when
      slicing. [#3023]
    + Fix a bug that prevented initializing a table from a structured
      array with multi-dimensional columns with copy=True. [#3034]
    + Fixed unnecessarily large unicode columns when instantiating a
      table from row data on Python 3. [#3052]
    + Improved the warning message when unable to aggregate
      non-numeric columns. [#2700]
  * astropy.units
    + Operations on quantities with incompatible types now raises a
      much more informative TypeError. [#2934]
    + Quantity.tolist now overrides the ndarray method to give a
      NotImplementedError (by renaming the previous list
      method). [#3050]
    + Quantity.round now always returns a Quantity (previously it
      returned an ndarray for decimals>0). [#3062]
    + Ensured np.squeeze always returns a Quantity (it only worked if
      no dimensions were removed). [#3045]
    + Input to Quantity with a unit attribute no longer can get
      mangled with copy=False. [#3051]
    + Remove trailing space in __format__ calls for dimensionless
      quantities. [#3097]
    + Comparisons between units and non-unit-like objects now works
      correctly. [#3108]
    + Units with fractional powers are now correctly multiplied
      together by using rational arithmetic. [#3121]
    + Removed a few entries from spectral density equivalencies which
      did not make sense. [#3153]
  * astropy.utils
    + Fixed an issue with the deprecated decorator on classes that
      invoke super() in their __init__ method. [#3004]
    + Fixed a bug which caused the metadata_conflicts parameter to be
      ignored in the astropy.utils.metadata.merge function. [#3294]
  * astropy.vo
    + Fixed an issue with reconnecting to a SAMP Hub. [#2674 ]
  * astropy.wcs
    + Invalid or out of range values passed to wcs_world2pix will now
      be correctly identified and returned as nan values. [#2965]
    + Fixed an issue which meant that Python thought WCS objects were
      iterable. [#3066]
  *  Misc
    + Astropy will now work if your Python interpreter does not have
      the bz2 module installed. [#3104]
    + Fixed ResourceWarning for astropy/extern/bundled/six.py that
      could occur sometimes after using Astropy in Python 3.4. [#3156]
  * astropy.coordinates
    + Improved the agreement of the FK5 <-> Galactic conversion with
      other codes, and with the FK5 <-> FK4 <-> Galactic
      route. [#3107]
- specfile:
  * update copyright year
  * added libhdf5 requirement
- update to version 0.4.2:
  * astropy.coordinates
      - Angle accepts hours:mins or deg:mins initializers (without
        seconds). In these cases float minutes are also accepted.
      - The repr for coordinate frames now displays the frame
        attributes (ex: ra, dec) in a consistent order. It should be
        noted that as part of this fix, the
        BaseCoordinateFrame.get_frame_attr_names() method now returns
        an OrderedDict instead of just a dict. [#2845]
  * astropy.io.fits
    - Fixed a crash when reading scaled float data out of a FITS file
      that was loaded from a string (using HDUList.fromfile) rather
      than from a file. [#2710]
    - Fixed a crash when reading data from an HDU whose header
      contained in invalid value for the BLANK keyword (e.g., a string
      value instead of an integer as required by the FITS
      Standard). Invalid BLANK keywords are now warned about, but are
      otherwise ignored. [#2711]
    - Fixed a crash when reading the header of a tile-compressed HDU
      if that header contained invalid duplicate keywords resulting in
      a KeyError [#2750]
    - Fixed crash when reading gzip-compressed FITS tables through the
      Astropy Table interface. [#2783]
    - Fixed corruption when writing new FITS files through to gzipped
      files. [#2794]
    - Fixed crash when writing HDUs made with non-contiguous data
      arrays to file-like objects. [#2794]
    - It is now possible to create astropy.io.fits.BinTableHDU objects
      with a table with zero rows. [#2916]
  * astropy.io.misc
    - Fixed a bug that prevented h5py Dataset objects from being
      automatically recognized by Table.read. [#2831]
  * astropy.modeling
    - Make LevMarLSQFitter work with weights keyword. [#2900]
  * astropy.table
    - Fixed reference cycle in tables that could prevent Table objects
      from being freed from memory. [#2879]
    - Fixed an issue where Table.pprint() did not print the header to
      stdout when stdout is redirected (say, to a file). [#2878]
    - Fixed printing of masked values when a format is
      specified. [#1026]
    - Ensured that numpy ufuncs that return booleans return plain
      ndarray instances, just like the comparison operators. [#2963]
  * astropy.time
    - Ensure bigendian input to Time works on a little-endian machine
      (and vice versa). [#2942]
  * astropy.units
    - Ensure unit is kept when adding 0 to quantities. [#2968]
  * astropy.utils
    - Fixed color printing on Windows with IPython 2.0. [#2878]
  * astropy.vo
    - Improved error message on Cone Search time out. [#2687]
  * Fixed a couple issues with files being inappropriately included
    and/or excluded from the source archive distributions of
    Astropy. [#2843, #2854]
  * As part of fixing the fact that masked elements of table columns
    could not be printed when a format was specified, the column
    format string options were expanded to allow simple specifiers
    such as '5.2f'. [#2898]
  * Ensure numpy 1.9 is supported. [#2917]
  * Ensure numpy master is supported, by making np.cbrt work with
    quantities. [#2937]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 11 09:53:01 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Mark wcs headers as false positives for devel-file-in-non-devel-package
  These are used by the python files so they must be available.
- Update to 0.4.1 (2014-08-08)
  * Bug Fixes
    - ``astropy.config``
      - Fixed a bug where an unedited configuration file from astropy
        0.3.2 would not be correctly identified as unedited. [#2772] This
        resulted in the warning::
          WARNING: ConfigurationChangedWarning: The configuration options
          in astropy 0.4 may have changed, your configuration file was not
          updated in order to preserve local changes.  A new configuration
          template has been saved to
          '~/.astropy/config/astropy.0.4.cfg'. [astropy.config.configuration]
      - Fixed the error message that is displayed when an old
        configuration item has moved.  Before, the destination
        section was wrong.  [#2772]
      - Added configuration settings for ``io.fits``, ``io.votable`` and
        ``table.jsviewer`` that were missing from the configuration file
        template. [#2772]
      - The configuration template is no longer rewritten on every import
        of astropy, causing race conditions. [#2805]
    - ``astropy.convolution``
            - Fixed the multiplication of ``Kernel`` with numpy floats. [#2174]
    - ``astropy.coordinates``
      - ``Distance`` can now take a list of quantities. [#2261]
      - For in-place operations for ``Angle`` instances in which the result unit
        is not an angle, an exception is raised before the instance is corrupted.
        [#2718]
      - ``CartesianPoints`` are now deprecated in favor of
        ``CartesianRepresentation``. [#2727]
    - ``astropy.io.misc``
      - An existing table within an HDF5 file can be overwritten without affecting
        other datasets in the same HDF5 file by simultaneously using
        ``overwrite=True`` and ``append=True`` arguments to the ``Table.write``
        method. [#2624]
    - ``astropy.logger``
      - Fixed a crash that could occur in rare cases when (such as in bundled
        apps) where submodules of the ``email`` package are not importable. [#2671]
    - ``astropy.nddata``
      - ``astropy.nddata.NDData()`` no longer raises a ``ValueError`` when passed
        a numpy masked array which has no masked entries. [#2784]
    - ``astropy.table``
      - When saving a table to a FITS file containing a unit that is not
        supported by the FITS standard, a warning rather than an exception
        is raised. [#2797]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - By default, ``Quantity`` and its subclasses will now convert to float also
        numerical types such as ``decimal.Decimal``, which are stored as objects
        by numpy. [#1419]
      - The units ``count``, ``pixel``, ``voxel`` and ``dbyte`` now output
        to FITS, OGIP and VOUnit formats correctly. [#2798]
    - ``astropy.utils``
      - Restored missing information from deprecation warning messages
        from the ``deprecated`` decorator. [#2811]
      - Fixed support for ``staticmethod`` deprecation in the ``deprecated``
        decorator. [#2811]
    - ``astropy.wcs``
      - Fixed a memory leak when ``astropy.wcs.WCS`` objects are copied
        [#2754]
      - Fixed a crash when passing ``ra_dec_order=True`` to any of the
        ``*2world`` methods. [#2791]
  * Other Changes and Additions
    - Bundled copy of astropy-helpers upgraded to v0.4.1. [#2825]
    - General improvements to documentation and docstrings [#2722, #2728, #2742]
    - Made it easier for third-party packagers to have Astropy use their own
      version of the ``six`` module (so long as it meets the minimum version
      requirement) and remove the copy bundled with Astropy.  See the
      astropy/extern/README file in the source tree.  [#2623]
- Update to 0.4 (2014-07-16)
  * New Features
    - ``astropy.constants``
      - Added ``b_wien`` to represent Wien wavelength displacement law constant.
        [#2194]
    - ``astropy.convolution``
      - Changed the input parameter in ``Gaussian1DKernel`` and
        ``Gaussian2DKernel`` from ``width`` to ``stddev`` [#2085].
    - ``astropy.coordinates``
      - The coordinates package has undergone major changes to implement
        `APE5 <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE5.rst>`_ .
        These include backwards-incompatible changes, as the underlying framework
        has changed substantially. See the APE5 text and the package documentation
        for more details. [#2422]
      - A ``position_angle`` method has been added to the new ``SkyCoord``. [#2487]
      - Updated ``Angle.dms`` and ``Angle.hms`` to return ``namedtuple`` -s instead
        of regular tuples, and added ``Angle.signed_dms`` attribute that gives the
        absolute value of the ``d``, ``m``, and ``s`` along with the sign.  [#1988]
      - By default, ``Distance`` objects are now required to be positive. To
        allow negative values, set ``allow_negative=True`` in the ``Distance``
        constructor when creating a ``Distance`` instance.
      - ``Longitude`` (resp. ``Latitude``) objects cannot be used any more to
        initialize or set ``Latitude`` (resp. ``Longitude``) objects. An explicit
        conversion to ``Angle`` is now required. [#2461]
      - The deprecated functions for pre-0.3 coordinate object names like
        ``ICRSCoordinates`` have been removed. [#2422]
      - The ``rotation_matrix`` and ``angle_axis`` functions in
        ``astropy.coordinates.angles`` were made more numerically consistent and
        are now tested explicitly [#2619]
    - ``astropy.cosmology``
      - Added ``z_at_value`` function to find the redshift at which a cosmology
        function matches a desired value. [#1909]
      - Added ``FLRW.differential_comoving_volume`` method to give the differential
        comoving volume at redshift z. [#2103]
      - The functional interface is now deprecated in favor of the more-explicit
        use of methods on cosmology objects. [#2343]
      - Updated documentation to reflect the removal of the functional
        interface. [#2507]
    - ``astropy.io.ascii``
      - The ``astropy.io.ascii`` output formats ``latex`` and ``aastex`` accept a
        dictionary called ``latex_dict`` to specify options for LaTeX output.  It is
        now possible to specify the table alignment within the text via the
        ``tablealign`` keyword. [#1838]
      - If ``header_start`` is specified in a call to ``ascii.get_reader`` or any
        method that calls ``get_reader`` (e.g. ``ascii.read``) but ``data_start``
        is not specified at the same time, then ``data_start`` is calculated so
        that the data starts after the header. Before this, the default was
        that the header line was read again as the first data line
        [#855 and #1844].
      - A new ``csv`` format was added as a convenience for handling CSV (comma-
        separated values) data. [#1935]
        This format also recognises rows with an inconsistent number of elements.
        [#1562]
      - An option was added to guess the start of data for CDS format files when
        they do not strictly conform to the format standard. [#2241]
      - Added an HTML reader and writer to the ``astropy.io.ascii`` package.
        Parsing requires the installation of BeautifulSoup and is therefore
        an optional feature. [#2160]
      - Added support for inputting column descriptions and column units
        with the ``io.ascii.SExtractor`` reader. [#2372]
      - Allow the use of non-local ReadMe files in the CDS reader. [#2329]
      - Provide a mechanism to select how masked values are printed. [#2424]
      - Added support for reading multi-aperture daophot file. [#2656]
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      - Included a new command-line script called ``fitsheader`` to display the
        header(s) of a FITS file from the command line. [#2092]
      - Added new verification options ``fix+ignore``, ``fix+warn``,
        ``fix+exception``, ``silentfix+ignore``, ``silentfix+warn``, and
        ``silentfix+exception`` which give more control over how to report fixable
        errors as opposed to unfixable errors.
    - ``astropy.modeling``
      - Prototype implementation of fitters that treat optimization algorithms
        separately from fit statistics, allowing new fitters to be created by
        mixing and matching optimizers and statistic functions. [#1914]
      - Slight overhaul to how inputs to and outputs from models are handled with
        respect to array-valued parameters and variables, as well as sets of
        multiple models.  See the associated PR and the modeling section of the
        v0.4 documentation for more details. [#2634]
      - Added a new ``SimplexLSQFitter`` which uses a downhill simplex optimizer
        with a least squares statistic. [#1914]
      - Changed ``Gaussian2D`` model such that ``theta`` now increases
        counterclockwise. [#2199]
      - Replaced the ``MatrixRotation2D`` model with a new model called simply
        ``Rotation2D`` which requires only an angle to specify the rotation.
        The new ``Rotation2D`` rotates in a counter-clockwise sense whereas
        the old ``MatrixRotation2D`` increased the angle clockwise.
        [#2266, #2269]
      - Added a new ``AffineTransformation2D`` model which serves as a
        replacement for the capability of ``MatrixRotation2D`` to accept an
        arbitrary matrix, while also adding a translation capability. [#2269]
      - Added ``GaussianAbsorption1D`` model. [#2215]
      - New ``Redshift`` model [#2176].
    - ``astropy.nddata``
      - Allow initialization ``NDData`` or ``StdDevUncertainty`` with a
        ``Quantity``. [#2380]
    - ``astropy.stats``
      - Added flat prior to binom_conf_interval and binned_binom_proportion
      - Change default in ``sigma_clip`` from ``np.median`` to ``np.ma.median``.
        [#2582]
    - ``astropy.sphinx``
      - Note, the following new features are included in astropy-helpers as well:
      - The ``automodapi`` and ``automodsumm`` extensions now include sphinx
        configuration options to write out what ``automodapi`` and ``automodsumm``
        generate, mainly for debugging purposes. [#1975, #2022]
      - Reference documentation now shows functions/class docstrings at the
        inteded user-facing API location rather than the actual file where
        the implementation is found. [#1826]
      - The ``automodsumm`` extension configuration was changed to generate
        documentation of class ``__call__`` member functions. [#1817, #2135]
      - ``automodapi`` and ``automodsumm`` now have an ``:allowed-package-names:``
        option that make it possible to document functions and classes that
        are in a different namespace.  [#2370]
    - ``astropy.table``
      - Improved grouped table aggregation by using the numpy ``reduceat()`` method
        when possible. This can speed up the operation by a factor of at least 10
        to 100 for large unmasked tables and columns with relatively small
        group sizes.  [#2625]
      - Allow row-oriented data input using a new ``rows`` keyword argument.
        [#850]
      - Allow subclassing of ``Table`` and the component classes ``Row``, ``Column``,
        ``MaskedColumn``, ``TableColumns``, and ``TableFormatter``. [#2287]
      - Fix to allow numpy integer types as valid indices into tables in
        Python 3.x [#2477]
      - Remove transition code related to the order change in ``Column`` and
        ``MaskedColumn`` arguments ``name`` and ``data`` from Astropy 0.2
        to 0.3. [#2511]
      - Change HTML table representation in IPython notebook to show all
        table columns instead of restricting to 80 column width.  [#2651]
    - ``astropy.time``
      - Mean and apparent sidereal time can now be calculated using the
        ``sidereal_time`` method [#1418].
      - The time scale now defaults to UTC if no scale is provided. [#2091]
      - ``TimeDelta`` objects can have all scales but UTC, as well as, for
        consistency with time-like quantities, undefined scale (where the
        scale is taken from the object one adds to or subtracts from).
        This allows, e.g., to work consistently in TDB.  [#1932]
      - ``Time`` now supports ISO format strings that end in "Z". [#2211, #2203]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - Support for the unit format `Office of Guest Investigator Programs (OGIP)
        FITS files
        <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/general/ogip_93_001/>`__
        has been added. [#377]
      - The ``spectral`` equivalency can now handle angular wave number. [#1306 and
        #1899]
      - Added ``one`` as a shorthand for ``dimensionless_unscaled``. [#1980]
      - Added ``dex`` and ``dB`` units. [#1628]
      - Added ``temperature()`` equivalencies to support conversion between
        Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit. [#2209]
      - Added ``temperature_energy()`` equivalencies to support conversion
        between electron-volt and Kelvin. [#2637]
      - The runtime of ``astropy.units.Unit.compose`` is greatly improved
        (by a factor of 2 in most cases) [#2544]
      - Added ``electron`` unit. [#2599]
    - ``astropy.utils``
      - ``timer.RunTimePredictor`` now uses ``astropy.modeling`` in its
        ``do_fit()`` method. [#1896]
    - ``astropy.vo``
      - A new sub-package, ``astropy.vo.samp``, is now available (this was
        previously the SAMPy package, which has been refactored for use in
        Astropy). [#1907]
      - Enhanced functionalities for ``VOSCatalog`` and ``VOSDatabase``. [#1206]
    - ``astropy.wcs``
      - astropy now requires wcslib version 4.23 or later.  The version of
        wcslib included with astropy has been updated to version 4.23.
      - Bounds checking is now performed on native spherical
        coordinates.  Any out-of-bounds values will be returned as
        ``NaN``, and marked in the ``stat`` array, if using the
        low-level ``wcslib`` interface such as
        ``astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.p2s``. [#2107]
      - A new method, ``astropy.wcs.WCS.compare()``, compares two wcsprm
        structs for equality with varying degrees of strictness. [#2361]
      - New ``astropy.wcs.utils`` module, with a handful of tools for manipulating
        WCS objects, including dropping, swapping, and adding axes.
    - Misc
      - Includes the new astropy-helpers package which separates some of Astropy's
        build, installation, and documentation infrastructure out into an
        independent package, making it easier for Affiliated Packages to depend on
        these features.  astropy-helpers replaces/deprecates some of the submodules
        in the ``astropy`` package (see API Changes below).  See also
        `APE 4 <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE4.rst>`_
        for more details on the motivation behind and implementation of
        astropy-helpers.  [#1563]
  * API Changes
    - ``astropy.config``
      - The configuration system received a major overhaul, as part of APE3.  It is
        no longer possible to save configuration items from Python, but instead
        users must edit the configuration file directly.  The locations of
        configuration items have moved, and some have been changed to science state
        values.  The old locations should continue to work until astropy 0.5, but
        deprecation warnings will be displayed.  See the `Configuration transition
        <http://astropy.readthedocs.org/en/v0.4/config/config_0_4_transition.html>`_
        docs for a detailed description of the changes and how to update existing
        code. [#2094]
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      - The ``astropy.io.fits.new_table`` function is now fully deprecated (though
        will not be removed for a long time, considering how widely it is used).
        Instead please use the more explicit ``BinTableHDU.from_columns`` to create
        a new binary table HDU, and the similar ``TableHDU.from_columns`` to create
        a new ASCII table.  These otherwise accept the same arguments as
        ``new_table`` which is now just a wrapper for these.
      - The ``.fromstring`` classmethod of each HDU type has been simplified such
        that, true to its namesake, it only initializes an HDU from a string
        containing its header *and* data.
      - Fixed an issue where header wildcard matching (for example
        ``header['DATE*']``) can be used to match *any* characters that might
        appear in a keyword.  Previously this only matched keywords containing
        characters in the set ``[0-9A-Za-z_]``.  Now this can also match a hyphen
        ``-`` and any other characters, as some conventions like ``HIERARCH`` and
        record-valued keyword cards allow a wider range of valid characters than
        standard FITS keywords.
      - This will be the *last* release to support the following APIs that have
        been marked deprecated since Astropy v0.1/PyFITS v3.1:
        - The ``CardList`` class, which was part of the old header implementation.
        - The ``Card.key`` attribute.  Use ``Card.keyword`` instead.
        - The ``Card.cardimage`` and ``Card.ascardimage`` attributes.  Use simply
          ``Card.image`` or ``str(card)`` instead.
        - The ``create_card`` factory function.  Simply use the normal ``Card``
          constructor instead.
        - The ``create_card_from_string`` factory function.  Use ``Card.fromstring``
          instead.
        - The ``upper_key`` function.  Use ``Card.normalize_keyword`` method
          instead (this is not unlikely to be used outside of PyFITS itself, but it
          was technically public API).
        - The usage of ``Header.update`` with ``Header.update(keyword, value,
          comment)`` arguments.  ``Header.update`` should only be used analogously
          to ``dict.update``.  Use ``Header.set`` instead.
        - The ``Header.ascard`` attribute.  Use ``Header.cards`` instead for a list
          of all the ``Card`` objects in the header.
        - The ``Header.rename_key`` method.  Use ``Header.rename_keyword`` instead.
        - The ``Header.get_history`` method.  Use ``header['HISTORY']`` instead
          (normal keyword lookup).
        - The ``Header.get_comment`` method.  Use ``header['COMMENT']`` instead.
        - The ``Header.toTxtFile`` method.  Use ``header.totextfile`` instead.
        - The ``Header.fromTxtFile`` method.  Use ``Header.fromtextfile`` instead.
        - The ``tdump`` and ``tcreate`` functions.  Use ``tabledump`` and
          ``tableload`` respectively.
        - The ``BinTableHDU.tdump`` and ``tcreate`` methods.  Use
          ``BinTableHDU.dump`` and ``BinTableHDU.load`` respectively.
        - The ``txtfile`` argument to the ``Header`` constructor.  Use
          ``Header.fromfile`` instead.
        - The ``startColumn`` and ``endColumn`` arguments to the ``FITS_record``
          constructor.  These are unlikely to be used by any user code.
        These deprecated interfaces will be removed from the development version of
        Astropy following the v0.4 release (they will still be available in any
        v0.4.x bugfix releases, however).
    - ``astropy.modeling``
      - The method computing the derivative of the model with respect
        to parameters was renamed from ``deriv`` to ``fit_deriv``. [#1739]
      - ``ParametricModel`` and the associated ``Parametric1DModel`` and
        ``Parametric2DModel`` classes have been renamed ``FittableModel``,
        ``Fittable1DModel``, and ``Fittable2DModel`` respectively.  The base
        ``Model`` class has subsumed the functionality of the old
        ``ParametricModel`` class so that all models support parameter constraints.
        The only distinction of ``FittableModel`` is that anything which subclasses
        it is assumed "safe" to use with Astropy fitters. [#2276]
      - ``NonLinearLSQFitter`` has been renamed ``LevMarLSQFitter`` to emphasise
        that it uses the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm with a
        least squares statistic function. [#1914]
      - The ``SLSQPFitter`` class has been renamed ``SLSQPLSQFitter`` to emphasize
        that it uses the Sequential Least Squares Programming optimization
        algorithm with a least squares statistic function. [#1914]
      - The ``Fitter.errorfunc`` method has been renamed to the more general
        ``Fitter.objective_function``. [#1914]
    - ``astropy.nddata``
      - Issue warning if unit is changed from a non-trivial value by directly
        setting ``NDData.unit``. [#2411]
      - The ``mask`` and ``flag`` attributes of ``astropy.nddata.NDData`` can now
        be set with any array-like object instead of requiring that they be set
        with a ``numpy.ndarray``. [#2419]
    - ``astropy.sphinx``
      - Use of the ``astropy.sphinx`` module is deprecated; all new development of
        this module is in ``astropy_helpers.sphinx`` which should be used instead
        (therefore documentation builds that made use of any of the utilities in
        ``astropy.sphinx`` now have ``astropy_helpers`` as a documentation
        dependency).
    - ``astropy.table``
      - The default table printing function now shows a table header row for units
        if any columns have the unit attribute set.  [#1282]
      - Before, an unmasked ``Table`` was automatically converted to a masked
        table if generated from a masked Table or a ``MaskedColumn``.
        Now, this conversion is only done if explicitly requested or if any
        of the input values is actually masked. [#1185]
      - The repr() function of ``astropy.table.Table`` now shows the units
        if any columns have the unit attribute set.  [#2180]
      - The semantics of the config options ``table.max_lines`` and
        ``table.max_width`` has changed slightly.  If these values are not
        set in the config file, astropy will try to determine the size
        automatically from the terminal. [#2683]
    - ``astropy.time``
      - Correct use of UT in TDB calculation [#1938, #1939].
      - ``TimeDelta`` objects can have scales other than TAI [#1932].
      - Location information should now be passed on via an ``EarthLocation``
        instance or anything that initialises it, e.g., a tuple containing
        either geocentric or geodetic coordinates. [#1928]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - ``Quantity`` now converts input to float by default, as this is physically
        most sensible for nearly all units [#1776].
      - ``Quantity`` comparisons with ``==`` or ``!=`` now always return ``True``
        or ``False``, even if units do not match (for which case a ``UnitsError``
        used to be raised).  [#2328]
      - Applying ``float`` or ``int`` to a ``Quantity`` now works for all
        dimensionless quantities; they are automatically converted to unscaled
        dimensionless. [#2249]
      - The exception ``astropy.units.UnitException``, which was
        deprecated in astropy 0.2, has been removed.  Use
        ``astropy.units.UnitError`` instead [#2386]
      - Initializing a ``Quantity`` with a valid number/array with a ``unit``
        attribute now interprets that attribute as the units of the input value.
        This makes it possible to initialize a ``Quantity`` from an Astropy
        ``Table`` column and have it correctly pick up the units from the column.
        [#2486]
    - ``astropy.wcs``
      - ``calcFootprint`` was deprecated. It is replaced by
        ``calc_footprint``.  An optional boolean keyword ``center`` was
        added to ``calc_footprint``.  It controls whether the centers or
        the corners of the pixels are used in the computation. [#2384]
      - ``astropy.wcs.WCS.sip_pix2foc`` and
        ``astropy.wcs.WCS.sip_foc2pix`` formerly did not conform to the
        ``SIP`` standard: ``CRPIX`` was added to the ``foc`` result so
        that it could be used as input to "core FITS WCS".  As of astropy
        0.4, ``CRPIX`` is no longer added to the result, so the ``foc``
        space is correct as defined in the `SIP convention
        <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ASPC..347..491S>`__. [#2360]
      - ``astropy.wcs.UnitConverter``, which was deprecated in astropy
        0.2, has been removed.  Use the ``astropy.units`` module
        instead. [#2386]
      - The following methods on ``astropy.wcs.WCS``, which were
        deprecated in astropy 0.1, have been removed [#2386]:
        - ``all_pix2sky`` -> ``all_pix2world``
        - ``wcs_pix2sky`` -> ``wcs_pix2world``
        - ``wcs_sky2pix`` -> ``wcs_world2pix``
      - The ``naxis1`` and ``naxis2`` attributes and the ``get_naxis``
        method of ``astropy.wcs.WCS``, which were deprecated in astropy
        0.2, have been removed.  Use the shape of the underlying FITS data
        array instead.  [#2386]
    - Misc
      - The ``astropy.setup_helpers`` and ``astropy.version_helpers`` modules are
        deprecated; any non-critical fixes and development to those modules should
        be in ``astropy_helpers`` instead.  Packages that use these modules in
        their ``setup.py`` should depend on ``astropy_helpers`` following the same
        pattern as in the Astropy package template.
  * Bug Fixes
    - ``astropy.constants``
      - ``astropy.constants.Contant`` objects can now be deep
        copied. [#2601]
    - ``astropy.cosmology``
      - The distance modulus function in ``astropy.cosmology`` can now handle
        negative distances, which can occur in certain closed cosmologies. [#2008]
      - Removed accidental imports of some extraneous variables in
        ``astropy.cosmology`` [#2025]
    - ``astropy.io.ascii``
      - ``astropy.io.ascii.read`` would fail to read lists of strings where some of
        the strings consisted of just a newline ("\n"). [#2648]
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      - Use NaN for missing values in FITS when using Table.write for float
        columns. Earlier the default fill value was close to 1e20.[#2186]
      - Fixes for checksums on 32-bit platforms.  Results may be different
        if writing or checking checksums in "nonstandard" mode.  [#2484]
      - Additional minor bug fixes ported from PyFITS.  [#2575]
    - ``astropy.io.votable``
      - It is now possible to save an ``astropy.table.Table`` object as a
        VOTable with any of the supported data formats, ``tabledata``,
        ``binary`` and ``binary2``, by using the ``tabledata_format``
        kwarg. [#2138]
      - Fixed a crash writing out variable length arrays. [#2577]
    - ``astropy.nddata``
      - Indexing ``NDData`` in a way that results in a single element returns that
        element. [#2170]
      - Change construction of result of arithmetic and unit conversion to allow
        subclasses to require the presence of attribute like unit. [#2300]
      - Scale uncertainties to correct units in arithmetic operations and unit
        conversion. [#2393]
      - Ensure uncertainty and mask members are copied in arithmetic and
        convert_unit_to. [#2394]
      - Mask result of arithmetic if either of the operands is masked. [#2403]
      - Copy all attributes of input object if ``astropy.nddata.NDData`` is
        initialized with an ``NDData`` object. [#2406]
      - Copy ``flags`` to new object in ``convert_unit_to``. [#2409]
      - Result of ``NDData`` arithmetic makes a copy of any WCS instead of using
        a reference. [#2410]
      - Fix unit handling for multiplication/division and use
        ``astropy.units.Quantity`` for units arithmetic. [#2413]
      - A masked ``NDData`` is now converted to a masked array when used in an
        operation or ufunc with a numpy array. [#2414]
      - An unmasked ``NDData`` now uses an internal representation of its mask
        state that ``numpy.ma`` expects so that an ``NDData`` behaves as an
        unmasked array. [#2417]
    - ``astropy.sphinx``
      - Fix crash in smart resolver when the resolution doesn't work. [#2591]
    - ``astropy.table``
      - The ``astropy.table.Column`` object can now use both functions and callable
        objects as formats. [#2313]
      - Fixed a problem on 64 bit windows that caused errors
        "expected 'DTYPE_t' but got 'long long'" [#2490]
      - Fix initialisation of ``TableColumns`` with lists or tuples.  [#2647]
      - Fix removal of single column using ``remove_columns``. [#2699]
      - Fix a problem that setting a row element within a masked table did not
        update the corresponding table element. [#2734]
    - ``astropy.time``
      - Correct UT1->UTC->UT1 round-trip being off by 1 second if UT1 is
        on a leap second. [#2077]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - ``Quantity.copy`` now behaves identically to ``ndarray.copy``, and thus
        supports the ``order`` argument (for numpy >=1.6). [#2284]
      - Composing base units into identical composite units now works. [#2382]
      - Creating and composing/decomposing units is now substantially faster [#2544]
      - ``Quantity`` objects now are able to be assigned NaN [#2695]
    - ``astropy.wcs``
      - Astropy now requires wcslib version 4.23 or later.  The version of
        wcslib included with astropy has been updated to version 4.23.
      - Bug fixes in the projection routines: in ``hpxx2s`` [the
        cartesian-to-spherical operation of the ``HPX`` projection]
        relating to bounds checking, bug introduced at wcslib 4.20; in
        ``parx2s`` and molx2s`` [the cartesion-to-spherical operation of
        the ``PAR`` and ``MOL`` projections respectively] relating to
        setting the stat vector; in ``hpxx2s`` relating to implementation
        of the vector API; and in ``xphx2s`` relating to setting an
        out-of-bounds value of *phi*.
      - In the ``PCO`` projection, use alternative projection equations
        for greater numerical precision near theta == 0.  In the ``COP``
        projection, return an exact result for theta at the poles.
        Relaxed the tolerance for bounds checking a little in ``SFL``
        projection.
      - Fix a bug allocating insufficient memory in
        ``astropy.wcs.WCS.sub`` [#2468]
      - A new method, ``Wcsprm.bounds_check`` (corresponding to wcslib's
        ``wcsbchk``) has been added to control what bounds checking is performed by
        wcslib.
      - ``WCS.to_header`` will now raise a more meaningful exception when the WCS
        information is invalid or inconsistent in some way. [#1854]
      - In ``WCS.to_header``, ``RESTFRQ`` and ``RESTWAV`` are no longer
        rewritten if zero. [#2468]
      - In ``WCS.to_header``, floating point values will now always be written
        with an exponent or fractional part, i.e. ``.0`` being appended if necessary
        to acheive this. [#2468]
      - If the C extension for ``astropy.wcs`` was not built or fails to import for
        any reason, ``import astropy.wcs`` will result in an ``ImportError``,
        rather than getting obscure errors once the ``astropy.wcs`` is used.
        [#2061]
      - When the C extension for ``astropy.wcs`` is built using a version of
        ``wscslib`` already present in the system, the package does not try
        to install ``wcslib`` headers under ``astropy/wcs/include``. [#2536]
      - Fixes an unresolved external symbol error in the
        `astropy.wcs._wcs` C extension on Microsoft Windows when built
        with a Microsoft compiler. [#2478]
    - Misc
      - Running the test suite with ``python setup.py test`` now works if
        the path to the source contains spaces. [#2488]
      - The version of ERFA included with Astropy is now v1.1.0 [#2497]
      - Removed deprecated option from travis configuration and force use of
        wheels rather than allowing build from source. [#2576]
      - The short option ``-n`` to run tests in parallel was broken
        (conflicts with the distutils built-in option of "dry-run").
        Changed to ``-j``. [#2566]
  * Other Changes and Additions
    - ``python setup.py test --coverage`` will now give more accurate
      results, because the coverage analysis will include early imports of
      astropy.  There doesn't seem to be a way to get this to work when
      doing ``import astropy; astropy.test()``, so the ``coverage``
      keyword to ``astropy.test`` has been removed.  Coverage testing now
      depends only on `coverage.py
      <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`__, not
      ``pytest-cov``. [#2112]
    - The included version of py.test has been upgraded to 2.5.1. [#1970]
    - The included version of six.py has been upgraded to 1.5.2. [#2006]
    - Where appropriate, tests are now run both with and without the
      ``unicode_literals`` option to ensure that we support both cases. [#1962]
    - Running the Astropy test suite from within the IPython REPL is disabled for
      now due to bad interaction between the test runner and IPython's logging
      and I/O handler.  For now, run the Astropy tests should be run in the basic
      Python interpreter. [#2684]
    - Added support for numerical comparison of floating point values appearing in
      the output of doctests using a ``+FLOAT_CMP`` doctest flag. [#2087]
    - A monkey patch is performed to fix a bug in Numpy version 1.7 and
      earlier where unicode fill values on masked arrays are not
      supported.  This may cause unintended side effects if your
      application also monkey patches ``numpy.ma`` or relies on the broken
      behavior.  If unicode support of masked arrays is important to your
      application, upgrade to Numpy 1.8 or later for best results. [#2059]
    - The developer documentation has been extensively rearranged and
      rewritten. [#1712]
    - The ``human_time`` function in ``astropy.utils`` now returns strings
      without zero padding. [#2420]
    - The ``bdist_dmg`` command for ``setup.py`` has now been removed. [#2553]
    - Many broken API links have been fixed in the documentation, and the
      ``nitpick`` Sphinx option is now used to avoid broken links in future.

      #2460, #2467, #2476, #2508, #2509]
- Update to 0.3.2 (2014-05-13)
  * Bug Fixes
    - ``astropy.coordinates``
      - if ``sep`` argument is specified to be a single character in
        ``sexagisimal_to_string``, it now includes seperators only between
        items [#2183]
      - Ensure comparisons involving ``Distance`` objects do not raise exceptions;
        also ensure operations that lead to units other than length return
        ``Quantity``. [#2206, #2250]
      - Multiplication and division of ``Angle`` objects is now
        supported. [#2273]
      - Fixed ``Angle.to_string`` functionality so that negative angles have the
        correct amount of padding when ``pad=True``. [#2337]
      - Mixing strings and quantities in the ``Angle`` constructor now
        works.  For example: ``Angle(['1d', 1. * u.d])``.  [#2398]
      - If ``Longitude`` is given a ``Longitude`` as input, use its ``wrap_angle``
        by default [#2705]
    - ``astropy.cosmology``
      - Fixed ``format()`` compatibility with Python 2.6. [#2129]
      - Be more careful about converting to floating point internally [#1815, #1818]
    - ``astropy.io.ascii``
      - The CDS reader in ``astropy.io.ascii`` can now handle multiple
        description lines in ReadMe files. [#2225]
      - When reading a table with values that generate an overflow error during
        type conversion (e.g. overflowing the native C long type), fall through to
        using string. Previously this generated an exception [#2234].
      - Some CDS files mark missing values with ``"---"``, others with ``"--"``.
        Recognize any string with one to four dashes as null value. [#1335]
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      - Allow pickling of ``FITS_rec`` objects. [#1597]
      - Improved behavior when writing large compressed images on OSX by removing
        an unncessary check for platform architecture. [#2345]
      - Fixed an issue where Astropy ``Table`` objects containing boolean columns
        were not correctly written out to FITS files. [#1953]
      - Several other bug fixes ported from PyFITS v3.2.3 [#2368]
      - Fixed a crash on Python 2.x when writing a FITS file directly to a
        ``StringIO.StringIO`` object. [#2463]
    - ``astropy.io.registry``
      - Allow readers/writers with the same name to be attached to different
        classes. [#2312]
    - ``astropy.io.votable``
      - By default, floating point values are now written out using
        ``repr`` rather than ``str`` to preserve precision [#2137]
    - ``astropy.modeling``
      - Fixed the ``SIP`` and ``InverseSIP`` models both so that they work in the
        first place, and so that they return results consistent with the SIP
        functions in ``astropy.wcs``. [#2177]
    - ``astropy.stats``
      - Ensure the ``axis`` keyword in ``astropy.stats.funcs`` can now be used for
        all axes. [#2173]
    - ``astropy.table``
      - Ensure nameless columns can be printed, using 'None' for the header. [#2213]
    - ``astropy.time``
      - Fixed pickling of ``Time`` objects. [#2123]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - ``Quantity._repr_latex_()`` returns ``NotImplementedError`` for quantity
        arrays instead of an uninformative formatting exception. [#2258]
      - Ensure ``Quantity.flat`` always returns ``Quantity``. [#2251]
      - Angstrom unit renders better in MathJax [#2286]
    - ``astropy.utils``
      - Progress bars will now be displayed inside the IPython
        qtconsole. [#2230]
      - ``data.download_file()`` now evaluates ``REMOTE_TIMEOUT()`` at runtime
        rather than import time. Previously, setting ``REMOTE_TIMEOUT`` after
        import had no effect on the function's behavior. [#2302]
      - Progressbar will be limited to 100% so that the bar does not exceed the
        terminal width.  The numerical display can still exceed 100%, however.
    - ``astropy.vo``
      - Fixed ``format()`` compatibility with Python 2.6. [#2129]
      - Cone Search validation no longer raises ``ConeSearchError`` for positive RA.
        [#2240, #2242]
    - ``astropy.wcs``
      - Fixed a bug where calling ``astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.sub`` with
        ``WCSSUB_CELESTIAL`` may cause memory corruption due to
        underallocation of a temporary buffer. [#2350]
      - Fixed a memory allocation bug in ``astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.sub`` and
        ``astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.copy``.  [#2439]
    - Misc
      - Fixes for compatibility with Python 3.4. [#1945]
      - ``import astropy; astropy.test()`` now correctly uses the same test
        configuration as ``python setup.py test`` [#1811]
- Update to 0.3.1 (2014-03-04)
  * Bug Fixes
    - ``astropy.config``
      - Fixed a bug where ``ConfigurationItem.set_temp()`` does not reset to
        default value when exception is raised within ``with`` block. [#2117]
    - ``astropy.convolution``
      - Fixed a bug where ``_truncation`` was left undefined for ``CustomKernel``.
        [#2016]
      - Fixed a bug with ``_normalization`` when ``CustomKernel`` input array
        sums to zero. [#2016]
    - ``astropy.coordinates``
      - Fixed a bug where using ``==`` on two array coordinates wouldn't
        work. [#1832]
      - Fixed bug which caused ``len()`` not to work for coordinate objects and
        added a ``.shape`` property to get appropriately array-like behavior.
        [#1761, #2014]
      - Fixed a bug where sexagesimal notation would sometimes include
        exponential notation in the last field. [#1908, #1913]
      - ``CompositeStaticMatrixTransform`` no longer attempts to reference the
        undefined variable ``self.matrix`` during instantiation. [#1944]
      - Fixed pickling of ``Longitude``, ensuring ``wrap_angle`` is preserved
        [#1961]
      - Allow ``sep`` argument in ``Angle.to_string`` to be empty (resulting in no
        separators) [#1989]
    - ``astropy.io.ascii``
      - Allow passing unicode delimiters when reading or writing tables.  The
        delimiter must be convertible to pure ASCII.  [#1949]
      - Fix a problem when reading a table and renaming the columns to names that
        already exist. [#1991]
    - ``astropy.io.fits``
      - Ported all bug fixes from PyFITS 3.2.1.  See the PyFITS changelog at
        http://pyfits.readthedocs.org/en/v3.2.1/ [#2056]
    - ``astropy.io.misc``
      - Fixed issues in the HDF5 Table reader/writer functions that occurred on
        Windows. [#2099]
    - ``astropy.io.votable``
      - The ``write_null_values`` kwarg to ``VOTable.to_xml``, when set to `False`
        (the default) would produce non-standard VOTable files.  Therefore, this
        functionality has been replaced by a better understanding that knows which
        fields in a VOTable may be left empty (only ``char``, ``float`` and
        ``double`` in VOTable 1.1 and 1.2, and all fields in VOTable 1.3).  The
        kwarg is still accepted but it will be ignored, and a warning is emitted.
        [#1809]
      - Printing out a ``astropy.io.votable.tree.Table`` object using `repr` or
        `str` now uses the pretty formatting in ``astropy.table``, so it's possible
        to easily preview the contents of a ``VOTable``. [#1766]
    - ``astropy.modeling``
      - Fixed bug in computation of model derivatives in ``LinearLSQFitter``.
        [#1903]
      - Raise a ``NotImplementedError`` when fitting composite models. [#1915]
      - Fixed bug in the computation of the ``Gaussian2D`` model. [#2038]
      - Fixed bug in the computation of the ``AiryDisk2D`` model. [#2093]
    - ``astropy.sphinx``
      - Added slightly more useful debug info for AstropyAutosummary. [#2024]
    - ``astropy.table``
      - The column string representation for n-dimensional cells with only
        one element has been fixed. [#1522]
      - Fix a problem that caused ``MaskedColumn.__getitem__`` to not preserve
        column metadata. [#1471, #1872]
      - With Numpy prior to version 1.6.2, tables with Unicode columns now
        sort correctly. [#1867]
      - ``astropy.table`` can now print out tables with Unicode columns containing
        non-ascii characters. [#1864]
      - Columns can now be named with Unicode strings, as long as they contain only
        ascii characters.  This makes using ``astropy.table`` easier on Python 2
        when ``from __future__ import unicode_literals`` is used. [#1864]
      - Allow pickling of ``Table``, ``Column``, and ``MaskedColumn`` objects. [#792]
      - Fix a problem where it was not possible to rename columns after sorting or
        adding a row. [#2039]
    - ``astropy.time``
      - Fix a problem where scale conversion problem in TimeFromEpoch
        was not showing a useful error [#2046]
      - Fix a problem when converting to one of the formats ``unix``, ``cxcsec``,
        ``gps`` or ``plot_date`` when the time scale is ``UT1``, ``TDB`` or ``TCB``
        [#1732]
      - Ensure that ``delta_ut1_utc`` gets calculated when accessed directly,
        instead of failing and giving a rather obscure error message [#1925]
      - Fix a bug when computing the TDB to TT offset.  The transform routine was
        using meters instead of kilometers for the Earth vector.  [#1929]
      - Increase ``__array_priority__`` so that ``TimeDelta`` can convert itself
        to a ``Quantity`` also in reverse operations [#1940]
      - Correct hop list from TCG to TDB to ensure that conversion is
        possible [#2074]
    - ``astropy.units``
      - ``Quantity`` initialisation rewritten for speed [#1775]
      - Fixed minor string formatting issue for dimensionless quantities. [#1772]
      - Fix error for inplace operations on non-contiguous quantities [#1834].
      - The definition of the unit ``bar`` has been corrected to "1e5
        Pascal" from "100 Pascal" [#1910]
      - For units that are close to known units, but not quite, for
        example due to differences in case, the exception will now include
        recommendations. [#1870]
      - The generic and FITS unit parsers now accept multiple slashes in
        the unit string.  There are multiple ways to interpret them, but
        the approach taken here is to convert "m/s/kg" to "m s-1 kg-1".
        Multiple slashes are accepted, but discouraged, by the FITS
        standard, due to the ambiguity of parsing, so a warning is raised
        when it is encountered. [#1911]
      - The use of "angstrom" (with a lower case "a") is now accepted in FITS unit
        strings, since it is in common usage.  However, since it is not officially
        part of the FITS standard, a warning will be issued when it is encountered.
        [#1911]
      - Pickling unrecognized units will not raise a ``AttributeError``. [#2047]
      - ``astropy.units`` now correctly preserves the precision of
        fractional powers. [#2070]
      - If a ``Unit`` or ``Quantity`` is raised to a floating point power
        that is very close to a rational number with a denominator less
        than or equal to 10, it is converted to a ``Fraction`` object to
        preserve its precision through complex unit conversion operations.
        [#2070]
    - ``astropy.utils``
      - Fixed crash in ``timer.RunTimePredictor.do_fit``. [#1905]
      - Fixed ``astropy.utils.compat.argparse`` for Python 3.1. [#2017]
    - ``astropy.wcs``
      - ``astropy.wcs.WCS``, ``astropy.wcs.WCS.fix`` and
        ``astropy.wcs.find_all_wcs`` now have a ``translate_units`` keyword
        argument that is passed down to ``astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.fix``.  This can be
        used to specify any unsafe translations of units from rarely used ones to
        more commonly used ones.
        Although ``"S"`` is commonly used to represent seconds, its translation to
        ``"s"`` is potentially unsafe since the standard recognizes ``"S"``
        formally as Siemens, however rarely that may be used.  The same applies to
        ``"H"`` for hours (Henry), and ``"D"`` for days (Debye).
        When these sorts of changes are performed, a warning is emitted.
        [#1854]
      - When a unit is "fixed" by ``astropy.wcs.WCS.fix`` or
        ``astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.unitfix``, it now correctly reports the ``CUNIT``
        field that was changed. [#1854]
      - ``astropy.wcs.Wcs.printwcs`` will no longer warn that ``cdelt`` is being
        ignored when none was present in the FITS file. [#1845]
      - ``astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.set`` is called from within the ``astropy.wcs.WCS``
        constructor, therefore any invalid information in the keywords will be
        raised from the constructor, rather than on a subsequent call to a
        transformation method. [#1918]
      - Fix a memory corruption bug when using ``astropy.wcs.Wcs.sub`` with
        ``astropy.wcs.WCSSUB_CELESTIAL``. [#1960]
      - Fixed the ``AttributeError`` exception that was raised when using
        ``astropy.wcs.WCS.footprint_to_file``. [#1912]
      - Fixed a ``NameError`` exception that was raised when using
        ``astropy.wcs.validate`` or the ``wcslint`` script. [#2053]
      - Fixed a bug where named WCSes may be erroneously reported as ``' '`` when
        using ``astropy.wcs.validate`` or the ``wcslint`` script. [#2053]
      - Fixed a bug where error messages about incorrect header keywords
        may not be propagated correctly, resulting in a "NULL error object
        in wcslib" message. [#2106]
    - Misc
      - There are a number of improvements to make Astropy work better on big
        endian platforms, such as MIPS, PPC, s390x and SPARC. [#1849]
      - The test suite will now raise exceptions when a deprecated feature of
        Python or Numpy is used.  [#1948]
  * Other Changes and Additions
    - A new function, ``astropy.wcs.get_include``, has been added to get the
      location of the ``astropy.wcs`` C header files. [#1755]
    - The doctests in the ``.rst`` files in the ``docs`` folder are now
      tested along with the other unit tests.  This is in addition to the
      testing of doctests in docstrings that was already being performed.
      See ``docs/development/testguide.rst`` for more information. [#1771]
    - Fix a problem where import fails on Python 3 if setup.py exists
      in current directory. [#1877]
