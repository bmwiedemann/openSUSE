# This is actually revert of something upstream wanted to do a long time ago, but was waiting for the rest of pytest to sync with them.
# It is only a terminology change, but one that has personal meaning for many people. On the other hand, it was breaking compatibility with pytest < 6.
# In my opinion it would be inadequate to send this patch upstream.

%description
The `pytest-xdist`_ plugin extends py.test with some unique
test execution modes:

* test run parallelization_: if you have multiple CPUs or hosts you can use
  those for a combined test run.  This allows to speed up
  development or to use special resources of `remote machines`_.

* ``--boxed``: (not available on Windows) run each test in a boxed_
  subprocess to survive ``SEGFAULTS`` or otherwise dying processes

* ``--looponfail``: run your tests repeatedly in a subprocess.  After each run
  py.test waits until a file in your project changes and then re-runs
  the previously failing tests.  This is repeated until all tests pass
  after which again a full run is performed.

* `Multi-Platform`_ coverage: you can specify different Python interpreters
  or different platforms and run tests in parallel on all of them.

Before running tests remotely, ``py.test`` efficiently "rsyncs" your
program source code to the remote place.  All test results
are reported back and displayed to your local terminal.
You may specify different Python versions and interpreters.
