  <title>Pytest Plugin for Distributed Testing and Loop-on-Failing Modes</title>
  <description>The `pytest-xdist`_ plugin extends py.test with some unique
test execution modes:

* test run parallelization_: if you have multiple CPUs or hosts you can use
  those for a combined test run.  This allows to speed up
  development or to use special resources of `remote machines`_.

* ``--boxed``: (not available on Windows) run each test in a boxed_ 
  subprocess to survive ``SEGFAULTS`` or otherwise dying processes

* ``--looponfail``: run your tests repeatedly in a subprocess.  After each run 
  py.test waits until a file in your project changes and then re-runs
  the previously failing tests.  This is repeated until all tests pass
  after which again a full run is performed.

* `Multi-Platform`_ coverage: you can specify different Python interpreters
  or different platforms and run tests in parallel on all of them.

Before running tests remotely, ``py.test`` efficiently &quot;rsyncs&quot; your
program source code to the remote place.  All test results
are reported back and displayed to your local terminal.
You may specify different Python versions and interpreters.
