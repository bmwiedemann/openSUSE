Sun May  3 07:41:14 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- 1.32.0:
  * #524: Add testrun_uid fixture. This is a shared value that uniquely identifies a test run among all workers. This also adds a PYTEST_XDIST_TESTRUNUID environment variable that is accessible within a test as well as a command line option --testrunuid to manually set the value from outside.

Tue Jul  2 12:24:33 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.29.0:
  * #226: --max-worker-restart now assumes a more reasonable value (4 times the number of nodes) when not given explicitly. This prevents test suites from running forever when the suite crashes during collection.
  * #435: When the test session is interrupted due to running out of workers, the reason is shown in the test summary for easier viewing.
  * #442: Compatibility fix for upcoming pytest 5.0: session.exitstatus is now an IntEnum object.
  * #435: No longer show an internal error when we run out of workers due to crashes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 12:57:15 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.26.1:
  * #406: Do not implement deprecated pytest_logwarning hook in pytest versions where it is deprecated.
  * #376: The current directory is no longer added sys.path for local workers, only for remote connections.
  * #379: Warning attributes are checked to make sure they can be dumped prior to serializing the warning for submission to the master node.
  * #372: Pytest versions older than 3.6 are no longer supported.
  * #373: Node setup information is hidden when pytest is run in quiet mode to reduce noise on many-core machines.
  * #388: mainargv is made available in workerinput from the host's sys.argv.
  * #384: pytest 4.1 support: ExceptionInfo API changes.
  * #390: pytest 4.1 support: pytest_logwarning hook removed.

-  new pytest-xdist requires pytest-forked package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 11 17:25:50 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * CHANGELOG->CHANGELOG.rst
  * update pytest version requirement to 3.0.0

- update to version 1.20.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix hang when all worker nodes crash and restart limit is
      reached (#45)
    + Fix issue where the -n option would still run distributed tests
      when pytest was run with the --collect-only option (#5)

- changes from version 1.20.0:
  * Features
    + xdist now supports tests to log results multiple times,
      improving integration with plugins which require it like
      pytest-rerunfailures and flaky. (#206)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix issue where tests were being incorrectly identified if a
      worker crashed during the teardown stage of the test. (#124)

- changes from version 1.19.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix crash when transferring internal pytest warnings from
      workers to the master node. (#214)

- changes from version 1.19.0:
  * Deprecations and Removals
    + --boxed functionality has been moved to a separate plugin,
        pytest-forked. This release now depends on " pytest-forked"
        and provides --boxed as a backward compatibility option. (#1)
  * Features
    + New --dist=loadscope option: sends group of related tests to the
      same worker. Tests are grouped by module for test functions and
      by class for test methods. See README.rst for more
      information. (#191)
    + Warnings are now properly transferred from workers to the master
      node. (#92)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix serialization of native tracebacks (--tb=native). (#196)

- changes from version 1.18.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Removal of unnecessary dependency on incorrect version of
      py. (#105)
    + Fix bug in internal event-loop error handler in the master
      node. This bug would shadow the original errors making extremely
      hard/impossible for users to diagnose the problem
      properly. (#175)

- changes from version 1.18.1 :
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fixed serialization of longrepr.sections during error reporting
      from workers. (#171)
    + Fix ReprLocal not being unserialized breaking --showlocals
      usages. (#176)

- changes from version 1.18.0 :
  * pytest-xdist now requires pytest>=3.0.0.
  * Features
    + Add long option --numprocesses as alternative for -n. (#168)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix serialization and deserialization dropping longrepr
      details. (#133)

- changes from version 1.17.1 :
  * Bug Fixes
    + Hot fix release reverting the change introduced by #124,
      unfortunately it broke a number of test suites so we are
      reversing this change while we investigate the problem. (#157)
  * Improved Documentation
    + Introduced towncrier for CHANGELOG management. (#154)
    + Added HOWTORELEASE documentation. (#155)

- changes from version 1.17.0:
  * fix #124: xdist would mark test as complete after 'call' step. As
    a result, xdist could identify the wrong test as failing when test
    crashes at teardown. To address this issue, xdist now marks test
    as complete at teardown.

- changes from version 1.16.0:
  * pytest-xdist now requires pytest 2.7 or later.
  * Add worker_id attribute in the TestReport
  * new hook: pytest_xdist_make_scheduler(config, log), can return
    custom tests items distribution logic implementation. You can take
    a look at built-in LoadScheduling and EachScheduling
    implementations. Note that required scheduler class public API may
    change in next pytest-xdist versions.

    pytest #1397 issue. Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

  - fix internal error message when ``--maxfail`` is used (#62, #65).
    Thanks Collin RM Stocks and Bryan A. Jones for reports and Bruno
    Oliveira for the PR.
- exclude two tests, that fail due to too narrow requirements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 15:59:32 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.14

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 09:31:58 UTC 2015 - hpj@urpla.net

- Update to 1.13.1:
  - fix a regression -n 0 now disables xdist again

- Update to 1.13:
  - extended the tox matrix with the supported py.test versions

  - split up the plugin into 3 plugin's
    to prepare the departure of boxed and looponfail.

    looponfail will be a part of core
    and forked boxed will be replaced
    with a more reliable primitive based on xdist

  - conforming with new pytest-2.8 behavior of returning non-zero when all
    tests were skipped or deselected.

  - new "--max-slave-restart" option that can be used to control maximum
    number of times pytest-xdist can restart slaves due to crashes. Thanks to
    Anatoly Bubenkov for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

  - release as wheel

  - "-n" option now can be set to "auto" for automatic detection of number
    of cpus in the host system. Thanks Suloev Dmitry for the PR.

- Update to 1.12:
  - fix issue594: properly report errors when the test collection
    is random.  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

  - some internal test suite adaptation (to become forward
    compatible with the upcoming pytest-2.8)

- Update to 1.11:
  - fix pytest/xdist issue485 (also depends on py-1.4.22):
    attach stdout/stderr on --boxed processes that die.

  - fix pytest/xdist issue503: make sure that a node has usually
    two items to execute to avoid scoped fixtures to be torn down
    pre-maturely (fixture teardown/setup is "nextitem" sensitive).
    Thanks to Andreas Pelme for bug analysis and failing test.

  - restart crashed nodes by internally refactoring setup handling
    of nodes.  Also includes better code documentation.
    Many thanks to Floris Bruynooghe for the complete PR.
