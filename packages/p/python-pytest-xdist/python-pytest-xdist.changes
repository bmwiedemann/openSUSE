-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  6 09:35:35 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to 3.6.1
  * pytest-xdist workers now always execute the tests in the main thread.
  * Added proper handling of shouldstop and shouldfail conditions in workers.
  * Fixed compatibility issue between looponfail and editable installs.
  * Use the new main_thread_only execnet “execmodel” so that code which 
    expects to only run in the main thread will now work as expected.
  * Add backward compatibility for deadlock issue with the execnet new 
    main_thread_only “execmodel” triggered when pytest-cov accesses rinfo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 27 20:03:15 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.5.0:
  * ``--dist=loadscope`` now sorts scopes by number of tests to
    assign largest scopes early -- in many cases this should
    improve overall test session running time, as there is less
    chance of a large scope being left to be processed near the
    end of the session, leaving other workers idle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 16 21:15:05 UTC 2023 - Benoît Monin <benoit.monin@gmx.fr>

- update to 3.4.0:
  * #963: Wait for workers to finish reporting when test run stops
    early.
  * #965: Added support for Python 3.12.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 22 21:13:23 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.3.1:
  * Avoid remote calls during startup as execnet by default does
    not ensure remote affinity with the main thread and might
    accidentally schedule the pytest worker into a non-main
    thread, which breaks numerous frameworks, for example
    ``asyncio``, ``anyio``, ``PyQt/PySide``, etc.
    A more safe correction will require thread affinity in
    ``execnet``

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 14 09:36:49 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.3.0:
  * Improved progress output when collecting nodes to be less
     verbose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 21 12:32:07 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add sle15_python_module_pythons (jsc#PED-68)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 22:44:12 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Make calling of %{sle15modernpython} optional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 27 07:25:48 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.2.1:
  * Fixed hang in ``worksteal`` scheduler.
  * Improved Documentation
  * Document limitations for debugging due
    to standard I/O of workers not being forwarded. Also, mention
    remote debugging as a possible workaround.
  Features:
  * Users can now configure ``load``
    scheduling precision using ``--maxschedchunk`` command
    line option.
  * New ``worksteal`` scheduler, based on
    the idea of `work stealing
    It's similar
    to ``load`` scheduler, but it should handle tests with
    significantly differing duration better, and, at the same
    time, it should provide similar or better reuse of fixtures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 30 08:01:07 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Remove python_module macro definition
- Use autosetup instead of setup + autopatch
- Remove reintroduce-slave-terminology.patch
- Remove 0001-Revert-Remove-compat-for-pytest-6.patch
- Update to 3.0.2:
  # Bug Fixes
  * #813: Cancel shutdown when a crashed worker is restarted.

  # Deprecations
  * #825: The --rsyncdir command line argument and rsyncdirs config variable
    are deprecated.
  * The rsync feature will be removed in pytest-xdist 4.0.
  * #826: The --looponfail command line argument and looponfailroots config
    variable are deprecated.
  * The loop-on-fail feature will be removed in pytest-xdist 4.0.

  # Improved Documentation
  * #791: Document the pytest_xdist_auto_num_workers hook.
  * #796: Added known limitations section to documentation.
  * #829: Document the -n logical option.

  # Features
  * #792: The environment variable PYTEST_XDIST_AUTO_NUM_WORKERS can now be
    used to specify the default for -n auto and -n logical.
  * #812: Partially restore old initial batch distribution algorithm in
    LoadScheduling.
  * pytest orders tests for optimal sequential execution - i. e. avoiding
    unnecessary setup and teardown of fixtures. So executing tests in
    consecutive chunks is important for optimal performance.
  * In v1.14, initial test distribution in LoadScheduling was changed to
    round-robin, optimized for the corner case, when the number of tests is
    less than 2 * number of nodes. At the same time, it became worse for all
    other cases.
  * For example: if some tests use some "heavy" fixture, and these tests fit
    into the initial batch, with round-robin distribution the fixture will be
    created min(n_tests, n_workers) times, no matter how many other tests there
    are.
  * With the old algorithm (before v1.14), if there are enough tests not using
    the fixture, the fixture was created only once.
  * So restore the old behavior for typical cases where the number of tests is
    much greater than the number of workers (or, strictly speaking, when there
    are at least 2 tests for every node).

  # Removals
  * #468: The --boxed command-line option has been removed. If you still need
    this functionality, install pytest-forked separately.

  # Trivial Changes

  * #468: The py dependency has been dropped.
  * #822: Replace internal usage of py.log with a custom solution (but with the
    same interface).
  * #823: Remove usage of py._pydir as an rsync candidate.
  * #824: Replace internal usages of py.path.local by pathlib.Path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 15 18:31:01 UTC 2022 - Matthias Fehring <buschmann23@opensuse.org>

- Update to 2.5.0
  * Features
    + Full compatibility with pytest 7 - no deprecation warnings or
      use of legacy features.
    + New --dist=loadgroup option, which ensures all tests marked
      with @pytest.mark.xdist_group run in the same session/worker.
      Other tests run distributed as in --dist=load.
  * Trivial Changes
    + Use @pytest.hookspec decorator to declare hook options in
      newhooks.py to avoid warnings in pytest 7.0.
    + Use up-to-date setup.cfg/pyproject.toml packaging setup.
    + Started using type annotations and mypy checking internally.
      The types are incomplete and not published.
- Changes from 2.4.0
  * Features
    + On Linux, the process title now changes to indicate the current
      worker state (running/idle). Depends on the setproctitle package,
      which can be installed with pip install pytest-xdist[setproctitle].
    + Add support for Python 3.10.
- Changes from 2.3.0
  * Deprecations and Removals
    + Python 3.5 is no longer supported.
  * Features
    + Add --numprocesses=logical flag, which automatically uses the
      number of logical CPUs available, instead of physical CPUs
      with auto. This is very useful for test suites which are not
      CPU-bound.
    + Added new pytest_handlecrashitem hook to allow handling and
      rescheduling crashed items.
  * Bug Fixes
    + Copy the parent process sys.path into local workers, to work
      around execnet's python -c adding the current directory to sys.path.
    + Fix issue caused by changing the branch name of the pytest repository.
  * Trivial Changes
    + Replace master with controller where ever possible.
    + Use 'main' to refer to pytest default branch in tox env names.
- Update patches
  * reintroduce-slave-terminology.patch
  * 0001-Revert-Remove-compat-for-pytest-6.patch
- Require setuptools_scm >= 6.0 for building

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  2 09:53:19 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.2.0:
  * Internal errors in workers are now propagated to the master node.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 13 11:46:40 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Skip test failing with the new pytest

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 31 13:01:20 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.1.0
  * New ``pytest_xdist_auto_num_workers`` hook can be implemented by plugins
    or ``conftest.py`` files to control the number of workers when
    ``--numprocesses=auto`` is given in the command-line.
  * ``psutil`` has proven to make ``pytest-xdist`` installation in certain
    platforms and containers problematic, so to use it for automatic number
    of CPUs detection users need to install the ``psutil`` extra
- Add patches to keep compatibility with older pytests:
  * reintroduce-slave-terminology.patch
  * 0001-Revert-Remove-compat-for-pytest-6.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 25 08:12:22 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 2.0.0
  * Drop backward-compatibility "slave" aliases related to worker nodes.  We deliberately
    moved away from this terminology years ago, and it seems like the right time to finish
    the deprecation and removal process.
  * ``pytest-xdist`` no longer supports Python 2.7.
  * New functions ``xdist.is_xdist_worker``, ``xdist.is_xdist_master``, ``xdist.get_xdist_worker_id``,
    to easily identify the current node.
  * When using ``-n auto``, count the number of physical CPU cores instead of logical ones.
  * ``pytest-xdist`` now requires ``pytest>=6.0``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 13 09:10:04 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Do not do symlinks

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  3 07:41:14 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- 1.32.0:
  * #524: Add testrun_uid fixture. This is a shared value that uniquely identifies a test run among all workers. This also adds a PYTEST_XDIST_TESTRUNUID environment variable that is accessible within a test as well as a command line option --testrunuid to manually set the value from outside.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  6 12:50:36 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.31.0:
  * #486: Add support for Python 3.8.
  * #491: Fix regression that caused custom plugin command-line
    arguments to be discarded when using --tx mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  7 13:00:36 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.30.0:
  * Fix crash issues related to running xdist with the terminal plugin disabled
  * Initialization between workers and master nodes is now more consistent

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  2 12:24:33 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.29.0:
  * #226: --max-worker-restart now assumes a more reasonable value (4 times the number of nodes) when not given explicitly. This prevents test suites from running forever when the suite crashes during collection.
  * #435: When the test session is interrupted due to running out of workers, the reason is shown in the test summary for easier viewing.
  * #442: Compatibility fix for upcoming pytest 5.0: session.exitstatus is now an IntEnum object.
  * #435: No longer show an internal error when we run out of workers due to crashes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  3 08:49:46 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.28.0:
  * #426: pytest-xdist now uses the new pytest_report_to_serializable and
    pytest_report_from_serializable hooks from pytest 4.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 21 09:54:59 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.27.0:
  * #374: The new ``pytest_xdist_getremotemodule`` hook allows overriding the module run on remote nodes.
  * #415: Improve behavior of ``--numprocesses=auto`` to work well with ``--pdb`` option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 12:57:15 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.26.1:
  * #406: Do not implement deprecated pytest_logwarning hook in pytest versions where it is deprecated.
  * #376: The current directory is no longer added sys.path for local workers, only for remote connections.
  * #379: Warning attributes are checked to make sure they can be dumped prior to serializing the warning for submission to the master node.
  * #372: Pytest versions older than 3.6 are no longer supported.
  * #373: Node setup information is hidden when pytest is run in quiet mode to reduce noise on many-core machines.
  * #388: mainargv is made available in workerinput from the host's sys.argv.
  * #384: pytest 4.1 support: ExceptionInfo API changes.
  * #390: pytest 4.1 support: pytest_logwarning hook removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 26 12:56:22 UTC 2018 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to version 1.23.2
- add python-six to runtime deps
  * Fix issue where Warnings could cause pytest to fail if they
     do not set the args attribute correctly.
  * Fix warnings transfer between workers and master node with pytest >= 3.8
  * Improve collection performance by reducing the number of events
     sent to master node

Sat Feb 24 18:29:53 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 1.22.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix issue when using loadscope or loadfile where tests would
      fail to start if the first scope had only one test. (#257)
  * Trivial Changes
    + Change terminology used by pytest-xdist to master and worker in
      arguments and messages (for example --max-worker-reset). (#234)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 11 23:58:44 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 1.22.0:
  * Add support for the pytest_runtest_logfinish hook which will be
    released in pytest 3.4. (#266)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  3 23:12:36 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 1.21.0:
  * Deprecations and Removals
    + Drop support for EOL Python 2.6. (#259)
  * Features
    + New --dist=loadfile option which load-distributes test to
      workers grouped by the file the tests live in. (#242)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix accidental mutation of test report during serialization
      causing longrepr string-ification to break. (#241)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-  new pytest-xdist requires pytest-forked package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 11 17:25:50 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * CHANGELOG->CHANGELOG.rst
  * update pytest version requirement to 3.0.0

- update to version 1.20.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix hang when all worker nodes crash and restart limit is
      reached (#45)
    + Fix issue where the -n option would still run distributed tests
      when pytest was run with the --collect-only option (#5)

- changes from version 1.20.0:
  * Features
    + xdist now supports tests to log results multiple times,
      improving integration with plugins which require it like
      pytest-rerunfailures and flaky. (#206)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix issue where tests were being incorrectly identified if a
      worker crashed during the teardown stage of the test. (#124)

- changes from version 1.19.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix crash when transferring internal pytest warnings from
      workers to the master node. (#214)

- changes from version 1.19.0:
  * Deprecations and Removals
    + --boxed functionality has been moved to a separate plugin,
        pytest-forked. This release now depends on " pytest-forked"
        and provides --boxed as a backward compatibility option. (#1)
  * Features
    + New --dist=loadscope option: sends group of related tests to the
      same worker. Tests are grouped by module for test functions and
      by class for test methods. See README.rst for more
      information. (#191)
    + Warnings are now properly transferred from workers to the master
      node. (#92)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix serialization of native tracebacks (--tb=native). (#196)

- changes from version 1.18.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    + Removal of unnecessary dependency on incorrect version of
      py. (#105)
    + Fix bug in internal event-loop error handler in the master
      node. This bug would shadow the original errors making extremely
      hard/impossible for users to diagnose the problem
      properly. (#175)

- changes from version 1.18.1 :
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fixed serialization of longrepr.sections during error reporting
      from workers. (#171)
    + Fix ReprLocal not being unserialized breaking --showlocals
      usages. (#176)

- changes from version 1.18.0 :
  * pytest-xdist now requires pytest>=3.0.0.
  * Features
    + Add long option --numprocesses as alternative for -n. (#168)
  * Bug Fixes
    + Fix serialization and deserialization dropping longrepr
      details. (#133)

- changes from version 1.17.1 :
  * Bug Fixes
    + Hot fix release reverting the change introduced by #124,
      unfortunately it broke a number of test suites so we are
      reversing this change while we investigate the problem. (#157)
  * Improved Documentation
    + Introduced towncrier for CHANGELOG management. (#154)
    + Added HOWTORELEASE documentation. (#155)

- changes from version 1.17.0:
  * fix #124: xdist would mark test as complete after 'call' step. As
    a result, xdist could identify the wrong test as failing when test
    crashes at teardown. To address this issue, xdist now marks test
    as complete at teardown.

- changes from version 1.16.0:
  * pytest-xdist now requires pytest 2.7 or later.
  * Add worker_id attribute in the TestReport
  * new hook: pytest_xdist_make_scheduler(config, log), can return
    custom tests items distribution logic implementation. You can take
    a look at built-in LoadScheduling and EachScheduling
    implementations. Note that required scheduler class public API may
    change in next pytest-xdist versions.

    Thanks Collin RM Stocks and Bryan A. Jones for reports and Bruno
    Oliveira for the PR.
- exclude two tests, that fail due to too narrow requirements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 15:59:32 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.13.1:
  - fix a regression -n 0 now disables xdist again

- Update to 1.13:
  - extended the tox matrix with the supported py.test versions

  - split up the plugin into 3 plugin's
    to prepare the departure of boxed and looponfail.

    looponfail will be a part of core
    and forked boxed will be replaced
    with a more reliable primitive based on xdist

  - conforming with new pytest-2.8 behavior of returning non-zero when all
    tests were skipped or deselected.

  - new "--max-slave-restart" option that can be used to control maximum
    number of times pytest-xdist can restart slaves due to crashes. Thanks to
    Anatoly Bubenkov for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

  - release as wheel

  - "-n" option now can be set to "auto" for automatic detection of number
    of cpus in the host system. Thanks Suloev Dmitry for the PR.

- Update to 1.12:
  - fix issue594: properly report errors when the test collection
    is random.  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

  - some internal test suite adaptation (to become forward
    compatible with the upcoming pytest-2.8)

- Update to 1.11:
  - fix pytest/xdist issue485 (also depends on py-1.4.22):
    attach stdout/stderr on --boxed processes that die.

  - fix pytest/xdist issue503: make sure that a node has usually
    two items to execute to avoid scoped fixtures to be torn down
    pre-maturely (fixture teardown/setup is "nextitem" sensitive).
    Thanks to Andreas Pelme for bug analysis and failing test.

  - restart crashed nodes by internally refactoring setup handling
    of nodes.  Also includes better code documentation.
    Many thanks to Floris Bruynooghe for the complete PR.
