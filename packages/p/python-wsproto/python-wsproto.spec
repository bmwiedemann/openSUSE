%description
This module contains a pure-Python implementation of a WebSocket
protocol stack. It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in
whatever program you choose to use, ensuring that you can
communicate via WebSockets, as defined in RFC6455
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455>, regardless of your
programming paradigm.

This module does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or
any rules about concurrency. Instead, it's a purely in-memory
solution, defined in terms of data actions and WebSocket frames.
RFC6455 and Compression Extensions for WebSocket via RFC7692
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692> are fully supported.
