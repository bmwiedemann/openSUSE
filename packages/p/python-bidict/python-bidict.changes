- Remove unused build dependencies
- Add export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
- Add docs/*.rst to %doc
- Update to v0.18.0
  + Rename BidirectionalMapping.inv to BidirectionalMapping.inverse
    and make BidictBase.inv an alias.
  + BidirectionalMapping.__subclasshook__ now requires an ``inverse``
    attribute rather than an inv attribute for a class to qualify as a
    virtual subclass.
    This breaking change is expected to affect few if any users.
  + Add Python 2/3-compatible compat.collections_abc alias.
  + Drop support for Python 3.4
- from v0.17.5
  + Remove the ``__delegate__`` instance attribute added in the previous release.
    Instead of checking ``self.__delegate__`` and delegating accordingly
    each time a possibly-delegating method is called,
    revert back to using "delegated-to-fwdm" mixin classes
    now found in bidict._delegating_mixins, and resurrect a mutable bidict
    parent class that omits the mixins
  + Rename __repr_delegate__ to BidictBase._repr_delegate
- Update to v0.17.4
  + `~bidict.OrderedBidict` optimizations and code improvements.
  + Refactor proxied- (i.e. delegated-) to-_fwdm logic
    for better composability and interoperability.
  + Change ``__repr_delegate__`` to simply take a type like dict or list
  + Upgrade to latest major release of sortedcontainers
  + bidict.compat.{view,iter}{keys,values,items} on Python 2
    no longer assumes the target object implements these methods,
    as they're not actually part of the collections.abc.Mapping interface,
    and provides fallback implementations when the methods are unavailable.
- Update to v0.17.3
  + Improve packaging by adding a pyproject.toml
  + Drop pytest-runner and support for running tests via setup.py test

- Update to version 0.17.2
  + Speedups and memory usage improvements
    - Use less memory in the linked lists that back
      :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidict`\s
      by storing node data unpacked
      rather than in (key, value) tuple objects.
- Update to version 0.17.1
  + Bugfix Release
    - Fix a regression in 0.17.0 that could cause erroneous behavior
      when updating items of an :class:`~bidict.Orderedbidict`'s inverse,
      e.g. ``some_ordered_bidict.inv[foo] = bar``.
- Update to version 0.17.0
  + Speedups and memory usage improvements
    - Pass
      :meth:`~bidict.bidict.keys`,
      :meth:`~bidict.bidict.values`, and
      :meth:`~bidict.bidict.items` calls
      (as well as their ``iter*`` and ``view*`` counterparts on Python 2)
      through to the backing ``_fwdm`` and ``_invm`` dicts
      so that they run as fast as possible
      (i.e. at C speed on CPython),
      rather than using the slower implementations
      inherited from :class:`collections.abc.Mapping`.
    - Use weakrefs in the linked lists that back
      :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidict`\s
      to avoid creating strong reference cycles.
  + Misc
    - Add :attr:`bidict.__version_info__` attribute
      to complement :attr:`bidict.__version__`.
- Update to version 0.16.0
  + Speedups and memory usage improvements
    - Minor code and efficiency improvements to
      :func:`~bidict.inverted` and
      :func:`~bidict._util._iteritems_args_kw`
      (formerly ``bidict.pairs()``).
  + Minor Breaking API Changes
    - Rename ``bidict.pairs()`` → :func:`bidict._util._iteritems_args_kw`.
- Update to version 0.15.0
  + Speedups and memory usage improvements
    - Use :ref:`slots` to speed up bidict attribute access and reduce memory usage.
      On Python 3,
      instantiating a large number of bidicts now uses ~57% the amount of memory
      that it used before,
      and on Python 2 only ~33% the amount of memory that it used before,
      in a simple but representative
      `benchmark <https://github.com/jab/bidict/pull/56#issuecomment-368203591>`__.
    - Use weakrefs to refer to a bidict's inverse internally,
      no longer creating a strong reference cycle.
      Memory for a bidict that you create can now be reclaimed
      in CPython as soon as you no longer hold any references to it,
      rather than having to wait for the next garbage collection.
      See the new
      :ref:`addendum:\:attr\:\`~bidict.BidictBase.inv\` Avoids Reference Cycles`
      documentation.
      Fixes `#24 <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/20>`__.
    - Make :func:`bidict.BidictBase.__eq__` significantly
      more speed- and memory-efficient when comparing to
      a non-:class:`dict` :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`.
      (``Mapping.__eq__()``\'s inefficient implementation will now never be used.)
      The implementation is now more reusable as well.
    - Make :func:`bidict.OrderedBidictBase.__iter__` as well as
      equality comparison slightly faster for ordered bidicts.
  + Minor Bugfixes
    - :func:`~bidict.namedbidict` now verifies that the provided
      ``keyname`` and ``valname`` are distinct,
      raising :class:`ValueError` if they are equal.
    - :func:`~bidict.namedbidict` now raises :class:`TypeError`
      if the provided ``base_type``
      is not a :class:`~bidict.BidirectionalMapping`.
    - If you create a custom bidict subclass whose ``_fwdm_cls``
      differs from its ``_invm_cls``
      (as in the ``FwdKeySortedBidict`` example
      from the :ref:`extending:Sorted Bidict Recipes`),
      the inverse bidirectional mapping type
      (with ``_fwdm_cls`` and ``_invm_cls`` swapped)
      is now correctly computed and used automatically
      for your custom bidict's
      :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.inv` bidict.
  + Miscellaneous
    - Classes no longer have to provide an ``__inverted__``
      attribute to be considered virtual subclasses of
      :class:`~bidict.BidirectionalMapping`.
    - If :func:`bidict.inverted` is passed
      an object with an ``__inverted__`` attribute,
      it now ensures it is :func:`callable`
      before returning the result of calling it.
    - :func:`~bidict.BidictBase.__repr__` no longer checks for a ``__reversed__``
      method to determine whether to use an ordered or unordered-style repr.
      It now calls the new :func:`~bidict.BidictBase.__repr_delegate__` instead
      (which may be overridden if needed), for better composability.
  + Minor Breaking API Changes
    - Split back out the :class:`~bidict.BidictBase` class
      from :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict`
      and :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase`
      from :class:`~bidict.FrozenOrderedBidict`,
      reverting the merging of these in 0.14.0.
      Having e.g. ``issubclass(bidict, frozenbidict) == True`` was confusing,
      so this change restores ``issubclass(bidict, frozenbidict) == False``.
    - Rename:
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.fwdm`` → ``._fwdm``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.invm`` → ``._invm``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.fwd_cls`` → ``._fwdm_cls``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.inv_cls`` → ``._invm_cls``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.isinv`` → ``._isinv``
      Though overriding ``_fwdm_cls`` and ``_invm_cls`` remains supported
      (see :doc:`extending`),
      this is not a common enough use case to warrant public names.
      Most users do not need to know or care about any of these.
    - The :attr:`~bidict.RAISE`,
      :attr:`~bidict.OVERWRITE`, and
      :attr:`~bidict.IGNORE`
      duplication policies are no longer available as attributes of
      :class:`bidict.DuplicationPolicy`,
      and can now only be accessed as attributes of
      the :mod:`bidict` module namespace,
      which was the canonical way to refer to them anyway.
      It is now no longer possible to create an infinite chain like
      ``DuplicationPolicy.RAISE.RAISE.RAISE...``
    - Make ``bidict.pairs()`` and :func:`bidict.inverted`
      no longer importable from ``bidict.util``,
      and now only importable from the top-level :mod:`bidict` module.
      (``bidict.util`` was renamed ``bidict._util``.)
    - Pickling ordered bidicts now requires
      at least version 2 of the pickle protocol.
      If you are using Python 3,
      :attr:`pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` is 3 anyway,
      so this will not affect you.
      However if you are using in Python 2,
      :attr:`~pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` is 0,
      so you must now explicitly specify the version
      in your :func:`pickle.dumps` calls,
      e.g. ``pickle.dumps(ob, 2)``.
- Update to version 0.14.2
    - Make initializing (or updating an empty bidict) from only another
      :class:`~bidict.BidirectionalMapping`
      more efficient by skipping unnecessary duplication checking.
    - Fix accidental ignoring of specified ``base_type`` argument
      when (un)pickling a :func:`~bidict.namedbidict`.
    - Fix incorrect inversion of
      ``some_named_bidict.inv.<fwdname>_for`` and
      ``some_named_bidict.inv.<invname>_for``.
    - Only warn when an unsupported Python version is detected
      (e.g. Python < 2.7) rather than raising :class:`AssertionError`.
- Update to version 0.14.1
    - Fix a bug introduced in 0.14.0 where hashing a
      :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict`\’s inverse
      (e.g. ``f = frozenbidict(); {f.inv: '...'}``)
      would cause an ``AttributeError``.
    - Fix a bug introduced in 0.14.0 for Python 2 users
      where attempting to call ``viewitems()``
      would cause a ``TypeError``.
      Thanks Richard Sanger for
      `reporting <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/48>`__.
- Update to version 0.14.0 (2017-11-20)
    - Fix a bug where :class:`~bidict.bidict`\’s
      default *on_dup_kv* policy was set to :attr:`~bidict.RAISE`,
      rather than matching whatever *on_dup_val* policy was in effect
      as was :ref:`documented <basic-usage:Key and Value Duplication>`.
    - Fix a bug that could happen when using Python's optimization (``-O``) flag
      that could leave an ordered bidict in an inconsistent state
      when dealing with duplicated, overwritten keys or values.
      If you do not use optimizations
      (specifically, skipping ``assert`` statements),
      this would not have affected you.
    - Fix a bug introduced by the optimizations in 0.13.0 that could cause
      a frozen bidict that compared equal to another mapping
      to have a different hash value from the other mapping,
      violating Python's object model.
      This would only have affected you if you were inserting a
      frozen bidict and some other immutable mapping that it compared equal to
      into the same set or mapping.
    - Add :meth:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase.equals_order_sensitive`.
    - Reduce the memory usage of ordered bidicts.
    - Make copying of ordered bidicts faster.
    - Improvements to tests and CI, including:
      > Test on Windows
      > Test with PyPy3
      > Test with CPython 3.7-dev
      > Test with optimization flags
      > Require pylint to pass
  + Breaking API Changes
    - Rename:
      > ``orderedbidict`` → :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidict`
      > ``frozenorderedbidict`` → :class:`~bidict.FrozenOrderedBidict`
      so that these now match the case of :class:`collections.OrderedDict`.
    - The names of the
      :class:`~bidict.bidict`,
      :func:`~bidict.namedbidict`, and
      :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict` classes
      have been retained as all-lowercase
      so that they continue to match the case of
      :class:`dict`, :func:`~collections.namedtuple`, and
      :class:`frozenset`, respectively.
    - The ``ON_DUP_VAL`` duplication policy value for *on_dup_kv* has been removed.
      Use ``None`` instead.
    - Merge :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict` and ``BidictBase``
      together and remove ``BidictBase``.
      :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict`
      is now the concrete base class that all other bidict types derive from.
      See the updated :ref:`other-bidict-types:Bidict Types Diagram`.
    - Merge :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict` and ``FrozenBidictBase``
      together and remove ``FrozenBidictBase``.
      See the updated :ref:`other-bidict-types:Bidict Types Diagram`.
    - Merge ``frozenorderedbidict`` and ``OrderedBidictBase`` together
      into a single :class:`~bidict.FrozenOrderedBidict`
      class and remove ``OrderedBidictBase``.
      :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidict` now extends
      :class:`~bidict.FrozenOrderedBidict`
      to add mutable behavior.
      See the updated :ref:`other-bidict-types:Bidict Types Diagram`.
    - Make :meth:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase.__eq__`
      always perform an order-insensitive equality test,
      even if the other mapping is ordered.
      Previously,
      :meth:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase.__eq__`
      was only order-sensitive for other ``OrderedBidictBase`` subclasses,
      and order-insensitive otherwise.
      Use the new :meth:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase.equals_order_sensitive`
      method for order-sensitive equality comparison.
    - ``orderedbidict._should_compare_order_sensitive()`` has been removed.
    - ``frozenorderedbidict._HASH_NITEMS_MAX`` has been removed.
      Since its hash value must be computed from all contained items
      (so that hash results are consistent with
      equality comparisons against unordered mappings),
      the number of items that influence the hash value should not be limitable.
    - ``frozenbidict._USE_ITEMSVIEW_HASH`` has been removed, and
      ``frozenbidict.compute_hash()``
      now uses ``collections.ItemsView._hash()`` to compute the hash always,
      not just when running on PyPy.
      Override ``frozenbidict.compute_hash()``
      to return ``hash(frozenset(iteritems(self)))``
      if you prefer the old default behavior on CPython,
      which takes linear rather than constant space,
      but which uses the ``frozenset_hash`` routine
      (implemented in ``setobject.c``)
      rather than the pure Python ``ItemsView._hash()`` routine.
    - ``loosebidict`` and ``looseorderedbidict`` have been removed.
      A simple recipe to implement equivalents yourself is now given in
      :ref:`extending:OverwritingBidict Recipe`.
    - Rename ``FrozenBidictBase._compute_hash()`` →
      ``frozenbidict.compute_hash()``.
    - Rename ``DuplicationBehavior`` →
      :class:`~bidict.DuplicationPolicy`.
    - Rename:
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._fwd_class`` → ``.fwd_cls``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._inv_class`` → ``.inv_cls``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._on_dup_key`` → :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.on_dup_key`
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._on_dup_val`` → :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.on_dup_val`
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._on_dup_kv`` → :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.on_dup_kv`
