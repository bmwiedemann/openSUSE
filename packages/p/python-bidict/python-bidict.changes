Fri Feb 10 10:31:11 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.22.1:
  * Only include the source code in the source distribution. This
    reduces the size of the source distribution from ~200kB to ~30kB.
  * Fix the return type hint of bidict.inverted() to return an
    Iterator, rather than an Iterable

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 24 10:33:36 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.22.0:
 - Drop support for Python 3.6, which reached end of life on 2021-12-23
   and is no longer supported by pip as of pip version 22.
   Take advantage of this to reduce bidict's maintenance costs.
 - Use mypy-appeasing explicit re-exports in ``__init__.py``
   (e.g. ``import x as x``)
   so that mypy no longer gives you an implicit re-export error
   if you run it with ``--no-implicit-reexport`` (or ``--strict``)
   against code that imports from :mod:`bidict`.
 - Update the implementations and type annotations of
   :meth:`bidict.BidictBase.keys` and
   :meth:`bidict.BidictBase.values` to make use of the new
   :class:`~bidict.BidictKeysView` type,
   which works a bit better with type checkers.
 - Inverse bidict instances are now computed lazily the first time
   the :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.inverse` attribute is accessed
   rather than being computed eagerly during initialization.
   (A bidict's backing, inverse, one-way mapping
   is still kept in sync eagerly as any mutations are made,
   to preserve key- and value-uniqueness.)
 - Optimize initializing a bidict with another bidict.
   In a microbenchmark on Python 3.10,
   this now performs over **2x faster**.
 - Optimize updating an empty bidict with another bidict.
   In a microbenchmark on Python 3.10,
   this now performs **60-75% faster**.
 - Optimize :meth:`~bidict.BidictBase.copy`.
   In a microbenchmark on Python 3.10,
   this now performs **10-20x faster**.
 - Optimize rolling back
   :ref:`failed updates to a bidict <basic-usage:Updates Fail Clean>`
   in the case that the number of items passed to the update call
   can be determined to be larger than the bidict being updated.
   Previously this rollback was O(n) in the number of items passed.
   Now it is O(1), i.e. **unboundedly faster**.
 - Optimize :meth:`bidict.BidictBase.__contains__`
   (the method called when you run ``key in mybidict``).
   In a microbenchmark on Python 3.10,
   this now performs over **3-10x faster** in the False case,
   and at least **50% faster** in the True case.
 - Optimize :meth:`bidict.BidictBase.__eq__`
   (the method called when you run ``mybidict == other``).
   In a microbenchmark on Python 3.10,
   this now performs **15-25x faster** for ordered bidicts,
   and **7-12x faster** for unordered bidicts.
 - Optimize :meth:`~bidict.BidictBase.equals_order_sensitive`.
   In a microbenchmark on Python 3.10,
   this now performs **2x faster** for ordered bidicts
   and **60-90% faster** for unordered bidicts.
 - Optimize the
   :class:`~collections.abc.MappingView` objects returned by
   :meth:`bidict.OrderedBidict.keys`,
   :meth:`bidict.OrderedBidict.values`, and
   :meth:`bidict.OrderedBidict.items`
   to delegate to backing ``dict_keys`` and ``dict_items``
   objects if available, which are much faster in CPython.
   For example, in a microbenchmark on Python 3.10,
   ``orderedbi.items() == d.items()``
   now performs **30-50x faster**.
 - Fix a bug where
   :meth:`bidict.BidictBase.__eq__` was always returning False
   rather than :obj:`NotImplemented`
   in the case that the argument was not a
   :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`,
   defeating the argument's own ``__eq__()`` if implemented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  5 18:06:07 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.21.3
  * All bidicts now provide the equals_order_sensitive() method,
    not just bidict.OrderedBidicts.
  * Since support for Python < 3.6 was dropped in v0.21.0,
    non-Ordered bidicts preserve a deterministic ordering on all
    supported Python versions, so all bidicts can now provide
    equals_order_sensitive().
  * Take better advantage of the fact that dicts are reversible
    in Python 3.8+. This allows even non-Ordered bidicts to
    efficiently provide a __reversed__() implementation, which
    they now do. As a result, if you are using Python 3.8+,
    frozenbidict now gives you everything that
    FrozenOrderedBidict gives you with less space overhead.
  * Drop setuptools_scm as a setup_requires dependency.
  * Remove the bidict.__version_info__ attribute.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 26 07:30:55 UTC 2021 - Axel Braun <axel.braun@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.21.2
  * Include `py.typed <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/#packaging-type-information>`__
    file to mark :mod:`bidict` as type hinted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  1 04:48:00 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.21.0:
  * bidict now provides type hints
  * Add bidict.MutableBidirectionalMapping ABC
  * Drop Python 3.5 support
  * Remove bidict.compat module
  * Remove APIs deprecated in previous releases 
- Drop dont-limit-versions.patch, included upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 18 18:56:46 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add dont-limit-versions.patch … don't limit the upper
  version of setuptools_scm to be used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 17 16:50:46 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 0.19.0
  * Drop support for Python 2 as promised in v0.18.2.
  * Deprecate bidict.OVERWRITE and bidict.IGNORE. A UserWarning will now be emitted if these are used.
  * Rename DuplicationPolicy to OnDupAction (and implement it via an Enum).
  * No longer use __all__ in bidict’s __init__.py.
  * Improve validation of names passed to namedbidict().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 13 11:22:42 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.18.2:
  * Warn that Python 2 support will be dropped in a future release when Python 2 is detected.
  * Fix a regression introduced by the memory optimizations added in 0.15.0 which caused deepcopied and unpickled bidicts to have their inverses set incorrectly. #94

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 10 11:49:33 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Remove unused build dependencies
- Add export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
- Add docs/*.rst to %doc
- Update to v0.18.0
  + Rename BidirectionalMapping.inv to BidirectionalMapping.inverse
    and make BidictBase.inv an alias.
  + BidirectionalMapping.__subclasshook__ now requires an ``inverse``
    attribute rather than an inv attribute for a class to qualify as a
    virtual subclass.
    This breaking change is expected to affect few if any users.
  + Add Python 2/3-compatible compat.collections_abc alias.
  + Drop support for Python 3.4
- from v0.17.5
  + Remove the ``__delegate__`` instance attribute added in the previous release.
    Instead of checking ``self.__delegate__`` and delegating accordingly
    each time a possibly-delegating method is called,
    revert back to using "delegated-to-fwdm" mixin classes
    now found in bidict._delegating_mixins, and resurrect a mutable bidict
    parent class that omits the mixins
  + Rename __repr_delegate__ to BidictBase._repr_delegate
- Update to v0.17.4
  + `~bidict.OrderedBidict` optimizations and code improvements.
  + Refactor proxied- (i.e. delegated-) to-_fwdm logic
    for better composability and interoperability.
  + Change ``__repr_delegate__`` to simply take a type like dict or list
  + Upgrade to latest major release of sortedcontainers
  + bidict.compat.{view,iter}{keys,values,items} on Python 2
    no longer assumes the target object implements these methods,
    as they're not actually part of the collections.abc.Mapping interface,
    and provides fallback implementations when the methods are unavailable.
- Update to v0.17.3
  + Improve packaging by adding a pyproject.toml
  + Drop pytest-runner and support for running tests via setup.py test

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  4 12:46:05 UTC 2018 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Remove superfluous devel dependency for noarch package

Wed May  9 03:36:16 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.17.2
  + Speedups and memory usage improvements
    - Use less memory in the linked lists that back
      :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidict`\s
      by storing node data unpacked
      rather than in (key, value) tuple objects.
- Update to version 0.17.1
  + Bugfix Release
    - Fix a regression in 0.17.0 that could cause erroneous behavior
      when updating items of an :class:`~bidict.Orderedbidict`'s inverse,
      e.g. ``some_ordered_bidict.inv[foo] = bar``.
- Update to version 0.17.0
  + Speedups and memory usage improvements
    - Pass
      :meth:`~bidict.bidict.keys`,
      :meth:`~bidict.bidict.values`, and
      :meth:`~bidict.bidict.items` calls
      (as well as their ``iter*`` and ``view*`` counterparts on Python 2)
      through to the backing ``_fwdm`` and ``_invm`` dicts
      so that they run as fast as possible
      (i.e. at C speed on CPython),
      rather than using the slower implementations
      inherited from :class:`collections.abc.Mapping`.
    - Use weakrefs in the linked lists that back
      :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidict`\s
      to avoid creating strong reference cycles.
  + Misc
    - Add :attr:`bidict.__version_info__` attribute
      to complement :attr:`bidict.__version__`.
- Update to version 0.16.0
  + Speedups and memory usage improvements
    - Minor code and efficiency improvements to
      :func:`~bidict.inverted` and
      :func:`~bidict._util._iteritems_args_kw`
      (formerly ``bidict.pairs()``).
  + Minor Breaking API Changes
    - Rename ``bidict.pairs()`` → :func:`bidict._util._iteritems_args_kw`.
- Update to version 0.15.0
  + Speedups and memory usage improvements
    - Use :ref:`slots` to speed up bidict attribute access and reduce memory usage.
      On Python 3,
      instantiating a large number of bidicts now uses ~57% the amount of memory
      that it used before,
      and on Python 2 only ~33% the amount of memory that it used before,
      in a simple but representative
      `benchmark <https://github.com/jab/bidict/pull/56#issuecomment-368203591>`__.
    - Use weakrefs to refer to a bidict's inverse internally,
      no longer creating a strong reference cycle.
      Memory for a bidict that you create can now be reclaimed
      in CPython as soon as you no longer hold any references to it,
      rather than having to wait for the next garbage collection.
      See the new
      :ref:`addendum:\:attr\:\`~bidict.BidictBase.inv\` Avoids Reference Cycles`
      documentation.
      Fixes `#24 <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/20>`__.
    - Make :func:`bidict.BidictBase.__eq__` significantly
      more speed- and memory-efficient when comparing to
      a non-:class:`dict` :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`.
      (``Mapping.__eq__()``\'s inefficient implementation will now never be used.)
      The implementation is now more reusable as well.
    - Make :func:`bidict.OrderedBidictBase.__iter__` as well as
      equality comparison slightly faster for ordered bidicts.
  + Minor Bugfixes
    - :func:`~bidict.namedbidict` now verifies that the provided
      ``keyname`` and ``valname`` are distinct,
      raising :class:`ValueError` if they are equal.
    - :func:`~bidict.namedbidict` now raises :class:`TypeError`
      if the provided ``base_type``
      is not a :class:`~bidict.BidirectionalMapping`.
    - If you create a custom bidict subclass whose ``_fwdm_cls``
      differs from its ``_invm_cls``
      (as in the ``FwdKeySortedBidict`` example
      from the :ref:`extending:Sorted Bidict Recipes`),
      the inverse bidirectional mapping type
      (with ``_fwdm_cls`` and ``_invm_cls`` swapped)
      is now correctly computed and used automatically
      for your custom bidict's
      :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.inv` bidict.
  + Miscellaneous
    - Classes no longer have to provide an ``__inverted__``
      attribute to be considered virtual subclasses of
      :class:`~bidict.BidirectionalMapping`.
    - If :func:`bidict.inverted` is passed
      an object with an ``__inverted__`` attribute,
      it now ensures it is :func:`callable`
      before returning the result of calling it.
    - :func:`~bidict.BidictBase.__repr__` no longer checks for a ``__reversed__``
      method to determine whether to use an ordered or unordered-style repr.
      It now calls the new :func:`~bidict.BidictBase.__repr_delegate__` instead
      (which may be overridden if needed), for better composability.
  + Minor Breaking API Changes
    - Split back out the :class:`~bidict.BidictBase` class
      from :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict`
      and :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase`
      from :class:`~bidict.FrozenOrderedBidict`,
      reverting the merging of these in 0.14.0.
      Having e.g. ``issubclass(bidict, frozenbidict) == True`` was confusing,
      so this change restores ``issubclass(bidict, frozenbidict) == False``.
    - Rename:
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.fwdm`` → ``._fwdm``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.invm`` → ``._invm``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.fwd_cls`` → ``._fwdm_cls``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.inv_cls`` → ``._invm_cls``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase.isinv`` → ``._isinv``
      Though overriding ``_fwdm_cls`` and ``_invm_cls`` remains supported
      (see :doc:`extending`),
      this is not a common enough use case to warrant public names.
      Most users do not need to know or care about any of these.
    - The :attr:`~bidict.RAISE`,
      :attr:`~bidict.OVERWRITE`, and
      :attr:`~bidict.IGNORE`
      duplication policies are no longer available as attributes of
      :class:`bidict.DuplicationPolicy`,
      and can now only be accessed as attributes of
      the :mod:`bidict` module namespace,
      which was the canonical way to refer to them anyway.
      It is now no longer possible to create an infinite chain like
      ``DuplicationPolicy.RAISE.RAISE.RAISE...``
    - Make ``bidict.pairs()`` and :func:`bidict.inverted`
      no longer importable from ``bidict.util``,
      and now only importable from the top-level :mod:`bidict` module.
      (``bidict.util`` was renamed ``bidict._util``.)
    - Pickling ordered bidicts now requires
      at least version 2 of the pickle protocol.
      If you are using Python 3,
      :attr:`pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` is 3 anyway,
      so this will not affect you.
      However if you are using in Python 2,
      :attr:`~pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` is 0,
      so you must now explicitly specify the version
      in your :func:`pickle.dumps` calls,
      e.g. ``pickle.dumps(ob, 2)``.
- Update to version 0.14.2
    - Make initializing (or updating an empty bidict) from only another
      :class:`~bidict.BidirectionalMapping`
      more efficient by skipping unnecessary duplication checking.
    - Fix accidental ignoring of specified ``base_type`` argument
      when (un)pickling a :func:`~bidict.namedbidict`.
    - Fix incorrect inversion of
      ``some_named_bidict.inv.<fwdname>_for`` and
      ``some_named_bidict.inv.<invname>_for``.
    - Only warn when an unsupported Python version is detected
      (e.g. Python < 2.7) rather than raising :class:`AssertionError`.
- Update to version 0.14.1
    - Fix a bug introduced in 0.14.0 where hashing a
      :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict`\’s inverse
      (e.g. ``f = frozenbidict(); {f.inv: '...'}``)
      would cause an ``AttributeError``.
    - Fix a bug introduced in 0.14.0 for Python 2 users
      where attempting to call ``viewitems()``
      would cause a ``TypeError``.
      Thanks Richard Sanger for
      `reporting <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/48>`__.
- Update to version 0.14.0 (2017-11-20)
    - Fix a bug where :class:`~bidict.bidict`\’s
      default *on_dup_kv* policy was set to :attr:`~bidict.RAISE`,
      rather than matching whatever *on_dup_val* policy was in effect
      as was :ref:`documented <basic-usage:Key and Value Duplication>`.
    - Fix a bug that could happen when using Python's optimization (``-O``) flag
      that could leave an ordered bidict in an inconsistent state
      when dealing with duplicated, overwritten keys or values.
      If you do not use optimizations
      (specifically, skipping ``assert`` statements),
      this would not have affected you.
    - Fix a bug introduced by the optimizations in 0.13.0 that could cause
      a frozen bidict that compared equal to another mapping
      to have a different hash value from the other mapping,
      violating Python's object model.
      This would only have affected you if you were inserting a
      frozen bidict and some other immutable mapping that it compared equal to
      into the same set or mapping.
    - Add :meth:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase.equals_order_sensitive`.
    - Reduce the memory usage of ordered bidicts.
    - Make copying of ordered bidicts faster.
    - Improvements to tests and CI, including:
      > Test on Windows
      > Test with PyPy3
      > Test with CPython 3.7-dev
      > Test with optimization flags
      > Require pylint to pass
  + Breaking API Changes
    - Rename:
      > ``orderedbidict`` → :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidict`
      > ``frozenorderedbidict`` → :class:`~bidict.FrozenOrderedBidict`
      so that these now match the case of :class:`collections.OrderedDict`.
    - The names of the
      :class:`~bidict.bidict`,
      :func:`~bidict.namedbidict`, and
      :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict` classes
      have been retained as all-lowercase
      so that they continue to match the case of
      :class:`dict`, :func:`~collections.namedtuple`, and
      :class:`frozenset`, respectively.
    - The ``ON_DUP_VAL`` duplication policy value for *on_dup_kv* has been removed.
      Use ``None`` instead.
    - Merge :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict` and ``BidictBase``
      together and remove ``BidictBase``.
      :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict`
      is now the concrete base class that all other bidict types derive from.
      See the updated :ref:`other-bidict-types:Bidict Types Diagram`.
    - Merge :class:`~bidict.frozenbidict` and ``FrozenBidictBase``
      together and remove ``FrozenBidictBase``.
      See the updated :ref:`other-bidict-types:Bidict Types Diagram`.
    - Merge ``frozenorderedbidict`` and ``OrderedBidictBase`` together
      into a single :class:`~bidict.FrozenOrderedBidict`
      class and remove ``OrderedBidictBase``.
      :class:`~bidict.OrderedBidict` now extends
      :class:`~bidict.FrozenOrderedBidict`
      to add mutable behavior.
      See the updated :ref:`other-bidict-types:Bidict Types Diagram`.
    - Make :meth:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase.__eq__`
      always perform an order-insensitive equality test,
      even if the other mapping is ordered.
      Previously,
      :meth:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase.__eq__`
      was only order-sensitive for other ``OrderedBidictBase`` subclasses,
      and order-insensitive otherwise.
      Use the new :meth:`~bidict.OrderedBidictBase.equals_order_sensitive`
      method for order-sensitive equality comparison.
    - ``orderedbidict._should_compare_order_sensitive()`` has been removed.
    - ``frozenorderedbidict._HASH_NITEMS_MAX`` has been removed.
      Since its hash value must be computed from all contained items
      (so that hash results are consistent with
      equality comparisons against unordered mappings),
      the number of items that influence the hash value should not be limitable.
    - ``frozenbidict._USE_ITEMSVIEW_HASH`` has been removed, and
      ``frozenbidict.compute_hash()``
      now uses ``collections.ItemsView._hash()`` to compute the hash always,
      not just when running on PyPy.
      Override ``frozenbidict.compute_hash()``
      to return ``hash(frozenset(iteritems(self)))``
      if you prefer the old default behavior on CPython,
      which takes linear rather than constant space,
      but which uses the ``frozenset_hash`` routine
      (implemented in ``setobject.c``)
      rather than the pure Python ``ItemsView._hash()`` routine.
    - ``loosebidict`` and ``looseorderedbidict`` have been removed.
      A simple recipe to implement equivalents yourself is now given in
      :ref:`extending:OverwritingBidict Recipe`.
    - Rename ``FrozenBidictBase._compute_hash()`` →
      ``frozenbidict.compute_hash()``.
    - Rename ``DuplicationBehavior`` →
      :class:`~bidict.DuplicationPolicy`.
    - Rename:
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._fwd_class`` → ``.fwd_cls``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._inv_class`` → ``.inv_cls``
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._on_dup_key`` → :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.on_dup_key`
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._on_dup_val`` → :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.on_dup_val`
      > ``bidict.BidictBase._on_dup_kv`` → :attr:`~bidict.BidictBase.on_dup_kv`
