- Remove fix-test_plugin_glib.patch -- Fixed upstream
- Update to version 1.9.0:
  Features:
  * Added WxPusher Support
  * Persistent Storage added. This feature is very big and better documented here.
    https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/persistent_storage
    Long overdue, plugins can now safely cache some of the query
    results returned from upstream endpoints to disk. This saves
    the need to make future extra web requests later (overall
    causing a performance boost to Apprise). It's a cache engine
    done right; content is contained, and those using the CLI can
    clean/reset it. You can also easily turn it off.
  * mqtt:// support for publishing retain flag
  * SendGrid Attachment Support Added
  * Refactored base64 attachment handling
  Fixes:
  * Fix typo in readme
  * Fix Telegram Thread/Topic handling
  * Fixed mattermost channel handling
  * Escape unsupported Telegram MarkdownV2 characters
    Telegram MarkdownV2 has turned out to be a VERY different style
    of markdown. For consistency, the default telegram mode is
    version 1. Simply add ?format=markdown&mdv=v2 to your URL to
    change this.

- Updates from version 1.8.0:
  Features:

  * Do not sanitize http:// attachment URLs. This allows the
    successful fetching of very complicated http based Attachment

    effect of this change, is built in switches like cache= become
    case sensitive too (e.g Cache= will no longer be parsed).
