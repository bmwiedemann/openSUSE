  <title>Perl module for dumping Perl objects from/to XML</title>
  <description>XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to XML format. XML::Dumper can also read
XML data that was previously dumped by the module and convert it back
to Perl. You can use the module read the XML from a file and write the
XML to a file. Perl objects are blessed back to their original
packaging; if the modules are installed on the system where the perl
objects are reconstituted from xml, they will behave as expected.
Intuitively, if the perl objects are converted and reconstituted in the
same environment, all should be well. And it is.
