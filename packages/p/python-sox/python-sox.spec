%description
SOX is intended to be the Swiss Army knife of sound processing tools.
It does many things, it just does not do them all well. Sooner or later
it will come in very handy. SOX is really only usable day-to-day if you
hide the wacky options with one-line shell scripts.

This is a Python wrapper for SOX.
