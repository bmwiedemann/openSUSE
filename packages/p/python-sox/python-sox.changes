- Build package from source
- Run tests
- Update to 1.5.0
  - This is the first stable release of the 1.5 series. It is
    functionally identical to 1.5-rc1. Compared to 1.4, the main
    change is that we have dropped support for EOL Python (3.7 and
    earlier) and have added support for Python up to 3.12 (@hugovk and
    @lostanlen).
  - New features:
    * pathlib support (#124), @cjacoby
    * type hints (#129), @hadware and @rabitt
