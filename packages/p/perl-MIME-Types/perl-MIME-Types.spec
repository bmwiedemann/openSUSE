%description
MIME types are used in many applications (for instance as part of e-mail
and HTTP traffic) to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. or
expected. See RFC2045 at _https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt_

Sometimes detailed knowledge about a mime-type is need, however this module
only knows about the file-name extensions which relate to some filetype. It
can also be used to produce the right format: types which are not
registered at IANA need to use 'x-' prefixes.

This object administers a huge list of known mime-types, combined from
various sources. For instance, it contains *all IANA* types and the
knowledge of Apache. Probably the most complete table on the net!
