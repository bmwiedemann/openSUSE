Tue Dec 16 21:09:38 UTC 2025 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- Update to version 5.1.28
  * Defragmentation now reclaims unused space from moved entries,
    resulting in better compaction.
  * Shared memory for new entries is allocated faster in scenarios with
    many free memory blocks. This should improve APCu's insertion
    performance when entries are frequently deleted or replaced, or when
    APCu is used with larger amounts of memory.
  * Trying to insert entries larger than the shared memory no longer
    results in cache wipes.
  * Fix build against PHP 8.6.
  * Fix apc.php compatibility with older apcu versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 17 19:54:58 UTC 2025 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- Update to version 5.1.27
  * Fixed another hang introduced in apcu 5.1.25, which can occur when
    defragmentation is triggered under load.
  * The report_memleaks INI directive has been removed from all tests as
    it will be deprecated in PHP 8.5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  8 19:23:58 UTC 2025 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- Update to version 5.1.26
  * Fixed hang introduced in apcu 5.1.25, which can occur when
    defragmentation is triggered under load.
  * Fixed a test on PHP 8.5.

- Update to version 5.1.25
  * If the cache is full, try to clean up expired entries based on their
    per-entry hard TTL even if the soft apc.ttl is 0. Previously the entire
    cache was discarded.
  * If a new entry cannot be inserted due to fragmentation, the cache will
    be defragmented, combining many small free blocks into one big free
    block by moving around cache entries. This avoids the need to discard
    the entire cache in more cases.
  * The access time (which is used by the soft apc.ttl) is now also updated
    when using apcu_exists().
  * apc.entries_hint now defaults to 512 entries per 1MB of shared memory.
    Previously the default was 4096, independent of shm_size. This could
    lead to a large number of hash collisions if shm_size was increased
    without also increasing entries_hint.
  * Added apc.mmap_hugepage_size to use huge pages of a certain size for the
    apcu shared memory segment. This requires support for huge pages to be
    enabled in the kernel. Note that even if this option is not set, shared
    memory is still configured to use transparent huge pages.
  * The apc.shm_segments ini option has been removed. Multiple SHM segments
    are no longer supported. (They were already not supported when using
    mmap, which is the default mode of operation)
  * The apc.smart configuration setting should now work more reliably.
    Values > 1 can be used to increase the chance of discarding the entire
    cache when the amount of memory freed by removing expired entries was
    too small. This could be useful if performance degrades due to executing
    the logic to remove expired entries (+ defragmentation) too frequently
    during periods of high memory usage.
  * The number of cache cleanups performed (removal of expired entries) is
    now available in the array returned by apcu_cache_info() (via array key
    "cleanups").
  * The number of defragmentations performed is now available in the array
    returned by apcu_cache_info() (via array key "defragmentations").
  * Fixed several issues that caused inserting new entries to fail
    unexpectedly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  2 20:00:03 UTC 2024 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

  * apc.php: Preserve search parameter when deleting entry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 18 21:31:29 UTC 2023 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- Update to version 5.1.23
  * Revert use of monotonic clock for TTL
  * Fix a crash when serializing packed arrays (e.g. lists) in PHP 8.2+
    with `apc.serializer=default`.
  * Reduce memory usage when serializing packed arrays (e.g. lists) in
    PHP 8.2+ with `apc.serializer=default`.
  * Speed up serializing arrays with `apc.serializer=default`.
  * Reduce memory usage when unserializing instances of the empty array
    in PHP 7.3+.
  * Removed no longer working apcue extension.
  * Increased limit on maximum number of slots.
  * Made tests compatible with PHP 8.3.

  * Use monotonic clock for TTL

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  9 20:53:51 UTC 2021 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- Update to version 5.1.21
  * Fixed compatibility with PHP 8.1 by adding return types to
    APCUIterator.
  * APCUIterator::current() and ::key() can no longer be called on an
    invalid iterator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  4 10:10:35 UTC 2021 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- Update to version 5.1.20
  * Fix deadlocks when other apcu_* functions are used inside apcu_entry().
    It should now be safe to use any functions inside the apcu_entry()
    callback.
  * Fix division by zero exception in apc.php.
  * Fix handling of references in PHP 8 if "default" serializer is used
    (which is not the default).
  * Fix string reuse handling if "default" serializer is used (which is
    not the default).
  * Check for failures when acquiring read locks to report problems
    earlier (write locks were already checked previously).
  * Adjust tests for current PHP 8.1 development branch.
  * Remove *_api.h headers. Use apc_cache.h instead of apc_cache_api.h etc.

instead of saturating to a floating point value.

Sat Dec 15 11:07:06 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Updated to 5.1.15
  - Restore apc.serializer=php as the default, as the "default" 
    serializer still/again has issues.
  - Fix possible issues in persistence of arrays with the "default" 
    serializer.
  - Attempt to reduce shared memory fragementation.

- Updated to 5.1.14

  - Fix potential issue with destruction of locks. This does not 
    affect Linux, but might affect Windows and BSD.

    (if pthreads mutex available).
  - Require only read-lock for apcu_cas(), by using atomic 
    compare-and-swap.

- Updated to 5.1.13
  - Reimplement persistence logic using precise allocation rather 
    than memory pools. This reduces memory usage of cache entries, 
    especially for small values, and improves performance of 
    persisting and unpersisting values.
  - Fixed GH #335: Stampede protection is broken.
  - Fixed GH #328: Segfault in apcu_key_info() if APCu is disabled.
  - Generally make the behavior of functions if APCu is disabled

    allowed as cache keys.
  - Optimized apcu_key_info() and apcu_cache_info() by using 
    interned strings.
  - Fix build against PHP master (PHP 7.4).
