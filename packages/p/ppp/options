# Not every option is listed here, see man pppd for more details.  This file
# is read by the pppd, it is an error when it is not present.
#
# Use the following command to see the active options:
# grep -v ^# /etc/ppp/options | grep -v ^$
#

# The name of this server. Often, the FQDN is used here.
#name <host>

# Enforce the use of the hostname as the name of the local system for
# authentication purposes (overrides the name option).
#usehostname

# If no local IP address is given, pppd will use the first IP address
# that belongs to the local hostname. If "noipdefault" is given, this
# is disabled and the peer will have to supply an IP address.
noipdefault

# With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of our local IP
# address, even if the local IP address was specified in an option.
#ipcp-accept-local

# With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of its (remote) IP
# address, even if the remote IP address was specified in an option.
#ipcp-accept-remote

# Run the executable or shell command specified after pppd has terminated
# the link.  This script could, for example, issue commands to the modem
# to cause it to hang up if hardware modem control signals were not
# available.
# If mgetty is running, it will reset the modem anyway. So there is no need
# to do it here.
#disconnect "chat -- \d+++\d\c OK ath0 OK"

# Increase debugging level (same as -d). The debug output is written
# to syslog LOG_LOCAL2.
#debug

# Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP driver.  The argument n
# is a number which is the sum of the following values: 1 to enable
# general debug messages, 2 to request that the contents of received
# packets be printed, and 4 to request that the contents of transmitted
# packets be printed.
#kdebug n

# noauth means do not require the peer to authenticate itself, this must
# be set if you want to use pppd to connect to the internet. In this case
# *you* must authenicate yourself to the peer(internet provider), so do
# not disable this setting unless you are the dial-in server which where
# the peer has to autenticate to.
noauth

# Use hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS) to control the flow of data
# on the serial port.
crtscts

# Specifies that pppd should use a UUCP-style lock on the serial device
# to ensure exclusive access to the device.
lock

# Use the modem control lines.(is default)
modem
# The opposite: local
#
# Description:
# Don't use the modem control lines.  With this option, pppd will ignore the
# state of the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem and will not change
# the state of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal.
#
# You need to disable modem and enable local if you want to connect to anoter
# system without using a modem:
#local

# async character map -- 32-bit hex; each bit is a character
# that needs to be escaped for pppd to receive it.  0x00000001
# represents '\x01', and 0x80000000 represents '\x1f'.
# To allow pppd to work over a rlogin/telnet connection, ou should escape
# XON (^Q), XOFF  (^S) and ^]: (The peer should use "escape ff".)
#asyncmap  200a0000
asyncmap 0

# needed for some ISDN Terminaladaters, namely ELSA, those seem to have
# problems with asyncmap negotiation, so you can turn off this procedure
# in case your ISDN box has trouble with it, by enabling this option.
# You have to disable the asyncmap <x> option to be sure to have it
# active. If you use wvdial, set the ISDN parameter in /etc/wvdial.conf
# instead.
#default-asyncmap

# Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to <n> for negotiation.  pppd
# will ask the peer to send packets of no more than <n> bytes. The
# minimum MRU value is 128.  The default MRU value is 1500.  A value of
# 296 is recommended for slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256
# bytes of data). The value 1492 is for DSL connections (PPP Default -
# PPPoE Header: 1500 - 8 = 1492)
# mru 1492

# Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to <n>. Unless the peer
# requests a smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will request that
# the kernel networking code send data packets of no more than n bytes
# through the PPP network interface. The value 1492 is for DSL connections
# (PPP Default - PPPoE Header: 1500 - 8 = 1492)
# mtu 1492

# Set the interface netmask to <n>, a 32 bit netmask in "decimal dot"
# notation (e.g. 255.255.255.0).
#netmask 255.255.255.0

# Don't fork to become a background process (otherwise pppd will do so
# if a serial device is specified).
nodetach

# If this option is given, pppd will send an LCP echo-request frame to
# the peer every n seconds. Under Linux, the echo-request is sent when
# no packets have been received from the peer for n seconds. Normally
# the peer should respond to the echo-request by sending an echo-reply.
# This option can be used with the lcp-echo-failure option to detect
# that the peer is no longer connected.
lcp-echo-interval 30

# If this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be dead if n
# LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply.
# If this happens, pppd will terminate the connection.  Use of this
# option requires a non-zero value for the lcp-echo-interval parameter.
# This option can be used to enable pppd to terminate after the physical
# connection has been broken (e.g., the modem has hung up) in
# situations where no hardware modem control lines are available.
lcp-echo-failure 4

# Send up to 60 LCP configure-request during negotiation. With a value
# of 2 for lcp-restart below, this might take up to 2 minutes.
lcp-max-configure 60

# Resend unanswered LCP requests after 2 seconds.
lcp-restart 2

# Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for n seconds.
idle 600

# Specifies the maximal number of attempts to connect to the server. This
# is useful for dial on demand. Default value is 10.
#maxfail 3

# Disable the IPXCP and IPX protocols.
noipx

# In the file /etc/ppp/filters are some active-filter rules. See man pppd
# and man tcpdump for more informations.

# The next two options are only interesting for you if you are admin of
# a system with other users that use ppp, and those users are normally
# never allowed to add default route, or you do not want users to
# replace the default route.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# enable this to prevent users from attempting to add a default route.
# Use this option with caution: If the user needs to use a program like
# wvdial, he will not be able to connect because wvdial forces defaulroute
# but this is rejected by this option and the user will not be able to
# connect to the internet.

# Use the system password database for authenticating the peer using
# PAP. Note: mgetty already provides this option. If this is specified
# then dialin from users using a script under Linux to fire up ppp wont work.
