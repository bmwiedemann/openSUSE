%description
A Python library for automating interaction with websites.
MechanicalSoup automatically stores and sends cookies,
follows redirects, and can follow links and submit forms.
It doesn't do Javascript.

The Mechanize library is incompatible with Python 3 and development
is inactive. MechanicalSoup provides a similar API to it, built on
Python giants Requests (for http sessions) and BeautifulSoup (for
document navigation).
