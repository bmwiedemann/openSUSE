  <title>Compile and link C code for Perl modules</title>
  <description>This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the
appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner. It was
motivated by the Module::Build project, but may be useful for other
purposes as well. However, it is not intended as a general cross-platform
interface to all your C building needs. That would have been a much more
ambitious goal!
