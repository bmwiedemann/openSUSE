%description
This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the
appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner. It was
motivated by the 'Module::Build' project, but may be useful for other
purposes as well. However, it is _not_ intended as a general cross-platform
interface to all your C building needs. That would have been a much more
ambitious goal!
