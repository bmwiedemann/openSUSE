%description
This package consists of a collection of core utility packages useful
for building Python applications.  This package is intended to be at
the bottom of the software stack and have zero required external
dependencies aside from the Python Standard Library.

Packages:

  * Events: A package implementing a lightweight application-wide
    Event dispatch system.  Listeners can subscribe to events based
    on Event type or by filtering on event attributes.  Typical uses
    include UI components listening to low-level progress
    notifications and change notification for distributed resources.

  * Storage: Abstract base classes and concrete implementations of a
    basic key-value storage API. The API is intended to be general
    purpose enough to support a variety of local and remote storage
    systems.

  * Concurrent: A package of tools for handling concurrency within
    applications.

  * Terminal: Some utilities for working with text-based terminal
    displays.
