-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 17 15:29:28 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * removed patch sympy_printing_ccode.patch; included upstream
  * requires python >= 3.8 (skip 3.7)

- update to version 1.11.1:
  * The 1.11 release introduced a regression when using lambdify with
    the cse=True option (introduced in 1.9) resulting in a list being
    returned for a lambdified expression that was not a list. This bug
    is now fixed in the 1.11.1 release.

- changes from version 1.11.0:
  * Highlights:
    + Better support for integrating several different types of
      expressions.
    + The series expansion has seen several improvements.
    + The assumption system is now fully deterministic, so it should
      work in multi-threaded environments.
    + A new and improved Mathematica parser.

Fri May 14 01:35:35 UTC 2021 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 1.8:
  * Backwards compatibility breaks and deprecations
    + Please manually add any backwards compatibility breaks or
      deprecations here, in addition to the automatic listing below.
    + assumptions
      AskHandler(), register_handler() and remove_handler() are
      deprecated. Handler now must be multipledispatch
      instance. (#20835 by @JSS95)
    + parsing
      Parsing of "Q" returns AssumptionKeys instance in assumptions
      module. This means that sympify("Q") will no longer return a
      symbol. (#21152 by @JSS95)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 25 21:45:22 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.7.1:
  core
  * There was a regression in 1.7 that meant that __slots__
    would not work correctly for Basic instances and they
    would end up having __dict__. This also made it possible
    to set arbitrary attributes on Basic instances such as
    symbols which breaks immutability. This was fixed in
    1.7.1 to ensure that Basic instances do not have
    __dict__ and it is not possible to set attributes on
    them. (#20590 by @oscarbenjamin) s
  series
  * Fixed lazy iteration of series with expr.series(x,
     n=None) which was broken in the 1.7 release. (#20589 by
     @oscarbenjamin and @sachin-4099)
  stats
  * Updated documentation for sympy.stats.sample for seed
    argument. (#20555 by @czgdp1807)
  * sympy.stats.sample now has an optional seed argument.
    (#20528 by @czgdp1807)
  * Random failures with sympy.stats.sample have now been
    fixed. (#20527 by @czgdp180
- Changelog for 1.7.0:
  Backwards compatibility breaks and deprecations
  -----------------------------------------------
  core
  * Modules and names that were accidentally importable from
    sympy are no longer importable. In sympy 1.6 importing and
    using these names would give a deprecation warning. In
    sympy 1.7 these names are removed. As an example from
    sympy import add would need to be from sympy.core import
    add or import sympy.core.add as add. (#19554 by
    @oscarbenjamin)
  * DEPRECATION: Using non-Expr args in Add, Mul or Pow is
    now deprecated (#19445 by @oscarbenjamin)
  diffgeom
  * Manifold.patches attribute is deprecated. (#19368 by
    @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
  * Patch.coord_systems attribute is deprecated. (#19368 by
    @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
  * Class signature names of CoordSystem is deprecated.
    CoordinateSymbol class and CoordSystem.symbols attribute are
    introduced instead. (#19368 by @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
  * CoordSystem.transforms, CoordSystem.connect_to, and
    CoordSystem.coord_tuple_transform_to are deprecated. Class
    signature relations, CoordSystem.transformation and
    CoordSystem.transform are introduced instead. (#19368 by
    @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
  printing
  * sympy.printing.pretty.pretty_symbology.xstr has been
    deprecated (#20081 by @eric-wieser)
  * The unicode argument to sympy.printing.stringpict.prettyForm
    has been deprecated (#20081 by @eric-wieser)
  * The deprecation of calling preview with viewer="StringIO" is
    now expired instead of forgotten (a regression in 1.6.0)
    (#19905 by @eric-wieser)
  * The modules sympy.printing.ccode, sympy.printing.fcode, and
    sympy.printing.cxxcode have been renamed to sympy.printing.c,
    sympy.printing.fortran, and sympy.printing.cxx, respectively.
    This was done to avoid conflicts that occur when a module name
    is the same as a function name. The modules are still
    importable under their old names but doing so is deprecated
    and a warning will be given (#19908 by @asmeurer)
  * from sympy.printing.codeprinter import Assignment no longer
    works. You should use from sympy.codegen import Assignment,
    which is where Assignment has lived since SymPy 1.1. (#19908
    by @asmeurer)
  * Calling preview with viewer="file" no longer looks for a file
    executable (a regression in 1.6.0) (#19905 by @eric-wieser)
  solvers
  * solve_linear_system is now a thin wrapper for linsolve. It is
    recommended to use linsolve in new code. solve_linear_system
    maybe deprecated or removed in future. (#18814 by
    @oscarbenjamin)
  utilities
  * find_executable is deprecated in favor of the builtin shutil.
    which. (#19634 by @eric-wieser)
  Changes
  -------
  algebras
  * Added DocString for integrate function of quaternion class.
    (#19410 by @mohitshah3111999)
  codegen
  * Added support for generating calls to scipy.special.cosm1.
    (#20011 by @bjodah)
  * sympy.codegen and sympy.combinatorics are no longer imported
    as part of from sympy import *. The codegen and combinatorics
    modules do not have any names that are included in the
    top-level namespace, so their being imported with the
    top-level SymPy was a mistake. This improves the import time
    of from sympy import *. (#19908 by @asmeurer)
  * Added support for generating calls to numpy.logaddexp & numpy.
    logaddexp2. (#19880 by @bjodah)
  * Fix bugs to the parser of matrix expressions in order to build
    CodegenArray objects correctly. (#19197 by @Upabjojr)
  combinatorics
  * Fixed a bug in PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks caused by
    modifying a list while iterating over its indices. (#19954 by
    @ilya-pchelintsev)
  concrete
  * Implemented Raabe's Test (#18656 by @sachin-4099)
  core
  * Fixed a few broken cases of expr.is_integer (#20450 by @coproc
    and @tbennun)
  * Modules and names that were accidentally importable from sympy
    are no longer importable. In sympy 1.6 importing and using
    these names would give a deprecation warning. In sympy 1.7
    these names are removed. As an example from sympy import add
    would need to be from sympy.core import add or import sympy.
    core.add as add. (#19554 by @oscarbenjamin)
  * Zero raised to power Negative Infinity gives ComplexInfinity
    (zoo) instead of zero (#20212 by @sidhu1012)
  * Extensible add, mul and power functions are introduced to
    allow sympy objects to define what classes should be used for
    them in place of Add, Mul and Pow (e.g. matrices use MatAdd).
    This is an experimental approach aimed at enabling the
    behaviour of core routines (expand, collect, etc) to be
    customised by user-defined types (e.g. MatAdd rather than
    Add). This mechanism is still experimental, is not fully
    implemented across the core and might be changed or removed in
    a future release of sympy. (#19463 by @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
  * divmod on sympy.Float with 0 numerator now results in (0, 0).
    (#20109 by @eriknw)
  * Dict operations no longer automatically converts strings into
    SymPy types. (#19911 by @asmeurer)
  * Dict operations no longer raise SympifyError. (#19911 by
    @asmeurer)
  * Fixes _eval_nseries() function of power.py (#19508 by
    @sachin-4099)
  * Remove optional dependency on fastcache (#19492 by @pbrady)
  * DEPRECATION: Using non-Expr args in Add, Mul or Pow is now
    deprecated (#19445 by @oscarbenjamin)
  * When creating an Add or Mul with evaluate=False identities (0
    or 1) are no longer removed. (#19450 by @oscarbenjamin)
  * Fixes _eval_nseries() function of mul.py (#19369 by
    @sachin-4099)
  * Sum is now included in count_ops results (#19261 by @smichr)
  * match has been optimized to improve term-matching in Add
    (#19261 by @smichr)
  * match will automatically ignore bound symbols when matching
    (#19261 by @smichr)
  * match results will no longer contain extraneous symbols (only
    those requested) (#19261 by @smichr)
  * as_dummy should give a canonical result for expressions having
    bound symbols (#19261 by @smichr)
  * Lambdas written in terms of different symbols will no longer
    compare equal; this was an abuse of the Python == operator
    (#19261 by @smichr)
  * expr: A new method is_meromorphic is added. (#19306 by @jksuom)
  diffgeom
  * Manifold.patches attribute is deprecated. (#19368 by @JSS95
    and @mcpl-sympy)
  * Patch.coord_systems attribute is deprecated. (#19368 by @JSS95
    and @mcpl-sympy)
  * Class signature names of CoordSystem is deprecated.
    CoordinateSymbol class and CoordSystem.symbols attribute are
    introduced instead. (#19368 by @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
  * CoordSystem.transforms, CoordSystem.connect_to, and
    CoordSystem.coord_tuple_transform_to are deprecated. Class
    signature relations, CoordSystem.transformation and
    CoordSystem.transform are introduced instead. (#19368 by
    @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
  * CoordSystem.jacobian_determinant method is introduced. (#19368
    by @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
  functions
  * lambdify added a warning when args is a set. (#19792 by
    @foice, @RobertoFranceschini, and @sylee957)
  * Fixes _eval_nseries method of log (#20002 by @sachin-4099)
  * Adds _eval_is_meromorphic method and _eval_aseries to class
    lowergamma (#19990 by @sachin-4099)

    (#19697 by @sachin-4099)
  * Improved condition checking in piecewise_simplify() (#19596 by
    @dhruvmendiratta6 and @smichr)
  * Implemented _eval_rewrite_as_Abs() for sign (#19487 by
    @dhruvmendiratta6)
  * Adds cdir parameter to handle series expansions on branch cuts
    (#19555 by @sachin-4099)
  * Adds _eval_rewrite_as_factorial() and _eval_rewrite_as_gamma()
    functionalities for subfactorial (#19515 by @sachin-4099)

  * Added class MatrixSet to represent the set of matrices (#19826
    by @Smit-create)
  * Disabled default matrix intermediate product simplification
    and changed it to enable via context manager. (#19588 by
    @oscarbenjamin and @Pristine-Cat)
  * Use more efficient Cholesky factorization method to check if
    matrices are positive semidefinite. (#19573 by @galbwe)

    @sidhu1012)
  * Point.vel() now attempts to calculate the velocity using the
    relative position from other points if it has not been already
    set by the user. This behavior mimics the existing behavior in
    ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in(). (#20049 by @moorepants and
    @sidhu1012)
  * VectorLatexPrinter now respects the symbol_names setting when
    printing dynamicsymbols (#19684 by @eric-wieser)
  * VectorLatexPrinter now know about the same trig functions as
    the regular printer (#19684 by @eric-wieser)
  * When printing, Vector and Dyadic now respect keyword-arguments

  * capability to subclass Basebackend and specify it to the
    plotting functions, thus creating plots with other plotting
    libraries (#20463 by @oscarbenjamin)

    (compose=False) (#19799 by @coproc)
  * Fixed GeneratorsError for creating some elements of
    FractionField when its ground domain is FractionField or PolynomialRing. (#19713 by @sylee957)
  * Fixed Poly initialized with PolyElement mutating the generator
    of the coefficient in the form of polynomial. (e.g. Poly(ZZ[x]
    (x+1), y, domain=ZZ[x]) becomes Poly(y+1, y, domain=ZZ[x]))
    (#19659 by @sylee957)
  * Fixed Poly initialized with FracElement raising SympifyError.
    (e.g. dom = ZZ.frac_field(x); Poly(dom(x+2), y, domain=dom))
    (#19659 by @sylee957)
  * Add division to finite extensions. (#19593 by @gschintgen and
    @jksuom)

  * added new domains for Gaussian integers and rationals (#15396
    by @jksuom and @smichr)
  * Add the Gaussian domains ZZ_I and QQ_I to Poly. Make Poly use
    the Gaussian domains automatically when I is present in the
    input. Add factorisation over the Gaussian integers (ZZ_I).
    The polys keyword argument gaussian=True now results in the
    domain QQ_I rather than the extension field QQ<I>. (#15396 by
    @oscarbenjamin)
  * improvement of dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K) by Knuth-Cohen
    bound (#19254 by @lagamura)
  printing
  * Support frac with pycode printers (for lambdify) (#20115 by
    @ehren)
  * Round-trip printing of floats (double-precision) to content
    MathML. (#19958 by @lcontento)
  * latex now once again requires settings to be passed as keyword
    and not positional arguments, and respects printer settings
    changed with set_global_settings; restoring the behavior from
    sympy 1.2 and earlier. (#20067 by @eric-wieser)
  * sympy.printing.pretty.pretty_symbology.xstr has been

    importable under their old names but doing so is deprecated
    and a warning will be given (#19908 by @asmeurer)

  * Calling preview with viewer="file" no longer looks for a file
    executable (a regression in 1.6.0) (#19905 by @eric-wieser)
  * The deprecation of calling preview with viewer="StringIO" is
    now expired instead of forgotten (a regression in 1.6.0)
    (#19905 by @eric-wieser)
  * When printing, NDimArray now respects keyword-arguments to
    sstr (#19903 by @eric-wieser)
  * preview no longer fails with ValueError if the preamble
    contains a % character. (#19858 by @eric-wieser)
  * Types which are not recognized by the LaTeX printer no longer
    have their __str__ interpreted as LaTeX, and have their str(...
    ) printed as pre-formatted text as if they were printed
    normally. This includes the builtin str type: latex("hello")
    now results in the latex \mathtt{\text{hello}}.
  * If a custom type intends to be interpreted as latex, it should
    define the _latex hook as described in the docs:
    def _latex(self, printer):
        return str(self)  # indicate that the result of __str__ is LaTeX-compatible
  * To print a string containing LaTeX math using MathJax, use
    import IPython

  * Fixed the SciPy printer for sparse matrices (#19633 by
    @benjaminwolba and @sylee957)
  * preview(..., output='pdf') now uses dvipdfmx instead of dvipdf
    if available. As a result, it now works with a MiKTeX
    installation on windows. (#19635 by @eric-wieser)
  * LatexPrinter._print is no longer called on strings which have
    already been converted to Latex. (#19614 by @eric-wieser)
  * A new sympy.printing.defaults.Printable base class was added,
    which is a mixin providing _repr_latex_ in terms of
    LatexPrinter().doprint(). Any user type which subclasses this
    will opt into init_printing. (#19425 by @eric-wieser)
  * Printing unevaluated Muls with multiple Number factors will
    show all factors strictly in order. Identities will also be
    shown explicitly. (#19450 by @oscarbenjamin)
  * user types that implement _latex are now printed as LaTeX when
    embedded within builtin collections like list or dict. (#19389
    by @eric-wieser)

    and set properly (#19346 by @rational-kunal)
  * tuples of one element now include the usual trailing comma
    (#19348 by @eric-wieser)

    uses is_meromorphic() for limit evaluations (#19432 by
    @sachin-4099)

    functions with limits that are specified non-central. (#19382
    by @sylee957)
  * Replaces xreplace() with subs() in rewrite() function of
    gruntz.py resolving incorrect limit evaluations (#19297 by
    @sachin-4099)
  * Adds a condition to limitinf() function of gruntz.py resolving
    incorrect limit evaluations (#19292 by @sachin-4099)
  sets
  * Earlier expr and sets were treated equal which gave incorrect
    output for some set functions(mainly : - in, is_subset), made
    sets and expr not to be equal (#20208 by @sidhu1012)
  * nested multi-symbol first arg for ConditionSet now handled
    with subs/as_dummy (#19512 by @smichr)

    @smichr)
  * the error checking for mismatched signatures for sym and the
    base set has been improved (#19512 by @smichr)
  * ConditionSet still tries to unify symbols and denest a base
    set that is given as a ConditionSet but will no longer
    introduce new symbols (and will leave the base set a a
    ConditionSet) when this cannot be done (#19512 by @smichr)
  * Fixed ConditionSet.dummy_eq() and ConditionSet.as_dummy().
    (#19502 by @gschintgen)

    targets a free symbol. (#19495 by @gschintgen)
  * Fixed _infimum_key sorting key. (#19437 by @gschintgen)

  * Added dsolve_system that can solve a system of ODEs (#19695 by

  * Added the new n equations linear first-order non-constant
    coefficient non-homogeneous solver where the coefficient
    matrix of the system of ODEs is commutative with its
    antiderivative. (#19594 by @mijo2)
  * solveset will always use a symbol that has only either the
    real or complex attribute and no other attribute; when a
    ConditionSet is returned, the original symbol for which the
    solution is being sought will be used if it does not cause
    evaluation of the result. (#19512 by @smichr)
  * In dsolve there is no a general solver that can solve systems
    of constant coefficient non-homogeneous first order ODEs of
    any size in terms of integrals. (#19341 by @mijo2)
  * Fixed exception handling in solveset's secondary trigonometric
    solver. (#19566 by @gschintgen)
  * equations with an additive generator are now solved more
    quickly (#19524 by @smichr)
  * Improved solveset capabilities for solving trigonometric
    equations, notably rational and symbolic coefficients are now
    supported. (#19507 by @gschintgen)
  * solve_linear_system is now a thin wrapper for linsolve. It is
    recommended to use linsolve in new code. solve_linear_system
    maybe deprecated or removed in future. (#18814 by

  * All the ensemble classes (RandomMatrixEnsemble,
    GaussianEnsemble, GaussianOrthogonalEnsemble, ...) now becomes
    stub function constructors. If you want to use them as

  + Backwards compatibility breaks and deprecations
    > assumptions
      * Removed deprecated Q.bounded (use Q.finite instead). Deprecated since version 1.0 (issue: #9425) (#18390 by @Smit-create)
      * Removed deprecated Q.infinitesimal (use Q.zero instead). Deprecated since version 1.0 (issue: #9675) (#18390 by @Smit-create)
      * Removed deprecated Q.infinity (use Q.infinte instead). Deprecated since version 1.0 (issue: #9426) (#18390 by @Smit-create)
    > calculus
      * Deprecated evaluate argument in differentiate_finite for making non-conservative finite differences. (#17881 by @vezeli)
    > combinatorics
      * Using Permutation.print_cyclic will raise deprecation warnings (#18033 by @oscarbenjamin, @souravgl0, and @sylee957)
    > core
      * Deprecated sympify automatically converting custom objects with __str__ or __repr__ implemented. (#19006 by @sylee957)
      * BREAKING CHANGE: Basic.has no longer accepts strings as input. For example in SymPy 1.5 you could do Symbol('x').has('x') and the string 'x' passed to has would be sympified to a symbol so that the result would be True. In SymPy 1.6 this will raise an error because the string 'x' can not be sympified using strict sympification. (#19251 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * Remove deprecated bounded, unbounded and infinitesimal. Deprecated since version 0.7.6 (issue #8071) (#18503 by @Smit-create)
      * Relational is no longer a subclass of Expr and does not produce nonsensical results in arithmetic operations. This affects all Relational subclasses (Eq, Ne, Gt, Ge, Lt, Le). It is no longer possible to call meaningless Expr methods like as_coeff_Mul on Relational instances. (#18053 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * Expr now uses cooperative dispatch for binary operations so it is possible for non-Expr Basic subclasses to override the behaviour of e.g. a + b where one of a or b is an instance of Expr. This also means that any non-Expr Basic subclasses can not depend on Expr.__add__ to create Add(a, b): if a class is not a subclass of Expr and wants to define binary operations with Expr it must do so explicitly in its own __add__ method. For classes depending on this this is not a backward compatible change. (#18116 by @oscarbenjamin)
    > matrices
      * The Matrix.is_zero property has been renamed to Matrix.is_zero_matrix.
      * Matrix.is_zero is now always False. This is because in general is_zero means the number zero so a matrix can never be zero.
    > To get the old behavior of M.is_zero in both old and new versions of sympy use from sympy.core.logic import fuzzy_and; fuzzy_and(m.is_zero for m in M). (#18464 by @sylee957)
    > polys
      * BREAKING CHANGE: Poly and PurePoly now subclass Basic rather than Expr. This means that they no longer have various Expr methods such as expand that do not make sense for Poly. Use as_expr to convert the Poly to an Expr before using Expr methods. (#18613 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * BREAKING CHANGE: Poly instances with different domains now always compare unequal with p1 == p2 and p1.eq(p2). Previously Poly instances that had the same expression and generators would compare equal even if the domains were different. In some cases it might be necessary to specify the domain when comparing e.g. if p == Poly(x, x, domain='QQ'). (#18613 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * DEPRECATION: Mixing Poly with non-polynomial Expr in binary operations is now deprecated. For example Poly(x, x) * exp(x) will give a deprecation warning but still return the Expr x*exp(x) as before. If the Expr can be converted to Poly (e.g. Poly(x, x) * x) then a Poly will be returned. To get an Expr always use the as_expr method first to convert the Poly to an Expr. To get a Poly always use as_poly to convert the Expr to a Poly. (#18613 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * DEPRECATION: Passing Poly as the integrand to the integrate function or Integral class is now deprecated. Use the integrate method instead e.g. Poly(x, x).integrate(x) (#18613 by @oscarbenjamin)
    > printing
      * Removed deprecated Ccodeprinter (Use C89Printer or C99Printer instead). Deprecated since version 1.1 (Issue : #12220). (#18392 by @risubaba)
      * Removed deprecated file viewer option in preview. Deprecated since version 0.7.3(Issue: #7018) (#18392 by @risubaba)
      * Removed deprecated StringIO viewer option in preview. Deprecated since version 0.7.2(Issue: #7083) (#18392 by @risubaba)
    > sets
      * Set now uses cooperative dispatch for binary operations so it is possible for non-Set Basic subclasses to override the behaviour of e.g. a + b where one of a or b is an instance of Set. This also means that any non-Set Basic subclasses can not depend on e.g. Set.__add__ to create Union(a, b): if a class is not a subclass of Set and wants to define binary operations with Set it must do so explicitly in its own __add__ method. For classes depending on this this is not a backward compatible change. (#18116 by @oscarbenjamin)
    > other
      * Submodule names are no longer imported with from sympy import *. They can still be imported directly like from sympy import core or accessed like sympy.core, or like sys.modules['sympy.simplify'] for modules that share names with SymPy functions. (#18245 by @oscarbenjamin)

      * Removed deprecated Q.infinitesimal (use Q.zero instead). Deprecated since version 1.0 (issue: #9675) (#18390 by @Smit-create)
      * Removed deprecated Q.infinity (use Q.infinte instead). Deprecated since version 1.0 (issue: #9426) (#18390 by @Smit-create)
      * Matrices can now be checked for antihermitian property by using ask(Q.antihermitian()) which earlier generated incorrect results. (#18303 by @czgdp1807)
      * Improved code in ask function using constructs from cnf module. (#18204 by @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)

      * Fixed Permutation applying for negative integers. (#18032 by @mrocklin and @sylee957)
      * Added Permutation.apply to use permutation as a symbolic function. (#18032 by @mrocklin and @sylee957)
      * Using Permutation.print_cyclic will raise deprecation warnings (#18033 by @oscarbenjamin, @souravgl0, and @sylee957)
      * Cycle class is no longer mutable and can be regarded as a sparse representation of a permutation (#17973 by @sachin-4099)
    > core
      * BREAKING CHANGE: Basic.has no longer accepts strings as input. For example in SymPy 1.5 you could do Symbol('x').has('x') and the string 'x' passed to has would be sympified to a symbol so that the result would be True. In SymPy 1.6 this will raise an error because the string 'x' can not be sympified using strict sympification. (#19251 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * Mul.is_integer no longer rebuilds arguments into Mul (#19182 by @iammosespaulr)
      * Mul with odd numerator and even denominator is recognized as rational but not integer (#19155 by @smichr)
      * Deprecated sympify automatically converting custom objects with __str__ or __repr__ implemented. (#19006 by @sylee957)
      * when strict=True, as_int will not convert True to 1 (#19054 by @smichr)
      * Support mpmath.matrix in sympify. (#18911 by @smichr and @sylee957)
      * Adds simplification to Pow._eval_nseries resolving incorrect limit evaluation (#18962 by @sachin-4099)
      * doit(deep=False) now evaluates Add and Mul. (#18829 by @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
      * Reduces sensitivity of computation of order terms in Pow._eval_nseries (#18785 by @sachin-4099)
      * Pow.is_zero is fixed for some cases involving infinite (or possibly infinite) expressions. (#18728 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * Now finite and infinite are logical opposites in the old assumptions system so e.g. a Symbol declared with finite=False will have infinite=True. (#18726 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * sympify no longer converts numpy arrays with size to scalars (#18651 by @mijo2 and @NeilGirdhar)
      * __getnewargs__() added to Zero, One, NegativeOne, Half. (#18675 by @mohitacecode)
      * simplification of powers with numerical products in the base is improved (#18650 by @sachin-4099)

      * Add,_eval_as_leading_term() has been fixed (#18340 by @sachin-4099)
      * Updated the definition of atoms method of class Basic (#18532 by @mijo2)
      * basic - sorting in subs is improved so unsorted arguments will prefer replacing more complicated patterns first (e.g. the second derivative before the first derivative). (#18043 by @Psycho-Pirate)
      * Remove deprecated bounded, unbounded and infinitesimal. Deprecated since version 0.7.6 (issue #8071) (#18503 by @Smit-create)
      * Added check for AccumBounds. (#18478 by @smichr and @Smit-create)
      * Adding gmpy in integer_nthroot ( It works only for n < 2**63) (#18380 by @Smit-create)
      * Added new test case for relational (#18416 by @mijo2)
      * Pow._eval_nseries fixed to accept all real exponents. (#18406 by @Smit-create)
      * integer_ntroot and igcd now use gmpy when it is installed (#18276 by @Smit-create)
      * Changed some partial derivatives like diff(f(g(x), h(x)), x) not to have dummy symbols. (#18326 by @sachin-4099)
      * subs now works correctly with partial derivatives. (#18326 by @sachin-4099)
      * Subclass of Function can inherit its nargs attribute to its subclasses. (#18258 by @JSS95 and @mcpl-sympy)
      * Added try-except block in sympy/core/relational.py to handle NotImplementedError and return ConditionSet (#18211 by @Smit-create)
      * Renamed core/evaluate to core/parameters (#18198 by @JSS95, @mcpl-sympy, and @oscarbenjamin)
      * Added global_parameters, which is a thread-local storage for global parameters such as evaluate, distribute, etc. (#18198 by @JSS95, @mcpl-sympy, and @oscarbenjamin)
      * Relational is no longer a subclass of Expr and does not produce nonsensical results in arithmetic operations. This affects all Relational subclasses (Eq, Ne, Gt, Ge, Lt, Le). It is no longer possible to call meaningless Expr methods like as_coeff_Mul on Relational instances. (#18053 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * Expr now uses cooperative dispatch for binary operations so it is possible for non-Expr Basic subclasses to override the behaviour of e.g. a + b where one of a or b is an instance of Expr. This also means that any non-Expr Basic subclasses can not depend on Expr.__add__ to create Add(a, b): if a class is not a subclass of Expr and wants to define binary operations with Expr it must do so explicitly in its own __add__ method. For classes depending on this this is not a backward compatible change. (#18116 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * Added global_evaluate[0] condition in add, sub, mul, div functions in Infinity class. (#18109 by @namannimmo10)
      * Moved .as_poly() from Basic to Expr. (#18094 by @dhruvmendiratta6)
      * Fixed a bug in Factors().as_expr() that led to simplifications that are not generally valid for complex numbers. (Exponents were always multiplied in power-of-a-power situations.) (#18087 by @gschintgen)
      * Fix a regression in 1.5 that allowed expressions to compare equal to strings, and caused == to call str() on the other object. (#18057 by @asmeurer)

      * is_literal can treat Not as literal or not by using the literal_Not flag (#18912 by @smichr)
      * Opposing Relationals are now detected correctly in nested Ands allowing evaluation to False in more cases. (#18811 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * Added a new normal form - ANFform. Function ANFform converts a list of truth values to an expression in Algebraic Normal Form (ANF). (#13686 by @KonstantinTogoi)
      * Added a new method BooleanFunction.to_anf that converts an expression to ANF by equivalent transformations. (#13686 by @KonstantinTogoi)
      * Added a new function is_anf that checks if an expression is ANF. (#13686 by @KonstantinTogoi)
      * Added a new function to_anf that converts an expression to ANF if it is not ANF. (#13686 by @KonstantinTogoi)
      * Added a new function distribute_xor_over_and. Given a sentence s consisting of conjunction and exclusive disjunctions of literals, it returns an equivalent exclusive disjunction. (#13686 by @KonstantinTogoi)

    > matrices
      * Fixed matrix creation from the list containg numpy ndarray. (e.g. Matrix([np.array([1, 2]), np.array([1, 2])])) (#19229 by @sylee957)
      * Added is_strongly_diagonally_dominant and is_weakly_diagonally_dominant properties for Matrix. (#19205 by @sylee957)

      * Implemented General Matrix Analytic functions (#18565 by @abhinav28071999)
      * Enabled intermediate matrix product simplification to control expression blowup during certain matrix operations. (#18572 by @Pristine-Cat) (#18147 by @Pristine-Cat) (#18049 by @Pristine-Cat)
      * Added environment variable check SYMPY_DOTPRODSIMP=0 to turn off the new dotprodsimp simplification in case the structure of the new results breaks user code. Should be removed after next live release. (#18572 by @Pristine-Cat)
      * Pulled out and cleaned up many matrix function implementations from matrices.py into individual matrix source files determinant.py, reductions.py, subspaces.py, eigen.py, decompositions.py, solvers.py and inverse.py. (#18564 by @Pristine-Cat) (#18519 by @Pristine-Cat) (#18425 by @Pristine-Cat) (#18420 by @Pristine-Cat) (#18342 by @Pristine-Cat)

      * Fixed wrapper for NumPy matrices so SymPy iteration and indexing works correctly. (#18160 by @Pristine-Cat)
      * Not backwards compatible: The Matrix.is_zero property has been renamed to Matrix.is_zero_matrix. Matrix.is_zero is now always False. This is because in general is_zero means the number zero so a matrix can never be zero. To get the old behavior of M.is_zero in both old and new versions of sympy use from sympy.core.logic import fuzzy_and; fuzzy_and(m.is_zero for m in M). (#18464 by @sylee957)
      * Added PermutationMatrix and MatrixPermute for matrix permutations. (#18032 by @mrocklin and @sylee957)

      * In def _sqrt_mod_prime_power(a, p, k): it is assumed that p is a prime number. And this function calls if not is_quad_residue(a, p): in line 396. But is_quad_residue(a, p) again checks that p is prime or not. This leads to extra computation cost. (#18184 by @abhinav28071999)

      * Fixed initialization of orig_ext and added from_AlgebraicField() to AlgebraicField. (#18669 by @mohitacecode)
      * BREAKING CHANGE: Poly and PurePoly now subclass Basic rather than Expr. This means that they no longer have various Expr methods such as expand that do not make sense for Poly. Use as_expr to convert the Poly to an Expr before using Expr methods. (#18613 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * BREAKING CHANGE: Poly instances with different domains now always compare unequal with p1 == p2 and p1.eq(p2). Previously Poly instances that had the same expression and generators would compare equal even if the domains were different. In some cases it might be necessary to specify the domain when comparing e.g. if p == Poly(x, x, domain='QQ'). (#18613 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * DEPRECATION: Mixing Poly with non-polynomial Expr in binary operations is now deprecated. For example Poly(x, x) * exp(x) will give a deprecation warning but still returne the Expr x*exp(x) as before. If the Expr can be converted to Poly (e.g. Poly(x, x) * x) then a Poly will be returned. To get an Expr always use the as_expr method first to convert the Poly to an Expr. To get a Poly always use as_poly to convert the Expr to a Poly. (#18613 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * DEPRECATION: Passing Poly as the integrand to the integrate function or Integral class is now deprecated. Use the integrate method instead e.g. Poly(x, x).integrate(x) (#18613 by @oscarbenjamin)

      * Fixed bugs in ComplexRegion.contains() that could lead to incorrect results when membership is in fact undecidable or at least unknown. (#18308 by @gschintgen)
      * Fixed minor issues in Interval.contains() (#18426 by @gschintgen)
      * Fixed a bug in FiniteSet's union handler that could lead to some elements being "dropped" if their membership in the other set can't be determined. (#18356 by @gschintgen)
      * Fixed evalf() for Intervals and FiniteSets having symbolic endpoints or containing symbolic elements. (#18251 by @gschintgen)
      * Fixed FiniteSet._complement() for Intervals and S.Reals. Previously wrong results or exceptions could result from set differences involving FiniteSets containing non-reals or symbolic expressions. (#18218 by @gschintgen)
      * Fixed and extended intersection handler for Integer-based ImageSets. (#18200 by @gschintgen)
      * added appropriate error message when infinite ranges are sliced (#17986 by @arun-y99)
      * Added an is_subset handler to check whether a Range is included in a FiniteSet. (#18137 by @gschintgen)
      * Added a simple cache to FiniteSet in order to speed up some membership checks. (#18137 by @gschintgen)
      * Fixed Range.contains() logic for symbolic values. (#18137 by @gschintgen)
      * Fixed Rationals.boundary to be Reals. (is_open and is_closed now both return False.) (#18168 by @gschintgen)
      * is_open logic is improved. (#18168 by @gschintgen)
      * Set now uses cooperative dispatch for binary operations so it is possible for non-Set Basic subclasses to override the behaviour of e.g. a + b where one of a or b is an instance of Set. This also means that any non-Set Basic subclasses can not depend on Expr.__add__ to create Union(a, b): if a class is not a subclass of Set and wants to define binary operations with Set it must do so explicitly in its own __add__ method. For classes depending on this this is not a backward compatible change. (#18116 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * SetExpr._eval_func() is fixed so that ImageSets with linear maps involving complex numbers are now instantiated correctly. (#18062 by @gschintgen)
      * The logic for the Set.is_subset method is made correct. This prevents incorrectly returning True or False but also means that the method returns None more often in cases where a determination should be possible. (#17848 by @oscarbenjamin)
      * There is a new is_finiteset property for sets which is a fuzzy bool indicating whether a set has a finite number of elements. (#17848 by @oscarbenjamin)
    > simplify
      * collect is more careful not to make invalid collection (e.g. factoring Rational out of a power's exponent) (#19165 by @smichr)

Wed Jan 15 09:50:57 UTC 2020 - Benedikt Fein <benedikt.fein@gmail.com>

- version update to 1.5.1
  + Deprecate `is_EmptySet` in favor of `is_empty`
  + Lambda now requires a tuple rather than a list for the
    signature argument (non-tuple iterables are deprecated)
  + Eq(expr) now raises ValueError. Eq(expr, 0) should be used
    instead.
  + Refactory of the units module. Scale factors and dimensions
    are now both global and relative to single unit systems.
  + get_dixon_matrix() now computes only the necessary monomials
    for the Dixon matrix.
  + The ProductSet of no sets is no longer the empty set. Instead
    is the set consisting of the empty tuple.
  + Deprecated tensorhead() and tensorsymmetry() static methods.
  + Rational, irrational, transcendental and algebraic now imply
    finite in the assumptions system. This means that all symbols
    declared as rational, integer, odd etc are now automatically
    assumed finite.
  + In the (old) assumptions, `complex=True` now implies
    `finite=True`. Note that the default assumption for Symbol is
    `complex=None`, which allows for the possibility for it to be
    infinite.
  + The assumptions system is changed so that only finite numbers
    can be considered real, positive, negative, nonnegative,
    nonpositive or nonzero (since nonzero implies real). This
    means that any symbol declared with e.g. real=True is now
    automatically considered finite. It also means that infinities
    can not be considered positive or negative since they are not
    real (e.g. oo.is_positive is now False).
  + New assumptions extended_real, extended_positive etc are added
    that allow for positive and negative infinity. The equivalent
    of `Symbol('x', real=True)` in version 1.4 is now
    `Symbol('x', extended_real=True)`. The equivalent of
    `Symbol('x', negative=False)` is now
    `Symbol('x', extended_negative=False)` although it is usually
    better to use `Symbol('x', nonnegative=True)` (which implies
    both real=True and finite=True as well). Code that previously
    checked `if x.is_positive` should now be written as
    `if x.is_extended_positive` if it is intended that infinities
    should be allowed.
  + Numbers still compare the same as they do in Python
    (`Float(1) == 1`) except when they appear in an Expression,
    e.g. `x**2.0 != x**2`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 17 12:28:18 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.4
  + Logic expressions with relations can now be simplifed in a
    better way which has impact on e.g. simplification of
    piecewise expressions
  + The MathML Presentation printer has seen a major improvement
    with support configuration and about a hundred new functions.
  + Union and Intersection have been improved to, among other
    improvements, support Python sets.
  + The test procedure has been changed to include code coverage
    and code quality checks leading to a number of issues being
    identified and removed.
  + Unicode support, especially for Python 2.7, has been improved.
  + subs and Subs have been improved in a number of ways.
  + SymPy objects now renders as LaTeX automatically in Jupyter
    notebooks. init_printing is still required to LaTeX render
    non-SymPy objects such as lists of expressions or Python ints

Fri Mar  7 04:13:14 UTC 2014 - arun@gmx.de

-  update to version 0.7.5

  Major changes:
  * The version of mpmath included in SymPy has been updated to 0.18.
  * New routines for efficiently compute the dispersion of a polynomial or a pair thereof.
  * Fancy indexing of matrices is now provided, e.g. A[:, [1, 2, 5]] selects all rows and only 3 columns.

  * Enumeration of multiset partitions is now based on an
    implementation of Algorithm 7.1.2.5M from Knuth's The Art of
    Computer Programming. The new version is much faster, and includes
    fast methods for enumerating only those partitions with a
    restricted range of sizes, and counting multiset partitions. (See
    the new file sympy.utilities.enumerative.py.)
  * distance methods were added to Line and Ray to compute the shortest distance to them from a point.
  * The normal_lines method was added to Ellipse to compute the lines from a point that strike the Ellipse at a normal angle.
  * inv_quick and det_quick were added as functions in solvers.py to
    facilitate fast solution of small symbolic matrices; their use in
    solve has reduced greatly the time needed to solve such systems.
  * solve_univariate_inequality has been added to sympy.solvers.inequalities.py.
  * as_set attribute for Relationals and Booleans has been added.
  * Several classes and functions strictly associated with vector
    calculus were moved from sympy.physics.mechanics to a new package
    sympy.physics.vector. (PRs #2732 #2862 #2894)
  * New implementation of the Airy functions Ai and Bi and their
    derivatives Ai' and Bi' (called airyai, airybi, airyaiprime and
    airybiprime, respectively). Most of the usual features of SymPy
    special function are present. Notable exceptions are Gruntz limit
    computation helpers and meijerg special functions integration
    code.
  * Euler-Lagrange equations (function euler_equations) in a new package sympy.calculus (PR #2431).

  Minor changes:
  * Some improvements to the gamma function.
  * generate_bell now generates correct permutations for any number of elements.
  * It is no longer necessary to provide nargs to objects subclassed
    from Function unless an eval class method is not defined. (If eval
    is defined, the number of arguments will be inferred from its
    signature.)
  * geometric Point creation will be faster since simplification is done only on Floats
  * Some improvements to the intersection method of the Ellipse.
  * solutions from solve of equations involving multiple log terms are more robust
  * idiff can now return higher order derivatives
  * Added to_matrix() method to sympy.physics.vector.Vector and
    sympy.physics.dyadic.Dyadic. (PR #2686).
  * Printing improvements for sympy.physics.vector objects and
    mechanics printing. (PRs #2687, #2728, #2772, #2862, #2894)
  * Functions with LaTeX symbols now print correct LaTeX. (PR #2772)
  * init_printing has several new options, including a flag
    print_builtin to prevent SymPy printing of basic Python types (PR
    #2683), and flags to let you supply custom printers (PR #2894).
  * improvements in evaluation of imageset for Intervals (PR #2723).
  * Set properties to determine boundary and interior (PR #2744).
  * input to a function created by lambdify no longer needs to be flattened.

  Backwards compatibility breaks and deprecations:
  * the submatrix method of matrices was removed; access the
    functionality by providing slices or list of rows/columns to
    matrix directly, e.g. A[:, [1, 2]].
  * Matrix([]) and Matrix([[]]) now both return a 0x0 matrix
  * terms_gcd no longer removes a -1.0 from expressions
  * extract_multiplicatively will not remove a negative Number from a
    positive one, so (4*x*y).extract_multiplicatively(-2*x) will
    return None.
  * the shape of the result from M.cross(B) now has the same shape as matrix M.
  * The factorial of negative numbers is now zoo instead of 0. This is
    consistent with the definition factorial(n) = gamma(n + 1).
  * 1/0 returns zoo, not oo (PR #2813).
  * zoo.is_number is True (PR #2823).
  * oo < I raises TypeError, just as for finite numbers (PR #2734).
  * 1**oo == nan instead of 1, better documentation for Pow class (PR #2606).
