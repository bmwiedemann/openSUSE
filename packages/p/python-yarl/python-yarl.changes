Thu Dec  5 12:10:05 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 1.18.3:
  * Fixed uppercase ASCII hosts being rejected by :meth:URL.build()
    <yarl.URL.build> and :py:meth:~yarl.URL.with_host -- by :user:bdraco.
  * Improved performances of multiple path properties on cache miss --
    by :user:bdraco.
1.18.0:
  * Added keep_query and keep_fragment flags in the
    :py:meth:yarl.URL.with_path, :py:meth:yarl.URL.with_name and
    :py:meth:yarl.URL.with_suffix methods, allowing users to
    optionally retain the query string and fragment in the resulting
    URL when replacing the path -- by :user:paul-nameless.
1.17.2:
  * Stopped implicitly allowing the use of Cython pre-release versions when
    building the distribution package -- by :user:ajsanchezsanz and
    :user:markgreene74.

    port when the given port was zero -- by :user:gmacon.
  * Make error messages include details of incorrect type when port is
    not int in :py:meth:~yarl.URL.build. -- by :user:Cycloctane.
  * Stopped implicitly allowing the use of Cython pre-release versions when
    building the distribution package -- by :user:ajsanchezsanz and
    :user:markgreene74.

- Update BuildRequires from requirements/test.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Joining URLs with empty segments has been changed
    to match :rfc:3986

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 12 10:35:11 UTC 2024 - Bernhard Wiedemann <bwiedemann@suse.com>

- restore correct reproducible.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 16 22:10:35 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- restore reproducible.patch to not add a random tmp path
  (boo#1062303)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 14 15:08:48 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.9.4:
  * Started raising :py:exc:`TypeError` when a string value is
    passed into :py:meth:`~yarl.URL.build` as the port argument
    -- by :user:`commonism`. Previously the empty string as port
    would create malformed URLs when rendered as string
    representations.
  * Started raising :py:exc:`TypeError` when a string value is
    passed into :py:meth:`~yarl.URL.build` as the port argument
  * Previously the empty string as port would create malformed
    URLs when rendered as string representations. (:issue:`883`)
  * The leading -- has been dropped from the PEP 517 in-tree
    build backend config setting names. --pure-python is now just
    pure-python -- by :user:`webknjaz`. The usage now looks as
    follows:  $ python -m build \     --config-setting=pure-
    python=true \     --config-setting=with-cython-tracing=true
    (:issue:`963`)
  * The leading -- has been dropped from the PEP 517 in-tree
    build backend config setting names. --pure-python is now just
    pure-python -- by :user:`webknjaz`.
  * It is now possible to request line tracing in Cython builds
    using the with-cython-tracing PEP 517 config setting --
    :user:`webknjaz`. This can be used in CI and development
    environment to measure coverage on Cython modules, but is not
    normally useful to the end-users or downstream packagers.
    Here's a usage example:  $ python -Im pip install . --config-
    settings=with-cython-tracing=true  For editable installs,
    this setting is on by default. Otherwise, it's off unless
    requested explicitly. (:issue:`962`)
