Thu Sep 26 10:40:19 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.2.2:
  * Revert the change introduced in (issue #276) attempting to pickle functions annotations for Python 3.4 to 3.6. It is not possible to pickle complex typing constructs for those versions (see issue #193)
  * Fix a bug affecting bound classmethod saving on Python 2. (issue #288)
  * Add support for pickling "getset" descriptors (issue #290)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- version update to 1.2.1
    * Restore (partial) support for Python 3.4 for downstream projects that have LTS versions that would benefit from cloudpickle bug fixes.
    * Leverage the C-accelerated Pickler new subclassing API (available in Python 3.8) in cloudpickle. This allows cloudpickle to pickle Python objects up to 30 times faster. (issue #253)
    * Support pickling of classmethod and staticmethod objects in python2. arguments. (issue #262)
    * Add support to pickle type annotations for Python 3.5 and 3.6 (pickling type annotations was already supported for Python 3.7, Python 3.4 might also work but is no longer officially supported by cloudpickle) (issue #276)
    * Internal refactoring to proactively detect dynamic functions and classes when pickling them. This refactoring also yields small performance improvements when pickling dynamic classes (~10%) (issue #273)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 21 11:38:21 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.1.1 
  * Support the pickling of interactively-defined functions with 
    positional-only arguments.
  * Track the provenance of dynamic classes and enums.
  * Fix a bug making functions with keyword-only arguments forget 
    the default values of these arguments after being pickled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 14:20:54 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.1:
  * Fix a bug (already present before 0.5.3 and re-introduced in 0.8.0) affecting relative import instructions inside depickled functions (issue #254)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  7 13:00:07 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.0:
  * Add support for pickling interactively defined dataclasses. (issue #245)
  * Global variables referenced by functions pickled by cloudpickle are now unpickled in a new and isolated namespace scoped by the CloudPickler instance. This restores the (previously untested) behavior of cloudpickle prior to changes done in 0.5.4 for functions defined in the __main__ module, and 0.6.0/1 for other dynamic functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  5 15:42:55 UTC 2019 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 0.7.0:
  * Correctly serialize dynamically defined classes that have a __slots__
    attribute. (issue #225)
- Update to version 0.6.1
  * Fix regression in 0.6.0 which breaks the pickling of local function
    defined in a module, making it impossible to access builtins. (issue #211)
- Update to version 0.6.0
  * Ensure that unpickling a function defined in a dynamic module several
    times sequentially does not reset the values of global variables.
    (issue #187)
  * Restrict the ability to pickle annotations to python3.7+ (issue #193
    and issue #196)
  * Stop using the deprecated imp module under Python 3. (issue #207)
  * Fixed pickling issue with singleton types NoneType, type(...) and
    type(NotImplemented) (issue #209)
- Update to version 0.5.6
  * Ensure that unpickling a locally defined function that accesses the global
    variables of a module does not reset the values of the global variables if
    they are already initialized. (issue #187)
- Update to version 0.5.5
  * Fixed inconsistent version in cloudpickle.__version__.
- Update to version 0.5.4
  * Fixed a pickling issue for ABC in python3.7+ (issue #180).
  * Fixed a bug when pickling functions in __main__ that access global
    variables (issue #187).

- Fix runtime dependencies and raise numpy requirement

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 14 19:14:34 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.5.3:
  * Fixed a crash in Python 2 when serializing non-hashable
    instancemethods of built-in types (issue #144).
  * itertools objects can also pickled (PR #156).
  * logging.RootLogger can be also pickled (PR #160).

Wed Nov 22 19:42:07 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.5.2:
  * Fixed a regression: AttributeError when loading pickles that hold
    a reference to a dynamically defined class from the __main__
    module. (issue #131).
  * Make it possible to pickle classes and functions defined in faulty
    modules that raise an exception when trying to look-up their
    attributes by name.

  * Allow pickling Logger objects
  * Fix crash when pickling dynamic class cycles
