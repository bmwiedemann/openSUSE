    * Restore (partial) support for Python 3.4 for downstream projects that have LTS versions that would benefit from cloudpickle bug fixes.
    * Leverage the C-accelerated Pickler new subclassing API (available in Python 3.8) in cloudpickle. This allows cloudpickle to pickle Python objects up to 30 times faster. (issue #253)
    * Support pickling of classmethod and staticmethod objects in python2. arguments. (issue #262)
    * Add support to pickle type annotations for Python 3.5 and 3.6 (pickling type annotations was already supported for Python 3.7, Python 3.4 might also work but is no longer officially supported by cloudpickle) (issue #276)
    * Internal refactoring to proactively detect dynamic functions and classes when pickling them. This refactoring also yields small performance improvements when pickling dynamic classes (~10%) (issue #273)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  7 13:00:07 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.0:
  * Add support for pickling interactively defined dataclasses. (issue #245)
  * Global variables referenced by functions pickled by cloudpickle are now unpickled in a new and isolated namespace scoped by the CloudPickler instance. This restores the (previously untested) behavior of cloudpickle prior to changes done in 0.5.4 for functions defined in the __main__ module, and 0.6.0/1 for other dynamic functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  5 15:42:55 UTC 2019 - alarrosa@suse.com

  * Ensure that unpickling a function defined in a dynamic module several
    times sequentially does not reset the values of global variables.
    (issue #187)

    and issue #196)

    they are already initialized. (issue #187)

  * Fixed inconsistent version in cloudpickle.__version__.
- Update to version 0.5.4
