  <title>Tree interface to XML documents</title>
  <description>XML::Twig is (yet another!) XML transformation module.

Its strong points: can be used to process huge documents while still
being in tree mode; not bound by DOM or SAX, so it is very perlish and
offers a very comprehensive set of methods; simple to use; DWIMs as
much as possible

What it doesn't offer: full SAX support (it can export SAX, but only
reads XML), full XPath support (unless you use XML::Twig::XPath), nor
DOM support.

Other drawbacks: it is a big module, and with over 500 methods
available it can be a bit overwhelming. A good starting point is the
tutorial at http://xmltwig.com/xmltwig/tutorial/index.html. In fact the
whole XML::Twig page at http://xmltwig.com/xmltwig/ has plenty of
information to get you started with XML::Twig</description>
