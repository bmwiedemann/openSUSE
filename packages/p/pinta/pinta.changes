    + The transform tools can now rotate in fixed increments by holding Shift (#134).
    + The Move Selected tool can now scale by holding Ctrl (#138).
    + Dragging and dropping a URL (e.g. image from a web browser) to download and open the image is now supported (#80, #644123).
    + Performance improvements when interacting with selections, particularly for large images (#1428740).
    + The Rectangle Select tool now shows different arrow cursors at each corner of the selection (#1188143).
    + Added an AppData file for integration with some Linux app stores (#121).
    + A new user guide has been written for the Pinta website! Thanks to @jeneira94, @akaro2424, and @anadvu for their contributions!

  * Changes

    + .NET 4.5 / Mono 4.0 are now required.
    + Mono 6.x is strongly recommended for Mac and Linux users.
    + UI improvements to the New Image dialog (#99, [1424547).
    + The Rotate / Zoom dialog now rotates in-place instead of changing the layer's size.
    + Cairo blend operations are now used instead of PDN's managed blend modes (#98, #1248933, #1091910).
    + The tool windows can now only be closed with the View -> Tool Windows menu, as it was easy to accidentally close them without knowing how to recover them (#1428720).
    + The shortcut for the Intersect selection mode is now Alt + Left Click instead of using Shift, which had caused conflicts with holding Shift to constrain the selection to a square (#1426660).

  * Bug Fixes

    + Fixed many issues where selection changes did not update correctly (#1438022, #1188924, #1429830, #1098137, #105).
    + Fixed incorrect behaviour when using the Shift key to constrain to a square or circle in the Rectangle and Ellipse tools (#1452607).
    + The option to expand the canvas when pasting an image now only changes the canvas size in the dimension where the pasted image is larger (#1883623).
    + Fixed a bug where Auto Crop used the current layer instead of the entire image when deciding what to crop, and takes the selection into account (#1434928, #1434906).
    + Fixed potential crashes when switching tools without any open documents (#1425612).
    + Fixed a potential bug where the OK button in the New Image dialog could be incorrectly disabled (#1430203).
    + Fixed a crash when clicking on the Open Images pad after closing all images (#1430789).
    + Fixed a bug where the Levels dialog closed unexpectedly when clicking on one of the color checkboxes (#1435045).
    + The outline width settings on the Text Tool's toolbar now only show up if they are relevant to the stroke style being used (#1426663).
    + Fixed a potential crash creating gradients (#1446217).
    + Fixed issues where the selection handles disappeared after pressing Delete (#1424629).
    + Fixed several transparency-related issues with premultiplied alpha (#109, #113, #114, #117, #125).
    + Corrected display problems in the Move Selected Tool and live previews for effects (#115).
    + Add-ins can now load icons correctly (#116).
    + Fixed strange behaviour when the width or height of a drawn rounded rectangle is 0 (#112).
    + Fixed issues with the text tool on OSX (#1425749).
    + Fixed inconsistent labels in the UI (#1579033).
    + Fixed issues with the zoom tool under certain locales (#139, #133, #1464855).

    + Fixed issues where brushes could draw outside the selection (#1775709).
    + Fixed issues with the docking library (#832395).
    + Fixed a bug where undoing a history item could set the background palette color to the foreground color (#1888131).
    + Fixed issues where the zoom level was not maintained when undoing a Crop to Selection (#1888885).
    + Fixed an error on newer Mono versions when opening URLs via the menu items under the Help menu (#1888883).
    + Fixed some occasional crashes on dragging and dropping or pasting into a new image (#1838620, #1508777).
    + Fixed issues where using the Rectangle Select tool after the Move Selection or Move Selected Pixels tools did not update correctly (#1889647, #1473430, #1889774).
    + Adjusted Pinta.Install.proj to simplify installing to a custom prefix (#781836).
