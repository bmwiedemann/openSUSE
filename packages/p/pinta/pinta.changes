- Update to 1.6:
  * New Features / Improvements:
    + Redesigned shape tools (demo video):
      - The Line tool now supports drawing curves and arrows.
      - Shapes remain editable after being drawn.
      - All shape tools now support drawing dashed lines.
    + All selection tools now support the Union, Exclude, Xor, and
      Intersection modes.
    + New community add-in repository - add-ins can be installed
      through the Add-in Manager dialog (via the Add-ins menu).
    + Redesigned New Image dialog, which includes presets,
      orientation and background options, and a thumbnail preview
      of the image.
    + The toolbox and color palette now have a flexible layout and
      can expand horizontally, making them significantly more
      usable on small screens.
    + When launching Pinta from the command line, the standard
      --version and --help options are now supported.
  * Bug Fixes:
    + Fix a number of issues with the text tool’s support for
      Unicode text.
    + Fix a number of issues with undoing selections.
    + Fix a number of untranslatable strings throughout Pinta, and
      the zoom toolbar’s percentages are now formatted using the
      current locale.
    + The text tool now supports the standard shortcuts for
      toggling bold (Ctrl+B), italic (Ctrl+I), and underline
      (Ctrl+U), and all of the text can be selected with Ctrl+A.
    + Fix a potential crash after undoing a text action.
    + Fix a crash when holding both the left and right mouse
      buttons with the Pencil tool.
    + Fix issues with zooming in very far on large images.
    + Fix a potential crash when exiting Pinta.
    + Fix issues with the toolbar’s state (hidden vs. visible) not
      being preserved after re-opening Pinta.
    + Fix several bugs where undo did not work correctly for the
      Freeform Shape tool.
    + Fix a bug where resizing a selection allowed the selection to
      grow beyond the edge of the canvas.
    + The selection handles are now larger and easier to click.
    + Fix bugs where using the Recolor tool after the Line/Curve
      tool resulted in odd behavior.
    + The error dialog now includes a link to the bug tracker.
    + Improve the error message when opening an unsupported file
      format.
    + Fix an issue where cancelling the saving of a jpg image made
      it appear that the image had actually been saved.
    + Auto-hiding now works correctly for the history and open
      images pads.
    + Auto Crop now works correctly if there is an active selection.
    + The progress dialog is now modal.
    + The Backspace and Delete keys are now usable when editing
      text fields in the toolbar.
    + Improve the readability of the text cursor against dark
      backgrounds.
