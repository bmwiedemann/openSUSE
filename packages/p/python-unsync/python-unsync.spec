# unsync
Unsynchronize `asyncio` by using an ambient event loop in a separate thread.

# Rules for unsync
1. Mark all async functions with `@unsync`. May also mark regular
   functions to execute in a separate thread.
    * All `@unsync` functions, async or not, return an `Unfuture`
2. All `Futures` must be `Unfutures` which includes the result of an
   `@unsync` function call, or wrapping `Unfuture(asyncio.Future)` or
   `Unfuture(concurrent.Future)`. `Unfuture` combines the behavior of
   `asyncio.Future` and `concurrent.Future`:
   * `Unfuture.set_value` is threadsafe unlike `asyncio.Future`
   * `Unfuture` instances can be awaited, even if made from
     `concurrent.Future`
   * `Unfuture.result()` is a blocking operation *except* in
     `unsync.loop`/`unsync.thread` where it behaves like
     `asyncio.Future.result` and will throw an exception if the future
     is not done
3. Functions will execute in different contexts:
   * `@unsync` async functions will execute in an event loop in
     `unsync.thread`
   * `@unsync` regular functions will execute in
     `unsync.thread_executor`, a `ThreadPoolExecutor`
   * `@unsync(cpu_bound=True)` regular functions will execute in
     `unsync.process_executor`, a `ProcessPoolExecutor`
