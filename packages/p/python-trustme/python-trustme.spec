%description
trustme is a Python package that provides a fake certificate
authority (CA) that can be used to generate "fake" TLS certs to use
in tests. The CA and certificates are fake in the sense of
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html, that is, the trust
circle of the CA is limited to the test environment.
