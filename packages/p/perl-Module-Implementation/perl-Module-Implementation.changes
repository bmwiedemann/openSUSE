  - Backed out the Sub::Name change in 0.08. It was pointed out to me by Graham
    Knop that adding an XS dependency for a module that's often used to pick
    between XS and non-XS implementations doesn't work so well.

  - Subroutines copied from an implementation package into the loading package
    are now renamed using Sub::Name. This causes them to be considered part of
    the loading package, which is important for things like
    namespace::autoclean. Reported by Karen Etheridge. RT #98097.

- update to 0.05 
  - Make Test::Taint an optional dependency. This module requires XS, and
    requiring a compiler for Module::Implementation defeats its
    purpose. Reported by Peter Rabbitson. RT #74817.
  - This module no longer installs an _implementation() subroutine in
    callers. Instead, you can call
    Module::Implementation::implementation_for($package) to get the
    implementation used for a given package.
