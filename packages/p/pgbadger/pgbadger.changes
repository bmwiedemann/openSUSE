- update to 11.1
  - please refer to /usr/share/doc/packages/pgbadger/ChangeLog for a 
    complete list of changes. The following is just an excerpt

  - This new release breaks backward compatibility with old binary or JSON
    files. This also mean that incremental mode will not be able to read
    old binary file. If you want to update pgBadger and keep you old reports
    take care to upgrade at start of a new week otherwise weekly report will
    be broken. pgBadger will print a warning and just skip the old binary
    file.
  - From 9.0: This major release of pgBadger is a port to bootstrap 3 and
    a version upgrade of all resources files (CSS and Javascript). 
    There's also some bugs fixes and features enhancements.

  - Add support of pgbouncer syslog log file format.
  - Add support to all auto_explain format (text, xml, json and yaml).
  - Add support to %q placeholder in log_line_prefix.
  - Add jsonlog format of Michael Paquier extension, with -f jsonlog 
    pgbadger will be able to parse the log.
  - Add report of checkpoint distance and estimate.
  - Add support of AWS Redshift keywords to SQL code beautifier.
  - Add autodetection of log format in remote mode to allow remote 
    parsing of pgbouncer log file together with PostgreSQL log file.
  - Replace the SQL formatter/beautify with v3.0 of pgFormatter.
  - Add report of error class distribution when SQLState is available
    in the log_line_prefix (see %e placeholder).
  - Update SQL Beautifier to pgFormatter v1.6 code.
  - Improve error message normalization.
  - Add --normalized-only option to generate a text file containing all
    normalized queries found in a log with count.
  - Allow %c (session id) to replace %p (pid) as unique session id.
  - Add waiting for lock messages to event reports.
  - Add --start-monday option to start calendar weeks in Monday
    instead of default to Sunday.
  - Add report of top N queries that consume the most time in the 
    prepare or parse stage.
  - Add report of top N queries that consume the most time in the 
    bind stage.
  - Add report of timing for prepare/bind/execute queries parts. 
    Reported in a new "Duration" tab in Global Stats report. This 
    also fix previous report of "Total query duration" that was 
    only reporting execute total duration. 
  - Add support to RDS and CloudWatch log format, they are detected 
    automatically. You can use -f rds if pgbadger is not able to 
    auto-detect the log format.
  - Add new configuration option --month-report to be able to build 
    monthly incremental reports.
  - Add top bind queries that generate the more temporary files.
    Require log_connection and log_disconnection be activated.
  - Add --exclude-client command line option to be able to exclude log
    entries for the specified client ip. Can be used multiple time.
  - Add -H, --html-dir option to be able to set a different path where
    HTML report must be written in incremental mode. Binary files stay
    on directory defined with -O, --outdir option.
  - Add -E | --explode option to explode the main report into one
    report per database. Global information not related to a database
    are added to the postgres database report.
  - Add per database report to incremental mode. In this mode there
    will be a sub directory per database with dedicated incremental
    reports.
  - Add support to Heroku's PostgreSQL logplex format.
- needs Pod::Markdown and JSON::XS to build now
- uses additional modules during runtime: Storable, File::Spec, File::Temp
  IO::Handle, IO::Pipe, FileHandle, Socket, Encode, Text::Wrap
- new upstream URL
- disable tests on SLE, as there is no JSON::XS available
- added some cron examples in /etc/cron.d/pgbadger
