  <title>A fast PostgreSQL log analyzer</title>
  <description>pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer build for speed with fully detailed
reports from your PostgreSQL log file. It's a single and small Perl script that
aims to replace and outperform the old php script pgFouine.

By the way, we would like to thank Guillaume Smet for all the work he has done
on this really nice tool. We've been using it a long time, it was a really
great tool!

pgBadger is written in pure Perl language. It uses a javascript library to draw
graphs so that you don't need additional Perl modules or any other package to
install. Furthermore, this library gives us more features such as zooming.

pgBadger is able to autodetect your log file format (syslog, stderr or csvlog).
It is designed to parse huge log files as well as gzip compressed file.
