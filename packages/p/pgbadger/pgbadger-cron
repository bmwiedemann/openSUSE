# The following example will auto-generate an incremental report from a
# postgresql log file, which is rotated on a daily base, 
# every day at 04:00.
#
# You need the following settings in a standard postgresql-server 
# installation in /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf for this:
#   log_directory = '/var/log/pgsql'
#   log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d.log'
#   log_file_mode = 0640
#   log_rotation_age = 1d 
#   log_rotation_size = 0
#
# Once you created a new user pgbadger, you can place the script below 
#   /etc/cron.d/ 
# Please have a look at /usr/share/doc/packages/pgbadger/README.SUSE 
# for setup details.
# 
# The output will be placed below /srv/www/htdocs/pgbadger/
