    <comment>- update to 3.2.3:
  * Fixed several issues in the ``yajl2_c`` backend
    and its async generators that were only made apparent
    when running it with PyPy and/or a CPython debug build (#101).
  * Adapted ``yajl2_c`` async generators to work against PyPy 
    shortcomings
  * Fixed compilation and ``async`` support
    of the ``yajl2_c`` backend in pyhthon 3.12 (#98).
  * Check ``IJSON_BUILD_YAJL2C`` environment variable
    when building ijson to force/skip building the 
    ``yajl2_c`` backend (#102).
  * Added support for Python 3.12.
  * Fixed a memory leak in the ``yajl2_c`` backend
    triggered only when the underlying ``yajl`` functions
    reported a failure (#97).
  * New ``ijson.dump`` command-line utility
  * Fixed bug in ``yajl2_c`` backend introduced in 3.1.2
    where random crashes could occur due to an unsafe reference decrement
    when constructing the parse/items/kvitems generators (#66).
  * Mark Python 3.10 and 3.11 as explicitly supported.

    <comment>- It's using pytest and we need pytest_arch.
- disable testsuite atm as it can not find ijson itself in the
  testsuite run
- Update to 3.4.0.post0:
  - Added support for PEP 489 multi-phase initialisation and
    per-module state for our C extension, allowing us to support
    sub-interpreters with per-interpreter GIL.
  - Advertise support for free-threading python mode.
  - Removed support for Python &lt; 3.9.
  - Enhanced generators so they yield all possible results to users
    before errors are raised (#123).
  - Added `ijson.ALL_BACKENDS` constant listing all supported
    backends (which might or not be available at runtime).
  - Added a `capabilities` constant to each backend describing
    which capabilities it supports.
  - Exposing backend's name under ``&lt;backend&gt;.backend_name``, and
    default backend's name under ``ijson.backend_name``. This is
    similar to the already existing ``name`` constant, only
    slightly better named to hopefully avoid confusion.
  - Restructured source code so all code lives under `src/`, and
    the `ijson.backends._yajl2` extension under
    `src/ijson/backends/ext/_yajl2`. This allows C backend tests to
    actually run on cibuildwheel.
  - Improved performance of `parse` routine in C backend by ~4%.
  - Fixed several potential stability issues in C backend around
    correct error handling.
  - Fixed corner-case wrong behaviour of `yajl2_c` backend, which
    didn't work correctly with user-provided event names.
  - Pointing to our own fork of yajl (for when we build it
    ourselves) that contains fixes for all known CVEs (#126).
  - Removed leftover compatibility bits in the C backend.
  - Fixed potential issue with `yajl` and `yajl2` backends where
    crashes could occur at interpreter shutdown.
  - Removed tox.
  - Moved static project metadata to `pyproject.toml`.
