Wed Jul 26 06:47:55 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.2.3:
  * Fixed several issues in the ``yajl2_c`` backend
    and its async generators that were only made apparent
    when running it with PyPy and/or a CPython debug build (#101).
  * Adapted ``yajl2_c`` async generators to work against PyPy
    shortcomings
  * Fixed compilation and ``async`` support
    of the ``yajl2_c`` backend in pyhthon 3.12 (#98).
  * Check ``IJSON_BUILD_YAJL2C`` environment variable
    when building ijson to force/skip building the
    ``yajl2_c`` backend (#102).
  * Added support for Python 3.12.
  * Fixed a memory leak in the ``yajl2_c`` backend
    triggered only when the underlying ``yajl`` functions
    reported a failure (#97).
  * New ``ijson.dump`` command-line utility
  * Fixed bug in ``yajl2_c`` backend introduced in 3.1.2
    where random crashes could occur due to an unsafe reference decrement
    when constructing the parse/items/kvitems generators (#66).
  * Mark Python 3.10 and 3.11 as explicitly supported.
- drop tests_asyncio.py source - this comes in the tarball now

Fri Nov 26 16:09:20 UTC 2021 - Daniel Molkentin <daniel@molkentin.de>

- update to 3.1.4
  * Fixed bug in ``yajl2_c`` backend introduced in 3.1.0
    where ``ijson.items`` didn't work correctly
    against member names containing ``.`` (#41).
  * Python backend raises errors on incomplete JSON content
    that previously wasn't recognised as such,
    aligning itself with the rest of the backends (#42).

  Contains 3.1.3:

  * Python backed correctly raises errors
    when JSON numbers with leading zeros
    are found in the stream (#40).
  * Likewise, JSON numbers with fractions
    where the decimal point is not surrounded
    by at least one digit on both sides
    also produce an error now
    on the python backend.
  * Fixed detection of file objects
    with generator-based ``read`` coroutines
    (i.e., a ``read`` generator decorated with ``@types.coroutine``)
    for the purpose of automatically routing user calls
    done through the main entry points.
    For example, when using ``aiofiles`` objects
    users could invoke ``async for item in ijson.parse_async(f)``
    but not ``async for item in ijson.parse(f)``,
    while the latter has been possible since 3.1
    for native coroutines.

  Contains 3.1.2.post0:

  * Moved binary wheel generation
    from GitHub Actions to Travis.
    This gained us binary ARM wheels,
    wihch are becoming increasingly popular (#35)

  Contains 3.1.2:

  * Fixed minor memory leaks
    in the initialization methods
    of the generators of the ``yajl2_c`` backend.
    All generators
    (i.e., ``basic_parse``, ``parse``, ``kvitems`` and ``items``)
    in both their sync and async versions,
    were affected.

  Contains 3.1.1:

  * Fixed two problems in the ``yajl2_c`` backend
    related to `asyncio` support,
    which prevented some objects
    like those from ``aiofiles``
    from working properly (#32).
  * Ironing out and documenting some corner cases
    related to the use of ``use_float=True``
    and its side-effect on integer number parsing.

  Contains 3.1:

  * A new ``use_float`` option has been added to all backends
    to control whether ``float`` values should be returned
    for non-integer numbers instead of ``Decimal`` objects.
    Using this option trades loss of precision
    (which most applications probably don't care)
    for performance (which most application do care about).
    Historically ijson has returned ``Decimal`` objects,
    and therefore the option defaults to ``False``
    for backwards compatibility,
    but in later releases this default could change to ``True``.
  * Improved the performance
    of the ``items`` and ``kvitems`` methods
    of the ``yajl2_c`` backend
    (by internally avoiding unnecessary string concatenations).
    Local tests show a performance improvement of up to ~15%,
    but milage might vary depending on your use case and system.
  * The "raw" functions ``basic_parse``, ``parse``, ``items`` and ``kvitems``
    can now be used with different types of inputs.
    In particular they accept not only file-like objects,
    but also asynchronous file-like objects,
    behaving like their ``*_async`` counterparts.
    They also accept ``bytes`` and ``str`` objects direclty
    (and ``unicode`` objects in python 2.7).
    Finally, they also accept iterables,
    in which case they behave like the ``ijson.common.*`` functions,
    allowing users to tap into the event pipeline.
  * ``ijson.common`` routines ``parse``, ``items`` and ``kvitems``
    are marked as deprecated.
    Users should use the ``ijson.*`` routines instead,
    which now accept event iterables.
  * New ``ijson.get_backend`` function
    for users to import a backend programatically
    (without having to manually use importlib).
  * New ``IJSON_BACKEND`` environment variable
    can be used to choose the default backend to be exposed by ijson.
  * Unicode decoding errors are now reported
    more clearly to users.
    In the past there was a mix
    of empty messages and error types.
    Now the error type is always the same
    and there should always be an error messages
    indicating the offending byte sequence.
  * ``ijson.common.number`` is marked as deprecated,
    and will be removed on some later release.

  Contains 3.0.4:

  * Fixed errors triggered by JSON documents
    where the top-level value is an object containing
    an empty-named member (e.g., ``{"": 1}``).
    Although such documents are valid JSON,
    they broke basic assumptions made
    by the ``kvitems`` and ``items`` functions
    (and all their variants)
    in all backends,
    producing different types of unexpected failures,
    including segmentation faults, raising unexpected exceptions,
    and producing wrong results.

  Contains 3.0.3:

  * Fixed segmentation fault in ``yajl2_c`` backend's ``parse``
    caused by the previous fix introduced in 3.0.2 (#29).

  Contains 3.0.2:

  * Fixed memory leak in ``yajl2_c`` backend's ``parse`` functionality (#28).

  Contains 3.0.1:

  * Adding back the ``parse``, ``kvitems`` and ``items`` functions
    under the ``ijson.common`` module (#27).
    These functions take an events iterable instead of a file
    and are backend-independent (which is not great for performance).
    They were accidentaly removed in the redesign of ijson 3.0,
    which is why they are coming back.
    In the future they will slowly transition into being
    backend-specific rather than independent.

Thu Apr  9 13:11:22 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 3.0
  * Exposing backend's name under ``<backend>.backend``,
  and default backend's name under ``ijson.backend``.
  * Exposing ``ijson.sendable_list`` to users in case it comes in handy.
  * Improved the protocol for user-facing coroutines,
  where instead of having to send a final, empty bytes string
  to finish the parsing process
  users can simply call ``.close()`` on the coroutine.
  * Including C code in coverage measurements,
  and increased overall code coverage up to 99%.
  * Full re-design of ijson.
  * Initial support for ``asyncio`` in python 3.5+.
  * Exposure of underlying infrastructure implementing the push model.
  * C extension broken down into separate source files
  for easier understanding and maintenance.
  * Fixed a deprecation warning in the C backend
  present in python 3.8 when parsing Decimal values.
  * New `kvitems` method in all backends.
  Like `items`, it takes a prefix,
  and iterates over the key/value pairs of matching objects
  (instead of iterating over objects themselves, like in `items`).
  * When using python 2, all backends now return
  `map_key` values as `unicode` objects, not `str`.
  * Including more files in source distributions (#14).
  * Adjusting python backend to avoid reading off the input stream
  too eagerly (#15).
