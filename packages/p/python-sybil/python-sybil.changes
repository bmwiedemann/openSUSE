Thu Jun 13 15:36:08 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 6.1.1:
  * Fix lexing of indented blocks where embedded blank lines
    would be erroneously removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 04:09:28 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 6.1.0:
  * Add support for lexing nested fenced codeblocks in markdown.
  * Add support for tilde-delimited codeblocks in markdown.
  * Fix bug with the end offset of codeblocks in markdown.
  * Support pytest 8 and above, due to yet another breaking change in an API
    Sybil relies on.
  * Remove use of deprecated py.path.local.
  * Fix lexing of ReST directives and directives-in-comments where the
    directives were not separated by at least one newline.
  * Official support for Python 3.12 with Python 3.7 now being the minimum
    supported version.
  * sybil.parsers.rest.lexers.DirectiveLexer and
    sybil.parsers.myst.lexers.DirectiveLexer directives now have their
    options extracted as part of the lexing process.
  * Added support for MyST single-line html-style comment directives.
  * Fixed parsing of MyST directive options with no leading whitespace.
  * Fixed parsing of Markdown and MyST fenced codeblocks at the end of
    documents with no trailing newline.
  * Rework document evaluators to be more flexible and structured.
  * :ref:`skip <skip-parser>` has been reworked to check validity of operations
    and allow a reason to be provided for an unconditional skip so it can be
    highlighted as a skipped test in test runner output. The skip parsers
    are also now lexer-based.
  * Make Region.evaluator optional, removing the need for the separate
    LexedRegion class.
  * Fix bug in traceback trimming on the latest release of pytest.
  * Fixed bug in the repr of LexedRegion instances where a lexeme was None.
  * Fixed lexing of ReST directives, such as :rst:dir:`code-block`, where they
    occurred at the end of a docstring.
  * Ensure the sybil.Document.namespace in which doctests are
    evaluated always has a __name__. This is required by an implementation
    detail of typing.runtime_checkable.
  * Fix a bug that prevent r-prefixed docstrings from being correctly parsed
    from .py files.
  * The sybil.Document.namespace can now be cleared in both ReST and MyST.
  * Support for Python 3.6 has been dropped.
  * Support for pytest versions earlier than 7.1 has been dropped.
  * Switch :func:`sybil.parsers.myst.SkipParser` to use the correct comment
    character.
  * Warn about ReST and MyST doctest parsers and overlapping blocks.
  * Restructure to support lexing source languages such as ReST and MyST
    while testing examples in target languages such as Python, doctest and bash.
  * Add support for MyST examples.
- Drop patch pytest74.patch, included upstream.
- Sprinkle in multibuild to avoid a cycle.

    :attr:`~sybil.parsers.doctest.FIX_BYTE_UNICODE_REPR`.
