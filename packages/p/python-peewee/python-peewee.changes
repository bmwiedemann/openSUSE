- %python3_only -> %python_alternative

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 18 16:01:40 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- switch to PyMSQL instead of mysql-connector-python, which is the 
  default since 3.12.x and doesn't have vulnerabilities (bsc#1122204)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 11 15:56:45 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 3.13.1
  * This will be a notable release as it adds support for CockroachDB, 
    a distributed, horizontally-scalable SQL database.
  * Allow FOR UPDATE clause to specify one or more tables (FOR UPDATE OF...).
  * Support for Postgres LATERAL join.
  * Fix non-deterministic join ordering issue when using the filter() 
    API across several tables
  * Bulk insert (insert_many() and insert_from()) will now return 
    the row count instead of the last insert ID.
  * Migration extension now supports altering a column's data-type, 
    via the new alter_column_type() method.
  * Added BloomFilter.from_buffer() method for populating a bloom-filter 
    from the output of a previous call to the to_buffer() method.

- Pull in the full python for sqlite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 18 10:19:07 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.2
  * Implement hash interface for Alias instances, allowing them to be used in multi-source queries.
  * Workaround for MySQL prior to 8 and MariaDB handling of union queries inside of parenthesized expressions (like IN).
  * Be more permissive in letting invalid values be stored in a field whose type is INTEGER or REAL, since Sqlite allows this.
  * Fix for issue #1991 regarding setting intervening models to None. 
  * Fixes the Model._pk and get_id() interfaces so they no longer introduce the possibility of accidentally resolving the FK.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 08:24:43 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.0:
  * Many bugfixes to enumerate, see CHANGELOG.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 23 11:32:26 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.6:
  * Support nesting the Database instance as a context-manager. The outermost block will handle opening and closing the connection along with wrapping everything in a transaction. Nested blocks will use savepoints.
  * Add new session_start(), session_commit() and session_rollback() interfaces to the Database object to support using transactional controls in situations where a context-manager or decorator is awkward.
  * Fix error that would arise when attempting to do an empty bulk-insert.
  * Set isolation_level=None in SQLite connection constructor rather than afterwards using the setter.
  * Add create_table() method to Select query to implement CREATE TABLE AS.
  * Cleanup some declarations in the Sqlite C extension.
  * Add new example showing how to implement Reddit's ranking algorithm in SQL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 12 20:41:48 UTC 2019 - Alexei Podvalsky <avvissu@yandex.by>

- Update to 3.9.5:
  * Added small helper for setting timezone when using Postgres.
  * Improved SQL generation for VALUES clause.
  * Support passing resolution to TimestampField as a power-of-10.
  * Small improvements to INSERT queries when the primary-key is not
    an auto-incrementing integer, but is generated by the database server (eg uuid).
  * Cleanups to virtual table implementation and python-to-sqlite value conversions.
  * Fixed bug related to binding previously-unbound models to a database using a
    context manager, #1913.
- Change in 3.9.4:
  * Add Model.bulk_update() method for bulk-updating fields across multiple
    model instances. Docs.
  * Add lazy_load parameter to ForeignKeyField. When initialized with lazy_load=False,
    the foreign-key will not use an additional query to resolve the related model instance.
  * Added Model.truncate_table() method.
  * The reflection and pwiz extensions now attempt to be smarter about converting
    database table and column names into snake-case.
  * Bulk insert via insert_many() no longer require specification of the fields
    argument when the inserted rows are lists/tuples. In that case, the fields
    will be inferred to be all model fields except any auto-increment id.
  * Add DatabaseProxy, which implements several of the Database class context managers.
  * Add support for window function frame exclusion and added built-in support for the GROUPS frame type.
  * Add support for chaining window functions by extending a previously-declared window function.
  * Playhouse Postgresql extension TSVectorField.match() method supports an additional argument plain,
    which can be used to control the parsing of the TS query.
  * Added very minimal JSONField to the playhouse MySQL extension.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 24 05:54:34 UTC 2019 - Alexei Podvalsky <avvissu@yandex.by>

- Update to 3.9.3:
  * Added cross-database support for NULLS FIRST/LAST when specifying
    the ordering for a query. Previously this was only supported for
    Postgres.
  * Added EXCLUDED helper for referring to the EXCLUDED namespace
    used with INSERT...ON CONFLICT queries, when referencing values in
    the conflicting row data.
  * Added helper method to the model Metadata class for setting the
    table name at run-time. Setting the Model._meta.table_name directly
    may have appeared to work in some situations, but could lead to
    subtle bugs. The new API is Model._meta.set_table_name().
  * Enhanced helpers for working with Peewee interactively, see doc.
  * Fix cache invalidation bug in DataSet that was originally reported
    on the sqlite-web project.
  * New example script implementing a hexastore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 18 22:09:07 UTC 2019 - Alexei Podvalsky <avvissu@yandex.by>

- Update to 3.8.2:
  * The default row-type for INSERT queries executed with a non-default
    RETURNING clause has changed from tuple to Model instances. This
    makes INSERT behavior consistent with UPDATE and DELETE queries
    that specify a RETURNING clause.
  * Removing support for the table_alias model Meta option.
  * Added playhouse.shortcuts.ReconnectMixin, which can be used to
    implement automatic reconnect under certain error conditions.
  * Fix SQL generation bug when using an inline window function in
    the ORDER BY clause of a query.
  * Fix possible zero-division in user-defined implementation of
    BM25 ranking algorithm for SQLite full-text search.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  8 20:05:48 UTC 2018 - Alexei Podvalsky <avvissu@yandex.by>

- Update to 3.7.1:
  * Added table_settings model Meta option, which should be a list
    of strings specifying additional options for CREATE TABLE, which
    are placed after the closing parentheses.
  * Allow specification of on_update and on_delete behavior for
    many-to-many relationships when using ManyToManyField.
  * Fixed incorrect SQL generation for Postgresql ON CONFLICT clause
    when the conflict_target is a named constraint (rather than an
    index expression). This introduces a new keyword-argument to the
    on_conflict() method: conflict_constraint, which is currently only
    supported by Postgresql. Refs issue #1737.
  * Fixed incorrect SQL for sub-selects used on the right side of IN
    expressions. Previously the query would be assigned an alias, even
    though an alias was not needed.
  * Fixed incorrect SQL generation for Model indexes which contain SQL
    functions as indexed columns.
  * Fixed bug in the generation of special queries used to perform
    operations on SQLite FTS5 virtual tables.
  * Allow frozenset to be correctly parameterized as a list of values.
  * Allow multi-value INSERT queries to specify columns as a list of
    strings.
  * Support CROSS JOIN for model select queries.
