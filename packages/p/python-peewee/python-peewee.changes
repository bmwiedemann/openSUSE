  * Fix bug where calling `list(query)` resulted in extra
    queries, #2871

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 02:57:29 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 3.17.1:
  * Add bitwise and other helper methods to `BigBitField`, #2802.
  * Add `add_column_default` and `drop_column_default` migrator methods for
    specifying a server-side default value, #2803.
  * The new `star` attribute was causing issues for users who had a field named
    star on their models. This attribute is now renamed to `__star__`. #2796.
  * Fix compatibility issues with 3.12 related to utcnow() deprecation.
  * Add stricter locking on connection pool to prevent race conditions.
  * Add adapters and converters to Sqlite to replace ones deprecated in 3.12.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  9 15:18:54 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove unneeded BuildRequires PyMySQL and psycopg2. I checked
  that the number of tests that are run are the same.
- Fix shebangs and other rpmlint errors/warnings

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  7 14:21:31 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.17.0:
  * Only roll-back in the outermost `@db.transaction`
    decorator/ctx manager if an unhandled exception occurs.
  * Cover transaction `BEGIN` in the reconnect-mixin. Given that
    no transaction has been started, reconnecting when beginning
    a new transaction ensures that a reconnect will occur if it
    is safe to do so.
  * Add support for setting `isolation_level` in `db.atomic()`
    and `db.transaction()` when using Postgres and MySQL/MariaDB,
    which will apply to the wrapped transaction.
  * Add support for the Sqlite `SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC` function
    flag. This allows user-defined Sqlite functions to be used
    in indexes and may be used by the query planner.
  * Fix unreported bug in dataset import when inferred field name
    differs from column name.
- disable apsw from tests for sle15 - can't be build anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 16 14:40:36 UTC 2023 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Update to 3.16.3
  - Support for Cython 3.0.
  - Add flag to ManyToManyField to prevent setting/getting values
    on unsaved instances. This is worthwhile, since reading or
    writing a many-to-many has no meaning when the instance is unsaved.
  - Adds a star() helper to Source base-class for selecting all columns.
  - Fix missing binary types for mysql-connector and mariadb-connector.
  - Add extract() method to MySQL JSONField for extracting a jsonpath.
- Add %{?sle15_python_module_pythons}
- unbind to cython < 3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 13 19:59:10 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- bind to cython < 3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  1 20:04:58 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.16.2:
  * Fixes a longstanding issue with thread-safety of various
    decorators, including `atomic()`, `transaction()`,
    `savepoint()`. The context-managers are unaffected.
  * Add changes required for building against Cython 3.0 and set
    Cython language-level to 3.
  * Ensure indexes aren't added to unindexed fields during
    introspection, #2691.
  * Ensure we don't redundantly select same PK in prefetch when
    using PREFETCH_TYPE.JOIN.
  * In Sqlite migrator, use Sqlite's builtin DROP and RENAME
    column facilities when possible. This can be overridden
    by passing `legacy=True` flag.
  * This release contains backwards-incompatible changes in the
    way Peewee initializes connections to the underlying
    database driver.  Previously, peewee implemented autocommit
    semantics *on-top* of the existing DB-API transactional
    workflow. Going forward, Peewee instead places the DB-API
    driver into autocommit mode directly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  2 21:43:51 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to 3.15.4
  Raise an exception in ReconnectMixin if connection is lost while inside a transaction (if the transaction was interrupted presumably some changes were lost and explicit intervention is needed).
  Add db.Model property to reduce boilerplate.
  Add support for running prefetch() queries with joins instead of subqueries (this helps overcome a MySQL limitation about applying LIMITs to a subquery).
  Add SQL AVG to whitelist to avoid coercing by default.
  Allow arbitrary keywords in metaclass constructor, #2627
  Add a pyproject.toml to silence warnings from newer pips when wheel package is not available.
  This release has a small helper for reducing boilerplate in some cases by exposing a base model class as an attribute of the database instance.
  # old:
  db = SqliteDatabase('...')
  class BaseModel(Model):
    class Meta:
        database = db
  class MyModel(BaseModel):
    pass

  # new:
  db = SqliteDatabase('...')
  class MyModel(db.Model):
    pass

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 28 19:52:59 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to 3.15.3
  Add scalars() query method (complements scalar()), roughly equivalent to writing [t[0] for t in query.tuples()].
  Small doc improvements
  Fix and remove some flaky test assertions with Sqlite INSERT + RETURNING.
  Fix innocuous failing Sqlite test on big-endian machines.

- Update to 3.15.2
  Fix bug where field-specific conversions were being applied to the pattern used for LIKE / ILIKE operations. Refs #2609
  Fix possible infinite loop when accidentally invoking the __iter__ method on certain Column subclasses. Refs #2606
  Add new helper for specifying which Model a particular selected column-like should be bound to, in queries with joins that select from multiple sources.

  Fix bug where cockroachdb server version was not set when beginning a transaction on an unopened database.
  View commits

- Update to 3.15.0
  Rollback behavior change in commit ab43376697 (GH #2026). Peewee will no longer automatically return the cursor rowcount for certain bulk-inserts.
  This should only affect users of MySQL and Sqlite who relied on a bulk INSERT returning the rowcount (as opposed to the cursor's lastrowid).
  The rowcount behavior is still available chaining the as_rowcount() method:
  # NOTE: this change only affects MySQL or Sqlite.
  db = MySQLDatabase(...)
  # Previously, bulk inserts of the following forms would return the rowcount.
  query = User.insert_many(...)  # Bulk insert.
  query = User.insert_from(...)  # Bulk insert (INSERT INTO .. SELECT FROM).
  # Previous behavior (peewee 3.12 - 3.14.10):
  # rows_inserted = query.execute()

  # New behavior:
  last_id = query.execute()
  # To get the old behavior back:
  rows_inserted = query.as_rowcount().execute()
  This release contains a fix for a long-standing request to allow data-modifying queries to support CTEs.
  CTEs are now supported for use with INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE queries - see #2152.
  Additionally, this release adds better support for using the new RETURNING syntax with Sqlite automatically. Specify returing_clause=True when
  initializing your SqliteDatabase and all bulk inserts will automatically specify a RETURNING clause, returning the newly-inserted primary keys.
  This functionality requires Sqlite 3.35 or newer.
  Smaller changes:
  Add shortcuts.insert_where() helper for generating conditional INSERT with a bit less boilerplate.
  Fix bug in test_utils.count_queres() which could erroneously include pool events such as connect/disconnect, etc.

Sat Nov 13 20:29:16 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.14.8:
  * Returning clause can still be specified for Sqlite, however it just needs
    to be done so manually rather than having it applied automatically.
  * Fix bug in APSW extension with Sqlite 3.35 and newer, due to handling of
    last insert rowid with RETURNING. Refs #2479.

    for resolving multiple models used in a compound select query.
  * Add a lateral() method to select query for use with lateral
    joins, refs issue #2205.

  default since 3.12.x and doesn't have vulnerabilities (bsc#1122204)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 11 15:56:45 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 3.13.1

  * Workaround for MySQL prior to 8 and MariaDB handling of union queries inside of parenthesized expressions (like IN).
  * Be more permissive in letting invalid values be stored in a field whose type is INTEGER or REAL, since Sqlite allows this.
  * Fix for issue #1991 regarding setting intervening models to None.
  * Fixes the Model._pk and get_id() interfaces so they no longer introduce the possibility of accidentally resolving the FK.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 08:24:43 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.0:
  * Many bugfixes to enumerate, see CHANGELOG.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 23 11:32:26 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.6:
  * Support nesting the Database instance as a context-manager. The outermost block will handle opening and closing the connection along with wrapping everything in a transaction. Nested blocks will use savepoints.
  * Add new session_start(), session_commit() and session_rollback() interfaces to the Database object to support using transactional controls in situations where a context-manager or decorator is awkward.
  * Fix error that would arise when attempting to do an empty bulk-insert.
  * Set isolation_level=None in SQLite connection constructor rather than afterwards using the setter.
  * Add create_table() method to Select query to implement CREATE TABLE AS.
  * Cleanup some declarations in the Sqlite C extension.
  * Add new example showing how to implement Reddit's ranking algorithm in SQL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 12 20:41:48 UTC 2019 - Alexei Podvalsky <avvissu@yandex.by>

- Update to 3.9.5:
  * Added small helper for setting timezone when using Postgres.
  * Improved SQL generation for VALUES clause.
  * Support passing resolution to TimestampField as a power-of-10.
  * Small improvements to INSERT queries when the primary-key is not
    an auto-incrementing integer, but is generated by the database server (eg uuid).
  * Cleanups to virtual table implementation and python-to-sqlite value conversions.
  * Fixed bug related to binding previously-unbound models to a database using a
    context manager, #1913.
- Change in 3.9.4:
  * Add Model.bulk_update() method for bulk-updating fields across multiple
    model instances. Docs.
  * Add lazy_load parameter to ForeignKeyField. When initialized with lazy_load=False,
    the foreign-key will not use an additional query to resolve the related model instance.
  * Added Model.truncate_table() method.
  * The reflection and pwiz extensions now attempt to be smarter about converting
    database table and column names into snake-case.
  * Bulk insert via insert_many() no longer require specification of the fields
    argument when the inserted rows are lists/tuples. In that case, the fields
    will be inferred to be all model fields except any auto-increment id.
  * Add DatabaseProxy, which implements several of the Database class context managers.
  * Add support for window function frame exclusion and added built-in support for the GROUPS frame type.
  * Add support for chaining window functions by extending a previously-declared window function.
  * Playhouse Postgresql extension TSVectorField.match() method supports an additional argument plain,
    which can be used to control the parsing of the TS query.
  * Added very minimal JSONField to the playhouse MySQL extension.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 24 05:54:34 UTC 2019 - Alexei Podvalsky <avvissu@yandex.by>

- Update to 3.9.3:
  * Added cross-database support for NULLS FIRST/LAST when specifying
    the ordering for a query. Previously this was only supported for
    Postgres.
  * Added EXCLUDED helper for referring to the EXCLUDED namespace
    used with INSERT...ON CONFLICT queries, when referencing values in
    the conflicting row data.
  * Added helper method to the model Metadata class for setting the
    table name at run-time. Setting the Model._meta.table_name directly
    may have appeared to work in some situations, but could lead to
    subtle bugs. The new API is Model._meta.set_table_name().
  * Enhanced helpers for working with Peewee interactively, see doc.
  * Fix cache invalidation bug in DataSet that was originally reported
    on the sqlite-web project.
  * New example script implementing a hexastore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 18 22:09:07 UTC 2019 - Alexei Podvalsky <avvissu@yandex.by>

- Update to 3.8.2:
  * The default row-type for INSERT queries executed with a non-default
    RETURNING clause has changed from tuple to Model instances. This
    makes INSERT behavior consistent with UPDATE and DELETE queries
    that specify a RETURNING clause.
  * Removing support for the table_alias model Meta option.
  * Added playhouse.shortcuts.ReconnectMixin, which can be used to
    implement automatic reconnect under certain error conditions.
  * Fix SQL generation bug when using an inline window function in
    the ORDER BY clause of a query.
  * Fix possible zero-division in user-defined implementation of
    BM25 ranking algorithm for SQLite full-text search.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  8 20:05:48 UTC 2018 - Alexei Podvalsky <avvissu@yandex.by>

- Update to 3.7.1:
  * Added table_settings model Meta option, which should be a list
    of strings specifying additional options for CREATE TABLE, which
    are placed after the closing parentheses.
  * Allow specification of on_update and on_delete behavior for
    many-to-many relationships when using ManyToManyField.
  * Fixed incorrect SQL generation for Postgresql ON CONFLICT clause
    when the conflict_target is a named constraint (rather than an
    index expression). This introduces a new keyword-argument to the
    on_conflict() method: conflict_constraint, which is currently only
    supported by Postgresql. Refs issue #1737.
  * Fixed incorrect SQL for sub-selects used on the right side of IN
    expressions. Previously the query would be assigned an alias, even
    though an alias was not needed.
  * Fixed incorrect SQL generation for Model indexes which contain SQL
    functions as indexed columns.
  * Fixed bug in the generation of special queries used to perform
    operations on SQLite FTS5 virtual tables.
  * Allow frozenset to be correctly parameterized as a list of values.
  * Allow multi-value INSERT queries to specify columns as a list of
    strings.
  * Support CROSS JOIN for model select queries.
