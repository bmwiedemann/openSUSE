Mon Jul  1 08:15:50 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.0.21:
  * testrepository now uses ``hatch`` rather than ``pbr``.
  * setup.py testr now supports different coverage names.
  * Isolate the testrepository test suite from the chunking (or
    otherwise) behaviour of testtools' exception handlers.
  * Unexpected errors reading streams from a file repository now
    propogate the correct exception.
  * testrepository now requires at least version 0.0.11 of the
    subunit Python module.

- Fix python-python-subunit Requires version

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 16 06:22:45 UTC 2014 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to version 0.0.20:
  * Tests will be reliably tagged with worker-%d. The previous tagging logic
    had an implicit race - the tag id was looked up via a closure which gets
    the state of the pos variable at the position the overall loop has advanced
    too, not the position when the closure was created.
    (Robert Collins, #1316858)
  * Passing --subunit to all testr commands will now consistently output subunit
    v2. Previously it would output v1 for stored streams and v2 for live
    streams. (Robert Collins)
  * ``run`` was outputting bad MIME types - test/plain, not text/plain.
    (Robert Collins)
  * Test filtering was failing under python3 and would only apply the
    filters to the first test listed by discover. (Clark Boylan, #1317607)
  * Tests that are enumerated but not executed will no longer reset the test
    timing data. Enumeration was incorrectly recording a 0 timestamp for
    enumerated tests. This leads to poor scheduling after an interrupted test
    run. (Robert Collins, #1322763)
  * Version 0.0.18 of subunit is now a hard dependency - the v2 protocol solves
    key issues in concurrency and stream handling. Users that cannot use subunit
    v2 can run an older testrepository, or contact upstream to work through
    whatever issue is blocking them. (Robert Collins)
  * When list-tests encounters an error, a much clearer response will
    now be shown. (Robert Collins, #1271133)
  * The ``get_subunit_stream`` methods now return subunit v2 streams rather
    than v1 streams, preparing the way for storage of native v2 streams in
    the repository. (Robert Collins)
  * ``UI.output_stream`` is now tested for handling of non-utf8 bytestreams.
    (Robert Collins)

- fix requires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 17 17:12:34 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.0.18
  + ``run`` now accepts ``--isolated`` as a parameter, which will cause each
    selected test to be run independently. This can be useful to both workaround
    isolation bugs and detect tests that can not be run independently.

  + ``capture_ids`` in test_run now returns a list of captures, permitting tests
    that need to test multiple runs to do so.

- Require python-setuptools instead of distribute (upstreams merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 19 10:56:40 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.0.17:
 * Restore the ability to import testrepository.repository.memory on Python 2.6.
 * A new testr.conf option ``group_regex`` can be used for grouping
   tests so that they get run in the same backend runner. (Matthew Treinish)
 * Fix Python 3.* support for entrypoints; the initial code was Python3
   incompatible. (Robert Collins, Clark Boylan, #1187192)
 * Switch to using multiprocessing to determine CPU counts.
  (Chris Jones, #1092276)
 * The cli UI now has primitive differentiation between multiple stream types.
   This is not yet exposed to the end user, but is sufficient to enable the
   load command to take interactive input without it reading from the raw
   subunit stream on stdin. (Robert Collins)
 * The scheduler can now groups tests together permitting co-dependent tests to
   always be scheduled onto the same backend. Note that this does not force
   co-dependent tests to be executed, so partial test runs (e.g. --failing)
   may still fail.  (Matthew Treinish, Robert Collins)
 * When test listing fails, testr will now report an error rather than
   incorrectly trying to run zero tests. A test listing failure is detected by
   the returncode of the test listing process. (Robert Collins, #1185231)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 29 12:15:17 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.0.15:
  * Expects subunit v2 if the local library has v2 support in the subunit
  library. This should be seamless if the system under test shares the
  Python libraries. If it doesn't, either arrange to use ``subunit-2to1``
  or upgrade the subunit libraries for the system under test.
