    <comment>- Update to version 3.1.5
  + Fixed
    * a new small rendering glitch. When using an image with
      mask=None and interpolate=False the opacity of the image was
      reduced at the edges of the stimulus
- Update to version 3.1.4
  + Fixed
    * further fix to Mic for experiments created under the previous
      version (our last fix only solved the problem for new Mic
      Components being inserted)
    * fixed demo timeByFrames which was set to use Qt4 for plotting
      instead of Qt5 (which has been the default version provided
      since the switch to Python3)
    * fixed crash in the new Keyboard class caused by psychtoolbox
      lib incorrectly converting unicode characters in the device
      name that needed repackaging
    * error with Variable Component trying to save start/stop
      times (that might not exist for that variable)
    * some data could get orphaned (and not saved) by being
      collected in the outer section of a nested loop
    * when using Mouse.getPos() with retina display and
    win.units=='pix' the mouse pos was double the expected
    value
- Update to version 3.1.3
  + Fixed
    * StairHandler code from Builder was failing in 3.1 due to
      new tStartRefresh
    * data being sent to wrong method (addData not addOtherData)
    * Routines in online studies that weren't included in
      (or before) a loop were
      not having their data saved
    * Fix to audio capture error &quot;bad argument at position 0&quot;
      from Builder experiments
    * PsychoPy app didn't recognise projects that were pointing
      to gitlab ssh targets (e.g. created in terminal) 
- Update to version 3.1.2
  + Fixed
    * teething problems with new Keyboard class:
      &gt; in Builder there was stuttering of sounds and lags in frame
        timing caused by accidentally creating lots of Kyeboards
        while checking for 'escape'
      &gt; durations were being reported with correct magnitude but
        as negative values
      &gt; problem on Windows if keyboard device name contained unicode
        (that problem was actually in psychtoolbox package, now
        updated in Standalone)
      &gt; on Windows, the 'return' key was being called 'num_enter'
    * videos were not running online commit:9779579b6
    * fixed rounding error in filtering of NoiseStim
    * iohub waitKeys should act like getKeys if maxWait&lt;=0
    * error if unicode items in the new Form class
  + Added
    * videos in Builder now have a Loop playback parameter
    * Standalone distributions now include tobii-research package
- Update to version 3.1.1
  + Fixed
    * The new Keyboard class wasn't clearing all events when
      requested (e.g. at the beginning of stimulus onset)
    * Microphone on windows failed if user didn't manually set pyo
      to be preferred lib. That isn't now needed
    * pyo lib is now provided in the 64 bit Python3 Standalone (win)
    * Parallel port lib in the Windows 32-bit version wasn't
      working (installed a new dll)
    * OpenCV in Mac Standalone wasn't working (updated to be a
      package not a single file)
    * Sounds with variable duration didn't stop properly
    * Fix to JS output when useVersion was set to something
    * Cedrus XID lib is now working on Python3 (although their
      official one is yet to come)
  + Added
    * Added the loop playback parameter to Movie Components
- Update to version 3.1.0
  + Highlights:
    * Adds the new Keyboard class
    * Improved ioHub and eyetracker compatibility for Python3
      (although this is still very much in a beta state)
- Update to version 3.0.7
  + Fixed
    * local project repeatedly asking to Create New Pavlovia
      project when one already exists
    * Fixed &quot;No module named 'PyQt4'&quot; on MacOS&lt;10.10 caused by
      PyQt dropping support for Mac10.9 in PyQt5.9
    * don't allow movie-&gt;online to use units 'from experiment
      settings'
    * Py3 string/byte fixes for CRS ColorCal
    * various fixes to Japanese translations
