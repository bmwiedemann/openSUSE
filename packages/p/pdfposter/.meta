<package name="pdfposter" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Scale and tile PDF images/pages to print on multiple pages</title>
  <description>Create a large poster by building it from
multiple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
poster.
The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.

This is much like 'poster' does for Postscript files, but working
with PDF.

For more information please refer to the manpage or visit
