Wed Mar 16 08:44:59 UTC 2022 - pgajdos@suse.com

- python-mock is actually not required for build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  1 08:40:51 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add glibc-locale dependency for tests 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  5 09:13:58 UTC 2021 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Replace broken %ifpython3 macro

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 22 20:24:19 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add denose.patch, which ports the package from the dependency
  on nose to pytest (gh#bbangert/beaker#192).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 22 06:59:17 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 13:35:32 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- only recommend installation of package python-python-memcached

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 23 14:43:25 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.11.0
  * Fixed cookie path option not being properly set (`self._path`
    was removed, only `self.path` exists)
  * Documented `SameSite` option
  * Fixed cookie expiration being localised when it shouldn't.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 18 14:26:01 CEST 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Actually for working around gh#bbangert/beaker#172 it is enough
  to rm -fv tests/test.db, because the test suite apparently
  doesn't clean up after itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  1 13:36:58 UTC 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Ignore test_database tests to avoid gh#bbangert/beaker#172

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 09:08:58 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.10.1:
  * Fix issue with Redis namespace manager TTL
  * Fix for SameSite cookie option not being set in some cases
  * Fix for memcached tests on Python3
  * Redis namespace manager now supports providing a TTL for session entries that had a ``timeout`` provided.
    This will remove the need to manually clear expired sessions from the redis storage.
  * ``nsscrypto`` backend is now properly identified as providing AES support.
  * When a crypto backend doesn't support AES it will no longer crash if the ``encrypt_key`` is ``None``.
  * Session cookies will now provide support for ``SameSite`` through the ``samesite`` option. 
    By default this will be ``Lax``, but can be set to ``Strict`` or ``None`` to disable it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 16:55:30 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.9.0
  * Beaker now provides builtin ``ext:mongodb`` and ``ext:redis``
    namespace managers. Both come with a Synchronizer implemented
    on the storage backend instead of relying on file one.
  * Fixed an issue where cookie options like ``Secure``,
    ``Domain`` and so on where lost.
  * Improved support for cache entries expiration.
    NamespaceManagers that support it will expire their key
    automatically.
  * Pycryptodome can be used instead of pycrypto.
  * An issue with ``Cookie`` module import on case insensitive
    file systems should have been resolved.
  * Cryptography module is now as a crypto function provider
    instead of pycrypto

  * annotations support in @cache_region decorator
  * data_serializer parameter in Session can now specify json to
    avoid pickle security issues

    2to3 usage
  * Fixed Encrypted Cookie Session on Python3 #57
  * New pbkdf2 mobule working on Python3 #21
  * Fixed Test suite on Python 3.3 #53, #51
- additional changes from version 1.6.5:
  * @cached decorator now keeps docstring of decorated method.
  * Fix crash when Session ``accessed_time`` is not available,
    this happened when session ``encrypt_key`` was changed.
  * Fix cache regions not providing a default key length even
    though this was required and examples in the doc didn't
    provide it.
  * Fix crash when cache expire wasn't an int, this happened when
    caching options were loaded from a config file.
- remove everything related to tests:
  upstream deleted them from archive
- drop Beaker-1.6.4-setup_test.patch: only used by the tests
- do not delete the shebang of pbkdf2.py: fixed upstream

Sat Sep 22 20:26:45 UTC 2012 - os-dev@jacraig.com

- Update to 1.6.4:
  * Warning: Session hashing for encrypted sessions using PyCrypto has
    changed. This will result in sessions being invalidated upon upgrading
    if PyCrypto is used.
  * Fix bug with key_length not being coerced to a int for comparison.
  * Fix bug with cookie invalidation not clearing the cookie data.
  * Added ability to pass in cookie_path for the Session.
  * Add NSS crypto support to Beaker.
  * Fix security bug with pycrypto not securing data such that an attacker
    could possibly determine parts of the encrypted payload. See CVE-2012-3458
    <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3458>.
  * Add ability to specify schema for database-backed sessions.
  * Fix issue with long key names in memcached backend.
- Fix sed script so it removes the shebang instead of inserting "d" throughout
  the pbkdf2.py file.
- Test suite now succeeds (for Python 2 package) but didn't add it to build
  because it takes too long.
- Update URL to what is given in setup.py.

Wed Feb  1 10:43:39 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 1.6.2:
  * Updated dogpile lock so that it locks per namespace+key rather than on the
    entire namespace. (#101)
  * Added encryption option for any backend. Patch contributed by Toby Elliot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 10 10:13:51 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 1.6.1:
  * Remove stray print statement.
  * Include .app for consistency instead of requiring wrap_app.
- Changes from version 1.6:
  * Fix bug with cache_key length calculation.
  * Fix bug with how path was set so that its restored properly and propagated.
  * Fix bug with CacheMiddleware clobbering enabled setting.
  * Update option for ``cookie_expires`` so that it can now handle an integer
    which will be used as the seconds till the cookie expires.
  * Merge fix for Issue 31, can now handle unicode cache keys.
  * Add ``key_length`` option for cache regions, and for keyword args passed
    into the cache system. Cache keys longer than this will be SHA'd.
  * added runtime beaker.__version__
  * Add ``webtest_varname`` option to configuration to optionally include
    the session value in the environ vars when using Beaker with WebTest.
  * Defer running of pkg_resources to look for external cache modules
    until requested. #66
  * memcached backend uses pylibmc.ThreadMappedPool to ensure thread-local
    usage of pylibmc when that library is in use. (#60)
  * memcached backend also has ``memcache_module`` string argument, allows
    direct specification of the name of which memcache backend to use.
  * Basic container/file-based Session support working in Py3K. (#72)
  * Further Python 3 fixes
  * Added an optimization to the FileNamespaceContainer when used with 
    Session, such that the pickled contents of the file are not 
    read a second time when session.save() is called.  (#64)
  * Fixed bug whereby CacheManager.invalidate wouldn't work for a function
    decorated by cache.cache(). (#61)
  * cache decorators @cache.cache(), @cache_region() won't include first
    argument named 'self' or 'cls' as part of the cache key.  This allows
    reasonably safe usage for methods as well as functions.  (#55)
  * file backend no longer squashes unpickling errors.   This was inconsistent
    behavior versus all the other backends.
  * invalidate_corrupt flag on Session now emits a warning. (#52)
  * cache.remove_value() removes the value even if it's already marked
    'expired' (#42)
