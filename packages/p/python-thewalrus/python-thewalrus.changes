- Actually manually adding "-fopenmp" to CFLAGS allows us to use
  even the standard SUSE CFLAGS (workaround found in the same
  bug).

- Standard OpenSUSE CFLAGS break the build
  (gh#XanaduAI/thewalrus#198).

- Update to version 0.13.0.
  * Adds a new algorithm for hafnians of matrices with low rank. 
  * Adds a function to calculate the fidelity between two Gaussian
    quantum states. 
  * Adds a new module, thewalrus.random, to generate random 
    unitary, symplectic and covariance matrices. 
  * Adds new functions normal_ordered_expectation, 
    photon_number_expectation and photon_number_squared_expectation
    in thewalrus.quantum to calculate expectation values of 
    products of normal ordered expressions and number operators and
    their squares. 
  * Adds the function hafnian_sample_graph_rank_one in 
    thewalrus.samples to sample from rank-one adjacency matrices. 
  * Adds parallelization support using Dask for 
    quantum.probabilities. 
  * Removes support for Python 3.5. 
  * Changes in the interface and speed ups in the functions in the 
    thewalrus.fock_gradients module.
  * Improves documentation of the multidimensional Hermite 
    polynomials.
  * Improves speed of fock_tensor when the symplectic matrix passed 
    is also orthogonal. 
  * Fixes Numba decorated functions not rendering properly in the 
    documentation. 
  * Solves the issue with quantum and samples not being rendered in
    the documentation or the TOC. 
  * Fix bug where quantum and samples were not showing up in the 
    documentation.
  * The functions in thewalrus.fock_gradients are now separated 
    into functions for the gradients and the gates. Moreover, they 
    are renamed, for instance Dgate becomes displacement and its
    gradient is now grad_displacement.
