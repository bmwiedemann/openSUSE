- Disable build for python 3.6 because numpy does not support it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 26 07:51:50 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 0.14.0.
  * New features
    * Adds the function find_classical_subsystem that tries to find
      a subset of the modes with a classical covariance matrix.
    * Adds the functions mean_number_of_clicks and 
      variance_number_of_clicks that calculate the first and second 
      statistical moments of the total number of clicks in a 
      Gaussian state centered at the origin. 
    * Adds the module decompositions with the function williamson 
      to find the Williamson decomposition of an even-size 
      positive-semidefinite matrix. 
    * Adds the loop_hafnian_quad function to the Python interface 
      for converting double precision matrices into quad precision, 
      doing the calculations in quad precision, and then return the 
      result as a double. 
  * Improvements
    * Introduces a new faster and significantly more accurate 
      algorithm to calculate power traces allowing to speed up the 
      calculation of loop hafnians 
    * The quantum module has been refactored and organized into 
      sub-modules. Several functions have been renamed, while the 
      old names are being deprecated. 
    * Adds support for C++14 
    * pytest-randomly is added to the test suite to improve testing 
      and avoid stochastically failing tests. 
    * Modifies the function input_validation to use np.allclose for
      checking the symmetry of the input matrices.
    * Modifies the function _hafnian to calculate efficiently loop 
      hafnians of diagonal matrices.
  * Breaking changes
    * Removes the redundant function normal_ordered_complex_cov.
    * Renames the function mean_number_of_clicks to be 
      mean_number_of_click_graph.

- Actually manually adding "-fopenmp" to CFLAGS allows us to use
  even the standard SUSE CFLAGS (workaround found in the same
  bug).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 15:08:09 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Standard OpenSUSE CFLAGS break the build
  (gh#XanaduAI/thewalrus#198).

- Fix spec file typo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 11 20:38:18 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 0.13.0.
  * Adds a new algorithm for hafnians of matrices with low rank. 
  * Adds a function to calculate the fidelity between two Gaussian
    quantum states. 
  * Adds a new module, thewalrus.random, to generate random 
    unitary, symplectic and covariance matrices. 
  * Adds new functions normal_ordered_expectation, 
    photon_number_expectation and photon_number_squared_expectation
    in thewalrus.quantum to calculate expectation values of 
    products of normal ordered expressions and number operators and
    their squares. 
  * Adds the function hafnian_sample_graph_rank_one in 
    thewalrus.samples to sample from rank-one adjacency matrices. 
  * Adds parallelization support using Dask for 
    quantum.probabilities. 
  * Removes support for Python 3.5. 
  * Changes in the interface and speed ups in the functions in the 
    thewalrus.fock_gradients module.
  * Improves documentation of the multidimensional Hermite 
    polynomials.
  * Improves speed of fock_tensor when the symplectic matrix passed 
    is also orthogonal. 
  * Fixes Numba decorated functions not rendering properly in the 
    documentation. 
  * Solves the issue with quantum and samples not being rendered in
    the documentation or the TOC. 
  * Fix bug where quantum and samples were not showing up in the 
    documentation.
  * The functions in thewalrus.fock_gradients are now separated 
    into functions for the gradients and the gates. Moreover, they 
    are renamed, for instance Dgate becomes displacement and its
    gradient is now grad_displacement.
