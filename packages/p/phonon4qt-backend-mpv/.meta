  <title>Phonon Backend using MPV Player(libmpv)</title>
  <description>This is a fork of phonon-vlc, rewritten to work with libmpv instead of
libVLC. libmpv supports less features than VLC but they are only
related to memory streams and audio/video dumps. This backend should be
a lightweight alternative to libVLC with less dependencies.</description>
