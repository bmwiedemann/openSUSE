  * Fixed a bug where user-set timeout values were not being passed to base client from service client
    and remained `None`. This has been fixed in all clients except the upload manager and multipart
    object assembler.
  * Parameter `vcn_id` changed from required to optional in methods `list_dhcp_options`,
    `list_local_peering_gateways`, `list_route_tables`, `list_security_lists`, `list_subnets`
     and `list_internet_gateways` in the virtual network client. If the VCN ID is not provided,
     then the list includes information of all VCNs in the specified compartment.
  * For upload manager and multipart object assembler, the timeout for the object storage client
    is overwritten to `None` for all operations which call object storage. For this reason, the
    operations are NOT thread-safe, and you should provide the class with its own Object Storage
    client that isn't used elsewhere.
