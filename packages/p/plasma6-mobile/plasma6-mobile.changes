  * widgets/mediacontrols: Ensure multiplexer does not show Fixes https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-mobile/-/issues/261
  * envmanager: Set Placement mode for KWin to skip window maximize animation when not in docked mode We can use the placement mode setting in KWin to bypass the need to "maximize" after the window opens, KWin does this for us.

  * initialstart/time: Fix search box getting unfocused on every key press Fixes https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-mobile/-/issues/288
