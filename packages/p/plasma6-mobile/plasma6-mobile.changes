  * widgets/mediacontrols: Ensure multiplexer does not show Fixes https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-mobile/-/issues/261
  * envmanager: Set Placement mode for KWin to skip window maximize animation when not in docked mode We can use the placement mode setting in KWin to bypass the need to "maximize" after the window opens, KWin does this for us.
  * taskswitcher: Fix navigation panel position when in landscape mode It used to get confused when in landscape mode, but the navigation panel is on the bottom of the screen.
  * initialstart/time: Fix search box getting unfocused on every key press Fixes https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-mobile/-/issues/288

  * Fix low inertia scrolling with shell flickables See https://invent.kde.org/teams/plasma-mobile/issues/-/issues/273

  * homescreens/folio: Delete empty page at end if last delegate is deleted
