- update to 3.8.3:
  * Increased the upper boundary of the :doc:`multidict:index` dependency
    to allow for the version 6 -- by :user:`hugovk`.
  * Added support for registering :rfc:`OPTIONS <9110#OPTIONS>`
    HTTP method handlers via :py:class:`~aiohttp.web.RouteTableDef`.
  * Started supporting :rfc:`authority-form <9112#authority-form>` and
    :rfc:`absolute-form <9112#absolute-form>` URLs on the server-side.
  * Fixed Python 3.11 incompatibilities by using Cython 0.29.25.
  * Extended the ``sock`` argument typing declaration of the
    :py:func:`~aiohttp.web.run_app` function as optionally
    accepting iterables.
  * Fixed a regression where :py:exc:`~asyncio.CancelledError`
    occurs on client disconnection.
  * Started exporting :py:class:`~aiohttp.web.PrefixedSubAppResource`
    under :py:mod:`aiohttp.web` -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.
  * Dropped the :class:`object` type possibility from
    the :py:attr:`aiohttp.ClientSession.timeout`
    property return type declaration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 27 19:01:09 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Add ignore-pytest-deprecationwarning.patch
  * gh#aio-libs/aiohttp#6663

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 11 19:18:47 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 3.8.1
  * Bugfixes
  * Fix the error in handling the return value of getaddrinfo.
    getaddrinfo will return an (int, bytes) tuple, if CPython could
    not handle the address family. It will cause a index out of
    range error in aiohttp. For example, if user compile CPython
    with --disable-ipv6 option but his system enable the ipv6.
    #5901
  * Do not install "examples" as a top-level package. #6189
  * Restored ability to connect IPv6-only host. #6195
  * Remove Signal from __all__, replace aiohttp.Signal with
    aiosignal.Signal in docs #6201
  * Made chunked encoding HTTP header check stricter. #6305
  * Improved Documentation
  * update quick starter demo codes. #6240
  * Added an explanation of how tiny timeouts affect performance to
    the client reference document. #6274
  * Add flake8-docstrings to flake8 configuration, enable subset of
    checks. #6276
  * Added information on running complex applications with
    additional tasks/processes -- :user:`Dreamsorcerer`. #6278
- Release 3.8.0 (2021-10-31)
  * Features
  * Added a GunicornWebWorker feature for extending the aiohttp
    server configuration by allowing the 'wsgi' coroutine to return
    web.AppRunner object. #2988
  * Switch from http-parser to llhttp #3561
  * Use Brotli instead of brotlipy #3803
  * Disable implicit switch-back to pure python mode. The build
    fails loudly if aiohttp cannot be compiled with C Accelerators.
    Use AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 to explicitly disable C Extensions
    complication and switch to Pure-Python mode. Note that
    Pure-Python mode is significantly slower than compiled one.
    #3828
  * Make access log use local time with timezone #3853
  * Implemented readuntil in StreamResponse #4054
  * FileResponse now supports ETag. #4594
  * Add a request handler type alias aiohttp.typedefs.Handler.
    #4686
  * AioHTTPTestCase is more async friendly now.
  * For people who use unittest and are used to use
    :py:exc:`~unittest.TestCase` it will be easier to write new
    test cases like the sync version of the
    :py:exc:`~unittest.TestCase` class, without using the decorator
    @unittest_run_loop, just async def test_*. The only difference
    is that for the people using python3.7 and below a new
    dependency is needed, it is asynctestcase. #4700
  * Add validation of HTTP header keys and values to prevent header
    injection. #4818
  * Add predicate to AbstractCookieJar.clear. Add
    AbstractCookieJar.clear_domain to clean all domain and
    subdomains cookies only. #4942
  * Add keepalive_timeout parameter to web.run_app. #5094
  * Tracing for client sent headers #5105
  * Make type hints for http parser stricter #5267
  * Add final declarations for constants. #5275
  * Switch to external frozenlist and aiosignal libraries. #5293
  * Don't send secure cookies by insecure transports.
  * By default, the transport is secure if https or wss scheme is
    used. Use CookieJar(treat_as_secure_origin="http://127.0.0.1")
    to override the default security checker. #5571
  * Always create a new event loop in aiohttp.web.run_app(). This
    adds better compatibility with asyncio.run() or if trying to
    run multiple apps in sequence. #5572
  * Add aiohttp.pytest_plugin.AiohttpClient for static typing of
    pytest plugin. #5585
  * Added a socket_factory argument to BaseTestServer. #5844
  * Add compression strategy parameter to enable_compression
    method. #5909
  * Added support for Python 3.10 to Github Actions CI/CD workflows
    and fix the related deprecation warnings -- :user:`Hanaasagi`.
    #5927
  * Switched chardet to charset-normalizer for guessing the HTTP
    payload body encoding -- :user:`Ousret`. #5930
  * Added optional auto_decompress argument for HttpRequestParser
    #5957
  * Added support for HTTPS proxies to the extent CPython's
    :py:mod:`asyncio` supports it -- by :user:`bmbouter`,
    :user:`jborean93` and :user:`webknjaz`. #5992
  * Added base_url parameter to the initializer of
    :class:`~aiohttp.ClientSession`. #6013
  * Add Trove classifier and create binary wheels for 3.10. --
    :user:`hugovk`. #6079
  * Started shipping platform-specific wheels with the musl tag
    targeting typical Alpine Linux runtimes — :user:`asvetlov`.
    #6139
  * Started shipping platform-specific arm64 wheels for Apple
    Silicon — :user:`asvetlov`. #6139
  * Bugfixes
  * Modify _drain_helper() to handle concurrent await
    resp.write(...) or ws.send_json(...) calls without
    race-condition. #2934
  * Started using MultiLoopChildWatcher when it's available under
    POSIX while setting up the test I/O loop. #3450
  * Only encode content-disposition filename parameter using
    percent-encoding. Other parameters are encoded to quoted-string
    or RFC2231 extended parameter value. #4012
  * Fixed HTTP client requests to honor no_proxy environment
    variables. #4431
  * Fix supporting WebSockets proxies configured via environment
    variables. #4648
  * Change return type on URLDispatcher to UrlMappingMatchInfo to
    improve type annotations. #4748
  * Ensure a cleanup context is cleaned up even when an exception
    occurs during startup. #4799
  * Added a new exception type for Unix socket client errors which
    provides a more useful error message. #4984
  * Remove Transfer-Encoding and Content-Type headers for 204 in
    StreamResponse #5106
  * Only depend on typing_extensions for Python <3.8 #5107
  * Add ABNORMAL_CLOSURE and BAD_GATEWAY to WSCloseCode #5192
  * Fix cookies disappearing from HTTPExceptions. #5233
  * StaticResource prefixes no longer match URLs with a non-folder
    prefix. For example routes.static('/foo', '/foo') no longer
    matches the URL /foobar. Previously, this would attempt to load
    the file /foo/ar. #5250
  * Acquire the connection before running traces to prevent race
    condition. #5259
  * Add missing slots to `_RequestContextManager and
    _WSRequestContextManager #5329
  * Ensure sending a zero byte file does not throw an exception
    (round 2) #5380
  * Set "text/plain" when data is an empty string in client
    requests. #5392
  * Stop automatically releasing the ClientResponse object on calls
    to the ok property for the failed requests. #5403
  * Include query parameters from params keyword argument in
    tracing URL. #5432
  * Fix annotations #5466
  * Fixed the multipart POST requests processing to always release
    file descriptors for the tempfile.Temporaryfile-created
    _io.BufferedRandom instances of files sent within multipart
    request bodies via HTTP POST requests -- by :user:`webknjaz`.
    #5494
  * Fix 0 being incorrectly treated as an immediate timeout. #5527
  * Fixes failing tests when an environment variable <scheme>_proxy
    is set. #5554
  * Replace deprecated app handler design in
    tests/autobahn/server.py with call to web.run_app; replace
    deprecated aiohttp.ws_connect calls in tests/autobahn/client.py
    with aiohttp.ClienSession.ws_connect. #5606
  * Fixed test for HTTPUnauthorized that access the text argument.
    This is not used in any part of the code, so it's removed now.
    #5657
  * Remove incorrect default from docs #5727
  * Remove external test dependency to http://httpbin.org #5840
  * Don't cancel current task when entering a cancelled timer.
    #5853
  * Added params keyword argument to ClientSession.ws_connect. --
    :user:`hoh`. #5868
  * Uses :py:class:`~asyncio.ThreadedChildWatcher` under POSIX to
    allow setting up test loop in non-main thread. #5877
  * Fix the error in handling the return value of getaddrinfo.
    getaddrinfo will return an (int, bytes) tuple, if CPython could
    not handle the address family. It will cause a index out of
    range error in aiohttp. For example, if user compile CPython
    with --disable-ipv6 option but his system enable the ipv6.
    #5901
  * Removed the deprecated loop argument from the
    asyncio.sleep/gather calls #5905
  * Return None from request.if_modified_since,
    request.if_unmodified_since, request.if_range and
    response.last_modified when corresponding http date headers are
    invalid. #5925
  * Fix resetting SIGCHLD signals in Gunicorn aiohttp Worker to fix
    subprocesses that capture output having an incorrect
    returncode. #6130
  * Raise 400: Content-Length can't be present with
    Transfer-Encoding if both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding
    are sent by peer by both C and Python implementations #6182
  * Improved Documentation
  * Refactored OpenAPI/Swagger aiohttp addons, added aio-openapi
    #5326
  * Fixed docs on request cookies type, so it matches what is
    actually used in the code (a read-only dictionary-like object).
    #5725
  * Documented that the HTTP client Authorization header is removed
    on redirects to a different host or protocol. #5850
- Drop patches
  * backport_fix_for_setting_cookies.patch

    quotation wrapping of cookies containing special characters
  * Call AccessLogger.log with the current exception available
    from sys.exc_info()

    list of registered resources registered resource
  * Added properties of default ClientSession params to
    ClientSession class so it is available for introspection

    For example, uWSGI will not support keepalive even it serves a
    HTTP 1.1 request, except explicitly configure uWSGI with a
    ``--http-keepalive`` option.
    Servers designed like uWSGI could cause aiohttp intermittently
    raise a ConnectionResetException when the protocol poll runs
    out and some protocol is reused.

    responses.
  * Fix inconsistency between Python and C http request parsers
    in parsing pct-encoded URL

- update to version 3.3.2:
  * Raise ``ConnectionResetError`` instead of ``CancelledError`` on trying to
    write to a closed stream. (`#2499 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2499>`_)
  * Implement ``ClientTimeout`` class and support socket read timeout. (`#2768 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2768>`_)
  * Enable logging when ``aiohttp.web`` is used as a program (`#2956 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2956>`_)
  * Add canonical property to resources (`#2968 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2968>`_)
  * Forbid reading response BODY after release (`#2983 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2983>`_)
  * Implement base protocol class to avoid a dependency from internal
    ``asyncio.streams.FlowControlMixin`` (`#2986 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2986>`_)
  * Cythonize ``@helpers.reify``, 5% boost on macro benchmark (`#2995 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2995>`_)
  * Optimize HTTP parser (`#3015 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3015>`_)
  * Implement ``runner.addresses`` property. (`#3036 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3036>`_)
  * Use ``bytearray`` instead of a list of ``bytes`` in websocket reader. It
    improves websocket message reading a little. (`#3039 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3039>`_)

  - Relax JSON content-type checking in the ``ClientResponse.json()`` to allow
    "application/xxx+json" instead of strict "application/json". (#2206)
  - Bump C HTTP parser to version 2.8 (#2730)
  - Accept a coroutine as an application factory in ``web.run_app`` and gunicorn
    worker. (#2739)

  - Close a connection if an unexpected exception occurs while sending a request
  - Fix firing DNS tracing events. (#2841)
  - Change ``ClientResponse.json()`` documentation to reflect that it now
    allows "application/xxx+json" content-types (#2206)
  - Document behavior when cchardet detects encodings that are unknown to Python.
  - Add diagrams for tracing request life style. (#2748)
  - Drop removed functionality for passing ``StreamReader`` as data at client
    side. (#2793)

      requests getting into the connector at the same time. (#2111)
    + Use request for getting access log information instead of
      message/transport pair. Add RequestBase.remote property for
      accessing to IP of client initiated HTTP request. (#2123)

      compress=15 the client will support deflate compress
      negotiation. (#2273)
    + Support verify_ssl, fingerprint, ssl_context and proxy_headers
      by client.ws_connect. (#2292)
