- Disable build for python36 because scipy dependency.
- Update to version 2.27.0.
  * Bump RPCQ dependency to 3.6.0.
  * Tests can be run in parallel.
  * Fix hanging test due to ZMQ bug.
  * Fix unitary comparison in Quil compilation test .
  * Fix parsing comments in Lark grammar.
- Updates for version 2.26.0.
  * Quil-T brings the dimension of time to your quantum programs!
  * Quil-T is an extension of Quil which allows one to develop 
    quantum programs at the level of pulses and waveforms and 
    brings an unprecedented level of fine-grained control over 
    the QPU.
  * Unpacking bitstrings is significantly faster.
  * Parsing is now performed using Lark rather than ANTLR, often 
    allowing a 10x improvement in parsing large and complex 
    programs.
  * Gates now generally allow a "formal" qubit label as in 
    DEFCIRCUIT, rather that requiring a numeric index.
  * Program objects come with additional Quil-T related properties,
    such as calibrations, waveforms, and frames.
  * The AbstractCompiler classes come with tools for performing 
    calibration of programs. Namely, get_calibration_program 
    provides a program for calibrating against recent QPU settings. 
    rewrite_arithmetic now converts phase angle from radians to 
    revolutions.
  * Readout is more permissive, and does not require the 
    destination to be named "ro".
  * The default value for QPU_COMPILER_URL has been updated to 
    point to Rigetti's translation service. This changes allows one
    to use the translation service to translate a Quil- program and
    receive the binary payload without having a QPU reservation.
- Updates for version 2.25.0.
  * Timeout configuration has been revamped. get_qc now accepts a 
    compiler_timeoutoption, and QVMCompiler and QPUCompiler provide
    a set_timeout method, which shouldgreatly simplify the task of 
    changing the default timeout. QVMCompiler also provides a 
    quilc_client property so that it shares the same interface as 
    QPUCompiler. Documentation has been updated to reflect these 
    changes.
- Updates for version 2.24.0.
  * run_and_measure now only measures the qubits that are used in a 
    program (rather than all qubits on the device) when the target
    QAM is a QVM without noise. This prevents the QVM from 
    exhausting memory when it tries to allocate for e.g. 32 qubits
    when only e.g. 2 qubits are used in the program
  * Include a py.typed so that libraries that depend on pyquil can 
    validate their typing against it
  * Fix Apache 2 license
  * Removed warnings expected in normal workflows that cannot be 
    avoided programmatically. This included the warning about 
    passing native Quil to native_quil_to_executable. Documentation 
    has been updated to clarify expected behavior.

- Initial package release.
- Disable test pyquil/api/_qvm.py, 
  pyquil/tests/test_quantum_computer.py, and 
  pyquil/api/tests/test_compiler.py as it need network connection.
