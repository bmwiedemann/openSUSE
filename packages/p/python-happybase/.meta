  <title>Grammar Parser Library for Python</title>
  <description>The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and executing
simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the use of regular
expressions. The pyparsing module provides a library of classes that client
code uses to construct the grammar directly in Python code.
