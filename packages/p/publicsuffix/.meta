  <title>Cross-vendor public domain suffix database</title>
  <description>The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative to provide
an accurate list of domain name suffixes, maintained by the hard work
of Mozilla volunteers and by submissions from registries.
Software using the Public Suffix List will be able to determine where
cookies may and may not be set, protecting the user from being
tracked across sites.
