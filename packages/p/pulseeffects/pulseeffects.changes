    plugin UI to get same space between controls and make them fit 
    all the available horizontal space.

    an icon according to input/output effects while the pipeline 
    global level meter is only shown when something is 
    recording/playing

- Update to version 4.8.0
  Added:
  * Loudness plugin has been replaced with the new Loudness
    Compensator by Linux Studio Plugins.
  * The Stereo Tools and the Maximizer plugins can now be used
    when applying effects to microphone signals.
  * New parameters have been added to the following plugins:
    Compressor, Gate and Limiter.
  * Plugin user interfaces have been redesigned with
    checkbutton list and new global output level meter for both
    output and input pipelines.
  * The user has now the ability to change the minimum and
    maximum frequency in the spectrum user interface.
  * New command line that allows to hide the window when
    running PulseEffects in service mode. This will allow tray
    applets to hide our window.
  * Initial support to Equalizer APO presets.
  * Improved Slovak and Czech Translations.
  Removed:
  * The spectrum scaling feature was removed as it leads to
    wrong mouse hover values when used
    https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/issues/733. And
    fixing this will require the addition of an amount of code
    complexity that does not seem worth it.
  Note to packagers:
  * This release is using GTKMM 3.24 features and Linux Studio
    Plugins >= `1.1.24`. If you can not use any of these
    libraries do not upgrade to PulseEffects 4.8.0!
  * MDA is not needed anymore as optional dependency.
  version 4.7.3:
  Added:
  * PulseEffects now searches for presets in /etc/PulseEffects
    and directories specified by \$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS environment
    variable.
  * Our interface now shows third party Plugins credits.
  * Each plugin now has a reset button
  * Improved convolver impulse response files plot
  * Applications entry now have a blacklist button to make it
    easier to blacklist an application the user does not want
    effects to be applied.
  Fixed:
  * Fixed a severe memory leak that happened whenever the
    window was closed.
  * PulseEffects no longer crashes when an empty or corrupted
    preset is provided.
  * Fixed laxity setting not being applied in the deesser
- Fixes boo#1171896

Wed May 20 08:28:36 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 4.7.2
  Added:
  * Compatibility to Linux Studio Plugins `1.1.14`
  * The convolver plugin now accepts the wav extension in the
    impulse files.
  * Checking exceptions in the main function.
  * Headers deprecated in Boost 1.72 were replaced.
  Notes to package maintainers: 
  * As the `bypass` property in Linux Studio Plugins `1.1.14`
    was renamed to `enabled` this new PulseEffects version
    won't work with older Linux Studio Plugins versions.
    Although I could add checks and somehow try to support both
    versions this makes the code ugly. And I think that nowadays
    upgrading LSP should not be hard. If it is do not upgrade to
    PE `4.7.2`.

- Update to version 4.6.8 (see CHANGELOG.md) 
  * It is now possible to set different buffer and latency values 
    for the pulsesrc 
    and the pulsesink plugins. 
    This means that there is more room to reduce the overall latency. 
    Pulsesrc is at the start of the effects pipeline and 
    pulsesink at its end.
