Wed Mar  3 17:55:24 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Revert the last change. pulseeffects requires the real pulseaudio
  so keep the Requires: pulseaudio (boo#1182730).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 25 11:48:57 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Require the pulseaudio-daemon capability instead of the
  pulseaudio package, so alternative implementations can be used
  (boo#1182730).

Fri Jan  8 07:01:05 UTC 2021 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Update to version 4.8.4
  Added:
  * Added Allpass filter in Equalizer plugin.
  Fixed:
  * The equalizer UI is now correctly shown when a profile with 
    30 bands is loaded at startup.
  * Added a workaround for systems that were crashing because the
    locale is not correctly set at system level.
  Note to packagers:
  * This is the last release supporting Pulseaudio. The following
    PulseEffects releases will be based on the new Pipewire
    multimedia server and only fixes to critical bugs will be
    backported to the legacy pulseaudio branch
    https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/tree/pulseaudio-legacy.
- Changes from 4.8.3
  Added:
  * New Noise Reduction plugin based on the RNNoise library.
  * Band Quality factor exposed in the Equalizer main interface.
  * A new settings was added to the general section of our settings
    menu: Activity Timeout. It is the time during which 
    PulseEffects monitors if there is any application playing audio.
    If there is none we stop our playback stream in order to save
    cpu usage. This timeout has been in place for a long time but
    until now its value could not be configured by the user.
  * When no application is playing audio PulseEffects pipeline is
    now put in the ready state instead of the paused state. This
    should help to reduce cpu usage in situations like the ones
    described in https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/issues/829
  * Updated Chinese translation.
  Fixed:
  * Values outside GTK widgets are now shown according to system
    locale settings.
  * Applying APO Equalizer preset when locale is different than "C"
    is now working properly.
  * Equalizer and Crystalizer UI redesigned: band wrapper is 
    extended to fit all the available horizontal space; homogeneous
    property has been applied to get the same space between band sliders.
  * App info and plugin interfaces made scrollable: now PulseEffects
    window does not change its size when switching beetween plugins.
  * Loudness plugin: removed reference signal button (test signals can
    be used in its stead); input value is now saved to preset.
  Note to packagers:
  * The Noise Reduction is an optional plugin. For it to be 
    available to the user the library RNNoise
    https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise has to be installed when
    PulseEffects is compiled.

Mon Sep 21 16:06:01 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 4.8.2.
  * Fix when importing Equalizer APO presets the bands were not 
    being set to the APO mode.
- Changelog from 4.8.1.
  * Blocklist adopted and related command modified as a checkbutton
    inside the app info ui.
  * Pulseaudioâ€™s media name property is shown for each application
    in the Applications section.
  * Deesser UI redesigned and applied homogeneous property to all 
    plugin UI to get same space between controls and make them fit 
    all the available horizontal space.
  * Modified Applications row in the left side plugin list to show 
    an icon according to input/output effects while the pipeline 
    global level meter is only shown when something is 
    recording/playing
  * The feature that shows the last used preset in the preset menu 
    button label was improved. When seeing input effects widget it 
    shows the last used input preset. And when seeing output 
    effects widgets it shows the last used output preset.
  * New application icon.

Sat Aug 29 09:18:17 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 4.8.0
  Added:
  * Loudness plugin has been replaced with the new Loudness
    Compensator by Linux Studio Plugins.
  * The Stereo Tools and the Maximizer plugins can now be used
    when applying effects to microphone signals.
  * New parameters have been added to the following plugins:
    Compressor, Gate and Limiter.
  * Plugin user interfaces have been redesigned with
    checkbutton list and new global output level meter for both
    output and input pipelines.
  * The user has now the ability to change the minimum and
    maximum frequency in the spectrum user interface.
  * New command line that allows to hide the window when
    running PulseEffects in service mode. This will allow tray
    applets to hide our window.
  * Initial support to Equalizer APO presets.
  * Improved Slovak and Czech Translations.
  Removed:
  * The spectrum scaling feature was removed as it leads to
    wrong mouse hover values when used
    https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/issues/733. And
    fixing this will require the addition of an amount of code
    complexity that does not seem worth it.
  Note to packagers:
  * This release is using GTKMM 3.24 features and Linux Studio
    Plugins >= `1.1.24`. If you can not use any of these
    libraries do not upgrade to PulseEffects 4.8.0!
  * MDA is not needed anymore as optional dependency.
  version 4.7.3:
  Added:
  * PulseEffects now searches for presets in /etc/PulseEffects
    and directories specified by \$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS environment
    variable.
  * Our interface now shows third party Plugins credits.
  * Each plugin now has a reset button
  * Improved convolver impulse response files plot
  * Applications entry now have a blacklist button to make it
    easier to blacklist an application the user does not want
    effects to be applied.
  Fixed:
  * Fixed a severe memory leak that happened whenever the
    window was closed.
  * PulseEffects no longer crashes when an empty or corrupted
    preset is provided.
  * Fixed laxity setting not being applied in the deesser
- Fixes boo#1171896

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 20 08:28:36 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 4.7.2
  Added:
  * Compatibility to Linux Studio Plugins `1.1.14`
  * The convolver plugin now accepts the wav extension in the
    impulse files.
  * Checking exceptions in the main function.
  * Headers deprecated in Boost 1.72 were replaced.
  Notes to package maintainers: 
  * As the `bypass` property in Linux Studio Plugins `1.1.14`
    was renamed to `enabled` this new PulseEffects version
    won't work with older Linux Studio Plugins versions.
    Although I could add checks and somehow try to support both
    versions this makes the code ugly. And I think that nowadays
    upgrading LSP should not be hard. If it is do not upgrade to
    PE `4.7.2`.
- Fixes boo#1171896

Mon Sep 23 12:02:15 UTC 2019 - Aaron Stern <ukbeast89@protonmail.com>

- Update to version 4.6.8 (see CHANGELOG.md) 
  * It is now possible to set different buffer and latency values 
    for the pulsesrc 
    and the pulsesink plugins. 
    This means that there is more room to reduce the overall latency. 
    Pulsesrc is at the start of the effects pipeline and 
    pulsesink at its end.
