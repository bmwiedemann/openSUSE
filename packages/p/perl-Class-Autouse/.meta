  <title>Run-time class loading on first method call</title>
  <description>Class::Autouse allows you to specify a class the will only load when a
method of that class is called. For large classes that might not be
used during the running of a program, such as Date::Manip, this can
save you large amounts of memory, and decrease the script load time.</description>
