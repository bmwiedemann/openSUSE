  Warning: 
  This release includes a bug fix (Bug #3887) which will rename the
  per-user storage directories for existing users when running in 
  server mode. Previously, saved SQL queries were stored under the 
  STORAGE_DIR in a sub-directory named after the username part of 
  the user’s email address. From this version onwards, the full 
  email address is used, with the @ replaced with an underscore. 
  For example, in v.4.3 with STORAGE_DIR set to /var/lib/pgadmin4 
  user files may be stored in:
    /var/lib/pgadmin4/storage/username/
  With the fix, that directory will be renamed (or created for new 
  users) as:
    /var/lib/pgadmin4/storage/username_example.com/

      UI rather than putting them in the CSV file.
    * Improve the German translation for Backup Server.
