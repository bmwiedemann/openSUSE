-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 30 04:22:43 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 4.30 
  - Features:
    - ERD Tool (Beta): The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool
      is a database design tool that provides a graphical
      representation of database tables, columns, and
      inter-relationships. You can use the ERD tool to design a new
      schema and generate the SQL required to create it, or to
      reverse engineer and diagram an existing database schema.
    - Kerberos support is added in pgAdmin 4 using SPNEGO for
      logging into pgAdmin, similar to the existing LDAP and
      "internal" options. Note that support for logging into
      database servers using Kerberos is not included in this
      release, but will be added in a future version.
    - Add a container option (PGADMIN_DISABLE_POSTFIX) to disable
      the Postfix server: Postfix (like other MTAs) must start as
      user 'root', and the pgAdmin container achieves this using
      'sudo'. Whilst that works well in most environments, it can
      cause problems in some. This option allows you to completely
      disable Postfix to avoid these issues, though you will need
      to configure an external mail server to be used to send
      password reset emails.
  - Bugs/Housekeeping:
    - Improve the explain plan details by showing a popup instead
      of a tooltip when clicking on plan nodes.
    - Ensure that verbose logs are visible for Utility (Backup,
      Maintenance etc.) jobs.
    - Added support for expressions in exclusion constraints.
    - Ensure that the 'template1' database is not visible after
      pg_upgrade.
    - Added appropriate help message and a placeholder for letting
      users know about the account password expiry for Login/Group
      Role.
    - Updated Flask-BabelEx to the latest version.
    - Fixed extra parentheses issue around joins for Views.
    - Ensure that the current value of sequences is ignored while
      comparing using Schema Diff.
    - Fixed an issue when the user tries to delete multiple records
      in the data grid.
    - Fixed TypeError exception in schema diff when selecting two
      identical objects.
    - Include PostgreSQL 13 utilities in the container
      distribution.

- Changes from pgadmin4 4.4

  Warning: 
  This release includes a bug fix (Bug #3887) which will rename the
  per-user storage directories for existing users when running in 
  server mode. Previously, saved SQL queries were stored under the 
  STORAGE_DIR in a sub-directory named after the username part of 
  the user’s email address. From this version onwards, the full 
  email address is used, with the @ replaced with an underscore. 
  For example, in v.4.3 with STORAGE_DIR set to /var/lib/pgadmin4 
  user files may be stored in:
    /var/lib/pgadmin4/storage/username/
  With the fix, that directory will be renamed (or created for new 
  users) as:
    /var/lib/pgadmin4/storage/username_example.com/

      a CREATE script using the CSV download.

      detected rather than (unreliably) on exit.
    * Display errors during CSV download from the Query Tool in the 
      UI rather than putting them in the CSV file.
    * Improve the German translation for Backup Server.
    * Ensure the toolbar buttons are properly reset following
