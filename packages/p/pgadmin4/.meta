  <title>Management tool for PostgreSQL</title>
  <description>pgAdmin 4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the PostgreSQL
(http://www.postgresql.org) database.
pgAdmin 4 is written as a web application in Python, using jQuery and Bootstrap
for the client side processing and UI. On the server side, Flask is being utilised.

Although developed using web technologies, we intend for pgAdmin 4 to be usable
either on a web server using a browser, or standalone on a workstation. The
runtime/ subdirectory contains a QT based runtime application intended to allow
this - it is essentially a browser and Python interpretor in one package which
will be capable of hosting the Python application and presenting it to the user
as a desktop application.</description>
