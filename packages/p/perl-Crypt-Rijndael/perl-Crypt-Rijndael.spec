%description
This module implements the Rijndael cipher, which has just been selected as
the Advanced Encryption Standard.

* keysize

Returns the keysize, which is 32 (bytes). The Rijndael cipher actually
supports keylengths of 16, 24 or 32 bytes, but there is no way to
communicate this to 'Crypt::CBC'.

* blocksize

The blocksize for Rijndael is 16 bytes (128 bits), although the algorithm
actually supports any blocksize that is any multiple of our bytes. 128
bits, is however, the AES-specified block size, so this is all we support.

* $cipher = Crypt::Rijndael->new( $key [, $mode] )

Create a new 'Crypt::Rijndael' cipher object with the given key (which must
be 128, 192 or 256 bits long). The additional '$mode' argument is the
encryption mode, either 'MODE_ECB' (electronic codebook mode, the default),
'MODE_CBC' (cipher block chaining, the same that 'Crypt::CBC' does),
'MODE_CFB' (128-bit cipher feedback), 'MODE_OFB' (128-bit output feedback),
or 'MODE_CTR' (counter mode).

ECB mode is very insecure (read a book on cryptography if you don't know
why!), so you should probably use CBC mode.

* $cipher->set_iv($iv)

This allows you to change the initial value vector used by the chaining
modes. It is not relevant for ECB mode.

* $cipher->encrypt($data)

Encrypt data. The size of '$data' must be a multiple of 'blocksize' (16
bytes), otherwise this function will croak. Apart from that, it can be of
(almost) any length.

* $cipher->decrypt($data)

Decrypts '$data'.
