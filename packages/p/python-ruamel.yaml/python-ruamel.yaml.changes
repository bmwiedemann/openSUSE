	 with sequence-indent minus dash-offset not equal two.

 * fix issue 62, YAML 1.2 allows ? and : in plain scalars if non-ambigious
 * fix lists within lists which would make comments disappear

 * (finally) fixed longstanding issue 23, now handling comment between block
	 mapping key and value correctly
 * warn on YAML 1.1 float input that is incorrect
 * allow setting of boolean representation (false, true)

	 and returning a string. This allows transformation of the output before
	 it is written to stream. This forces creation of the complete output in memory!
 * some updates to the docs
 * update to conform to mypy 0.511: mypy –strict
 * duplicate keys in mappings generate an error
 * dependecy on ruamel.ordereddict for 2.7 now via extras_require

	 in a much more meaningful YAMLStreamError.
 * assigning a normal string value to an existing CommentedMap key
	 or CommentedSeq element will result in a value cast to the previous
	 value’s type if possible.
 * added YAML class for new API
 * fix for issue 119, deepcopy not returning subclasses
 * fix for issue 103 allowing implicit documents after document end marker
	 line (...) in YAML 1.2
