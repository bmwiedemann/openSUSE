  * setup issue for 3.8 (reported by Sidney Kuyateh)
  * setting yaml.sort_base_mapping_type_on_output = False, will prevent explicit sorting by keys in the base representer of mappings. Roundtrip already did not do this. Usage only makes real sense for Python 3.6+ (feature request by Sebastian Gerber).

  * fix issue with empty mapping and sequence loaded as flow-style (mapping reported by Min RK, sequence by Maged Ahmed)

  * fix issue with duplicate merge keys (prompted by answering a StackOverflow question by math)
  * fix dropping of comment on rt before sequence item that is sequence item (reported by Thorsten Kampe)
  * fix irregular output on pre-comment in sequence within sequence (reported by Thorsten Kampe)
  * allow non-compact (i.e. next line) dumping sequence/mapping within sequence.

 * fix issue with parsabel, but incorrect output with nested flow-style sequences
 * fix issue with loading Python objects that have __setstate__ and recursion in parameters
 * reverted CommentedMap and CommentedSeq to subclass ordereddict resp. list,
    reimplemented merge maps so that both ``dict(**commented_map_instance)`` and JSON
    dumping works. This also allows checking with ``isinstance()`` on ``dict`` resp. ``list``.

 * fix regression with non-root literal scalars that needed indent indicator
 * tag:yaml.org,2002:python/object/apply now also uses __qualname__ on PY3

 * fix for issue 149: multiplications on ScalarFloat now return float
 * fix Comment dumping
 * fix for issue with “compact JSON” not parsing: {"in":{},"out":{}}
 * fix issue #51: different indents for mappings and sequences
 * fix for flow sequence/mapping as element/value of block sequence
	 with sequence-indent minus dash-offset not equal two.
 * fix issue #61: merge of merge cannot be __repr__-ed
 * fix issue 62, YAML 1.2 allows ? and : in plain scalars if non-ambigious
 * fix lists within lists which would make comments disappear
 * fix for disappearing comment after empty flow sequence
 * fix for problem with dumping (unloaded) floats
 * added ScalarFloat which supports roundtripping of 23.1, 23.100, 42.00E+56,
	 0.0, -0.0 etc. while keeping the format. Underscores in mantissas
	 are not preserved/supported
 * (finally) fixed longstanding issue 23, now handling comment between block
	 mapping key and value correctly
 * warn on YAML 1.1 float input that is incorrect
 * allow setting of boolean representation (false, true)
	 by using: yaml.boolean_representation = [u'False', u'True']
 * fix for round_tripping integers on 2.7.X > sys.maxint
 * fix for round_tripping singe excl. mark tags doubling 
 * fix for writing unicode in new API,
 * added object constructor for rt, decorator yaml_object to replace YAMLObject.
 * fix for problem using load_all with Path() instance

 * a set() with duplicate elements now throws error in rt loading
 * support for toplevel column zero literal/folded scalar in explicit documents
 * repeat load() on a single YAML() instance would fail.
 * transform parameter on dump that expects a function taking a string
	 and returning a string. This allows transformation of the output before
	 it is written to stream. This forces creation of the complete output in memory!
 * some updates to the docs
 * update to conform to mypy 0.511: mypy –strict
 * duplicate keys in mappings generate an error
 * dependecy on ruamel.ordereddict for 2.7 now via extras_require

	 to all load/dump functions
 * passing in a non-supported object (e.g. a string) as “stream” will result
	 in a much more meaningful YAMLStreamError.
 * assigning a normal string value to an existing CommentedMap key
	 or CommentedSeq element will result in a value cast to the previous
	 value’s type if possible.
 * added YAML class for new API
 * fix for issue 119, deepcopy not returning subclasses
 * fix for issue 103 allowing implicit documents after document end marker
	 line (...) in YAML 1.2
