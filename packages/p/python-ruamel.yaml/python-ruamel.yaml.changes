Sat Mar 16 16:33:40 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.18.6:
  * fixed an issue with dataclass loading when the fields were
    collections (bug found as a result of a question by
    [FibroMyAlgebra](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6855070/fibromyalgebra)
    on
    [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77485786/1307905))
  * fixed an issue loading dataclasses with `InitVar` fields when
    `from __future__ import annotations` was used to delay
    evaluation of typing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 16:27:02 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.18.5:
  * there is some indication that dependent packages have been
    pinned to use specific (tested) and just install the latest
    even in Python versions that have end-of-life
- update to 0.18.4:
  * YAML() instance has a `doc_infos` attribute which is a
    cumulative list of DocInfo instances (one for `load()`, one per
    document for `load_all()`). DocInfo instances contain version
    information (requested, directive) and tag directive
    information
  * fix issue that the YAML instance tags attribute was not reset
    between documents, resulting in mixing of tag directives of
    multiple documents. Now only provides tag directive information
    on latest document after loading. This means tags for dumping
    must be set **again** after a document is loaded with the same
    instance. (because of this tags will be removed in a favour of
    a different mechanism in the future)
  * fix issue with multiple document intermixing YAML 1.2 and YAML
    1.1, the VersionedResolver now resets
  * fix issue with disappearing comment when next token was Tag
    (still can't have both a comment before a tag and after a tag,
    before node)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 16:20:20 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.18.3:
  * fix issue with spurious newline on first item after comment +
    nested block sequence
  * additional links in the metadata on PyPI (Reported, with
    pointers how to fix, by
      [Sorin](https://sourceforge.net/u/ssbarnea/profile/)).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 14:52:34 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.18.2:
  * calling the deprecated functions now raises an `AttributeError`
    with the, somewhat more informative, orginal warning message.
    Instead of calling `sys.exit(1)`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 14:51:02 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.18.1:
  * calling the deprecated functions now always displays the
    warning message.  (reported by [Trend
    Lloyd](https://sourceforge.net/u/lathiat2/profile/))

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 14:46:35 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.18.0:
  * the **functions** `scan`, `parse`, `compose`, `load`, `emit`,
    `serialize`, `dump` and their variants (`_all`, `safe_`,
    `round_trip_`, etc) have been deprecated (the same named
    **methods** on `YAML()` instances are, of course, still there.
  * `YAML(typ='unsafe')` now issues a `PendingDeprecationWarning`.
    This will become deprecated in the 0.18 series (probably before
    the end of 2023).  You can use `YAML(typ='full')` to dump
    unregistered Python classes/functions.  For loading you'll have
    to register your classes/functions if you want the old, unsafe,
    functionality. You can still load any tag, like
    `!!python/name:posix.system', **safely** with the (default)
    round-trip parser.
  * fix for `bytes-like object is required not 'str' while dumping
    binary streams`.  This was reported, analysed and a fix
    provided by [Vit
    Zikmund](https://sourceforge.net/u/tlwhitec/profile/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 14:44:21 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.17.40:
  * flow style sets are now preserved ( `!!set {a, b, c} )`. Any
    values specified when loading are dropped, including `!!null
    ""`.
  * potential workaround for issue 484: the
    long_description_content_type including the variant
    specification `CommonMark` can result in problems on Azure. If
    you can install from `.tar.gz` using
    `RUAMEL_NO_LONG_DESCRIPTION=1 pip install ruamel.yaml
    --no-binary :all:` then the long description, and its offending
    type, are nog included (in the METADATA).  (Reported by [Coury
    Ditch](https://sourceforge.net/u/cmditch/profile/))
  * links in documentation update (reported by [David
    Hoese](https://sourceforge.net/u/daveydave400/profile/))
  * Added some `__repr__` for internally used classes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 14:34:33 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.17.39 (skipping non-existent releases .37 and .38):
  * update README generation, no code changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 14:30:21 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 0.17.36:
  * fixed issue 480, dumping of a loaded empty flow-style mapping with comment failed
    (Reported by [Stéphane Brunner](https://sourceforge.net/u/stbrunner/profile/))
  * fixed issue 482, caused by DEFAULT_MAPPING_TAG having changes to being a `Tag()`
    instance, not a string (reported by [yan12125](https://sourceforge.net/u/yan12125/profile/))
  * updated documentation to use mkdocs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 07:57:03 UTC 2023 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 0.17.35
 * Python 3.12 also loads C version when using `typ='safe'`
 * initial support for loading invoking `__post_init__` on dataclasses
    that have that method after loading a registered dataclass
    (`@yaml.register_class\n@dataclass\nclass ...`)
 * fix issue with scanner getting stuck in infinite loop
 * added `flow_seq_start`, `flow_seq_end`, `flow_seq_separator`,
    `flow_map_start`, `flow_map_end`, `flow_map_separator` **class**
    attributes to the `Emitter` class so flow style output
    can more easily be influenced

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  1 05:46:10 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 0.17.31:
  * added tag.setter on `ScalarEvent` and on `Node`, that takes
    either a `Tag` instance, or a str (reported by Sorin Sbarnea)
- update to 0.17.30:
  * fix issue 467, caused by Tag instances not being hashable
    (reported by Douglas Raillard)
- update to 0.17.29:
  * changed the internals of the tag property from a string to a
    class which allows for preservation of the original handle and
    suffix. This should result in better results using documents
    with %TAG directives, as well as preserving URI escapes in tag
    suffixes.
- update to 0.17.28:
  * fix for issue 464: documents ending with document end marker
    without final newline fail to load (reported by Mariusz
    Rusiniak)
- update to 0.17.27:
  * fix issue with inline mappings as value for merge keys
    (reported by Sirish)
  * fix for 468, error inserting after accessing merge attribute on
    ``CommentedMap`` (reported by Bastien gerard)
  * fix for issue 461 pop + insert on same `CommentedMap` key
    throwing error (reported by `John Thorvald Wodder II)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 09:07:31 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- adapt patch 0000-fix-big-endian-issues.patch
- update to 0.17.26:
  - Fix for error on edge cage for issue 459
- update to 0.17.25:
  - fix for regression while dumping wrapped strings with too many
    backslashes removed (issue 459, reported by `Lele Gaifax
    <https://sourceforge.net/u/lele/profile/>`__)
- update to 0.17.24:
  - rewrite of ``CommentedMap.insert()``. If you have a merge key
    in the YAML document for the mapping you insert to, the
    position value should be the one as you look at the YAML input.
    This fixes issue 453 where other keys of a merged in mapping
    would show up after an insert (reported by `Alex Miller
    <https://sourceforge.net/u/millerdevel/profile/>`__). It also
    fixes a call to `.insert()` resulting into the merge key to
    move to be the first key if it wasn't already and it is also
    now possible to insert a key before a merge key (even if the
    fist key in the mapping).
  - fix (in the pure Python implementation including default) for
    issue 447.  (reported by `Jack Cherng
    <https://sourceforge.net/u/jfcherng/profile/>`__, also brought
    up by brent on `StackOverflow
    <https://stackoverflow.com/q/40072485/1307905>`__)
- update to 0.17.23:
  - fix 458, error on plain scalars starting with word longer than
    width.  (reported by `Kyle Larose
    <https://sourceforge.net/u/klarose/profile/>`__)
  - fix for ``.update()`` no longer correctly handling keyword
    arguments (reported by John Lin on <StackOverflow
    `<https://stackoverflow.com/q/76089100/1307905>`__)
  - fix issue 454: high Unicode (emojis) in quoted strings always
    escaped (reported by `Michal Čihař
    <https://sourceforge.net/u/nijel/profile/>`__ based on a
    question on StackOverflow).
  - fix issue with emitter conservatively inserting extra
    backslashes in wrapped quoted strings (reported by thebenman on
    `StackOverflow
    <https://stackoverflow.com/q/75631454/1307905>`__)
- update to 0.17.22:
  - fix issue 449 where the second exclamation marks got URL
    encoded (reported and fixing PR provided by `John Stark
    <https://sourceforge.net/u/jods/profile/>`__)
  - fix issue with indent != 2 and literal scalars with empty first
    line (reported by wrdis on `StackOverflow
    <https://stackoverflow.com/q/75584262/1307905>`__)
  - updated __repr__ of CommentedMap, now that Python's dict is
    ordered -> no more ordereddict(list-of-tuples)
  - merge MR 4, handling OctalInt in YAML 1.1 (provided by `Jacob
    Floyd <https://sourceforge.net/u/cognifloyd/profile/>`_)
  - fix loading of `!!float 42` (reported by Eric on `Stack
    overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/a/71555107/1307905>`_)
  - line numbers are now set on `CommentedKeySeq` and
    `CommentedKeyMap` (which are created if you have a sequence
    resp. mapping as the key in a mapping)
  - plain scalars: put single words longer than width on a line of
    their own, instead of after the previous line (issue 427,
    reported by `Antoine Cotten
    <https://sourceforge.net/u/antoineco/profile/>`_). Caveat: this
    currently results in a space ending the previous line.
  - fix for folded scalar part of 421: comments after ">" on first
    line of folded scalars are now preserved (as were those in the
    same position on literal scalars).  Issue reported by Jacob
    Floyd.
  - added stacklevel to warnings
  - typing changed from Py2 compatible comments to Py3, removed
    various Py2-isms

	 are not preserved/supported
 * (finally) fixed longstanding issue 23, now handling comment between block
	 mapping key and value correctly
 * warn on YAML 1.1 float input that is incorrect
 * allow setting of boolean representation (false, true)
	 by using: yaml.boolean_representation = [u'False', u'True']
 * fix for round_tripping integers on 2.7.X > sys.maxint
 * fix for round_tripping singe excl. mark tags doubling
 * fix for writing unicode in new API,
 * added object constructor for rt, decorator yaml_object to replace YAMLObject.
 * fix for problem using load_all with Path() instance
 * fix for load_all in combination with zero indent block style literal
	 (pure=True only!)
 * missing pure attribute on YAML useful for implementing !include tag
	 constructor for including YAML files in a YAML file
 * some documentation improvements
 * trigger of doc build on new revision
 * support for Unicode supplementary Plane output
 * fix for issue 135, typ=’safe’ not dumping in Python 2.7
 * fix for issue 133, in setup.py: change ModuleNotFoundError to ImportError
 * suppress duplicate key warning on mappings with merge keys
 * remove fatal dependency of setup.py on wheel package
 * fix for issue 130, regression in nested merge keys
 * top level PreservedScalarString not indented if not explicitly asked to
 * some mypy additions
 * fix for issue 127: tagged scalars were always quoted and seperated by
	 a newline when in a block sequence
 * allow plug-in install via install ruamel.yaml[jinja2]
 * add plug-in mechanism for load/dump pre resp. post-processing
 * a set() with duplicate elements now throws error in rt loading
 * support for toplevel column zero literal/folded scalar in explicit documents
 * repeat load() on a single YAML() instance would fail.
 * transform parameter on dump that expects a function taking a string
	 and returning a string. This allows transformation of the output before
	 it is written to stream. This forces creation of the complete output in memory!
 * some updates to the docs
 * update to conform to mypy 0.511: mypy –strict
 * duplicate keys in mappings generate an error
 * dependecy on ruamel.ordereddict for 2.7 now via extras_require
 * it is now allowed to pass in a pathlib.Path as “stream” parameter
	 to all load/dump functions
 * passing in a non-supported object (e.g. a string) as “stream” will result
	 in a much more meaningful YAMLStreamError.
 * assigning a normal string value to an existing CommentedMap key
	 or CommentedSeq element will result in a value cast to the previous
	 value’s type if possible.
 * added YAML class for new API
 * fix for issue 119, deepcopy not returning subclasses
 * fix for issue 103 allowing implicit documents after document end marker
	 line (...) in YAML 1.2
 * fix problem with emitting using cyaml
