- Add Obsoletes: line to avoid conflicts with python-importlib_resources

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 12:24:25 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Reintroduce into Tumbleweed for python36 flavor
- Update to 3.2.0
  * #68: Resources in PEP 420 Namespace packages are now supported.
- v3.1.1
  * bpo-41490: contents is now also more aggressive about consuming 
    any iterator from the Reader.
- v3.1.0
  * #110 and bpo-41490: path method is more aggressive about   
    releasing handles to zipfile objects early, enabling use-cases 
    like certifi to leave the context open but delete the 
    underlying zip file.
- v3.0.0
  * Package no longer exposes importlib_resources.__version__.     
    Users that wish to inspect the version of importlib_resources 
    should instead invoke .version('importlib_resources') from 
    importlib-metadata ( stdlib or backport) directly. This change 
    eliminates the dependency on importlib_metadata. Closes #100.
  * Package now always includes its data. Closes #93.
  * Declare hidden imports for PyInstaller. Closes #101.
- v2.0.1
  * Select pathlib and contextlib imports based on Python version 
    and avoid pulling in deprecated [pathlib](https://pypi.org/
    project/pathlib). Closes #97.
- v2.0.0
  * Loaders are no longer expected to implement the 
    abc.TraversableResources interface, but are instead expected to 
    return TraversableResources from their get_resource_reader 
    method.
- v1.5.0
  * Traversable is now a Protocol instead of an Abstract Base Class 
    (Python 2.7 and Python 3.8+).
  * Traversable objects now require a .name property.
- v1.4.0
  * #79: Temporary files created will now reflect the filename of 
    their origin.
- v1.3.1
  * For improved compatibility, importlib_resources.trees is now 
    imported implicitly. Closes #88.
- v1.3.0
  * Add extensibility support for non-standard loaders to supply 
    Traversable resources. Introduces a new abstract base class 
    abc.TraversableResources that supersedes (but implements for 
    compatibility) abc.ResourceReader. Any loader that implements 
    (implicitly or explicitly) the TraversableResources.files 
    method will be capable of supplying resources with subdirectory 
    support. Closes #77.
  * Preferred way to access as_file is now from top-level module. 
    importlib_resources.trees.as_file is deprecated and 
    discouraged. Closes #86.
  * Moved Traversable abc to abc module. Closes #87.
- v1.2.0
  * Traversable now requires an open method. Closes #81.
  * Fixed error on Python 3.5.{0,3}. Closes #83.
  * Updated packaging to resolve version from package metadata. 
    Closes #82.

- Add missing runtime dependencies bsc#1175707

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 13 21:38:55 CEST 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 1.1.0 (jsc#PM-1954 bsc#1172933):
  - Add support for retrieving resources from subdirectories of
    packages through the new files() function, which returns
    a Traversable object with joinpath and read_* interfaces
    matching those of pathlib.Path objects. This new function
    supersedes all of the previous functionality as it provides
    a more general-purpose access to a package’s resources.
  - With this function, subdirectories are supported.
  - The documentation has been updated to reflect that this
    function is now the preferred interface for loading package
    resources. It does not, however, support resources from
    arbitrary loaders. It currently only supports resources from
    file system path and zipfile packages (a consequence of the
    ResourceReader interface only operating on Python packages).
