- Update to v5.10.1 
  * v5.10.1
  #274: Fixed ResourceWarning in _common.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 28 17:45:02 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to v5.10.0
  * #203: Lifted restriction on modules passed to files. Now modules need not be a package and if a non-package module is passed,
    resources will be resolved adjacent to those modules, even for modules not found in any package. For example,
    files(import_module('mod.py')) will resolve resources found at the root. The parameter to files was renamed from 'package' to 'anchor',
    with a compatibility shim for those passing by keyword.
  * #259: files no longer requires the anchor to be specified and can infer the anchor from the caller's scope (defaults to the caller's module).

Tue Sep 13 06:45:26 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 5.9.0:
  - #228: as_file now also supports a Traversable representing
    a directory and (when needed) renders the full tree to a
    temporary directory.
  - #253: In MultiplexedPath, restore expectation that a compound
    path with a non-existent directory does not raise an
    exception.
  - #250: Now Traversable.joinpath provides a concrete
    implementation, replacing the implementation in .simple and
    converging with the behavior in MultiplexedPath.
  - #249: In simple.ResourceContainer.joinpath, honor names split
    by posixpath.sep.
  - #248: abc.Traversable.joinpath now allows for multiple
    arguments and specifies that posixpath.sep is allowed
    in any argument to accept multiple arguments, matching
    the behavior found in zipfile.Path and pathlib.Path
    simple.ResourceContainer now honors this behavior
  - #244: Add type declarations in ABCs Require Python 3.7 or
    later
  - #243: Fix error when no __pycache__ directories exist when
    testing update-zips.
- Remove BR on python-zipp to break a dependency cycle; it is
  strictly not needed for build (although it is Requires),
  because ZipReader is not tested.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  6 18:19:08 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.4.0:
  * Test suite now relies entirely on the traversable API.
  * Now raise a ``DeprecationWarning`` for all legacy
    functions. Instead, users should rely on the ``files()``
    API introduced in importlib_resources 1.3. See
  * Updated readme to reflect current behavior and show
    which versions correspond to which behavior in CPython.

Mon Sep 20 10:47:28 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v5.2.2

- Release v5.2.1
  * bpo-38291: Avoid DeprecationWarning on typing.io.
- Release v5.2.0
  * #80 via #221: Legacy API (path, contents, ...) is now
    supported entirely by the .files() API with a compatibility
    shim supplied for resource loaders without that functionality.
- Release v5.0.6
  * bpo-38693: Prefer f-strings to .format calls.
- Release v5.1.4
  * #225: Require zipp 3.1.0 or later on Python prior to 3.10 to
    incorporate those fixes.
- Release v5.0.5
  * #216: Make MultiplexedPath.name a property per the spec.
- Release v5.1.3
  * Refresh packaging and improve tests.

  * Simplified DegenerateFiles.Path.
- Release v5.0.2
  * #214: Added _adapters module to ensure that degenerate files
    behavior can be made available for legacy loaders whose

    backport compatibility module was masking this fallback
    behavior only to discover the defect when applying changes to
    CPython.
- Release v5.1.0
  * Added simple module implementing adapters from a low-level
    resource reader interface to a TraversableResources interface.
    Closes #90.

- Add Obsoletes: line to avoid conflicts with python-importlib_resources

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 12:24:25 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Reintroduce into Tumbleweed for python36 flavor
- Update to 3.2.0
  * #68: Resources in PEP 420 Namespace packages are now supported.
- v3.1.1
  * bpo-41490: contents is now also more aggressive about consuming 
    any iterator from the Reader.
- v3.1.0
  * #110 and bpo-41490: path method is more aggressive about   
    releasing handles to zipfile objects early, enabling use-cases 
    like certifi to leave the context open but delete the 
    underlying zip file.
- v3.0.0
  * Package no longer exposes importlib_resources.__version__.     
    Users that wish to inspect the version of importlib_resources 
    should instead invoke .version('importlib_resources') from 
    importlib-metadata ( stdlib or backport) directly. This change 
    eliminates the dependency on importlib_metadata. Closes #100.
  * Package now always includes its data. Closes #93.
  * Declare hidden imports for PyInstaller. Closes #101.
- v2.0.1
  * Select pathlib and contextlib imports based on Python version 
    and avoid pulling in deprecated [pathlib](https://pypi.org/
    project/pathlib). Closes #97.
- v2.0.0
  * Loaders are no longer expected to implement the 
    abc.TraversableResources interface, but are instead expected to 
    return TraversableResources from their get_resource_reader 
    method.
- v1.5.0
  * Traversable is now a Protocol instead of an Abstract Base Class 
    (Python 2.7 and Python 3.8+).
  * Traversable objects now require a .name property.
- v1.4.0
  * #79: Temporary files created will now reflect the filename of 
    their origin.
- v1.3.1
  * For improved compatibility, importlib_resources.trees is now 
    imported implicitly. Closes #88.
- v1.3.0
  * Add extensibility support for non-standard loaders to supply 
    Traversable resources. Introduces a new abstract base class 
    abc.TraversableResources that supersedes (but implements for 
    compatibility) abc.ResourceReader. Any loader that implements 
    (implicitly or explicitly) the TraversableResources.files 
    method will be capable of supplying resources with subdirectory 
    support. Closes #77.
  * Preferred way to access as_file is now from top-level module. 
    importlib_resources.trees.as_file is deprecated and 
    discouraged. Closes #86.
  * Moved Traversable abc to abc module. Closes #87.
- v1.2.0
  * Traversable now requires an open method. Closes #81.
  * Fixed error on Python 3.5.{0,3}. Closes #83.
  * Updated packaging to resolve version from package metadata. 
    Closes #82.

- Add missing runtime dependencies bsc#1175707

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 13 21:38:55 CEST 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 1.1.0 (jsc#PM-1954 bsc#1172933):
  - Add support for retrieving resources from subdirectories of
    packages through the new files() function, which returns
    a Traversable object with joinpath and read_* interfaces
    matching those of pathlib.Path objects. This new function
    supersedes all of the previous functionality as it provides
    a more general-purpose access to a package’s resources.
  - With this function, subdirectories are supported.
  - The documentation has been updated to reflect that this
    function is now the preferred interface for loading package
    resources. It does not, however, support resources from
    arbitrary loaders. It currently only supports resources from
    file system path and zipfile packages (a consequence of the
    ResourceReader interface only operating on Python packages).
