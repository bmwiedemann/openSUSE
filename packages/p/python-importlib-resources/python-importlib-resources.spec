%description
importlib_resources is a backport of Python standard library
importlib.resources module for older Pythons. Users of Python 3.9 and
beyond should use the standard library module, since for these versions,
importlib_resources just delegates to that module.

The key goal of this module is to replace parts of pkg_resources with a
solution in Pythonâ€™s stdlib that relies on well-defined APIs. This makes
reading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and
consistent semantics.
