  <title>Specifications for callback functions passed in to an API</title>
  <description>If your code lets other people supply callback functions, it’s important to specify the function signature you expect, and check that functions support that. Adding extra parameters later would break other peoples code unless you’re careful.

backcall provides a way of specifying the callback signature using a prototype function.</description>
