%description
Ironic Inspector is an auxiliary service for discovering hardware properties
for a node managed by OpenStack Ironic. Hardware introspection or hardware
properties discovery is a process of getting hardware parameters required for
scheduling from a bare metal node, given its power management credentials
(e.g. IPMI address, user name and password).

This package contains Python client and command line tool for Ironic Inspector.
