     *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #121346] Gabor Kanizsai reported a regression
               with empty messages logged via syswrite(). Fixed with test
               case.

  1.48 (2016/11/14)
     *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #117377] Moved PatternLayout's documentation of
               DateFormat features to DateFormat.pm to avoid duplication 
               and keep the two parts consistent, as suggested by Max Carey.
     *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #114822] Split two lines with CVS-sensitive 
               $Log.. variables into two parts.
     *    (ms) Semaphore issue fixed in Synchronized (reported by 
               Siarhei Kuchynski and Martin Köhler):
            https://github.com/mschilli/log4perl/issues/72
     *    (ms) header_text now works with syswrite (reported by Tom Metro):

  1.47 (2016/03/17)
     *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #102647] Slaven Rezic fixed a test
               case for file permissions
     *    (ms) Fixed synopsis code in Log::Log4perl::Appender::DBI, 
               reported by Chris Collins.
     *    (ms) Added suggestion by Dylan Doxey to test for both MSWin32 and
               cygwin to detect windows-like systems for which tests need
               to be skipped.
     *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #110915] Fixed "Redundant argument in sprintf" 
               warning caused by DateFormat.pm with %d{Z} placeholders, 
               reported by Alexander Hartmaier.
     *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #110512] Felix Ostmann fixed a broken error
               message raised when a boolean filter can't be found.
     *    (ms) All hash traversals in Config.pm now done via "sort keys"
               to make sure we can reliably reproduce potential problems.

Wed May 30 11:18:04 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.36
   *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #74833] Reini Urban fixed "defined @array" for
             perl 5.16
   *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #74836] Cope with Carp's questionable decision to
             add a trailing dot to its messages.

   *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #73462] Changed logwarn/logcluck/logcarp/error_warn 
             to warn() unconditionally and send the message to log4perl which
             will log it only if the log level conditions are met.
   *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #73598] Gerda Shank reported test suite problems
             with DBD::CSV-0.26. Bumped up to DBD::CSV-0.33 if installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 19 15:41:54 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.de

- update to 1.34
   *    (ms) InternalDebug now replaces all instances of INTERNAL_DEBUG,
             not just the first one.
   *    (ms) Added test case for get_logger() with a ref() on the actual
             object instead of on a static category. Updated docs.
   *    (ms) %d{e} in PatternLayout now returns epoch seconds
   *    (ms) [RT#72056] Messages blocked by an appender threshold are no
             longer passed on to the L4p::Appender::Buffer as undefined
             entries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 23 13:33:38 UTC 2011 - chris@computersalat.de

- update to 1.33
   *    (ms) [RT 67132] Applied patch by Darin McBride to allow for
             empty syswrite messages in the file appender.
   *    (ms) [RT 68105] Fixed init-hash handling of subroutine references,
             reported by Frew Schmidt.
   *    (ms) Mike Schwern noticed confusing DESTROY calls to clean up loggers 
             and appenders (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5914088 and
             https://github.com/mschilli/log4perl/issues/7), so I put on my 
             hazmat suit and cleaned it up. Now perl's garbage collector takes 
             care of disposing of logger and appender carcasses.
   *    (ms) Added Log::Log4perl->remove_logger($logger) to remove a logger
             from the system.

- 1.32 (2011/02/26)
   *    (ms) Fixed %T caller_depth with wrapper_register(), reported
             by David Christensen.
   *    (ms) [RT 63053] Fixed for qw() {} deprecated (Todd Rinaldo)
   *    (ms) [RT 62674] Fixed call to deprecated form of UNIVERSAL::can (Karen
             Etheridge).
   *    (ms) [RT 62896] Log::Log4perl::Appender::ScreenColoredLevels now 
             inherits from Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen and therefore
             supports the utf8 flag.
   *    (ms) [RT 64318] Andrew Sayers provided a better error message for
             "threshold needs to be uppercase".
   *    (ms) CharleyDixon fixed LOGWARN when :no_extra_logdie_message is 
             in use to no longer exit().

- 1.31 (2010/10/27)
  *     (ms) Fixed the number of skipped tests for Windows for previous fix
             of [RT 60665].

- 1.30 (2010/08/30)
   *    (ms) [RT 60665] HUP handlers are stacked on top of each other now,
             to make sure that multiple file appenders recreate multiple
             files and not just one (patch provided by Karen Etheridge).
   *    (ms) [RT 60197] Fixed uninitialized value warnings with
             the multiline appender and provided a test case (patch provided
             by Karen Etheridge)
   *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #59617] Fixed system-wide threshold without appender
             thresholds. Bug reported by Dmitry Bigunyak.
   *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #24884] Using require() instead of incomplete
             logic in L4p::Util::module_available(). local __DIE__
             handler takes care of user-defined __DIE__ handlers 
             ignoring $^S (suggested by Eric Wilhelm and others).
   *    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #60386] Fixed init_and_watch() which 
             double-bumped the caller_level and led to uninitialized 
             values in the pattern layout. Thanks to Mitja Bartsch for 
             the report.
   *    (ms) Applied patch by Karsten SilkenbÃ¤umer to add an optional
             $log_dispatch_level to create_custom_level(). Updated 
             documentation.

  *    (ms) Added documentation on how to use Log4perl's :easy macros
            with Catalyst in Log::Log4perl::Catalyst.
  *    (ms) wrapper_register() now deals with caller_depth automatically.
            Backwards compatibility with old wrapper classes using 
            caller_depth directly is provided. Documentation has been 
            updated.
  *    (ms) Felix Antonius Wilhelm Ostmann reported Resurrector.pm 
            crashes, fixed as suggested by setting the %INC value to 
            the module path.
  *    (ms) Another caller_depth fix in Log::Log4perl::Catalyst.
  *    (ms) Fixed logdie() caller_depth bug reported by Rob Retter.
  *    (ms) [RT 56145] Saving errstr in DBI appender to survive ping()
  *    (ms) Added INTERNAL_DEBUG env variable to test suite triggering
            all _INTERNAL_DEBUG statements to be printed for better
            error diagnosis on misbehaving systems.

   *    (ms) Fixed caller stack with Buffer composite appender
   *    (ms) Fixed 'local caller_depth' error in various places. First
             localizing a variable and then increasing it is incorrect,
             as this ignores previous settings. The correct way of
             increasing the caller level is: 'local depth = depth + 1'.

   *  (ms) ***WARNING: This might break backward compatibility
                        with some wrapper classes.
             [RT 52913] Fixed category fetching in
             wrapper classes (reported by Martin Evans). Wrapper classes
             now need to call Log::Log4perl->wrapper_register to adapt
             get_logger() category fetching. Detailed docs under
             "Using Log::Log4perl with wrapper functions and classes"
   *    (ms) Made meta tag compatible with MakeMaker versions < 6.50
        (ms) [RT 52083] Fixed manifest glitch from 1.26 (reported by
             Lars Thegler).
   *    (ms) Added note to FAQ on 'no init happened' warnings for API
             initializations, as suggested by Malcolm Nooning.
   *    (ms) Applied patch by Christopher Mckay which sets
             Log4perl::Logger::INITIALIZED only if it's fully initialized.
   *    (ms) Emmanuel Rodriguez suggested changing TestBuffer's reset()
             method to leave the logger population alone. Added clear()
             to accomodate the need for a single buffer reset.
   *    (ms) Xavier Caron added %p{1} to allow abbreviated priority
             strings in the pattern layout.
   *    (ms) Redid composite appenders to address problems with incorrect
             caller() data. L4p now supports a $cache parameter to be
             passed to the log() function, which stores the completely
             rendered message and can be passed to log_cached() later on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 12 21:33:53 UTC 2009 - chris@computersalat.de

- update to 1.26
    *   (ms) [RT 50495] Perl code in the config file is now evaluated/
             compiled after the configuration parser has done its work, 
             opening up Perl subroutines to all configuration parsers, not
             just PropertyConfigurator. Configuration subs for cspecs, 
             filter, warp_message and appender triggers are sheltered. 
             The previous, flawed implementation surfaced while using 
             a 'trigger' category, reported by Olivier Bilodeau.
    *   (ms) [RT 50090] Added non-portable linebreaks to PatternLayout
             (requested by ZdenÄ›k Juran).
    *   (ms) [RT 50094] Docfix for PatternLayout in main manpage (spotted
             by Peter Rabbitson).
    *   (ms) [RT 28679] Added exists() to "Threshold" keyword uppercase 
             check.
    *   (ms) Took out Class::Prototyped testcase after it got all weird
             and introduced backward-incompatible changes.
1.25 (2009/09/27)
    *   (ms) Appender::File is now closing (or sysclosing) the file
             on file_close() instead of just undef'ing the handle.
    *   (ms) Added l4p-tmpl helper script to help whipping up a new
             log4perl configuration file.
    *   (ms) Fixed uninitialized warning on XML configuration files,
             reported by jbkilian on the sourceforge mailing list.
    *   (ms) Applied patch [RT 43426] by AFF <aff@cpan.org> to have 
             appender_thresholds_adjust return number of appenders changed.
    *   (ms) [RT 34400] New :nostrict target which allows redefining a 
             category within a Log4perl configuration file without error
             or even a warning.
    *   (ms) [RT 34401] Applied patch by Jae Gangemi, who fixed
             code references in @INC on Win32 systems. 
    *   (ms) [RT 32259] Patternlayout now supports %R, which returns the
             number of milliseconds elapsed from last logging event to
             the current logging event (thanks to Emmanuel Rodriguez for
             the patch).
    *   (ms) [RT 30899] Color configuration and attribute support 
             added to ScreenColoredLevels appender by Jason Kohles.
    *   (ms) [RT 28987] If UNIVERSAL is available, appender existence is
             now verified by checking can() on the appender's new() 
             method (applied modified patch by Gabriel Berriz).

Mon Jul 13 11:17:36 CEST 2009 - ug@suse.de

- update to 1.24
    *   (ms) Fixed bug with Log::Log4perl::Util::tmpfile_name which 
             surfaced on VMS, reported by Ben Humphreys.
    *   (ms) Fixed system-wide threshold to no longer lower appender 
             thresholds. Bug reported by Jean-Denis Muys.
    *   (ms) Added benchmark to determine impact of eval-free handlers
    *   (ms) Merged with eval_free branch. Now there are no more 
             eval("") statements left in the code, making it much easier 
             to debug. Performance on init() is about the same, performance 
             on init_and_watch() (noops and logged statements alike) is 
             25% slower but still in the range of 400,000/sec on my 
             1.80Ghz CPU.
    *   (ms) DBI-1.608 removed a DBD::File 'feature' that allowed leaving
             out parameters in a bound execute(). This caused the test
             suite to fail
             number of parameters every time.
    *   (ms) Better error message in the DBI appender on bad SQL, missing
             bind parameters, or other execute() errors.
    *   (ms) Made DBI test suite more robust against preexisting conditions
    *   (ms) Added force_next_check() for init_and_watch(), cleaned up
             Config::Watcher code.
    *   (ms) Fixed test suite to run on Strawberry Perl on Win32 (reported
             by kmx on https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=45983)
    *   (ms) Added 'utf8' option to screen appender and easy mode, some of
             it suggested in 
             http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=36673 by
             Shantanu Bhadoria.
    *   (ms) is_xxx() returned true prior to L4p initialization. Fixed it
             and adapted test suite.
    *   (ms) Added test cases on syswrite in recreate mode
    *   (ms) Applied patch by Jens Berthold <log4perl@jebecs.de> to
             avoid semaphore cleanup in spawned children.
    *   (ms) Added %m{chomp} feature, 'message_chomp_before_newline' option,
             and documentation on newlines and logging messages, all 
             suggested by Tim Bunce (see PatternLayout).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 12 12:24:30 CET 2009 - ro@suse.de

- update to 1.20
  * Using semctl to reset the value of the semaphore in the
    Synchronized appender to prevent "Numerical result out of
    range" problem caused by an unbalanced SEM_UNDO when
    incrementing it. Reported by John Little.
  * Added parameters in curly braces to cspecs in PatternLayout.
  * As explained in  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41505
    the latest LWP release (5.822) got rid of all of its internal
    debugging functions, making infiltrate_lwp() and its test
    case useless. Disabling it for LWP>=5.822.

- update to 1.19
  * Applied patch by Peter Rabbitson, which fixes the caller()
    level when calling get_logger() on a subclass of Log4perl.
  * Added documentation on is_xxx() methods and clarified that
    it doesn't necessarily mean that a message gets logged if
    they're returning true (requested by Conway Allen via
    [rt.cpan.org #39085].
  * Applied patch by Lee Johnson to appender_by_name() to allow
    for undefined appender names without issuing a warning,
    which was occurring with Catalyst::Log4perl.
  * Added docs on numerical levels and level strings in
    Log::Log4perl::Level.
  * Applied patch by Anthony Foiani for support of literal
    text in DateFormat format strings.

Fri Sep  5 16:12:29 CEST 2008 - ug@suse.de

* Added explanation that categories and loggers are the same
  thing (thanks to Rabbit).
* Fixed t/053Resurrect to work with 5.005_03
* Added preinit_callback function for init_and_watch()
* Applied patch by Andy Grundman which speeds up is_LEVEL()
  calls by skipping unnecessary string concatenations 
  (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=38537).
* Applied patch by Jae Gangemi addding a no_warning option to the
  socket appender
  (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34399).
* Fixed test suite to run on Strawberry Perl on Win32.
* Added 'l4p' as a valid prefix in configuration files (equal
  to 'log4j' and 'log4perl' now).
* Changed appender destruction during cleanup to show warning
  messages thrown by destructors. Previously L4p ignored these
  messages which caused failed DB flushes to go unnoticed with
  the DB appender.
* Added explanation for Log4perl messages during global 
  destruction to FAQ.
* Corrected 'Trapper' listing in FAQ, thanks to Christian Reiber.
* Applied patch by Mitchell Perilstein for 5.005it and the
  two-argument binmode() that 5.005 doesn't support.
  (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34051)
* Applied patch by Emmanuel Rodriguez (POTYL) doing away with 
  hard-coded line numbers in 024WarnDieCarp.t to make it work
  cpan2rpm for building RPM packages 
  (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=35370)
* Fixed recreate_check_interval = 0 bug reported by 
  Bill Moseley.
* Added 'header_text' parameter to the file appender to 
  have it write a header every time it opens (or re-opens)
  a new log file (suggested by Steven Lembark).
* version 1.18

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  4 11:20:41 CEST 2008 - ug@suse.de

- version update from 1.12 to 1.15
- appender_thresholds_adjust() with a parameter of 0 now
  does nothing (requested by Oliver Koch).
- Added 'defer_connection' to Socket appender so it's more useful
  under Apache.
- [rt.cpan.org #32738] fixed caller_depth for error_warn()
  (reported by Felix Antonius Wilhelm Ostmann)
- [rt.cpan.org #32942] fixed get_logger() for subclassed Log4perl
  (reported by Felix Antonius Wilhelm Ostmann)
- Fixed test suite bug which surfaced in Darwin because temporary
  files contain '++' which freaked out the sloppy regex match.
- Better handling of empty config files (reported by Robert Raisch)
- Rewrote the Synchronized appender to use semaphores exclusivly
  (got rid of IPC::Shareable).
- Added Log::Log4perl::Util::Semaphore for easy semop handling
  Fixed t/026FileApp.t to work on MSWin32.
- Another doc fix by Craig
- Applied Fedora 7 patches
- Added create_at_logtime option to file appender
- Added trace level color (yellow) in ScreenColoredLevels
  appender as suggested by Arvind Jayaprakash in

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 16 12:00:29 CEST 2007 - ug@suse.de

- version update from 1.07 to 1.12
- Added Log::Log4perl::Resurrector to resurrect commented-out
  Log4perl statements in all subsequently loaded modules (allows
  for deploying L4p-enabled CPAN modules without requiring L4p).
- Added ALWAYS easy mode macro (level=OFF)
- Fixed logconfess() frame level bug reported by Ali Mesdaq.
  Added test case.
- Added PatternLayout::Multiline code by Cory Bennett to 
  render multiline messages.
- Added log level TRACE (lets through even more messages
  than DEBUG) (suggested by Craig).
- Added 'syswrite' flag to file appender to have it use
  'syswrite' instead of 'print', avoiding buffered or
  interleaving messages originating from different processes
  (thanks to Evan Miller).
- Nikita Dedik pointed out that Saturday is missing from 
  @Log::Log4perl::DateFormat::WEEK_DAYS
- Scott Cline noticed a potential problem with the DBI
  appender reconnection logic in 'buffered' mode. Applied
  a patch.
- Changed DBI reconnect logic to perform even if the DB
  is pingable again.

  to PropertyConfigurator.pm to allow pulling values from
  the property configurator by path.
- Added $^S check to FAQ, as suggested by J. David Blackstone.
- Applied Robert Jacobson's patch for the "DDD" formatter
  in L4p::DateFormats, which now formats the day-of-year values
  numerically and precedes them with zeroes if necessary.
- Added %M{x} PatternLayout notation as requested by
  Ankur Gupta.
- Another Win32 test suite fix, no longer deleting an open
  file but moving it aside (rt.cpan:23520).
- Applied test suite patch by Lars Thegler for 
  ancient perl 5.005_03.
- Applied patch by Jeremy Bopp to fix test suite running
  under Cygwin.
- Fixed documentation bug in L4p:Appender::File,
  s/recreate_signal/recreate_check_signal. Thanks to
  Todd Chapman and Robert Jacobson for reporting this.
- Fixed init(), which now deletes any config file watchers 
  left over from previous init_and_watch() calls. Reported
  by Andreas Koenig who saw sporadic errors in the test suite, 
  thanks!
