  <title>Class for easy date and time manipulation</title>
  <description>This module is intended to provide a general-purpose date and datetime
type for perl. You have a Class::Date class for absolute date and
datetime and have a Class::Date::Rel class for relative dates.

You can use &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; operators as with native perl data
types.</description>
