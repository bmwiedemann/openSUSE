  - Don't emit a failing test if there is a warning _after_ done_testing() is
    called. Based on PR #3 from Michael Alan Dorman.

  - Use IPC::Run3 instead of Capture::Tiny for all tests. This fixes an issue
    with the `tap-bug-in-test2.t` on Windows. Reported by Alexandr Ciornii and
    further diagnosed by Phil M. Perry. RT #129294.

  - Reverted back to using the Warning event type, since the bug in the Test2
    core that caused this to be a problem has since been fixed.
  
  - Replaced use of Test2::Bundle::Extended with Test2::V0.

  - Warnings inside a subtest were not emitted as TAP events, breaking the TAP
    and making for great confusion. This is because of a bug in the core TAP
    formatter - see https://github.com/Test-More/test-more/issues/776 for
    details. Warnings are now emitted as Ok events instead of Warning events.
