  - Reverted back to using the Warning event type, since the bug in the Test2
    core that caused this to be a problem has since been fixed.
  
  - Replaced use of Test2::Bundle::Extended with Test2::V0.

  - Warnings inside a subtest were not emitted as TAP events, breaking the TAP
    and making for great confusion. This is because of a bug in the core TAP
    formatter - see https://github.com/Test-More/test-more/issues/776 for
    details. Warnings are now emitted as Ok events instead of Warning events.
