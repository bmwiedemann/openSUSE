- Remove unused build dependency on mpir (gmp was used anyway)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  5 21:04:37 UTC 2023 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to gmpy2-2.1.5:
  * Final (?) release of the 2.1.x series. No code changes since 2.1.3.
    Fixes to build Apple Silicon binary builds are the only changes since
  * Latest release with minor bug fixes and support for Python 3.11

- Update to 2.1.2: 
  * Allow GIL release for mpz/xmpz/mpq types only.
  * Improve argument type processing by saving type information to
    decrease the number of type check calls. Especially helpful for mpfr and mpc types.
  * Avoid MPFR bug in mfr_fac_ui (gmpy2.factorial) on platforms where
        long is 32-bits and argument is >= 44787929.
  * Adjust test suite to reflect changes in output in MPFR 4.1.0.
  * Added cmp() and cmp_abs().
  * Improved compatibility with _numbers_ protocol.
  * Initial support for MPFR4
    + Add nrandom()
    + grandom() now calls nrandom twice; may return different values versus MPFR3
    + Add rootn(); same as root() except different sign when taking even root of -0.0
  * Thread-safe contexts are now supported. Properly integrating thread-safe contexts required
    an extensive rewrite of almost all internal functions.
  * MPFR and MPC are now required. It is no longer possible to build a version of gmpy2 that
    only supports the GMP library.
  * The function inverse() now raises an exception if the inverse does not exist.
  * Context methods have been added for MPFR/MPC related functions.
  * A new context option (rational_division) has been added that changes the behavior of
    integer division involving mpz instances to return a rational result instead of a
    floating point result.
  * gmpy2 types are now registered in the numeric tower.
- Remove unzip BuildRequires, as upstream has switched to tarballs.
