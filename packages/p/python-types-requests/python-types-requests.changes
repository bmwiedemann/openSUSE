- update to 2.32.0.20240914:
  * Correct requests `cookies` argument
  * requests: Session.adapters is a mapping of Adapters
  * Add hint for requests.models.Response.raw
  * requests: Add connection property (type HTTPAdapter) to the
    Response class
  * The `Response` instance is built by `HTTPAdapter`. When
    built, a property called `connection` is added to the
    `Response` that points back to the `HTTPAdapter` that created
    it. For example, this is used in the `requests` library's
    `HTTPDigestAuth` class to remake requests with credentials
    after authorization is requested by a server.
  * requests: Fix Response.content return type to include None
  * [requests] Update to 2.32.3
