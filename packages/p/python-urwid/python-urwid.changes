      'pack' so that left and right parameters are more useful and more
      child widgets are supported
    * New list walker "API Version 2" that is simpler for many list
      walker uses; "API Version 1" will still continue to be supported

      that calculate their own number of rows or columns

      container options
    * Pile and Columns widgets now accept any iterable to their
      __init__() methods

      an IndexError when read to be consistent with new common container
      API
    * GridFlow now supports multiple cell widths within the same widget

      use the sizing() function or _sizing attribute to specify the

      xterm are now recognized
