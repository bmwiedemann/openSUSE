  <title>PC/SC IFD Handler for the ECO 5000 Serial Smart Card Reader</title>
  <description>Driver for the ECO 5000 Serial Smart Card Reader.

This driver is meant to be used with the PCSC-Lite daemon from the
pcsc-lite package.

This interface allows access to the terminal using the Card Terminal
Basic Command Set (CT-BCS). This driver also includes the support for
memory cards, exposed as Interindustry Command Set for Synchronous
Cards.

The CT-API driver supports the IFD Handler interface from PC/SC.

Please take a look in the included README document for further
information.

This driver only works with the serial interface version of the ECO
5000. ORGA also sells a USB version, that is incompatible with the
serial version. This driver will not work with the USB version!</description>
