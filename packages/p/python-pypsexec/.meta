  <title>Run commands on a remote Windows host using SMB/RPC</title>
  <description>This library can run commands on a remote Windows host through Python.
This means that it can be run on any host with Python and does not
require any binaries to be present or a specific OS. It uses SMB/RPC to
executable commands in a similar fashion to the popular PsExec tool.
