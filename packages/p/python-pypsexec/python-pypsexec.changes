- Update to version 0.2.0
  * Breaking change where processes are run as the native
    architecture bitness, e.g. 64-bit on 64-bit OS' and 32-bit on
    32-bit OS'
    This changes the old behaviour of always running as a 32-bit
    process. Any application relying on running with 32-bit paths
    will need to set wow64=True on run_executable() to restore the
    older behaviour.
  * Dropped support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.4.
  * Updated the PAExec executable to 1.27.
  * Handle non-ASCII characters when enumerating the services on
    the remote host.
