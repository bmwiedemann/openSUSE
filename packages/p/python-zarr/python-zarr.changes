- update to version 2.13.0:
  * Major changes
    + Support of alternative array classes by introducing a new
      argument, meta_array, that specifies the type/class of the
      underlying array. The meta_array argument can be any class
      instance that can be used as the like argument in NumPy (see NEP
      35). enabling support for CuPy through, for example, the
      creation of a CuPy CPU compressor. By Mads R. B. Kristensen
      #934.
    + Remove support for Python 3.7 in concert with NumPy
      dependency. By Davis Bennett #1067.
    + Zarr v3: add support for the default root path rather than
      requiring that all API users pass an explicit path. By Gregory
      R. Lee #1085, #1142.
  * Bug fixes
    + Remove/relax erroneous “meta” path check (regression). By
      Gregory R. Lee #1123.
    + Cast all attribute keys to strings (and issue deprecation
      warning). By Mattia Almansi #1066.
    + Fix bug in N5 storage that prevented arrays located in the root
      of the hierarchy from bearing the n5 keyword. Along with fixing
      this bug, new tests were added for N5 routines that had
      previously been excluded from testing, and type annotations were
      added to the N5 codebase. By Davis Bennett #1092.
    + Fix bug in LRUEStoreCache in which the current size wasn’t reset
      on invalidation. By BGCMHou and Josh Moore #1076, #1077.
    + Remove erroneous check that disallowed array keys starting with
      “meta”. By Gregory R. Lee #1105.
  * Documentation
    + Typo fixes to close quotes. By Pavithra Eswaramoorthy
    + Added copy button to documentation. By Altay Sansal #1124.
  * Maintenance
    + Simplify release docs. By Josh Moore #1119.
    + Pin werkzeug to prevent test hangs. By Davis Bennett #1098.
    + Fix a few DeepSource.io alerts By Dimitri Papadopoulos Orfanos
      #1080.
    + Fix URLs. By Dimitri Papadopoulos Orfanos, #1074.
    + Fix spelling. By Dimitri Papadopoulos Orfanos, #1073.
    + Update GitHub issue templates with YAML format. By Saransh
      Chopra #1079.

      #1068.
    + Fix a typo of “integers”. By Richard Scott #1056.

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 2.12.0:
  * Enhancements
    + Add support for reading and writing Zarr V3. The new
      zarr._store.v3 package has the necessary classes and functions
      for evaluating Zarr V3. Since the format is not yet finalized,
      the classes and functions are not automatically imported into
      the regular zarr name space. Setting the
      ZARR_V3_EXPERIMENTAL_API environment variable will activate
      them. By Greggory Lee; #898, #1006, and #1007 as well as by Josh
      Moore #1032.
    + Create FSStore from an existing fsspec filesystem. If you have
      created an fsspec filesystem outside of Zarr, you can now pass
      it as a keyword argument to FSStore. By Ryan Abernathey; #911.
    + Add numpy encoder class for json.dumps By Eric Prestat; #933.
    + Appending performance improvement to Zarr arrays, e.g., when
      writing to S3. By hailiangzhang; #1014.
    + Add number encoder for json.dumps to support numpy intergers in
      chunks arguments. By Eric Prestat #697.
  * Bug fixes
    + Fix bug that made it impossible to create an FSStore on
      unlistable filesystems (e.g. some HTTP servers). By Ryan
      Abernathey; #993.
  * Documentation
    + Update resize doc to clarify surprising behavior. By
      hailiangzhang; #1022.
  * Maintenance
    + Added Pre-commit configuration, incl. Yaml Check. By Shivank
      Chaudhary; #1015, #1016.
    + Fix URL to renamed file in Blosc repo. By Andrew Thomas #1028.
    + Activate Py 3.10 builds. By Josh Moore #1027.
    + Make all unignored zarr warnings errors. By Josh Moore #1021.

- changes from version 2.11.3:
  * Bug fixes
    + Fix missing case to fully revert change to default
      write_empty_chunks. By Tom White; #1005.

- changes from version 2.11.2:
  * Bug fixes
    + Changes the default value of write_empty_chunks to True to
      prevent unanticipated data losses when the data types do not
      have a proper default value when empty chunks are read back
      in. By Vyas Ramasubramani; #965, #1001.

- changes from version 2.11.1:
  * Bug fixes
    + Fix bug where indexing with a scalar numpy value returned a
      single-value array. By Ben Jeffery #967.
    + Removed clobber argument from normalize_store_arg. This enables
      to change data within a opened consolidated group using mode
      “r+” (i.e region write). By Tobias Kölling #975.

- changes from version 2.11.0:
  * Enhancements
    + Sparse changes with performance impact! One of the advantages of
      the Zarr format is that it is sparse, which means that chunks
      with no data (more precisely, with data equal to the fill value,
      which is usually 0) don’t need to be written to disk at
      all. They will simply be assumed to be empty at read
      time. However, until this release, the Zarr library would write
      these empty chunks to disk anyway. This changes in this version:
      a small performance penalty at write time leads to significant
      speedups at read time and in filesystem operations in the case
      of sparse arrays. To revert to the old behavior, pass the
      argument write_empty_chunks=True to the array creation
      function. By Juan Nunez-Iglesias; #853 and Davis Bennett; #738.
    + Fancy indexing. Zarr arrays now support NumPy-style fancy
      indexing with arrays of integer coordinates. This is equivalent
      to using zarr.Array.vindex. Mixing slices and integer arrays is
      not supported. By Juan Nunez-Iglesias; #725.
    + New base class. This release of Zarr Python introduces a new
      BaseStore class that all provided store classes implemented in
      Zarr Python now inherit from. This is done as part of
      refactoring to enable future support of the Zarr version 3
      spec. Existing third-party stores that are a MutableMapping
      (e.g. dict) can be converted to a new-style key/value store
      inheriting from BaseStore by passing them as the argument to the
      new zarr.storage.KVStore class. For backwards compatibility,
      various higher-level array creation and convenience functions
      still accept plain Python dicts or other mutable mappings for
      the store argument, but will internally convert these to a
      KVStore. By Greggory Lee; #839, #789, and #950.
    + Allow to assign array fill_values and update metadata
      accordingly. By Ryan Abernathey, #662.
    + Allow to update array fill_values By Matthias Bussonnier #665.
  * Bug fixes
    + Fix bug where the checksum of zipfiles is wrong By Oren Watson
      #930.
    + Fix consolidate_metadata with FSStore. By Joe Hamman #916.
    + Unguarded next inside generator. By Dimitri Papadopoulos Orfanos
      #889.
  * Documentation
    + Update docs creation of dev env. By Ray Bell #921.
    + Update docs to use python -m pytest. By Ray Bell #923.
    + Fix versionadded tag in zarr.core.Array docstring. By Juan
      Nunez-Iglesias #852.
    + Doctest seem to be stricter now, updating tostring() to
      tobytes(). By John Kirkham #907.
    + Minor doc fix. By Mads R. B. Kristensen #937.
  * Maintenance
    + Upgrade MongoDB in test env. By Joe Hamman #939.
    + Pass dimension_separator on fixture generation. By Josh Moore
      #858.
    + Activate Python 3.9 in GitHub Actions. By Josh Moore #859.
    + Drop shortcut fsspec[s3] for dependency. By Josh Moore #920.
    + and a swath of code-linting improvements by Dimitri Papadopoulos
