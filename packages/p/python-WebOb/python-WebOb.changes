Tue Mar  2 00:33:29 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.8.7:
  - Decoding deflate-encoded responses now supports data which is packed in
    a zlib container as it is supposed to be. The old, non-standard behaviour
    is still supported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 11 08:52:29 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.8.6:
  - The SameSite value now includes a new option named "None", this is a new
   change that was introduced in
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  7 09:55:07 UTC 2019 - Thomas Bechtold <tbechtold@suse.com>

update to 1.8.5:
  - Fixed one last remaining invalid escape sequence in a docstring.
  - Response.content_type now accepts unicode strings on Python 2 and encodes
    them to latin-1. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/389 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/388
  - Accept header classes now support a .copy() function that may be used to
    create a copy. This allows ``create_accept_header`` and other like functions
    to accept an pre-existing Accept header. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/386 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/385
  - Some backslashes introduced with the new accept handling code were causing
    DeprecationWarnings upon compiling the source to pyc files, all of the
    backslashes have been reigned in as appropriate, and users should no longer
    see DeprecationWarnings for invalid escape sequence. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/384
  - ``acceptparse.AcceptValidHeader``, ``acceptparse.AcceptInvalidHeader``, and
    ``acceptparse.AcceptNoHeader`` will now always ignore offers that do not
    match the required media type grammar when calling ``.acceptable_offers()``.
    Previous versions raised a ``ValueError`` for invalid offers in
    ``AcceptValidHeader`` and returned them as acceptable in the others.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/372
  - Add Request.remote_host, exposing REMOTE_HOST environment variable.
  - Added ``acceptparse.Accept.parse_offer`` to codify what types of offers
    are compatible with ``acceptparse.AcceptValidHeader.acceptable_offers``,
    ``acceptparse.AcceptMissingHeader.acceptable_offers``, and
    ``acceptparse.AcceptInvalidHeader.acceptable_offers``. This API also
    normalizes the offer with lowercased type/subtype and parameter names.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/376 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/379

- Use %license macro
- Use proper upstream tarball
- Really execute tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  9 06:42:35 UTC 2018 - comurphy@suse.com

- Update to 1.8.2:
  - SameSite may now be passed as str or bytes to `Response.set_cookie` and
    `cookies.make_cookie`. This was an oversight as all other arguments would be
    correctly coerced before being serialized. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/361 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/362
  - acceptparse.MIMEAccept which is deprecated in WebOb 1.8.0 made a backwards
    incompatible change that led to it raising on an invalid Accept header. This
    behaviour has now been reversed, as well as some other fixes to allow
    MIMEAccept to behave more like the old version. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/356
  - ``request.POST`` now supports any requests with the appropriate
    Content-Type. Allowing any HTTP method to access form encoded content,
    including DELETE, PUT, and others. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/352
  - WebOb is no longer officially supported on Python 3.3 which was EOL'ed on
    2017-09-29.
  - Many changes have been made to the way WebOb does Accept handling, not just
    for the Accept header itself, but also for Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding
    and Accept-Language. This was a `Google Summer of Code
    <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/>`_ project completed by
    Whiteroses (https://github.com/whiteroses). Many thanks to Google for running
    GSoC, the Python Software Foundation for organising and a huge thanks to Ira
    for completing the work. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/338 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/335. Documentation is available at
    https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/webob/en/master/api/webob.html
  - The cookie APIs now have the ability to set the SameSite attribute on a
    cookie in both ``webob.cookies.make_cookie`` and
    ``webob.cookies.CookieProfile``. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/255
  - Exceptions now use string.Template.safe_substitute rather than
    string.Template.substitute. The latter would raise for missing mappings, the
    former will simply not substitute the missing variable. This is safer in case
    the WSGI environ does not contain the keys necessary for the body template.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/345.
  - Request.host_url, Request.host_port, Request.domain correctly parse IPv6 Host
    headers as provided by a browser. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/332
  - Request.authorization would raise ValueError for unusual or malformed header
    values. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/231
  - Allow unnamed fields in form data to be properly transcoded when calling
    request.decode with an alternate encoding. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/309
  - ``Response.__init__`` would discard ``app_iter`` when a ``Response`` had no
    body, this would cause issues when ``app_iter`` was an object that was tied
    to the life-cycle of a web application and had to be properly closed.
    ``app_iter`` is more advanced API for ``Response`` and thus even if it
    contains a body and is thus against the HTTP RFC's, we should let the users
    shoot themselves by returning a body. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/305
  - When calling a ``@wsgify`` decorated function, the default arguments passed
    to ``@wsgify`` are now used when called with the request, and not as a
    `start_response`

    .. code::

       def hello(req, name):
           return "Hello, %s!" % name
       app = wsgify(hello, args=("Fred",))

       req = Request.blank('/')
       resp = req.get_response(app)  # => "Hello, Fred"
       resp2 = app(req) # => "Hello, Fred"

    Previously the ``resp2`` line would have failed with a ``TypeError``. With
    this change there is no way to override the default arguments with no
    arguments. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/203
  - When setting ``app_iter`` on a ``Response`` object the ``content_md5`` header
    is no longer cleared. This behaviour is odd and disallows setting the
    ``content_md5`` and then returning an iterator for chunked content encoded
    responses. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/86

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    request.decode with an alternate encoding. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/309
- Switch to singlespec approach

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 10 16:14:42 UTC 2017 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 1.7.1:
  - ``Response.__init__`` would discard ``app_iter`` when a ``Response`` had no
    body, this would cause issues when ``app_iter`` was an object that was tied
    to the life-cycle of a web application and had to be properly closed.
    ``app_iter`` is more advanced API for ``Response`` and thus even if it
    contains a body and is thus against the HTTP RFC's, we should let the users
    shoot themselves by returning a body. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/305
  - WebOb is no longer supported on Python 2.6 and PyPy3 (due to pip no longer
    supporting Python 3.2 even on PyPy)
  - ``Response.content_type`` removes all existing Content-Type parameters, and
    if the new Content-Type is "texty" it adds a new charset (unless already
    provided) using the ``default_charset``. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/301
  - ``Response.set_cookie`` no longer accepts a key argument. This was deprecated
    in WebOb 1.5 and as mentioned in the deprecation, is being removed in 1.7
  - ``Response.__init__`` will no longer set the default Content-Type, nor
    Content-Length on Responses that don't have a body. This allows WebOb to
    return proper responses for things like `Response(status='204 No Content')`.
  - ``Response.text`` will no longer raise if the Content-Type does not have a
    charset, it will fall back to using the new ``default_body_encoding`. To get
    the old behaviour back please sub-class ``Response`` and set
    ``default_body_encoding`` to ``None``. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/287
  - WebOb no longer supports Chunked Encoding, this means that if you are using
    WebOb and need Chunked Encoding you will be required to have a proxy that
    unchunks the request for you. Please read
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/279 for more background.
  - ``Response`` has a new ``default_body_encoding`` which may be used to allow
    getting/setting ``Response.text`` when a Content-Type has no charset. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/287
  - ``webob.Request`` with any HTTP method is now allowed to have a body. This
    allows DELETE to have a request body for passing extra information. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/283 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/274
  - Add ``tell()`` to ``ResponseBodyFile`` so that it may be used for example for
    zipfile support. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/117
  - Allow the return from ``wsgify.middleware`` to be used as a decorator. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/228
  - Fixup ``cgi.FieldStorage`` on Python 3.x to work-around issue reported in
    Python bug report 27777 and 24764. This is currently applied for Python
    versions less than 3.7. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/294 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/300
  - ``Response.set_cookie`` now accepts ``datetime`` objects for the ``expires``
    kwarg and will correctly convert them to UTC with no tzinfo for use in
    calculating the ``max_age``. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/254
    and https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/292
  - Fixes ``request.PATH_SAFE`` to contain all of the path safe characters
    according to RFC3986. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/291
  - WebOb's exceptions will lazily read underlying variables when inserted into
    templates to avoid expensive computations/crashes when inserting into the
    template. This had a bad performance regression on Py27 because of the way
    the lazified class was created and returned. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/284
  - ``wsgify.__call__`` raised a ``TypeError`` with an unhelpful message, it will
    now return the ``repr`` for the wrapped function:
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/119
  - ``Response.json``'s ``json.dumps``/``json.loads`` are now always UTF-8. It no
    longer tries to use the charset.
  - The ``Response.__init__`` will by default no longer set the Content-Type to
    the default if a ``headerlist`` is provided. This fixes issues whereby
    ``Request.get_response()`` would return a Response that didn't match the
    actual response. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/261 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/205
  - Cleans up the remainder of the issues with the updated WebOb exceptions that
    were taught to return JSON in version 1.6. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/237 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/236
  - ``Response.from_file`` now parses the status line correctly when the status
    line contains an HTTP with version, as well as a status text that contains
    multiple white spaces (e.g HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found). See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/250
  - ``Response`` now has a new property named ``has_body`` that may be used to
    interrogate the ``Response`` to find out if ``Response.body`` is or isn't
    set.
    This is used in the exception handling code so that if you use a WebOb HTTP
    Exception and pass a generator to ``app_iter`` WebOb won't attempt to read
    the whole thing and instead allows it to be returned to the WSGI server. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/259

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 09:37:15 UTC 2016 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.6.2:
 * WebOb's exceptions will lazily read underlying variables when inserted into
   templates to avoid expensive computations/crashes when inserting into the
   template. This had a bad performance regression on Py27 because of the way
   the lazified class was created and returned. See
   https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/284

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  3 16:30:52 UTC 2016 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 1.6.1:
  - Response.from_file now parses the status line correctly when the status line
    contains an HTTP with version, as well as a status text that contains
    multiple white spaces (e.g 404 Not Found). See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/250
  - Python 3.2 is no longer supported by WebOb
  - Request.decode attempted to read from the an already consumed stream, it has
    now been redirected to another stream to read from. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/183
  - The application/json media type does not allow for a charset as discovery of
    the encoding is done at the JSON layer. Upon initialization of a Response
    WebOb will no longer add a charset if the content-type is set to JSON. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/197 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1611
  - Lazily HTML escapes environment keys in HTTP Exceptions so that those keys in
    the environ that are not used in the output of the page don't raise an
    exception due to inability to be properly escaped. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/139
  - MIMEAccept now accepts comparisons against wildcards, this allows one to
    match on just the media type or sub-type, without having to explicitly match
    on both the media type and sub-type at the same time. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/185
  - Add the ability to return a JSON body from an exception. Using the Accept
    information in the request, the exceptions will now automatically return a
    JSON version of the exception instead of just HTML or text. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/230 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/209
  - exc._HTTPMove and any subclasses will now raise a ValueError if the location
    field contains a line feed or carriage return. These values may lead to
    possible HTTP Response Splitting. The header_getter descriptor has also been
    modified to no longer accept headers with a line feed or carriage return.
    See: https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/229 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/217

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 14 14:38:13 UTC 2015 - aplanas@suse.com

- updateto version 1.5.1:
  * (Bug Fixes) The exceptions HTTPNotAcceptable,
    HTTPUnsupportedMediaType and HTTPNotImplemented will now correctly
    use the sub-classed template rather than the default error
    template. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/221
  * (Bug Fixes) Response’s from_file now correctly deals with a status
    line that contains an HTTP version identifier. HTTP/1.1 200 OK is
    now correctly parsed, whereas before this would raise an error
    upon setting the Response.status in from_file. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/121
- 1.5.0
  * (Bug Fixes) The cookie API functions will now make sure that
    max_age is an integer or an string that can convert to an
    integer. Previously passing in max_age=’test’ would have silently
    done the wrong thing.
- 1.5.0b0
  * (Bug Fixes) Unbreak req.POST when the request method is
    PATCH. Instead of returning something cmpletely unrelated we
    return NoVar. See: https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/215
  * (Features) HTTP Status Code 308 is now supported as a Permanent
    Redirect. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/207
- 1.5.0a1
  * (Backwards Incompatibilities) Response.set_cookie renamed the only
    required parameter from “key” to “name”. The code will now still
    accept “key” as a keyword argument, and will issue a
    DeprecationWarning until WebOb 1.7.
  * (Backwards Incompatibilities) The status attribute of a Response
    object no longer takes a string like None None and allows that to
    be set as the status. It now has to at least match the pattern of
    <integer status code> <explenation of status code>. Invalid status
    strings will now raise a ValueError.
- 1.5.0a0
  * (Backwards Incompatibilities) Morsel will no longer accept a
    cookie value that does not meet RFC6265’s cookie-octet
    specification. Upon calling Morsel.serialize a warning will be
    issued, in the future this will raise a ValueError, please update
    your cookie handling code. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/172
  * (Backwards Incompatibilities) Response.set_cookie now uses the
    internal make_cookie API, which will issue warnings if cookies are
    set with invalid bytes. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/172
  * (Features) Add support for some new caching headers,
    stale-while-revalidate and stale-if-error that can be used by
    reverse proxies to cache stale responses temporarily if the
    backend disappears. From RFC5861. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/189
  * (Bug Fixes) Response.status now uses duck-typing for integers, and
    has also learned to raise a ValueError if the status isn’t an
    integer followed by a space, and then the reason. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/191
  * (Bug Fixes) Fixed a bug in webob.multidict.GetDict which resulted
    in the QUERY_STRING not being updated when changes were made to
    query params using Request.GET.extend().
  * (Bug Fixes) Read the body of a request if we think it might have a
    body. This fixes PATCH to support bodies. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/184
  * (Bug Fixes) Response.from_file returns HTTP headers as latin1
    rather than UTF-8, this fixes the usage on Google AppEngine. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/99 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/150
  * (Bug Fixes) Fix a bug in parsing the auth parameters that
    contained bad white space. This makes the parsing fall in line
    with what’s required in RFC7235. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/158
  * (Bug Fixes) Use ‘rn’ line endings in Response.__str__. See:
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/146
  * (Documentation Changes) response.set_cookie now has proper
    documentation for max_age and expires. The code has also been
    refactored to use cookies.make_cookie instead of duplicating the
    code. This fixes https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/166 and
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/171
  * (Documentation Changes) Documentation didn’t match the actual code
    for the wsgify function signature. See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/167
  * (Documentation Changes) Remove the WebDAV only from certain HTTP
    Exceptions, these exceptions may also be used by REST services for
    example.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 15 05:01:59 UTC 2014 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to version 1.4:
  * Remove ``webob.__version__``, the version number had not been kept in sync
    with the official pkg version.  To obtain the WebOb version number, use
    ``pkg_resources.get_distribution('webob').version`` instead.
  * Fix a bug in ``EmptyResponse`` that prevents it from setting self.close as
    appropriate due to testing truthiness of object rather than if it is
    something other than ``None``.
  * Fix a bug in ``SignedSerializer`` preventing secrets from containing
    higher-order characters. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/136
  * Use the ``hmac.compare_digest`` method when available for constant-time
    comparisons.
  * Fix a bug in ``SignedCookieProfile`` whereby we didn't keep the original
    serializer around, this would cause us to have ``SignedSerializer`` be added
    on top of a ``SignedSerializer`` which would cause it to be run twice when
    attempting to verify a cookie.  See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/127
  * Backwards Incompatible change: When ``CookieProfile.get_value`` and
    ``SignedCookieProfile.get_value`` fails to deserialize a badly encoded
    value, we now return ``None`` as if the cookie was never set in the first
    place instead of allowing a ``ValueError`` to be raised to the calling code.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/126
  * Added a read-only ``domain`` property to ``BaseRequest``.  This property
    returns the domain portion of the host value.  For example, if the
    environment contains an ``HTTP_HOST`` value of ``foo.example.com:8000``,
    ``request.domain`` will return ``foo.example.com``.
  * Added five new APIs: ``webob.cookies.CookieProfile``,
    ``webob.cookies.SignedCookieProfile``, ``webob.cookies.JSONSerializer`` and
    ``webob.cookies.SignedSerializer``, and ``webob.cookies.make_cookie``. These
    APIs are convenience APIs for generating and parsing cookie headers as well
    as dealing with signing cookies.
  * Cookies generated via webob.cookies quoted characters in cookie values that
    did not need to be quoted per RFC 6265.  The following characters are no
    longer quoted in cookie values: ``~/=<>()[]{}?@`` .  The full set of
    non-letter-or-digit unquoted cookie value characters is now
    ``!#$%&'*+-.^_`|~/: =<>()[]{}?@``.  See
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1.1 for more information.
  * Cookie names are now restricted to the set of characters expected by RFC
    6265.  Previously they could contain unsupported characters such as ``/``.
  * Older versions of Webob escaped the doublequote to ``\"`` and the backslash
    to ``\\`` when quoting cookie values.  Now, instead, cookie serialization
    generates ``\042`` for the doublequote and ``\134`` for the backslash. This
    is what is expected as per RFC 6265.  Note that old cookie values that do
    have the older style quoting in them will still be unquoted correctly,
    however.
  * Added support for draft status code 451 ("Unavailable for Legal Reasons").
    See http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-00
  * Added status codes 428, 429, 431 and 511 to ``util.status_reasons`` (they
    were already present in a previous release as ``webob.exc`` exceptions).
  * MIMEAccept happily parsed malformed wildcard strings like "image/pn*" at
    parse time, but then threw an AssertionError during matching.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/83 .
  * Preserve document ordering of GET and POST request data when POST data
    passed to Request.blank is a MultiDict.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/96
  * Allow query strings attached to PATCH requests to populate request.params.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/106
  * Added Python 3.3 trove classifier.

  * Fix multiple calls to ``cache_expires()`` not fully overriding the
    previously set headers.
  * Fix parsing of form submissions where fields have different encodings.
- Many changes between versions 1.1.1 and 1.2.1.  Please see docs/news.txt
  for full details.  Major changes include support for only Python 3.2, 2.7,
  2.6.

- Update to version 1.1.1:
  * Fix disconnect detection being incorrect in some cases
  * Fix exception when calling .accept.best_match(..) on a header containing
    '*' (instead of '*/*')

    (the app can now offer a generic 'en' and it will match any of the
    accepted dialects) and 'en_GB' in AcceptLanguage('en-gb') (normalization
    of the dash/underscode in language names).
  * Deprecate req.etag.weak_match(..)
  * Deprecate Response.request and Response.environ attrs.
