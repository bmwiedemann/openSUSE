    <comment>- update to 4.0.0:
  * Fixed ``@typechecked`` optimization causing compilation of
    instrumented code to fail  when an ``if`` block was left
    empty by the AST transformer
  * Fixed the AST transformer trying to parse the second argument
    of ``typing.Annotated`` as a forward reference
  * Added ``InstrumentationWarning`` to the public API
  * Changed ``@typechecked`` to skip instrumentation in optimized
    mode, as in typeguard 2.x
  * Avoid type checks where the types in question are shadowed by
    local variables
  * Fixed instrumentation using ``typing.Optional`` without a
    subscript when the subscript value was erased due to
    being an ignored import
  * Fixed ``TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type or tuple
    of types`` when instrumented code tries to check a value
    against a naked (``str``, not ``ForwardRef``)
  * forward reference
  * Fixed instrumentation using the wrong &quot;self&quot; type in the
    ``__new__()`` method
  * Fixed imports guarded by ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` when used with
    subscripts
  * (``SomeType[...]``) being replaced with ``Any[...]`` instead
    of just ``Any``
  * Fixed instrumentation inadvertently mutating a function's
    annotations on Python 3.7 and 3.8
  * Fixed ``Concatenate[...]`` in ``Callable`` parameters causing
    ``TypeError`` to be raised
  * Fixed type checks for ``*args`` or ``**kwargs`` not being
    suppressed when their types are unusable</comment>

    <comment>- update to 4.1.5:
  * Fixed ``Callable`` erroneously rejecting a callable that has
    the requested amount of positional arguments but they have
    defaults
  * Fixed a regression introduced in v4.1.4 where the elements of
    ``Literal`` got quotes removed from them by the AST transformer
  * Fixed ``AttributeError`` where the transformer removed
    elements from a PEP 604 union
  * Fixed ``AttributeError: 'Subscript' object has no attribute
    'slice'`` when encountering an annotation with a subscript
    containing an ignored type
  * Fixed type checking not being skipped when the target is a
    union (PEP 604 or ``typing.Union``) where one of the elements
    is an ignored type (shadowed by an argument, variable
    assignment or an ``if TYPE_CHECKING`` import)
  * Dropped Python 3.7 support
  * Fixed ``@typechecked`` optimization causing compilation of
    instrumented code to fail when any block was left empty by the
    AST transformer (eg ``if`` or ``try`` / ``except`` blocks)
  * Fixed placement of injected typeguard imports with respect to
    ``__future__`` imports and module docstrings
  * Fixed ``Any`` being removed from a subscript that still
    contains other elements
  * Fixed ``suppress_type_checks()`` causing annotated variable
    assignments to always assign ``None``
  * Added support for passing a tuple as ``expected_type`` to
    ``check_type()``, making it more of a drop-in replacement for
    ``isinstance()``
  * Fixed regression where ``Literal`` inside a ``Union`` had
    quotes stripped from its contents, thus typically causing</comment>

  * Added support for checking against static protocols
  * Fixed some compatibility problems when running on Python 3.13
  * Fixed test suite incompatibility with pytest 8.2
  * Fixed pytest plugin crashing on pytest version older than

  * Fixed deprecation warning in the test suite on Python 3.13
  * Added support for specifying options for the pytest plugin
    via pytest config files

    located within a subscript
  * Fixed TypedDict from typing_extensions not being recognized
    as one
  * Fixed typing types (dict[str, int], List[str], etc.) not
    passing checks against type or Type

    TypedDict when using forward references
  * Fixed mapping checks against Django's MultiValueDict</comment>
