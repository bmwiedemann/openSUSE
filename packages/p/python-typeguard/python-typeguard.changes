Mon Dec  4 11:32:09 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.1.5:
  * Fixed ``Callable`` erroneously rejecting a callable that has
    the requested amount of positional arguments but they have
    defaults
  * Fixed a regression introduced in v4.1.4 where the elements of
    ``Literal`` got quotes removed from them by the AST transformer
  * Fixed ``AttributeError`` where the transformer removed
    elements from a PEP 604 union
  * Fixed ``AttributeError: 'Subscript' object has no attribute
    'slice'`` when encountering an annotation with a subscript
    containing an ignored type
  * Fixed type checking not being skipped when the target is a
    union (PEP 604 or ``typing.Union``) where one of the elements
    is an ignored type (shadowed by an argument, variable
    assignment or an ``if TYPE_CHECKING`` import)
  * Dropped Python 3.7 support
  * Fixed ``@typechecked`` optimization causing compilation of
    instrumented code to fail when any block was left empty by the
    AST transformer (eg ``if`` or ``try`` / ``except`` blocks)
  * Fixed placement of injected typeguard imports with respect to
    ``__future__`` imports and module docstrings
  * Fixed ``Any`` being removed from a subscript that still
    contains other elements
  * Fixed ``suppress_type_checks()`` causing annotated variable
    assignments to always assign ``None``
  * Added support for passing a tuple as ``expected_type`` to
    ``check_type()``, making it more of a drop-in replacement for
    ``isinstance()``
  * Fixed regression where ``Literal`` inside a ``Union`` had
    quotes stripped from its contents, thus typically causing
    ``NameError`` to be raised when run
  * Fixed handling of ``typing_extensions.Literal`` on Python 3.8
    and 3.9 when ``typing_extensions>=4.6.0`` is installed
  * Fixed ``NameError`` when generated type checking code
    references an imported name from a method
  * Fixed docstrings disappearing from instrumented functions
  * Fixed ``@typechecked`` failing to instrument functions when
    there are more than one function within the same scope
  * Fixed ``frozenset`` not being checked

Sun May 14 16:35:53 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.0.0:
  * Fixed ``@typechecked`` optimization causing compilation of
    instrumented code to fail  when an ``if`` block was left
    empty by the AST transformer
  * Fixed the AST transformer trying to parse the second argument
    of ``typing.Annotated`` as a forward reference
  * Added ``InstrumentationWarning`` to the public API
  * Changed ``@typechecked`` to skip instrumentation in optimized
    mode, as in typeguard 2.x
  * Avoid type checks where the types in question are shadowed by
    local variables
  * Fixed instrumentation using ``typing.Optional`` without a
    subscript when the subscript value was erased due to
    being an ignored import
  * Fixed ``TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type or tuple
    of types`` when instrumented code tries to check a value
    against a naked (``str``, not ``ForwardRef``)
  * forward reference
  * Fixed instrumentation using the wrong "self" type in the
    ``__new__()`` method
  * Fixed imports guarded by ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` when used with
    subscripts
  * (``SomeType[...]``) being replaced with ``Any[...]`` instead
    of just ``Any``
  * Fixed instrumentation inadvertently mutating a function's
    annotations on Python 3.7 and 3.8
  * Fixed ``Concatenate[...]`` in ``Callable`` parameters causing
    ``TypeError`` to be raised
  * Fixed type checks for ``*args`` or ``**kwargs`` not being
    suppressed when their types are unusable
    (guarded by ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` or otherwise)
  * Fixed ``TypeError`` when checking against a generic
    ``NewType``
  * Don't try to check types shadowed by argument names (e.g.
  * ``def foo(x: type, type: str): ...``)
  * Don't check against unions where one of the elements is
  * Fixed ``typing.Literal`` subscript contents being evaluated
    as forward references
  * Fixed resolution of forward references in type aliases
  * The ``.pyc`` files now use a version-based optimization
    suffix in the file names so as not to cause the
    interpreter to load potentially faulty/incompatible cached
    bytecode generated by older versions
  * Fixed typed variable positional and keyword arguments causing
    compilation errors on Python 3.7 and 3.8
  * Fixed compilation error when a type annotation contains a
    type guarded by ``if TYPE_CHECKING:``
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** ``check_type()`` no longer uses the
    global configuration.
  * It now uses the default configuration values, unless
    overridden with an explicit ``config`` argument.
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed ``CallMemo`` from the API
  * **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Required checkers to use the
    configuration from ``memo.config``, rather than the global
    configuration
  * Added keyword arguments to ``@typechecked``, allowing users
    to override settings on a per-function basis
  * Added support for using ``suppress_type_checks()`` as a
    decorator
  * Added support for type checking against nonlocal classes
    defined within the same
  * parent function as the instrumented function
  * Changed instrumentation to statically copy the function
    annotations to avoid having to
  * look up the function object at run time
  * Improved support for avoiding type checks against imports
    declared in ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` blocks
  * Fixed ``check_type`` not returning the passed value when
    checking against ``Any``, or when type checking is being
    suppressed
  * Fixed ``suppress_type_checks()`` not ending the suppression
    if the context block raises an exception
  * Fixed checking non-dictionary objects against a ``TypedDict``
    annotation

Fri May  5 09:24:37 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.0.2:
  * Improved warnings by ensuring that they target user code and
    not Typeguard internal code
  * Fixed ``warn_on_error()`` not showing where the type
    violation actually occurred
  * Fixed local assignment to ``*args`` or ``**kwargs`` being
    type checked incorrectly
  * Fixed ``TypeError`` on ``check_type(..., None)``
  * Fixed unpacking assignment not working with a starred
    variable (``x, *y = ...``) in
  * the target tuple
  * Fixed variable multi-assignment (``a = b = c = ...``) being
    type checked incorrectly
  * Improved the documentation
  * Fixed assignment unpacking (``a, b = ...``) being checked
    incorrectly
  * Fixed ``@typechecked`` attempting to instrument wrapper
    decorators such as
  * ``@contextmanager`` when applied to a class

    from a git checkout
  * Dropped the ``argname``, ``memo``, ``globals`` and
    ``locals`` arguments from ``check_type()``
  * Removed the ``check_argument_types()`` and ``check_return_type()``
    functions (use ``@typechecked`` instead)
  * Moved ``install_import_hook`` to be directly importable from
    the ``typeguard`` module
  * Changed the checking of collections
    (list, set, dict, sequence, mapping) to only check the
    first item by default.  To get the old behavior,
    set ``typeguard.config.collection_check_strategy`` to
    ``CollectionCheckStrategy.ALL_ITEMS``
  * Type checking failures now raise
    typeguard.TypeCheckError instead of TypeError
  * Dropped Python 3.5 and 3.6 support
  * Dropped the deprecated profiler hook (``TypeChecker``)
  * Added a configuration system
  * Added support for custom type checking functions
  * Added support for PEP 604 union types (``X | Y``) on all
    Python versions

  * Added the possibility to have the import hook instrument all
    packages
  * Added the ``suppress_type_checks()`` context manager function
    for temporarily disabling type checks
  * Changed ``check_type()`` to return the passed value, so it
    can be used (to an extent) in place of ``typing.cast()``,
    but with run-time type checking
  * Replaced custom implementation of ``is_typeddict()`` with the
    implementation from ``typing_extensions`` v4.1.0
  * Emit ``InstrumentationWarning`` instead of raising
    ``RuntimeError`` from the pytest plugin if modules in the
    target package have already been imported
  * Fixed ``TypeError`` when checking against ``TypedDict`` when
    the value has mixed types among the extra keys (PR by biolds)
  * Fixed incompatibility with ``typing_extensions`` v4.1+ on
    Python 3.10 (PR by David C.)
  * Fixed checking of ``Tuple[()]`` on Python 3.11 and
