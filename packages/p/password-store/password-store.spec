%description
With password-store, each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose
filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the password.
These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies,
copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard
command line file management utilities.
