- Update to 1.7.2
  * Large number of bug fixes

    CVE-2018-12356).

- Update password-store-gpg-2.1.patch to upstream version done
  by Andreas Stieger 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 10 11:00:39 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Version bump 1.7 
  * Features
    * Extensions: pass can now load user-defined extensions from a system
      directory or a user directory. There's already a nice ecosystem of
      extensions being built, even at this early stage. See the pass man page for
      more information.
    * Signatures: there is now an option to enforce signatures of the .gpg-id file
      and extensions using an environment variable.
    * QRCodes: generate and show have now learned the --qrcode/-q switch. Note to
      package maintainers: this adds a dependency on the popular qrencode package.
    * Password generation: rather than use pwgen, we now use /dev/urandom more
      directly, which results in more assured password security, as well as
      customizable character sets, via an environment variable. See the pass man
      page for more information on this customization. Package maintainers: you
      may now drop the dependency on pwgen.
    * Importers: there now are several more importers. More and more folks are
      moving to pass!
    * Selectable clipping: you can now specify which line you wish to copy to the
      clipboard or display with a qrcode when using -c or -q.
    * Git discovery: The PASSWORD_STORE_GIT environment variable has been removed,
      and instead pass will automatically choose the git repository closest to the
      file being modified (but not out of the actual password store itself). This
      should help people who like to nest git repos for different organizations.
  * Bug fixes: too many to count.
- New dependency qrencode
- Make pwgen a recommended tool
- Add patch password-store-gpg-2.1.patch to be able to handle new gpg behaviour
