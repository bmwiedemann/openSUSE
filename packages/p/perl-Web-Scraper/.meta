  <title>Web Scraping Toolkit using HTML and CSS Selectors or XPath expressions</title>
  <description>Web::Scraper is a web scraper toolkit, inspired by Ruby's equivalent Scrapi. It provides a DSL-ish interface for traversing HTML documents and returning a neatly arranged Perl data structure.

The _scraper_ and _process_ blocks provide a method to define what segments of a document to extract. It understands HTML and CSS Selectors as well as XPath expressions.</description>
