  <title>Doing phonetics by computer</title>
  <description>Praat is an open-software tool for the analysis of speech in phonetics.
Through its graphical interface, several speech analysis functionalities
are available: spectrograms, cochleograms, and pitch and formant extraction.
Articulatory synthesis, as well as synthesis from pitch, formant, and
intensity are also available. Other features are segmentation, labelling
using the phonetic alphabet, and computation of statistics.
Praat is configurable and extensible through its own scripting language and has
provisions for communicating with other programs.
