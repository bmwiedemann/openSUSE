    <comment>- update to 1.2.0:
  * This release modernizes the file layout, building, and
    packaging of `sysv_ipc`, including many improvements copied
    from its sister project `posix_ipc`. There are no changes to
    the core code other than the one behavior change noted below.
  * When attempting to set a Semaphore's value out of range (e.g.
    -1 or 99999), the module still raises a `ValueError`, but the
    associated message has changed. The previous message was
    &quot;Attribute 'value' must be between 0 and 32767
    (SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX)&quot;. The new message is &quot;The semaphore's
    value must remain between 0 and SEMVMX&quot;
  * &gt; The module constants `PAGE_SIZE` and `SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX`
    are deprecated as of this version. They will be removed in a
    future version. See
    https://github.com/osvenskan/sysv_ipc/issues/48 for
    background.
  * Renamed `prober.py` to `discover_system_info.py`, which now
    raises `DiscoveryError` if it encounters a situation it can't
    handle.
  * Improved `does_build_succeed()` and `compile_and_run()`,
    including some ideas suggested by Martin Jansa copied from
    https://github.com/osvenskan/posix_ipc/pull/77.
  * Added and expanded docstrings.
  * Changed to always write `SEMVMX` to `system_info.h`, and
    surround it with `#ifndef/#endif`.</comment>
