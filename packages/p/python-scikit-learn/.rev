    <comment>- update to version 0.19.1:
  * API changes
    + Reverted the addition of metrics.ndcg_score and
      metrics.dcg_score which had been merged into version 0.19.0 by
      error. The implementations were broken and undocumented.
    + return_train_score which was added to
      model_selection.GridSearchCV, model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV
      and model_selection.cross_validate in version 0.19.0 will be
      changing its default value from True to False in version
      0.21. We found that calculating training score could have a
      great effect on cross validation runtime in some cases. Users
      should explicitly set return_train_score to False if prediction
      or scoring functions are slow, resulting in a deleterious effect
      on CV runtime, or to True if they wish to use the calculated
      scores. #9677 by Kumar Ashutosh and Joel Nothman.
    + correlation_models and regression_models from the legacy
      gaussian processes implementation have been belatedly
      deprecated. #9717 by Kumar Ashutosh.
  * Bug fixes
    + Avoid integer overflows in metrics.matthews_corrcoef. #9693 by
      Sam Steingold.
    + Fix ValueError in preprocessing.LabelEncoder when using
      inverse_transform on unseen labels. #9816 by Charlie Newey.
    + Fixed a bug in the objective function for manifold.TSNE (both
      exact and with the Barnes-Hut approximation) when n_components
      &gt;= 3. #9711 by @goncalo-rodrigues.
    + Fix regression in model_selection.cross_val_predict where it
      raised an error with method='predict_proba' for some
      probabilistic classifiers. #9641 by James Bourbeau.
    + Fixed a bug where datasets.make_classification modified its
      input weights. #9865 by Sachin Kelkar.
    + model_selection.StratifiedShuffleSplit now works with
      multioutput multiclass or multilabel data with more than 1000
      columns. #9922 by Charlie Brummitt.
    + Fixed a bug with nested and conditional parameter setting,
      e.g. setting a pipeline step and its parameter at the same
      time. #9945 by Andreas Müller and Joel Nothman.
  * Regressions in 0.19.0 fixed in 0.19.1:
    + Fixed a bug where parallelised prediction in random forests was
      not thread-safe and could (rarely) result in arbitrary
      errors. #9830 by Joel Nothman.
    + Fix regression in model_selection.cross_val_predict where it no
      longer accepted X as a list. #9600 by Rasul Kerimov.
    + Fixed handling of model_selection.cross_val_predict for binary
      classification with method='decision_function'. #9593 by
      Reiichiro Nakano and core devs.
    + Fix regression in pipeline.Pipeline where it no longer accepted
      steps as a tuple. #9604 by Joris Van den Bossche.
    + Fix bug where n_iter was not properly deprecated, leaving n_iter
      unavailable for interim use in linear_model.SGDClassifier,
      linear_model.SGDRegressor,
      linear_model.PassiveAggressiveClassifier,
      linear_model.PassiveAggressiveRegressor and
      linear_model.Perceptron. #9558 by Andreas Müller.
    + Dataset fetchers make sure temporary files are closed before
      removing them, which caused errors on Windows. #9847 by Joan
      Massich.
    + Fixed a regression in manifold.TSNE where it no longer supported
      metrics other than ‘euclidean’ and ‘precomputed’. #9623 by Oli
      Blum.
  * Enhancements
    + Our test suite and utils.estimator_checks.check_estimators can
      now be run without Nose installed. #9697 by Joan Massich.
    + To improve usability of version 0.19’s pipeline.Pipeline
      caching, memory now allows joblib.Memory instances. This make
      use of the new utils.validation.check_memory helper. #9584 by
      Kumar Ashutosh
    + Some fixes to examples: #9750, #9788, #9815
    + Made a FutureWarning in SGD-based estimators less verbose. #9802
      by Vrishank Bhardwaj.
- update to version 0.19.0:
  * Highlights
    + We are excited to release a number of great new features
      including neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor for anomaly detection,
      preprocessing.QuantileTransformer for robust feature
      transformation, and the multioutput.ClassifierChain
      meta-estimator to simply account for dependencies between
      classes in multilabel problems. We have some new algorithms in
      existing estimators, such as multiplicative update in
      decomposition.NMF and multinomial
      linear_model.LogisticRegression with L1 loss (use
      solver='saga').
    + Cross validation is now able to return the results from multiple
      metric evaluations. The new model_selection.cross_validate can
      return many scores on the test data as well as training set
      performance and timings, and we have extended the scoring and
      refit parameters for grid/randomized search to handle multiple
      metrics.
    + You can also learn faster. For instance, the new option to cache
      transformations in pipeline.Pipeline makes grid search over
      pipelines including slow transformations much more
      efficient. And you can predict faster: if you’re sure you know
      what you’re doing, you can turn off validating that the input is
      finite using config_context.
    + We’ve made some important fixes too. We’ve fixed a longstanding
      implementation error in metrics.average_precision_score, so
      please be cautious with prior results reported from that
      function. A number of errors in the manifold.TSNE implementation
      have been fixed, particularly in the default Barnes-Hut
      approximation. semi_supervised.LabelSpreading and
      semi_supervised.LabelPropagation have had substantial
      fixes. LabelPropagation was previously broken. LabelSpreading
      should now correctly respect its alpha parameter.
  * Changed models
  * The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same
    data and parameters, may produce different models from the
    previous version. This often occurs due to changes in the
    modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in random sampling
    procedures.
    + cluster.KMeans with sparse X and initial centroids given (bug
      fix)
    + cross_decomposition.PLSRegression with scale=True (bug fix)
    + ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier and
      ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor where min_impurity_split is
      used (bug fix)
    + gradient boosting loss='quantile' (bug fix)
    + ensemble.IsolationForest (bug fix)
    + feature_selection.SelectFdr (bug fix)
    + linear_model.RANSACRegressor (bug fix)
    + linear_model.LassoLars (bug fix)
    + linear_model.LassoLarsIC (bug fix)
    + manifold.TSNE (bug fix)
    + neighbors.NearestCentroid (bug fix)
    + semi_supervised.LabelSpreading (bug fix)
    + semi_supervised.LabelPropagation (bug fix)
    + tree based models where min_weight_fraction_leaf is used
      (enhancement)

      `Machine Learning Cheat Sheet (for scikit-learn)
      &lt;http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.de/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html&gt;`_
      to the documentation. See :ref:`Choosing the right estimator &lt;ml_map&gt;`.
      By `Jaques Grobler`_.
    - :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` and
      :func:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` now support the use of advanced
      scoring function such as area under the ROC curve and f-beta scores.
      See :ref:`scoring_parameter` for details. By `Andreas Müller`_
      and `Lars Buitinck`_.
      Passing a function from :mod:`sklearn.metrics` as ``score_func`` is
      deprecated.
    - Multi-label classification output is now supported by
      :func:`metrics.accuracy_score`, :func:`metrics.zero_one_loss`,
      :func:`metrics.f1_score`, :func:`metrics.fbeta_score`,
      :func:`metrics.classification_report`,
      :func:`metrics.precision_score` and :func:`metrics.recall_score`
      by `Arnaud Joly`_.
    - Two new metrics :func:`metrics.hamming_loss` and

    - Speed and memory usage improvements in
      :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` and
      :class:`feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`,
      by Jochen Wersdörfer and Roman Sinayev.
    - The ``min_df`` parameter in
      :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` and
      :class:`feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`, which used to be 2,
      has been reset to 1 to avoid unpleasant surprises (empty vocabularies)
      for novice users who try it out on tiny document collections.
      A value of at least 2 is still recommended for practical use.
    - :class:`svm.LinearSVC`, :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` and
      :class:`linear_model.SGDRegressor` now have a ``sparsify`` method that
      converts their ``coef_`` into a sparse matrix, meaning stored models
      trained using these estimators can be made much more compact.
    - :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` now produces multiclass probability
      estimates when trained under log loss or modified Huber loss.
    - Hyperlinks to documentation in example code on the website by
      `Martin Luessi`_.

      Müller`_.
    - ``max_features`` in :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`,

      `Nelle Varoquaux`_.
    - :func:`metrics.accuracy_score` has an option normalize to return
      the fraction or the number of correctly classified sample
      by `Arnaud Joly`_.
    - Added :func:`metrics.log_loss` that computes log loss, aka cross-entropy
      loss. By Jochen Wersdörfer and `Lars Buitinck`_.
    - A bug that caused :class:`ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier`'s to output
      incorrect probabilities has been fixed.
    - Feature selectors now share a mixin providing consistent `transform`,
      `inverse_transform` and `get_support` methods. By `Joel Nothman`_.
    - A fitted :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` or
      :class:`grid_search.RandomizedSearchCV` can now generally be pickled.
      By `Joel Nothman`_.
    - Refactored and vectorized implementation of :func:`metrics.roc_curve`
      and :func:`metrics.precision_recall_curve`. By `Joel Nothman`_.
    - The new estimator :class:`sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD`
      performs dimensionality reduction using SVD on sparse matrices,
      and can be used for latent semantic analysis (LSA).
      By `Lars Buitinck`_.
    - Added self-contained example of out-of-core learning on text data
      :ref:`example_applications_plot_out_of_core_classification.py`.
      By `Eustache Diemert`_.
    - The default number of components for
      :class:`sklearn.decomposition.RandomizedPCA` is now correctly documented
      to be ``n_features``. This was the default behavior, so programs using it
      will continue to work as they did.
    - :class:`sklearn.cluster.KMeans` now fits several orders of magnitude
      faster on sparse data (the speedup depends on the sparsity). By
      `Lars Buitinck`_.
    - Reduce memory footprint of FastICA by `Denis Engemann`_ and
      `Alexandre Gramfort`_.
    - Verbose output in :mod:`sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting` now uses
      a column format and prints progress in decreasing frequency.
      It also shows the remaining time. By `Peter Prettenhofer`_.
    - :mod:`sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting` provides out-of-bag improvement
      :attr:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.oob_improvement_`
      rather than the OOB score for model selection. An example that shows
      how to use OOB estimates to select the number of trees was added.
      By `Peter Prettenhofer`_.
    - Most metrics now support string labels for multiclass classification
      by `Arnaud Joly`_ and `Lars Buitinck`_.
    - New OrthogonalMatchingPursuitCV class by `Alexandre Gramfort`_
      and `Vlad Niculae`_.
    - Fixed a bug in :class:`sklearn.covariance.GraphLassoCV`: the
      'alphas' parameter now works as expected when given a list of
      values. By Philippe Gervais.
    - Fixed an important bug in :class:`sklearn.covariance.GraphLassoCV`
      that prevented all folds provided by a CV object to be used (only
      the first 3 were used). When providing a CV object, execution
      time may thus increase significantly compared to the previous
      version (bug results are correct now). By Philippe Gervais.
    - :class:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` and the :mod:`grid_search`
      module is now tested with multi-output data by `Arnaud Joly`_.
    - :func:`datasets.make_multilabel_classification` can now return
      the output in label indicator multilabel format  by `Arnaud Joly`_.
    - K-nearest neighbors, :class:`neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor`
      and :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor`,
      and radius neighbors, :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor` and
      :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier` support multioutput data
      by `Arnaud Joly`_.
    - Random state in LibSVM-based estimators (:class:`svm.SVC`, :class:`NuSVC`,
      :class:`OneClassSVM`, :class:`svm.SVR`, :class:`svm.NuSVR`) can now be
      controlled.  This is useful to ensure consistency in the probability
      estimates for the classifiers trained with ``probability=True``. By
      `Vlad Niculae`_.
    - Out-of-core learning support for discrete naive Bayes classifiers
      :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB` and
      :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB` by adding the ``partial_fit``
      method by `Olivier Grisel`_.
    - New website design and navigation by `Gilles Louppe`_, `Nelle Varoquaux`_,
      Vincent Michel and `Andreas Müller`_.
    - Improved documentation on :ref:`multi-class, multi-label and multi-output
      classification &lt;multiclass&gt;` by `Yannick Schwartz`_ and `Arnaud Joly`_.
    - Better input and error handling in the :mod:`metrics` module by
      `Arnaud Joly`_ and `Joel Nothman`_.
    - Speed optimization of the :mod:`hmm` module by `Mikhail Korobov`_
    - Significant speed improvements for :class:`sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN`_
      by `cleverless &lt;https://github.com/cleverless&gt;`_
  * API changes:
    - The :func:`auc_score` was renamed :func:`roc_auc_score`.
    - Testing scikit-learn with `sklearn.test()` is deprecated. Use
      `nosetest sklearn` from the command line.
    - Feature importances in :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`,
      :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` and all derived ensemble estimators
      are now computed on the fly when accessing  the ``feature_importances_``
      attribute. Setting ``compute_importances=True`` is no longer required.
      By `Gilles Louppe`_.
    - :class:`linear_model.lasso_path` and
      :class:`linear_model.enet_path` can return its results in the same
      format as that of :class:`linear_model.lars_path`. This is done by
      setting the `return_models` parameter to `False`. By
      `Jaques Grobler`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_
    - :class:`grid_search.IterGrid` was renamed to
      :class:`grid_search.ParameterGrid`.
    - Fixed bug in :class:`KFold` causing imperfect class balance in some
      cases. By `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and Tadej Janež.
    - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` has been refactored, and a
      :class:`sklearn.neighbors.KDTree` has been
      added which shares the same interface.  The Ball Tree now works with
      a wide variety of distance metrics.  Both classes have many new
      methods, including single-tree and dual-tree queries, breadth-first
      and depth-first searching, and more advanced queries such as
      kernel density estimation and 2-point correlation functions.
      By `Jake Vanderplas`_
    - Support for scipy.spatial.cKDTree within neighbors queries has been
      removed, and the functionality replaced with the new :class:`KDTree`
      class.
    - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity` has been added, which performs
      efficient kernel density estimation with a variety of kernels.
    - :class:`sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA` now always returns output with
      ``n_components`` components, unless the new parameter ``remove_zero_eig``
      is set to ``True``. This new behavior is consistent with the way
      kernel PCA was always documented; previously, the removal of components
      with zero eigenvalues was tacitly performed on all data.
    - ``gcv_mode=&quot;auto&quot;`` no longer tries to perform SVD on a densified
      sparse matrix in :class:`sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV`.
    - Sparse matrix support in :class:`sklearn.decomposition.RandomizedPCA`
      is now deprecated in favor of the new ``TruncatedSVD``.
    - :class:`cross_validation.KFold` and
      :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedKFold` now enforce `n_folds &gt;= 2`
      otherwise a ``ValueError`` is raised. By `Olivier Grisel`_.
    - :func:`datasets.load_files`'s ``charset`` and ``charset_errors``
      parameters were renamed ``encoding`` and ``decode_errors``.
    - Attribute ``oob_score_`` in :class:`sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`
      and :class:`sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`
      is deprecated and has been replaced by ``oob_improvement_`` .
    - Attributes in OrthogonalMatchingPursuit have been deprecated
      (copy_X, Gram, ...) and precompute_gram renamed precompute
      for consistency. See #2224.
    - :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` now converts integer input
      to float, and raises a warning. Previously it rounded for dense integer
      input.
    - Better input validation, warning on unexpected shapes for y.
- Fix building on 13.1+
- Update BuildRequires
- Cleanup spec file formatting
- Require python-setuptools instead of distribute (upstreams merged)
- Update to version 0.13.1
- Update to version 0.12.1
- Clean up spec file
- Update to version 0.11
- remove unneeded libatals3-devel dependency
- fix python-Sphinx requirement
- first package
- version 0.5

    <comment>- Update to 1.0.2: 
  * Fixed an infinite loop in cluster.SpectralClustering by moving an iteration counter from try to except. #21271 by Tyler Martin.
  * datasets.fetch_openml is now thread safe. Data is first downloaded to a temporary subfolder and then renamed. #21833 by Siavash Rezazadeh.
  * Fixed the constraint on the objective function of decomposition.DictionaryLearning, decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning, decomposition.SparsePCA and decomposition.MiniBatchSparsePCA to be convex and match the referenced article. #19210 by Jérémie du Boisberranger.
  * ensemble.RandomForestClassifier, ensemble.RandomForestRegressor, ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier, ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor, and ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding now raise a ValueError when bootstrap=False and max_samples is not None. #21295 Haoyin Xu.
  * Solve a bug in ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier where the exponential loss was computing the positive gradient instead of the negative one. #22050 by Guillaume Lemaitre.
  * Fixed feature_selection.SelectFromModel by improving support for base estimators that do not set feature_names_in_. #21991 by Thomas Fan.
  * Fix a bug in linear_model.RidgeClassifierCV where the method predict was performing an argmax on the scores obtained from decision_function instead of returning the multilabel indicator matrix. #19869 by Guillaume Lemaitre.
  * linear_model.LassoLarsIC now correctly computes AIC and BIC. An error is now raised when n_features &gt; n_samples and when the noise variance is not provided. #21481 by Guillaume Lemaitre and Andrés Babino.
  * Fixed an unnecessary error when fitting manifold.Isomap with a precomputed dense distance matrix where the neighbors graph has multiple disconnected components. #21915 by Tom Dupre la Tour.
  * All sklearn.metrics.DistanceMetric subclasses now correctly support read-only buffer attributes. This fixes a regression introduced in 1.0.0 with respect to 0.24.2. #21694 by Julien Jerphanion.
  * neighbors.KDTree and neighbors.BallTree correctly supports read-only buffer attributes. #21845 by Thomas Fan.
  * Fixes compatibility bug with NumPy 1.22 in preprocessing.OneHotEncoder. #21517 by Thomas Fan.
  * Prevents tree.plot_tree from drawing out of the boundary of the figure. #21917 by Thomas Fan.
  * Support loading pickles of decision tree models when the pickle has been generated on a platform with a different bitness. A typical example is to train and pickle the model on 64 bit machine and load the model on a 32 bit machine for prediction. #21552 by Loïc Estève.
  * Non-fit methods in the following classes do not raise a UserWarning when fitted on DataFrames with valid feature names: covariance.EllipticEnvelope, ensemble.IsolationForest, ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier, neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier, neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor, neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier, neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor. #21199 by Thomas Fan.
  * Fixed calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV to take into account sample_weight when computing the base estimator prediction when ensemble=False. #20638 by Julien Bohné.
  * Fixed a bug in calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV with method=&quot;sigmoid&quot; that was ignoring the sample_weight when computing the the Bayesian priors. #21179 by Guillaume Lemaitre.
  * Compute y_std properly with multi-target in sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor allowing proper normalization in multi-target scene. #20761 by Patrick de C. T. R. Ferreira.
  * Fixed a bug in feature_extraction.CountVectorizer and feature_extraction.TfidfVectorizer by raising an error when ‘min_idf’ or ‘max_idf’ are floating-point numbers greater than 1. #20752 by Alek Lefebvre.
  * linear_model.LogisticRegression now raises a better error message when the solver does not support sparse matrices with int64 indices. #21093 by Tom Dupre la Tour.
  * neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier, neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor, neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier, neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor with metric=&quot;precomputed&quot; raises an error for bsr and dok sparse matrices in methods: fit, kneighbors and radius_neighbors, due to handling of explicit zeros in bsr and dok sparse graph formats. #21199 by Thomas Fan.
  * pipeline.Pipeline.get_feature_names_out correctly passes feature names out from one step of a pipeline to the next. #21351 by Thomas Fan.
  * svm.SVC and svm.SVR check for an inconsistency in its internal representation and raise an error instead of segfaulting. This fix also resolves CVE-2020-28975. #21336 by Thomas Fan.
  * manifold.TSNE now avoids numerical underflow issues during affinity matrix computation.
  * manifold.Isomap now connects disconnected components of the neighbors graph along some minimum distance pairs, instead of changing every infinite distances to zero.
  * Many others, see full changelog at https://scikit-learn.org/dev/whats_new/v1.0.html</comment>
