Sat Sep 24 10:54:29 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.10:
  * Updated the //README.md to be clear that parsing arbitrary JS
    code may not work.
  * Fixed serialization for objects that subclass `int` or `float`:
    Previously we would use the objects __str__ implementation, but
    that might result in an illegal JSON5 value if the object had
    customized __str__ to return something illegal. Instead,
    we follow the lead of the `JSON` module and call `int.__repr__`
    or `float.__repr__` directly.
  * While I was at it, I added tests for dumps(-inf) and dumps(nan)
    when those were supposed to be disallowed by `allow_nan=False`.

- update to 0.9.8:
  * Fixed error reporting in some cases due to how parsing was handling
    nested rules in the grammar - previously the reported location for
    the error could be far away from the point where it actually happened.
  * Fixed behavior of `default` fn in `dump` and `dumps`. Previously
    we didn't require the function to return a string, and so we could
    end up returning something that wasn't actually valid. This change
    now matches the behavior in the `json` module.
