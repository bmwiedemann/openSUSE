            1.32 (2015/11/15)
              (ms) [rt.cpan.org #108215] open() calls now use the safe form.

- updated to 1.31
         (ms) To better deal with the race condition in the 
              previous release, kill the newly created child 
              process first, then send a killpg to its process 
              group and ignore the outcome.

         (ms) [RT 81203] Jim A Kessler reported a perl 5.16 issue
              with the "AutoLoader" line, so I went ahead and removed
              all references to "Exporter" and "AutoLoader", as 
              Proc::Simple isn't using them at all.
