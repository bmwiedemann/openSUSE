  <title>Standalone, extensible Perl module installer</title>
  <description>*Module::Install* is a package for writing installers for CPAN (or
CPAN-like) distributions that are clean, simple, minimalist, act in a
strictly correct manner with the ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage, and will run
on any Perl installation version 5.005 or newer.

The intent is to make it as easy as possible for CPAN authors (and
especially for first-time CPAN authors) to have installers that follow all
the best practices for distribution installation, but involve as much DWIM
(Do What I Mean) as possible when writing them.</description>
