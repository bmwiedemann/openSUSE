%description
This class provides several methods for host name resolution. It is
designed to be used with event loops. All resolving are done by
getaddrinfo(3) implemented in your system library. Since getaddrinfo() is
blocking function and we don't want to block, calls to this function will
be done in separate thread. This class uses system native threads and not
perl threads. So overhead shouldn't be too big.
