- drop python 2, not supported anymore upstream
- update to version 4.0.0:
 - Drop support for Python 2, hence the version bump. Update list of PY3K versions to currently-supported versions. If you need to use textile on Python 2.7 or Python 3.3 or 3.4, please use textile Version 3.0.4.
 - For use in PyPy environments, textile used to work well with the regex package. Lately, it's running into trouble. Please uninstall regex if this is the case for you.
