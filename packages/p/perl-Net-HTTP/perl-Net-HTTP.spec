%description
The 'Net::HTTP' class is a low-level HTTP client. An instance of the
'Net::HTTP' class represents a connection to an HTTP server. The HTTP
protocol is described in RFC 2616. The 'Net::HTTP' class supports
'HTTP/1.0' and 'HTTP/1.1'.

'Net::HTTP' is a sub-class of one of 'IO::Socket::IP' (IPv6+IPv4),
'IO::Socket::INET6' (IPv6+IPv4), or 'IO::Socket::INET' (IPv4 only). You can
mix the methods described below with reading and writing from the socket
directly. This is not necessary a good idea, unless you know what you are
doing.
