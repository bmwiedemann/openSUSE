  <title>Low-level HTTP connection (client)</title>
  <description>The 'Net::HTTP' class is a low-level HTTP client. An instance of the
'Net::HTTP' class represents a connection to an HTTP server. The HTTP
protocol is described in RFC 2616. The 'Net::HTTP' class supports
'HTTP/1.0' and 'HTTP/1.1'.

'Net::HTTP' is a sub-class of 'IO::Socket::INET'. You can mix the methods
described below with reading and writing from the socket directly. This is
not necessary a good idea, unless you know what you are doing.</description>
