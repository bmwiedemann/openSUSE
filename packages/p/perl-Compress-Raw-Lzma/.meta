  <title>Low-Level Interface to lzma compression library</title>
  <description>'Compress::Raw::Lzma' provides an interface to the in-memory
compression/uncompression functions from the lzma compression library.

Although the primary purpose for the existence of 'Compress::Raw::Lzma' is
for use by the 'IO::Compress::Lzma', 'IO::Uncompress::UnLzma',
'IO::Compress::Xz' and 'IO::Uncompress::UnXz' modules, it can be used on
its own for simple compression/uncompression tasks.
