%description
'Compress::Raw::Lzma' provides an interface to the in-memory
compression/uncompression functions from the lzma compression library.

Although the primary purpose for the existence of 'Compress::Raw::Lzma' is
for use by the 'IO::Compress::Lzma', 'IO::Uncompress::UnLzma',
'IO::Compress::Xz' and 'IO::Uncompress::UnXz' modules, it can be used on
its own for simple compression/uncompression tasks.

There are two functions, called 'code' and 'flush', used in all the
compression and uncompression interfaces defined in this module. By default
both of these functions overwrites any data stored in its output buffer
parameter. If you want to compress/uncompress to a single buffer, and have
'code' and 'flush' append to that buffer, enable the 'AppendOutput' option
when you create the compression/decompression object.
