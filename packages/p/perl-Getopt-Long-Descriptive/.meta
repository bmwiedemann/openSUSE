  <title>Getopt::Long, but simpler and more powerful</title>
  <description>Getopt::Long::Descriptive is yet another Getopt library. It's built atop
Getopt::Long, and gets a lot of its features, but tries to avoid making you
think about its huge array of options.

It also provides usage (help) messages, data validation, and a few other
useful features.</description>
