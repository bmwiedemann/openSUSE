  1.67      2015-05-12 00:10:24Z
  
          [FIXED]
  
          - instead of erroring on duplicate keys found in a hash (introduced in
            version 1.63), now we only warn. This fixes an issue in Strawberry Perl
            (via CPAN::Meta::YAML) when parsing a configuration file.
  
          [CHANGED]
  
          - Updated File::Temp test prereq to 0.19 for 'newdir'

  1.59      2014-02-06 03:10:35Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
          [CHANGED]
  
          - numeric values are now quoted whenever they've been used as a string
            (fixes inconsistent behaviour seen with numeric values, due to
            differences between the XS and pure-perl variants of Data::Dumper).
            (github issue #24)
          - numeric hash keys are now always quoted.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

        - 1.57 omitted a change entry for the following change:

        - Previously, YAML::Tiny was sloppy about file encodings.  It is
          now strict.  The 'read' method and 'LoadFile' function expect
          UTF-8 encoded files.  The 'write' method and 'DumpFile' function
          produce UTF-8 encoded files.  The 'read_string' and
          'write_string' methods and the 'Load' and 'Dump' functions
          expect or generate (decoded) character data.

          - Previously, some errors would throw exceptions and some would
            return the error condition in $YAML::Tiny::errstr.  Now all
            errors throw exceptions.  Use of $errstr and the errstr method
            are deprecated. (David Golden)

        [FIXED]

          - Fixed write method to encode YAML file with UTF-8 (David Golden)
          - Improved SYNOPSIS and documentation of new (David Golden)

        [TESTING]

          - Tests have been cleaned up and reorganized.  Test coverage
            has been significnatly improved. (Ingy dÃ¶t Net, David Golden,
            Jim Keenan, Karen Etheridge)

           - re-release with fixed compile test
           - again packaging with ExtUtils::MakeMaker

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 23 13:00:00 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.51
   - The fix described in 1.48 was incorrect. Removing an additional
     if $@ to fix it properly.
   - Make the Scalar::Util version check resistant to bugs caused by
     development versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 18 13:20:44 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.com

- update to 1.50
    - Major bug fix, all code that writes arbitrary data should upgrade.
    - Simple scalars with no whitespace but ending in a colon like ABC: were
      not being quoted, which results in the parser confusing it with a
      mapping key and crashing.
  
    - No functional changes.
    - Don't depend on the YAML modules in RELEASE_TESTING, as it can
      pollute the advisory META.yml.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  4 08:30:23 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- updated to 1.48
    - Fix to the refaddr compatibility where Scalar::Util is installed
      but is older than 1.18.
    - No functional changes
    - Only depend on the YAML implementations when we are release testing
    - No functional changes
    - Moving to a production release now CPAN Testers is green again
    - Adding experimental support for exception->errstr conversion
    - Updating test suite yaml_error to not expect exceptions
    - Added support for trailing line comments (INGY)
    - Added checks for some characters that are illegal or reserved
      in plain scalars (INGY)
    - Minor cleaning up of some out of date POD (ADAMK)
    - Updated AUTOMATED_TESTING dependencies to new versions (ADAMK)
