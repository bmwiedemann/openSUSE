%description
Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM) continuously discovers
and maps your digital attack surface to provide an external view of your online infrastructure.

This visibility enables security and IT teams to identify unknowns, prioritize risk, eliminate
threats, and extend vulnerability and exposure control beyond the firewall. Defender EASM
leverages Microsoftâ€™s crawling technology to discover assets that are related to your known online
infrastructure, and actively scans these assets to discover new connections over time.

Attack Surface Insights are generated by leveraging vulnerability and infrastructure data to
showcase the key areas of concern for your organization.
