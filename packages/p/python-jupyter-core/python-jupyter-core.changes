- Update to 5.1.2
  * Add spell check and ensure docstrings #327 (@blink1073)
  * Maint: Some more precise typing. #326 (@Carreau)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 25 20:25:31 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 5.1.1
  * Only prefer envs owned by the current user #323 (@minrk)
  * Don't treat the conda root env as an env #324 (@minrk)
- Release 5.1.0
  * Add run_sync and ensure_async functions #315 (@davidbrochart)
- Release 5.0.0
  ## Major Changes
  * Prefer Environment Level Configuration. We now make the
    assumption that if we are running in a virtual environment, we
    * should prioritize the environment-level sys.prefix over the
    user-level paths. Users can opt out of this behavior by setting
    JUPYTER_PREFER_ENV_PATH, which takes precedence over our
    autodetection.
  * Migrate to Standard Platform Directories. In version 5, we
    introduce a JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS environment variable to opt
    in   * to using more appropriate platform-specific directories.
    We raise a deprecation warning if the variable is not set. In
    version 6, JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS will be opt-out. In version 7,
    we will remove the environment variable checks and old
    directory logic.
  * Drop Support for Python 3.7
  * We are dropping support for Python 3.7 ahead of its official
    end of life, to reduce   * maintenance burden as we add support
    for Python 3.11.
  * Use platformdirs for path locations #292 (@blink1073)
  * Try to detect if we are in a virtual environment and change
    path precedence   * accordingly #286 (@jasongrout)
  * Add current working directory as first config path #291
    (@blink1073)
  * Fix inclusion of jupyter file and check in CI #276 (@blink1073)
  * Bump github/codeql-action from 1 to 2 #308 (@dependabot)
  * Bump actions/checkout from 2 to 3 #307 (@dependabot)
  * Add dependabot #306 (@blink1073)
  * Adopt jupyter releaser #305 (@blink1073)
  * Add more typing #304 (@blink1073)
  * Require Python 3.8+ #302 (@blink1073)
  * Use hatch backend #265 (@blink1073)
  * Switch to flit build backend #262 (@blink1073)
  * is_hidden: Use normalized paths #271 (@martinRenou)

    @dharmaquark in #251 
- Drop argv0_subcommand.patch merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 12 21:09:24 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 4.9.1
  * Add Python site user base subdirectories to config and data
    user-level paths if site.ENABLE_USER_SITE is True. One way to
    disable these directory additions is to set the
    PYTHONNOUSERSITE environment variable. These locations can be
    customized by setting the PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable.
  * Add a workaround for virtualenv for getting the user site
    directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 12 08:25:01 UTC 2021 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@suse.de>

- Patch for solving gh#openSUSE/libalternatives#11:
  argv0_subcommand.patch
  This patch can be removed while releasing version >4.9.1.

    is not found (PR #218)
  * Return canonical path when using %APPDATA% on Windows (PR #222)
  * Print full usage on missing or invalid commands (PR #225)
  * Remove dependency on pywin32 package on PyPy (PR #230)
  * Update packages listed in jupyter --version (PR #232)
  * Inherit base aliases/flags from traitlets Application,
    including --show-config from traitlets 5 (PR #233)
  * Trigger warning when trying to check hidden file status on PyPy
    (PR #238)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  5 15:35:48 UTC 2021 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@suse.de>

- Use libalternatives instead of update-alternatives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  3 22:46:22 UTC 2021 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Require the jupyter-jupyter_core-filesystem so that depending
  packages have the sysconf and share files. (And the macros,
  but if they use it, they really should BuildRequire it
  explicitly)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 31 17:57:15 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 4.7.1
  * Allow creating user to delete secure file
- Changelog for 4.7.0
  * Add a new JUPYTER_PREFER_ENV_PATH variable, which can be set 
    to switch the order of the environment-level path and the 
    user-level path in the Jupyter path hierarchy (e.g., jupyter 
    --paths). It is considered set if it is a value that is not 
    one of 'no', 'n', 'off', 'false', '0', or '0.0' (case 
    insensitive). If you are running Jupyter in multiple virtual 
    environments as the same user, you will likely want to set 
    this environment variable.
  * Drop Python 2.x and 3.5 support, as they have reached end of 
    life.
  * jupyter --paths --debug now explains the environment 
    variables that affect the current path list.
  * Add conda environment information in jupyter troubleshoot.
  * Update _version.version_info and _version.__version__ to 
    follow Python conventions.
- merge jupyter package as capability into the primary python
  package
- fix replacement of paths:
  * fix noop introduced by overeager specfile-cleaner for system
    paths, adjust use_rpm_paths.patch
  * don't replace ENV_CONFIG_PATH or ENV_JUPYTER_PATH because that 
    would break virtual environments. See also
     gh#jupyter/jupyter_core#208

- Do not pull sybmol named package but real named package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 24 15:37:51 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.6.3
  * Changed windows secure_write path to skip all filesystem
    permission checks when running in insecure mode. Too many
    exception paths existed for mounted file systems to reliably
    try to set them before opting out with the insecure write
    pattern.
- Update to 4.6.2
  * Add ability to allow insecure writes with
    JUPYTER_ALLOW_INSECURE_WRITES environement variable.
  * Docs typo and build fixes
  * Added python 3.7 and 3.8 builds to testing
- Implement tests via multibuild
- Drop doc subpackage.  This was only around to resolve dependency
  cycles in testing, which the multibuild now does.  Keeping up
  with rapid changes in readthedocs was becoming difficult.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 12 15:54:48 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.6.1
  * Tolerate execute bit in owner permissions when validating secure writes
  * Fix project name typo in copyright
- Update to 4.6.0
  * Unicode characters existing in the user's home directory name are properly
    handled
  * ``mock`` is now only required for testing on Python 2
  * Deprecation warnings relative to ``_runtime_dir_changed`` are no longer
    produced
  * The ``scripts`` directory relative to the current python environment is
    now appended to the search directory for subcommands
  * Some utility functions (``exists()``, ``is_hidden()``, ``secure_write()``)
    have been moved from ``jupyter_client`` and ``jupyter_server`` to
    ``jupyter_core``
  * Fix error on Windows when setting private permissions
- Rename to python-jupyter-core to match upstream name change

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 16 14:46:15 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Fix self-obseletion

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 24 20:30:24 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 4.5.0
  * ``jupyter --version`` now tries to show the version number of various other
    installed Jupyter packages, not just ``jupyter_core``.
     This will hopefully make it clearer that there are various packages with
     their own version numbers.
  * Allow a :envvar:`JUPYTER_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to specify a
    search path of additional locations for config.
  * ``jupyter subcommand`` no longer modifies the :envvar:`PATH` environment
    variable when it runs ``jupyter-subcommand``.
  * Jupyter's 'runtime' directory no longer uses ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR``. While
    it has some attractive properties, it has led to various problems.
  * Fix ``JupyterApp`` to respect the ``raise_config_file_errors`` traitlet.
  * Various improvements to the bash completion scripts in this repository.
  * The ``setup.py`` script now always uses setuptools, like most other Jupyter
    projects.
  * The LICENSE file is included in wheels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 25 01:58:55 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

Wed Nov 22 22:48:47 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- require sphinxcontrib-github-alt

- update to version 4.4.0:
  * jupyter troubleshoot gets the list of packages from the Python
    environment it's in, by using sys.executable to call pip list
    (:ghpull:`104`).
  * Added utility function ensure_dir_exists, and switched to using it
    over the one from ipython_genutils, which does permissions wrong
    (:ghpull:`113`).
  * Avoid creating the ~/.ipython directory when checking if it exists
    for config migration (:ghpull:`118`).
  * Fix mistaken description in zsh completions (:ghpull:`98`).
  * Fix subcommand tests on Windows (:ghpull:`103`).
  * The README now describes how to work on jupyter_core and build the
    docs (:ghpull:`110`).
  * Fix a broken link to a release in the docs (:ghpull:`109`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 20 17:53:24 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Add version_specific_dirs.patch
  Uses python version-specific directories to avoid conflicts.
- Install the directories used for system-side settings and data so
  they are properly owned by this package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 30 19:05:42 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 4.3.0

- Update to 4.2.1
  * Fix error message on Windows when subcommand not found.
  * Correctly display PATH in ``jupyter troubleshoot`` on Windows.
- Update to 4.2.0
  * Make :command:`jupyter` directory top priority in search path
    for subcommands, so that :command:`jupyter-subcommand` next to
    :command:`jupyter` will always be picked if present.
  * Avoid using ``shell=True`` for subcommand dispatch on Windows.
- Update to 4.1.1
  * Include symlink directory and real location on subcommand PATH
    when :file:`jupyter` is a symlink.

    when dispatching subcommands.
  * Unicode fixes for Legacy Python.

- Simplify the tests for whether to build pdf documentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 08:53:35 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Split documentation to speed up building.
  This is a dependency of a lot of other packages, and the 
  dependencies for the documentation are very heavy.  So build
  the documentation separately to avoid holding up the build 
  process.
