  <title>Easily build XS extensions that depend on XS extensions</title>
  <description>This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means that a
perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides also a C and
an XS interface besides the perl one.

This works as long as the base extension is loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL
flag (usually done with a

	sub dl_load_flags {0x01}

in the main .pm file) if you need to use functions defined in the module.

The basic scheme of operation is to collect information about a module in
the instance, and then store that data in the Perl library where it may be
retrieved later. The object can also reformat this information into the
data structures required by ExtUtils::MakeMaker's WriteMakefile function.

When creating a new Depends object, you give it a name, which is the name
of the module you are building. You can also specify the names of modules
on which this module depends. These dependencies will be loaded
automatically, and their typemaps, header files, etc merged with your new
object's stuff. When you store the data for your object, the list of
dependencies are stored with it, so that another module depending on your
needn't know on exactly which modules yours depends.

For example:

  Gtk2 depends on Glib

  Gnome2::Canvas depends on Gtk2

  ExtUtils::Depends-&gt;new ('Gnome2::Canvas', 'Gtk2');
     this command automatically brings in all the stuff needed
     for Glib, since Gtk2 depends on it.</description>
