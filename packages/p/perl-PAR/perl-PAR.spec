%description
This module lets you use special zip files, called *P*erl *Ar*chives, as
libraries from which Perl modules can be loaded.

It supports loading XS modules by overriding *DynaLoader* bootstrapping
methods; it writes shared object file to a temporary file at the time it is
needed.

A _.par_ file is mostly a zip of the _blib/_ directory after the build
process of a CPAN distribution. To generate a _.par_ file yourself, all you
have to do is compress the modules under _arch/_ and _lib/_, e.g.:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % cd blib
    % zip -r mymodule.par arch/ lib/

Afterward, you can just use _mymodule.par_ anywhere in your '@INC', use
*PAR*, and it will Just Work. Support for generating _.par_ files is going
to be in the next (beyond 0.2805) release of Module::Build.

For convenience, you can set the 'PERL5OPT' environment variable to '-MPAR'
to enable 'PAR' processing globally (the overhead is small if not used);
setting it to '-MPAR=/path/to/mylib.par' will load a specific PAR file.
Alternatively, consider using the _par.pl_ utility bundled with the
PAR::Packer distribution, or using the self-contained _parl_ utility which
is also distributed with PAR::Packer on machines without PAR.pm installed.

Note that self-containing scripts and executables created with _par.pl_ and
_pp_ may also be used as _.par_ archives:

    % pp -o packed.exe source.pl        # generate packed.exe (see PAR::Packer)
    % perl -MPAR=packed.exe other.pl    # this also works
    % perl -MPAR -Ipacked.exe other.pl  # ditto

Please see SYNOPSIS for most typical use cases.
