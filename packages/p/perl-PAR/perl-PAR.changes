  - register XS DLLs extracted into $PAR_TEMP/inc with %PAR::Heavy::FullCache
    This solves the problems mentioned in GitHub PR #8
    ("Special case Gtk related dlls to dl_load from the unpacked inc dir")
    with applications using modules Gtk2, Pango, Cairo and others (this is
    a Windows only problem)
  - Heavy.pm: use strict; use warnings
    Thanks @shawnlaffan

    - Fix #129312: Code signing for OSX
      
      Avoid Archive::Zip::Archive error "can't find EOCD signature" for pp'ed
      executables with lots of stuff appended (e.g. by OSX codesign):
      temporarily increase Archive::Zip::ChunkSize around the call to
      Archive::Zip::readFromFileHandle().
      
      Note this is prerequisite for the corresponding fix in PAR::Packer.
  
    - Fix: Archive::Unzip::Burst::unzip result is ignored and _extract_inc
      does always the slow way, too

    - Fix #101800 "[PATCH] Reinstate files to inc dir if deleted by external process"
      Periodic temp  directory cleaning programs (eg. "tmpwatch") may remove some
      (older) files from $PAR_TEMP/inc, but keep others. This causes the packed
      program to fail.
  
      - When extracting a .par file to $PAR_TEMP/inc do NOT restore the original
        modified timestamps of the file (so that the extracted files have
        the time of extraction as their modified time).
  
      - Add a "canary" file in $PAR_TEMP and back-date it 1 day. Hence any process
        removing files in $PAR_TEMP based on timestamps should remove 
        the "canary" before others.
  
      - If the canary file is missing, extract the .par to $PAR_TEMP/inc 
        as previously was done only when $PAR_TEMP/inc was missing.
