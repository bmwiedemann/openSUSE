- Update to 2.0.1:
  - Drop Python 3.3 support.
  - Added a few more translations.
  - Lexer now processes unicode directly, to fix various issues with
    multibyte encodings. This also simplifies the implementation. Many
    thanks to davidweichiang for reporting and implementing.
  - New detailed description of the package for the readme, to clarify
    the behaviour and design choices. Many thanks to tschantzmc for
    contributing this description (see issue #70).
  - Minor fix in decoding of LaTeX comments (see issue #72).
  - Support Python 3.9 (see issue #75).
  - More symbols (THIN SPACE, various accented characters).
  - Fix lexer issue with multibyte encodings (thanks to davidweichiang
    for reporting).
  - More symbols (EM SPACE, MINUS SIGN, GREEK PHI SYMBOL, HYPHEN,
    alternate encodings of Swedish å and Å).
  - Doesn't need nose anymore (switched to pytest).
