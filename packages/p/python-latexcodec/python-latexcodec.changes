- Update to 2.0.1:
  - Drop Python 3.3 support.

    thanks to davidweichiang for reporting and implementing.

    the behaviour and design choices. Many thanks to tschantzmc for
    contributing this description (see issue #70).

  - Support Python 3.9 (see issue #75).
  - More symbols (THIN SPACE, various accented characters).
  - Fix lexer issue with multibyte encodings (thanks to davidweichiang
    for reporting).
