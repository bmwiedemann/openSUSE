- Remove support-coverage-62.patch
- Remove support-setuptools60.patch
- Update to 4.0.0:
  * --cov-fail-under no longer causes pytest --collect-only to fail Contributed
    by Zac Hatfield-Dodds in #511.
  * Dropped support for multiprocessing (mostly because issue 82408). This
    feature was mostly working but very broken in certain scenarios and made
    the test suite very flaky and slow.
  * There is builtin multiprocessing support in coverage and you can migrate to
    that. All you need is this in your .coveragerc:

       [run]
       concurrency = multiprocessing
       parallel = true
       sigterm = true

  * Fixed deprecation in setup.py by trying to import setuptools before
    distutils. Contributed by Ben Greiner in #545.
  * Removed undesirable new lines that were displayed while reporting was
    disabled. Contributed by Delgan in #540.
  * Documentation fixes. Contributed by Andre Brisco in #543 and Colin O'Dell
    in #525.
  * Added support for LCOV output format via --cov-report=lcov. Only works with
    coverage 6.3+. Contributed by Christian Fetzer in #536.
  * Modernized pytest hook implementation. Contributed by Bruno Oliveira in
    #549 and Ronny Pfannschmidt in #550.

  * Added a "disarm" option: --no-cov. It will disable coverage
    measurements. Contributed by Zoltan Kozma in PR#135.
    WARNING: Do not put this in your configuration files, it's meant
    to be an one-off for situations where you want to disable coverage
    from command line.
  * Fixed broken exception handling on .pth file. See #136.
- Converted to single-spec
- Switched source URL to pypi.io

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 22 13:53:36 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.2.0
  * Added support for changing working directory in tests.
    Previously changing working directory would disable coverage
    measurements in suprocesses.
  * Fixed broken handling for --cov-report=annotate.
- Update to version 2.1.0
  * Added support for coverage 4.0b2.
  * Added the --cov-append command line options. 
    Contributed by Christian Ledermann in PR#80.
- Update to version 2.0.0
  * Added --cov-fail-under, akin to the new fail_under option in
    coverage-4.0 (automatically activated if there’s a 
    [report] fail_under = ... in .coveragerc).
  * Changed --cov-report=term to automatically upgrade to 
    --cov-report=term-missing if there’s 
    [run] show_missing = True in .coveragerc.
  * Changed --cov so it can be used with no path argument 
    (in wich case the source settings from .coveragerc will 
    be used instead).
  * Fixed .pth installation to work in all cases 
    (install, easy_install, wheels, develop etc).
  * Fixed .pth uninstallation to work for wheel installs.
  * Support for coverage 4.0.
  * Data file suffixing changed to use coverage’s 
    data_suffix=True option (instead of the custom suffixing).
  * Avoid warning about missing coverage data 
    (just like coverage.control.process_startup).
  * Fixed a race condition when running with xdist 
    (all the workers tried to combine the files). 
    It’s possible that this issue is not present in 
    pytest-cov 1.8.X.
