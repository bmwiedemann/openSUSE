  <title>A working require &quot;Class::Name&quot; and more</title>
  <description>&quot;require EXPR&quot; only accepts &quot;Class/Name.pm&quot; style module names, not
&quot;Class::Name&quot;. How frustrating! For that, we provide &quot;load_class
'Class::Name'&quot;.
It's often useful to test whether a module can be loaded, instead of
throwing an error when it's not available. For that, we provide
&quot;try_load_class 'Class::Name'&quot;.
Finally, sometimes we need to know whether a particular class has been
loaded. Asking %%INC is an option, but that will miss inner packages and
any class for which the filename does not correspond to the package name.
For that, we provide &quot;is_class_loaded 'Class::Name'&quot;.</description>
