%description
Multi-key dict provides also extended interface for iterating over items and
keys (e.g. by the key type), which might be useful when creating, e.g.
dictionaries with index-name key pair allowing to iterate over items using
either: names or indexes.
It can be useful for many many other similar use-cases, and there is no limit
to the number of keys used to map to the value.
