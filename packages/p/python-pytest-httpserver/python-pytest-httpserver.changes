Mon Sep 29 20:16:44 UTC 2025 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.3:
  * Run server threads with daemon flag, preventing shutdown
    issues. #411
  * Python versions earlier than 3.9 have been deprecated in
    order to make the code more type safe. Python 3.8 has reached
    EOL on 2024-10-07.
  * Add a new expect method to the HTTPServer object which allows
    developers to provide their own request matcher object.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 18 17:18:13 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.0:
  * Fixed an issue related to the leak of httpserver state
    between the tests when httpserver is destructed before the
    other fixtures. #352
  * Fix pytest-httpserver's own tests related to log querying. No
    functional changes in pytest-httpserver code itself. #345
  * New methods added to query for matching requests in the log.
  * Threading support to serve requests in parallel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 10:19:34 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.0.10:
  * When there's no handler for the request, add more details to
    the response sent by the server about the request to help
    debugging.
  * Use ruff for linting. It includes some source code changes
    which should not introduce functional changes, or API
    changes.
  * Add __repr__ to RequestHandler object so when it is compared
    (eg. with the log attribute of the server) it will show the
    matcher parameters.

- update to 1.0.8:
  * Bug Fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 22 21:17:53 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.0.7:
  * With werkzeug 2.3.x the headers type has been updated to not
    allow integers as header values. This restriction followed up
    in pytest-httpserver.
  * Python versions earlier than 3.8 have been deprecated in
    order to support the latest werkzeug.
  * Type hinting for header_value_matcher has been fixed. From
    now, specifying a callable as ``Callable[[str,
    Optional[str], str], bool]`` will be accepted also.
    Providing a ``HeaderValueMatcher`` object will be also
    accepted as before, as it provides the same callable signature
  * Fix Werkzeug deprecation warning about
    ``parse_authorization_header`` call.
  * Replace ``parse_authorization_header`` with
    ``Authorization.from_header`` as suggested. This fix should
    not introduce any functional change for the users.
  * Fix Werkzeug deprecation warning about
    ``werkzeug.urls.url_decode`` call. This call has been changed
    to ``urllib.parse.parse_qsl`` in the implementation.
    This fix should not introduce any functional change for the
    users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 22:25:29 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.0.6:
  * Add a new way of running tests with the blocking mode. In
    this mode, the http server is synchronized to the main thread
    and the client code is run in a separate thread.
  * Python version classifier updated in pyproject.toml (which
    updates pypi also)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 15 15:50:47 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.0.5
  * Packaging of sdist and the wheel fixed by adding the extra
    files only to the sdist and not to the wheel.
- Release 1.0.4
  * Fixed type hinting of HeaderValueMatcher.DEFAULT_MATCHERS,
    which did not allow modifications, however it is explicitly
    allowed in the documentation.
  * Version of flake8 library updated to require 4.0.0+ at minimum.
    This is required to make flake8 working on recent python
    versions.
- Release 1.0.3
  * Additional type hints improvements to make the library more
    mypy compliant. Imports in __init__.py have been updated to
    indicate that this is a namespace package.
  * Package deployment and CI has been migrated to poetry.
    poetry.lock will be kept up to date. Make target "quick-test"
    renamed to "test". Also, minor adjustments were made regarding
    documentation generation. Make targets should be identical.
    Build results like sdist, and wheel are almost identical to the
    one which was made by setuptools.
