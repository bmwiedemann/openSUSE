  <title>Essential utilities for the Iterator class</title>
  <description>This module implements many useful functions for creating and manipulating
iterator objects.

An &quot;iterator&quot; is an object, represented as a code block that generates the
&quot;next value&quot; of a sequence, and generally implemented as a closure. For
further information, including a tutorial on using iterator objects, see
the the Iterator manpage documentation.</description>
