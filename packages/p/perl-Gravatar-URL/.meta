  <title>Make URLs for Gravatars from an email address</title>
  <description>A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar for a given email address. This
allows you to have a global picture associated with your email address. You
can look up the Gravatar for any email address by constructing a URL to get
the image from the gravatar.com manpage. This module does that.

Examples of use include the author faces on the http://search.cpan.org
manpage.

See the http://gravatar.com manpage for more info.</description>
