- specfile:
  * be more specific in %files section

- update to version 1.9.0:
  * Add an option to include the functions source code when generating
    the cache key. PR `#156
    <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/pull/156>`_.
  * Add an feature that allows one to completely control the way how
    cache keys are generating. For example, one can now implement a
    function that generates cache the keys based on the POST-based
    requests.  PR `#159
    <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/pull/159>`_.
  * Fix the cache backend naming collisions by renaming them from
    "simple" to "simplecache", "null" to "nullcache" and "filesystem"
    to "filesystemcache".
  * Explicitly pass the "default_timeout" to "RedisCache" from
    "RedisSentinelCache".
  * Use "os.replace" instead of werkzeug's "rename" due to Windows
    raising an "OSError" if the dst file already exist.
  * Documentation updates and fixes.
