  <title>Faster and more correct implementation of the Package::Stash API</title>
  <description>This is a backend for the Package::Stash manpage, which provides the
functionality in a way that's less buggy and much faster. It will be used
by default if it's installed, and should be preferred in all environments
with a compiler.</description>
