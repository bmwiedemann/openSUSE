- Remove python3-base from Requires for %{name}-tcltk; it is
  unneeded in light of python(abi) getting pulled in
  automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 17:19:40 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Replace even more python2 Requires with python3 ones; this

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 08:38:48 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Swap leftover python2 Requires for explicitly python3 ones,

  tests).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 16 10:17:09 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Drop unused cmake variables.
- Rename devel pkgs to follow their corresponding shared library
  nomenclature.
- Split out wxPLViewer into its own subpackage, which is now
  called %{name}-wxwidgets (the shared lib which was using this

- Rename plplot-fortran to libplplotf95-%{sover} as it now
  contains a single shared lib.
- Apply shared library packaging guidelines wherever appropriate;
  remove corresponding %{name}-rpmlintrc snippet. Shared lib
  naming not applied to %{name}-tcltk-libs as all the SO in this
  package are always required together and have their SO numbers
  bumped in lock-step with each other.
- Rename %{name}-tcltk to %{name}-tcltk-libs.
- Except for the most basic drivers, package individual drivers in
  their own subpackages. Users need to individually install
  drivers they need, only mem and null drivers will be installed
  by default [with any of the devel pkgs, for example].
- Split out a %{name}-common package with the most basic drivers
  and common example files included; require it from all driver
  subpackage, and -devel packages.
