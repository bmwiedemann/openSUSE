- Re-enable libcsirocsa and libscironn for i586: these are now
  building (go figure!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  5 12:13:36 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Disable octave bindings until compilation against octave 4.4 is
  sorted out; remove conditionals for setting octave_enabled as
  plplot is unresolvable against openSUSE < 1320 anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  8 03:24:17 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- plplot-devel should not depend on shared libs which are not
  built: %{csirocsa_shlib} and %{csironn_shlib} on certain archs. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  7 08:13:10 UTC 2018 - guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org

- Handle aarch64, ppc64 and ppc64le, not only x86_64 for libs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 26 12:49:52 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

  for the latter arch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 16 12:24:17 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Remove python3-base from Requires for %{name}-tcltk; it is
  unneeded in light of python(abi) getting pulled in
  automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 17:19:40 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Replace even more python2 Requires with python3 ones; this
  finally fixes build failures on openSUSE:Leap:15.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 08:38:48 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Swap leftover python2 Requires for explicitly python3 ones,
  rename python package to python3-plplot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 10:08:56 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Switch to using explicit python3 BuildRequires (plplot is
  "unresolvable" for openSUSE <= 1320 anyway); adapt file lists
  accordingly.
- Drop conditionals referring to old openSUSE versions <= 1320.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 08:26:44 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  pkgconfig(pygtk-2.0) are not in use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 29 08:20:50 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

  everything else is licensed as LGPL-2.1+, the Octave bindings
  are licensed as GPL-2.0+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 11 22:51:26 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Drop BuildRequires on libgnomui and libgnomeprintui, as they are
  not really required any more (boo#1067727).
- Change hashbangs for python based examples so that they refer
  directly to the python binary instead of doing so via env.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  4 07:40:37 UTC 2017 - fstrba@suse.com

- Remove the stale gcc-java dependency, since gcc-java is bound to
  go soon and it is really not needed for building here

  corresponding shared object naming changes.
- Use ctest for the check section. This allows the disabling of
  tests that either fail because of issues with the test codes
  themselves (octave), or because of lack of a full Xserver (Qt
  tests).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 16 10:17:09 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Add LDFLAGS=-fPIC to fix the ada compiler test to link successfully

- Trim descriptions for size, fix wrong summaries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 17:06:28 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Switch to building with Qt5 instead of Qt4.
- Add BuildRequires on qhull, this generates a new shared lib
  now packaged as %{csironn_shlib}.
- Drop unused cmake variables.
- Rename devel pkgs to follow their corresponding shared library
  nomenclature.
- Split out wxPLViewer into its own subpackage, which is now
  called %{name}-wxwidgets (the shared lib which was using this
  name previously has been renamed in keeping with shlib policy).
- Drop %{name}-rpmlintrc file, as it is no longer needed.
- Since version 5.12.0 plplot's fortran bindings depend on
  gcc-fortran >= 6.0.

    version for CMake-3.7.1.

    against a planned future C API breakage.
  * Introduction of additional self-describing names for the types
    of arguments used in our C API.
  * Implement submission of dashboards to the <my.cdash.org> cdash
    server.
  * Substantial update and rename of the Python examples.
  * Linux efficiency improvements for the wxwidgets device driver.

- Fix timestamp on previous changelog entry.
- Back to installing plplot.pc by default instead of plplot-c.pc.
- Rename plplot-fortran to libplplotf95-%{sover} as it now
  contains a single shared lib.
- Apply shared library packaging guidelines wherever appropriate;
  remove corresponding %{name}-rpmlintrc snippet. Shared lib
  naming not applied to %{name}-tcltk-libs as all the SO in this
  package are always required together and have their SO numbers
  bumped in lock-step with each other.
- Rename %{name}-tcltk to %{name}-tcltk-libs.
- Except for the most basic drivers, package individual drivers in
  their own subpackages. Users need to individually install
  drivers they need, only mem and null drivers will be installed
  by default [with any of the devel pkgs, for example].
- Split out a %{name}-common package with the most basic drivers
  and common example files included; require it from all driver
  subpackage, and -devel packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 31 21:09:00 UTC 2016 - bwiedemann@suse.com

  failures caused by octave's upgrade to version 4.2.0 in Factory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 14 23:54:09 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Enable tk bindings for all openSUSE versions; problem with
  Xvfb segfaulting that prevent building tk bindings for Leap:42.2
  and > 13.2 are worked around by passing the -noreset option to
  Xvfb (see boo#992429).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
