%description
This module defines a mini language to parse, validate, simplify, normalize and
compare license expressions using a boolean logic engine.

This supports SPDX license expressions and also accepts other license naming
conventions and license identifiers aliases to resolve and normalize licenses.

Using boolean logic, license expressions can be tested for equality,
containment, equivalence and can be normalized or simplified.
