      prune overly-aggressively-set prereqs; we do not require CPANPLUS!

          make www.cpan.org the default remote!

          link to the list of mirrors, too (thanks, SYSMON!)

          pass all options from command line, not just known ones (thanks,
          Jeffrey Thalhammer, who waited a very very long time for me to apply
          this!)

          add --remote-from option to get remote from CPAN or CPANPLUS config
          (thanks, Jeff Bisbee, who also waited a long time)

          expand leading "~" in config file name (suggested by justincase)

          die if local target isn't writable (suggested by SARGIE)

          when testing, mock my_home harder (thanks, David Golden!)

          check that the received 02packages seems at least remotely plausible

          fix the old ->trace method, broken in 1.111004

          config options that once had to be specified as multiple entries
          on one line may now be given as repeated entries; these are
          also_mirror, module_filters, and path_filters

        don't fail tests when the outside env has set CPAN_MINI_CONFIG
         (thanks, Stephen Thirwall!)

      run the test minicpan in offline mode to avoid tester errors

      set the default log_level much earlier, to avoid an undef warning

      no code changes, this release is just intended to be indexed

      overhaul logging: there is now a log_level

      delay creation of scratch dir until needed

      a bunch of tests added for switch and config processing

      add tools for building a fake cpan and an xt test for testing online

      test for online-ness by HEAD-ing 02packages, not the remote root
