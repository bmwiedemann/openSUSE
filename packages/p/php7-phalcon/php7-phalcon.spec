%description
Phalcon is an open source, full stack framework for PHP 5
written as a C-extension, optimized for high performance.
You don't need learn or use the C language, since the functionality
is exposed as PHP classes ready for you to use. Zephir is a high level
language, something between C and PHP. Itâ€™s both dynamic and static
typed and it supports just the features we need to create and maintain
a project like Phalcon.
