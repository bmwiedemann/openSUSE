  ## Fixed:
  * Fix version command when the version is dynamic and build
    dependencies are unmet
- Release 1.6.2 - 2022-10-20

- Release 1.6.0 - 2022-10-08
  ## Changed:

    arbitrary subprocess.Popen keyword arguments. This is not
    strictly breaking, but will be utilized in upcoming features.
  * The internal directory structure for storing virtual

    local environments will be created anew.
  ## Added:
  * Add project command group to view details about the project
    like PEP 621 metadata
  * Better support for auto-detection of environments by tools like
    Visual Studio Code now that the storage directory of virtual

    environment directory resides somewhere within the project root
    or if it is set to a .virtualenvs directory within the user's
    home directory
  * Build environments for the virtual environment type are now
    cached for improved performance
  * Add build_environment_exists method to the environment
    interface for implementations that cache the build environment

  * Support Bash on Windows for the shell command
  * The setuptools migration script no longer modifies the
    formatting of existing pyproject.toml configuration
  * Bump the minimum supported version of Hatchling to 1.11.0
  ## Fixed:
  * Environments now respect dynamically defined project
    dependencies
  * The dep hash and all dep show commands now respect dynamically
    defined project dependencies
  * The env show, dep hash, and all dep show commands now honor
    context formatting
  * Fix matrix variable inclusion filtering of the run and env run
    commands when there are multiple possible variables
  * Build environment compatibility is now checked before use
  * Decreasing verbosity now has no affect on output that should
    always be displayed
  * Handle more edge cases in the setuptools migration script
  * Environments now respect user defined environment variables for
    context formatting
  * Update the scripts in the generated test environment template
    for new projects to reflect the documentation
  * Allow extra-dependencies in environment overrides
  * Depend on packaging explicitly rather than relying on it being
    a transitive dependency of Hatchling
- Release 1.5.0 - 2022-08-28
  ## Added:
  * The index publisher now recognizes repository-specific options
  * Add the --ignore-compat flag to the env run command

    force the use of the Python executable Hatch is running on for
    virtual environment creation
  ## Fixed:
  * Fix the --force-continue flag of the env run command
  * Handle more edge cases in the setuptools migration script
- Release 1.4.2 - 2022-08-16

    before using the one Hatch is running on

    expression matching
  * The index publisher now better supports non-PyPI indices
  * Add certificate options to the index publisher
  * Display waiting text when checking dependencies and removing
    environments
  * Display help text the first time the shell command is executed
  * Update project templates with Python 3.11 and the latest
    versions of various GitHub Actions
  * Add support for Almquist (ash) shells
  * Add hyperlink as a dependency for better handling of package
    index URLs
  * Bump the minimum supported version of virtualenv to 20.16.2
  * Bump the minimum supported version of tomlkit to 0.11.1
  ## Fixed:
  * Acknowledge extra-dependencies for the env show command

  * Bump the minimum supported version of Hatchling to 1.4.1

  * Escape special characters Git may return in the user name when
    writing generated files for new projects
  * Normalize the package name to lowercase in setuptools migration
    script
  * Fix parsing of source distributions during publishing

  * In order to simplify the implementation of command execution
    for environment plugins, the run_shell_commands method has been
    replaced by the singular run_shell_command. A new
    command_context method has been added to more easily satisfy
    complex use cases.
  * The finalize_command environment plugin method has been removed
    in favor of the newly introduced context formatting
    functionality.
  ## Added:
  * Add context formatting functionality i.e. the ability to insert
    values into configuration like environment variables and
    command line arguments
  * Any verbosity for command execution will now always display
    headers, even for single environments
  * Every executed command is now displayed when running multiple
    commands or when verbosity is enabled
  * Similar to make, ignore the exit code of executed commands that
    start with - (a hyphen)
  * Add ability for the --init flag of the new command to
    automatically migrate setuptools configuration
  * Update project metadata to reflect the adoption by PyPA and
    production stability
- Release 1.0.0 - 2022-04-28
  * This is the first stable release of Hatch v1, a complete
    rewrite. Enjoy!
