  ## Fixed:
  * Fix version command when the version is dynamic and build
    dependencies are unmet

  ## Fixed:
  * Fix getting dynamic metadata from hooks for environments when
    dependencies are not dynamic

- Release 1.6.0 - 2022-10-08
  ## Changed:
  * The run_shell_command environment interface method now accepts
    arbitrary subprocess.Popen keyword arguments. This is not
    strictly breaking, but will be utilized in upcoming features.

    environments is now more nested. This is not breaking, but any
    local environments will be created anew.
  ## Added:
  * Add project command group to view details about the project
    like PEP 621 metadata
  * Better support for auto-detection of environments by tools like
    Visual Studio Code now that the storage directory of virtual
    environments will be flat if Hatch's configured virtual
    environment directory resides somewhere within the project root
    or if it is set to a .virtualenvs directory within the user's
    home directory
  * Build environments for the virtual environment type are now
    cached for improved performance
  * Add build_environment_exists method to the environment
    interface for implementations that cache the build environment

    the saving of authentication information before publishing
  * Support Bash on Windows for the shell command
  * The setuptools migration script no longer modifies the
    formatting of existing pyproject.toml configuration
  * Bump the minimum supported version of Hatchling to 1.11.0
  ## Fixed:
  * Environments now respect dynamically defined project
    dependencies
  * The dep hash and all dep show commands now respect dynamically
    defined project dependencies
  * The env show, dep hash, and all dep show commands now honor
    context formatting
  * Fix matrix variable inclusion filtering of the run and env run
    commands when there are multiple possible variables
  * Build environment compatibility is now checked before use
  * Decreasing verbosity now has no affect on output that should
    always be displayed
  * Handle more edge cases in the setuptools migration script
  * Environments now respect user defined environment variables for
    context formatting
  * Update the scripts in the generated test environment template
    for new projects to reflect the documentation
  * Allow extra-dependencies in environment overrides
  * Depend on packaging explicitly rather than relying on it being
    a transitive dependency of Hatchling
- Release 1.5.0 - 2022-08-28
  ## Added:
  * The index publisher now recognizes repository-specific options
  * Add the --ignore-compat flag to the env run command

    force the use of the Python executable Hatch is running on for
    virtual environment creation
  ## Fixed:
  * Fix the --force-continue flag of the env run command
  * Handle more edge cases in the setuptools migration script
- Release 1.4.2 - 2022-08-16
  ## Fixed:
  * Fix check for updating static versions with the version command
    when metadata hooks are in use
- Release 1.4.1 - 2022-08-13
  ## Fixed:
  * Fix non-detached inheritance disabling for environments

  ## Added:
  * The default Python for virtual environments now checks PATH
    before using the one Hatch is running on
  * Values for environment env-vars now support context formatting
  * Add name override for environments to allow for regular
    expression matching
  * The index publisher now better supports non-PyPI indices
  * Add certificate options to the index publisher
  * Display waiting text when checking dependencies and removing
    environments
  * Display help text the first time the shell command is executed
  * Update project templates with Python 3.11 and the latest
    versions of various GitHub Actions
  * Add support for Almquist (ash) shells
  * Add hyperlink as a dependency for better handling of package
    index URLs
  * Bump the minimum supported version of virtualenv to 20.16.2
  * Bump the minimum supported version of tomlkit to 0.11.1
  ## Fixed:
  * Acknowledge extra-dependencies for the env show command
  * Fix locating executables within virtual environments on Debian
  * Fix managing the terminal size inside the shell command
  * Fix default code coverage file omission for the src-layout
    project template option
- Release 1.3.1 - 2022-07-11
  ## Fixed:
  * Support -h/--help flag for the run command

    now works with entire named scripts
  * Add a way to require confirmation for publishing
  * Add --force-continue flag to the env run command
  * Make tracebacks colorful and less verbose
  * When shell configuration has not been defined, attempt to use
    the current shell based on parent processes before resorting to
    the defaults
  * The shell name pwsh is now an alias for powershell
  * Remove atomicwrites dependency
  * Relax constraint on userpath dependency
  * Bump the minimum supported version of Hatchling to 1.4.1
  ## Fixed:
  * Keep environments in sync with the dependencies of the selected
    features
  * Use utf-8 for all files generated for new projects
  * Escape special characters Git may return in the user name when
    writing generated files for new projects
  * Normalize the package name to lowercase in setuptools migration
    script
  * Fix parsing of source distributions during publishing
- Release 1.2.1 - 2022-05-30
  ## Fixed:
  * Fix handling of top level data_files in setuptools migration
    script
- Release 1.2.0 - 2022-05-22

    additional args parameter

- Release 1.1.0 - 2022-05-12
  ## Changed:
  * In order to simplify the implementation of command execution
    for environment plugins, the run_shell_commands method has been
    replaced by the singular run_shell_command. A new
    command_context method has been added to more easily satisfy
    complex use cases.
  * The finalize_command environment plugin method has been removed
    in favor of the newly introduced context formatting
    functionality.
  ## Added:
  * Add context formatting functionality i.e. the ability to insert
    values into configuration like environment variables and
    command line arguments
  * Any verbosity for command execution will now always display
    headers, even for single environments
  * Every executed command is now displayed when running multiple
    commands or when verbosity is enabled
  * Similar to make, ignore the exit code of executed commands that
    start with - (a hyphen)
  * Add ability for the --init flag of the new command to
    automatically migrate setuptools configuration
  * Update project metadata to reflect the adoption by PyPA and
    production stability
- Release 1.0.0 - 2022-04-28
  * This is the first stable release of Hatch v1, a complete
    rewrite. Enjoy!

- Add hatch-pr659-utf8.patch for compatibility with new hatchling
  (gh#pypa/hatch#659).
