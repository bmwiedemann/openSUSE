%description
The python-socks package provides a core proxy client functionality for Python.
Supports SOCKS4(a), SOCKS5, HTTP (tunneling) proxy and provides sync and async
(asyncio, trio, curio) APIs. You probably don't need to use python-socks
directly. It is used internally by aiohttp-socks and httpx-socks packages.
