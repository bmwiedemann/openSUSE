-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 20 12:36:02 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.0.1:
- Split out utilities into new package called PyCBC-utils, which
  requires the default py3 flavour.
- Build the python module itself for all supported python
  flavours; disable python2 which is no longer supported by PyCBC
  or its dependencies.
- Run tests using pytest; note that using the pytest_arch macro
  leads to errors, so we largely replicate its behaviour except
  for running pytest itself without any options passed to it.
- Re-check which tests work and rm those which do not to avoid
  module import errors.
- New BuildRequires: python-pyFFTW.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 17 12:33:08 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 26 21:12:02 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.18.0:
  * update dependencies (require lalsuite, no longer require
    emcee).
  * build wheels and update build infrastructure.
- Drop usage of python singlespec macros and switch to supporting
  just the default python3 environment. The large number of
  binaries installed to _bindir and the lack of a reasonable way
  to use python_clone for all the binaries forces this change.
- Promote lal* to Requires and drop BuildRequires/Recommends on
  python-emcee in keeping with upstream changes.
- Drop additional source utils.py: not needed any more.
- Enable tests after deleting broken test cases.
- Add BuildRequires/Requires on lalpulsar, python-ligo-lw,
  python-lscsoft-glue: new upstream dependencies.
- Switch source tarball to GitHub since PyPI tarball does not
  carry the helper scripts and data files for test suite.

    only marginal increase in the resulting file size
    (gh#gwastro/pycbc#3428).
