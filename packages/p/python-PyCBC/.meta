  <title>Core library to analyze gravitational-wave data</title>
  <description>PyCBC is a software package used to explore astrophysical sources of
gravitational waves. It contains algorithms to analyze
gravitational-wave data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors, detect
coalescing compact binaries, and measure the astrophysical parameters
of detected sources.
