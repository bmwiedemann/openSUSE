  <title>Generate SQL from Perl data structures</title>
  <description>This module was inspired by the excellent DBIx::Abstract. However, in using that module I found that what I really wanted to do was generate SQL, but still retain complete control over my statement handles and use the DBI interface. So, I set out to create an abstract SQL generation module.</description>
