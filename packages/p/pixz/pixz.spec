%description
The existing XZ Utils provide great compression in the .xz file format, but
they produce just one big block of compressed data. Pixz instead produces a
collection of smaller blocks which makes random access to the original data
possible. This is especially useful for large tarballs.

Pixz supports automatic indexing and parallel compression and decompression
using all available CPU cores.
