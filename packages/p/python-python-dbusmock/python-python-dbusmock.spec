%description
With this program/Python library, one can create mock objects on D-Bus.
This is useful for writing tests for software which talks to D-Bus services
such as upower, systemd, logind, gnome-session or others, and it is hard
(or impossible without root privileges) to set the state of the real services
to what one may expect in tests.
