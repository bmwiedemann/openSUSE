- update to version 2.4.5:
  * Fixed encoding when setup.py reads README.rst to include the
    project long description when uploading to PyPI. A stray unicode
    space in README.rst prevented the source install on systems whose
    default encoding is not 'utf-8'.

    buffering in unit tests, thanks for the prompt heads-up, Ned
    Batchelder!

- changes from version 2.4.3:
  * Fixed a bug in ParserElement.__eq__ that would for some parsers
    create a recursion error at parser definition time. Thanks to
    Michael Clerx for the assist. (Addresses issue #123)
  * Fixed bug in indentedBlock where a block that ended at the end of
    the input string could cause pyaprsing to loop forever. Raised as
    part of discussion on StackOverflow with geckos.
  * Backports from pyparsing 3.0.0:
    + __diag__.enable_all_warnings()
    + Fixed bug in PrecededBy which caused infinite recursion, issue

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  6 05:01:32 UTC 2019 - Thomas Bechtold <tbechtold@suse.com>

- update to 2.4.2:
  - Updated the shorthand notation that has been added for repetition
    expressions: expr[min, max], with '...' valid as a min or max value
  - The defaults on all the `__diag__` switches have been set to False,
    to avoid getting alarming warnings. To use these diagnostics, set
    them to True after importing pyparsing.
  - Fixed bug introduced by the use of __getitem__ for repetition,
    overlooking Python's legacy implementation of iteration
    by sequentially calling __getitem__ with increasing numbers until
    getting an IndexError. Found during investigation of problem
    reported by murlock, merci!
  - Changed [...] to emit ZeroOrMore instead of OneOrMore.
  - Removed code that treats ParserElements like iterables.
  - Change all __diag__ switches to False.
- update to 2.4.1.1:
  - API change adding support for `expr[...]` - the original
    code in 2.4.1 incorrectly implemented this as OneOrMore.
    Code using this feature under this relase should explicitly
    use `expr[0, ...]` for ZeroOrMore and `expr[1, ...]` for
    OneOrMore. In 2.4.2 you will be able to write `expr[...]`
    equivalent to `ZeroOrMore(expr)`.
  - Bug if composing And, Or, MatchFirst, or Each expressions
    using an expression. This only affects code which uses
    explicit expression construction using the And, Or, etc.
    classes instead of using overloaded operators '+', '^', and
    so on. If constructing an And using a single expression,
    you may get an error that "cannot multiply ParserElement by
    0 or (0, 0)" or a Python `IndexError`.
  - Some newly-added `__diag__` switches are enabled by default,
    which may give rise to noisy user warnings for existing parsers.
- update to 2.4.1:
  - A new shorthand notation has been added for repetition
    expressions: expr[min, max], with '...' valid as a min
  - '...' can also be used as short hand for SkipTo when used
    in adding parse expressions to compose an And expression.
  - '...' can also be used as a "skip forward in case of error" expression
  - Improved exception messages to show what was actually found, not
    just what was expected.
  - Added diagnostic switches to help detect and warn about common
    parser construction mistakes, or enable additional parse
    debugging. Switches are attached to the pyparsing.__diag__
    namespace object
  - Added ParseResults.from_dict classmethod, to simplify creation
    of a ParseResults with results names using a dict, which may be nested.
    This makes it easy to add a sub-level of named items to the parsed
    tokens in a parse action.
  - Added asKeyword argument (default=False) to oneOf, to force
    keyword-style matching on the generated expressions.
  - ParserElement.runTests now accepts an optional 'file' argument to
    redirect test output to a file-like object (such as a StringIO,
    or opened file). Default is to write to sys.stdout.
  - conditionAsParseAction is a helper method for constructing a
    parse action method from a predicate function that simply
    returns a boolean result. Useful for those places where a
    predicate cannot be added using addCondition, but must be
    converted to a parse action (such as in infixNotation). May be
    used as a decorator if default message and exception types
    can be used. See ParserElement.addCondition for more details
    about the expected signature and behavior for predicate condition
    methods.
  - While investigating issue #93, I found that Or and
    addCondition could interact to select an alternative that
    is not the longest match. This is because Or first checks
    all alternatives for matches without running attached
    parse actions or conditions, orders by longest match, and
    then rechecks for matches with conditions and parse actions.
    Some expressions, when checking with conditions, may end
    up matching on a shorter token list than originally matched,
    but would be selected because of its original priority.
    This matching code has been expanded to do more extensive
    searching for matches when a second-pass check matches a
    smaller list than in the first pass.
  - Fixed issue #87, a regression in indented block.
    Reported by Renz Bagaporo, who submitted a very nice repro
    example, which makes the bug-fixing process a lot easier,
    thanks!
  - Fixed MemoryError issue #85 and #91 with str generation for
    Forwards. Thanks decalage2 and Harmon758 for your patience.
  - Modified setParseAction to accept None as an argument,
    indicating that all previously-defined parse actions for the
    expression should be cleared.
  - Modified pyparsing_common.real and sci_real to parse reals
    without leading integer digits before the decimal point,
    consistent with Python real number formats. Original PR #98
    submitted by ansobolev.
  - Modified runTests to call postParse function before dumping out
    the parsed results - allows for postParse to add further results,
    such as indications of additional validation success/failure.
  - Updated statemachine example: refactored state transitions to use
    overridden classmethods; added <statename>Mixin class to simplify
    definition of application classes that "own" the state object and
    delegate to it to model state-specific properties and behavior.
  - Added example nested_markup.py, showing a simple wiki markup with
    nested markup directives, and illustrating the use of '...' for
    skipping over input to match the next expression. (This example
    uses syntax that is not valid under Python 2.)
  - Rewrote delta_time.py example (renamed from deltaTime.py) to
    fix some omitted formats and upgrade to latest pyparsing idioms,
    beginning with writing an actual BNF.
  - With the help and encouragement from several contributors, including
    Matěj Cepl and Cengiz Kaygusuz, I've started cleaning up the internal
    coding styles in core pyparsing, bringing it up to modern coding
    practices from pyparsing's early development days dating back to
    2003. Whitespace has been largely standardized along PEP8 guidelines,
    removing extra spaces around parentheses, and adding them around
    arithmetic operators and after colons and commas. I was going to hold
    off on doing this work until after 2.4.1, but after cleaning up a
    few trial classes, the difference was so significant that I continued
    on to the rest of the core code base. This should facilitate future
    work and submitted PRs, allowing them to focus on substantive code
    changes, and not get sidetracked by whitespace issues.

- update to 2.4.0
- drop nose_to_unittest.patch
- drop _service
 * Adds a pyparsing.__compat__ object for specifying compatibility with
   future breaking changes.
 * Conditionalizes the API-breaking behavior, based on the value
   pyparsing.__compat__.collect_all_And_tokens.  By default, this value
   will be set to True, reflecting the new bugfixed behavior.
 * User code that is dependent on the pre-bugfix behavior can restore
   it by setting this value to False.
 * Updated unitTests.py and simple_unit_tests.py to be compatible with
   "python setup.py test".
 * Fixed bug in runTests handling '\n' literals in quoted strings.
 * Added tag_body attribute to the start tag expressions generated by
   makeHTMLTags, so that you can avoid using SkipTo to roll your own
   tag body expression:
 * indentedBlock failure handling was improved
 * Address Py2 incompatibility in simpleUnitTests, plus explain() and
   Forward str() cleanup
 * Fixed docstring with embedded '\w', which creates SyntaxWarnings in Py3.8.
 * Added example parser for rosettacode.org tutorial compiler.
 * Added example to show how an HTML table can be parsed into a
   collection of Python lists or dicts, one per row.
 * Updated SimpleSQL.py example to handle nested selects, reworked
   'where' expression to use infixNotation.
 * Added include_preprocessor.py, similar to macroExpander.py.
 * Examples using makeHTMLTags use new tag_body expression when
   retrieving a tag's body text.
 * Updated examples that are runnable as unit tests

- update to 2.2.0:
  - Bumped minor version number to reflect compatibility issues with
    OneOrMore and ZeroOrMore bugfixes in 2.1.10. (2.1.10 fixed a bug
    that was introduced in 2.1.4, but the fix could break code
    written against 2.1.4 - 2.1.9.)
  - Updated setup.py to address recursive import problems now
    that pyparsing is part of 'packaging' (used by setuptools).
    Patch submitted by Joshua Root, much thanks!
  - Fixed KeyError issue reported by Yann Bizeul when using packrat
    parsing in the Graphite time series database, thanks Yann!
  - Fixed incorrect usages of '\' in literals, as described in
    https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#deprecated-python-behavior
    Patch submitted by Ville Skyttä - thanks!
  - Minor internal change when using '-' operator, to be compatible
    with ParserElement.streamline() method.
  - Expanded infixNotation to accept a list or tuple of parse actions
    to attach to an operation.
  - New unit test added for dill support for storing pyparsing parsers.
    Ordinary Python pickle can be used to pickle pyparsing parsers as
    long as they do not use any parse actions. The 'dill' module is an

- update to version 2.1.10:
  * Fixed bug in reporting named parse results for ZeroOrMore
    expressions, thanks Ethan Nash for reporting this!
  * Fixed behavior of LineStart to be much more predictable.
    LineStart can now be used to detect if the next parse position is
    col 1, factoring in potential leading whitespace (which would
    cause LineStart to fail). Also fixed a bug in col, which is used
    in LineStart, where '\n's were erroneously considered to be column
    1.
  * Added support for multiline test strings in runTests.
  * Fixed bug in ParseResults.dump when keys were not strings.  Also
    changed display of string values to show them in quotes, to help
    distinguish parsed numeric strings from parsed integers that have
    been converted to Python ints.
- update to version 2.1.9:
  * Added class CloseMatch, a variation on Literal which matches
    "close" matches, that is, strings with at most 'n' mismatching
    characters.
  * Fixed bug in Keyword.setDefaultKeywordChars(), reported by
    Kobayashi Shinji - nice catch, thanks!
  * Minor API change in pyparsing_common. Renamed some of the common
    expressions to PEP8 format (to be consistent with the other
    pyparsing_common expressions):
    + signedInteger -> signed_integer
    + sciReal -> sci_real
    Also, in trying to stem the API bloat of pyparsing, I've copied
    some of the global expressions and helper parse actions into
    pyparsing_common, with the originals to be deprecated and removed
    in a future release:
    + commaSeparatedList -> pyparsing_common.comma_separated_list
    + upcaseTokens -> pyparsing_common.upcaseTokens
    + downcaseTokens -> pyparsing_common.downcaseTokens
  * Fixed Python3 compatibility bug when using dict keys() and
    values() in ParseResults.getName().
  * After some prodding, I've reworked the unitTests.py file for
    pyparsing over the past few releases. It uses some variations on
    unittest to handle my testing style. The test now:
    + auto-discovers its test classes (while maintining their order
      of definition)
    + suppresses voluminous 'print' output for tests that pass
- update to version 2.1.8:
  * Fixed issue in the optimization to _trim_arity, when the full
    stacktrace is retrieved to determine if a TypeError is raised in
    pyparsing or in the caller's parse action. Code was traversing the
    full stacktrace, and potentially encountering UnicodeDecodeError.
  * Fixed bug in ParserElement.inlineLiteralsUsing, causing infinite
    loop with Suppress.
  * Fixed bug in Each, when merging named results from multiple
    expressions in a ZeroOrMore or OneOrMore. Also fixed bug when
    ZeroOrMore expressions were erroneously treated as required
    expressions in an Each expression.
  * Added a few more inline doc examples.
  * Improved use of runTests in several example scripts.
- changes from version 2.1.7:
  * Fixed regression reported by Andrea Censi (surfaced in PyContracts
    tests) when using ParseSyntaxExceptions (raised when using
    operator '-') with packrat parsing.
  * Minor fix to oneOf, to accept all iterables, not just
    space-delimited strings and lists. (If you have a list or set of
    strings, it is not necessary to concat them using ' '.join to pass
    them to oneOf, oneOf will accept the list or set or generator
    directly.)
- changes from version 2.1.6 :
  * *Major packrat upgrade*, inspired by patch provided by Tal Einat -
    many, many, thanks to Tal for working on this! Tal's tests show
    faster parsing performance (2X in some tests), *and* memory
    reduction from 3GB down to ~100MB! Requires no changes to
    existing code using packratting. (Uses OrderedDict, available in
    Python 2.7 and later.  For Python 2.6 users, will attempt to
    import from ordereddict backport. If not present, will implement
    pure-Python Fifo dict.)
  * Minor API change - to better distinguish between the flexible
    numeric types defined in pyparsing_common, I've changed "numeric"
    (which parsed numbers of different types and returned int for
    ints, float for floats, etc.) and "number" (which parsed numbers
    of int or float type, and returned all floats) to "number" and
    "fnumber" respectively. I hope the "f" prefix of "fnumber" will be
    a better indicator of its internal conversion of parsed values to
    floats, while the generic "number" is similar to the flexible
    number syntax in other languages. Also fixed a bug in
    pyparsing_common.numeric (now renamed to pyparsing_common.number),
    integers were parsed and returned as floats instead of being
    retained as ints.
  * Fixed bug in upcaseTokens and downcaseTokens introduced in 2.1.5,
    when the parse action was used in conjunction with results names.
    Reported by Steven Arcangeli from the dql project, thanks for your
    patience, Steven!
  * Major change to docs! After seeing some comments on reddit about
    general issue with docs of Python modules, and thinking that I'm a
    little overdue in doing some doc tuneup on pyparsing, I decided to
    following the suggestions of the redditor and add more inline
    examples to the pyparsing reference documentation. I hope this
    addition will clarify some of the more common questions people
    have, especially when first starting with pyparsing/Python.
  * Deprecated ParseResults.asXML. I've never been too happy with this
    method, and it usually forces some unnatural code in the parsers
    in order to get decent tag names. The amount of guesswork that
    asXML has to do to try to match names with values should have been
    a red flag from day one. If you are using asXML, you will need to
    implement your own ParseResults->XML serialization. Or consider
    migrating to a more current format such as JSON (which is very
    easy to do: results_as_json = json.dumps(parse_result.asDict())
    Hopefully, when I remove this code in a future version, I'll also
    be able to simplify some of the craziness in ParseResults, which
    IIRC was only there to try to make asXML work.
  * Updated traceParseAction parse action decorator to show the repr
    of the input and output tokens, instead of the str format, since
    str has been simplified to just show the token list content.
- update to version 2.1.5:
  * Added ParserElement.split() generator method, similar to
    re.split().  Includes optional arguments maxsplit (to limit the
    number of splits), and includeSeparators (to include the
    separating matched text in the returned output, default=False).
  * Added a new parse action construction helper tokenMap, which will
    apply a function and optional arguments to each element in a
    ParseResults.
  * Added more expressions to pyparsing_common:
    + IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (including long, short, and mixed
      forms of IPv6)
    + MAC address
    + ISO8601 date and date time strings (with named fields for
      year, month, etc.)
    + UUID (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
    + hex integer (returned as int)
    + fraction (integer '/' integer, returned as float)
    + mixed integer (integer '-' fraction, or just fraction,
      returned as float)
    + stripHTMLTags (parse action to remove tags from HTML source)
    + parse action helpers convertToDate and convertToDatetime to do
      custom parse time conversions of parsed ISO8601 strings
  * runTests now returns a two-tuple: success if all tests succeed,
    and an output list of each test and its output lines.
  * Added failureTests argument (default=False) to runTests, so that
    tests can be run that are expected failures, and runTests' success
    value will return True only if all tests *fail* as expected. Also,
    parseAll now defaults to True.
  * New example numerics.py, shows samples of parsing integer and real
    numbers using locale-dependent formats
- changes from version 2.1.4:
  * Split out the '==' behavior in ParserElement, now implemented as
    the ParserElement.matches() method. Using '==' for string test
    purposes will be removed in a future release.
  * Expanded capabilities of runTests(). Will now accept embedded
    comments (default is Python style, leading '#' character, but
    customizable). Comments will be emitted along with the tests and
    test output. Useful during test development, to create a test
    string consisting only of test case description comments separated
    by blank lines, and then fill in the test cases. Will also
    highlight ParseFatalExceptions with "(FATAL)".
  * Added a 'pyparsing_common' class containing common/helpful little
    expressions such as integer, float, identifier, etc. I used this
    class as a sort of embedded namespace, to contain these helpers
    without further adding to pyparsing's namespace bloat.
  * Minor enhancement to traceParseAction decorator, to retain the
    parse action's name for the trace output.
  * Added optional 'fatal' keyword arg to addCondition, to indicate
    that a condition failure should halt parsing immediately.
- changes from version 2.1.3:
  * _trim_arity fix in 2.1.2 was very version-dependent on Py 3.5.0.
    Now works for Python 2.x, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5.0, and 3.5.1 (and
    hopefully beyond).
- changes from version 2.1.2:
  * Fixed bug in _trim_arity when pyparsing code is included in a
    PyInstaller, reported by maluwa.
  * Fixed catastrophic regex backtracking in implementation of the
    quoted string expressions (dblQuotedString, sglQuotedString, and
    quotedString). Reported on the pyparsing wiki by webpentest, good
    catch! (Also tuned up some other expressions susceptible to the
    same backtracking problem, such as cStyleComment, cppStyleComment,
    etc.)
- update to version 2.1.1:
  * Added support for assigning to ParseResults using slices.
  * Fixed bug in ParseResults.toDict(), in which dict values were
    always converted to dicts, even if they were just unkeyed lists of
    tokens.  Reported on SO by Gerald Thibault, thanks Gerald!
  * Fixed bug in SkipTo when using failOn, reported by robyschek,
    thanks!
  * Fixed bug in Each introduced in 2.1.0, reported by AND patch and
    unit test submitted by robyschek, well done!
  * Removed use of functools.partial in replaceWith, as this creates
    an ambiguous signature for the generated parse action, which fails
    in PyPy. Reported by Evan Hubinger, thanks Evan!
  * Added default behavior to QuotedString to convert embedded '\t',
    '\n', etc. characters to their whitespace counterparts. Found
    during Q&A exchange on SO with Maxim.
- update to version 2.1.0:
  * Modified the internal _trim_arity method to distinguish between
    TypeError's raised while trying to determine parse action arity
    and those raised within the parse action itself. This will clear
    up those confusing "<lambda>() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)"
    error messages when there is an actual TypeError in the body of
    the parse action. Thanks to all who have raised this issue in the
    past, and most recently to Michael Cohen, who sent in a proposed
    patch, and got me to finally tackle this problem.
  * Added compatibility for pickle protocols 2-4 when pickling
    ParseResults.  In Python 2.x, protocol 0 was the default, and
    protocol 2 did not work.  In Python 3.x, protocol 3 is the
    default, so explicitly naming protocol 0 or 1 was required to
    pickle ParseResults. With this release, all protocols 0-4 are
    supported. Thanks for reporting this on StackOverflow, Arne
    Wolframm, and for providing a nice simple test case!
  * Added optional 'stopOn' argument to ZeroOrMore and OneOrMore, to
    simplify breaking on stop tokens that would match the repetition
    expression.
    It is a common problem to fail to look ahead when matching
    repetitive tokens if the sentinel at the end also matches the
    repetition expression, as when parsing "BEGIN aaa bbb ccc END"
    with:

    "BEGIN" + OneOrMore(Word(alphas)) + "END"

    Since "END" matches the repetition expression "Word(alphas)", it
    will never get parsed as the terminating sentinel. Up until now,
    this has to be resolved by the user inserting their own negative
    lookahead:

    "BEGIN" + OneOrMore(~Literal("END") + Word(alphas)) + "END"

    Using stopOn, they can more easily write:

    "BEGIN" + OneOrMore(Word(alphas), stopOn="END") + "END"

    The stopOn argument can be a literal string or a pyparsing
    expression.  Inspired by a question by Lamakaha on StackOverflow
    (and many previous questions with the same negative-lookahead
    resolution).
  * Added expression names for many internal and builtin expressions,
    to reduce name and error message overhead during parsing.
  * Converted helper lambdas to functions to refactor and add
    docstring support.
  * Fixed ParseResults.asDict() to correctly convert nested
    ParseResults values to dicts.
  * Cleaned up some examples, fixed typo in fourFn.py identified by
    aristotle2600 on reddit.
  * Removed keepOriginalText helper method, which was deprecated ages
    ago. Superceded by originalTextFor.
  * Same for the Upcase class, which was long ago deprecated and
    replaced with the upcaseTokens method.

- update to version 2.0.7:
  * Simplified string representation of Forward class, to avoid memory
    and performance errors while building ParseException
    messages. Thanks, Will McGugan, Andrea Censi, and Martijn Vermaat
    for the bug reports and test code.
  * Cleaned up additional issues from enhancing the error messages for
    Or and MatchFirst, handling Unicode values in expressions. Fixes
    Unicode encoding issues in Python 2, thanks to Evan Hubinger for
    the bug report.
  * Fixed implementation of dir() for ParseResults - was leaving out
    all the defined methods and just adding the custom results names.
  * Fixed bug in ignore() that was introduced in pyparsing 1.5.3, that
    would not accept a string literal as the ignore expression.
  * Added new example parseTabularData.py to illustrate parsing of
    data formatted in columns, with detection of empty cells.
  * Updated a number of examples to more current Python and pyparsing
    forms.
- update to version 2.0.6:
  * Fixed a bug in Each when multiple Optional elements are present.
    Thanks for reporting this, whereswalden on SO.
  * Fixed another bug in Each, when Optional elements have results
    names or parse actions, reported by Max Rothman - thank you, Max!
  * Added optional parseAll argument to runTests, whether tests should
    require the entire input string to be parsed or not (similar to
    parseAll argument to parseString). Plus a little neaten-up of the
    output on Python 2 (no stray ()'s).
  * Modified exception messages from MatchFirst and Or
    expressions. These were formerly misleading as they would only
    give the first or longest exception mismatch error message. Now
    the error message includes all the alternatives that were possible
    matches. Originally proposed by a pyparsing user, but I've lost
    the email thread - finally figured out a fairly clean way to do
    this.
  * Fixed a bug in Or, when a parse action on an alternative raises an
    exception, other potentially matching alternatives were not always
    tried.  Reported by TheVeryOmni on the pyparsing wiki, thanks!
  * Fixed a bug to dump() introduced in 2.0.4, where list values were
    shown in duplicate.
- update to version 2.0.5:
  * (&$(@#&$(@!!!!  Some "print" statements snuck into pyparsing
    v2.0.4, breaking Python 3 compatibility! Fixed. Reported by
    jenshn, thanks!
- changes from Version 2.0.4:
  * Added ParserElement.addCondition, to simplify adding parse actions
    that act primarily as filters. If the given condition evaluates
    False, pyparsing will raise a ParseException. The condition should
    be a method with the same method signature as a parse action, but
    should return a boolean. Suggested by Victor Porton, nice idea
    Victor, thanks!
  * Slight mod to srange to accept unicode literals for the input
    string, such as "[а-яА-Я]" instead of
    "[\u0430-\u044f\u0410-\u042f]". Thanks to Alexandr Suchkov for the
    patch!
  * Enhanced implementation of replaceWith.
  * Fixed enhanced ParseResults.dump() method when the results
    consists only of an unnamed array of sub-structure
    results. Reported by Robin Siebler, thanks for your patience and
    persistence, Robin!
  * Fixed bug in fourFn.py example code, where pi and e were defined
    using CaselessLiteral instead of CaselessKeyword. This was not a
    problem until adding a new function 'exp', and the leading 'e' of
    'exp' was accidentally parsed as the mathematical constant
    'e'. Nice catch, Tom Grydeland - thanks!
  * Adopt new-fangled Python features, like decorators and ternary
    expressions, per suggestions from Williamzjc - thanks William! (Oh
    yeah, I'm not supporting Python 2.3 with this code any more...)
    Plus, some additional code fixes/cleanup - thanks again!
  * Added ParserElement.runTests, a little test bench for quickly
    running an expression against a list of sample input
    strings. Basically, I got tired of writing the same test code over
    and over, and finally added it as a test point method on
    ParserElement.
  * Added withClass helper method, a simplified version of
    withAttribute for the common but annoying case when defining a
    filter on a div's class - made difficult because 'class' is a
    Python reserved word.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 11 17:40:24 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 2.0.3:
  * Fixed escaping behavior in QuotedString. Formerly, only
    quotation marks (or characters designated as quotation marks in
    the QuotedString constructor) would be escaped. Now all escaped
    characters will be escaped, and the escaping backslashes will
    be removed.
  * Fixed regression in ParseResults.pop() - pop() was pretty much
    broken after I added *improvements* in 2.0.2. Reported by Iain
    Shelvington, thanks Iain!
  * Fixed bug in And class when initializing using a generator.
  * Enhanced ParseResults.dump() method to list out nested
    ParseResults that are unnamed arrays of sub-structures.
  * Fixed UnboundLocalError under Python 3.4 in oneOf method,
    reported on Sourceforge by aldanor, thanks!
  * Fixed bug in ParseResults __init__ method, when returning
    non-ParseResults types from parse actions that implement
    __eq__. Raised during discussion on the pyparsing wiki with
    cyrfer.
- fix end of line encoding of every file in examples

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 11 17:34:18 UTC 2014 - Greg.Freemyer@gmail.com

- update to v2.0.2
	- Extended "expr(name)" shortcut (same as "expr.setResultsName(name)")
	  to accept "expr()" as a shortcut for "expr.copy()".

	- Added "locatedExpr(expr)" helper, to decorate any returned tokens
	  with their location within the input string. Adds the results names
	  locn_start and locn_end to the output parse results.

	- Added "pprint()" method to ParseResults, to simplify troubleshooting
	  and prettified output. Now instead of importing the pprint module
	  and then writing "pprint.pprint(result)", you can just write
	  "result.pprint()".  This method also accepts addtional positional and
	  keyword arguments (such as indent, width, etc.), which get passed 
	  through directly to the pprint method 
	  (see http://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html#pprint.pprint).

	- Removed deprecation warnings when using '<<' for Forward expression
	  assignment. '<<=' is still preferred, but '<<' will be retained
	  for cases whre '<<=' operator is not suitable (such as in defining
	  lambda expressions).

	- Expanded argument compatibility for classes and functions that
	  take list arguments, to now accept generators as well.

	- Extended list-like behavior of ParseResults, adding support for
	  append and extend. NOTE: if you have existing applications using
	  these names as results names, you will have to access them using
	  dict-style syntax: res["append"] and res["extend"]

	- ParseResults emulates the change in list vs. iterator semantics for
	  methods like keys(), values(), and items(). Under Python 2.x, these
	  methods will return lists, under Python 3.x, these methods will 
	  return iterators.

	- ParseResults now has a method haskeys() which returns True or False
	  depending on whether any results names have been defined. This simplifies
	  testing for the existence of results names under Python 3.x, which 
	  returns keys() as an iterator, not a list.

	- ParseResults now supports both list and dict semantics for pop().
	  If passed no argument or an integer argument, it will use list semantics
	  and pop tokens from the list of parsed tokens. If passed a non-integer
	  argument (most likely a string), it will use dict semantics and 
	  pop the corresponding value from any defined results names. A
	  second default return value argument is supported, just as in 
	  dict.pop().

	- Fixed bug in markInputline, thanks for reporting this, Matt Grant!

	- Cleaned up my unit test environment, now runs with Python 2.6 and 
	  3.3.

- include examples in -doc package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 17 13:15:51 UTC 2013 - speilicke@suse.com

- Update to version 2.0.1:
  - Removed use of "nonlocal" that prevented using this version of 
    pyparsing with Python 2.6 and 2.7. This will make it easier to 
    install for packages that depend on pyparsing, under Python 
    versions 2.6 and later. Those using older versions of Python
    will have to manually install pyparsing 1.5.7.
  - Fixed implementation of <<= operator to return self; reported by
    Luc J. Bourhis, with patch fix by Mathias Mamsch - thanks, Luc
    and Mathias!
- Changes from version 2.0.0:
  - Rather than release another combined Python 2.x/3.x release
    I've decided to start a new major version that is only 
    compatible with Python 3.x (and consequently Python 2.7 as
    well due to backporting of key features). This version will
    be the main development path from now on, with little follow-on
    development on the 1.5.x path.
  - Operator '<<' is now deprecated, in favor of operator '<<=' for
    attaching parsing expressions to Forward() expressions. This is
    being done to address precedence of operations problems with '<<'.
    Operator '<<' will be removed in a future version of pyparsing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- remove nonsensical tarball 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 13 09:04:46 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.5.7:
 * NOTE: This is the last release of pyparsing that will try to 
   maintain compatibility with Python versions < 2.6. The next
   release of pyparsing will be version 2.0.0, using new Python
   syntax that will not be compatible for Python version 2.5 or
   older.
 * An awesome new example is included in this release, submitted
   by Luca DellOlio, for parsing ANTLR grammar definitions, nice
   work Luca!
 * Fixed implementation of ParseResults.__str__ to use Pythonic
   ''.join() instead of repeated string concatenation. This
   purportedly has been a performance issue under PyPy.
 * Fixed bug in ParseResults.__dir__ under Python 3, reported by
   Thomas Kluyver, thank you Thomas!
 * Added ParserElement.inlineLiteralsUsing static method, to 
   override pyparsing's default behavior of converting string
   literals to Literal instances, to use other classes (such
   as Suppress or CaselessLiteral).
 * Added new operator '<<=', which will eventually replace '<<' for 
   storing the contents of a Forward(). '<<=' does not have the same
   operator precedence problems that '<<' does.
 * 'operatorPrecedence' is being renamed 'infixNotation' as a better
   description of what this helper function creates. 'operatorPrecedence'
   is deprecated, and will be dropped entirely in a future release.
 * Added optional arguments lpar and rpar to operatorPrecedence, so that 
   expressions that use it can override the default suppression of the
   grouping characters.
 * Added support for using single argument builtin functions as parse 
   actions.  Now you can write 'expr.setParseAction(len)' and get back
   the length of the list of matched tokens.  Supported builtins are:
   sum, len, sorted, reversed, list, tuple, set, any, all, min, and max.
   A script demonstrating this feature is included in the examples
   directory.
 * Fixed a bug in the definition of 'alphas', which was based on the 
   string.uppercase and string.lowercase "constants", which in fact 
   *aren't* constant, but vary with locale settings. This could make 
   parsers locale-sensitive in a subtle way. Thanks to Kef Schecter for
   his diligence in following through on reporting and monitoring 
   this bugfix!
 * Fixed a bug in the Py3 version of pyparsing, during exception
   handling with packrat parsing enabled, reported by Catherine 
   Devlin - thanks Catherine!
 * Fixed typo in ParseBaseException.__dir__, reported anonymously on 
   the SourceForge bug tracker, thank you Pyparsing User With No Name.
 * Fixed bug in srange when using '\x###' hex character codes.
 * Addeed optional 'intExpr' argument to countedArray, so that you 
   can define your own expression that will evaluate to an integer,
   to be used as the count for the following elements. Allows you 
   to define a countedArray with the count given in hex, for example,
   by defining intExpr as "Word(hexnums).setParseAction(int(t[0],16))".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 30 08:33:22 UTC 2011 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 1.5.6:
  * Cleanup of parse action normalizing code, to be more version-tolerant,
    and robust in the face of future Python versions
  * Removal of exception cacheing, addressing a memory leak condition
    in Python 3.
  * Fixed bug when using packrat parsing, where a previously parsed
    expression would duplicate subsequent tokens
  * Fixed bug in srange, which accepted escaped hex characters of the 
    form '\0x##', but should be '\x##'.  Both forms will be supported
    for backwards compatibility.
  * Added the Verilog parser to the provided set of examples, under the
    MIT license.
  * Added the excludeChars argument to the Word class, to simplify defining
    a word composed of all characters in a large range except for one or two.
  * Added optional overlap parameter to scanString, to return overlapping
    matches found in the source text.
  * Updated oneOf internal regular expression generation, with improved
    parse time performance.
  * Slight performance improvement in transformString, removing empty
    strings from the list of string fragments built while scanning the
    source text, before calling ''.join. Especially useful when using 
    transformString to strip out selected text.
  * Enhanced form of using the "expr('name')" style of results naming,
    in lieu of calling setResultsName.  If name ends with an '*', then
    this is equivalent to expr.setResultsName('name',listAllMatches=True).
  * Fixed up internal list flattener to use iteration instead of recursion,
    to avoid stack overflow when transforming large files.
- Changes from version 1.5.5:
  * Typo in Python3 version of pyparsing, "builtin" should be "builtins".
- Changes from version 1.5.4:
  * Fixed __builtins__ and file references in Python 3 code, thanks to 
    Greg Watson, saulspatz, sminos, and Mark Summerfield for reporting 
    their Python 3 experiences.
- Spec file cleanup:
  * Regenerated with py2pack, much simpler spec file
  * Fixed license to MIT, it's not GPLv2+
