- Update to 1.6.4.post2
  * Fix broken markup in this change log, which restores our nicely formatted
    readme on PyPI.
- Update to 1.6.4
  * Handle a ``TypeError`` that can occur when geometries are torn down (#473,
    #528).
- Update to 1.6.3
  * AttributeError is no longer raised when accessing __geo_interface__ of an
    empty polygon (#450).
  * ``asShape`` now handles empty coordinates in mappings as ``shape`` does
    (#542). Please note that ``asShape`` is likely to be deprecated in a future
    version of Shapely.
  * Check for length of LineString coordinates in speed mode, preventing crashes
    when using LineStrings with only one coordinate (#546).
- Update to 1.6.2
  * A 1.6.2.post1 release has been made to fix a problem with macosx wheels
    uploaded to PyPI.
- Update to 1.6.2
  * Splitting a linestring by one of its end points will now succeed instead of
    failing with a ``ValueError`` (#524, #533).
  * Missing documentation of a geometry's ``overlaps`` predicate has been added
    (#522).
- Update to 1.6.1
  * Avoid ``STRTree`` crashes due to dangling references (#505) by maintaining
    references to added geometries.
  * Reduce log level to debug when reporting on calls to ctypes ``CDLL()`` that
    don't succeed and are retried (#515).
  * Clarification: applications like GeoPandas that need an empty geometry object
    should use ``BaseGeometry()`` instead of ``Point()`` or ``Polygon()``. An
    ``EmptyGeometry`` class has been added in the master development branch and
    will be available in the next non-bugfix release.
- Update to 1.6.0
  + Bug fixes:
    * Passing a single coordinate to ``LineString()`` with speedups disabled now
      raises a ValueError as happens with speedups enabled. This resolves #509.
    * Isolate vendorized packaging in a _vendor directory, remove obsolete
      dist-info, and remove packaging from project requirements (resolves #468).
    * Level for log messages originating from the GEOS notice handler reduced from
      WARNING to INFO (#447).
    * Permit speedups to be imported again without Numpy (#444).
    * Implemented __array_interface__ for empty Points and LineStrings (#403).
    * Remove accidental hard requirement of Numpy (#431).
    * Shapely no longer configures logging in ``geos.py`` (#415).
  + New features:
    * Add support for GeometryCollection to shape and asShape functions (#422).
    * A new error derived from NotImplementedError, with a more useful message, is
      raised when the GEOS backend doesn't support a called method (#216).
    * The ``project()`` method of LineString has been extended to LinearRing
      geometries (#286).
    * A new ``minimum_rotated_rectangle`` attribute has been added to the base
      geometry class (#354).
    * A new ``shapely.ops.polylabel()`` function has been added. It
      computes a point suited for labeling concave polygons (#395).
    * A new ``shapely.ops.split()`` function has been added. It splits a
      geometry by another geometry of lesser dimension: polygon by line, line by
      point (#293, #371).
    * ``Polygon.from_bounds()`` constructs a Polygon from bounding coordinates
      (#392).
    * Support for testing with Numpy 1.4.1 has been added (#301).
    * Support creating all kinds of empty geometries from empty lists of Python
      objects (#397, #404).
  + Packaging:
    * Put Numpy in an optional requirement set named "vectorized" (#431).
    * Added new library search paths to assist Anaconda (#413).
    * geos-config will now be bypassed when NO_GEOS_CONFIG env var is set. This
      allows configuration of Shapely builds on Linux systems that for whatever
      reasons do not include the geos-config program (#322).
    * Packaging 16.7, a setup dependency, is vendorized (#314).
    * Infrastructure for building manylinux1 wheels has been added (#391).
    * The system's ``geos-config`` program is now only checked when ``setup.py``
      is executed, never during normal use of the module (#244).
    * Added new library search paths to assist PyInstaller (#382) and Windows
      (#343).
  + Refactoring:
    * Consolidation of exceptions in ``shapely.errors``.
    * ``UnsupportedGEOSVersionError`` is raised when GEOS < 3.3.0 (#407).
    * Switch from ``SingleSidedBuffer()`` to ``OffsetCurve()`` for GEOS >= 3.3
      (#270).
    * Cython speedups are now enabled by default (#252).

Tue Jul 11 19:43:32 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Implement single-spec version.
- Fix source URL.
- Update to 1.5.17
  * Bug fix: eliminate memory leak in geom_factory() (#408).
  * Bug fix: remove mention of negative distances in parallel_offset and note
    that vertices of right hand offset lines are reversed (#284).
- Update to 1.5.16
  * Bug fix: eliminate memory leak when unpickling geometry objects (#384, #385).
  * Bug fix: prevent crashes when attempting to pickle a prepared geometry,
    raising ``PicklingError`` instead (#386).
  * Packaging: extension modules in the OS X wheels uploaded to PyPI link only
    libgeos_c.dylib now (you can verify and compare to previous releases with
    ``otool -L shapely/vectorized/_vectorized.so``).
- Update to 1.5.15
  * Bug fix: use uintptr_t to store pointers instead of long in _geos.pxi,
    preventing an overflow error (#372, #373). Note that this bug fix was
    erroneously reported to have been made in 1.5.14, but was not.
- Update to 1.5.14
  * Bug fix: use ``type()`` instead of ``isinstance()`` when evaluating geometry
    equality, preventing instances of base and derived classes from 
    being mistaken for equals (#317).
  * Bug fix: ensure that empty geometries are created when constructors have no
    args (#332, #333).
  * Bug fix: support app "freezing" better on Windows by not relying on the
  ``__file__`` attribute (#342, #377).
  * Bug fix: ensure that empty polygons evaluate to be ``==`` (#355).
  * Bug fix: filter out empty geometries that can cause segfaults when creating
    and loading STRtrees (#345, #348).
  * Bug fix: no longer attempt to reuse GEOS DLLs already loaded by Rasterio
    or Fiona on OS X (#374, #375).
- Update to 1.5.13
  * Restore setup and runtime discovery and loading of GEOS shared library to
    state at version 1.5.9 (#326).
  * On OS X we try to reuse any GEOS shared library that may have been loaded
    via import of Fiona or Rasterio in order to avoid a bug involving the
    GEOS AbstractSTRtree (#324, #327).
- Update to 1.5.12
  * Remove configuration of root logger from libgeos.py (#312).
  * Skip test_fallbacks on Windows (#308).
  * Call setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, "") instead of resetlocale() on Windows when
    tearing down the locale test (#308).
  * Fix for Sphinx warnings (#309).
  * Addition of .cache, .idea, .pyd, .pdb to .gitignore (#310).
- Update to 1.5.11
  * Remove packaging module requirement added in 1.5.10 (#305). Distutils can't 
    parse versions using 'rc', but if we stick to 'a' and 'b' we will be fine.
- Update to 1.5.10
  * Monkey patch affinity module by absolute reference (#299).
  * Raise TopologicalError in relate() instead of crashing (#294, #295, #303).
