Wed May 29 13:21:52 UTC 2024 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Cherry-pick upstream patch to fix build with GCC 14
  * https://github.com/shapely/shapely/pull/1945.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  5 11:01:36 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.0.4
  * Fix bug in ``to_wkt`` with multiple empty Z geometries (#2012).
  * Fix bug in ``to_ragged_array`` for an array of Points with
    missing values (#2034).
  * Compatibility with numpy 2
- Release 2.0.3
  * Fix regression in the ``oriented_envelope`` ufunc to accept
    array-like input in case of GEOS<3.12 (#1929).
  * The binary wheels are not yet compatible with a future NumPy
    2.0 release, therefore a ``numpy<2`` upper pin was added to the
    requirements (#1972).
  * Upgraded the GEOS version in the binary wheel distributions to
    3.11.3.

Mon Nov 20 14:09:13 UTC 2023 - Ana Guerrero <ana.guerrero@suse.com>

- Update to 2.0.2 
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fix regression in the (in)equality comparison (geom1 == geom2)
    using __eq__ to not ignore the z-coordinates (#1732).
  * Fix MultiPolygon() constructor to accept polygons without
    holes (#1850).
  * Fix minimum_rotated_rectangle (oriented_envelope) to
    always return the minimum area solution (instead of minimum
    width). In practice, it will use the GEOS implementation only
    for GEOS 3.12+, and for older GEOS versions fall back to
    the implementation that was included in Shapely < 2 (#1670).
  * Fix from_ragged_array to work with read-only array input
    (#1744).
  * Fix the handling of z coordinates shapely.ops.substring
    (#1699).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 23 09:08:05 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.0.1
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fix regression in the Polygon() constructor taking a sequence
    of Points (#1662).
  * Fix regression in the geometry constructors when passing
    decimal.Decimal coordinate values (#1707).
  * Fix STRtree() to not make the passed geometry array immutable
    as side-effect of the constructor (#1714).
  * Fix the directed keyword in shapely.ops.linemerge() (#1695).
  ## Improvements:
  * Expose the function to get a matplotlib Patch object from a
    (Multi)Polygon (without already plotting it) publicly as
    :func:shapely.plotting.patch_from_polygon (#1704).
- Release 2.0.0
  * Shapely version 2.0.0 is a major release featuring a complete
    refactor of the internals and new vectorized (element-wise)
    array operations providing considerable performance
    improvements (based on the developments in the PyGEOS package),
    along with several breaking API changes and many feature
    improvements.

Sat Oct  1 21:19:48 UTC 2022 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 1.8.4.
  * The new c_geom_p type caused a regression and has been removed
    (#1487).
- Update for version 1.8.3.
  * Deprecations:
    * The STRtree class will be changed in 2.0.0 and will not be
      compatible with the class in versions 1.8.x. This change
      obsoletes the deprecation announcement in 1.8a3 (below).
  * Bug fixes:
    * The signature for GEOSMinimumClearance has been corrected,
      fixing an issue affecting aarch64-darwin (#1480)
    * Return and arg types have been corrected and made more strict
      for area, length, and distance properties.
    * A new c_geom_p type has been created to replace c_void_p when
      calling GEOS functions (#1479).
    * An incorrect polygon-line intersection (#1427) has been fixed
      in GEOS 3.10.3,mwhich will be included in wheels published
      to PyPI.
    * GEOS buffer parameters are now destroyed, fixing a memory
      leak (#1440).
- Remove patch, fix upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 20 10:48:47 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.8.2
  - Make Polygons and MultiPolygons closed by definition, like
    LinearRings. Resolves #1246.
  - Perform frozen app check for GEOS before conda env check on
    macos as we already do on linux (#1301).
  - Fix leak of GEOS coordinate sequence in nearest_points reported
    in #1098.
- Release 1.8.1
  * Wheels for 1.8.1 published on PyPI include GEOS 3.10.2. This
    version is the best version of GDAL yet. Discrepancies in
    behavior compared to previous versions are considered to be
    improvements.
  * Shapely 1.8.1 works with Pythons 3.6-3.10.
  * Require Cython >= 0.29.24 to support Python 3.10 (#1224).
  * Fix array_interface_base (#1235).
- Fix libgeos* runtime requirement undetected due to the ctypes
  load

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 10 22:17:06 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.8.0
  * Shapely 1.8.0 is a transitional version. There are a few bug
    fixes and new features, but it largely exists to warn about the
    upcoming changes in 2.0.0. See the new migration guide for more
    details on how to update your code from Shapely 1.8 to 2.0.
  * Shapely 1.8.0 supports only Python versions >= 3.6. The release
    is compatible with GEOS versions 3.6-3.10.
  * Deprecations: The following functions and geometry attributes
    and methods will be removed in version 2.0.0.
    - ops.cascaded_union
    - BaseGeometry.empty
    - BaseGeometry.ctypes and __array_interface__
    - multi-part geometry __len__
    - setting custom attributes on geometry objects
    - BaseGeometry.almost_exact
    - Deprecation warnings will be emitted in 1.8.0 when any of
      these features are used. 
  * The deprecated to_wkb and to_wkt methods of BaseGeometry have
    been removed.
  * The STRtree nearest* methods now take an optional argument that
    specifies exclusion of the input geometry from results (#1115).
  * A GeometryTypeError has been added to shapely.errors and is
    consistently raised instead of TypeError or ValueError as in
    version 1.7. For backwards compatibility, the new exception
    will derive from TypeError and Value error until version 2.0
    (#1099).
  * The STRtree class constructor now takes an optional second
    argument, a sequence of objects to be stored in the tree. If
    not provided, the sequence indices of the geometries will be
    stored, as before (#1112).
  * The STRtree class has new query_geoms, query_items,
    nearest_geom, and nearest_item methods (#1112). The query and
    nearest methods remain as aliases for query_geoms and
    nearest_geom.
  * A normalize method has been added to geometry classes, exposing
    the GEOSNormalize algorithm (#1090).
  * STRtree instances have a new default capacity of 10 items per
    node (#1070).
  * The new shapely.ops.voronoi_diagram computes the Voronoi
    Diagram of a geometry or geometry collection (#833, #851).
  * shapely.validation.make_valid fixes invalid geometries (#883).

- Update to 1.6.4.post2
  * Fix broken markup in this change log, which restores our nicely formatted
    readme on PyPI.
- Update to 1.6.4
  * Handle a ``TypeError`` that can occur when geometries are torn down (#473,
    #528).
- Update to 1.6.3
  * AttributeError is no longer raised when accessing __geo_interface__ of an
    empty polygon (#450).
  * ``asShape`` now handles empty coordinates in mappings as ``shape`` does
    (#542). Please note that ``asShape`` is likely to be deprecated in a future
    version of Shapely.
  * Check for length of LineString coordinates in speed mode, preventing crashes
    when using LineStrings with only one coordinate (#546).
- Update to 1.6.2
  * A 1.6.2.post1 release has been made to fix a problem with macosx wheels
    uploaded to PyPI.
- Update to 1.6.2
  * Splitting a linestring by one of its end points will now succeed instead of
    failing with a ``ValueError`` (#524, #533).
  * Missing documentation of a geometry's ``overlaps`` predicate has been added
    (#522).
- Update to 1.6.1
  * Avoid ``STRTree`` crashes due to dangling references (#505) by maintaining
    references to added geometries.
  * Reduce log level to debug when reporting on calls to ctypes ``CDLL()`` that
    don't succeed and are retried (#515).
  * Clarification: applications like GeoPandas that need an empty geometry object
    should use ``BaseGeometry()`` instead of ``Point()`` or ``Polygon()``. An
    ``EmptyGeometry`` class has been added in the master development branch and
    will be available in the next non-bugfix release.
- Update to 1.6.0
  + Bug fixes:
    * Passing a single coordinate to ``LineString()`` with speedups disabled now
      raises a ValueError as happens with speedups enabled. This resolves #509.
    * Isolate vendorized packaging in a _vendor directory, remove obsolete
      dist-info, and remove packaging from project requirements (resolves #468).
    * Level for log messages originating from the GEOS notice handler reduced from
      WARNING to INFO (#447).
    * Permit speedups to be imported again without Numpy (#444).
    * Implemented __array_interface__ for empty Points and LineStrings (#403).
    * Remove accidental hard requirement of Numpy (#431).
    * Shapely no longer configures logging in ``geos.py`` (#415).
  + New features:
    * Add support for GeometryCollection to shape and asShape functions (#422).
    * A new error derived from NotImplementedError, with a more useful message, is
      raised when the GEOS backend doesn't support a called method (#216).
    * The ``project()`` method of LineString has been extended to LinearRing
      geometries (#286).
    * A new ``minimum_rotated_rectangle`` attribute has been added to the base
      geometry class (#354).
    * A new ``shapely.ops.polylabel()`` function has been added. It
      computes a point suited for labeling concave polygons (#395).
    * A new ``shapely.ops.split()`` function has been added. It splits a
      geometry by another geometry of lesser dimension: polygon by line, line by
      point (#293, #371).
    * ``Polygon.from_bounds()`` constructs a Polygon from bounding coordinates
      (#392).
    * Support for testing with Numpy 1.4.1 has been added (#301).
    * Support creating all kinds of empty geometries from empty lists of Python
      objects (#397, #404).
  + Packaging:
    * Put Numpy in an optional requirement set named "vectorized" (#431).
    * Added new library search paths to assist Anaconda (#413).
    * geos-config will now be bypassed when NO_GEOS_CONFIG env var is set. This
      allows configuration of Shapely builds on Linux systems that for whatever
      reasons do not include the geos-config program (#322).
    * Packaging 16.7, a setup dependency, is vendorized (#314).
    * Infrastructure for building manylinux1 wheels has been added (#391).
    * The system's ``geos-config`` program is now only checked when ``setup.py``
      is executed, never during normal use of the module (#244).
    * Added new library search paths to assist PyInstaller (#382) and Windows
      (#343).
  + Refactoring:
    * Consolidation of exceptions in ``shapely.errors``.
    * ``UnsupportedGEOSVersionError`` is raised when GEOS < 3.3.0 (#407).
    * Switch from ``SingleSidedBuffer()`` to ``OffsetCurve()`` for GEOS >= 3.3
      (#270).
    * Cython speedups are now enabled by default (#252).

- Fix source URL.
- Update to 1.5.17
  * Bug fix: eliminate memory leak in geom_factory() (#408).
  * Bug fix: remove mention of negative distances in parallel_offset and note
    that vertices of right hand offset lines are reversed (#284).
- Update to 1.5.16
  * Bug fix: eliminate memory leak when unpickling geometry objects (#384, #385).
  * Bug fix: prevent crashes when attempting to pickle a prepared geometry,
    raising ``PicklingError`` instead (#386).
  * Packaging: extension modules in the OS X wheels uploaded to PyPI link only
    libgeos_c.dylib now (you can verify and compare to previous releases with
    ``otool -L shapely/vectorized/_vectorized.so``).
- Update to 1.5.15
  * Bug fix: use uintptr_t to store pointers instead of long in _geos.pxi,
    preventing an overflow error (#372, #373). Note that this bug fix was
    erroneously reported to have been made in 1.5.14, but was not.
- Update to 1.5.14
  * Bug fix: use ``type()`` instead of ``isinstance()`` when evaluating geometry
    equality, preventing instances of base and derived classes from 
    being mistaken for equals (#317).
  * Bug fix: ensure that empty geometries are created when constructors have no
    args (#332, #333).
  * Bug fix: support app "freezing" better on Windows by not relying on the
  ``__file__`` attribute (#342, #377).
  * Bug fix: ensure that empty polygons evaluate to be ``==`` (#355).
  * Bug fix: filter out empty geometries that can cause segfaults when creating
    and loading STRtrees (#345, #348).
  * Bug fix: no longer attempt to reuse GEOS DLLs already loaded by Rasterio
    or Fiona on OS X (#374, #375).
- Update to 1.5.13
  * Restore setup and runtime discovery and loading of GEOS shared library to
    state at version 1.5.9 (#326).
  * On OS X we try to reuse any GEOS shared library that may have been loaded
    via import of Fiona or Rasterio in order to avoid a bug involving the
    GEOS AbstractSTRtree (#324, #327).
- Update to 1.5.12
  * Remove configuration of root logger from libgeos.py (#312).
  * Skip test_fallbacks on Windows (#308).
  * Call setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, "") instead of resetlocale() on Windows when
    tearing down the locale test (#308).
  * Fix for Sphinx warnings (#309).
  * Addition of .cache, .idea, .pyd, .pdb to .gitignore (#310).
- Update to 1.5.11
  * Remove packaging module requirement added in 1.5.10 (#305). Distutils can't 
    parse versions using 'rc', but if we stick to 'a' and 'b' we will be fine.
- Update to 1.5.10
  * Monkey patch affinity module by absolute reference (#299).
  * Raise TopologicalError in relate() instead of crashing (#294, #295, #303).
