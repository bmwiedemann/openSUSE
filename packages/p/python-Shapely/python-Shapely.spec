%description
Shapely is a Python package for manipulation and analysis of
planar geometric objects. It is based on the GEOS (the
engine of PostGIS) and JTS (from which GEOS is ported) libraries.
Shapely is not concerned with data formats or coordinate systems,
but can be readily integrated with packages that are like WorldMill
and pyproj.
