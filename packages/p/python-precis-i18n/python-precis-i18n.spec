%description
The PRECIS framework makes internationalised user names and
passwords safer for use by applications. PRECIS profiles transform
unicode strings into a canonical form, suitable for comparison.

This module implements the PRECIS Framework as described in:
 - PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of
   Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols (RFC 8264).
 - Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized
   Strings Representing Usernames and Passwords (RFC 8265).
 - Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized
   Strings Representing Nicknames (RFC 8266).
