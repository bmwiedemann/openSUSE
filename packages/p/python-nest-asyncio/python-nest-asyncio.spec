%description
By design asyncio `does not allow <https://bugs.python.org/issue22239>`_
its event loop to be nested. This presents a practical problem:
When in an environment where the event loop is
already running it's impossible to run tasks and wait
for the result. Trying to do so will give the error
"``RuntimeError: This event loop is already running``".

The issue pops up in various environments, such as web servers,
GUI applications and in Jupyter notebooks.

This module patches asyncio to allow nested use of ``asyncio.run`` and
``loop.run_until_complete``.
