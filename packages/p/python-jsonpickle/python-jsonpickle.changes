  * support new sqlalchemy
- Remove merged patch sqlalchemy13.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 19 08:12:54 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

  * sqlalchemy13.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 15 13:00:30 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.1:
  * Python 3.7 collections.Iterator deprecation warnings have been fixed. (#229).
  * Improved Pandas support for datetime and complex numbers. (#245)
  * NOTE jsonpickle no longer supports Python2.6, or Python3 < 3.4. The officially supported Python versions are now 2.7 and 3.4+.
  * Improved Pandas and Numpy support. (#227)
  * Improved support for pickling iterators. (#216)
  * Better support for the stdlib json module when simplejson is not installed. (#217)
  * jsonpickle will now output python3-style module names when pickling builtins methods or functions. (#223)
  * jsonpickle will always flatten primitives, even when max_depth is reached, which avoids encoding unicode strings into their u'string' representation.
  * Nested classes are now supported on Python 3. (#206, #176).
  * Better support for older (pre-1.9) versions of numpy (#195).

Wed May 23 04:19:13 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.9.6
  * Better support for SQLAlchemy (#180).
  * Better support for NumPy and SciKit-Learn. (#184).
- Update to version 0.9.5
  * Better support for objects that implement the reduce protocol. (#170).
- Remove no longer relevant handle_more_than_two_args.patch
- Spec file cleanups

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 26 03:51:53 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Implement single-spec version.
- Fix source URL.
- Update to Version 0.9.4
    * Arbitrary byte streams are now better supported.
      (`#143 <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/143>`_).
    * Better support for NumPy data types.  The Python3 NumPy support
      is especially robust.
    * Fortran-ordered based NumPy arrays are now properly serialized.
- Update to Version 0.9.3
    * UUID objects can now be serialized
      (`#130 <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/130>`_).
    * Added `set_decoder_options` method to allow decoder specific options
      equal to `set_encoder_options`.
    * Int keys can be encoded directly by e.g. demjson by passing
      `numeric_keys=True` and setting its backend options via
      `jsonpickle.set_encoder_options('demjson', strict=False)`.
    * Newer Numpy versions (v1.10+) are now supported.
- Update to Version 0.9.2
    * Fixes for serializing objects with custom handlers.
    * We now properly serialize deque objects constructed with a `maxlen` parameter.
    * Test suite fixes
- Update to Version 0.9.1
    * Support datetime objects with FixedOffsets.
- Update to Version 0.9.0
    * Support for Pickle Protocol v4.
    * We now support serializing defaultdict subclasses that use `self`
      as their default factory.
    * We now have a decorator syntax for registering custom handlers,
      and allow custom handlers to register themselves for all subclasses.
      (`#104 <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/pull/104>`_).
    * We now support serializing types with metaclasses and their
      instances (e.g., Python 3 `enum`).
    * We now support serializing bytestrings in both Python 2 and Python 3.
      In Python 2, the `str` type is decoded to UTF-8 whenever possible and
      serialized as a true bytestring elsewise; in Python 3, bytestrings
      are explicitly encoded/decoded as bytestrings. Unicode strings are
      always encoded as is in both Python 2 and Python 3.
    * Added support for serializing numpy arrays, dtypes and scalars
      (see `jsonpickle.ext.numpy` module).
- Update to Version 0.8.0
    * We now support serializing objects that contain references to
      module-level functions
      (`#77 <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/77>`_).
    * Better Pickle Protocol v2 support
      (`#78 <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/78>`_).
    * Support for string __slots__ and iterable __slots__
      (`#67 <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/66>`_)
      (`#68 <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/67>`_).
    * `encode()` now has a `warn` option that makes jsonpickle emit warnings
      when encountering objects that cannot be pickled.
    * A Javascript implementation of jsonpickle is now included
      in the jsonpickleJS directory.
- Update to Version 0.7.2
    * We now properly serialize classes that inherit from classes
      that use `__slots__` and add additional slots in the derived class.
    * jsonpickle can now serialize objects that implement `__getstate__()` but
      not `__setstate__()`.  The result of `__getstate__()` is returned as-is
      when doing a round-trip from Python objects to jsonpickle and back.
    * Better support for collections.defaultdict with custom factories.
    * Added support for `queue.Queue` objects.
- Update to Version 0.7.1
    * Added support for Python 3.4.
    * Added support for :class:`posix.stat_result`.
- Update to Version 0.7.0
    * Added ``handles`` decorator to :class:`jsonpickle.handlers.BaseHandler`,
      enabling simple declaration of a handler for a class.
    * `__getstate__()` and `__setstate__()` are now honored
      when pickling objects that subclass :class:`dict`.
    * jsonpickle can now serialize :class:`collections.Counter` objects.
    * Object references are properly handled when using integer keys.
    * Object references are now supported when using custom handlers.
    * Decimal objects are supported in Python 3.
    * jsonpickle's "fallthrough-on-error" behavior can now be disabled.
    * Simpler API for registering custom handlers.
    * A new "safe-mode" is provided which avoids eval().
      Backwards-compatible deserialization of repr-serialized objects
      is disabled in this mode.  e.g. `decode(string, safe=True)`
- Update to Version 0.6.1
    * Python 3.2 support, and additional fixes for Python 3.
- Update to Version 0.6.0
    * Python 3 support!
    * :class:`time.struct_time` is now serialized using the built-in
      :class:`jsonpickle.handlers.SimpleReduceHandler`.
- Update to Version 0.5.0
    * Non-string dictionary keys (e.g. ints, objects) are now supported
      by passing `keys=True` to :func:`jsonpickle.encode` and
      :func:`jsonpickle.decode`.
    * We now support namedtuple, deque, and defaultdict.
    * Datetimes with timezones are now fully supported.
    * Better support for complicated structures e.g.
      datetime inside dicts.
    * jsonpickle added support for references and cyclical data structures
      in 0.4.0.  This can be disabled by passing `make_refs=False` to
      :func:`jsonpickle.encode`.
- Add handle_more_than_two_args.patch
  Needed for python 3.6 compatibility. Note that only the first
  part of the upstream patch is used. The second part is travis CI
  changes.
