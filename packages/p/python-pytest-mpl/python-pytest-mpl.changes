  ## Fixes
  * Make summary log message about test results in general instead
    of failures by @neutrinoceros in #148
  * Add support for classes with pytest 7 by @ConorMacBride in #164

    to be done:
    - Hash library test names will need to be regenerated/updated
      to include the class name.
    - If the undocumented mpl-use-full-test-name ini option is
      enabled, the the baseline images will need to be regenerated,
      or have their filename updated to include the class name.

    @ConorMacBride in #165
  * Improve tests/subtests by @ConorMacBride in #163
