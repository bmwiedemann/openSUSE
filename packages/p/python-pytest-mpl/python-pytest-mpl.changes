    of failures by @neutrinoceros in #148

    - Hash library test names will need to be regenerated/updated
      to include the class name.
    - If the undocumented mpl-use-full-test-name ini option is
      enabled, the the baseline images will need to be regenerated,
      or have their filename updated to include the class name.
