Wed Apr  1 21:04:26 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 0.24.0:
  * The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major
    version only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the
    --python-tag option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned
    in the changelog then.
  * wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use "wheel convert
    [archive]" instead.
  * Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via
    the extras_require={} syntax. Separate 'extra' names from
    conditions using the : character. Wheel's own setup.py does
    this. (The empty-string extra is the same as install_requires.)
    These conditional requirements should work the same whether the
    package is installed by wheel or by setup.py.
- additional changes from 0.23.0:
  * Compatibiltiy tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
  * sdist should include files necessary for tests
  * 'wheel convert' can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
  * Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
  * The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating
    scripts is now the default. The option was a temporary approach
    until installers could generate scripts themselves. That is now
    the case with pip 1.5 and later. Note that using pip 1.4 to
    install a wheel without scripts will leave the installation
    without entry-point wrappers. The "wheel install-scripts"
    command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
  * Thank you contributors
- removed wininst2wheel and egg2wheel:
  they are not in 0.24.0 anymore
