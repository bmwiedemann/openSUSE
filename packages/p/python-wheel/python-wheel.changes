Sat Dec  3 02:56:36 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.38.4
  * Fixed PKG-INFO conversion in bdist_wheel mangling UTF-8 header values in METADATA (PR by Anderson Bravalheri)

- Update to version 0.38.3 
  * Fixed install failure when used with --no-binary, reported on Ubuntu 20.04, by removing setup_requires from setup.cfg

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  5 20:12:16 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * require python >= 3.7

- update to version 0.38.2:
  * Fixed regression introduced in v0.38.1 which broke parsing of
    wheel file names with multiple platform tags

- changes from version 0.38.1:
  * Removed install dependency on setuptools
  * The future-proof fix in 0.36.0 for converting PyPy's SOABI into a
    abi tag was faulty. Fixed so that future changes in the SOABI will
    not change the tag.

- changes from version 0.38.0:
  * Dropped support for Python < 3.7
  * Updated vendored "packaging" to 21.3
  * Replaced all uses of "distutils" with "setuptools"
  * The handling of "license_files" (including glob patterns and
    default values) is now delegated to "setuptools>=57.0.0" (#466).
    The package dependencies were updated to reflect this change.
  * Fixed potential DoS attack via the "WHEEL_INFO_RE" regular
    expression
  * Fixed "ValueError: ZIP does not support timestamps before 1980"
    when using "SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0" or when on-disk timestamps are
    earlier than 1980-01-01. Such timestamps are now changed to the
    minimum value before packaging.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 29 15:57:58 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Revert to 0.37.1
  * v0.38.0 has been yanked from PyPI

  * Dropped support for Python < 3.7
  * Updated vendored "packaging" to 21.3
  * Replaced all uses of "distutils" with "setuptools"
  * The handling of "license_files" (including glob patterns and
    default values) is now delegated to "setuptools>=57.0.0" (#466).

    minimum value before packaging.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 14 22:08:28 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.37.1:
  * Fixed ``wheel pack`` duplicating the ``WHEEL`` contents when the build
   number has changed Fixed parsing of file names containing commas in
   ``RECORD`` (PR by Hood Chatham)
  * Added official Python 3.10 support
  * Updated vendored ``packaging`` library to v20.9
- Also remove the conditional definition of python_module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 28 12:55:30 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- When we limit setuptools in Requires, we should certainly do it
  in BuildRequires as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 24 18:08:08 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Codify version requirement on setuptools for building.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  5 16:06:03 UTC 2021 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@suse.de>

- Added BuildRequires:  alts

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  1 08:45:20 UTC 2021 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@suse.de>

- Use libalternatives instead of update-alternatives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 28 23:25:52 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.36.2:
  - Updated vendored ``packaging`` library to v20.8
  - Fixed wheel sdist missing ``LICENSE.txt``
  - Don't use default ``macos/arm64`` deployment target in calculating the
    platform tag for fat binaries (PR by Ronald Oussoren)
  - Fixed ``AssertionError`` when ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` was set to ``11``
    (PR by Grzegorz Bokota and François-Xavier Coudert)
  - Fixed regression introduced in 0.36.0 on Python 2.7 when a custom generator
    name was passed as unicode (Scikit-build)
    (``TypeError: 'unicode' does not have the buffer interface``)
  - Added official Python 3.9 support
  - Updated vendored ``packaging`` library to v20.7
  - Switched to always using LF as line separator when generating ``WHEEL`` files
    (on Windows, CRLF was being used instead)
  - The ABI tag is taken from  the sysconfig SOABI value. On PyPy the SOABI value
    is ``pypy37-pp73`` which is not compliant with PEP 3149, as it should have
    both the API tag and the platform tag. This change future-proofs any change
    in PyPy's SOABI tag to make sure only the ABI tag is used by wheel.
  - Fixed regression and test for ``bdist_wheel --plat-name``. It was ignored for
    C extensions in v0.35, but the regression was not detected by tests.
  - Replaced install dependency on ``packaging`` with a vendored copy of its
    ``tags`` module
  - Fixed ``bdist_wheel`` not working on FreeBSD due to mismatching platform tag
    name (it was not being converted to lowercase)
  - Switched to the packaging_ library for computing wheel tags
  - Fixed a resource leak in ``WheelFile.open()`` (PR by Jon Dufresne)

  * Fixed egg2wheel compatibility with the future release of Python 3.10 (PR by Anthony Sottile)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 17 10:35:46 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Switch to mulitbuild to avoid dep on pytest by default
  (As pytest needs wheel to build itself)

    quoted in `RECORD` (PR by Paul Moore)
  * Sort requirements extras to ensure deterministic builds

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 23 08:01:20 UTC 2018 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

  * Fixed handling of direct URL requirements with markers (PR by
    Benoit Pierre)

Tue Sep 29 08:01:25 UTC 2015 - tbechtold@suse.com

- update to 0.26.0:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  1 21:04:26 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 0.24.0:
  * The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major
    version only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the
    --python-tag option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned
    in the changelog then.
  * wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use "wheel convert
    [archive]" instead.
  * Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via
    the extras_require={} syntax. Separate 'extra' names from
    conditions using the : character. Wheel's own setup.py does
    this. (The empty-string extra is the same as install_requires.)
    These conditional requirements should work the same whether the
    package is installed by wheel or by setup.py.
- additional changes from 0.23.0:
  * Compatibiltiy tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
  * sdist should include files necessary for tests
  * 'wheel convert' can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
  * Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
  * The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating
    scripts is now the default. The option was a temporary approach
    until installers could generate scripts themselves. That is now
    the case with pip 1.5 and later. Note that using pip 1.4 to
    install a wheel without scripts will leave the installation
    without entry-point wrappers. The "wheel install-scripts"
    command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
  * Thank you contributors
- removed wininst2wheel and egg2wheel:
  they are not in 0.24.0 anymore
