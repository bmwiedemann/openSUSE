%description
This module is a low-level interface to the Mac OS X Property List (plist)
format in either XML or binary. You probably shouldn't use this in
applicationsâ€“build interfaces on top of this so you don't have to put all
the heinous multi-level object stuff where people have to look at it.

You can parse a plist file and get back a data structure. You can take that
data structure and get back the plist as XML. If you want to change the
structure inbetween that's your business. :)

You don't need to be on Mac OS X to use this. It simply parses and
manipulates a text format that Mac OS X uses.

If you need to work with the old ASCII or newer JSON formet, you can use
the *plutil* tool that comes with MacOS X:

	% plutil -convert xml1 -o ExampleBinary.xml.plist ExampleBinary.plist

Or, you can extend this module to handle those formats (and send a pull
request).
