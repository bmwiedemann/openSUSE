  <title>Edit your JIRA tickets using locally-stored text files in a git/hg-inspired way</title>
  <description>Pronounced like 'giraffes', but totally unrelated to wildlife, this library lets you stay out of JIRA as much as possible by letting you edit your JIRA issues as a collection of text files using an interface inspired by git and hg.</description>
