    <comment>- Update to 2.2.0, partial changelog:
  * Fixes a bug in which search results from search_users were not being displayed. (Issue #61)
  * Fixes another field deletion/addition problem relating to Issue #59
  * Fixes a bug preventing the match subcommand from being able to properly obtain field values. (Issue #60)
  * Fixes several minor bugs relating to issue previews including:
  * In certain situations, the preview automatic change detection would become stuck in a loop causing the page to refresh continuously.
  * Preview document was not delivered with an UTF-8 charset, so non-latin-1 characters would be mangled.
  * Changes to Jira fields would not be refreshed when rendering preview after submitting changes.
  * Insufficient whitespace between comments may cause Jira to misinterpret headers as part of a previous comment's bulleted list.
  * Fixes bug that would cause an unhelpful traceback to be displayed if you were to run Jirafs commands outside of a ticketfolder.
  * Fixes to various bugs relating to merging upstream changes from Jira with un-pushed local changes.
  * User is now warned about conflicts were they to occur when merging-in upstream changes.
  * Conflicts are displayed on the status display should they exist, including instructions about how to resolve them.
  * Additional polish for 'preview' function including:
  * Fixes to exception display in-console for harmless errors resulting from clients navigating away.
  * Defaulting behavior such that server will automatically self-terminate when the user navigates away. If this behavior is not desired, a command-line argument --serve-forever is available.
  * Adding display of comments for 'all' preview mode.
  * Adds links allowing you to jump to the specific section you're interested in when in the 'all' preview mode.
  * Macro reversal changes for comments.read_only.jira: No longer will macros be reversed for read-only files given that the content of historical comments cannot be changed.
  * Users can now set a preferred date format by setting a configuration value main.date_format.
  * Obsolete and undocumented &quot;Clone&quot; functionality allowing you to clone a Jira ticketfolder from a git repository (instead of directly from a Jira issue) was removed.
  * Jira server URL inference when cloning by using an issue number instead of a ticket URL is improved to be more foolproof.
