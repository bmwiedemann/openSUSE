%description
A Python wrapper around the Trello API. Provides a group of
Python classes to represent Trello Objects. None of the classes
cache values as they are designed to be inherited and extended to
suit the needs of each user. Each class includes a basic set of
methods based on general use cases. This library was based on
work done by [sarumont](https://github.com/sarumont/py-trello).
Very little was kept from this code, but still props on the
initial work.
