  <title>Sphinx DocumentedList extension</title>
  <description>Sphinx extension to convert a Python list into a table in the generated
documentation. The intended application of this extension is to document
the items of essentially list-like objects of immutable data (possibly
enums, though python 3.4 enums are not supported yet).

In the source code, each list item, instead of being just its native
data type, should be replaced by a tuple of two elements. In the
simplest application, the second element of the tuple should be a string
providing a description for the item.
