    - If the mode in deblend_sources is “exponential” or “sinh” and
      there are too many potential deblended sources within a given
      source (watershed markers), a warning will be raised and the
      mode will be changed to “linear”. [#1369]
    - The SourceCatalog make_circular_apertures and

      radius (the second element of kron_params) if the data or
      radially weighted data sum to zero. [#1381]

      raised if the data and error arrays have different units.
      [#1285].

      would result in incorrect image padding if only one of the
      axes needed padding. [#1292]

      range. If backwards-compatiblity is needed with older
      Photutils versions, set clip=False. [#1324]
  * photutils.centroid
    * Removed the deprecated centroid_epsf and gaussian1d_moments
      functions. [#1280]
    * Importing tools from the centroids subpackage now requires

      circular_aperture, circular_photometry, and fluxfrac_radius.
      [#1264]
    * Units are applied to SourceCatalog circular_photometry output
