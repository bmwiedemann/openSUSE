- Update to 1.0.2
  * @nsmith- fixed virtual arrays in ak.to_arrow (PR #642).
  * Fixed #628, allowing np.int64(N) to be used in a slice like
    integer N (PR #636).
  * Added the ability to select fields inside of nested 
    records with syntax like array[[“pt”, “eta”, “phi”], 
    “nominal”] (#619).
  * Fixed Apache Arrow → Awkward Array (ak.from_arrow) for 
    sliced Arrow arrays: it has an offset attribute we had 
    been ignoring (#625). Thanks to @trickarcher for the 
    extensive tests!
  * Ensured that an ak.Array’s behavior always gets passed to 
    output of any operation (#626), even if the input is a 
    dict (#627, affected ak.zip, ak.cartesian, and 
    ak.argcartesian).
  * Fixed #629, ak.with_field dropping parameters (#631), 
    and #634, ak.fill_none not accepting a Record as a fill 
    value (#635).
  * Added a roadmap and upvote/thumbs up instructions to the 
    README.
  * @jpivarski revised the ak.concatenate implementation 
    (#610), fixed a bug related to axis handling (#612), and 
    made ak.concatenate friendlier to lazy arrays (#613; 
    “friendlier” = “materializes arrays in fewer cases”).
  * @chrisburr added setuptools as a requirement because it 
    is used for pkg_resources.
  * @ianna added validity-checking for strings, bytestrings, 
    and categorical (#571), including some revisions of 
    sorting and a partial implementation of checking for 
    uniqueness and identifying unique elements from arrays 
    that can later be used to implement np.unique.
  * Updated Awkward <–> Arrow conversion to preserve nullability 
    in type (PRs #602, #606). Preemptively avoiding warnings 
    from NumPy 1.20 (#599) and fixed 32-bit Linux cases in the 
    tests (#604).
  * @henryiii fixed hardcoded threads in MacOS compilation 
    target (for deploying to conda-forge).
- Drop awkward-tests-on-32bit.patch merged upstream

Wed Dec 16 00:13:41 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add awkward-tests-on-32bit.patch: Fix tests on 32 bit systems;
  patch taken from upstream PR [gh#scikit-hep/awkward-1.0#600].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 15 00:31:07 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Disable tests making use of 64 bit data types on i586
  (gh#scikit-hep#awkward-1.0#600).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 14 23:23:12 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Move header files to standard header dir and package them plus
  symlink to shared lib as part of awkward-devel package (for use
  by C/C++ coders).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 13 19:06:50 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add awkward-correct-includedir.patch: Make awkward.config return
  the correct includedir (/usr/include/awkward) where we move the
  header files to (default installation is to
  python_sitearch/awkward/include, which is non-std).
- Add awkward-cmake-build-with-RelWithDebInfo.patch: Set
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to RelWithDebInfo by default instead of
  Release.
