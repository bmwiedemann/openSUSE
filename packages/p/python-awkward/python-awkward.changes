-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 21:34:45 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.0.6
  * feat: expose typetracer in public backend API by @agoose77 in #2066
  * feat: add byteorder argument to to_buffers by @agoose77 in #2095
  * feat: add exception for missing field by @agoose77 in #2120
- Release 2.0.3 and 2.0.4
 * The flatten_records argument of all reducers (ak.all, ak.any,
   ..., ak.var) has effectively been removed: setting it now raises
   an error (PR #2020). This argument applies a reducer to all
   contents of a record, merging fields, and it had to be removed
   to properly implement axis=None. The old default,
   flatten_records=False, is now the only behavior, and to get the
   equivalent of flatten_records=True, you can use ak.ravel:
        ak.sum(array, flatten_records=True)
   becomes
       ak.sum(ak.ravel(array))
  * Removing the feature is still the right thing to do, but the
    function argument needs to go through a deprecation cycle,
    since libraries like dask-awkward pass arguments through to
    Awkward. Removing flatten_records as an argument introduces an
    error, even if the surviving case of flatten_records=False is
    desired.
- Release 2.0.2
  * feat: add ak.drop_none() by @ioanaif in #1904
- Release 2.0.1
  * feat: add ak.without_field by @agoose77 in #1963
- Release 2.0.0
  * The Awkward Array version 2 project started in June of 2021 and
    has been developed alongside version 1 updates. For most of
    that time, it was available as a submodule, awkward._v2, so
    that it could be tested with the same tests as version 1 and
    could be experimented upon by early adopters.
  * Despite the long list of PRs, the high-level interface changes
    from version 1 to version 2 were kept at a minimum. For the
    most part, the Awkward 1.x API is fine, but the internal
    implementation needed an overhaul to prevent technical debt.
  ## Summary of changes
  * Nearly all of the code is written in Python now. Exceptions are
    the "kernel" functions, GrowableBuffer, LayoutBuilder,
    ArrayBuilder, AwkwardForth, and dynamically generated C++ code
    for RDataFrame.
  * Maintains performance because any algorithms that scale with
    the size of an array are implemented in compiled "kernel"
    functions.
  * Split into two packages: awkward-cpp for the C++ part
    (infrequently updated, binary distribution for most platforms
    and Python versions) and awkward, the Python part (frequently
    updated).
  * Virtual arrays and Partitions (collectively, "lazy arrays")
    have been removed in favor of dask-awkward.
  * Awkward Arrays can be converted to and from RDataFrame,
    generating C++ for ROOT to JIT-compile so that iteration over
    Awkward Array input is fast (adapted from the Numba
    implementation).
  * Auto-differentiation of functions on Awkward Arrays using JAX.
    (But not JAX JIT-compilation.)
  * Suite of header-only C++ that does not depend on Awkward
    Arrays, but can be used to produce them and quickly get them
    from C++ to Python. The header-only suite includes
    GrowableBuffer and LayoutBuilder.
  * New documentation website (https://awkward-array.org/), based
    on JupyterBooks, the NumPy/SciPy/Pandas style and organization,
    as well as a notebook that can be executed in your web browser.
  * More expressive error-messages, highlighting the ak.* function
    that was in progress when the error occurred, with its
    arguments. (That is, highlighting ak.* functions as the
    granularity of feedback to users of Awkward Array, rather than
    making you search through the stack trace to the hand-off from
    your code to ours.)
  * Brackets are always balanced in the console representation of
    an array:

        >>> ak.Array([
        ...     [{"x": 1.1, "y": [1]}, {"x": 2.2, "y": [1, 2]}],
        ...     [],
        ...     [{"x": 3.3, "y": [1, 2, 3]}],
        ... ])
        <Array [[{x: 1.1, y: [1]}, {...}], ...] type='3 * var * {x: float64, y: var...'>
    
    as opposed to
    
        <Array [[{x: 1.1, y: [1]}, ... y: [1, 2, 3]}]] type='3 * var * {"x": float64, "y...'>
    
    in version 1. Also, show methods for values
    
        [[{x: 1.1, y: [1]}, {x: 2.2, y: [1, 2]}],
         [],
         [{x: 3.3, y: [1, 2, 3]}]]
    
    and types
    
        3 * var * {
            x: float64,
            y: var * int64
        }
    
    This extended show output is the default representation in Jupyter.
  * Round-trip fidelity in ak.to_arrow/ak.from_arrow: no Awkward
    Array metadata is lost. Same for ak.to_parquet/ak.from_parquet,
    to the extent that pyarrow can read and write Parquet.
  * Parquet column selection using wildcards.
  * Data exported with version 1 ak.to_buffers can be imported by
    version 2 ak.from_buffers, with custom buffer_keys.
  * The majority of version 1 tests have been ported to version 2,
    to ensure that the interface and functionality doesn't change,
    except where intended (e.g. organizing naming conventions).
  * Consistent handling of date-time and time-delta types (matches
    NumPy's system).
  * Improved ak.to_json/ak.from_json arguments (for converting
    non-JSON types NaN, infinity, complex numbers) and using a
    known JSONSchema to accelerate ak.from_json. Removed
    ambiguities about newline-delimited JSON (requires explicit
    argument).
  * The world's fastest Avro file reader in Python,
    ak.from_avro_file (uses AwkwardForth).
  * "nan" versions of NumPy functions, such as np.nansum,
    np.nanmean, np.nanstd.
  * Renamed ak.to_pandas → ak.to_dataframe, to clarify distinction
    from awkward-pandas.
  * Organized Type and Form objects better, more consistent.
  * Clear specification of NumPy dtypes that can be used in Awkward
    Arrays (bool, numbers, including complex, and
    date-time/time-delta).
  * Organized naming conventions throughout the codebase, such as
    keys versus fields versus recordlookup.
  * Carefully examined the public API (all modules, functions,
    classes, and methods that don't start with an underscore) to be
    sure that we can support it going forward. Any removal or
    change of an interface will require a minor version number
    increase and a deprecation cycle, on the order of months. (New
    features and bug-fixes can be immediate, on patch releases.)
  * Flags and "configuration" function arguments are now
    keyword-only (order independent).
  * Started adding Python type hints (nowhere near complete, but
    started).
  * Removed the Identities from array nodes. They were never fully
    implemented—a placeholder for a feature that won't be developed
    within Awkward Array (SQL-style JOINs).
  * TypeTracerArray does a "dry run" of a calculation to predict
    its type at the end. Used to build a computation graph for
    dask-awkward.
  * Equivalent but ungainly type combinations, such as "option-type
    of option-type of X" or "union-type containing union-types,"
    have been outlawed with tools to squash them into a canonical
    layout. Operations on the data now have fewer possibilities to
    worry about.
  * Simplified the semantics of nbytes.
  * Clarified ak.ravel and ak.flatten's treatments of missing data.
  * Added missing ArrayBuilder methods in Numba.
  * Set up framework for performing ak.* operations in CUDA, using
    CuPy JIT-compilation to get the right interface, with error
    message passing through asynchronous GPU computations. The CUDA
    implementation is not complete, but the groundwork has been
    laid.
  * Parquet reading/writing uses fsspec for remote connections and
    handles the dataset protocol correctly.
  * Public interface to our power-tools: ak.transform unifies our
    internal recursively_apply and broadcast_and_apply.
  * All ak.* functions were rewritten; some were redesigned in a
    simpler way using the above-mentioned power tools. There are
    likely fewer undiscovered bugs in these functions now.
  * Use of records in numerical functions is more restricted, to
    prevent misapplication of ufuncs like + and reducers like
    np.sum on meaningful records such as Vectors.
  * All docstrings updated for version 2, including the code
    examples.

Sat Jul  3 00:39:43 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  * Long list of changes since last packaged version, see
    https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/changelog.html.
- Adapt symlinks and file-list for changes to shared object
  locations (directly in python_sitearch instead of
  python_sitearch/awkward/).
- Skip a test on 32-bit that uses float128, since float32 is not
  available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 21 14:25:27 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.1.2
  * The fix that motivates this patch release is @henryiii’s repair
    of the SDist distribution: PR #720. The addition of dlpack
    wasn’t included in the source distribution, so pip install
    awkward without an available wheel was failing due to not
    having all the headers it needed to compile.
  * Also fixed jagged slices: issue #723, PRs #725 and #729, as
    well as a segfault in ak.flatten: issue #724, PR #726.
- Release 1.1.1
  * New patch release motivated by a bug discovered in Uproot’s
    tests: PR #719. (From now on, Uproot will test Awkward release
    candidates.)
  * Also, #717 adds an optional behavior argument to every function
    that takes a highlevel=True/False.
  * Also from now on, only critical bug-fixes (like this one) will
    be patch releases and other updates will all go into release
    candidates for the next non-patch release (e.g. 1.2.0,
    [scheduled for 2021-04-01](https://github.com/scikit-hep/
    awkward-1.0#roadmap)).
- Release 1.1.0
  * Updates to Arrow 3.0. PR #709.
  * Can now read and write Parquet datasets (conventions for sets
    of multiple files): PR #706, fixes #368 (old!).
  * Also, Python 2 can use ellipsis because we have pybind11 2.6
    now: PR #707, fixes #705.
  * remove deprecated features
  * Fixed #689, the dimension of arrays returned by empty slices:
    PR #691.
  * @ianna fixed tuple-building in ArrayBuilder to guard against
    specifying a nonexistent slot and segfaulting: #697.
  * Added [ak.materialized](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/
    en/latest/_auto/ak.materialized.html) to force-materialize
    arrays (opposite of [ak.virtual](https://awkward-array.
    readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.virtual.html)) because
    debugging very lazy deferments is hard.
  * Can now use np.newaxis to give one array the same number of
    dimensions as another for slicing (which closes #492).
  * Fixed ak.min/ak.max with axis != None for partitioned data.
  * Fixed a bug that affected boolean-masking of partitioned data.
  * Reducing over-materialization of virtual arrays: PRs #643,
    #644, #657, added Form-aware lazy Parquet: #688
  * Fixed ak.from_buffers to allow unreachable elements: PR #673
  * Developed the AwkwardForth VM: PRs #683, #648, #653, #661,
    #664, #672
  * Removed right-broadcasting from all operations except those
    that require it for NumPy compliance: #656, #680
  * @ianna improved sorting: PRs #639, #687, added complex numbers
    support: PRs #652
  * @trickarcher generalized CuPy interop to JAX: PRs #645, #662
  * @reikdas cleaned up developer scripts: PRs #665, #666, #667
  * @henryiii added more code quality tests: PRs #675, #681, #682,
    #677, #676, #685, #683
- Somehow the missing python-devel BuildRequires was okay until
  recently.

- Update to 1.0.2
  * @nsmith- fixed virtual arrays in ak.to_arrow (PR #642).
  * Fixed #628, allowing np.int64(N) to be used in a slice like
    integer N (PR #636).
  * Added the ability to select fields inside of nested 
    records with syntax like array[[“pt”, “eta”, “phi”], 
    “nominal”] (#619).
  * Fixed Apache Arrow → Awkward Array (ak.from_arrow) for 
    sliced Arrow arrays: it has an offset attribute we had 
    been ignoring (#625). Thanks to @trickarcher for the 
    extensive tests!
  * Ensured that an ak.Array’s behavior always gets passed to 
    output of any operation (#626), even if the input is a 
    dict (#627, affected ak.zip, ak.cartesian, and 
    ak.argcartesian).
  * Fixed #629, ak.with_field dropping parameters (#631), 
    and #634, ak.fill_none not accepting a Record as a fill 
    value (#635).
  * Added a roadmap and upvote/thumbs up instructions to the 
    README.
  * @jpivarski revised the ak.concatenate implementation 
    (#610), fixed a bug related to axis handling (#612), and 
    made ak.concatenate friendlier to lazy arrays (#613; 
    “friendlier” = “materializes arrays in fewer cases”).
  * @chrisburr added setuptools as a requirement because it 
    is used for pkg_resources.
  * @ianna added validity-checking for strings, bytestrings, 
    and categorical (#571), including some revisions of 
    sorting and a partial implementation of checking for 
    uniqueness and identifying unique elements from arrays 
    that can later be used to implement np.unique.
  * Updated Awkward <–> Arrow conversion to preserve nullability 
    in type (PRs #602, #606). Preemptively avoiding warnings 
    from NumPy 1.20 (#599) and fixed 32-bit Linux cases in the 
    tests (#604).
  * @henryiii fixed hardcoded threads in MacOS compilation 
    target (for deploying to conda-forge).
- Drop awkward-tests-on-32bit.patch merged upstream

Wed Dec 16 00:13:41 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add awkward-tests-on-32bit.patch: Fix tests on 32 bit systems;
  patch taken from upstream PR [gh#scikit-hep/awkward-1.0#600].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 15 00:31:07 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Disable tests making use of 64 bit data types on i586
  (gh#scikit-hep#awkward-1.0#600).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 14 23:23:12 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Move header files to standard header dir and package them plus
  symlink to shared lib as part of awkward-devel package (for use
  by C/C++ coders).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 13 19:06:50 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add awkward-correct-includedir.patch: Make awkward.config return
  the correct includedir (/usr/include/awkward) where we move the
  header files to (default installation is to
  python_sitearch/awkward/include, which is non-std).
- Add awkward-cmake-build-with-RelWithDebInfo.patch: Set
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to RelWithDebInfo by default instead of
  Release.
