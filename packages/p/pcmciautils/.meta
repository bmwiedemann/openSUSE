  <title>Utilities for PC-Cards</title>
  <description>This package enables the usage of PC-Cards with Linux. It provides
hotplug scripts, and tools that set up sockets and cards. Since kernel
2.6.13 card injection and removal are handled completely via hotplug.
Therefore, a daemon like 'cardmgr' is no longer needed. Soft ejecting
and inserting cards can be done with pccardctl (it was cardctl before).
There are also some tools for debugging and CIS handling.</description>
