Sat Jan 28 14:33:56 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.4.3:
  * Fixed ValueError caused when passing `Cmd.columnize()` strings wider than
    `display_width`.
  * Renamed `utils.str_to_bool()` -> `utils.to_bool()`.
  * Enhanced `utils.to_bool()` so that it accepts and converts `bool`, `int`,
    and `float` in addition to `str`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 18 15:38:40 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.4.2
  * Updated argparse decorator to remove annotations when the
    docstring is used for a command's help text.
  * Updated unit test to be Python 3.11 compliant.
- Clean specfile, remove coverage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  4 15:00:50 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.4.1:
  * Fixed value for `ansi.Bg.YELLOW`.
  * Fixed unit tests for `ansi.allow_style`.
  * `async_alert()` raises a `RuntimeError` if called from the main thread.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  8 07:40:29 UTC 2022 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 2.4.0
    Bug Fixes
        Fixed issue in ansi.async_alert_str() which would raise IndexError if prompt was blank.
        Fixed issue where tab completion was quoting argparse flags in some cases.
    Enhancements
        Added broader exception handling when enabling clipboard functionality via pyperclip.
        Added PassThroughException to __init__.py imports.
        cmd2 now uses pyreadline3 when running any version of Python on Windows
        Improved memory usage in certain use cases of tables (e.g. nested colored tables)
    Deletions (potentially breaking changes)
        Deleted cmd2.fg and cmd2.bg which were deprecated in 2.3.0. Use cmd2.Fg and cmd2.Bg instead.
- python-mock is actually not required for build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 11 22:08:57 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.3.3:
  * Added clearer exception handling to `BorderedTable` and `SimpleTable`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  6 18:04:09 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.3.2:
  * Fixed issue where a `ns_provider` could be passed `None`
    instead of its correct `cmd2.Cmd` or `CommandSet` value.
  * Fixed issue introduced in 2.3.0 with `AlternatingTable`, `BorderedTable`, and `SimpleTable` that caused
    header alignment settings to be overridden by data alignment settings.
  * `CompletionItems` now saves the original object from which it creates a string.
  * Using `CompletionItems` as argparse choices is fully supported.
  * `ArgparseCompleter` now does the following if a list of `CompletionItems`
    was created with numerical types:
  * Fixed `AttributeError` in `rl_get_prompt()` when prompt is `None`.
  * Fixed bug where using choices on a Settable didn't verify that a valid choice had been entered.
  * Fixed bug introduced in cmd2 2.0.0 in which `select()` converts return values to strings.
  * Added settings to Column class which prevent a table from overriding existing styles in header
    and/or data text. This allows for things like nesting an AlternatingTable in another AlternatingTable.
  * AlternatingTable no longer automatically applies background color to borders. This was done to improve
    appearance since the background color extended beyond the borders of the table.
  * Added ability to colorize all aspects of `AlternatingTable`, `BorderedTable`, and `SimpleTable`.
  * Added support for 8-bit/256-colors with the `cmd2.EightBitFg` and `cmd2.EightBitBg` classes.
  * Added support for 24-bit/RGB colors with the `cmd2.RgbFg` and `cmd2.RgbBg` classes.
  * Removed dependency on colorama.
  * Changed type of `ansi.allow_style` from a string to an `ansi.AllowStyle` Enum class.
  * To support the color upgrade, all cmd2 colors now inherit from either `ansi.FgColor` or `ansi.BgColor`.
    Therefore, `ansi.style()` no longer accepts colors as strings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 16 21:48:02 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.2.0:
  * Fixed extra space appended to each alias by "alias list" command
  * New function `set_default_ap_completer_type()`
  * Added `ArgumentParser.get_ap_completer_type()` and 
    `ArgumentParser.set_ap_completer_type()`.
  * Added `ap_completer_type` keyword arg to `Cmd2ArgumentParser.__init__()`
    which saves a call to `set_ap_completer_type()`. This keyword will also
    work with `add_parser()` when creating subcommands if the base
    command's parser is a `Cmd2ArgumentParser`.
  * New function `register_argparse_argument_parameter()`
  * Using `SimpleTable` in the output for the following commands
  * Tab completion of `CompletionItems` now includes divider row
  * Removed `--verbose` flag from set command since descriptions always show now.
  * All cmd2 built-in commands now populate `self.last_result`.
  * Argparse tab completer will complete remaining flag names if there are no
    more positionals to complete.
  * Updated `async_alert()` to account for `self.prompt` not matching Readline's
    current prompt.
  * Deleted ``set_choices_provider()`` and ``set_completer()`` which were
    deprecated in 2.1.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 16 19:57:26 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.2:
  * Added the following accessor methods for cmd2-specific attributes to the `argparse.Action` class
      * `get_choices_callable()`
      * `set_choices_provider()`
      * `set_completer()`
      * `get_descriptive_header()`
      * `set_descriptive_header()`
      * `get_nargs_range()`
      * `set_nargs_range()`
      * `get_suppress_tab_hint()`
      * `set_suppress_tab_hint()`
  * Now that `set_choices_provider()` and `set_completer()` have been added as methods to the
    `argparse.Action` class, the standalone functions of the same name will be removed in version
    2.2.0. To update to the new convention, do the following:
      * Change `set_choices_provider(action, provider)` to `action.set_choices_provider(provider)`
      * Change `set_completer(action, completer)` to `action.set_completer(completer)`
  * Fixed handling of argparse's default options group name which was changed in Python 3.10
  * Restored `plugins` and `tests_isolated` directories to tarball published to PyPI for `cmd2` release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 14 15:58:07 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Udpate to version 2.1.0
  Enhancements
  * Converted persistent history files from pickle to compressed
    JSON.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  7 08:09:29 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.1
  Bug Fixes
  * Exclude plugins and tests_isolated directories from tarball
    published to PyPI for cmd2 release
- Update to version 2.0.0
  Bug Fixes
  * Fixed issue where history indexes could get repeated
  * Fixed issue where TableCreator was tossing blank last line
  * Corrected help text for alias command
  Breaking Changes
  * cmd2 2.0 supports Python 3.6+ (removed support for Python 3.5)
  * Argparse Completion / Settables
    + Replaced choices_function / choices_method with
      choices_provider.
    + Replaced completer_function / completer_method with completer.
    + ArgparseCompleter now always passes cmd2.Cmd or CommandSet
      instance as the first positional
    + argument to choices_provider and completer functions.
  * Moved basic_complete from utils into cmd2.Cmd class.
  * Moved CompletionError to exceptions.py
  * Namespace.__statement__ has been removed.
    Use Namespace.cmd2_statement.get() instead.
  * Removed --silent flag from alias/macro create since startup
    scripts can be run silently.
  * Removed --with_silent flag from alias/macro list since startup
    scripts can be run silently.
  * Removed with_argparser_and_unknown_args since it was deprecated
    in 1.3.0.
  * Renamed silent_startup_script to silence_startup_script for
    clarity.
  * Replaced cmd2.Cmd.completion_header with
    cmd2.Cmd.formatted_completions.
  * Settables now have new initialization parameters. It is now a
    required parameter to supply the reference to the object that
    holds the settable attribute. cmd2.Cmd.settables is no longer a
    public dict attribute - it is now a property that aggregates
    all Settables across all registered CommandSets.
  * Failed transcript testing now sets self.exit_code to 1 instead
    of -1.
  * Renamed use_ipython keyword parameter of cmd2.Cmd.__init__() to
    include_ipy.
  * ipy command is only enabled if include_py parameter is True.
  * Removed ability to run Python commands from the command line
    with py. Now py takes no arguments and just opens an
    interactive Python shell.
  * Changed default behavior of runcmds_plus_hooks() to not stop
    when Ctrl-C is pressed and instead run the next command in its
    list.
  * Removed cmd2.Cmd.quit_on_sigint flag, which when True, quit
    the application when Ctrl-C was pressed at the prompt.
  * The history bug fix resulted in structure changes to the
    classes in cmd2.history. Therefore, persistent history files
    created with versions older than 2.0.0 are not compatible.
  Enhancements
  * Added support for custom tab completion and up-arrow input
    history to cmd2.Cmd2.read_input.
  * Added cmd2.exceptions.PassThroughException to raise unhandled
    command exceptions instead of printing them.
  * Added support for ANSI styles and newlines in tab completion
    results using cmd2.Cmd.formatted_completions.
  * cmd2 provides this capability automatically if you return
    argparse completion matches as CompletionItems.
  * Settables enhancements:
    + Settables may be optionally scoped to a CommandSet.
    + Settables added to CommandSets will appear when a CommandSet
      is registered and disappear when a CommandSet is
      unregistered. Optionally, scoped Settables may have a
      prepended prefix.
    + Settables now allow changes to be applied to any arbitrary
      object attribute. It no longer needs to match an
    + attribute added to the cmd2 instance itself.
    + Raising SystemExit or calling sys.exit() in a command or hook
      function will set self.exit_code to the exit code used in
      those calls. It will also result in the command loop stopping.
    + ipy command now includes all of self.py_locals in the
      IPython environment
    + Added include_py keyword parameter to cmd2.Cmd.__init__().
      If False, then the py command will not be available. Defaults
      to False. run_pyscript is not affected by this parameter.
    + Made the amount of space between columns in a SimpleTable
      configurable On POSIX systems, shell commands and processes
      being piped to are now run in the user's preferred shell
      instead of /bin/sh. The preferred shell is obtained by
      reading the SHELL environment variable. If that doesn't
      exist or is empty, then /bin/sh is used.
    + Changed cmd2.Cmd._run_editor() to the public method
      cmd2.Cmd.run_editor()

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 25 13:46:11 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.5.0
  * Fixed bug where setting always_show_hint=True did not show a
    hint when completing Settables.
  * Fixed bug in editor detection logic on Linux systems that do
    not have which.
  * Fixed bug in table creator where column headers with tabs
    would result in an incorrect width calculation.
  * Fixed FileNotFoundError which occurred when running history
    --clear and no history file existed.
  * Added silent_startup_script option to cmd2.Cmd.__init__().
    If True, then the startup script's output will be suppressed.
    Anything written to stderr will still display.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  3 11:34:58 CET 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.9.22:
  - Fixed bug where a redefined ansi.style_error was not being
    used in all cmd2 files
  - Enabled line buffering when redirecting output to a file
  - Added align_left(), align_center(), and align_right() to
    utils.py. All 3 of these functions support ANSI escape
    sequences and characters with display widths greater than 1.
    They wrap align_text() which is also in utils.py.
  - Fixed bug where pipe processes were not being stopped by Ctrl-C
  - Added exception handling to account for non-standard Python
    environments in which readline is not loaded dynamically from
    a shared library file
  - Added read_input() function that is used to read from stdin.
    Unlike the Python built-in input(), it also has an argument
    to disable tab completion while input is being entered.
  - Added capability to override the argument parser class used
    by cmd2 built-in commands. See override_parser.py example for
    more details.
  - Added end argument to pfeedback() to be consistent with the
    other print functions like poutput().
  - Added apply_style to pwarning().
  - For consistency between all the print functions:
    - Made end and chop keyword-only arguments of ppaged()
    - end is always added to message in ppaged()

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 29 21:16:21 CEST 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- fix previous commit
- Update to 0.9.12:
  - Bug Fixes
        - Fixed a bug in how redirection and piping worked inside
          py or pyscript commands
        - Fixed bug in async_alert where it didn't account for
          prompts that contained newline characters
        - Fixed path completion case when CWD is just a slash.
          Relative path matches were incorrectly prepended with
          a slash.
  - Enhancements
        - Added ability to include command name placeholders in
          the message printed when trying to run a disabled
          command.
        - Added instance attributes to customize error messages
          without having to override methods. Theses messages can
          also be colored.
        - The with_argparser decorators now add the Statement
          object created when parsing the command line to the
          argparse.Namespace object they pass to the do_*
          methods. It is stored in an attribute called
          __statement__.
        - This can be useful if a command function needs to know
          the command line for things like logging.
        - Added a -t option to the load command for automatically
          generating a transcript based on a script file
        - When in a pyscript, the stdout and stderr streams of
          shell commands and processes being piped to are now
          captured and included in the CommandResult structure.
  - Potentially breaking changes
        - The following commands now write to stderr instead of
          stdout when printing an error. This will make catching
          errors easier in pyscript.
        - Removed *** from beginning of error messages printed by
          do_help() and default()
        - Significantly refactored cmd.Cmd class so that all
          class attributes got converted to instance attributes,
          also: self.pipe_proc is now called
          self.cur_pipe_proc_reader and is a ProcReader class.
        - Shell commands and commands being piped to while in
          a pyscript will function as if their output is going to
          a pipe and not a tty. This was necessary to be able to
          capture their output.

- Really run tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 28 11:43:56 UTC 2019 - Thomas Bechtold <tbechtold@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.10:
  * Fixed unit test that hangs on Windows
  * Fixed bug where the ``set`` command was not tab completing from the current ``settable`` dictionary.
  * Changed edit command to use do_shell() instead of calling os.system()
  * Fixed issue with echoing strings in StdSim. Because they were being sent to a binary buffer, line buffering
    was being ignored.
  * Made quit() and exit() functions available to scripts run with pyscript. This allows those scripts to exit
    back to the console's prompt instead of exiting the whole application.
  * Fixed bug when user chooses a zero or negative index when calling ``Cmd.select()``
  * Restored behavior where ``cmd_echo`` always starts as False in a py script. This was broken in 0.9.5.
  * **cmdloop** now only attempts to register a custom signal handler for SIGINT if running in the main thread
  * commands run as a result of ``default_to_shell`` being **True** now run via ``do_shell()`` and are saved
    to history.
  * Added more tab completion to pyscript command.
  * Deleted ``Cmd.colorize()`` and ``Cmd._colorcodes`` which were deprecated in 0.9.5
  * Replaced ``dir_exe_only`` and  ``dir_only`` flags in ``path_complete`` with optional ``path_filter`` function
    that is used to filter paths out of completion results.
  * ``perror()`` no longer prepends "ERROR: " to the error message being printed
  * Fixed bug introduced in 0.9.5 caused by backing up and restoring `self.prompt` in `pseudo_raw_input`.
    As part of this fix, continuation prompts will not be redrawn with `async_update_prompt` or `async_alert`.
  * All platforms now depend on [wcwidth](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wcwidth) to assist with asynchronous alerts.
  * Macros now accept extra arguments when called. These will be tacked onto the resolved command.
  * All cmd2 commands run via `py` now go through `onecmd_plus_hooks`.
  * Fixed bug where ``get_all_commands`` could return non-callable attributes
  * Fixed bug where **alias** command was dropping quotes around arguments
  * Fixed bug where running help on argparse commands didn't work if they didn't support -h
  * Fixed transcript testing bug where last command in transcript has no expected output
  * Fixed bugs with how AutoCompleter and ArgparseFunctor handle argparse
    arguments with nargs=argparse.REMAINDER. Tab completion now correctly
    matches how argparse will parse the values. Command strings generated by
    ArgparseFunctor should now be compliant with how argparse expects
    REMAINDER arguments to be ordered.
  * Fixed bugs with how AutoCompleter handles flag prefixes. It is no
    longer hard-coded to use '-' and will check against the prefix_chars in
    the argparse object. Also, single-character tokens that happen to be a
    prefix char are not treated as flags by argparse and AutoCompleter now
    matches that behavior.
  * Fixed bug where AutoCompleter was not distinguishing between a negative number and a flag 
  * Fixed bug where AutoCompleter did not handle -- the same way argparse does (all args after -- are non-options)  
  * Added ``exit_code`` attribute of ``cmd2.Cmd`` class
    * Enables applications to return a non-zero exit code when exiting from ``cmdloop``
  * ``ACHelpFormatter`` now inherits from ``argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter`` to make it easier
    for formatting help/description text
  * Aliases are now sorted alphabetically
  * The **set** command now tab-completes settable parameter names
  * Added ``async_alert``, ``async_update_prompt``, and ``set_window_title`` functions
      * These allow you to provide feedback to the user in an asychronous fashion, meaning alerts can
        display when the user is still entering text at the prompt.
  * Cross-platform colored output support
  * Deprecated the built-in ``cmd2`` support for colors including ``Cmd.colorize()`` and ``Cmd._colorcodes``
  * The ``preparse``, ``postparsing_precmd``, and ``postparsing_postcmd`` methods *deprecated* in the previous release 
    have been deleted
    * The new application lifecycle hook system allows for registration of callbacks to be called at various points
      in the lifecycle and is more powerful and flexible than the previous system
  * ``alias`` is now a command with sub-commands to create, list, and delete aliases. Therefore its syntax
    has changed. All current alias commands in startup scripts or transcripts will break with this release.
  * `unalias` was deleted since ``alias delete`` replaced it

        * ``pager`` defaults to **less -RXF** on POSIX and **more** on Windows
        * ``pager_chop`` defaults to **less -SRXF** on POSIX and **more** on Windows
    * Added ``chop`` argument to ``cmd2.Cmd.ppaged()`` method for displaying output using a pager
        * If ``chop`` is ``False``, then ``self.pager`` is used as the pager
        * Otherwise ``self.pager_chop`` is used as the pager
    * Greatly improved the [table_display.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/table_display.py) example
        * Now uses the new [tableformatter](https://github.com/python-tableformatter/tableformatter) module which looks better than ``tabulate``
  +  Deprecations
    * The ``CmdResult`` helper class is *deprecated* and replaced by the improved ``CommandResult`` class
        * ``CommandResult`` has the following attributes: **stdout**, **stderr**, and **data**
            * ``CmdResult`` had attributes of: **out**, **err**, **war**
        * ``CmdResult`` will be deleted in the next release
- Update to version 0.8.8
  +  Bug Fixes
    * Prevent crashes that could occur attempting to open a file in non-existent directory or with very long filename
  +  Enhancements
    * `display_matches` is no longer restricted to delimited strings
- Update to version 0.9.1
  +  Bug Fixes
    * fix packaging error for 0.8.x versions (yes we had to deploy a new version
      of the 0.9.x series to fix a packaging error with the 0.8.x version)
- Update to version 0.9.0
  +  Bug Fixes
    * If self.default_to_shell is true, then redirection and piping are now properly passed to the shell. Previously it was truncated.
    * Submenus now call all hooks, it used to just call precmd and postcmd.
  +  Enhancements
    * Automatic completion of ``argparse`` arguments via ``cmd2.argparse_completer.AutoCompleter``
        * See the [tab_autocompletion.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/tab_autocompletion.py) example for a demonstration of how to use this feature
    * ``cmd2`` no longer depends on the ``six`` module
    * ``cmd2`` is now a multi-file Python package instead of a single-file module
    * New pyscript approach that provides a pythonic interface to commands in the cmd2 application.
    * Switch command parsing from pyparsing to custom code which utilizes shlex.
        * The object passed to do_* methods has changed. It no longer is the pyparsing object, it's a new Statement object, which is a subclass of ``str``. The statement object has many attributes which give you access to various components of the parsed input. If you were using anything but the string in your do_* methods, this change will require you to update your code.
        * ``commentGrammers`` is no longer supported or available. Comments are C-style or python style.
        * Input redirection no longer supported. Use the load command instead.
        * ``multilineCommand`` attribute is ``now multiline_command``
        * ``identchars`` is now ignored. The standardlibrary cmd uses those characters to split the first "word" of the input, but cmd2 hasn't used those for a while, and the new parsing logic parses on whitespace, which has the added benefit of full unicode support, unlike cmd or prior versions of cmd2.
        * ``set_posix_shlex`` function and ``POSIX_SHLEX`` variable have been removed. Parsing behavior is now always the more forgiving ``posix=false``.
        * ``set_strip_quotes`` function and ``STRIP_QUOTES_FOR_NON_POSIX`` have been removed. Quotes are stripped from arguments when presented as a list (a la ``sys.argv``), and present when arguments are presented as a string (like the string passed to do_*).
  +  Changes
    * ``strip_ansi()`` and ``strip_quotes()`` functions have moved to new utils module
    * Several constants moved to new constants module
    * Submenu support has been moved to a new [cmd2-submenu](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2-submenu) plugin. If you use submenus, you will need to update your dependencies and modify your imports.
  +  Deletions (potentially breaking changes)
    * Deleted all ``optparse`` code which had previously been deprecated in release 0.8.0
        * The ``options`` decorator no longer exists
        * All ``cmd2`` code should be ported to use the new ``argparse``-based decorators
        * See the [Argument Processing](http://cmd2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/argument_processing.html) section of the documentation for more information on these decorators
        * Alternatively, see the [argparse_example.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/argparse_example.py)
    * Deleted ``cmd_with_subs_completer``, ``get_subcommands``, and ``get_subcommand_completer``
        * Replaced by default AutoCompleter implementation for all commands using argparse
    * Deleted support for old method of calling application commands with ``cmd()`` and ``self``
    * ``cmd2.redirector`` is no longer supported. Output redirection can only be done with '>' or '>>'
    * Deleted ``postparse()`` hook since it was redundant with ``postparsing_precmd``
  +  Python 2 no longer supported
    * ``cmd2`` now supports Python 3.4+
  +  Known Issues
    * Some developers have noted very slow performance when importing the ``cmd2`` module. The issue
    it intermittant, and investigation of the root cause is ongoing.
- Python2 is no longer supported upstream,
  so don't build it.

    * Fixed issue where completion display function was overwritten when a submenu quits
    * Fixed ``AttributeError`` on Windows when running a ``select`` command cause by **pyreadline** not implementing ``remove_history_item``
  * Bug Fixes
    * Fixed a bug with all argument decorators where the wrapped function wasn't returning a value and thus couldn't cause the cmd2 app to quit

    * Added warning about **libedit** variant of **readline** not being supported on macOS
    * Added tab-completion of alias names in value filed of **alias** command
    * Enhanced the ``py`` console in the following ways
        * Added tab completion of Python identifiers instead of **cmd2** commands
        * Separated the ``py`` console history from the **cmd2** history
    * Added support for verbose help with -v where it lists a brief summary of what each command does
    * Added support for categorizing commands into groups within the help menu
        * See the [Grouping Commands](http://cmd2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/argument_processing.html?highlight=verbose#grouping-commands) section of the docs for more info
        * See [help_categories.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/help_categories.py) for an example
    * Tab completion of paths now supports ~user user path expansion
    * Simplified implementation of various tab completion functions so they no longer require ``ctypes``
    * Expanded documentation of ``display_matches`` list to clarify its purpose. See cmd2.py for this documentation.
    * Adding opening quote to tab completion if any of the completion suggestions have a space.
    * Tab completion has been overhauled and now supports completion of strings with quotes and spaces.
    * Tab completion will automatically add an opening quote if a string with a space is completed.
    * Added ``delimiter_complete`` function for tab completing delimited strings
    * Added more control over tab completion behavior including the following flags. The use of these flags is documented in cmd2.py
        * ``allow_appended_space``
        * ``allow_closing_quote``
    * Due to the tab completion changes, non-Windows platforms now depend on [wcwidth](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wcwidth).
    * An alias name can now match a command name.
    * An alias can now resolve to another alias.

  * **Python 2 EOL notice**
    * This is the last release where new features will be added to ``cmd2`` for Python 2.7
    * The 0.9.0 release of ``cmd2`` will support Python 3.4+ only
    * Additional 0.8.x releases may be created to supply bug fixes for Python 2.7 up until August 31, 2018
    * After August 31, 2018 not even bug fixes will be provided for Python 2.7

    * Fixed conditional dependency issue in setup.py that was in 0.8.3.

    * Fixed not being able to use quoted paths when redirecting with ``<`` and ``>``

  * Enhancements
  * Attribute Changes (Breaks backward compatibility)
    * ``exclude_from_help`` is now called ``hidden_commands`` since these commands are hidden from things other than help, including tab completion
        * This list also no longer takes the function names of commands (``do_history``), but instead uses the command names themselves (``history``)
    * ``excludeFromHistory`` is now called ``exclude_from_history``
    * ``cmd_with_subs_completer()`` no longer takes an argument called ``base``. Adding tab completion to subcommands has been simplified to declaring it in the
    subcommand parser's default settings. This easily allows arbitrary completers like path_complete to be used.
    See [subcommands.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/subcommands.py) for an example of how to use
    tab completion in subcommands. In addition, the docstring for ``cmd_with_subs_completer()`` offers more details.

    * ``exclude_from_help`` and ``excludeFromHistory`` are now instance instead of class attributes
    * Added flag and index based tab completion helper functions
        * See [tab_completion.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/tab_completion.py)
    * Added support for displaying output which won't fit on the screen via a pager using ``ppaged()``
        * See [paged_output.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/paged_output.py)
* Attributes Removed (**can cause breaking changes**)
    * ``abbrev`` - Removed support for abbreviated commands
        * Good tab completion makes this unnecessary and its presence could cause harmful unintended actions

            * **do_*** commands get two arguments, the output of argparse.parse_known_args()
    *  See the [Argument Processing](http://cmd2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/argument_processing.html) section of the documentation for more information on these decorators
        * Alternatively, see the [argparse_example.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/argparse_example.py)
        and [arg_print.py](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/blob/master/examples/arg_print.py) examples
    * Added support for Argparse sub-commands when using the **with_argument_parser** or **with_argparser_and_unknown_args** decorators

    * The **run** command has been removed. The capability to run prior commands is now part of the **history** command.
* Other changes
    * The **edit** command no longer allows you to edit prior commands. The capability to edit prior commands is now part of the **history** command. The **edit** command still allows you to edit arbitrary files.
    * the **autorun_on_edit** setting has been removed.
    * For Python 3.4 and earlier, ``cmd2`` now has an additional dependency on the ``contextlib2`` module
* Deprecations
    * The old **options** decorator for optparse-based argument parsing is now *deprecated*
        * The old decorator is still present for now, but will be removed in a future release
