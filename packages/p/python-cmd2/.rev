    <comment>- convert to singlespec

  * Fixed argparse_example.py and pirate.py examples and transcript_regex.txt transcript
  * Fixed a bug in a unit test which occurred under unusual circumstances
  * Organized all attributes used to configure the ParserManager into a single location
  * Set the default value of `abbrev` to `False` (which controls whether or not abbreviated commands are allowed)
  * Improved implementation of `load` to use command queue instead of nested inner loop
  * Fixed a couple bugs in interacting with pastebuffer/clipboard on macOS and Linux
  * Fixed a couple bugs in edit and save commands if called when history is empty
  * Ability to pipe ``cmd2`` command output to a shell command is now more reliable, particularly on Windows
  * Fixed a bug in ``pyscript`` command on Windows related to ``\`` being interpreted as an escape
  * Ensure that path and shell command tab-completion results are alphabetically sorted
  * Removed feature for load command to load scripts from URLS
  * Removed presence of a default file name and default file extension
  * ``load`` command has better error checking and reporting
  * Clipboard copy and paste functionality is now handled by the **pyperclip** module
  * ``shell`` command now supports redirection and piping of output
  * Added a lot of unit tests
  * Removed pause command
  * Added a dependency on the **pyperclip** module
  * Fixed a bug in displaying a span of history items when only an end index is supplied
  * Fixed a bug which caused transcript test failures to display twice

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 0.7.9:
* Bug Fixes
    * Fixed a couple broken examples
* Enhancements
    * Improved documentation for modifying shortcuts (command aliases)
    * Made ``pyreadline`` a dependency on Windows to ensure tab-completion works
* Other changes
    * Abandoned official support for Python 3.3.  It should still work, just don't have an easy way to test it anymore.
* Bug Fixes
    * Fixed ``poutput()`` so it can print an integer zero and other **falsy** things
    * Fixed a bug which was causing autodoc to fail for building docs on Readthedocs
    * Fixed bug due to ``pyperclip`` dependency radically changing its project structure in latest version
* Enhancements
    * Improved documentation for user-settable environment parameters
    * Improved documentation for overriding the default supported comment styles
    * Added ``runcmds_plus_hooks()`` method to run multiple commands w/o a cmdloop
* Bug Fixes
    * Added workaround for bug which occurs in Python 2.7 on Linux when ``pygtk`` is installed
    * ``pfeedback()`` now honors feedback_to_output setting and won't redirect when it is ``False``
    * For ``edit`` command, both **editor** and **filename** can now have spaces in the name/path
    * Fixed a bug which occurred when stdin was a pipe instead of a tty due to input redirection
* Enhancements
    * ``feedback_to_output`` now defaults to ``False`` so info like command timing won't redirect
    * Transcript regular expressions now have predictable, tested, and documented behavior
        * This makes a breaking change to the format and expectations of transcript testing
        * The prior behavior removed whitespace before making the comparison, now whitespace must match exactly
        * Prior version did not allow regexes with whitespace, new version allows any regex
    * Improved display for ``load`` command and input redirection when **echo** is ``True``
* Bug Fixes
   * Case-sensitive command parsing was completely broken and has been fixed</comment>

    <time>1551686986</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 0.9.10:
  * Fixed unit test that hangs on Windows
  * Fixed bug where the ``set`` command was not tab completing from the current ``settable`` dictionary.
  * Changed edit command to use do_shell() instead of calling os.system()
  * Fixed issue with echoing strings in StdSim. Because they were being sent to a binary buffer, line buffering
    was being ignored.
  * Made quit() and exit() functions available to scripts run with pyscript. This allows those scripts to exit
    back to the console's prompt instead of exiting the whole application.
  * Fixed bug when user chooses a zero or negative index when calling ``Cmd.select()``
  * Restored behavior where ``cmd_echo`` always starts as False in a py script. This was broken in 0.9.5.
  * **cmdloop** now only attempts to register a custom signal handler for SIGINT if running in the main thread
  * commands run as a result of ``default_to_shell`` being **True** now run via ``do_shell()`` and are saved
    to history.
  * Added more tab completion to pyscript command.
  * Deleted ``Cmd.colorize()`` and ``Cmd._colorcodes`` which were deprecated in 0.9.5
  * Replaced ``dir_exe_only`` and  ``dir_only`` flags in ``path_complete`` with optional ``path_filter`` function
    that is used to filter paths out of completion results.
  * ``perror()`` no longer prepends &quot;ERROR: &quot; to the error message being printed
  * Fixed bug introduced in 0.9.5 caused by backing up and restoring `self.prompt` in `pseudo_raw_input`.
    As part of this fix, continuation prompts will not be redrawn with `async_update_prompt` or `async_alert`.
  * All platforms now depend on [wcwidth](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wcwidth) to assist with asynchronous alerts.
  * Macros now accept extra arguments when called. These will be tacked onto the resolved command.
  * All cmd2 commands run via `py` now go through `onecmd_plus_hooks`.
  * Fixed bug where ``get_all_commands`` could return non-callable attributes
  * Fixed bug where **alias** command was dropping quotes around arguments
  * Fixed bug where running help on argparse commands didn't work if they didn't support -h
  * Fixed transcript testing bug where last command in transcript has no expected output
  * Fixed bugs with how AutoCompleter and ArgparseFunctor handle argparse
    arguments with nargs=argparse.REMAINDER. Tab completion now correctly
    matches how argparse will parse the values. Command strings generated by</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- fix previous commit
- Update to 0.9.12:
  - Bug Fixes
        - Fixed a bug in how redirection and piping worked inside
          py or pyscript commands
        - Fixed bug in async_alert where it didn't account for
          prompts that contained newline characters
        - Fixed path completion case when CWD is just a slash.
          Relative path matches were incorrectly prepended with
          a slash.
  - Enhancements
        - Added ability to include command name placeholders in
          the message printed when trying to run a disabled
          command.
        - Added instance attributes to customize error messages
          without having to override methods. Theses messages can
          also be colored.
        - The with_argparser decorators now add the Statement
          object created when parsing the command line to the
          argparse.Namespace object they pass to the do_*
          methods. It is stored in an attribute called
          __statement__.
        - This can be useful if a command function needs to know
          the command line for things like logging.
        - Added a -t option to the load command for automatically
          generating a transcript based on a script file
        - When in a pyscript, the stdout and stderr streams of
          shell commands and processes being piped to are now
          captured and included in the CommandResult structure.
  - Potentially breaking changes
        - The following commands now write to stderr instead of
          stdout when printing an error. This will make catching
          errors easier in pyscript.
        - Removed *** from beginning of error messages printed by
          do_help() and default()
        - Significantly refactored cmd.Cmd class so that all
          class attributes got converted to instance attributes,
          also: self.pipe_proc is now called
          self.cur_pipe_proc_reader and is a ProcReader class.
        - Shell commands and commands being piped to while in
          a pyscript will function as if their output is going to
          a pipe and not a tty. This was necessary to be able to
          capture their output.
- fix build for SLE12 and older

    <comment>- Update to 0.9.22:
  - Fixed bug where a redefined ansi.style_error was not being
    used in all cmd2 files
  - Enabled line buffering when redirecting output to a file
  - Added align_left(), align_center(), and align_right() to
    utils.py. All 3 of these functions support ANSI escape
    sequences and characters with display widths greater than 1.
    They wrap align_text() which is also in utils.py.
  - Fixed bug where pipe processes were not being stopped by Ctrl-C
  - Added exception handling to account for non-standard Python
    environments in which readline is not loaded dynamically from
    a shared library file
  - Added read_input() function that is used to read from stdin.
    Unlike the Python built-in input(), it also has an argument
    to disable tab completion while input is being entered.
  - Added capability to override the argument parser class used
    by cmd2 built-in commands. See override_parser.py example for
    more details.
  - Added end argument to pfeedback() to be consistent with the
    other print functions like poutput().
  - Added apply_style to pwarning().
  - For consistency between all the print functions:
    - Made end and chop keyword-only arguments of ppaged()
    - end is always added to message in ppaged()</comment>

    <version>2.1.2</version>
    <time>1626887127</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 2.1.2:
  * Added the following accessor methods for cmd2-specific attributes to the `argparse.Action` class
      * `get_choices_callable()`
      * `set_choices_provider()`
      * `set_completer()`
      * `get_descriptive_header()`
      * `set_descriptive_header()`
      * `get_nargs_range()`
      * `set_nargs_range()`
      * `get_suppress_tab_hint()`
      * `set_suppress_tab_hint()`
  * Now that `set_choices_provider()` and `set_completer()` have been added as methods to the
    `argparse.Action` class, the standalone functions of the same name will be removed in version
    2.2.0. To update to the new convention, do the following:
      * Change `set_choices_provider(action, provider)` to `action.set_choices_provider(provider)`
      * Change `set_completer(action, completer)` to `action.set_completer(completer)`
  * Fixed handling of argparse's default options group name which was changed in Python 3.10
  * Restored `plugins` and `tests_isolated` directories to tarball published to PyPI for `cmd2` release</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 2.2.0:
  * Fixed extra space appended to each alias by &quot;alias list&quot; command
  * New function `set_default_ap_completer_type()`
  * Added `ArgumentParser.get_ap_completer_type()` and 
    `ArgumentParser.set_ap_completer_type()`.
  * Added `ap_completer_type` keyword arg to `Cmd2ArgumentParser.__init__()`
    which saves a call to `set_ap_completer_type()`. This keyword will also
    work with `add_parser()` when creating subcommands if the base
    command's parser is a `Cmd2ArgumentParser`.
  * New function `register_argparse_argument_parameter()`
  * Using `SimpleTable` in the output for the following commands
  * Tab completion of `CompletionItems` now includes divider row
  * Removed `--verbose` flag from set command since descriptions always show now.
  * All cmd2 built-in commands now populate `self.last_result`.
  * Argparse tab completer will complete remaining flag names if there are no
    more positionals to complete.
  * Updated `async_alert()` to account for `self.prompt` not matching Readline's
    current prompt.
  * Deleted ``set_choices_provider()`` and ``set_completer()`` which were
    deprecated in 2.1.2</comment>

    <version>2.3.2</version>
    <time>1639075517</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 2.3.2:
  * Fixed issue where a `ns_provider` could be passed `None`
    instead of its correct `cmd2.Cmd` or `CommandSet` value.
  * Fixed issue introduced in 2.3.0 with `AlternatingTable`, `BorderedTable`, and `SimpleTable` that caused
    header alignment settings to be overridden by data alignment settings.
  * `CompletionItems` now saves the original object from which it creates a string.
  * Using `CompletionItems` as argparse choices is fully supported.
  * `ArgparseCompleter` now does the following if a list of `CompletionItems`
    was created with numerical types:
  * Fixed `AttributeError` in `rl_get_prompt()` when prompt is `None`.
  * Fixed bug where using choices on a Settable didn't verify that a valid choice had been entered.
  * Fixed bug introduced in cmd2 2.0.0 in which `select()` converts return values to strings.
  * Added settings to Column class which prevent a table from overriding existing styles in header
    and/or data text. This allows for things like nesting an AlternatingTable in another AlternatingTable.
  * AlternatingTable no longer automatically applies background color to borders. This was done to improve
    appearance since the background color extended beyond the borders of the table.
  * Added ability to colorize all aspects of `AlternatingTable`, `BorderedTable`, and `SimpleTable`.
  * Added support for 8-bit/256-colors with the `cmd2.EightBitFg` and `cmd2.EightBitBg` classes.
  * Added support for 24-bit/RGB colors with the `cmd2.RgbFg` and `cmd2.RgbBg` classes.
  * Removed dependency on colorama.
  * Changed type of `ansi.allow_style` from a string to an `ansi.AllowStyle` Enum class.
  * To support the color upgrade, all cmd2 colors now inherit from either `ansi.FgColor` or `ansi.BgColor`.
    Therefore, `ansi.style()` no longer accepts colors as strings.</comment>

    `display_width`.
  * Renamed `utils.str_to_bool()` -&gt; `utils.to_bool()`.
  * Enhanced `utils.to_bool()` so that it accepts and converts `bool`, `int`,
    and `float` in addition to `str`.</comment>
