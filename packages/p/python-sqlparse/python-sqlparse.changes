Mon Feb 24 10:02:41 UTC 2025 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.5.3:
  * EXTENSION is now recognized as a keyword (issue785).
  * SQL hints are not removed when removing comments (issue262,
    by skryzh).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 19 07:42:50 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.5.1:
  * New "compact" option for formatter. If set, the formatter
    tries to produce a more compact output by avoiding some line
    breaks
  * The strip comments filter was a bit greedy and removed too
    much whitespace (issue772). Note: In some cases you might want
    to add `strip_whitespace=True` where you previously used just
    `strip_comments=True`.  `strip_comments` did some of the
    work that `strip_whitespace` should do.
  * Fix error when splitting statements that contain multiple
    CASE clauses within a BEGIN block (issue784).
  * Fix whitespace removal with nested expressions (issue782).
  * Fix parsing and formatting of ORDER clauses containing NULLS
    FIRST or NULLS LAST (issue532).

Thu May 25 16:21:05 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.4.4:
  * IMPORTANT: This release fixes a security vulnerability in
    the parser where a regular expression vulnerable to ReDOS
    (Regular Expression Denial of Service) was used. See the
    security advisory for details (CVE-2023-30608, bsc#1210617,
    https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-rrm6-wvj7-cwh2)
    The vulnerability was discovered by @erik-krogh from GitHub
    Security Lab (GHSL). Thanks for reporting!
  * Revert a change from 0.4.0 that changed IN to be a comparison
    (issue694).  The primary expectation is that IN is treated as
    a keyword and not as a comparison operator. That also follows
    the definition of reserved keywords for the major SQL syntax
    definitions.
  * Fix regular expressions for string parsing.
  * sqlparse now uses pyproject.toml instead of setup.cfg
    (issue685).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Handle backtick as valid quote char.
  * Allow any unicode character as valid identifier name.

    comments filter.

  * Add CONFLICT and ON_ERROR_STOP keywords.
  * Fix parsing of backticks (issue588).
  * Fix parsing of scientific number (issue399).

Thu Jan 28 08:27:49 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Disable building a python2 flavor so we can build the package
  for Leap/SLE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 26 08:42:20 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.1:
  * Python 3.9 support
  * Remove support for end-of-life Python 2.7 and 3.4. Python 3.5+ is now
  required.
  * Remaining strings that only consist of whitespaces are not treated as
  statements anymore. Code that ignored the last element from
  sqlparse.split() should be updated accordingly since that function
  now doesn't return an empty string as the last element in some
  cases (issue496).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 24 02:45:39 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

    doesn't seem to be widely used (issue476).
  * Restrict detection of alias names to objects that acutally could
    have an alias (issue455, adopted some parts of pr509 by john-bodley).
