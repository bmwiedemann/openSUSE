            - prereqs lowered from required to suggested:
              - CPAN::Meta::Check
              - CPAN::Meta::Requirements
            - tests are now quieter to avoid causing confusion, by suppressing
              the printing of stderr in tests

            - remove diagnostics accidentally left in new test
  
  0.023     2015-12-22 06:44:24Z
            - properly handle propagating warnings to previously declared
              handlers that are not coderefs (i.e. a sub name, or the magic
              DEFAULT and IGNORE)
  
  0.022     2015-12-19 00:32:42Z
            - propagate all warnings to any previously-declared __WARN__
              handlers (unlike with __DIE__, merely calling warn() is not
              sufficient)

            - add a x_breaks entry for conflicting versions of File::pushd which
              inadvertently call our exported warnings() rather than invoking
              warnings.pm, and documented this undesired interaction
  
  0.020     2015-01-03 20:32:21Z
            - re-release to fix problematic $VERSION declaration (RT#101239)
  
  0.019     2014-12-18 20:07:02Z
            - fix test to allow for special characters (e.g. MSWin32 file
              separators) in filenames (A. Sinan Unur, PR#7)
  
  0.018     2014-12-17 18:17:30Z
            - fix test to not depend on message formatting changes in newer Carp
  
  0.017     2014-12-16 20:17:22Z
            - handle other warning handlers passing us partial warning messages
              by re-adding the source file and line number

- updated to 0.016
           - fix prereq problem with last release - now no longer testing the
             example scripts for user installs
 
 0.015     2014-06-20 03:36:33Z
           - adjusted packaging and tests to become perl-5.6 friendly,
             including only using core or dual-lifed prerequisites
 
 0.014     2014-03-01 22:08:26Z
           - fix test that was failing when FOO or BAR environment variables
             were set (RT#93447)
 
 0.013     2013-12-14 21:26:06Z
           - update configure_requires checking in Makefile.PL

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 25 07:38:08 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.012
       - re-release to fix t/00-report-prereqs.t use of
         CPAN::Meta::Requirements
       - unnecessary tests removed; CONTRIBUTING file added

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  4 09:14:24 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.010
        - re-release with fixed compile test
        - fixed error in synopsis (we do not export anything by default)
        - a caveat added to the documentation regarding embedding warning
          checks inside another sub (this is for you, ribasushi!!!)
        - ':no_end_test' now also covers side effects of done_testing, as
          well as END blocks, making it possible to use the warning(s) subs
          without having an end warning test while using done_testing
          (necessary when combining with the 'if' pragma)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  5 13:17:56 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- fix usage of Module::Build::Tiny

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- updated to 0.008
          - compile test updated, to hopefully fix mswin32 parsing issues
          - fix subtest tests to work on Test::More before 0.95_01
            (RT#86802)
          - remove use of Class::Method::Modifiers
          - new feature: warnings { code } and warning { code }, for capturing
            the contents of warnings for subsequent testing
