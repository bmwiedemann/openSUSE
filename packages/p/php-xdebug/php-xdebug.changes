- Updated to Xdebug 3.0.0
  * Xdebug 3 includes major changes in functionality compared to Xdebug 2.
    The primary way how you turn on functionality is through the new
    xdebug.mode PHP configuration setting. This made it possible to
    massively increase performance in many of Xdebug's sub systems as
    Xdebug is now much more conservative in which hooks are enabled.

    Configuration changes, massive performance improvements, and PHP 8
    support are the primary features in Xdebug 3, but there is much more.
    The upgrade guide lists the changes in great detail, please read it:
