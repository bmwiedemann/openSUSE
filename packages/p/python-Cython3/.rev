- Update to 3.0.0~b2
  # Features added
  * C++ declarations for &lt;cmath&gt;, &lt;numbers&gt; and std::any were
    added. Patches by Jonathan Helgert and Maximilien Colange.
    (Github issues #5262, #5309, #5314)
  # Bugs fixed
  * Unintended internal exception handling lead to a visible
    performance regression for nogil memoryview code in 3.0.0b1.
    (Github issue #5324)
  * None default arguments for arguments with fused memoryview
    types could select a different implementation in 3.0 than in
    0.29.x. The selection behaviour is generally considered
    suboptimal but was at least reverted to the old behaviour for
    now. (Github issue #5297)
  * The new complex vs. floating point behaviour of the ** power
    operator accidentally added a dependency on the GIL, which was
    really only required on failures. (Github issue #5287)
  * from cython cimport … as … could lead to imported names not
    being found in annotations. Patch by Chia-Hsiang Cheng. (Github
    issue #5235)
  * Generated NumPy ufuncs could crash for large arrays due to
    incorrect GIL handling. (Github issue #5328)
  * Very long Python integer constants could exceed the maximum C
    name length of MSVC. Patch by 0dminnimda. (Github issue #5290)
  * cimport_from_pyx could miss some declarations. Patch by
    Chia-Hsiang Cheng. (Github issue #5318)
  * Fully qualified C++ names prefixed by a cimported module name
    could fail to compile. Patch by Chia-Hsiang Cheng. (Github</comment>
