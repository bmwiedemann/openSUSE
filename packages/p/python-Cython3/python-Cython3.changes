-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  2 11:51:50 UTC 2022 - Otto Hollmann <otto.hollmann@suse.com>

- Update to 0.29.32:
  - Bugs fixed:
    * Revert "Using memoryview typed arguments in inner functions is now
      rejected as unsupported."
    * from module import * failed in 0.29.31 when using memoryviews
- Changes from 0.29.31:
  - Features added:
    * A new argument --module-name was added to the cython command to provide
      the (one) exact target module name from the command line.
  - Bugs fixed:
    * Use importlib.util.find_spec() instead of the deprecated
      importlib.find_loader() function when setting up the package path at
      import-time.
    * Require the C compiler to support the two-arg form of va_start on
      Python 3.10 and higher.
    * Make fused_type subscriptable in Shadow.py.
    * Fix the incorrect code generation of the target type in bytearray loops.
    * Atomic refcounts for memoryviews were not used on some GCC versions by
      accident.
    * Silence some GCC -Wconversion warnings in C utility code.
    * Tuple multiplication was ignored in expressions such as [*(1,) * 2].
    * Calling append methods on extension types could fail to find the method in
      some cases.
    * Ensure that object buffers (e.g. ndarray[object, ndim=1]) containing NULL
      pointers are safe to use, returning None instead of the NULL pointer.
    * Using memoryview typed arguments in inner functions is now rejected as
      unsupported.
    * Compilation could fail on systems (e.g. FIPS) that block MD5 checksums at
      runtime.
    * Experimental adaptations for the CPython "nogil" fork was added. Note that
      there is no official support for this in Cython 0.x.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 18 08:35:39 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- update to 0.29.30:
  * Avoid acquiring the GIL at the end of nogil functions. This change
    was backported in order to avoid generating wrong C code that
    would trigger C compiler warnings with tracing support enabled. 
  * Function definitions in finally: clauses were not correctly generated.
  * A case where C-API functions could be called with a live exception
    set was fixed.
  * Cython now correctly generates Python methods for both the provided
    regular and reversed special numeric methods of extension types.
  * The C union type in pure Python mode mishandled some field names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 20 20:33:02 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.29.28:
  * Due to backwards incompatible changes in CPython 3.11a4, the feature flags
    ``CYTHON_FAST_THREAD_STATE`` and ``CYTHON_USE_EXC_INFO_STACK`` are now disabled
    in Python 3.11 and later.  They are enabled again in Cython 3.0.
    Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #4610)
  * A C compiler warning in older PyPy versions was resolved.
    Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue #4236)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  2 17:54:50 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Make the running the test suite conditional (default
  off). Seven hours of running it is just too much.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Enable running of the test suite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 13:46:21 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- update to 0.29.27:
  * The ``cythonize`` command has a new option ``-M`` to generate ``.dep`` dependency
    files for the compilation unit.  This can be used by external build tools to track
    these dependencies.
  * Calls to ``range()`` with more than three arguments did not fail.
  * Some C compiler warnings about missing type struct initialisers in Py3.10 were resolved.
  * Cython no longer warns about using OpenMP 3.0 features since they are now
    considered generally available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 15:59:48 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

    initialisation was resolved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  6 20:16:04 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.29.25:
  * Several incompatibilities with CPython 3.11 were resolved.
  * Some C compiler warnings were resolved.
  * C++ ``std::move()`` should only be used automatically in MSVC versions that support it.
  * The ``Py_hash_t`` type failed to accept arbitrary "index" values.
  * Avoid copying unaligned 16-bit values since some platforms require them to be aligned.
    Use memcpy() instead to let the C compiler decide how to do it.
  * Cython crashed on invalid truthiness tests on C++ types without ``operator bool``.
  * The declaration of ``PyUnicode_CompareWithASCIIString()`` in ``cpython.unicode`` was incorrect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 14 08:28:08 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 0.29.24:
  * Inline functions in pxd files that used memory views could lead to invalid
    C code if the module that imported from them does not use memory views.
  * Several declarations in ``libcpp.string`` were added and corrected.
  * Pickling unbound Cython compiled methods failed.
  * The tracing code was adapted to work with CPython 3.10.
  * The optimised ``in`` operator failed on unicode strings in Py3.9 and later
    that were constructed from an external ``wchar_t`` source.
    Also, related C compiler warnings about deprecated C-API usage were resolved.
  * Some compiler crashes were resolved.
  * An incorrect warning about 'unused' generator expressions was removed.
  * The attributes ``gen.gi_frame`` and ``coro.cr_frame`` of Cython compiled
    generators and coroutines now return an actual frame object for introspection,
    instead of ``None``.

    dict to leak into keyword arguments passed into a function.
    Patch by Peng Weikang.  (Github issue #3227)
  * Multiplied str constants could end up as bytes constants with language_level=2.
    Patch by Alphadelta14 and David Woods.  (Github issue #3951)
  * ``PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN`` does not get defined any more if it is already defined.
    Patch by Andrew Jones.  (Github issue #4104)

    Patch by Warren Weckesser.  (Github issue #3964)
  * Casts to memory views failed for fused dtypes.
    Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #3881)
  * ``repr()`` was assumed to return ``str`` instead of ``unicode``
    with ``language_level=3``
  * Calling ``cpdef`` functions from cimported modules crashed the compiler.
    Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #4000)
  * Cython no longer validates the ABI size of the NumPy classes
    it compiled against.
  * A C compiler warning about enum value casting was resolved in GCC.
    (Github issue #2749)
  * Coverage reporting in the annotated HTML file failed in Py3.9.
    Patch by Nick Pope.  (Github issue #3865)
  * The embedding code now reports Python errors as exit status.
  * Long type declarations could lead to (harmless) random changes in the
    C file when used in auto-generated Python wrappers or pickled classes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  8 22:36:13 UTC 2020 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- Update TO 0.29.21
 * Fix a regression in 0.29.20 where __div__ failed to be found in extension types
 * Fix a regression in 0.29.20 where a call inside of a finally clause could
    fail to compile
 * Zero-sized buffers could fail to validate as C/Fortran-contiguous.
 * exec() did not allow recent Python syntax features in Py3.8+
    due to https://bugs.python.org/issue35975
 * Binding staticmethods of Cython functions were not behaving like
    Python methods in Py3
 * Pythran calls to NumPy methods no longer generate useless method lookup code.
 * The PyUnicode_GET_LENGTH() macro was missing from the cpython.* declarations
 * The deprecated PyUnicode_*() C-API functions are no longer used, except
    for Unicode strings that contain lone surrogates. Unicode strings that
    contain non-BMP characters or surrogate pairs now generate different C
    code on 16-bit Python 2.x Unicode deployments (such as MS-Windows).
    Generating the C code on Python 3.x is recommended in this case
 * Some template parameters were missing from the C++ std::unordered_map declaration
 * Several internal code generation issues regarding temporary variables were resolved

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 11 06:30:55 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

  * Nested try-except statements with multiple return statements
    could crash due to incorrect deletion of the except as target variable.
  * The @classmethod decorator no longer rejects unknown input from other decorators.
  * Fused types could leak into unrelated usages. Patch by David Woods.
  * Now uses Py_SET_SIZE() and Py_SET_REFCNT() in Py3.9+ to avoid
    low-level write access to these object field
  * The built-in abs() function could lead to undefined behaviour when used on
    the negative-most value of a signed C integer type
  * Usages of sizeof() and typeid() on uninitialised variables no longer produce a warning
  * The C++ typeid() function was allowed in C mode
  * The error position reported for errors found in f-strings was misleading
  * The new c_api_binop_methods directive was added for forward compatibility,
    but can only be set to True (the current default value). It can be disabled in Cython 3.0


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 21 15:16:20 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 0.29.19
  * Exception position reporting could run into race conditions on threaded code.
    It now uses function-local variables again.

  * Error handling in cython.array creation was improved to avoid calling C-API
    functions with an error held.
  * A memory corruption was fixed when garbage collection was triggered during
    calls to PyType_Ready() of extension type subclasses. (Github issue #3603)
  * Memory view slicing generated unused error handling code which could negatively
    impact the C compiler optimisations for parallel OpenMP code etc.
    Also, it is now helped by static branch hints. (Github issue #2987)
  * Cython's built-in OpenMP functions were not translated inside of call arguments.
    Original patch by Celelibi and David Woods. (Github issue #3594)
  * Complex buffer item types of structs of arrays could fail to validate.
  * Decorators were not allowed on nested async def functions.

      Pilnáček. (Github issue #2638)
    + A struct field type in the cpython.array declarations was
      corrected. Patch by John Kirkham. (Github issue #2712)

Wed Oct 17 15:29:49 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 0.29:
  * Features added
    + PEP-489 multi-phase module initialisation has been enabled
      again. Module reloads in other subinterpreters raise an
      exception to prevent corruption of the static module state.
    + A set of mypy compatible PEP-484 declarations were added for
      Cython's C data types to integrate with static analysers in
      typed Python code. They are available in the Cython/Shadow.pyi
      module and describe the types in the special cython module that
      can be used for typing in Python code. Original patch by Julian
      Gethmann. (Github issue #1965)
    + Memoryviews are supported in PEP-484/526 style type
      declarations. (Github issue #2529)
    + @cython.nogil is supported as a C-function decorator in Python
      code. (Github issue #2557)
    + Raising exceptions from nogil code will automatically acquire
      the GIL, instead of requiring an explicit with gil block.
    + C++ functions can now be declared as potentially raising both
      C++ and Python exceptions, so that Cython can handle both
      correctly. (Github issue #2615)
    + cython.inline() supports a direct language_level keyword
      argument that was previously only available via a directive.
    + A new language level name 3str was added that mostly corresponds
      to language level 3, but keeps unprefixed string literals as
      type 'str' in both Py2 and Py3, and the builtin 'str' type
      unchanged. This will become the default in the next Cython
      release and is meant to help user code a) transition more easily
      to this new default and b) migrate to Python 3 source code
      semantics without making support for Python 2.x difficult.
    + In CPython 3.6 and later, looking up globals in the module dict
      is almost as fast as looking up C globals. (Github issue #2313)
    + For a Python subclass of an extension type, repeated method
      calls to non-overridden cpdef methods can avoid the attribute
      lookup in Py3.6+, which makes them 4x faster. (Github issue
      #2313)
    + (In-)equality comparisons of objects to integer literals are
      faster. (Github issue #2188)
    + Some internal and 1-argument method calls are faster.
    + Modules that cimport many external extension types from other
      Cython modules execute less import requests during module
      initialisation.
    + Constant tuples and slices are deduplicated and only created
      once per module. (Github issue #2292)
    + The coverage plugin considers more C file extensions such as .cc
      and .cxx. (Github issue #2266)
    + The cythonize command accepts compile time variable values (as
      set by DEF) through the new -E option. Patch by Jerome
      Kieffer. (Github issue #2315)
    + pyximport can import from namespace packages. Patch by Prakhar
      Goel. (Github issue #2294)
    + Some missing numpy and CPython C-API declarations were
      added. Patch by John Kirkham. (Github issues #2523, #2520,
      #2537)
    + Declarations for the pylifecycle C-API functions were added in a
      new .pxd file cpython.pylifecycle.
    + The Pythran support was updated to work with the latest Pythran
      0.8.7. Original patch by Adrien Guinet. (Github issue #2600)
    + %a is included in the string formatting types that are optimised
       into f-strings. In this case, it is also automatically mapped
       to %r in Python 2.x.
    + New C macro CYTHON_HEX_VERSION to access Cython's version in the
      same style as PY_HEX_VERSION.
    + Constants in libc.math are now declared as const to simplify
      their handling.
    + An additional check_size clause was added to the ctypedef class
      name specification to allow suppressing warnings when importing
      modules with backwards-compatible PyTypeObject size
      changes. Patch by Matti Picus. (Github issue #2627)
  * Bugs fixed
    + The exception handling in generators and coroutines under
      CPython 3.7 was adapted to the newly introduced exception
      stack. Users of Cython 0.28 who want to support Python 3.7 are
      encouraged to upgrade to 0.29 to avoid potentially incorrect
      error reporting and tracebacks. (Github issue #1958)
    + Crash when importing a module under Stackless Python that was
      built for CPython. Patch by Anselm Kruis. (Github issue #2534)
    + 2-value slicing of typed sequences failed if the start or stop
      index was None. Patch by Christian Gibson. (Github issue #2508)
    + Multiplied string literals lost their factor when they are part
      of another constant expression (e.g. 'x' * 10 + 'y' => 'xy').
    + String formatting with the '%' operator didn't call the special
      __rmod__() method if the right side is a string subclass that
      implements it. (Python issue 28598)
    + The directive language_level=3 did not apply to the first token
      in the source file. (Github issue #2230)
    + Overriding cpdef methods did not work in Python subclasses with
      slots. Note that this can have a performance impact on calls
      from Cython code. (Github issue #1771)
    + Fix declarations of builtin or C types using strings in pure
      python mode. (Github issue #2046)
    + Generator expressions and lambdas failed to compile in @cfunc
      functions. (Github issue #459)
    + Global names with const types were not excluded from star-import
      assignments which could lead to invalid C code. (Github issue
      #2621)
    + Several internal function signatures were fixed that lead to
      warnings in gcc-8. (Github issue #2363)
    + The numpy helper functions set_array_base() and get_array_base()
      were adapted to the current numpy C-API recommendations. Patch
      by Matti Picus. (Github issue #2528)
    + Some NumPy related code was updated to avoid deprecated API
      usage. Original patch by jbrockmendel. (Github issue #2559)
    + Several C++ STL declarations were extended and corrected. Patch
      by Valentin Valls. (Github issue #2207)
    + C lines of the module init function were unconditionally not
      reported in exception stack traces. Patch by Jeroen
      Demeyer. (Github issue #2492)
    + When PEP-489 support is enabled, reloading the module overwrote
      any static module state. It now raises an exception instead,
      given that reloading is not actually supported.
    + Object-returning, C++ exception throwing functions were not
      checking that the return value was non-null. Original patch by
      Matt Wozniski (Github Issue #2603)
    + The source file encoding detection could get confused if the
      c_string_encoding directive appeared within the first two
      lines. (Github issue #2632)
    + Cython generated modules no longer emit a warning during import
      when the size of the NumPy array type is larger than what was
      found at compile time. Instead, this is assumed to be a
      backwards compatible change on NumPy side.
  * Other changes
    + Cython now emits a warning when no language_level (2, 3 or
      '3str') is set explicitly, neither as a cythonize() option nor
      as a compiler directive. This is meant to prepare the transition
      of the default language level from currently Py2 to Py3, since
      that is what most new users will expect these days. The future
      default will, however, not enforce unicode literals, because
      this has proven a major obstacle in the support for both Python
      2.x and 3.x. The next major release is intended to make this
      change, so that it will parse all code that does not request a
      specific language level as Python 3 code, but with str
      literals. The language level 2 will continue to be supported for
      an indefinite time.
    + The documentation was restructured, cleaned up and examples are
      now tested. The NumPy tutorial was also rewritten to simplify
      the running example. Contributed by Gabriel de
      Marmiesse. (Github issue #2245)
    + Cython compiles less of its own modules at build time to reduce
      the installed package size to about half of its previous
      size. This makes the compiler slightly slower, by about 5-7%.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 11 16:12:10 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.28.5:
  * The discouraged usage of GCC's attribute optimize("Os") was
    replaced by the similar attribute cold to reduce the code impact
    of the module init functions. (Github issue #2494)
  * A reference leak in Py2.x was fixed when comparing str to unicode
    for equality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 12 03:33:30 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.28.4:
  * Bugs fixed
    + Reallowing tp_clear() in a subtype of an @no_gc_clear extension
      type generated an invalid C function call to the (non-existent)
      base type implementation. (Github issue #2309)
    + Exception catching based on a non-literal (runtime) tuple could
      fail to match the exception. (Github issue #2425)
    + Compile fix for CPython 3.7.0a2. (Github issue #2477)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 27 16:30:35 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.28.3:
  * Set iteration was broken in non-CPython since 0.28.
  * UnicodeEncodeError in Py2 when %s formatting is optimised for
    unicode strings. (Github issue #2276)
  * Work around a crash bug in g++ 4.4.x by disabling the size
    reduction setting of the module init function in this
    version. (Github issue #2235)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 18 02:15:50 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Version update to 0.28.2
  + Features added
    * ``abs()`` is faster for Python long objects.
    * The C++11 methods ``front()`` and ``end()`` were added to the declaration of
      ``libcpp.string``.  Patch by Alex Huszagh.  (Github issue #2123)
    * The C++11 methods ``reserve()`` and ``bucket_count()`` are declared for
      ``std::unordered_map``.  Patch by Valentin Valls.  (Github issue #2168)
  + Bugs fixed
    * The copy of a read-only memoryview was considered read-only as well, whereas
      a common reason to copy a read-only view is to make it writable.  The result
      of the copying is now a writable buffer by default.
      (Github issue #2134)
    * The ``switch`` statement generation failed to apply recursively to the body of
      converted if-statements.
    * ``NULL`` was sometimes rejected as exception return value when the returned
      type is a fused pointer type.
      Patch by Callie LeFave.  (Github issue #2177)
    * Fixed compatibility with PyPy 5.11.
      Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue #2165)
  + Other changes
    * The NumPy tutorial was rewritten to use memoryviews instead of the older
      buffer declaration syntax.
      Contributed by Gabriel de Marmiesse.  (Github issue #2162)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 19 13:23:58 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 0.28.1:
  * PyFrozenSet_New() was accidentally used in PyPy where it is lacking
    from the C-API.
  * Assignment between some C++ templated types were incorrectly rejected
    when the templates mix const with ctypedef. (Github issue #2148)
  * Undeclared C++ no-args constructors in subclasses could make the
    compilation fail if the base class constructor was declared without
    nogil. (Github issue #2157)
  * Bytes %-formatting inferred basestring (bytes or unicode) as result type
    in some cases where bytes would have been safe to infer. (Github issue #2153)
  * None was accidentally disallowed as typed return value of dict.pop().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 17 00:30:56 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 0.28:
  * Features added
    + Cdef classes can now multiply inherit from ordinary Python
      classes. (The primary base must still be a c class, possibly
      object, and the other bases must not be cdef classes.)
    + Type inference is now supported for Pythran compiled NumPy
      expressions. Patch by Nils Braun. (Github issue #1954)
    + The const modifier can be applied to memoryview declarations to
      allow read-only buffers as input. (Github issues #1605, #1869)
    + C code in the docstring of a cdef extern block is copied
      verbatimly into the generated file. Patch by Jeroen
      Demeyer. (Github issue #1915)
    + When compiling with gcc, the module init function is now tuned
      for small code size instead of whatever compile flags were
      provided externally. Cython now also disables some code
      intensive optimisations in that function to further reduce the
      code size. (Github issue #2102)
    + Decorating an async coroutine with @cython.iterable_coroutine
      changes its type at compile time to make it iterable. While this
      is not strictly in line with PEP-492, it improves the
      interoperability with old-style coroutines that use yield from
      instead of await.
    + The IPython magic has preliminary support for
      JupyterLab. (Github issue #1775)
    + The new TSS C-API in CPython 3.7 is supported and has been
      backported. Patch by Naotoshi Seo. (Github issue #1932)
    + Cython knows the new Py_tss_t type defined in PEP-539 and
      automatically initialises variables declared with that type to
      Py_tss_NEEDS_INIT, a value which cannot be used outside of
      static assignments.
    + The set methods .remove() and .discard() are optimised. Patch by
      Antoine Pitrou. (Github issue #2042)
    + dict.pop() is optimised. Original patch by Antoine
      Pitrou. (Github issue #2047)
    + Iteration over sets and frozensets is optimised. (Github issue
      #2048)
    + Safe integer loops (< range(2^30)) are automatically optimised
      into C loops.
    + alist.extend([a,b,c]) is optimised into sequential list.append()
      calls for short literal sequences.
    + Calls to builtin methods that are not specifically optimised
      into C-API calls now use a cache that avoids repeated lookups of
      the underlying C function. (Github issue #2054)
    + Single argument function calls can avoid the argument tuple
      creation in some cases.
    + Some redundant extension type checks are avoided.
    + Formatting C enum values in f-strings is faster, as well as some
      other special cases.
    + String formatting with the '%' operator is optimised into
      f-strings in simple cases.
    + Subscripting (item access) is faster in some cases.
    + Some bytearray operations have been optimised similar to bytes.
    + Some PEP-484/526 container type declarations are now considered
      for loop optimisations.
    + Indexing into memoryview slices with view[i][j] is now optimised
      into view[i, j].
    + Python compatible cython.* types can now be mixed with type
      declarations in Cython syntax.
    + Name lookups in the module and in classes are faster.
    + Python attribute lookups on extension types without instance
      dict are faster.
    + Some missing signals were added to libc/signal.pxd. Patch by
      Jeroen Demeyer. (Github issue #1914)
    + The warning about repeated extern declarations is now visible by
      default. (Github issue #1874)
    + The exception handling of the function types used by CPython's
      type slot functions was corrected to match the de-facto standard
      behaviour, so that code that uses them directly benefits from
      automatic and correct exception propagation. Patch by Jeroen
      Demeyer. (Github issue #1980)
    + Defining the macro CYTHON_NO_PYINIT_EXPORT will prevent the
      module init function from being exported as symbol, e.g. when
      linking modules statically in an embedding setup. Patch by
      AraHaan. (Github issue #1944)
  * Bugs fixed
    + If a module name is explicitly provided for an Extension() that
      is compiled via cythonize(), it was previously ignored and
      replaced by the source file name. It can now be used to override
      the target module name, e.g. for compiling prefixed accelerator
      modules from Python files. (Github issue #2038)
    + The arguments of the num_threads parameter of parallel sections
      were not sufficiently validated and could lead to invalid C
      code. (Github issue #1957)
    + Catching exceptions with a non-trivial exception pattern could
      call into CPython with a live exception set. This triggered
      incorrect behaviour and crashes, especially in CPython 3.7.
    + The signature of the special __richcmp__() method was corrected
      to recognise the type of the first argument as self. It was
      previously treated as plain object, but CPython actually
      guarantees that it always has the correct type. Note: this can
      change the semantics of user code that previously relied on self
      being untyped.
    + Some Python 3 exceptions were not recognised as builtins when
      running Cython under Python 2.
    + Some async helper functions were not defined in the generated C
      code when compiling simple async code. (Github issue #2075)
    + Line tracing did not include generators and coroutines. (Github
      issue #1949)
    + C++ declarations for unordered_map were corrected. Patch by
      Michael Schatzow. (Github issue #1484)
    + Iterator declarations in C++ deque and vector were
      corrected. Patch by Alex Huszagh. (Github issue #1870)
    + The const modifiers in the C++ string declarations were
      corrected, together with the coercion behaviour of string
      literals into C++ strings. (Github issue #2132)
    + Some declaration types in libc.limits were corrected. Patch by
      Jeroen Demeyer. (Github issue #2016)
    + @cython.final was not accepted on Python classes with an
      @cython.cclass decorator. (Github issue #2040)
    + Cython no longer creates useless and incorrect PyInstanceMethod
      wrappers for methods in Python 3. Patch by Jeroen
      Demeyer. (Github issue #2105)
    + The builtin bytearray type could not be used as base type of
      cdef classes. (Github issue #2106)

- update to version 0.25:
  + Features added
    * def/cpdef methods of cdef classes benefit from Cython's internal function
      implementation, which enables introspection and line profiling for them.
      Implementation sponsored by Turbostream (www.turbostream-cfd.com).
    * The distutils extension ``Cython.Distutils.build_ext`` has now been updated
      to use cythonize which properly handles dependencies.  The old extension can
      still be found in ``Cython.Distutils.old_build_ext`` and is now deprecated.
    * Calls to Python functions are faster, following the recent "FastCall"
      optimisations that Victor Stinner implemented for CPython 3.6.
      See https://bugs.python.org/issue27128 and related issues.
    * The new METH_FASTCALL calling convention for PyCFunctions is supported
      in CPython 3.6.  See https://bugs.python.org/issue27810
    * C++ classes can now have typedef members. STL containers updated with
      value_type.
    * Support for bazel using a the pyx_library rule in //Tools:rules.bzl.
    * Initial support for using Cython modules in Pyston.  Patch by Daetalus.
    * Dynamic Python attributes are allowed on cdef classes if an attribute
      ``cdef dict __dict__`` is declared in the class.  Patch by empyrical.
    * Cython implemented C++ classes can make direct calls to base class methods.
      Patch by empyrical.
    * New directive ``cython.no_gc`` to fully disable GC for a cdef class.
      Patch by Claudio Freire.
    * Buffer variables are no longer excluded from ``locals()``.
      Patch by da-woods.
    * Building f-strings is faster, especially when formatting C integers.
    * for-loop iteration over "std::string".
    * ``libc/math.pxd`` provides ``e`` and ``pi`` as alias constants to simplify
      usage as a drop-in replacement for Python's math module.
    * Speed up cython.inline().
    * Binary lshift operations with small constant Python integers are faster.
    * Some integer operations on Python long objects are faster in Python 2.7.
    * Support for the C++ ``typeid`` operator.
  + Significant Bugs fixed
    * Division of complex numbers avoids overflow by using Smith's method.
    * Some function signatures in ``libc.math`` and ``numpy.pxd`` were incorrect.
      Pach by Michael Seifert.
  + Other changes
    * The "%%cython" IPython/jupyter magic now defaults to the language level of
      the current jupyter kernel.  The language level can be set explicitly with
      "%%cython -2" or "%%cython -3".
- update to version 0.24.1:
  * IPython cell magic was lacking a good way to enable Python 3 code
    semantics. It can now be used as "%%cython -3".
  * Follow a recent change in PEP 492 and CPython 3.5.1 that now
    requires the __aiter__() method of asynchronous iterators to be a
    simple def method instead of an async def method.
  * Coroutines and generators were lacking the __module__ special
    attribute.
  * C++ std::complex values failed to auto-convert from and to Python
    complex objects.
  * Namespaced C++ types could not be used as memory view types due to
    lack of name mangling. Patch by Ivan Smirnov.
  * Assignments between identical C++ types that were declared with
    differently typedefed template types could fail.
  * Rebuilds could fail to evaluate dependency timestamps in C++
    mode. Patch by Ian Henriksen.
  * Macros defined in the distutils compiler option do not require
    values anymore. Patch by Ian Henriksen.
  * Minor fixes for MSVC, Cygwin and PyPy.
- specfile:
  * changed to https for source url
  * updated source url to files.pythonhosted.org
- update to version 0.24:
  * Features added
    + PEP 498: Literal String Formatting (f-strings). Original patch
      by Jelle Zijlstra. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/
    + PEP 515: Underscores as visual separators in number
      literals. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/
    + Parser was adapted to some minor syntax changes in Py3.6,
      e.g. https://bugs.python.org/issue9232
    + The embedded C code comments that show the original source code
      can be discarded with the new directive
      emit_code_comments=False.
    + Cpdef enums are now first-class iterable, callable types in
      Python.
    + Ctuples can now be declared in pure Python code.
    + Posix declarations for DLL loading and stdio extensions were
      added. Patch by Lars Buitinck.
    + The Py2-only builtins unicode(), xrange(), reduce() and long are
      now also available in compile time DEF expressions when
      compiling with Py3.
    + Exception type tests have slightly lower overhead. This fixes
      ticket 868.
    + @property syntax fully supported in cdef classes, old syntax
      deprecated.
    + C++ classes can now be declared with default template
      parameters.
  * Bugs fixed
    + C++ exceptions raised by overloaded C++ operators were not
      always handled. Patch by Ian Henriksen.
    + C string literals were previously always stored as non-const
      global variables in the module. They are now stored as global
      constants when possible, and otherwise as non-const C string
      literals in the generated code that uses them. This improves
      compatibility with strict C compiler options and prevents
      non-const strings literals with the same content from being
      incorrectly merged.
    + Compile time evaluated str expressions (DEF) now behave in a
      more useful way by turning into Unicode strings when compiling
      under Python 3. This allows using them as intermediate values in
      expressions. Previously, they always evaluated to bytes objects.
    + isinf() declarations in libc/math.pxd and numpy/math.pxd now
      reflect the actual tristate int return value instead of using
      bint.
    + Literal assignments to ctuples avoid Python tuple round-trips in
      some more corner cases.
    + Iteration over dict(...).items() failed to get optimised when
      dict arguments included keyword arguments.
    + cProfile now correctly profiles cpdef functions and methods.
- update to version 0.23.5:
  * Compile errors and warnings in integer type conversion code. This
    fixes ticket 877. Patches by Christian Neukirchen, Nikolaus Rath,
    Ian Henriksen.
  * Reference leak when "*args" argument was reassigned in closures.
  * Truth-testing Unicode strings could waste time and memory in
    Py3.3+.
  * Return values of async functions could be ignored and replaced by
    None.
  * Compiler crash in CPython 3.6.
  * Fix prange() to behave identically to range(). The end condition
    was miscalculated when the range was not exactly divisible by the
    step.
  * Optimised all(genexpr)/any(genexpr) calls could warn about unused
    code. This fixes ticket 876.
- Remove unneeded python-Cython-c++11.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  1 10:30:06 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- update to version 0.23.4:
  * Memory leak when calling Python functions in PyPy.
  * Compilation problem with MSVC in C99-ish mode.
  * Warning about unused values in a helper macro.
- update to version 0.23.3:
  * Invalid C code for some builtin methods. This fixes ticket 856
    again.
  * Incorrect C code in helper functions for PyLong conversion and
    string decoding. This fixes ticket 863, ticket 864 and ticket
    865. Original patch by Nikolaus Rath.
  * Large folded or inserted integer constants could use too small C
    integer types and thus trigger a value wrap-around.
  * The coroutine and generator types of Cython now also register
    directly with the Coroutine and Generator ABCs in the
    backports_abc module if it can be imported. This fixes ticket 870.
- update to version 0.23.2:
  * Compiler crash when analysing some optimised expressions.
  * Coverage plugin was adapted to coverage.py 4.0 beta 2.
  * C++ destructor calls could fail when '&' operator is overwritten.
  * Incorrect C literal generation for large integers in compile-time
    evaluated DEF expressions and constant folded expressions.
  * Byte string constants could end up as Unicode strings when
    originating from compile-time evaluated DEF expressions.
  * Invalid C code when caching known builtin methods. This fixes
    ticket 860.
  * ino_t in posix.types was not declared as unsigned.
  * Declarations in libcpp/memory.pxd were missing operator!(). Patch
    by Leo Razoumov.
  * Static cdef methods can now be declared in .pxd files.
- update to version 0.23.1:
  * Invalid C code for generators. This fixes ticket 858.
  * Invalid C code for some builtin methods. This fixes ticket 856.
  * Invalid C code for unused local buffer variables. This fixes
    ticket 154.
  * Test failures on 32bit systems. This fixes ticket 857.
  * Code that uses "from xyz import *" and global C struct/union/array
    variables could fail to compile due to missing helper
    functions. This fixes ticket 851.
  * Misnamed PEP 492 coroutine property cr_yieldfrom renamed to
    cr_await to match CPython.
  * Missing deallocation code for C++ object attributes in certain
    extension class hierarchies.
  * Crash when async coroutine was not awaited.
  * Compiler crash on yield in signature annotations and default
    argument values. Both are forbidden now.
  * Compiler crash on certain constructs in finally clauses.
  * Cython failed to build when CPython's pgen is installed.
- update to version 0.23:
  * Features added
    + PEP 492 (async/await) was implemented. See
      https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/
    + PEP 448 (Additional Unpacking Generalizations) was
      implemented. See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/
    + Support for coverage.py 4.0+ can be enabled by adding the plugin
      "Cython.Coverage" to the ".coveragerc" config file.
    + Annotated HTML source pages can integrate (XML) coverage
      reports.
    + Tracing is supported in nogil functions/sections and module init
      code.
    + When generators are used in a Cython module and the module
      imports the modules "inspect" and/or "asyncio", Cython enables
      interoperability by patching these modules during the import to
      recognise Cython's internal generator and coroutine types. This
      can be disabled by C compiling the module with "-D
      CYTHON_PATCH_ASYNCIO=0" or "-D CYTHON_PATCH_INSPECT=0"
    + When generators or coroutines are used in a Cython module, their
      types are registered with the Generator and Coroutine ABCs in
      the collections or collections.abc stdlib module at import time
      to enable interoperability with code that needs to detect and
      process Python generators/coroutines. These ABCs were added in
      CPython 3.5 and are available for older Python versions through
      the backports_abc module on PyPI. See
      https://bugs.python.org/issue24018
    + Adding/subtracting/dividing/modulus and equality comparisons
      with constant Python floats and small integers are faster.
    + Binary and/or/xor/rshift operations with small constant Python
      integers are faster.
    + When called on generator expressions, the builtins all(), any(),
      dict(), list(), set(), sorted() and unicode.join() avoid the
      generator iteration overhead by inlining a part of their
      functionality into the for-loop.
    + Keyword argument dicts are no longer copied on function entry
      when they are not being used or only passed through to other
      function calls (e.g. in wrapper functions).
    + The PyTypeObject declaration in cpython.object was extended.
    + The builtin type type is now declared as PyTypeObject in source,
      allowing for extern functions taking type parameters to have the
      correct C signatures. Note that this might break code that uses
      type just for passing around Python types in typed
      variables. Removing the type declaration provides a backwards
      compatible fix.
    + wraparound() and boundscheck() are available as no-ops in pure
      Python mode.
    + Const iterators were added to the provided C++ STL declarations.
    + Smart pointers were added to the provided C++ STL
      declarations. Patch by Daniel Filonik.
    + NULL is allowed as default argument when embedding
      signatures. This fixes ticket 843.
    + When compiling with --embed, the internal module name is changed
      to __main__ to allow arbitrary program names, including those
      that would be invalid for modules. Note that this prevents reuse
      of the generated C code as an importable module.
    + External C++ classes that overload the assignment operator can
      be used. Patch by Ian Henriksen.
    + Support operator bool() for C++ classes so they can be used in
      if statements.
  * Bugs fixed
    + Calling "yield from" from Python on a Cython generator that
      returned a value triggered a crash in CPython. This is now being
      worked around. See https://bugs.python.org/issue23996
    + Language level 3 did not enable true division (a.k.a. float
      division) for integer operands.
    + Functions with fused argument types that included a generic
      'object' fallback could end up using that fallback also for
      other explicitly listed object types.
    + Relative cimports could accidentally fall back to trying an
      absolute cimport on failure.
    + The result of calling a C struct constructor no longer requires
      an intermediate assignment when coercing to a Python dict.
    + C++ exception declarations with mapping functions could fail to
      compile when pre-declared in .pxd files.
    + cpdef void methods are now permitted.
    + abs(cint) could fail to compile in MSVC and used sub-optimal
      code in C++. Patch by David Vierra, original patch by Michael
      Enßlin.
    + Buffer index calculations using index variables with small C
      integer types could overflow for large buffer sizes. Original
      patch by David Vierra.
    + C unions use a saner way to coerce from and to Python dicts.
    + When compiling a module foo.pyx, the directories in sys.path are
      no longer searched when looking for foo.pxd. Patch by Jeroen
      Demeyer.
    + Memory leaks in the embedding main function were fixed. Original
      patch by Michael Enßlin.
    + Some complex Python expressions could fail to compile inside of
      finally clauses.
    + Unprefixed 'str' literals were not supported as C varargs
      arguments.
    + Fixed type errors in conversion enum types to/from Python. Note
      that this imposes stricter correctness requirements on enum
      declarations.
  * Other changes
    + Changed mangling scheme in header files generated by cdef api
      declarations.
    + Installation under CPython 3.3+ no longer requires a pass of the
      2to3 tool. This also makes it possible to run Cython in Python
      3.3+ from a source checkout without installing it first. Patch
      by Petr Viktorin.
    + jedi-typer.py (in Tools/) was extended and renamed to
      jedityper.py (to make it importable) and now works with and
      requires Jedi 0.9. Patch by Tzer-jen Wei.

- Update to 0.22.1:
  Bugs fixed
  * Crash when returning values on generator termination.
  * In some cases, exceptions raised during internal isinstance()
    checks were not propagated.
  * Runtime reported file paths of source files (e.g for profiling
    and tracing) are now relative to the build root directory instead

- Update to 0.22:
  Features added
  * C functions can coerce to Python functions, which allows passing them
    around as callable objects.
  * C arrays can be assigned by value and auto-coerce from Python iterables
    and to Python lists (and tuples).
  * Extern C functions can now be declared as cpdef to export them to
    the module's Python namespace.  Extern C functions in pxd files export
    their values to their own module, iff it exists.
  * Anonymous C tuple types can be declared as (ctype1, ctype2, ...).
  * PEP 479: turn accidental StopIteration exceptions that exit generators
    into a RuntimeError, activated with future import "generator_stop".
    See http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/
  * Looping over ``reversed(range())`` is optimised in the same way as
    ``range()``.  Patch by Favian Contreras.
  Bugs fixed
  * Mismatching 'except' declarations on signatures in .pxd and .pyx files failed
    to produce a compile error.
  * Failure to find any files for the path pattern(s) passed into ``cythonize()``
    is now an error to more easily detect accidental typos.
  * The ``logaddexp`` family of functions in ``numpy.math`` now has correct
    declarations.
  * In Py2.6/7 and Py3.2, simple Cython memory views could accidentally be
    interpreted as non-contiguous by CPython, which could trigger a CPython
    bug when copying data from them, thus leading to data corruption.
    See CPython issues 12834 and 23349.
  Other changes
  * Preliminary support for defining the Cython language with a formal grammar.
    To try parsing your files against this grammar, use the --formal_grammar directive.
    Experimental.
  * ``_`` is no longer considered a cacheable builtin as it could interfere with
    gettext.
  * Cythonize-computed metadata now cached in the generated C files.

- Remove Cython-fix-version-detection.patch 
  (got fixed upstream)
- update to version 0.21.1:
  * Features added
    - New cythonize option -a to generate the annotated HTML source view.
    - Missing C-API declarations in cpython.unicode were added.
    - Passing language='c++' into cythonize() globally enables C++ mode
      for all modules that were not passed as Extension objects
      (i.e. only source files and file patterns).
    - Py_hash_t is a known type (used in CPython for hash values).
    - PySlice_*() C-API functions are available from the cpython.slice module.
    - Allow arrays of C++ classes.
  * Bugs fixed
    - Reference leak for non-simple Python expressions in boolean and/or expressions.
    - To fix a name collision and to reflect availability on host
      platforms, standard C declarations [ clock(), time(), struct tm
      and tm* functions ] were moved from posix/time.pxd to a new
      libc/time.pxd. Patch by Charles Blake.
    - Rerunning unmodified modules in IPython's cython support
      failed. Patch by Matthias Bussonier.
    - Casting C++ std::string to Python byte strings failed when
      auto-decoding was enabled.
    - Fatal exceptions in global module init code could lead to
      crashes if the already created module was used later on
      (e.g. through a stale reference in sys.modules or elsewhere).
    - cythonize.py script was not installed on MS-Windows.
  * Other changes
    - Compilation no longer fails hard when unknown compilation
      options are passed. Instead, it raises a warning and ignores
      them (as it did silently before 0.21). This will be changed back
      to an error in a future release.

  This is a patch from upstream that restores version information
  whose removal is preventing several packages from correctly
  detecting Cython's presence.  It is already merged upstream and 
  so should be in the next release.
  Note that despite what upstream says, 
  python-tables/python3-tables is NOT the only package affected by
  this, which is why the patch is going here instead of 
  python-tables/python3-tables.
  python-bcolz/python3-bcolz is an example of another package
  affected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 11 09:30:20 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 0.21 (2014-09-10)
  * Features added
    * C (cdef) functions allow inner Python functions.
    * Enums can now be declared as cpdef to export their values to
      the module's Python namespace.  Cpdef enums in pxd files export
      their values to their own module, iff it exists.
    * Allow @staticmethod decorator to declare static cdef methods.
      This is especially useful for declaring "constructors" for
      cdef classes that can take non-Python arguments.
    * Taking a ``char*`` from a temporary Python string object is safer
      in more cases and can be done inside of non-trivial expressions,
      including arguments of a function call.  A compile time error
      is raised only when such a pointer is assigned to a variable and
      would thus exceed the lifetime of the string itself.
    * Generators have new properties ``__name__`` and ``__qualname__``
      that provide the plain/qualified name of the generator function
      (following CPython 3.5).  See http://bugs.python.org/issue21205
    * The ``inline`` function modifier is available as a decorator
      ``@cython.inline`` in pure mode.
    * When cygdb is run in a virtualenv, it enables the same virtualenv
      inside of the debugger. Patch by Marc Abramowitz.
    * PEP 465: dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication (A @ B).
    * HTML output of annotated code uses Pygments for code highlighting
      and generally received a major overhaul by Matthias Bussonier.
    * IPython magic support is now available directly from Cython with
      the command "%load_ext cython".  Cython code can directly be
      executed in a cell when marked with "%%cython".  Code analysis
      is available with "%%cython -a".  Patch by Martín Gaitán.
    * Simple support for declaring Python object types in Python signature
      annotations.  Currently requires setting the compiler directive
      ``annotation_typing=True``.
    * New directive ``use_switch`` (defaults to True) to optionally disable
      the optimization of chained if statement to C switch statements.
    * Defines dynamic_cast et al. in ``libcpp.cast`` and C++ heap data
      structure operations in ``libcpp.algorithm``.
    * Shipped header declarations in ``posix.*`` were extended to cover
      more of the POSIX API.  Patches by Lars Buitinck and Mark Peek.
  * Optimizations
    * Simple calls to C implemented Python functions/methods are faster.
      This also speeds up many operations on builtins that Cython cannot
      otherwise optimise.
    * The "and"/"or" operators try to avoid unnecessary coercions of their
      arguments.  They now evaluate the truth value of each argument
      independently and only coerce the final result of the whole expression
      to the target type (e.g. the type on the left side of an assignment).
      This also avoids reference counting overhead for Python values during
      evaluation and generally improves the code flow in the generated C code.
    * The Python expression "2 ** N" is optimised into bit shifting.
      See http://bugs.python.org/issue21420
    * Cascaded assignments (a = b = ...) try to minimise the number of
      type coercions.
    * Calls to ``slice()`` are translated to a straight C-API call.
  * Bugs fixed
    * Crash when assigning memory views from ternary conditional expressions.
    * Nested C++ templates could lead to unseparated ">>" characters being
      generated into the C++ declarations, which older C++ compilers could
      not parse.
    * Sending SIGINT (Ctrl-C) during parallel cythonize() builds could
      hang the child processes.
    * No longer ignore local setup.cfg files for distutils in pyximport.
      Patch by Martin Teichmann.
    * Taking a ``char*`` from an indexed Python string generated unsafe
      reference counting code.
    * Set literals now create all of their items before trying to add them
      to the set, following the behaviour in CPython.  This makes a
      difference in the rare case that the item creation has side effects
      and some items are not hashable (or if hashing them has side effects,
      too).
    * Cython no longer generates the cross product of C functions for code
      that uses memory views of fused types in function signatures (e.g.
      ``cdef func(floating[:] a, floating[:] b)``).  This is considered the
      expected behaviour by most users and was previously inconsistent with
      other structured types like C arrays.  Code that really wants all type
      combinations can create the same fused memoryview type under different
      names and use those in the signature to make it clear which types are
      independent.
    * Names that were unknown at compile time were looked up as builtins at
      runtime but not as global module names.  Trying both lookups helps with
      globals() manipulation.
    * Fixed stl container conversion for typedef element types.
    * ``obj.pop(x)`` truncated large C integer values of x to ``Py_ssize_t``.
    * ``__init__.pyc`` is recognised as marking a package directory
      (in addition to .py, .pyx and .pxd).
    * Syntax highlighting in ``cython-mode.el`` for Emacs no longer
      incorrectly highlights keywords found as part of longer names.
    * Correctly handle ``from cython.submodule cimport name``.
    * Fix infinite recursion when using super with cpdef methods.
    * No-args ``dir()`` was not guaranteed to return a sorted list.
  * Other changes
    * The header line in the generated C files no longer contains the
      timestamp but only the Cython version that wrote it.  This was
      changed to make builds more reproducible.
    * Removed support for CPython 2.4, 2.5 and 3.1.
    * The licensing implications on the generated code were clarified
      to avoid legal constraints for users.

    or a user provided dealloc method.
  * Compiler crash on readonly properties in "binding" mode.
  * Auto-encoding with ``c_string_encoding=ascii`` failed in Py3.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  8 11:40:51 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.20.1
  * List/Tuple literals multiplied by more than one factor were only multiplied
    by the last factor instead of all.
  * Lookups of special methods (specifically for context managers) could fail
    in Python <= 2.6/3.1.
  * Local variables were erroneously appended to the signature introspection
    of Cython implemented functions with keyword-only arguments under Python 3.
  * In-place assignments to variables with inferred Python builtin/extension
    types could fail with type errors if the result value type was incompatible
    with the type of the previous value.
  * The C code generation order of cdef classes, closures, helper code,
    etc. was not deterministic, thus leading to high code churn.
  * Type inference could fail to deduce C enum types.
  * Type inference could deduce unsafe or inefficient types from integer
    assignments within a mix of inferred Python variables and integer
    variables.

- Cython grew a dependency on saxutils (and since then, libplist
  failed to build). Add python-xml as a Requires to avoid:
  [...]
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/Cython/Compiler/Annotate.py",
  line 6, in <module> from xml.sax.saxutils import escape as
  html_escape.
  ImportError: No module named xml.sax.saxutils

- Update to version 0.20:
  * Support for CPython 3.4.
  * Support for calling C++ template functions.
  * yield is supported in finally clauses.
  * The C code generated for finally blocks is duplicated for each exit
    case to allow for better optimisations by the C compiler.
  * Cython tries to undo the Python optimisationism of assigning a bound
    method to a local variable when it can generate better code for the
    direct call.
  * Constant Python float values are cached.
  * String equality comparisons can use faster type specific code in
    more cases than before.
  * String/Unicode formatting using the '%' operator uses a faster
    C-API call.
  * bytearray has become a known type and supports coercion from and
    to C strings.  Indexing, slicing and decoding is optimised. Note that
    this may have an impact on existing code due to type inference.
  * Using cdef basestring stringvar and function arguments typed as
    basestring is now meaningful and allows assigning exactly
    str and unicode objects, but no subtypes of these types.
  * Support for the __debug__ builtin.
  * Assertions in Cython compiled modules are disabled if the running
    Python interpreter was started with the "-O" option.
  * Some types that Cython provides internally, such as functions and
    generators, are now shared across modules if more than one Cython
    implemented module is imported.
  * The type inference algorithm works more fine granular by taking the
    results of the control flow analysis into account.
  * A new script in bin/cythonize provides a command line frontend
    to the cythonize() compilation function (including distutils build).
  * The new extension type decorator @cython.no_gc_clear prevents
    objects from being cleared during cyclic garbage collection, thus
    making sure that object attributes are kept alive until deallocation.
  * During cyclic garbage collection, attributes of extension types that
    cannot create reference cycles due to their type (e.g. strings) are
    no longer considered for traversal or clearing.  This can reduce the
    processing overhead when searching for or cleaning up reference cycles.
  * Package compilation (i.e. __init__.py files) now works, starting
    with Python 3.3.
  * The cython-mode.el script for Emacs was updated.  Patch by Ivan Andrus.
  * An option common_utility_include_dir was added to cythonize() to save
    oft-used utility code once in a separate directory rather than as
    part of each generated file.
  * unraisable_tracebacks directive added to control printing of
    tracebacks of unraisable exceptions.

- update to 0.19.2:
    * Some standard declarations were fixed or updated, including the previously
    incorrect declaration of PyBuffer_FillInfo() and some missing bits in
    libc.math.

    * Heap allocated subtypes of type used the wrong base type struct at the
    C level.

    * Calling the unbound method dict.keys/value/items() in dict subtypes could
    call the bound object method instead of the unbound supertype method.

    * "yield" wasn't supported in "return" value expressions.

    * Using the "bint" type in memory views lead to unexpected results.
    It is now an error.

    * Assignments to global/closure variables could catch them in an illegal state
    while deallocating the old value.

Mon May 13 08:17:40 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 0.19.1:
  * Completely empty C-API structs for extension type slots (protocols like
  number/mapping/sequence) are no longer generated into the C code.
  * Docstrings that directly follow a public/readonly attribute declaration
  in a cdef class will be used as docstring of the auto-generated property.
  This fixes ticket 206.
  * The automatic signature documentation tries to preserve more semantics
  of default arguments and argument types.  Specifically, bint arguments
  now appear as type bool.
  * A warning is emitted when negative literal indices are found inside of
  a code section that disables wraparound handling.  This helps with
  fixing invalid code that might fail in the face of future compiler
  optimisations.
  * Constant folding for boolean expressions (and/or) was improved.
  * Added a build_dir option to cythonize() which allows one to place
  the generated .c files outside the source tree.
