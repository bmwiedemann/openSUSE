%description
Coveralls.io is a service to publish coverage stats online.
This package provides integration with coverage.py in Python projects.

The module makes custom report for data generated by the coverage.py
package and sends it to the json API of the coveralls.io service. All
Python files in the coverage analysis are posted to this service,
along with coverage stats, so do not upload what you do not intend
to. (For private projects, there is Coveralls Pro.)
