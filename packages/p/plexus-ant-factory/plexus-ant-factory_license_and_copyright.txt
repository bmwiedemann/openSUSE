Subject: plexus-ant-factory license and copyright

This is just an official notice that I wrote the original version of the 
plexus-ant-factory, and that it's licensed in a consistent manner with 
the plexus-container-default artifact, which is APLv2.0.

Since then, it's only been modified by plexus-project committers, with 
the understanding that all of plexus is APLv2-compliant.
