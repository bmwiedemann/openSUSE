%description
CPAN::Perl::Releases is a module that contains the mappings of all 'perl'
releases that have been uploaded to CPAN to the 'authors/id/' path that the
tarballs reside in.

This is static data, but newer versions of this module will be made
available as new releases of 'perl' are uploaded to CPAN.
