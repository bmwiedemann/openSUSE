%description
nose-progressive is a nose_ plugin which displays progress in a stationary bar,
freeing the rest of the screen (as well as the scrollback buffer) for the
compact display of test failures, which it formats beautifully and usefully. It
displays failures and errors as soon as they occur and avoids scrolling them
off the screen in favor of less useful output. It also offers a number of other
human-centric features to speed the debugging process.

# The test files use 'import __builtin__', which is python2 only syntax. But nose does not mind and
# therefore runs into some other differences between pythons... Surprisingly, most of python3 tests pass.
