    <comment>- Update to 1.4.2

    script if it generated enough output to fill the OS pipe buffer (#7699).

    faster installation of packages and independence from pip
    (#6205).
  * Add support for Private :: trove classifiers (#7271).
  * Add the version of poetry in the @generated comment at the
    beginning of the lock file (#7339).
  * Add support for virtualenvs.prefer-active-python when running

    experimental.new-installer to false (#7358).
  * Remove unused platform field from cached package info and bump
    the cache version (#7304).
  * Extra dependencies of the root project are now sorted in the
    lock file (#7375).

    (#7434).
