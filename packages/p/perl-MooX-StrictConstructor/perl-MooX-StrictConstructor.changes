          - Switched from Carp::confess to die in order to avoid leaking
            sensitive data via stack traces. The previous behavior can be
            enabled in an application by using Carp::Always.  Thanks
            @jrubinator!

          - Undo the previous "fix" for the minimum perl version.
            The basic requirement is for 5.004 but the tests require
            5.006.

          - Built using current Dist::Zilla, so various things
            are better, e.g. includes a LICENSE.
          - A couple of things that are only used in xt tests
            used to be test requirements, now their develop
            requirements.
          - No longer includes explicit dependencies on a handful
            of modules (e.g. indirect) that Moo's use of strictures
            used to require.
          - Now only includes a Makefile.PL.
          - The build now includes a cpanfile in the repo.
          - The minimum perl version is now consistent between the
            Makefile.PL and the META.{yml,json} files.

          - Include Tim Bunce's efficiency and error messaging
            patch.
          - Typos in POD and README.
