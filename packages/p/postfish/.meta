  <title>A digital audio post-processing tool</title>
  <description>the Postfish is a digital audio post-processing, restoration, filtering
and mixdown tool. It works as a linear audio filter, much like a rack
of analog effects. The first stage of the filter pipeline provides a
bank of configurable per-channel processing filters for up to 32 input
channels. The second stage provides mixdown of the processed input
audio into a group of up to eight output channels. The third stage
applies processing filters to the output group post-mixdown.</description>
