    <comment>- Update to 1.1.1
  * Dropped support for Python 3.4. (issue #1129)
  * Removed deprecated commands (server namespaces and server
    interop. These commands are part of the namespace group
    namespace list and namespace interop.)
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Resolved new issues reported by Pylint 2.13. (issue #1164)
  * Fix issue where the instance shrub –fullpath option was not
    displaying the paths. (see issue #1180)
  * Fixed new formatting issues raised by flake8 5.0.
  * Fixed issue where the instance shrub command duplicated the
    results instances tree in cases where there was an
    inter-namespace association and displayed the complete
    ClassName of the association class rather than just the class
    name. (see issue #1191)
  * Fix issue where we were not setting the flag to use the general
    option –max-pull-option when the was defined with an
    interactive command. This meant that the option was ignored for
    the current command. (see issue # 1193).
  * Fixed a flake8 AttributeError when using importlib-metadata
    5.0.0 on Python&gt;=3.7, by pinning importlib-metadata to &lt;5.0.0
    on these Python versions.
  ## Enhancements:
  * Increased minimum version of Click to 8.0.1 on Python &gt;= 3.6 to
    prepare for new features. Adjusted testcases accordingly.
  * Extended class/instance enumerate/get/associators/references
    and qualifier enumerate to allow getting the objects from
    multiple namespaces with a single request. This extends the
    command option –namespace to allow multiple namespaces for
    these commands using either comma-separated format (ex.
    –namespace root/cimv2,root/cimv3) or multiple definitions of
    the option (ex. –namespace root/cimv2 –namespace root/cimv3)
    The display of results have been extended to include the
    namespace name for the objects in all of the output formats if
    multiple namespaces are used. As before, the namespaces are not
    shown if only a single or the default namespace is
    requested.(see issues #1058 and #1059)
  * Add a new option (–object-order) to class and instance
    enumerate/get/associators/references and qualifier
    enumerate/get to reorder the command results displays by the
    object name rather than the default of namespace name. This
    allows the user to more easily compare the objects themselves
    in different namespaces. (see issues #1058 and #1059)
  * Extended documentation to better document the use and
    characteristics of the general options and the creation of the
    mock WBEM server script (see issue #1190)
  ## Cleanup:
  * Extend use of general options in interactive mode to allow
    setting the connections-file for an interactive command. (see
    issue #1037)
  * Change DOCKER TEST_SERVER_IMAGE defined in Makefile to use one
    created from OpenPegasus toolset. See github
    OpenPegasus/OpenPegasusDocker repository for pegasus, pegasus
    tools, and pegasus docker build tools. This image should be
    faster and is smaller (lt 400 mb) although still too large.
    This docker file was created using the Docker definition and
    makefiles in the github project OpenPegasus and repository
    OpenPegasusDocker. It contains a build of OpenPegasus on Ubuntu
    20.04 platform with the OpenPegasus test provider environment
    installed. The docker server image build was tested against the
    OpenPegasus testsuite. However, the interop namespace was
    modified to use root/interop in the container. The image
    contains the OpenPegasus components to run the server against a
    repository based on the DMTF schema version 2.41.0.
  * Remove deprecated commands server namespaces and server
    interop.
  * Fixed tests that fail because XML output of classes and
    qualifier declarations return attributes not ordered before
    python version 3.8. (see issue #1173).
  * Modify tests/unit/pywbemcli/wbemserver_mock_class.py to remove
    the CIMInstanceName host lement used in creating a
    ProfileImplements instance. That element of CIMInstanceName is
    not allowed on Create instance of association classes and as of
    pywbem 1.5.0 that limitation is enforces. (see issue #1203)
  * Modify instance shrub command to only display the classname of
    the association class (i.e. reference_class). Even with multi
    namespace environments the reference class must be in the
    target namespace.
  * Extend the pywbemtools documentation to further explain the
    mock server support, and how to create mock environments using
    MOF and python scripts including many more references back to
    the pywbem documentation.
  * Clarify the usage of the general options in the documentation.
    (see issue #1162)
  * Clean up issues in the docs where items in bullet lists do not
    show the bullets Changes rtd-requirements to avoid suspect
    versions. (see issue #1218)
  * Update to requirements files for new Nov 2022 security issues
    with wheel, safety, and py. (see PR # 1627)
