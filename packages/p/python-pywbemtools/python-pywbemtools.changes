- Update to version 0.9.0
  * Modified the --timestats general option from boolean to choice
    with 3 choices for when statistics are displayed (after each
    command or via a command). See   issue #588)
  * Deprecated the 'server namespaces' and 'server interop'
    commands. Use the new commands 'namespace list' and 'namespace
    interop', respectively. (issue #877)
  * The '--force' / '-f' option of the 'class delete' command has
    been deprecated because its name does not sufficiently make it
    clear that other inhibitors than existing instances of the
    class (such as existing subclasses, or referencing classes)
    will still cause rejection of the command. Use the new
    '--include-instances' option instead. (issue #885)
  * Fixed a ValueError on Windows that was raised when the
    connections file was not on the home drive.
  * Limit click package to < 8.0 because of a) incompatibility with
    python 2.7, b) incompatibility between click 8.0 and
    clicl-repl. (see issues #816 and #817)
  * Limit mock package to lt 4.0.3 to avoid issue issue that causes
    test failure. (see #822)
  * Fix issue caused by mock package version 4.0.3 by creating
    replacements for warnings.warn and warnings.warn_explicit
    functions  and removing the use of the patch decorator in
    pywbemcli.py before the definition of the cli function.  (see
    issue #822)
  * Fixes issue where in pywbemcli the --timeout and --use-pull
    general options were not always correctly included in the new
    object context in interactive mode if they were specified on
    the interactive mode cmd line.
  * Fixed issue in tests with use of stdin and inputting the
    instance path for instance get and instance delete. This was a
    test setup issue and not a code issue. (see issue # 387)
  * Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning
    coveralls-python to <3.0.0.
  * Fix issue where documentation index disappeared when we changed
    the documentation theme (see issue #868)
  * Test: Fixed behavior of 'pdb' test condition, which is supposed
    to stop in the pdb debugger before executing the command
    function, but did immediately leave the debugger again because
    of redirections of the standard streams. The debugger now
    properly comes up when 'pdb' is specified as a condition.
  * Test: Fixed restoring of environment variables that are
    modified by testcases, and displaying of PYWBEMCLI environment
    variables during testing in verbose mode.
  * Change MOFCompiler.add_mof/remove_mof() to only display
    exceptions received if not MOFCompileError since the MOF
    compiler logs all MOFCompileError exceptions. (see issue #395)
  * Increased the minimum pywbem version to 1.2.0.
  * Add new option to class find command (--summary) to display a
    summary of the counts of classes found instead of the full list
    of the classes to make the command more useful for real servers
    that may return many classes for a class find. (see issue #810)
  * Extend the class tree command to optionally provide extra
    information about each class in the tree including 1) the value
    of the Version qualifier if it exists and whether the class is
    Abstract, an Association, or an Indication class. (see. # 817)
  * Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This
    required several changes in package dependencies for
    development.
  * The verbose option ('-v' / '--verbose') now also displays the
    objects that are compiled into a mock environment when setting
    it up.
  * Added 'qualifier delete' command. (see #884)
  * Enabled the tests for Python 3.4 on Windows again - this
    required some changes in the Makefile and constraints files.
  * Added a 'namespace' command group that allows listing, creating
    and deleting CIM namespaces, and showing the Interop namespace.
    The 'server namespaces' and 'server interop' commands that
    provide a subset of that functionality have been deprecated.
    (issue #877)
  * Added commands 'add-mof' and 'remove-mof' for compiling MOF to
    the 'server' command group. (issue #886)
  * Test: Added end2end test capability using the OpenPegasus
    container image on Docker Hub.
  * Added new command group ('statistics') that contols use of
    statistics. See issue #588)
  * Implement command to get statistics from server and present as
    a table #895)
  * Test: Added a unit test module for _utils.py.
  * Added an '--include-instances' option to the 'class delete'
    command that replaces the deprecated '--force' / '-f' option.
    (issue #885)
  * Added an '--include-objects' option to the 'namespace delete'
    command that causes the deletion of instances, classes and
    qualifier types in the targeted namespace before the namespace
    itself is deleted. The objects in the namespace are deleted in
    the correct order of dependencies so that no dangling
    dependencies exist at any point in the operation. (issue #885)
  * Added a ''--dry-run' option to the 'class delete' and
    'namespace delete' commands. If used, it displays the message
    about each deletion with a 'Dry run:' prefix and does not
    perform the actual deletion. (issue #911)
  * Cleaned up the circumvention for Click issue #1231 by upgrading
    the minimum Click version to 7.1.1, where possible. The
    circumvention is still required on Python 2.7 and 3.4 on
    Windows.
  * Clarified in the help text of general option '--pdb' that it
    will be ignored in interactive mode but can be specified on
    each interactive command.
  * Test: Added a check that rejects the use of the 'pdb' test
    condition when the test specifies stdin for the test, because
    the 'pdb' test condition disables the stdin/stdout/stderr
    redirection.
- Release 0.8.0
  * Moving the commands "server profiles" and "serve centralinsts"
    to the new group profiles with the commmand names "profile
    list" and "profile centralinsts" added a command group and
    removed 2 commands from the server command group. (See issue
    #612)
  * The `--deprecation-warnings` / `--no-deprecation-warnings`
    general option has been remamed to `--warn` / `--no-warn`, and
    it now controls the display of all Python warnings.
  * Order display of instance names when the .? is used to pick an
    instance name so the same order of instance names is displayed
    for all versions of Python. (See issue #458 and #459)
  * Pinned prompt-toolkit to <3.0 on Python 3.8 on Windows to avoid
    WinError 995. (See issue #690)
  * Fixed exception when command entered in interactive mode, on
    Python 2. (See issue #224)
  * Test: Default connection file does not get restored in some
    cases during test. (See issue #680)
  * AssociationShrub produces instancename slightly different table
    output in some cases for pywbem 1 vs previous
    versions(inclusion of "/:" prefix). (see issue #704)
  * Test: Fixed attempt in test_class_cmds.py to invoke a
    non-static method on a class object. (see issue #707)
  * Fix help message for "--deprecated" to be unicode so python 2.7
    help does not fail. (see issue #725). This error was added with
    issue #678
  * Upgraded nocasedict and nocaselist packages to pick up fixes.
  * Error in test defintion for qualdecl Indication causes failure
    with pywbem i.1.0 where mocker validates qualifiers scopes.
    (see issue #766)
  * Test: Preventive fix for potential issue with virtualenv
    raising AttributeError during installtest on Python 3.4. (see
    issue #775)
  * Test: Added checking for no expected warning. (see issue #774)
  * Fixed incorrect property order in instance table output, where
    key properties were not ordered before non-key properties but
    ordered along with them. (see issue #782)
  * Docs/Test: Fixed failing install of Jinja2 on Python 3.4 by
    adding it to dev-requirements.txt and pinning it to <2.11 for
    Python 3.4.
  * Test: Aligned qualifier definitions in test MOF with CIM
    Schema. (related to issue #788)
  * Upgraded pywbem to 1.1.1 to pick up fixes and enhancements.
    (see issues #749, #183)
  * Introduced caching of the mock environment used by connection
    definitions in order to speed up the loading of the connection
    definition. The mock environments are stored in directory
    ~/.pywbemcli_mockcache and are automatically managed. The
    pywbemcli --verbose general option can be used to show messages
    about the cache management. (See issue #689)
  * A new approach for the setup of mock scripts has been
    introduced: The mock script defines a `setup(conn, server,
    verbose)` function that is called when the mock environment is
    built. It is not called when the mock environment is
    reinstantiated from the cache. The old approach with setting
    global variables CONN, SERVER, VERBOSE is still supported, but
    the mock environment cannot be cached and will be built every
    time when mock scripts with that setup approach are used. On
    Python <3.5, mock scripts with the `setup()` function are
    rejected, because the functionality to import them is not
    available, and the compile+exec approach does not allow
    executing the setup() function. (See issue #689)
  * Modify general help to display the full path of the default
    connections file. (See issue #660)
  * Move the commands associated with WBEM management profiles from
    the server group to a new profile group. (See issue #612). See
    also Incompatible changes.
  * Add --deprecated/-no-deprecated as a new qualifier filter for
    the class enumerate, class find, and instance count commands.
    Extend the behavior so that for each of the possible filters it
    looks for the qualifier on all of the elements (property,
    method, parameter) in addition to the class itself.  See issue
    #678)
  * Test: Enabled coveralls to run on all Python versions in the
    Travis CI, resulting in a combined coverage for all Python
    versions.
  * For instance display in table format, added the display of the
    units of properties to the table headers. If a property in the
    class has a PUnit or Units qualifier set, the unit is
    translated to a human readable SI unit using the
    pywbem.siunit_obj() function, and appended to the property name
    in square brackets. (See issue #727)
  * Consolidated the warnings control, such that the deprecation
    messages were changed to be issued as Python warnings, and the
    `--warn` / `--no-warn` general options now control the display
    of all Python warnings. If `--warn` is used, all Python
    warnings are shown once. If `--no-warn` is used (default), the
    `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable determines which warnings
    are shown. If that variable is not set, no warnings are shown.
    (See issue #723) Added the 'mock' package and for Python 2.7,
    the 'funcsigs' package as new dependencies.
  * Specifying a property list (--pl option) on instance commands
    with table output formats now uses the order of properties as
    specified in the property list in the output table, instead of
    sorting them. (See issue #702)
  * Allow unsetting general options. Originally the general options
    could be either set specifically by defining them on the
    command line or the default would be enabled. However, in
    interactive mode the need may arise to set an option back to
    its default value (i.e. the equivalent of not including it on
    the command line). This fixes the options so that there is an
    alternative that will will set them to the default value. (see
    issue #350)
  * Converted remaining unittest testcases to pytest. (See issue
    #91)
  * Test: When testing with latest package levels, the package
    versions of indirect dependencies are now also upgraded to the
    latest compatible version from Pypi. (see issue #784)
  * Remove unused NocaseList from __common.py
  * Moved the general option --pull_max_cnt to become part of the
    persistent server definition rather than transient.  This means
    that this parameter is part of the data maintained in the
    server definitionfile and applies to just the server defined.
    (See issue #694)
  * Docs: Improved the description and help texts of the
    connections file and the --connections-file general option in
    various places, for consistency. (Related to issue #708)
  * Move code associated with display_cimobjects() to a separate
    module. This is part of creating table representation of
    classes (See issue #249)
  * Resolved remaining Pylint issues and enforced clean pylint
    checks. (See issue #668)
  * Renamed the default connections file in the user's home
    directory from `pywbemcli_connection_definitions.yaml` to
    `.pywbemcli_connections.yaml`, because it is really an internal
    file not meant for being edited. An existing file with the old
    name is migrated automatically. (See issue #716)
  * Refactor error handling for connections file handlingif there
    are problems with the YAML file or loading the file. Created
    new exceptions for the Connections File and created a unit test
    and function error test. (see issue #661)
  * Separate code to execute test files (ex. setup up mock of
    prompt) from the process of executing files defined by the
    --mock-server general option. The new capability is controled
    by an environment variable "PYWBEMCLI_STARTUP_SCRIPT" that is
    considered intenal to pywbemcli testing.
  * Refactor statistics display to present information consistent
    with the display in pywbem. (see issue # 724)
  * Refactor connections show command and clean up its
    documentation.  (see issue #732)
  * Remove use of pydicti dictionary package in favor of
    NocaseDict.
  * set pylint disable on all uses of pdb.set_trace(). This is an
    issue between the add-on package pdbpp and lint, not pdb.  (see
    issue # 751)
  * Docs: Changed Sphinx theme to sphinx_rtd_theme. (see issue
    #792)
  * Modified the class WbemServerMock in tests/unit/testmock to
    define a WBEM server configuration that includes multiple
    namespaces, a user and an interop namespace to test
    cross-namespace mock. (see issue #183)
