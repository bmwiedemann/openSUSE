- Update to 1.3.0
  ## Incompatible changes:
  * Dropped support for Python 3.5 (issue #1308)
  * Installation of this package using “setup.py” is no longer supported. Use “pip” instead.
  * Update to pywbemtools version 1.3.0 requires pywbem version >=
    1.7.2 which allows urllib3 version >= 2.0. This may result in
    issues with SSL because urllib3 may require support of TLS
    protocol version >= 1.2 possibly resulting in exceptions such
    as the following:
        SSLError(1, ‘[SSL: UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL] unsupported protocol …) or
        NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2.0 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+
  * See pywbem troubleshooting documentation. for help resolving such issues.
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Increased pywbem to 1.7.2 to pick up fixes. (issue #1304)
  * Addressed safety issues up to 2024-03-25.
  * Fixed coveralls issues with KeyError and HTTP 422 Unprocessable
    Entity.
  * Disallow the use of the click_repl version 3.0 because it
    cannot process general options and causes a significant number
    of CLI tests to fail. (issue #1312)
  * Circumvented the removal of Python 2.7 from the Github Actions
    plugin setup-python, by using the Docker container
    python:2.7.18-buster instead.
  * Fixed issue with PyYAML 5.4 installation on Python>=3.10 that
    fails since the recent release of Cython 3.
  * Correct issue in tab completion for –name argument and option
    where nvalid co:nnection file could cause exception. Changes
    messages issued for error to warning. This eliminates most
    tests of pywbemlistener but only with Python 2.7 and that
    version of Python is deprecated (see issue #1316)
  * Test: Circumvented a pip-check-reqs issue by excluding its
    version 2.5.0.
  * Test: cicumvented a test failure with pywbmlistener and python
    2.7 by disabling a significant number of pywbemlistener tests
    for python 2.7 and modifying the packages to use subprocess32
    in place of subprocess with python 2.7 in case any tests fail.
    (see issue #1327)
  * Development: Fixed dependency issue with safety 3.0.0 by
    pinning it.
  * Test: Upgraded GitHub Actions plugins to use node.js 20.
  * Test: Fixed issues resulting from removal of support for
    pytest.warns(None) in pytest version 8.
  * Test: Fixed invocation of pipdeptree in test workflow to use
    python -m.
  * Fixed pywbemtools install tests to perform the import test in a
    directory where it does not import from the repo main
    directory. Removed the temporary disablement of the install
    tests that was put in place during development of pywbem 1.2.0.
  ## Enhancements:
  * Added support for Python 3.12.
  * Extend tab completion to include connection show, connection
    delete, connection save. (see issue # 1315)
  * Changed version of OpenPegasus-wbemserver container for end2end
    tests from version 0.1.2 to 0.1.3. This version corrects
    OpenPegasus issues in requesting test indications from the wbem
    server and uses OpenPegasus 2.14.4 or greater. This change will
    allow end2end indication testing.
  * Fix issue where localhost was always assigned as the
    pywbemlistener bind address. This limited the listener to only
    receiving indications from the same system as the listener
    itself and only on the local network interface. This change was
    part of extending the options to allow the user to define the
    bind address as part of the start and run commands. (see issue
    #1296)
  * Add pywbemlistener run/start command option –bind-addr to allow
    the user to define a bind address to a listener. This replaces
    the use of the ixed bind-address of localhost. This also
    changes the default bind address to allow receiving indications
    on any local system network interrface and not testing for the
    indication destination IP address. (see issue #1296)
  * Add an option to pywbemlistener to allow testing with a
    listener on a different address/system than the system where
    pywbemlistener test is being executed. This will allow testing
    across multiple systems.
  * Split safety run out of “check” make target ino a separate
    “safety” make target and moved its run to the end of the test
    workflow.
  * Split safety runs into an ‘install’ and an ‘all’ run. The
    install run uses a new minimum-constraints-install.txt file
    that contains just the direct and indirect install dependencies
    and must suceed. The ‘all’ run uses the minimum-constraints.txt
    file which includes the minimum-constraints-install.txt file
    and that run may fail. This reduces the burden of fixing safety
    issues that affect only development packages.
  * Dev: Improved release procedure by generalizing the stable
    branch name in the test workflow which allowed removing the
    step to update it.
  * Added support for running ‘ruff’, a new lint tool.
  * Indroduces a troubleshooting section to the pywbemtools
    documentation.
  * Dev: Pinned coverage to <7.0 to speed up installation of
    development environment. coveralls 3.3 also pins coverage to
    <7.0, so that is not a unique restriction of pywbem.
  ## Cleanup:
  * Change to used safety-policy-file .safety-policy-yml to keep
    the safety issue ignore list in place of the list in the
    Makefile.
  * Add several new safety ignore entries into .safety-policy.yml
    from the new issues that were added to list May 2023.
  * Clean up several documentation syntax issues in the pywbemcli
    documentation.
  * New safety issue(GitPython) Sept 2023, check-reqs issue
    ruamel-yaml.
  * Changed the format of the README and README_PYPI files from RST
    to Markdown, to address formatting issues with badges on the
    Github site (issue #1376).
- Redo requirements 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 25 09:45:24 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.2.0
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fix issue where "instance get" was not properly ordering the
    columns of the table output for commands like "-o table
    instance get ... --pl p1,p2,p3". The table was not being output
    in the same order as the list of properties in the property
    list option. (see issue #1259)
  * Changed the development status of the Python package from "4 -
    Beta" to "5 - Production/Stable". This actually applies since
    version 1.1.0. (issue #1237)
  * Fix minor issue where if user input --pl "a, b, c" they would
    get strange error. Now fails with error stating that space not
    allowed in property list.
  * Fix issue in instance count where error reports CIMError code
    and not the code string. (see #1242)
  * Fix issue with invalid --connections-file general option and
    interactive mode. Will abort entering interactive mode if the
    file does not exist. (See issue #1275)
  ## Enhancements:
  * Added a new make target 'check_reqs' that runs pip-missing-reqs
    on the pywbemtools package itself and on some development
    commands, and added that to the GitHub Actions test workflow.
    (issue #1255)
  * Added displaying of the package dependency tree via pipdeptree
    to the GitHub Actions test workflow. (issue #1256)
  * Test: Added new make target 'check_reqs' that uses
    pip-missing-reqs to check for missing dependencies in
    minimum-constraints.txt.
  * Added support for Python 3.11. (issue #1243)
  * Increased the minimum version of pywbem to 1.6.0. (issue #1244)
  * Add a new command that will display help on subjects that have
    been defined for the command. This allows defining help for
    subjects that are not specific to a particular command. This is
    created specifically to provide help for the setup to activate
    shell tab completion. The initial subjects are repl and
    instancename.
  * Add a new command to pywbemcli (docs) that calls the current
    system default web browser to view the pywbemtools public
    documentation that is in ReadTheDocs.
  * Added documentation defining activation of tab-complation in
    shells. Tab-completion must be activated by the user before the
    <TAB> can be used in cmd mode to complete the terminal input of
    command and option names. (see issue #1158)
  * Add specific tab-completion for the values of the general
    option --name and command arguments/names values that look up
    connection name to enable tab_completion for Click 8 and ignore
    it for Click 7. Modify general options --mock-server,
    --connection-file, --keyfile, --certfile that are for files to
    use the click.Path type which enables tab-completion. Modify
    --use-pull choice general option to allow the "" choice. so
    that tab-completion is automatically enabled. (See issue #487)
  * Modify several pywbemlistener args and options to make enable
    tab-completion. This includes output-format, keyfile, certfile,
    keyfile, scheme, output_format, logdir. (see issue # 1278)
  * Add docs command to pywbemlistener. This is the same as the
    docs command in pywbemcli and calls the system default browser
    to load the pywbemtools documentation in ReadTheDocs.
  * Add help command to pywbemlistener. This is the same as the
    help command in which defines a set of general subjects for
    pywbemlistener about which help can be requested. The subjects
    are generally about tab-completion and tab-completion
    activation.
  ## Cleanup:
  * Update to reflect new security issues that were added in Jan
    2023. This involved GitPython, safety, setuptools certifi, and
    future.
  * Update for new tests in pylint including 1) use-dict-literal
    which warns about call to dict() when passing keyword arguments
    vs. using literal (This is a speed issue) 2) overlybroad
    exceptions. Modified definition of overlybroadexceptions to
    prefix names with builtins. 3. Fixed issue found by new
    usless-exception warning. (raise not part of statement)
  * Improve the help description for repl. It was not complete.
  * Update Pegasus docker image version to 0.1.2
- Drop pywbemtools-pr1251-py311.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 22 09:31:10 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.1.1
  * Dropped support for Python 3.4. (issue #1129)
  * Removed deprecated commands (server namespaces and server
    interop. These commands are part of the namespace group
    namespace list and namespace interop.)
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Resolved new issues reported by Pylint 2.13. (issue #1164)
  * Fix issue where the instance shrub –fullpath option was not
    displaying the paths. (see issue #1180)
  * Fixed new formatting issues raised by flake8 5.0.
  * Fixed issue where the instance shrub command duplicated the
    results instances tree in cases where there was an
    inter-namespace association and displayed the complete
    ClassName of the association class rather than just the class
    name. (see issue #1191)
  * Fix issue where we were not setting the flag to use the general
    option –max-pull-option when the was defined with an
    interactive command. This meant that the option was ignored for
    the current command. (see issue # 1193).
  * Fixed a flake8 AttributeError when using importlib-metadata
    5.0.0 on Python>=3.7, by pinning importlib-metadata to <5.0.0
    on these Python versions.
  ## Enhancements:
  * Increased minimum version of Click to 8.0.1 on Python >= 3.6 to
    prepare for new features. Adjusted testcases accordingly.
  * Extended class/instance enumerate/get/associators/references
    and qualifier enumerate to allow getting the objects from
    multiple namespaces with a single request. This extends the
    command option –namespace to allow multiple namespaces for
    these commands using either comma-separated format (ex.
    –namespace root/cimv2,root/cimv3) or multiple definitions of
    the option (ex. –namespace root/cimv2 –namespace root/cimv3)
    The display of results have been extended to include the
    namespace name for the objects in all of the output formats if
    multiple namespaces are used. As before, the namespaces are not
    shown if only a single or the default namespace is
    requested.(see issues #1058 and #1059)
  * Add a new option (–object-order) to class and instance
    enumerate/get/associators/references and qualifier
    enumerate/get to reorder the command results displays by the
    object name rather than the default of namespace name. This
    allows the user to more easily compare the objects themselves
    in different namespaces. (see issues #1058 and #1059)
  * Extended documentation to better document the use and
    characteristics of the general options and the creation of the
    mock WBEM server script (see issue #1190)
  ## Cleanup:
  * Extend use of general options in interactive mode to allow
    setting the connections-file for an interactive command. (see
    issue #1037)
  * Change DOCKER TEST_SERVER_IMAGE defined in Makefile to use one
    created from OpenPegasus toolset. See github
    OpenPegasus/OpenPegasusDocker repository for pegasus, pegasus
    tools, and pegasus docker build tools. This image should be
    faster and is smaller (lt 400 mb) although still too large.
    This docker file was created using the Docker definition and
    makefiles in the github project OpenPegasus and repository
    OpenPegasusDocker. It contains a build of OpenPegasus on Ubuntu
    20.04 platform with the OpenPegasus test provider environment
    installed. The docker server image build was tested against the
    OpenPegasus testsuite. However, the interop namespace was
    modified to use root/interop in the container. The image
    contains the OpenPegasus components to run the server against a
    repository based on the DMTF schema version 2.41.0.
  * Remove deprecated commands server namespaces and server
    interop.
  * Fixed tests that fail because XML output of classes and
    qualifier declarations return attributes not ordered before
    python version 3.8. (see issue #1173).
  * Modify tests/unit/pywbemcli/wbemserver_mock_class.py to remove
    the CIMInstanceName host lement used in creating a
    ProfileImplements instance. That element of CIMInstanceName is
    not allowed on Create instance of association classes and as of
    pywbem 1.5.0 that limitation is enforces. (see issue #1203)
  * Modify instance shrub command to only display the classname of
    the association class (i.e. reference_class). Even with multi
    namespace environments the reference class must be in the
    target namespace.
  * Extend the pywbemtools documentation to further explain the
    mock server support, and how to create mock environments using
    MOF and python scripts including many more references back to
    the pywbem documentation.
  * Clarify the usage of the general options in the documentation.
    (see issue #1162)
  * Clean up issues in the docs where items in bullet lists do not
    show the bullets Changes rtd-requirements to avoid suspect
    versions. (see issue #1218)
  * Update to requirements files for new Nov 2022 security issues
    with wheel, safety, and py. (see PR # 1627)
- Drop pywbemtools-pr1154-click8.patch 
- Add pywbemtools-pr1251-py311.patch gh#pywbem/pywbemtools#1251

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 23 10:04:49 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 1.0.0
  * Incompatible changes:
    - The PYWBEMCLI_TERMWIDTH environment variable was renamed to
      PYWBEMTOOLS_TERMWIDTH since it is common to all pywbemtools
      commands.
    - Changed option --default on command connection select to
      set-default. to be compatible with other commands that touch
      the default connection definition.
    - Removed the deprecated option --force from the class delete
      command. It had been marked deprecated in pywbemtools version
      0.9.0 and was superseded by the --include-instances option
      which performs exactly the same function. (see issue # 1142)
  * Bug fixes:
    - Test: Fixed that test_utils.py changed the
      PYWBEMCLI_TERMWIDTH env var for testing purposes without
      restoring it.
    - Fixes issue where the command: class invokemethod <class>
      <method> -n <namespace> ignores the command namespace option
      (-n) and usedsthe default namespace. (see issue #990)
    - Fix issue where an exception occurs if the user tries to
      display cim instances as a table but the class for the
      instances returned are not in the default namespace and an
      alternate namespace is defined for the command. The function
      display_cim_objects(...) uses valuemapping_for_property() but
      specifies the default namespace as the target. (See issue
      #995)
    - Fixed issues raised by new Pylint versions 2.9 and 2.10.
    - Fixed an error that resulted in exception traceback when
      instance commands used the instance wildcard (e.g.
      'CIM_ManagedSystemElement.?') and the enumerate instances
      operation failed for some reason. (issue #963)
    - Fix issue where the general help for '--log' was unclear.
      (see issue #1025)
    - Fixed an error that resulted in exception traceback when
      instance commands used the instance wildcard (e.g.
      'CIM_ManagedSystemElement.?') and the enumerate instances
      operation failed for some reason. (issue #963)
    - Fix issue with --log general option where the log was left
      enabled when the option was used in interactive mode command;
      it did not revert to the log state before the interactive
      command. The change caused the log configuration to restore
      to either off if there was no --log option on the subsequent
      command line or to the value defined on the command line.(see
      issue #1023)
    - Disabled new Pylint issue 'consider-using-f-string', since
      f-strings were introduced only in Python 3.6.
    - Fixed install error of wrapt 1.13.0 on Python 2.7 on Windows
      due to lack of MS Visual C++ 9.0 on GitHub Actions, by
      pinning it to <1.13.
    - Fix issue with message from _common.py (parse_version_value)
      that was passed to warning_msg but should have been subclass
      of python warning. Changed to use pywbemtools_warn(). (see
      issue #1041)
    - Fixed issue with Sphinx and python 2.7 by changing the sphinx
      requirements in dev-requirements.txt and
      minimum-constraints.txt. (see issue #1070)
    - Modify dev-requirements.txt to limit version of
      more-itertools to != 8.11.0 for python < 3.6. (see issue
      #1077)
    - Fixed new issues raised by pylint 2.12.2.
    - Fixed issue with instance commands (ex. instance get,
      references, etc) that use the wildcard .? to request that
      pywbemcli present list of possible instances. It was not
      handling the non-existence of class in the target namespace
      correctly and would crash because no instances were returned
      get_instanceNames() . Now generates an exception. (see issue
      #1105)
    - Fixed issues in "instance count" including unitialized
      variable and correctly finishing scan when errors occur. Adds
      new option to this command to allow user to ignore classes
      defined with this option (--ignore-class). (see issues #1108
      and #916 )
    - Fixed issue where pywbemcli can get exception if used against
      server that does not support pull operations (see #1118)
  * Enhancements:
    - Added a 'pywbemlistener' command for running and managing
      WBEM listeners. (issues #430, #479, #948)
    - Implement server schema command that returns information
      about the schemas for each namespace including: 5. the DMTF
      schemas, 2. schema version, 3. whether any classes in the
      schema/namespace are experimental, and 4) the number of
      classes in this schema, and 5. the DMTF schemas (characters
      before the _ in the namespace). (see issue #444)
    - Remove restrictions on parameter modification of server
      parameters when the --name general option is specified.
      Originally the --name server definition could not be modified
      with other general options (ex. --timeout). Those
      restrictions are removed. (see issue #1034)
    - Generate exception when general options such as --user,
      --password, etc. that apply only to the server are used with
      the --mock-server general option. (see issue #1035)
    - Extend the capability to set the default connection in a
      connections file to the connection save command and a
      specific command that will set or clear the default. Since
      the ability to set the default connection was only an option
      in the connection select command it was difficult to find.
      This makes the functionality more visible and more usable.
    - Enhanced test matrix for push-driven runs on GitHub Actions
      to add Python 3.5 on macOS, and removing Python 3.5 minimum
      on Windows.
    - Implement command group subscription that manages the
      creation, viewing and removal of indication subscription on
      WBEM servers. This creates a new command group 'subscription'
      and new commands for adding, removing, and displaying (list)
      indication destination, filter, and subscription instances on
      target WBEM servers. It includes the code for the new
      commands, a set of tests and the documentation for the new
      commands. (see issue #4)
    - Add new MutuallyExclusiveOption class to
      pywbemtools/_click_extensions.py to allow defining command
      options as mutually exclusive. See the class for
      documentation. Modify pywbemcli.py mutually excluseive
      options --server, --name, and --mock-server to use this
      class.
    - Increased minimum version of pywbem to 1.4.0. (issues #1020,
      #991, #1124)
    - Support for Python 3.10: Added Python 3.10 in GitHub Actions
      tests, and in package metadata.
    - Implement an end-end test for the subscription command group.
    - Changed output format for table output of instance enumerate
      --no option to show each key as a column in the table so that
      keys are more readable.
    - The '-v' option now displays better information about
      namespace creation and deletion, particularly in mock
      environments. (related to issue #991)
    - Test: Added testcases for namespace creation and deletion.
      (related to issue #991)
    - Extended the table view of CIM instances to improve
      formatting, allow hiding columns where all property values
      are Null (--show-null option) and allow the table to be wider
      than the terminal width if there is more information than
      could be shown in the terminal width. (see issue #1131)
  * Cleanup:
    - Prepared the development environment for having more than one
      pywbemtools command. As part of that, moved a number of
      utility functions from the 'pywbemtools/pywbemcli'
      subdirectory to the common 'pywbemtools' directory.
    - Moved the environment variable names from being class
      attributes on the PywbemServer class to become constants in
      the config module. (issue #658)
    - Cleanup the test code used as pywbemcli scripts. Named all of
      them with the last part of the name _script.py and modified
      them to use the setup initialization with Python 3.6 and
      greater as well as the old script interface.
    - Modify pywbemcli.py code that copies command line defined
      pywbem_server for reuse in interactive commands to use
      WBEMConnection.copy() rather than deepcopy(). This includes
      adding a copy() method to PywbemServer. This also requires
      that the minimum version of pywbem be set to at least 1.3.0
      where the copy() method was added to pywbem (see issue
      #1030). This fixes issue in python 2.7 with exception and
      avoids copying the FakedWBEMConnection CIM repository.
    - Add list of security issues to be ignored by Makefile
      security test and enable failure of build if security test
      fails. This brings Pywbemtools into line with pywbem
      Makefile.Reordered some of the items in the
      minumum_constraints.txt file to better compare with the
      pywbem file and also commented out all minimum constraints
      for Jupyter and its dependencies since we have no notebooks
      in pywbemcli today. Modified minimum version of typed-ast,
      pylint and astrid to match pywbem and pass saftey tests.
    - Remove the file minimum-constraints-base.txt and put contents
      into minimum-constraints.txt. (see issue #1076)
    - Add instance count tests to end-end testing against
      OpenPegasus.
    - Removed the deprecated option --force from the class delete
      command. It had been created in pywbemtools version 0.8.0 and
      was deprecated in version 0.90 in favor of the
      --include-instances option which performs exactly the same
      function. (see issue # 1142)
- Add pywbemtools-pr1154-click8.patch -- gh#pywbem/pywbemtools#1154

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 22 20:10:47 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 0.9.0
  * Modified the --timestats general option from boolean to choice
    with 3 choices for when statistics are displayed (after each
    command or via a command). See   issue #588)
  * Deprecated the 'server namespaces' and 'server interop'
    commands. Use the new commands 'namespace list' and 'namespace
    interop', respectively. (issue #877)
  * The '--force' / '-f' option of the 'class delete' command has
    been deprecated because its name does not sufficiently make it
    clear that other inhibitors than existing instances of the
    class (such as existing subclasses, or referencing classes)
    will still cause rejection of the command. Use the new
    '--include-instances' option instead. (issue #885)
  * Fixed a ValueError on Windows that was raised when the
    connections file was not on the home drive.
  * Limit click package to < 8.0 because of a) incompatibility with
    python 2.7, b) incompatibility between click 8.0 and
    clicl-repl. (see issues #816 and #817)
  * Limit mock package to lt 4.0.3 to avoid issue issue that causes
    test failure. (see #822)
  * Fix issue caused by mock package version 4.0.3 by creating
    replacements for warnings.warn and warnings.warn_explicit
    functions  and removing the use of the patch decorator in
    pywbemcli.py before the definition of the cli function.  (see
    issue #822)
  * Fixes issue where in pywbemcli the --timeout and --use-pull
    general options were not always correctly included in the new
    object context in interactive mode if they were specified on
    the interactive mode cmd line.
  * Fixed issue in tests with use of stdin and inputting the
    instance path for instance get and instance delete. This was a
    test setup issue and not a code issue. (see issue # 387)
  * Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning
    coveralls-python to <3.0.0.
  * Fix issue where documentation index disappeared when we changed
    the documentation theme (see issue #868)
  * Test: Fixed behavior of 'pdb' test condition, which is supposed
    to stop in the pdb debugger before executing the command
    function, but did immediately leave the debugger again because
    of redirections of the standard streams. The debugger now
    properly comes up when 'pdb' is specified as a condition.
  * Test: Fixed restoring of environment variables that are
    modified by testcases, and displaying of PYWBEMCLI environment
    variables during testing in verbose mode.
  * Change MOFCompiler.add_mof/remove_mof() to only display
    exceptions received if not MOFCompileError since the MOF
    compiler logs all MOFCompileError exceptions. (see issue #395)
  * Increased the minimum pywbem version to 1.2.0.
  * Add new option to class find command (--summary) to display a
    summary of the counts of classes found instead of the full list
    of the classes to make the command more useful for real servers
    that may return many classes for a class find. (see issue #810)
  * Extend the class tree command to optionally provide extra
    information about each class in the tree including 1) the value
    of the Version qualifier if it exists and whether the class is
    Abstract, an Association, or an Indication class. (see. # 817)
  * Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This
    required several changes in package dependencies for
    development.
  * The verbose option ('-v' / '--verbose') now also displays the
    objects that are compiled into a mock environment when setting
    it up.
  * Added 'qualifier delete' command. (see #884)
  * Enabled the tests for Python 3.4 on Windows again - this
    required some changes in the Makefile and constraints files.
  * Added a 'namespace' command group that allows listing, creating
    and deleting CIM namespaces, and showing the Interop namespace.
    The 'server namespaces' and 'server interop' commands that
    provide a subset of that functionality have been deprecated.
    (issue #877)
  * Added commands 'add-mof' and 'remove-mof' for compiling MOF to
    the 'server' command group. (issue #886)
  * Test: Added end2end test capability using the OpenPegasus
    container image on Docker Hub.
  * Added new command group ('statistics') that contols use of
    statistics. See issue #588)
  * Implement command to get statistics from server and present as
    a table #895)
  * Test: Added a unit test module for _utils.py.
  * Added an '--include-instances' option to the 'class delete'
    command that replaces the deprecated '--force' / '-f' option.
    (issue #885)
  * Added an '--include-objects' option to the 'namespace delete'
    command that causes the deletion of instances, classes and
    qualifier types in the targeted namespace before the namespace
    itself is deleted. The objects in the namespace are deleted in
    the correct order of dependencies so that no dangling
    dependencies exist at any point in the operation. (issue #885)
  * Added a ''--dry-run' option to the 'class delete' and
    'namespace delete' commands. If used, it displays the message
    about each deletion with a 'Dry run:' prefix and does not
    perform the actual deletion. (issue #911)
  * Cleaned up the circumvention for Click issue #1231 by upgrading
    the minimum Click version to 7.1.1, where possible. The
    circumvention is still required on Python 2.7 and 3.4 on
    Windows.
  * Clarified in the help text of general option '--pdb' that it
    will be ignored in interactive mode but can be specified on
    each interactive command.
  * Test: Added a check that rejects the use of the 'pdb' test
    condition when the test specifies stdin for the test, because
    the 'pdb' test condition disables the stdin/stdout/stderr
    redirection.
- Release 0.8.0
  * Moving the commands "server profiles" and "serve centralinsts"
    to the new group profiles with the commmand names "profile
    list" and "profile centralinsts" added a command group and
    removed 2 commands from the server command group. (See issue
    #612)
  * The `--deprecation-warnings` / `--no-deprecation-warnings`
    general option has been remamed to `--warn` / `--no-warn`, and
    it now controls the display of all Python warnings.
  * Order display of instance names when the .? is used to pick an
    instance name so the same order of instance names is displayed
    for all versions of Python. (See issue #458 and #459)
  * Pinned prompt-toolkit to <3.0 on Python 3.8 on Windows to avoid
    WinError 995. (See issue #690)
  * Fixed exception when command entered in interactive mode, on
    Python 2. (See issue #224)
  * Test: Default connection file does not get restored in some
    cases during test. (See issue #680)
  * AssociationShrub produces instancename slightly different table
    output in some cases for pywbem 1 vs previous
    versions(inclusion of "/:" prefix). (see issue #704)
  * Test: Fixed attempt in test_class_cmds.py to invoke a
    non-static method on a class object. (see issue #707)
  * Fix help message for "--deprecated" to be unicode so python 2.7
    help does not fail. (see issue #725). This error was added with
    issue #678
  * Upgraded nocasedict and nocaselist packages to pick up fixes.
  * Error in test defintion for qualdecl Indication causes failure
    with pywbem i.1.0 where mocker validates qualifiers scopes.
    (see issue #766)
  * Test: Preventive fix for potential issue with virtualenv
    raising AttributeError during installtest on Python 3.4. (see
    issue #775)
  * Test: Added checking for no expected warning. (see issue #774)
  * Fixed incorrect property order in instance table output, where
    key properties were not ordered before non-key properties but
    ordered along with them. (see issue #782)
  * Docs/Test: Fixed failing install of Jinja2 on Python 3.4 by
    adding it to dev-requirements.txt and pinning it to <2.11 for
    Python 3.4.
  * Test: Aligned qualifier definitions in test MOF with CIM
    Schema. (related to issue #788)
  * Upgraded pywbem to 1.1.1 to pick up fixes and enhancements.
    (see issues #749, #183)
  * Introduced caching of the mock environment used by connection
    definitions in order to speed up the loading of the connection
    definition. The mock environments are stored in directory
    ~/.pywbemcli_mockcache and are automatically managed. The
    pywbemcli --verbose general option can be used to show messages
    about the cache management. (See issue #689)
  * A new approach for the setup of mock scripts has been
    introduced: The mock script defines a `setup(conn, server,
    verbose)` function that is called when the mock environment is
    built. It is not called when the mock environment is
    reinstantiated from the cache. The old approach with setting
    global variables CONN, SERVER, VERBOSE is still supported, but
    the mock environment cannot be cached and will be built every
    time when mock scripts with that setup approach are used. On
    Python <3.5, mock scripts with the `setup()` function are
    rejected, because the functionality to import them is not
    available, and the compile+exec approach does not allow
    executing the setup() function. (See issue #689)
  * Modify general help to display the full path of the default
    connections file. (See issue #660)
  * Move the commands associated with WBEM management profiles from
    the server group to a new profile group. (See issue #612). See
    also Incompatible changes.
  * Add --deprecated/-no-deprecated as a new qualifier filter for
    the class enumerate, class find, and instance count commands.
    Extend the behavior so that for each of the possible filters it
    looks for the qualifier on all of the elements (property,
    method, parameter) in addition to the class itself.  See issue
    #678)
  * Test: Enabled coveralls to run on all Python versions in the
    Travis CI, resulting in a combined coverage for all Python
    versions.
  * For instance display in table format, added the display of the
    units of properties to the table headers. If a property in the
    class has a PUnit or Units qualifier set, the unit is
    translated to a human readable SI unit using the
    pywbem.siunit_obj() function, and appended to the property name
    in square brackets. (See issue #727)
  * Consolidated the warnings control, such that the deprecation
    messages were changed to be issued as Python warnings, and the
    `--warn` / `--no-warn` general options now control the display
    of all Python warnings. If `--warn` is used, all Python
    warnings are shown once. If `--no-warn` is used (default), the
    `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable determines which warnings
    are shown. If that variable is not set, no warnings are shown.
    (See issue #723) Added the 'mock' package and for Python 2.7,
    the 'funcsigs' package as new dependencies.
  * Specifying a property list (--pl option) on instance commands
    with table output formats now uses the order of properties as
    specified in the property list in the output table, instead of
    sorting them. (See issue #702)
  * Allow unsetting general options. Originally the general options
    could be either set specifically by defining them on the
    command line or the default would be enabled. However, in
    interactive mode the need may arise to set an option back to
    its default value (i.e. the equivalent of not including it on
    the command line). This fixes the options so that there is an
    alternative that will will set them to the default value. (see
    issue #350)
  * Converted remaining unittest testcases to pytest. (See issue
    #91)
  * Test: When testing with latest package levels, the package
    versions of indirect dependencies are now also upgraded to the
    latest compatible version from Pypi. (see issue #784)
  * Remove unused NocaseList from __common.py
  * Moved the general option --pull_max_cnt to become part of the
    persistent server definition rather than transient.  This means
    that this parameter is part of the data maintained in the
    server definitionfile and applies to just the server defined.
    (See issue #694)
  * Docs: Improved the description and help texts of the
    connections file and the --connections-file general option in
    various places, for consistency. (Related to issue #708)
  * Move code associated with display_cimobjects() to a separate
    module. This is part of creating table representation of
    classes (See issue #249)
  * Resolved remaining Pylint issues and enforced clean pylint
    checks. (See issue #668)
  * Renamed the default connections file in the user's home
    directory from `pywbemcli_connection_definitions.yaml` to
    `.pywbemcli_connections.yaml`, because it is really an internal
    file not meant for being edited. An existing file with the old
    name is migrated automatically. (See issue #716)
  * Refactor error handling for connections file handlingif there
    are problems with the YAML file or loading the file. Created
    new exceptions for the Connections File and created a unit test
    and function error test. (see issue #661)
  * Separate code to execute test files (ex. setup up mock of
    prompt) from the process of executing files defined by the
    --mock-server general option. The new capability is controled
    by an environment variable "PYWBEMCLI_STARTUP_SCRIPT" that is
    considered intenal to pywbemcli testing.
  * Refactor statistics display to present information consistent
    with the display in pywbem. (see issue # 724)
  * Refactor connections show command and clean up its
    documentation.  (see issue #732)
  * Remove use of pydicti dictionary package in favor of
    NocaseDict.
  * set pylint disable on all uses of pdb.set_trace(). This is an
    issue between the add-on package pdbpp and lint, not pdb.  (see
    issue # 751)
  * Docs: Changed Sphinx theme to sphinx_rtd_theme. (see issue
    #792)
  * Modified the class WbemServerMock in tests/unit/testmock to
    define a WBEM server configuration that includes multiple
    namespaces, a user and an interop namespace to test
    cross-namespace mock. (see issue #183)
