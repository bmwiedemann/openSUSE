Wed Mar 25 14:51:54 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 0.8.0
  - Feature: `HierarchicalMachine` has been rewritten to support parallel states. Please have a look at the ReadMe.md to check what has changed.
    + The previous version can be found in `transitions.extensions.nesting_legacy` for now
  - Feature: Introduced `AsyncMachine` (see discussion #259); note that async HSMs are not yet supported
  - Feature #390: String callbacks can now point to properties and attributes (thanks @jsenecal)
  - Bugfix: Auto transitions are added multiple times when add_states is called more than once
  - Bugfix: Convert state._name from `Enum` into strings in `MarkupMachine` when necessary
  - Bugfix #392: Allow `Machine.add_ordered_transitions` to be called without the initial state (thanks @mkaranki and @facundofc)
  - `GraphMachine` now attempts to fall back to `graphviz` when importing `pygraphviz` fails
  - Not implemented/tested so far (contributions are welcome!):
    + Proper Graphviz support of parallel states
    + AsyncHierachicalMachine
