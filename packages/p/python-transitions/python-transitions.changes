- Update to version 0.8.9
  Bugfix
  * NestedEvent now wraps the machine's scope into partials passed
    to HierarchicalMachine._process. This prevents queued
    transitions from losing their scope.
  Feature
  * (A)Graph.draw function (object returned by
    GraphMachine.get_graph()) can be passed a file/stream object
    as first parameter or None. The later will result in draw
    returning a binary string. (thanks @Blindfreddy).
  * Use id(model) instead of model for machine-bound caches in
    LockedMachine, AsyncMachine and GraphMachine. This might
    influence pickling.

- Update to version 0.8.8
  Bugfix
  * AsyncMachine does not remove models when remove_models is
    called.
  Feature
  * Introduce try/except for finalize callbacks in Machine and
    HierachicalMachine. Thus, errors occurring in finalize
    callbacks will be suppressed and only the original error will
    be raised.
  * Show references in graphs and markup. Introduce
    MarkupMachine.format_references to tweak reference formatting.
  * Introduce Machine.on_exception to handle raised exceptions in
    callbacks.
  * Machine.get_triggers now supports State and Enum as arguments.
  * NestedState and HierachicalMachine.add_states now accept
    (lists of) states and enums as initial parameter.
- Update to version 0.8.7
  * State configuration dictionaries passed to HierarchicalMachine
    can also use states as a keyword to define substates. If
    children and states are present, only children will be
    considered.
  * HierarchicalMachine with custom separator now adds
    is_state partials for nested states (e.g. is_C.s3.a()) to
    models.
  * Use model_attribute consistently in AsyncMachine.
  * HierarchicalMachine now checks whether state_cls, event_cls
    and transition_cls have been subclassed from nested base
    classes (e.g. NestedState) to prevent hard to debug
    inheritance errors
- Update to version 0.8.6
  * HierarchicalMachine.add_states will raise a ValueError when
    an Enum name contains the currently used NestedState.separator.
  Bugfix
  * Reset NestedState._scope when enter/exit callbacks raise an
    exception.
  * Let HierarchicalMachine._get_trigger which is bound to
    model.trigger raise a MachineError for invalid events and
    AttributeError for unknown events.
  Features
  * Introduced HierarchicalMachine.has_trigger to determine
    whether an event is valid for an HSM.
  * AsyncMachine features an event queue dictionary for individual
    models when queued='model'.
  * Machine.remove_model will now also remove model events from
    the event queue when queued=True.
  * Machine.get_transitions and its HSM counterpart now accept
    Enum and State for source and dest.
- Update to version 0.8.5
  * AsyncMachine.switch_model_context is expected to be async now
    for easier integration of async code during model switch.
  * Bugfix #478: Initializing a machine with GraphSupport threw an
    exception when initial was set to a nested or parallel state.
- Update to version 0.8.4
  * Bugfix #477: Model callbacks were not added to a
    LockedHierarchicalMachine when the machine itself served as
    a model.
  * Bugfix #475: Clear collection of tasks to prevent memory leak
    when initializing many models.
  * Feature #474: Added static AsyncMachine.protected_tasks list
    which can be used to prevent transitions to cancel certain
    tasks.
  * Feature: Constructor of HierarchicalMachine now accepts
    substates ('A_1_c') and parallel states (['A', 'B']) as
    initial parameter.
- Update to version 0.8.3
  * Minor release and contains several bugfixes mostly related
    to HierarchicalStateMachine.

Sun Jun 28 09:27:04 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.8.2
  * Improved testing without any optional graphviz package
  * _check_event_result failed when model was in parallel state
  * Only allow explicit dest=None in Machine.add_transition (not
    just falsy) for internal transitions
  * Fix state creation of nested enums
  * HierarchicalGraphMachine did not find/apply styling for
    parallel states
  * Bugfix: Model.trigger now considers the machine's and current
    state's ignore_invalid_triggers attribute and can be called
    with non-existing events
  * Child states may not have been exited when the executed
    transition had been defined on a parent
  * Introduced transitions.extensions.asyncio.AsyncTimeout as a
    state decorator to avoid threads used
    in transitions.extensions.state.Timeout
  * Use sets instead of lists to cache already covered transitions
    in nested state machines
  * Improve handling of unresolved attributes for easier inheritance
  * Refactored AsyncMachine to enable trio/anyio override

- remove pep8 unit tests, those are not useful to execute and
  fail

  * Increased coverage
  * Introduced xdist for parallel testing with pytest

Wed Mar 25 14:51:54 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 0.8.0
  - Feature: `HierarchicalMachine` has been rewritten to support parallel states. Please have a look at the ReadMe.md to check what has changed.
    + The previous version can be found in `transitions.extensions.nesting_legacy` for now
  - Feature: Introduced `AsyncMachine` (see discussion #259); note that async HSMs are not yet supported
  - Feature #390: String callbacks can now point to properties and attributes (thanks @jsenecal)
  - Bugfix: Auto transitions are added multiple times when add_states is called more than once
  - Bugfix: Convert state._name from `Enum` into strings in `MarkupMachine` when necessary
  - Bugfix #392: Allow `Machine.add_ordered_transitions` to be called without the initial state (thanks @mkaranki and @facundofc)
  - `GraphMachine` now attempts to fall back to `graphviz` when importing `pygraphviz` fails
  - Not implemented/tested so far (contributions are welcome!):
    + Proper Graphviz support of parallel states
    + AsyncHierachicalMachine
