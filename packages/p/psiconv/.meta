  <title>EPOC32 PSION 5(MX) File Format Data Conversion Utilities</title>
  <description>This package is meant to make the Psion 5 series of PDAs, as well as
   other small computers running EPOC 32, more usable to non-Windows
   users. The package consists of several parts: * Documentation
   about Psion 5 data formats

* A library that can be linked against applications that have to
   read and write Psion 5 files

* An example command line program that reads Psion files and writes
more commonly used formats</description>
