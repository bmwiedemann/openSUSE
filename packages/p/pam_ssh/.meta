  <title>PAM Module for SSH Authentication</title>
  <description>This module provides single sign-on behavior. The user types a
passphrase when logging in and is allowed in if it decrypts the user s
SSH private key. An ssh-agent is started and keys are added. For the
entire session, the user types no more passwords.</description>
