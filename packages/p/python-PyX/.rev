    <comment>- Update to 0.15:
  * This release introduces a new text engine UnicodeEngine, which enables
    simple typesetting with Type1 fonts without using TeX/LaTeX. The graph
    axis texters have been adjusted to work on the UnicodeEngine, as well.
    The exponential and mixed graph axis texters have been merged into the
    new default texter.
  * PyX' home has been moved to https://pyx-project.org. The source code
    repository has been converted to git and is now hosted at 
    https://github.com/pyx-project/pyx.
- Switch to github tarball and enable tests</comment>
