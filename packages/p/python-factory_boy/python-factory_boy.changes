    FileField and ImageField.
- additional changes from version 2.5.0:
  * Add support for getting/setting factory.fuzzy‘s random state
    (see issue #175, issue #185).
  * Support lazy evaluation of iterables in
    factory.fuzzy.FuzzyChoice (see issue #184).
  * Support non-default databases at the factory level (see issue
    #171)

    non-post_generation, i.e normal fields also available in save()

    issue #103, issue #92, issue #78.
  * Fix overriding deeply inherited attributes (set in one factory,
    overridden in a subclass, used in a sub-sub-class).
- additional changes from version 2.4.0:
  * Add support for factory.fuzzy.FuzzyInteger.step, thanks to
    ilya-pirogov (issue #120)

    #93)
