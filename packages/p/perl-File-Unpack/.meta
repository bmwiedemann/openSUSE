  <title>An strong archive file unpacker, based on mime-types</title>
  <description>File::Unpack is an unpacker for archive files (bz2/gz/zip/tar/cpio/iso/rpm/deb/cab/lzma/7z/rar/...) based on mime-types.  We call it strong, because it is not fooled by file suffixes, or multiply wrapped packages.
It recursivly descends into each archive found until it finally exposes all unpackable payload contents. 
A precise logfile can be written, describing mimetypes and unpack actions.
Most of the known archive file formats are supported. It allows simple shell-script-style plugins to add more.
