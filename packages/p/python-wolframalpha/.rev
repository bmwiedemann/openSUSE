    <comment>- Fix name of the python-more-itertools package.
- version update to 5.0.0
  v5.0.0
  ======
  * Rewrote object model to load objects more automatically.
    API is mostly compatible, but there may be some rare
    uses that may need some adjustment. In particular,
    access to 'children' properties ('pods', 'subpods',
    'assumptions', 'warnings') are exposed as loaded through
    their singular names (without transforms or defaults) but
    exposed as iterable (empty by default) through the plural
    names.
  v4.3.1
  ======
  * Fixed implementation flaw in ``Results.details``.
  * Test coverage is now 100%.
  v4.3.0
  ======
  * Added ``Client.from_env()`` to initialize a client loading the
    API key from the keyring or environment.
  * #13: ``Result`` objects now resolve as False and return empty
    ``info`` and ``pods`` attributes when query was unsuccessful.
  v4.2.0
  ======
  * #28: Adapt to support API change from ``.plainText`` to
    ``.plaintext``.
  * Moved usage guide to source and published through the docs
    and validate the usage with doctests.
  v4.1.1
  ======
  * #26: Fix error when ``always_iterable`` recognizes a dict
    as a list of keys.
  v4.1.0
  ======
  * #21: Adapt to support API change from ``.text`` to ``.plainText``.
  * Refreshed package metadata.
  v4.0.0
  ======
  * Require Python 3.6 or later.
- test the package
