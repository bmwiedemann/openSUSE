  <title>Standalone version of django.utils.feedgenerator, compatible with Py3k</title>
  <description>Feedgenerator-py3k is a standalone version of Django's feedgenerator. It is based on the current Django Version 1.5.dev20120824122350.

The previous feedgenerator 1.2.1 is based on rather old code, and during the port to Python 3 it became obvious that (at least) the handling of unicode strings has to be refactored.

Django has evolved since, so I decided to create a new standalone version which is based upon modern code.</description>
