  <title>PCSC Smart Cards Library</title>
  <description>The purpose of PCSC Lite is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in
a very small form factor for communication with smart cards and
readers. PCSC Lite can be compiled directly for a desired reader driver
or can be used to dynamically allocate/deallocate reader drivers at
runtime (the default behavior).

PCSC Lite uses the same winscard API as used in Windows(R).

Security aware people should read the SECURITY file for possible
vulnerabilities of pcsclite and how to fix them. For information on how
to install drivers please read the DRIVERS file.

Memory cards will be supported through the MCT specification, which is
an APDU like manner sent normally through the SCardTransmit() function.
This functionality is exercised in the driver.</description>
