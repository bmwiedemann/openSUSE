- Version 1.10.1
  * Fixed path repository warning on empty path when using wildcards
  * Fixed superfluous warnings when generating optimized autoloaders

    global directory.
  * Warning: Added a warning when class names are being loaded by a
    PSR-4 or PSR-0 rule only due to classmap optimization, but would
    not otherwise be autoloadable. Composer 2.0 will stop autoloading
    these classes so make sure you fix your autoload configs.
  * Added new funding key to composer.json to describe ways your package's

    composer.lock file will be generated

    persist the repo given in --repository into the composer.json of
    the package being installed
  * Fixed issue where --no-dev autoload generation was excluding some
    packages which should not have been excluded
  * Added support for IPv6 addresses in NO_PROXY
  * Added package homepage display in the show command

    versions and ignore new major versions

    dump-autoload to enable an APCu-caching autoloader, which can be more
    efficient than --classmap-authoritative if you attempt to autoload many

    updates sometimes

- Fix version: indicate alpha release via ~ (tilde)
- Add php5-json dependency

- version 1.0.0-alpha11
  * Added config.platform to let you specify what your target environment
    looks like and make sure you do not inadvertently install dependencies
    that would break it
  * Added exclude-from-classmap in the autoload config that lets you
    ignore sub-paths of classmapped directories, or psr-0/4 directories
    when building optimized autoloaders
  * Added path repository type to install/symlink packages from local paths
  * Added possibility to reference script handlers from within other
    handlers using @script-name to reduce duplication
  * Added suggests command to show what packages are suggested, use -v to
    see more details
  * Added content-hash inside the composer.lock to restrict the warnings
    about outdated lock file to some specific changes in the composer.json
    file
  * Added archive-format and archive-dir config options to specify default
    values for the archive command
  * Added --classmap-authoritative to install, update, require, remove and
    dump-autoload commands, forcing the optimized classmap to be
    authoritative
  * Added -A / --with-dependencies to the validate command to allow
    validating all your dependencies recursively
  * Added --strict to the validate command to treat any warning as an
    error that then returns a non-zero exit code
  * Added a dependency on composer/semver, which is the externalized lib
    for all the version constraints parsing and handling
  * Added support for classmap autoloading to load plugin classes and
    script handlers
  * Added bin-compat config option that if set to full will create .bat
    proxy for binaries even if Compoesr runs in a linux VM
  * Added SPDX 2.0 support, and externalized that in a
    composer/spdx-licenses lib
  * Added warnings when the classmap autoloader finds duplicate classes
  * Added --file to the archive command to choose the filename
  * Added Ctrl+C handling in create-project to cancel the operation cleanly
  * Fixed version guessing to use ^ always, default to stable versions,
    and avoid versions that require a higher php version than you have
  * Fixed the lock file switching back and forth between old and new URL
    when a package URL is changed and many people run updates
  * Fixed partial updates updating things they shouldn't when the current
    vendor dir was out of date with the lock file
  * Fixed PHAR file creation to be more reproducible and always generate
    the exact same phar file from a given source
  * Fixed issue when checking out git branches or tags that are also the
    name of a file in the repo
  * Many minor fixes and documentation additions and UX improvements
