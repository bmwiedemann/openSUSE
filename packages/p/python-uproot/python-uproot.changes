- Disable building against python3.11 until numba -- and dask -- is
  compatible.
- Disable 32-bit builds since python-awkward no longer builds for
  those archs.

- update to 5.0.3:
  * feat: Infrastructure for writing of RNTuple (incomplete
    functionality)
  * feat: [WIP] RNTuple Basic Writing
  * fix: an uproot.dask test was wrong; revealed by new dask-
    awkward.
  * fix: separate AwkwardForth machine for each TBranch context.
  * fix: separate ZstdDecompressor for each thread.
  * fix: uproot.dask: Protect against `branches=None` in
    `project_columns`
  * fix: AsStridedObjects.awkward_form was still including the
    '@' members.
  * fix: protect Uproot's 'project_columns' from Dask node names.
  * Uproot version 5 has a few major new features, one removal
    (`uproot.lazy`), and is based on Awkward Array version 2
    instead of version 1.
  * @kkothari2001 upgraded Uproot from Awkward version 1 to
    version 2, the major part of which was replacing
    `uproot.lazy`, which is based on Awkward 1's virtual and
    partitioned lazy arrays, with the new Dask collection, dask-
    awkward. The entry point for this function is `uproot.dask`.
  * @kkothari2001 also simplified Uproot's Pandas backend, which
    used to "explode" ragged arrays from ROOT into Pandas
    DataFrames with a non-trivial MultiIndex. Now, it takes
    advantage of awkward-pandas to put ragged (and more complex)
    Awkward Arrays directly into Pandas columns.
  * If you want the old behavior, you can read data using
    `library="ak"` to get an Awkward Array, and use
    ak.to_dataframe to "explode" the data into a MultiIndex.
  * @aryan26roy added a new code path to the TTree-reading
    routines to read them with AwkwardForth instead of pure
    Python. Users won't see any _interface_ changes due to this
    code, but the performance of reading TBranches with
    `AsObject` or `AsStrings` Interpretations should be orders of
    magnitude faster. For example, `std::vector>` reading is now
    400× faster.
  * @Moelf added a complete reader of RNTuple data with most of
    an RNTuple-writer in an unmerged pull request (#705).
    Although the RNTuple format is still in development, this is
    a very good start at reading RNTuple data, whose structure is
    a close match to Awkward Arrays (so the translation is more
    one-to-one than it is for TTrees, for instance).
  * feat: move to hatchling
  * feat: `from_map` like optimization for dask arrays
  * feat: Finalizing AwkwardForth reader for Uproot
  * feat: implemented NON-memberwise deserialization for AsMap.
  * feat: Added column_projection optimization
  * feat: support categorical axes on boost histograms
  * feat: warn about TBranch name, alias name conflict.
  * feat: any Mapping assigned to a WritableDirectory is
    interpreted as a TTree or failure, no fall-through.
  * feat: add 'interp_options' mechanism and ak_add_doc.
  * feat: Use awkward pandas, instead of the existing code that
    explodes Pandas Dataframes
  * feat: made 'very optional' arguments keyword-only
  * feat: adjust for name change in scikit-hep/awkward#1919.
  * fix: depend on packaging, not setuptools vendored packaging
  * fix: Avoid triggering temporary dask-awkward/awkward
    incompatibility.
  * fix: Do not write incorrect fSumw2 in histograms (v5).
  * fix: Fixes uproot.dask bug with empty branches
  * fix: Use `from_map` optimization for delayed numpy arrays and
    add tests with empty branches for the same
  * fix: use ctx manager to ensure resources are freed
  * fix: ReadOnlyDirectory should provide the largest abs(cycle)
    when cycle is unspecified, not the largest cycle.
  * fix: regularize ROOT type aliases to C fundamental type
    names.
  * fix: avoid empty TBasket issue in embedded TBasket
  * fix: don't use Awkward in test_0751 that doesn't need it
  * fix: working TList serialization
  * fix: histogram weights not handled correctly in hist / boost
    conversion
  * perf: streamline metadata handling for TBranch name lookup
    and uproot.dask
  * fix: ensure AwkwardForth fallback path is tested without
    history.
  * fix: all AwkwardForth Forms now agree with awkward_form
    method output.
  * fix: Uproot tests now work with Awkward 2.0.0.
