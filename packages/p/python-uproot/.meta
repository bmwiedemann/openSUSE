  <title>ROOT I/O in pure Python and Numpy</title>
  <description>Uproot is a reader and a writer of the ROOT file format using only Python and
Numpy. Unlike the standard C++ ROOT implementation, Uproot is only an I/O
library, primarily intended to stream data into machine learning libraries in
Python. It uses Numpy to cast blocks of data from the ROOT file as Numpy
arrays.
