    <comment>HAS TO GO TOGETHER WITH sr#1084806!

- Update to version 5.0.7:
  * Previously, uproot.dask would default to step_size=&quot;100 MB&quot; if
    open_files=True and whole-file-steps (limit on step size) if
    open_files=False. Now both open_files cases default to
    steps_per_file=1 (whole-file-steps) for uniformity.
  * feat: add in capability for blindly splitting files into
    chunks for dask (gh#scikit-hep/uproot5#876).
- Drop tests.tar.xz as additional Source as test files are now
  included with upstream pypi tarball; drop associated _service.
- Update required version of scikit-hep-testdata to 0.4.30 for
  tests.
- Disable building against python3.11 until numba -- and dask --
  is compatible.
- Disable 32-bit builds since python-awkward no longer builds for
  those archs.
- Clean up SPEC file
- update to 5.0.3:
  * feat: Infrastructure for writing of RNTuple (incomplete
    functionality)
  * feat: [WIP] RNTuple Basic Writing
  * fix: an uproot.dask test was wrong; revealed by new dask-
    awkward.
  * fix: separate AwkwardForth machine for each TBranch context.
  * fix: separate ZstdDecompressor for each thread.
  * fix: uproot.dask: Protect against `branches=None` in
    `project_columns`
  * fix: AsStridedObjects.awkward_form was still including the
    '@' members.
  * fix: protect Uproot's 'project_columns' from Dask node names.
  * Uproot version 5 has a few major new features, one removal
    (`uproot.lazy`), and is based on Awkward Array version 2
    instead of version 1.
  * @kkothari2001 upgraded Uproot from Awkward version 1 to
    version 2, the major part of which was replacing
    `uproot.lazy`, which is based on Awkward 1's virtual and
    partitioned lazy arrays, with the new Dask collection, dask-
    awkward. The entry point for this function is `uproot.dask`.
  * @kkothari2001 also simplified Uproot's Pandas backend, which
    used to &quot;explode&quot; ragged arrays from ROOT into Pandas
    DataFrames with a non-trivial MultiIndex. Now, it takes
    advantage of awkward-pandas to put ragged (and more complex)
    Awkward Arrays directly into Pandas columns.
  * If you want the old behavior, you can read data using
    `library=&quot;ak&quot;` to get an Awkward Array, and use
    ak.to_dataframe to &quot;explode&quot; the data into a MultiIndex.
  * @aryan26roy added a new code path to the TTree-reading
    routines to read them with AwkwardForth instead of pure
    Python. Users won't see any _interface_ changes due to this
    code, but the performance of reading TBranches with
    `AsObject` or `AsStrings` Interpretations should be orders of
    magnitude faster. For example, `std::vector&gt;` reading is now
    400× faster.
  * @Moelf added a complete reader of RNTuple data with most of
    an RNTuple-writer in an unmerged pull request (#705).
    Although the RNTuple format is still in development, this is
    a very good start at reading RNTuple data, whose structure is
    a close match to Awkward Arrays (so the translation is more
    one-to-one than it is for TTrees, for instance).
  * feat: move to hatchling
  * feat: `from_map` like optimization for dask arrays
  * feat: Finalizing AwkwardForth reader for Uproot
  * feat: implemented NON-memberwise deserialization for AsMap.
  * feat: Added column_projection optimization
  * feat: support categorical axes on boost histograms
  * feat: warn about TBranch name, alias name conflict.
  * feat: any Mapping assigned to a WritableDirectory is
    interpreted as a TTree or failure, no fall-through.
  * feat: add 'interp_options' mechanism and ak_add_doc.
  * feat: Use awkward pandas, instead of the existing code that
    explodes Pandas Dataframes
  * feat: made 'very optional' arguments keyword-only
  * feat: adjust for name change in scikit-hep/awkward#1919.
  * fix: depend on packaging, not setuptools vendored packaging
  * fix: Avoid triggering temporary dask-awkward/awkward
    incompatibility.
  * fix: Do not write incorrect fSumw2 in histograms (v5).
  * fix: Fixes uproot.dask bug with empty branches
  * fix: Use `from_map` optimization for delayed numpy arrays and
    add tests with empty branches for the same
  * fix: use ctx manager to ensure resources are freed
  * fix: ReadOnlyDirectory should provide the largest abs(cycle)
    when cycle is unspecified, not the largest cycle.
  * fix: regularize ROOT type aliases to C fundamental type
    names.
  * fix: avoid empty TBasket issue in embedded TBasket
  * fix: don't use Awkward in test_0751 that doesn't need it
  * fix: working TList serialization
  * fix: histogram weights not handled correctly in hist / boost
    conversion
  * perf: streamline metadata handling for TBranch name lookup
    and uproot.dask
  * fix: ensure AwkwardForth fallback path is tested without
    history.
  * fix: all AwkwardForth Forms now agree with awkward_form
    method output.
  * fix: Uproot tests now work with Awkward 2.0.0.
- drop uproot-use-packaging-module.patch (upstream)
- Update to version 4.3.4:
  * fixed uninitialized attributes of ReadOnlyDirectory
    [gh#scikit-hep/uproot4#661].
- Refresh uproot-use-packaging-module.patch to correct use of
  packaging.version.
- Update to version 4.3.3:
  * Fixed an O(n²) scaling bug in getting data from TDirectories
    so that now it's O(n) [gh#scikit-hep/uproot4#639].
- Update to version 4.3.0:
  * Added a TMatrixTSym model (long stalled PR):
    gh#scikit-hep/uproot4#484.
  * Restored the argument list of Interpretation.awkward_form, a
    public function: PR gh#scikit-help/uproot4#618.
- Refresh tests tarball with updated dir from git repository.
- Update to version 4.2.2:
  * Restore performance hack for AsArray(True, False,
    AsVector(False, dtype)) [gh#scikit-hep/uproot4#572].
- Update to version 4.2.1:
  * Added a rule to skip parsing Float16/Double32 TBranch titles
    if the title is not parsable (and just assume default number
    of bits) [gh#scikit-hep/uproot4#561].
  * Removed references to deprecated distutils and Pandas
    Int64Index [gh#scikit-hep/uproot4#564].
  * Removed the rule that interpreted fBits as 1 byte (it's 4
    bytes everywhere except in some branches of some Delphes
    files) [gh#scikit-hep/uproot4#570].
- Add uproot-use-packaging-module.patch -- Use packaging module
  directly instead of calling it via setup.extern; the latter does
  not work on openSUSE directly.
- Introduce Requires and BuildRequires (for tests) on
  python-packaging in light of above patch.
- Update tests.tar.xz to tagged 4.2.1 version.
- Update to version 4.2.0:
  * Drop Python2isms from the codebase:
    [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#526].
  * Make writing to Python file handles work (fixed a
    half-finished, forgotten implementation):
    [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#538].
  * Fix cut jagged-array corner-case in library=&quot;pd&quot;.
  * Fix a case in which the instance version is 0, but the
    streamer version is not: [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#537].
  * Fix uproot.WritableTTree.extend when the metadata needs to be
    rewritten: [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#547].
  * When checking to see if something in file[&quot;name&quot;] = something
    is an Awkward Array or Pandas DataFrame for creating a TTree,
    also check for superclasses (the whole mro):
    [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#557].
- Sync tests tarball with version 4.2.0.
- Update to version 4.1.9:
  * [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#523] docs: add pfackeldey as a
    contributor for code.
  * [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#522] [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit
    autoupdate.
  * [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#506] add uproot.model.TTable.data
    getter.
  * [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#521] Dynamic classes can’t be ABC
    subclasses, such as Sequence.
  * [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#519] [MemmapSource] Remove
    unnecessary(?) copies.
  * [gh#scikit-hep/uproot#517] Be more careful about identifying
    pd.DataFrame.
- Update tests.tar.xz to version 4.1.9.
- Disable an additional test on 32-bit that depends on 64-bit long.
- Update to v4.0.11
  * see https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html
- Update runtime and builtime requirements:
   * Add awkward as recommendation (upstream: &quot;highly recommended&quot;)
   * Add other optional package as suggestions
   * BuildRequire what is available and used for offline tests
- Skip some pandas tests which test for 64bit types on 32bit builds
- use the pytest network mark in order to skip network tests on obs
- add a network mark to test_0220 -- gh#scikit-hep/uproot4#396
- Disable builds for python 3.6: no numpy.
- Initial package.
- Package tests subdir from upstream git since they are missing
  from the PyPI src tarballs.
