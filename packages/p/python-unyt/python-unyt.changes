- Update to 2.8.0:
  * Dropped support for Python 3.5.
  * Add delta_degC and delta_degF units to support temperature difference arithmetic. See PR #152. Thank you to Lee Johnston (@l-johnston on GitHub) for the contribution.
  * Fix an issue where a subsequent load of the unit registry with units that are equal but not identical leads to a crash. See PR #158. Thank you to Matthew Turk (@matthewturk on GitHub) for the initial bug report and fix.
  * Add force unit kip and pressure unit psi. Thank you to P. Talley (@otaithleigh on GitHub) for the contribution. See PR #162.
  * Fix an issue where arithmetic operations on units defined in different registries and having the conversion defined in one direction would lead to a crash. See PR #164. Thank you to Clément Robert (@neutrinoceros on GitHub) for the initial bug report and fix. 
- Do not build for Python 2, since no longer supported by upstream, and also
  do not build for Python 3.6, due to no NumPy.
