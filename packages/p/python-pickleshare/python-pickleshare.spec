%description
PickleShare - a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency support

Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike shelve,
many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a value in
database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the same database.

Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. Hence
the "database" is a directory where *all* files are governed by PickleShare.

This module is certainly not ZODB, but can be used for low-load
(non-mission-critical) situations where tiny code size trumps the
advanced features of a "real" object database.
