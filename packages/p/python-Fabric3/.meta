  <title>Fabric is a simple, Pythonic tool for remote execution and deployment</title>
  <description>Fabric3 is a fork of `Fabric &lt;http://fabfile.org&gt;`_ to provide compatility
with Python 3.4+. The port still works with Python 2.7.

The goal is to stay 100% compatible with the original Fabric.  Any new releases
of Fabric will also be released here.  Please file issues for any differences
you find. Known differences are `documented on github
&lt;https://github.com/mathiasertl/fabric/&gt;`.

To find out what's new in this version of Fabric, please see `the changelog
&lt;http://fabfile.org/changelog.html&gt;`_ of the original Fabric.

For more information, please see the Fabric website or execute ``fab --help``.
