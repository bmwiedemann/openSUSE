  <title>Python Bindings for TagLib</title>
  <description>TagPy is a set of Python bindings for Scott Wheeler's TagLib. It builds upon
Boost.Python, a wrapper generation library which is part of the renowned Boost
set of C++ libraries.

Just like TagLib, TagPy can:
* read and write ID3 tags of version 1 and 2, with many supported frame types
  for version 2 (in MPEG Layer 2 and MPEG Layer 3, FLAC and MPC),
* access Xiph Comments in Ogg Vorbis Files and Ogg Flac Files,
* access APE tags in Musepack and MP3 files.

All these features have their own specific interfaces, but TagLib's generic tag
reading and writing mechanism is also supported.
