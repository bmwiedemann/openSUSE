  <title>Elegant, simple, and clean dock</title>
  <description>Plank is meant to be the simplest dock on the planet.
The goal is to provide just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more.
It is, however, a library which can be extended to create other dock programs with more advanced features.</description>
