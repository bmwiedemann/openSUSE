  <title>Replaces actual time with simulated time</title>
  <description>This module was created to enable test suites to test code at specific points
in time. Specifically it overrides localtime, gmtime and time at compile time
and then relies on the user supplying a mock time via set_relative_time,
set_absolute_time or set_fixed_time to alter future calls to gmtime,time or
localtime.
