%description
Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessor/mutators to class data.
That is, if you want to store something about your class as a whole
(instead of about a single object). This data is then inherited by your
subclasses and can be overridden.

For example:

  Pere::Ubu->mk_classdata('Suitcase');

will generate the method Suitcase() in the class Pere::Ubu.

This new method can be used to get and set a piece of class data.

  Pere::Ubu->Suitcase('Red');
  $suitcase = Pere::Ubu->Suitcase;

The interesting part happens when a class inherits from Pere::Ubu:

  package Raygun;
  use base qw(Pere::Ubu);
  
  # Raygun's suitcase is Red.
  $suitcase = Raygun->Suitcase;

Raygun inherits its Suitcase class data from Pere::Ubu.

Inheritance of class data works analogous to method inheritance. As long as
Raygun does not "override" its inherited class data (by using Suitcase() to
set a new value) it will continue to use whatever is set in Pere::Ubu and
inherit further changes:

  # Both Raygun's and Pere::Ubu's suitcases are now Blue
  Pere::Ubu->Suitcase('Blue');

However, should Raygun decide to set its own Suitcase() it has now
"overridden" Pere::Ubu and is on its own, just like if it had overridden a
method:

  # Raygun has an orange suitcase, Pere::Ubu's is still Blue.
  Raygun->Suitcase('Orange');

Now that Raygun has overridden Pere::Ubu further changes by Pere::Ubu no
longer effect Raygun.

  # Raygun still has an orange suitcase, but Pere::Ubu is using Samsonite.
  Pere::Ubu->Suitcase('Samsonite');
