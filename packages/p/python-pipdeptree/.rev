    <comment>- Update to 2.2.1:
  * Fix --user-only and --freeze flags which were broken after the last release.
  * Fix for compatibility with new version of graphviz (&gt;= 0.18.1).
  * Fix pipdeptree to work with pip version 21.3. The _internal pip api that was being used earlier is now replaced with new functions. (PR #154)
  * JSON output is sorted alphabetically to make it deterministic
  * Fix --freeze option due to breaking changes in pip's internal api in version &gt; 21.1.1
  * Include license file in dist package
  * Support for running in the context of a virtualenv (without installing pipdeptree inside the virtualenv)
  * Avoid crash when rendering cyclic dependencies
  * Fix graphviz (dot file) output
  * Handle a (rare) case while guessing version of a package
  * Improve integration tests 
- Remove the hacked together virtualenv that was 2.7 based, since it is no
  longer needed.
- Add virtualenv to BuildRequires.</comment>
