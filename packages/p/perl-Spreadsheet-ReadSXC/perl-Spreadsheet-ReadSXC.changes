   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Spreadsheet-ReadSXC/Changes

  0.32  2020-10-06
      * Eliminate a warning when reading a numeric format without a defined
        number of digits, reported by Tux
  0.31  2020-10-03
      * No code changes, no need to upgrade
      * Change code to work around an ambiguity in Perl to placate Filter::signatures
        / Filter::Simple. "-s _" could also be parsed as "-(s _foo_bar_g)"
        by Filter::Simple.
  0.30  2020-10-02
      * No code changes, no need to upgrade
      * Remove "use XML::Parser;" line, which was not used anymore in the code.
        Spotted by MANWAR
      * This version will be (re)released as 1.00 if the smoke tests come up green
  0.29  2020-09-30
      * Make the test for the error message on non-existing files more lax.
        This addresses RT #133432
  0.28  2020-09-29
      * Require Filter::signatures 0.16 to fix Perl versions below 5.20
      * No upgrade necessary if things already work for you
  0.27  2020-09-28
      * Defang resource intensive test
      * Eliminate "undef" warning when trying to get the active sheet of a
        workbook that does not define an active sheet (GH #3)
  0.26  2020-09-28
      * This needs minimum Perl version 5.010
      * When reading a sheet in readonly mode, more aggressively reuse cell
        objects for repeated cells
      * Construct a cell once, and if it is repeated, clone it if not in readonly
        mode.
        These two changes speed up the parsing of some sheets with many repeated
        cells vastly.
      * Properly handle ODS files without a settings.xml (GH#2)
  0.25  2020-09-27
      This release has major changes and will be promoted to 1.0 if there are
      no major breaks.
      * Added (proper) parsing of ODS files
      * Added support for formats
      * Added support for hidden cells, merged cells
      * Split up parsing and classes into separate files
      * Spreadsheet::ReadSXC now uses Spreadsheet::ParseODS
      * Added ->is_sheet_hidden(), ->get_print_areas, ->get_hyperlink()
        ->is_col_hidden(), ->tab_color(), ->table_styles(), ->filename(),

  0.24  2019-10-08
      - Fix parsing the text of cells that only contain "0"
        These were returned as undef, instead of 0 unless the StandardCurrency
        option was used.
      - Fix parsing multiple sheets. If the first cell of the new table was empty,
        the last defined value of the old table was used instead, if the
        real (instead of formatted) values were used.
