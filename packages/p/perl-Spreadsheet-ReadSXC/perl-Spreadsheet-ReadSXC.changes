      - Fix parsing the text of cells that only contain "0"
        These were returned as undef, instead of 0 unless the StandardCurrency
        option was used.
      - Fix parsing multiple sheets. If the first cell of the new table was empty,
        the last defined value of the old table was used instead, if the
        real (instead of formatted) values were used.
