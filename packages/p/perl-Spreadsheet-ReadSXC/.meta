  <title>Extract OpenOffice 1.x spreadsheet data</title>
  <description>Spreadsheet::ReadSXC extracts data from OpenOffice 1.x spreadsheet files
(.sxc). It exports the function read_sxc() which takes a filename and an
optional reference to a hash of options as arguments and returns a
reference to a hash of references to two-dimensional arrays. The hash keys
correspond to the names of worksheets in the OpenOffice workbook. The
two-dimensional arrays correspond to rows and cells in the respective
spreadsheets. If you don't like this because the order of sheets is not
preserved in a hash, read on. The 'OrderBySheet' option provides an array
of hashes instead.

If you prefer to unpack the .sxc file yourself, you can use the function
read_xml_file() instead and pass the path to content.xml as an argument. Or
you can extract the XML string from content.xml and pass the string to the
function read_xml_string(). Both functions also take a reference to a hash
of options as an optional second argument.</description>
