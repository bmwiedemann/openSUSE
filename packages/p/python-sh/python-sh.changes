- Update to 1.11
  * partially applied functions with functools.partial have been fixed for _out and _err callbacks #160

  * deprecated _with contexts #195
  * _timeout_signal allows you to specify your own signal to kill a timed-out process with. use a constant from the signal stdlib module. #171
  * signal exceptions can now be caught by number or name. SignalException_9 == SignalException_SIGKILL
  * child processes that timeout via _timeout raise sh.TimeoutException instead of sh.SignalExeception_9 #172
  * fixed help(sh) from the python shell and pydoc sh from the command line. #173
  * program names can no longer be shadowed by names that sh.py defines internally. removed the requirement of trailing underscores for programs that could have their names shadowed, like id.
  * memory optimization when a child process's stdin is a newline-delimted string and our bufsize is newlines
  * feature, _done special keyword argument that accepts a callback to be called when the command completes successfully #185
  * bugfix for being unable to print a baked command in python3+ #176

  * added sh.pushd with context which takes a directory name and changes to that directory for the duration of that with context. PR #206
  * tests now include python 3.4 if available. tests also stop on the first python that suite that fails.
  * SIGABRT, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGPIPE, SIGSYS have been added to the list of signals that throw an exception PR #201
  * "callable" builtin has been faked for python3.1, which lacks it.
  * "direct" option added to _piped special keyword argument, which allows sh to hand off a process's stdout fd directly to another process, instead of buffering its stdout internally, then handing it off. #119
