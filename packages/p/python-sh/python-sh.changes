    necessary in order to release held resources, for example a
    process pool

  * deprecated _with contexts #195
  * _timeout_signal allows you to specify your own signal to kill a timed-out process with. use a constant from the signal stdlib module. #171
  * signal exceptions can now be caught by number or name. SignalException_9 == SignalException_SIGKILL
  * child processes that timeout via _timeout raise sh.TimeoutException instead of sh.SignalExeception_9 #172
  * fixed help(sh) from the python shell and pydoc sh from the command line. #173

  * tests now include python 3.4 if available. tests also stop on the first python that suite that fails.
  * SIGABRT, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGPIPE, SIGSYS have been added to the list of signals that throw an exception PR #201
  * "callable" builtin has been faked for python3.1, which lacks it.
  * "direct" option added to _piped special keyword argument, which allows sh to hand off a process's stdout fd directly to another process, instead of buffering its stdout internally, then handing it off. #119
