  <title>Sprintf-like string formatting capabilities with arbitrary format definitions</title>
  <description>String::Format lets you define arbitrary printf-like format sequences to be
expanded. This module would be most useful in configuration files and
reporting tools, where the results of a query need to be formatted in a
particular way. It was inspired by mutt's index_format and related
directives
(see &lt;URL:http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-6.html#index_format&gt;).</description>
