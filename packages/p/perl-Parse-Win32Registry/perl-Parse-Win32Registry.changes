- updated to 1.1
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Parse-Win32Registry/Changes

  ** 1.1 2020-09-19

  Added fix for errors decoding registry timestamps. (This was due to the
  interpretation of dates in timegm changing in recent versions of Perl.)
  Thanks to B.M.W. and Slaven Rezic for their help with this.

  Updated as_regedit_export to handle undefined REG_SZ values.

- Add fix-time-local.patch to make it work after 2019

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 26 18:03:57 UTC 2012 - Greg.Freemyer@gmail.com

- ran spec-cleaner
- update to v1.0
	Added support for decoding System Mandatory Label ACEs (a feature
	introduced with Windows Vista) and added the command line script
	regml.pl for listing keys with explicit System Mandatory Label ACEs
	set. Improved handling of security descriptors.

	Tidied up various aspects of the wxWidgets and GTK applications, and
	harmonised functionality between the various pairs of equivalent
	programs, with a minor difference being the wxWidgets applications
	following Windows keyboard shortcut conventions while the GTK
	applications following Linux keyboard shortcut conventions.

	The get_data method of Value objects now returns the unpacked integer
	value for REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN value types instead of the original
	packed binary data.

	Added support for values with 'big data'. Thanks to Harlan Carvey for
	all his help with this.
