    [Fixed]

    - Fixed WithStackTrace proxy to remove arguments in-place instead of
      always stringifying the exception object immediately. This means we
      need to handle different exception objects differently, but it also
      means a better log message. Thanks @larryl and @GrantStreetGroup for
      submitting this fix! [Github #100]

    [Added]

    - Added a parameter to show stack trace arguments when using the
      WithStackTrace proxy. Since these arguments may contain sensitive
      information, they are now removed by default. Thanks @sam-ng and
      @GrantStreetGroup for submitting this patch! [Github #97]

    [Fixed]
    - Fixed Multiplex adapter losing context details. Normally, the
      Log::Any::Proxy joins all of the arguments passed in to a logging
      method if the adapter it's using does not support structured data.
      Multiplex supports structured data, but one of the adapters inside
      may not. So, the Multiplex adapter must also perform this
      concatenation to avoid losing those additional arguments.
      Thanks @jrubinator and @GrantStreetGroup for discovering this bug
      and providing the fix! [Github #95]

    - Fixed Syslog adaptor losing ident and facility information if
      another library wrongly calls Sys::Syslog::closelog(). This is not
      a perfect solution, but a perfect solution can only ever be to fix
      the close that's calling closelog() :P
      Thanks to Tom Christiansen and @GrantStreetGroup for reporting this
      issue and providing the fix.

    - Fixed tests failing due to missing Devel::Stacktrace. This is an
      optional module, so we do not explicitly depend on it. Thanks

      - Added 'Capture' adapter for capturing log messages in an array or
        running an arbitrary callback. This makes it easier to test log
        messages, collect messages from a certain scope for later display.
        Thanks @nrdvana! [Github #77]
  
      - Added Log::Any::Adapter 'get' class method to get an adapter for
        a category. This allows bypassing the Proxy and using the Adapter
        directly. Doing so breaks all the features enabled by a Proxy, and
        so should only be used in special circumstances (definitely not in
        CPAN modules). Thanks @nrdvana! [Github #78]
  
      - Added 'Multiplex' adapter for directing log output to one or more
        Log::Any adapters. This allows, for example, basic logging to
        Stderr and logging to a remote Syslogd or Elastic. Thanks
        @jrubinator and @GrantStreetGroup for contributing this!

      - Fixed version of Log::Any::Adapter::Syslog so that installing it
        will also install the rest of Log-Any.
  
      - Fixed method aliasing in Log::Any::Adapter::Syslog for "error"
        log method. Thanks @legaultp for the patch!
  
  1.051     2017-08-06 20:41:53-05:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - LOG_ANY_DEFAULT_ADAPTER now correctly logs to the given adapter.
  
        Previously, if no other adapter was set, Log::Any used it's
        default, super-fast "Null" proxy that simply drops all messages
        without checking adapters. Now Log::Any will correctly detect the
        environment variable and create the correct, normal proxy object.
  
        Thanks @tm604 for the report and @mephinet for the patch!
  
  1.050     2017-08-03 22:28:37-05:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Added]
  
      - Added structured logging to easily log single hash references in
        a parsable format. Thanks @mephinet!
  
      - Added contextual logging to attach information to log messages
        based on the current context.
  
        For example, all log messages being generated by a particular HTTP
        request could be logged with the URL, even if they're from a part
        of the application that doesn't know what HTTP is.
  
        This is very similar to Log::Log4perl's Mapped Diagnostic Context.
  
        Thanks @mephinet!

      [Fixed]
  
      - Fixed backwards-compatibility with users using the Unix::Syslog
        macros in Log::Any::Adapter::Syslog. This requires that the user
        have Unix::Syslog installed (which Log::Any does not explicitly
        depend on).
  
      - Log level aliases are now case-insensitive to match the regular
        log levels. Prior to this, "WARNING", "Warning", and "warning"
        would all work, but "WARN", and "Warn" would not, only "warn".
        Thanks to @0x62ash for reporting this issue. [Github #55]
  
      - Invalid log levels for the File, Stderr, and Stdout adapters now
        result in a warning, and the default level of "trace" is used.
        Previously, no warning would be issued and no logs would be
        generated. Thanks to @0x62ash for reporting this issue. [Github

      [Changed]
  
      - A new default log proxy (Log::Any::Proxy::Null) is used when there
        are no adapters configured (and so no place for logs to go). This
        proxy does no processing and is about 1000% percent faster on my
        laptop.

      [Changed]
  
      - The default formatter now replaces a code reference argument with
        the results of calling the code reference ONLY when it is the first
        argument (in place of a format string).  Code references in
        subsequent arguments (to sprintf) are not executed, as this would
        break backwards compatibility.
  
      [Documented]
  
      - Noted that repeatedly calling 'set' to set an adapter without calling
        'remove' or using the 'lexically' feature will leak memory.

      - The default formatter now expands code references.  If the first
        argument is a code reference, it is expanded and returned.  If an
        argument to "sprintf" style formatting is a code reference, it is
        expanded.
  
      [Changed]
  
      - The File adapter now opens files with the ":utf8" layer.  It also
        takes a 'binmode' attribute to change the default.
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - does_not_contain_ok test adapter function now gives proper
        diagnostic message
  
      - all diagnostic messages that output the captured log now
        correctly dump the log with pretty formatting
  
      [Documented]
  
      - documented the 'proxy_class' argument to `get_logger`

      [Fixed]
  
      - Log::Any::Adapter::Test passed through all constructor arguments,
        which could be fatal when mocking adapters without all key-value
        pairs (like Log::Any::Adapter::File); now this only passes through
        the category and ignores other parameters when used as an
        adapter class override.
  
  1.03      2015-01-01 22:39:41-05:00 America/New_York
  
      [Changed]
  
      - Log::Any::Proxy concatenates arguments to basic logging functions
        with a space character before passing them to adapters as a single
        string.  This ensures consistency across adapters that handle
        multiple arguments differently.

      [Added]
  
      - Logging now goes via a Log::Any::Proxy object instead of directly to
        an adapter. This allows easy customization of the message production.
  
      - File, Stdout, and Stderr adapters now support a minimum
        log level parameter.
  
      [Changed]
  
      - Removed dead code from Log::Any::Adapter::Base; particularly this
        was the formatting code, since this is now handled by
        Log::Any::Proxy.
  
      [Fixed]
  
      - File will flock the handle when writing (if flock is avaiable).
  
      - Won't die if adapters aren't loadable modules as long as they
        provide a constructor.  This allows using private adapters
        defined in another file.
  
      [Documented]
  
      - Revised docs for creating adapters
  
      - Fixed typos and improved docs for Log::Any::Adapter::Util; removed
        stub docs for modules that didn't need it.
  
      [Deprecated]
  
      - Deprecated some methods in Log::Any::Adapter::Util
  
      [Internal]
  
      - Merged Log-Any and Log-Any-Adapter distributions; reduces code
        duplication and ensures Log::Any and adapter framework stay in sync
  
      - Eliminates all non-core dependencies (as of Perl 5.8.1), including
        Capture::Tiny, Devel::GlobalDestruction and Guard
