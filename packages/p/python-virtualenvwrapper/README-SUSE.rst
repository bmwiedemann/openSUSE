Packaging of virtualenvwrapper for SUSE distros
===============================================

What upstream considers ``/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`` and
``/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper_lazy_.sh`` is packaged as
``/usr/bin/virtualenvwrapper`` and ``/usr/bin/virtualenvwrapper_lazy_``
(system packages in SUSE distributions are not supposed to store
anything in ``/usr/local``).
