  <title>Glues object frameworks together transparently</title>
  <description>This class facilitates building frameworks of several classes that inter-
operate. It was first designed and built for HTML::Mason, in which the
Compiler, Lexer, Interpreter, Resolver, Component, Buffer, and several
other objects must create each other transparently, passing the appropriate
parameters to the right class, possibly substituting other subclasses for
any of these objects.</description>
