%description
os-client-config is a library for collecting client configuration for
using an OpenStack cloud in a consistent and comprehensive manner.
It will find cloud config for as few as 1 cloud and as many as you want
to put in a config file. It will read environment variables and config
files, and it also contains some vendor specific default values so that
you don't have to know extra info to use OpenStack.
