%description
django-picklefield provides an implementation of a pickled object field.
Such fields can contain any picklable objects.

The implementation is taken and adopted from Django snippet #1694
<http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1694/> by Taavi Taijala, which is in
turn based on Django snippet #513 <http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/513/>
by Oliver Beattie.
