<package name="perl-Net-Whois-Raw" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Get Whois information for domains</title>
  <description>Net::Whois::Raw queries WHOIS servers about domains. The module supports
recursive WHOIS queries. Also queries via HTTP is supported for some TLDs.

Setting the variables $OMIT_MSG and $CHECK_FAIL will match the results against
a set of known patterns. The first flag will try to omit the copyright
message/disclaimer, the second will attempt to determine if the search failed
and return undef in such a case.

IMPORTANT: these checks merely use pattern matching; they will work on several
servers but certainly not on all of them.
