%description
Net::Whois::Raw queries WHOIS servers about domains. The module supports
recursive WHOIS queries. Also queries via HTTP is supported for some TLDs.

Setting the variables $OMIT_MSG and $CHECK_FAIL will match the results
against a set of known patterns. The first flag will try to omit the
copyright message/disclaimer, the second will attempt to determine if the
search failed and return undef in such a case.

*IMPORTANT*: these checks merely use pattern matching; they will work on
several servers but certainly not on all of them.
