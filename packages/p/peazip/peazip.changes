    - Improved control over temporary work directory, used when the
      archive is created or edited, during drag and drop extraction
      (Windows), and content preview
      - Output: faster as no copy to destination is needed, more 
        secure as no content is unpacked/decrypted outside of the 
        intended destination path
      - Output, preview in user's temp
      - User's temp (as conventionally used by most applications):
        in case of failure for any reason, user's temp folder is 
        the single place to look for orphaned data and can be 
        safely cleaned
      - None, user's temp if needed: allows exceptions to perform
        drag and drop extraction and preview using user's temp
      - None: no exceptions allowed, no temporary work data is saved,
        this does not allow to perform neither drag and drop 
        extraction nor preview, as archive content can't be
        transparently unpacked and passed to system's drag & drop 
        handler, nor to the associated application
  * EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
    - Added read support to .appxbundle format

        - Force local code page
        - Use a custom code page: an arbitrary code page can be
          entered by user (the host machine needs to support the

      copy/paste shortcuts Ctrl+C (or Ctrl+X) / Ctrl+V to extract
      items from archives to filesystem
      - If clipboard is set to keep multiple selection operations
        at once:
        - Copy/paste extraction is possible form multiple archives
          at once
        - It is also possibile to mix cut/paste and extraction
          operations
      - Extraction targets the file system, it is not currently 
        possible i.e. to directly paste compressed items from 
        archive A to archive B
        
- Changes from 7.5.0
  * CODE
    - Various fixes
  * FILE MANAGER
    - Create new folder is now also available for 7Z/p7Zip and RAR
      supported archive types
    - Improved file renaming routines
      - added function to cutting file names at specified lengtt
      - added function to replace / remove non-ASCII characters

        RAR supported archive types
    - Updated icons in embedded theme and added icons to 
      distinguish common archive types
    - Updated Ten theme
  * EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
    - Added "Extract everything for special file types"
      (to 7Z-supported archive types) to optionally extract the 
      entire archive (or current path) to preview special filetypes
      which usually needs external data to properly run, in example
      .html, .bat, and .exe files
      - From Options > Settings > Archive manager, Extract group is
        possible to customize "Extract everything for..." behavior
        - Never use special preview, Ask, Always (default)
        - Extract entire archive (default) or Extract displayed 
          items only (items in current path, or matching search 
          filters) which can be faster than extracting the entire
          archive
    - Archive timestamp preservation directive is now also applied
      to rename and delete operations 
      (previously only for add / update)
    - Options > Settings > Archive manager, Extract group: added 
      option to auto close PeaZip after extraction if no browsing 
    - actions took place (default off), useful in example if a 
      downloaded file was opened for quick inspection before 
      extraction
   - Options > Settings > General (Windows): added options for
     locking or hiding target window during drag and drop 
     operations, by default target window is hidden and locked 
     while the operation is running
    - Out of the box default compression levels are set to fast for
      ZIP and 7Z formats
      - compared to previous ZIP normal default, ZIP fast is over 
        400% faster providing 2% worse compression ratio, and 7Z 
        fast is 25% faster providing 3% better compression ratio
      - compared to previous 7Z normal default, 7Z fast is 500% 
        faster providing 5% worse compression ratio
      - please note compression levels and compression presets 
        works as usual, the new settings are meant only to provide
        novice users better performance balance for general purpose
        tasks
    - Modified existing preset scripts
      - 10 from faster zip to fast zip
      - 12 (Linux) from .tar.zst to .7z using Zstandard compression
        (which requires single pass)
    - Test mode always show details about single files in archive
  * WINDOWS & LINUX INSTALLERS
    - (Windows XP) additional 7z codecs introduced in 7.4 line, 
      incompatible with Windows XP, are deactivated when installed
      on XP machines, consequently the error messages are no longer
      triggered when using 7z backend

        + Extraction executable will start pre-set extraction
          procedure without need of external software.
        + Alternatively, volume with .001 extension can be opened

    through RarLab's unrar.
    Currently the plugin is available only for Windows or Wine/ReactOS,
    Linux version will be analyzed and tested for future updates.
  * Due the non-OSI compatible unrar restriction (even if the software
    provides sources and is royalty-free) the software is available as
    separate plugin on Add-Ons page.
  * Due the different syntax between RarLab's unrar and 7z/p7zip's unrar,
    following differences apply when handling RAR5 format:
    - Recursivity with advanced filters is always enabled.
    - Renaming options always rename the file being extracted.
  * Added LIBRE_DIRECTIVE option to disallow any call to software
    which is non-free under OSI definition:
    - If set to 0 (permissive) PeaZip will use all available backend,
      both free-as-in-freedom and royalty-free.
    - If set to 1 (flexible) PeaZip will disallow any call to
      royalty-free but non free-as-in-freedom backend,
      currently: unace and unrar binaries.
    - If set to 2 (strict) PeaZip will disallow calls even in case
      of dubious status, currently apply to unrar functions in
      7z/p7zip due to non-reversibility clause.
  * Various minor fixes.
