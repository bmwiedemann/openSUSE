- Update to version 7.4.0
  * GUI refresh and improves working with 7Z, ARC, RAR, and ZIPX
    archive types.
  * It is now possible to use new fast compression algorithms in
    7Z format: Brotli, Fast-LZMA2, Lizard, LZ4, LZ5, and
    Zstandard are now available, providing faster-than-Deflate
    compression with better speed-to-compression-ratio
    efficiency.
  * RAR archives are now fully read-write supported from PeaZip
    if rar executable is featured in the system: it is possible
    to update, edit, rename, and delete files in existing RAR
    archives, and more RAR-specific options are supported (set
    comment, lock archive, header encryption, set recovery
    records percentage).
  * ZIPX archives can now be edited, and it is possible to
    optionally use .zipx extension when creating non-Deflate
    compressed .zip archives.
  * It is now possible to repair ARC and RAR files, and even to
    attempt recovery if the archive cannot be opened for
    browsing.
- Refreshed peazip-desktop.patch
- Add optional support for less common archiving formats:
  arq, brotli, zpaq, zstd (fixes boo#1175933)

    + .cramfs compressed ROM/RAM file system images
    + .ext, .ext2, .ext3, and .ext4 filesystem images
    + .hfsx filesystem images
    + .qcow, and .qcow2c QEMU disk images
    + .scap, and .uefif firmware files
    + .mub, .pkg, and .ppmd compressed files

    open files with unreadable TOC, for all formats supporting
    TOC encryption, e.g. archives encrypted with "Encrypt also
    file names" option
  * Fixed browsing of encrypted ARC files
  * Fixed: can now delete files within WIM archives
  EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
  * Setting Custom compression type optionally aut-configures
    PeaZip to use RarLab's Rar.exe as compressor; if
    libre_directive option is set to 2 (most restrictive, not
    allowing closed archive formats), rar creation will be not
    allowed in any case
  * Rar.exe will be set to use PeaZip's work dir as other
    backend binaries
  * For RAR archives it is possible to set
    compression level, from store to maximum
    + action: new archive, add, update, freshen, sync with disk
    + spanning in multiple volumes password, optionally with two
      factor authentication (password + keyfile)
    + create RAR5 or legacy RAR4 archive
    + (RAR5) set dictionary size 1..1024 MB
    + (RAR5) use BLAKE2 hash instead of CRC checksum
    + Create self extracting RAR
    + Solid archive
    + Recovery records
    + Save files open for writing
    + Save NT security information
    + Save NTFS streams
    + Set archive time to last modified object
  * Improved support for more RAR options is planned in future,
    to allow efficient RAR creation from PeaZip GUI, providing
    RarLab's WinRar is installed in the system and Rar.exe is
    available.

        + Extraction executable will start pre-set extraction
          procedure without need of external software.
        + Alternatively, volume with .001 extension can be opened

    through RarLab's unrar.
    Currently the plugin is available only for Windows or Wine/ReactOS,

  * Due the non-OSI compatible unrar restriction (even if the software
    provides sources and is royalty-free) the software is available as
    separate plugin on Add-Ons page.
  * Due the different syntax between RarLab's unrar and 7z/p7zip's unrar,
    following differences apply when handling RAR5 format:
    - Recursivity with advanced filters is always enabled.
    - Renaming options always rename the file being extracted.
  * Added LIBRE_DIRECTIVE option to disallow any call to software
    which is non-free under OSI definition:
    - If set to 0 (permissive) PeaZip will use all available backend,
      both free-as-in-freedom and royalty-free.
    - If set to 1 (flexible) PeaZip will disallow any call to
      royalty-free but non free-as-in-freedom backend,
      currently: unace and unrar binaries.
    - If set to 2 (strict) PeaZip will disallow calls even in case
      of dubious status, currently apply to unrar functions in
      7z/p7zip due to non-reversibility clause.
  * Various minor fixes.
