        + Extraction executable will start pre-set extraction
          procedure without need of external software.
        + Alternatively, volume with .001 extension can be opened

    through RarLab's unrar.
    Currently the plugin is available only for Windows or Wine/ReactOS,

  * Due the non-OSI compatible unrar restriction (even if the software
    provides sources and is royalty-free) the software is available as
    separate plugin on Add-Ons page.
  * Due the different syntax between RarLab's unrar and 7z/p7zip's unrar,
    following differences apply when handling RAR5 format:
    - Recursivity with advanced filters is always enabled.
    - Renaming options always rename the file being extracted.
  * Added LIBRE_DIRECTIVE option to disallow any call to software
    which is non-free under OSI definition:
    - If set to 0 (permissive) PeaZip will use all available backend,
      both free-as-in-freedom and royalty-free.
    - If set to 1 (flexible) PeaZip will disallow any call to
      royalty-free but non free-as-in-freedom backend,
      currently: unace and unrar binaries.
    - If set to 2 (strict) PeaZip will disallow calls even in case
      of dubious status, currently apply to unrar functions in
      7z/p7zip due to non-reversibility clause.
  * Various minor fixes.
