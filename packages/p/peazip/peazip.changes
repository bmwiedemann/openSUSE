      (Windows), and content preview
      - Output: faster as no copy to destination is needed, more 
        secure as no content is unpacked/decrypted outside of the 
        intended destination path
      - Output, preview in user's temp
      - User's temp (as conventionally used by most applications):
        in case of failure for any reason, user's temp folder is 
        the single place to look for orphaned data and can be 
        safely cleaned
      - None, user's temp if needed: allows exceptions to perform
        drag and drop extraction and preview using user's temp
      - None: no exceptions allowed, no temporary work data is saved,
        this does not allow to perform neither drag and drop 
        extraction nor preview, as archive content can't be
        transparently unpacked and passed to system's drag & drop 
        handler, nor to the associated application
  * EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
    - Added read support to .appxbundle format

        - Local code page, then UTF-8 for sysmbols outside local
          code page (default)
        - Force UTF-8 for non-ASCII characters
        - Force local code page
        - Use a custom code page: an arbitrary code page can be
          entered by user (the host machine needs to support the 
          code page to run the tasks, otherwise tasks can be saved 
          as scripts and run on different machines)
      - Text encoding entry is now accessible also from application's
        file browser context menu, and in Archiving and Extraction
        screens context menus
    - Within PeaZip file manager it is now possible to use 
      copy/paste shortcuts Ctrl+C (or Ctrl+X) / Ctrl+V to extract
      items from archives to filesystem
      - If clipboard is set to keep multiple selection operations
        at once:
        - Copy/paste extraction is possible form multiple archives
          at once
        - It is also possibile to mix cut/paste and extraction
          operations
      - Extraction targets the file system, it is not currently 
        possible i.e. to directly paste compressed items from 
        archive A to archive B
        
- Changes from 7.5.0
  * CODE
    - Various fixes
  * FILE MANAGER
    - Create new folder is now also available for 7Z/p7Zip and RAR
      supported archive types
    - Improved file renaming routines
      - added function to cutting file names at specified lengtt
      - added function to replace / remove non-ASCII characters

        etc...) are now also available when browsing 7Z/p7zip and 
        RAR supported archive types
    - Updated icons in embedded theme and added icons to 
      distinguish common archive types
    - Updated Ten theme
  * EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
    - Added "Extract everything for special file types"
      (to 7Z-supported archive types) to optionally extract the 
      entire archive (or current path) to preview special filetypes
      which usually needs external data to properly run, in example
      .html, .bat, and .exe files
      - From Options > Settings > Archive manager, Extract group is
        possible to customize "Extract everything for..." behavior
        - Never use special preview, Ask, Always (default)
        - Extract entire archive (default) or Extract displayed 
          items only (items in current path, or matching search 
          filters) which can be faster than extracting the entire
          archive
    - Archive timestamp preservation directive is now also applied
      to rename and delete operations 
      (previously only for add / update)
    - Options > Settings > Archive manager, Extract group: added 
      option to auto close PeaZip after extraction if no browsing 
    - actions took place (default off), useful in example if a 
      downloaded file was opened for quick inspection before 
      extraction
   - Options > Settings > General (Windows): added options for
     locking or hiding target window during drag and drop 
     operations, by default target window is hidden and locked 
     while the operation is running
    - Out of the box default compression levels are set to fast for
      ZIP and 7Z formats
      - compared to previous ZIP normal default, ZIP fast is over 
        400% faster providing 2% worse compression ratio, and 7Z 
        fast is 25% faster providing 3% better compression ratio
      - compared to previous 7Z normal default, 7Z fast is 500% 
        faster providing 5% worse compression ratio
      - please note compression levels and compression presets 
        works as usual, the new settings are meant only to provide
        novice users better performance balance for general purpose
        tasks
    - Modified existing preset scripts
      - 10 from faster zip to fast zip
      - 12 (Linux) from .tar.zst to .7z using Zstandard compression
        (which requires single pass)
    - Test mode always show details about single files in archive
  * WINDOWS & LINUX INSTALLERS
    - (Windows XP) additional 7z codecs introduced in 7.4 line, 
      incompatible with Windows XP, are deactivated when installed
      on XP machines, consequently the error messages are no longer
      triggered when using 7z backend

      FLZMA2, LZ4, and Zstd compression algorithms in .7z format
      algorithm selection dropdown is now common to all platforms,
      unsupported algorithms for one platform are preceeded with / 
      (currently unsupported /Brotli, /Lizard, and /LZ5 on linux)
  * CODE
    - Various fixes
  * FILE MANAGER
    - (Windows) File manager now displays icons for exe files for
      better usability, using a separate thread; previously the
      feature was enabled only if browser was set to show thumbnails
      In-archive Extract and open with PeaZip and Preview with
      PeaZip now forces trying to open file as archive, as in Open
      as archive menu entry
  * EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
    - (Windows) Drop target window is locked, as in WinRar, until
      drag and drop operation is completed
      If password contains characters that can be troublesome if 
      used in scripts (i.e. quotes) it is now possible to 
      interactively enter password in console to create / extract
      archive types handled through 7z/p7zip, ARC, and RAR backends

    comment, lock archive, header encryption, set recovery
    records percentage).
  * ZIPX archives can now be edited, and it is possible to
    optionally use .zipx extension when creating non-Deflate
    compressed .zip archives.
  * It is now possible to repair ARC and RAR files, and even to
    attempt recovery if the archive cannot be opened for
    browsing.

  * Fixed browsing of encrypted ARC files
  * Fixed: can now delete files within WIM archives
  EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
  * Setting Custom compression type optionally aut-configures
    PeaZip to use RarLab's Rar.exe as compressor; if

    allowing closed archive formats), rar creation will be not
    allowed in any case
  * Rar.exe will be set to use PeaZip's work dir as other
    backend binaries
  * For RAR archives it is possible to set
    compression level, from store to maximum
    + action: new archive, add, update, freshen, sync with disk
    + spanning in multiple volumes password, optionally with two
      factor authentication (password + keyfile)
    + create RAR5 or legacy RAR4 archive
    + (RAR5) set dictionary size 1..1024 MB

    available.

        + Extraction executable will start pre-set extraction
          procedure without need of external software.
        + Alternatively, volume with .001 extension can be opened

- update to version 5.6.1
  * Added read only support (list, test, extract) to RAR5 format
    through RarLab's unrar.
    Currently the plugin is available only for Windows or Wine/ReactOS,
    Linux version will be analyzed and tested for future updates.
  * Due the non-OSI compatible unrar restriction (even if the software
    provides sources and is royalty-free) the software is available as
    separate plugin on Add-Ons page.
  * Due the different syntax between RarLab's unrar and 7z/p7zip's unrar,
    following differences apply when handling RAR5 format:
    - Recursivity with advanced filters is always enabled.
    - Renaming options always rename the file being extracted.
  * Added LIBRE_DIRECTIVE option to disallow any call to software
    which is non-free under OSI definition:
    - If set to 0 (permissive) PeaZip will use all available backend,
      both free-as-in-freedom and royalty-free.
    - If set to 1 (flexible) PeaZip will disallow any call to
      royalty-free but non free-as-in-freedom backend,
