  * Added option to customize timestamp style (Options &gt; Settings &gt;
    Archive Manager).
  * Added option to split self extracting archives in 7z format
    - Split sfx archives will result in a small extraction executable,
      and n volumes of desired size.
    - Spanning sfx archive allows to prevent the resulting archive
      being larger of the maximum executable size allowed for the
      target OS.
    - To extract a split sfx archive, place extraction executable
      and all volumes in the same directory.
        + Extraction executable will start pre-set extraction
          procedure without need of external software.
        + Alternatively, volume with .001 extension can be opened
          with an external archiver to browse/extract the entire
          archive.
  * Updated file split pre-sets.
    - Added 25 GB Blu-Ray pre-set size.
  * Custom pre-set size modified in 100 MB.

    improved Windows 10 / 8.1 support.
- update to version 5.7.0
  * (Linux) Added read only support (list, test, extract) to RAR5
    format through RarLab-based unrar-nonfree; due the non-OSI
    compatible unrar restriction the software is available as
    separate plugin on Add-Ons page of PeaZip website.

  * (Windows) Updated 7z backend to 15.05 beta.

  * Various fixes and updates.
  * Improved management of plug-ins:
    - In About screen, missing and installed plugin are repported,
      and it is shown a link for checking plugin and addon online.
    - When opening an archive format (ACE, RARv5) requiring a plugin,
      user is informed if the plugin is missing, and how to download it.
    - Information popup is limited to one per plugin type per session.
- update to version 5.6.1
  * Added read only support (list, test, extract) to RAR5 format
    through RarLab's unrar.
    Currently the plugin is available only for Windows or Wine/ReactOS,
    Linux version will be analyzed and tested for future updates.
  * Due the non-OSI compatible unrar restriction (even if the software
    provides sources and is royalty-free) the software is available as
    separate plugin on Add-Ons page.
  * Due the different syntax between RarLab's unrar and 7z/p7zip's unrar,
    following differences apply when handling RAR5 format:
    - Recursivity with advanced filters is always enabled.
    - Renaming options always rename the file being extracted.
  * Added LIBRE_DIRECTIVE option to disallow any call to software
    which is non-free under OSI definition:
    - If set to 0 (permissive) PeaZip will use all available backend,
      both free-as-in-freedom and royalty-free.
    - If set to 1 (flexible) PeaZip will disallow any call to
      royalty-free but non free-as-in-freedom backend,
      currently: unace and unrar binaries.
    - If set to 2 (strict) PeaZip will disallow calls even in case
      of dubious status, currently apply to unrar functions in
      7z/p7zip due to non-reversibility clause.

    <comment>- Update to version 7.3.2
  CODE
  * Various fixes
  FILE MANAGER
  * Added support to more file extensions:
    + .cramfs compressed ROM/RAM file system images
    + .ext, .ext2, .ext3, and .ext4 filesystem images
    + .hfsx filesystem images
    + .qcow, and .qcow2c QEMU disk images
    + .scap, and .uefif firmware files
    + .mub, .pkg, and .ppmd compressed files
  * Archive browser now will automatically ask for password to
    open files with unreadable TOC, for all formats supporting
    TOC encryption, e.g. archives encrypted with &quot;Encrypt also
    file names&quot; option
  * Fixed browsing of encrypted ARC files
  * Fixed: can now delete files within WIM archives
  EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
  * Setting Custom compression type optionally aut-configures
    PeaZip to use RarLab's Rar.exe as compressor; if
    libre_directive option is set to 2 (most restrictive, not
    allowing closed archive formats), rar creation will be not
    allowed in any case
  * Rar.exe will be set to use PeaZip's work dir as other
    backend binaries
  * For RAR archives it is possible to set
    compression level, from store to maximum
    + action: new archive, add, update, freshen, sync with disk
    + spanning in multiple volumes password, optionally with two
      factor authentication (password + keyfile)
    + create RAR5 or legacy RAR4 archive
    + (RAR5) set dictionary size 1..1024 MB
    + (RAR5) use BLAKE2 hash instead of CRC checksum
    + Create self extracting RAR
    + Solid archive
    + Recovery records
    + Save files open for writing
    + Save NT security information
    + Save NTFS streams
    + Set archive time to last modified object
  * Improved support for more RAR options is planned in future,
    to allow efficient RAR creation from PeaZip GUI, providing
    RarLab's WinRar is installed in the system and Rar.exe is
    available.
