- update to 2.0.2:
  * Fixed ``HTTPResponse.stream()`` to continue yielding bytes if
    buffered decompressed data was still available to be read

    loss when reading streamed responses.
  * Changed all parameters in the HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection
    constructors to be keyword-only except host and port.
  * Changed HTTPConnection.getresponse() to set the socket timeout from
    HTTPConnection.timeout value before reading data from the socket.

  * Changed TLS handshakes to use SSLContext.check_hostname when possible.
  * Changed the default blocksize to 16KB to match OpenSSL's default read

  * Fixed a socket leaking when ``HTTPSConnection.connect()`` raises an exception.
  * Fixed ``server_hostname`` being forwarded from ``PoolManager`` to ``HTTPConnectionPool``
    when requesting an HTTP URL. Should only be forwarded when requesting an HTTPS URL.

    ``Retry.DEFAULT_MAX_BACKOFF`` to better match the rest of the default parameter names.
    ``Retry.MAX_BACKOFF`` is removed in v2.0.
  * Changed location of the vendored ``ssl.match_hostname`` function from
    ``urllib3.packages.ssl_match_hostname`` to
    ``urllib3.util.ssl_match_hostname`` to ensure Python 3.10+ compatibility after
    being repackaged by downstream distributors.
  * Fixed absolute imports, all imports are now relative.

Thu Jan 28 23:20:46 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.26.3:
  * Fixed bytes and string comparison issue with headers (Pull #2141)
  * Changed ``ProxySchemeUnknown`` error message to be
    more actionable if the user supplies a proxy URL without
    a scheme. (Pull #2107)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  1 13:20:04 UTC 2021 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Skip test for RECENT_DATE. It is a test purely for developers.

    ``User-Agent`` header key is passed as ``bytes`` (Pull #2047)
  * Added support for HTTPS proxies contacting HTTPS servers (Pull #1923, Pull #1806)
  * Deprecated negotiating TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 by default. Users that
    still wish to use TLS earlier than 1.2 without a deprecation warning
    should opt-in explicitly by setting ``ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1`` (Pull #2002)
    **Starting in urllib3 v2.0: Connections that receive a ``DeprecationWarning`` will fail**
  * Deprecated ``Retry`` options ``Retry.DEFAULT_METHOD_WHITELIST``, ``Retry.DEFAULT_REDIRECT_HEADERS_BLACKLIST``
    and ``Retry(method_whitelist=...)`` in favor of ``Retry.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS``,
    ``Retry.DEFAULT_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_REDIRECT``, and ``Retry(allowed_methods=...)``
    (Pull #2000) **Starting in urllib3 v2.0: Deprecated options will be removed**
  * Added default ``User-Agent`` header to every request (Pull #1750)
  * Added ``urllib3.util.SKIP_HEADER`` for skipping ``User-Agent``, ``Accept-Encoding``,
    and ``Host`` headers from being automatically emitted with requests (Pull #2018)
  * Collapse ``transfer-encoding: chunked`` request data and framing into
    the same ``socket.send()`` call (Pull #1906)
  * Send ``http/1.1`` ALPN identifier with every TLS handshake by default (Pull #1894)

    has closed the socket (Pull #1524)

    into an ``urllib3.exceptions.SSLError`` (Pull #1939)
  * Fix retry backoff time parsed from ``Retry-After`` header when given
    in the HTTP date format. The HTTP date was parsed as the local timezone
    rather than accounting for the timezone in the HTTP date (typically
    UTC) (Pull #1932, Pull #1935, Pull #1938, Pull #1949)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    due to the new dynamic linker cache (Pull #1905)
  * Collapse chunked request bodies data and framing into one
  call to ``send()`` to reduce the number of TCP packets by 2-4x (Pull #1906)
  * Don't insert ``None`` into ``ConnectionPool`` if the pool
    was empty when requesting a connection (Pull #1866)
  * Avoid ``hasattr`` call in ``BrotliDecoder.decompress()`` (Pull #1858)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  2 17:19:23 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.25.9 (bsc#1177120, CVE-2020-26137):
  * Added ``InvalidProxyConfigurationWarning`` which is raised when
    erroneously specifying an HTTPS proxy URL. urllib3 doesn't currently
    support connecting to HTTPS proxies but will soon be able to
    and we would like users to migrate properly without much breakage.
  * Drain connection after ``PoolManager`` redirect (Pull #1817)
  * Ensure ``load_verify_locations`` raises ``SSLError`` for all backends (Pull #1812)
  * Rename ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` to ``HTTPSConnection`` (Pull #1805)
  * Allow the CA certificate data to be passed as a string (Pull #1804)

  * Percent-encode invalid characters in URL for HTTPConnectionPool.request() (Pull #1673)
- Drop patch urllib3-ssl-default-context.patch
- Drop patch python-urllib3-recent-date.patch the date is recent
  enough on its own

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    numerous fixes in the git for quick backporting

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 21 06:23:36 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fixup pre script: the migration issue happens when changing from
  python-urllib3 to python2-urllib3: the number of installed
  instances of python2-urlliib3 is at this moment 1, unlike in
  regular updates. This is due to a name change, which consists not
  of a pure package update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 20 07:33:55 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Provides/Obsoletes does not fix the issue: we have a
  directory-to-symlink switch, which cannot be handled by RPM
  internally. Assist using pre script (boo#1138715).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 19 15:58:19 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

  fixes that we provide in new python2/3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 29 08:59:29 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Add more test to skip as with new openssl some behaviour changed

  This makes the check to be run always and ensure the urls are
  "secure".

- update to 1.25 (bsc#1132663, bsc#1129071, CVE-2019-9740, CVE-2019-11236):
  * Require and validate certificates by default when using HTTPS
  * Upgraded ``urllib3.utils.parse_url()`` to be RFC 3986 compliant.

- Update to version 1.8:
  * Improved url parsing in urllib3.util.parse_url (properly parse '@' in
    username, and blank ports like 'hostname:').
  * New urllib3.connection module which contains all the HTTPConnection
    objects.
  * Several urllib3.util.Timeout-related fixes. Also changed constructor
    signature to a more sensible order. [Backwards incompatible]
    (Issues #252, #262, #263)
  * Use backports.ssl_match_hostname if it's installed. (Issue #274)
  * Added .tell() method to urllib3.response.HTTPResponse which
    returns the number of bytes read so far. (Issue #277)
  * Support for platforms without threading. (Issue #289)
  * Expand default-port comparison in HTTPConnectionPool.is_same_host
    to allow a pool with no specified port to be considered equal to to an
    HTTP/HTTPS url with port 80/443 explicitly provided. (Issue #305)
  * Improved default SSL/TLS settings to avoid vulnerabilities.
    (Issue #309)
  * Fixed urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager not retrying on connect errors.
    (Issue #310)
  * Disable Nagle's Algorithm on the socket for non-proxies. A subset of requests
    will send the entire HTTP request ~200 milliseconds faster; however, some of
    the resulting TCP packets will be smaller. (Issue #254)
  * Increased maximum number of SubjectAltNames in urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
    from the default 64 to 1024 in a single certificate. (Issue #318)
  * Headers are now passed and stored as a custom
    urllib3.collections_.HTTPHeaderDict object rather than a plain dict.
    (Issue #329, #333)
  * Headers no longer lose their case on Python 3. (Issue #236)
  * urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl now uses the operating system's default CA
    certificates on inject. (Issue #332)
  * Requests with retries=False will immediately raise any exceptions without
    wrapping them in MaxRetryError. (Issue #348)
  * Fixed open socket leak with SSL-related failures. (Issue #344, #348)

    skip hostname verification for SSL connections. (Issue #194)
  + New method urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.stream(...) which acts as a
    generator wrapped around .read(...). (Issue #198)

  + Fixed thread race condition in
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager.connection_from_host(...) (Issue #204)
