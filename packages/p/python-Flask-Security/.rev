# Backwards Compatibility Concerns
  The fixes to all the templates to pass W3C validation could
  introduce some incompatibilities:
  * All templates now have a default &lt;title&gt; - before, the &lt;title&gt;
    element was empty.
  * The HTML id of the rescue form submit button was changed to
    'rescue'
  * The HTML id of the webauthn delete form name field was changed
    to 'delete-name'
  * Some template headings were changed to improve consistency
  * The csrf_token HTML id was changed on us_setup.html,
    wan_register.html, two_factor_setup.html
    two_factor_verify_code.html, us_verify.html, verify.html for the
    second form on the page.
  * On us_setup.html and two_factor_setup.html the submit code
    button HTML id was changed.
