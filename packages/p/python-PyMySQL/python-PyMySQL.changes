Wed Sep 16 11:01:32 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.10.0:
  * MariaDB ed25519 auth is supported.
  * Python 3.4 support is dropped.
  * Context manager interface is removed from `Connection`. It will be added
    with different meaning.
  * MySQL warnings are not shown by default because many user report issue to
    PyMySQL issue tracker when they see warning. You need to call "SHOW WARNINGS"
    explicitly when you want to see warnings.
  * Formatting of float object is changed from "3.14" to "3.14e0".
  * Use cp1252 codec for latin1 charset.
  * Fix decimal literal.
  * TRUNCATED_WRONG_VALUE_FOR_FIELD, and ILLEGAL_VALUE_FOR_TYPE are now
    DataError instead of InternalError.
