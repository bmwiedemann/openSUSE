  <title>Python library for numerical quantum transport calculations</title>
  <description>Kwant is a Python library for numerical calculations on tight-binding
models with a strong focus on quantum transport. Kwant can be used to
simulate a variety of systems and phenomena in quantum physics
including: metals, graphene, topological insulators, quantum Hall
effect, superconductivity, spintronics, molecular electronics, any
combination of the above, and many other things. Kwant can calculate
transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix),
dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Greenâ€™s
functions, out-of-equilibrium local quantities.
