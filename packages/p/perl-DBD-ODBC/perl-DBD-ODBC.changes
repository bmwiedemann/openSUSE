  1.53_1 2015-10-16
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    Strictly speaking this is a bug fix to DBI and not DBD::ODBC but DBI
    now supports 64 bit row counts where an IV in perl is 64 bits. However, it
    necessitated changes to DBD::ODBC to pick up the fix. odbc_rows (my workaround
    since 2012) is still supported but should no longer be required so long as you
    use this DBD::ODBC and DBI 1.633_92 or above.
  
    [INTERNALS]
  
    Removed dbd_st_rows and now setting DBIc_ROW_COUNT.
  
    [DOCUMENTATION]
  
    Add tables and table_info section to deviations from the DBI spec.
  
    [MISCELLANEOUS]
  
    Change column name in t/rt_101579.t as "method" is a reserved word

    Changes to the test suite to make it run better with Postgres thanks
    to Greg Sabino Mullane.
  
  1.51_4 2015-01-18
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    Numerous errors in the test suite (with SQLite ODBC driver) mostly down to not
    creating the test table first.
  
    [MISCELLANEOUS]
  
    Try and make the test suite run ok for SQLite ODBC driver so I can use it
    in travis-ci.
  
  1.51_3 2015-01-17
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    RT101579 - using bound input parameters for numeric columns (e.g.,
    SQL_NUMERIC) only works the first time and will quite likey fail
    with "string data, right truncation" on the second and subsequent
    calls to execute. Thanks to Laura Cox for finding.
  
  1.51_2 2014-11-19
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    The table_info method (ANSI version only) was incorrectly passing
    the table name for the type argument. I think this bug was
    introduced last year.
  
  1.51_1 2014-11-14
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    RT100186 - handle VARBINARY(MAX) parameters with SQL Server native
    client. Identify "libmsodbcsql*" as the MS ODBC Driver for Linux as
    there are some specific workarounds for MS Native Client ODBC driver.
  
  1.50 2014-07-25
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    The 80_odbc_diags.t test could fail if a driver fails a table does
    not exist test in the prepare instead of the execute.
  
  1.49_4 2014-07-08
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    Fixed sql_type_cast.t test which assumed column aliases which stay
    lowercase.
  
    Fixed 87_odbc_lob_read.t test which did not bow out of the test
    properly if the database was not MS SQL Server.
  
    [DOCUMENTATION]
  
    Revised the query notification example and documentation.
  
    Added a link to a better Query Notification article.
  
  1.49_3 2014-05-01
  
    [CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR]
  
    As warned years ago, this release removes the odbc_old_unicode attribute.
    If you have a good reason to use it speak up now before the next non-development
    release.
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    Fix rt89255: Fails to create test table for tests using PostgreSQL odbc driver.
    Change test suite to fallback on PRECISION if COLUMN_SIZE is not found.
  
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
    Added support for MS SQL Server Query Notification. See the new
    section in the pod.
  
    Added a currently undocumented (and experimental)
    odbc_describe_param method on a statement handle which takes a
    parameter number as the only argument and returns an array of the
    data type, parameter size, decimal digits and nullable (as per
    SQLDescribeParam).
  
    [DOCUMENTATION]
  
    Added FAQ on truncated column names with freeTDS.
  
    [MISCELLANEOUS]
  
    I have removed the "experimental" tag for odbc_getdiagfield and odbc_getdiagrec
    methods.
  
  1.49_2 2014-04-26
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    Change to data_sources in 1.49_1 could lead to a compile error since
    data_sources was not returning a value if an error occurred.
  
  1.49_1 2014-04-25
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    If you had a lot of DSNs on Windows (more than 280 but it depends on
    the length of their names) and called the data_sources method it
    could crash your script. Code internally changed to stop putting the DSNs
    returned on the stack.
  
    [CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR]
  
    As warned years ago, the private data_sources method has been
    removed - use DBI one instead.
  
    [MISCELLANEOUS]
  
    Added FAQ entry of maximum number of allowed parameters.

   Further changes to this change file to make it CPAN::Changes spec.
   NOTE the changes.cpanhq.com site does not yet support "unknown" for
   dates.
 
 1.46_2 2013-12-17
 
   [BUG FIXES]
 
   When built with unicode support and odbc_old_unicode is not enabled
   columns reported as SQL_LONGVARCHAR were not by default bound as
   SQL_WCHAR and hence were not returned correctly unless the bind was
   overridden.
 
   [MISCELLANEOUS]
 
   Added test 90_trace_flag.t
 
 1.46_1 2013-11-16
 
   [CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR]
 
   As warned in release 1.45, the binding of unicode parameters to
   char/varchar columns has changed significantly. If you don't attempt
   to insert unicode into char/varchar columns or if you only inserted
   unicode into nchar/nvarchar columns you should see no difference.
   From this release, unicode data inserted into
   char/varchar/longvarchar columns is bound as SQL_WCHAR and not
   whatever the driver reports the parameter as (which is mostly
   SQL_CHAR).
 
   Previously if DBD::ODBC received an error or (SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO)
   from an ODBC API call and then the driver refused to return the
   error state/text DBD::ODBC would issue its own error saying "Unable
   to fetch information about the error" and state IM008. That state
   was wrong and has been changed to HY000.
 
   [BUG FIXES]
 
   Some drivers cannot support catalogs and/or schema names in
   SQLTables.  Recent changes set the schema/catalog name to the empty
   string (good reasons below) which causes "optional feature not
   implemented" from MS Access (which does not support schemas - even
   for a simply ping (which uses SQLTables)). Now we call
   SQLCATALOG_NAME and SQLSCHEMA_USAGE on connect to ascertain support
   which modifies SQLTables call.

Fri Dec  2 02:35:19 UTC 2011 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.33
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  * Enable multiple active statement support in 70execute_array.t for
    drivers we recognise which support MAS.
  * Change column_info to support Unicode catalog/schema/table/column
    names.
  * Use SQLGetTypeInfoW on unicode builds.
  * DBD::ODBC now allows unicode catalog/schema/table parameters to be
    passed to table_info. Of course they will only reliably work with
    a supporting Unicode ODBC driver.
  * Added new odbc_driver_complete attribute allowing the ODBC Driver
    Manager and ODBC Driver to throw dialogues for incomplete
    connection strings or expired passwords etc.
  [BUG FIXES]
  * remove debugging printf which output "HERE" in some rare cases.
    rt 72534 - thanks John Deighan for spotting this.
  * The test 70execute_array.t could fail due to warning being output
    if the driver does not support Multiple Active Statements.
  * Fix bug in utf16_copy which was not adding a trailing NUL but I'm
    not sure this affected anyone until I changed table_info this
    release.
  * I omitted rt_68720.t from the 1.31 distribution which leads
    to a warning as it is mentioned in the MANIFEST.
  [DOCUMENTATION]
  * new FAQ entries
  * added note saying you cannot pass unicode schema/table/column
    names to metadata calls like table_info/column_info currently.
  [OTHER]
  * Changed line endings in README.af and README.unicode to be unix
    line endings and native eol-style in subversion.
  * Minor changes to Makefile.PL to save the opensuse guys patching.
  * Added unicode_sql.pl and unicode_params.pl examples
  * added more examples

Fri Jun 24 08:14:55 UTC 2011 - vcizek@novell.com

- update to 1.31 
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  * An extra argument has been added to the sub associated with
  odbc_err_handler.  The arguments passed to the odbc_err_handler are
  now state (string), error (string), native error code (number) and
  the status returned from the last ODBC API. The status will be
  SQL_ERROR (-1) for errors or SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO (1) for
  informational messages.
  * Added support for StrictlyTyped and DiscardString to the bind_col
    method.
  * Added the new odbc_describe_parameters attribute.
  * added -w option to Makefile.PL to add "-Wall" to CCFLAGS and
    -fno-strict-aliasing so I can find warnings.
  * Cope with broken ODBC drivers that describe a parameter as SQL
    type 0.

  * Fixed "select 1" in 02simple.t for Firebird ODBC Driver.
  * disconnect call added to 70execute_array.t was in the wrong place.
  * Added support for DBI's new trace flags ENC, CON, TXN and
    DBD.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 23 14:56:12 CEST 2010 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.25
 * Changed bind_col so it actually pays attention to the TYPE
   attribute as you could not override the bind type of a bound
    column before.
 * Left a sv_undef in
 * Change sprintf to snprintf for safety.
 * Removed some unused fields from the fbh structure which should
   save a little memory for each column in a result-set.
 * Started adding support for DBI's DiscardString and StrictlyTyped
   but not complete yet so don't use them yet.
 * Added experimental odbc_lob_read method - see pod.
 * Moved the binding of columns to the first call to fetch instead of
   after execute is called as it prevents bind_col overrriding the
   type used for binding and I needed it to support odbc_lob_read.
 * Removed support for DBI's blob_read - it was totally flawed and
   did not work at all. May replace in the future.
 * Added support for MS SQL Server XML type (SQL type -152).
 * bugfixes, new FAQs

   unicode builds. This affects ODBC drivers which don't have
 * About a 30% rewrite of bound parameter code which started with an
   attempt to support the new VARBINARY(MAX) and VARCHAR(MAX)
   columns in SQL Server when the parameter length is > 400K in size 
 * Rewrote ColAttributes code to understand string and numeric
   attributes rather than trying to guess by what the driver returns.
 * bugfixes, test fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 27 15:47:25 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.16
 * More tracing in dbdimp.c for named parameters.
 * #ifdeffed out odbc_get_primary_keys in dbdimp.c as it is no 
   longer used.  $h->func($catalog, $schema, $table, 'GetPrimaryKeys')
   ends up in dbdimp.c/dbd_st_primary_keys now.
 * Changes to Makefile.PL to fix a newly introduced bug with 'tr', 
   remove easysoft OOB detection and to try and use odbc_config and 
   odbcinst if we find them to aid automatic configuration. This 
   latter change also adds "odbc_config --cflags" to the CC line 
   when building DBD::ODBC.
 * Added support for parse_trace_flag and parse_trace_flags methods 
   and defined a DBD::ODBC private flag 'odbcdev' as a test case.
 * Add support for the 'SQL' trace type. Added private trace type 
   odbcdev as an experimental start.
 * Change odbc_query_timeout attribute handling so if it is set to 0
   after having set it to a non-zero value the default of no time 
   out is restored.
 * Added support for DBI's statistics_info method.
 * test changes, documentation changes, bugfixes

   database context to 'master'" from SQL Server are available in
   errstr/state. 
 * Changed Makefile.PL to attempt to find unixODBC if -o or ODBCHOME 
   not specified.
 * Fairly major changes to dbd_describe in dbdimp.c to reduce ODBC 
   calls by 1 SQLDescribeCol call per column when describing result
   sets.
 * Changed to avoid using explicit use of DBIc_ERRXXX in favour 
   of newish DBIh_SET_ERR_CHAR.
 * test fixes, bugfixes, documentation added

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 25 16:45:10 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz
