%description
Testing a WSGI application normally involves starting a server at a local host
and port, then pointing your test code to that address. Instead, this library
lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination and redirect
them into a `WSGI application`_ importable by your test program.  Thus, you
can avoid spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app.
