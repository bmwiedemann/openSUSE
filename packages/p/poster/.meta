  <title>Tool for printing posters over multiple pages</title>
  <description>This program scales a PostScript page to a given size (a poster). The
output can be tiled on multiple sheets, and output media size can be
chosen independently. Each tile (sheet) of a will bear cropmarks and
slightly overlapping image for easier poster assembly. In principle it
requires the input file to adhere to 'eps' (encapsulated postscript)
conventions but it will work for many 'normal' postscript files as
well.</description>
