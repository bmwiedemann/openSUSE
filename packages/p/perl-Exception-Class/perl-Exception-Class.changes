  - You can now pass "frame_filter", "filter_frames_early", and "skip_frames" to
    the throw() method of an exception class. These will be passed on to the
    Devel::StackTrace constructor. Requested by Frédéric Brière. GH #6.

  - The full_message() method in Exception::Class::Base now calls message()
    instead of accessing the object's hash key. This makes it easier to override
    message() in a subclass. Patch by Alexander Batyrshin. PR #11.

  - Generated exception classes are now added to %INC. If you subclass a
    generated class with "use base" then base.pm will no longer attempt to load
    the requested class. Patch by Todd Rinaldo. PR #8.

  1.39    2014-11-01
  
  - Replaced the Exception::Class::Base->NoRefs method with UnsafeRefCapture to
    match changes in Devel::StackTrace 2.00. The old method is deprecated but
    will continue to work.
  
  
  1.38    2014-05-05
  
  - An exception without a message will now default to either the associated
    exception class description or the string "[Generic exception]". Patch by
    Ricardo Signes. PR #2.
  
  - Added field_hash() and context_hash() methods. Patch by Ricardo Signes. PR
    #1.

- update to 1.32
 - Removed Test::Most dependency, which was causing a circular dependency
   chain. Reported by Burak Gursoy. RT #58889.
 - Made it possible to use Exception::Class::Base without loading
   Exception::Class. Reported by Alex Peters. RT #57269.
 - Added the ability to create light weight exceptions, which don't record a
   stack trace or any other context info (time, pid, etc.). This is done by
   setting $class->NoContextInfo to a true value for the exception class. Based
   on a patch by Graham Barr. RT #54826.

- update to 1.29
  * Make sure that there is only one line that the toolchain can pick up
    when looking for this module's $VERSION.
- 1.28 May 6, 2009
  * Removed Exception::Class::Base->do_trace and ->NoObjectRefs, both of
    which have been undocumented for many years.
  * Moved Exception::Class::Base to its own file, so it doesn't
    overwrite the $VERSION in Exception::Class (and for general
    sanity). Reported by Kirk Baucom.
- 1.27 May 4, 2009
  * The error message for an exception no longer defaults to $!. This
    was a bad idea, and has bitten some people. Addresses RT #43600.
  * I'm now only supporting Perl 5.8.1+. This module broke on 5.6.2 (and
    5.8.0) at some point and I don't really care enough to fix
    it. Non-intrusive patches to make it work on 5.8.0 or less (again)
    will be accepted.
- 1.26 Oct 25, 2008
  * No code changes, just bumped the Devel::StackTrace dependency to
    1.20.
  * The changes in 1.25 exposed a bug in Devel::StackTrace which has now
    been fixed. This caused HTML::Mason test failures, among other
    things. Reported by Andreas Koenig.
- 1.25 Oct 21, 2008
  * The Exception::Class::Base constructor no longer looks at the
    associated Devel::StackTrace object's frames. Avoiding looking at
    the frames should make constructing exception objects much
    faster. Instead the information based on the stack trace frames -
    package(), file(), and line() - is only retrieved when it is
    requested. Patch by Ruslan Zakirov. RT #40221.
- 1.24 Mar 30, 2008
  * Added a MaxArgLength class parameter to go along with the new
    max_arg_length constructor param for Devel::StackTrace
    objects. Patch by Ian Burrell.
- added perl-macros
  o autogen filelist with perl_gen_filelist
- spec mods
  o added header
  o fixed deps
