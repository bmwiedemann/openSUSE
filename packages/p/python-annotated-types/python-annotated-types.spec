%description
PEP-593 added `typing.Annotated` as a way of adding context-specific metadata to
existing types, and specifies that `Annotated[T, x]` _should_ be treated as `T` by
any tool or library without special logic for `x`.

This package provides metadata objects which can be used to represent common
constraints such as upper and lower bounds on scalar values and collection sizes,
a `Predicate` marker for runtime checks, and
descriptions of how we intend these metadata to be interpreted. In some cases,
we also note alternative representations which do not require this package.
