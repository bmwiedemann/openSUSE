  <title>Easily create test classes in an xUnit/JUnit style</title>
  <description>Test::Class provides a simple way of creating classes and objects to test
your code in an xUnit style.
Built using Test::Builder, it was designed to work with other
Test::Builder based modules (Test::More, Test::Differences,
Test::Exception, etc.).
*Note:* This module will make more sense, if you are already familiar with
the &quot;standard&quot; mechanisms for testing perl code. Those unfamiliar with
Test::Harness, Test::Simple, Test::More and friends should go take a look
at them now. Test::Tutorial is a good starting point.</description>
