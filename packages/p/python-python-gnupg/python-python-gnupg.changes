- update to 0.5.1:
  * Added ``TRUST_EXPIRED`` to ``trust_keys``. Thanks to Leif Liddy
    for the patch.
  * Fix #206: Remove deprecated ``--always-trust`` in favour of
    ``--trust-model always``
  * Fix #208: Add ``status_detail`` attribute to result objects which
  * is populated when the status is ``'invalid recipient'``
    (encryption/decryption) or ``'invalid signer'``
    (signing). This attribute will be set when the result object's
    ``status`` attribute is set to ``invalid recipient`` and will
    contain more information about the failure in the form of
    ``reason:ident`` where ``reason`` is a text description of the
    reason, and ``ident`` identifies the recipient key.

  * Add ``scan_keys_mem()`` function to scan keys in a string. Thanks
    to Sky Moore for the patch.
  * Fix #214: Handle multiple signatures when one of them is invalid
    or unverified.
  * A ``problems`` attribute was added which holds problems reported
    by ``gpg`` during verification. This is a list of dictionaries,
    one for each reported problem. Each dictionary will have
    ``status`` and ``keyid`` keys indicating
    the problem and the corresponding key; other information in the
    dictionaries will be error specific.
  * Fix #217: Use machine-readable interface to query the ``gpg``
    version.
  * Added the ability to export keys to a file.

Sat Sep 17 07:21:39 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.5.0:
  * Fixed #181: Added the ability to pass file paths to encrypt_file, decrypt_file,
    sign_file, verify_file, get_recipients_file and added import_keys_file.
  * Fixed #183: Handle FAILURE and UNEXPECTED conditions correctly. Thanks to sebbASF for
    the patch.
  * Fixed #185: Handle VALIDSIG arguments more robustly.
  * Fixed #188: Remove handling of DECRYPTION_FAILED from Verify code, as not required
    there. Thanks to sebbASF for the patch.
  * Fixed #190: Handle KEY_CREATED more robustly.
  * Fixed #191: Handle NODATA messages during verification.
  * Fixed #196: Don't log chunk data by default, as it could contain sensitive
    information (during decryption, for example).
  * Added the ability to pass an environment to the gpg executable. Thanks to Edvard
    Rejthar for the patch.

  * Add check for invalid file objects.
  * Provide more useful status message when a secret key is absent.
  * Added a get_recipients() API to find the recipients of an encrypted
    message without decrypting it.

  * Fixed #128: Added ECC support by changing key generation parameters. (The Key-Length
    value isn't added if a curve is specified.)

Thu Jan 24 09:31:19 UTC 2019 - Karol Babioch <kbabioch@suse.de>

- Update to 0.4.4:
  * Changed how any return value from the ``on_data`` callable is processed. In
    earlier versions, the return value was ignored. In this version, if the
    return value is ``False``, the data received from ``gpg`` is not buffered.
    Otherwise (if the value is ``None`` or ``True``, for example), the data is
    buffered as normal. This functionality can be used to do your own
    buffering, or to prevent buffering altogether.  The ``on_data`` callable is
    also called once with an empty byte-string to signal the end of data from
    ``gpg``.
  * Added an additional attribute ``check_fingerprint_collisions`` to
    ``GPG`` instances, which defaults to ``False``. It seems that ``gpg`` is
    happy to have duplicate keys and fingerprints in a keyring, so we can't be
    too strict. A user can set this attribute of an instance to ``True`` to
    trigger a check for collisions.
  * With GnuPG 2.2.7 or later, provide the fingerprint of a signing key for a
    failed signature verification, if available.
  * For verification where multiple signatures are involved, a mapping of
    signature_ids to fingerprint, keyid, username, creation date, creation
    timestamp and expiry timestamp is provided.
  * Added a check to disallow certain control characters ('\r', '\n', NUL) in
    passphrases (CVE-2019-6690 bsc#1123498)

Wed Jun 13 19:37:41 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- uppate to 0.4.3:
  * Add --no-verbose to the gpg command line, in case verbose is
    specified is gpg.conf.
  * This is mitigation against CVE-2018-12020 boo#1096745
- includes changes from 0.4.2:
  * Subkey information is now collected and returned in a
    subkey_info dictionary keyed by the subkey's ID
  * Add expect_passphrase password for use on GnuPG >= 2.1 when
    passing passphrase to gpg via pinentry
  * Provid a trust_keys method to allow setting the trust level
    for keys
  * When the gpg executable is not found, note the path used in the
    exception message
  * Make error messages nor informational
