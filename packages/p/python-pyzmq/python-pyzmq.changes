-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 25 20:35:28 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 24.0.1:
  * Fix several possible resource warnings and deprecation warnings
    when cleaning up contexts and sockets, especially in pyzmq's own
    tests and when implicit teardown of objects is happening during
    process teardown.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 17 15:41:41 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 24.0.0:
  * Breaking changes:
    + Due to a libzmq bug causing unavoidable crashes for some users,
      Windows wheels no longer bundle libzmq with AF_UNIX support. In
      order to enable AF_UNIX on Windows, pyzmq must be built from
      source, linking an appropriate build of libzmq
      (e.g. libzmq-v142). AF_UNIX support will be re-enabled in pyzmq
      wheels when libzmq published fixed releases.
    + Using a {class}zmq.Context as a context manager or deleting a
      context without closing it now calls {meth}zmq.Context.destroy
      at exit instead of {meth}zmq.Context.term. This will have little
      effect on most users, but changes what happens when user bugs
      result in a context being implicitly destroyed while sockets are
      left open. In almost all cases, this will turn what used to be a
      hang into a warning. However, there may be some cases where
      sockets are actively used in threads, which could result in a
      crash. To use sockets across threads, it is critical to properly
      and explicitly close your contexts and sockets, which will
      always avoid this issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 17 03:13:44 UTC 2022 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 23.2.1:
  * Improvements:
    + First release with wheels for Python 3.11 (thanks
      cibuildwheel!).
    + linux aarch64 wheels now bundle the same libzmq (4.3.4) as all
      other builds, thanks to switching to native arm builds on
      CircleCI.
  * Fixes:
    + Some type annotation fixes in devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 28 19:16:08 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 23.2.0
  * Use zmq.Event enums in parse_monitor_message for nicer reprs
  * Fix building bundled libzmq with ZMQ_DRAFT_API=1
  * Fix subclassing zmq.Context with additional arguments in the
    constructor. Subclasses may now have full control over the
    signature, rather than purely adding keyword-only arguments
  * Typos and other small fixes
- Release 23.1.0
  * Fix global name of zmq.EVENT_HANDSHAKE_* constants
  * Fix constants missing when using import zmq.green as zmq
  * {func}zmq.utils.monitor.recv_monitor_msg now supports async
    Sockets.
- Release 23.0.0
  * all zmq constants are now available as Python enums (e.g.
    zmq.SocketType.PULL, zmq.SocketOption.IDENTITY), generated
    statically from zmq.h instead of at compile-time. This means
    that checks for the presence of a constant (hasattr(zmq,
    'RADIO')) is not a valid check for the presence of a feature.
    This practice has never been robust, but it may have worked
    sometimes. Use direct checks via e.g. {func}zmq.has or
    {func}zmq.zmq_version_info.
  * A bit more type coverage of Context.term and Context.socket
  * Remove all use of deprecated stdlib distutils
  * Update to Cython 0.29.30 (required for Python 3.11
    compatibility)
  * Compatibility with Python 3.11.0b1
  * Switch to myst for docs
  * Deprecate zmq.utils.strtypes, now unused
  * Updates to autoformatting, linting
- Drop less-flaky.patch: pytest-rerunfailures without the flaky
  package can handle it.
- Fix rpmlint errors
  * no-dependency-on python-base 3.X: depend on python(abi) = 3.X
  * unused-rpmlintrc-filter: Was unflavored, not required with the
    above -- drop rpmlintc
  * spurious-executable-perm: fix by chmod -x
  * obsolete-suse-version-check 1000. This package is not branched
    into any project for the maintenance of other distributions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  5 23:03:59 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

    garbage collection, which can be a source of hangs and leaks
    (matches open files)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 11 10:15:01 UTC 2021 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 22.2.1
  * Nicer reprs of contexts and sockets
  * Memory allocated by recv(copy=False) is no longer read-only

- Update to 22.0.3
  * Fix fork-safety bug in garbage collection thread (regression
    in 20.0) when using subprocesses.
- Changes in 22.0.1
  * Fix type of Frame.bytes for non-copying recvs with CFFI
    backend (regression in 21.0)
- Changes in 22.0.0
  * This is a major release due to changes in wheels and building
    on Windows. Code changes from 21.0 are minimal.
  * Some typing fixes
  * Bump bundled libzmq to 4.3.4
- Relevant Changes in 21.0
  * pyzmq 21 is a major version bump because of dropped support
    for old Pythons and some changes in packaging. CPython users
    should not face major compatibility issues if installation
    works at all :) PyPy users may see issues with the new
    implementation of send/recv. If you do, please report them!
  The big changes are:
  * drop support for Python 3.5. Python >= 3.6 is required
  * mypy type stubs, which should improve static analysis of
    pyzmq, especially for dynamically defined attributes such as
    zmq constants. These are new! Let us know if you find any
    issues.
  * support for zero-copy and sending bufferables with cffi
    backend. This is experimental! Please report issues.
  Packaging updates:
  * Require Python >= 3.6, required for good type annotation
    support
  * rework cffi backend in setup.py
  New features:
  * zero-copy support in CFFI backend (send(copy=False) now does
    something).
  * Support sending any buffer-interface-providing objects in CFFI
    backend.
  Bugs fixed:
  * Errors during teardown of asyncio Sockets
- Don't test numpy on python36 flavor, because python36-numpy is
  no longer available in Tumbleweed (NEP 29)
- Make sure we use the Cython backend, not CFFI, wich is for PyPy.
  * fixes gh#zeromq/pyzmq#1431 and gh#zeromq/pyzmq#1432
- Remove skip_test_tracker.patch
- Got an oom error on the build service: Require at least 8GB of
  RAM through _constraints file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 25 16:26:52 UTC 2020 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- update to version 20.0.0:

  * drops support for Python < 3.5
  * Respect $PKG_CONFIG env for finding libzmq when building from source
  * :meth:`.Socket.bind` and :meth:`.Socket.connect`
    can now be used as context managers.
  * Hold GIL while calling ``zmq_curve_`` functions,
    which may fix apparent threadsafety issues.

    Changes to garbage collection in Python 3.4 make this 
    impossible to do sensibly.
  + :meth:`ZMQStream.close` closes its socket immediately,
    rather than scheduling a timeout.
  + Raise the original ImportError when importing zmq fails.
    Should be more informative than `no module cffi...`.
- Update to 14.2.0
  + New Stuff
    * Raise new ZMQVersionError when a requested method is not 
      supported by the linked libzmq.
      For backward compatibility, this subclasses 
      NotImplementedError.
  + Bugs Fixed
    * Memory leak introduced in pyzmq-14.0 in zero copy.
    * OverflowError on 32 bit systems in zero copy.
- Update to 14.1.0
  + Security
    The headline features for 14.1 are adding better support for 
    libzmq's security features.
    * When libzmq is bundled as a Python extension 
      (e.g. wheels, eggs), libsodium is also bundled 
      (excluding Windows), ensuring that libzmq security is 
      available to users who install from wheels
    * New :mod:`zmq.auth`, implementing zeromq's ZAP authentication,
      modeled on czmq zauth.
      For more information, see the 
      `examples <https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/tree/master/examples/>`_.
  + Other New Stuff
    * Add PYZMQ_BACKEND for enabling use of backends outside the
      pyzmq codebase.
    * Add :attr:`~.Context.underlying` property and 
      :meth:`~.Context.shadow` method to Context and Socket, for 
      handing off sockets and contexts. between pyzmq and other
      bindings (mainly pyczmq_).
    * Add TOS, ROUTER_HANDOVER, and IPC_FILTER constants from 
      libzmq-4.1-dev.
    * Add Context option support in the CFFI backend.
    * Various small unicode and build fixes, as always.
    * :meth:`~.Socket.send_json` and :meth:`~.Socket.recv_json`
      pass any extra kwargs to ``json.dumps/loads``.
  + Deprecations
    * ``Socket.socket_type`` is deprecated, in favor of 
      ``Socket.type``, which has been available since 2.1.
- Update to 14.0.1
  + Bugfix release
    * Update bundled libzmq to current (4.0.3).
    * Fix bug in :meth:`.Context.destroy` with no open sockets.
    * Threadsafety fixes in the garbage collector.
    * Python 3 fixes in :mod:`zmq.ssh`.

- Update to version 14.0.0
  + Update bundled libzmq to current (4.0.1).
  + Backends are now implemented in ``zmq.backend`` instead of ``zmq.core``.
    This has no effect on public APIs.
  + Various build improvements for Cython and CFFI backends (PyPy
    compiles at build time).
  + Various GIL-related performance improvements - the GIL is no longer
    touched from a zmq IO thread.
  + Adding a constant should now be a bit easier - only zmq/sugar/constant
   _names should need updating,
    all other constant-related files should be automatically updated by
    ``setup.py constants``.
  + add support for latest libzmq-4.0.1
    (includes ZMQ_CURVE security and socket event monitoring).
- Changes from version 13.1.0
  + The main new feature is improved tornado 3 compatibility.
    PyZMQ ships a 'minitornado' submodule, which contains a small
    subset of tornado 3.0.1,
    in order to get the IOLoop base class.  zmq.eventloop.ioloop.IOLoop
    is now a simple subclass, and if the system tornado is ≥ 3.0, then
    the zmq IOLoop is a proper registered subclass of the tornado one itself,
    and minitornado is entirely unused.
- Changes from version 13.0.2
  + EAGAIN was unconditionally turned into KeyboardInterrupt
  + fix use of totally deprecated ctypes_configure to generate constants in CFFI backend
  + fix memory leak in CFFI backend for PyPy
  + typo prevented IPC_PATH_MAX_LEN from ever being defined
  + various build fixes - linking with librt, Cython compatibility, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 09:32:34 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

- Update to version 2.1.11:
  * remove support for LABEL prefixes. A major feature of libzmq-3.0, the LABEL
    prefix, has been removed from libzmq, prior to the first stable libzmq 3.x release.
    * The prefix argument to ~.Socket.send_multipart remains, but it continue to behave in
      exactly the same way as it always has on 2.1.x, simply prepending message parts.
    * ~.Socket.recv_multipart will always return a list, because prefixes are once
      again indistinguishable from regular message parts.
  * add .Socket.poll method, for simple polling of events on a single socket.
  * no longer require monkeypatching tornado IOLoop.  The :class:.ioloop.ZMQPoller class
    is a poller implementation that matches tornado's expectations, and pyzmq sockets can
    be used with any tornado application just by specifying the use of this poller. The
    pyzmq IOLoop implementation now only trivially differs from tornado's.
- Don't package documentation sources

    to prevent Python-C API calls in the nogil section.
  * Added a protocol argument to pyobj_send that defaults to -1 (the
    highest pickle protocol).
  * Added a try/finally in Socket.recv.
