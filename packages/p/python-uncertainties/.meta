  <title>Calculations with Uncertainties (aka &quot;Error Propagation&quot;)</title>
  <description>&quot;Uncertainties&quot; allows calculations such as (2 +/- 0.1)*2 = 4
+/- 0.2 to be performed transparently; much more complex mathematical
expressions involving numbers with uncertainty can also be evaluated
directly.
