%description
The colormap package provides utilities to convert colors between
RGB, HEX, HLS, HUV and a class to build colormaps for matplotlib. All
matplotlib colormaps and some R colormaps are available altogether. The
plot_colormap method is able to pick up a colormaps and
the test_colormap can be used to visually test a new colormap.

# matplotlib depends on numpy anyway, use that as replacement for easydev.easytest using nose
