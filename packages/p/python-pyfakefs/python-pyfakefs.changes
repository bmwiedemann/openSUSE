-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 10 07:06:37 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.2.2:
  * Made the user and group IDs accessible via dedicated
    ``get_uid`` and ``get_gid`` functions
    (for symmetry to ``set_uid`` / ``set_gid``)
  * The test fixture is now included in the source distribution
    and installed with the package.
  * Some public constants in `fake_filesystem` that had been
    moved to `helpers` are made accessible from there again

    `os.getgid` (Posix only)
  * Make sure a `/tmp` path exists under linux (`TMPDIR` may
    point elsewhere)
  * Support for latest Python 3.12 version.
  * Properties defining the capabilities of some `os` functions
    like `os.supports_follow_symlinks` are now properly faked to
    contain the fake functions if the real functions are faked
  * Supports current Python 3.12 version (alpha 6). We plan to
    make patch releases in case of breaking changes in alpha
    or beta versions.
  * Fake module classes previously defined in `fake_filesystem`
    have now moved to their own modules: `fake_os.FakeOsModule`,
    `fake_path.FakePathModule`, `fake_io.FakeIoModule` and
    `fake_open.FakeFileOpen`.
  * Patching of parsers for pandas >= 1.2 is removed since pandas
    now uses Python fs functions internally even when the engine
    selected is "c".
  * added possibility to set a path inaccessible under Windows by
    using `chown()` with the `force_unix_mode` flag (see #720)
  * added class level setup method `setUpClassPyfakefs` for
    unittest and class-scoped
  * fixture `fs_class` for pytest (see #752)
  * added experimental support for Python 3.12: added fake APIs
    for Windows junction support. These are not implemented and
    always return `False`.
  * added Python 3.12 to the test suite.
  * migrated to setuptools declarative syntax.
  * fixed docker tests when running on branches containing
    forward slashes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 12 14:10:11 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to version 4.7.0
  Changes
  fs fixtures cannot be nested; any nested fs fixture
  (for example inside an fs_session or fs_module fixture) will just reference the outer fixture (the behavior had been unexpected before)
  Fixes
  reverted a performance optimization introduced in version 3.3.0 that caused hanging tests with installed torch (see #693)
  do not use the build-in opener in pathlib as it may cause problems (see #697)
  add support for path-like objects in shutil.disk_usage (see #699)
  do not advertise support for Python 3.6 in setup.py (see #707)
  return the expected type from fcntl.ioctl and fcntl.fcntl calls if arg is of type byte; the call itself does nothing as before
  do not skip filesystem modules by name to allow using own modules with the same name (see #707)
  add missing support for os.renames (see #714)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 14:41:13 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 4.6.3
  * automatically reset filesystem on changing is_windows_fs or
    is_macos (see #692) - ensures better upwards compatibility in
    most cases
  * Make sure you write to the filesystem after you change
    is_windows_fs or is_macos, otherwise the changes will be lost.
  * fixed regression: os.path.exists returned True for any root
    drive path under Windows
- Update to 4.6.2
  * fixed support for opener introduced in previous patch release
    (see #689)
  * added support for opener argument in open, which is used in
    tempfile in Python 3.11 since beta 4 (see #686)
  * make sure tests run without pyfakefs installed as a package
    (see #687)
- Version 4.6.0
  * Adds support for Python 3.11, removes support for Python 3.6,
    changes root path behavior under Windows.
  * Python 3.6 has reached its end of life on 2021/12/23 and is no
    longer officially supported by pyfakefs ** os.stat_float_times
    has been removed in Python 3.7 and is therefore no longer
    supported under Windows, the root path is now effectively C:\
    instead of \; a path starting with \ points to the current
    drive as in the real file system (see #673)
  * fake pathlib.Path.owner() and pathlib.Path.group() now behave
    like the real methods - they look up the real user/group name
    for the user/group id that is associated with the fake file
    (see #678)
  * added some support for the upcoming Python version 3.11 (see
    #677)
  * added convenience fixtures for module- and session based fs
    fixtures (fs_module and fs_session)
  * fixed an incompatibility of tmpdir (and probably other
    fixtures) with the module-scoped version of fs; had been
    introduced in pyfakefs 4.5.5 by the fix for #666 (see #684)
- Version 4.5.6
  * Fixes a regression which broke tests with older pytest versions
    (< 3.9).
  * minimum supported pytest version is now 3.0 (older versions do
    not work properly with current Python versions)
  * only skip _pytest.pathlib in pytest versions where it is
    actually present (see #669)
- Version 4.5.5
  * Bugfix release, needed for compatibility with pytest 7.0.
  * correctly handle file system space for files opened in write
    mode (see #660)
  * correctly handle reading/writing pipes via file (see #661)
  * disallow encoding argument on binary open() (see #664)
  * fixed compatibility issue with pytest 7.0.0 (see #666)
- Version 4.5.4
  * added missing mocked functions for fake pipe (see #650)
  * fixed some bytes warnings (see #651)
- Don't catchall in files section

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 14 04:24:56 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 4.5.3:
  * New Features
    + added support for some Python 3.10 features:
    + new method pathlib.Path.hardlink_to
    + new newline argument in pathlib.Path.write_text
    + new follow_symlinks argument in pathlib.Path.stat and pathlib.Path.chmod
    + new 'strict' argument in os.path.realpath
    + added support for pathlib.Path.link_to (new in Python 3.8) (see #580)
    + added support for pathlib.Path.readlink (new in Python 3.9) (see #584)
    + added FakeFilesystem.create_link convenience method which creates intermittent directories (see #580)
  * Changes
    + Python 3.5 has reached its end of life in September 2020 and is no longer supported
    + pathlib2 is still supported, but considered to have the same functionality as pathlib and is no longer tested separately; the previous behavior broke newer pathlib features if pathlib2 was installed (see #592)
    + Added caching of patched modules to avoid lookup overhead
    + Added use_cache option and clear_cache method to be able to deal with unwanted side effects of the newly introduced caching
    + The patchfs decorator now expects a positional argument instead of the keyword arguments fs. This avoids confusion with the pytest fs fixture and conforms to the behavior of mock.patch. You may have to adapt the argument order if you use the patchfs and mock.patch decorators together (see #566)
    + Default arguments that are file system functions are now not patched by default to avoid a large performance impact. An additional parameter patch_default_args has been added that switches this behavior on (see #567).
  * Fixes
    + added handling of path-like where missing
    + improved handling of str/bytes paths
    + suppress all warnings while inspecting loaded modules (see #614)
    + do not import pandas and related modules if it is not patched (see #627)
    + handle pathlib.Path.owner() and pathlib.Path.group by returning the current user/group name (see #629)
    + fixed handling of use_known_patches=False (could cause an exception)
    + correctly handle byte paths in os.path.exists (see #595)
    + Update fake_pathlib to support changes coming in Python 3.10 (see
    + correctly handle UNC paths in os.path.split and in directory path evaluation (see #606)
    + fixed handling of pipe descriptors in the fake filesystem (see #581)
    + added non-functional argument effective_ids to os.access (see #585)
    + correctly handle os.file for unreadable files (see #588)
    + Reverted one Windows-specific optimization that can break tests under some conditions (see #573)
    + Setting os did not reset os.sep and related variables, fixed null device name, added os.pathsep and missing os.path variables (see #572)
    + open calls had not been patched for modules with a name ending with "io" (see #569)
    + remove dependency of pyfakefs on pytest (regression, see #565)
