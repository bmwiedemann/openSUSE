%description
IO::Pager can be used to locate an available pager and set the _PAGER_
environment variable (see NOTES). It is also a factory for creating I/O
objects such as IO::Pager::Buffered and IO::Pager::Unbuffered.

IO::Pager subclasses are designed to programmatically decide whether or not
to pipe a filehandle's output to a program specified in _PAGER_. Subclasses
may implement only the IO handle methods desired and inherit the remainder
of those outlined below from IO::Pager. For anything else, YMMV. See the
appropriate subclass for implementation specific details.
