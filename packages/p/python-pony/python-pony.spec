%description
Pony ORM is a object-relational mapper for Python. Using Pony, users
can create and maintain database-oriented software applications. Pony
is able to write queries to the database using generator expressions.
Pony then analyzes the abstract syntax tree of a generator and
translates it to its SQL equivalent.
