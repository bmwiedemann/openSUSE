Tue Nov  7 10:47:13 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 8.0.0:
  - This is a major release which removes a number of things
    which have been deprecated for a number of years. The most
    significant change in this release is that the Qt toolkit
    backend has been moved from the pyface.ui.qt4 package to the
  - Additionally this release uses the module-level __getattr__
    system introduced in Python 3.7 to delay imports from
    the api modules which have side-effects, particularly
    toolkit selection. This means that you can, for example,
    import pyface.api and toolkit selection will be deferred
    until you actually request a class or object which is
    toolkit-dependent. Part of this included adding formal
    interfaces for ActionManager and its subclasses
  - adds support for Python 3.11 and drops support for Python 3.6
  - adds support for PySide 6.4+ and the new enum system
  - removes code supporting PyQt4, and supports more modern
    imports from pyface.qt, such as pyface.qt.QtWidgets.
  - removes many things flagged as deprecated in Pyface 7
  - consistently add interface classes to api modules.
  - adds new Field subclasses, including an ImageField and
    LabelField
  - moves to a pyproject.toml-based packaging solution, removing
    setup.py
- Add skip-qt4-tests.patch to overcome gh#enthought/pyface#1252
- Comment out dependency on Pillow to overcome gh#enthought/pyface#1255

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  4 21:49:53 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.4.4:
  * This is a quick bugfix release that resolves some issues with the 7.4.3
    release on CI for downstream projects.  The issues were on testing code,
    and so shouldn't impact application code or behaviour.
  * Don't raise ConditionTimeoutError if test doesn't time out (#1182)
- update to 7.4.3:
  * Fix code editor gutter widget on recent Python versions (#1176)
  * fix issues with FileDialog and DirectoryDialog close method on Linux
  * update setup.py metadata (#1173)
  * restrict to PySide versions before 6.4.0 (#1169)
  * don't do unneccessary evaluations of conditions in EventLoopHelper
  * fix a deleted object error in PyQt5 (#1161)
  * better reporting of toolkit errors (#1157)
  * fix some Python 2 style print statements in documentation (#1157)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 22 11:45:57 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Removed pyface-pr958-qt5deprecation.patch because it's not needed anymore
  with the new version

- Add fix-wx-tests.patch to be able to run all wx tests

- Update to 7.4.2
 * fixes for Qt workbench backend (#1149)
 * fix ConsoleWidget PySide6 issues (#1146, #1147)
 * fix default AboutDialog image (#1142)
 * remove reference cycle for actions on clean-up (#1143)
 * status bar manager not cleaned up properly (#1141)
 * expose QOpenGLWidget in a consistent place in pyface.qt (#1138)
 * map popup menu coordinates to global (#1137)
 * fix issues with last window close on Qt6 (#1136)
 * font size and stretch are ints at the toolkit level (#1118)
- Release 7.4.1
 * fix segfaults and memory corruption from dropped QImage references (#1108)
- Release 7.4.0
 * adding intermediate interfaces and classes to collect common roles and
   behaviours.
 * adding hooks to control widget sizing behaviour within layouts/sizers.
   deprecating behavior where a class creates the underlying toolkit widget in
   the __init__ method. This was done by a small minority of Widget classes,
   now all widgets are able to use two-step creation (first the
   instance, then the toolkit object via the create() method).
 * creating Qt versions of some widgets, and filling in some gaps in widget
   types (particularly for Fields)
 * providing image classes that wrap PIL images and NumPy arrays that allow
   dynamic images and icons in addition to the resource-based versions.
 * providing a toolkit-independent Font class and corresponding trait that
   supports similar use-cases to the existing TraitsUI Font trait.
 * extracting the menu and toolbar Schema system from Tasks and making it more
   generally useable.

Wed Jan 12 12:43:05 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Add pyface-pr958-qt5deprecation.patch for python310 test failures
  * gh#enthought/pyface#958, gh#enthought/pyface#873

    weirdly also fixes the previously encountered problems with
    wx in python39 and python310 as well.

    non-hierarchical tabular data. See Pyface DataViews

    Additional examples are also added to the source
    distribution. Please note that as of this release the
    API is provisional.
  * A new pyface.color.Color class and a corresponding 
    pyface.ui_traits.PyfaceColor trait type have been
    introduced to support representing colors via a toolkit 
    independent API. See Trait Types section of the user manual 
    for further details.
