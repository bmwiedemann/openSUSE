  <title>High Dynamic Range Images and Video manipulation tools</title>
  <description>pfstools package is a set of command line (and one GUI) programs for
reading, writing, manipulating and viewing high-dynamic range (HDR)
images and video frames. All programs in the package exchange data
using a simple generic file format (pfs) for HDR data. The concept of
the pfstools is similar to netpbm package for low-dynamic range images.</description>
