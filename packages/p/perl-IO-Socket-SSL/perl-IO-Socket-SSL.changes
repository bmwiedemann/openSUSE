  - test fixes and improvements
    - stability improvements for live tests
    - regenerate certificate in certs/ and make sure they are limited to the

    functions with dummies instead of removing NPN completly or setting
    OPENSSL_NO_NEXTPROTONEG
  - t/01loadmodule.t shows more output helpful in debugging problems
  - update fingerprints for extenal tests
  - update documentation to make behavior of syswrite more clear

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 21 15:37:34 UTC 2017 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 2.051
  - syswrite: if SSL_write sets SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL but no $! (as seen with
    OpenSSL 1.1.0 on Windows) set $! to EPIPE to propagate a useful error up
    https://github.com/noxxi/p5-io-socket-ssl/issues/62
  - removed unecessary settings of SSL_version and SSL_cipher_list from tests
  - protocol_version.t can now deal when TLS 1.0 and/or TLS 1.1 are not supported
    as is the case with openssl versions in latest Debian (buster)
  - fixed problem caused by typo in the context of session cache
    https://github.com/noxxi/p5-io-socket-ssl/issues/60
  - update PublicSuffix information from publicsuffix.org
  - fixed small memory leaks during destruction of socket and context, RT#120643
  - better fix for problem which 2.046 tried to fix but broke LWP this way
  - cleanup everything in DESTROY and make sure to start with a fresh %{*self}
    in configure_SSL because it can happen that a GLOB gets used again without
    calling DESTROY (https://github.com/noxxi/p5-io-socket-ssl/issues/56)
  - fixed memory leak caused by not destroying CREATED_IN_THIS_THREAD for SSL
    objects -> github pull#55
  - optimization: don't track SSL objects and CTX in *CREATED_IN_THIS_THREAD
    if perl is compiled w/o thread support
  - small fix in t/protocol_version.t to use older versions of Net::SSLeay
    with openssl build w/o SSLv3 support
  - when setting SSL_keepSocketOnError to true the socket will not be closed
    on fatal error. This is a modified version of
    https://github.com/noxxi/p5-io-socket-ssl/pull/53/
  - protect various 'eval'-based capability detections at startup with a localized
    __DIE__ handler. This way dynamically requiring IO::Socket::SSL as done by
    various third party software should cause less problems even if there is a
    global __DIE__ handler which does not properly deal with 'eval'.
  - make t/session_ticket.t work with OpenSSL 1.1.0. With this version the
    session does not get reused any longer if it was not properly closed which
    is now done using an explicit close by the client which causes a
    proper SSL_shutdown
  - enable session ticket callback with Net::SSLeay>=1.80
  - leave session ticket callback off for now until the needed patch is
    included in Net::SSLeay. See
    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116118#txn-1696146
  - fix detection of default CA path for OpenSSL 1.1.x
  - Utils::CERT_asHash now includes the signature algorithm used
  - Utils::CERT_asHash can now deal with large serial numbers
  - OpenSSL 1.1.0c changed the behavior of SSL_read so that it now returns -1 on
    EOF without proper SSL shutdown. Since it looks like that this behavior will
    be kept at least for 1.1.1+ adapt to the changed API by treating errno=NOERR
    on SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL as EOF.
  - restrict session ticket callback to Net::SSLeay 1.79+ since version before
    contains bug. Add test for session reuse
  - extend SSL fingerprint to pubkey digest, i.e. 'sha1$pub$xxxxxx....'
  - fix t/external/ocsp.t to use different server (under my control) to check 
    OCSP stapling
  - fix session cache del_session: it freed the session but did not properly
    remove it from the cache. Further reuse causes crash.
  - disable OCSP support when Net::SSLeay 1.75..1.77 is used, see RT#116795
  - move handling of global SSL arguments into creation of context, so that these
    get also applied when creating a context only.
  - support for session ticket reuse over multiple contexts and processes
    (if supported by Net::SSLeay)
  - small optimizations, like saving various Net::SSLeay constants into variables
    and access variables instead of calling the constant sub all the time
  - make t/dhe.t work with openssl 1.1.0
  - Set session id context only on the server side. Even if the documentation for
    SSL_CTX_set_session_id_context makes clear that this function is server side
    only it actually affects hndling of session reuse on the client side too and
    can result in error "SSL3_GET_SERVER_HELLO:attempt to reuse session in
    different context" at the client.
  - Utils::CERT_create - don't add given extensions again if they were already
    added. Firefox croaks with sec_error_extension_value_invalid if (specific?)
    extensions are given twice.
  - assume that Net::SSLeay::P_PKCS12_load_file will return the CA certificates
    with the reverse order as in the PKCS12 file, because that's what it does.
  - support for creating ECC keys in Utils once supported by Net::SSLeay
  - remove internal sub session_cache and access cache directly (faster)
  - fix del_session method in case a single item was in the cache
  - use SSL_session_key as the real key for the cache and not some derivate of it,
    so that it works to remove the entry using the same key
  - add del_session method to session cache
  - only added Changes for 2.026
  - update default server and client ciphers based on recommendation of
    Mozilla and what the current browsers use. Notably this finally disables
    RC4 for the client (was disabled for server long ago) and adds CHACHA20.
- drop perl-IO-Socket-SSL_add_DHE-RSA_to_default_client_cipher_list.patch
  (upstream)

- updated to 2.024
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-IO-Socket-SSL/Changes

  2.024 2016/02/06
  - Work around issue where the connect fails on systems having only a loopback
    interface and where IO::Socket::IP is used as super class (default when
    available). Since IO::Socket::IP sets AI_ADDRCONFIG by default connect to
    localhost would fail on this systems. This happened at least for the tests,
    see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813796
    Workaround is to explicitely set GetAddrInfoFlags to 0 if no GetAddrInfoFlags
    is set but the Family/Domain is given. In this case AI_ADDRCONFIG would not
    be useful anyway but would cause at most harm.
  2.023 2016/01/30
  - OpenSSL 1.0.2f changed the behavior of SSL shutdown in case the TLS connection
    was not fully established (commit: f73c737c7ac908c5d6407c419769123392a3b0a9).
    This somehow resulted in Net::SSLeay::shutdown returning 0 (i.e. keep trying)
    which caused an endless loop. It will now ignore this result in case the TLS
    connection was not yet established and consider the TLS connection closed
    instead.
  2.022 2015/12/10

    using a different wrapper depending on which module I use for IPv6.
    Thanks to bluhm for reporting.
  2.018 2015/08/27
  - RT#106687 - startssl.t failed on darwin with old openssl since server 
    requested client certificate but offered also anon ciphers
  2.017 2015/08/24
  - checks for readability of files/dirs for certificates and CA no longer use
    -r because this is not safe when ACLs are used. Thanks to BBYRD, RT#106295
  - new method sock_certificate similar to peer_certificate based on idea of
    Paul Evans, RT#105733
  - get_fingerprint can now take optional certificate as argument and compute
    the fingerprint of it. Useful in connection with sock_certificate.
  - check for both EWOULDBLOCK and EAGAIN since these codes are different on
    some platforms. Thanks to Andy Grundman, RT#106573
  - enforce default verification scheme if none was specified, i.e. no longer
    just warn but accept. If really no verification is wanted a scheme of 
    'none' must be explicitly specified.
  - support different cipher suites per SNI hosts
- remove perl-IO-Socket-SSL_fix_offline.patch

Fri Apr 17 12:32:39 UTC 2015 - vcizek@suse.com

- add DHE-RSA to the default client cipher list to support PFS with
  older machines (bnc#924976)
  * added perl-IO-Socket-SSL_add_DHE-RSA_to_default_client_cipher_list.patch
- add cpanspec.yml to support automatic version updates
  (see http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2015-04/msg00084.html)

- updated to 2.012
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-IO-Socket-SSL/Changes

  2.012 2014/02/02
  - fix t/ocsp.t in case no HTTP::Tiny is installed
  2.011 2014/02/01
  - fix t/ocsp.t - don't count on revoked.grc.com using OCSP stapling #101855
  - added option 'purpose' to Utils::CERT_create to get better control of the
    certificates purpose. Default is 'server,client' for non-CA (contrary to
    only 'server' before)
  - removed RC4 from default cipher suites on the server site
    https://github.com/noxxi/p5-io-socket-ssl/issues/22
  - refactoring of some tests using Test::More thanks to Sweet-kid and the
    2015 Pull Request Challenge
  2.010 2014/01/14
  - new options SSL_client_ca_file and SSL_client_ca to let the server send
    the list of acceptable CAs for the client certificate.
  - t/protocol_version.t - fix in case SSLv3 is not supported in Net::SSLeay. 
    RT#101485, thanks to TEAM.
  2.009 2014/01/12
  - remove util/analyze.pl. This tool is now together with other SSL tools in
    https://github.com/noxxi/p5-ssl-tools
  - added ALPN support (needs OpenSSL1.02, Net::SSLeay 1.56+) thanks to TEAM,
    RT#101452
  2.008 2014/12/16
  - work around recent OCSP verification errors for revoked.grc.com (badly signed
    OCSP response, Firefox also complains about it) in test t/external/ocsp.t.
  - util/analyze.pl - report more details about preferred cipher for specific TLS
    versions
  2.007 2014/11/26
  - make getline/readline fall back to super class if class is not sslified yet,
    i.e. behave the same as sysread, syswrite etc.
    This fixes RT#100529
  2.006 2014/11/22
  - Make (hopefully) non-blocking work on windows by using EWOULDBLOCK instead of
    EAGAIN. While this is the same on UNIX it is different on Windows and socket
    operations return there (WSA)EWOULDBLOCK and not EAGAIN. Enable non-blocking
    tests on Windows too.
  - make PublicSuffix::_default_data thread safe
  - update PublicSuffix with latest list from publicsuffix.org
  2.005 2014/11/15
  - next try to fix t/protocol_version.t for OpenSSL w/o SSLv3 support
  2.004 2014/11/15
  - only test fix: fix t/protocol_version.t to deal with OpenSSL installations
    which are compiled without SSLv3 support.
  2.003 2014/11/14
  - make SSLv3 available even if the SSL library disables it by default in
    SSL_CTX_new (like done in LibreSSL). Default will stay to disable SSLv3,
    so this will be only done when setting SSL_version explicitly.
  - fix possible segmentation fault when trying to use an invalid certificate,
    reported by Nick Andrew.
  - Use only the ICANN part of the default public suffix list and not the
    private domains. This makes existing exceptions for s3.amazonaws.com and
    googleapis.com obsolete. Thanks to Gervase Markham from mozilla.org.
  2.002 2014/10/21
  - fix check for (invalid) IPv4 when validating hostname against certificate. Do
    not use inet_aton any longer because it can cause DNS lookups for malformed
    IP. RT#99448, thanks to justincase[AT]yopmail[DOT]com.
  - Update PublicSuffix with latest version from publicsuffix.org - lots of new
    top level domains.
  - Add exception to PublicSuffix for s3.amazonaws.com - RT#99702, thanks to
    cpan[AT]cpanel[DOT]net.
  2.001 2014/10/21
  - Add SSL_OP_SINGLE_(DH|ECDH)_USE to default options to increase PFS security.
    Thanks to Heikki Vatiainen for suggesting.
  - Update external tests with currently expected fingerprints of hosts.
  - Some fixes to make it still work on 5.8.1.
  2.000 2014/10/15
  - consider SSL3.0 as broken because of POODLE and disable it by default.
  - Skip live tests without asking if environment NO_NETWORK_TESTING is set.
    Thanks to ntyni[AT]debian[DOT]org for suggestion.
  - skip tests which require fork on non-default windows setups without proper
    fork. Thanks to SHAY for https://github.com/noxxi/p5-io-socket-ssl/pull/18
  1.999 2014/10/09
  - make sure we don't use version 0.30 of IO::Socket::IP
  - make sure that PeerHost is checked on all places where PeerAddr is
    checked, because these are synonyms and IO::Socket::IP prefers PeerHost
    while others prefer PeerAddr. Also accept PeerService additionally to
    PeerPort.
    See https://github.com/noxxi/p5-io-socket-ssl/issues/16 for details.
  - add ability to use client certificates and to overwrite hostname with
    util/analyze-ssl.pl.
  1.998 2014/09/07
  - make client authentication work at the server side when SNI is in by use
    having CA path and other settings in all SSL contexts instead of only the main
    one.  Based on code from lundstrom[DOT]jerry[AT]gmail[DOT]com,
    https://github.com/noxxi/p5-io-socket-ssl/pull/15

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 25 09:32:05 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.997, huge Changes 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 22 19:05:20 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.970
 - fix rt#93987 by making sure sub default_ca does use a local $_ and not a
   version of an outer scope which might be read-only.  Thanks to gshank
 1.969 2014/03/13
 - fix set_defaults to match documentation regarding short names
 - new function set_args_filter_hack to make it possible to override bad SSL
   settings from other code at the last moment.
 - determine default_ca on module load (and not on first use in each thread)
 - don't try default hostname verification if verify_mode 0
 - fix hostname verification when reusing context
 1.968 2014/03/13
 - BEHAVIOR CHANGE: removed implicit defaults of certs/server-{cert,key}.pem
   for SSL_{cert,key}_file and ca/,certs/my-ca.pem for SSL_ca_file.
   These defaults were depreceated since 1.951 (2013/7/3).
 - Usable CA verification path on Windows etc:
   Do not use Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_default_verify_paths any longer to set
   system/build dependended default verification path, because there was no
   way to retrieve these default values and check if they contained usable
   CA. Instead re-implement the same algorithm and export the results with
   public function default_ca() and make it possible to overwrite it.
   Also check for usable verification path during build.
   If no usable path are detected require Mozilla::CA at build and try to
   use it at runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  9 13:30:59 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.967
 - verify the hostname inside a certificate by default with a superset of
   common verification schemes instead of not verifying identity at all.
   For now it will only complain if name verification failed, in the future
   it will fail certificate verification, forcing you to set the expected
   SSL_verifycn_name if you want to accept the certificate.
 - new option SSL_fingerprint and new methods get_fingerprint and
   get_fingerprint_bin. Together they can be used to selectively accept
   specific certificates which would otherwise fail verification, like
   self-signed, outdated or from unknown CAs.
   This makes another reason to disable verification obsolete.
 - Utils:
   - default RSA key length 2048
   - digest algorithm to sign certificate in CERT_create can be given,
     defaults to SHA-256
   - CERT_create can now issue non-CA selfsigned certificate
   - CERT_create add some more useful constraints to certificate
 - spelling fixes, thanks to ville[dot]skytta[at]iki[dot]fi
 1.966 2014/01/21
 - fixed bug introduced in 1.964 - disabling TLSv1_2 worked no longer with
   specifying !TLSv12, only !TLSv1_2 worked
 - fixed leak of session objects in SessionCache, if another session 
   replaced an existing session (introduced in 1.965)
 1.965 2014/01/16
 - new key SSL_session_key to influence how sessions are inserted and looked
   up in the clients session cache. This makes it possible to share sessions
   over different ip:host (like required with some FTPS servers)
 - t/core.t - handle case, were default loopback source is not 127.0.0.1, like
   in FreeBSD jails
 1.964 2014/01/15
 - Disabling TLSv1_1 did not work, because the constant was wrong. Now it gets
   the constants from calling Net::SSLeay::SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1 etc
 - The new syntax for the protocols is TLSv1_1 instead of TLSv11.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 29 11:05:49 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.962
 - work around problems with older F5 BIG-IP by offering fewer ciphers on the
   client side by default, so that the client hello stays below 255 byte
 - IO::Socket::SSL::Utils::CERT_create can now create CA-certificates which
   are not self-signed (by giving issuer_*)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 26 07:34:03 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.960
 only documentation enhancements:
 - clarify with text and example code, that within event loops not only
   select/poll should be used, but also pending has to be called.
 - better introduction into SSL, at least mention anonymous authentication as
   something you don't want and should take care with the right cipher
 - make it more clear, that user better does not change the cipher list, unless
   he really know what he is doing
 1.959 2013/11/12
 - bugfix test core.t windows only
 1.958 2013/11/11
 - cleanup: remove workaround for old IO::Socket::INET6 but instead require at
   least version 2.55 which is now 5 years old
 - fix t/session.t #RT90240, thanks to  paul[AT]city-fan[DOT]org
 1.957 2013/11/11
 - fixed t/core.t: test uses cipher_list of HIGH, which includes anonymous
   authorization. With the DH param given by default since 1.956 old versions of
   openssl (like 0.9.8k) used cipher ADH-AES256-SHA (e.g. anonymous
   authorization) instead of AES256-SHA and thus the check for the peer
   certificate failed (because ADH does not exchanges certificates).
   Fixed by explicitly specifying HIGH:!aNULL as cipher
   RT#90221, thanks to  paul[AT]city-fan[DOT]org
 - cleaned up tests: 
   - remove ssl_settings.req and 02settings.t, because all tests now create a
     simple socket at 127.0.0.1 and thus global settings are no longer needed.
   - some tests did not have use strict(!), fixed it.
   - removed special handling for older Net::SSLeay versions, which are less than
     our minimum requirement
   - some syntax enhancements, removed some SSL_version and SSL_cipher_list
     options where they were not really needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  4 09:11:21 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.954
 - accept older versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker and add meta information
   like link to repository only for newer versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 27 11:58:48 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.953
 - fixes to IO::Socket::SSL::Utils, thanks to rurban[AT]x-ray[DOT]at,
   RT#87052
 - fix t/acceptSSL-timeout.t on Win32, RT#86862

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  3 08:20:14 UTC 2013 - lnussel@suse.de

- new version 0.951
  * better document builtin defaults for key,cert,CA and how they are depreceated
  * use Net::SSLeay::SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths to use
    openssl's builtin defaults for CA unless CA path/file was given
  * MAJOR BEHAVIOR CHANGE:
    ssl_verify_mode now defaults to verify_peer for client. Until
    now it used verify_none, but loudly complained since 1.79 about
    it. It will not complain any longer, but the connection might
    probably fail. Please don't simply disable ssl verification, but
    instead set SSL_ca_file etc so that verification succeeds!
  * MAJOR BEHAVIOR CHANGE:
    it will now complain if the builtin defaults of certs/my-ca.pem
    or ca/ for CA and certs/{server,client}-{key,cert}.pem for cert
    and key are used, e.g. no certificates are specified explicitly.
    In the future these insecure (relative path!) defaults will be
    removed and the CA replaced with the system defaults.
  * Makefile.PL reported wrong version of openssl, if Net::SSLeay was not
    installed instead of reporting missing dependency to Net::SSLeay.
  * need at least OpenSSL version 0.9.8 now, since last 0.9.7 was released 6
    years ago. Remove code to work around older releases.
  * changed AUTHOR in Makefile.PL from array back to string, because the
    array feature is not available in MakeMaker shipped with 5.8.9 (RT#85739)
  * Intercept: use sha1-fingerprint of original cert for id into cache unless 
    otherwise given
  * Fix pod error in IO::Socket::SSL::Utils RT#85733
  * added IO::Socket::SSL::Utils for easier manipulation of certificates and keys
  * moved SSL interception into IO::Socket::SSL::Intercept and simplified it 
    using IO::Socket::SSL::Utils
  * enhance meta information in Makefile.PL
  * RT#85290, support more digest, especially SHA-2.
    Thanks to ujvari[AT]microsec[DOT]hu
  * added support for easy SSL interception (man in the middle) based
    on ideas found in mojo*mitm proxy (which was written by Karel Miko)
  * make 1.46 the minimal required version for Net::SSLeay, because it 
    introduced lots of useful functions.
  * if IO::Socket::IP is used it should be at least version 0.20, o
  * Spelling corrections, thanks to dsteinbrunner
- remove the dependency on IO::Socket::INET6 as it breaks the test suite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 11 22:51:07 UTC 2013 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.88
  + consider a value of '' the same as undef for SSL_ca_(path|file)
  + complain if given SSL_(key|cert|ca)_(file|path) do not exist or
    if they are not readable
  + disabled client side SNI for openssl version < 1.0.0 
  + added functions can_client_sni, can_server_sni, can_npn to check 
    avaibility of SNI and NPN features. Added more documentation for 
    SNI and NPN
  + Server Name Indication (SNI) support on the server side 
  + sub error sets $SSL_ERROR etc only if there really is an error,
    otherwise it will keep the latest error. This causes
    IO::Socket::SSL->new.. to report the correct problem, even if
    the problem is deeper in the code (like in connect)
  + deprecated set_ctx_defaults, new name ist set_defaults
  + changed handling of default path for SSL_(ca|cert|key)* keys: either
    if one of these keys is user defined don't add defaults for the
    others, e.g.  don't mix user settings and defaults
  + cleaner handling of module defaults vs. global settings vs. socket
    specific settings 

  + prepare transition to a more secure default for SSL_verify_mode.
  The use of the current default SSL_VERIFY_NONE will cause a big warning
  for clients, unless SSL_verify_mode was explicitly set inside the
  application to this insecure value.
  In the near future the default will be SSL_VERIFY_PEER, and thus
  causing verification failures in unchanged applications.

  + use getnameinfo instead of unpack_sockaddr_in6 to get PeerAddr and
    PeerPort from sockaddr in _update_peer, because this provides scope
  + work around systems which don't defined AF_INET6
  + update_peer for IPv6 also
  + no longer depend on Socket.pm 1.95 for inet_pton, but use 
    Socket6.pm if no current Socket.pm is available
  + made it possible to explicitly disable TLSv11 and TLSv12 in 
    SSL_version
  + fixed documentation errors
  + add support to IO::Socket::IP which support inet6 and inet4 
  + make it possible to disable protols using SSL_version, make 
    SSL_version default to 'SSLv23:!SSLv2'
  + remove SSLv2 from default cipher list 
  + if no explicit cipher list is given it will now default to ALL:!LOW 
    instead of the openssl default, which usually includes weak ciphers
  + new config key SSL_honor_cipher_order and documented how to use it
  + make it thread safer
  + added NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation) support 
  + call CTX_set_session_id_context so that servers session caching 
    works with client certificates too
  + don't make blocking readline if socket was set nonblocking, but 
    return as soon no more data are available
  + if SSLv2 is not supported by Net::SSLeay set SSL_ERROR with useful
    message when attempting to use it 
  + add automatic or explicit (via SSL_hostname) SNI support, needed
    for multiple SSL hostnames with same IP. Currently only supported
    for the client

Sun Jan 10 15:43:32 CET 2010 - jengelh@medozas.de

- enable parallel build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  3 16:01:26 CEST 2009 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.27
 * changed possible local/utf-8 depended \w in some regex against more
   explicit [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Fixed one regex, where it assumed, that service
   names can't have '-' inside
 * fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48131
   where eli[AT]dvns[DOT]com reported warnings when perl -w was used.
   While there made it more aware of errors in Net::ssl_write_all (return
   undef not 0 in generic_write)
 * SECURITY BUGFIX! 
   fix Bug in verify_hostname_of_cert where it matched only the prefix for 
   the hostname when no wildcard was given, e.g. www.example.org matched
   against a certificate with name www.exam in it
   Thanks to MLEHMANN for reporting
 * t/nonblock.t: increase number of bytes written to fix bug with OS X 10.5
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47240

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  6 13:45:00 CEST 2009 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.24
 * add verify hostname scheme ftp, same as http
 * renew test certificates again (root CA expired, now valid for
   10 years)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 23 16:49:53 CET 2009 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.23
 * if neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path are known (e.g not given
   and the default values have no existing file|path) disable
   checking of certificates, but carp about the problem
 * new test certificates, the old ones expired and caused tests 
   to fail
 * Net::SSLeay stores verify callbacks inside hash and never clears
   them, so set verify callback to NULL in destroy of context

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 20 17:50:47 CET 2009 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.20
 * only changes on test suite to make it ready for win32
 * fix verfycn_name autodetection from PeerAddr/PeerHost
 * fixed typo in argument: wildcars_in_cn -> wildcards_in_cn
 * no code changes, publish v.16_3 as v.17 because it looks better 
   than v.16
 * document win32 behavior regarding non-blocking and timeouts
 * fix t/nonblock.t with workaround for problems with 
   IO::Socket::INET on some systems (Mac,5.6.2) where it cannot do 
   nonblocking connect and leaves socket blocked.
 * make some tests less verbose by fixing diag in t/testlib.t 
   (send output to STDOUT not STDERR and prefix with '#')
 * work around Bug in IO::Socket::INET6 on BSD systems
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39550
   by setting Domain based on PeerAddr
 * remove tests of recv/send from t/core.t. Might badly interact
   with SSL handshake and cause crashes as seen on OS X 10.4
 * IPv6 is enabled by default if IO::Socket::INET6 is available
 * t/inet6.t for basic tests
- remove last patch (fixed in upstream) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 17 16:45:47 CET 2008 - lnussel@suse.de

- fix typo that prevented wildcards in CN (bnc#445678)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  6 15:05:26 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.16 
 * change code for SSL_check_crl to use X509_STORE_set_flags
   instead of X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags
 * change opened() to report -1 if the IO::Handle is open, but the
   SSL connection failed, needed with HTTP::Daemon::SSL which will
   send an error mssage over the unencrypted socket

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 10 16:58:20 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.15
 * change internal behavior when SSL handshake failed (like when 
   verify callback returned an error) in the hope to fix spurios 
   errors in t/auto_verify_hostname.t

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 18 13:54:40 CEST 2008 - ro@suse.de

- hack to build also in buildservice where 127.0.0.1 can
  resolve to the hostname instead of localhost

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  4 00:35:10 CEST 2008 - ro@suse.de

- update require for Net_SSLeay to Net-SSLeay 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 25 15:59:47 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.14 
 * added support for verification of hostname from certificate
   including subjectAltNames, support for IDN etc
 * automatic verification of hostnames with SSL_verifycn_scheme and
   SSL_verifycn_name
 * global setting of default context options like SSL_verifycn_scheme,
   SSL_verify_mode with set_ctx_defaults
 * fix import of inet4,inet6 which got broken within 1.13_X.
 * clarified and enhanced debugging supppport
 * put information into README regarding the supported 
   and recommanded version of Net::SSLeay

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 28 15:27:25 CET 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.13
 * removed CLONE_SKIP which was added in 1.03 because this breaks
   windows forking. Handled threads/windows forking better by 
   making sure that CTX from Net::SSLeay gets not freed multiple 
   times from different threads after cloning/forking
 * removed setting LocalPort to 0 in tests, instead leave it undef
   if a random port should be allocated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  1 15:42:58 CET 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.12
  * treat timeouts of 0 for accept_SSL and connect_SSL like 
    no timeout, like IO::Socket does.
  * fixed errors in accept_SSL which would work when called 
    from start_SSL but not from accept
  * start_SSL, accept_SSL and connect_SSL have argument for 
    Timeout so that the SSL handshake will not block forever. Only 
    used if the socket is blocking. If not set the Timeout value 
    from the underlying IO::Socket is used
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  8 09:24:08 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.09
  * new method stop_SSL as opposite of start_SSL
  * try to make it clearer that thread support is buggy
  * make sure that Scalar::Util has support for dualvar
    (Makefile.PL,SSL.pm) because the perl*only version has
    has no dualvar

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 11 09:36:41 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.07
  * fix t/nonblock.t on systems which have by default a larger
    socket buffer. Set SO_SNDBUF explicitly with setsockopt
    to force smaller writes on the socket
- move testing to %check

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 15 16:10:34 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.06
  * instead of setting undef args to '' in configure_SSL drop
    them. This makes Net::SMTP::SSL working again because it
    does not give LocalPort of '' to IO::Socket::INET any more

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 23 13:31:13 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.05
  * make session cache working even if the IO::Socket::SSL object
    was not created with IO::Socket::SSL->new but with
    IO::Socket::SSL->start_SSL on an established socket

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 30 16:02:45 CEST 2007 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.04

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 13 12:18:37 CET 2006 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.02
  * added some info to BUGS and to BUGS section of pod
  * added TELL and BINMODE to IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_HANDLE, even
    if they do nothing useful.
  * all tests allocate now the ports dynamically, so there should
    be no longer a conflict with open ports on the system where
    the tests run

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 14 12:24:11 CEST 2006 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 1.01
  * add support for Diffie Hellman Key Exchange. 
  * accept_SSL sets errors on $socket (the accepted socket)
    not $self (the listening socket if called from accept)
  * many bugfixes  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 24 14:54:30 CEST 2006 - anicka@suse.cz
