%description
Best Practices for Kubernetes Workload Configuration

Fairwinds' Polaris keeps your clusters sailing smoothly. It runs a variety of checks to ensure that Kubernetes pods and controllers are configured using best practices, helping you avoid problems in the future.

Polaris can be run in three different modes:
* As a dashboard, so you can audit what's running inside your cluster.
* As an admission controller, so you can automatically reject workloads that don't adhere to your organization's policies.
* As a command-line tool, so you can test local YAML files, e.g. as part of a CI/CD process.
