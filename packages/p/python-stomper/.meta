  <description>This is a python client implementation of the STOMP protocol.
 
The client is attempting to be transport layer neutral. This module provides
functions to create and parse STOMP messages in a programatic fashion. The
messages can be easily generated and parsed, however its up to the user to do
the sending and receiving.</description>
