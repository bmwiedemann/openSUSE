- update to 1.2.0:
  * NEW: `ezdxf` requires Python 3.9 or newer
  * NEW: support for the [[SPATIAL_FILTER]] entity.
  * This is the basic requirement to support clipping of block
    references and XREFs aka the [[XCLIP]] command in CAD
    applications
  * NEW: `ezdxf.xclip` module for adding 2D clipping paths to
    block references and XREFs
  * replicates the [[XCLIP]] command
  * NEW: support for the [[IMAGE]] entity in the [[drawing add-
    on]], added by [[mbway]]
  * supported by these backends:
  * [[PyQtBackend]]
  * [[MatplotlibBackend]]
  * [[PyMuPdfBackend]]
  * NEW: the `ezdxf draw` command supports additional backends by
    option `--backend {matplotlib,qt,mupdf,custom_svg}`, added by
  * NEW: `ezdxf.colors.RGBA` class
  * NEW: support for font-name synonyms, find macOS fonts on
    Windows/Linux and vice vesa
  * NEW: additional font search directory added for macOS
    `/System/Library/Fonts/` by [[ru4ert]]
  * the cache version number has been increased so that the
    fontmanger-cache is automatically rebuilt
  * NEW: `MeshBuilder.render_3dsolid()`, create [[3DSOLID]]
    entities from simple polyhedrons (experimental)
  * NEW: `Auditor` fixes non-existing linetypes in layers,
    replaced by `Continuous`
  * NEW: export and load DXF documents as JSON encoded tags
  * `ezdxf.document.export_json_tags()`
  * `ezdxf.document.load_json_tags()`
  * CHANGE: renamed `Image.boundray_path_ocs()` to
    `Image.pixel_boundary_path()`
  * CHANGE: refactoring of the [[RecorderBackend]]
  * CHANGE: replaced `ezdxf.math.linspace` by `numpy.linspace`
  * CHANGE: replaced functions `gauss_jordan_solver()`,
    `gauss_jordan_inverse()`, `gauss_vector_solver()` and
    `gauss_matrix_solver()` by a `numpy` based solution
  * moved replaced functions to module `ezdxf.math.legacy`
  * CHANGE: replaced `LUDecomposition` class by `NumpySolver`
    class
  * moved `LUDecomposition` to module `ezdxf.math.legacy`
  * CHANGE: `MeshData.vertices` has to be a list of `Vec3`
  * CHANGE: renamed `ClippingPolygon2d` to
    `ConvexClippingPolygon2d`
  * CHANGE: The Cython extensions have been reverted to pure
    Cython code and removed low-level C++ classes to make it
    easier to maintain, but with a small performance penalty.
  * REMOVE: untested and incorrect implementation of
    `ezdxf.math.BezierSurface`
  * BUGFIX: Restore lost links between `LAYOUT` and
    `BLOCK_RECORD` entities
  * BUGFIX: `NumpyPath2d` could contain 3d vertices
  * BUGFIX: DXF attribute `invisible` wasn't exported
  * BUGFIX: catch exceptions of the `draw` command when required
    dependencies are not installed
