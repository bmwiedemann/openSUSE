%description
This module provides loaders and dumpers for PyYAML. Currently, an
OrderedDict loader/dumper is implemented, allowing to keep items order
when loading resp. dumping a file from/to an OrderedDict (Python 3.7:
Also regular dicts are supported and are the default items to be loaded
to. As of Python 3.7 preservation of insertion order is a language
feature of regular dicts.)
