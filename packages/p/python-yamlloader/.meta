  <title>Ordered YAML loader and dumper for PyYAML</title>
  <description>This module provides loaders and dumpers for PyYAML. Currently, an OrderedDict loader/dumper is implemented, allowing to keep items order when loading resp. dumping a file from/to an OrderedDict (Python 3.7: Also regular dicts are supported and are the default items to be loaded to. As of Python 3.7 preservation of insertion order is a language feature of regular dicts.)

This project was originally mirrored from yamlordereddict Many thanks to the original author François Ménabé! The library contains several improvements including automated testing and the much faster C-versions of the Loaders/Dumpers.</description>
