Subject: Do not build native plugins

Native plugins are problematic to package on account of being
binaries being looked for into datadir. Will have to create
a better patch that looks for them inside libdir, but for now
I'm simply disabling them.

Furthermore, according to upstream, they aren't particularly useful.
