- update to version 2.5.1:
 - Enhancements:
  - Adds support for the Illuminate CTI module with Intel Profile API library
    calls and `analzyer` objects. Includes support for all API parameters and
    handles pagination automatically.
  - Adds support for Illuminate Attack Surface Intelligence including third-party
    attack surfaces. 
  - Ability to filter all RecordList analyzer objects by a list of values using
    new `filter_in` method.
  - Ability to filter all RecordList analyzer objects by a case-insensitive
    substring search using new `filter_substring` method. Especially useful for
    filtering a list of Attack Surface Insights or Attack Surface Third-Party vendors.
 - Bug Fixes:
  - Filter methods on RecordList objects now consistently return lists instead of
    filters.
  - Property return NotImplemented type for base methods.
  - Ensure strings are returned for firstseen / lastseen dates in certificates
    property. Was causing json encoding errors when trying to encode
    `certificates.as_dict`.
  - Add missing `duration` property to pDNS `resolutions.as_dict`
  - Fixed save_to_project() API call; was broken after introduction of new API 
    exception types.
- update to version 2.5.0:
 - Enhancements:
  - Raise `AnalyzerAPIError` when a non-200 response is returned from the API.
  - Add SSL hash field to list of SSL fields in dictionary output for more convenient
    integrations.
  - Add firstseen and lastseen dates to SSL Certificate records.
  - Optional support for the Pandas data analysis library. Adds as_df property to all
    Analyzer objects to render the object as a Pandas dataframe. 
  - Add option to specify module-level date ranges with `datetime` objects for
    easier integration with other libraries.
  - Subdomain API support with the `subdomains` property of Hostname objects.
 - Bug Fixes:
  - `is_ip()` regex fix to avoid matching on hostnames with embedded IPs.
  - Fixed broken `available` property on summary objects.
  - Fixed missing publish date on Articles

Sun Jun 20 08:52:03 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.4.2:
 -  Enhancements:
  - Throw `AnalyzerError` when a hostname cannot be resolved to an IP
  - Add links to summary card as_dict method
 -  Bug Fixes
  - Added missing docstring for `services` property
  - Fixed various issues with `as_dict` property to ensure only serializable
    types made it into the dictionary. 
  - Ensured Projects would load by GUID regardless of visiblity.
  - Removed a partially-implemented __str__ method in `MalwareList` method
  - Ensured all __str__ methods in `analyzer` objects always return a string
  - Upserting an artifact triggered an API error when setting a tag
  - Ensure `summary` property returns ints, not None, when fields are missing
  - Properly handle defanged ip addresses 
  - Exclude Nones from sets in various properties to avoid problems with `NoneTypes`

Mon May 24 17:14:59 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.4.1:
 - Enhancements:
  - Added an as_dict property across all Analyzer objects to simplify integration with other systems. Returns a dictionary representation of the object or the list.
  - New projects attribute on IPAddress and Hostname objects returns list of projects that contain that host as an artifact.
  - New analyzer.set_project() method on the Analyzer module to set an active project by name or guid, and new add_to_project() methods on Analyzer objects to quickly add the object to the active project.
  - Direct methods on new Project and Artifact objects to directly manipulate monitoring status and tags.
 - Bug Fixes:
  - Added missing ArtifactsRequest to package-level imports

Fri May 14 14:04:15 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.4.0:
 - Enhancements:
  - Early implementation of exception handling for SSL properties; analyzer. AnalyzerError now available as a base exception type.
  - SSL certs will now populate their own ip property, accessing the SSL history API when needed to fill in the details.
  - New iphistory property of SSL certs to support the ip property and give direct access to the historial results.
  - Used the tldextract Python library to expose useful properties on Hostname objects such as tld, registered_domain, and subdomain
  - Change default days back for date-aware searches to 90 days (was 30)
  - Reject IPs as strings for Hostname objects
  - Ensure IPs are used when instantiating IPAddress objects
  - Defang hostnames (i.e. analyzer.Hostname('api[.]riskiq[.]net') )
  - Support for Articles as a property of Hostnames and IPs, with autoloading for detailed fields including indicators, plus easy access to a list of all articles directly from analyzer.AllArticles()
  - Support for Malware as a property of Hostnames and IPs
  - Better coverage of pretty printing and dictionary representation across analyzer objects.
 - Bug Fixes:
  - Exception handling when no details found for an SSL certificate.
  - Proper handling of None types that may have prevented result caching
