- update to version 2.4.0:
 - Enhancements:
  - Early implementation of exception handling for SSL properties; analyzer. AnalyzerError now available as a base exception type.
  - SSL certs will now populate their own ip property, accessing the SSL history API when needed to fill in the details.

  - Used the tldextract Python library to expose useful properties on Hostname objects such as tld, registered_domain, and subdomain
  - Change default days back for date-aware searches to 90 days (was 30)
  - Reject IPs as strings for Hostname objects
  - Ensure IPs are used when instantiating IPAddress objects
  - Defang hostnames (i.e. analyzer.Hostname('api[.]riskiq[.]net') )
  - Support for Articles as a property of Hostnames and IPs, with autoloading for detailed fields including indicators, plus easy access to a list of all articles directly from analyzer.AllArticles()
  - Support for Malware as a property of Hostnames and IPs
  - Better coverage of pretty printing and dictionary representation across analyzer objects.
 - Bug Fixes:
  - Exception handling when no details found for an SSL certificate.
  - Proper handling of None types that may have prevented result caching
