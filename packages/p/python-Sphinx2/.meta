  <description>Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of multiple
reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl.  It was originally created
for the new Python documentation, and has excellent facilities for Python
project documentation, but C/C++ is supported as well, and more languages are
planned.
 
Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths
come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing
and translating suite, the Docutils.</description>
