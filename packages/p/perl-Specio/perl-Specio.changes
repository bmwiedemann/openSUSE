  - Change Specio constraint object's stringification overloading to return the
    type name rather than the default Perl object stringification, which gives
    you something like
    "Specio::Constraint::Parameterized=HASH(0x564d258efb48)". Anonymous are
    special cased to return something you can print.

  - All types now overload the `eq` comparison operator. Moose expects types to
    be comparable in this manner when doing role summation. This fixes a bug
    reported by Martin Gruner. GH #18.

  - No code changes, just fixing a mistake in the POD. Reported by Petr
    Pisar. Fixes #17.

  - Replaced the use of B with XString if it is installed. The latter is much
    smaller and provides the one subroutine from B we cared about. Based on GH
    #15. Implemented by Nicolas R.

  - Optimized compile-time operations to make Specio itself quicker to
    load. Specio's load time is a non-trivial part of the load time of DateTime
    (and presumably other things that use it). Based on
    https://github.com/houseabsolute/DateTime.pm/issues/85. Reported by
    versable.

  - The Perl library claimed it provided types named LaxVersionStr and
    StrictVersionStr but they were really named LaxVersion and
    StrictVersion. The names have now been fixed to match the documentation, so
    they are LaxVersionStr and StrictVersionStr.
  
  
  0.41     2017-11-04
  
  - Fixed checks for whether a class is loaded in light of upcoming optimization
    in Perl 5.28. Fixed by Sprout (GH #12).

  - Fixed more bugs with {any,object}_{can,does,isa}_type. When passed a glob
    (not a globref) they would die in their type check. On Perl 5.16 or earlier,
    passing a number to an any_* type would also die.
  
  - Fixed subification overloading. If Sub::Quote was loaded, this would be
    used, but any environment variables needed for the closure would not be
    included. This broke enums, among other things.

  - Many bug fixes and improves to the types created by
    {any,object}_{can,does,isa}_type. In some cases, an invalid value could
    cause an exception in type check itself. In other cases, a value which
    failed a type check would cause an exception when generating a message
    describing the failure. These cases have all been fixed.
  
  - The messages describing a failure for all of these types have been improved.
  
  - You can now create anonymous *_does and *_isa types using the exports from
    Specio::Declare.

  - Simplify checks for overloading to not call overload::Overloaded(). Just
    checking the return value of overload::Method() is sufficient.

    modules that use Specio.

  - Inlined coercions would attempt to coerce for every type which matched the
    value given, instead of stopping after the first type. Fixed by Graham Knop
    (GH #11).
  
  - Inlined coercions did not include the inline environment variables needed by
    the type from which the coercion was being performed. Fixed by Graham Knop
    (GH #8).
  
  - When you use the same type repeatedly as coderef (for example, as a
    constraint with Moo), it will only generated its subified form once, rather
    than regenerating it each time it is de-referenced.
  
  - Added an API to Specio::Subs to allow you to combine type libraries and
    helper subs in one package for exporting. See the Specio::Exporter docs for
    more details.

- updated to 0.35
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Specio/Changes

  0.35     2017-02-12
  
  - Added Specio::Subs, a module which allows you to turn one or more library's
    types into subroutines like is_Int() and to_Int().
  
  - Added an inline_coercion method to Specio constraints.
  
  
  0.34     2017-01-29
  
  - Packages with Specio::Exporter as their parent can now specify additional
    arbitrary subs to exporter. See the Specio::Exporter docs for details.
  
  - Importing the same library twice in a given package would throw an
    exception. The second attempt to import is now ignored.
  
  - Added an alpha implementation of structured types. See
    Specio::Library::Structured for details.
  
  
  0.33     2017-01-24
  
  - Fixed a mistake in the SYNOPSIS for Specio::Declare. The example for the
    *_isa_type helpers was not correct.
  
  - Removed the alpha warning from the docs. This is being used by enough of my
    modules on CPAN that I don't plan on doing any big breaking changes without
    a deprecation first.
  
  
  0.32     2017-01-12
  
  - Fixed a bug in the inlining for types create by any_can_type() and
    object_can_type(). This inlining mostly worked by accident because of some
    List::Util XS magic, but this broke under the debugger. Reported by
    Christian Walde (GH #6) and Chan Wilson
    (https://github.com/houseabsolute/DateTime.pm/issues/49).

  - The stack trace contained by Specio::Exception objects no longer includes a
    stack frames for the Specio::Exception package.
  
  - Made the inline_environment() and description() methods public on type and
    coercion objects.

  - Fix a bug with the Sub::Quoted sub returned by $type->coercion_sub. If a
    type had more than one coercion, the generated sub could end up coercing the
    value to undef some of the time. Depending on hash key ordering, this could
    end up being a heisenbug that only occured some of the time.

    failure message generation code for a type.

  - Added a Test::Specio module to provide helpers for testing Specio libraries.
  
  - Fixed another bug with a subtype of special types and inlining.
  
  
  0.27     2016-10-01
  
  - Cloning a type with coercions defined on it would cause an exception.
  
  - Creating a subtype of a special type created by *_isa_type, *_can_type, or
    *_does_type, or enum would die when trying to inline the type constraint.
  
  - Removed the never-documented Any type.
  
  - Added documentation for each type in Specio::Library::Builtins.
  
  
  0.26     2016-09-24
  
  - Require Role::Tiny 1.003003. This should fix the test failures some
    CPANTesters reported with this error:
  
      Can't resolve method "???" overloading "&{}" in package
      "Specio::Constraint::Simple" at Specio::Constraint::Simple->new line 35.
  
  
  0.25     2016-09-04
  
  - Calling {any,object}_{isa,does}_type repeatedly in a package with the same
    class or role name would die. These subs are now special-cased to simply
    return an existing type for the given name when they receive a single
    argument (the name of the class or role). This could come up if you had two
    attributes both of which required an object of the same type.
