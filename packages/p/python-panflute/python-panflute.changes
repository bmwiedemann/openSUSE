- Update to version 2.2.3 
  * Added equality operator to element objects (Doc, Block, Inline, Str, etc.)
    Misc. bugfixes

- Update to version 2.2.1
  * Minor improvement to stringify()
  * Bugfixes detected by flake8

- Update to version 2.2.0
  * The run_filters() function, as well as .walk() method now support as optional argument a stop_if function.
    If this argument is used and not none, then .walk() will not walk through an element's children if stop_if(element) is True.
  This has two uses:
  We can speed up filters by avoiding going too deep into the document's tree. For instance:
  def stop_if(elem):
    return isinstance(elem, pf.Inline)
  Will stop walking the tree once it reaches an inline element

  * Some filters become easier to write, because we can just act on a main element such as Table and then by hand call .walk() to each table component
    This also simplifies possible stringify() improvements, as discussed in #218 and illustrated in c8b4365 for DefinitionList elements
    Other minor changes:
    Simplified element.walk() code and added .walk() methods to ListContainer and DictContainer
    Minor code cleanup to reduce pycodestyle warnings

- Update to version 2.1.3
  * Update documentation and dependencies:
  Add support and test against Python 3.10 and Pandoc 2.16
  * Improve test matrix suite
  Test and document lists of elements as return values of filters (the items on the list will be inserted at the same level as the item being replaced)

- Update to version 2.1.1
  * Same as 2.1.0 but fixed a dependency (wheels) required to publish to pypi

- Update to version 2.1.0
  * autofilter.py: add pandoc 2.12+ support to get_filter_dirs
  * add pandoc_path argument to run_pandoc(): run_pandoc(text='', args=None, pandoc_path=which('pandoc')
  * fix a few docstrings

- Update to version 2.0.5
  * Fix #166 ("Regression: panflute.elements.builtin2meta no longer supports subclasses of builtins")
  * Improve testing ( #170, #169, #164)
