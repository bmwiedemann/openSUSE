%description
Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by
Percona (http://www.percona.com/) support staff to perform a variety of
MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because
they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented.
They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and
no libraries are installed.

Percona Toolkit is developed and supported by Percona Inc.  For more
information and other free, open-source software developed by Percona,
visit http://www.percona.com/software/.

This collection was formerly known as Maatkit.
