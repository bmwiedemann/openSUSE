  <description>The package logilab.common contains several modules providing low level
functionalities shared among some python projects developed by logilab.
 
The package is used by pylint, an advanced Python style and syntax
checker.
 
Please note that some of the modules have some extra dependencies. For
instance, logilab.common.db will require a db-api 2.0 compliant
database driver. Command line parsing modules require optik to be
installed, if you're using python2.1 or 2.2.
 
Please send any comment, patch or question to the python-projects
mailing-list. Before asking a question, please first search the

use google and add &quot;site:lists.logilab.org&quot; to your keywords to narrow
your search. We will soon provide our own search engine.</description>
