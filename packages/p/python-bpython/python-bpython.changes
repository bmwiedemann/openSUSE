      deprecated and will show a warning that they'll be removed in a

    + Usage in combination with Python 2 has been deprecated. This
      does not mean that support is dropped instantly but rather that
      at some point in the future we will stop running our testcases
      against Python 2.
    + The new pinnwand API is used for the pastebin functionality. We
      have dropped two configuration options: `pastebin_show_url` and
