- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 0.19:
  * General information:
    + The bpython-cli and bpython-urwid rendering backends have been
      deprecated and will show a warning that they'll be removed in a
      future release when started.
    + Usage in combination with Python 2 has been deprecated. This
      does not mean that support is dropped instantly but rather that
      at some point in the future we will stop running our testcases
      against Python 2.
    + The new pinnwand API is used for the pastebin functionality. We
      have dropped two configuration options: `pastebin_show_url` and
      `pastebin_removal_url`. If you have your bpython configured to
      run against an old version of `pinnwand` please update it.
  * Fixes:
    + #765: Display correct signature for decorated functions.  Thanks
       to Benedikt Rascher-Friesenhausen.
    + #776: Protect get_args from user code exceptions
    + Improve lock file handling on Windows
    + #791: Use importlib instead of deprecated imp when running under
       Python 3
  * Support for Python 3.8 has been added. Support for Python 3.4 has
    been dropped.
